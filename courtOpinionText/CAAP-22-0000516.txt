OPINION OF THE COURT BY HIRAOKA, J.
In 2000 the Hawai #i Board of Land and Natural Resources
(BLNR) issued four Permits to Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. ( A&B) and
its subsidiary, East Maui Irrigation Company, LLC ( EMI).  The
Permits let A&B and EMI divert water from streams in East Maui to
Central and Upcountry Maui.  Each permit was valid for one year. BLNR has continued the Permits annually, while a contested caseon A&B and EMI's application for a 30-year water lease ispending.  BLNR considered renewing the Permits for 2021 during apublic meeting on November 13, 2020.  The Sierra Club  requested a
contested case hearing.  BLNR denied the request and voted to
continue the Permits.
Sierra Club appealed.  The County of Maui (a major user
of the diverted water) intervened.  The Environmental Court of
the First Circuit ordered BLNR to hold a contested case hearingand reserved jurisdiction to modify the Permits.
1  The court
later reduced the amount of water A&B and EMI could divert.  Thecourt also awarded attorneys fees and costs to Sierra Club.
BLNR, A&B, EMI, and the County filed these secondary
appeals.  We hold: (1) the Environmental Court had jurisdiction
over Sierra Club's appeal from BLNR's denial of a contested case
hearing, and exceptions to the mootness doctrine applied, but itdid not have jurisdiction over Sierra Club's appeal from BLNR'sdecision to continue the Permits; (2) constitutional due process

did not require a contested case under the circumstances
presented here; (3) the Environmental Court erred by modifying
the conditions under which BLNR continued the Permits; and
(4) Sierra Club was not entitled to attorneys fees or costs.
I. BACKGROUND
For 138 years, A&B and EMI have owned and operated a
ditch system that diverts surface water from East Maui to Centraland Upcountry Maui for agricultural, domestic, and other uses. See
 Maui Tomorrow v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res. , 110 Hawai #i 234,
236, 131 P.3d 517, 519 (2006).  A&B's and EMI's original waterleases from the State of Hawai #i have expired.  A&B and EMI
applied for a 30-year water lease in 2001.  BLNR granted requestsby Maui Tomorrow and N ā Moku #Aupuni #o Ko#olau Hui for a
contested case on the long-term lease application.  The County,Maui Land & Pineapple Co., Inc., and the Hawaii Farm BureauFederation are also participating in the contested case.  Thecontested case remains pending before BLNR.
BLNR issued the Permits to A&B and EMI in 2000.  Maui

v. Board of Land and Natural Resources , 1CC191000019, No. CAAP-
22-0000063 (the 2019 Sierra Club Lawsuit ).  In that case, Sierra
Club sued BLNR, A&B, EMI, the County, and others3 for declaratory
and injunctive relief, alleging violation of Hawaii RevisedStatutes ( HRS) Chapters 343 (Environmental Impact Statements) and
205A (Coastal Zone Management) by all defendants, and breach of

In some of the matters before the Board, a person may wish
to request a contested case hearing.  If such a request ismade before the Board's decision, then the Board willconsider the request first — before considering the meritsof the item before it.  A person who wants a contested casemay also wait until the Board decides the issue, thenrequest the contested case after the decision.  It is up toyou.  Any request must be made in writing within ten days. If no request for contested case is made, the Board willmake a decision.  The Department will treat the decision asfinal and proceed accordingly.
Continuation of the Permits was item D-8 on the agenda. 
The record has over 13,000 pages of material presented to BLNR onitem D-8, including staff submissions, maps, charts, reports,written testimony, a draft environmental impact statement,information from the Maui Department of Water Supply and theCommission on Water Resource Management ( CWRM), and other
resource material.
Sierra Club submitted 14 pages of written testimony
containing "a summary of recommendations for improving the staffsubmittal followed up [by] an in-depth analysis and explanationto justify our detailed recommendations to" BLNR.  Sierra Clubargued that 15 changes "must be made to the proposed revocablepermits if any are issued[.]"  Sierra Club also provided "keyfacts" it felt had been omitted from the staff submittal.

Sierra Club appealed BLNR's decisions to the circuit
court.  The appeal was assigned to the Environmental Court.11  
The County intervened as an appellee.  On May 28, 2021, theEnvironmental Court entered its Interim Decision  on Appeal.  The
Interim Decision stated:
2. The court concludes the Sierra Club's due
process rights were violated, because a contested casehearing was required before the BLNR voted on November 13,2020 to extend A&B's revocable permits.
. . . .7. HRS [§] 91-14(g) defines what this court can
order.  Since the court concludes Sierra Club had a propertyinterest protected by due process rights under the Hawai #i
Constitution as defined by laws relating to environmentalquality, and since the court concludes those rights wereprejudiced because of the BLNR's denial of a contested casehearing, the court may "reverse or modify" the BLNR'sdecision per HRS 91-14(g).  Here, the court has no record or
briefing to objectively decide on any specific modification
of the permits .  At the same time, the court does not wish
to create unintended consequences or chaos by vacating the
permits without knowing the practical consequences of suchan order, especially when in seven months (absent furtherlegal developments) there will likely be another hearing toextend the existing [Permits] and new [Permits] will likelyreplace the existing [Permits].  Therefore:
A. The court hereby orders BLNR to hold a
contested case hearing on the Revocable Permits which were
approved by BLNR on or about 11/13/20 .  The contested case
hearing(s) shall be held as soon as practicable.  This order
11The environmental courts are divisions of the circuit courts.

11FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
is effective immediately.  Pursuant to HRS 91-14(g)(i)[sic],
the court reserves jurisdiction[] and expects to appoint amaster or monitor to ensure prompt compliance with thisorder.  The parties are invited to agree on a master ormonitor, or promptly (no later than June 7, 2021) submitthree names each to the court; and
B. The court hereby orders that the Revocable
Permits approved on or about 11/13/20 be vacated.  However,the effective date of this order is hereby stayed and the
court reserves jurisdiction to consider any additional
requests from the parties on whether or not the court should
modify the existing permits , and how, or whether the court
should leave the existing permits in place until their
current expiration date.  If no such further requests arefiled by 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday, June 30, 2021, the stayordered in this paragraph is lifted without further actionby the court.  In that event, the Revocable Permits approvedon or about 11/13/20 shall automatically be vacated withoutfurther order of this court, at 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday,June 30, 2021.  If such further
 requests are filed, then the
stay remains in place and the court reserves jurisdictionuntil further order while the court considers the requests.
(Emphasis added; strikeouts reflect clarifications made by minute
order after entry of the Interim Decision.)
BLNR moved for partial reconsideration of the Interim
Decision, entry of an appealable judgment or leave to file aninterlocutory appeal, and a stay of enforcement of the InterimDecision.  A&B and EMI filed a partial joinder and asked for thePermits to remain in effect until they expired at the end of2021.  The County joined in the motion and partial joinder.  Sierra Club opposed the motions and asked for changes to thePermits.  The Environmental Court denied BLNR's motion and thejoinders.
The Environmental Court entered its Ruling and Order
Modifying Permits  on July 30, 2021.  It stated:
8. The permits at issue are hereby modified as
follows:  the stream diversions covered by the permits atissue are hereby limited to no more than 25 million gallons
of water per day (averaged monthly)  from east Maui streams. 
This limit shall remain in place until the anticipated
contested case hearing is held and a decision rendered, or
12FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
until further order of the court.  This should be more than
enough water to allow all users the water they require,
while hopefully reducing apparent or potential waste .  Any
provision of the permits at issue contrary to the
modification in this paragraph is hereby vacated.
. . . .10. The court retains jurisdiction to further modify
the permits at issue if necessary.  This retention ofjurisdiction will last until a contested case hearing isheld on the permits at issue.  If it appears to any partythat the court's modification may or is leading to anyshortage of water for the County, for Mahi Pono, or forother recognized beneficiaries,[
12] that party is welcome to
immediately contact the court so that an expedited processcan be set to hear and address any problems immediately.
(Emphasis added; original bolding and underscoring omitted.)
The Environmental Court entered its Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law and Order  on August 23, 2021.  It stated:
D. BLNR shall hold a new hearing on the permits at
issue as soon as practicable.  It shall be a contested casehearing assuming a proper request is made.
E. The court retains limited jurisdiction to
further modify the permits at issue if necessary.  Thisretention of limited jurisdiction will last until furtherorder of the court, or until the contested case hearing onthe permits concludes and a decision or order is issued.  Ifit appears to any party that the court's modification [ofthe Permits] may or is leading to any shortage for theCounty, for Mahi Pono, or for other recognizedbeneficiaries, that party may immediately contact the courtso that an expedited process can be set to hear and addressany problems immediately.
The Environmental Court later issued a supplemental
order extending the end date for the Permits "from December 31,2021 until the earlier of (1) May 1, 2022, (2) the date on which[BLNR] renders a substantive decision on the continuation of the[Permits] for calendar year 2022, or (3) further order of" the

court.  The court also awarded Sierra Club attorneys fees and
costs, apportioned between A&B, EMI, and the County.
BLNR held a contested case hearing on the 2021 and 2022
continuations during December 2021.  BLNR entered a decision andorder on June 30, 2022.  It continued the Permits, subject to23 conditions.  Sierra Club appealed.  The Environmental Courtentered a judgment against Sierra Club.  Sierra Club's secondaryappeal is pending as No. CAAP-24-0000082.
The Environmental Court waited until BLNR issued its
decision and order in the contested case before entering theFinal Judgment below on July 27, 2022.  A&B and EMI filed anotice of appeal, resulting in No. CAAP-22-0000516.  The Countyfiled a cross-appeal.  BLNR filed its own appeal, resulting inNo. CAAP-22-0000519.  We consolidated the appeals.  BLNR, A&B,EMI, and the County variously argue that the Environmental Courterred by: (1) concluding that a contested case hearing was
required; (2) modifying the Permits; (3) denying BLNR's motion
for entry of an appealable judgment or for leave to file an
interlocutory appeal; and (4) awarding attorneys fees and costs
to Sierra Club.

Sierra Club's appeal from the denial of itsrequest for a contested case hearing, andexceptions to the mootness doctrine apply;the Environmental Court did not havejurisdiction over Sierra Club's appeal fromBLNR's decision to continue the Permits.
We must first determine whether the Environmental Court
had subject matter jurisdiction over Sierra Club's appeal.  See
State v. Diaz , 128 Hawai #i 215, 222, 286 P.3d 824, 831 (2012)
(noting that an appellate court has an independent obligation toensure jurisdiction over each case).  Subject matter jurisdictionmay be examined at any stage of an action.  Kanahele
, 152 Hawai #i
at 509, 526 P.3d at 486.
Sierra Club appealed to the circuit court under HRS
§ 91-14, which applies to "a final decision and order in acontested case[.]"  The denial of a proper request for acontested case is a "final decision and order" appealable underHRS § 91-14.  Kaleikini v. Thielen
, 124 Hawai #i 1, 26, 237 P.3d
1067, 1092 (2010).  Sierra Club's request for a contested casehearing complied with Hawaii Administrative Rules ( HAR) § 13-1-29
(eff. 2009) ("Request for hearing").  The Environmental Court (a
division of the circuit court) had jurisdiction over SierraClub's appeal from BLNR's denial of a contested case hearing.
16FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
It seems that most of the issues presented by these
appeals (except for the award of attorneys fees and costs) aremoot.  BLNR complied with the Environmental Court's InterimDecision, conducted a contested case hearing, and approved thecontinuation of the Permits for 2021 (and 2022).  Sierra Club'ssecondary appeal is pending as No. CAAP-24-0000082.  The 2021continuation period has ended.  But "mootness is an issue ofjusticiability, not an issue of subject matter jurisdiction." State v. Hewitt
, 153 Hawai #i 33, 42, 526 P.3d 558, 567 (2023). 
The "capable of repetition, yet evading review" and "publicinterest" exceptions to the mootness doctrine apply here, for thereasons explained in Carmichael
, 150 Hawai #i at 560-62, 506 P.3d
at 224-26.
BLNR's decision to continue the Permits for 2021 was
made during a public meeting after BLNR denied Sierra Club'srequest for a contested case hearing.  To "determine whetherthere was a final decision and order in a contested case fromwhich a direct appeal to circuit court can be taken[,]" we mustdetermine whether the proceeding was "a 'contested case' orsimply an agency meeting."  Bush v. Hawaiian Homes Comm'n
, 76
Hawai#i 128, 133 & n.2, 870 P.2d 1272, 1277 & n.2 (1994).
During oral argument, Sierra Club's counsel represented
that the Hawai #i Supreme Court has held all "sunshine" meetings
(apparently referring to meetings held under the Sunshine Law,HRS § 92-3) to be contested case hearings.  Counsel cited E&J
Lounge Operating Co. v. Liquor Commission , 118 Hawai #i 320, 189

P.3d 432 (2008), Mahuiki v. Planning Commission , 65 Haw. 506, 654

the Land, Inc. v. Land Use Commission , 61 Haw. 3, 594 P.2d 1079
(1979).
Counsel is wrong.  E&J Lounge  concerned a liquor
license application; a contested case was required by statute —HRS §§ 281-52 and 281-57.  118 Hawai #i at 349-50, 189 P.3d at
461-62.  In Mahuiki
 a contested case on the application for a
special management area use permit was also required by statute,HRS § 205A-29.  65 Haw. at 513, 654 P.2d at 879 (citing Chang v.
Planning Comm'n , 64 Haw. 431, 436, 643 P.2d 55, 60 (1982) (noting
that the "state Coastal Zone Management Act . . . specificallymake[s] HRS [§] 91-9 and planning commission contested caseprocedures applicable to proceedings on SMA use permitapplications" (citing HRS § 205A-29 (a)))).  In Mortensen
 a
statute — HRS § 88-73 — required a contested case hearing by theBoard of Trustees of the Hawai #i Employees' Retirement System on
state employees' applications for accidental disabilityretirement benefits.  52 Haw. at 217-18, 473 P.2d at 870.  AndLife of the Land
 concerned Land Use Commission proceedings to
reclassify land from agricultural to urban; a contested case wasrequired by the statute in effect at the time, HRS § 205-11.  See
Life of the Land v. Land Use Comm'n , 63 Haw. 166, 169 & n.2, 623

written petition met the procedural requirements of theadministrative rules.  124 Hawai #i at 19-20, 237 P.3d at 1085-86. 
The dissent cites Kilakila #O Haleakala v. Board of
Land and Natural Resources , 131 Hawai #i 193, 317 P.3d 27 (2013),
for the proposition that the Environmental Court had jurisdictionover Sierra Club's appeal from BLNR's decision to continue thePermits.  In Kilakila #O Haleakala
 the supreme court held that
HAR § 13-5-40(a)(4) required  a hearing on the conservation
district use application, but "no formal contested case hearingwas actually held before the BLNR voted to grant the permit[.]" Id.
 at 201-02, 317 P.3d at 35-36.  The supreme court held that
BLNR's decision to approve the application was a final decisionand order in what should have been  a contested case within the
meaning of HRS § 91-14.  Id.
 at 203, 317 P.3d at 37.
Here, Sierra Club concedes that no statute or rule
required a contested case on continuation of the Permits.  Weexplain below that Sierra Club's right to constitutional dueprocess was not violated by BLNR's denial of its request for acontested case hearing.  There having been no requirement for acontested case, the Environmental Court had no jurisdiction overSierra Club's HRS § 91-14 appeal from BLNR's decision to continuethe Permits.
13
13Our holding does not leave Sierra Club without a potential remedy
to challenge a BLNR decision continuing a revocable permit under HRS § 171-55 (2011).  HRS § 91-14(a) (2012) provides that "nothing in this section shall bedeemed to prevent resort to other means of review, redress, relief, or trialde novo, including the right of trial by jury, provided by law."

B. Constitutional due process did not require
that BLNR conduct a contested case hearing.
BLNR must hold a contested case hearing when required
by law.  See  HRS § 91-1 (Supp. 2022) ("'Contested case' means a
proceeding in which the legal rights, duties, or privileges ofspecific parties are required by law  to be determined after an
opportunity for agency hearing." (emphasis added)).  A contestedcase is "required by law" when one is required by: (1) statute;(2) administrative rule; or (3) constitutional due process. Flores
, 143 Hawai #i at 124, 424 P.3d at 479.  Sierra Club
concedes that a contested case was not required by statute oradministrative rule; it asserts a constitutional due processright.
The supreme court has articulated a 2-step analysis for
determining whether a party has a constitutional due processright to a contested case:
First, this court considers whether the particular interest
which claimant seeks to protect by a hearing is "property"within the meaning of the due process clauses of the federaland state constitutions.  Second, if this court concludesthat the interest is "property," this court analyzes whatspecific procedures are required to protect it.
Flores, 143 Hawai #i at 125, 424 P.3d at 480 (cleaned up).
Once a party shows it has a constitutionally protected
property interest, the second step involves a balancing test todetermine whether a contested case is required to protect it. 
13(...continued)
remedies could include an action for declaratory or injunctive relief.  See,
e.g., Carmichael .  Sierra Club sought those remedies in the 2019 Sierra Club
Lawsuit, concerning the Permit continuations for 2019 and 2020.
20FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The factors to be balanced are:
(1) the private interest which will be affected; [and]
(2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest
through the procedures actually used, and the probablevalue, if any, of additional or alternative proceduralsafeguards; [against]
(3) the governmental interest, including the burden that
additional procedural safeguards would entail.

1. The interest Sierra Club sought to protect
before BLNR was a constitutionally protectedproperty interest.
A&B, EMI, and BLNR argue that Sierra Club did not have
a constitutionally protected property interest at issue beforeBLNR.
14  Sierra Club argues that its property interest is
"founded upon two independent sources of law: [a]rticle XIsection 9 of the state constitution and constitutionallyprotected public trust rights."
Article XI, section 9 of the Hawai #i Constitution
provides:
Each person has the right to a clean and healthful
environment, as defined by laws relating to environmental
quality, including control of pollution and conservation,
protection and enhancement of natural resources.  Any person
may enforce this right against any party, public or private,through appropriate legal proceedings, subject to reasonablelimitations and regulation as provided by law.
(Emphasis added.)  "Although a person's right to a clean and
healthful environment is vested pursuant to article XI,section 9, the right is defined by existing law relating to

environmental quality."  In re Application of Maui Elec. Co. , 141
Hawai#i 249, 261, 408 P.3d 1, 13 (2017).  Sierra Club argues that
HRS Chapters 171 (Public Lands, Management and Disposition of),343 (Environmental Impact Statements), and 205A (Coastal ZoneManagement) are the laws relating to environmental quality thatdefined its right to a clean and healthful environment at issuein the BLNR proceeding.
HRS Chapter 171.   Sierra Club cites HRS § 171-55 as a
law relating to environmental quality that defines the right
applicable here.
15  HRS § 171-55 (2011) provided:
Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the board of
land and natural resources may issue permits for thetemporary occupancy of state lands or an interest therein ona month-to-month basis by direct negotiation without publicauction, under conditions  and rent which will serve the best
interests of the State , subject, however, to those
restrictions as may from time to time be expressly imposed
by the board.  A permit on a month-to-month basis maycontinue for a period not to exceed one year from the dateof its issuance; provided that the board may allow thepermit to continue on a month-to-month basis for additionalone year periods.
(Emphasis added.)
A&B and EMI argue that HRS § 171-55 "does not reference
any environmental provision let alone define any right to a cleanand healthful environment."  But HRS § 171-55 requires that BLNRcontinue the Permits "under conditions . . . which will serve thebest interests of the State[.]"  That includes conditions thatensure a clean and healthful environment by controlling pollution
15Sierra Club also cites HRS § 171-58, but that statute doesn't
apply to BLNR's decisions to continue the Permits.  Carmichael , 150 Hawai #i at

and conserving, protecting, and enhancing natural resources. 
Haw. Const. art. XI, § 9.
The conditions BLNR placed on continuing the Permits
did just that: incorporation of the CWRM order prohibiting out-of-watershed diversions from streams listed as full restorationstreams; no water waste; compliance with CWRM's amended IIFS andall conditions required by CWRM's Amended IIFS decision; removalof diversions and fixing of pipe issues; trash cleanup from areascovered by the Permits; reporting on monthly amounts of waterused, stream flow restoration and artificial structure removalrequired by CWRM, and removal of trash, unused man-madestructures, equipment, and debris that serve no useful purpose;identification of forest reserve land to be removed from thelicense areas; and limiting the amount of water that could bediverted.  These conditions reflect some of the observations andconcerns expressed in the declarations submitted in support ofSierra Club's request for a contested case hearing.  HRS § 171-55— the law under which BLNR continued the Permits — is a lawrelating to environmental quality that defined Sierra Club'smembers' constitutional right to a clean and healthfulenvironment in the matter before BLNR.
HRS Chapter 343.   Sierra Club also relies upon the
Hawai#i Environmental Policy Act ( HEPA).  In Carmichael
 the
supreme court held that BLNR's authority to continue the Permits
was subject to HEPA's environmental review requirements.  150Hawai#i at 553, 506 P.3d at 217.  The supreme court did not hold
23FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
that an environmental assessment was required before the Permits 
could be continued; rather, it remanded the case to the circuitcourt to determine whether A&B's "actions" under the Permits areexempt from HEPA's environmental-review process under HRS § 343-6(a)(2) and related administrative rules.
16  Id. at 571, 506 P.3d
at 235.  HEPA is a law relating to environmental quality and,under Carmichael
, HEPA is also a law that defined Sierra Club's
members' constitutional right to a clean and healthfulenvironment in the matter before BLNR.
HRS Chapter 205A.   The Coastal Zone Management Law did
not provide authority for BLNR's continuation of the Permits. 
Sierra Club relies on HRS § 205A-4(b) (2017), which provides:
The objectives and policies of this chapter and any
guidelines enacted by the legislature shall be binding uponactions within the coastal zone management area by allagencies, within the scope of their authority.
BLNR is an "agency" for purposes of HRS Chapter 205A. 
See HRS § 205A-1 (2017).  BLNR is bound by the Coastal Zone
Management objectives and policies when, for example, itdetermines the shoreline under HRS § 205A-42, or establishes
16HRS § 343-6 (2010) provided:
(a)  After consultation with the affected agencies,
the [environmental advisory] council shall adopt, amend, orrepeal necessary rules for the purposes of this chapter inaccordance with chapter 91 including, but not limited to,rules that shall:

shoreline setbacks under HRS § 205A-43, or enforces its HRS
Chapter 183C conservation district rules under HRS § 205A-43.6(2017).  But HRS Chapter 205A did not provide authority for BLNRto continue the Permits.

Kahoma Ahupua #a Ass'n v. Maui Plan. Comm'n , 149 Hawai #i 304, 313,
489 P.3d 408, 417 (2021), it did not effect BLNR's authority tocontinue the Permits, and thus did not define Sierra Club'smembers' constitutional right to a clean and healthfulenvironment in the matter before BLNR.
The Public Trust.   Sierra Club argues that its property
right is also founded upon the public trust.  See
 Haw. Const.
art. XI, § 1.  Our courts have never held being a beneficiary ofthe public trust to be a cognizable property interest warrantingdue process protection.  See

Carmichael
 was a direct appeal from a lawsuit for declaratory and
injunctive relief; it was not a secondary appeal from an agencydecision, and the supreme court did not decide whether theplaintiffs in that case had a constitutionally protected propertyinterest under article XI, section 1 of the Hawai #i Constitution
or the public trust doctrine.  And in Ko #olau Agric. Co. v.
Comm'n on Water Res. Mgmt. , 83 Hawai #i 484, 495-96, 927 P.2d
1367, 1378-79 (1996), the supreme court held that a CWRM watermanagement area designation proceeding — which involved water, apublic trust natural resource — need not be conducted as acontested case.
We hold that HRS § 171-55 and HEPA are laws that
defined Sierra Club's constitutionally protected interest in aclean and healthful environment in the matter pending beforeBLNR.  Although those statutes defined Sierra Club's protectedinterest in the matter before BLNR, neither require a contestedcase when BLNR decides whether to renew a temporary revocablepermit under HRS § 171-55.  That distinguishes this case fromthose cited by Sierra Club, where contested cases were requiredby statute or rule.  That also distinguishes this case fromKilakila #O Haleakala
, cited by the dissent.

2. BLNR's procedures for the November 13, 2020

public meeting.  An agenda was published and material wasavailable to the public on DLNR's website before the meeting.  Alink to upload written testimony was provided.  An email addressto sign up to present oral testimony was provided.  Informationabout requesting a contested case hearing was provided.

Sierra Club also had an opportunity to be heard at a
meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.  It submitted writtentestimony and argument (as did many other stakeholders).  Theaudio recording of the meeting has over 18 minutes of oralargument by Sierra Club's attorney.  The portion of the meetingconcerning continuation of the Permits lasted over three hours. BLNR received over 13,000 pages of material about the Permitsfrom many sources, including Sierra Club.  DLNR and CWRMrepresentatives gave presentations.  BLNR heard oral testimonyfrom 14 people opposing and supporting the continuations.  BLNRconditioned continuation of the Permits upon A&B and EMIcomplying with several conditions, many of which addressed
28FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
concerns that had been expressed by Sierra Club.  Sierra Club's
members' constitutional property right to a clean and healthfulenvironment was reasonably protected.
Sierra Club argues that it was deprived of due process
because a contested case hearing would have allowed it to cross-examine witnesses.  As the dissent points out, a contested casehearing is similar in many respects to a trial before a judge. Mauna Kea Anaina Hou v. Bd. of Land and Nat. Res.
, 136 Hawai #i
376, 380, 363 P.3d 224, 228 (2015).  The 2019 Sierra Club Lawsuitwas tried during August and September 2020, just two monthsbefore the November 13, 2020 BLNR meeting.  Sierra Club could andshould have cross-examined witnesses during the trial, andincluded the information it obtained in its written and oralsubmissions to BLNR.  Sierra Club has not identified any otherfacts it would have been able to elicit during cross-examinationin a contested case hearing.
The dissent quotes the Environmental Court's findings
and conclusions that "the permits at issue covered the year afterthe trial" of the 2019 Sierra Club Lawsuit, and that Sierra Clubhad "new evidence on the permit renewals — information and issueswhich apparently arose after the trial."  Respectfully, if SierraClub obtained new information in the two months between the endof the trial and BLNR's meeting, it should have been included inits written and oral submissions to BLNR.  If the new informationwas obtained after BLNR's meeting, it could not have formed the
basis for Sierra Club's contested case hearing request.  The
29FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Environmental Court — which was sitting as an appellate court —
exceeded its statutory authority and acted outside of itsdiscretion if it considered information not in the record beforeBLNR.  HRS § 91–14(f) (Supp. 2016).
The short one-year duration of the continuations also
safeguard Sierra Club's ability to quickly present new issues,evidence, or arguments, or changing circumstances that couldaffect its members' ongoing interest in a clean and healthfulenvironment.  Information Sierra Club obtained after theNovember 13, 2020 BLNR meeting could have been presented to BLNRwhen it considered the next year's continuations.
18
On this record, we hold that BLNR's rules and
procedures for its November 13, 2020 meeting, Sierra Club'sparticipation in the 2020 trial of the 2019 Sierra Club Lawsuit,and the short duration of the Permit continuations providedreasonable protection from the risk of an erroneous deprivationof Sierra Club's members' protected interest in a clean andhealthful environment.

continuations was held in December 2021.  Sierra Club's secondary appeal fromBLNR's decision is pending as No. CAAP-24-0000082.
BLNR met on November 10, 2022, to consider continuing the Permits
for 2023.  Sierra Club again requested a contested case.  BLNR denied therequest.  BLNR approved continuing the Permits for 2023.  Sierra Clubappealed, resulting in 1CCV-22-0001506.  The Environmental Court remanded forBLNR to conduct a contested case hearing, and modified the conditions forcontinuation of the Permits.  A&B and EMI's appeal is docketed as No. CAAP-24-0000113.  BLNR's appeal is docketed as No. CAAP-24-0000114.

3. The governmental interests and burdens that a
contested case proceeding would entailoutweighed the marginal additional protectionit could provide to Sierra Club.
We must balance the interests of all parties when
deciding whether constitutional due process requires a contestedcase in any particular situation.  As to the governmentalinterests, we consider not only the State's administrative andfiscal burdens directly imposed by a contested case; we alsoconsider the burden and impact on the County, including itsability to provide water to communities served by its watersystems that rely on water diverted under the Permits.

Here, Sierra Club and theState completed a lengthy — and most likely expensive — trialover the Permit continuations for 2019 and 2020 just two monthsbefore BLNR met to consider the 2021 continuations.  This weighsagainst requiring the State to conduct a contested case hearingunder the circumstances of this case.

 was decided on March 3, 2022.  When BLNR met on
November 13, 2020, there was no statute, rule, or judicial precedent requiringthat BLNR make written findings to support decisions made during publicmeetings.  We note that for decisions made during a public meeting, ratherthan after a contested case hearing, BLNR could refer to its staff submittalsor other evidence in the meeting record to support its decision.  The meetingrecord and minutes should be sufficient for an appellate court to track theagency's steps.

A contested case on continuation of the Permits would
also place a burden on another government entity — the County —and on more than 35,000 people living and working in UpcountryMaui who rely on diverted water provided by the County'sDepartment of Water Supply.  The Permits authorized delivery of8.6 million gallons of water per day to County water treatmentfacilities that provide the majority of water to Upcountry Maui. Carmichael
, 150 Hawai #i at 553, 506 P.3d at 217.  The County's
Upcountry Water System serves the communities of Kula, Ha #ikū,
Makawao, Pukalani, H āli#imaile, Waiakoa, K ēōkea, Waiohuli,
#Ulupalakua, Kanaio, Olinda, Ōma#opio, Kula Kai, and P ūlehu.  By
2030, the population of these communities is expected to grow tomore than 43,000 people.  The County also provides water divertedunder the Permits to the Kula Agricultural Park, which contains31 farm lots ranging in size from 7 to 29 acres.  If a contestedcase on continuing the Permits is not concluded before thePermits expire, the County will have to devote significant timeand resources to provide tens of thousands of Maui residents withalternate access to water, with no guarantee of success.  BLNRfound, in the contested case on A&B and EMI's 2001 long-termwater lease application:
If Upcountry Maui's main source of water supply were
curtailed, the deficit could not be made up by otherportions of [the County]'s water system because theUpcountry system is separate and distinct from the watersystems serving other regions of Maui.  Cutting offUpcountry Maui's main public water supply completely wouldresult in a public health crisis and economic catastrophe .
33FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(Emphasis added.)  These burdens distinguish this case from
Davis, where the supreme court held that a hearing conducted
after the houseless plaintiffs' personal property was impounded,thus eliminating any further danger to public health and safety,"would not have significantly burdened the County."  ___ Hawai #i
at ___, ___ P.3d at ___, 2024 WL 934690, at *13.
Balancing the minimal additional protection a contested
case would have provided to Sierra Club under the circumstancesof this case against the annual fiscal and administrative burdensa contested case would impose on BLNR and the County (andpotentially on those living or working in Upcountry Maui), wehold that Sierra Club was not denied constitutional due processby BLNR's denial of its request for a contested case hearing. Sierra Club's members' interest in a clean and healthfulenvironment would be more appropriately addressed in the ongoingcontested case on A&B and EMI's 2001 long-term water leaseapplication, rather than an unnecessarily burdensome — andpotentially annual — contested case on the short-term Permits.
C. The Environmental Court erred by modifying
the conditions BLNR placed upon continuationof the Permits for 2021.
The Environmental Court cited HRS § 91-14(g) as
authority for its modification of BLNR's conditions forcontinuing the Permits for 2021.  HRS § 91-14(g) allows a circuitcourt to "modify the decision and order" of an agency in acontested case from which an appeal is taken.  The EnvironmentalCourt did not have jurisdiction over Sierra Club's appeal from
34FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
BLNR's decision to continue the Permits for 2021, because that 
decision was not made in a contested case and did not need to bemade after a contested case hearing.
Sierra Club argues that the Environmental Court had
equitable jurisdiction under HRS § 604A-2(b) to modify BLNR'sconditions.  The statute provides:
(a) The environmental courts shall have exclusive,
original jurisdiction over all proceedings, includingjudicial review of administrative proceedings . . .authorized under chapter 91, arising under . . . title 12;
  . . . .(b) In any case in which it has jurisdiction , the
environmental courts shall exercise general equity powers as
authorized by law.
HRS § 604A-2 (2016 & Supp. 2018) (emphasis added).
HRS Title 12 deals with Conservation and Resources and
includes HRS § 171-55.  The Environmental Court has exclusivejurisdiction over appeals from BLNR's decisions in contested
cases to continue temporary revocable permits under HRS § 171-55. 
But BLNR's decision to continue the Permits for 2021 was madeduring a public meeting, not a contested case hearing.  TheEnvironmental Court did not have equitable power to modify BLNR'sconditions because it did not have jurisdiction over SierraClub's appeal from BLNR's decision to continue the Permits.
The dissent cites the supreme court's statement in
Carmichael
 that on remand, "the circuit court should continue to
exercise its equitable power as it pertains to the municipal —and residential — water needs of the upcountry Maui community." 150 Hawai #i at 572, 506 P.3d at 236.  Carmichael
 was a civil
35FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
action for declaratory and injunctive relief over which the
circuit court had original jurisdiction.  That is why it wasauthorized, under HRS § 604A-2(b), to exercise equitable power.
Even if the Environmental Court had jurisdiction under
HRS § 91-14, the procedure it used to modify BLNR's conditionsexceeded its statutory authority.  Our government
is one in which the sovereign power is divided and allocated
among three co-equal branches.  Thus, we have taken theteachings of the Supreme Court to heart and adhered to thedoctrine that the use of judicial power to resolve publicdisputes in a system of government where there is aseparation of powers should be limited to those questionscapable of judicial resolution and presented in an adversarycontext.  And, we have admonished our judges that even inthe absence of constitutional restrictions, they must stillcarefully weigh the wisdom, efficacy, and timeliness of anexercise of their power before acting, especially where
there may be an intrusion into areas committed to other
branches of government .

Administrative agencies are part of the Executive
branch.  A circuit court reviewing an agency's final decision andorder in a contested case under HRS § 91-14 acts as an appellatecourt.  Diamond v. Dobbin
, 132 Hawai #i 9, 24, 319 P.3d 1017, 1032
(2014).  Its review is confined to the record that was before theagency.  HRS § 91–14(f).  It does not make findings of fact; itdetermines whether the agency's findings of fact were clearlyerroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantialevidence in the record.

138 Hawai #i 383, 395-96, 382 P.3d 195, 207-08 (2016).  Where
mixed questions of fact and law are presented, a circuit courtmust defer to an agency's expertise and experience in its fieldand must not substitute its judgment for that of the agency. Dole Haw. Div.-Castle & Cooke, Inc. v. Ramil
, 71 Haw.  419, 424,
794 P.2d 1115, 1118 (1990).  A court "cannot consider the weightof the evidence to ascertain whether it weighs in favor of theadministrative findings, or review the agency's findings of factby passing upon the credibility of witnesses or conflicts intestimony, especially the finding of an expert agency in dealingwith a specialized field."  Sierra Club v. D.R. Horton-Schuler
Homes, LLC , 136 Hawai #i 505, 522, 364 P.3d 213, 230 (2015)
(cleaned up).
If a circuit court concludes that additional evidence
is material to the agency's decision and there were good reasonswhy the parties did not present the evidence to the agency, itmay order that the evidence be presented to the agency , and allow
the agency to modify its findings, decision, and order.  HRS
§ 91–14(e) (2012).  It can then review the agency's modifiedfindings, conclusions, and decision and order, if necessary,under the appropriate appellate standards of review.
The Interim Decision stated that the Environmental
Court "has no record or briefing to objectively decide on anyspecific modification of the permits."  Yet, the Order ModifyingPermits made a finding that limiting the stream diversions "to no
more than 25 million gallons of water per day" "should be more
37FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
than enough water to allow all users the water they require,
while hopefully reducing apparent or potential waste."  TheEnvironmental Court in effect eliminated the 8.6 million gallonsof water per day diverted to the County for use by Upcountry Mauiresidents, plus 11.4 million more gallons per day, based on itsown findings of fact, and on information that was never presentedto BLNR.  The Environmental Court substituted its judgment forthat of BLNR, an expert agency dealing with a specialized field. In so doing, the court exceeded its authority under HRS § 91-14. See
 D.R. Horton-Schuler Homes, LLC , 136 Hawai #i at 522, 364 P.3d
at 230.
We hold that a circuit court's authority under HRS
§ 91-14(g) to modify an agency's decision and order in acontested case is limited to correcting conclusions of law thatwere wrong, either because the findings of fact upon which theconclusions were based were clearly erroneous, the wrong law wasapplied, or the right law was applied incorrectly.  The circuitcourt is not authorized to make its own findings of fact.  Nor isit authorized to substitute its judgment about the application ofpublic policy to the facts for that of the agency, which isconstitutionally delegated that power.
D. Sierra Club was not entitled to recover
attorneys fees or costs under the privateattorney general doctrine.
In Hawai #i litigants are responsible for their own
attorneys fees and costs unless an award is allowed by statute,court rule, agreement, stipulation, or precedent.  Sierra Club v.
38FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Haw. Dep't of Transp. , 120 Hawai #i 181, 218, 202 P.3d 1226, 1263
(2009) ( Superferry ).  One such precedent is the private attorney
general doctrine, upon which Sierra Club relied in both of its
motions for fees and costs.
Sierra Club correctly asserts that the private attorney
general doctrine
is an equitable rule that allows courts in their discretion
to award [attorney's] fees to plaintiffs who have vindicatedimportant public rights.  Courts applying this doctrineconsider three basic factors: (1) the strength or societalimportance of the public policy vindicated by thelitigation, (2) the necessity for private enforcement andthe magnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff,[sic] (3) the number of people standing to benefit from thedecision.
Superferry , 120 Hawa #i at 218, 202 P.3d at 1263.  In Superferry ,
Sierra Club was awarded attorneys fees because "Sierra Clubprevailed on the merits of the claim requiring preparation of an[environmental assessment] pursuant to HRS chapter 343" and was"responsible for establishing the principle of proceduralstanding in environmental law in Hawai #i and clarifying the
importance of addressing the secondary impacts of a project inthe environmental review process pursuant to HRS chapter 343." Id.
 at 217, 220, 202 P.3d at 1262, 1265.
In the other case cited by Sierra Club, Honolulu
Constr. & Draying Co. v. Dep't of Land & Nat. Res. , 130 Hawai #i
306, 310 P.3d 301 (2013) ( Irwin Park ), Scenic Hawai #i defeated
Aloha Tower Development Corporation's petition to expunge a
restriction in the State's deed for Irwin Park.  The supremecourt held that "an organization may seek to vindicate public
39FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
policy through litigation on discrete issues, so long as the
resolution of the litigation in favor of the organizationvindicates a public policy goal, and that policy satisfies thefirst prong of the test."  Id.
 at 315, 310 P.3d at 310.  The
important public policy goal vindicated in Irwin Park  was
"preserving public parks and historic sites."  Id.  
Sierra Club argues that it vindicated the important
public policy of requiring a contested case hearing before BLNRcould continue the Permits, and significantly reduced the amountof water A&B and EMI could divert under them.  Here we hold acontested case was not required before BLNR decided whether tocontinue the Permits for 2021, and the Environmental Court didnot have jurisdiction to modify the conditions BLNR imposed uponthe continuations.  Sierra Club did not vindicate any importantpublic policy.  It was not entitled to an award of attorneys feesor costs under the private attorney general doctrine.
We need not decide whether the Environmental Court
erred by denying BLNR's motion for entry of an appealablejudgment or for leave to file an interlocutory appeal.
IV. CONCLUSION
Sierra Club was not constitutionally entitled to a
contested case hearing under the circumstances presented here;the Environmental Court did not have jurisdiction over SierraClub's appeal from BLNR's decision to continue the Permits for2021 or to modify the conditions under which the Permits were
40FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

costs.

DISSENTING OPINION by Nakasone, J.  
While I agree with the Majority in Part III.B.I., I
respectfully dissent from the remainder of the Majority'sOpinion, as to the application of the second and third Sandy
Beach due process factors in Part III.B.2. and III.B.3., and as
to Part III.A. and III.C. regarding jurisdiction.  I would holdthat the Environmental Court did not err in concluding that acontested case hearing was required by due process under thespecific circumstances of this case, and that it had jurisdictionover Sierra Club's appeal of BLNR's decision to grant thecontinuation of the Permits and to modify the Permits.  Because Iwould affirm the Environmental Court on these issues, I alsodissent from Part III.D. (denying recovery of attorney's fees andcosts under the private attorney general doctrine). 
Due process required a contested case hearing .
Regarding the second Sandy Beach
 factor, evaluating
"the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest throughthe procedures actually used, and the probable value, if any, ofadditional or alternative procedural safeguards[,]" I would holdthat this factor weighed in favor of a contested case hearing. Sandy Beach Def. Fund v. City Council of City & Cnty. of
Honolulu , 70 Haw. 361, 378, 773 P.2d 250, 261 (1989).  Sierra
Club set forth the issues it sought to challenge in its petitionfor a contested case before BLNR.  While the November 13, 2020public meeting provided an opportunity for Sierra Club to beheard, this format did not permit a meaningful opportunity tochallenge the permit applicant by cross-examination of theapplicant's witnesses' testimony under oath.  There was risk oferroneous deprivation even though the duration of the Permits wasshort, where the Permits had been continued annually for twentyyears with no prior contested case hearing ever having beenconducted on the constitutional interests Sierra Club sought toprotect in this case.  
43FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
In Carmichael v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res. , the Hawai #i
Supreme Court explained that "when appraising the legislativehistory of Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) chapter 171 as a whole,
it is clear that BLNR's power to issue and continue revocable
permits under HRS § 171-55 was intended to be narrowlyexercised."  150 Hawai #i 547, 564, 506 P.3d 211, 228 (2022).  In
construing the "best interests of the State" language in HRS §171-55 (2011), the supreme court cautioned that BLNR performs asa public trustee of the State's water resources, and "is dutybound to demonstrate that it has properly exercised thediscretion vested in it by the constitution and the statute." Id.
 at 566, 506 P.3d at 230 (cleaned up).  
A contested case hearing is similar in many respects to a
trial before a judge: the parties have the right to presentevidence, testimony is taken under oath, and witnesses aresubject to cross-examination. It provides a high level ofprocedural fairness and protections to ensure that decisionsare made based on a factual record that is developed through
a rigorous adversarial process.
  
Mauna Kea Anaina Hou v. Bd. of Land &  Nat. Res. , 136 Hawai #i
376, 380, 363 P.3d 224, 228 (2015).  Given the significant amountof the public trust resource of water at issue, the importance ofSierra Club's asserted constitutionally protected interest, andthe substantive economic and environmental issues raised bySierra Club in its petition, the trial-like protections of acontested case hearing would guard against the risk of erroneousdeprivation.
  
Appellees Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. ( A&B) and East Maui
Company, Limited ( EMI) (collectively, Appellees ) and BLNR argued
below to the Environmental Court, and again in this appeal, that
Sierra Club already had the opportunity to litigate "virtuallyidentical" issues in the 2020 trial ( 2020 Trial ) on the 2019
Lawsuit.  I do not agree that Sierra Club's participation in the
2020 Trial was an adequate alternative procedural safeguard,where the Environmental Court judge, who was the same judge thatpresided over the 2020 Trial, specifically found otherwise.  See
Sandy Beach , 70 Haw. at 378, 773 P.2d at 261.  The Environmental
44FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Court found that this case involved "some significantly different
facts" from the 2020 Trial; that "the permits at issue coveredthe year after the trial" and "[t]hings change with time"; thatSierra Club had "new evidence on the permit renewals --information and issues which apparently arose after the trial";and that "[t]he new information and issues are relevant and arenot insignificant."  Finding of Fact ( FOF) 9, Conclusion of Law
(COL) 7.  While the parties disagree on the Environmental Court's
characterization of what issues or evidence were "new" or not, I
cannot conclude that this particular finding and mixedfactual/legal determination was clearly erroneous.  For thereasons above, I would conclude the second Sandy Beach
 factor
weighs in favor of a contested case hearing.     
Regarding the third Sandy Beach  factor on the
"governmental interest, including the burden that additionalprocedural safeguards would entail[,]" 70 Haw. at 378, 773 P.2dat 261, this case is distinguishable from Flores v. Bd. of Land &
Nat. Res. , 143 Hawai #i 114, 424 P.3d 469 (2018), upon which the
Appellees and BLNR rely.  In Flores , the supreme court held that
the petitioner was not entitled to a second contested casehearing on the Mauna Kea telescope sublease, when he had alreadyparticipated in a prior contested case hearing on the Mauna Keatelescope Conservation District Use Permit regarding the impactof telescope construction on his constitutionally protectedcultural rights.  Id.
 at 127-28, 424 P.3d at 482-83.  Here, the
specter of floodgates of contested case hearings creating annualfiscal and administrative burdens for every future water permitcontinuation is speculative and premature, since we cannotpresume that a contested case hearing will be requested in everysimilar case, or that BLNR would be required by due process togrant such in every case.  The concern over the possibility of anincrease in future contested case hearing requests is not a basisto deny a contested case hearing in this particular case.  Eachrequest must be evaluated under the Sandy Beach
 factors to
determine whether, under the particular context and circumstances
45FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
presented, due process requires a contested case hearing in that
case.  Flores , 143 Hawai #i at 126-27, 424 P.3d at 481-82.  Under
Flores, depending on the circumstances, if the interests in a
future contested case hearing "would appear to overlap entirely"with a previously conducted contested case hearing, then dueprocess would not mandate a repetitive hearing in light of the"duplicative administrative burden" on the State.  Id.
 at 127,
127 n.7, 424 P.3d at 482, 482 n.7.  Even when a hearing isgranted, the contested case hearing officer retains discretion to"avoid unnecessary or repetitive evidence" by "limit[ing] thenumber of witnesses, the extent of direct or cross examination orthe time for testimony upon a particular issue."  HAR § 13-1-32(h) (2009).  Finally, in light of Carmichael
's clarification
that BLNR must issue FOFs and COLs to support a "best interestsof the State" determination to grant a permit continuation underHRS § 171-55, 150 Hawai #i at 566-67, 506 P.3d at 230-31, and
because FOFs and COLs are also required in contested casehearings, see
 HRS § 91-12 (2012) and HAR § 13-1-38 (2009), I
would conclude that the administrative burden is not duplicative. For these reasons, I would conclude the third Sandy Beach
 factor
weighs in favor of a contested case hearing.
The Environmental Court had jurisdiction over
BLNR's decision to grant the Permits, and also had
jurisdiction to modify the Permits. 
I would hold that the Environmental Court had
jurisdiction over BLNR's decision to continue the Permits becauseboth the denial of the contested case hearing and BLNR'ssubsequent decision to grant the continuation of the Permitsconstitute a "final decision . . . in a contested case" thatqualifies for judicial review under HRS § 91-14(g) (2012 & 2022Supp.).  See
 Cmty. Ass'n of Hualalai, Inc. v. Leeward Plan.

(PASH), 79 Haw. 425, 431, 903 P.2d 1246, 1252 (1995)).  In
Hualalai , the Hawai #i Supreme Court explained that a "final
decision" under HRS § 91-14(g) "can take the form of an agency'sformal denial of a party's request for a contested casehearing[.]"  Id.
 (citing Kaleikini v. Thielen , 124 Hawai #i 1, 26,
237 P.3d 1067, 1092 (2010)).  "An agency's failure to deny orgrant a party's request for a contested case hearing followed byagency action that effectively ends the proceeding may alsoconstitute a final decision."  Id.

v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res. (Kilakila) , 131 Hawai #i 193, 202-03,
317 P.3d 27, 36-37 (2013)).  
Here, BLNR denied the request for a contested case,
then subsequently voted to grant the continuation of the Permits. In its appeal to the Environmental Court, the Sierra Clubrequested the Environmental Court reverse both of BLNR'sdecisions, i.e. the denial of contested case hearing and thegranting of the continuation of the Permits.  Similarly, thepetitioners in Kilakila
 appealed both BLNR's decision approving
the permit in that case and the lack of decision either grantingor denying the request for contested case hearing.  131 Hawai #i
at 202, 317 P.3d at 36.  The Kilakila
 court held that a contested
case hearing should have been held; vacated the circuit court'sorder granting the dismissal of the petitioners' appeal; and"remand[ed] to the circuit court for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion regarding [petitioners'] request forstay or reversal of the conservation district use permit grantedby BLNR . . . ."  Id.
 at 206, 317 P.3d at 40.  The circuit court
in Kilakila  had jurisdiction over BLNR's decision on the permit,
47FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
even though no contested case hearing had been held.  See  id.  In
addition, HRS § 91-14(i) further provides:  "[w]here a courtremands a matter to an agency for the purpose of conducting acontested case hearing, the court may reserve jurisdiction andappoint a master or monitor to ensure compliance with itsorders."  Thus, I would conclude that the Environmental Court hadjurisdiction over BLNR's decision to continue the Permits hereunder HRS § 91-14(g); and that the Environmental Court correctlyconcluded in COL 12 that it had jurisdiction to "reverse ormodify" BLNR's decision, where the denial of a contested casehearing had prejudiced Sierra Club's substantial rights.  See
 HRS
§ 91-14(g), (i); Kilakila , 131 Hawai #i at 202, 317 P.3d at 36. 
Because the Environmental Court had jurisdiction under
HRS § 91-14 and HRS § 604A-2(a) (2016 & 2022 Supp.), I would alsoconclude that it had equitable jurisdiction under HRS § 604A-2(b)'s mandate that the Environmental Court "shall exercisegeneral equity powers as authorized by law."
20  In lieu of
vacating the Permits, the Environmental Court modified them tolimit the amount of water diverted,
21 invoking its equity powers
to avoid "unintended consequences or chaos by vacating the[P]ermits" and to "not risk a vacuum which causes hardship tothose on Maui who rely on the water at issue."  See

Equityjurisprudence is flexible and adaptable to the situationpresented, allowing a court to "mold its decrees to do justiceamid all the vicissitudes and intricacies of life."  Fleming v.
