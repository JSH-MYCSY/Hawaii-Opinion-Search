appeal or other proceeding sign and file a stipulation for 
dismissal, specifying the terms as to payment of costs and" pay 
the fees that are due, "the case shall be dismissed upon 
approval by the appellate court"). 
Therefore, IT IS ORDERD that the Stipulation to 
Dismiss is approved and the appeal is dismissed with prejudice. The parties shall bear their own attorneys' fees and costs on 
appeal.
