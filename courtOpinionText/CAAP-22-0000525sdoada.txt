NO. CAAP-22-0000525 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
IN THE INTEREST OF JA 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(FC-S NO. 16-0029) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Hiraoka, JJ.) 
Respondent-Appellant Father (
Father), self-represented, 
appeals from an order denying his motion for post-decree relief 
(
Denial Order) filed in the Family Court of the Third Circuit 
(Family Court) on August 8, 2022.1 
On appeal, Father raises a single point of error: the 
Family Court erred by denying his motion for post-decree relief (Motion). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Father's point of error as follows, and affirm.
I. 
On April 7, 2016, Petitioner-Appellee Department of 
Human Services (DHS) filed a petition for temporary foster 
custody of Father's daughter, JA (Petition), which initiated the 
underlying case, FC-S No. 16-0029. 
1 The Honorable Jeffrey W. Ng presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On March 29, 2018, the Family Court entered an order 
that, among other things, awarded permanent custody of JA to DHS 
and terminated Father's parental rights (TPR Order). On May 23, 
2018, the Family Court entered an order revoking permanent 
custody and terminating jurisdiction in the underlying case because JA had been adopted. 
On August 4, 2022, Father filed his Motion seeking 
communication with JA. On August 8, 2022, the Family Court entered the Denial Order on the basis that the order terminating the case had been entered on May 23, 2018, and thus, the court no longer had jurisdiction in the matter.
II. 
"Whether a court possesses subject matter jurisdiction 
is a question of law reviewable de novo." Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 119 
Hawai#i 1, 4–5, 193 P.3d 839, 842–43 
(2008). 
III. 
Father asserts the Family Court erred in issuing the 
Denial Order because he has a right to communicate with JA based on: (1) DHS's service plan, (2) DHS's permanent plan, and (3) Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS
) § 571-46 (2018). Father's 
arguments lack merit.2 
First, the TPR Order terminated any existing service 
plan and cleared the path for JA's adoption. HRS § 587A-33(b) (2) (2018); HRS § 578-2(c)(1)(K) (2018) (providing that an adoption may occur without the consent of a parent "whose parental and custodial duties and rights have been divested by an award of permanent custody pursuant to section 587A-33"). 
Second, JA's adoption fulfilled DHS's permanent plan 
and extinguished any residual visitation interest retained by Father. HRS § 587A-32 (2018) (describing the goal of a permanent 
2 In his reply brief, Father expressly acknowledges that he is not
challenging the termination of his parental rights. As DHS asserts, this
court would not have appellate jurisdiction to review a challenge to the TPROrder, because it was issued on March 29, 2018, and this appeal would beuntimely as to that order.

plan as "adoption, legal guardianship, or permanent custody"); 
HRS § 578-16 (2018) (effect of adoption includes severing legal relationship between child and former parent upon adoption, and providing that child and adoptive parent(s) "shall sustain towards each other the legal relationship of parents and child and shall have all the rights and be subject to all the duties of that relationship"); see also In re Doe, 109 Hawai# i   399, 410, 
126 P.3d 1086, 1097 (2006) (providing that a parent's post-termination residual interest in visitation with their children "terminate[s] on the condition the children are adopted or reach the age of eighteen"); see also Willmott v. Decker, 56 Haw. 462, 464, 541 P.2d 13, 15 (1975) (providing that a decree of adoption terminates natural parent's rights, including those related to custody and visitation). 
Third, HRS § 571-46 pertains to custody of a child, 
which is not in dispute here given the TPR Order and JA's adoption, both of which are not challenged by Father.
3 Willmott, 
56 Haw. at 464, 541 P.2d at 15; HRS § 578-16. In the circumstances of this case, where Father's parental rights have been terminated, HRS § 571-46 does not apply. 
Thus, the Family Court appropriately determined that it 
lacked jurisdiction with respect to Father's motion for post-decree relief. HRS § 587A-4 (2018) (defining family, in relevant 
3 HRS § 571-46 provides, in relevant part: 
(a) In actions for divorce, separation, annulment, separate
maintenance, or any other proceeding where there is at issuea dispute as to the custody of a minor child, the court,during the pendency of the action, at the final hearing, orany time during the minority of the child, may make an orderfor the custody of the minor child as may seem necessary orproper. 
In awarding the custody, the court shall be guided
by the following standards, considerations, and procedures: 
. . . 
(7) Reasonable visitation rights shall be awarded to
parents, grandparents, siblings, and any personinterested in the welfare of the child in the discretion of the court, unless it is shown thatrights of visitation are detrimental to the bestinterests of the child .

part, as the legal parent of a child); HRS § 578-16(b) ("The 
former legal parent or parents of an adopted individual and any other former legal kindred shall not be considered to be related to the individual . . . ."). 
IV. 
For the reasons discussed above, we affirm the order 
denying Father's motion for post-decree relief, filed in the Family Court of the Third Circuit on August 8, 2022.
