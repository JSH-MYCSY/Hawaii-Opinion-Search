APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
NORTH AND SOUTH KONA DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 3DSD-22-0000001) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, and Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Petitioner-Appellant William D.A. Fears (Fears
) appeals 
from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Decision and Order 
Affirming Administrative Revocation and Dismissing Appeal (Decision and Order), entered on August 3, 2022, in the District 
Court of the Third Circuit, North and South Kona Division 
(District Court).
1/ The Decision and Order affirmed the decision 
of Respondent-Appellee Administrative Director of the Courts (Director), which in turn affirmed the decision of the 
Administrative Driver's License Revocation Office (ADLRO) 
revoking Fears's driver's license for a two-year period. 
For the reasons explained below, we reverse. 
I. Background 
On August 2, 2020, Fears was arrested for Operating a 
Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), pursuant to 
1/ The Honorable Jill M. Hasegawa presided.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2019). The 
arresting officer issued a Notice of Administrative Revocation of 
Fears's driver's license. 
On August 6, 2020, the ADLRO issued a Notice of 
Administrative Review Decision, which sustained the revocation of Fears's license for a two-year period from September 2, 2020, to September 1, 2022. The same day, Fears made a timely Request for an administrative hearing to dispute the revocation. 
The ADLRO scheduled the administrative hearing for 
August 20, 2020, to be held telephonically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
From August 20, 2020, through March 18, 2021, the 
ADLRO scheduled four telephonic hearings, all of which were continued when Fears objected to participating in a telephonic hearing and requested an in-person hearing on 
Hawai#i Island. 
On March 18, 2021, the hearing was continued to May 24, 2021. 
On April 20, 2021, the ADLRO's Chief Adjudicator 
emailed Fears's counsel and others, informing them that "[t]he ADLRO will reopen on May 3, 2021[,]" and "[e]ffective May 3, 2021, all hearings will be conducted by Zoom . . . ." 
The email 
recipients were further informed that "[i]f you request an in-person hearing, you must provide a reason why a Zoom hearing would be inadequate[,]" and "[a]ll requests will be reviewed by your Hearing Officer." 
On April 21, 2021, Fears's counsel "object[ed] to ADLRO 
hearings being conducted via video and request[ed] 'in person' hearings for all cases unless otherwise specified by our office." 
As to Fears, from May 24, 2021, through January 19, 
2022, the ADLRO scheduled five hearings to be held via Zoom, all of which were continued when Fears objected to participating in a Zoom hearing and requested an in-person hearing on 
Hawai#i 
Island. On January 19, 2022, the hearing was continued to February 24, 2022. 
On February 23, 2022, Fears filed a Motion to Rescind 
License Revocation for Failure to Conduct an Expeditious Hearing. He argued, among other things, that the use of Zoom and telephonic hearings deprived him of his due process rights. 
2  
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
On February 24, 2022, the hearing was held via Zoom as 
previously scheduled. Fears's motion to rescind was denied, and 
the ADLRO hearing officer proceeded with the hearing. Fears declined to participate in the hearing. He stated his "position that the Zoom hearings are illegal[,]" and "ask[ed] that the matter be concluded today so that we could . . . appeal the items." Fears further stated, "[W]e're not submitting that the revocation is appropriate here in any way." The hearing officer concluded the hearing and took the matter under advisement. 
On March 2, 2022, the Director, through the hearing 
officer, issued a Notice of Administrative Hearing Decision, which affirmed the ADLRO's August 6, 2020 Notice of Administrative Review Decision and amended the revocation end date to March 18, 2023.
2/ The hearing officer's Decision (ADLRO 
Decision) was also issued on March 2, 2022. The hearing officer 
concluded in relevant part that "[t]he intent of HRS § [2]91E-
38(b)3/ was to assure Respondent's ability to attend a hearing 'as 
close to the location where the notice of administrative revocation was issued as practical[.]'" (Footnote added.) The 
2/ The revocation end date was so amended to reflect the extension of 
Fears's temporary driver's permit from September 2, 2020, to March 18, 2021.
Although the revocation end date was March 18, 2023, the "capable ofrepetition, yet evading review" exception to the mootness doctrine applies tothis appeal. See Slupecki v. Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 110 Hawai #i 407, 409
n.4, 133 P.3d 1199, 1201 n.4 (2006). 
3/ HRS § 291E-38 (Supp. 2019) provides, in relevant part: 
Administrative hearing; procedure; decision.  (a) If the
director administratively revokes the respondent's license
and privilege to operate a vehicle after the administrativereview, the respondent may request an administrative hearingto review the decision within six days of the date theadministrative review decision is mailed. If the requestfor hearing is received by the director within six days ofthe date the decision is mailed, the hearing shall bescheduled to commence no later than: 
(1) Twenty-five days from the date the notice ofadministrative revocation was issued in a case involving an alcohol related offense[.] 
. . . . 
The director may continue the hearing only as provided insubsection (j). 
(b)
 The hearing shall be held at a place designated by
the director, as close to the location where the notice ofadministrative revocation was issued as practical. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
hearing officer reasoned: 
The plain language of the statute makes no mention of
whether the hearing need be in person, telephonic, or by
Zoom. In fact, a Zoom hearing clearly satisfies the plainmeaning of the statute, as it is held at a place as close tothe location where the notice of administrative revocation was issued. Most often, a Zoom hearing is held in theRespondent's home in the county where the administrativerevocation was issued. The statute does not account for the fact that the hearing can actually take place in multiplelocations due to the advancement of technology. During theCOVID pandemic, Zoom hearings became more than just what wasdeemed "practical"; Zoom hearings became a vital necessityto protect the health and safety of all parties. 
The hearing officer further determined that there was reasonable 
suspicion to stop Fears, there was probable cause to arrest him, and "[t]he evidence prove[d] by a preponderance" that Fears operated a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant. 
On March 22, 2022, Fears filed a Petition for Judicial 
Review (Petition) in the District Court, requesting that the 
court reverse the ADLRO Decision. Fears contended that "(1) the 
ADLRO did not have the authority to conduct hearings via telephone or other electronic means, (2) even if the ADLRO did have authority to conduct hearings via telephone or other electronic means, those procedures d[id] not satisfy due process, and (3) the ADLRO did not have good cause to support nine continuances, thereby denying [Fears] an expeditious hearing." 
The District Court heard the Petition on May 3, 2022, 
and entered the Decision and Order on August 3, 2022. In affirming the ADLRO Decision, the court concluded in part: 
4. HRS § 291E-38 grants [the Director] the
authority to designate a location that is a[s] close  as 
practical to the location where the notice of administrative 
revocation was issued. 
5. Under the circumstances present in this case,
Zoom hearings were practical during the majority of time
that Petitioner's case was pending. 
6. [The Director] did not violate [Fears's] due
process rights by holding a Zoom, rather than in-person,hearing. 
7. By interpreting HRS § 291E-38's provisions to
allow Zoom, rather than in-person, hearings during theCOVID-19 Pandemic: 
a. [The Director] did not exceedconstitutional or statutory authority; 
4   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
b. [The Director] did not erroneously
interpret the law; 
c. [The Director] did not act in an arbitraryor capricious manner; 
d. [The Director] did not commit an abuse ofdiscretion; and 
e. [The Director] did not make adetermination that was unsupported by theevidence in the record. 
The District Court further concluded that "[Fears] waived any 
argument or objection that could have been raised regarding the existence of facts sufficient to support the conclusion that [Fears] committed OVUII[.]" 
This secondary appeal followed. Fears contends that 
the District Court erred: (1) "in holding that the ADLRO had the authority to conduct administrative revocation hearings via Zoom"; and (2) in affirming the revocation of Fears's license, "where the ADLRO violated his right to an expeditious hearing." 
II. Discussion 
Our review of the District Court's Decision and Order 
is a secondary appeal; we must determine whether the District Court was right or wrong in its review of the ADLRO Decision. Wolcott v. Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 148 Hawai# i 407, 413, 477 
P.3d 847, 853 (2020) (quoting Freitas v. Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 108 Hawai# i 31, 43, 116 P.3d 673, 685 (2005)). In turn, 
"HRS § 291E–40
4/ governs judicial review by the district court of 
4/ HRS § 291E–40 (2007) provides, in relevant part: 
(c) The sole issues before the court shall be 
whether the director: 
(1) Exceeded constitutional or statutory authority; 
(2) Erroneously interpreted the law; 
(3) Acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner; 
(4) Committed an abuse of discretion; or 
(5) Made a determination that was unsupported by the
evidence in the record. 
(d) The court shall not remand the matter back to 
the director for further proceedings consistent with itsorder. 
5   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
an administrative revocation of a driver's license by the 
Director." Id. (bracketed material omitted; footnote number 
altered) (quoting Freitas, 108 Hawai# i at 43, 116 P.3d at 685). 
As to Fears's first point of error, he argues that the 
District Court erred in affirming the ADLRO Decision under HRS § 291E-40, where the ADLRO had no authority to conduct administrative revocation hearings via Zoom and "did so in derogation of Fears's [constitutional] right to due process." Relatedly, Fears contends that he had "a due process right to an in-person hearing on his license revocation[.]" 
Fears's statutory argument — that HRS § 291E-38 did not 
authorize the ADLRO to conduct the February 24, 2022 hearing via Zoom — is dispositive. "The interpretation of a statue is a question of law that this court reviews de novo." Farmer v. 
Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 94 Hawai# i 232, 236, 11 P.3d 457, 461 
(2000) (citing Konno v. Cnty. of Hawai# i, 85 Hawai# i 61, 71, 937 
P.2d 397, 407 (1997)). 
Moreover, where the language of the statute is plain and
unambiguous, our only duty is to give effect to its plainand obvious meaning. When construing a statute, ourforemost obligation is to ascertain and give effect to theintention of the legislature, which is to be obtainedprimarily from the language contained in the statute itself.And we must read statutory language in the context of theentire statute and construe it in a manner consistent with its purpose. 
Id. (quoting Konno , 85 Hawai#i at 71, 937 P.2d at 407). 
HRS § 291E-38(b) provides that the administrative 
hearing to review the director's revocation of a driver's license 
"shall be held at a place designated by the director, as close to the location where the notice of administrative revocation was issued as practical." 
Because HRS chapter 291E does not define 
"place" or "location," we turn to their common definitions. See 
HRS § 1-14; Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Omiya
, 142 Hawai#i 439, 
449–50, 420 P.3d 370, 380–81 (2018). Merriam-Webster provides multiple definitions of "place," the first and seemingly most relevant being "physical environment: SPACE." 
Place
, Merriam-
Webster Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/ dictionary/place. "Location" is defined in the first instance as "a position or site occupied or available for occupancy or marked 
6   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
by some distinguishing feature: SITUATION." Location, Merriam-
Webster Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/ 
dictionary/location. In context with the term "location," the term "place" in HRS § 291E-38(b) refers to a physical space or site, meaning that the administrative review hearing must be held at a physical space or site designated by the director, "as close to the [site] where the notice of administrative revocation was issued as practical." Thus, the plain language of HRS § 291E-38(b) does not authorize the director to designate the place of an administrative review hearing as two or more remote locations connected via videoconference or other electronic means.
5/ 
The Director, relying on the phrase "as practical," 
argues that "[t]he location requirement is not one of absolutes, but of practicality." Practicality is not a substitute for statutory authorization. Here, the operative terms of HRS § 291E-38(b) contemplate a physical space or site for the administrative review hearing. The Director further argues that the legislature amended HRS § 291E-38(b) as recently as 2021, but chose not to add a requirement that all hearings be conducted in-person. This fact actually works against the Director's position, given the plain language of the existing statute. See supra note 3. That said, during a defined period of the COVID-19 
pandemic, the Governor suspended certain laws pursuant to statutory authority. As relevant here, on April 25, 2020, the 
5/ Indeed, the ADLRO hearing officer appeared to acknowledge this
plain language reading of the statute, as follows: "The statute does not 
account for the fact that the hearing can actually take place in multiplelocations due to the advancement of technology." 
Had the legislature intended, it could have expressly provided for
such hearings to be held via videoconference or other electronic means. See, 
e.g., Lanai Co. v. Land Use Comm'n
, 105 Hawai #i 296, 318, 97 P.3d 372, 394
(2004) ("If the legislature intended to grant the LUC enforcement powers, itcould have expressly provided the LUC with such power."); 
Morgan v. Plan.
Dep't, Cnty. of Kauai
, 104 Hawai #i 173, 188, 86 P.3d 982, 997 (2004) (ruling
that if the legislature had intended to grant the commission injunctivepowers, it would have done so expressly). For example, HRS § 291E-38(g)expressly gives the director discretion to allow certain witnesses who cannotappear at the administrative review hearing to testify by telephone. 
See
 HRS 
§ 291E-38(g) ("If the officer or other person cannot appear, the officer orother person at the discretion of the director, may testify by telephone.")No similar provision permits the director to designate the place of thehearing as multiple locations connected via videoconference or otherelectronic means.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Governor issued the Sixth Supplementary Proclamation Amending and Restating Prior Proclamations and Executive Orders Related to the COVID-19 Emergency (Sixth Supplementary Proclamation), which 
suspended HRS chapter 91, administrative procedure, and further 
stated: 
Administrative hearings not subject to Chapter 91,6/ to the 
extent necessary such that, at the sole discretion of the
department o[r] agency, any such hearing may be conducted bytelephone or video conference without the parties,department, or agency, being physically present in the samelocation; any deadlines may be waived or suspended; and anyhearing procedures, such as, but not limited to,conferences, filing of documents, or service, may be donevia telephone or email. 
Sixth Supplementary Proclamation 17, (footnote added), https:// 
dod.hawaii.gov/hiema/sixth-supplementary-proclamation/; see  
Kernan v. Tanaka, 75 Haw. 1, 28 n.15, 856 P.2d 1207, 1221 n.15 (1993) (describing ADLRO as an "administrative agency"). The  
above quoted language was restated periodically through the  
issuance of the Governor's Twenty-First Proclamation Related to  
the COVID-19 Emergency (Twenty-First Proclamation), dated June 7,  
2021. Twenty-First Proclamation, https://governorige.hawaii.gov/ gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2106080-ATG_21st-Emergency-Proclam  
ation-for-COVID-19-distribution-signed.pdf. The Twenty-First  
Proclamation remained in effect through August 6, 2021. Id. at  
35.  Thus, it appears that ADLRO hearings conducted by video 
conference, i.e., Zoom, during the period from April 25, 2020, 
through August 6, 2021, were authorized pursuant to the  
Governor's applicable emergency proclamations. 
Here, however, neither the Governor's emergency 
proclamations nor HRS § 291E-38 authorized the ADLRO to conduct the February 24, 2022 administrative review hearing in multiple locations via Zoom, when Fears objected to this procedure. The Director therefore erred in concluding that the ADLRO was authorized to conduct the February 24, 2022 hearing via Zoom. 
6/ ADLRO hearings are not subject to HRS chapter 91. See HRS § 291E-
43 (2007) ("Neither the administrative review nor the administrative hearing
provided under this part shall be subject to the contested case requirementsof chapter 91."). 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
We need not address Fears's other arguments regarding 
the deficiencies of the ADLRO Decision and the District Court's 
Decision and Order. See Villarreal v. Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 
No. CAAP-18-0000622, 2021 WL 1986560, at *3 (Haw. App. May 18, 2021) (SDO) (reversing a district court order affirming the administrative revocation of a driver's license where the ADLRO hearing officer exceeded statutory authority and erroneously interpreted the law). 
For the reasons discussed above, the Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law, Decision and Order Affirming Administrative Revocation and Dismissing Appeal, entered on August 3, 2022, in the District Court of the Third Circuit, North and South Kona Division, is reversed.
