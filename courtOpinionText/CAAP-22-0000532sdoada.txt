APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC171001439) 
 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Nakasone and Guidry, JJ.) 
This appeal arises out of an order confirming a 
foreclosure sale. 
We affirm. 
Self-represented Defendant-Appellant William Halemano 
Frederick (Frederick) appeals from the Circuit Court of the           
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
    
 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
First Circuit's (Circuit Court)1 August 7, 2022 "Order Approving 
Commissioner's Report and Granting [Plaintiff-Appellee MTGLQ 
Investors, L.P. (MTGLQ)]'s Motion for Confirmation of 
Foreclosure Sale, Allowance of Costs, Commissions and Fees, 
Distribution of Proceeds, Directing Conveyance and for Writ of 
Possession/Ejectments, Filed May 12, 2022" (Confirmation Order) 
and Judgment. 
Frederick's Opening Brief is difficult to follow, does 
not contain points of error, and fails to comply with Hawai‘i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP
) Rule 28 in multiple 
respects. See HRAP Rule 28 (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(5), 
(b)(7), (b)(9). We liberally interpret pleadings prepared by 
self-represented parties to promote access to justice despite 
their non-compliance with court rules, to the extent their 
arguments can reasonably be discerned. See Erum v. Llego, 
147 Hawai‘i 368, 380-81, 465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020); Wagner v. 
World Botanical Gardens, Inc., 126 Hawai‘i 190, 193, 268 P.3d 
443, 446 (App. 2011). Frederick's Opening Brief, however, does 
not set forth discernible legal argument challenging the 
Confirmation Order or Judgment, and the arguments that are 
somewhat discernible are not supported by citations to relevant 
authority. 
The record also reflects that Frederick did not file 
an opposition to MTGLQ's Motion to Confirm Sale, and his 
challenge on appeal to the Order Confirming Sale is waived. 
See
Cnty. of Hawai‘i v. C & J Coupe Fam. Ltd. P'ship, 119 Hawai‘i 352, 
373, 198 P.3d 615, 636 (2008) ("Generally, the failure to raise 
an issue at the trial level precludes a party from raising that 
issue on appeal." (citation omitted)).

Further, to the extent that Frederick's Opening Brief 
purports to challenge the Circuit Court's July 19, 2023 order 
dismissing his June 2, 2022 "Bill of Complaint," Frederick did 
not give notice of such in his September 6, 2022 Notice of 
Appeal, and the Circuit Court's July 19, 2023 order and judgment 
granting MTGLQ's motion to dismiss are not included in the 
Record on Appeal. See HRAP Rule 3(c)(2) ("The notice of appeal 
shall designate the judgment, order, or part thereof and the 
court or agency appealed from."). This court also lacks 
jurisdiction to review the dismissal of the Bill of Complaint, 
which is not unique to the confirmation of sale proceeding. See
HawaiiUSA Fed. Credit Union v. Monalim, 147 
Hawai‘i 33, 41, 
464 P.3d 821, 829 (2020) (noting that an appeal under Hawaii 
Revised Statutes § 667-51(a)(2) (2016) from a Hawai‘i Rules of 
Civil Procedure Rule 54(b) judgment on an order confirming a 
foreclosure sale brings up for review issues "'unique' to the 
confirmation of sale"). 
For the foregoing reasons, the Confirmation Order and 
Judgment, both filed and entered on August 7, 2022 by the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit, are affirmed.
