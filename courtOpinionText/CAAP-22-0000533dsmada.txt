APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
(CASE NO. AB 2018-123; DCD NO. 4-15-10033)  
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By: Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Claimants-Appellants-Appellees 
Kimo I. Jardin and Survivors of Kimo I. Jardin's (
Jardin Parties) 
January 27, 2023 Motion to Dismiss Appeal for Lack of 
Jurisdiction (Motion), the papers in support and in opposition, 
and the record, it appears that the Jardin Parties seek dismissal 
of the appeal on the basis that the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board's (LIRAB) July 6, 2022 Proposed Decision 
and Order and August 9, 2022 Order Adopting Proposed Decision and 
Order (together, Orders) appealed from are not final, appealable 
orders because they determine that the underlying claims are 
compensable, but they do not determine the amount of compensation. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
An aggrieved party may appeal from a final decision and 
order by the LIRAB directly to this court under Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) §§ 386-88 (2015) and 91-14 (2012). For purposes 
of HRS § 91-14(a), "final order" means "an order ending the 
proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished[;] . . . Consequently, an order is not final if the rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the matter is retained for further action." Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. Ctr. for Women & 
Child., 89 Hawai# i 436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) (cleaned 
up). 
Thus, a LIRAB decision merely "finding a workers' 
compensation claim to be compensable [is] not an appealable final order because the amount of compensation ha[s] yet to be determined." Id. (citing 
Williams v. Kleenco, 2 Haw. App. 219, 
629 P.2d 125 (1981)). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
granted, and appellate case No. CAAP-22-0000533 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
