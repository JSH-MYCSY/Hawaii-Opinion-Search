IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MATTHEW DAVIDSON, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 5CPC-21-0000019) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellant Matthew Davidson's 
(Davidson
) appeal from the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit's 
August 9, 2022 Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence because Davidson does not appeal from a final order or judgment,and the circuit court has not otherwise entered a final, appealable order or judgment in the underlying proceeding.  
Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 641-11 (2016); State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai
#i 482, 492, 403 P.3d 259, 269 (2017). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.1 
1 On January 16, 2023, Davidson filed a Motion for Leave to Withdraw
Appeal or for Dismissal of Appeal Without Prejudice, but the motion is not
supported by an affidavit or declaration by Davidson that reflects a knowing,intelligent, and voluntary understanding of the consequences of dismissal ofthe appeal, as required by Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 42(c). 
Moreover, because it appears that attorney Kai Lawrence has not beensubstituted in to represent Davidson in the Circuit Court and the recordindicates Davidson is represented by Shaylene Iseri, Esq. in the underlyingcase, 5CPC-21-0000019, the circuit court may wish to clarify who representsDavidson going forward.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerk shall 
serve a copy of this order on the clerk of the Circuit Court of 
the Fifth Circuit.
