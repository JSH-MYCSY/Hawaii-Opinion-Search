APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC980005371) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Nakasone and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the Motion to Dismiss for Lack of 
Jurisdiction (M
otion), filed on September 23, 2022, by Appellee 
Liquidating Receiver S. Steven Sofos (Receiver), the papers in 
support and in opposition, the record here and in 1CC980005371, 
it appears that we lack appellate jurisdiction over self-
represented Defendant-Appellant Alexander Y. Marn's (Alexander) 
appeal from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (circuit 
court) "Order Denying [Alexander's] Expedited Motion for Stay 
Pending Appeal Under HRCP Rule 62 Without Bond or, in the 1
1 We take judicial notice of court records in 1CC980005371.  Hawai #i 
Rules of Evidence Rule 201; see State v. Akana, 68 Haw. 164, 165, 706 P.2d
1300, 1302 (1985) ("The most frequent use of judicial notice of ascertainablefacts is in noticing the contents of court records."). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Alternative, for Stay with Set Bond Amount," filed on July 19, 
2022 (Denial Order). 
On October 25, 2010, the circuit court entered a final, 
appealable, Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(b)-
certified Partial Final Judgment (Judgment), resolving some but 
not all claims in the April 30, 2001 First Amended Complaint 
filed in 1CC980005371.  Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1 
(2016); HRCP Rule 54; Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 
76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).  In the 
Judgment, the circuit court expressly retained jurisdiction "in connection with the management and disposition of the remaining assets of [Defendant-Appellee McCully Associates (
McCully)], 
including the McCully Shopping Center and other assets, the winding up of [McCully] and [Defendant-Appellee Ala Wai Investment, Inc. (Ala Wai)], distribution and the adjudication of 
such collateral issues relating to fee requests and tax matters." 
The circuit court has not subsequently entered a final judgment on these remaining issues. 
The Denial Order denied Alexander's request for a stay 
of enforcement of the circuit court's December 20, 2021 "Order Granting [Receiver]'s Motion to Approve (1) Fourth Amended Distribution Analysis; (2) Distribution of Partner Capital Accounts; and (3) Establishing Procedure for Terminating Receivership and Discharging Receiver, Filed October, 22, 2021" (12/20/21 Order
) and its December 27, 2021 "Order Granting 
Liquidating Receiver's 65th Application for Approval and Payment of Fees and Costs for the Receiver and His Professionals for the Period From October/November 2020 Through October 2021, Filed November 19, 2021" (12/27/21 Order).  The Denial Order is not 
itself a final appealable order or judgment under HRS ยง 641-1(a) 
(2016), and though it disposes of a request for a stay of the 12/20/21 Order and 12/27/21 Order, those orders pertain to the winding up of McCully and Ala Wai, which, as discussed, have not been resolved in a final, appealable judgment.  See Bailey v. Duvauchelle, 135 Hawai# i 482, 491, 353 P.3d 1024, 1033 (2015). 
Moreover, the circuit court expressly denied Alexander's request for HRCP Rule 54(b) certification in the Denial Order, and it has 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not granted him leave to file an interlocutory appeal under HRS 
ยง 641-1(b).  Accordingly, the Denial Order is not a final appealable order. 
Further, the Denial Order is not independently 
appealable under the collateral-order doctrine or the Forgay doctrine.
2  See Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai# i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 
832, 836 (2016) (setting forth the requirements for appealability under the collateral-order doctrine and the Forgay doctrine).  
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
granted and the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.
