Hawai#i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 3(a); 
(2)
 On October 6, 2022, the Chief Clerk of the Board 
notified Appellant that payment of appellate filing fees are required under HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), and that if Appellant did not pay the fees or obtain an order allowing Appellant to proceed in forma pauperis, the record on appeal would not be prepared; 
(3) On October 20, 2022, the Board extended the 
deadline for Appellant to file a Motion for Leave to Proceed on Appeal In Forma Pauperis to November 1, 2022; 
(4) The appellate record does not indicate that 
Appellant filed here or with the Board a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis; NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(5) On November 14, 2022, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Appellant that the 
time to docket the appeal had expired, Appellant had not paid the filing fee or obtained an order allowing Appellant to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis, the matter would be brought to the court's attention on November 25, 2022, for action that may include dismissal of the appeal, and Appellant could seek relief from default by motion; 
(6) Appellant has not taken any further action in this 
appeal; and 
(7) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to proceed in forma pauperis. HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
