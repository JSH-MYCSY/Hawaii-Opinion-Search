APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CCV-19-0002305) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Troy Darny sued Nordic PCL Construction, Inc. and Waiea 
Management Development Company, LLC for negligently causing him 
personal injury. The Circuit Court of the First Circuit 
dismissed the claims based on the statute of limitations.  Darny 
appeals from the June 23, 2023 Final Judgment. We affirm. 
1
Darny sued Waiea on December 12, 2019. Waiea developed 
a condominium. On November 23, 2016, Darny was riding in the bed 
of a pickup truck, with a large box, being driven in the 
condominium's parking structure. The driver negligently caused

"the top of the box to strike something in the parking structure, 
and fall onto [Darny], pinning him between the box and the 
tailgate." 
Darny amended his complaint on June 25, 2020. The 
amended complaint alleged the pickup truck's driver worked for 
the condominium's unit owners association (AOUO), and added the 
AOUO as a defendant. A claim that the parking structure was 
negligently designed and constructed was also added. Darny 
settled with the AOUO and it was dismissed from the lawsuit. The 
driver was never named as a defendant. 
Nordic was identified as a defendant on March 29, 
2022.
2  It moved to dismiss based on the statute of limitations. 
Waiea joined in the motion. The order granting the motion and 
joinder was entered on August 29, 2022. Darny appealed. The 
circuit court entered the Final Judgment on a temporary remand. 
Darny contends the circuit court erred by granting 
Nordic's motion to dismiss because it applied the wrong statute 
of limitations. 
Darny's opposition to Nordic's motion included 
matters outside the pleadings not excluded by the circuit court. 
We apply the standard of review for summary judgments. 
Hawai#i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 12(b). 
We review a circuit court's grant of summary judgment 
de novo using the same standard applied by the circuit court. 
Hays v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu
, 81 Hawai#i 391, 392, 917 P.2d 
718, 719 (1996). Summary judgment is appropriate if the record 
shows there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the 
moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. 
Id. 
at 392-93, 917 P.2d 719-20. 
Nordic's motion to dismiss was based on the Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS
) §§ 657-73 and 657-84 two-year statutes of 
2 WCIT Architecture, Inc. was also identified as a defendant, but
was dismissed by notice filed on June 3, 2022. 
3 HRS § 657-7 (2016) provides:

limitations. During the hearing on Nordic's motion the circuit 
court stated: 
The Court is going to find that plaintiff did not commence
this action against defendants Nordic Construction and Waiea
Management within the two-year statute of limitations under
HRS Section 657-8. 
The plaintiff's injury occurred on November 23rd,
2016. The complaint was not filed until December 12th,
2019, well over two years after the accident. 
A statute of limitations begins to run when the 
plaintiff's cause of action accrues. HRS §§ 657-7, -8. Darny's 
tort claim accrued when he discovered (or should have discovered) 
the negligent act, the damage, and the causal connection between 
the two. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Newtown Meadows v. Venture 
15, Inc., 115 Hawai#i 232, 277, 167 P.3d 225, 270 (2007) (citing 
Yamaguchi v. Queen's Med. Ctr., 65 Haw. 84, 90, 648 P.2d 689, 
693–94 (1982). He needed only factual knowledge of the elements 
of an actionable claim; legal knowledge of a defendant's 
negligence is not required. Id. (citing Buck v. Miles, 89 
Hawai#i 244, 249–50, 971 P.2d 717, 722–23 (1999)). 
Lack of knowledge of the identity of the proper 
defendant does not delay the accrual of a claim. Russell v. 
Attco, Inc., 82 Hawai#i 461, 463–65, 923 P.2d 403, 405–07 (1996). 
The way to preserve a claim against an unidentified defendant is 
through HRCP Rule 17(d) ("Unidentified Defendant"). 
Id. at 466, 
923 P.2d at 408 (citing Tobosa v. Owens, 69 Haw. 305, 312–13, 741 
P.2d 1280, 1285 (1987)).

Actions for the recovery of compensation for damage or
injury to persons . . . shall be instituted within two years
after the cause of action accrued, and not after[.] 
4 HRS § 657-8(a) (2016) provides: 
No action to recover damages for . . . bodily injury . . .
arising out of any deficiency or neglect in the planning,
design, construction, supervision and administering of
construction, and observation of construction relating to an
improvement to real property shall be commenced more than
two years after the cause of action has accrued[.]

NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Darny does not argue that his claims against 
Nordic and Waiea did not accrue on the date he was injured. He 
argues he was injured in a motor vehicle accident,5 to which HRS 
§ 431:10C-315(b)(3) applied. 
HRS § 431:10C-315 (2019) provides, in relevant part: 
(b) No suit arising out of a motor vehicle accident
shall be brought in tort more than the later of: 
. . . . 
(3) Two years after the date of the last payment of
workers' compensation or public assistance
benefits arising from the motor vehicle
accident. 
Darny submitted a letter from his employer's workers 
compensation insurer stating that "the last medical payment was 
made on 10/12/21 and the final settlement check paid to Troy 
Darny was made on 09/20/19." Thus, the HRS § 431:10C-315(b)(3) 
statute of limitations would not expire until October 12, 2023. 
Darny's complaint was filed on December 12, 2019, within the 
limitations period. 
Darny's opening brief states: "This is a personal 
injury case combining a Motor Vehicle Accident, a Workers' 
Compensation claim, and a Construction Defect." Different claims 
for relief arising from one incident may be pleaded together. 
HRCP Rule 18(a). But if two or more claims arise from an 
incident, different statutes of limitation could apply to each 
claim. Au v. Au, 63 Haw. 210, 214, 626 P.2d 173, 177 (1981). 
The nature of the claim asserted determines the relevant 
limitations period. Id. 
HRS Chapter 431 Article 10C is the Hawai#i Motor 
Vehicle Insurance Law. HRS § 431:10C-101. It has three 
purposes: (1) create a system of reparations for accidental harm 
and loss arising from motor vehicle accidents; (2) compensate 
5 "Motor vehicle accident" means "an accident arising out of the
operation, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle, including an object drawn
or propelled by a motor vehicle." HRS § 431:10C-103 (2019). 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
these damages without regard to fault; and (3) limit tort 
liability for these accidents. HRS § 431:10C-102 (2019). 
An important component of the Motor Vehicle Insurance 
Law is the abolition of tort liability. Under HRS § 431:10C-306 
(2019), tort liability of an "[o]wner, operator, or user of an 
insured motor vehicle" is abolished, unless the injured person 
receives $5,000 or more in personal injury protection benefits or 
its equivalent. To calculate that amount: 
(A) The following shall be included: 
(i) Personal injury protection benefits incurred by,
paid to or payable to, or on behalf of, an
eligible injured person including amounts paid
directly by or on behalf of the eligible insured
because of the accidental harm or similar 
benefits under . . . worker's compensation[.] 
HRS § 431:10C-306(b)(4) (2019). 
The $5,000 statutory amount is commonly called the 
"tort threshold" or "monetary threshold." See Mobley v. Kimura, 
146 Hawai#i 311, 313, 463 P.3d 968, 970 (2020) (tort threshold); 
Savini v. Univ. of Haw.
, 113 Hawai#i 459, 463, 465-66, 153 P.3d 
1144, 1148, 1150-51 (2007) (monetary threshold). 
[U]nder Hawai#i law, a plaintiff who relies on the medical-
expense threshold . . . has no claim at all, and the statute
of limitations does not begin to run, until the plaintiff
has actually received the requisite amount of "reasonably
necessary" medical-rehabilitative treatment, as manifested
through bills received or paid. 
. . . . 
. . . To that end, HRS § 431:10C–315(b) . . . operates
in tandem with HRS § 431:10C–306(b), extending the
plaintiff's limitation period until unrealized medical
expenses have accumulated and the gravity of the plaintiff's
injury and, hence, the presence or absence of a claim for
which relief can be granted, is ascertainable. 
Id. at 465, 466, 153 P.3d at 1150, 1151. 
Here, Darny was working when he was injured. Under HRS 
§ 431:10C-306, he had no tort claim against the pickup truck's 
driver (or the AOUO under respondeat superior) until he received 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
$5,000 in workers' compensation benefits.  But HRS § 431:10C-306 
did not bar his tort claims against Nordic or Waiea, because 
those defendants were not an "[o]wner, operator, or user of an 
insured motor vehicle" involved in Darny's accident. 
6
Darny was injured on November 23, 2016, and he does not 
contest that was when his tort claims accrued. His complaint was 
filed on December 12, 2019 — within the rolling statute of 
limitations applicable to his claim against the pickup truck's 
driver and her employer, but after the expiration of the statute 
of limitations applicable to his claims against Nordic and Waiea. 
The circuit court did not err by granting Nordic's motion and 
Waiea's joinder. 
The Final Judgment entered by the circuit court on 
June 23, 2023, is affirmed.

benefits shall be paid secondarily and net of any benefits a person is
entitled to receive because of the accidental harm from workers' compensation
laws[.]" Cf. In re Maldonado, 67 Haw. 347, 350, 687 P.2d 1, 4 (1984)
(acknowledging workers compensation is primary and no-fault is secondary for
wage loss under former HRS § 294-5 (1978)).
