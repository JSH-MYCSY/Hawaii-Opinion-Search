IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
JAMES DOHERTY, Claimant-Appellant-Appellant, v.
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,
EMPLOYMENT SECURITY APPEALS REFEREES' OFFICE (ESARO),
Appellee-Appellee.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 1CCV-21-0001059)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Chan, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
jurisdiction over self-represented Claimant-Appellant-Appellant
James Doherty's (Doherty ) appeal from the Circuit Court of the
First Circuit's February 22, 2022 Final Judgment in 1CCV-21-
0001059, as Doherty failed to file the notice of appeal within
thirty (30) days after entry of the Final Judgment, as required
by Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure, and
Doherty failed to obtain any extension of the deadline to appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that CAAP-22-0000570 is
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the pending Motion to
Consolidate, filed October 31, 2022, is dismissed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai#i, November 10, 2022.
