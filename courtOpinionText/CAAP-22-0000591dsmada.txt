APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CCV-22-0000508) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that self-
represented Plaintiffs-Appellants Vivian T. Lord, by Her Personal 
Representative William H. Gilliam, and William H. Gilliam, individually appeal from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (
circuit court) (a) September 7, 2022 "Order Granting (1) 
Defendants Hawaii First, Inc., and Certified Management Inc. dba Associa, Inc. (Incorrectly Identified as Associa, Inc. dba Associa Hawaii)'s Motion to Dismiss[,] (2) Defendant Association of Apartment Owners of Kuhio Shores at Poipu's Substantive Joinder to Motion to Dismiss[,] (3) Defendants Porter McGuire Kiakona & Chow, LLP and Porter McGuire Kiakona, LLP's Substantive Joinder to Motion to Dismiss" and (b) September 26, 2022 "Order 
Granting (1) Defendants Porter McGuire Kiakona & Chow, LLP and 
Porter McGuire Kiakona, LLP's Motion to Declare Plaintiff NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
William H. Gilliam a Vexatious Litigant Filed August 2, 2022 
[dkt. no. 120] (the 'Motion'); (2) Defendants Hawaii First, Inc., and Certified Management Inc. dba Associa, Inc. (Incorrectly Identified as Associa, Inc. dba Associa Hawaii)'s Substantive Joinder to Motion Filed August 10, 2022 [dkt. no. 136]; and (3) Defendant Association of Apartment Owners of Kuhio Shores at Poipu's Substantive Joinder to Motion Filed August 12, 2022 [dkt. no. 158]." 
However, we lack jurisdiction over this appeal because 
the circuit court has not entered a final, appealable order or judgment. See Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016); 
Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure Rules 54(b), 58; Jenkins v. 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994). Further, the orders appealed from are not independently appealable under the collateral-order doctrine, the Forgay
1 doctrine, or HRS ยง 641-1(b). See Greer v. Baker, 137 
Hawai# i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (setting forth the 
requirements for appealability under the collateral-order doctrine and the Forgay doctrine); HRS ยง 641-1(b) (specifying requirements for leave to file interlocutory appeal);see also, e.g., Yamauchi v. Middleton, No. CAAP-15-0000070, 2015 WL 2164599, at *1 (App. May 5, 2015) (Order Dismissing Appeal). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, December 19, 2022.
