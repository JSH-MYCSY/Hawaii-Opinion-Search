Kaeo Thomas U# u appeals from the November 3, 2022
Amended Judgment
 and Notice of Entry of Judgment entered by the 
District Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division.1 U#u 
challenges the 
Order and Notice of Entry of Order denying his 
motion to dismiss the second amended complaint filed by the State 
of Hawai# i. We affirm. 
On April 29, 2022, U# u was stopped by a Maui Police 
Department officer for driving without a seatbelt. 
He was unable 
to produce a driver's license. On May 17, 2022, the State filed 
an amended complaint charging U# u with Operating a Vehicle After 
License and Privilege Have Been Suspended or Revoked for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-62(a)(1). U#u 
1 The Honorable Blaine J. Kobayashi presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
moved to dismiss on July 28, 2022. He argued, among other 
things, his violation was de minimis. 
On August 8, 2022, the State filed a second amended 
complaint. The second amended complaint charged U# u with 
violating HRS § 291E-62(a)(1) and/or (2). 
The motion to dismiss was heard on August 18, 2022. 
The State represented it would not be proceeding under HRS § 291E-62(a)(1). The district court denied the motion to dismiss, ordered the State to file a third amended complaint, and set a further arraignment and plea hearing. The Order denying the motion to dismiss was entered on August 18, 2022. 
The third amended complaint was filed on August 18, 
2022. It charged U# u with violating HRS § 291E-62(a)(2) only. 
Trial was held on September 28, 2022. 
The district court found 
U#u guilty as charged. The Amended Judgment was entered on 
November 3, 2022. 
U#u appeals. He argues the district court erred by 
denying his motion to dismiss for de minimis violation. 
We 
review for abuse of discretion. State v. Pacquing, 129 Hawai# i 
172, 179, 297 P.3d 188, 195 (2013). 
HRS § 702-236(1)(b) (2014) provides: 
(1) The court may dismiss a prosecution if, having regard
to the nature of the conduct alleged and the nature of the
attendant circumstances, it finds that the defendant'sconduct: 
. . . . 
(b) Did not actually cause or threaten the harm or
evil sought to be prevented by the law definingthe offense or did so only to an extent tootrivial to warrant the condemnation of conviction[.] 
"[O]ur inquiry into the harm or evil sought to be 
prevented by a statute relies primarily on the plain language of 
the statute itself." Pacquing, 129 Hawai#i at 180, 297 P.3d at 
196. HRS § 291E-62 (2020) provided, in relevant part: 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(a) No person whose license and privilege to operate a
vehicle have been revoked, suspended, or otherwise
restricted pursuant to this section or to part III[(Administrative Revocation Process)] or section 291E–61[(Operating a Vehicle under the Influence of an Intoxicant(OVUII))] or 291E–61.5 [(Habitually OVUII)] . . . shall
operate or assume actual physical control of any vehicle: 
(1) In violation of any restrictions placed on theperson's license; 
(2) While the person's license or privilege tooperate a vehicle remains suspended or revoked; 
(3) Without installing an ignition interlock devicerequired by this chapter; or 
(4) With an ignition interlock permit unless theperson has the ignition interlock permit in theperson's immediate possession. 
The plain language of HRS § 291E-62 shows the harm or 
evil it sought to prevent was a person whose driver's license has 
been revoked for OVUII driving a vehicle without an installed ignition interlock device and an ignition interlock permit. 
U#u doesn't dispute that his driver's license was 
administratively revoked on April 29, 2022. 
He argued an 
ignition interlock device had been installed in his pickup truck and was in use on April 29, 2022; he had applied for, but not yet received, an ignition interlock permit under HRS § 291E-61(i);
  
and his not having the permit on April 29, 2022, was trivial because he received it two weeks later. His conduct was "the harm or evil sought to be prevented by" the plain language of HRS 2
2 HRS § 291E-61 (2020) provides, in relevant part: 
(i) Upon proof that the defendant has: 
(1) Installed an ignition interlock device in any
vehicle the defendant operates pursuant tosubsection (b); and 
(2) Obtained motor vehicle insurance or self-insurance that complies with the requirementsunder either section 431:10C-104 or section 431:10C-105, 
the court shall issue an ignition interlock permit that willallow the defendant to drive a vehicle equipped with anignition interlock device during the revocation period.

§ 291E-62(a)(2) and his violation was not trivial. Cf. State v. 
Melendez, 146 Hawai# i 391, 397, 463 P.3d 1048, 1054 (2020) 
(holding that if possessed drugs are neither usable nor saleable 
and attendant circumstances don't otherwise demonstrate defendant's violation caused harm statute criminalizing promoting a dangerous drug in the third decree seeks to prevent, de minimis dismissal is warranted). 
We conclude the district court acted within its 
discretion by denying U# u's motion to dismiss for de minimis 
violation. The Amended Judgment entered by the district court on November 3, 2022, is affirmed.
