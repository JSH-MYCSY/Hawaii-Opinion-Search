(CIVIL NO. 2CC171000151) 
 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.)

a lender's foreclosure complaint with prejudice, following the 
court's denial of a motion to set aside the dismissal that was

Plaintiff-Appellant Deutsche Bank National Trust 
Company as Trustee for American Home Mortgage Assets Trust 2007-
3 Mortgage-Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-3 (DB) 
appeals from the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's (Circuit 
Court)
1 September 13, 2022 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law 
[(COLs)], and Order Denying [DB]'s [Hawai‘i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b)2] Motion for Reconsideration" (Order 
Denying Reconsideration and Rule 60(b) Relief). 
On appeal, DB contends the Circuit Court abused its 
discretion by refusing to reconsider dismissal with prejudice: 
(1) by concluding DB waived its challenge to the post-judgment 
order denying the motion to set aside the clerk's dismissal by 
not appealing the Final Judgment, and that post-judgment relief 
under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6)  did not apply; (2) by concluding DB's 
pre-judgment motion to set aside dismissal was untimely under 
former Rule 12(q) of the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the

1 The Honorable Kirstin M. Hamman presided. 
2 DB's motion for reconsideration, filed after the May 11, 2022 
Final Judgment, cited HRCP Rule 60(b); and the COLs challenged on appeal 
rejected relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(1) and (b)(6). 
3 HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) provides that: "On motion and upon such terms 
as are just, the court may relieve a party . . . from a final judgment, 
order, or proceeding for . . . any other reason justifying relief from the 
operation of the judgment." The motion " shall be made within a reasonable 
time[.]"  Id.

State of Hawai‘i (RCCH)  and under HRCP Rule 60(b)(1);  and 
(3) despite no clear record or evidence of deliberate delay or 
contumacious conduct, and actual prejudice to Defendant-Appellee 
Maui Paipala Place, LLC (
Maui Paipala), by failing to consider 
lesser sanctions, and failing to issue essential findings in 
connection with the dismissal with prejudice.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve DB's 
contentions as follows. 
On May 4, 2021, the Circuit Court clerk entered an 
"Order Dismissing Complaint (RCCH Rule 12(q))" (Clerk's 
Dismissal) that dismissed DB's complaint due to its failure to 
timely file a pretrial statement. The Clerk's Dismissal 
indicated the complaint may be reinstated upon filing of a 
4 Under former RCCH Rule 12(q) (2020), "[a]n action may be 
dismissed sua sponte with written notice to the parties if a pretrial 
statement has not been filed within 8 months after a complaint has been filed 
(or within any further period of extension granted by the court)" and "[s]uch 
dismissal may be set aside and the action reinstated by order of the court 
for good cause shown upon motion duly filed not later than ten (10) days from 
the date of the order of dismissal." However, a dismissal under RCCH Rule 
12(q) is not effective until entry of judgment under HRCP Rule 58. Price v.
Obayashi Haw. Corp.
, 81 Hawai‘i 171, 176, 914 P.2d 1364, 1369 (1996). 
5 HRCP Rule 60(b)(1) permits post-judgment relief for "mistake, 
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect"; and a motion under (b)(1) must 
be filed "not more than one year after the judgment" or order. 
6 We have consolidated, reordered, and restated DB's nine points of 
error (POEs) for clarity. DB' s original POEs 1 through 4 deal with the 
sufficiency of findings required to support a dismissal with prejudice; POEs 
5 and 6 deal with the timeliness of DB's second motion to set aside dismissal 
under RCCH Rule 12(q) and HRCP Rule 60(b)(1); POEs 7 and 8 concern the 
applicability of HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) and whether waiver applies because DB did 
not appeal from the Final Judgment; and POE 9 raises whether comity and law 
of the case precluded reconsideration in this case. We address all of these 
POEs except for POE 9, which is not necessary in light of our resolution.

motion within ten days showing good reason to set aside 
dismissal.7 
DB's first motion to set aside Clerk's Dismissal 
Seven months later, on December 14, 2021, DB moved to 
set aside the Clerk's Dismissal, which the Circuit Court granted 
in a January 3, 2022 order reinstating the case (Reinstatement 
Order). DB filed its pretrial statement on January 25, 2022. 
On February 7, 2022, Maui Paipala moved to set aside 
the Reinstatement Order and strike the pretrial statement, 
arguing, inter alia, that DB's motion to set aside the Clerk's 
Dismissal and DB's pretrial statement were not served on Maui 
Paipala; and that DB failed to move to set aside the Clerk's 
Dismissal within ten days under RCCH Rule 12(q). DB's 
opposition argued that the failure to serve was an oversight 
because its counsel mistakenly believed Maui Paipala would be 
automatically served via JEFS. Following a hearing, the Circuit 
Court filed a March 7, 2022 order granting Maui Paipala's motion 
to set aside the Reinstatement Order and striking DB's January 
25, 2022 pretrial statement (Order Setting Aside Reinstatement). 
On May 5, 2022, Maui Paipala submitted to the Circuit 
Court a proposed final judgment for entry.

DB's second motion to set aside Clerk's Dismissal 
On May 10, 2022, DB filed its second motion to set 
aside the Clerk's Dismissal or clarify that the dismissal is 
without prejudice, and to strike Maui Paipala's proposed final 
judgment because the Circuit Court had not yet directed entry of 
7 The Clerk's Dismissal was entered under the authority of the 
Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo, who presided before Judge Hamman was assigned. 
8 The record does not indicate that the Circuit Court had expressed 
an intent to enter a final judgment on the reinstated Clerk's Dismissal or 
that it had asked Maui Paipala to submit a proposed final judgment.

judgment (2nd Motion to Set Aside).  DB cited both HRCP Rule 
60(b) and the Circuit Court's inherent powers under Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 603-21.9
9 as the authority for granting 
the relief requested. 
Filings after entry of May 11, 2022 Final Judgment 
On May 11, 2022, one day after DB filed its 2nd Motion 
to Set Aside the Clerk's Dismissal, the Circuit Court entered 
the proposed final judgment submitted by Maui Paipala (Final 
Judgment).
10 The Final Judgment states that it is a "final 
judgment of dismissal" on the complaint pursuant to HRCP Rule 58 
"and in accordance with" the Clerk's Dismissal and the Order 
Setting Aside Reinstatement. 
On May 19, 2022, eight days after entry of the May 11, 
2022 Final Judgment, Maui Paipala filed its opposition to DB's 
pre-judgment 2nd Motion to Set Aside. 
On June 16, 2022, 36 days after the May 11, 2022 Final 
Judgment, the Circuit Court filed its order denying the 2nd 
Motion to Set Aside the Clerk's Dismissal (Order Denying 2nd 
Motion to Set Aside). 
On June 27, 2022, DB filed "Plaintiff's Motion for 
Reconsideration" of the June 16, 2022 Order Denying 2nd Motion 
to Set Aside (Motion for Reconsideration and 60(b) Relief), 
under HRCP 59(e) and 60(b), which the Circuit Court denied on 
September 13, 2022; and DB timely appealed from this order. 
In the September 13, 2022 Order Denying 
Reconsideration and 60(b) Relief, the Circuit Court concluded, 
9 Relevant here, HRS § 603-21.9(6) (2016) provides circuit courts 
with the inherent power "[t]o make and award such judgments, decrees, orders, 
and mandates . . . for the promotion of justice in matters pending before 
them." 
10 DB did not file an appeal within 30 days of the May 11, 2022 
Final Judgment. 
5  
 
 
 
 
  
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
inter alia, that: the 2nd Motion to Set Aside offered no 
evidence or declaration testimony of inadvertence and excusable 
neglect for failing to timely file the pretrial statement or to 
seek reinstatement within ten days of the Clerk's Dismissal; 
DB was negligent in letting more than two years pass from the 
deadline before filing a pretrial statement and waiting months 
before seeking relief from the Clerk's Dismissal; the 2nd Motion 
to Set Aside was properly denied as untimely under HRCP Rule 
60(b)(1), and there was no showing of "extraordinary 
circumstances" justifying relief from the Clerk's Dismissal 
under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6); DB waived its objections to the 
Clerk's Dismissal by failing to timely appeal from the Final 
Judgment or file an HRCP Rule 59 motion to alter or amend the 
Final Judgment; the record "demonstrates deliberate delay and 
contumacious conduct" warranting dismissal with prejudice 
because of DB's delay in seeking relief from the Clerk's 
Dismissal and because DB "admitted to . . . ignoring its filing 
deadlines" when it said it was "waiting for a resolution of" a 
related federal district court proceeding, and thus, actual 
prejudice is presumed; DB's delay actually prejudiced Maui 
Paipala because "discoverable evidence has likely been discarded 
or lost and the memories of witnesses have no doubt faded" and 
it is "likely that some witnesses are no longer available"; and 
principles of comity and the law of the case doctrine preclude 
setting aside the Clerk's Dismissal because it was entered under 
the authority of a different judge. 
1. Under the circumstances of this case, post-judgment 
relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) was warranted. 
DB challenges COL 12 in the Order Denying 
Reconsideration and Rule 60(b) Relief, which concluded that Rule 
60(b)(6) relief was "not available" for the excusable neglect 
6  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that was covered under subsection (b)(1). Maui Paipala argues 
that DB was not entitled to move for relief under HRCP Rule 
60(b)(6) because DB failed to "establish the existence of 
'extraordinary circumstances' that prevented or rendered [it] 
unable to prosecute an appeal" from the Final Judgment. DB 
responds, inter alia, that extraordinary circumstances in this 
case justify relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) because the Circuit 
Court dismissed the case with prejudice without making essential 
findings justifying the sanction; a dismissal with prejudice 
would leave DB without a remedy for the loan default; and DB 
filed its May 10, 2022 2nd Motion to Set Aside within a 
reasonable time after the March 7, 2022 Order Setting Aside 
Reinstatement. 
Disposition of an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion is reviewed 
for an abuse of discretion. OneWest Bank, F.S.B. v. Ass'n of
Owners of Kumulani at Uplands at Mauna Kea
, 146 Hawai‘i 105, 111, 
456 P.3d 178, 184 (2020). "A party seeking relief under HRCP 
Rule 60(b)(6) after the time for appeal has run must establish 
the existence of 'extraordinary circumstances' that prevented or 
rendered them unable to prosecute an appeal." 
PennyMac Corp. v.
Godinez
, 148 Hawai‘i 323, 331, 474 P.3d 264, 272 (2020) (citation 
omitted). "However, this is not an inflexible rule and in 
unusual cases a party who has not taken an appeal may obtain 
relief on motion." 
Citicorp Mortg., Inc. v. Bartolome
, 
94 Hawai‘i 422, 436, 16 P.3d 827, 841 (App. 2000), abrogated on 
other grounds by 
Chen v. Mah
, 146 Hawai‘i 157, 457 P.3d 796 
(2020). 
In another case involving an RCCH Rule 12(q) clerk's 
dismissal, we held that the circuit court "abused its discretion 
in imposing dismissal with prejudice solely for [p]laintiff's 
7  
 
 
 
 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
failure to file a timely pretrial statement and without any 
consideration on the record of less severe sanctions." Ryan v.
Palmer, 130 Hawai‘i 321, 324, 310 P.3d 1022, 1025 (App. 2013). 
There, we cautioned that "[t]he power of the court to prevent 
undue delays and to achieve the orderly disposition of cases 
must be weighed against the policy of law which favors 
disposition of litigation on its merits." Id. (citation 
omitted); see Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai‘i 368, 380, 465 P.3d 815, 
827 (2020) (reiterating that 
Hawai‘i courts have "long adhered to 
the policy of affording litigants the opportunity to be heard on 
the merits whenever possible" (citation omitted)). 
Here, DB's 2nd Motion to Set Aside filed May 10, 2022 
was still pending when the Circuit Court entered the May 11, 
2022 Final Judgment the next day. Thereafter, Maui Paipala 
filed its May 19, 2022 opposition to the 2nd Motion to Set 
Aside. 
The Circuit Court did not enter the Order Denying 2nd 
Motion to Set Aside until June 16, 2022 -- after the 30-day 
deadline to appeal the Final Judgment had elapsed under Hawai‘i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 4(a)(1). It appears the 
Circuit Court and the parties were operating under the 
impression that the Circuit Court still needed to dispose of the 
2nd Motion to Set Aside even after the Final Judgment was 
entered. Under the extraordinary and unusual procedural 
circumstances present here, and in light of our public policy 
favoring disposition of cases on their merits whenever possible, 
we conclude that post-judgment relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) 
was warranted. 
See Citicorp Mortg., Inc.
, 94 Hawai‘i at 436, 16 
P.3d at 841; 
Erum
, 147 Hawai‘i at 380, 465 P.3d at 827. We thus 
review the denial of the 2nd Motion to Set Aside as well as the 
denial of the reconsideration of it.

NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2. The 2nd Motion to Set Aside, which sought relief 
under the court's inherent power prior to final 
judgment, was not untimely. 
DB contends the Circuit Court erred in failing to 
reconsider dismissal on the basis that DB failed to timely seek 
reinstatement within ten days of the Clerk's Dismissal under 
RCCH Rule 12(q) or within one year under HRCP Rule 60(b)(1). DB 
argues that a timely motion for reinstatement is not the only 
method to challenge a dismissal for failure to prosecute; the 
2nd Motion to Set Aside also sought to clarify that the 
dismissal was without prejudice and to strike the proposed final 
judgment; and such relief was not bound by the one-year deadline 
in HRCP Rule 60(b)(1). 
On appeal, we review a sua sponte order of dismissal 
for want of prosecution for abuse of discretion. Ryan, 
130 Hawai‘i at 323, 310 P.3d at 1024. 
Here, the 2nd Motion to Set Aside, which was filed 
before Final Judgment, was not an HRCP Rule 60(b) post-judgment 
motion for relief; rather, it invoked the Circuit Court's 
inherent power to revisit an interlocutory order prior to final 
judgment. Cho v. State, 115 Hawai‘i 373, 382-83, 168 P.3d 17, 
26-27 (2007); see Bailey v. Duvauchelle, 135 Hawai‘i 482, 491, 
353 P.3d 1024, 1033 (2015) ("[R]elief under HRCP Rule 60(b) 
requires an underlying judgment."); see also e.g., Wheels of
Justice, LLC v. Title Guar. Escrow Servs., Inc., No. CAAP-11-
0000168, 2011 WL 4011735, at *2 (Haw. App. Sept. 9, 2011) 
(Dismissal Order) (pre-judgment motion to set aside RCCH Rule 
12(q) dismissal filed after ten-day reinstatement period invoked 
the trial court's inherent power to revise interlocutory 
orders). The Circuit Court's legal conclusions in this regard 
were erroneous. As the 2nd Motion to Set Aside was not 
9  
 
 
 
 
 
  
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
untimely, the Circuit Court acted outside the scope of its 
discretion by denying it for that reason. The record in this 
case also reflected evidence of counsel's inadvertence and/or 
excusable neglect for DB's failure to timely file a pretrial 
statement. See Nakamoto v. Hilton Waikoloa Vill., 2019 WL 
1747015, at *3 (Haw. App. Apr. 18, 2019) (SDO) (concluding that 
the circuit court abused its discretion in refusing to set aside 
the dismissal of the complaint where the record showed counsel's 
failure to timely file the pretrial statement was inadvertent). 
3. The dismissal with prejudice was not supported by 
the required findings. 
DB argues the Circuit Court erred in failing to 
reconsider its dismissal with prejudice because it failed to 
enter essential findings supporting such dismissal with 
prejudice prior to Final Judgment. 
"RCCH Rule 12(q)'s language is patterned after HRCP 
Rule 41(b)(2)." Ryan, 130 Hawai‘i at 323, 310 P.3d at 1024. 
Under HRCP Rule 41(b)(2), "a dismissal with prejudice is a 
'severe sanction' of 'last resort' that cannot be affirmed 
'absent deliberate delay, contumacious conduct, or actual 
prejudice.'" Id. (quoting In re Blaisdell, 125 Hawai‘i 44, 49, 
252 P.3d 63, 68 (2011)). 
"[A]bsent a clear record of delay or 
contumacious conduct, the careful exercise of judicial 
discretion requires that a trial court consider less severe 
sanctions [than dismissal] and explain, where not obvious, their 
inadequacy for promoting the interests of justice." Blaisdell, 
125 Hawai‘i at 49, 252 P.3d at 68 (cleaned up). "[T]he 
preconditions for a valid dismissal set forth in Blaisdell 
result from the severity of the sanction of dismissal itself, 
not from the dismissal in that case being based on HRCP Rule 
10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
   
 
  
 
   
  
  
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
41(b)." Erum, 147 Hawai‘ i at 383, 465 P.3d at 830 (citation 
omitted). Accordingly, the Erum court held: 
whenever a case is involuntarily dismissed with prejudice, 
the trial court must state essential findings on the record 
or make written findings as to deliberate delay or 
contumacious conduct and actual prejudice and explain why a 
lesser sanction than dismissal with prejudice is 
insufficient to serve the interests of justice [(Erum 
Factors)]. 
Id. at 390, 465 P.3d at 837. 
Here, because the 2nd Motion to Set Aside sought to 
set aside the Clerk's Dismissal or clarify that the dismissal 
was without prejudice, the Circuit Court's denial of the motion 
constituted a discretionary decision to dismiss the case with 
prejudice as a sanction.  Thus, it was required to make 
findings justifying the dismissal with prejudice under the Erum 
Factors. 
E.g., Wheels of Justice, LLC v. Title Guar. Escrow
Servs., Inc., No. CAAP-14-0000758, 2017 WL 1927746 (Haw. App. 
May 10, 2017) (SDO). Prior to entry of Final Judgment,
11
 the 
Circuit Court made no findings of deliberate delay, contumacious 
conduct, or actual prejudice, and the record does not reflect 
express consideration of less severe sanctions. 
12
11 Under Saplan v. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n as Tr. for BAFC 2007-A, 154 
Hawai‘i 181, 189, 549 P.3d 266, 274 (2024), consideration of the 
Erum Factors 
is not required before entry of a dismissal order for failure to prosecute 
under RCCH Rule 12(q), "which requires dismissal as a matter of course[,]" 
but it is required when the trial court denies a subsequent motion to set 
aside an RCCH Rule 12(q) order dismissing the complaint with prejudice, 
because at that point, the denial is an exercise of the trial court's 
discretion to dismiss the case as a sanction. 
12 The findings pertinent to the Erum Factors were in the post-
judgment Order Denying Reconsideration and Rule 60(b) Relief, and cannot 
constitute an after-the-fact basis to deny the 2nd Motion to Set Aside. 
Moreover, the Circuit Court's conclusions in that Order that evidence or 
witnesses have "likely" been discarded, that memories of witnesses have "no 
doubt" faded, and that it is "likely" some witnesses are no longer available 
appear speculative in nature, rather than based on a specific factual 
determination of prejudice. 
11  
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On this record, we conclude the Circuit Court acted 
outside the scope of its discretion in denying DB's Motion for 
Reconsideration and Rule 60(b) Relief, by not reconsidering its 
dismissal of the case with prejudice for DB's failure to file a 
timely pretrial statement, by not applying the Erum Factors in 
dismissing the case with prejudice, and by not explaining why 
less severe sanctions were insufficient. 
Based on the above reasons, we vacate the Second 
Circuit Court's September 13, 2022 Order Denying Reconsideration 
and Rule 60(b) Relief, and remand for proceedings consistent 
with this Summary Disposition Order. 
Further, DB's Motion for Retention of Oral Argument 
filed on May 5, 2025 is denied.
