APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CPC-21-0000417) 
 ORDER 
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Guidry, JJ.)  
Upon consideration of Defendant-Appellant James Green, 
Jr.'s (
Green) Motion For Reconsideration, filed on November 29, 
2023, and the record, this court determines that reconsideration 
is warranted to amend the Summary Disposition Order, filed on 
November 20, 2023, as follows: 
1. The first sentence of the last paragraph on page 
12, including footnote 10, is deleted.    
 2. The first sentence of the first full paragraph on 
page 13 is amended to read, "We thus affirm the Judgment without 
prejudice to Green's filing of a petition for post-conviction relief, pursuant to HRPP Rule 40, to allow for the development of a factual record as to those contentions of ineffective assistance." 
3. The last sentence of the disposition, on pages 13-
14, is amended to add the word "amended" before "summary 
disposition order." 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for 
Reconsideration is granted in part, and an Amended Summary 
Disposition Order that incorporates the above amendments will be filed forthwith. 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that, in all other 
respects, the motion for reconsideration is denied.
