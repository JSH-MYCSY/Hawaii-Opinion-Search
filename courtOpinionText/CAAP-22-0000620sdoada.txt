SUMMARY DISPOSITION  ORDER  
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.)  
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai ʻi (State)  appeals 
from the "Findings of Fact [(FOFs)], Conclusions of Law 
[(COLs)], and Order  Granting State's Motion to Reconsider the 
Suppression of Statements of Counts Four Through Nine"  (Order),  
filed  on September 20, 2022,  by the Circuit  Court of the Second 
Circuit (circuit  court).   1

counts of Sexual Assault . Counts One through Three related to 
one complaining witness for an incident that occurred on or 
about August 14, 2020 , and Counts Four through Nine related to a 
second complaining witness , who was fourteen to sixteen years 
old at the time, that occurred between January 1, 2020 and 
March 3, 2020. 
Prior to trial, Paleka filed "Defendant's Motion to 
Suppress Statements" ( Motion to Suppress ), seeking to suppress 
statements he made to Maui Police Department ( MPD) Detective 
Kyle Bishaw -Juario (Detective Bishaw -Juario) on March 14, 2020 , 
while under arrest regarding the charged sexual assault s related 
to the second complaining witness who was fourteen to sixteen 
years old . After hearings on the voluntariness of Paleka's 
statements , 2 and the Motion to Suppress Paleka's March 14, 2020 
statements, t he circuit court suppressed Paleka's March 14, 2020 
statements . The circuit court concluded that the police lacked 
probable cause to arrest Paleka and, thus, the "resulting 
custodial interrogation was illegal." 
The circuit court found that since "there was no 
evidence presented by the State to support the arrest on 
March 14, 2020, everything thereafter [was] fruit of the 
2 The circuit court found that Paleka's statements were properly 
informed, and knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily given with regard to 
Counts One through Three. The parties proceeded to a jury trial on Counts 
One through Three, and Paleka was convicted of one count of Sexual Assault in 
the Second Degree. Paleka withdr ew his appeal of that conviction .

poisonous tree and the case shall be dismissed." The circuit 
court then dismiss ed Counts Four through Nine with prejudice . 
On appeal, the State contend s that the circuit court 
abused its discretion by dismissing Counts Four through Nine 
with prejudice. The State argues that : (1) the circuit court 
infringed "on the State's determination on how to prepare its 
cases for trial"; (2) the suppression order would not affect the 
evidence obtained prior to March 14, 2020; (3) "the suppression 
remedy requested by Paleka was sufficient to ensure fairness to 
the defendant, while a dismissal with prejudice that no party 
requested undercuts the State's interest in pro secuting criminal 
conduct"; and (4) even assuming dismissal was warranted, 
dismissal with prejudice was "an extreme sanction." 
Upon careful review of the record , briefs, and 
relevant legal authorities , and having given due consideration 
to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties , 
we vacate the circuit court's Order as follows. 
"Trial courts have the power to dismiss sua sponte  an 
indictment with prejudice and over the objection of the 
prosecuting attorney within the bounds of duly exercised 
discretion." State v. Mageo, 78 Hawai‘i  33, 37, 889 P.2d 1092, 
1096 (App. 1995)  (quoting State v. Moriwake, 65 Haw. 47, 55, 647 
P.2d 705, 711-12 (1982)) (cleaned up). "The parameters within 
which this discretion is properly exercised requires a balancing 
3   
 
     
   
 
  
 
  
   
   
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of the interest of the state against fundamental fairness to a 
defendant with the added ingredient of the orderly functioning 
of the court system." Id. (cleaned up). This court also 
instructed that " in the future, trial courts exercising this 
power should issue written factual findings setting forth their 
reasons for dismissal with prejudice so that a reviewing court 
may accurately assess whether the trial court duly exercised its 
discretion." Id. at 38, 889 P.2d at 1097 (cleaned up ). 
We first emphasize that the parties do not cite, and 
we could not find, where in the record there was a motion to 
dismiss Counts Four through Nine. Thus, it appears the 
dismissal was sua sponte . 
Next, a review of the voluntariness and suppression 
hearing transcripts show that the State had acquired some 
evidence prior to Paleka's March 14, 2020 statement made while 
under arrest . Detective Bishaw -Juario testified that, prior to 
Paleka's March 14, 2020 statement, Detective Bishaw -Juario had 
statements from the complaining witness and Paleka's 
grandfather, the dates of the Plan B contraceptive pickups 
confirmed by Molokai General Hospital , and beddings collected 
from Paleka's bedroom. The circuit court, however, made no 
findings explaining how the evidence obtained prior to Paleka's 
March 14, 2020 statement would be fruit of the poisonous tree or 
why this evidence was insufficient to proceed on Counts Four 
4

through Nine. See State v. Willis , 154 Hawaiʻi 160, 173, 548 
P.3d 714, 727 (App. 2024) ("The testimony of one percipient 
witness can provide sufficient evidence to support a 
conviction." ) (quoting State v. Pulse , 83 Hawaiʻi 229, 244, 
925 P.2d 797, 812 (1996)). 
Finally, nothing in the circuit court's FOFs and COLs 
show it balanced the State's interest against fairness to Paleka 
and why the requested suppression of Paleka's March 14, 2020 
statement was an insufficient remedy. 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the part of the 
circuit court's Order that dismissed Counts Four through Nine 
with prejudice , and remand for further proceedings consistent 
with this summary disposition order .
