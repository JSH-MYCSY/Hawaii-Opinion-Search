Settlement with Defendants Trustees of the Estate of Bernice 
Pauahi Bishop dba Kamehameha Schools and St. Francis Medical 
Center, Filed August 15, 2022"  (Joinder Order ),  filed on 
November 14, 2022 by the circuit court.  
This court consolidated Kamehameha Schools' two 
appeals under CAAP -22-0000638. 
I. BACKGROUND 
In 2021, F.A. and nine other plaintiffs filed a 
Complaint against Kamehameha Schools, St. Francis Medical 
Center, and Defendant/Cross -claim Defendant -Appellee Estate of 
Robert McCormick Browne ( Estate of Dr. Browne ),4 pursuant to 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 657-1.8 (2016 & Supp. 2018 ). 
The plaintiffs identified Dr. Browne, formerly employed as Chief 
of Psychiatry at St. Francis Medical Center , as having sexually 
abused them when they were students at Kamehameha Schools. HRS 
§ 657-1.8 permits certain actions "for recovery of damages based 
on physical, psychological, or other injury or condition 
suffered by a minor arising from the sexual abuse of the minor 
by any person" that would otherwise be time -barred. 
Plaintiffs' Complaint a sserted claims of negligence 
and gross negligence, and fraud and fraudulent concealment, 
against Kamehameha Schools. 
4 Dr. Browne is deceased, and t he Estate of Dr. Browne is a nominal 
appellee in this appeal.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kamehameha Schools filed cross-claims against St. 
Francis Medical Center and the Estate  of Dr. Browne, and a 
third-party complaint against St. Francis Healthcare System . 
F.A. entered into separate settlement agreements with 
St. Francis and Kamehameha Schools. In August 2022, F.A. filed 
a Petition for Determination of Good Faith Settlement 
(Petition ). St. Francis Medical Center joined F .A.'s Petition5 
to the extent it requested a determination that F.A.'s 
settlement with St. Francis Medical Center was made in good 
faith, took no position with respect to F.A.'s request for a 
determination of good faith settlement with Kamehameha Schools, 
and joined F.A. 's request that all cross -claims against St. 
Francis Medical Center related to F.A.'s claims be dismissed. 
Kamehameha Schools joined F.A.'s Petition to the extent that it 
requested a determination that F.A.'s settlement with Kamehameha 
Schools was made in good faith, took no position with respect to 
F.A.'s request for a determination of good faith settlement with 
St. Francis Medical Center, and opposed the Petition to the 
extent it sought to dismiss Kamehameha Schools ' cross-claims 
against St. Francis Medi cal Center. 
The circuit court granted the Petition and entered its 
Good Faith Order in October 2022 . Kamehameha Schools timely 
5 St. Francis Healthcare System made an oral motion to join F.A.'s 
Petition at the hearing on September 21, 2022, which the circuit court 
granted.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appealed the Good Faith Order, and the appeal was docketed as 
CAAP-22-0000638. The circuit court entered its Joinder Order in 
November 2022 , Kamehameha Schools timely appealed the Joinder 
Order, and the appeal was docketed as CAAP -22-0000725. 
II. POINT OF ERROR 
Kamehameha Schools raises a single point of erro r on 
appeal, contending that the circuit court erred in concluding 
that the good faith settlement bars all of Kamehameha Schools' 
cross-claims and third-party claims under HRS § 663 -15.5 (2016). 
We review the circuit court's conclusions of law de 
novo, under the right/wrong standard. State v. Hoshijo ex rel. 
White, 102 Hawaiʻi 307, 316, 76 P.3d 550, 559 (2003). Upon 
careful review of the record and relevant legal authorities, and 
having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the 
issues raised by the parties, we resolve Kamehameha Schools' 
contention as follows. 
HRS § 663 -15.5, entitled "Release; joint tortfeasors; 
co-obligors; good faith settlement" provides, in pertinent part, 
(d) A determination by the court that a settlement 
was made in good faith shall: 
(1) Bar any other joint tortfeasor . . . from any 
further claims against the settling tortfeasor 
. . . except those based on a written indemnity 
agreement; and 
(2) Result in a dismissal of all cross -claims filed 
against the settling joint tortfeasor . . . 
except those based on a written indemnity 
agreement.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Contrary to Kamehameha Schools' contention, the 
circuit court did not authorize a "sweeping dismissal" of all 
claims –  including those grounded on independent duties owed to 
Kamehameha Schools –  against St. Francis.   The circuit court's 
Good Faith Order  stated,  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Plaintiff F.A. 's Petition 
is GRANTED for good cause. The Court finds the settlements 
were entered into by the parties in good faith and there is 
no evidence of fraud or collusion between the settling 
parties. In accordance with the law, the Court hereby 
dismisses all cross -claims and third -party claims between 
the parties as to Plaintiff F.A.  
(Emphasis added.) The circuit court's Joinder Order further 
explained: 
2. All cross -claims against [St. Francis Medical 
Center], as they relate to Plaintiff F.A. 's claims, are 
hereby dismissed pursuant to HRS 663 -15.5(d)(2). 
3. [St. Francis Medical Center] is discharged from 
all liability for contribution to any other joint 
tortfeasor or co -obligor as related to Plaintiff F.A .'s 
claims. 
4. Pursuant to HRS § 663-15.5(d)(1), this Order bars 
any other joint tortfeasor or co -obligor from bringing any 
further claims against [St. Francis Medical Center] in 
connection with Plaintiff [] F.A.'s claims in this 
litigation, except those based upon a written indemnity 
agreement. 
As this court recently recognized in Abad v. Griffith , 
Reading all parts of HRS § 663 -15.5 together, we conclude 
the trial court's approval of a good faith settlement under 
HRS § 663 -15.5(d)(2) requires dismissal of only those 
crossclaims against a settling joint tortfeasor raised in 
the capacity of a joint to rtfeasor, i.e., those seeking 
contribution or indemnity (directly or indirectly) for the 
injury (to the complainant) that is the subject of the good 
faith settlement. 
[W]e examine, for this limited purpose, the nature of the 
[appellants'] claims against the [settling joint 
tortfeasors], i.e., to consider whether they seek 
contribution or indemnity for the original injury to 
7   
 
 
  
 
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[appellees], as opposed to relief for alleged direct 
injuries to the [appellants]. 
Abad v. Griffith, Nos. CAAP-21-0000120, CAAP-23-0000015, 2024 WL 
5088457, at *5 (Haw. App. Dec. 12, 2024) (SDO).  
In Abad, this court examined the nature of the 
appellants' claims, including the nature of the relief 
requested, and concluded that the appellants made "separate, 
unqualified requests for attorneys' fees and costs that are not 
tied to the [appellants'] liability to the [appellees]." Id. 
Here, Kamehameha Schools' cross-claims and third-party claims, 
including its breach of contract and Uyemura v. Wick6 claims, 
arose out of the "original injury" to F.A. caused by Dr. 
Browne's abuse , and are "directly or indirectly" in the nature 
of contribution and indemnity claims. 
The  circuit court's dismissal of "all cross-claims and 
third-party claims between the parties as to . . . F.A."  is 
therefore consistent with the underlying purpose of HRS §  663-
15.5 of protecting settling tortfeasors from contribution claims 
brought by nonsettling alleged joint tortfeasors.
