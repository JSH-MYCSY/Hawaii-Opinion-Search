APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 3CCV-21-0000081) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Nakasone and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the "Plaintiff, Appellant's 
Request for 20 Days to File Appellant's Jurisdiction Statement 
Appellant Requests the Court to Grant a 60 Day Continuance to File Appellants [sic] Opening Brief" (
Extension Motion), filed 
January 18, 2023, by self-represented Plaintiff/Counter Defendant-Appellant Kent Davis (Davis), and the 
"Cross-Complainant/Appellee's Opposition to Appellant's Request 
for Continuance to File Jurisdiction Statement and Opening Brief; Motion to Dismiss Appeal" (Motion to Dismiss), filed January 25, 
2023, by Defendant/Counterclaimant-Appellee Mary Wildson 
(Wildson), the papers in support, and the record, it appears that 
Davis seeks an extension of time to file the statement of 
jurisdiction and opening brief, and Wildson opposes any extension, and further requests that the court dismiss the appeal NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for lack of jurisdiction, as Davis does not appeal from a final, 
appealable order.  
Even construing Davis's October 28, 2022 notice of 
appeal as a premature appeal1 from the circuit court's 
December 6, 2022 written "Order Denying Plaintiff's Non-Hearing Motion for Recusal and Disqualify [sic] Counsel Edward Fetzer for Conflict of Interest and Failure to Acquire Written Permission from Plaintiff to Represent the Defendant" (12/6/22 Order), the 
court nonetheless lacks appellate jurisdiction, as the 12/6/22 
Order is not an appealable order, and the circuit court has not otherwise entered a final, appealable order or judgment in the 
underlying case.  See Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) 
(2016); Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure Rules 54(b), 58; Jenkins 
v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994).  Moreover, the 12/6/22 Order is not 
independently appealable under the collateral-order doctrine, the Forgay
2 doctrine, or HRS ยง 641-1(b).  See Greer v. Baker, 137 
Hawai# i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (setting forth the 
requirements for appealability under the collateral-order doctrine and the Forgay doctrine); Gomes v. Kauwe's Heirs, 52 Haw. 126, 472 P.2d 119 (1970)(dismissing an appeal from an order denying a motion to disqualify opposing party's counsel because the order was not subject to the collateral-order doctrine); HRS ยง 641-1(b) (specifying requirements for leave to file interlocutory appeal). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to 
Dismiss is granted, and the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
1  Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 4(a)(2) provides: "If a
notice of appeal is filed after announcement of a decision but before entry of
the judgment or order, such notice shall be considered as filed immediatelyafter the time the judgment or order becomes final for the purpose of appeal." 
2 Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848). 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions 
are dismissed, including, without limitation, the Extension 
Motion. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 13, 2023.
