SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: 
Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Petitioner-Appellant Samantha
 S. Cole appeals from the 
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's  ( probate court) 
October 18, 2022 Judgment in favor of Respondent-Appellee 
Amanda P. Cole and several orders.  21
1 The Honorable Kirstin M. Hamman presided. The circuit court was 
sitting in probate and is thus subsequently referred to as the probate court. 
See Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 603- 21.6 (2016) (indicating circuit 
courts have the power to appoint and remove personal representatives, compel 
personal representatives "to account in all respects for the discharge of their official duties[,]" and "[d]o all other things as provided in 
chapter 560"). 
2 Samantha appeals from the following orders: October 13, 2022 Order 
Granting Amanda's "Petition for Order Terminating [Samantha] as Personal 
Representative and Dismissing Probate Action" (Order Dismissing Probate 
(continued . . .)    
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In 1968, twins Samantha and Amanda were born to 
Elizabeth Shapiro Gilmore (Decedent) and her first husband in 
Boston, Massachusetts. Decedent divorced her first husband in 
1978, and married Donald D. Gilmore in 1985. 
In 1997, Decedent was diagnosed with terminal cancer 
and decided to move to Maui. 
On November 20, 2005, Decedent 
died intestate in Kīhei, Maui. 
According to Samantha, between Decedent's death and 
early December 2005, she and Amanda discussed their "joint 
desire to obtain and maintain [Decedent]'s photographs, 
portraits, paintings, graphic designs, and other personal 
property, and" decided to "proceed with obtaining D. Gilmore's 
interest in the Decedent's personal property in exchange for" their interest in Decedent's individual retirement account. 
According to Amanda, she, Donald, and Samantha, 
gathered in Decedent and Donald's home and divided up Decedent's 
personal belongings "amicably and by agreement." 
"With Donald 
Gilmore's permission, Amanda and Samantha divided certain personal property belonging to their mother . . . , namely her

Distribution of Estate[.]"

paintings and her photographs. By agreement . . . , Samantha 
took the paintings and Amanda took the photographs." 
Both Amanda and Samantha submitted statements from 
Donald indicating he agreed with their decision to split 
Decedent's artwork and photographs. 
For the next fourteen years, Samantha possessed the 
paintings and Amanda possessed the photographs. 
In 2019, Donald assigned Amanda all rights, title, and 
interest in Decedent's photographs and negatives, including copyright(s) to those images. About a year later, Donald 
assigned his portion of any copyright to Decedent's works 
(including "archive of creations and artwork, photographs, 
negatives, contact sheets, documents and writings of all sorts, including her journals") to Amanda. 
In 2020, Samantha petitioned the probate court for 
adjudication of intestacy and to appoint her personal 
representative of Decedent's estate, which the court granted. 
Ultimately, the probate court found that Decedent's personal 
belongings, including the paintings and photographs, were 
distributed in 2005 and, thus, were not part of Decedent's 
estate. The probate court terminated Samantha as personal 
representative and dismissed the probate action.

On appeal, Samantha challenges her dismissal as 
personal representative of Decedent's estate.  Amanda challenges 
Samantha's standing to bring this appeal.  3
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the points of error as discussed below, and affirm. 
(1) We first address Amanda's contention that the 
appeal should be dismissed because "Samantha lacks standing to 
bring this appeal as the Personal Representative of the 
Decedent[.]" Amanda argues "[t]he termination of appointment of 
a personal representative terminates the personal 
representative's authority to represent the estate in any 
pending or future proceeding[,]" following 
Hawai‘i Revised 
Statutes (HRS
) § 560:3-608 (2018). 
HRS § 560:3-608 provides in pertinent part: 
Termination ends the right and power pertaining to the 
office of personal representative as conferred by this 
chapter or any will, except that a personal representative, 
at any time prior to distribution or until restrained or 
3 Samantha also challenges the probate court's denial of her petition 
to compel immediate return of Decedent's personal belongings. Based on our decision, we need not reach this issue. 
We note that Samantha's opening brief fails to comply in material 
respects with Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b). To promote 
access to justice, we nonetheless consider Samantha's appeal. See 
Marvin v. 
Pflueger
, 127 Hawai‘i 490, 496, 280 P.3d 88, 94 (2012) (mentioning " court's 
policy of hearing cases on the merits where possible"); cf. 
generally Erum v. 
Llego
, 147 Hawaiʻi 368, 380- 81, 391, 465 P.3d 815, 827- 28, 838 (2020) (noting 
court's policy of liberally interpreting pleadings of pro se litigants "in order to promote access to justice").

enjoined by court order, may perform acts necessary to 
protect the estate and may deliver the assets to a 
successor representative. 
 . . . . 
Termination does not affect the jurisdiction of the court 
over the personal representative, but terminates the personal representative's authority to represent the estate 
in any pending or future proceeding.  
(Formatting altered.) In Hawai‘ i, standing is prudential rather 
than jurisdictional. Tax Found. of Hawai‘ i v. State, 144 Hawai‘ i 
175, 188, 439 P.3d 127, 140 (2019). 
Though it appears Hawai‘i has not determined whether a 
terminated personal representative can appeal an order removing 
them as personal representative of an estate, other 
jurisdictions allow a terminated personal representative to 
appeal a probate or trial court's order terminating them as personal representative. 
See, e.g.
, In re Est. of Unke, 583 
N.W.2d 145, 146, 150 (S.D. 1998); In re Est. of Anderson-Feeley, 174 P.3d 512, 512, 513 (Mont. 2007); but see Simon v. Simon, 957 
N.E.2d 980, 988 (Ind. Ct. App. 2011) (once removed, personal 
representative cannot "prosecute an appeal of the removal 
order"). 
We agree with those jurisdictions. To hold otherwise 
would render the order terminating Samantha as personal representative unreviewable.

(2) We now turn to Samantha's contention that the 
probate court abused its discretion in terminating her as 
personal representative of Decedent's estate. 
In terminating Samantha as personal representative, 
the probate court determined "equity does not support a 
redivision of the Decedent's property" and cited HRS § 560:3
-
108(a)(5) (2018).4 (Formatting altered.) 
HRS § 560:3-108(a)(5) indicated a "formal testacy 
proceeding" may begin more than five years after a decedent's 
death if in the court's discretion it is equitable to distribute 
property of the decedent's estate: 
A formal testacy proceeding may be commenced at any 
time after five years from the decedent's death if, in the 
discretion of the court it would be equitable to do so, for 
the purpose of establishing an instrument to direct or 
control the ownership of property passing or distributable 
after the decedent's death from one other than the decedent 
when the property is to be appointed by the terms of the 
decedent's will or is to pass or be distributed as a part 
of the decedent's estate or its transfer is otherwise to be 
controlled by the terms of the decedent's will. 
(Formatting altered, emphases added.) "'Testacy proceeding' 
means a proceeding to establish a will or determine intestacy." 
HRS § 560:1-201 (2018). 
Here, the probate court found Decedent's personal 
belongings were distributed in 2005 and were no longer part of 
4 The probate court cited " HRS § 560:3- 108(5)" in the Order Dismissing 
Probate Action, but there is no such sub- section in HRS § 560:3- 108.  
Rather, HRS § 560:3- 108(a)(5) discusses the five- year commencement period the 
probate court referred to in the Order Dismissing Probate Action. 
6    
 
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the estate. The probate court further found that "equity does 
not support a redivision of the Decedent's property[.]" As a 
result, the probate court determined it was "no longer equitable 
or necessary that Samantha act as Personal Representative." 
Because the probate court considered the parties' 
filings and examined HRS § 560:3-108(a)(5) in the context of the facts and circumstances of this case, we cannot say the court 
abused its discretion in determining that equity did not require 
redivision of Decedent's belongings seventeen years later. 
Samantha argues the probate court collaterally 
attacked its August 10, 2020 order granting her petition for 
adjudication of intestacy and appointing her personal 
representative when it entered its Order Granting Amanda's "Petition for Order Terminating [Samantha] as Personal 
Representative and Dismissing Probate Action" (Order Dismissing 
Probate Action) and removed her as personal representative. 
"A collateral attack is an attempt to impeach a 
judgment or decree in a proceeding not instituted for the 
express purpose of annulling, correcting or modifying such 
judgment or decree." In re Thomas H. Gentry Revocable Tr.
, 138 
Hawai‘i 158, 168-69, 378 P.3d 874, 884-85 (2016) (citations 
omitted). "Appellate courts in Hawai‘i have typically only 
applied the collateral attack doctrine in situations in which a 
7    
 
 
 
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
second lawsuit has been initiated challenging a judgment or 
order obtained from a prior, final proceeding." Id. at 169 n.5, 
378 P.3d at 885 n.5. 
Here, there was no second lawsuit and, thus, no 
collateral attack. 
Samantha further maintains the probate court 
disregarded e-mails appended to the February 4, 2022 memorandum 
in opposition to the petition seeking dismissal of the probate 
action and disregarded HRS § 560:3-912 (2018). 
But in the Order Dismissing Probate Action, the 
probate court noted it "considered Amanda's Petition and Reply, 
Samantha's Memorandum in Opposition, and the parties' respective 
supporting declarations and exhibits, supplemental submissions, the records, files and rulings herein, as well as the 
representations of counsel" before dismissing the probate action 
in its entirety, and the record indicates these filings 
referenced HRS § 560:3-912. 
Thus, the probate court did not disregard HRS § 560:3-
912 or the e-mails appended to the memorandum in opposition when 
it entered its Order Dismissing Probate Action. 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the probate court's 
October 18, 2022 Judgment; October 13, 2022 Order Dismissing Probate Action; January 31, 2022 "Order Denying [Samantha]'s 
Petition/Non-Hearing Motion for Reconsideration"; and
