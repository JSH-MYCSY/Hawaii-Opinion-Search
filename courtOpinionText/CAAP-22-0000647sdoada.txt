SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.)  
Respondent/Appellee-Appellant Department of Planning 
and Permitting, City and County of Honolulu (DPP) appeals from 
the "Decision and Order Affirming in Part and Reversing in Part

and "Appellants' Final Judgment" (Judgment), both filed on 
September 28, 2022, by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit 
(circuit court).1 
This secondary appeal arises out of a Zoning Board of 
Appeals of the City and County of Honolulu (ZBA) case concerning 
Tieli Wang and Guijun Cheng's (collectively, Petitioners) 
violation of Revised Ordinances of Honolulu (ROH) § 21-
5.730(d)(2)(D)2 (1990)3 for an "[u]npermitted bed and breakfast 
or transient vacation unit . . . being advertised for rental 
periods of less than 30 consecutive days." The DPP issued a 
Notice of Violation (NOV), dated March 31, 2020, instructing the 
Petitioners to comply with the NOV within seven days upon 
receiving the NOV, and warning the Petitioners that 
noncompliance would result in the issuance of a Notice of Order 
(NOO) imposing civil fines. 
The Petitioners did not comply with the NOV, and the 
DPP subsequently issued an NOO, dated May 26, 2020. It appears 
Petitioner Wang received the NOO by certified mail with 
1 The Honorable James H. Ashford presided. 
2 The Notice of Violation cites this section as § 21-5(d)(2)(D). 
Ordinance 19-18 added § 21-5 to the ROH, and it now appears as § 21-5.730 in 
the 1990 ROH. 
3 The ROH sections quoted and cited in this summary disposition 
order are from the 1990 ROH, as amended, which were in effect at the time the 
Petitioners were given notice of their ordinance violation.

restricted delivery  on June 2, 2020. The NOO stated, in 
relevant part,  
The [DPP] inspected the above-described structure(s) and/or 
premises and found a violation of one or more ordinances of 
the City and County of Honolulu. As a result , [NOV] No. 
2020/NOV-03-133 was issued on March 31, 2020 (copy 
attached). Pursuant to the authority granted by the [ROH], 
you are hereby ordered to: 
1.  Cease and desist immediately any bed and breakfast 
and/or transient vacation unit activity, and remove 
the rental solicitation listing from your website.  
 2.  Pay a daily fine of $1,000[ ] until the violation is 
corrected. You are responsible for contacting the 
inspector . . .  to verify the corrective action.

 . . . . 
If the order is issued to more than one person, each person 
shall be jointly and severally liable for the full amount 
of any fine imposed by the order. 
This order shall become final thirty (30) days after 
mailing. Before such time, any person affected by this 
order may file an administrative appeal of any provision in 
this order. . . . The failure to appeal this order within 
the specified time may result in a waiver of the right of 
appeal. An appeal does not suspend any provision of the 
order, including the imposition of the civil fines. 
The record reflects that the DPP  mailed a letter, 
dated August 31, 2020, to  the  Petitioners. The subject line of 
this letter referenced the NOV and NOO, and "Outstanding Fine." 
It informed the Petitioners that "[a] daily fine of $1,000 is 
4 The $1,000 per day fine was assessed pursuant to ROH § 21-
5.730(c)(2)(B) (1990), which states in relevant part, 
If the [transient vacation rental] advertisement is not 
removed within seven days after receipt of the [NOV], a 
fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $10,000 per 
day will be levied against the owner or operator associated 
with the bed and breakfast home or transient vacation unit, 
for each day the advertisement is on public display beyond 
seven days from the date the [NOV] is received.

being assessed until the violation is corrected," and "[a]s of 
the date of [the] letter, daily fines in the amount of $96,000 
(96 days at $1,000/day) have accrued." 
The Petitioners subsequently corrected the violation, 
which the DPP confirmed through a second letter, dated 
December 1, 2020 (Letter). The Letter stated that "the subject 
NOV was corrected on September 21, 2020, when a follow-up search 
revealed that the advertisements associated with the website 
were removed," and "[a]lthough the violation was resolved, daily 
fines in the amount of $117,000 (117 days at $1,000/day) are due 
and owing." 
On December 28, 2020, the Petitioners filed an appeal 
of the NOO and the Letter with the ZBA. The DPP moved to 
dismiss the appeal, contending that the appeal was untimely as 
to the NOO, and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction with 
regard to the Letter. 
The ZBA issued its "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of 
Law, and Decision and Order" on November 19, 2021, in which it 
made the following findings: 
D. On May 26, 2020, DPP issued [NOO] No. 2020/NOO-146 to 
Petitioners by mailing the NOO, via the United States 
Postal Service ("USPS") certified mail with 
restricted delivery and return receipt requested, to 
two addresses that DPP determined Petitioners share. 
E. It is DPP's practice to mail one NOO to co-owners 
that share an address. When co -owners do not share 
an address, DPP's practice is to mail each owner a 
separate NOO to their individual address. When co -
owners share an address, it is DPP's practice to find

service of the NOO on one of the co-owners that share 
an address adequate. 
F. On June 2, 2020, Mr. Wang signed for NOO No. 
2020/NOO-146. 
G. NOO No. 2020/NOO-146 states that the violation must 
be corrected immediately, orders Petitioners to 
"[p]ay a daily fine of $1,000 until the violation is 
corrected," and informs Petitioners that they "are 
responsible for contacting the inspector . . . to 
verify the corrective action." 
H. NOO No. 2020/NOO-146 informs Petitioners that the NOO 
"shall become final thirty (30) days after mailing. 
Before such time, any person affected by this order 
may file an administrative appeal of any provision in 
this order. . . . The failure to appeal this order 
within the specified time may result in a waiver of 
the right to appeal." 
I. By letter dated August 31, 2020 and addressed to Mr. 
Wang and Ms. Cheng ("Lien Warning Letter"), DPP 
informed Petitioners that the daily civil fines for 
NOO No. 2020/NOO-146 totaled $96,000 and that DPP 
would record a lien on their properties if they did 
not take action to resolve the matter in 
communication with DPP within thirty days. 
 . . . . 
L. By letter dated December 1, 2020, DPP informed 
Petitioners that the civil fines accrued for NOO No. 
2020/NOO-146 totaled $117,000 because the NOO was 
issued on May 26, 2020 and the violation was 
corrected on September 21, 2020. 
M. Fines for NOO No. 2020/NOO-146 of $1000 per day 
started accruing on May 27, 2020, and accrued through 
and including September 20, 2020, which is 117 days, 
because fines accrue only in full-day increments. 
(Citations omitted.) The ZBA concluded, inter alia, that, 
G. The ZBA does not have jurisdiction over Petitioners' 
appeal of NOO No. 2020/NOO-146 because Petitioners' 
appeal was filed nearly seven months after Mr. Wang 
signed for NOO No. 2020/NOO-146 on June 2, 2020 and 
therefore is grossly untimely. 
H. The ZBA does not have jurisdiction over Petitioners' 
appeal of the DPP's December 1, 2020 letter notifying 
Petitioners of the civil fines accrued for NOO No. 
2020/NOO-146 because the letter is not an "action of

the Director" under Section 22-1 of the ZBA Rules and 
thus is not appealable to the ZBA. 
(Citations omitted.) 
The Petitioners appealed to the circuit court pursuant 
to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)  § 91-14 (2012). On appeal,  the  
Petitioners contended that the ZBA erred in concluding that it 
lacked jurisdiction over the Petitioners' case because the 
Letter was an "[a]ction of the Director," and the Petitioners' 
appeal was filed within thirty  days of the DPP's service of the 
Letter.
   5
In its Order, the circuit court concluded that: 
3. The December 1, 2020 Letter was issued by the Deputy 
Director of the DPP. While the December 1, 2020 Letter 
largely restates the contents of the NOO, it adds two new 
determinations by the DPP that had not been previously 
determined or stated to the [Petitioners]. First, the 
Deputy Director determined that the subject violation had 
been corrected on September 21, 2020. Second, it 
determined that, at the rate of $1,000 per day, the total 
fine imposed on the [Petitioners] was $117,000. Thus, 
implicitly and necessarily, the Deputy Director determined 
that the [Petitioners] had been illegally advertising the 
subject property for rent for 117 days, continuously and 
without a single day of interruption. Thus, while some of 
the contents of the December 1, 2020 Letter had already 
been determined in the NOO (i.e., the fact of illegal 
advertisement prior to the NOO, and the imposition of a 
$1,000 daily fine), the December 1, 2020 Letter constituted 
a new finding and a new order that the [Petitioners] were 
in violation for 117 separate and distinct days, leading to 
the imposition of a $117,000 fine. Therefore, the December 
1, 2020 Letter is an "action of the director" under the ZBA 
Rules, because it is necessarily an "enforcement order 
pursuant to section 8.60-2 of the Land Use Ordinance" 
thereunder. 
4. Insofar as [Petitioners] appealed the December 1, 
2020 Letter their appeal was timely. Thus, the ZBA erred, 
5 Pursuant to ROH § 21-1.40 (1990), "[a]ppeals [must] be filed 
within 30 days of the mailing or service" of an "[a]ction of the director" as 
defined by the Rules of the Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA Rules) § 21-1 
(1997).

NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
as a matter of law, in granting DPP's motion to dismiss 
with respect to the December 1, 2020 Letter. 
 . . . . 
7. Accordingly, insofar as [Petitioners] appealed NOO 
No. 2020/NOO-146, their appeal was untimely and the ZBA 
correctly granted DPP's motion to dismiss. However, 
insofar as the [Petitioners] appealed the December 1, 2020 
Letter, the ZBA erred as a matter of law in concluding that 
it did not have jurisdiction to hear that appeal. 
This appeal followed. Upon careful review of the 
record, briefs, and relevant legal authorities, and having given 
due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues 
raised by the parties, we address the DPP's points of error as 
follows: 
On appeal, the DPP contends, inter alia, that "[t]he 
[c]ircuit [c]ourt erred when it concluded that the ZBA had 
jurisdiction to hear an appeal of the December 1st Letter."6 
"Review of a decision made by the circuit court upon its review 
of an agency's decision is a secondary appeal," in which we 
"must determine whether the circuit court was right or wrong in 
its decision, applying the standards set forth in HRS § 91-
14(g)[(2012)] to the agency's decision."7 Flores v. Bd. of Land 
6 The parties do not challenge the circuit court's finding that the 
Petitioners' ZBA appeal of the NOO was not taken within the 30-day appeal 
period, and was therefore untimely pursuant to ROH § 21-1.40. 
7 HRS § 91-14(g) instructs, 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm the 
decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions 
for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the 
decision and order if the substantial rights of the 
petitioners may have been prejudiced because the

On this record, we determine that the circuit court 
was wrong in concluding that the ZBA had jurisdiction over the 
Petitioners'  appeal of the Letter.   The Letter states, in 
relevant part,  
SUBJECT: Notice of Order (NOO) No. 2020/NOO-146 
Notice of Violation (NOV) No. 2020/NOV-
03-133 
Outstanding Fine 
 . . . . 
The inspector has determined that the subject NOV was 
corrected on September 21, 2020, when a follow-up search 
revealed that the advertisements associated with the 
website were removed. Although the violation was resolved, 
daily fines in the amount of $117,000 (117 days at $1,000/  
day) are due and owing.  
Please make your check, with the NOO number noted on 
it, payable to the City and County of Honolulu. . . .  
 . . . . 
If you do not respond within 30 days from the date of 
this letter, we will place the amount of the fine 
($117,000) as an administrative lien on the property with 
foreclosure on the lien as an option for collection of the 
civil fine.  
The Letter, by its plain terms,  was not an 
"enforcement order"  or any other "[a]ction of the director" as 
defined by ZBA Rules § 21-1.   The director's "actions"  were 
taken, pursuant to ROH § 21-2.150-2  (1990),   through its issuance 8

ROH § 21-2.150-2 that was in effect at the time of the NOV and NOO's 
issuance, stated in pertinent part:  
(a) In lieu of or in addition to enforcement pursuant to 
Section 21-2.150-1, if the director determines that any 
person is violating any provision of this chapter, any 
rule adopted thereunder or any permit issued pursuant 
thereto, the director may have the person served . . . 
with a written notice of violation and order pursuant 
to this section. . . .

of the NOV and NOO. The NOV informed the Petitioners of the ROH 
§ 21-5.730(d)(2)(D)  violation, and ordered the Petitioners to 
remedy their violation by ceasing to advertise their transient 
vacation unit within seven  days  upon receiving the NOV. The NOO  
provided the Petitioners with notice of the $1,000  per day fine, 
and stated that this fine  would continue to accrue  until the 
violation was corrected.

(b) Contents of the Notice of Violation. The notice must 
include at least the following information: 
(1) Date of the notice; 
(2) The name and address of the person noticed; 
(3) The section number of the provision or rule, or the 
number of the permit that has been violated; 
(4) The nature of the violation; and 
(5) The location and time of the violation. 
(c) Contents of Order. 
(1) The order may require the person to do any or all 
of the following: 
(A) Cease and desist from the violation; 
(B) Correct the violation at the person's own expense 
before a date specified in the order; 
(C) Pay a civil fine not to exceed $1,000 in the 
manner, at the place and before the date 
specified in the order; and 
(D) Pay a civil fine not to exceed $5,000 per day for 
each day in which the violation persists beyond 
the date specified in paragraph (C), in the 
manner and at the time and place specified in the 
order. 
 . . . . 
(3) The order must advise the person that the order 
will become final 30 days after the date of its 
mailing or delivery. The order must also advise 
that the director's action may be appealed to the 
[ZBA]. 
(d) Effect of Order—Right to Appeal. The provisions of the 
order issued by the director under this section will 
become final 30 days after the date of the mailing or 
delivery of the order. The person may appeal the order 
to the [ZBA] as provided in Charter Section 6-1516. 
However, an appeal to the [ZBA] will not stay any 
provision of the order.

ROH § 21-2.150-2(e) (1990) instructs that a NOO may be 
judicially enforced through a civil action: "The director may 
institute a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction 
for the enforcement of any order issued pursuant to this 
section." (Emphasis added.) The Letter informed the 
Petitioners that failure to respond to the Letter within thirty 
days could result in a civil action for imposition of an 
administrative lien on the property and a foreclosure action on 
the lien. The Letter thus notified the Petitioners that the DPP 
could initiate an enforcement action in thirty days, pursuant to 
ROH § 21-2.150-2(e), "in any court of competent jurisdiction"; 
the Letter did not itself constitute an enforcement action. 
Hoku Lele, LLC v. City and County of Honolulu, 
129  Hawaiʻi 164, 296 P.3d 1072 (App. 2013), is instructive. In 
Hoku Lele, this court explained  that,  
By expanding its definition of "actions of the director," 
the ZBA Rules could have granted the ZBA the power to 
review a broader range of the director's functions, such as 
the director's issuance of responses to zoning verification 
requests. Instead, howe ver, the ZBA Rules expressly limit 
its jurisdiction to deciding appeals from four specifically 
enumerated actions, none of which apply to the director's 
letters in this case. 
Id. at 169, 296 P.3d at 1077 (emphasis added). 
For the foregoing reasons, we conclude  on this 
secondary appeal  that the circuit court erred in vacating the 
ZBA's dismissal of  the  Petitioners' appeal for lack of 
jurisdiction. We therefore reverse the circuit court's Order
