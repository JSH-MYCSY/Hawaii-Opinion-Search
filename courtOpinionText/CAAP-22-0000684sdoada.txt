After missed contacts with the drug court supervisor, missed counseling sessions, relapsed drug use, and Jarnesky's absenting himself from Aloha House without authorization, and after further proceedings including a stipulated facts trial, the Circuit Court found an adequate factual basis existed to find Jarnesky guilty on the charges in 2CPC-18-0000630.

imprisonment, with the terms to be served consecutively. 
Jarnesky timely appealed. 
Jarnesky raises a single point of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in sentencing Jarnesky to consecutive five-year terms in the two criminal cases, for a total of ten years. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Jarnesky's point of error as follows: 
Jarnesky argues that the Circuit Court abused its 
discretion by: (1) ordering consecutive sentences when Jarnesky was simply trying to care for his dying father; and (2) not articulating its own reasoning during sentencing, but simply adopting the State's argument, citing State v. Hussein
, 122 
Hawai#i 495, 509, 229 P.3d 313, 327 (2010), for the proposition 
that a court must state its reasons as to why a consecutive, not concurrent, sentence was required. 
A sentencing court is afforded wide latitude in the 
selection of penalties from those prescribed and in the determination of their severity. Rapozo v. State
, 150 Hawai#i 
66, 81, 497 P.3d 81, 96 (2021). Sentencing courts must consider the factors in HRS § 706-606. However, the weight given to the factors in HRS § 706-606 in imposing a sentence is generally left to the discretion of the sentencing court, taking into 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
consideration the circumstances of each case. See State v. Kong, 
131 Hawai# i 94, 101, 315 P.3d 720, 727 (2013). Hussein requires 
a court to state on the record the reasons for why it sentenced a defendant to consecutive, and not concurrent, terms of imprisonment. 
Hussein, 122 Hawai# i at 509, 229 P.3d at 327. 
First, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not abuse 
its discretion by not giving greater weight to Jarnesky's explanation for why he left the Maui Drug Court Program, that he needed to take care of his terminally-ill father. 
The court 
pointed out that Jarnesky left the rehabilitation program for seven months with no contact to the Maui Drug Court, and that if he was interested in coming back to the program, he should have come back or contacted the Maui Drug Court, which he did not. In State v. Kahapea
, the Hawai#i Supreme Court stated that medical 
circumstances are not compulsory mitigators for sentencing. 111 Hawai#i 267, 281, 141 P.3d 440, 454 (2006). In 
State v. 
Williams, the defendant moved for reconsideration of his sentence and requested he be released on probation so he could return to New York to care for his seriously ill mother. 70 Haw. 566, 567, 777 P.2d 1192, 1193 (1989). The supreme court rejected defendant's request for early release, stating: 
[A]lthough Williams's presence in New York might benefit his
ailing mother, he may be a good candidate for probation, andprobation might best rehabilitate him, Williams has offeredno substantial grounds for not reimposing the originalsentence. 
Id. at 571, 777 P.2d at 1195. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Jarnesky offers no authority supporting his contention 
that the court must "show mercy" by reinstating his probation. 
Under the circumstances of this case, we cannot conclude that the Circuit Court abused its discretion by failing to be persuaded by this argument. 
Here, the Circuit Court viewed Jarnesky's violation of 
the Maui Drug Court Program as egregious, noting "you absconded from the program for months with no contact to the Drug Court . . . . [I]f you were interested in coming back you should come back, and you did not. No contact. Seven months. Seven months out of contact." The court stated its reasons for imposing a consecutive prison term as follows: 
For all the reasons that the prosecutor set out, and
considering all of the considerations and factors set out in
HRS Sec -- Section 706-606, including nature andcircumstances of the offense, your history, yourcharacteristics. 
These are serious offenses, and when the Court
reimposed sentences of probation, as you are asking, that
being a slap in the face of this Court of its efforts to try
and rehabilitate you, to provide you services in thecommunity, it would not promote respect for the law. It would not provide just punishment for the offenses thatyou've committed.
It would not afford adequate deterrence to further
criminal conduct. There's a need to impose jail time toprotect the public from your further offenses.
And at this time we've, frankly, exhausted all efforts
to provide you rehabilitative services in the community. 
In Kong, the supreme court held the following 
statements by a sentencing judge sufficient to satisfy the 
requirement set in Hussein: 
Taking into consideration all of the factors set forth
in [HRS §] 706–606, including the extensive record of the
defendant, which includes six burglary convictions, . . .ten felonies, which represents a lot of harm in ourcommunity. 
7  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Court is going to impose the following sentence in
this matter. The defendant will be committed to the care 
and custody of the Director of the Department of PublicSafety for a period of ten years on Count 1, five years onCount 2. 
. . . . 
In view of his extensive criminality, the Court is going to
make these counts run consecutive for a total of fifteen years,
mittimus forthwith, full credit for time served. 
I will order that he be given an opportunity to
participate in the Cash Box drug treatment program at theearliest convenience of the Department of Public Safety. 
131 Hawai#i at 99, 315 P.3d at 725. In upholding the lower 
court's sentencing order, the supreme court explained: 
[T]he sentencing court is not required to articulate
and explain its conclusions with respect to every factorlisted in HRS § 706–606. Rather, 'it is presumed that asentencing court will have considered all factors beforeimposing concurrent or consecutive terms of imprisonmentunder HRS § 706–606.' Thus, the sentencing court isrequired to articulate its reasoning only with respect tothose factors it relies on in imposing consecutivesentences. 
Id. at 102, 315 P.3d at 728 (citations omitted). The supreme 
court continued, stating that although Hussein required that a court articulate its reasons for imposing a consecutive sentence on the record during sentencing, the examples Hussein provided were illustrative, and that the critical question is whether the circuit court articulated a "meaningful rationale" for the sentence in light of the factors set forth in HRS § 706–606. See 
id. at 103-04, 315 P.3d at 729-30. In Kong, the supreme court concluded that the circuit court's reasoning of "'extensive criminality', sufficiently justified the imposition of a consecutive sentence", and satisfied Hussein. Id. at 104, 315 
P.3d at 730 (brackets omitted). 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In this case, the Circuit Court made extensive 
statements at an October 6, 2022 sentencing hearing explaining 
its reasons for imposing consecutive sentences on Jarnesky. The court noted its prior attempts to rehabilitate Jarnesky and to provide him services in the community and the times the court reimposed probation after it was breached. The court considered the HRS § 706-606 factors and weighed them, including Jarnesky's history, characteristics, and the nature of the offenses. Further, the court noted that further probation would not be adequate deterrent to further criminal conduct, nor would it protect the public from Jarnesky's further offenses. The explanation given by the court here regarding the reasons for imposing consecutive terms of imprisonment is consistent with the explanation the supreme court found satisfied Hussein in Kong. Thus, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Jarnesky to two consecutive five-year terms of imprisonment. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's August 10, 2023 
Amended Judgment is affirmed.
