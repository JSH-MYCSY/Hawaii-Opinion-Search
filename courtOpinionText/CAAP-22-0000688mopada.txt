the Second Circuit ( circuit court) in Case No. 2CPC -20-0000557. 
In CAAP-23-0000292, which this court has consolidated 
with CAAP -22-0000688, Plaintiff -Appellant State of Hawai ʻi 
(State) appeals from the February 16, 2023 "[FOFs], [COLs], and

Dismissal with Prejudice" (2023 Order ), filed by the circuit 
court in Case No. 2CPC-22-0000657. 1 
I. Background2 
On July 30, 2017, the complaining witness ( CW) 
reported to the Maui Police Department ( MPD) that she had been 
sexually assaulted earlier that day. MPD initiated a police 
investigation, the CW submitted to a sexual assault examination 
by a medical professional , and a Hawaii Sexual Assault Evidence 
Collection Kit was submitted as evidence in the case . The CW 
gave a recorded statement to an MPD Officer (Officer), in the 
Officer's patrol car at the Maui Memorial Hospital parking lot . 
The Officer wrote an incident report and submitted his digital 
recording as evidence in the case. Smith's defense counsel 
1 The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided in both underlying cases . 
2 The background facts set forth herein are taken from the circuit 
court's FOFs in the 2022 Order and 2023 Order, and are uncontested by the 
parties.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
received a copy of this recorded interview in the ordinary 
discovery process. 
The CW was separately interviewed on July 30, 2017 by 
an MPD Detective (Detective ). The Detective's report 
represented that the Detective's interview of the CW was also 
conducted at the Maui Memorial Hospital parking lot . No 
recording of t he Detective's interview of the CW was submitted 
into evidence, and t here is no indication that th e interview was 
recorded. 
On August 1, 2017, the Detective interviewed a witness 
to the alleged sexual assault, Amy Schooping (Schooping ). The 
Detective prepared a written report with a detailed summary of 
the interview. Schooping's interview was recorded ; however, a 
copy of the Schooping recording w as not submitted into evidence 
at the time . The recording was later recovered by MPD. 
On August 4, 2017, the Detective conducted a telephone 
interview with another witness, Jeffery Johnson (Johnson). 
There is no indication that Johnson's interview was recorded, 
and the Detective did not submit a recording of Johnson's 
interview into evidence. 
Smith was made aware of the investigation, retained 
counsel, and submitted to a buccal swab on December 1, 2017. 
Smith was not arrested at this time . Evidence, including 
Smith's buccal swab , was submitted to the Sorenson Forensics Lab 
3   
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
     
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for analysis, which submitted its results on January 30, 2018. 
The test results found no DNA or other evidence. 
The evidence was then submitted to the Honolulu Police 
Department Scientific Investigative Section for additional 
scientific examination. This testing was completed on April 17, 
2019, and also found no DNA or other evidence. 
In January 2019, during the pendency of the 
investigation, Smith moved to California. 
On November 2, 2020, t he State filed its Indictment in 
2CPC-20-0000557 (2020 Indictment ). The 2020 Indictment charged 
Smith with two counts of Sexual Assault in the Second Degree, in 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 707-731(1)(a) , (b) 
(2014). 
On February 8, 2022, Smith was arrested by California 
law enforcement on a Hawaiʻi arrest warrant.  There is no record 
that the State attempted to locate Smith prior to his February 
2022 arrest. Smith posted bail in California and Hawaiʻi, 
remained out on bond, and was permitted by the court to continue 
residing in California. 
On April 20, 2022, Smith was arraigned on the charges 
in 2CPC-20-0000557. Smith filed "[Smith's] Request for 
Discovery and for Disclosure of All Exculpatory Evidence and 
Incorporated Statement of Authority " the next day . The State 
provided discovery materials to Smith in April and May of 2022 ,

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
which included written summaries of the statements made by 
Schooping and Johnson. 
On June 9, 2022, Smith filed his "Motion to Dismiss 
for Violation of [HRPP Rule 48] and for Violation of the Sixth 
Amendment Right to a Speedy Trial" ( Motion to Dismiss ). The 
circuit court heard Smith's Motion to Dismiss in June and August 
2022. After the June 2022 hearing, the State hand -delivered to 
defense counsel the recorded statement of the CW, which had been 
submitted as evidence by the MPD Officer who took the statement , 
and two other disks containing discovery material. 
On August 29, 2022, the circuit court entered its 2022 
Order, which granted Smith's Motion to Dismiss without prejudice 
for violation of HRPP Rule 48, and denied Smith's Motion to 
Dismiss for violation of the constitutional right to a speedy 
trial. The circuit court gave the State a deadline of 
September 9, 2022 to re -indict Smith. 
Smith timely appealed the 2022 Order. Smith's appeal 
of the 2022 Order was docketed as CAAP -22-0000688. On appeal, 
Smith alleges that the circuit court erred in not dismissing the 
case with prejudice after finding a violation of HRPP Rule 48 , 
and in concluding that his constitutional right to a speedy 
trial was not violated. 
On September 9, 2022, t he State filed a new Indictment 
in 2CPC-22-0000657 (2022 Indictment ). The 2022 Indictment re-
5   
 
   
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
charged Smith with the same two counts of Sexual Assault in the 
Second Degree. 
On September 27, 2022, Smith filed a Motion to Compel 
Discovery requesting, inter alia, that the recorded statements 
of Schooping and Johnson be turned over to defense counsel. The 
circuit court granted Smith's Motion to Compel Discovery in 
part. As to the requested recordings, the circuit court adopted 
the deputy prosecuting attorney 's (DPA) representation that 
there were no recorded statements of Schooping and Johnson that 
were turned into evidence. The circuit court left open the 
possibility of revisi ting the issue if any recordings were 
located. The circuit court ordered the State to provide the 
investigative notes related to Schooping and Johnson's 
statements to the defense by October 28, 2022 , and, if no such 
notes existed, that the State notify the defense of this. The 
circuit court further ordered that , except for the discovery 
issue, the proceedings in 2CPC-22-0000657 would be stayed 
pending the outcome of Smith's appeal from the 2022 Order in 
CAAP-22-0000688. 
On the October 28, 2022 discovery deadline, the State 
communicated with the defense that the Detective who interviewed 
Schooping and Johnson was on extended medical leave and not 
responding to his supervisor's inquiries. The State 
6   
 
  
 
 
   
  
 
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
communicated that it could not provide any information as to 
whether any  interview  notes  still exist or  ever existed.  
On November 1, 2022, Smith filed a Motion for Order to 
Show Cause as to why the State should not be held in contempt 
for its noncompliance with the circuit court's order to turn 
over notes of Schooping and Johnson's interviews. Smith asked 
the circuit court to hold the State in contempt and impose the 
sanction of dismissal of the case with prejudice. 
On November 3, 2022, the State communicated to the 
defense that on November 2, 2022 , the Detective's supervisor had 
spoken with the Detective , who was on medical leave, and that 
the Detective had informed the supervisor that the Detective 
does not retain notes after completing reports. The State 
further communicated to the defense that the State was able to 
locate an audio and visual recording of Schooping's August 1, 
2017 statement with the assistance of a second MPD detective . 
The recording was located on an MPD computer hard drive, and the 
recording was provided to defense counsel on November 18, 2022. 
In January 2023, the circuit court heard argument on  
the Motion for Order to Show Cause,  and  whether dismissal with 
prejudice was the proper sanction for the State's discovery violation.   At the hearing, the circuit court expressed concern 
regarding the State's noncompliance with its discovery order:  
This is a five -year-old case. It went through a 
dismissal once. We're back again. I issued an order and 
7   
 
  
 
 
  
 
    
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
said, do this. And [defense counsel] is absolutely 
correct. I don't blame the [DPA]. You can only turn over 
what you got. 
But this idea that they go through and –-I'm like 
flabbergasted. I truly am. Five years and they know –-
it's a sex assault case. [Defense counsel] described it, 
common vernacular is a –-it's a rape case, and they're 
only finding things now? I've got to tell you, that's just 
not acceptable. That's just –-that just is not 
acceptable. That's hiding the ball. Whether it's 
intentional or negligent, unintentional, just a mistake, 
it's hiding the ball. And if –-there's got to be a 
consequence to that. 
And this idea is, well, I exclude the witness. But 
he may be helpful to the defense. You're just assuming 
that it's not going to –-now all of a sudden this other 
critical witness, who's an eyewitness to something, is –-
comes out of the woodwork, but not really out of the 
woodwork because the State always had the evidence in its 
possession. That's evidence. You can call it whatever you 
want, but that's evidence in this case. And they only find 
it now? 
 . . . . 
. . . It's five years this [CW] has been dragged 
through this process, and now we're going at it again when 
someone says, well, we have this –-now all of a sudden 
this secret archive –-this is like the Vatican, for God's 
sakes. The secret archive has been discovered, and now we 
know that the police department has a secret archive where 
things are somewhere -– stored sometimes. 
Well, who had access –-I mean, look, . . . [the 
second MPD detective] has testified more times in this 
courtroom than anybody else that I can think of. And, you 
know, I've got to tell you, he carries a lot of weight and 
credibility around here. And he went to the extra effort, 
but we've got the investigating office r who can't remember 
things, doesn't take notes. Okay. Well, if that's the way 
he wants to conduct his investigations, there's an impact 
when he gets on the witness stand over the quality of the – 
-of the investigation. 
 . . . . 
. . . I . . . find that the [MPD] did not turn over 
critical evidence that it had in its possession. Thanks to 
the exceptional work of . . . [the second MPD detective], 
with his 25 years of experience, he actually found 
something. 
But at some point, there needs to be a consequence to 
the action because just not –-and it doesn't really make 
any difference whether it's exculpatory or not. Defendant

needs to prepare. This is a very hotly contested case, and 
now all of a sudden there's an eyewitness who shows up only 
after the first matter is dismissed, after years went by 
where there was no indictment brought forth. I –-there 
just needs to be a consequence. 
(Emphasis added.) 
On February 16 , 2023, the circuit court entered its 
2023 Order dismissing the 2022 Indictmen t with prejudice . The 
State appealed the 2023 Order , and this appeal was docketed as 
CAAP-23-0000292. The State raises a single point of error on 
appeal, contending that the circuit court abused its discretion 
by dismissing the charges against Smith with prejudice. 
This court consolidated Smith's appeal in CAAP -22-
0000688 with the State's appeal in CAAP -23-0000292. We address 
the points of error raised in both appeals as follows. 
II. Discussion 
We review the circuit court's ruling on a motion to 
dismiss an indictment for abuse of discretion. State v. 
Thompson , 150 Hawaiʻi 262, 266, 500 P.3d 447, 451 (2021) . "The 
trial court abuses its discretion when it clearly exceeds the 
bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles of law or 
practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." Id. 
(citations omitted). 
We review question s of constitutional law under the 
right/wrong standard. State v. Visintin , 143 Hawaiʻi 143, 152, 
426 P.3d 367, 376 (2018) (cit ations omitted).

A. 2CPC-20-0000557 
Smith contends that the circuit court erred in 
dismissing the charges brought against Smith  in 2CPC-20-0000557  
without  prejudice. Smith raises two principle points of error 
in this regard, contending that the circuit court erred in: (1) 
its application of the three factors adopted in State v. 
Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 625 P.2d 1040 (1981),  to determine  
whether to dismiss a  case with or without prejudice for 
violation of HRPP Rule 48(b); and (2) "not dismissing  the 
charges against  . . .  Smith for the violation of his  
constitutional  rights"  to a speedy trial guaranteed under the 
United States Constitution and in article I, section 14 of the 
Constitution of the State of Hawaiʻi. We address these points in 
turn.  
1. HRPP Rule 48 
"The purpose of [HRPP] Rule 48 is to ensure an accused 
a speedy trial, which is separate and distinct from his 
constitutional protection to a speedy trial." Estencion , 
63 Haw. at 268, 625 P.2d at 1043 (footnote omitted) . In 
Estencion , the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court adopted the following test 
to guide a trial court's exercise of discretion in dismissing 
charges with or without prejudice for a HRPP Rule 48 violation : 
In determining whether to dismiss the case with or without 
prejudice, the court shall consider, among others, each of 
the following factors: the seriousness of the offense ; the 
facts and the circumstances of the case which led to the 
10   
 
  
 
 
  
     
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
dismissal ; and the impact of a reprosecution on the 
administration of this chapter and on the administration of 
justice. 
Id. at 269, 625 P.2d at 1044 (quoting Federal Speedy Trial Act, 
18 U.S.C.A. § 3162(a)(1) (West 1969 & Supp. 1980)). 
The circuit court, applying the Estencion factors to 
this case , concluded: 
8. The seriousness of the offense in the instant case 
weighs heavily in favor of the State and a dismissal 
without prejudice . 
9. The circumstance that led to the dismissal here is 
the [State's] failure to make any effort to locate [Smith], 
irrespective of the fact that he was residing in 
California, [this] weighs in favor of a dismissal with 
prejudice . 
10. The fact that this is a very serious charge and 
once the matter was brought to the attention of this court, 
all parties acted diligently in addressing the issue , and 
the State agreed to promptly refile this matter, strongly 
favors allowing re -prosecution in the administration of 
justice. 
(Emphasis added.) 
As to the first Estencion factor, the circuit court's 
assessment of Sexual Assault in the Second Degree as 
constituting a "serious" offense did not exceed the bounds of 
reason. As to the second factor, the circuit court acknowledged 
that the State's "failure to make any effort to locate [Smith], 
irrespective of the fact that he was residing in California " in 
fact "weighs in favor of a dismissal with prejudice." (Emphasis 
added.) And, with regard to the third factor, the circuit court 
did not abuse its discretion in determining that the 
"administration of justice" favored reprosecution because "this 
11   
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
       
       
         
      
       
 
          
    
  
    
 
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
is a very serious charge" and "all parties acted diligently in 
addressing the issue." 
We therefore conclude that the circuit court did not 
abuse its discretion in applying the Estencion factors, and in 
dismissing the charges brought against Smith in 2CPC -20-0000557 
without prejudice on that basis. 
2. Constitutional Right to a Speedy Trial 
Both the Sixth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution and article I, section 14 of the Hawaiʻi 
Constitution guarantee a defendant in a criminal case the right 
to a speedy trial in all prosecutions. State v. Lau, 78 Hawaiʻi 
54, 62, 890 P.2d 291, 299 (1995). Courts consider the four 
factors articulated in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972) in 
determining whether a defendant's constitutionally protected 
right to a speedy trial has been violated . Those four factors 
are: "(1) length of the delay; (2) reasons for the delay; (3) 
defendant's assertion of his right to speedy trial; and (4) 
prejudice to the defendant." Lau, 78 Hawaiʻi at 62, 890 P.2d at 
299 (citing Barker, 407 U.S. at 530). 
None of the four Barker factors "is to be regarded as 
either a necessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a 
deprivation of the right to a speedy trial." Id. (cleaned up ). 
The factors are related "and must be considered together with 
such circumstances as may be relevant." Id. (cleaned up ). 
12   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"When a defendant's right to a speedy trial has been violated, 
the only remedy is dismissal with prejudice."   Visintin, 
143  Hawaiʻi  at  157, 426 P.3d at  381  (citation omitted).   
In applying the Barker factors, the circuit court 
concluded: 
14. The length of the delay favors [Smith's] 
assertion of a Speedy Trial violation. 
15. Although [Smith] was residing out of state, the 
overall responsibility for the delay in this case was the 
State's failure to look for [Smith]. This factor favors 
[Smith]. 
16. [Smith] did not assert his right [to] a Speedy 
Trial until this Motion [to Dismiss] was filed. This 
factor favors the State . 
17. The most decisive factor when evaluating a 
possible violation of Speedy Trial is the prejudice to the 
Defendant. When evaluating prejudice, there are three 
factors to consider: to prevent oppressive pre -trial 
incarceration; to minimize anxiety and co ncern of the 
accused; and to limit the possibility that the defense will 
be impaired. State v. Almeida , 54 Haw. 443 , 448, 509 P.2d 
549, 552 (1973); citing, Barker . . . . This factor 
favor[]s the State. 
18. [Smith] has not suffered any oppressive pre -trial 
incarceration. Arguably there was anxiety of the accused, 
however, that exists in any criminal case, therefore this 
case does not stand out. There is nothing to support that 
the defense has been impaired at this juncture. 
(Emphasis added .) 
Here, the circuit court's conclusions that the first 
two Barker  factors weigh in Smith's favor are unchallenged. At 
issue, therefore, is whether the circuit court erred in 
concluding that the third and fourth factors weigh in favor of 
the State and, if so, whether the circuit court was wrong in 
concluding that Smith's constitutional rights were not violated. 
13   
 
   
  
 
  
 
   
  
 
  
    
 
   
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We review these questions de novo. See Visintin , 143 Hawaiʻi at 
152, 426 P.3d at 376 (citations omitted). 
The circuit court concluded that the third Barker 
factor weighed in favor of the State because Smith "did not 
assert his right [to] a Speedy Trial until this Motion [to 
Dismiss] was filed ." This cursory conclusion implies that Smith 
failed to timely "assert his right" to a speedy trial because he 
did not move to dismiss his charges until June 2022. This does 
not accurately reflect the record . 
The record reflects that the alleged offense occurred 
on July 30, 2017, the 2020 Indictment charging Smith was filed 
on November 2, 2020 , and Smith was arrested in California on 
February 8, 2022. The record thus reflects a period of 
approximately 15 months between the filing of the 2020 
Indictment and Smith's arrest. During this time, it appears 
that the State did not make efforts to locate and arrest Smith. 
It further appears that Smith was unaware of the 2020 Indictment 
and the arrest warrant until he was arrested in February 2022. 
The record reflects , moreover, that Smith moved to 
dismiss the Indictment on June 9, 202 2, a mere 50 days – less 
than 2 months – after his arraignment on April 20, 2022 . See 
Visintin , 143 Hawaiʻi at 161, 426 P.3d at 385 (finding that 
defendant "raised the issue of speedy trial as soon as was 
practicable under the circum stances" where defendant filed a 
14   
 
    
  
   
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds  within  two weeks of 
his arraignment). On this basis, we determine that the circuit 
court erred in concluding  that Smith did not "assert his right 
to a Speedy Trial."  
With regard to the fourth Barker  factor, we determine 
that the circuit court did not err  in concluding, on the record 
before it, that "[t]here is nothing to support that the defense 
has been impaired at this juncture." The circuit court did  err, 
however,  in concluding that "[t]he most decisive factor when 
evaluating a possible violation of Speedy Trial is the prejudice 
to the Defendant." Even if the fourth Barker  factor weighed in 
favor of the State, that factor should have been properly  
balanced with the first three factors that  weigh in Smith's 
favor.  
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the circuit 
court's Order in Case No. 2CPC-20-0000557. We instruct the 
circuit court, on remand, to make such FOFs and COLs as 
necessary to demonstrate its full consideration , and proper 
balancing, of all four Barker factors. 
 B. 2CPC-22-0000657  
The State contends that the circuit court erred in 
dismissing the charges brought against Smith in 2CPC -22-0000657 
with prejudice. 
15   
 
  
 
   
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The following FOFs and COLs set forth the circuit 
court's basis for dismissing  the 2022 Indictment with prejudice:  
[FOF] 36.   Following the hearing on January 10, 2023, 
this Court found that although not faulting the [DPA]  
personally as the Defense had argued, the [MPD's]  and by 
extension the [DPA's]  possession of the recording for five 
years before turning it over was not acceptable.  
[FOF] 37.  With regard to the belatedly provided 
recording of  [the]  Amy Schooping interview, this Court 
stat[ed]: "whether intentional, negligent, unintentional or 
just a mistake it's hiding the ball." It doesn't matter whether the evidence is inculpatory of exculpatory. The 
delay in providing limited the Defense's ability to 
prepare. The Court added: "I . . . find that the [MPD]  did 
not turn over critical evidence that it had in its possession. . . . [T]here needs to be a consequence to that action."  
[FOF] 38. The Court finds that the appropriate 
remedy for this is a Dismissal with Prejudice because: 1) The State (MPD) had the evidence for over 5 years, knew the 
importance of this case, and simply failed to turn over 
evidence that it knew it had without reason or explanation; 2) the Court cannot say that the withholding of this 
evidence by the police has not prejudiced the [defendant] 
in both cases regardless of its contents.  
 . . . . 
[COL] 9. [Smith] in this case is entitled to the 
whole truth -not some surgically constructed or manufactured 
"truth" that suits only the government's erroneous theory of the case. Brady  [v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83,] 87- 88 
[(1963)]. Complete and unadulterated disclosures are 
required to the fullest extent of the mandate s  of Rule 16, 
Brady, and its progeny. See[]  e.g.[,] United States v. 
Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 106  . . .  (1976) ("When the prosecutor 
receives a specific and relevant request, failure to make any response is seldom, if ever, excusable.").  
 . . . . 
[COL] 11. The Court has broad discretion to 
alleviate discovery violations (HRPP Rule 16(e)(9)(i); 
State v. David, 134 Hawaiʻi 289, 297, 339 P.3d[] 1090, 1098 
(2014)) and the Court deems the appropriate remedy is a 
dismissal with prejudice.  
[COL] 12. The Court has considered alternative 
remedies but concludes as a matter of law that failure to 
provide a simple statement to the defense regardless of its 
content for 5 years must bear a significant consequence. 
The claim of MPD of a recent "discovery" of  this material 
16   
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Court finds incredulous. The defense should be 
afforded even innocuous material so a defendant can 
consider all viable options and must not be left to making 
important decisions based on the whim of an investigating 
officer. 
(Cleaned up.) 
On appeal, the State contends that FOF 38 was clearly 
erroneous  and COL 12 was wrong because the circuit court erred:  
(1) in finding "that the State failed to provide the [Schooping] 
recording to Smith for five  years"; (2) finding "that Smith 
suffered prejudice from the delay"; and (3) failing to consider 
"other less-restrictive remedies than dismissal with prejudice,"  
such as suppression of Schooping's  testimony, dismissal without 
prejudice, and referral of the  DPA  for disciplinary action.   
A discovery violation can . . . constitute a so -called 
Brady violation, which infringes upon the defendant's due 
process right to a fair trial. The suppression by the 
[DPA] of evidence favorable to the accused violates due 
process where the evidence is material to guilt or 
punishment, regardless of the good faith or bad faith of 
the [DPA]. However, in order to establish a Brady 
violation, an appellant must make a showing that the 
suppressed evidence would create a reasonable doubt about 
the appellant's gu ilt that would not otherwise exist. 
State v. Fukusaku, 85 Hawaiʻi 462, 479, 946 P.2d 32, 49 (1997) 
(cleaned up).  
HRPP Rule 16, which governs discovery in criminal 
cases,  directs in relevant part that,  
Upon written request of defense counsel and specific 
designation by defense counsel of material or information 
which would be discoverable if in the possession or control 
of the prosecutor and which is in the possession or control 
of other governmental personnel, the prosecutor shall use 
diligent good faith efforts to cause such material or 
information to be made available to defense counsel ; and if 
the prosecutor's efforts are unsuccessful the court shall 
17   
 
  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
issue suitable subpoenas or orders to cause such material 
or information to be made available to defense counsel. 
HRPP Rule 16(b)(2) (emphasis added). 
The record reflects that the Schooping recording is 
not part of the record, and there is no indication that the 
circuit court reviewed the recording prior to dismissing the 
2022 Indictment. It is unclear how the circuit court could have 
determined, withou t reviewing the recording, that the recording 
was material to Smith's defens e, such that the State's delay in 
turning over the Schooping recording prejudiced the defense . 
Moreover, the  circuit court found that,  although it 
was not "faulting the [DPA] personally," "the [MPD's] and by 
extension the [DPA's] possession of the recording for five years 
before turning it over was not acceptable." On September 27, 
2022,  the defense filed a Motion to Compel Discovery requesting 
that the circuit court compel disclosure of the recorded 
interview with Schooping. The State located and turned over the 
recording to the defense on November 18, 2022.   It appears that 
the recording was in MPD's possession, the Detective who made the recording was unavailable due to medical reasons, and a 
second MPD detective was able to locate a copy of the recording.   
We determine that the circuit court erred in failing to examine 
whether, under these circumstances,  the DPA in fact used 
"diligent good faith efforts" to locate and make the recording 
available to Smith.

We therefore vacate the circuit court's 2023 Order, 
and instruct the circuit court on remand to make appropriate 
FOFs and COLs as to whether, under these circumstances, the 
State violated Brady and/or HRPP Rule 16 by not turning the 
Schooping recording over to the defense prior to November 18, 
2022. 
We further instruct the circuit court, should it 
exercise its authority to impose HRPP Rule 16 sanctions,3 to make 
FOFs and COLs that clearly articulate its consideration of 
whether a less severe sanction than dismissal "would rectify 
prejudice" to Smith . In imposing HRPP Rule 16 sanctions, 
The trial court should take into account the reasons 
why the disclosure was not made, the extent of prejudice, 
if any, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a 
continuance, and any other relevant circumstances. . . . 
Before the court orders dismissal of a case because of the 
State's violation of HRPP Rule 16, it must consider whether 
less severe measures would rectify prejudice caused to the 
defendant by the violation.

1994) (cleaned up) . 
Finally, if the circuit court determines that 
dismissal is warranted, it  should make sufficient FOFs and COLs 
3 It appears that the circuit court, while determining that the 
State violated both Brady and HRPP Rule 16, imposed sanctions pursuant to 
HRPP Rule 16. HRPP Rule 16(e)(9)(i) provides: 
If at any time during the course of the proceedings 
it is brought to the attention of the court that a party 
has failed to comply with this rule or an order issue d 
pursuant thereto, the court may order such party to permit 
the discovery, grant a continuance, or it may enter such 
other order as it deems just under the circumstances.

to clearly articulate its basis for dismissing the case with or 
without prejudice . 
III. Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the circuit 
court's 2022 Order in 2CPC -20-0000557, and remand for further 
proceedings to determine, consistent with this memorandum 
opinion, whether Smith's constitutional right to a speedy trial 
was violated. We further vacate the circuit court's 2023 Order 
in 2CPC-22-0000657, and remand for further proceedings 
consistent with this memorandum opinion . We note that a circuit 
court finding of a speedy trial violation in 2CPC-20-0000557 
would render further proceedings in 2CPC -22-0000657 unnecessary 
on mootness grounds .
