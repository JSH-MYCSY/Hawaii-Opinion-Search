IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I 
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
SHANNON KAINOA RYSER KEALA, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
KONA DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 3DTC-22-061452) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that Defendant-
Appellant Shannon Ryser, a.k.a., Shannon Kainoa Ryser Keala 
(
Ryser) appeals from the District Court of the Third Circuit's 
(district court) October 20, 2022 Judgment and Notice of Entry of 
Judgment, which dismissed one of three charges in this case, 
October 20, 2022 Order and Notice of Entry of Order, which ordered Ryser to return to court for a pre-trial conference, or from the purported "final judgment" of the district court's "claim of personal jurisdiction" over Ryser. We conclude that the court lacks appellate jurisdiction because the district court has not entered a final decision or a final judgment. Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 641-12 (2016);

482, 490, 403 P.3d 259, 267(2017). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
