IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI‘I 
IN THE INTEREST OF O.H., Minor-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(FC-J No. 0116260) 
 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
This appeal challenges whether the family court 
correctly applied self-defense under Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 703-304(1)  in a juvenile trial for abuse of a family 
member. We vacate and remand for a new trial.

1 HRS § 703-304(1) (2014), entitled "Use of force in self-
protection" (self-defense), provides that "the use of force upon or toward 
another person is justifiable when the actor believes that such force is 
immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting himself against the use 
of unlawful force by the other person on the present occasion." (Emphasis

Minor-Appellant O.H. (Minor) appeals from the 
September 19, 2022 "Decree Re: Law Violation Petition(s)" 
(Decree), and October 17, 2022 "Order Denying Motion for 
Reconsideration of Disposition Filed October 5, 2022" (Order 
Denying Reconsideration), both filed by the Family Court of the 
First Circuit (Family Court).
2  The Family Court filed its 
December 23, 2022 "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law" 
(FOFs/COLs), after Minor filed this appeal. See
 Hawaiʻi Family 
Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 52(a). 
On appeal, Minor contends that the Family Court 
erred by: (1) "
interpret[ing] HRS § 703-304(1) as requiring 
that 'unlawful force' must in fact be used against a juvenile 
before the juvenile may utilize self-defense[,]" and challenging 
FOF 42, COLs 19 and 20; and (2) "wrongly appl[ying] the 
objective prong of HRS § 703-304(1) self-defense analysis by 
inadequately considering Minor's conduct from Minor's 
perspective" in its alternative ruling, and challenging various 
FOFs and COLs. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Minor's 
contentions as follows. 
The following background is from the Family Court's 
unchallenged FOFs, following a September 19, 2022 bench trial on 
appellee State of Hawaiʻi's (State) Petition charging Minor for 
added.) "'Believes' means reasonably believes." HRS § 703- 300 (2014).  
"'Unlawful force' means force which is employed without the consent of the 
person against whom it is directed and the employment of which constitutes an 
offense or would constitute an offense except for a defense not amounting to 
a justification to use the force." Id.

Abuse of Family or Household Members (Abuse) in violation of HRS 
§ 709-906(1).3  On June 13, 2022, Minor's mother (Mother) was in 
the driver's seat operating her vehicle, and Minor was in the 
passenger's seat. FOF 13. Mother and Minor were arguing when 
Mother stopped the vehicle at the red light, and asked Minor 
three times "to give up her cell phone as a consequence of being 
sassy[.]" FOFs 18-21. Minor did not comply, and continued to 
use her cellphone. FOFs 22-23. While stopped at the traffic 
light, Mother reached for Minor's cellphone, and Minor leaned 
away from Mother. FOF 24. Mother reached around Minor's back, 
put her right hand on Minor's shoulder, and "used force" to grab 
Minor's right shoulder and pull Minor closer to Mother "as a 
form of restraint or confinement." FOFs 25-26. When Mother 
was reaching for the cellphone with her left hand, "Minor bit 
Mother in her left forearm . . . leaving the area red and with a 
bite mark with teeth impressions"; and Mother "felt pain" from 
the bite mark. FOF 27, 29. A photograph of the bite mark was 
admitted into evidence. FOF 28. The Family Court found that: 
31. The Court finds Mother's recitation of events to 
be credible, and Minor's recitation of events to be not 
credible. 
32. The Court finds Minor's testimony that Mother 
struck her in the arm and was then clawing for the phone to 
be not credible. 
33. The Court finds Mother's testimony credible that 
Mother was grabbing for Minor's phone with her left hand 
while using her right hand to pull Minor closer when Minor 
bit Mother in her left forearm. 
3 HRS § 709-906(1) (2014 & 2021 Supp.), entitled "Abuse of family 
or household members; penalty," provides in pertinent part that "[i]t shall 
be unlawful for any person . . . to physically abuse a family or household 
member."

NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
34. The Court finds that Mother attempted to take 
Minor's cell phone as a form of discipline for Minor being 
sassy in the vehicle, and that Mother's actions were 
reasonable. 
The trial transcript reflects that Minor claimed self-
defense, testifying that she bit Mother "out of instinct" 
because she "was scared" when Mother "was reaching across," 
Mother's "arm was in [her] face," and that there were previous 
incidents where Mother had hit her. Minor testified that she 
"didn't know how else to defend [her]self[,]" "couldn't 
leave[,]" "couldn't stay six feet away from [Mother][,]" and 
"felt unsafe." Minor testified that during the incident she 
dialed 911 on her cellphone. Mother testified that she had hit 
Minor in the past, and sometimes to the extent where Minor's 
father had to stop Mother. 
The Family Court found in its FOFs and COLs, inter 
alia, that because "Mother's use of force was lawful, Minor's 
claim of self-defense pursuant to HRS § 703-304(1) cannot 
prevail." COL 20. The Family Court also made an alternative 
ruling, holding that: "Alternatively, even if self-defense 
[wa]s applicable," COL 22, "it was not objectively reasonable 
based upon a reasonable person standard for Minor to bite Mother 
on her left forearm when Mother was merely pulling Minor closer 
with her right hand while reaching for Minor's cell phone." COL 
26. 
The Family Court adjudicated Minor "a law violator" of 
the Abuse offense, rejecting Minor's self-defense. 
After the denial of Minor's post-trial motion for 
reconsideration, Minor timely appealed. 
(1) Minor argues that the Family Court "wrongly 
created an exception to HRS [§] 703-304(1)" by holding that 
"Minor can use self-defense only if Mother in fact used unlawful 
4

force." Minor argues the "plain language of HRS § 703-304(1) 
permits Minor to use self-protective force if Minor 'believes 
that such force is immediately necessary for the purpose of 
protecting Minor against the use of unlawful force[,]'" and that 
"the first substantive paragraph of the Commentary on HRS § 703-
304 states that even anticipation of unlawful force is 
sufficient to trigger self-defense[.]" (Brackets omitted.) 
Minor challenges the following FOFs and COLs: 
FINDINGS OF FACT 
 . . . . 
42.
 Minor's reliance upon self-defense as a 
justification for biting Mother in her forearm does not 
prevail because Minor was not utilizing force to protect 
herself from "unlawful force" (as required) because 
Mother's actions did not constitute unlawful force but 
rather lawful force.  
 . . . . 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
 . . . . 
19.
 Mother was engaged in reasonable corporal 
discipline and utilized justifiable lawful force against 
Minor and, as such, Minor does not have the right rely 
[sic] upon self-defense to resist Mother's lawful use of 
force by responding with force against Mother because 
pursuant to HRS § 703-304(1), self-defense is only 
justifiable when force is used in response to unlawful 
force. 
20. Since the prosecution proved that Mother's use of 
force was lawful, Minor's claim of self-defense pursuant to 
HRS § 703-304(1) cannot prevail. 
(Emphases added.) 
"First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself." Barker
v. Young, 153 Hawaiʻi 144, 148, 528 P.3d 217, 221 (2023)  
5

(citation omitted). HRS § 703-304(1) allows the actor to use 
protective force when the actor reasonably believes it is 
"immediately necessary" to protect against unlawful force. The 
Commentary to HRS § 703-304(1) states that "Subsection (1) 
requires a belief by the actor that the use of protective force 
is actually necessary, and that unlawful force (defined in § 
703-300) is to be used by the assailant." (Emphases added.) 
"It is enough that unlawful force is threatened on the present 
occasion by [the] assailant." Id.
Here, the plain language of HRS § 703-304(1) does not 
require that the "force" actually be "unlawful" to qualify for 
self-defense under HRS § 703-304(1). Rather, the statute 
requires the actor "reasonably believe" that "use of protective 
force is immediately necessary" to protect themselves "against 
the use of unlawful force." Id.; HRS § 703-300. Thus, the 
Family Court was required to consider whether Minor "reasonably 
believe[d]" that the use of force was necessary to protect Minor 
from "unlawful force" -- not whether Mother's force was actually 
"unlawful" or "lawful." While we conclude the Family Court 
clearly erred when it held that self-defense under HRS § 703-
304(1) was inapplicable because Mother's force was "lawful," 
see JW v. RJ
, 146 Hawaiʻi 581, 585, 463 P.3d 1238, 1242 (App. 
2020) (applying the "clearly erroneous" standard to conclusions 
of law that present mixed questions of fact and law), this error 
was harmless because the Family Court did apply the HRS § 703
-
304 self-defense analysis in the alternative. See HFCR Rule 61. 
(2) Minor argues that in applying self-defense, "the 
Family Court wrongly applied the objective prong of the HRS 
§ 703-304(1) analysis" because it "fail[ed] to consider at all 
what a reasonable person would do under the circumstances as

49, COLs 22-23, and 26-27, which state:

3. Even if the Court were to find that Mother's use 
of force was unlawful, Minor's reliance upon self-defense 
still fails as it was not justifiable. The prosecution has 
disproved Minor's claim of self-defense beyond a reasonable 
doubt. 
44. The Court finds that Minor subjectively believed 
that she was justified in using force against [M]other 
because she was alone in the vehicle with Mother, Mother 
was pulling her closer, Mother had hit her on previous 
occasions, Mother previously caused a scar on Minor's face 
by striking her, and on previous occasions Mother had 
continued to strike Minor until stopped by Minor's Father. 
45. The Court finds that under the circumstances of 
this case, it was not objectively reasonable based upon a 
reasonable person standard for Minor to bite Mother on her 
left forearm when Mother was merely pulling Minor closer 
with her right hand while reaching for Minor's cell phone 
with her left hand even though Minor was alone in the car 
with Mother, Mother had hit Minor on previous occasions, 
Mother previously caused a scar on Minor's face by striking 
her, and Mother had previously continued to strike Minor 
until stopped by Minor's Father. 
46. Minor's use of force was not reasonable under the 
circumstances. 
47. A reasonably prudent person in these 
circumstances would not believe it was necessary to bite 
Mother's arm for self-protection. 
 . . . . 
49.
 The Court found that the material allegations in 
the Petition have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt and 
adjudicated Minor a law violator within the purview of HRS 
S 571-11(1)(2018), and the decree Re: Law Violation 
Petition(s) was filed on September 19, 2022, which included 
the Court's disposition (sentence).

22. Alternatively, even if self-defense is applicable 
in this case, the prosecution has proved facts negativing 
the defense beyond a reasonable doubt. 
23. "Self-defense is not an affirmative defense, and 
the prosecution has the burden of disproving it once 
evidence of justification has been adduced." State v. 
Culkin, 97 Hawaiʻi 206, 215, 35 P.3d 233, 242 (2001); see 
also State v. Lubong, 77 Hawaiʻi 429, 431, 886 P.2d 766, 768 
(App. 1994) ("Once the issue of self-protection is raised, 
the burden is on the prosecution to disprove the facts that 
have been introduced or to prove facts negativing the 
defense and to do so beyond a reasonable doubt." (citing 
State v. McNulty
, 60 Haw. 259, 262, 588 P.2d 438, 442 
(1978); State v. Straub
 . . . . 
, 9 Haw. App. 435, 444, 843 P.2d 
1389, 1393 (1993))). The prosecution disproved Minor's 
claim of self-defense. 
25. Pursuant to the subjective prong, Minor 
subjectively believed that she was justified in using force 
against Mother because she was alone in the vehicle with 
Mother, Mother was pulling her closer, Mother had hit her 
on previous occasions, Mother previously caused a scar on 
her face by striking her, and on previous occasions Mother 
had continued to strike Minor until stopped by Minor's 
Father. 
26. Pursuant to the objective prong, it was not 
objectively reasonable based upon a reasonable person 
standard for Minor to bite Mother on her left forearm when 
Mother was merely pulling Minor closer with her right hand 
while reaching for Minor's cell phone with her left hand 
even though Minor was alone in the car with Mother, Mother 
had hit Minor on previous occasions, Mother previously 
caused a scar on Minor's face by striking her, and on 
previous occasions Mother had continued to strike Minor 
until stopped by Minor's Father. Furthermore, the amount of 
force utilized by Minor was not reasonable under the 
circumstances. 
27. The prosecution proved all material facts in the 
Petition beyond a reasonable doubt, including that the 
Minor was not justified in relying upon self-defense and, 
as such, Minor was properly adjudicated a law violator 
within the purview of HRS § 571-11(1). 
(Emphases added.) 
"Self-defense to a criminal charge contains both a 
subjective and an objective prong: the defendant must believe 
8  
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
that force is necessary, and that belief must be reasonable." 
State v. Sandoval
, 149 Hawaiʻi 221, 237, 487 P.3d 308, 324 (2021) 
(citation omitted). "In Hawaiʻ i self-defense cases, the 
defendant's subjective belief drives an objective reasonableness 
standard. Factfinders wear the defendant's headset and 
experience the event from that reality. Then, from that 
perspective, the judge or jury evaluates the objective 
reasonableness of the defendant's subjective belief that self-
protective force was necessary." 
Interest of DM
, 152 Hawaiʻi 
469, 472, 526 P.3d 446, 449 (2023). 
In 
Interest of DM, the minor DM stabbed another minor, 
and DM argued self-defense. Id. at 471, 526 P.3d at 448. The 
supreme court held that the family court erroneously rejected 
DM's self-defense claim by "inadequately consider[ing] DM's 
perspective" and "inadequately assess[ing] the circumstances 
from DM's perspective"; and there "was not substantial evidence 
presented to support the family court's conclusion that the 
State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that DM's use of deadly 
force was unjustified." Id. at 472, 476, 478, 526 P.3d at 449, 
453, 455. 
Here, the Family Court found that Minor "credibly 
testified" that Mother had "struck her in the past" as follows: 
39. Minor credibly testified that [M]other had struck 
her in the past as follows: (a) Minor testified that on one 
occasion she was struck in the arm three times; (b) Minor 
testified that Mother had struck her on previous occasions 
until [Minor's] [f]ather stopped Mother; and (c) Minor 
testified that when she was approximately 8 years old 
Mother struck her, made her sit outside in the cold during 
winter, and that when Mother let her back in the house, 
Mother struck Minor in the face causing a scar. 
FOF 39. As to the subjective prong, the Family Court's COL 
25 stated: 
9  
  
 
 
    
  
   
 
 
  
 
   
  
  
 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
25. Pursuant to the subjective prong, Minor 
subjectively believed that she was justified in using force 
against Mother because she was alone in the vehicle with 
Mother, Mother was pulling her closer, Mother had hit her 
on previous occasions, Mother previously caused a scar on 
her face by striking her, and on previous occasions Mother 
had continued to strike Minor until stopped by Minor's 
[f]ather. 
As to the objective prong, the Family Court was then required to 
determine whether Minor's belief for the need to use force was 
reasonable "from the point of view of a reasonable person in the 
[Minor]'s position under the circumstances as [Minor] believed 
them to be." Id. at 477, 526 P.3d at 454 (citing State v.
Pemberton, 71 Haw. 466, 477, 796 P.2d 80, 85 (1990)). The 
Family Court, however, did not adequately assess the 
circumstances as Minor believed them to be in FOF 45 and COL 26, 
but instead concluded in COL 26 that Minor's use of force "was 
not objectively reasonable," by considering circumstances that 
were not part of Minor's subjective belief, i.e. by stating 
"Mother was merely pulling Minor closer with her right hand 
while reaching for Minor's cell phone with her left hand." See
id. This portion of COL 26 conflicts with FOF 44 and COL 25, 
which set forth what Minor's subjective belief was at the time 
Minor used force against Mother. FOFs 44 and COL 25 did not 
include that Mother was "merely pulling" Minor to "reach[] for 
[her] cell phone" as part of Minor's subjective belief.

(Emphasis added.) We conclude that FOF 45 and COL 26, which are 
mixed questions of fact and law, are clearly erroneous because 
they reflect an incorrect application of the objective prong of 
HRS § 703-304(1), by including a factual circumstance that was 
4 In unchallenged FOF 33, the Family Court found Mother credibly 
testified that "Mother was grabbing for Minor's phone" and that Mother had 
"pull[ed] Minor closer when Minor bit Mother."
