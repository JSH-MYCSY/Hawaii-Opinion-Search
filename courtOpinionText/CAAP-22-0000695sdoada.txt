Husband from contacting, abusing, or threatening his wife, 
Petitioner-Appellee Zona O. Ostrowski (Wife), for one year (Protective Order).

On appeal, Husband challenges the December 8, 2022 
Findings of Fact (FOFs) and Conclusions of Law (COLs), by 
contending the family court erred in FOFs 7(a)-(g), and COLs 18 
and 19, which found Wife credible and her domestic abuse allegations for the October 1, 2022 incident proven by a preponderance of the evidence, as follows: 
7. Following the trial on the Petition, . . . the 
Court finds that WIFE proved the material allegations of 
the Petition by a preponderance of the evidence as to: 
a.Allegation A: WIFE testified that on October 1,
2022 she sustained domestic abuse by HUSBAND when HUSBAND 
chased WIFE while videoing her and calling her names, 
including slut and whore. 
b.Allegation B: On October 1, 2022, WIFE fell down
when HUSBAND was chasing her while videoing her out by her 
car, WIFE sustained injuries. 
c. Allegation C: HUSBAND refused to render aid to 
WIFE during this incident on October 1, 2022. Police came 
to the scene along with an ambulance and assisted WIFE. 
d.  WIFE is afraid of HUSBAND's ongoing violent and
degrading behavior towards her. 
prevent domestic abuse or a recurrence of abuse[.]"  HRS § 586- 1 (2018 & 2024 
Supp.) defines "Domestic abuse" as "[p]hysical harm, bodily injury, assault, or the threat of imminent physical harm, bodily injury, or assault, extreme 
psychological abuse, coercive control, or malicious property damage between 
family or household members[.]" 
At a protective order hearing under HRS § 586- 5.5(a), while "the 
respondent must 'show cause why' the protective order is not necessary, . . . 
the burden remains on the petitioner to prove the petitioner's underlying 
allegations by a preponderance of the evidence." Kie v. McMahel, 91 Hawai‘ i 
438, 442, 984 P.2d 1264, 1268 (App. 1999). 
3 Although the Protective Order expired on October 18, 2023, the 
appeal is not moot, and we review this appeal under the collateral 
consequences exception. See Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem
, 119 Hawai‘i 1, 
9–10, 193 P.3d 839, 847– 48 (2008).

e.The Court finds that HUSBAND did not show good
cause why the order should not be continued. 
f. The Court finds that a protective order is 
necessary to prevent domestic abuse or recurrence of 
domestic abuse, and 
g. The Court issues an Order for Protection for a 
period of one year, is a fit and reasonable amount of time 
given the facts and circumstances of the case. 
 . . . . 
18.Following the trial on the Petition, the Court
finds that WIFE is credible and that WIFE proved the 
material allegations of the Petition by a preponderance of 
the evidence as to allegations A, B, and C, that HUSBAND failed to show good cause why the order should not be 
continued, and finds a protective order is necessary to 
prevent domestic abuse or recurrence of domestic abuse. 
19.Based on the foregoing, the Court issues an
Order for Protection for a period of one year and finds 
this to be a fit and reasonable amount of time given the facts and circumstances of the case. 
(Emphases added.) 
Upon careful review of the record and the brief 
submitted,  and having given due consideration to the arguments 
advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Husband's challenges 
as follows. 4
We conclude that FOFs 7(a)-(g), and COLs 18 and 19 
(which are mixed FOFs and COLs), are not clearly erroneous. See
In re Doe, 95 Hawai‘ i 183, 196, 20 P.3d 616, 629 (2001) ("[T]he 
question on appeal is whether the record contains 'substantial 
evidence' supporting the family court's determinations, and appellate review is thereby limited to assessing whether those determinations are supported by 'credible evidence of sufficient quality and probative value.' 
In this regard, the testimony of 
a single witness, if found by the trier of fact to have been

credible, will suffice." (citations omitted)). Reconciling 
conflicting testimony is the province of the trial court, as factfinder, and beyond the scope of appellate review. Schiller
v. Schiller, 120 
Hawai‘i 283, 288, 205 P.3d 548, 553 (App. 2009). 
Here, there was substantial evidence to support the 
family court's determination under HRS § 586–5.5(a) that the 
Protective Order was "necessary to prevent domestic abuse or a recurrence of abuse[.]" 
With regard to the October 1, 2022 
incident upon which the Protective Order was based, Wife testified that Husband "was beginning to harass me" and "started calling me names" including "slut" and "whore"; Husband chased Wife out the door "[w]ith his video camera videotaping" her; Wife "was very distraught" and fell down on the driveway; Wife was "on the ground crying" and "wanted some help or consoling[,]" but Husband "continued to videotape [her] and didn't even want to get close"; Husband "just continued to berate [her]" as she lay "face down on the ground" of their concrete driveway until police and ambulance arrived. Regarding 
whether she had "any injuries from [her] fall[,]" Wife 
testified: "I have had bruises and some muscle strains," and that "[p]hysically I feel threatened, I feel scared in fear because it's unpredictable." 
Notwithstanding the contrary testimony and evidence 
presented by Husband, the family court, as the factfinder, found Wife's testimony credible. "[A]n appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trier of 
fact." Fisher v. Fisher
, 111 Hawaiʻi 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 
(2006). 
Regarding Husband's argument that Exhibit D, the 
police report for the October 1, 2022 incident, contradicts 
4  
  
 
 
  
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
Wife's testimony, the family court received it in evidence and 
noted Wife's testimony that "the police officers did not take [her] statement" for Exhibit D. The family court reconciled the conflicting testimonies and views of the evidence; and its determinations, as set forth in the challenged FOFs and COLs, 
were supported by substantial evidence. See Doe, 95 Hawai‘ i at 
196, 20 P.3d at 629. 
Although not identified as points of error, Husband's 
opening brief questions the family court's impartiality, and 
argues the family court erred by not admitting certain video evidence. 
Husband did not preserve these arguments below, and 
they are waived. See Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua
v. Wailea Resort Co., 100 Hawai‘ i 97, 107, 58 P.3d 608, 618 
(2002) ("Legal issues not raised in the trial court are 
ordinarily deemed waived on appeal." (citations omitted)). 
For these reasons, the family court's October 18, 2022 
Order for Protection, and the December 8, 2022 Findings of Fact 
and Conclusions of Law are affirmed.
