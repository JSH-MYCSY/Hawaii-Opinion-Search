Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai i (State) initially  
charged Bekkum via a Complaint filed on September 20, 2019 (2019 
Complaint ) with two counts of Sexual Assault in the Fourth Degree 
(Sexual Assault Fourth) in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 707-733(1)(a) (Supp. 2016).2 The 2019 Complaint alleged 
the two counts as follows:

COUNT ONE: 
That on or about the 29th day of September, 2017, in 
the Division of Wailuku, County of Maui, State of Hawaii, 
CURTIS RYAN BEKKUM did knowingly subject [LA] [(CW)], a 
person not married to him, to sexual contact by compulsion 
and/or cause her to have sexual contact with him by 
compulsion, to wit, by touching and/or grabbing her breast, 
thereby committing the offense of Sexual Assault in the 
Fourth Degree in violation of Section 707-733(1)(a) of the 
Hawaii Revised Statutes. 
COUNT TWO:
 
That on or about the 30th day of September, 2017, in 
the Division of Wailuku, County of Maui, State of Hawaii, 
CURTIS RYAN BEKKUM did knowingly subject [CW], a person not 
married to him, to sexual contact by compulsion and/or cause 
her to have sexual contact with him by compulsion, to wit, 
by touching and/or pressing against her buttocks with his 
penis, thereby committing the offense of Sexual Assault in 
the Fourth Degree in violation of Section 707-733 (1)(a) of 
the Hawaii Revised Statutes. 
The  charges  against  Bekkum  were  committed  to  the 
Circuit  Court  in  2CPC-20-0000077.   On  January  19,  2022,  Bekkum 
moved  to  dismiss  the  2019  Complaint  arguing  that  because  the 
complaint  was  not  signed  by  the  complaining  witness  (CW),  it  was 
fatally  defective.   The  Circuit  Court  heard  arguments  and  orally 
granted  the  motion  to  dismiss  on  February  10,  2022.   The  Circuit 
Court  entered  an  order  granting  the  motion  to  dismiss  without 
prejudice  on  February  23,  2022. 
On February 10, 2022, the same day the Circuit Court 
orally granted the motion to dismiss the 2019 Complaint, the 
State filed a new complaint (2022 Complaint ), alleging the same 
two counts as in the 2019 Complaint. The case was committed to 
the Circuit Court in 2CPC-22-0000240. A jury trial was held and 
Bekkum was found guilty on both counts of Sexual Assault Fourth. 
A motion for new trial was filed, and after hearings held on 
multiple days, the motion was denied. Judgment was entered on 
November 3, 2022, and Bekkum timely appealed.

           NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Bekkum raises seven points of error on appeal, arguing 
that: (1) the Circuit Court plainly erred in failing to enter 
judgment of acquittal; (2) the Circuit Court plainly erred in 
failing to provide a jury instruction regarding the State's 
burden of proving timeliness beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) the 
Complaint is fatally defective; (4) the Circuit Court reversibly 
erred in failing to instruct the jury to disregard certain 
hearsay testimony that was stricken and in admitting certain 
hearsay evidence; (5) Bekkum's due process rights were violated 
due to numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct; (6) 
Bekkum's trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of 
counsel; and (7) the Circuit Court abused its discretion when it 
orally denied Bekkum's Motion for New Trial. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Bekkum's 
points of error as follows: 
(1) Bekkum argues that the Circuit Court plainly erred 
in failing to enter a judgment of acquittal because the evidence 
was insufficient to sustain his convictions due to the State 
failing to prove that the instant prosecution was timely. 
Under HRS § 701-114 (2014), no person may be convicted 
of an offense unless, inter alia, facts establishing that the 
offense was committed within the time period specified in HRS 
§ 701-108 (2014) are proved beyond a reasonable doubt. A 
prosecution for Sexual Assault Fourth, a misdemeanor, must be 
commenced within two years after it is committed. See HRS § 701-
108(2)(e). The period of limitation does not run during any time

             NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
when a prosecution against the accused for the same conduct is 
pending. HRS § 701-108(6)(b). 
The State argues that the prosecution of the instant 
case was not untimely because the statute of limitations was 
tolled by operation of HRS § 701-108(6). The State requests that 
this court take judicial notice of the record in 2DCW-19-0001996, 
2CPC-20-0000077, and 2DCW-22-0000197, specifically (1) that the 
2019 Complaint was filed on September 20, 2019, in 
2DCW-19-0001996, (2) that the 2019 Complaint was then dismissed 
without prejudice on February 10, 2022, in case number 
2CPC-20-0000077, and (3) that the 2022 Complaint alleging the 
same conduct as alleged in the 2019 complaint was filed on 
February 10, 2022 in 2DCW-22-0000197.3 We first address the 
State's request for judicial notice. 
A court is mandated to take judicial notice when a 
party (1) requests the court to take judicial notice, and (2) 
provides enough information to establish that the fact is either 
generally known or capable of accurate and ready determination.

3 The State also requests that we take judicial notice of the 
February 3, 2022 State's Memorandum in Opposition to [Bekkum's] Motion to 
Dismiss for the fact that the State put Bekkum on notice that the 2019 
Complaint tolled the statute of limitations and that there would be nine days 
to re-file a new complaint upon dismissal of the 2019 Complaint. We decline 
to do so. Factual allegations, conclusions, and findings authored by the 
parties or their attorneys should not be noticed to prove the truth of the 
matters asserted, even though the material happens to be contained in court 
records. Uyeda v. Schermer ,

court's own records in an interrelated proceeding where the 
parties are the same." State v. Akana, 68 Haw. 164, 165, 706 
P.2d 1300, 1302 (1985). For example, the supreme court has held 
that the ICA was required to take judicial notice of filings made 
in another appeal upon a party's request because the filings in 
the other appeal were included in the ICA's electronic records 
through the Judiciary Information Management System, and the 
parties in the two appeals were the same. Oahu Publ'ns, Inc. v. 
Abercrombie ,
 134 Hawai i 16, 20 n.3, 332 P.3d 159, 163 n.3 
(2014). 
Bekkum argues that judicial notice should not be taken 
here because the issue of whether the instant prosecution was 
timely is "highly debatable and not easily verifiable," and 
taking judicial notice of the content of court records does not 
in and of itself prove that a tolling of a statute of limitations 
has occurred as a matter of fact or law. However, Bekkum does 
not dispute the accuracy of the filing dates for the 2019 
Complaint, the 2CPC-20-0000077 dismissal, and the 2022 Complaint. 
Because these filing dates are not in dispute, nor can their 
accuracy be reasonably questioned, we grant the State's request 
to judicially notice the 2019 Complaint, the dismissal without 
prejudice of the 2019 Complaint, and the 2022 Complaint. 
The Complaints alleged and the State adduced evidence 
that the charged incidents took place on September 29 and 30, 
2017. The expiration of the two-year statute of limitations for 
these offenses would have been September 29 and 30, 2019. See 
HRS § 701-108(2)(e). The 2019 Complaint was timely commenced 
because the 2019 Complaint was filed on September 20, 2019, nine

days before the expiration of the statute of limitations. See 
HRS § 701-108(5). The limitations period was tolled while the 
2DCW-19-0001996 case and then the 2CPC-20-0000077 case proceeded. 
See HRS § 701-108(6)(b). The Circuit Court orally dismissed the 
2019 Complaint without prejudice, and the State re-filed the 2022 
Complaint on the same day, February 10, 2022. Therefore, the 
Circuit Court did not plainly err in failing to enter a judgment 
of acquittal on the grounds that the prosecution was untimely. 
(2) Bekkum also argues that the Circuit Court plainly 
erred in failing to instruct the jury that the State must prove 
timeliness beyond a reasonable doubt. "[O]nce instructional 
error is demonstrated, we will vacate, without regard to whether 
timely objection is made, if there is a reasonable possibility 
that the error contributed to the defendant's conviction, i.e., 
that the erroneous jury instruction was not harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt." State v. Abdon,
 137 Hawai i 19, 29-30, 364 
P.3d 917, 927-28 (2016) (quoting State v. Nichols ,
 111 Hawai i 
327,
 337, 141 P.3d 974, 984 (2006)). Failure to instruct on 
timeliness is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt when the record 
contains sufficient evidence that the prosecution was timely 
commenced. Id. at 30, 364 P.3d at 928. Here, the Circuit Court 
failed to instruct the jury that the State must prove timeliness 
beyond a reasonable doubt. However, as discussed supra, the 
record, as in Abdon, contains undisputed evidence regarding the 
timeliness of the prosecution. Therefore, we conclude that the 
Circuit Court's instructional error was harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt.

(3)   Bekkum  argues  that  the  2022  Complaint  was  fatally 
defective  because  it  failed  to  allege  that  the  instant 
prosecution  was  timely,  and  it  failed  to  define  the  statutory 
term  "compulsion."   Bekkum  does  not  point  to,  nor  could  we  find, 
where  in  the  record  Bekkum  challenged  the  sufficiency  of  the  2022 
Complaint  on  these  bases.  
[W]hen  a  defendant  challenges  the  sufficiency  of  a 
charge  for  the  first  time  on  appeal,  an  appellate  court  will 
apply  a  more  liberal  standard  of  review,  called  the 
Motta/Wells  rule.   See,  e.g.,  State  v.  Merino,  81  Hawai i 
19
8,  213,  915   P.2d  672,  687  (1996)  (explaining  that  the 
Motta/Wells  rule  applies  to  challenges  to  oral  charges, 
informations,  and  complaints  raised  for  the  first  time  on 
appeal).   Under  the  Motta/Wells  rule,  charges  challenged  for 
the  first  time  on  appeal  are  presumed  valid.  [State  v. 
Wheeler,  121  Hawai i  383,  399-400,  219  P.3d  1170,  1186-87 
(2009).]   Accordingly,  we  will  only  vacate  a  defendant's 
conviction  under  this  standard  if  the  defendant  can  show:  
(1)  that  the  charge  cannot  reasonably  be  construed  to  allege 
a  crime;  or  (2)  that  the  defendant  was  prejudiced.   State  v. 
Motta,  66  Haw.  89,  91,  657  P.2d  1019,  1020  (1983). 
State v. Kauhane ,  145 Hawai i 362, 370, 452 P.3d 359, 367 (2019) 
(cleaned up). 
Because Bekkum raises these arguments challenging the 
sufficiency of the 2022 Complaint for the first time on appeal, 
the Motta/Wells rule is applicable. Under the Motta/Wells rule, 
a charge will only be adequate when it provides the accused with 
fair notice of the offense's essential elements, which are 
conduct, attendant circumstances, and results of conduct. Id. at 
370, 452 P.3d at 367 (citing State v. Sprattling ,
 99 Hawai i 312, 
329 n.6, 55 P.3d 276, 293 n.6 (2002)). "Where a statute sets 
forth with reasonable clarity all essential elements of the crime 
intended to be punished, and fully defines the offense in 
unmistakable terms readily comprehensible to persons of common 
understanding, a charge drawn in the language of the statute will

be sufficient." Id. (quoting State v. Nesmith ,  127 Hawai i 48, 
53, 276 P.3d 617, 622 (2012)) (cleaned up). 
Regarding the complaint's failure to allege timeliness, 
timeliness is not an essential element of the Sexual Assault 
Fourth offense because timeliness is not included as an essential 
element of Sexual Assault Fourth in HRS § 707-733. Bekkum also 
does not allege that he was prejudiced by the lack of such 
language in the complaint. Accordingly, Bekkum's argument that 
the 2022 complaint was fatally defective due to the failure to 
allege timeliness lacks merit. 
Bekkum further argues that complaint was defective due 
to the failure to provide the statutory definition of 
"compulsion." This court has previously addressed whether the 
statutory definition of "compulsion" comports with its common 
meaning. State v. Aledo, No. CAAP-16-0000470, 2019 WL 6127474, 
*3-4 (Haw. App. Nov. 18, 2019) (SDO). As we concluded in Aledo, 
the dictionary definitions of "compulsion" did not rise to the 
level of specificity of the definition of "compulsion" in HRS 
§ 707-700 (2014). Id. at *4. The failure to include the 
statutory definition of "compulsion" failed to provide the 
defendant with fair notice of the charges. Id. Here, the 
complaint did not include the statutory definition of 
"compulsion." Therefore, we conclude that the complaint did not 
give fair notice of an essential element of the charged offenses 
and was therefore insufficient. See id. at *3-4.

Accordingly, we vacate and remand the case to the 
Circuit Court with instructions to dismiss the case without 
prejudice. See, e.g., Kauhane , 145 Hawai i at 374,  452 P.3d at 
371. 
(4-7)   In   light  of  our  decision  to  vacate  and  remand 
the  case  to  the  Circuit  Court  to  be  dismissed  without  prejudice 
based  on  the  insufficiency  of  the  2022  Complaint,  we  need  not 
reach  the  other  points  of  error  Bekkum  raises  on  appeal.4   See, 
e.g.,  State  v.  Borochov,   86  Hawai i   183,  193-94,   948  P.2d  604,

where  appellate   court  decided   to  vacate  and  remand  case  based  on 
insufficient   complaint);   State  v.  Cummings,   101  Hawai i  139,  145, 
63  P.3d  1109,  1115  (2003),  overruled  on  other  grounds  by  Schwartz 
v.  State,  136  Hawai i  258,  361  P.3d  1161  (2015)  (declining  to 
address  other  points  of  error  because  determination  that 
complaint  was  insufficient  was  dispositive  of  the  appeal);  State 
v.  Saffeels,  No.  CAAP-23-0000197,  2024  WL  773572,  *2  (Haw.  App.
