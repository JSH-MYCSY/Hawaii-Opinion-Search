APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(LAHAINA DIVISION)
(CASE NO. 2DTA-22-00351) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(
By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka, and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Kevin Cole (Cole) appeals from the 
November 2, 2022 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and 
Verdict (Verdict) entered by the Lahaina Division of the District 
Court of the Second Circuit (District Court).  Upon a temporary 
remand from this court, a Judgment and Notice of Entry of 
Judgment was entered on March 13, 2023 (Judgment). 1
After a bench trial, Cole was convicted of, 
inter alia, 
Operating a Vehicle After License and Privilege Have Been Suspended or Revoked for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
1 The Honorable Bevanne J. Bowers presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
§ 291E-62(a) (2020),2 for an incident that occurred on April 14, 
2022. 
Cole raises two points of error on appeal, contending 
that the District Court erred in finding and concluding that: 
(1) Cole drove his car in violation of any restriction placed in his license, in violation of HRS § 291E-62(a)(1), and that Cole recklessly drove his vehicle without a physical interlock permit in violation of HRS § 291E-62(a)(2). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Cole's points of error as follows: 
Cole does not dispute the District Court's findings of 
fact, including that: (1) "[Cole's] license was suspended/revoked by the Administrative Driver's License 
2 HRS § 291E-62(a) states: 
§ 291E-62 Operating a vehicle after license and
privilege have been suspended or revoked for operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant; penalties.(a) No person whose license and privilege to operate a
vehicle have been revoked, suspended, or otherwiserestricted pursuant to this section or to part III orsection 291E-61 or 291E-61.5, or to part VII or part XIV ofchapter 286 or section 200-81, 291-4, 291-4.4, 291-4.5, or291-7 as those provisions were in effect on December 31,2001, shall operate or assume actual physical control of anyvehicle: 
(1) In violation of any restrictions placed on theperson's license; 
(2) While the person's license or privilege tooperate a vehicle remains suspended or revoked; 
(3) Without installing an ignition interlock devicerequired by this chapter; or 
(4) With an ignition interlock permit unless theperson has the ignition interlock permit in theperson's immediate possession.

Revocation Office [(ADLRO)] for Operating a Vehicle Under the 
Influence of an Intoxicant from April 5, 2022 to April 4, 2024;" 
(2) although Cole had mailed in the required paperwork for an ignition interlock permit and installed an ignition interlock device (IID), on April 14, 2022, he had not yet been issued an 
ignition interlock permit; and (3) although Cole testified that 
"he believed that all he needed to drive on his revoked license was the IID device installed, current insurance, and paperwork showing such mailed to the ADLRO," on cross-examination, Cole acknowledged that the notice he received from ADLRO stated that "You must obtain an ignition interlock permit." 
When the evidence adduced at trial is considered in the 
strongest light for the prosecution, with all reasonable and rational inferences under the facts in evidence, including circumstantial evidence, 
State v. Matavale
, 115 Hawai#i 149, 157
-
58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 (2007), there is substantial evidence to support Cole's conviction. 
Cole knew that his license was revoked, and he received 
written notice that an ignition interlock permit, as well as an IID device, was required for him to drive during the period of revocation. 
The state of mind required to establish an offense 
under HRS § 291E-62(a)(1) or (a)(2) is not specified and, therefore, is established if a person acts intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. HRS § 702-204 (2014). "A person acts recklessly with respect to attendant circumstances when he 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that 
such circumstances exist." HRS § 702-206(3)(b) (2014). 
A risk is substantial and unjustifiable within the meaning
of this section if, considering the nature and purpose ofthe person's conduct and the circumstances known to him, thedisregard of the risk involves a gross deviation from thestandard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observein the same situation. 
HRS § 702-206(3)(d) (2014). 
Circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences 
arising from the evidence of a defendant's acts, conduct, and all 
of the circumstances may be sufficient to establish the requisite state of mind. See, e.g., State v. Eastman
, 81 Hawai#i 131, 141, 
913 P.2d 57, 67 (1996). 
We reject Cole's contention that there was insufficient 
evidence that he acted with the requisite state of mind to support his conviction. 
As set forth above, HRS § 291E-62(a) 
includes that: "No person whose license and privilege to operate a vehicle have been revoked, suspended, or otherwise restricted pursuant to this section . . . shall operate or assume actual physical control of any vehicle . . . (2) [w]hile the person's license or privilege to operate a vehicle remains suspended or revoked[.]" (Formatting altered). The State was thus required to prove only that Cole had a reckless state of mind regarding whether his license remained suspended or revoked on April 14, 2022. Upon review of the District Court's undisputed findings, we conclude that there was substantial evidence to support Cole's reckless state of mind concerning his lack of a required interlock permit. Therefore, we further conclude that there was substantial evidence to support Cole's conviction.
