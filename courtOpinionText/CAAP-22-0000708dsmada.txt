Upon review of the record, it appears that:

were due on extension on or before June 26, 2023; 
(3) RN failed to file either document, or request 
another extension of time; 
(4)
 On July 31, 2023, the appellate clerk notified RN 
that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the court's attention on August 10, 2023, for appropriate action, which could include dismissal of the appeal, under 
Hawai#i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and RN could request relief from default by motion. The appellate clerk mailed the notice to RN at his address on record. The United States Postal Service returned the notice as not deliverable; and NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(5) RN has not filed a notice of change of address, as 
required by HRAP Rule 25(f), and his standby counsel is unable to 
provide an address for RN. RN took no further action in this appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
