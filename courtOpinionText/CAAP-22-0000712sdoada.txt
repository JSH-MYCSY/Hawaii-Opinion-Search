v. 
SPRING GLOVER, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
WAHIAWĀ DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 1DCC-21-0002259) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Spring Glover appeals from the October 27, 2022 
Judgment of the District Court of the First Circuit, Wahiaw ā 
Division.
1 We vacate and remand for a new trial. 
Glover was charged by complaint with Cruelty to Animals 
in the Second Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 711-1109(1)(a). She pleaded not guilty and waived her 
right to a jury trial. The district court found her guilty. 
This appeal followed. 
Glover contends her waiver of a jury trial was invalid, 
and the trial court didn't give a proper Lewis/Monteil  pretrial

advisement2 or conduct a Tachibana/Torres  colloquy.3 Her last 
point is dispositive. 
Glover testified at trial, but the district court did 
not engage her in a Tachibana/Torres  colloquy before she did. 
Thus, the record does not show she knowingly, intelligently, or 
voluntarily waived her constitutional right to not testify. She doesn't challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict. Accordingly, the Judgment entered by the district court on October 27, 2022, is vacated, and this case is remanded for a new trial.
