APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(FC-S NO. 22-0069) 
JANUARY 26, 2024 
HIRAOKA, PRESIDING JUDGE, NAKASONE AND MCCULLEN, JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY HIRAOKA, J. 
This case concerns the Child Protective Act, Hawaii 
Revised Statutes ( HRS) Chapter 587A. We must decide whether a 
biological parent whose parental rights have been terminated 
under HRS § 587A-33 must be summoned if another petition about the child is later filed in the family court. 
We hold that HRS 
§ 587A-13 does not require that a parent whose parental rights have been terminated be summoned if a subsequent petition concerning the child is filed. FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
I. BACKGROUND 
Mother and Father  (collectively, the Parents) are the 
biological parents of AG1 and AG2 ( Children ). Parents' parental 
rights in Children were terminated on March 29, 2019. The order 
terminating Parents' parental rights stated: 
13 Pursuant to HRS § 587A-33(b)(5)[1] [Mother] and
[Father] are excluded from participating in adoption
or other subsequent proceedings and he/she/they shallnot be noticed of future hearings and he/she/theyshall not appear at future hearings unless he/she/theyreceive further legal notice requiring suchappearance[.] 
The state Department of Human Services ( DHS) was granted 
permanent custody of Children. Children were placed with a 
Guardian . 
On July 27, 2022 (after Parents' parental rights were 
terminated), DHS filed a Petition  for temporary foster custody of 
AG1 and family supervision of AG2. The Petition alleged that Guardian had physically abused AG1. DHS also reported threatened abuse of AG2. Guardian and Parents were summoned to appear before the Family Court of the Third Circuit. The Family Court 
1 HRS § 587A-33 (2018) provides, in relevant part: 
(b) If the court determines that the criteria [for
terminating parental rights] set forth in subsection (a) are
established by clear and convincing evidence and the goal ofthe permanent plan is for the child to be adopted or remainin permanent custody, the court shall order: 
. . . . 
(5) The entry of any other orders the court deems tobe in the best interests of the child, includingrestricting or excluding unnecessary partiesfrom participating in adoption or othersubsequent proceedings.

appointed the Legal Aid Society of Hawai #i (LASH) to be 
Children's guardian ad litem. 
On September 7, 2022, LASH moved to dismiss Parents or 
exclude them from the proceeding. 
The Family Court denied the 
motion.  LASH moved for reconsideration. The Family Court 
denied reconsideration and entered findings of fact and 
conclusions of law. The court concluded: 2
4. Even though [Father]'s and [Mother]'s parental
rights regarding the Subject Children were terminated . . .
pursuant to HRS § 587A-33, they are nevertheless entitled tonotice in this . . . case pursuant to HRS § 587A-13. 
5. Even though [Father]'s and [Mother]'s parental
rights regarding the Subject Children were terminated . . .pursuant to HRS § 587A-33, they are nevertheless entitled toparticipate in this matter because each received a summonsrequiring their appearances, and each of them is a "parent"and "party" as those terms are defined in HRS § 587A-4. 
6. The statutory language and definitions set forth
in HRS §§ 587A-4 and 587A-13 control as to whether [Father]and [Mother] are entitled to notice of and the right toparticipate as parties in this case. Accordingly, the Courtdeclines to engage in any further analysis of the otherarguments presented by [LASH], including whether theinclusion of [Father] and [Mother] as parties to this caseis in the Subject Children's best interests under HRS§ 571-46(b). 
The Family Court let LASH file this interlocutory 
appeal. LASH argues that the Family Court erred by denying the 
motion to dismiss Parents or exclude them from the proceeding. 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
Interpretation of a statute is a question of law we 
review de novo. Barker v. Young, 153 Hawai #i 144, 148, 528 P.3d 
217, 221 (2023). We start with the statute's language; "implicit 
2 The Honorable Jeffrey W. Ng presided. 
3 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in the task of statutory construction is our foremost obligation 
to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute itself." Id. (citation omitted). But "when there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, . . . the meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning." Id. (cleaned up). "The legislature is presumed not to intend an absurd result, and legislation will be construed to avoid, if possible, inconsistency, contradiction, and illogicality." State v. Vliet, 91 Hawai #i 288, 294, 983 P.2d 189, 195 (1999) (cleaned 
up). 
III. DISCUSSION 
The Family Court relied on HRS §§ 587A-4 and -13 to 
conclude that Mother and Father were "entitled to notice of and the right to participate as parties in this case." HRS § 587A-13 (2018) provides: 
(a) After a petition has been filed, the court shall issue
a summons requiring the presence of the parents and other
persons to be parties to the proceeding except the child, asfollows: 
. . . . 
(3) The summons shall state: "YOUR PARENTAL AND CUSTODIAL DUTIES AND RIGHTS CONCERNING THE CHILD OR CHILDREN WHO ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE ATTACHED PETITION MAY BE TERMINATED IF YOU FAIL TO APPEAR ON THE DATE SET FORTH IN THIS SUMMONS." 
4 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 587A-4 (2018) provides: 
As used in this chapter, unless the context clearly
indicates otherwise : 
. . . . 
"Parent" means any legal parent of a child; the birth 
mother, unless the child has been legally adopted; the
adjudicated, presumed, or concerned birth father  of the 
child as provided in section 578-2(a)(5), unless the child 
has been legally adopted ; or the legal guardians or any
other legal custodians of the child. 
"Party" means an authorized agency; a child who is
subject to a proceeding under this chapter; the child's 
parents and guardian ad litem; any other person who is
alleged in the petition or who is subsequently found at any
child protective proceeding to be encouraging, causing, orcontributing to the acts or conditions that brought thechild within the scope of this chapter; and may include anyother person, including the child's current foster parent orcurrent resource family, if the court finds that suchperson's participation is in the best interest of the child;provided that the court may limit a party's right toparticipate in any child protective proceeding if the courtdeems such limitation of such party's participation to beconsistent with the best interests of the child and such 
party is not a family member who is required to be summoned
pursuant to section 587A-13, except as otherwise provided inthis chapter. 
(Emphasis added.) 
DHS contends that the plain language of HRS § 587A-13 
requires that notice be given to all "parents," defined by HRS 
§ 587A-4 to include the birth mother and birth father unless the child has been legally adopted, even if their parental rights have been terminated. HRS § 587A-4 defines "parents" as the child's birth mother and birth father, " unless the context 
clearly indicates otherwise [.]" (Emphasis added.) 
We hold that the context of HRS § 587A-13 does not 
require that birth parents whose parental rights have been terminated be summoned in further proceedings concerning the child. The statute states that if a summoned parent fails to 
5 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appear at the proceeding for which the summons was issued, the 
parent's parental rights may be terminated. For a birth parent whose parental rights have been terminated, the sanction means nothing, is inconsistent with and contradicts the order terminating parental rights, and is illogical. See Vliet , 91 
Hawai#i at 294, 983 P.2d at 195. Parents' parental rights in 
Children were terminated before DHS filed the Petition. DHS was 
not required by HRS § 587A-13 to issue summons to Parents, who had no right to participate in the proceeding (unless and until their parental rights are reinstated by the Family Court). 
IV.
 CONCLUSION 
For these reasons: (1) the "Orders Concerning Child 
Protective Act[,]" entered on October 13, 2022, are vacated in part to the extent they deny LASH's motion to dismiss or exclude Parents; (2) the "Order Denying in Part and Granting in Part Guardian Ad Litem's Motion for Reconsideration and/or Relief from Orders Concerning Child Protective Act[,]" entered on November 1, 2022, is vacated in part to the extent it denies LASH's motion for reconsideration; and (3) the "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Regarding Guardian Ad Litem's Motion to Dismiss and/or Exclude [Parents][,]" entered on November 7, 2022,

is vacated. This case is remanded to the Family Court for 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
