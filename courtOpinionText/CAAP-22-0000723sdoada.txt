Bernice Pauahi Bishop doing business as Kamehameha Schools 
appeal from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's1 
November 14, 2022 order granting Defendant/Cross-claim-Defendant/Cross-claimant-Appellee St. Francis Medical Center's 
petition for determination of good faith settlement and 
Defendant/Third-Party Defendant-Appellee St. Francis Healthcare System of Hawaii's (SFHS) joinder (Good Faith Settlement Order).

For a brief background, Plaintiff-Appellee Anthony P. 
Funn sued Kamehameha Schools, St. Francis, and Defendant/Cross-
claim-Defendant-Appellee Estate of Robert McCormick Browne 
(Dr. Browne)  pursuant to 3 Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 657-
1.8 (2016), which permits certain actions " for recovery of 
damages based on physical, psychological, or other injury or 
condition suffered by a minor arising from the sexual abuse of 
the minor by any person"  that would otherwise be time barred.    
Funn identified Dr. Browne, who was formerly employed as Chief 4
1 The Honorable James H. Ashford presided until August 12, 2021; the 
Honorable Gary W.B. Chang presided over all further activity in the case. 
2 The Circuit Court also granted SFHS' joinder in a separate order on 
October 24, 2022 (Substantive Joinder Order). 
3 Dr. Browne is deceased, and the Estate is a nominal appellee in this 
appeal. 
4 Funn later filed a second amended complaint to include SFHS as a 
defendant and added claims for intentional fraudulent transfer, constructive 
fraudulent transfer, and piercing the corporate veil.

of Psychiatry at St. Francis, as having sexually abused him when 
he was a student at Kamehameha Schools. 
Kamehameha Schools filed a cross-claim against 
St. Francis and Dr. Browne's Estate. St. Francis filed its 
answer and a cross-claim against Kamehameha Schools and 
Dr. Browne's Estate. Kamehameha Schools then filed a third-party complaint against SFHS. 
Funn settled with St. Francis and SFHS. According to 
Kamehameha Schools, Funn also settled with Kamehameha Schools. 
St. Francis then petitioned the circuit court for a 
determination of good faith settlement and SFHS moved to join, 
which was granted. The circuit court entered its Good Faith 
Settlement Order. Kamehameha Schools appeals from that order. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
points of error as discussed below and affirm. 
Kamehameha Schools contends that the circuit court 
erred in concluding that, under HRS § 663-15.5 (2016), Funn's 
good faith settlement with St. Francis and SFHS barred 
Kamehameha Schools' cross-claims for breach of contract, 
negligence, indemnification, and attorneys' fees pursuant to Uyemura v. Wick, 57 Haw. 102, 551 P.2d 171 (1976), and third-
3   
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
party claims for intentional and constructive fraudulent 
transfers and piercing the corporate veil. 
When a court determines that a settlement was made in 
good faith, HRS § 663-15.5(d) bars joint tortfeasors from making 
claims against the settling tortfeasor except for claims based 
on a written indemnity agreement: 
(d) A determination by the court that a settlement was 
made in good faith shall: 
(1) Bar any other joint tortfeasor . . . from any 
further claims against the settling tortfeasor 
. . . except those based on a written indemnity 
agreement; and 
(2) Result in a dismissal of all cross- claims filed 
against the settling joint tortfeasor . . . except those based on a written indemnity agreement. 
HRS § 663-15.5(d) (formatting altered). 
Here, Kamehameha Schools' cross-claims, including its 
breach of contract and Uyemura claims, arise out of the 
"original injury" to Funn caused by Dr. Browne's abuse and are 
"directly or indirectly" in the nature of contribution and 
indemnity claims. See Abad v. Griffith
, 155 Hawai‘i 223, 560 
P.3d 478, Nos. CAAP-21-0000120 and CAAP-23-0000015, 2024 WL 
5088457, at *5 (App. Dec. 12, 2024) (SDO) (concluding the approval of a good faith settlement "requires dismissal of only 
those crossclaims against a settling joint tortfeasor raised in 
the capacity of a joint tortfeasor, i.e., those seeking 
contribution or indemnity (directly or indirectly) for the 
4   
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
injury (to the complainant) that is the subject of the good 
faith settlement"). As Kamehameha Schools acknowledges, its 
third-party claims against SFHS depend on its other claims. 
The Good Faith Settlement Order dismissed the cross-
claims against St. Francis, discharged St. Francis "from all 
liability for contribution to any other joint tortfeasor or co-obligor[,]" and barred "any further claims against St. Francis 
. . . in connection with this litigation, except those based 
upon a written indemnity agreement." The Substantive Joinder 
Order concluded that SFHS' substantive joinder to the Petition 
was granted "as to all cross-claims and third-party claims 
pursuant to [HRS §] 663-15.5(d)(2)." 
The circuit court's dismissal of Kamehameha Schools' 
cross-claims against St. Francis and third-party claims against 
SFHS, and its discharge of St. Francis (and therefore, SFHS) "from all liability for contribution to any other joint 
tortfeasor or co-obligor," is consistent with the underlying 
purpose of HRS § 663-15.5 - protecting settling tortfeasors from 
contribution claims brought by other joint tortfeasors. 
Thus, the circuit did not err in concluding Funn's 
good faith settlement with St. Francis and SFHS barred 
Kamehameha Schools' cross-claims for breach of contract, negligence, indemnification, and attorneys' fees.
