Upon consideration of Plaintiff-Appellee Alejandro

Kawauchi (Kawauchi), to show cause, within ten days, why a CADS has not been filed; 
(2) Lee did not file the CADS, or request an extension 
of time, even though the court cautioned Lee that failure to file the CADS may result in sanctions, including dismissal of the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

were due on or before February 16, 2023, and March 20, 2023, respectively; 
(4) Lee did not file either document or request an

(5) On March 22, 2023, the appellate clerk entered a 
default notice informing Lee that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the court's attention on April 3, 2023, for appropriate action, which could include dismissal of the appeal under HRAP Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and Lee could request relief from default by motion;

Dismiss Appeal for failure to file the CADS, statement of jurisdiction, and opening brief, which Lee has not opposed. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: 1. Under HRAP Rule 51, Jamae K. K. Kawauchi is 
sanctioned in the amount of $50.00. 
2. A check in the full amount, payable to the State
