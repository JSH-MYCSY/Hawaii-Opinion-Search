APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
SOUTH KOHALA DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 3DV15100237K) 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION 
(By: 
Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Guidry, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Defendant-Appellant Deanna Lee's

support, and the record, it appears that Lee seeks reconsideration of the court's June 21, 2023 Order for Sanctions and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss Appeal, but Lee fails to demonstrate that the court overlooked or misapprehended any point of law or fact. See
 
Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule

Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for 
reconsideration is denied.
