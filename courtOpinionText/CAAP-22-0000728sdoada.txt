and Conclusions of Law ( COLs); Order Granting Plaintiff / 
Counterclaim Defendant -Appellee U.S. Bank National Association, 
Not in Its Individual Capacity but Solely as Trustee for the 
RMAC Trust, Series 2016 -CTT's (U.S. Bank ) Motion for Summary 
Judgment and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure, Filed 
August 16, 2022 (Order), and Judgment , both entered on October 
11, 2022 by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit ( circuit 
court).1 
Goldstein  raises four  points of error  on appeal, 
contending that  the circuit court erred in granting summary 
judgment and an interlocutory decree of foreclosure because: (1) 
there were genuine issues of material fact concerning the 
principal balance owed under the promissory note ( Note); (2) the 
evidence used to prove the principal, interest, costs, tax, and other amounts due were not admissible under the hearsay 
exception in Hawaii Rules of Evidence ( HRE) Rule 803(b)(6); (3) 
U.S. Bank failed to provide adequate notice of the assignments 
of the subject mortgage ( Mortgage), the deferred interest 
charges, and acceleration of the loan; and (4) all claims under 
the Note are barred by the six-year statute of limitations 
(SOL).

Upon careful review of the record, briefs,  and 
relevant legal authorities, and having given due consideration 
to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties,  
we resolve  Goldstein's  points of error as follows:  
(1) Goldstein contends that U.S. Bank failed to prove 
that no ge nuine issue of material fact existed as to the 
principal balance due under the Note because: (1) the Note was 
executed on January 19, 2007, with the "principal amount of 
$4,991,000 and the initial rate of 8.625% per annum"; (2) U.S. 
Bank represented that the principal balance as of May 1, 2022 
was $5,408,940.13 ; and (3 ) there is no showing or proof of how 
the $5,408,940.13 principal balance was calculated. 
We review the circuit court's grant of summary 
judgment de novo. Kanahele v. State , 154 Hawai‘i 190, 201, 549 
P.3d 275, 286 (2024). Pursuant to Hawai‘i Rules of Civil 
Procedure Rule 56(c), summary judgment shall be granted, 
if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, 
and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if 
any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material 
fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as 
a matter of law. 
Foreclosing parties must "demonstrate that all conditions 
precedent to foreclosure under the note and mortgage are 
satisfied and that all steps required by statute have been 
strictly complied with." Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Behrendt, 
142 Hawai‘i 37, 41, 414 P.3d 89, 93 (2018)  (citation omitted).

Typically, this requires that the plaintiff prove: (1) "the 
existence of an agreement"; (2) "the terms of the agreement"; 
(3) "a default by the mortgagor under the terms of the 
agreement"  -- i.e., failure to make payments; and (4) "giving of 
the cancellation notice."   Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 
139 Hawai‘i 361, 367, 390 P.3d 1248, 1254 (2017)  (citation 
omitted).  
The summary judgment record reflects  that U.S. Bank 
produced no evidence to establish how the $5,408,940.13  
principal balance was calculated.   The circuit court's adoption 
of this figure as the principal balance  does not, however, 
provide a basis for setting aside the circuit court's grant of summary judgment.   Goldstein does not dispute that a default 
occurred, and a discrepancy in the amount of the principal balance due does not merit vacating the foreclosure decree. See  
Bank of Honolulu, N.A. v. Anderson, 3 Haw.  App. 545, 549, 654 
P.2d 1370, 1374 (App. 1982) (determining that Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS )  § 667-1.5  (2016) "does not require the 
determination of a sum certain before foreclosure is decreed  2
2 U.S. Bank's motion for summary judgment attached the declaration 
of Alicia Stewart (Stewart), an employee of U.S. Bank's authorized loan 
servicing agent Rushmore Loan Management Services, LLC. Stewart's 
declaration states that the Note was executed with the "principal amount of 
$4,991,000 .00, plus interest at the initial rate of 8.625% per annum." It 
further states that the principal balance at the time of the motion for 
summary judgment totaled $ 5,408,940.13 , and that interest of over $2.7 
million was due at "various rates," yet there is no showing or proof of how 
the $5,408,940.13 principal balance was calculated.

since a deficiency judgment is rendered only after the sale of 
the mortgaged property") (citation omitted) . 
We therefore vacate FOF 19, which finds the principal 
balance  to be $5,408,940.13.   We further vacate COL  1,  and 
paragraph 2 of the Order, to the extent that the circuit court 
calculated the total amount of $9,443,572.54  "due and owing" to 
U.S. Bank based on the $5,408,940.13  principal balance.   We 
otherwise affirm the circuit court's FOFs, COLs, and Order granting an interlocutory decree of foreclosure  in favor of U.S. 
Bank.  
(2) Goldstein contends that the circuit court 
erroneously relied on "inadmissible hearsay . . . in determining the date of default . . .  , the principal amount of the loan, 
interest due, and other costs allegedly incurred" because U.S. Bank's supporting declaration failed to establish familiarity 
with the record-keeping system of a prior loan servicer, and 
thus, it did not meet the requirements for introducing business records under HRE Rule 803(b)(6),  and U.S. Bank  N.A.  v. Mattos, 
140 
Hawai‘i 26, 32, 398 P.3d 615, 621 (2017). Goldstein failed 
to raise this argument below, and it is therefore waived.  See  
Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., 
100 Hawai‘ i 97,  107,  58 P.3d 608, 618  (2002) ("Legal issues not 
raised in the trial court  are ordinarily deemed waived on 
appeal.") (citations omitted).

(3) Goldstein contends that U.S. Bank failed to 
provide adequate notice of the assignments of the Mortgage and 
of the "[d]eferred [i]nterest" charges under the Note, and that 
U.S. Bank's notice of "acceleration" failed to adequately inform 
Goldstein of his right to bring a court action to challenge the 
default as required under the Mortgage terms.  
Goldstein did not argue below that U.S. Bank's notice 
of default failed to comply with the Mortgage terms, or that he 
was not given notice of the deferred interest charges. Th ose 
arguments are therefore waived. 
Goldstein cites HRS  §  454M-5(b)(1) (2013) to support 
his argument that a lender is required to provide notice of the assignments of the Mortgage. HRS  §  454M-5(b)(1) requires loan 
servicers to disclose to borrowers "[a]ny notice required by [12 C.F.R. § 1024.33  (2019)]." 12 C.F.R. § 1024.33  sets forth  the 
duty of a loan servicer to notify the borrower of a change in 
servicer. Relevant here, 12 C.F.R. § 1024.33 does not require loan servicers to notify a borrower of an assignment of the 
mortgage. Goldstein therefore fails to identify any authority 
supporting his contention of error.  
(4) Goldstein contends that the six -year SOL under HRS 
§ 657-1 (2016) bars enforcement of the Note because the cause of 
action accrued upon default, which occurred on April 1, 2009, 
and U.S. Bank's complaint was filed on July 31, 2019.

We review the circuit court's application of an SOL de 
novo. See  Est.  of Roxas v. Marcos, 121 Hawai‘i 59, 66, 214 P.3d 
598, 605 (2009). HRS § 490:3-118(a) (2008) governs enforcement 
of a promissory note, and provides, in relevant part,  that "an 
action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay a note payable at a definite time must be commenced within six years 
after the due date or dates stated in the note or, if a due date 
is accelerated, within six years after the accelerated due 
date." "[I]n order for [a lender] to effectively exercise its 
option to accelerate the maturity dates of the [promissory 
note], the [lender is] required to communicate its exercise of 
the option to [the borrower] by some affirmative act when it did so," and the "initiation of  a suit for the whole debt 
constitutes a sufficient affirmative act to communicate to the [borrower] that he or she has chosen to exercise his or her 
option to accelerate." Bank of Haw.  v. Kunimoto, 91 Hawai‘ i 427, 
436, 984 P.2d 1253, 1262 (App. 1997)  (citations omitted). It 
appears that the loan was accelerated upon the filing of the 
complaint, as Goldstein fails to identify any evidence of an 
earlier acceleration date. We thus conclude that the claim was 
commenced within the six-year SOL.  
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate FOF 19 , COL 1, 
and paragraph 2 of the Order, as discussed above, but otherwise
