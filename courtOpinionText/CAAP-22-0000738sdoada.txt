APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CC181000206) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Sherry McGann, representing herself, appeals from the 
December 12, 2022 Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for 
Reimbursement of Reasonable Attorney's Fees and Costs (
Fee Order) 
entered by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit.  We vacate 
and remand for further proceedings.

Mary Jacqueline Scheibel,   Menehune Ventures, LLC, 
Worthy Clay Scott, and Nick Braber (collectively, Plaintiffs) 
sued McGann and Celestial Properties, LLC on May 9, 2018. The

representative of Scheibel's estate, was substituted for Scheibel consistent

complaint alleged that McGann and Celestial Properties were 
operating illegal short-term rental and bed-and-breakfast homes 
on land zoned for agriculture, and sought to enjoin the uses. 
Celestial Properties was defaulted and never appeared. 
The circuit court held an eight-day trial. Findings of 
fact and conclusions of law were entered on May 30, 2019. An 
order granting a permanent injunction against McGann and 
Celestial Properties was also entered on May 30, 2019. The Final 
Judgment for Plaintiffs and against McGann and Celestial 
Properties was entered on August 7, 2019. 
Plaintiffs moved for an award of attorneys fees and 
costs on August 23, 2019 (Fee Motion). The hearing was set for 
October 18, 2019. On October 17, 2019, McGann filed a petition 
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, creating In re McGann, 
No. 19-18971-EEB (Bankr. D. Colo.) (Chapter 11 Case).
3  This 
triggered an automatic stay of proceedings against McGann under 
11 U.S.C. § 362. The bankruptcy court entered an order granting 
Plaintiffs relief from the automatic stay on May 4, 2020. The 
Fee Motion was reset for hearing on February 3, 2021. The 
bankruptcy court dismissed the Chapter 11 Case on September 1, 
2020. 
On December 22, 2020, McGann filed a petition under 
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, creating In re McGann, 
No. 20-18118-EEB (Bankr. D. Colo.) (Chapter 7 Case). McGann 
received a discharge on March 31, 2021. On July 25, 2022, 
Plaintiffs filed in the circuit court a certified copy of the 
Chapter 7 Case order granting a motion by Menehune Ventures and 
Braber [the Braber Plaintiffs] for relief from the automatic 
stay. The order stated: 
the relief sought by the Motion for Relief from Stay is
GRANTED and Movants, Menehune Ventures, LLC, and Nick 
Braber, are hereby granted relief from stay to proceed with

litigation against Sherry Ann McGann and Celestial
Properties in Civil Case Number 18-1-0206(2), Mary J.
Scheibel, Menehune Ventures, LLC, Worthy Clat [sic] Scott,
and Nick Braber v. Celestial Properties, Sherry Ann McGann,
and Does 1-20. 
(Emphasis added.) 
Scott filed a document in the circuit court on 
September 20, 2022. It stated: "I am entitled to reimbursement 
of my 1/4 share of the attorney fees and costs in this matter and 
request that the Court grant my request. Please be advised that 
[Scheibel] is deceased." The record does not contain an order in 
the Chapter 7 Case lifting the automatic stay as to Scott or 
Scheibel. 
The Fee Order was entered on December 12, 2022. It 
awarded $154,845.38 in fees and costs, to be paid "to Plaintiffs 
within thirty (30) days of the entry of the Order on this 
Motion*" and provided: 
*From any sum collected by pltfs from defendants 50% is to
be paid to Menehune Ventures, LLC and Nick Braber, 25% to
Worthy Clay Scott and 25% to Mary J. Scheibel. 
McGann filed her notice of appeal on December 16, 2022. 
We have jurisdiction because the Fee Order was a post-judgment 
order that ended proceedings on the Fee Motion, leaving nothing 
further to be accomplished. Ditto v. McCurdy
, 103 Hawai#i 153, 
157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003). 
On April 21, 2025, we ordered supplemental briefing on 
this issue: 
Was the Order Granting Fees entered in violation of the
bankruptcy stay in Case No. 20-18118-EEB to the extent it
awarded attorney fees and costs to Scheibel and Scott and,
if so, what is the legal effect of the violation? 
Supplemental briefs were filed by McGann, the Braber 
Plaintiffs, and Wilcox. 
Without citing legal authority, Wilcox argues that the 
bankruptcy court's May 4, 2020 order granting relief from the 
automatic stay in the Chapter 11 case applied to the Chapter 7 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
case. It did not. Wilcox didn't seek relief from the automatic 
stay in the Chapter 7 case on Scheibel's behalf. The circuit 
court's Fee Order awarding Scheibel attorneys fees thus violated 
the automatic stay. 
In the Tenth Circuit, of which Colorado is part, a 
debtor's creditors have an affirmative duty to conform their 
conduct to the automatic stay. See In re Pulliam, 262 B.R. 539, 
543 (Bankr. D. Kan. 2001) (creditor who initiated collection 
efforts without knowledge of bankruptcy had affirmative duty to 
restore status quo without debtor having to seek relief from 
bankruptcy court). The pre-petition Fee Motion, supplement, and 
reply memorandum did not specify the respective amounts paid by 
Scheibel, Scott, or the Braber Plaintiffs to their common 
attorney. Nor did Plaintiffs specify the amount each paid to 
reimburse their attorney for costs advanced. After the Braber 
Plaintiffs obtained the order terminating the automatic stay as 
to them, they should have amended the Fee Motion to specify the 
amount of fees and costs they paid — which were encompassed 
within the order lifting the automatic stay — as opposed to fees 
and costs paid by Scheibel and Scott, which were not. They did 
not. The circuit court thus ordered that half the amount 
collected from McGann
4 under the Fee Order be paid to Scheibel 
and Scott, in violation of 11 U.S.C. § 362. 
"The law in the Tenth Circuit is clear that actions 
taken in violation of the automatic stay are void ab initio; that 
is, they are without legal effect." In re C.W. Min. Co., 477 
B.R. 176, 191 (B.A.P. 10th Cir. 2012). The Braber Plaintiffs 
argue the Fee Order is valid as to them, and "should be revised 
to include a fee award in the entire amount to the Braber 
Plaintiffs only" (emphasis added). But that would be contrary to 
Scott's claim, to which the Braber Plaintiffs did not object, 
that he paid 1/4 of the fees being claimed. The Braber 
4 McGann and Celestial Properties were jointly and severally liable
under the Fee Order. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Plaintiffs violated the automatic stay by seeking to recover 
attorneys fees from McGann that were actually paid by Scott and 
Scheibel. They cite no authority for the proposition that an 
order in partial violation of the automatic stay is only 
partially void. 
We vacate the Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for 
Reimbursement of Reasonable Attorney's Fees and Costs entered by 
the circuit court on December 12, 2022, and remand for further 
proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order. All 
pending motions are denied.
