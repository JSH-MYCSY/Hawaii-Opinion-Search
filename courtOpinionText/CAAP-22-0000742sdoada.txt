 Statutes (HRS) § 708-841(1)(a) (Count 1),  and one count of 
Unauthorized Control of Propelled Vehicle in violation of HRS 
§ 708-836 (Count 2).   He pleaded no contest to both charges, and 
was sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of ten years for Count 1 and five years for Count 2.  He was also 
ordered to pay restitution. 32
  Nahalea alleges a single point of error on appeal, 
contending that the circuit court "erred in issuing its order of 
restitution because the complaining witness was fully reimbursed 
by his insurance company and the complaining witness's insurance 
provider did not request restitution."   
  
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issue raised by the parties, we 
resolve Nahalea's point of error as follows:  
 
2  HRS § 708- 841(1)(a) (2014) provides, in relevant part: 
 
§ 708-841 Robbery in the second degree.  (1) A person 
commits the offense of robbery in the second degree if, in the course of committing theft or non- consensual taking of 
a motor vehicle: 
(a) The person uses force against the person of anyone present with the intent to overcome that 
person's physical resistance or physical power 
of resistance[.] 
 
3  HRS § 708- 836 (2014) provides, in relevant part: 
  
§ 708-836 Unauthorized control of a propelled 
vehicle. (1) A person commits the offense of unauthorized 
control of a propelled vehicle if the person intentionally 
or knowingly exerts unauthorized control over another's propelled vehicle by operating the vehicle without the 
owner's consent or by changing the identity of the vehicle 
without the owner's consent. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

    This case arises out of the robbery of Nathaniel 
Finley (Finley) and the unauthorized control of his vehicle by 
Nahalea.  At a restitution hearing on December 16, 2022 
(Restitution Hearing), the circuit court awarded restitution in 
the amount of $12,101.29 to Finley.4  Of this amount, $464.57 was 
awarded for personal items that were in the vehicle and never recovered, namely: Nike shoes ($79.63); a Fitbit ($179.95); a 
Ridge wallet ($75); and a Kindle Paperwhite ($129.99).  The 
remainder of the restitution award, in the amount of $11,636.72, 
was for the stolen vehicle which, although recovered, was deemed 
to be a total loss by Finley's insurance company, USAA.  USAA compensated Finley in the amount of $11,636.72, which, as Finley 
testified, represented the value of the car.  Finley testified 
at the Restitution Hearing that, "[t]hey pretty much give me the 
-– through my insurance, the value of the –- the car." 
   In his opening brief, Nahalea contends that the 
circuit court erred in awarding restitution to Finley.  The 
State agrees that the circuit court erred in awarding restitution to Finley for the loss of his vehicle, citing the
 
 
4  Nahalea was also ordered to pay $267.31 in restitution to Ryan 
Finley, Finley's father, whose personal items were also taken from the car 
and not recovered.  Nahalea does not challenge the $267.31 restitution award to Ryan Finley on appeal.  Any challenge to the award to Ryan Finley is 
waived under Hawaiʻ i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4) and (7).

 Hawaiʻi Supreme Court's recent decision in State v. Borge, 152 
Hawaiʻi 458, 526 P.3d 435 (2023), as corrected, (May 11, 2023).5   
   Notwithstanding the State's confession of error, 
"appellate courts have an independent duty 'first to ascertain 
that the confession of error is supported by the record and 
well-founded in law and second to determine that such error is 
properly preserved and prejudicial.'"  State v. Veikoso, 
102 Hawaiʻ i 219, 221-22, 74 P.3d 575, 577-78 (2003) (quoting 
State v. Hoang, 93 Hawaiʻ i
 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000)).   
 HRS § 706-646 provides, in relevant part, that "[t]he 
court shall order the defendant to make restitution for 
reasonable and verified losses suffered by the victim or victims6 
as a result of the defendant's offense when requested by the victim," and, moreover, that "[r]estitution shall be a dollar amount that is sufficient to reimburse any victim fully for 
losses[.]"  HRS § 706-646 (Supp. 2019).  "The interpretation of 
a statute is a question of law.  Review is de novo, and the 
standard of review is right/wrong."  Borge, 152 Hawaiʻ i at 464, 
526 P.3d at 441 (quoting Kimura v. Kamalo, 106 Hawaiʻ i 501, 507, 
107 P.3d 430, 436 (2005)). 
 
5  Nahalea does not cite to State v. Borge.  His opening brief was 
filed the same day that the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court issued its published opinion 
in 
Borge, and he elected not to file a reply brief. 
 
6  "Victim" is defined by HRS § 706- 646 (2014), in relevant part, as 
"[t]he direct victim of a crime including a business entity, trust, or 
governmental entity."   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

  In Borge, the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court acknowledged that 
"HRS § 706-646 allows for restitution of a victim's losses that 
are (1) reasonable, (2) verified, (3) suffered as a result of 
the defendant's conduct, and (4) requested by the victim."  
Borge, 152 Hawaiʻ i at 467, 526 P.3d at 444 (citing State v. 
Demello, 136 Hawaiʻ i 193, 196, 361 P.3d 420, 423 (2015)) 
(emphasis omitted).  The Borge court applied this standard in 
overruling State v. Tuialii, 121 Hawaiʻ i 135, 214 P.3d 1125 (App. 
2009), and in holding that the circuit court abused its 
discretion in ordering the defendant to pay restitution, in the 
amount of the complaining witness's medical bills, because the 
complaining witness's insurance provider had covered some of the 
medical costs, and the rest were adjusted or written off.  See 
id. at 467, 526 P.3d at 444.  As the court explained, 
The plain language of HRS § 706- 646(3) does not allow a 
restitution award to include adjustments of bills written 
off by medical providers.  The victim never paid these 
amounts.  Hence, the victim does not need to be 
"reimbursed" for amounts never paid. 
 By the same token, this plain language does not allow a restitution award to a direct victim to include medical 
expenses paid by an insurer or indemnifier.  A direct victim has not paid these amounts, so there is nothing to 
"reimburse."   
 
Id. at 468, 526 P.3d at 445. 
 Borge is applicable here.  "HRS § 706-646(3) allows 
for restitution only for amounts sufficient to reimburse a 
victim fully for losses."  Id. at 467-68, 526 P.3d at 444-45. Under the reasoning in Borge, Finley cannot be "reimbursed" for
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
6 
 losses for which he has already been compensated.  USAA 
compensated Finley for the value of his vehicle,  and Finley is
therefore not entitled to be "reimbursed" for that amount under
HRS § 706-646(3)(a).  The circuit court therefore erred in 
awarding $11,636.72 in restitution for Finley's vehicle. 7  
 
 The circuit court did not err, however, in awarding 
$464.57 in restitution for the loss of Finley's personal items 
that were not recovered.  There is no evidence in the record 
that Finley's insurance provider paid for the cost of these 
personal items.  The record establishes that the $464.57 amount 
was reasonable, verified, suffered as a result of Nahalea's conduct, and requested by Finley.   
   For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the portion of 
the restitution award, in the amount of $11,636.72, that was 
awarded to compensate Finley for the loss of his vehicle; we 
affirm the award in all other respects.  We therefore vacate in 
part and affirm in part the circuit court's Amended Judgment of 
Conviction and Sentence, dated December 16, 2022, and remand for  
  
 
7  USAA did not itself request restitution for the $11,636.72 that 
it paid to Finley for the loss of his vehicle, and the collateral source rule 
does not apply to restitution under HRS § 706- 646.  Borge, 152 Hawaiʻ i at 469,
