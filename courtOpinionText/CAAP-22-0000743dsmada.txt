APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 3CCV-21-0000297) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that self-
represented Plaintiff-Appellant Howard Hofelich appeals from the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (circuit court) December 16, 
2022 "Findings of Facts, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting 
Defendants David Lawton, Esq. and Jung & Vassar, P.C.'s Motion to Designate Plaintiff Howard Hofelich a Vexatious Litigant and for an Order to Post Security and Prefiling Order" (Order).  We 
conclude that the court lacks appellate jurisdiction because the 
circuit court has not entered a final, appealable order or judgment.  See Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016); 
Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure Rules 54(b), 58; Jenkins v. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994).  Further, the Order is not independently 
appealable under the collateral-order doctrine, the Forgay1 
doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b).  See Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai# i 
249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (setting forth the requirements for appealability under the collateral-order doctrine and the Forgay doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (specifying requirements for leave to file interlocutory appeal).  
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed as moot.
