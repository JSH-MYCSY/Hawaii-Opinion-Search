APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
LÎHU# E DIVISION 
(CIVIL NO. 5RC-22-0000464) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Nakasone and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that self-
represented Defendant-Appellant Scott Kuroiwa appeals from the 
District Court of the Fifth Circuit, Lî hu#e Division's 
November 9, 2022 "Order Transferring the Rent Trust Fund Established in Civil No. 5RC-181-000106 on March 3, 2022 and the Balance on Deposit to Civil No. 5DRC-22-0000464 and Order Establishing Rent Trust Fund in 5DRC-22-0000464" (Transfer 
Order). 
We lack jurisdiction over the appeal, as the Transfer 
Order is not a final, appealable order, decree, or judgment. See 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016); District Court 
Rules of Civil Procedure Rules 54(b), 58. 
Further, the Transfer 
Order is not independently appealable under the collateral-order doctrine or the Forgay doctrine. See Greer v. Baker
, 137 Hawai# i NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (setting forth the 
requirements for appealability under the collateral-order doctrine and the Forgay doctrine). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED, that all pending motions 
are dismissed.
