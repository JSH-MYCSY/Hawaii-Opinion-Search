NO. CAAP-22-0000747 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
NOE RAQUINIO, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CPC-22-0000941) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that self-
represented Defendant-Appellant Noe Raquinio appeals from the 
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit's "decision and order" purportedly entered on December 19, 2022.  We conclude that the court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal because no order was entered on December 19, 2022, and the circuit court has not entered a judgment in the underlying proceeding.  Hawaii RevisedStatutes ยง 641-11 (2016); see State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai# i 482, 
486, 403 P.3d 259, 263 (2017).  
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, January 4, 2023.
