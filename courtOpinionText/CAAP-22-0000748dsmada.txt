(CASE NO. 3FDA-22-0001094) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Guidry, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that:

were due on or before March 3, 2023, and April 3, 2023, respectively; 
(2) Self-represented Petitioner-Appellant SC failed to 
file either document, or request an extension of time; 
(3)
 On May 1, 2023, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief, notifying SC that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the court's attention on May 11, 2023, for appropriate action, which could include dismissal of the appeal, under 
Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 12.1(e) and 30, 
and SC could request relief from default by motion; and 
(4)
 The appellate clerk mailed the default notice to SC 
at her address on record. The United States Postal Service returned the default notice as undeliverable as addressed and unable to forward. SC has not filed a notice of change of NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

action in this appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
