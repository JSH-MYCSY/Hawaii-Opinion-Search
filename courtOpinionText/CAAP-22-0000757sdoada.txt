2022 "Order Granting Defendant[ -Appellee] Ann Ross' [(Ross)] 
Motion for Summary Judgment " (Order); and (2) February 21, 2024 
"Final Judgment Dismissing with Prejudice All Claims Against 
[Ross]" (Judgment ). 
This appeal arises out of a dispute between the Frosts 
and the Association of Apartment Owners of Pu ‘u Po‘a(AOAO). The 
Frosts owned a ground -floor apartment in the Pu ‘u Po‘a 
condominium complex. Ross served terms as President and Vice 
President of the AOAO Board of Directors ( AOAO Board). In June 
2020, the Frosts filed the operative "First Amended Complaint 
for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief " (First Amended 
Complaint ), naming the AO AO, Hawaiiana Management Company , Ltd., 2 
and Ross as defendants, and challeng ing the AOAO Board's plan to 
assess all apartment owners equally for work to the lanais and 
atria of the second through fourth floor apartments. The Frosts 
contended , inter alia, that owner approval was required for the 
AOAO Board's expenditure of reserve funds for work performed on 
the lanais and atria because they were not common element s. 
Ross moved for summary judgment on the ground that she 
was immune from personal liability pursuant to Hawaii Revised 
2 The AOAO and Hawaiiana Management Company , Ltd. are nominal 
appellee s in this appeal.

Statutes (HRS) §§ 414D-149(f)  (2004)  and 514B-106(a)  (2018).   
The circuit court granted summary judgment  in favor of Ross, and 
dismissed all claims asserted by the Frosts against Ross. The 
Frosts appealed.  4 3
The Frosts raise a single point of error on appeal, 
contending  that the circuit court erred in granting summary 
judgment in favor of Ross.   Upon careful review of the record 
and the briefs submitted by the parties,  and having given due 
consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced, 
we resolve this appeal as follows.  5 
3 HRS § 414D -149(f) provides, in relevant part: 
Any person who serves as a director to the corporation 
without remuneration or expectation of remuneration shall 
not be liable for damage, injury, or loss caused by or 
resulting from the person's performance of, or failure to 
perform duties of, the position to which the person was 
elected or appointed, unless the person was grossly 
negligent in the performance of, or failure to perform, 
such duties. 
4 HRS § 514 B-106(a) states that "[i]n the performance of their 
duties, officers and members of the board shall owe the association a 
fiduciary duty and exercise the degree of care and loyalty required of an 
officer or director of a corporation organized under chapter 414D." 
5  The Frosts assert that discovery was not closed when the circuit 
court granted summary judgment. We  note, however,  that the Frosts did not 
request a continuance as permitted by Hawai ʻi Rules of Civil Procedure  (HRCP )  
Rule 56(f). Therefore, any contention that the trial court abused its 
discretion in acting upon Ross' motion for summary judgment, and not continuing the hearing, has been waived.  See  Exotics Haw.- Kona, Inc. v. E.I. 
du Pont d e Nemours & Co., 116 Hawaiʻ i 277, 308 -09, 172 P.3d 1021, 1052 -53 
(2007)  (holding that a plaintiff who did not request a HRCP Rule 56(f) 
continuance cannot complain on appeal that the circuit court granted summary judgment based on the party's submissions). By the time that the Frosts 
filed their memorandum in opposition, it had been more than two years since 
they filed their First Amended Complaint and the circuit c ourt was not 
obligated to sua sponte continue the hearing.

"On appeal, the grant or denial of summary judgment is 
reviewed de novo." Ralston v. Yim, 129 Hawaiʻi 46, 55, 292 P.3d 
1276, 1285 (2013) (citation omitted). The court applies the 
following standard,  
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on 
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there 
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the 
moving party is entitled to j udgment as a matter of law. A 
fact is material if proof of that fact would have the 
effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential 
elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the 
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light most 
favorable to the non -moving party. In other words, we must 
view all of the evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in 
the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion .

The record reflects that Ross satisfied her burden of 
production. To support her assertion that she was immune from personal liability  pursuant to HRS § 414D-149, Ross submitted  
her own  declaration, as well as declarations  from Jeffrey M. 
Frank (Frank) and Philip Justo ( Justo). Ross also submitted  a 
copy of the Bylaws  of the AOAO, which were in effect during her 
tenure and defined the AOAO Board's duties.  Ross stated that 
all  of her actions as President and Vice  President of the AOAO 
Board to approve owner modifications were carried out by and 
through the AOAO Board, and that she  "did not take  any  
unilateral action with respect to the [Frosts']  various requests 
to modify their unit."   Ross also represented  that she "did not 
enter into any personal contract with the [Frosts]."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Frank and Justo served as the AOAO Board President at 
different times, and their tenures coincided in part with the 
time that Ross served as Vice President. Both Frank and Justo 
confirmed that Ross did not take any unilateral action with 
respect to the Frosts' various requests to modify their unit, 
and that all actions to approve owner modifications were by and 
through the AOAO Board. 
Through the above declarations , Ross established that 
the Frosts' requests were acted upon by the AOAO Board itself. 
See Ralston, 129 Hawaiʻi at 60, 292 P.3d at 1290 (" [A] summary 
judgment movant may satisfy his or her initial burden of 
production by either (1) presenting evidence negating an element 
of the non -movant's claim, or (2) demonstrating that the 
nonmovant will be unable to carry his or her burden of proof at 
trial.") (citation s omitted) . The burden then shifted to the 
Frosts to establish that they were challenging actions that Ross 
did not perform in her capacity as a Board officer, or that 
Ross' official actions were performed in a "grossly negligent" 
manner. See id. at 57-58, 292 P.3d at 1286 -87. The Frosts did 
not satisfy this burden. 
To dispute that Ross was entitled to immunity under 
HRS § 414D -149, the Frosts submitted a declaration from Sherri 
and a declaration from their counsel purporting to authenticate 
exhibits. Sherri stated she served on the AOAO Board alongside

Ross from April 2016 to October 2016 , and that Ross had taken 
various "unilateral" actions . Sherri contended that , in 2016, 
Ross "unilaterally approved " a $4,000 payment via e -mail for 
contractor invoices for handrails for foot wash stations. 
Sherri further contended that , in 2015, Ross "unilaterally 
signed" contracts for work related to waterproofing and tiling 
for upper -floor owners' private lanais, in amounts exceeding 
$50,000, without taking a vote for owner approval. The Frosts 
introduced no evidence that Ross was acting in any capacity 
other than as the President, or that she was "grossly negligent " 
in taking these actions . 
The Frosts further contended that Ross could be held 
personally liable to them for alleged retaliation by Ross to 
them personally. The Frosts claimed retaliation in conjunction 
with: (1) a replacement door project ; (2) their requests to 
remove a pony wall and to install jalousies and a larger lanai 
slider within their unit ; (3) their complaints of water 
intrusion from the upper floor atria; and (4) their requests for 
documents. The Frosts did not, however, produce any evidence , 
other than conclusory alleg ations, to support their contentions 
that Ross retaliated against them with regard to any of those 
projects or requests . 
On this record, and for the foregoing reasons, we 
determine that the circuit court did not err in granting summary 
6

judgment in favor of Ross. We therefore affirm the November 30, 
2022 Order , and the February 21, 2024 Judgment .
