APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 1CC141002485)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Chan, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that
Defendant/Cross-Claimant-Appellant Shichinin LLC ( Shichinin )
appeals from the following orders entered by the Circuit Court of
the First Circuit ( Circuit Court)in Civil No. 1CC141002485: (1)
the April 1, 2022 "Order Denying [Shichinin's] Motion to Vacate
Arbitration Award and Ex Parte Motions for Issuance of Commission
to Take Out-of-state Depositions Without Prejudice"; (2)the
June 30, 2022 "Order Denying Shichinin, LLC's Motion to Confirm
Arbitration Award, Filed April 4, 2022 Without Prejudice"; and
(3) the December 15, 2022 "Order Explaining Why it is Not
Possible or Appropriate for this Court to Enter a Final
Appealable Order or Judgment."  We conclude that the court lacks
appellate jurisdiction because, among other reasons, the Circuit
Court has not entered a final, appealable judgment or order under
Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 658A-28(a) (2016). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
