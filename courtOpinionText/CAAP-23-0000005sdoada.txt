SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Guidry, JJ.)  
Defendant -Appellant Puletua Wilson ( Wilson) appeals in 
CAAP-23-0000005 from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence 
(Judgment ), filed by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit

(circuit court ) on November 15, 2022,1 for Manslaughter in 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 707-702(1)(a) 
(2014).2 Wilson appeals in CAAP -23-0000401 from the circuit 
court's Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence 
Filed on February 10, 2023, entered on January 17, 2024.3 
This case involves an October 2017 car accident in 
which Wilson, who was driving the car, swerved off a cliff. His 
passenger, Troy Kaho ʻoilihala, Jr. ( Kaho ʻoilihala ) was ejected 
from the car and died. In December 2018, Wilson was charged by 
indictment with Manslaughter. A jury found Wilson guilty as 
charged in July 2022. In November 2022, the circuit court 
sentenced Wilson to an indeterminate prison term of 20 yea rs. 
Wilson argues five points of error on appeal. In 
CAAP-23-0000005,4 he contends that the circuit court erred by: 
1 The Honorable Paul B.K. Wong presided. 
2 HRS § 707 -702(1)(a) states, in pertinent part, "[a] person 
commits the offense of manslaughter if . . . [t]he person recklessly causes 
the death of another person[.]" 
3 CAAP-23-0000401 was consolidated with CAAP -23-0000005 on 
March 13, 2024 , under CAAP -23-0000005. Prior to consolidation, this court 
temporarily remanded CAAP -23-0000401 to the circuit court for entry of a 
written and signed order disposing of the motion to reconsider. The circuit 
court entered the written and signed order on January 17, 2024. Wilson's 
appeal in CAAP -23-0000401 is timely taken from the January 17, 2024 order. 
4   Wilson fails to present any argument on the points of error that 
he lists as 3 and 5, and we therefore disregard them. Kahoʻohanohano v. Dep't 
of Hum. Servs., State of 
Hawaiʻi, 117 Hawaiʻ i 262, 297 n.37, 178 P.3d 538, 573 
n.37 (2008) (the appellate court will "disregard a particular contention if 
the appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that position"); 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may 
be deemed waived."). The four points of error on which Wilson presents 
argument are renumbered and addressed in turn.

(1) denying Wilson's motions to dismiss "for pre -indictment 
delay and for speedy -trial and Rule -48 delay"; (2) denying 
Wilson's motion to quash the State's search warrant authorizing 
"buccal swabs and DNA testing [,]" and allowing the testimony of 
the State's DNA expert; (3) denying Wilson's motion s for 
judgment of acquittal , and affirming the jury verdict "despite 
insufficient evidence of reckless intent"; and (4) "wrongly 
balanc[ing] the probation factors under HRS § 706 -621[,]" and 
"fail[ing] to state on the record its reasoning under HRS § 706 -
606 for the harshest sentence available – twenty years of 
prison." In CAAP-23-0000401, he contends that the circuit court 
erred by denying his motion for reconsideration of his 
indeterminate 20 -year prison sentence.5 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve 
Wilson's points of error as follows: 
(1) Wilson contends that the circuit court erred in 
denying his January 2020  Motion to Dismiss Indictment for 
Violation of Defendant's Rights to Due Process and to a Fair 
Trial (January 2020  motion), and his February 2020  Motion to 
Dismiss for Pre-Indictment Delay, or in the Alternative, for 
Violation of Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure ( HRPP)  Rule 48 
5 We address the single point of error that Wilson raises in 
CAAP-23-0000401 in section (5) below. 
3   
 
   
  
   
 
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(February 202 0 motion). Wilson's January 202 0 motion alleged 
that the pre -indictment delay violated his Due Process rights; 
Wilson's February 202 0 motion alleged a violation of HRPP 
Rule 48 and his right to a speedy trial . 
In August 202 0, the circuit court entered its Findings 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Denying Defendant's Motion 
to Dismiss for Pre -Indictment Delay, or in the Alternative, for 
Violation of HRPP Rule 48. The record reflects that the parties 
had stipulated to the circuit court's 48 findings of fact. 
"[W]hether those facts fall within HRPP 48(b)'s exclusionary 
provisions is a question of law, the determination of which is 
freely reviewable pursuant to the 'right/wrong' test." State v. 
Hernane, 145 Hawaiʻi 444, 449, 454 P.3d 385, 390 (2019) (citation 
omitted) . 
Consistent with the stipulated facts, the circuit 
court determined that Wilson had not demonstrated that the pre -
indictment delay caused him actual substantial prejudice. 
State v. Higa, 102 Hawaiʻi 183, 187, 74 P.3d 6, 10 (2003) ("When 
a defendant alleges a violation of due process based on a 
preindictment delay, the court must employ a balancing test, 
considering actual substantial prejudice to the defendant 
against the reasons asserted for the de lay.") (citation 
omitted). 
4   
 
  
     
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Moreover , the circuit court concluded that, of the 441 
calendar days that had elapsed from the time of his indictment 
to the filing of his February 202 0 motion, Wilson had executed 
and filed written HRPP Rule 48 and speedy trial waivers for 372 
of those days. Given those waivers, which the circuit court 
concluded it "cannot ignore[,]" Wilson did not suffer pre -trial 
delay in violation of HRPP Rule 48 or his speedy trial rights.6 
See HRPP 48(c)(3) (excluding from the computation of time 
"periods that delay the commencement of trial and are caused by 
a continuance granted at the request or with the consent of the 
defendant or defendant's counsel"). 
The circuit court's conclusions were not wrong. On 
this record, the circuit court did not err in denying Wilson's 
motions to dismiss. 
(2) We resolve Wilson's contentions regarding the DNA 
evidence as follows. First, Wilson asserts that the circuit 
court erred in "den[ying] [Wilson ]'s motion to quash [the 
State]'s search warrant authorizing, four years into the case, 
buccal swabs and DNA testing on [Wilson][.]" Aside from a 
conclusory statement about "the lateness of the [State]'s 
request" for DNA gathering, Wilson provides no legal support for 
6 Wilson does not deny that he consented to these waivers and 
continuances of trial. He contends instead that his consent was "coerced" 
due to the State's failure to timely disclose discovery materials, and relies 
on the mere fact of the State's alleged del ay, without pointing to evidence 
of coercion. 
5   
 
  
  
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
his argument, and it is therefore deemed waived. See HRAP 
Rule 28(b)(7). 
Second, Wilson did not object to the circuit court's 
admission of DNA expert Michelle Amorin's testimony. 
"[O]bjections to the admission of incompetent evidence, which a 
party failed to raise at trial, are generally not subject to 
plain error review." State v. Metcalf e, 129 Hawaiʻi 206, 225, 
297 P.3d 1062, 1081 (2013) (citation omitted). We therefore do 
not consider Wilson's contention, raised for the first time on 
appeal, that the circuit court erred by admitting the DNA 
expert's testimony, including ev idence relating to "statistical 
analysis." 
(3) Wilson contends that the circuit court erred in 
denying Wilson's motions for judgment of acquittal because the 
record contains insufficient evidence to establish Wilson's 
"reckless intent[,]" and because Kaho ʻoilihala's "death by 
ejection" was "too remote or accidental" to be within the risk 
of which Wilson was aware. 
The standard to be applied by the trial court in ruling 
upon a motion for a judgment of acquittal is whether, upon 
the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the 
prosecution and in full recognition of the province of the 
[trier of fact], a reasonable mind might fairly conclude 
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. An appellate court 
employs the same standard of review. 
State v. Carroll , 146 Hawaiʻi 138, 150, 456 P.3d 502, 514 (2020) 
(quoting State v. Keawe , 107 Hawaiʻi 1, 4, 108 P.3d 304, 307 
6   
 
  
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2005)) (brackets in quotation ). Applying this standard, we 
determine that Wilson's contention lacks merit. 
Evidence was adduced by the State at trial that, prior 
to the car accident, Wilson was "intoxicated [,]" "stumbling," 
and "slurring when [he was] talking" prior to the time he 
"jumped into the driver's seat." Moreover, Wilson "was 
speeding" and "swerving" over "dips" in the road. One witness 
testified that Wilson was driving "[m]aybe like 100 [ mph], I'm 
not too sure, but I was going like probably 80, and I still 
couldn't catch up to them." At one point, the driver and 
passenger in the car following the ve hicle driven by Wilson was 
"on the phone with 911" to report that Wilson was "drinking and 
driving" and asking that "somebody [be sent] out to stop them 
because we couldn't stop them." While on this call, "[the car 
Wilson was driving] did end up crashing, colliding with another 
vehicle and going off the C liff." 
On this record, the circuit court did not err by 
denying the motions for judgment of acquittal. 
(4) Wilson contends that the circuit court abused its 
discretion in sentencing Wilson to an indeterminate 20 -year 
prison term, instead of probation. "A sentencing judge 
generally has broad discretion in imposing a sentence. The 
applicable standard of rev iew for sentencing or resentencing 
matters is whether the court committed plain and manifest abuse 
7   
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
   
 
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of discretion in its decision." State v. Canosa , 152 Hawaiʻi 
145, 154, 523 P.3d 1059, 1068 (2023) (cleaned up). 
Wilson was convicted of the class A offense of 
manslaughter. HRS § 707 -702(1)(a). The circuit court thus, 
pursuant to HRS §§ 706 -620 (2014)7 and 706-659 (2014),8 had the 
discretion to sentence Wilson to either probation or an 
indeterminate prison sentence of 20 years. In imposing a 
sentence, the circuit court considered the factors set forth in 
HRS § 706 -606 (2014) and, with respect to probation, HRS § 706 -
621 (2014). HRS § 706 -606(3) ("The court, in determining the 
particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider . . . [t]he 
kinds of sentences available[.]"); State v. Hussein , 122 Hawaiʻi 
495, 500 -01, 229 P.3d 313, 318-19 (2010) ("A sentencing court 
must consider all sentencing options, since such consideration 
is mandated by HRS § 706 -606(3)."). 
The record reflects that the circuit court considered 
all ten probation factors set forth in HRS § 706 -621(2). Among 
other things, the circuit court found that, with respect to 
HRS § 706-621(2)(a), "here the conduct resulted in the death of 
7 HRS § 706 -620 states, in relevant part, "[a] defendant who has 
been convicted of a crime may be sentenced to a term of probation unless 
. . . (2) The crime is a class A felony, except class A felonies defined 
. . . by section 707 -702[.]" 
8 HRS § 706 -659 states, in relevant part, " [a] person who has been 
convicted of a class A felony defined in . . . section 707 -702, may be 
sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment. . . . When ordering such 
a sentence, the court shall impose the maximum length of imprisonment which 
shall be twenty years." 
8   
 
   
 
 
    
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
another person, and there can be no greater loss and no greater 
harm than that." The circuit court determined that this factor, 
among others, weighed against probation. The circuit court thus 
considered, inter alia , "[t]he need for the sentence imposed" 
"[t]o reflect the seriousness of the offense," "and to provide 
just punishment for the offense[.]" HRS § 706 -606(2)(a). In so 
doing, the circuit court "articulated a meaningful rationale for 
the sentence in light o f the factors set forth in HRS § 706 -
606." State v. Kong , 131 Hawaiʻi 94, 104, 315 P.3d 720, 730 
(2013) (quotation omitted) . 
On this record, we conclude that the circuit court did 
not abuse its discretion in sentencing Wilson to an 
indeterminate 20 -year prison sentence. 
(5) Wilson contends that the circuit court "erred 
where it denied [Wilson ]'s motion for reconsideration of 
sentence after the Court wrongly balanced the probation factors 
under HRS § 706 -621 and thereafter issued the harshest sentence 
available – twenty years of prison." 
"A circuit court's ruling with regard to a party's 
motion for reconsideration is reviewed on appeal for an abuse of 
discretion." State v. Oughterson , 99 Hawaiʻi 244, 253, 54 P.3d 
415, 424 (2002) (citation omitted) . Wilson's motion for 
reconsideration did not raise a new argument that could not have 
been presented earlier, but instead reiterated his contention 
9   
 
   
 
  
 
  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that the factors set forth in HRS § 706-621 weighed in favor of 
probation. Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw.  
85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 27  (1992) ("The purpose of a motion for 
reconsideration is to allow the parties to present new evidence 
and/or arguments that could not have been presented . . . 
earlier[.]"). We conclude, on this record and for the reasons 
set forth in section (4) supra, that the circuit court did not 
abuse its discretion in denying Wilson's motion for reconsideration.  
For the foregoing reasons, the circuit court's 
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, filed on November 15, 2022, 
and the Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence 
Filed on February 10, 2023, entered on January 17, 2024, are 
affirmed.
