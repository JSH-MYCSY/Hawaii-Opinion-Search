OSCAR CARDONA, Defendant-Appellant   
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

with one count of Murder in the Second Degree in violation of 
Hawaii Revised Statutes §§ 707 -701.5 (Supp. 2019) and 706 -656 
(2014). The matter proceeded to a jury trial, which commenced 
on August 24, 2022. On September 2, 2022, the jury found 
Cardona gui lty as charged. On December 13, 2022, Cardona was 
sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. 
Cardona contends on appeal that the deputy prosecuting 
attorney ( DPA) committed prosecutorial misconduct by: (1) 
"offering his personal opinions about witness credibility, 
including an attack on Cardona's credibility solely based on 
[his] party status [as defendant]"; and (2) by "testifying as a 
witness in his own case, an d by asking excessive leading 
questions." Cardona further contends that the circuit court 
erred: (1) "when it did not provide a State v. Gabriel 
[No. CAAP-19-0000609, 2022 WL 1284613, (Haw. App. Apr. 29, 2022) 
(mem. op.) ] limiting instruction [to the jury] in response to 
[testifying police officers'] Police Identifications of Cardona 
from video evidence"; and (2) "when it provided the 'Voluntary 
Act' instruction" to the jury. Upon careful review of the 
record and the briefs submitted by the parties, and having given 
due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues

Revised Statutes.

raised by the parties, we resolve Cardona's points of error as 
follows: 
(1) We conclude that the DPA did not commit 
prosecutorial misconduct by offering his personal opinion s on 
witness credibility, and/or attacking Cardona's credibility 
based on his defendant party status. 
 "The term prosecutorial misconduct is a legal term of 
art that refers to any improper action committed by a 
prosecutor, however harmless or unintentional." State v. 
Conroy, 148 Hawaiʻi 194, 201, 468 P.3d 208, 215 (2020) (cleaned 
up). 
We review contentions of prosecutorial misconduct under 
the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard.  See  State v. 
Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai ʻi 235, 247, 178 P.3d 1, 13 (2008).   
Cardona contends that the DPA committed prosecutorial 
misconduct through, inter alia , the following remarks during 
trial: (1) comments perceived as referencing Cardona's allegedly 
poor eyesight;3 (2) his use of the term " [Waikīkī] wrecking 
crew," which was in reference to other individuals that Cardona 
was with during the night of the incident; (3) his asking 
Cardona, during cross -examination, to demonstrate his actions 
using a pen rather than a knife because "I don't want to give 
3 These included the DPA's remark that he needed to remove his own 
glasses because they were "fogging up" ( the DPA was wearing a face mask, 
consistent with the court's COVID -19 protocol), the closing statement remarks 
that "[t]here's no credible, independent evidence that [Cardona] had an eye 
problem" (emphasis added), and "[y]ou take off your glasses, you get up close 
to somebody, maybe you might see, but you see a figure."

you the knife"; and (4) his general observation during closing 
statement, not specifically directed at Cardona, that " People 
lie. The evidence doesn't lie .". 
When reviewed in context, the DPA's remarks were 
either benign statements, or reasonable inferences that could be 
drawn from the record facts. State v. Tuua , 125 Hawaiʻi 10, 14, 
250 P.3d 273, 277 (2011) ("prosecutors are entitled to draw 
reasonable inferences from the evidence .") (citations omitted). 
As such, we conclude that the statements did not constitute 
improper expressions of the DPA's personal views regarding 
Cardona's guilt and /or credibility as a witness. 
We further conclude that the DPA's repeated use of 
leading questions throughout trial was harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt. 
It appears, based on our review of the record, that 
Cardona objected to the DPA's leading questions numerous times 
during the DPA's direct examination of various State witnesses. 
We conclude that the circuit court properly exercised its 
discretion in sust aining these objections where warranted, 
instructing the DPA to ask "open -ended questions" only, and, as 
appropriate, striking leading questions and answers from the 
record.4 State v. Pasene , 144 Hawaiʻi 339, 367, 439 P.3d 864, 
4 Although we reject Cardona's argument that his conviction should 
be vacated based on the DPA's numerous leading questions, we do so based on 
the circuit court's prompt, proper, and curative management of the DPA's 
(continued . . .)

892 (2019) ( determining that "the circuit court's actions were 
sufficient to cure the impropriety of the DPA's conduct" with 
respect to his questioning of a witness, where "the circuit 
court acted properly to promptly sustain each of defense 
counsel's objections and to issue curative instructions where 
necessary ."). 
(2)  We  conclude  that  the  circuit  court  did  not  err  in  
its  instructions  to  the  jury.   "When  jury  instructions  or  the  
omission  thereof  are  at  issue  on  appeal,  the  standard  of  review  
is  whether,  when  read  and  considered  as  a  whole,  the  
instructions  given  are  prejudicially  insufficient,  erroneous,  
inconsistent,  or  misleading."   State  v.  Nichols,  111  Hawaiʻi  327,  
334,  141  P.3d  974,  981  (2006)  (citation  omitted).  
On this record, we conclude that the lack of a 
limiting instruction, regarding the testifying officers' 
identification of Cardona from video evidence, was not 
prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or 
misleading. Moreover, the circuit court did not err in its sua 
4(. . . continued) 
conduct, and our assessment that there is no reasonable possibility that the 
DPA's conduct might have contributed to Cardona's conviction. We 
nevertheless note that the DPA's repeated asking of leading questions, in 
spite of the circuit court's directions to the contrary, does not promote a 
positive image of the legal profession, does not assist the court and/or the 
jury in reviewing the case, and does not display appropriate respect for the 
criminal justice system. Cf. Section 12 of the Guidelines of Professional 
Courtesy and Civility for Hawai ʻi Lawyers.

First  Circuit  on  December  13,  2022.
