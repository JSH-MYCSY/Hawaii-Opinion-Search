Defendants-Appellants Bonnie I. Swink and Jack Swink 
(collectively, the Swinks) appeal from the December 12, 2022 
Judgment of the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court),
2 entered in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee US Bank National 
Association, as Trustee for Credit Suisse First Boston Mortgage Securities Corp. CSMC Mortgage-Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-6 (US Bank). 
The Swinks contend the Circuit Court erred: (1) "in 
holding that the applicable date for determining whether US Bank and its predecessor had possession of the note was the date of the First Amended Complaint" (Amended Complaint) filed on September 8, 2021, "rather than the date the original Complaint was filed" on December 9, 2014; and (2) in granting summary judgment where US Bank did not prove, through admissible evidence of the prior loan servicer's records, that "the default letter of April 3, 2014 was sent to the Swinks." 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve the Swinks' points of error as follows. 
US Bank filed a December 9, 2014 Complaint for 
foreclosure on a property (Property) secured by a promissory note (Note) and a mortgage executed by the Swinks, following the Swinks' default on the Note. US Bank's 2017 summary judgment against the Swinks was vacated on appeal, for lack of admissible evidence establishing that US Bank possessed the Note at the time the Complaint was filed. 
On remand, US Bank filed the Amended Complaint on 
September 8, 2021. On September 14, 2022, US Bank filed a

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
motion for summary judgment on the Amended Complaint, which was 
granted. On December 12, 2022, the Circuit Court filed its "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting [US Bank]'s Motion for Summary Judgment Against All Defendants and 
for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure" (MSJ Order) and entered 
the Judgment, from which the Swinks timely appealed. 
We review the grant of summary judgment de novo. U.S.
Bank, N.A. v. Mattos, 140 Hawaiʻ i 26, 30, 398 P.3d 615, 619 
(2017). 
A foreclosing plaintiff must establish standing by 
showing it had the right to enforce the note when its complaint 
was filed. Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawaiʻ i 361, 
368, 390 P.3d 1248, 1255 (2017). 
(1) The Swinks argue US Bank had to prove possession 
of the Note on the date the original Complaint was filed, 
relying on the "standing at inception" rule applied in other 
jurisdictions. 
The Swinks argue the Circuit Court's grant of 
summary judgment was erroneous because US Bank lacked standing. 
US Bank points to this court's decision in Hanalei, 
BRC Inc. v. Porter, 7 Haw. App. 304, 760 P.2d 676 (App. 1988), which predates the 2017 Reyes-Toledo case, to argue that this precedent indicates that US Bank "should be permitted to establish standing as of the date it filed its Amended Complaint." 
In Porter, the creditor plaintiff filed suit for 
nonpayment on a note, when it "did not have actual possession of the Note when the original complaint was filed on June 28, 1985." Id. at 309, 760 P.2d at 680. This court explained that 
in the amended complaint filed on February 11, 1987, the creditor plaintiff "alleged that it was a holder of the Note[,]" and appended evidence as such. Id.This court stated: 
3  
  
 
 
  
   
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
[A]s a general rule, an action cannot be maintained if it 
is prematurely commenced before the accrual of the cause of 
action which is sought to be enforced. However, " the error 
or defect of premature commencement may be cured by filing 
an amended or supplemental complaint after the cause of 
action has accrued, unless the amended complaint states a 
different cause of action." 1A C.J.S Actions § 238 at 713 
(1985). See also Thompson v. Meyers, 211 Kan. 26, 33, 505 
P.2d 680, 686 (1973). Here, [p]laintiff cured the error of premature filing by filing its amended complaint on 
February 11, 1987, when [p]laintiff was in possession of 
the [n]ote and a holder thereof. 
Id. at 310, 760 P.2d at 680 (brackets omitted). 
The 2017 Reyes-Toledo opinion cited Porter as 
supporting authority, but noted in a footnote that: 
It is noted that the Porter case allowed for the curing of 
the premature commencement by the filing of an amended 
complaint after the plaintiff came into possession of the 
instrument. We note that this case does not present the issue of whether an amended complaint will cure the 
premature filing of a foreclosure action, and therefore we 
do not address this aspect of the Porter case. 
Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawaiʻi at 368 n.12, 390 P.3d at 1255 n.12. 
This case presents the identical issue as 
Porter, 
because the Amended Complaint here, which stated the same 
foreclosure cause of action as the original Complaint, cured the error of the premature filing of the original Complaint. SeePorter, 7 Haw. App. at 310, 760 P.2d at 680. "An amended complaint supersedes the original complaint and renders the original complaint of no legal effect." Jou v. Siu, No. CAAP-12-0000119, 2013 WL 1187559, at *2 (Haw. App. Mar. 22, 2013) (mem. op.) (citing Beneficial Haw., Inc. v. Casey, 
98 Hawaiʻ i 159, 167, 45 P.3d 359, 367 (2002)). 
The Circuit Court's conclusion that US Bank "had 
possession of the original note, indorsed in blank, on 
09/08/2021[,]" the date of the Amended Complaint, was correct. The Circuit Court did not err by granting summary judgment on 
4

the grounds that US Bank had standing. See Mattos, 140 Hawaiʻ i 
at 30, 398 P.3d at 619. 
(2) The Swinks argue that US Bank "is unable to prove 
that the default letter of April 3, 2014 was sent to the Swinks 
because that letter was sent by the prior loan servicer, Wells Fargo Home Mortgage" (Wells Fargo). The Swinks contend the Wells Fargo records were inadmissible because the "trustworthiness" of the prior loan servicer's incorporated records was not established under Verhagen and Yata, which 
require that the testimony establishing the trustworthiness of 
the incorporated records to describe "pre-incorporation vetting" by the current servicer. See U.S. Bank Tr., N.A. as Tr. for
LSF9 Master Participation Tr. v. Verhagen, 149 Hawaiʻ i 315, 326, 
489 P.3d 419, 430 (2021); Deutsche Bank Nat'l Tr. Co. as Tr. for 
Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. Tr. 2006-NC4 v. Yata, 
152 Hawaiʻ i 322, 334, 526 P.3d 299, 311 (2023). The Swinks 
specifically challenge the declaration of Steven B. Ross, an 
officer or employee of US Bank's loan servicer, Specialized Loan Servicing LLC (
SLS) (Ross Declaration) because the declaration 
"did not adequately explain that there was a due diligence review of the documents[.]" 
We conclude the Ross Declaration contained sufficient 
information of "pre-incorporation vetting," establishing circumstances indicating the trustworthiness of the incorporated 
records from Wells Fargo. See Verhagen
 149 Hawaiʻi at 326, 
489 P.3d at 430. It stated in pertinent part: 
12. A portion of the business records for the loan 
in this matter were created by a prior servicer, the prior 
servicer's records for the loan were integrated and boarded 
into SLS's systems, such that the prior servicer's records 
concerning the loan are now part of SLS's business records. SLS maintains quality control and verification procedures 
as part of the boarding process to ensure the accuracy of the boarded records. . . .

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST 'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  
13. For loans that service transfer to SLS, the 
company utilizes a proprietary software system called the Pre-Boarding System ("PBS") to complete a comprehensive, 
examination of the loan data for accuracy and make any 
needed corrections prior to final boarding of the loan data 
into the System of Record ("LoanServ"). When SLS receives
the loan data from the prior servicer for the loans that will be boarded, trained Data Analysts at SLS load the data into PBS for manual review and to conduct multi[-] step 
audits of the data. 
14. A key function of PBS is the tool called Edit 
Checks, which is an automated loan data audit program, which runs on the loan data multiple times through 
different accuracy checks and audit queries. Edit Checks
search the loan data for common violations of servicing business rules such as amortization errors, illogical 
condition exceptions, and conflicting or missing data and also validates the data when no errors or violations are 
discovered. When errors and/or violations are discovered
through Edit Checks, they are reviewed manually, and the 
necessary corrections are made to the loan data and the 
Edit Checks process is rerun until the tool no longer finds 
errors in the data. 
15. Upon completion of all audits and quality 
control on PBS, the loan data is pre- boarded to LoanServ 
without activating the loans to prevent usage before a final audit clearance. This interim step allows SLS to 
determine and resolve any system and data errors that may 
only be discovered in final form in LoanServ prior to 
activation of the loans. Once the loan data has cleared
this pre- boarding audit process, then the final boarding of 
the loans occur and the loan data is activated in LoanServ. 
(Emphases added.)   The Circuit Court did not err by admitting 
the default letter,  and the grant of summary judgment was not 
erroneous in this regard. See Mattos, 140 Hawaiʻ i at 30, 
398 P.3d at 619. 3
3 The only item of evidence the Swinks present specific argument 
for, is the default letter sent by Wells Fargo. To the extent the Swinks 
challenge the admission of all of the Wells Fargo records, their sole 
argument presented is that "the documents from the prior loan servicer, Wells 
Fargo Home Mortgage, should not have been admitted, and this includes, but is 
not limited to, the default letters purportedly send [sic] by Wells Fargo." 
(Emphasis added.) The blanket "is not limited to" challenge to all of the 
Wells Fargo records is insufficient. See Hawaiʻi Rules of Ap
pellate Procedure 
Rule 28(b)(7).
