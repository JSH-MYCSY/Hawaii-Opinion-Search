      Revocable Living Trust Dated April 4, 2003 (collectively, the 
Hos) by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).1 
Furusho raises three points of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court erred in: (1) finding that 
Furusho did not have a meritorious defense; (2) finding no good 
cause to set aside the default; and (3) denying Furusho's motion 
for reconsideration. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
resolve Furusho's points of error as follows: 
The crux of this appeal is whether the default judgment 
and default entered against Furusho should be set aside, so that 
he can defend this legal malpractice suit on the merits. 
A party moving to set aside a default judgment must 
show three things: (1) the nondefaulting party will not be 
prejudiced by the reopening; (2) the defaulting party has a 
meritorious defense; and (3) the default was not the result of 
inexcusable neglect, or a wilful act. Chen v. Mah, 146 Hawai i  
157, 160,
 457 P.3d 796, 799 (2020). Each of these factors is 
grounded in equity principles, and a merits-oriented outcome is 
favored over preserving the finality of a judgment. See JK v. 
DK, 153 Hawai i 268, 274-75,  533 P.3d 1215, 1221-22 (2023). 
Regarding the issue of prejudice to the Hos, the 
Circuit Court pointed to the underlying case, New Bangkok v. Ho, 
Civ. No. 1CC181001575, wherein a default judgment was entered 
1 The Honorable Lisa W. Cataldo presided.

          against the Hos (the New Bangkok Case). It is unclear how 
allowing Furusho to defend the Hos' claims that he should be held 
entirely responsible for the default judgment would prejudice the 
Hos, and they point to no specific prejudice associated with 
proceeding on the merits. In addition, we take judicial notice 
of this court's Summary Disposition Order in New Bangkok v. Ho, 
CAAP-19-0000506 and CAAP-19-000822, wherein this court vacated 
the default judgment against the Hos. Upon remand, no further 
judgment has been entered against the Hos to date in the New 
Bangkok Case. On July 24, 2024, the Hos filed an answer and 
counterclaim in the New Bangkok Case. On July 25, 2024, the 
parties filed a joint stipulation to pursue settlement and no 
further substantive action appears in the record of the New 
Bangkok Case. 
Regarding the issue of a meritorious defense, Furusho's 
primary contention is that he was never engaged as counsel in the 
New Bangkok Case. Even assuming that the Hos ultimately might 
prevail on this argument notwithstanding the lack of any 
engagement agreement between Furusho and the Hos, in light of the 
fact that the default judgment against the Hos has been vacated 
and that the Hos have filed an answer and counterclaim, at the 
very least, it appears that Furusho has a meritorious defense to 
the extensive money damages awarded to the Hos in the default 
judgment entered in this case, which was based solely on the now-
defunct default judgment in the New Bangkok Case. 
Regarding the issue of inexcusable neglect, Furusho's 
main contentions pertain to notice and service on him in this 
case, starting with the complaint and summons. The Hos' lawyer

             averred that she mailed the complaint and summons to Furusho by 
certified mail and he signed for the envelope on some unspecified 
date. This was not proper service under Rule 4 of the Hawai i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP).
 While Furusho later 
acknowledged signing for certified mail of some sort, he does not 
recall it being a complaint and summons, he did not waive this 
defective service or enter a general appearance until, perhaps, 
the filing of the Motion to Set Aside.2 See generally HRCP Rule 
12(h)(1). Furusho further points to the fact that subsequent 
discovery and motions, including the Hos' motion for entry of 
default were "served" on him at a downtown Honolulu address that 
Furusho averred that he vacated in May of 2016, and not at the 
new address that he provided to the Hawai i Supreme Court and 
Hawaii State
 Bar Association (and appearing in the bar 
directory).3 After Furusho received electronic notification of 
the motion for entry of default judgment on May 18, 2021, he took 
steps to engage counsel who agreed to represent him, but that 
attorney was apparently gravely ill at the time, unbeknownst to 
Furusho, and died on July 5, 2021. Furusho offers further 
explanation of numerous events and circumstances occurring 
thereafter, which are thin grounds for not acting sooner to seek 
to set aside the default judgment. However, particularly in 
light of the lack of proper service of process, the record does 
2 We express no opinion as to whether the filing of the Motion to 
Set Aside waived the defense of insufficiency of service of process. 
3 Furusho denies registering as a JEFS User, denies authorizing 
someone to register him on his behalf, and denies even knowing that he was so 
registered until he received a JEFS email notification of the motion for entry 
of default judgment against him on May 18, 2021. We note, however, that as a 
licensed Hawai i attorney, unless exempted, Furusho was required to register 
as a JEFS User. See Hawai i
 Electronic Filing & Service Rules Rule 4.1(a).

  not support a conclusion that Furusho's default itself was a 
result of inexcusable neglect. 
Based on the above, and in light of the overarching 
equitable principles applicable here, and the merits-oriented 
outcome favored in Hawai i courts, we  conclude that  Furusho 
should be granted relief from the default and default judgment 
entered against him. 
Accordingly,  the  Circuit   Court's  October  31,  2022  Order 
Denying  Set  Aside  and  January  4,  2023  Order  Denying 
Reconsideration  are  vacated.   This  case  is  remanded  to  the 
Circuit  Court  for  further  proceedings  consistent  with  this 
Summary  Disposition  Order.
