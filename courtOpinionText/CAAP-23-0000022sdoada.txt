APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY  COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT  
(CASE NO. 1FFC-20-0001120)  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER   
(By  Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth  and Guidry, JJ.)  
Defendant -Appellant Myron Posoa Filipe ( Filipe) 
appeals from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence (Judgment ) 
entered by the Family Court of the First Circuit ( family court ) 
on November 15, 2022.1 On December 4, 2020, Filipe was indicted 
on one count of Sexual Assault in the First Degree2 in violation 
1 The Honorable Kevin T. Morikone presided. 
2 The indictment stated, in relevant part, 
On or about June 1, 2016, to and including June 30, 2016, 
in the City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaiʻi, MYRON 
POSOA FILIPE, being the parent or guardian or any other

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 707-730(1)(b) (2014).3 Filipe 
pleaded not guilty, and the matter proceeded to a jury -waived 
trial. On June 30, 2022, the family court found Filipe guilty 
as charged. Filipe was sentenced to a term of twenty years 
imprisonment. 
Filipe raises five points of error on appeal, 
contending that the family court erred: (1) "where it denied 
[Filipe's] motion to allow evidence of sexual activity of the 
[CW] and where it denied [Filipe's] motion to suppress 
evidence"; (2) "when it relied on the DVD police interview 
footage to determine whether [Filipe] invoked his right to 
counsel rather than relying on the official transcripts of said 
interview"; (3) "where it stated it would discern admissibility 
and inadmissibility within the transcripts /dvd of the interview 
of [Filipe] at police headquarters rather than specifically 
detailing which statements it was relying on and which were not 
relied upon due to inadmissibility"; (4) "where it overruled 
(...continued) 
person having legal or physical custody of [complaining 
witness ( CW)], did knowingly engage in sexual penetration 
with [CW], who was less than fourteen years old, by 
inserting his finger into her genital opening, thereby 
committing the offense of Sexual Assault in the First 
Degree, in violation of Section 707 -730(1)(b) of the Hawaiʻi 
Revised Statutes.  
3 HRS § 707 -730(1)(b) provides, in pertinent part, "A person 
commits the offense of sexual assault in the first degree if : 
 . . . . 
(b) The person k nowingly engages in sexual penetration with 
another person who is less than fourteen years old[.]"

[Filipe's] objection to [the State] attempting to rehab bad 
answers by the [CW] even though the [CW] had already answered 
the very same questions asked of her (asked and answered)"; and 
(5) "by denying [Filipe's] various motions for judgment of 
acquittal, and by sustaining [Filipe's] conviction despite 
insufficient evidence supporting the requisite state of mind."  
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issue s raised by the parties, we 
conclude that Filipe's conviction is not supported by sufficient 
evidence.4 We therefore reverse the family court's Judgment as 
follows. 
We review Filipe's contention of insufficient evidence 
under the following standard of review:  
[E]vidence  adduced in the trial court must be considered in the 
strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate court 
passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to support a conviction; the same standard applies whether the case was before 
a judge or jury. The test on appeal is not whether guilt is 
established beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was 
substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of 
fact.  
State v. Kalaola , 124 Hawaiʻi 43, 49, 237 P.3d 1109, 1115 (2010) 
(citations omitted). 
"Substantial evidence" is "credible evidence which is 
of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of 
reasonable caution to support a conclusion." Id. (citation 
4 In light of this con clusion, we do not reach Filipe's remaining 
points of error.

omitted). In a bench trial, the trial judge, as the trier of 
fact, "is free to make all reasonable and rational inferences 
under the facts in evidence, including circumstantial evidence." 
State v. Batson , 73 Haw. 236, 249, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992) 
(citation omitted). 
In order to sustain a conviction of Sexual Assault in 
the First Degree, the State is required to prove that the 
defendant had the requisite state of mind; the defendant must 
have "knowingly engage[d] in sexual penetration with a nother 
person who is less than fourteen years old [.]" HRS § 707-
730(1)(b) (emphasis added). HRS § 702 -206(2) (2014) defines the 
"knowingly" state of mind as, 
(a) A person acts knowingly with respect to his conduct 
when he is aware that his conduct is of that nature. 
(b) A person acts knowingly with respect to attendant 
circumstances when he is aware that such 
circumstances exist. 
(c) A person acts knowingly with respect to a result of 
his conduct when he is aware that it is practically 
certain that his conduct will cause such a result. 
Id. 
On this record, we conclude that there is insufficient 
evidence to support that Filipe "knowingly" engaged in sexual 
penetration with "a nother person who is less than fourteen years 
old[.]" 
At trial, Filipe asserted a mistake -of-fact defense. 
He argued that he was acting under the mistaken belief that he 
was touching his girlfriend, CW's mother (mother), in the bed,

and not CW who was less than fourteen years old.   The two police 
detectives who interviewed Filipe during their investigation 
testified at trial that Filipe did not admit to knowingly 
engaging in sexual penetration with CW. Rather, Filipe  
represented that he thought he was engaging in this act with CW's mother.

CW's testimony supports that Filipe penetrated CW 's 
vagina with his fingers, but does not establish that Filipe did 
so knowing that he was engaging in sexual penetration with CW – 
i.e., a person who is less than fourteen years old. CW 
testified at trial that she was sleeping on the same bed as 
Filipe and mother when the incident occurred. CW testified that 
she was lying between her mother and Filipe, but that she had 
not slept in the middle before. CW's testimony does not 
establish whether Filipe knew that he was sleeping next to CW, 
and not mother, at the time of the incident. CW testified that 
she saw Filipe's face when the sexual penetration occurred, but 
that alone does not establish that Filipe knew he was engaging 
in sexual penetration with CW and not mother. CW further 
5 The record reflects that CW was twelve years old at the time the 
incident occurred. 
6 When questioned during cross -examination, Detective Linda 
Robertson (Detective Robertson ) agreed that Filipe told her, during her 
investigation, that he did not know he was sexually touching CW until after 
he touched her and "she moved, [and] I looked over[.]" Detective Robertson 
further agreed that Filipe told her, "I didn't do it intentiona lly like I 
wanted to rape her or anything. I just reached over and touched her, because 
I thought she was my girlfriend. And I stopped. But I knew it was her, so I 
stopped."

testified that she and Filipe did not talk with each other about 
the incident after it occurred.7 
We conclude, on this record, that the evidence adduced 
by the State at trial does not support that Filipe had the 
requisite state of mind to be convicted of Sexual Assault in the 
First Degree. We therefore reverse the Judgment of Conviction 
and Sentence entered on November 15, 2022, by the Family Court 
of the First Circuit. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai‘i, February 1 4, 2024. 
7 Mother testified as a defense witness. Her testimony likewise 
does not establish that Filipe knew he was touching CW and not mother. 
Mother's testimony confirmed that CW was positioned next to Filipe on the 
night the incident occurred, but that mother us ually slept between CW and 
Filipe. Mother testified that she and Filipe would engage in sexual touching 
of each other in bed.
