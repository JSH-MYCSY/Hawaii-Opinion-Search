APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CCV-21-0000419) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By: Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of "[Defendant-Appellee] Nexstar 
Media Inc., Misidentified as KHON 2's [(
Nexstar)] Motion to 
Dismiss Appeal for Lack of Appellate Jurisdiction," filed 
January 31, 2023 (Motion), the papers in support and in 
opposition, and the record, it appears that Nexstar asks the 
court to dismiss self-represented Plaintiff-Appellant Lonnell R. Widemann's (Widemann) appeal from the "Order Denying Plaintiff's 
Motion to Amend Complaint [Dkt. 123] Filed July 18, 2022" (Denial 
Order), "Order Granting [Nexstar]'s Motion to Dismiss Complaint, 
as Amended, or in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment on Any 
and All Claims Asserted against KHON 2 [Dkt. 115] Filed July 8, 2022" (Dismissal Order), and Minute Order denying Widemann's 
request for reconsideration of the Denial Order and Dismissal 
Order (Minute Order), each entered January 10, 2023 in the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court), as the orders 
appealed from are not final, appealable orders.
 We conclude that the court lacks appellate 
jurisdiction because the Denial Order, Dismissal Order, and 
Minute Order are not final, appealable orders, and the Circuit Court has not otherwise entered a final, appealable order or judgment in the underlying case. See Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016); Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure Rules 
54(b), 58; Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 
115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai# i 319, 321, 966 P.2d 631, 633 (1998). 
Further, the orders appealed from are not independently appealable under the collateral-order doctrine, the Forgay
1 
doctrine, or HRS ยง 641-1(b). See Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai# i 
249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (setting forth the requirements for appealability under the collateral-order doctrine and the Forgay doctrine); HRS ยง 641-1(b) (specifying requirements for leave to file interlocutory appeal). 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
granted and this appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
