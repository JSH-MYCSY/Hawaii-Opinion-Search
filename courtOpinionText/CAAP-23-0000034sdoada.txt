SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.)  
Self-represented Defendant -Appellant Wendell Keani 
Kaleimamahu, Jr. ( Kaleimamahu ) appeals from the Circuit Court of 
the Third Circuit's December 29 , 2022 "Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff 's Motion for 
Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against All 
Defendants on Complaint Filed September 22, 2014" (Foreclosure 
Decree), and December 29 , 2022 Judgment based on the Foreclosure

Decree entered pursuant to Hawai‘i Rules of Civil Procedure 
Rules 54(b) and 58 ( Foreclosure Judgment ). 1 
The Foreclosure Decree's unchallenged findings of fact 
(FOF) establish the following information . 2 Kaleimamahu executed 
a promissory note dated August 26, 2006 for the sum of $140,000 
(Note), which was indorsed in blank "thereby converting it to 
bearer paper as defined in [Hawai‘i Revised Statutes ( HRS)] 
§ 490:3-109." The Note was secured by a n August 26, 2006 
mortgage (Mortgage ) executed by Kaleimamahu , and later assigned 
to Plaintiff -Appellee Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as 
Trustee for Securitized Asset Backed Receivables LLC Trust 2007 -
NC2, Mortgage -Pass Through Certificates, Series 2007 -NC2 
(Deutsche Bank ). Kaleimamahu defaulted on the Note and 
Mortgage , and was given written notice of default. 
In his points of error, Kaleimamahu contends Deutsche 
Bank lacked standing to seek foreclos ure, and Deutsche Bank 's 
filings created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether 
it possessed the Note when the September 22, 2014 c omplaint was 
filed. 
Upon careful review of the record and the brief s 
submitted by the parties , and having given due consideration to 
1 The Honorable Peter K. Kubota presided . 
2   An unchallenged finding of fact is binding on the parties and the 
appellate court. Okada Trucking Co. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 Hawai‘i 450, 
458, 40 P.3d 73, 8 1  (2002).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
points of error as discussed below, and affirm. 
We review the grant of summary judgment de novo. U.S. 
Bank N.A. v. Mattos, 140 Hawai‘i  26, 30, 398 P.3d 615, 619 
(2017). "A party seeking to foreclose on a mortgage and note 
must prove (1) the existence of the agreements, (2) the terms of 
the agreements, (3) a default under the terms of the agreements, 
and (4) delivery of the notice of default." Wells Fargo Bank, 
N.A. v. Fong, 149 Hawai‘i  249, 253, 488 P.3d 1228, 1232 (2021).  
To establish standing to foreclose, the plaintiff must 
necessarily "prove its entitlement to enforce the note " when the 
action was commenced. Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 
Hawai‘i 361, 368-69, 390 P.3d 1248, 125 5-56 (2017); Wells Fargo 
Bank, N.A. v. Behrendt , 142 Hawai‘i 37, 41, 42, 414 P.3d 89, 93 , 
94 (2018) (noting party seeking to judicially foreclose "must 
establish that it was the 'person entitled to enforce the note ' 
as defined by HRS § 490:3 -301 at the time the foreclosure 
complaint was filed to satisfy standing and to be entitled to 
prevail on the merits "). 
HRS § 490:3-301 (2008) provides a person may enforce 
an instrument if the person is the "holder of the instrument," 
or is not in possession of the instrument but entitled to 
enforce a lost instrument : 
3  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"Person entitled to enforce "  an instrument means 
(i)  the holder of the instrument, (ii) a nonholder in 
possession of the instrument who has the rights of a 
holder, or (iii) a person not in possession  of the 
instrument who is entitled to enforce the instrument pursuant to section 490:3 -309  or 490:3- 418(d).  A person 
may be a person entitled to enforce the instrument even though the person is not the owner of the instrument or is in wrongful possession of the instrument.  
(Emphases added.) 
HRS § 490:3-309 (2008) governs the enforcement of a 
lost instrument and provides : 
Enforcement of lost, destroyed, or stolen instrument.   
(a) A person not in possession  of an instrument is entitled 
to enforce the instrument if (i) the person was in rightful 
possession of the instrument and entitled to enforce it 
when loss of possession occurred, (ii) the loss of 
possession was not the result of a transfer by the person or a lawful seizure, and (iii) the person cannot reasonably 
obtain possession of the instrument because the instrument 
was destroyed, its whereabouts cannot be determined, or it 
is in the wrongful possession of an unknown person or a 
person that cannot be found or is not amenable to service 
of process.  
(b) A person seeking enforcement of an instrument 
under subsection (a) must prove the terms of the instrument 
and the person's right to enforce the instrument. If that 
proof is made, section 490:3 -308 applies to the case as if 
the person seeking enforcement had produced the instrument. 
The court may not enter judgment in favor of the person 
seeking enforcement unless it finds that the person 
required to pay the instrument is adequately protected 
against loss that might occur by reason of a claim by 
another person to enforce the instrument. Adequate 
protection may be provided by any reasonable means. 
(Emphases added and formatting altered .) 
A blank indorsement "is not payable to an identified 
person[,]" and "[w]hen indorsed in blank,  an instrument becomes 
payable to bearer and may be negotiated by transfer or 
possession alone until specially indorsed."   Reyes-Toledo, 139 
Hawai‘i  at  370, 390 P.3d at  1257  (citing HRS § 490:3-205(b)).

When a lender forecloses on a promissory note secured 
by a mortgage, the lender may establish standing via proof it 
physically possessed the blank -indorsed note when it filed the 
complaint. See id. 
The foreclosing party may establish it is the holder 
of a note by showing that its agent physically possessed the 
note.  See generally  U.S. Bank Tr., N.A. as Tr. for LSF9 Master 
Participation Tr. v. Verhagen, 149 Hawai‘i  315, 317, 327-28, 489 
P.3d 419, 421, 431-32 (2021).  
On appeal, though Kaleimamahu contests Deutsche Bank 's 
possession of the Note and its standing to foreclose, 
Kaleimamahu failed to dispute the existence and terms of the 
Mortgage and Note, his default, or the delivery of the notice of 
default before the circuit court or on appeal. 
To establish that it possessed the Note when the 
complaint was filed , Deutsche Bank attached the following to its 
September 29 , 2022 "Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of 
Foreclosure Against All Defendants on Complaint Filed 
September 22, 2014": 
(1) A declaration of counsel, maintaining counsel 
"received the original indorsed Note . . . for the prosecution 
of this case on September 3, 2014 [,]" and counsel mailed the 
Note back to Deutsche Bank's loan servicer on February 22, 2016;

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) The Affidavit  of Lost Note  (Affidavit of Lost 
Note) signed by M. Johnson an "Authorized Signer" for Ocwen Loan 
Servicing, LLC ( Ocwen), Deutsche Bank's loan servicer, noting  
based on a review of Ocwen's records, (a) Deutsche Bank  kept  the 
Note "in the ordinary course  of business under the custody and 
control of Ocwen" and Ocwen  mailed the Note to Deutsche Bank's 
counsel on August 28, 2014, (b) counsel mailed the original Note back to Ocwen on February 22, 2016, (c) the Note appears to be  
lost and cannot be found, (d) the Note was not  "sold or assigned 
to any other party, and all rights and benefits of said note are 
currently held"  by Deutsche Bank, and (e) Deutsche Bank agreed  
to indemnify Kaleimamahu  against any claims asserted by parties 
other than Deutsche Bank or its assignees for amounts 
purportedly  due on the Note;  and   
(3) The declaration of Juliana Thurab , custodian o f 
records for PHH Mortgage Corporation (PHH), successor to 
Deutsche Bank's loan servicer Ocwen , maintaining based on 
Ocwen's records incorporated into PHH's business records, 
Deutsche Bank " was in possession of the Note " when "the 
Complaint was filed on September 22, 2014 " and based on the 
Affidavit of Lost Note , the original Note was "lost in transit" 
between counsel and Ocwen and "cannot be located ." 
Based on this record, we determine the circuit court 
did not clearly err and there was substantial evidence in the 
6  
 
 
 
  
   
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
record to support the finding that Deutsche Bank, through its 
counsel, " was in possession of the endorsed in blank Note at the 
time of the filing of the Complaint filed September 22, 20 14, 
thereby establishing its standing to foreclose ." See generally 
Santiago v. Tanaka , 137 Hawai‘i 137, 148 -49, 366 P.3d 612, 623 -24 
(2016) (providing " trial court's findings of fact are reviewed 
under the 'clearly erroneous ' standard " and "conclusions of law 
are reviewed de novo "). 
We further determine that  the circuit court did not 
err in finding that "even though the original of the Note cannot 
now be located, Plaintiff is the holder of all rights to the 
Note and is therefore entitled to enforce it pursuant to HRS 
§490:3-301 and 490:3-309."   See generally  Santiago, 137 Hawai‘ i 
at 148-49, 366 P.3d at 623-24. Deutsche Bank was entitled to 
enforce the blank-indorsed Note under HRS § 490:3-309 even 
though  the original  Note  was lost in February 2016 after the 
complaint was filed, because the record  demonstrated  Deutsche 
Bank  was "in rightful possession" of the Note and entitled to 
enforce the Note  when loss of possession occurred, the loss "was 
not the result of a transfer by the person or a lawful seizure," and Deutsche Bank "cannot reasonably obtain possession" of the 
Note because "its whereabouts cannot be determined[.]"   See  HRS 
§§  490:3-301(iii), 490:3-309(a).

Furthermore, the indemnity clause  in the Foreclosure 
Decree protects Kaleimamahu against any concerns of any  party or 
entity  seeking to enforce the Note, other than Deutsche Bank  or 
its assignees.  
For these reasons, we  affirm the circuit court's 
December 29, 2022 Foreclosure Decree and Foreclosure Judgment.
