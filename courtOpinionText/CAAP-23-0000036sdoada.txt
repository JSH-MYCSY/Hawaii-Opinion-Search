MATTHEW NOE, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1FFC-22-0000785) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting C.J., and Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Matthew Noe (N
oe) appeals from the 
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence; Notice of Entry entered on 
December 29, 2022, in the Family Court of the First Circuit 
(Family Court).
   Following a bench trial, Noe was convicted of 
Abuse of Family or Household Members, in violation of Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 709-906(6).  On appeal, he contends 
there was no substantial evidence to support the conviction.

After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues 
raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve 
1/ The Honorable Gale L.F. Ching presided. 
2/ HRS ยง 709-906(6) (Supp. 2021) provides, in relevant part: 
It shall be a petty misdemeanor for a person to
intentionally or knowingly strike, shove, kick, or otherwise
touch a family or household member in an offensive manner;
subject the family member or household member to offensive
physical contact; or exercise coercive control, as defined
in section 586-1, over a family or household member and the
person shall be sentenced as provided in sections 706-640
and 706-663. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Noe's contentions as follows, and affirm. 
Noe contends there was no substantial evidence that: 
(1) he acted intentionally or knowingly in allegedly kicking the 
complaining witness (CW
) and (2) a bruise on the CW's forearm, as 
shown on State's Exhibit 1, was "consistent with a kick." 
We review the sufficiency of evidence on appeal as 
follows: 
Evidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in 
the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate
court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to
support a conviction; the same standard applies whether the
case was before a judge or jury. The test on appeal is not
whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but
whether there was substantial evidence to support the
conclusion of the trier of fact. 
State v. Yuen, 154 Hawai#i 434, 444, 555 P.3d 121, 131 (2024) 
(brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Richie, 88 Hawai#i 19, 33, 
960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998)). 
In order to convict Noe of abuse of a family or 
household member, the State was required to prove that he 
intentionally or knowingly struck, shoved, kicked, or otherwise 
touched the CW in an offensive manner or subjected the CW to 
offensive physical contact. HRS ยง 709-906(6). 
At trial, the CW testified that Noe kicked her with his 
foot and that his foot came into contact with the CW's forearm. 
Noe testified, among other things, that his foot "may have" made 
contact with the CW. The Family Court found the CW's testimony 
"more credible." Noe argues there is no substantial evidence 
that the bruise on the CW's forearm shown in State's Exhibit 1 is 
"consistent with a kick," but that ignores the CW's testimony 
that Noe's foot came into contact with her forearm. "An 
appellate court will not pass upon the trial judge's decisions 
with respect to the credibility of witnesses and the weight of 
the evidence, because this is the province of the trial judge." 
State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai#i 131, 139, 913 P.2d 57, 65 (1996) 
(citing Domingo v. State, 76 Hawai#i 237, 242, 873 P.2d 775, 780 
(1994), and others). 
Noe also argues there is no substantial evidence that 
he kicked the CW intentionally or knowingly. He points to the 
CW's statement at trial, "I don't think he meant to kick me

anywhere." This statement, however, was only part of the CW's 
response to the question, "Where did he kick you?" The CW 
responded in full, "I don't think he meant to kick me anywhere. 
He just kicked me, and I did like this, and he hit the -- hit 
right in my arm." 
Based on all of the evidence presented at trial, 
considered in the strongest light for the prosecution, we 
conclude there was substantial evidence from which the Family 
Court could reasonably have inferred that Noe acted intentionally 
or knowingly with respect to his conduct. See State v. Calaycay, 
145 Hawai#i 186, 200, 449 P.3d 1184, 1198 (2019) ("[T]he mind of 
an alleged offender may be read from his acts, conduct, and 
inferences fairly drawn from all of the circumstances." (quoting 
State v. Kiese, 126 Hawai#i 494, 502-03, 273 P.3d 1180, 1188-89 
(2012))). In sum, there was substantial evidence that Noe 
intentionally or knowingly struck, kicked, or otherwise touched 
the CW in an offensive manner or subjected the CW to offensive 
physical contact. 
On this record, the evidence was sufficient to 
support Noe's conviction. 
For the reasons discussed above, the Judgment of 
Conviction and Sentence; Notice of Entry entered on December 29, 
2022, in the Family Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
