APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.)
 
In this consolidated appeal, Father-Appellant (Father) 
appeals from the Family Court of the First Circuit's January 25, 
2023 orders terminating parental rights.1 On appeal, Father 
1 The Honorable Jessi L.K. Hall entered the Orders and the Findings of 
Fact and Conclusions of Law.   
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
asserts insufficiency of the evidence and a due process 
violation.2 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we 
resolve Father's arguments below, and affirm. 
(1) In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, 
Father argues that the family court must "find that reasonable 
efforts where [sic] provided" in order to terminate his parental 
rights. To that point, Father maintains the Department of Human 
Services (DHS) did not inquire if the prison offered services, 
failed to arrange visits with the children, and did not do 
enough regarding his domestic violence, substance abuse, and mental health issues. 
"DHS is under an obligation to provide a reasonable 
opportunity to parents through a service plan to reunify the 
family." In re Doe
, 100 Hawai‘i 335, 343, 60 P.3d 285, 293 
(2002). But "DHS is not required to provide services beyond 
what [is] available within the correction system." In re B.K.
, 
149 Hawai‘i 172, 484 P.3d 185, No. CAAP-20-0000619, 2021 WL 
1250384 at *3 (App. Apr. 5, 2021) (SDO). Moreover, unchallenged 
2 In his points of error, Father identifies Findings of Fact numbers 
63, 102, 125, 126, 130, 131, 132, 140, 141, and 142, and Conclusions of Law 
numbers 17, 18, and 19, as "erroneously found." Rather than addressing these findings and conclusions individually in the argument section of his brief, 
Father appears to challenge them in the context of the points raised on 
appeal. We address the challenged findings and conclusion in a likewise 
manner.

findings are binding on this court and this "court will not pass 
upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the 
weight of the evidence[.]" In re Doe
, 95 Hawai‘i 183, 190, 20 
P.3d 616, 623 (2001) (citation and internal quotation marks 
omitted). 
Here, Father's social worker testified he offered to 
refer Father to anger management and domestic violence classes, 
and referred Father to domestic violence classes and parenting education classes, which Father did not complete. 
Father's 
social worker testified that he discussed with Father about starting supervised visits with his children, K.R. and C.R., and 
offered supervised visits with K.R. The resource caregivers 
similarly testified Father was offered visits with his children. 
And per Father's own testimony, he quit the last three substance 
abuse programs he was enrolled in. 
Because the family court found the social worker's and 
resource caregivers' testimonies credible and the above findings were not challenged, there was sufficient evidence to show 
Father was provided reasonable opportunities to receive services 
and visit his children. 
(2) Father contends the family court "made an error 
in discharging [his] court-appointed counsel for 8-9 months, 
violating his due process rights under the Constitution, and 
failing to provide a fundamentally fair process." Father argues his absence was not voluntary because he was incarcerated.

"The right to counsel is not automatically violated 
when a beneficiary of that right voluntarily absents themselves 
from the family court proceedings." In re J.H.
, 152 Hawai‘i 373, 
379, 526 P.3d 350, 356 (2023). Moreover, "[t]here is no 
violation of a parent's due process right to counsel when a 
family court discharges and later reappoints counsel, and the 
case, viewed in its entire context, establishes that the parent 
received a fundamentally fair trial . . . ." Id.
 152 Hawaiʻi at 
381, 526 P.3d at 358. 
Due to missing multiple hearings, Father's court-
appointed attorney was discharged in K.R.'s case on November 30, 
2020 and in C.R.'s case on December 29, 2020. 
In his opening 
brief, Father notes he "testified he had been incarcerated since 2019-2020" citing to "T of 01/23/23 p.108." There, Father's 
testimony was, "[s]o I've . . . been incarcerated since 2020. 
'19, 2019, not too sure. 2020 I think I've been locked up . . . 
I've been in and out, but then mostly been locked up, incarcerated." This testimony, however, does not establish that 
Father's failure to appear was not voluntary. 
Moreover, after the sixth day of trial in K.R.'s case, 
Father appeared with newly-appointed counsel on July 1, 2021 for 
a periodic review in C.R.'s case. The family court then set 
aside the trial in K.R.'s case and reset trial to be held 
jointly with C.R.'s case. Since then, Father and his newly-
4   
 
 
 
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appointed counsel participated in the hearings, mediation, and 
consolidated trial that followed. Thus, viewing these cases in 
their entire context, Father had a "meaningful opportunity to 
participate in [his] case with the aid of counsel." In re J.H., 
152 Hawai‘ i at 381, 526 P.3d at 358. 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the family court's 
January 25, 2023 orders terminating parental rights.
