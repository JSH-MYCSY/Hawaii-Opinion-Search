NO. CAAP-23-0000059 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
NOE RAQUINIO, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CPC-22-0000941) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By:  Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Chan, JJ.)  
Upon consideration of Plaintiff-Appellee State of 
Hawai# i's (State) February 8, 2023 Opposition to Notice of 
Appeal, which the court construes as a motion to dismiss the 
appeal (Motion), the papers in support, the record, and 
self-represented Defendant-Appellant Noe Raquinio's (Raquinio) 
February 10, 2023 Jurisdictional Statement, which the court 
construes as both a Statement of Jurisdiction and as a memorandum in opposition to the Motion, it appears that the State seeks dismissal of Raquinio's appeal from the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit's January 31, 2023 minute order (Minute Order) 
denying Raquinio's December 12, 2022 motion to suppress evidence 
and statements, as Raquinio does not appeal from a final, appealable order or judgment.  
We conclude that the court lacks appellate 
jurisdiction, as "a minute order is not an appealable order," 
Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright
, 88 Hawai# i 319, 321 
n.3, 966 P.2d 631, 633 n.3 (1998), and even if the Minute Order were reduced to a written order, it would not qualify as a final, appealable order.  Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 641-11 (2016); NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
granted, and the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 24, 2023.
