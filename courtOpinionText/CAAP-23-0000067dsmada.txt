APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC181000540) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that self-
represented Defendants/Third-Party Plaintiffs/Counterclaimants-
Appellants Melvin Keakaku Amina, AKA Melvin K. Amina, and Donna Mae Amina, AKA Donna M. Amina (
Amina Parties) appeal from the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit's May 20, 2022 "Order Denying [Amina Parties']: (1) Second Motion for More Time to Respond to Aldridge Pite's Motion for Summary Judgment, Filed April 22, 2022, and (2) Motion to Continue Hearing on Aldridge Pite's Motion for Summary Judgment" (5/20/22 Order), its July 11, 2022 
"Amended Final Judgment Regarding Order Granting: (1) Third-Party 
Defendant Aldridge Pite, LLP's Motion for Summary Judgment on [Amina Parties'] Third-Party Complaint Filed May 21, 2019, Filed Herein on January 25, 2022 ('AP's MSJ'); and (2) Third-Party NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Defendant Nationwide Title Clearing, LLC, F/K/A Nationwide Title 
Clearing, Inc.'s Substantive Joinder to AP's MSJ, Filed February 17, 2022" (7/11/22 Amended Judgment), and its purported 
"oral [o]rder dated December 13, 2022, to appear by Zoom at the 
summary judgment hearing at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday" (Purported 
Oral Order). 
Assuming, 
arguendo, that an appeal from the 7/11/22 
Amended Judgment would bring up for review the 5/20/22 Order, the 
Amina Parties nonetheless failed to file the December 9, 2022 Notice of Appeal within thirty days after entry of the 7/11/22 Amended Judgment, as required by 
Hawai# i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1). See
 HRAP Rule 26(e) ("The 
reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give timely notice of appeal."); Narmore v. Kawafuchi
, 112 Hawai# i 69, 81, 143 P.3d 1271, 1283 (2006) ("The 
requirement that a party timely file a notice of appeal has been held to be jurisdictional by this court."). 
The Purported Oral Order referenced in the Amina 
Parties' December 13, 2022 Notice of Appeal does not appear in the underlying record. 
In any event, "a minute order is not an 
appealable order." Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright
, 
88 Hawai# i 319, 321 n.3, 966 P.2d 631, 633 n.3 (1998). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED: 
Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 23, 2023.
