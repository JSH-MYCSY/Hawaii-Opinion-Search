APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CCV-22-0000525) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Hui Ho#opulapula N ā Wai O Puna appeals, and the Board 
of Land and Natural Resources ( BLNR) and Department of Land and 
Natural Resources ( DLNR) (together, State) cross-appeal, from the 
Amended Final Judgment  entered by the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit.1 The circuit court ruled it did not have subject matter 
jurisdiction over the case. The parties challenge different 
aspects of the January 9, 2023 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of 
Law, and Order Granting Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and Denying Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment . We hold the 
circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction, vacate the Amended Final Judgment, and remand for further proceedings. 
1 The Honorable John M. Tonaki presided.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Background 
The Hui sued the State on May 4, 2022. It sought 
declarations that (1) BLNR violated Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) 
§ 171-55 and its Haw. Const. art. XI, §§ 1, 7 public trust duties 
by continuing a one-year revocable permit ( RP 7340) issued to 
Kaua#i Island Utility Cooperative ( KIUC ) for calendar year 2022, 
and (2) the continued RP 7340 was "legally invalid and void."2 
It also sought "any necessary and appropriate injunctive relief." 
The Hui and the State filed cross-motions for summary 
judgment. The Hui's motion argued that BLNR's continuation of RP 7340 was invalid because BLNR failed to make findings of fact and conclusions of law; failed to require KIUC to show an actual need for stream water; continued the permit for the sake of KIUC's interest in obtaining a long-term water lease; and abdicated its legal duties by not making an independent inquiry or analysis of protection and mitigation measures. 
The State's motion argued that the Hui failed to 
exhaust its administrative remedies by formally requesting a contested case hearing on KIUC's application to continue RP 7340; the Hui's claims were barred under the primary jurisdiction doctrine; and the Hui was afforded due process. 
The cross-motions were heard on November 30, 2022. The 
circuit court took them under advisement. The court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order denying the Hui's motion for summary judgment and granting the State's motion for summary judgment on January 9, 2023. The court found: 
10. On December 10, 2021, [BLNR] considered whether
to continue RP 7340 at its publicly noticed meeting. 
11. During the meeting, [BLNR] took testimony from
KIUC, members of the Hui, and other members of the public
concerning continuation of RP 7340. 
2 The HUI did not name KIUC, the permittee, as a defendant. The 
State asserted failure to name indispensable parties as an affirmativedefense, but the State didn't move for relief under 
Hawai#i Rules of Civil 
Procedure Rule 19 (Joinder of Persons Needed for Just Adjudication). 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
12. [BLNR] voted to renew RP 7340 without first
entering any findings of fact and conclusions of law
supporting permit renewal, and without issuing any findingsthat continuing the permit was in the best interests of theState for the 2022 calendar year, and whether continuing thepermit complies with the public trust doctrine[.] 
13. [BLNR] also denied the Hui's oral request for a
contested case hearing. 
14. [The Hui] did not avail itself of the statutory
process for judicial review of a decision in a contestedcase provided for under Hawaii Administrative Rules§ 13-1-29 and [HRS §] 91-14. 
15. Instead, [the Hui] filed an original complaint
for declaratory and injunctive relief in the EnvironmentalCourt of the First Circuit, in which [it] seeks invalidationof permit RP 7340 issued by the Board on December 10, 2021for the year 2022. 
The court concluded: 
3. In order to seek judicial review of [BLNR]'s
continuation of RP 7340, it was a requirement that [the Hui]institute proceedings for review in the circuit court or, ifapplicable, the environmental court, within thirty daysafter the preliminary ruling or within thirty days afterservice of the certified copy of the final decision andorder of the agency. H.R.S. § 91-14(b). 
4. Where a statutory avenue for appeal of an agency
decision is available, an original action for declaratoryjudgment does not lie. Ko#olau Agr. Co. v. Commission on
Water Res. Mgmt. , 83 Haw. 484[], 492-93 (1996). 
5. [The Hui]'s failure to proceed under the
statutory process for review of an agency decision underH.R.S. Chapter 91 divests the court of authority to issue anorder for declaratory and injunctive relief. 
A judgment for BLNR and against the Hui was entered on 
January 25, 2023. This appeal and cross-appeal followed. The 
Amended Final Judgment for the State and against the Hui was entered on November 29, 2023, on a temporary remand. 
Standards of Review 
A circuit court's decisions on motions for summary 
judgment, statutory interpretation, and subject matter 
jurisdiction are reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Tax Found. of Haw. v. State, 144 Hawai #i 175, 185–86, 439 P.3d 
127, 137–38 (2019). 
Discussion 
The circuit court concluded it did not have subject 
matter jurisdiction over the Hui's declaratory judgment action; 
it did not reach the merits of the Hui's claims. Hawai#i Rules 
of Civil Procedure ( HRCP
) Rule 12(h)(3) requires dismissal when 
subject matter jurisdiction is lacking.3 The circuit court 
should have entered an order dismissing the case rather than an order granting summary judgment and a judgment. Mobley v. 
Kimura, 146 Hawai #i 311, 325 n.23, 463 P.3d 968, 982 n.23 (2020) 
(stating that when circuit court dismissed complaint for failure to meet tort threshold, its order should have indicated a "dismissal" rather than a grant of "partial summary judgment").
(1) The Hui contends the circuit court erred by 
concluding that its "failure to proceed under the statutory process for review of an agency decision under [HRS] Chapter 91 divests the court of authority to issue an order for declaratory and injunctive relief."
4 The argument has merit. 
The circuit court relied on Ko #olau Agricultural Co. v. 
Commission on Water Resource Management , 83 Hawai#i 484, 927 P.2d 
1367 (1996). There, the Commission on Water Resource Management (CWRM) had designated five aquifers as water management areas 
under the State Water Code, HRS Chapter 174C. Ko #olau Ag sued 
CWRM for a declaration that CWRM misapplied the statutory 
designation criteria. CWRM moved to dismiss. The circuit court granted the motion. Ko#olau Ag appealed. It "recharacterize[d] 
its claims as allegations of improper rulemaking" and argued the 
3 HRCP Rule 12(h)(3) (eff. 2000) provides: "Whenever it appears by
suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of
the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action." 
4 The Hui's statement of the points of error does not identify the
circuit court's denial of the Hui's motion for summary judgment as error. 
4  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circuit court had jurisdiction under HRS § 91-7, which provided 
for declaratory judgments "as to the validity of an agency rule[.]" Id. at 489, 927 P.2d at 1372. The supreme court 
dismissed the argument, noticing that Ko #olau Ag actually sought 
"invalidation of the [water management area] designation." Id. 
The supreme court then analyzed HRS § 174C-46. That 
statute made CWRM's water management area designations "final unless judicially appealed ." Id. at 487, 927 P.2d at 1370. The 
supreme court held that by enacting HRS § 174C-46, 
the legislature obviously intended an appeal as the
exclusive means of obtaining judicial review of a [watermanagement area] designation decision. It is well established that where a statutory avenue for appeal of an
agency decision  is available, an original action for
declaratory judgment does not lie. 
Id. at 492–93, 927 P.2d at 1375–76 (emphasis added). 
Here, BLNR's decision to continue KIUC's revocable 
permit was made under HRS § 171-55 in a public meeting. See 
Carmichael v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res., 150 Hawai #i 547, 563, 506 
P.3d 211, 227 (2022) (stating that "HRS § 171-55 potentially 
authorized the BLNR to continue the revocable permits"). 
HRS 
§ 171-55 (2011) provided: 
Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the board of
land and natural resources may issue permits for thetemporary occupancy of state lands or an interest therein ona month–to–month basis by direct negotiation without publicauction, under conditions and rent which will serve the bestinterests of the State, subject, however, to thoserestrictions as may from time to time be expressly imposedby the board. A permit on a month–to–month basis maycontinue for a period not to exceed one year from the dateof its issuance; provided that the board may allow thepermit to continue on a month–to–month basis for additionalone year periods. 
Unlike HRS § 174C-46 (at issue in Ko #olau Ag), HRS 
§ 171-55 does not create a statutory avenue for appealing BLNR's 
decision to continue a permit. 
The Hui could not have appealed 
BLNR's decision under HRS § 91-14 because it was made during a 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
public meeting, not after a contested case.5 Such decisions are 
subject to declaratory judgments under HRS § 632-1, provided the 
other statutory elements are met; the HRS § 632-1(b) proviso that "[w]here however, a statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of case, that statutory remedy shall be followed" doesn't apply here. 
For example, in Carmichael , BLNR approved continuations 
of permits under HRS § 171-55 in a public meeting. Carmichael sued for a declaration that preparation of an environmental assessment under the Hawai #i Environmental Policy Act, HRS 
Chapter 343 ( HEPA
) was required. The supreme court declared: 
"Given the significant environmental impact of the permitted action, the BLNR's authority to issue revocable permits is subject to the environmental review requirements of HEPA." 150 Hawai#i at 553, 506 P.3d at 217. The supreme court was obligated 
to ensure it had jurisdiction over the case and to dismiss the appeal on its own if it concluded it lacked jurisdiction. See 
Ditto v. McCurdy , 103 Hawai #i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003). 
No issue of jurisdiction was raised at any level of the proceeding, indicating that courts have jurisdiction over declaratory judgment actions concerning BLNR decisions under HRS § 171-55. 
The circuit court erred by concluding it did not have 
jurisdiction over the Hui's action for declaratory and injunctive relief.

(2) The State contends the circuit court erred by 
making finding of fact no. 12, "finding that [BLNR] did not issue findings that continuing the permit was in the best interests of the state or about whether the permit complies with the public 
5 The Hui could have appealed BLNR's denial of a formal request for
a contested case hearing under HRS § 91-14, Kaleikini v. Thielen , 124 Hawai#i 
1, 26, 237 P.3d 1067, 1092 (2010), but requesting a contested case is not a
prerequisite to seeking declaratory relief under HRS § 632-1. 
6 We express no opinion whether KIUC is a necessary or indispensable
party to the action below under HRCP Rule 19.

trust doctrine" after concluding it had no jurisdiction over the 
Hui's lawsuit. 
A court deciding a motion for summary judgment for lack 
of subject matter jurisdiction may resolve factual disputes over the existence of jurisdiction. Cf.
 Yamane v. Pohlson, 111 
Hawai#i 74, 81, 137 P.3d 980, 987 (2006) (discussing procedure on 
HRCP Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction). Here, finding of fact no. 12 was one of six 
findings (nos. 10-15) material to the circuit court's conclusions of law nos. 3-5 — that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the Hui didn't take the steps necessary to appeal BLNR's decision under HRS § 91-14. 
The Hui incorrectly characterizes finding of fact 
no. 12 as a conclusion of law. 
The circuit court found: 
12. [BLNR] voted to renew RP 7340 without first
entering any findings of fact and conclusions of law
supporting permit renewal, and without issuing any findingsthat continuing the permit was in the best interests of theState for the 2022 calendar year, and whether continuing thepermit complies with the public trust doctrine[.] 
This was not a conclusion of law. It was not even a 
mixed finding and conclusion. It makes no legal conclusion about 
BLNR's duties when making decisions during public meetings, or about whether BLNR breached a legal duty under the circumstances of this case.
7 
7 The Hui relies on Carmichael  to argue that if BLNR doesn't "render
specific findings of fact and conclusions of law" it doesn't "comply with HRS
§ 171-55 or its public trust obligations." But see Frankel v. Bd. of Land & 
Nat. Res. , 155 Hawai# i 358, 379, 564 P.3d 1157, 1178 (App. 2025) ("[E]ven in
the absence of explicit public trust findings in the agency's decision, thedecision may nonetheless be upheld if the public record  reflects an 
application of the public trust principles." (emphasis added) (citing In re
