ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION AND 
ORDER OF CORRECTION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon review of (1) the Request for Relief from Decision

KK (KK), (2) this court's Order Dismissing Appeal for Lack of 
Jurisdiction entered on August 14, 2023 (August 14, 2023 Dismissal Order), (3) the papers in support, and (4) the record, it appears that: 
1. KK moves for reconsideration of the August 14, 2023

2. The motion is untimely. See Rule 40(a), Hawai#i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure. 
3. The date on line 5 of the August 14, 2023 Dismissal 
Order is incorrect; the date should be December 27, 2022, not 
December 21, 2022. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is 
denied. 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that line 5 of the 
August 14, 2023 Dismissal Order is corrected to read, "on 
December 27, 2022, but the Notice of Appeal was filed more than thirty days after the Order[.]" 
The Clerk of the Court is directed to take all 
necessary steps to notify the publishing agencies of this change.
