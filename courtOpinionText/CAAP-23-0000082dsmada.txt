OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I  
HAWAIIAN RANCHOS ROAD MAINTENANCE CORPORATION,
a Hawaii corporation, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MANUEL LOPEZ; MARIA LOPEZ;
STEPHANA PROKSCHL, fka STEPHANIE HADLEY;
COUNTY OF HAWAII, DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE, Defendants-Appellees,
and WILLIAM GILROY, Defendant-Appellant, and

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 3CCV-22-0000063) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Guidry, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that self-
represented Defendant-Appellant William Gilroy appeals from the 
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit's (circuit court) January 20, 
2023 "Order Granting Entry of Default of Defendants Manuel Lopez, 
Maria Lopez and Stephana Prokschl, formerly known as Stephanie Hadley[,] Regarding Service by Publication of Summons" (Default 
Order). 
The court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal because 
the Default Order is not a final, appealable order or judgment. 
See
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016); Hawai#i 
Rules of Civil Procedure Rules 54(b), 58; 
Jenkins v. Cades 
Schutte Fleming & Wright
, 76 Hawai#i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 
1338 (1994). Further, the Default Order is not independently NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appealable under the collateral-order doctrine, the Forgay1 
doctrine, or HRS ยง 641-1(b). See Greer v. Baker , 137 Hawai#i 
249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (setting forth the 
requirements for appealability under the collateral-order doctrine and the 
Forgay doctrine); HRS ยง 641-1(b) (specifying 
requirements for leave to file interlocutory appeal). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any and all pending motions 
are dismissed.
