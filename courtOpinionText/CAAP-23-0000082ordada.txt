Upon consideration of self-represented Defendant-
Appellant William Gilroy's (1) June 26, 2023 "Motion for

"Motion to Stay Pending Appeal," (3) June 26, 2023 "Motion for Estoppel of ORDER and JUDGMENT for wrongful foreclosure," (collectively, Motions), the papers in support, and the record, 
it appears that on June 19, 2023, the court dismissed the appeal 
for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 1
1 The "Motion for Reconsideration of ORDER and JUDGMENT" appears to
seek reconsideration of the circuit court's orders and judgment. Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motions are 
dismissed as moot.
