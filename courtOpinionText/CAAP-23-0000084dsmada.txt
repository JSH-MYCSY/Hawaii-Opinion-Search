called to the court's attention on April 24, 2023, for 
appropriate action, which could include dismissal of the appeal, under 
Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 12.1(e) 
and 30, and Launani Assets could request relief from default by motion;
1 
(4) On May 16, 2023, twenty-two days after the 
April 24, 2023 deadline set forth in the default notice, Launani Assets filed a Stipulation for Dismissal of Appeal
2 signed by 
counsel for Launani Assets and counsel for Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-Appellee U.S. Bank National Association only, stating that they agree to dismiss the appeal with prejudice, and each party shall bear its own attorneys' fees and costs associated with the appeal; and 
(5) Launani Assets fails to demonstrate that it served 
the stipulation on all parties, and it is not apparent whether the parties who did not sign the stipulation are nominal appellees. Nonetheless, dismissal of the appeal is authorized by HRAP Rules 12.1(e) and 30. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Stipulation for 
Dismissal of Appeal is dismissed.
