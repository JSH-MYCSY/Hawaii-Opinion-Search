On January 22, 2018, the State filed a motion to revoke 
Robello's probation; on March 29, 2018, Robello was resentenced, 
including another four-year term of probation and Robello entered 
the HOPE Probation Program. 
On March 11, 2019, the State filed a Motion for 
Modification of the Terms and Conditions of Probation due to 
Robello's violations of the terms and conditions of her probation 
(Motion for Modification ). After an initial failure-to-appear, a 
hearing was held on May 14, 2019, and the Motion for Modification 
was granted, with the terms of Robello's probation modified to 
include an additional forty-eight days in jail.3 
On May 19, 2022, the State filed a motion to revoke 
Robello's probation on multiple grounds (Motion for Revocation ). 
On September 6, 2022, Robello filed a motion to terminate 
probation, arguing that motions to modify probation are not 
tolling motions, and therefore, her probation ended on March 29, 
2022, and the Motion for Revocation was untimely (Motion to 
Terminate ). The Circuit Court denied Robello's motion and 
granted the State's motion. Robello timely filed a notice of 
appeal from both orders. 
Robello raises two points of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court erred in: (1) granting the 
State's Motion for Revocation; and (2) denying Robello's Motion 
to Terminate. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to

         NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve 
Robello's points of error as follows: 
In her first point of error, Robello argues that the 
Circuit Court erred when it granted the Motion for Revocation 
because Robello's probation expired on March 29, 2022, and the 
court no longer had jurisdiction to adjudicate the Motion for 
Revocation, pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 706-630 
(2014) (providing that upon termination of the period of 
probation, a defendant is automatically discharged from further 
obligations). In her second point of error, Robello argues, 
variously, that the Circuit Court erred in denying the Motion to 
Terminate because the Circuit Court lacked authority to extend 
Robello's probation. 
The crux of Robello's arguments is that the Motion for 
Modification was not a tolling motion, and therefore, Robello's 
probationary term expired before the Motion for Revocation was 
filed. 
HRS ยง 706-625 (2014) provides, in pertinent part: 
ยง 706-625 Revocation, modification of probation 
conditions. (1) The court, on application of a probation 
officer, the prosecuting attorney, the defendant, or on its 
own motion, after a hearing, may revoke probation except as 
provided in subsection (7), reduce or enlarge the conditions 
of a sentence of probation, pursuant to the provisions 
applicable to the initial setting of the conditions and the 
provisions of section 706-627. 
   . . . . 
(4
) The court may modify the requirements imposed on 
the defendant or impose further requirements, if it finds 
that such action will assist the defendant in leading a 
law-abiding life. 
HRS ยง 706-627 (2014) provides: 
ยง 706-627 Tolling of probation. (1) Upon the filing 
of a motion to revoke a probation or a motion to enlarge the 
conditions imposed thereby, the period of probation shall be 
tolled pending the hearing upon the motion and the decision 
of the court. The period of tolling shall be computed from 
the filing date of the motion through and including the 
filing date of the written decision of the court concerning 
3          
        
           
          
          
          
        
         
     
        
        
      
        
         
        
           
     
       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the motion for purposes of computation of the remaining 
period of probation, if any. In the event the court fails 
to file a written decision upon the motion, the period shall 
be computed by reference to the date the court makes a 
decision upon the motion in open court. During the period 
of tolling of the probation, the defendant shall remain 
subject to all terms and conditions of the probation except 
as otherwise provided by this chapter. 
(2) In the event the court, following hearing, 
refuses to revoke the probation or grant the requested 
enlargement of conditions thereof because the defendant's 
failure to comply therewith was excusable, the defendant may 
be granted the period of tolling of the probation for 
purposes of computation of the remaining probation, if any. 
This  court  rejected  arguments  nearly  identical  to 
Robello's  arguments  here  (concerning  the  tolling  of  probation)  in 
State  v.  Wilbur-Delima,  154  Hawai i  496,  502-03,  555   P.3d  660, 
666-67  (App.  2024);  see  also  State  v.  Holland-Dornath,  CAAP-21-
0000442,  2024  WL  3936732,  *2  (Haw.  App.  Aug.  26,  2024)  (SDO) 
(following  Wilbur-Delima);  State  v.  Frederico,  CAAP-22-0000581, 
2025  WL  664755,  *2-3  (Haw.  App.  Feb.  27,  2025)  (SDO)  (same).  
Based  on  the  reasoning  set  forth  in  Wilbur-Delima,  we  reiterate 
that  a  motion  to  modify  probation  that  seeks  to  enlarge  a 
condition  of  probation  is  a  tolling  motion.  
Like  the  appellant  in  Wilbur-Delima,  Robello  had 
entered  the  HOPE  Probation  Program.   Although  the  subject  Motion 
for  Modification  was  not  entitled  as  a  motion  to  enlarge 
sentence,  an  enlarged  probation  condition,  i.e.,  more  jail  time, 
was  sought;  Robello  stipulated  to  the  violations  of  the 
conditions  of  probation,  the  motion  was  granted,  and  Robello  was 
ordered  to  serve  additional  jail  time.   Accordingly,  the  Circuit 
Court  did  not  err  in  treating  the  State's  Motion  for  Modification 
as  a  tolling  motion.4 
4 Robello's argument that the Rule of Lenity must be applied is also 
without merit. See Wilbur-Delima , 154 Hawai i at 506, 555 P.3d at 670.
