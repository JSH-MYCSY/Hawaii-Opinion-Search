APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CPC-19-0001021) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Guidry, JJ.) 
  Defendant-Appellant Dutchie L. Kaluna ( Kaluna) appeals 
from the February 1, 2023 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence 
entered by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit ( Circuit 
Court).  In accordance with a plea agreement with Plaintiff-
Appellee State of Hawai ‘i (State), Kaluna and a co-defendant each 1

pled no contest to Kidnapping in violation of Hawaii Revised 
Statutes ( HRS) § 707-720(1)(e).   Following a February 1, 2023 
sentencing hearing, Kaluna was sentenced to a ten-year term of 
imprisonment for Kidnapping, to run consecutive to the sentences imposed in 1CPC-20-0001376, 1CPC-20-0001130, 1CPC-20-0000567, 1CPC-19-0001727, 1CPC-19-0001664, and 1CPC-18-0001065.

  On appeal, Kaluna challenges the imposition of 
consecutive sentencing, contending that the Circuit Court 
improperly "infer[red] a lack of remorse" by Kaluna, who "ha[d] 
pled no contest to an offense and ha[d] not spoken about the offense conduct [sic] to either the presentence investigator or the court, and use[d] this as a negative factor for sentencing[.]" Kaluna argues that the Circuit Court sentenced Kaluna to the "harsher" consecutive sentence and "commented 
twice that [Kaluna]'s lack of remorse was a factor in this 
sentencing decision." 
2 The underlying case arose out of a December 7, 2013 sexual
assault allegation. Along with a co-defendant, Kaluna was charged with three
counts of Sexual Assault in the First Degree, one count of Attempted Sexual
Assault in the First Degree, one count of Sexual Assault in the Third Degree,
and one count of Kidnapping. The record reflects that a jury-waived trialwas commenced on September 6, 2022 but not completed, and the parties enteredinto a plea agreement on September 7, 2022. Pursuant to the plea agreement,the sexual assault counts in the Indictment were "removed" from a "Complaint
Superseding Indictment" filed September 7, 2022, which only contained a
single Kidnapping charge. 
3 The Presentence Investigation Report ( PSI Report ) reflects that
at the time of the February 1, 2023 sentencing hearing, Kaluna was servingconcurrent terms of imprisonment for numerous felony offenses in six
different criminal cases: 1CPC-20-0001376, 1CPC-20-0001300, 1CPC-20-0001130,
1CPC-20-0000567, 1CPC-19-0001727, 1CPC-19-0001664. These offenses included Fraudulent Use of a Credit Card, Theft in the First Degree, UnauthorizedPossession of Confidential Personal Information (two counts), Identity Theftin the Third Degree (two counts), Attempted Theft in the Third Degree,
Habitual Property Crime, Burglary in the First Degree, Unauthorized Entry
Into a Motor Vehicle in the First Degree, Unauthorized Control of a PropelledVehicle, and Criminal Property Damage in the First, Second (three counts),and Third Degrees (two counts).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Kaluna's point of error as follows, and affirm. 
We review a sentencing court's imposition of sentence 
for an abuse of discretion. See State v. Hussein
, 122 Hawai ‘i 
495, 503, 229 P.3d 313, 321 (2010). A sentencing court has 
discretion to impose consecutive prison sentences. HRS 
§ 706-668.5(1); State v. Kong, 131 Hawai ‘i 94, 101, 315 P.3d 720, 
727 (2013). 
At sentencing, the Circuit Court indicated that it had 
reviewed the PSI Report and the records and files of this case. 
The State argued for a consecutive ten-year prison term for this 
Kidnapping offense. 
Kaluna's counsel requested that the 
sentence run concurrent with Kaluna's current terms of 
imprisonment, disagreeing with the State's claim that a concurrent sentence "would amount to no punishment." Kaluna addressed the Circuit Court, stating that he had "been incarcerated for the last three years [and] three months"; that "[he had] been in there long enough to realize that [he did not] 
wanna [sic] be in there any longer"; and that he was "totally 
over all that crime . . . over the drugs." 
The Circuit Court explained its reasoning as follows: 
3  What strikes me the most is none of these gentlemen
care about the victim. They talked about themselves. They
talked about their families. It's like it never happened.It happened. 
  You pled no contest to Kidnapping. I was here. I 
read everything. I read the DNA. I read all the reports.And yes, there's discrepancies. I agree with that, andperhaps the better course of valor was to plead to theKidnapping. You don't have to register as a sexualoffender, and who knows what would have happened. I was 
gonna [sic] make the decision. I didn't hear all the 
evidence. Right?       
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
So sometimes in life when you do something you gotta
[sic] pay for it. Sometimes when you cause a person to be
harmed, not necessarily physically but psychologically forthe rest of their lives, you gotta [sic] pay for it. 
I saw the victim. I never talked to her, just heard
testimony. I read the reports. . . . 
. . . . 
[(The Circuit Court first sentences the co-defendant,
then addresses Kaluna's sentence.)] 
 The Court also finds no remorse or acknowledgment of
the effect of any wrongful actions or any possible harm to
the defendant--to the victim. 
 The Court finds that he is currently under a term of
imprisonment. Under 706-668(5), multiple sentence of
imprisonment, 
  
"If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed
on a defendant, or if a term of imprisonment isimposed upon a defendant who is already subject to anunexpired term of imprisonment, the terms of--the
terms may run concurrently or consecutively." 
 
I find in this case that Mr. Kaluna is currently
imprisoned on an unexpired term of imprisonment. He 
currently is I believe imprisoned on 1CPC-20-1376, 1CPC-20-
1300, 1CPC-20-1130, 1CPC-20-567, 1CPC-19-1727, 1CPC-19-
1664. 
  In determining the factors for imposing consecutive
sentencing the Court must consider whether the termsimposed are ordered to be run concurrently or consecutively
and must consider the factors set forth in Section 706-606. 
(Emphases added.) The Circuit Court applied HRS § 706-668.54 
because Kaluna was already serving terms of imprisonment, and 
4 HRS § 706-668.5 (2014), entitled "Multiple sentence of
imprisonment," provides: 
(1) If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a
defendant, whether at the same time or at different times,
or if a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant whois already subject to an unexpired term of imprisonment,the terms may run concurrently or consecutively. . . . 
(2) The court, in determining whether the terms imposed are to
be ordered to run concurrently or consecutively, shallconsider the factors set forth in section 706-606.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 706-668.5 requires the sentencing court to consider the 
HRS § 706-606  sentencing factors in determining whether to order 
concurrent or consecutive sentencing.  The Circuit Court then 
applied the HRS § 706-606 factors as follows: 5
In this particular case the circumstances of the
offense are egregious and serve no purpose and also were
harmful to the victim. That the history involving Mr.
Kaluna currently on unexpired terms of prison indicate thecharacteristics involving this defendant. 
 
The Court considers the need for the sentence to be 
imposed, and the Court finds that this is proper to protect
the public from harm, threatened harm or any activities. 
 
Because [sic] the nature of the charges and the pleas
the Court must reflect the seriousness of the offense to 
the defendant for -- to promote the respect of law and to
provide just punishment for the offense. The Court findsthat the seriousness of the offense must be taken into 
(Emphasis added.) 
5 HRS § 706-606 (2014) requires a sentencing court to consider the
following "[f]actors to be considered in imposing a sentence": 
(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the history
and characteristics of the defendant; 
(2) The need for the sentence imposed; 
(a) To reflect the seriousness of the offense, to
promote respect for law, and to provide justpunishment for the offense; 
(b) To afford adequate deterrence to criminal
conduct; 
(c) To protect the public from further crimes of
the defendant; and 
(d) To provide the defendant with needed
educational or vocational training, medical care,
or other correctional treatment in the most 
effective manner; 
(3) The kinds of sentences available; and 
(4) The need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among
defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of
similar conduct. 
5       
 
  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
consideration in determining whether it should be
consecutive or concurrent. 
The Court also considers the adequate deterrence to
criminal conduct. Although this took place many years ago
there's no indication from his current history that he
intends to change. I give him credit for not -- not havingwrite-ups, but I find that to be de minimus. 
 
The Court also must consider [sic] to protect the
public from further crimes of the defendant. I think the
record speak [sic] for itself that he is a careerindividual who has so many cases that it's difficult tokeep track of them. 
 
The Court also needs to provide the defendant -- the
Court also needs to consider and avoid unwarranted sentence 
disparities among defendants with similar records who havebeen found guilty of similar conduct. 
 
Court finds that based on the following factors, the
Court having considered all of them, Court will issue the
following judgment. 
. . . . 
Defendant is committed to the custody of the
Department of Public Safety for incarceration for an
indeterminate period of 10 years with credit for any andall jail time served. 
Said terms of incarceration shall 
run consecutive to the sentences imposed in 1CPC-20-1376,1CPC-20-1130, 1CPC-20-567, 1CPC-19-1727, 1CPC-19-1664 and1CPC-18-1065. Mittimus forthwith. 
A sentencing court may consider a defendant's lack of 
remorse. See HRS § 706-606(1) (consideration of defendant's 
characteristics). "[W]hile lack of remorse legitimately may be 
considered as a factor in sentencing, a court may never cross 
the line into attempting 'to compel an admission of guilt or punish the defendant for maintaining his innocence.'" State v.
Nakamitsu, 140 
Hawai ‘i 157, 166, 398 P.3d 746, 755 (2017) 
(quoting State v. Kamana ‘o, 103 Hawai ‘i 315, 321, 82 P.3d 401, 
407 (2003)). 
Kaluna argues that a "no contest plea is not an 
indication of lack of remorse"; and that the Circuit Court 
"abused [its] discretion by inferring [a lack of] remorse" from 
6       
 
  
  
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
his "failure to state an apology and take responsibility for the 
alleged crimes in his allocution statement"; and "[i]n taking 
remorse into account and allowing it to play the primary role  in 
the final sentencing decision . . . ." 
Here, the Circuit Court's observation that Kaluna 
lacked remorse for the psychological harm to the victim of the Kidnapping was a "characteristic[ ] of the defendant" that could properly be considered. HRS § 706-606(1). The record does not 
support Kaluna's claim that the lack of remorse was " the 
primary" factor in the Circuit Court's sentencing decision, 
where the Circuit Court made multiple references to the "career" 
nature of Kaluna's numerous criminal cases that he was already imprisoned for. Nor did the Circuit Court run afoul of Nakamitsu by attempting to compel an admission of guilt or 
punish Kaluna for pleading no contest. See Nakamitsu, 140 
Hawai‘i at 166, 398 P.3d at 755. 
Relying on State v. Satoafaiga, 150 Hawai ‘i 406, 504 
P.3d 324 (2022),
6 Kaluna argues that "the sentencing court 
committed an error in [sic] respect to the factors it 
considered" and "the sentencing judge gave [weight] to [an] 
improperly applied factor." Kaluna does not provide further 
explanation of his Satoafaiga-based argument. See Hawai ‘i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be 
deemed waived."). Assuming arguendo  it is not waived, 
Satoafaiga does not apply. The record does not reflect the Circuit Court improperly considered the multiple sexual assault 
charges with which Kaluna had been charged, rather than the 
6 In Satoafaiga, the supreme court held it was improper for the
circuit court to consider a sexual penetration allegation where the sexual
assault charge the defendant pled no contest to did not include sexual
penetration. 150 Hawai ‘i at 418-19, 504 P.3d at 336-37.

single Kidnapping offense for which he was convicted. The 
Circuit Court referred to the need for Kaluna to be accountable 
for causing "a person to be harmed not necessarily physically but psychologically ," and did not refer to the harm as both 
physical and psychological in nature, as would be expected for sexual assault offenses. (Emphasis added.) The Circuit Court found that "the circumstances of the offense are egregious," 
referring to the subject offense in the singular, rather than 
using the plural "offenses." (Emphasis added.) Thus, the 
record is consistent with the Circuit Court properly confining its consideration to a single Kidnapping conviction and not multiple counts of sexual assault, and we find no abuse of 
discretion. See Hussein, 122 Hawai ‘i at 503, 229 P.3d at 321. 
For the foregoing reasons, the February 1, 2023 
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence by the Circuit Court of the 
Third Circuit, is affirmed.
