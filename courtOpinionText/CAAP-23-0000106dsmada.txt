APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CCV-21-0000297) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Defendants-Appellees David Lawton 
and Jung & Vassar P.C.'s (
Appellees) April 25, 2023 Motion to 
Dismiss Appeal (Motion), the papers in support, the record, and 
there being no opposition, it appears that: 
(1)
 On March 6, 2023, self-represented Plaintiff-
Appellant Howard Hofelich (Hofelich), filed the notice of appeal 
without paying the fee required by Hawai#i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 3(a); 
(2)
 The same day, the appellate clerk notified Hofelich 
to pay the filing fee or file a motion for leave to proceed on 
appeal in forma pauperis on or before March 16, 2023, or the 
appeal could be dismissed; NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) On April 25, 2023, Appellees filed the Motion, 
seeking dismissal of the appeal due to, among other things, 
Hofelich's failure to pay filing fees. 
(4) The record on appeal was due on or before May 5, 
2023, see HRAP Rule 11(b)(1), but was not filed because Hofelich failed to pay the filing fee or obtain a fee waiver; 
(5) On May 8, 2023, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Hofelich that the time to docket the appeal had expired, Hofelich had not paid the filing fee or obtained an order allowing him to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis, the matter would be brought to the court's attention on May 18, 2023, for action that may include dismissal of the appeal, and Hofelich could seek relief from default by motion; and 
(6) Hofelich has not taken any further action in this 
appeal. An appeal may be dismissed where the record on appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to proceed in forma pauperis. HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
granted and the appeal is dismissed. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.
