APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CCV-21-0000297) 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION AND 
ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of: Defendants-Appellees David 
Lawton and Jung & Vassar P.C.'s (Appellees) June 15, 2023 Motion 
for Reconsideration of Order Granting Motion for Reconsideration 
(Motion to Reconsider); Defendants-Appellees State of Hawai#i and 
DCCA's (State Parties) June 16, 2023 Joinder to [the Motion to 
Reconsider]; Appellees' June 15, 2023 Second Motion to Dismiss 
Appeal (Second Motion to Dismiss); the State Parties'  June 16, 
2023 Joinder to [the Second Motion to Dismiss]; the papers in  
support, the record, and there being no opposition to either motion, it appears that: 
(1)
 On March 6, 2023, self-represented Plaintiff-
Appellant Howard Hofelich (Hofelich), filed the notice of appeal   without paying the fee required by Hawai# i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (
HRAP) Rule 3(a); 
(2)
 On April 25, 2023, Appellees filed a motion to 
dismiss the appeal (First Motion to Dismiss)
 on four grounds, one 
being that Hofelich failed to pay the appellate filing fee or 
obtain a fee waiver; 
(3) On May 30, 2023, the court granted the First Motion 
to Dismiss under HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2) (Dismissal Order), 
noting that the record on appeal had not been prepared due to 
Hofelich's failure to pay the required fees or obtain a fee waiver, the appellate clerk had entered a default of the record on appeal, and Hofelich failed to seek relief from the default; 
(4) On June 2, 2023, Hofelich tendered payment of the 
filing fees and moved for relief from the default of the record on appeal and reconsideration of the Dismissal Order. On June 13, 2023, the court granted the request and reinstated the appeal (Reinstatement Order); 
(5) Appellees now ask the court to set aside the 
Reinstatement Order or dismiss the appeal based on the other arguments raised in the First Motion to Dismiss, i.e., that: (a) Intervenor-Appellant South Pacific Scuba Tours, Inc. (South 
Pacific) did not seek leave to intervene in the underlying case, 
and Hofelich cannot represent it in the appeal; (b) the appeal is 
barred by the doctrine of res judicata; and (c) Hofelich is a vexatious litigant bringing frivolous claims and has failed to obtain leave to proceed on appeal as required by Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 634J-7 (2016). Appellees additionally argue 
that the Reinstatement Order should be set aside because Hofelich 
falsely represented he was unable to pay the filing fee, and that the court should reverse, modify, or narrow its policy of affording deference to self-represented parties when they are vexatious litigants;
1 
(6) South Pacific is not named as a party in the 
pleadings, and the record does not indicate that the circuit 
1 As the arguments in the Motion to Reconsider overlap with those in
Second Motion to Dismiss, we address them together. 
2 court granted South Pacific intervenor status. Though not a 
basis to set aside the Reinstatement Order or dismiss the appeal, South Pacific is not a proper party to the appeal. HRAP Rule 2.1(b);
2 
(7) Appellees' arguments based on res judicata address 
the merits of the appeal and fail to establish that the court lacks appellate jurisdiction; 
(8) The court determines whether an appeal is frivolous 
after rendering a decision on the merits. HRAP Rule 38. Appellees cite no authority for the court to dismiss the appeal as frivolous. Even if Hofelich is barred "from filing any new litigation" as a vexatious litigant, Appellees fail to demonstrate that he is precluded from filing a notice of appeal from an existing civil action or proceeding under HRS §§ 634J-1 (2016) and 634J-7; 
(9) The court reinstated the appeal in deference to 
Hofelich's self-represented status and in adherence to the policy of hearing cases on the merits where possible. Despite Hofelich's status as a vexatious litigant, it is possible to hear his arguments on the merits, and the Hawai# i Supreme Court has 
instructed that the filings of pro se litigants be liberally interpreted if possible. Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai# i 368, 380–81, 
465 P.3d 815, 827–28 (2020). 
We do not find Appellees' other 
arguments availing. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to 
Reconsider is denied. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Second Motion to Dismiss 
is granted-in-part and denied-in-part as follows: 
1. The request to dismiss South Pacific Scuba Tours, 
Inc. from the appeal is granted; 
2. The request to dismiss the appeal under the 
doctrine of res judicata 
is denied without prejudice to raising 
res judicata arguments in the briefs; 
2 HRAP Rule 2.1(b) defines "party" as a "named plaintiff, defendant,
petitioner, respondent, claimant, or intervenor in the court or agency
proceeding and anyone who has standing to seek review of the court or agencyorder or judgment." 
3 3. The request to dismiss the appeal as frivolous and 
because Hofelich is a vexatious litigant is denied, without 
prejudice to raising such arguments in the briefs or by motion under HRAP Rule 38; and 
4. 
All other relief requested is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai#i, July 14, 2023.
