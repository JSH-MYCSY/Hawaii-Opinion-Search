SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
This appeal arises from an order designating self-
represented Plaintiff-Appellant Howard Hofelich (Hofelich) as a 
vexatious litigant.

Hofelich appeals from1 the (1) December 16, 2022 
"Findings of Facts [sic] [(FOFs)], Conclusions of Law [(COLs)] 
and Order Granting Defendants David Lawton, Esq. and Jung & Vassar, P.C.'s Motion to Designate [Hofelich] a Vexatious Litigant and for an Order to Post Security and Prefiling Order" 
(Vexatious Litigant Prefiling Order); and (2) February 21, 2023 
"Order Dismissing [Hofelich]'s Complaint with Prejudice as to all Claims and Parties" (Dismissal Order), both filed by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (Circuit Court).

Hofelich's Opening Brief is difficult to discern. On 
appeal, Hofelich appears to raise nine points of error (POEs), the majority of which are difficult to discern and irrelevant to 
the current appeal, and all of which do not comply with Hawaiʻ i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28. The POEs do not 
state "the alleged error committed by the court"; "where in the record the alleged error occurred"; and "where in the record the alleged error was objected to or the manner in which the alleged error was brought to the attention of the court." HRAP Rule 
28(b)(4). The only discernible POE that appears relevant to the 
current appeal is that the Circuit Court was "prohibited by the 8
th Amendment by [sic] declaring . . . Hofelich to be a vexatious 
litigant" and could not "impose[] [a] fine of $90,000" ($90,000 "fine").
3 We address this POE under the public policy of 
affording liberal review of pleadings by self-represented 
litigants "to facilitate access to justice" and to afford 
1 In the Notice of Appeal, Hofelich also attached various documents 
unrelated to the current appeal. 
2 The Honorable Robert D.S. Kim presided. 
3 To the extent Hofelich may be arguing that his due process rights 
were violated by the Vexatious Litigant Prefiling Order, we note the supreme 
court rejected this argument in EK v. Bo ggs
, 102 Hawaii ‘289,75 P.3d 1180 
(2003).

litigants the opportunity for appellate review despite their 
non-compliance with court rules. See Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawaiʻ i 
368, 380-81, 465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020) (citation omitted); Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawaiʻ i 490, 496, 280 P.3d 88, 94 (2012). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Hofelich's contention as follows, and affirm. 
Hofelich argues that the Circuit Court infringed the 
"8
th Amendment" by the Vexatious Litigant Prefiling Order and by 
imposing a $90,000 "fine." The Eighth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution pertains to bail in criminal cases, and does not 
apply here. The $90,000 was not imposed as a "fine," but imposed as security under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 634J-7, discussed infra. 
The record reflects that in response to Hofelich's 
Amended Complaint filed June 17, 2022, Defendants-Appellees 
David Lawton, Esq. and Jung & Vassar Law Corporation filed a 
June 28, 2022 "Motion to Designate [Hofelich] a Vexatious Litigant and for an Order to Post Security" (Vexatious Litigant Motion) pursuant to HRS § 634J-7.
4 The motion explained that 
4 HRS § 634J- 1 (2016) defines a "Vexatious litigant" as a pro se 
plaintiff who, in bad faith, attempts to improperly relitigate a determined
or concluded matter, or files unmeritorious, frivolous, or dilatory papers in 
any litigation, as follows: 
(2) After litigation has been finally resolved against the 
plaintiff, relitigates or attempts to relitigate in propriapersona and in bad faith, either: 
(A) The validity of the determination against the
same defendant or defendants as to whom the litigation was finally determined; or 
(B) The cause of action, claim, controversy, or any 
of the issues of fact or law, determined or concluded 
by the final determination against the same defendant

Hofelich filed various lawsuits raising the same claims from 
1997 through 2021 for which there was "no reasonable probability that Hofelich [would] prevail"; argued that Hofelich should be designated a vexatious litigant subject to a prefiling order; and requested the imposition of a "$500,000.00 security bond" or 
other amount determined by the court, and for litigation of 
Hofelich's Amended Complaint to be stayed until security was posted.

Litigant Motion, for which no transcript is provided,6 the

determined; [or] 
(3) In any litigation while acting in propria persona,
files, in bad faith, unmeritorious motions, pleadings, orother papers, conducts unnecessary discovery, or engages in other tactics that are frivolous or solely intended tocause unnecessary delay . . . . 
HRS § 634J- 7 (2016) provides a mechanism to obtain a "prefiling 
order prohibiting filing of new litigation" by any vexatious litigant. The 
statute permits the court, on "motion of any party," to enter a " prefiling 
order which prohibits a vexatious litigant from filing any new litigation in 
the courts of this State . . . without first obtaining leave" of the court.The court may also "condition the filing of the litigation upon the
furnishing of security for the benefit of the defendants as provided 
in section 634J- 4."  Id. 
Regarding the procedure and standards to set the "amount of
security," HRS § 634J- 4 (2016) provides:  
If, after hearing the evidence upon the motion, the court 
determines that the plaintiff is a vexatious litigant and that there is no reasonable probability that the plaintiff will prevail . . . the court shall order the plaintiff to
furnish, for the benefit of the moving defendant, security 
in an amount and within a time as the court shall fix.

Stephen Whittaker, Esq. joined the Vexatious Litigant Motion.

record. See HRAP Rule 10(b)(1)(A) (requiring the appellant to "file with the
appellate clerk, within 10 days after filing the notice of appeal, a request or requests to prepare a reporter's transcript of such parts of the
proceedings as the appellant deems necessary"); Bettencourt v. Bettencourt

Circuit Court filed its December 16, 2022 Vexatious Litigant 
Prefiling Order granting the motion, finding that: Hofelich filed various lawsuits from 2005 through 2017 "regarding the same claims and issues with respect to a judgment obtained against . . . Hofelich in the State of California and the 
subsequent enforcement of that judgment and execution upon 
vessels owned by [Hofelich] in the State of Hawaiʻ i" (listing 
nine separate lawsuits); "Hofelich while acting in propria 
persona, filed, in bad faith, unmeritorious cases, motions, pleadings, and other papers, . . . conducted unnecessary discovery, and engag[ed] in other tactics that were frivolous"; 
and "there [was] no reasonable possibility that [Hofelich] 
w[ould] prevail in the litigation." 
FOFs 5-22. Hofelich does 
not present any argument challenging the FOFs, and they are binding. See Okada Trucking Co., Ltd. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 
97 Hawaiʻ i 450, 458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002). 
Here, in light of these FOFs, the Circuit Court's 
determination that Hofelich was a vexatious litigant under HRS §§ 634J-1(2) and (3) was within the scope of its discretion. 
See Ek
, 102 Hawaiʻi at 294, 75 P.3d at 1185 (reviewing vexatious 
litigant determination for abuse of discretion). The Circuit 
Court properly issued the HRS § 634J-7 prefiling order 
prohibiting Hofelich "from filing any new litigation" in Hawaiʻ i 
state courts on his "own behalf without first obtaining leave of 
the presiding judge of the court where the litigation is proposed to be filed." 
See id. These FOFs also support the 
Circuit Court's order for Hofelich to post $90,000 security 
in an appeal to show error by reference to matters in the record, and he or 
she has the responsibility of providing an adequate transcript." (cleaned 
up)).

within 45 days, as a condition of staying the dismissal of the 
instant case. See HRS § 634J-7. 
Because Hofelich did not post the security within the 
forty-five-day deadline, the Circuit Court properly dismissed the case with prejudice, pursuant to HRS § 634J-7. Hofelich 
does not present discernible argument challenging the Dismissal 
Order. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed 
waived."). 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the December 16, 
2022 Vexatious Litigant Prefiling Order and the February 21, 2023 Dismissal Order, both filed by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit. 
In light of our resolution of this appeal, all pending 
motions are dismissed as moot.
