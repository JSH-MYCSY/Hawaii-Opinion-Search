NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
NO. CAAP-23-00000115 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
CONTINENTAL PACIFIC, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company,
Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
VANCE PHILLIP DUBUCLET, Defendant-Appellant, and
PORTFOLIO RECOVERY ASSOCIATES, LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company;
and DOE DEFENDANTS 1-10, Defendants-Appellees. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 3CCV-21-0000096) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that self-
represented Defendant-Appellant Vance Phillip DuBuclet (DuBuclet) 
appeals from the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit's: 
(1) Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure, and (2) Judgment, entered September 16, 2022.   
We lack jurisdiction over the appeal, as DuBuclet 
failed to file the Notice of Appeal within thirty days after September 16, 2022.  See 
Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rules 4(a)(1) ("[T]he notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable order[.]") and 26(e) ("The reviewing court for good cause shown may relieve a party from a default occasioned by any failure to comply with these rules, except the failure to give timely notice of appeal."); Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986) ("an appellant's failure to file a timely notice of appeal NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
is a jurisdictional defect that can neither be waived by the 
parties nor disregarded by the court in the exercise of judicial discretion") (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed as moot. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, May 9, 2023.
