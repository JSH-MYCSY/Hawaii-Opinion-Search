IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
DWIGHT J. VICENTE, Claimant-Appellant-Appellant, v.
HILO MEDICAL INVESTORS, LTD., dba LIFE CARE CENTER OF HILO,
Employer-Appellee-Appellee, and 
AMERICAN HOME ASSURANCE CO.,
Insurance Carrier-Appellee-Appellee, and
GALLAGHER BASSETT, Insurance-Adjuster-Appellee-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD 
(CASE NO. AB 2015-259(H)(S6); DCD NO. 1-87-00882) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that self-
represented Claimant-Appellant-Appellant Dwight J. Vicente 
(
Vicente) appeals from a February 24, 2023 Order to Amend Caption 
(Caption Order) entered by the Labor and Industrial Relations 
Appeals Board (LIRAB) in Case No. 2015-259(H)(S6). An aggrieved 
party may appeal from a final decision and order by the LIRAB 
directly to this court under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§§ 386-88 (2015) and 91-14 (2012). For purposes of HRS 
§ 91-14(a), "final order" means "an order ending the proceedings,leaving nothing further to be accomplished[;] . . . Consequently, an order is not final if the rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the matter is retained for further action." Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. Ctr. for Women & 
Child., 89 Hawai# i 436, 439, 974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999) (cleaned
up). 
The court lacks jurisdiction because the Caption Order is NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
not a final order, and the record on appeal in CAAP-23-0000131 
does not appear to otherwise include a final, appealable decision or order by the LIRAB. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai#i, August 16, 2023.
