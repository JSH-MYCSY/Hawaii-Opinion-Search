(CIVIL NO. 3CCV-20-0000098) 
ORDER DENYING MOTION AND DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Nakasone, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of self-represented Appellant-
Appellant William Middleton's (Middleton) February 19, 2025 
Motion for Relief from Default of the Opening Brief (ND2) Dated: 02/12/25 - Docket: 195 - Exhibit A (Motion), the papers in support, and the record, it appears that: 
(1)
 The opening brief was due a tenth extension of time 
on or before November 27, 2024;1 
(2) The court denied Middleton's motion for an eleventh 
extension of time for the opening brief, and denied his subsequent motion for reconsideration of that order; 
1 Three times the court cautioned Middleton that no further extensions 
of time would be granted absent extraordinary circumstances. In granting the
tenth extension, the court ordered no further extensions of time would begranted. By November 27, 2024, the extensions totaled 513 days. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) Middleton then filed an application for writ of 
certiorari in the Hawai #i Supreme Court, which the supreme court 
dismissed without prejudice; 
(4) Middleton failed to file the opening brief or 
request another extension of time; 
(5) On February 12, 2025, the appellate clerk entered a 
default notice informing Middleton that the time for filing the 
opening brief had expired, the matter would be called to the court's attention on February 24, 2025, for appropriate action, which could include dismissal of the appeal, under Hawai #i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 30, and Middleton could request relief from default by motion; 
(6) Middleton seeks relief from default of the opening 
brief due to medical conditions and family responsibilities; and 
(5) Other than providing updates about certain chronic 
medical conditions, Middleton presents no new information from previous motions for extensions of time to file the opening brief. Over 600 days have now passed since the original opening brief filing deadline of July 3, 2023, yet Middleton does not indicate whether or when he expects to file the opening brief. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
denied and the appeal is dismissed. See
 HRAP Rule 30.
