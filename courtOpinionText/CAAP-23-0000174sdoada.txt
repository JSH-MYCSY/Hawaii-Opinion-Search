APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 5CC091000233) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Guidry, JJ.) 
John
 J. Freepartner, III and Lisa Marie Freepartner 
(together, the Freepartners) appeal from the February 22, 2023
Judgment for HSBC Bank USA, N.A. entered by the Circuit Court of 
the Fifth Circuit.1  We vacate the Judgment and remand for 
further proceedings. 
HSBC sued the Freepartners on September 1, 2009. The 
complaint alleged that HSBC purchased Property in Anahola, Kaua#i 
at a nonjudicial foreclosure sale; the Freepartners occupied the 
property; and HSBC was entitled to a writ of ejectment. The 
operative pleading is HSBC's third amended complaint, filed on 
September 18, 2020. It sought: (1) a declaration that HSBC's 
foreclosure is valid and HSBC owns the Property; (2) an equitable

lien for unjust enrichment; (3) a writ of ejectment; (4) damages 
for negligent misrepresentation; (5) damages from Lisa for 
forgery; and (6) damages for fraud. 
HSBC moved for partial summary judgment on count 2. It 
requested an equitable lien against the Property. The circuit 
court entered findings of fact (FOF), conclusions of law (COL), 
and an Order granting the motion on February 22, 2023. The Order 
contained a finding of no just reason for delay and directed 
entry of a final judgment on count 2 of the third amended 
complaint under Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 54(b). The 
Judgment was entered on February 22, 2023. 
This appeal followed. 
The Freepartners contend that the circuit court erred 
by granting HSBC's motion for partial summary judgment because:
(1)
 their note and mortgage were forged and the original lender's 
agent perpetrated the fraud; (2) HSBC did not prove it had 
possession of the note when it filed the original complaint; and
(3) HSBC's exhibits were inadmissible. They challenge FOF 
nos. 5, 6, 7, and 8 and COL nos. 5-24. 
We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. Nozawa 
v. Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3
, 142 Hawai#i 331, 338, 
418 P.3d 1187, 1194 (2018). 
The moving party has the burden to 
introduce admissible evidence to establish the material facts, 
show there is no genuine issue as to any of them, and explain why 
it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Id. at 342, 418 
P.3d at 1198. A fact is material if it would establish or refute 
an element of a cause of action or defense. Id.  We view the 
evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.

These FOFS are unchallenged:

Lisa signed her and John's names on a $750,000 promissory Note

2 A circuit court deciding a motion for summary judgment does not
make findings of fact. If the facts are controverted, summary judgment should
be denied. Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 56(c). We consider the 
circuit court's FOFs to be statements of the uncontroverted facts.

were used to pay off two loans secured by mortgages on the 
Property. The Freepartners made monthly $5,498.01 payments to 
Fremont between April 1, 2006 and February 1, 2008, but made no 
payments after that. HSBC or its predecessors paid at least 
$261,069.11 in real property taxes and insurance premiums for the 
Property. The Freepartners didn't cure their default or tender 
the unpaid loan balance.
(1) Count 2 of HSBC's third amended complaint sought 
an equitable lien based on unjust enrichment. The Freepartners 
argue there was "a genuine issue of material fact as to whether 
HSBC Bank is entitled to an equitable lien." 
"[A] claim for unjust enrichment requires only that a 
plaintiff prove that he or she conferred a benefit upon the 
opposing party and that the retention of that benefit would be 
unjust." Durette v. Aloha Plastic Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawai#i 
490, 504, 100 P.3d 60, 74 (2004) (cleaned up). 
"Where property 
of one person can by a proceeding in equity be reached by another 
as security for a claim on the ground that otherwise the former 
would be unjustly enriched, an equitable lien arises." Small v. 
Badenhop, 67 Hawai#i 626, 639, 701 P.2d 647, 656 (1985) (quoting 
Restatement of Restitution ยง 161). "Under the [d]octrine of 
[e]quitable [s]ubrogation, one who advances money to pay off an 
encumbrance with the express understanding that it is to be 
secured by a first lien on the property will be subrogated to the 
rights of the prior encumbrancer in the event that the new 
security is for any reason not a valid first lien on the property 
(unless superior or equal equities will be prejudiced)." 
Beneficial Haw., Inc. v. Kida
, 96 Hawai#i 289, 313, 30 P.3d 895, 
919 (2001). 
Here, HSBC offered Fidelity National Title Insurance 
Company's escrow settlement statement showing the loan amount 
deposited by Fremont and escrow's payments to the Freepartners' 
former mortgagees. HSBC thus showed that Fremont was entitled to 
an equitable lien on the Property. But HSBC did not show it 
advanced money to or for the Freepartners. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HSBC offered the assignment of the mortgage and note 
from Fremont to HSBC, but "[a]n equitable lien is a claim for 
payment secured by real property not as a result of any agreement 
between the parties but because of the application of principles 
of equity and fairness." In re 2003 & 2007 Ala Wai Blvd., 85 
Hawai#i 398, 412, 944 P.2d 1341, 1355 (App. 1997) (citing Small, 
67 Hawai#i at 639, 701 P.2d at 656) (emphasis added), overruled 
on other grounds, Knauer v. Foote, 101 Hawai#i 81, 85, 63 P.3d 
389, 393 (2003). 
HSBC did not sustain its burden as the summary judgment 
movant to show it was entitled to an equitable lien against the 
Property. The circuit court thus erred by granting HSBC's motion 
for partial summary judgment. We need not address the 
Freepartners' challenges to the circuit court's FOFs or COLs.
(2) HSBC didn't have to prove it had possession of the 
note when it filed the original complaint because the complaint 
sought ejectment, not foreclosure. HSBC alleged it owned the 
Property and attached the quitclaim deed to its complaint. That 
showed it had standing to seek ejectment.
(3) The exhibits to HSBC'S motion for partial summary 
judgment were admissible because paragraph 4 of Kevin Flannigan's 
declaration showed circumstances indicating the trustworthiness 
of the documents PHH incorporated from Ocwen. 
See U.S. Bank Tr., 
N.A. v. Verhagen, 149 Hawai#i 315, 326, 489 P.3d 419, 430 (2021). 
We vacate the February 22, 2023 Judgment and remand to 
the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this 
summary disposition order.
