Upon review of the record, it appears that:

 On March 22, 2023, self-represented Plaintiff-
Appellant Michelle Roebuck (Roebuck) filed a Notice of Appeal and did not pay the filing fee; 
(2) The record on appeal was due on or before May 22, 
2023, see
 Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
11(b)(1), but was not filed because Roebuck failed to pay the filing fee or obtain a fee waiver.

24; 
(3) On June 5, 2023, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Roebuck that the time to docket the appeal had expired, Roebuck had not paid the filing fee or obtained an order allowing Roebuck to proceed on appeal 
in 
forma pauperis, the matter would be brought to the court's attention on June 15, 2023, for action that may include dismissal of the appeal, and Roebuck could seek relief from default by motion; NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(4) On August 7, 2023, the court ordered Roebuck to 
show cause within ten days why the appeal should not be dismissed 
for failure to pay the filing fee or obtain a fee waiver, which resulted in no record on appeal being filed. The court cautioned Roebuck that failure to respond to the order to show cause could result in the appeal being dismissed; 
(5) Roebuck took no further action in this appeal; and (6) An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to proceed in forma pauperis. HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
