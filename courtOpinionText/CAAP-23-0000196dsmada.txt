appears   that  (1)  the  appeal  has  been  docketed  and  the  filing  fees

appeal  "with  the  exception  of  U.S.  BANK's  attorney's  fees  and 
costs  to  be  added  to  the  subject  loan  balance  as  permitted  under 
the  subject  note  and  mortgage";  (3)  the  Stipulation  is  dated  and 
signed  by  counsel  for  all  parties  appearing  in  the  appeal;  and

approved  and  the  appeal  is  dismissed  with  prejudice,  under  HRAP 
Rule  42(b).   The  parties  shall  bear  their  own  attorneys'  fees  and

fees  and  costs  to  be  added  to  the  subject  loan  balance  as 
permitted  under  the  subject  note  and  mortgage."
