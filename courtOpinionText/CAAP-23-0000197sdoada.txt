Saffeels raises two points of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court erred in denying his October 3, 
2022 motion to dismiss the charges (Motion to Dismiss) for 
failure to commence trial within 180 days of the indictment, in 
violation of his right to a speedy trial under (1) Hawai# i Rules 
of Penal Procedure (
HRPP) Rule 48 and (2) the United States and 
Hawai#i Constitutions. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Saffeels's points of error as follows:. 
HRPP Rule 48(b) provides: 
(b) By court
. Except in the case of traffic
offenses that are not punishable by imprisonment, the court
shall, on motion of the defendant, dismiss the charge, withor without prejudice in its discretion, if trial is not
commenced within 6 months[.] 
"HRPP Rule 48 is intended to ensure an accused a speedy 
trial, which is separate and distinct from [the] constitutional 
protection to a speedy trial." State v. Fukuoka
, 141 Hawai#i 48, 
55, 404 P.3d 314, 321 (2017) (citation & quotation marks omitted). "The six-month period under HRPP Rule 48 is equivalent to 180 days." 
State v. Hernane
, 145 Hawai#i 444, 450, 454 P.3d 
385, 391 (2019). HRPP Rule 48(c) identifies certain periods of delay that are not chargeable against Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai#i (State), and which "shall be excluded in computing the 
time for trial commencement." 
Though Saffeels was indicted on June 8, 2020, it is 
undisputed that he consistently waived his right to a speedy 
2  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
trial until December 20, 2021, while pursuing plea negotiations. 
The parties dispute, among other things, whether each of the subsequent trial delays are "excluded" from the 180-day calculation under HRPP Rule 48, or are chargeable to the State. In particular, the parties dispute whether a State-requested trial continuance from March 30, 2022, to August 29, 2022, granted over Saffeels's objection, and based on the unavailability of a witness who was a minor (Minor Witness), is 
excluded. The parties also disagree whether the length of that 
particular trial delay should be measured starting on the date the continuance was granted, which would amount to 158 days, or on the date the trial was originally scheduled, which would amount to 152 days. Nonetheless, it appears the parties otherwise agree that a minimum of 109 other days are chargeable to the State. Thus, whether the length of the particular 
continuance for the Minor Witness is 152 or 158 days, if it is 
also chargeable to the State, the total chargeable days would necessarily exceed 180. 
HRPP Rule 48(c)(4)(i) excludes from computation delays 
caused by the State's continuance due to the unavailability of material evidence, under specific circumstances, as follows: 
(c) Excluded periods.  The following periods
shall be excluded in computing the time for trial
commencement: 
. . . . 
(4)
 periods that delay the commencement of trial
and are caused by a continuance granted at the request
of the prosecutor if : 
(i) the continuance is granted because of the
unavailability of evidence material  to the 
prosecution's case, when the prosecutor has exercised
due diligence to obtain such evidence  and there are 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reasonable grounds to believe that such evidence will
be available at a later date[.] 
(Emphasis added). 
The use of the conjunctive "and" in subsection 
(c)(4)(i) indicates the elements of due diligence and reasonable 
belief as to subsequent availability must both be satisfied. See 
State v. Crouser
, 81 Hawai#i 5, 11, 911 P.2d 725, 731 (1996) 
(holding that, where the elements of a statute are "set out in the conjunctive, rather than the disjunctive," the other side need only disprove one element to defeat it). 
It appears that the Minor Witness is the son of a woman 
Saffeels lived with while the case was pending, and that he was present, though perhaps not awake, at the time the incident took place. 
At the March 24, 2022 hearing where the State requested 
the continuance, Saffeels indicated that the Minor Witness had been sent to live with his brother in Texas three weeks prior, due to issues at school, and he would return to O# ahu in August 
of that year. Thus, there were reasonable grounds to believe the Minor Witness could testify at a later date, which satisfies the element of subsequent availability. However, at the October 27, 2022 hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, the Circuit Court indicated that the State failed to "exercise due diligence" in procuring the Minor Witness's testimony, as it admitted to having "rushed" a separate subpoena for the Minor Witness just one week before scheduled trial—and only after it realized the subpoena did not previously "go out with the rest of" the trial subpoenas a month prior—and the circumstances did "not excuse" the State's failure to "get the subpoena out earlier." Moreover, it appears 
4  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the State did not end up calling Minor Witness to testify at the 
subsequent trial.  Thus, it is dubious, at best, whether the 
delay was due to the "unavailability of evidence material to the prosecution's case," to satisfy the elements for exclusion in 
HRPP Rule 48(c)(4)(i). (Emphasis added). 
We thus conclude that the delay caused by the State's 
continuance to secure the testimony of Minor Witness should be charged to the State, and that at least 180 days chargeable to the State had elapsed at the time Saffeels moved for dismissal. Therefore, the Circuit Court erred in denying the Motion to Dismiss. In light of this conclusion, we need not reach any of the parties' other arguments, nor do we reach Saffeels's second point of error, that the State violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial. Rees v. Carlisle
, 113 Hawai#i 446, 456, 153 
P.3d 1131, 1141 (2007) ("[J]udicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them."). 
As to whether Saffeels is entitled to a dismissal of 
the charges with or without prejudice, this determination should be made by the Circuit Court in the first instance. See State v. 
Choy Foo
, 142 Hawai#i 65, 70, 414 P.3d 117, 122 (2018); 
State v. 
Liu, CAAP-13-0001580, 2016 WL 3063668 (Haw. App. May 27, 2016) (SDO). 
Therefore, the Circuit Court's February 28, 2023 
Judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for entry of an order of dismissal, with or without prejudice, in the Circuit 
5

Court's discretion, after considering the factors established in 
State v. Estencion, 63 Haw. 264, 625 P.2d 1040 (1981). 
It is also hereby ordered that Saffeels's Motion for 
Release Pending Appeal filed on July 2, 2023 is dismissed as moot.

It is further ordered that all pending motions are 
denied as moot.
