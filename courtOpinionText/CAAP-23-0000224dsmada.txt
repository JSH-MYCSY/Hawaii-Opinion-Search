IN   THE   INTERMEDIATE    COURT   OF   APPEALS  
OF   THE   STATE   OF   HAWAI  I  
STATE   OF   HAWAI  I,   Plaintiff-Appellee,   v.  
JONATHAN   P.   SPIES,   Defendant-Appellant  
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Guidry, JJ.) 
Upon   review   of   the   record,   it   appears   that   self-
represented   Defendant-Appellant   Jonathan   P.   Spies   (Spies)   appeals  
from   the   March   28,   2023   "Order   Denying   (1)   Defendant's   Notice   of  
Protest,   Opposition   of   the   Taking   of   Personal   and   Subject   Matter  
Jurisdiction;   (2)   Defense   Counsel   Motion   to   Withdraw   for   Limited  
Purposes   of   Motion   Filed   March   6,   2023   [Dkt.   186]"   (March   28,  
2023   Order).    We   conclude   that   the   court   lacks   jurisdiction   over  
the   appeal   because   the   March   28,   2023   Order   is   not   an   order   or  
judgment   that   finally   determines,   and   thus   ends,   all   proceedings  
leaving   nothing   further   to   be   accomplished,   Hawaii   Revised  
Statutes   (HRS)   §   641-11   (2016),   State   v.   Nicol,   140   Hawai  i   482,  
492,   403   P.3d   259,   269   (2017),    it   has   not   been   certified    for  
interlocutory    appeal,    see   HRS   §   641–17   (2016),    and   it   is   not   an

355,
 884 P.2d 729, 7331–32 (1994) (citation omitted). 
Therefore,   IT    IS   HEREBY   ORDERED   that   the   appeal   is  
dismissed.  1  
IT   IS   FURTHER   ORDERED   that   all   pending   motions   are  
dismissed   as   moot.  
DATED:    Honolulu,    Hawai  i,   November   24,   2023.
