APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CPC-22-0000373) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Nakasone, Chief Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant/Cross-Appellee State of Hawai‘i 
(State) appealed from the March 1, 2023 "Findings of Fact 
[(FOFs)], Conclusions of Law [(COLs),] and Order Granting in 
Part and Denying in Part [Defendant-Appellee/Cross-Appellant 
Keola Cabos' (Cabos)] First Motion to Dismiss Indictment, Filed 
on September 30, 2022" (First Order) entered by the Circuit   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  
 
   
 Court of the Second Circuit (circuit court).1 Cabos cross-
appealed from the circuit court's March 1, 2023 "[FOFs], [COLs,] 
and Order Denying [Cabos'] Second Motion to Dismiss Indictment 
Filed on September 30, 2022" (Second Order). 
On May 16, 2022, the State charged Cabos by Indictment 
with two counts of Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the First 
Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 712-
1241(1)(b)(ii)(A), (1)(b)(i) (2014 & Supp. 2016). Cabos pleaded not guilty, and, on September 30, 2022, Cabos filed two motions 
to dismiss the Indictment. On March 1, 2023, the circuit court 
entered the First Order, granting Cabos' first motion to dismiss 
on the basis that the State's failure to include the definition 
of "continuing course of conduct" in the Indictment violated 
Cabos' right to due process under article I, section 14 of the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution.  The First Order dismissed the Indictment 
without prejudice. On the same day, the circuit court also 
entered the Second Order, denying Cabos' second motion to 
dismiss, and rejecting Cabos' contention that the use of hearsay 
by the State during the grand jury proceedings was prejudicial to Cabos. 
The State contends on appeal that the circuit court 
erred in granting in part Cabos' first motion to dismiss, and,

 relatedly, that FOFs 9 and 102 are clearly erroneous, and COLs 11 
and 123 are wrong. Cabos contends on cross-appeal that the 
circuit court erred in denying Cabos' second motion to dismiss. 
Upon careful review of the record, briefs, and 
relevant legal authorities, and having given due consideration 
to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, 
we resolve the State and Cabos' points of error as follows: 
(1) The State contends that the circuit court erred in 
dismissing the Indictment, without prejudice, because "Cabos was adequately informed of the nature of the charges against him." 
(Formatting altered.) Cabos contends his constitutional right 
to due process was violated because "continuing course of 
conduct" was not defined in the Indictment. 
2 FOFs 9 and 10 state, 
9. The State did not provide to the grand jury a 
definition of what standard that they are to use to 
determine an aggregate weight. 
10. The State did not specify in the Indictment what it meant by "continuing course of conduct." 
3 COLs 11 and 12 state, 
11. In the context of this case, the failure of the 
Indictment to set forth the definition of the term 
"continuing course of conduct" violated Cabos's 
constitutional right to due process under article I, 
section 14 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution. [State v.] 
Jardine, 151 Hawaiʻ i [96,] 100, 508 P.2d [1182,] 1186 
[2022]. 
12. Within the context of this case, the State should 
have specified in the charging document what it means 
by continuing course of conduct.

   The purpose of a charging document is "to safeguard an 
accused's fundamental right to know what they must defend 
against to avoid conviction." State v. Van Blyenburg, 152 
Hawaiʻi 66, 74, 520 P.3d 264, 272 (2022).  Pursuant to article I, 
sections 5 and 14 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution, "charging 
documents must include the elements of an offense and 
sufficiently describe the nature and cause of the accusation." 
State v. Aquino, 154 
Hawaiʻi 388, 393, 550 P.3d 1246, 1251 (2024) 
(citation omitted). "Put differently, the sufficiency of the 
charging instrument is measured, inter alia, by whether it 
contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged, and 
sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he or she must be 
prepared to meet." Jardine, 151 Hawaiʻ i at 100, 508 P.3d at 1186 
(cleaned up). 
"Whether a charge sets forth all the essential 
elements of a charged offense is a question of law, which we 
review under the de novo, or right/wrong, standard." State v.

The Indictment charged Cabos with a continuing course 
of conduct from March 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018 under HRS § 
712-1241(1)(b):

 Count One:  . . .  
 
That on or about the period of  March 1, 2018,  through 
June 30, 2018, inclusive, in a continuing course of 
conduct, in the County of Maui, State of Hawaii, [Cabos] 
did knowingly distribute  one or more preparations, 
compounds, mixtures, or substances of an aggregate weight 
of one-eighth ounce or more, containing methamphetamine  or 
any of its salts, isomers and salts of isomers, thereby committing the offense of Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the 
First Degree in violation of Section 712- 1241(1)(b)(ii)(A) 
of the [HRS].  
. . . . 
Count Two:  . . .   
 
That on or about the period of  March 1, 2018,  through 
June 30, 2018, inclusive, in a continuing course of 
conduct, in the County of Maui, State of Hawaii, [Cabos]  
did knowingly distribute twenty- five (25) or more capsules, 
tablets, ampules, dosage units, or syrettes  containing  one 
or more dangerous drugs, to wit, oxycodone, thereby 
committing the offense of Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the 
First Degree in violation of Section 712- 1241(1)(b)(i) of 
the [HRS].  
(Emphasis added.)   At the time Cabos was indicted, HRS § 712-
1241(1)(b) stated, in relevant part,  
(1) A person commits the offense of promoting a dangerous 
drug in the first degree if the person knowingly: 
 . . . . 
(b) Distributes: (i) Twenty-five or more capsules, tablets, 
ampules, dosage units, or syrettes 
containing one or more dangerous drugs ; 
or 
(ii) One or more preparations, compounds, 
mixtures, or substances of an aggregate 
weight of: 
(A) One-eighth ounce or more, 
containing methamphetamine, heroin, 
morphine, or cocaine or any of 
their respective salts, isomers, 
and salts of isomers[.] 
(Emphasis added.) 
5   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 When comparing the charged language in the Indictment 
to the statutory language of HRS § 712-1241(b), the Indictment 
contains all elements of the charged offense. 
As to the specific term "continuing course of 
conduct," this term is not defined by statute or case law. 
Cabos thus maintains that the State was required to include in 
the Indictment the definition of "continuing conduct" set forth 
by the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court in State v. Decoite, 132 Hawaiʻ i 
436, 438, 323 P.3d 80, 82 (2014). 
In State v. Shaw, the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court held a 
third-degree Computer Fraud indictment insufficient for not 
containing language that the defendant possessed the intent to 
commit third-degree theft "through a continuing course of 
conduct over the four-month period" set forth in the indictment. 
150 
Hawaiʻi 56, 63 -64, 497 P.3d 71, 78-79 (2021).  Because "the 
State aggregated the theft amounts from separate victims to 
reach the $250.00 threshold" for third-degree theft, the State 
was required to prove "multiple thefts committed pursuant to a common scheme or course of conduct because none of the 
individual thefts met the $250.00 statutory threshold." Id.
The court held that "[an] indictment must allege that the defendant acted pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct" when 
the offense alleged is "based on an aggregation theory because 
scheme or course of conduct is an attendant circumstances 
6   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 element that the State must prove." Id.The Shaw court did not 
state that any language beyond the attendant circumstances 
element of "continuing course of conduct" was required in an 
indictment where an aggregation theory is utilized. 
It appears that the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court has used the 
term "continuing course of conduct" synonymously with 
"continuing conduct" and "continuous offense." 
"Continuous 
offense" is defined in Decoite
 as "a continuous, unlawful act or 
series of acts set on foot by a single impulse and operated by 
an unintermittent force, however long a time it may occupy." 
Decoite, 132 Hawaiʻ i at 438, 323 P.3d at 82 (cleaned up).  We are 
unaware, however, of any case law that requires the charging 
document to provide the common law definition of "continuous 
offense" in a criminal indictment charging a "continuing course of conduct." 
Thus, the failure to include a definition for 
"continuing course of conduct," "continuing conduct," or 
"continuous offense" did not render the Indictment insufficient. 
Moreover, this court may "consider other information 
in addition to the charge that may have been provided to the 
defendant during the course of the case up until the time [the] 
defendant objected to the sufficiency of the charges against 
him." Wheeler, 121 Hawai‘i at 396, 219 P.3d at 1183.

        The record reflects that the parties stipulated into 
evidence the Maui Police Department "Incident/Investigation 
Report" (Report), which specified the dates and quantity of 
drugs for each alleged transaction.4 For the methamphetamine 
charge, the Report detailed three buys: 
• March 29, 2018 - 0.60 grams 
• April 27, 2018 - 3.10 grams 
• June 15, 2018 - 2.65 grams5 
For the oxycodone charge, the Report detailed five buys: 
• March 23, 2018 - 15 Oxycodone 30 mg pills 
• March 29, 2018 - 14 Oxycodone 30 mg pills 
• April 24, 2018 - 15 Oxycodone 30 mg pills 
• April 27, 2018 - 15 Oxycodone 30 mg pills 
• June 15, 2018 - 8 Oxycodone 30 mg pills 
Because any one transaction did not consist of the 
requisite amount of drugs under HRS § 712-1241(1)(b), the State 
needed to aggregate multiple transactions in order to reach the 
4 The Report identified five "controlled buys" that allegedly 
occurred between March 23, 2018 and June 15, 2018, and specified the dosage 
units of Oxycodone and the weight of methamphetamine that Cabos allegedly 
distributed. Cabos does not challenge the circuit court's finding that "a 
copy of the [ Report] . . . had been provided to Cabos by the State," nor does 
he contend that the State failed to provide this discovery prior to his 
sufficiency challenge. 
5 HRS § 712- 1241(1)(b)(ii)(A) criminalizes knowingly distributing 
"[o]ne-eighth ounce or more, containing methamphetamine." One ounce equals 
28.35 grams. See State v. Mattiello
, 90 Hawaiʻi 255, 257- 58, 978 P.2d 693, 
695-96 (1999); 
State v. Wallace
, 80 Hawaiʻi 382, 407, 910 P.2d 695, 720 
(1996).

 threshold amounts for Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the First 
Degree (25 or more tablets of Oxycodone or 1/8 ounce or more of 
crystal methamphetamine). And when reading the Indictment in 
conjunction with the Report, Cabos did have fair notice of the 
charges he faced, where the Indictment alleged each count as 
occurring "in a continuing course of conduct" within the date 
range corresponding to the dates in the Report. 
We thus conclude the charging document adequately 
informed Cabos "of the nature and cause of the charge and each 
element." Aquino
, 154 Hawaiʻi at 393, 550 P.3d at 1251 (cleaned 
up). The Indictment was sufficient, the circuit court's FOFs 9 
and 10 were clearly erroneous, and the circuit court's COLs 11 and 12 were wrong. We therefore vacate the circuit court's 
First Order. 
(2)
 We lack jurisdiction over Cabos' cross-appeal, 
which is taken from the circuit court's Second Order denying 
Cabos' second motion to dismiss the Indictment. Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 4.1(a)(1) provides that "[i]f a timely 
notice of appeal is filed by a party, any other party may, if 
allowed by law, file a cross appeal." A criminal defendant may 
only appeal from a circuit court's judgment of conviction 
pursuant to HRS § 641-11 (2016), a certified interlocutory order 
pursuant to HRS § 641-17 (2016), or from an appealable order pursuant to the collateral order doctrine. 
See State v.

 Kealaiki, 95 Hawaiʻ i 309, 312, 316-17, 22 P.3d 588, 591, 595-96 
(2001) (cleaned up). 
Here, the circuit court has not entered a judgment of 
conviction, nor has it entered an order certifying Cabos' 
interlocutory appeal. Moreover, Cabos' cross-appeal from the 
circuit court's order denying his second motion to dismiss is 
not an appealable collateral order. See State v. Johnson, 96 
Hawaiʻi 462, 470 n.12, 32 P.3d 106, 114 n.12 (App. 2001) 
("Generally, the collateral order exception is applicable in 
criminal cases only upon a denial of pretrial motions to reduce 
bail, motions to dismiss based on double jeopardy grounds, and 
motions to dismiss under the Speech and Debate Clause."). 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the circuit 
court's First Order, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order.
