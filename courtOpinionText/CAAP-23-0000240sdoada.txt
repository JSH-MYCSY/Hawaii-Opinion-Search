SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Nakasone, JJ.) 
D.B. appeals from the orders of commitment entered by 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit on February 28, 2023.  We 
affirm both orders. 1
On January 13, 2016, D.B. was charged by felony 
information with Assault in the Second Degree, in violation of 
1 The Honorable Christine E. Kuriyama presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 707-711(1)(a) and/or (b) 
and/or (d). On May 12, 2016, the circuit court found him unfit 
to proceed. Proceedings were suspended and he was committed to the Hawai #i State Hospital "for detention, care, and treatment 
for so long as such unfitness shall endure." D.B. was also found unfit to proceed on May 17, 2018, April 22, 2019, September 1, 2020, and September 14, 2022. The circuit court entered orders authorizing treatment over D.B.'s objection on October 10, 2018, March 3, 2020, and September 15, 2021. 
On February 28, 2023, the circuit court found that D.B. 
was: "(1) unfit to proceed and will probably remain unfit to proceed; (2) mentally ill; (3) imminently dangerous to self and others; and (4) in need of care and treatment and there is no suitable alternative available through existing facilities and programs which would be less restrictive than hospitalization." The criminal case was dismissed under HRS § 704-406(7)(b), and D.B. was committed to the custody of the Director of Health for placement in an appropriate institution for detention, care, and treatment. 
On May 24, 2019, D.B. was charged by felony information 
with Assault in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-711(1)(g), for allegedly assaulting a Hawai #i State Hospital 
employee. The circuit court found him unfit to proceed on October 1, 2019, September 1, 2020, and September 13, 2022. The circuit court entered orders authorizing treatment over D.B.'s objection on March 3, 2020, and September 3, 2021. 
On February 28, 2023, the circuit court found that D.B. 
was: "(1) unfit to proceed and will probably remain unfit to proceed; (2) mentally ill; (3) imminently dangerous to self and others; and (4) in need of care and treatment and there is no suitable alternative available through existing facilities and programs which would be less restrictive than hospitalization." The criminal case was dismissed under HRS § 704-406(7)(b), and D.B. was committed to the custody of the Director of Health for placement in an appropriate institution for care and treatment. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
D.B. appealed from both orders of commitment.  We 
consolidated the appeals. 2
D.B. was initially committed to the Hawai #i State 
Hospital under HRS § 704-406(1). 
HRS § 704-406(7) (Supp. 2016) 
provides, in relevant part: 
(7) . . . Within a reasonable time following any
. . . commitment under subsection (1), the director of
health shall report to the court on whether the defendantpresents a substantial likelihood of becoming fit to proceedin the future. The court, in addition, may appoint a panelof three qualified examiners in felony cases . . . to make areport. If, following the report, the court determines thatthe defendant probably will remain unfit to proceed, thecourt may dismiss the charge and: 
. . . . 
(b) Subject to section 334-60.2 regardinginvoluntary hospitalization criteria, order thedefendant to be committed to the custody of thedirector of health to be placed in anappropriate institution for detention, care, andtreatment. 
HRS § 334-60.2 (Supp. 2016) provides: 
Involuntary hospitalization criteria . A person may be
committed to a psychiatric facility for involuntaryhospitalization, if the court finds: 
(1) That the person is mentally ill or sufferingfrom substance abuse; 
(2) That the person is imminently dangerous to selfor others; and 
(3) That the person is in need of care or treatment,or both, and there is no suitable alternativeavailable through existing facilities andprograms which would be less restrictive thanhospitalization. 
D.B. does not contest the first criterion — that he is 
mentally ill. But he argues that the circuit court erred by 
finding he was imminently dangerous to himself or others, and that there was no suitable alternative available through existing facilities and programs that would be less restrictive than 
2 D.B. does not challenge the circuit court's determinations that he
was unfit to proceed in his criminal cases.

hospitalization. Those criteria must be established by "clear 
and convincing evidence[.]" HRS § 334-60.5(j) (2022); In re JK , 
149 Hawaii # 400, 404, 491 P.3d 1179, 1183 (App. 2021). 
"Clear and convincing evidence" is: 
an intermediate standard of proof greater than a
preponderance of the evidence, but less than proof beyond areasonable doubt required in criminal cases. It is that degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trierof fact a firm belief or conviction as to the allegationssought to be established, and requires the existence of afact be highly probable. 
In re JK , 149 Hawai #i at 409, 491 P.3d at 1188 (quoting Masaki v. 
Gen. Motors Corp. , 71 Haw. 1, 15, 780 P.2d 566, 574 (1989)). 
When we review whether a fact has been proved by clear 
and convincing evidence, we look to see whether the record 
contains substantial evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could have found it highly probable that the fact was true. In 
re JK, 149 Hawai #i at 409, 491 P.3d at 1188. We must view the 
record in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below and give deference to how the trier of fact may have evaluated the credibility of witnesses, resolved conflicts in the evidence, and drawn reasonable inferences from the evidence. Id. at 409-
10, 491 P.3d at 1188-89. We do not reweigh the evidence; we must accept the factfinder's resolution of conflicting evidence, and we may not evaluate witness credibility. Id. at 410, 491 P.3d at 1189. The question is not whether we find the evidence clear and convincing; it is whether a reasonable trier of fact could have regarded the evidence as satisfying that standard of proof. Id. 
(1) The circuit court found that D.B. was imminently 
dangerous to himself or others based primarily on reports written by Nikita Hay, Psy.D., Duke E. Wagner, Ph.D., and Martin Blinder, 
M.D. D.B. argues that Dr. Blinder opined he wasn't dangerous. Dr. Blinder examined D.B. on February 8, 2023. Six days later, D.B. assaulted another 
Hawai#i State Hospital patient, and had to 
be placed in mechanical restraints. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Dr. Hay (a psychologist with the state Department of 
Health) reported the assault, which happened the day she examined 
D.B. She opined that D.B. presented a high risk of harm to others, himself, and property, and was likely to be physically violent toward others if discharged into the community, with or without treatment services. 
Dr. Wagner noted that D.B. regularly showed poor 
judgment and threatening and aggressive behavior, seemed to have little respect for normative behavior within a social context, violated the boundaries of others, and wasn't capable of self-managing his medication or overall treatment needs. Dr. Wagner opined that D.B.'s risk of danger to himself, others, and property would increase to high if he was released into the community. 
Both Dr. Hay and Dr. Wagner recommended that D.B. 
continue to be committed to the Hawai #i State Hospital. The 
circuit court also took judicial notice of the record in both of D.B.'s cases. The records include many reports from D.B.'s examiners and care providers including Jane Caplan, M.D., Aubrey Pat Chambers, M.D., Arif Husain, M.D., Barrett Levine, M.D., Kenneth Luke, M.D., Khalid Memon, M.D., Rhodelynn Ramos, M.D., Richard Rovin, M.D., Elena Sharipova, M.D., and Melissa Vargo, Psy.D. The records also contain the orders authorizing treatment over D.B.'s objection. This was all substantial evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could have found it highly probable that D.B. was imminently dangerous to himself and others. 
(2) 
D.B. did not argue about alternatives to continued 
hospitalization during the circuit court hearing. 
He argues we 
should recognize plain error. But he stated to the circuit court that he did not contest Dr. Hay's and Dr. Wagner's reports, which recommended continued commitment to the 
Hawai#i State Hospital. 
Under these circumstances, we decline to recognize plain error. 
See In re JK , 149 Hawai#i at 406-07, 491 P.3d at 1185-86 (noting 
that plain error will not be recognized if consideration of the 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
issue not raised requires additional facts, or its resolution 
will affect the integrity of the trial court's findings of fact). 
For these reasons, the "Order[s] of Dismissal and 
Commitment" entered by the circuit court on February 28, 2023, are affirmed.
