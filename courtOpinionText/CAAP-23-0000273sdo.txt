  SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Nakasone, Chief Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.) 
These consolidated appeals arise out of the wind up of 
the Atherton Richards Trust (Trust). The Trust's primary asset 
is Kahua Ranch, Ltd. (Ranch). The four sibling beneficiaries are Petitioner/Respondent/Claimant-Appellant/Appellee Herbert M. 
Richards, III (Herbert), Respondent/Petitioner/Claimant-
Appellant/Appellee Patricia K. Richards (Patricia), Respondent-
Appellee John A. Richards (John), and Respondent-Appellee Pamela 
Richards Ketchum (Pamela) (collectively, the beneficiaries). 
The beneficiaries have a contentious relationship. 
The beneficiaries retained Successor Trustee/ 
Petitioner/Respondent-Appellee/Appellant Riki May Amano (Amano). 
In the "First Term Sheet for Agreement and Plan of Reorganization" (First Term Sheet), the beneficiaries agreed 
that Amano would reorganize the Trust assets into two separate 
corporations, and then distribute the stock of the separate 
corporations to the shareholders free of capital gains taxes on 
the assets. Pursuant to this agreement, the Ranch would 
essentially be divided into two separate ranches, with ownership 
of one ranch to be conveyed to Herbert and Patricia, and ownership of the other ranch to be conveyed to John and Pamela. 
Amano obtained a Private Letter Ruling from the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) regarding I.R.C. § 355 (West), approving the 
2   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
   
 
  
  
 proposed corporate division as part of the anticipated Trust 
division. 
It appears that the wind up of the Trust is not yet 
complete. The beneficiaries disagree on various issues, and, 
pursuant to the terms of the First Term Sheet, must resolve such 
disputes through binding arbitration. 
Amano filed her October 2022 "Petition for Approval of 
(1) Final Accounts from January 1, 2022 Through September 30, 2022, (2) Authorization to File a Supplemental Accounting 
Through Date of Discharge Without Further Court Hearing[,] (3) 
Payment of Trustee's Termination Fee, (4) Payment of Attorneys' 
Fees and Costs, (5) Issuance of an Order Compelling 
Beneficiaries to Fund Trust or Alternatively for Authorization 
to Sell Trust Assets and/or Distribute Trust Assets[,] and (6) 
Discharge and Release of Trustee" (
Approval Petition), with the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit in case no. 1TR141000145 (probate court).  The Approval Petition sought, inter alia, 
$1,095,727.23 in trustee compensation for Amano's thirty-three 
months of trustee work, and $646,276.70 in attorneys' fees and 
costs for work done to wind up the Trust and for participating 
in the various arbitrations.1

Trustee; Amano withdrew this request.

 On December 28, 2022, the day before the probate court 
heard the Approval Petition, Herbert and Patricia filed 
"Beneficiaries [Patricia] and [Herbert's] Petition for Surcharge 
Against Trustee [Amano]" (Surcharge Petition), alleging that 
Amano breached her trust duties. The Surcharge Petition 
claimed, among other things, that Amano committed IRS 
malfeasance, engaged in conflicts of interest, breached her 
fiduciary duties, and failed to maintain Trust assets. The Surcharge Petition sought, inter alia, damages, attorneys' fees, 
and costs against Amano. 
In March 2023, the probate court filed its "Order 
Granting in Part and Denying in Part [Approval Petition], Filed 
October 24, 2022" (Approval Order) and "Judgment on [Approval 
Order]" (Approval Judgment) in case no. 1TR141000145. Relevant 
here, the Approval Order granted Amano's requested trustee 
compensation and partially granted her attorneys' fees and 
costs.
3 In so doing, the probate court determined that it was 
3 The Approval Order stated, in relevant part, 
3. [Amano's] compensation as Successor Trustee for services 
rendered during the accounting period of January 1, 2020 
through September 31 [sic], 2022 is approved.  
 . . . . 
b. The [probate court] determines that the rate of $750 per 
hour for compensation as Successor Trustee pursuant to 
the Stipulation and Order Appointing [Amano] as Successor Trustee of the [Trust], filed on August 27, 
2018, is binding on all parties. 
4   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 "not necessary to wait for the outcome of the pending Surcharge 
Petition(s)" because "[i]f the [probate court] subsequently 
determine[d] that it is appropriate to surcharge [Amano] for 
actions taken as Successor Trustee, [Amano] may be ordered to 
return any improper compensation back to the Trust." Herbert 
and Patricia appealed from the Approval Order and Approval 
Judgment, creating CAAP-23-0000273. 
The probate court separately addressed the Surcharge 
Petition. In a March 2023 minute order, the probate court: (1) found the Surcharge Petition to be a contested matter and 
retained the matter under 
Hawaiʻi Probate Rules (HPR) Rule 20; 
(2) ordered the arbitration of Counts 1 (IRS Malfeasance), 3 
(Delay of Trust Wind Up Based on Partiality Against Herbert and 
Patricia and Desire to Increase Amano's Own Fees), 4 (Creating 
Tax Liability), 5 (Failure to Return Funds Ordered by 
Arbitrator), and 21 (Breach of the First Term Sheet); and (3) 
denied Herbert and Patricia's remaining claims without 
prejudice.   The probate court stayed the probate proceedings 
until the resolution of arbitration on the above claims. 
In August 2023, the arbitrator entered its "Final 
Decision and Award on Arbitration Demands 5 and 6"4 (Arbitration 
Award). The Arbitration Award found, inter alia, that Amano 
4 Arbitration Demand 6 concerned the five claims referred for 
arbitration by the probate court. 
5   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
   breached her trust duties, and that John and Pamela violated 
their duty of good faith and fair dealing. The arbitrator 
ordered Amano to reimburse the Trust $321,912.60, and John and 
Pamela to pay Herbert and Patricia $263,286.48 in damages. 
Herbert and Patricia filed a "Motion to Confirm [the] 
Arbitration Award" in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit in 
case no. 1CSP-23-0000978 (circuit court).5 The circuit court 
heard the motion, and entered the "Order Granting Motion to 
Confirm Arbitration Award, Filed on October 27, 2023 (DKT. 1)" 
(Arbitration Order) and "Final Judgment on Arbitration Award" 
(Arbitration Judgment). Amano appealed the Arbitration Order 
and Arbitration Judgment, creating CAAP-24-0000075. 
In March 2024, Herbert and Patricia moved for 
reconsideration of the Approval Order in case no. 1TR141000145,6 
citing the Arbitration Award as "new evidence." The probate court entered its "Order Denying Petition for Reconsideration 
[of the Approval Order]" (Order Denying Reconsideration). Herbert and Patricia appealed the Order Denying Reconsideration, 
creating CAAP-24-0000603. 
Herbert and Patricia raise seven points of error on 
appeal in case nos. CAAP-23-0000273 and CAAP-24-0000603, 
5 The Honorable Lisa W. Cataldo presided. 
6 The Honorable James S. Kawashima presided over Herbert and 
Patricia's motion for reconsideration in case no. 1TR141000145. 
6   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  contending that the probate court erred in: (1) "approv[ing] 
[Amano's] compensation when there was a pending [Surcharge 
Petition]"; (2) "declin[ing] to limit [Amano's] compensation to 
the statutory rate of compensation set forth in [Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) §] 607-18[ (2016)]"; (3) "approv[ing] [Amano's] 
compensation for time spent defending against arbitrations 
[Amano] lost and unsuccessfully trying to avoid arbitration and 
overturn arbitration awards"; (4) "approv[ing] [Amano's] compensation for time that was unreasonable and/or was not for 
the sole benefit of the Trust"; (5) "grant[ing] [Amano's] 
request for attorneys' fees for participating in the 
arbitrations"; (6) "grant[ing] [Amano's] request for attorneys' 
fees and costs for time that was unreasonable"; and (7) entering 
the Order Denying Reconsideration. 
Amano raises three points of error on appeal in case 
no. CAAP-24-0000075, contending that the circuit court erred in: 
(1) "acting without subject matter jurisdiction" by "confirm[ing] and enter[ing] judgment on a non-final arbitration 
decision"; (2) "enforcing an arbitration agreement that violates 
public policy"; and (3) "refusing to vacate and remand [the 
Arbitration Award] for clarification."  
Upon careful review of the record, briefs, and 
relevant legal authorities, and having given due consideration 
7   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
    
 
   
 
 
 
 
     
   to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, 
we resolve the parties' points of error as follows: 
I. CAAP-23-0000273 and CAAP-24-0000603 (1) Herbert and Patricia contend that the probate 
court erred in "approv[ing] [Amano's] compensation without waiting for the outcome of [the Surcharge Petition]." They 
contend that the probate court could not properly evaluate the 
reasonableness of Amano's requested compensation without "tak[ing] into account the outcome of the [S]urcharge 
[P]etition."

"In an action for an accounting, a court of equity is 
called upon to determine the propriety of every entry in an 
estate's account." In re Est. of Bishop, 53 Haw. 604, 605, 499 
P.2d 670, 671 (1972). We therefore review the probate court's Approval Order for abuse of discretion. Aickin v. Ocean View
Invs. Co., 84 Hawaiʻ i 447, 453, 935 P.2d 992, 998 (1997) ("The 
relief granted by a court in equity is discretionary and will 
not be overturned on review unless the circuit court abused its 
discretion by issuing a decision that clearly exceeds the bounds 
7 Herbert and Patricia, citing In re Elaine Emma Short Revocable 
Living Trust Agreement Dated July 17, 1984
, 147 Hawaiʻi 456, 466 , 465 P.3d 
903, 913 (2020), also contend that the Approval Order cannot be affirmed 
because the probate court did not make findings of fact. In re 
Elaine Emma 
Short precludes the appellate court from conducting its own evidentiary 
analysis when the probate court has failed to issue the requisite findings to 
enable meaningful appellate review. Id. at 465, 465 P.3d at 912. We 
determine that the record in this case is sufficient to enable a meaningful appellate review without the need to conduct an evidentiary analysis. 
8   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice 
to the substantial detriment of the appellant.") (cleaned up). 
Herbert and Patricia elected to present their evidence 
of Amano's alleged malfeasance and breach of trust in support of 
their Surcharge Petition, which was filed the day before the 
hearing on the Approval Petition. They cite no case law 
supporting their argument that the probate court needed to 
concomitantly address these separately filed petitions, and they do not demonstrate that they were prejudiced by the separate 
resolutions of the two petitions. Indeed, as the probate court 
explained, "it [was] not necessary to wait for the outcome of 
the pending Surcharge Petition(s)" because "[i]f the [probate 
court] subsequently determine[d] that it [was] appropriate to 
surcharge [Amano] for actions taken as Successor Trustee, 
[Amano] may be ordered to return any improper compensation back 
to the Trust." 
On this record, we conclude that the probate court did 
not abuse its discretion in granting the Approval Petition, and in deferring the issues and arguments raised in the Surcharge 
Petition to be addressed separately. 
(2) Herbert and Patricia contend that the probate 
court erred "when it approved [Amano's] entire compensation," 
and by declining to reduce Amano's trustee compensation to the 
9   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
   
   
   statutory limit set forth in HRS § 607-18.8 (Formatting 
altered.) Here, it is undisputed that the beneficiaries 
stipulated to Amano's rate of $750/hour in trustee compensation. 
A trust instrument governs a trustee's compensation. See HRS § 
607-18(b) (2016) (instructing that "[b]anks, trust companies, and individuals who in the ordinary course of business serve as 
fiduciaries shall, when serving as trustees, be entitled to 
reasonable compensation, which may be set forth in their published fee schedules"). 
Herbert and Patricia contend that they only agreed to 
this rate in reliance on Amano's "misstatements" and "factually 
incorrect representations," and that this agreed-upon rate 
should therefore not be applied. They cite Restatement (Third) 
of Trusts § 38 cmt. f (A.L.I. 2003), which provides that an 
agreement on compensation is not binding if "the trustee failed 
to disclose all the relevant circumstances that the trustee knew 
or should have known, or if the agreement is unfair to the beneficiary." They do not, however, identify any evidence filed 
in opposition to the Approval Petition demonstrating that they 
only agreed to Amano's $750/hour rate because of Amano's 
"misstatements" and "factually incorrect representations." We 
8 HRS § 607- 18 sets forth a statutory rate of compensation that a 
trustee is entitled to, except where "the trust instrument otherwise 
provides, or the settlor and trustee otherwise agree." HRS § 607- 18 (a), (c) 
(2016).  
10   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 therefore conclude that the probate court did not err by not 
applying the above-cited Restatement provision. 
Moreover, Herbert and Patricia cite no legal authority 
supporting their contention that the probate court was required 
to reduce Amano's agreed-upon compensation because it was 
disproportionate to the statutory fee schedule set forth in HRS 
§ 607-18, to the Ranch's revenues and profits, and to trustee 
compensation awarded for work done with regard to other comparable trusts. 
The determination of whether Amano's requested fees 
should be reduced is a matter within the probate court's 
equitable discretion. We conclude that the probate court did 
not abuse its discretion here. 
(3) Herbert and Patricia contend that the probate 
court erred in approving Amano's compensation for time she spent 
"defending against arbitrations [Amano] lost and unsuccessfully 
trying to avoid arbitration and overturn arbitration awards." They primarily rely upon cases that address reimbursement for 
attorneys' fees and costs -- not trustee compensation -- and 
that are therefore distinguishable. 
Herbert and Patricia also rely on In re Estate of Ena, 
24 Haw. 414, 417 (Haw. Terr. 1918). In instructing that trustee 
compensation must be limited to work done "for the sole benefit 
of the estate," In re Estate of Ena clarifies that "[t]here must 
11   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 be no ground for just suspicion that the fiduciary in rendering 
the services was actuated by motives of personal gain rather 
than of a proper regard for the interests of the estate." Id.
Herbert and Patricia identify no evidence presented in opposition to the Approval Petition establishing that Amano was 
motivated by personal gain. 
On this record, we conclude that the probate court did 
not abuse its discretion in awarding compensation for time Amano spent defending against arbitrations. 
(4) Herbert and Patricia contend that the probate 
court erred in approving Amano's $267,958.82 compensation for 
non-trustee work. They contend that the ranch management work 
should have been delegated, the real estate and legal work was 
duplicative of work already performed by professionals, and the 
remaining work was unnecessary, unreasonable, and not for the 
sole benefit of the Trust. 
Amano had discretion as trustee to, inter alia, 
"continue the business or other enterprise and take any action that may be taken by shareholders," and "construct, or make 
ordinary or extraordinary repairs to, alterations to, or 
improvements in, buildings or other structures." HRS § 554D-
816(6), (8) (Supp. 2021). A court will not interfere unless the 
trustee, in exercising this discretion, "acts dishonestly, or 
with an improper even though not a dishonest motive, or fails to 
12   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 use his judgment, or acts beyond the bonds of a reasonable 
judgment." Dowsett v. Hawaiian Tr. Co., 47 Haw. 577, 581, 393 
P.2d 89, 93 (1964) (citation omitted). 
Herbert and Patricia identify no evidence presented in 
opposition to the Approval Petition establishing that Amano acted "dishonestly," with an "improper motive," or beyond the 
bounds of reason in carrying out her duties as trustee. We 
therefore conclude that the probate court did not abuse its discretion in approving Amano's $267,958.82 in compensation for 
non-trustee work. 
(5) Herbert and Patricia contend that the probate 
court erred in granting Amano "attorneys' fees for participating 
in the arbitrations." 
HRS § 554D-709(a)(1) (Supp. 2021), which governs 
reimbursement of a trustee's expenses, provides that, 
(a) A trustee or designated trustee who acts in good 
faith is entitled to reimbursement out of the trust 
property, with interest as appropriate, for: 
(1) Expenses that were properly incurred in the administration of the trust, including the 
defense or prosecution of any action, whether 
successful or not, unless the trustee is 
determined to have wilfully or wantonly committed 
a material breach of trust[.] 
(Emphasis added.) 
By its plain language, "the defense or prosecution of 
any action" includes arbitrations that Amano, as Successor 
Trustee, was a party to. (Emphasis added.) Herbert and 
13   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 Patricia identify no evidence presented in opposition to the 
Approval Petition demonstrating that Amano had "wilfully or 
wantonly committed a material breach of trust." We therefore 
conclude that the probate court did not abuse its discretion in 
awarding Amano attorneys' fees. 
(6) Herbert and Patricia contend that the probate 
court erred in granting Amano attorneys' fees and costs for work 
that was "unreasonable." As with point of error (5), the record reflects that Amano's fees and costs were "incurred in the 
administration of the trust," and Herbert and Patricia point to 
no evidence presented in opposition to the Approval Petition 
establishing that Amano "wilfully or wantonly committed a 
material breach of trust" in carrying out her trust duties. We 
conclude that the probate court did not abuse its discretion. 
(7) Herbert and Patricia contend that the probate 
court erred by denying reconsideration of the Approval Order. 
We review the probate court's ruling on a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki
Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 26 (1992). 
Herbert and Patricia contend that reconsideration of 
the Approval Order was warranted because the Arbitration Award 
confirmed in case no. 1CSP-23-0000978 is "newly discovered 
evidence" that "fundamentally changed the landscape" regarding 
Amano's compensation and attorneys' fees. 
14   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 HPR Rule 36(b) provides, in relevant part: 
(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly 
Discovered Evidence; Fraud, etc. Upon petition and upon 
such terms as are just, the court may relieve an interested 
person from an order or judgment for the following reasons: 
 . . . . 
(2)
 newly discovered evidence which by due diligence 
could not have been discovered in time before the order was 
issued; 
  . . . . 
(6) any other reason justifying relief from the 
operation of the order.  
Herbert and Patricia cite no legal authority to support their 
contention that the arbitrator's findings, which were confirmed 
in the separate circuit court proceeding, constituted "newly 
discovered evidence" or "any other reason justifying relief" 
pursuant to HPR Rule 36(b)(2) or (6).    9
"[T]he purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to 
allow the parties to present new evidence and/or arguments that 
could not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated 
motion." Chen v. Mah, 146 Hawaiʻ i 157, 172, 457 P.3d 796, 811 
(2020) (citation omitted). 
Here, Herbert and Patricia do not 
identify a specific error in the Approval Order; rather, they 
seek to reopen and relitigate the Approval Petition based on a judgment entered in a separate judicial proceeding. A motion 
9 In denying reconsideration of the Approval Order, the probate 
court explained that its ruling was "without prejudice to any other remedy, 
including and especially obviously the enforcement of the arbitration award 
itself." 
15   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  for reconsideration "is not a device to relitigate old matters." 
Id. (citation omitted). 
We conclude that the probate court did not abuse its 
discretion in denying Herbert and Patricia's motion for 
reconsideration. 
II. CAAP-24-0000075 
(1) Amano contends that the Arbitration Award was a 
non-final decision, and that the circuit court therefore lacked 
subject matter jurisdiction to enter the Arbitration Order. 
"Whether a circuit court possesses subject matter jurisdiction 
over a dispute relating to arbitration, including the threshold 
issue of arbitrability, is a question of law reviewable de 
novo." Mathewson v. Aloha Airlines, Inc.
, 82 Hawaiʻi 57, 69, 919 
P.2d 969, 981 (1996) (cleaned up). 
An arbitration award is subject to confirmation by the 
circuit court as a final award under HRS Chapter 658A if it is 
"intended by the arbitrator to be a complete determination of 
every issue submitted." United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, Local 646
v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 124 Hawaiʻ i 367, 371, 244 P.3d 604, 
608 (App. 2010) (citation omitted). The record reflects that 
the arbitrator resolved all issues submitted to arbitration, and 
Amano does not contend otherwise. Amano therefore fails to 
demonstrate that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to enter the Arbitration Order confirming the Arbitration Award. 
16   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
  
 
 (2) Amano contends that the circuit court erred by 
enforcing an arbitration agreement that "violate[d] public 
policy" by allowing piecemeal arbitrations. The record reflects 
that Amano did not raise this argument in the circuit court 
proceeding. The argument was therefore waived.  See Ass'n of
Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., 100 Hawaiʻ i 
97, 107, 58 P.3d 608, 618 (2002) ("Legal issues not raised in 
the trial court are ordinarily deemed waived on appeal." 
(citations omitted)). 10
(3) Amano contends that the Arbitration Award "decided 
issues [the probate court] had already decided," and the circuit 
court therefore erred by not vacating and remanding the matter to the arbitrator "for clarification."  
"Judicial review of an arbitration award is confined 
to the strictest possible limits, and a court may only vacate an 
award on the grounds specified in HRS § 658A-23 [(2016)] and 
modify or correct on the grounds specified in HRS § 658A-24[ 
(2016)]." State of Haw. Org. of Police Officers, 135 Hawaiʻ i at 
461, 353 P.3d at 1003 (cleaned up). "This standard applies to 
10 Amano identifies no controlling authority that a public policy 
objection to an arbitration award may be raised for the first time on appeal, 
and, even assuming she preserved the issue, she challenges the arbitration 
agreement, not the award itself. Cf. 
State of Haw. Org. of Police Officers 
(SHOPO) v. County of Kauaʻi, 135 Hawaiʻi 456, 465, 353 P.3d 998, 1007 (2015) 
(allowing parties to challenge arbitration awards that contravene public 
policy). 
17
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 both the circuit court and the appellate courts." Id.
(citations omitted). 
Here, Amano did not move to vacate the Arbitration 
Award. Amano instead asked the circuit court to: (1) deny the 
motion to confirm, pending instructions from the probate court; 
or (2) remand the matter to the arbitrator for clarification 
because the award was ambiguous. Amano has therefore waived any 
argument, made for the first time on appeal, that the Arbitration Award should be vacated. 
We next turn to Amano's contention that the 
Arbitration Award should be remanded to the arbitrator for 
clarification. It is undisputed that the probate court, in 
entering the Approval Order, denied Herbert and Patricia's 
request to reduce Amano's trustee compensation. The probate 
court, addressing the allegations presented in Herbert and 
Patricia's Surcharge Petition, explained that if "the [probate 
court] subsequently determine[d] that it is appropriate to surcharge [Amano] for actions taken as Successor Trustee, 
[Amano] may be ordered to return any improper compensation back 
to the Trust." The record thus reflects that there was no 
double compensation, and the arbitrator did not redecide claims 
that the probate court already decided. 
18   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 
       
 
 
  
 
 
  The record further reflects that Amano did not ask the 
circuit court to modify or correct the Arbitration Award.   
Thus, any argument that the circuit court failed to comply with 
HRS § 658A-24(a)(1) or (2) is waived. See Ass'n of Apartment
Owners of Wailea Elua, 100 Hawaiʻ i at 107, 58 P.3d at 618. 11
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Approval 
Order, Approval Judgment, and Order Denying Reconsideration 
entered by the probate court in case no. 1TR141000145, and the
