NO. CAAP-23-0000282 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I  
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JOHN CROKE, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CR. NO. 1CPC-21-0000235) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Nakasone, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Defendant-Appellant John Croke's 
(Croke) July 20, 2023 Motion to Consolidate CAAP-23-0000105 and 
CAAP-23-0000282 (Motion to Consolidate), filed in case numbers 
CAAP-23-0000105 and CAAP-23-0000282, the papers in support, and 
the record in case numbers CAAP-23-0000105 and CAAP-23-0000282, it appears that: 
(1)
 Croke seeks to consolidate the appeals in case 
numbers CAAP-23-0000105 and CAAP-23-0000282; 
(2) In case number CAAP-23-0000105, Croke appeals from 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (Circuit Court) 
February 27, 2023 minute order (Minute Order) dismissing without 
prejudice the October 26, 2022 Amended Felony Indictment in 
1CPC-21-0000235 (Amended Indictment); 
(3) On March 13, 2023, the Circuit Court reduced the 
Minute Order to a written order dismissing without prejudice the Amended Indictment (Dismissal Order). In case number CAAP-23-
0000282, Croke appeals from the Dismissal Order; 
(4) We find that the Dismissal Order is a final, 
appealable order under Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 641-11 (2016) NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and State v. Nicol, 140 Hawai# i 482, 403 P.3d 259 (2017), and 
that both appeals are from the Dismissal Order. 
The notice of 
appeal in CAAP-23-0000105, though premature, is deemed timely-
filed under Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
4(b)(4), and the notice of appeal in CAAP-23-0000282 was timely-filed under HRAP Rule 4(b)(1); and 
(5) Therefore, the appeal in case number CAAP-23
-
0000282 is duplicative and unnecessary, as the court will already review the Dismissal Order in case number CAAP-23-0000105. Accordingly, we will sua sponte dismiss the appeal in case number CAAP-23-0000282, making the requests for consolidation moot. See 
Ogeone v. Au, No. CAAP-18-0000190, 2019 WL 972542, at *1 (App. Feb. 27, 2019)(Order). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal in case 
number CAAP-23-0000282 is dismissed as unnecessary, and all pending motions in CAAP-23-0000282 are dismissed as moot. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Motion to Consolidate 
filed in CAAP-23-0000105 is denied as moot. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerk shall 
file this order in case numbers CAAP-23-0000105 and CAAP-23-0000282. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 9, 2023.
