NO. CAAP-23-0000283 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I 
HAWAIIAN RANCHOS ROAD MAINTENANCE CORPORATION,
a Hawaii corporation, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
GORDON FREDRICK SCHICK, Defendant-Appellee, and
MATHILDA NOILANI MASON, Defendant-Appellant,
and JOHN DOES 1-10; JANE DOES 1-10; DOE ENTITIES 1-10,
and DOE GOVERNMENTAL UNITS 1-10, Defendants. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CCV-22-0000298) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Chan, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that self-
represented Defendant-Appellant Mathilda Noilani Mason appeals 
from the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit's (circuit court) 
April 5, 2023 "Order Granting Entry of Default of Defendants 
Gordon Schick and Mathilda Noilani Mason Regarding Service by Publication of Summons" (Default Order), which entered default 
only as to Defendant Gordon Schick. 
The court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal because 
the circuit court has not entered a final, appealable order or 
judgment. See Hawai# i Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016); 
Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure Rules 54(b), 58; Jenkins v. 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994). Further, the Default Order is not independently appealable under the collateral-order doctrine, the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Forgay1 doctrine, or HRS ยง 641-1(b). See Greer v. Baker, 137 
Hawai#i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (setting forth the 
requirements for appealability under the collateral-order 
doctrine and the Forgay doctrine); HRS ยง 641-1(b) (specifying requirements for leave to file interlocutory appeal). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.
