APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 3CCV-22-0000250) 
ORDER 
(By: 
Nakasone, Chief Judge, Leonard and McCullen, JJ.) 
  Upon consideration of Appellant-Provider-Appellant 
Christopher Lawinski, M.D.'s ( Dr. Lawinski ) February 22, 2026 
"Motion to Supplement Record on Appeal[;] Motion for 
Reconsideration of Summary Disposition Order" ( Motion) from the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals Summary Disposition Order filed on 
February 13, 2026, pursuant to Hawai ʻi Rules of Appellate  
       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   
  
  
 
   
 
   Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 40, and the record and files herein, it 
appears that: 
(1) HRAP Rule 40(b) provides that a motion for 
reconsideration "shall state with particularity the points of 
law or fact that the moving party contends the court has 
overlooked or misapprehended[.]" 
(2) Dr. Lawinski does not provide argument regarding 
"the points of law or fact . . . the court has overlooked or misapprehended[.]" HRAP Rule 40(b). Instead, Dr. Lawinski requests supplementation of the record  with a new 2023 document 
not part of the record on appeal, and presents argument based on that 2023 document. We do not consider this argument, and the request for such supplementation is denied. See State v. Moses, 
102 Hawai ʻi 449, 455, 77 P.3d 940, 946 (2003) (holding that an 
appellate court "cannot consider evidence outside the record: 
'every appeal shall be taken on the record and no new evidence 
shall be introduced in the [appellate] court'" (brackets 
omitted) (quoting Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 641-2));
  
Alford v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 109 2
Hawaiʻi 14, 25 n.18, 122 
P.3d 809, 820 n.18 (2005) (disregarding material not part of the record on appeal as a violation of HRAP Rule 10). 1
1 HRAP Rule 10(e), entitled "Correction or modification of the
record," provides that "[i]f anything material to any party is omitted from
the record by error or accident or is misstated therein, corrections or
modifications may be" made. (Emphasis added.) Dr. Lawinski is not seekingto supplement the record because of an "error or accident," but seeks toadmit an entirely new document. Id.
2 HRS § 641-2 (2016) pertinently provides that: "Every appeal shall
be taken on the record, and no new evidence shall be introduced in thesupreme court."
