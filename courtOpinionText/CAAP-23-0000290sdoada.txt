IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I 
IN THE MATTER OF THE ADOPTION OF A MALE CHILD 
by C.C. and J.C., Petitioners-Appellees 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1AD221000013) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
C.C.
 and J.C. (together, Adoptive Parents ) adopted
Child. Child's natural father A.M. moved to overturn the 
adoption. The Family Court of the First Circuit denied A.M.'s 
motion by order entered on April 4, 2023.1 A.M. appeals. We 
affirm. 
Child was born in 2016. In re A.A., 150 Hawai#i 270, 
273, 500 P.3d 455, 458 (2021) ( AA I), cert. denied sub nom. McCoy 
v. Haw. Dep't of Human Servs., No. 21-1467, 143 S. Ct. 94 (U.S. Oct. 3, 2022) (mem.). One week later, DHS filed a petition for foster custody (the CPS Case ). The family court defaulted the 
then-unknown natural father for failing to appear after service by publication. The family court gave DHS foster custody of Child. Child was placed with Adoptive Parents. The family court eventually terminated the parental rights of Child's natural

mother and then-unknown father and awarded DHS permanent custody 
of Child. The family court approved adoption as the permanency plan for Child on August 14, 2018. 
On October 9, 2018, A.M. contacted DHS about "the 
process of legally bringing [Child] home." 
AA I, 150 Hawai #i at 
274, 500 P.3d at 459. 
A.M. had been adjudicated as Child's 
natural father in a separate paternity case. A.M. moved to intervene in the CPS Case. He was ordered to first move to set aside his default and the termination of his parental rights. After trial, the family court denied A.M.'s motion to set aside his default and his motion to intervene. Id. at 278, 500 P.3d at 463. A.M. appealed. 
The supreme court held that service by publication did 
not violate A.M.'s constitutional rights, AA I
, 150 Hawai#i at 
285, 500 P.3d at 470, and the family court did not err by declining to vacate A.M.'s default or the termination of his parental rights, 
id. at 285-86, 500 P.3d at 470-71. But it also 
held that A.M. wasn't required to set aside his default or the termination of his parental rights before proceeding with his motion to intervene. Id. at 286, 500 P.3d at 471. The CPS Case was remanded to the family court. 
On February 7, 2022, DHS initiated the case below (the
Adoption Case ) by petitioning the family court to let Adoptive 
Parents adopt Child. 
On February 17, 2022, A.M. renewed his motion to 
intervene in the CPS Case. In re A.A., No. CAAP-22-0000427, 2023 WL 3619865, *2 (Haw. App. May 24, 2023) (mem.) ( AA II), cert. 
rejected , No. SCWC-22-0000427, 2023 WL 5400092 (Haw. Aug. 22, 
2023). The family court heard and orally denied the motion on March 14, 2022. Id. 
On March 22, 2022, in the Adoption Case, the family 
court heard and orally granted the petition for adoption. 
On April 27, 2022, the family court revoked DHS's 
custody of Child and terminated its jurisdiction over the CPS Case given Child's adoption. AA II at *2. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Adoption Decree was entered in the Adoption Case on 
April 28, 2022. 
On May 5, 2022, in the CPS case, A.M. moved for 
reconsideration of the denial of his motion to intervene. AA II , 
2023 WL 3619865, at *2. The family court denied reconsideration. 
Id. A.M. appealed. We held that A.M.'s appeal from the denial 
of his motion to intervene was moot. The supreme court affirmed the termination of A.M.'s parental rights, so A.M.'s only remaining interest was in visitation. But Adoptive Parents' adoption of Child extinguished A.M.'s visitation interest. Id. 
at *3 (citing HRS § 587A-33(d)). We also held that the family court's jurisdiction in the CPS Case terminated upon Child's adoption. Id. (citing HRS §§ 587A-4, 578-16(b)). We affirmed 
the family court's order denying A.M.'s motion for reconsideration. The supreme court rejected A.M.'s petition for writ of certiorari on August 22, 2023. No. SCWC-22-0000427, 2023 WL 5400092. 
In the Adoption Case, A.M. moved to overturn Child's 
adoption on February 28, 2023. The family court entered an order denying A.M.'s motion on April 4, 2023. This appeal followed.
(1) HRS Chapter 578 governs adoptions. HRS § 578-12 
(2018) governs setting aside or modifying adoption decrees. Revised Laws of Hawaii, 1955 ( RLH) § 331-12 was the predecessor 
to HRS § 578-12. In In re Adoption of Watson , 45 Haw. 69, 361 
P.2d 1054 (1961), the supreme court held that under RLH § 331-12, the family court may consider "a petition or motion filed by any properly interested person  to . . . show good cause why a decree 
of adoption previously entered should be set aside or modified." Id. at 78, 361 P.2d at 1059 (emphasis added). The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether A.M. was a person "properly interested" in setting aside or modifying Child's adoption. 
In the CPS Case, the supreme court affirmed the family 
court's termination of A.M.'s parental rights. AA I
, 150 Hawai#i 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
at 285-86, 500 P.3d at 470-71. A.M. is precluded from 
relitigating that issue.  The order terminating A.M.'s parental 
rights stated: 2
13 Pursuant to HRS § 587A-33(b)(5) Mother and [A.M.] are
excluded from participating in adoption or other
subsequent proceedings and he/she/they shall not benoticed of future hearings and he/she/they shall notappear at future hearings unless he/she/they receivefurther legal notice requiring such appearance[.] 
Under these circumstances, A.M. was not a person "properly 
interested" in setting aside or modifying Child's adoption. The family court did not err by denying A.M.'s motion to overturn Child's adoption.
(2) A.M.'s argument that there was structural error in 
the CPS Case because the family court did not appoint counsel for the unidentified father, who was properly served and defaulted, AA I, 150 Hawai #i at 285-86, 500 P.3d at 470-71, is without 
merit. See In re JH
, 152 Hawai #i 373, 380, 526 P.3d 350, 357 
(2023) (noting that without a client, "what's an attorney to do?" because counsel would be "hard-pressed to understand the parent's present objectives, and is challenged to provide sound, ethical representation"). It is also an impermissible collateral attack on the family court's orders in the CPS Case. See In re Hawaiian Elec. Co., 149 Hawai #i 343, 358, 489 P.3d 1255, 1270 (2021) 
(discussing collateral attack doctrine).
(3) A.M.'s argument that he was not given notice of 
the Adoption Case also lacks merit. "[N]otice need not be given 
2 Issue preclusion, also referred to as collateral estoppel, applies
when: (1) the fact or issue in the present action is identical with the one
decided in the prior adjudication; (2) there was a final judgment on themerits in the prior adjudication; (3) the parties to the present action arethe same or in privity with the parties in the prior action; and (4) the factor issue decided in the prior action was actually litigated, finally decided,and essential to the earlier valid and final judgment. Dannenberg v. State ,
139 Hawai #i 39, 60, 383 P.3d 1177, 1198 (2016). Adoptive Parents were allowed
to intervene in the CPS case on May 29, 2019. AA I, 150 Hawai# i at 276, 500
P.3d at 461. 
Thus, A.M., Child, Adoptive Parents, and DHS — the parties to
the CPS Case — are also the parties to this case.

to any parent whose parental rights have been legally 
terminated[.]" HRS § 578-2(e). A person "who does not have any legal interest or custodial right in and to the child, cannot assail an adoption decree on the basis that he was not made a party to or given notice of the adoption proceedings." Watson , 
45 Haw. at 74, 361 P.2d at 1057. Cf. In re AG1 and AG2, ___ Hawai#i ___, ___ P.3d ___, 2024 WL 299417 (App. Jan. 26, 2024) 
(holding that HRS § 587A-13 does not require that a parent whose parental rights have been terminated be summoned if a subsequent petition concerning the child is filed). 
We need not consider A.M.'s other points of error 
(concerning good cause to overturn the adoption). The family court's April 4, 2023 "Order Denying Natural and Biological Father's Motion to Overturn Adoption" is affirmed.
