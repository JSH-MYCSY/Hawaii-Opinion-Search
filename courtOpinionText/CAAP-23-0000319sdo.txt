 Diazes) appeal from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's 
April 5, 2023 Judgment entered on an interlocutory decree of 
foreclosure in favor of Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-
Appellee PHH Mortgage Corporation.1 
On appeal, the Diazes posit six points of error (POE) 
with numerous subparts, appearing to assert the circuit court 
(1) erred in granting summary judgment (POE A through D); 
(2) erred in denying their motion to stay (POE E); and (3) denied their rights to due process and equal protection 
(POE F).
  2
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
1 The Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti presided. 
2 The Diazes' points of error are as follows: 
A. "Findings of Fact (' FOF') Nos. 4 and 6, in 19 ROA 113, 
the full text of which is in Appendix 2 attached, are 
erroneous[.]" 
B. "The Conclusions of Law (' COL') 4, 5-10 (Full Text in 
Appendix 2) are erroneous[.]" 
C. "The order granting summary judgment and denying the 
counterclaim is erroneous for all the reasons stated in Olga Diaz's opposition filed 5 August 2019 in 19 ROA 63, 
and in her objections thereto in 19 ROA 110[.]" 
D. "The Judgment is Erroneous for all of the Opening Brief 
Reasons." 
E. "The trial court reversibly erred denying [the] Diazes' 
stay motion." 
F. "The trial court denied the [Diazes'] constitutional 
rights to due process and equal protection[.]"  
(Formatting altered.)   Points not argued are deemed waived. Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Appellate Procedure ( HRAP)  Rule  28(b)(7).

 the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this 
appeal as discussed below and affirm. 
In March 2002, in exchange for a loan, the Diazes 
executed a promissory 
Note for $274,050.00 to PHH Mortgage 
Services, the Lender, and secured the Note with a Mortgage on their Property in Honolulu. An Allonge affixed to the Note was 
indorsed in blank: 
PAY TO THE ORDER OF: 
WITHOUT RECOURSE: 
PHH MORTGAGE CORPORATION DBA PHH MORTGAGE 
SERVICES  BY: /s/ Dana Consalo 
DANA CONSALO, ASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT, PHH 
MORTGAGE CORPORATION 
After the Diazes defaulted in January 2009, the Lender 
gave notice in February 2009 that it intended to foreclose on 
the Mortgage. 
In June 2010, Frank alone entered into a Loan 
Modification Agreement with the Lender. The modification 
agreement did not state the default was cured. 
In 2016, the Lender assigned the Mortgage to PHH 
Mortgage and recorded the Mortgage Assignment with the State of 
Hawaiʻi Bureau of Conveyances. 
On September 20, 2017, Aldrige Pite, LLP received at 
its San Diego, California office a Bailee Letter, along with the 
3
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  
 Note and Allonge, stating it would store the Note and Allonge on 
PHH Mortgage's behalf and subject to PHH Mortgage's "exclusive 
direction and control." 
On September 21, Lloyd T. 
Workman, an attorney of 
record for PHH Mortgage, "personally reviewed the original wet-
ink Note and Allonge," which were "being stored by [PHH 
Mortgage's] counsel on behalf of [PHH Mortgage] at Aldridge 
Pite, LLP's San Diego office." 
On September 26, PHH Mortgage filed a complaint for 
foreclosure. PHH Mortgage appended to its complaint, among other things, the (1) indorsed-in-blank Note; (2) Allonge; 
(3) Mortgage; (4) Mortgage Assignment; (5) September 22, 2017 
declaration by Workman stating that he personally reviewed the 
Note and Allonge; (6) Bailee Letter; (7) "Customer Account 
Activity Statement" demonstrating the Diazes' default; and 
(8) February 16, 2009 Notice of Intention to Foreclose.  
In 2019, PHH Mortgage moved for summary judgment, 
which the circuit court granted in part as PHH Mortgage established there were "enforceable Note and Mortgage 
contracts"; the Diazes defaulted under the Note and Mortgage; 
PHH Mortgage elected "to declare the entire principal balance of 
the Note due thereunder, together with interest, immediately due 
and payable"; "[d]ue notice of the acceleration of the Note was 
given" to the Diazes; the Diazes "failed to pay the sums due 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  
 
 
 
 
   
 
 under the Note"; and PHH Mortgage "qualifie[d] as the Note 
holder with standing to prosecute" because it possessed the 
indorsed-in-blank Note when it filed the complaint. The circuit 
court also denied the Diazes' counterclaims and their motion to 
stay. 
(1) First, the Diazes contend the circuit court erred 
in granting summary judgment, primarily on the ground that PHH 
Mortgage lacked standing to foreclose on the Note and Mortgage.3 
We review the grant or denial of summary judgment de 
novo. Nationstar Mortg. LLC v. Kanahele, 144 Hawaiʻ i 394, 401, 
443 P.3d 86, 93 (2019). The burden is on the summary judgment movant "to show the absence of any genuine issue as to all material facts, which, under applicable principles of 
substantive law, entitles the moving party to judgment as a 
matter of law." Umberger v. Dep't of Land & Nat. Res.
, 140 
Hawaiʻi 500, 528, 403 P.3d 277, 305 (2017) (quoting French v. 
Haw. Pizza Hut, Inc., 105 Hawaiʻ i 462, 470, 99 P.3d 1046, 1054 
(2004)). "Only with the satisfaction of this initial showing does the burden shift to the nonmoving party to respond by 
3 In addition, the Diazes assert fraud on the court because PHH 
Mortgage "lacks standing" and "is not the real party in interest." In light 
of our determination that PHH Mortgage has standing to foreclose, we need not 
discuss this issue further.

 affidavits or as otherwise provided in [Hawaiʻ i Rules of Civil 
Procedure] Rule 56, setting forth specific facts showing that 
there is a genuine issue for trial." Kondaur Cap. Corp. v.
Matsuyoshi, 136 Hawaiʻ i 227, 240-41 , 361 P.3d 454, 467-68 (2015) 
(citation modified). 
"A party seeking to foreclose on a mortgage and note 
must prove (1) the existence of the agreements, (2) the terms of the agreements, (3) default under the terms of the agreements, 
and (4) delivery of the notice of default." Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. v. Fong, 149 Hawai
ʻi 249, 253, 488 P.3d 1228, 1232 (2021) 
(citing Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai‘ i
 361, 367, 
390 P.3d 1248, 1254 (2017)). 
Notably, the Diazes do not dispute the existence or 
terms of the Note and Mortgage, their default, or delivery of 
notice of default.4 
Instead, the Diazes argue that: (a) the Note was 
purportedly securitized into a Trust in March 2002, making U.S. 
Bank, N.A., as trustee, the proper holder of the Note; (b) "the 
Note endorsement is void, and the Allonge that is supposed to be 
attached to the Note was not attached"; and (c) the "signature 
4 Although the Diazes' second point of error challenges the circuit 
court's conclusion that the Diazes "are in default under the terms of the 
Loan Documents for reason of failure to make payments as required 
thereunder," the Diazes do not present any argument as to why this conclusion 
is erroneous. HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed 
waived.").

 on the purported [Mortgage Assignment] is a forgery making it 
void."  (Emphasis omitted). We address the Diazes' arguments in 
turn. 5
5 Specifically, POE A challenges FOF 4 and 6, because the "endorsement 
was not dated" and "the assignment of the mortgage is forged." The 
challenged FOF are as follows: 
[FOF] 4. The Note includes an Allonge ("Allonge") 
by which the Note is indorsed in blank. The o riginal 
Allonge was executed, affixed to the original Note, and has been made a part of the original Note. 
    . . . . 
[FOF] 6. The Note was negotiated to [PHH 
Mortgage], and the Mortgage was subsequently assigned to 
[PHH Mortgage] by that Corporate Assignment of Mortgage 
("Assignment") recorded in the Bureau [of Conveyances] on 05/18/2016 as Document Number A59820884. 
See generally McKeller v. Outfitters Kauai, Ltd., 156 Hawaiʻ i 381, 575 P.3d 
38, No. CAAP
-23-0000102, 2025 WL 2605385, at *3 (App. Sep. 9, 2025) (SDO) 
("We emphasize that a circuit court deciding a motion for summary judgment 
does not make findings of fact. If facts are controverted, summary judgment 
should be denied."). 
POE B challenges COL 4 through 10: 
[COL] 4. [PHH Mortgage] is the holder of the Note 
and Mortgage and is entitled to enforce them. 
[PHH 
Mortgage] qualifies as the Note holder with standing to prosecute the instant action as the Note is indorsed in blank, thereby converting the Note to a bearer instrument, 
and [PHH Mortgage] is currently in rightful possession of 
the indorsed Note. 
[COL] 5. [PHH Mortgage] was the holder of the 
Note, indorsed in blank, at the time the Complaint was 
filed. 
[COL] 6. The Mortgage was duly assigned to [PHH 
Mortgage] by virtue of the Assignment described above. 
[COL] 7. [The Diazes] are in default under the 
terms of the Loan Documents for reason of failure to make payments as required thereunder. 
 (continued . . .)

 (a) The Diazes claim that PHH Mortgage lacks standing 
because "it never proved nor did it even plead that it was the 
trustee of that particular [Trust] identified in the Diazes' 
evidence." In support of this claim, the Diazes point to their 
expert's declaration that "[s]ince U.S. Bank, N.A. is the 
current Trustee of the [Trust] holding the Note, it is clear 
that PHH [Mortgage] lacked standing." 
"One person entitled to enforce an instrument is a 
'holder' of the instrument," and "the bearer of an instrument endorsed in blank becomes the holder of that instrument." Bank
of N.Y. Mellon v. Blye, 138 Hawaiʻ i 52, 375 P.3d 1290, No. CAAP-
14-0000784, 2016 WL 4035615, at *5 (App. July 22, 2016) (mem. 
op.). 
In its complaint, PHH Mortgage attached, inter alia, 
the Note, Allonge, a bailee letter, a condominium rider, and the 
Mortgage detailing the terms of the agreement, a customer 
  (. . . continued) 
[COL] 8. [PHH Mortgage] is entitled to the entry 
of summary judgment and an interlocutory decree of 
foreclosure against [the Diazes] in the foreclosure action, 
on the grounds that no genuine issue of material fact 
exists, and [PHH Mortgage] is entitled to summary j
udgment 
and an interlocutory decree of foreclosure as a matter of 
law. 
[COL] 9. [PHH Mortgage] also is entitled to an 
award of attorney's fees and costs under the terms and 
conditions of the Loan Documents. 
[COL] 10. As there is no just reason for delay, 
this Court expressly directs that final judgment be 
entered, entitling [PHH Mortgage] to foreclose upon the 
Property.

 account activity of the Diazes showing non-payment on the loan 
(default), and a February 16, 2009 notice of default delivered 
to the Diazes. 
The Note and Allonge do not mention the Trust. The 
Note is dated March 20, 2002, and it was signed by a notary 
public on March 28, 2002. The Mortgage was recorded in the 
Bureau of Conveyances on April 2, 2002. The Mortgage also does 
not mention any trust in particular. 
The Diazes' expert appears to rely on Exhibit 5 to 
show that "[o]n March 28, 2002, the Note was securitized to [the Trust]," and "on May 18, 2016 the servicing rights ONLY were 
sold to PHH Mortgage Corporation. The loan (Note and Mortgage) 
remained in [the Trust] and is currently still in [the Trust]." 
Exhibit 5 is a single, mostly blank page, that does 
not contain any dates or mention any trust in particular and 
includes strings of numbers and the words "PHH MORTGAGE 
CORPORATION." The Diazes' expert does not explain how Exhibit 5 demonstrates that the Note and Mortgage remain in the Trust. 
Moreover, the Diazes do not include the alleged Trust 
agreement. Thus, there are no specific facts showing the 
Mortgage Assignment violated the Trust's terms. See U.S. Bank
N.A. v. Mattos, 140 Hawaiʻi 26, 35, 398 P.3d 615, 625 (2017) 
(explaining that when the terms of a trust were not before the 
9   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  
    
  
 court there was "no actual evidence that the . . . assignments 
of mortgage violated terms within the [trust]"). 
In sum, the Diazes' argument regarding the Trust does 
not create a genuine issue of material fact as to PHH Mortgage's 
standing to foreclose. 
(b) The Diazes also argue that "the Note endorsement 
is void, and the Allonge that is supposed to be attached to the 
Note was not attached." 
An allonge is "a slip of paper sometimes attached to a 
negotiable instrument for the purpose of receiving further indorsements when the original paper is filled with 
indorsements." 
Id. at 29 n.4, 398 P.3d at 618 n.4. It is "part 
of the instrument, and is valid even if the instrument has enough space to hold additional endorsements." See Wilmington
Sav. Fund Soc'y, FSB as Tr. for Pretium Mortg. Acquisition Tr. 
v. Riopta, 157 Hawaiʻ i 409, 578 P.3d 521, Nos. CAAP-22-0000292 & 
CAAP-23-0000108, 2025 WL 2877718, at *4 n.8 (App. Oct. 9, 2025) (SDO). 
And under Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 490:3-205(b) 
(2008),  an instrument indorsed in blank is payable to the 
bearer. Reyes-Toledo, 139 6
Hawaiʻi at 370, 390 P.3d at 1257. 
6 HRS § 490:3-205(b) provides: "If an indorsement is made by the 
holder of an instrument and it is not a special indorsement, it is a 
'blank indorsement'. When indorsed in blank, an instrument becomes 
payable to bearer and may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone until specially indorsed." 
10   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  Here, the Note was indorsed in blank via the Allonge. 
Dated March 20, 2002, the Note contains three signatures: 
Frank's, Olga's, and a (voided) blank indorsement. Affixed to 
the Note was the Allonge, which correctly identified the date of 
the Note, the loan amount, the Diazes as the borrowers, and the 
Property's address. The Allonge also stated that, "for the 
purpose of further endorsement of the following described Note, 
this Allonge is affixed and becomes a permanent part of said Note[.]" (Formatting altered.) 
The Diazes did not present specific facts to show 
there is a genuine issue regarding the Allonge being properly 
affixed. See Riopta, 2025 WL 2877718, at *4-5. 
(c) Challenging Finding of Fact (FOF) 6, the Diazes 
argue that the "signature on the purported assignment of the [M]ortgage is a forgery making it void." (Emphasis omitted.) 
In FOF 6, the circuit court explained, "the Mortgage 
was subsequently assigned to [PHH Mortgage] by the Corporate Assignment of Mortgage ('Assignment') recorded in the Bureau on 
05/18/2016 as Document Number A59820884." During the hearing on 
the motion for summary judgment, the circuit court questioned 
whether the Diazes' expert was "an expert in forensic 
handwriting analysis," to which the Diazes' counsel answered, "I 
think so," but acknowledged that the expert's qualifications 
were not listed in her declaration. The Diazes' counsel then 
11
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 argued, "You don't have to be an expert in handwriting analysis 
to tell that those signatures are wrong." 
The Diazes did not present specific facts showing 
there is a genuine issue as to whether the signature on the 
assignment was a forgery. 
As such, the circuit court did not err in granting 
summary judgment in favor of PHH Mortgage. 
(2)  The Diazes next contend the circuit court 
"reversibly erred [by] denying [their] stay motion." 
Because we reject the Diazes' challenges to standing, 
any argument challenging the circuit court's denial of the stay 
motion is moot. See Citimortgage, Inc. v. Brum, 154 
Hawaiʻi 256, 
549 P.3d 341, No. CAAP-19-0000062, 2024 WL 2292576, at *3 (App. 
May 21, 2024) (SDO) (explaining that a challenge to the denial 
of motion to stay foreclosure was moot where challenges to the 
foreclosure judgment was rejected). 
(3)  Finally, the Diazes allege, in a conclusory 
manner, that by granting summary judgment in favor of PHH 
Mortgage, the circuit court "violated [their] constitutional rights to due process and equal protection by denying their 
property, possession, and ownership interests." 
Where there was no genuine issue as to PHH Mortgage's 
standing to foreclose, the court did not err in granting summary 
judgment; thus, the Diazes' rights to a fair trial and equal 
12
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
   
 
 protection were not violated. See Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.
v. Church of Hawaii Nei, 121 Hawaiʻ i 31, 211 P.3d 89, No. 28482, 
2009 WL 1865085, at *2 (App. June 29, 2009) (SDO) (explaining 
"[w]here no genuine issues of material fact exists, . . . the 
circuit court properly granted . . . summary judgment" and "did 
not deny the [defendant] its right to a fair and full trial"). 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's 
April 5, 2023 Judgment.
