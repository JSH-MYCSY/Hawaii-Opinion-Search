(CASE NO. 1CPC-17-0000823) 
AND
 STATE OF 
HAWAI#I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
CHARLESTON MAHOE, SR., Defendant-Appellant
(CASE NO. 1CPC-17-0000829) 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting C.J., and Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Charleston Mahoe, also known as 
Charleston Mahoe, Sr. (Mahoe), appeals from the following orders 
(together, the 
Denial Orders) entered by the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit: (1) the February 28, 2023 "Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying [Mahoe's] Motion to Dismiss 
Proceedings" in case no. 1CPC-17-0000823 (Case 823); and (2) the 
February 28, 2023 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and 
Order Denying [Mahoe's] Motion to Dismiss Proceedings," in case 
no. 1CPC-17-0000829 (Case 829).
1/ 
On June 22, 2017, Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai#i 
(
State) charged Mahoe in Case 823 with Count 1, Assault in the 
Second Degree, and Count 2, Violation of a Temporary Restraining 
Order. On June 23, 2017, the State charged Mahoe in the 829 Case

with Counts 1 through 3, Terroristic Threatening in the First 
Degree, and Counts 4 through 9, Violation of a Temporary 
Restraining Order. 
Mahoe pleaded no contest to all counts in both cases, 
and on December 19, 2017, the circuit court sentenced him to HOPE 
probation. 
On June 24, 2022, the State moved in both cases to 
revoke Mahoe's probation and resentence him. 
On December 22, 2022, Mahoe filed a Motion to Dismiss 
Proceedings (Motion to Dismiss) in each case. Mahoe argued that 
the Hawai#i Supreme Court's decision in State v. Obrero, 151 
Hawai#i 472, 517 P.3d 755 (2022), required dismissal due to the 
State's failure to comply with HRS ยง 801-1's indictment-or-
information requirement. 
On February 28, 2023, the circuit court entered the 
Denial Orders, which denied the respective Motions to Dismiss. 
On May, 11, 2023, the circuit court filed Orders of Resentencing 
Revocation of Probation. 
On appeal, Mahoe contends that the circuit court erred 
in applying "the Motta/Wells standard" to his "Obrero claim" and 
denying his Motions to Dismiss on that basis. 
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues 
raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve 
Mahoe's appeal as follows: 
The Hawaii Supreme Court has held that "Obrero applies 
to cases that were pending trial before the decision. Obrero 
does not apply retroactively to defendants who pled out or to 
defendants convicted after a trial." State v. Bautista, 153 
Hawai#i 284, 289, 535 P.3d 1029, 1034 (2023). The supreme court 
further held that "defendants awaiting sentencing . . . are 
foreclosed from having their pleas nullified or their trial 
convictions overturned" pursuant to Obrero. Id. 
Here, Mahoe pled out, was convicted, and was sentenced 
to probation with special conditions before Obrero was decided. 
He was awaiting resentencing when he first raised his argument 
based on Obrero. Pursuant to Bautista, Obrero did not apply to 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
his cases. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in denying 
the Motions to Dismiss. 
Therefore, the respective February 28, 2023 Denial 
Orders entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit in Case 
823 and Case 829 are affirmed.
