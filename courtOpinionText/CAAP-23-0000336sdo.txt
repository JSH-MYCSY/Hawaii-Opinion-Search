IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS

STATE  OF  HAWAI I,  Plaintiff-Appellant,   v.  
VIHN  DU  CHAU,  also  known  as  VIHN  CHAU,  also  known  as  ERIC  CHAU, 
Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  FAMILY  COURT  OF  THE  SECOND  CIRCUIT 
(CASE  NO.  2FFC-22-0000171) 
SUMMARY  DISPOSITION  ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding
 Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Plaintiff-Appellant  State   of  Hawai i   (the  State) 
appeals  from  the  April  11,  2023  Judgment  of  Acquittal  (Judgment 
of  Acquittal )  entered  by  the  Family  Court  of  the  Second  Circuit 
(Family  Court)  in  favor  of  Defendant-Appellee  Vihn  Du  Chau,  also 
known  as  Vihn  Chau,  also  known  as  Eric  Chau  (Chau). 1
The State
 raises a single point of error, contending 
that the Family Court erred when it entered the Judgment of 
Acquittal because the Family Court was, in effect, sustaining a 
motion to dismiss, not acquitting Chau. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
1 The Honorable James R. Rouse presided.          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
  
     
           
          
            
          
         
          the  arguments  advanced  and  the  issues  raised,  we  resolve  the 
State's  point  of  error  as  follows:   
The  State  recognizes  that  it  generally  may  not  take  an 
appeal  in  a  criminal  case  when  a  defendant  is  acquitted.   See 
Hawaii  Revised  Statutes  (HRS)  §  641-13(9)  (2016)  (allowing  the 
State  to  appeal  an  acquittal  following  a  verdict  of  guilty).  
However,  the  State  relies  on  State  v.  Markowski,  88  Hawai i  477, 
481-82,  967  P.2d  674,  678-79  (App.  1998),  wherein  this  court 
allowed  the  State  to  appeal  a  judgment  of  acquittal  with  respect 
to  three  counts  where  the  judgment  of  acquittal  was  based  on  the 
defense's  argument  that  the  charges  underlying  those  counts  were 
defective.   This  court  concluded  that  the  Markowski  trial  court 
had  not  reached  the  issue  of  whether  some  or  all  of  the  factual 
elements  of  the  charges  were  proven.   Id.  at  483,  967  P.2d  at 
680.   Therefore,  the  Markowski  judgment  of  acquittal  was  in  form 
only,  not  in  substance,  and  the  trial  court  had  grounded  its 
ruling  on  the  conclusion  that  the  charges  were  defective.   Id.  
Thus,  the  trial  court  had  in  effect  dismissed  the  defective 
charges,  which  action  is  subject  to  appellate  review  under  HRS 
§  641-13(1)  (2016)  (permitting  a  State  appeal  from  a  motion  to 
dismiss,  inter  alia,  a  complaint  or  count). 
This case
 is distinguishable. Here, the defense 
argument was that notice is an element of the charge and the 
State did not establish that particular element in its case in 
chief. While the Family Court may not have been fully correct in 
all aspects of its interpretation of the statute under which Chau 
was charged, its ruling was nevertheless grounded in its factual 
determination that the State failed to prove an element of the

 charge, stating: "That element has not been established to this 
court's satisfaction." Chau was acquitted because the Family 
Court concluded that the State did not establish all of the 
elements of the charge. 
Accordingly, appellate review is not available to the 
State on the issue raised in this case. The State's appeal is 
dismissed.2
