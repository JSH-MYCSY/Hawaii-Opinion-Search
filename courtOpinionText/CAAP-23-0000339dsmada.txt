APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 3CC121000100) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that self-
represented Defendant-Appellant Paul Wallace (
Wallace) appeals 
from the April 10, 2023 Judgment entered by the Circuit Court of 
the Third Circuit. Wallace filed the May 11, 2023 Notice of Appeal more than 30 days after entry of the Judgment, which is outside of the deadline set forth in Hawai# i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1). The record does not indicate that 
Wallace received an extension of time to appeal under HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(4), or that the deadline was otherwise tolled by a timely-filed post-judgment motion under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). Compliance with the requirement of timely filing a notice of NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal is jurisdictional. Grattafiori v. State , 79 Hawai#i 10, 
13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed. 
DATED: 
Honolulu, Hawai#i, July 20, 2023.
