SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Guidry, JJ.) 
Self-represented Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-
Appellant Wei Ling Fung (Fung) and Third-Party Defendant-
Appellant FuGang Xia, aka Summer ( 
Summer) (collectively, 
Appellants)  appeal from the District Court of the First 
Circuit's (district court) Judgment, filed on April 25, 2023.2   1
1 Appellants are self- represented on appeal, but they were 
represented by counsel during the district court proceedings. 
2 The Honorable Thomas A.K. Haia presided.   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 Appellants retained Defendant/Counterclaimant/Third-
Party Plaintiff-Appellee Wa Cham Hoi (Hoi), a structural 
engineer, to do work related to a construction project. Fung 
subsequently filed a complaint, contending that Hoi failed to 
complete the work he was contracted to do and seeking 
reimbursement of Appellants' $11,500 initial payment to Hoi. 
Hoi filed a counterclaim against Fung and a third-party 
complaint against Summer, contending that he completed his structural engineering work for Appellants, and that Appellants 
owed him the remaining balance of his agreed-upon fees, plus 
interest, attorney's fees, and costs. 
The Judgment was entered in favor of Hoi, and Hoi was 
awarded $18,179.58 on his counterclaim. The district court 
explained its ruling as follows, 
Generally speaking, [c]ourts are not supposed to go beyond 
the four corners of a contract when looking at whether or 
not the contract is ambiguous. 
Parol evidence is not accepted generally speaking. 
However, in this case the [district court] finds that the 
contract, which would be the check, is ambiguous. I want to say that it's ambiguous because the check says it's for 
50 percent of the architectural design fee, the civil engineering fee, and it's regarding TMK, and then it gives 
the TMK number. 
This makes no sense to the [district court] given the 
representations by [Hoi] that he is not an architect. 
In addition to that, because of that ambiguity, the 
[district court] then looks at the text messages that were 
entered into evidence this afternoon and finds that on 
September 7th, 2018, [Hoi] unequivocally states, My structural engineering fee is $23,000. He then asks, This 
is before the contract exists? It appears to the [district 
court] that the -- the parties are negotiating at this 
point. 
 . . . .

 [Hoi] on September 12th of 2018 says -- I'm sorry --
on September 9th of 2018, asks for the architectural 
drawings. 
On September 12th, he acknowledges receiving an email 
with the architectural drawings. 
If you look at the 
September 12th email, it shows that there are architectural drawings from China. 
On September 14th, which is two days later in 2018, 
[Summer] goes to China. 
On October -- it doesn't appear that there are any 
communications between that date and October 10th of 2018, where [Summer] says he'd like to engage the services of James Lyon, a civil engineer. 
[Hoi] then replies on the same date, The Lyon fee is 
$30,000 and I'm looking for someone else. I'm suggesting Structural Hawaii. There are more text messages. 
On October 21st, [Hoi] says that Wesley, whoever 
Wesley is, hadn't provided drawings, topographic drawings. 
And then October 24th, there's a discussion in 2018 
about a soil[] engineer because evidently this -- this 
property is on the beach and there's a setback requirement because of the shoreline. The request to build in concrete 
because of the level of the water table. It appears [Hoi] 
is concerned and is telling [Summer] that he needs a soil[] engineer and suggests Larry Shinsato. 
At that point on October 26 of 2018, there's an 
exchange that occurs. And [Hoi] says it will take one month to complete the design drawings if made in concrete --if it's built in concrete, but you need a soils report. 
And then on October 28th of 2018, a check for $11,500 
is exchanged. And as I said earlier, this check in the memo section has a TM key reference -- TMK reference and talks about 50 percent of an architectural design fee and 
civil engineer fee. 
About on New Year's Eve of 2018, so December 31st, 
2018, there is a discussion about engaging the soil[] 
engineer. 
And then on March 3rd of 2019, there's a message from 
[Summer] to [Hoi] saying, I received the soil test with a response saying, Can be built. 
The next message is on March 16th of 2019, where 
[Summer] says, We're going to decide whether to do it or 
not. 
And then on April 28th of 2019, [Summer] asked, How's 
it going? 
3   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
   
 On the 29th, [Hoi] represents, Need more time. 
On June 26 of 2019, there's a discussion of someone 
named Peter, who's charging $4,500 to be the civil 
engineer. 
And then on June 27th, [Hoi] responds he's willing to 
reduce his fee to $18,000 to match someone named [Jimmy]. 
Considering all of the evidence, the testimony, what 
I've just put on the record, [district court] is finding 
that the agreement was [Summer] and [Fung] were going to 
engage [Hoi] for purposes of structural engineering to the 
tune of $23,000, as is made clear and unequivocal in a 
September 7th, 2018 text message between the parties. 
The [district court] is making a finding based on the 
evidence heard today that $11,500 of that amount was 
received by [Hoi] on September 28, 2018. Excuse me. I 
stand corrected. On October 28, 2018, that check changed 
hands. 
The [district court] finds that [Hoi] is entitled to 
the remaining balance of $11,500. 
Appellants appear to make five arguments in their 
Amended Opening Brief : (1) "[the district court's] confirmation 
that [Hoi] completed his Structural Engineering design drawings 
is entirely without any evidence or basis and is erroneous"; (2) 
"[the district court] did not carefully review [Exhibits] I and 
J provided by [Hoi] to the court and erroneously ruled [Hoi's] 
quotation as a contract"; (3) "[the district court] did not 
carefully distinguish between the truthfulness of [Hoi's] and [Hoi's counsel's] testimonies during the court proceedings, 
failing to exercise the commonsense judgment expected of a 3
3 Appellants' opening brief does not set forth points of error on 
appeal, and is in other ways noncompliant with Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 28(b). To promote access to justice, we do not automatically 
foreclose self- represented litigants from appellate review for their failure 
to comply with the court rules. Erum v. Llego
, 147 Hawaiʻi 368, 380- 81, 465 
P.3d 815, 827- 28 (2020).

 judge"; (4) "[the district court] did not carefully review the 
evidence of the translation of the Chinese text messages 
translated into English provided by [Hoi] and [Hoi's counsel] on 
mobile phones" and erred by "admitting them as evidence"; and 
(5) "[the district court] did not carefully review the evidence 
and testimonies of both parties, applying a double standard in 
judging the content of [Fung's] check payments."  
Upon careful review of the record, briefs, and 
relevant legal authorities, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, 
we address Appellants' contentions as follows: 
(1) Appellants appear to challenge the district 
court's finding that Hoi completed his structural design 
drawings as being "without any evidence or basis." 
We review a 
trial court's findings of fact (FOFs) under the clearly 
erroneous standard. Casumpang v. ILWU Local 142, 108 Hawaiʻ i 
411, 419, 121 P.3d 391, 399 (2005). 
"An FOF is clearly 
erroneous when, despite evidence to support the finding, the 
appellate court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed." Id.
The record reflects that Appellants stipulated to the 
admission of Hoi's structural design drawings into evidence as 
Exhibit K. 
Hoi testified at trial that Exhibit K comprised "the 
structural drawings based on the info [he had] from Summer," and 
5   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  
  
 
 that the structural drawings were "a complete product" as of 
July 9, 2019. 
On this record, we conclude the district court did not 
clearly err in finding that Hoi had completed his structural 
design drawings for Appellants. 
(2) Appellants appear to contend that the district 
court "did not carefully review [Exhibits] I and J provided by 
[Hoi] to the [district] court and erroneously ruled [Hoi's] quotation as a contract." The district court's determination 
that the parties entered into a contract is a question of fact 
that we review under the clearly erroneous standard. WW v. DS
, 
149 Hawaiʻi 123, 129, 482 P.3d 1084, 1090 (2021) ("Whether the 
parties entered into an agreement is essentially a question of 
fact the court reviews under the clearly erroneous standard.") 
(cleaned up). 
Exhibits I and J, referenced by Appellants, consist of 
Hoi's email communications and text messages with Summer. 
These 
exhibits, which the parties stipulated to admit at trial, support the district court's findings that Appellants and Hoi entered into an agreement, whereby Hoi would provide structural 
engineering services to Appellants for a $23,000 fee.
4 Exhibits 
4 Exhibit J reflects a text message from Hoi to Summer that states, 
"My fee changes to same as Jimmy ($18,000). You may ask Peter (civil 
engineer)." At trial, Summer testified that Hoi had offered to reduce his fee to $18,000, but Summer "did not agree." It appears that to the extent 
Hoi offered to amend the contract to reduce his fee, that offer was rejected 
 (continued . . .)

 I and J also support that Hoi's work on the project was 
specifically in the nature of structural engineering, and that 
other types of work -- e.g., civil engineering and soil 
engineering work -- would need to be addressed by others.5 
On this record, we conclude the district court did not 
clearly err in finding that Appellants agreed, through their 
email and text message correspondence, to pay Hoi $23,000 for 
structural engineering work. 
(3) Appellants appear to challenge the district 
court's determination of Hoi and Hoi's counsel's credibility. "[T]he credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their 
testimony are within the province of the trier of fact and, 
generally, will not be disturbed on appeal." Tamashiro v.
Control Specialist, Inc., 97 Hawaiʻ i 86, 92, 34 P.3d 16, 22 
(2001) (citations omitted). "An appellate court will not pass 
upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the 
 4(. . . continued) 
by Summer, and the contract was therefore not amended for lack of mutual 
agreement.  
5 The district court's findings are further supported by Hoi's 
testimony at trial. The memo note on Fung's initial payment check states, in 
relevant part, "Artectur [sic] design fee 50% deposit include civil engineer fee." Hoi testified that upon seeing the memo note, he told Summer: "Hey, 
I'm a structural engineer. The [$]11,500 is a structural fee. . . . This is 
incorrect. It has to be structural engineer fee only." Hoi testified that he accepted the check after Appellants told him, "okay," and that Appellants 
"underst[ood he was] a structural engineer only." 
Hoi also testified to informing Summer that Appellants needed an 
"architect," "surveyor," "soil engineer," and "civil engineer" for the project. He explained that, "[Summer was] responsible [for] look[ing] for 
those consultant[s] and hir[ing] them independently. But to assist [Summer], 
[Hoi] said, Hey, I can give you some name[s], you can call them if you like."

 weight of the evidence." Schefke v. Reliable Collection Agency,
Ltd., 96 Hawaiʻ i 408, 422, 32 P.3d 52, 66 (2001) (cleaned up). 
We therefore decline to address the district court's credibility 
determinations. 
(4) Appellants appear to contend that the district 
court erred by admitting the translated text messages between 
the parties into evidence. 
Appellants characterize the text 
messages as "false evidence . . . contain[ing] multiple misleading translations." As discussed in section (2), supra, 
Appellants stipulated to the admission of Exhibit J -- which 
included the translated text messages that Appellants challenge 
on appeal -- into evidence at trial. We therefore deem Appellants' argument to be waived. See Tax Appeal of Subway
Real Est. Corp. v. Dir. of Tax'n, 110 Hawaiʻ i 25, 30, 129 P.3d 
528, 533 (2006) ("[A]s a general rule, if a party does not raise 
an argument at trial, that argument will be deemed to have been 
waived on appeal[.]") (citation omitted). 
(5) Appellants contend that the district court "did 
not carefully review the evidence and testimonies of both 
parties, applying a double standard in judging the content of 
[Fung's] check payments." The record reflects that the district 
court appropriately considered the evidence introduced by the 
parties at trial to determine the parties' intent at the time they entered into the agreement. See Hawaiian Ass'n of Seventh-
8   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  Day Adventists v. Wong, 130 Hawaiʻ i 36, 48, 305 P.3d 452, 464 
(2013) (instructing that "the fact-finder may consider 
additional evidence, including parol evidence, regarding the intent of the parties at the time of drafting" where the 
contract terms were ambiguous). Appellants make no discernible 
arguments in support of their contentions that the district 
court relied on "false evidence," and that Hoi and Hoi's counsel 
"intentionally deceived" the district court, and we therefore 
decline to address them. See Kaho
ʻohanohano v. Dep't. of Hum. 
Servs.
, 117 Hawaiʻ i 262, 297 n.37, 178 P.3d 538, 573 n.37 (2008) 
(stating that the supreme court will "disregard a particular 
contention if the appellant makes no discernible argument in 
support of that position") (cleaned up). 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Judgment.
