  association, Applicant-Appellee Association of Apartment Owners 
of Waikiki Banyan ( Association ), for an underlying dispute 
arising out of remodeling work on Owners' unit. We vacate and remand. 
In CAAP-23-351, Owners appeal from the April 24, 2023 
"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part [Association]'s Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement and For Sanctions" ( First 
Order Enforcing Settlement ). Owners raise five points of error 
(POEs),
3 contending that the Circuit Court erred by: 
(1) concluding there were no "genuine issues of material fact regarding an agreement" between Owners and the Association, based on its finding that "an email message summarizing 'essential terms' . . . was an enforceable agreement"; (2) "failing to hold an evidentiary hearing as required by this Court's mandatory precedent" despite the existence of genuine 
issues of material fact; (3) "making credibility determinations 
without conducting an evidentiary hearing or trial"; 
(4) "fail[ing] to rule on the impact of the Association's use of [a] fraudulent fine threat to compel a settlement"; and (5) "failing to rule on whether the Association's . . . fine threat was an unfair or deceptive act in violation of [Unfair 
and Deceptive Practices ( UDAP)], rendering the alleged 
settlement agreement void and unenforceable." 
In CAAP-24-334, Owners appeal from the April 4, 2024 
"Order Granting [Association]'s Second Motion to Enforce 
Settlement Agreement and For Sanctions" ( Second Order Enforcing 
Settlement ). In this second appeal arising out of the same 
dispute, Owners repeat their contention that the Circuit Court 
erred by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing, as well as by 
3 We have numbered Owners' points "A" through "E". See  Hawaiʻi 
Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4) (requiring numbered POEs).

 "finding [Owners] engaged in bad faith by refusing to sign a 
judicially rewritten settlement agreement." 
We conclude in CAAP-23-351 that the Circuit Court 
erred in the First Order Enforcing Settlement and should have held an evidentiary hearing on the disputed material issues of fact. Because this result is dispositive, we need not address the remaining contentions in CAAP-23-351 and point of error in CAAP-24-334.

"A motion to enforce a settlement agreement is 
reviewed by the same standard as a motion for summary judgment." 
McKenna v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Elima Lani, 148 Hawai ʻi 
233, 239, 470 P.3d 1110, 1116 (2020). On appeal, the grant or 
denial of summary judgment is reviewed de novo. Id.
Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine
issue as to any material fact and the moving party isentitled to judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly,granting a motion to enforce a settlement agreement is
appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact
and as a matter of law the parties entered into a validcompromise agreement. 
Id. (emphasis added) (citation modified). "The evidence must be 
viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party."

  agreement: (1) a declaration ( Gray Declaration ) by the 
Association's counsel Taylor Gray asserting that Owners' former 
counsel, Ronald Ogomori ( Ogomori), "confirmed" to Gray that "his 
clients were in agreement with the term sheet"; and (2) a 
November 8, 2022 emailed term sheet from Ogomori to Gray attached as Exhibit 1 to Gray's Declaration ( Exhibit 1 term 
sheet), which states that the parties would work to draft the settlement agreement "[a]fter the parties have agreed to the term sheet[.]"

The Exhibit 1 term sheet is reproduced below in its 
entirety: 
From: Ronald Ogomori [Ogomori's email address] on
behalf of Ronald Ogomori

to draft the settlement agreement within 10business days; 
8. Within 30 days of executing the settlement

9. If a dispute arises regarding any of the
abovementioned terms and/or any terms included inthe settlement agreement to be drafted, theparties agree that [retired] Judge [Marie] Milks[(Judge Milks )] shall assist to resolve those
differences/disagreements. 
(Emphases in original.) 
The Gray Declaration described the purported agreement 
reached with the assistance of their mediator, Judge Milks, as 
follows: 
11. After nearly seven (7) hours of mediation, the
parties were able to reach an agreement. 
12. The material terms of that settlement were 
memorialized in a term sheet. 
13. Attached hereto as Exhibit "1" is a true and 
correct copy of the term sheet. 
14. The bargained-for-exchange provided by the
Association was that it would refrain from pursuing a
complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against[Owners], as well as waive $71,000.00 in fines owed by[Owners], in exchange for [Owners] restoring the Unit to astate substantially similar to its as-built condition by no
later than December 17, 2022. 
15. Counsel for [Owners], Ronald Ogomori, confirmed
to me and Judge Milks that his clients were in agreement
with the terms of the term sheet. 
16. Judge Milks requested that I, as well as Mr.
Ogomori, each receive confirmation from our clients thatthey are in agreement with the term sheet. 
5  
       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  17. Attached hereto as Exhibit "12" is my client's
confirmation that the Association agreed to the term sheet. 
18. Mr. Ogomori confirmed that he had received his
clients' confirmation that they were in agreement with the
term sheet. 
19. As a settlement was reached, Judge Milks
concluded the mediation and congratulated us on asuccessful mediation. 
(Emphases added.) 
As noted above in paragraph 17, Gray declared that 
"Exhibit '12' is my client's confirmation that the Association 
agreed to the term sheet." The record reflects that the term sheet in Exhibit "12," which the Association's President expressly approved in a 3:48 p.m. email approximately a half-hour before the 4:24 p.m. Exhibit 1 term sheet email, contains 
additional differences in the terms set forth in paragraphs 4 
and 8, beyond the bolded language in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Exhibit 1 term sheet. 
(1) and (2)  Owners argue there are genuine issues of 
material fact as to whether the Exhibit 1 term sheet, as memorialized in the November 8, 2022 email sent by Ogomori to Gray and the mediator, represented an enforceable agreement 
between Owners and the Association. Owners contend that "the 
parties disagree if [sic] they actually entered into a contract" and that "whether [Owners] actually accepted" the Exhibit 1 term sheet "proffered during the mediation" is "[s]pecifically at issue" in this case. In support of this position, Owners argue, among other things, that Ogomori did not have written actual 
authority to agree to the term sheet on their behalf, as 
required by Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 605-7;
6 and Owners 
6 HRS § 605-7 (2016), entitled "Control of action; power to
settle," requires licensed legal practitioners to have "special authority in 
6  
       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 told Ogomori that "the Association's demand that the Unit's 
improvements be removed by December 17, 2022 . . . was 
contingent" on certain "condition[s] precedent" such as "lack of 
conflicting existing rental reservations and contractor availability." Owners claim, "In sum, genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether or not the parties entered into the settlement agreement" where the record is "devoid of a signed term sheet" or "signed settlement agreement." 
The Association maintains that "the [p]arties reached 
an agreement, as evidenced by the term sheet sent by [Owners'] counsel[,]" referencing the Exhibit 1 term sheet. The Association asserts that "the evidence in the record shows that all the essential elements of a contract are present." The Association then claims that the burden shifted to Owners to demonstrate "specific facts, as opposed to conclusory 
allegations, that presented a genuine issue worthy of trial"; 
and Owners' "conclusory" statements in their declarations that "we agreed to tentative, contingent possible  settlement during 
the mediation" and "at no time did we authorize our prior attorney to make any representations to the mediator or the Association that we agreed on all material terms of a settlement 
with the Association[,]" were insufficient to create a genuine 
issue of material fact. In the alternative, the Association acknowledges that this court may remand this matter for an evidentiary hearing if we find, inter alia, "there to be a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether [Owners'] counsel had express written authority to settle this case, as he represented to both Judge Milks and opposing counsel that he 
had[.]" The Association supplied the record reference for the 
writing from the practitioner's client" in order "to compromise, arbitrate,
or settle such matters confided to the practitioner[.]"

       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 latter statements regarding Ogomori's communication of his 
authority to settle as paragraphs 16, 18, and 19 of the Gray 
Declaration. 
The Association's contention that Owners' declarations 
were inadequate assumes that the Association had satisfied its 
initial burden as a summary judgment movant, and presumes that the burden had shifted to the Owners. As we explain below, the Association did not meet its initial burden of production on the central, material disputed fact at issue, of whether a 
settlement agreement existed in this case. 
"[S]ettlement agreements are contracts," and "the 
traditional requirements for contract formation must be met for 
an enforceable settlement agreement to exist." McKenna, 148 
Hawaiʻi at 241, 470 P.3d at 1118 (citation omitted). If the 
parties have not "reached agreement upon all the essential and 
material terms, conditions or covenants of the agreement, [then] there was failure of mutual assent or a meeting of the minds and therefore no binding contract." 
Id. at 241-42, 470 P.3d at 
1118-19 (quoting Carson v. Saito, 53 Haw. 178, 182, 489 P.2d 636, 638 (1971)). In McKenna, which involved a settlement dispute between a condominium unit owner and the condominium 
owners association and its managing agent, the supreme court 
vacated an order enforcing settlement on grounds that the unit owner's declaration raised genuine issues of material fact "as to the validity of her assent to the settlement conference terms" and "as to which terms were explicitly and implicitly agreed to at the settlement conference." Id. at 242, 470 P.3d 
at 1119. 
"A motion for summary judgment should not be granted 
where there is a factual question as to the existence, validity, 
and terms of the alleged settlement agreement[.]" Gilmartin v.
8
  
       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 Abastillas, 10 Haw. App. 283, 296, 869 P.2d 1346, 1352 (App. 
1994) (citation omitted). Under Hawai ʻi Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) Rule 56, the moving party must "satisfy his or her 
initial burden of production" to establish that "no genuine issue of material facts exists" with respect to the essential 
elements of the claim. Ralston v. Yim, 129 Hawai ʻi 46, 56, 292 
P.3d 1276, 1286 (2013). "Only when the moving party satisfies 
its initial burden of production does the burden shift to the 
nonmoving party to respond" by demonstrating "specific facts, as 
opposed to general allegations, that present a genuine issue worthy of a trial[,]" or an evidentiary hearing, as in this case. Id. at 56-57, 292 P.3d at 1286-87. 
An affidavit or declaration supporting a motion for 
summary judgment "must be based on personal knowledge of the 
matter, i.e., admissible evidence." Adams v. CDM Media USA,
Inc., 135 Hawai ʻi 1, 28, 346 P.3d 70, 97 (2015). A declaration 
that "indicates that the basis for the information" is from an 
"external source" does not demonstrate that the statements are based on the declarant's personal knowledge. 
Id. at 29, 346 
P.3d at 98. "[I]f a statement in a declaration relies upon 
information provided by another person . . . it is not based on 
personal knowledge and is inadmissible as hearsay[.]" Id. at 27 
n.31, 346 P.3d at 96 n.31. 
An "affidavit consisting of 
inadmissible hearsay cannot serve as a basis for awarding or denying summary judgment." Id. at 28, 346 P.3d at 97 (citations omitted). 
Here, the Gray Declaration asserts that Ogomori 
confirmed to Gray that Owners agreed to the Exhibit 1 term sheet. This statement was not based on Gray's personal knowledge and is inadmissible hearsay. See id. Thus, although 
Gray "declare[d] under penalty of law that the [Gray 
9  
       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 Declaration] is true and correct[,]" this averment is 
insufficient to establish that Owners agreed to the Exhibit 1 
term sheet. See Miller v. Manuel, 9 Haw. App. 56, 66-69, 828 
P.2d 286, 293-95 (App. 1991) (finding a supplemental memorandum alleging that "the parties reached [a settlement] agreement," averred to be true "to the best of [counsel's] knowledge," was insufficient to support a motion to enforce settlement). Without the Gray Declaration's inadmissible statement that Ogomori confirmed to Gray that Owners agreed to the Exhibit 1 
term sheet, there is no evidence of such agreement. The Exhibit 
1 term sheet was not signed by Owners, and does not reflect their approval. In addition, the Exhibit 12 term sheet approved by the Association President contained multiple differences with, and was not identical to, the Exhibit 1 term sheet purported to represent the parties' agreement. See McKenna, 148 
Hawaiʻi at 242, 470 P.3d at 1119 (holding that "[t]he 
difference[s] between the proposed settlement agreement terms 
and the settlement conference terms evinces a genuine issue as to which terms were explicitly and implicitly agreed to at the settlement conference"). 
Accordingly, and viewing the evidence in the light 
most favorable to Owners, the Association failed to meet its initial summary judgment burden as movant to establish the existence of a settlement agreement. See Gilmartin, 10 Haw. App. at 296, 869 P.2d at 1351. 
The Circuit Court thus erred in 
concluding there were no genuine issues of material fact in granting the Association's first motion to enforce settlement. 
In McKenna, the 
Hawaiʻi Supreme Court held that "a trial court 
errs in granting a motion to enforce a settlement agreement when 
genuine issues of material fact exist regarding the existence and terms of the settlement agreement" and that "the circuit 
10  
       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   
  
 
 court must, at minimum, hold an evidentiary hearing as to those 
genuine issues of fact." 148 Hawai ʻi at 241, 470 P.3d at 1118. 
Here, because there are genuine issues of material fact as to 
the existence of a settlement agreement, the Circuit Court should have held an evidentiary hearing to resolve whether the parties had reached agreement "upon all of the essential and material terms," and whether there was "mutual assent" for a binding, enforceable agreement. See id. at 241-42, 470 P.3d at 
1118-19 (citation omitted). 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the April 24, 
2023 First Order Enforcing Settlement and the April 4, 2024 
Second Order Enforcing Settlement, both filed by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Summary Disposition Order.
