IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I 
MIKAEL KLEMME, Petitioner-Appellee, v.
CARMELA BURTELL and LAUREN BURTELL, Respondents-Appellants  
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
WAILUKU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 2DSS-21-0000358) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL AND 
DENYING ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Guidry, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Plaintiff-Appellee Mikael 
Klemme's (
Klemme) June 5, 2023 Motion to Dismiss Appeal and For 
Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs (Motion), the papers in 
support and in opposition, and the record, it appears that: 
(1) Klemme seeks dismissal of the appeal filed by self-
represented Defendants-Appellants Lauren Burtell and Carmela 
Burtell (Burtells) as untimely, and an award under Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) ยง 604-10.5(h) for attorneys' fees and costs 
incurred in bringing the Motion. 
(2)
 The Burtells filed their May 23, 2023 Notice of 
Appeal more than 30 days after entry of the District Court of the 
Second Circuit's December 20, 2021 Order Granting Petition for Injunction Against Harassment, which is outside of the deadline set forth in 
Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
4(a)(1). The record does not indicate that the Burtells received an extension of time to appeal under HRAP Rule 4(a)(4), or that the deadline was otherwise tolled by a timely-filed post-judgment NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
motion under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). Compliance with the requirement 
of timely filing a notice of appeal is jurisdictional. Grattafiori v. State
, 79 Hawai#i 10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 
(1995); 
see also HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice 
is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of these rules"). 
(3) The award of attorneys' fees and costs under HRS ยง 
604-10.5(h) is discretionary. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
granted in part and denied in part as follows: 
1. The appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
2. The request for attorneys' fees and costs is 
denied.
