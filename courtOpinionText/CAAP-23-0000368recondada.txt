IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
STATE OF HAWAI# I 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
O
SCAR KANOA, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CRIMINAL NO. 1CPC-22-0001037) 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION 
(
By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Defendant-Appellant Oscar Kanoa's 
(Kanoa) August 29, 2024 [Kanoa's] Motion for Reconsideration, it 
appears that Kanoa requests reconsideration of this court's 
August 19, 2024 Summary Disposition Order, arguing that the court erred by failing to analyze Kanoa's arguments based on the standard applicable to motions for judgment of acquittal. 
As argued by Kanoa, the Hawai#i Supreme Court has held: 
When reviewing a motion for judgment of acquittal, we
employ the same standard that a trial court applies to such
a motion, namely, whether, upon the evidence viewed in thelight most favorable to the prosecution and in fullrecognition of the province of the trier of fact, theevidence is sufficient to support a prima facie case so thata reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond areasonable doubt. Sufficient evidence to support a prima NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
facie case requires "substantial evidence" as to every
material element of the offense charged. "Substantial evidence" as to every material element of the offensecharged is credible evidence which is of sufficient qualityand probative value to enable a person of reasonable cautionto support a conclusion. Under such a review, we give "fullplay to the right of the fact finder to determinecredibility, weigh the evidence, and draw justifiableinferences of fact." 
State v. Angei, 152 Hawai# i 484, 492, 526 P.3d 461, 469 (2023) 
(citations omitted). 
On appeal, with respect to the motion for judgment of 
acquittal, Kanoa's argument was that the State presented no 
evidence that Bonnie Vierra's (Vierra's) life could have been 
saved with earlier medical intervention and no evidence that 
Kanoa failed to call for medical intervention at the first sign that Vierra was suffering from serious physical injury. Upon 
further and full consideration of, inter alia, this court's disposition and Kanoa's argument for reconsideration, we conclude 
that although the above-referenced standard was not specifically set forth in the summary form of disposition utilized in this case, it was properly analyzed and applied to the parties' arguments and the record in this case. Accordingly, we conclude that Kanoa fails to demonstrate that the court overlooked or misapprehended any point of law or fact when it issued the August 19, 2024 Summary Disposition Order. See 
Hawai#i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40(b).
