Mathern also challenges the Circuit Court's May 4, 2023 "Order 
Affirming Director's Decision and Order of May 5, 2022" (Order). 
The Order and Judgment affirmed the Director's May 5, 2022 
Decision and Order, which (1) adopted the findings of fact and conclusions of law contained in an administrative hearings officer's July 5, 2019 Recommended Decision, and (2) concluded that Mathern was not discharged by Employer solely because she suffered a work injury in alleged violation of Hawaii Revised

On appeal, Mathern contends that the Circuit Court: 
(1) erred in concluding that DLIR did not violate Mathern's due 
process rights when it delayed hearing and rendering a final decision on her claim; and (2) "ignored the substantial evidence and evidence of fraud by the [E]mployer" when the court affirmed the Director's conclusion that Mathern was not discharged solely because she suffered a work injury.

Our review of "decision[s] made by the circuit court 
upon its review of an agency's decision is a secondary appeal." Flores v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res., 143 Hawai# i 114, 120, 424 P.3d 
469, 475 (2018) (quoting Paul's Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Befitel, 104 Hawai#i 412, 416, 91 P.3d 494, 498 (2004)). We apply the 
standards set forth in HRS § 91-14(g) (2012 & Supp. 2019) to determine whether the Circuit Court's decision was right or wrong. Id. at 120-21, 424 P.3d at 475-76 (quoting Paul's Elec. 
Serv., 104 Hawai# i at 416, 91 P.3d at 498). 
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Mathern's contentions as follows, and affirm. 
2/ (HRS) § 378-32(a) (2015) states, in relevant part: 
(a) It shall be unlawful for any employer to suspend,
discharge, or discriminate against any of the employer'semployees: 
. . . . 
(2) Solely because the employee has suffered a work
injury which arose out of and in the course ofthe employee's employment with the employer andwhich is compensable under chapter 386 unlessthe employee is no longer capable of performingthe employee's work as a result of the workinjury and the employer has no other availablework which the employee is capable ofperforming. Any employee who is dischargedbecause of the work injury shall be given firstpreference of reemployment by the employer inany position which the employee is capable ofperforming and which becomes available after thedischarge and during the period thereafter untilthe employee secures new employment. . . . 
3/ Mathern's points of error, which are somewhat difficult to
discern, have been restated and reordered for clarity. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) Mathern contends that DLIR (and presumably the 
Director) violated her due process rights when it unreasonably 
delayed hearing and rendering a final decision on her claim. She argues that there were three periods of unreasonable delay, as follows: (1) a 21-month period from October 21, 2015, when Mathern filed her complaint with DLIR, through July 10, 2017, when she requested that DLIR schedule a hearing; (2) an 18-month period from August 16, 2017, when DLIR's then-Director explained to Mathern why her complaint had not proceeded to hearing, through February 1, 2019, when Mathern requested that the hearing officer "initiate proceedings against the Employer" (the hearing then went forward on May 14, 2019); and (3) a 33-month period from July 25, 2019, when Mathern filed her exceptions to the hearing officer's Recommended Decision, through May 5, 2022, when the Director's Decision and Order was issued. These periods coincide roughly with the passage of time between (1) the filing of the complaint and the hearing, and (2) the issuance of the hearing officer's Recommended Decision and the Director's Decision and Order. 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has stated that where an 
agency has followed all relevant administrative requirements, a substantial wait for an agency decision will not be deemed unreasonable unless "the delay was caused by an unjustified agency decision to postpone resolution of the matter or was so outside the bounds of the workings of a large and complex bureaucracy as to be deemed unreasonable per se
." Trivectra v. 
Ushijima, 112 Hawai# i 90, 109, 144 P.3d 1, 20 (2006). Further, a 
hearing officer has the authority to "[c]ontrol the procedures of the hearing[,]" and to "[t]ake other actions that are necessary and proper for the conduct of the hearing." Hawai#i
 
Administrative Rules (HAR) § 12-24-14(a)(1), (6) (effective 
1981). 
Based on the entire record, we conclude that DLIR did 
not violate Mathern's due process rights due to unreasonable 
delay in hearing and deciding her claim. Initially, Mathern has not shown that DLIR failed to follow any relevant administrative requirements. Regarding the alleged delays, as to the period 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
between the filing of the complaint and the hearing, the Director 
found that "the Hearing Officer properly stayed the hearing due to the pending determination as to whether [Mathern] suffered a work injury which arose out of and in the course of [Mathern's] employment with [Employer] and which was compensable under [HRS] chapter 386." Indeed, Mathern could not prevail on her claim under HRS § 378-32(a)(2) unless, among other things, she suffered a work injury "which is compensable under chapter 386." Mathern's workers' compensation claim was closed in January 2019, and the hearing officer held a hearing on her HRS § 378-32 claim in May 2019. We cannot conclude that in these circumstances, the hearing officer's decision, in the exercise of his discretion, to wait for a full and final resolution of the workers' compensation claim before proceeding with the section 378-32 hearing was unjustified or "so outside the bounds of the workings of [DLIR] as to be deemed unreasonable per se." Trivectra, 112 Hawai# i at 
109, 144 P.3d at 20; cf. Puchert v. Agsalud, 67 Haw. 25, 37 n.5, 677 P.2d 449, 458 n.5 (1984) (construing predecessor version of HRS § 378-33(b): "Continuing a hearing, rather than dismissing a complaint, avoids the problem of having to re-file and re-process the same paperwork."). 
As to the period between the issuance of the hearing 
officer's Recommended Decision and the Director's Decision and Order, DLIR's then-Director explained in a February 24, 2020 letter to Mathern's counsel that DLIR was reviewing the entire case file and recorded proceedings of the July 5, 2019 hearing before issuing a final decision and order. Such a review was authorized by HAR § 12-24-15(c) ("Upon filing of exceptions by a party adversely affected by the recommended decision, the director may consider the whole record or portions thereof . . . [and] then make a final decision stating the reasons or basis therefor and enter an appropriate order."). The Director asserted below and now on appeal that the COVID-19 pandemic, of which we take judicial notice, also played a significant role in the delay. We cannot conclude that in these circumstances the delay between the issuance of the hearing officer's Recommended Decision and the Director's Decision and Order was unjustified or

"so outside the bounds of the workings of [DLIR] as to be deemed 
unreasonable per se." Trivectra, 112 Hawai# i at 109, 144 P.3d at 
20. 
In any event, Mathern has not shown that she suffered 
any prejudice as a result of the delays she cites, particularly in light of the finding that her position with Employer was eliminated. See infra; S. Foods Grp., L.P. v. State, Dep't of 
Educ., 89 Hawai# i 443, 453, 974 P.2d 1033, 1043 (1999) (to 
reverse or modify an agency decision under HRS § 91–14(g), "the appellate court must conclude that an appellant's substantial rights were prejudiced by the agency."). On this record, the Circuit Court did not err in concluding that DLIR (and the Director) did not violate Mathern's due process rights. 
(2) Mathern contends that the Circuit Court erred when 
it "ignored the substantial evidence and evidence of fraud by [E]mployer at the agency level" and ruled: 
The DLIR was not clearly erroneous by ignoring the
allegedly substantial evidence in support of [Mathern's]
returning to work. The [Certified Record on Appeal]supports the decision that [Employer] gave [Mathern] sevenmonths of leave, and that it eliminated her position due toa legitimate business purpose as the Pahoa branch officeclosed and [Employer] did not have a role for [Mathern] toreturn to after her leave of absence. 
The Director adopted the following findings of fact by 
the hearing officer, none of which Mathern expressly contests in 
her opening brief, see Poe v. Haw. Labor Rels. Bd., 97 Hawai# i 
528, 536, 40 P.3d 930, 938 (2002) (ruling that an agency's unchallenged findings are binding on appeal): 
3. [Mathern] was hired on March 18, 2014, as a Branch
Office Administrator (BOA). 
4. [Mathern] worked in the Pahoa office with one otheremployee, a Financial Advisor (FA). 
5. On January 2, 2015, during her employment with[Employer], [Mathern] suffered a work injury. 
6. [Mathern's] last day of work was February 10, 2015. 
7. [Mathern] filed for workers' compensation on April 12,2015. The work injury was found to be compensableunder Chapter 386, HRS. As a result, [Mathern]collected temporary disability benefits based on anaverage weekly wage rate of $640.00 as determined bythe Disability Compensation Division decision datedJuly 15, 2015.

8. [Employer] placed [Mathern] on federal Family Medical
Leave (FMLA) on her one-year employment anniversary,March 18, 2015. The 12 weeks of job protected leaveexpired on June 10, 2015. [Employer] extended[Mathern's] leave through September 10, 2015. 
9. Between February 13, 2015 through September 30, 2015,[Mathern] was off duty from work. 
10. On September 23, 2015, [Mathern] was discharged by[Employer] via letter, and informed she could re-applyfor employment once she was released to return towork. [Mathern] received the letter on September 28,2015 by United Parcel Service. 
11. On September 25, 2015, Peter E. Diamond, M.D. opinedthat [Mathern] could now return to work withrestrictions based on his earlier June 11, 2015,independent medical examination (IME) of [Mathern]. 
12. On September 28, 2015, Dr. Kurt Halverson, D.C.,[Mathern's] personal workers' compensation doctorstill placed [Mathern] off duty from work betweenOctober 1-31, 2015. 
13. On October 21, 2015, [Mathern] filed her complaintwith the Wage Standards Division. 
14. Throughout 2015 and 2016, [Mathern] continued toreceive medical treatment for the work-related injury. 
15. On October 11, 2016, [Mathern] was released by herworkers' compensation doctor to return to workbeginning November 1, 2016, with specific workrestrictions detailed in the September 21, 2016Functional Capacity Evaluation Report from CHART Rehabattached. An additional restriction was added effective April 1, 2017. [Mathern] continues toreceive occupational therapy for her injury. 
(Record citations omitted.) 
The Director also relied on the hearing officer's 
discussion of the relevant facts, which included the following 
additional relevant findings: 
[Mathern] and [Employer] agree that due to the
impending Kilauea lava flow from December 19, 2014, the
Pahoa office was temporarily closed. [Mathern] and the FAwere temporarily located to the Hilo Shopping Center officefrom December 22, 2014, to January 2015. Once the lava flow stopped, the equipment was moved back from the Hilo officeinto the Pahoa office with the intent to re-open the Pahoaoffice. However, the Pahoa office never reopened. 
During January 2015, the plan was to re-open the Pahoa
office, however, before reopening the Pahoa office, the HiloFA decided to retire, and the Pahoa FA decided to take overthat office. The Hilo office already had an employee in theBOA position, therefore the [Mathern] would not have beeneligible to transfer with the FA. Because the FA relocated,the [Employer] permanently closed the Pahoa office, and thatoffice remains closed to this day.

Under HRS § 378-32(a)(2), it is unlawful for an 
employer "to suspend, discharge, or discriminate against any of 
the employer's employees . . . [s]olely because the employee has suffered a work injury which arose out of and in the course of the employee's employment with the employer . . . ." However, HRS § 378-32(a)(2) contains a "limited exception" that allows an employer to "suspend, discharge, or discriminate against" an employee "[s]olely because the employee has suffered a work injury" if "the employee is no longer capable of performing the employee's work as a result of the work injury and the employer has no other available work which the employee is capable of performing." BCI Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Los 
Angeles, Inc. v. Murakami, 145 Hawai# i 38, 44 n.9, 445 P.3d 710, 
716 n.9 (2019) (quoting predecessor statute HRS § 378-32(2)). Thus, an employer does not violate the statute: 
(1) "if it 
discriminates against [or discharges] an employee for a legitimate reason" or (2) the employee is no longer capable of performing the employee's work as a result of the work injury and the employer has no other available work which the employee is capable of performing. Id. at 45, 445 P.3d at 717. 
"[A] 
'legitimate' reason must be one that is justifiable in view of the purpose of the statute," which is to protect employees who suffer work injuries "by ensuring that they are restored to their position or placed in a commensurate position when they return from a work-related injury." Id. (original brackets omitted) 
(quoting Adams v. CDM Media USA, Inc., 135 Hawai# i 1, 15, 346 
P.3d 70, 84 (2015), and citing S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 782, in 1981 Senate Journal, at 1249; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 580, in 1981 House Journal, at 1179). 
Here, the hearing officer concluded that both: (1) 
Employer did not discharge Mathern solely because she had suffered a covered work injury (i.e., there was a legitimate reason to discharge her); and (2) Mathern was no longer capable of performing her work as a result of the work injury when she was discharged, and Employer had no work for her once she was released by her doctor to return to work.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
As to the former conclusion, i.e., the legitimate 
reason, the hearing officer reasoned: "[Mathern's incumbent FA 
at [the] Pahoa office chose not to return to the Pahoa office, and relocated to the Hilo office when the FA at that location retired. There was already a BOA at that site, and no other vacant BOA position existed there or at any other location on the island of Hawaii." The Director relied on this same reasoning in the Decision and Order. This reasoning is based on the hearing officer's relevant factual findings, which were supported by substantial evidence. In particular, Steven Rarick, Employer's Department Leader of Associate Relations, confirmed in his testimony that the Pahoa office location was temporarily closed following the 2014-15 lava flow; a temporary move was made to the Hilo office; in March 2015, when the Hilo FA retired, the Pahoa FA combined her business with the Hilo FA; the Pahoa FA relocated her office to the Hilo location, and the Pahoa office permanently closed; there was a BOA working at the Hilo office; the FA and the BOA are the only two employees in that location; and there were no other available BOA positions on Hawai# i Island. For her 
part, Mathern could not explain in her testimony why she believes she was discharged solely due to her injury and stated she did not know why she was terminated. 
On appeal, Mathern argues in part that she was capable 
of returning to work and performing her duties when she was discharged. We need not decide this issue, however, as substantial evidence supports the Director's conclusion that Employer did not discharge Mathern solely because she had suffered a covered work injury. See supra. 
Mathern also argues that Employer actually discharged 
her because she had exhausted her FMLA. Mathern claims that Employer later took the "inconsistent position" that the Pahoa office was closed and there was no position left for her, which Mathern also characterizes as "fraud." These arguments raise factual issues that turn on the hearing officer's resolution of any conflicts in the witnesses' testimony or other evidence. "[C]ourts decline to consider the weight of the evidence to ascertain whether it weighs in favor of the administrative

findings, or to review the agency's findings of fact by passing 
upon the credibility of witnesses or conflicts in testimony . . . ." In re Hawaiian Elec. Co., 81 Hawai# i 459, 465, 918 P.2d 
561, 567 (1996) (citing In re Hawaiian Elec. Light Co., 60 Haw. 625, 629, 594 P.2d 612, 617 (1979)). 
Here, the hearing officer, "[h]aving reviewed the 
evidence presented by the parties and having observed the demeanor of those who testified," determined that Mathern was not discharged solely due to her work injury, in that Employer's Pahoa office was permanently closed in early 2015 and there were no other available positions for her on Hawai# i Island. Mathern 
has not shown that these mixed determinations of fact and law, which the Director adopted, were "[c]learly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record[.]"
4/ HRS § 91-14(g)(5) (2012 & Supp. 2019). 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err in affirming 
the Director's Decision and Order. 
For the reasons discussed above, the Final Judgment 
entered on October 27, 2025, in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
