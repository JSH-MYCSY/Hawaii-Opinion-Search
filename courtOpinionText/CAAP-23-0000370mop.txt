(CIVIL NO. 1CCV-22-0000613) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION  
(By: 
Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.) 
Plaintiffs-Appellants Kallie L. Curtis, Daniel J. 
Curtis (Kallie's Father), and Nubia Lizeth Curtis (Kallie's Mother) (collectively, the Curtis Family  ) appeal from the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit's May 30, 2023 Final   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 
    
 Judgment.1 On appeal, the Curtis Family challenges the circuit 
court's denial of spoliation sanctions, grant of summary 
judgment, and award of attorneys' fees. We affirm. 
I. BACKGROUND 
The underlying facts of this case are largely 
undisputed. Jean-Marcel Clouzet (Mr. Clouzet) taught Bible Studies at Hawaiian Mission Academy, a parochial school 
affiliated with the Hawai‘ i Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists 
(the Conference 
). In February 2022, Mr. Clouzet invited his 
wife (Mrs. Clouzet) to speak to the Bible Studies class about 
marriage and relationships. 
During the discussion, a student asked a question 
related to white privilege. According to Kallie's deposition, Mrs. Clouzet stated she herself benefited from white privilege 
and pointed Kallie out, saying she had it too. Kallie 
identifies as non-white/Hispanic. 
The next day, Kallie's Father emailed the principal of 
Hawaiian Mission Academy, Joe Lee (
Principal Lee), expressing 
that he found the incident "to be beyond offensive." He reminded Principal Lee they were assured "that those type of 
race views had no place at" Hawaiian Mission Academy. Kallie's Father stated that "nothing short of [Mr. Clouzet's] near 
1 The Honorable Gary W.B. Chang presided. We note that Kallie was 
eighteen years old at the time of the incident. 
2   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 
  
 immediate resignation or termination from [Hawaiian Mission 
Academy] would be a satisfactory resolution." 
By February 17, 2022, eight days after the incident, 
Mr. Clouzet had been fired. His personnel folder, which was 
allegedly empty, was later destroyed by Principal Lee. The 
Curtis Family brought a civil action seeking in excess of 
$5,778,000.00 in damages arising from the incident. 
Defendants-Appellees the Conference; Hawaiian Mission 
Academy; Ralph S. Watts, III, former president of the Conference 
(former President Watts); Erik Vandenburgh, the Conference president that succeeded former President Watts (President 
Vandenburgh); Jay Warren, deputy to the Conference president 
(Deputy Warren); Rhonda "Miki" L. Nelson, the Conference 
Superintendent of Education (Superintendent Nelson); Principal 
Lee; and Mr. and Mrs. Clouzet (collectively, Defendants) moved 
to dismiss all claims. 
The circuit court dismissed Kallie's Mother's and 
Father's claims against Mr. and Mrs. Clouzet but denied without prejudice dismissal of all other claims against Defendants to 
allow the Curtis Family to conduct discovery.
2 Following the 
2 The Curtis Family did not appeal the dismissal of Kallie's Mother's 
and Father's claims against Mr. and Mrs. Clouzet, nor did they challenge the 
circuit court's grant of summary judgment on Counts V (Breach of Contract), 
VII (Civil Conspiracy), or VIII (Loss of Consortium). 
 (continued . . . )

 (. . . continued) 
 
     
   close of discovery, Defendants moved seriatim to dismiss each 
count, which the circuit court granted. On May 30, 2023, the 
circuit court entered Final Judgment against the Curtis Family 
and in favor of Defendants. The Curtis Family appeals from the 
Final Judgment.  
II.  DISCUSSION 
On appeal, the Curtis Family challenges (1) the denial 
of spoliation sanctions; (2) the granting of summary judgment as to Counts I (Negligence), II (Negligent Supervision), 
III (Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED)), IV (Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)), and 
VI (Defamation); and (3) the award of attorneys' fees. We 
affirm. 
A. No Abuse in Denying Spoliation Sanctions 
First, the Curtis Family contends the circuit court 
"abused its discretion by not sanctioning [Defendants] and/or by 
not providing a remedy . . . in the form of a spoliation presumption." (Formatting altered.) According to the Curtis 
Family, the circuit court "should have issued a 'spoliation 
presumption' that [Mr. Clouzet]'s 'empty' personnel file 
The circuit court also dismissed all claims in Count I (Negligence) 
that were premised on a theory of educational negligence, which is not 
actionable under Hawai‘i law. See 
Nakamura v. Univ. of Hawai‘i, 145 Hawai‘i 
295, 451 P.3d 875, No. CAAP- 16-0000095, 2019 WL 5849790, at *5 n.5 
(App. Nov. 7, 2019) (mem. op.). 
4   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   
 
 
  contained evidence supportive of each count as they pertain to 
[Mr. Clouzet] and his legal relationships with every other" 
Defendant. 
We review a circuit court's decision regarding 
sanctions based on spoliation for an abuse of discretion. 
Stender v. Vincent
, 92 Hawai‘i 355, 362, 992 P.2d 50, 57 (2000). 
In 
Richardson v. Sport Shinko (Waikiki Corp.)
, the 
Hawai‘i Supreme Court explained its rationale for upholding 
spoliation sanctions in an earlier case, 
Wong v. City & County 
of Honolulu, 66 Haw. 389, 665 P.2d 157 (1983): 
[K]ey to our holding in Wong was: (1) the City's 
culpability in destroying a piece of potentially critical 
evidence formally requested in discovery; (2) the resulting 
prejudice to the plaintiffs' case; and (3) the inequity 
that would occur in allowing the City to accrue a benefit 
from its conduct. 
Richardson , 76 Hawai‘i 494, 507, 880 P.2d 169, 182 (1994) 
(emphasis added). 
Here, the circuit court concluded that the Curtis 
Family failed to carry their burden as to all three "elements" 
under 
Richardson because nothing in the record suggested that 
anything other than an empty folder was destroyed. As to the first element, the circuit court concluded that the Curtis 
Family failed to establish that the folder contained any 
evidence, let alone "potentially critical evidence." 
5
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 Indeed, the record does not show that "potentially 
critical evidence" was destroyed. Principal Lee testified that 
the folder he destroyed was empty. The Curtis Family did not 
controvert that testimony. As the circuit court described, the 
Curtis Family "had other discovery opportunities that they 
refused or failed to pursue," such as deposing other school 
employees working in the office with access to the records. The 
circuit court also noted the Curtis Family could have questioned 
Principal Lee "in greater detail during his deposition" but did 
not. 
Because the Curtis Family failed to prove this first 
element, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by denying their requested spoliation relief. 
B. No Error in Granting Summary Judgment 
Next, the Curtis Family challenges the circuit court's 
granting of summary judgment on Counts I (Negligence), 
II (Negligent Supervision), III (NIED), IV (IIED), and VI (Defamation). 
We review the grant or denial of summary judgment de 
novo. Hilo Bay Marina, LLC v. State
, 156 Hawai‘i 478, 486, 
575 P.3d 568, 576 (2025). 
A defendant movant "may satisfy his or her initial 
burden of production by either (1) presenting evidence negating an element of the non-movant's claim, or (2) demonstrating that 
6
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  the nonmovant will be unable to carry his or her burden of proof 
at trial." Ralston v. Yim, 129 Hawai‘ i 46, 60, 292 P.3d 1276, 
1290 (2013). "Where the movant attempts to meet his or her 
burden through the latter means, he or she must show not only 
that the nonmovant has not placed proof in the record, but also that the movant will be unable to offer proof at trial." Id.
 at 
60-61, 292 P.3d at 1290-91 (emphasis omitted). 
"Only when the moving party satisfies its initial 
burden of production does the burden shift to the non-moving party to respond to the motion for summary judgment and 
demonstrate specific facts, as opposed to general allegations, 
that present a genuine issue worthy of trial." French v. Hawaii
Pizza Hut, Inc., 105 Hawai‘ i 462, 470, 99 P.3d 1046, 1054 (2004) 
(emphasis omitted). 
1. Count I (Negligence) 
As to Count I, the Curtis Family contends there was a 
genuine issue of material fact as to whether Mr. Clouzet, 
Mrs. Clouzet, or Principal Lee "breached their admitted duty of 
care to Kallie." (Emphasis omitted.) 
The Curtis Family relies 
on the following: Mrs. Clouzet "was an unauthorized guest 
speaker, that Principal Lee was unaware that she was in 
[Mr. Clouzet's] classroom, that [Mr. and Mrs. Clouzet] singled 
out Kallie based on the color of her skin, and that 
[Mr. Clouzet], per his own confession, 'was not paying 
7   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
  attention' to what [Mrs. Clouzet] was saying." (Emphasis 
omitted.) 
We note that the Curtis Family makes no argument 
regarding any of the Defendants apart from Mr. and Mrs. Clouzet.3 
See Hawai‘ i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(7) 
("Points not argued may be deemed waived."). We further note 
that the circuit court dismissed Kallie's Mother's and Father's 
claims against Mr. and Mrs. Clouzet. Thus, we address Kallie's 
claim against Mr. and Mrs. Clouzet. 
A successful negligence claim requires proving 
(1)
duty, (2) breach, (3) causation, and (4) damages. Doe
Parents No. 1 v. State, Dep't of Educ. (Doe Parents), 100 Hawai‘ i 
34, 68, 58 P.3d 545, 579 (2002). 
Our appellate caselaw has 
sustained negligent failure to protect claims against businesses and hotels involving foreseeable criminal acts causing injury to 
a patron or an employee. E.g., Knodle v. Waikiki Gateway Hotel,Inc., 69 Haw. 376, 742 P.2d 377 (1987); Maguire v. Hilton Hotels
Corp., 79 Hawai‘ i 110, 899 P.2d 393 (1995); Moyle v. Y & Y Hyup 
Shin, Corp., 118 Hawai‘ i 385, 191 P.3d 1062 (2008). Similarly, 
3 The Curtis Family expressly asserted all eight c ounts against all 
Defendants.  To the extent the Curtis Family challenges Final Judgment in 
favor of Hawaiian Mission Academy, the Conference, former President Watts, 
President Vandenburgh, Deputy Warren, or Superintendent Nelson on any of the 
Counts, we conclude that the circuit court did not err because the Curtis Family failed to adduce material evidence to support their claims, as 
discussed infra Section II.C. 2. 
8   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   our appellate courts have sustained negligent failure to protect 
claims against state agencies where they have failed to protect 
children under their care from sexual assault or physical abuse. 
E.g., Doe Parents
, 100 Hawai‘i at 86, 58 P.3d at 597; 
Kaho
ʻohanohano v. Dep't of Hum. Servs.
, 117 Hawai‘i 262, 178 P.3d 
538 (2008). 
In moving for summary judgment, Defendants asserted 
the Curtis Family could not prove Mr. and Mrs. Clouzet breached 
their duty to care for Kallie. 
Defendants argued that Kallie's 
own testimony showed Mr. Clouzet did not verbally berate, assault, or harass Kallie. Defendants also argued that 
Mrs. Clouzet's comments were not intended to be malicious, and 
the topic of white privilege came from a student question. 
Defendants cited persuasive authority that such 
statements, without more, are not actionable under a negligent 
failure to protect claim in an educational setting. See
generally Walsh v. Tehachapi Unified Sch. Dist., 827 F. Supp. 2d 
1107, 1115, 1124-25 (E.D. Cal. 2011) (dismissing for failure to 
state a claim for negligent failure to protect in a case arising 
from a student's suicide where a teacher allegedly called the 
student "fruity" in front of a classroom of students). 
9
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  In sum, Defendants demonstrated that the Curtis Family 
could not sustain their burden of showing Mr. and Mrs. Clouzet 
breached a duty to care for Kallie. The burden then shifted to 
the Curtis Family to provide specific facts showing Mr. and 
Mrs. Clouzet breached their duty of care. The Curtis Family did 
not. 
And we could find no controlling authority suggesting 
that isolated statements by a guest speaker in an educational 
setting, offensive though they may be, constitute a breach of 
duty to care for a student. 
2. Count II (Negligent Supervision) 
As to Count II, the Curtis Family argues that it was 
for the trier of fact to determine "whether [Mr. Clouzet] was 
acting 'outside' or 'within' the scope of his employment on February 9, 2022." And, "whether [Mr. Clouzet] was acting 
within or without the scope of his employment must be informed 
by the evidence that: (1) [Mrs. Clouzet] is not an employee of 
[Hawaiian Mission Academy] or [the Conference]; 
(2) [Mr. Clouzet] was not authorized to bring [Mrs. Clouzet] to 
speak; and (3) Principal Lee was unaware of 'what's going on on 
campus'." 
As discussed above, the Curtis Family failed to 
present specific facts showing Mr. and Mrs. Clouzet breached their duty of care to Kallie. It thus follows that Mr. Clouzet, 
10
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 as Mrs. Clouzet's supervisor, and Principal Lee, as 
Mr. Clouzet's supervisor, would not be liable for Mrs. Clouzet's 
statements. See Pulawa v. GTE Hawaiian Tel, 112 Hawai‘ i 3, 18, 
143 P.3d 1205, 1220 (2006). 
Moreover, "negligent supervision may only be found 
where an employee is acting outside the scope of his or her 
employment." Id. (quoting Dairy Rd. Partners v. Island Ins.
Co., 92 Hawai‘ i 398, 427, 992 P.2d 93, 122 (2000)).  The Hawai‘ i 
Supreme Court adopted the approach of the Restatement (Second) 
of Agency to determine whether a servant acts within the scope 
of employment: 
In Henderson, we cited the Restatement (Second) of Agency 
§ 228 (1958) for the definition of "scope of employment": 
(1) Conduct of a servant is within the scope of 
employment if, but only if: 
(a) it is of the kind he is employed to 
perform; 
(b) it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space limits; [and] 
(c) it is actuated, at least in part, by a 
purpose to serve the master[.] 
    .
. . . 
(2) Conduct of a servant is not within the scope of 
employment if it is different in kind from that 
authorized, far beyond the authorized time or space limits, or too little actuated by a 
purpose to serve the master. 
Wong-Leong v. Hawaiian Indep. Refinery, Inc., 76 Hawai‘i 433, 
438, 879 P.2d 538, 543 (1994) (alterations in original). 
11   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 At summary judgment, Defendants argued that the Curtis 
Family was estopped from arguing that Mr. and Mrs. Clouzet were 
acting outside the scope of their employment because the First 
Amended Complaint alleged that Defendants were "at all relevant 
times . . . acting within the course and scope of their duties 
as employees."4 Defendants are correct; the Curtis Family made 
no claim that Mr. Clouzet acted outside the scope of his employment. 
Nonetheless, we note that nothing in the record 
suggested Mr. Clouzet acted outside the scope of his employment. He was a pastor at the Seventh-Day Adventist Church in Wahiawā 
and a Bible Studies teacher at Hawaiian Mission Academy since 
2019. He was teaching a class he was required (incidentally, 
also as a volunteer) to teach in the classroom he was assigned 
during the normal class time. See id.
The Curtis Family presented no specific facts showing 
Mr. Clouzet was prohibited from engaging a guest speaker, or that Mr. Clouzet's actions were "far beyond the authorized time 
or space limits, or too little actuated by a purpose to serve 
the master." See id. 
4 The Curtis Family requested that this court strike Defendants' 
reproduction of the relevant portion of the First Amended Complaint from 
Defendants' Answering Brief. Because the First Amended Complaint is in the 
record, the request is denied. 
12   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
  Based on the foregoing, the circuit court did not err 
in granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants on Count II. 
3. Count III (NIED) 
As to Count III, the Curtis Family argues the circuit 
court erred in not finding Kallie's cutting was a sufficient 
physical injury to survive summary judgment. 
The Hawai‘ i Supreme Court explained in Doe Parents that 
"an NIED claim is nothing more than a negligence claim in which the alleged actual injury is wholly psychic and is analyzed 
'utilizing ordinary negligence principles.'" 100 Hawai‘ i at 69, 
58 P.3d at 580 (quoting Larsen v. Pacesetter Sys., Inc., 
74 Haw. 1, 41, 837 P.2d 1273, 1293, reconsideration granted in 
part and denied in part, 74 Haw. 650, 843 P.2d 144 (1992)). 
Thus, the Doe Parents court explained that the ordinary elements 
of a negligence claim apply. Id. at 71, 58 P.3d at 582. 
Although the Curtis Family focuses on the injury 
element, their NIED claim fails for the same reason their 
negligence claim fails: the Curtis Family failed to 
"demonstrate specific facts, as opposed to general allegations, 
that present a genuine issue worthy of trial" on the breach 
element of their negligence claims. See French
, 105 Hawai‘i at 
470, 99 P.3d at 1054 (emphasis omitted). 
13   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 Thus, even when viewing the evidence in the light most 
favorable to the Curtis Family, we cannot conclude the circuit 
court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants 
on Count III. 
4. Count IV (IIED) 
As to Count IV, the Curtis Family argues the circuit 
court erred in determining that Mrs. Clouzet's statement that 
Kallie benefited from white privilege was not outrageous and 
that, given Kallie's young age, Mrs. Clouzet's position of power 
as a guest speaker, the public nature and classroom setting of 
her statement, as well as its racial quality, the issue should 
have been put to a jury. 
A successful IIED claim requires proof that the 
conduct (1) was intentional or reckless, (2) was outrageous, and (3)
caused (4) "extreme emotional distress to another." Goran
Pleho, LLC v. Lacy, 144 Hawai‘ i 224, 237, 439 P.3d 176, 189 
(2019). 
"The term 'outrageous' has been construed to mean 
without just cause or excuse and beyond all bounds of decency." 
Id. (quoting Enoka v. AIG Hawai‘ i Ins. Co., 109 Hawai‘ i 537, 559, 
128 P.3d 850, 872 (2006)). 
The Hawai‘ i Supreme Court has further 
explained that "[t]here is 'no clear definition of the 
prohibited outrageous conduct,' and the correct inquiry is 
simply whether 'an average member of the community' would 
14   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 exclaim, 'Outrageous!'" Id. at 238, 439 P.3d at 190 (quoting 
Young v. Allstate Ins. Co., 119 Hawai‘ i 403, 425, 198 P.3d 666, 
688 (2008)). 
Courts have held that, "although '[r]acial 
discrimination can amount to extreme or outrageous conduct,' 
Park v. Hyatt Corp., 436 F. Supp. 2d 60, 65 (D.D.C. 2006), that 
is typically only the case where there is a 'pattern of 
harassment,' as opposed to 'a few isolated incidents,' Paul v. 
Howard Univ., 754 A.2d 297, 308 (D.C. 2000)." 
Bonner v. S-Fer
Int'l, Inc., 207 F. Supp. 3d 19, 25 (D.D.C. 2016); accord Silvav. Town of Uxbridge, 771 F. Supp. 3d 56, 75 (D. Mass. 2025) 
("[P]assive conduct and isolated remarks do not form the basis for an IIED claim."). Additionally, "[t]he question whether the
actions of the alleged tortfeasor are unreasonable or outrageous 
is for the court in the first instance, although where 
reasonable people may differ on that question it should be left 
to the jury." Goran Pleho, 144 Hawai‘ i at 237, 439 P.3d at 189 
(emphasis added) (quoting Young, 119 
Hawai‘i at 429, 198 P.3d at 
692). 
At summary judgment, Defendants, citing commentary to 
the Restatement (Second) of Torts
 § 46, argued there was "no 
evidence that any of the Defendants engaged in any outrageous 
acts," and "liability clearly does not extend to mere insults 
[or] indignities." 
15   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
  Stating Kallie benefited from white privilege was not 
outrageous. 
The burden then shifted to the Curtis Family to 
provide specific facts showing Defendants engaged in outrageous 
conduct. The Curtis Family did not. 
Thus, even when viewing the evidence in the light most 
favorable to the Curtis Family, we cannot conclude the circuit 
court erred in exercising its gatekeeper role, consistent with 
our caselaw, by granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants 
on Count IV. 
5. Count VI (Defamation) 
As to Count VI, the Curtis Family argues the circuit 
court erred in granting summary judgment "because telling a 
class full of 'non-white looking' teenagers that the one 'white 
looking' girl has a privilege over the rest of them could very well create resentment against the poor girl, thereby 'harming 
her reputation' and 'lowering her in the estimation' of her 
classmates." (Emphasis omitted.) 
Although the Curtis Family claimed the white privilege 
statement was defamatory in their First Amended Complaint, they 
abandoned that claim during the April 25, 2023 hearing on 
Defendants' summary judgment motion as to Count VI. During the hearing, counsel for the Curtis Family stated: 
16
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
   
  • "[H]ow both Court and the counsel are setting 
each other up for this straw man's argument as if 
that we are claiming that the white privilege was 
the defamatory comment. We didn't." 
• "I specifically said it's the comment where 
[Mr. Clouzet] called Kallie white is defamatory." 
• "Why are we engaging in straw man arguments, oh, 
counsel, do you think white privilege is 
defamatory? Oh, I don't think so, Judge. We 
never claimed that." 
• "[W]hy are we focusing on white privilege?" 
• "We never said anything about white privilege. That was regarding other issues. Here defamatory comment -- I'm going to make the record clear and 
then you can go ahead and decide whatever you're 
going to decide. Our defamatory comments are 
based on the fact that [Mr. Clouzet] specifically 
said she's white when she wasn't . . . and, two, that he lied about their church attendance. 
That's it."
5 
5 The Curtis Family makes no argument on appeal that the statement that 
Kallie was "white" or Mr. Clouzet's statements regarding the Curtis Family's 
church attendance were defamatory and therefore waive any such argument. See 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). 
17   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 
 
  
   Based on the Curtis Family's arguments during the 
hearing, they waived any claim that the white privilege 
statement was defamatory. Thus, we decline to address their 
contention as to this issue on appeal. 
C. No Abuse in Awarding Attorneys' Fees 
Finally, the Curtis Family challenges the circuit 
court's award of attorneys' fees under Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes 
(HRS) §§ 607-14 (2016) (Assumpsit) and -14.5 (2016) (Frivolousness).
6 
"The trial court's grant or denial of attorney's fees 
and costs is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard." 
Maunalua Bay Beach Ohana 28 v. State, 157 Hawai‘ i 150, 156, 
575 P.3d 783, 789 (2025) (quoting Sierra Club v. Dep't of Transp. (Superferry II), 120 Hawai‘ i 181, 197, 202 P.3d 1226, 
1242 (2009)). 
1. HRS § 607-14 (Assumpsit) 
The Curtis Family argues that the circuit court erred 
in awarding attorneys' fees incurred while litigating Count V 
under HRS § 607-14 because the circuit court determined that the 
claim did not sound in contract but instead in tort. Defendants 
counter that the nature and character of Count V as plead 
6 Although the Curtis Family challenges the award of costs in their 
points of error, they make no argument on this issue. Thus, we deem any 
challenge to costs waived.  See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). 
18   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  required them to defend the claim as though it was in the nature 
of assumpsit. 
HRS § 607-14 authorizes the award of reasonable 
attorneys' fees against the losing party "in three types of 
cases: (1) all actions in the nature of assumpsit; (2) all 
actions on a promissory note; and (3) contracts in writing that 
provides [sic] for an attorney's fee." Eastman v. McGowan
, 
86 Hawai‘i 21, 31, 946 P.2d 1317, 1327 (1997).  The Hawai‘ i 
Supreme Court provided guidance for determining when a claim is 
"in the nature of assumpsit" under HRS § 607-14: 
In ascertaining the nature of the proceeding on appeal, 
this court has looked to the essential character of the 
underlying action in the trial court. The character of the 
action should be determined from the facts and issues 
raised in the complaint, the nature of the entire grievance, and the relief sought. Where there is doubt as 
to whether an action is in assumpsit or in tort, there is a 
presumption that the suit is in assumpsit. 
Blair v. Ing , 96 Hawai‘i 327, 332, 31 P.3d 184, 189 (2001) 
(citation modified). 
Here, the Curtis Family raised eight counts in their 
First Amended Complaint. 
Of those eight counts, Count V 
expressly claimed breach of contract. The Curtis Family stated 
they paid about $14,000.00 for Kallie's tuition, and that 
tuition served as a contract "for the specific educational 
services and religion instruction." 
In defending against Count V, Defendants asserted that 
there was no contract, and Count V is "nothing more than a 
19   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
   restated negligent education claim." In the alternative, 
Defendants argued that even if a contract existed, they did not 
breach that contract. 
The circuit court granted summary judgment in 
Defendants' favor. Thus, the Curtis Family lost on Count V, and 
they did not appeal the circuit court's decision on Count V. 
Defendants sought $446,716.17 in fees, inclusive of 
general excise tax. The circuit court concluded that "a fair 
and reasonable way to apportion Defendants' attorneys' fees is 
to pro rate the attorneys' fees equally among all of the eight claims." The circuit court found that one-eighth of the fees 
requested was $55,839.52.
7 See id. ("[I]n awarding attorneys' 
fees in a case involving both assumpsit and non-assumpsit claims, a court must base its award of fees, if practicable, on 
an apportionment of the fees claimed between assumpsit and non-
assumpsit claims."). 
In sum, as pled, Count V was in the nature of 
assumpsit. That Defendants successfully defended the claim on the basis that there was no contract and the Curtis Family was 
merely repackaging a tort claim does not render a request for 
attorneys' fees under HRS § 607-14 invalid. 
7 $446,716.17 ÷ 8 = $55,839.52.

 Thus, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion 
in awarding attorneys' fees in favor of Defendants on Count V. 
2. HRS § 607-14.5 (Frivolousness) 
The Curtis Family also argues that the circuit court 
abused its discretion in awarding attorneys' fees under HRS 
§ 607-14.5  as frivolous because the circuit court's findings of 
frivolousness were insufficient to support its award of attorneys' fees. 8
8 HRS § 607-14.5, "Attorneys' fees and costs in civil actions ," 
provides: 
(a) In any civil action in this State where a party 
seeks money damages or injunctive relief, or both, against 
another party, and the case is subsequently decided, the 
court may, as it deems just, assess against either party, 
whether or not the party was a prevailing party, and enter as part of its order, for which execution may issue, a 
reasonable sum for attorneys' fees and costs, in an amount 
to be determined by the court upon a specific finding that 
all or a portion of the party's claim or defense was frivolous as provided in subsection (b). 
(b) In determining the award of attorneys' fees and 
costs and the amounts to be awarded, the court must find in 
writing that all or a portion of the claims or defenses 
made by the party are frivolous and are not reasonably 
supported by the facts and the law in the civil action. In determining whether claims or defenses are frivolous, the 
court may consider whether the party alleging that the 
claims or defenses are frivolous had submitted to the party 
asserting the claims or defenses a request for their 
withdrawal as provided in subsection (c). If the court 
determines that only a portion of the claims or defenses 
made by the party are frivolous, the court shall determine 
a reasonable sum for attorneys' fees and costs in relation 
to the frivolous claims or defenses. 
(c) A party alleging that claims or defenses are 
frivolous may submit to the party asserting the claims or defenses a request for withdrawal of the frivolous claims 
or defenses, in writing, identifying those claims or 
defenses and the reasons they are believed to be frivolous.

 The award of fees under HRS § 607-14.5 "is conditioned 
upon a finding that the claim or appeal is frivolous." 
Morrison-Knudsen Co. v. Makahuena Corp., 66 Haw. 663, 672 n.5, 
675 P.2d 760, 767 n.5 (1983). 
A frivolous claim is a claim so manifestly and 
palpably without merit, so as to indicate bad faith on the 
pleader's part such that argument to the court was not required. A finding of frivolousness is a high bar; it is 
not enough that a claim be without merit, there must be a 
showing of bad faith. 
Tagupa v. VIPDesk, 135 Hawai‘ i 468, 479, 353 P.3d 1010, 1021 
(2015) (citation modified). 
Here, the circuit court made specific written findings 
that the Curtis Family's claims in their First Amended Complaint 
against President Vandenburgh, former President Watts, Deputy 
Warren, and Superintendent Nelson were without support in the 
record: 
• President Vandenburgh was not president at the time of the incident. 
• Deputy Warren did not supervise Hawaiian Mission Academy teachers. 
If the party withdraws the 
frivolous claims or defenses 
within a reasonable length of time, the court shall not 
award attorneys' fees and costs based on those claims or 
defenses under this section. 
(Emphases added.) 
22   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
   • There was no evidence presented linking former 
President Watts to the incident. 
• There was no evidence presented linking Superintendent Nelson to the incident. 
Further, the circuit court found that Defendants 
requested withdrawal of the allegedly frivolous claims in writing under HRS § 607-14.5(c), but the Curtis Family 
maintained claims against these four individuals nonetheless. 
Contrary to the Curtis Family's argument on appeal, these findings were sufficient to support the circuit court's 
determination of frivolousness. 
The circuit court then found that "a fair 
apportionment or weighting of the total attorneys' fees that are 
attributable to the defense of the aforementioned 4 of the 9 
individual Defendants is 10% of the total attorneys' fees that 
were incurred, or $44,671.62."
9 The circuit court awarded 
$44,671.62 in attorneys' fees for having "to defend the 
frivolous claims against the said 4 of the 9 defendants." The 
Curtis Family makes no assertion that apportioning ten percent 
of the requested attorneys' fees was an abuse of the court's 
discretion. 
9 $446,716.17 ÷ 10 = $44,671.62.

 Thus, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion 
in awarding attorneys' fees in favor of Defendants under HRS 
§ 607-14.5.
