APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC181000540) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record in case numbers CAAP-23-
0000044 and CAAP-23-0000378, it appears that: 
(1) On January 14, 2023, self-represented Defendants/ 
Third-Party Plaintiffs/Counterclaimants-Appellants Melvin Keakaku 
Amina, AKA Melvin K. Amina, and Donna Mae Amina, AKA Donna M. Amina (Amina Parties) created CAAP-23-0000044 by filing a notice 
of appeal in 1CC181000540, appealing from, 
inter alia, the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (Circuit Court): 
(a) December 14, 2022 minute order granting 
Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-Appellee U.S. Bank National 
Association, as Trustee for J.P. Morgan Acquisition Trust 2006-WMC2, Asset Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2006-WMC2's NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(US Bank) Motion for Summary Judgment and for Interlocutory 
Decree of Foreclosure, Filed September 23, 2022 (MSJ); and 
(b) several other, interlocutory minute orders 
related to the foreclosure; 
(2) On February 2, 2023, the Circuit Court entered 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting [the MSJ] 
(Foreclosure Decree) and a corresponding Judgment in favor of US 
Bank and against Amina Parties (Judgment) pursuant to Hawai# i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP
) Rule 54(b); 
(3) On February 23, 2023, Amina Parties filed a notice 
of appeal from the Judgment and "all adverse decisions made by 
the [Circuit] Court in" 1CC181000540, creating CAAP-23-0000378; 
(4) On June 2, 2023, Amina Parties filed an amended 
notice of appeal in CAAP-23-0000044 appealing from, 
inter alia, 
the Judgment; 
(5) The Judgment is a final, appealable judgment under 
HRCP Rules 54(b) and 58. Though the notice of appeal in CAAP-23-000044 is premature as to the Judgment, it is deemed timely by operation of Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
4(a)(2); 
(6) The notice of appeal in CAAP-23-000378 was timely 
filed within 30 days after entry of the Judgment. HRAP Rule 4(a)(1); 
(7) As the appeals in CAAP-23-0000044 and CAAP-23-
0000378 both timely appeal from the Judgment, they both bring up for review the Foreclosure Decree and any other interlocutory order that was issued prior to the Foreclosure Decree and concerned issues involving the foreclosure. Bank of New York 
Mellon as Tr. for Certificateholders of CWABS Inc., Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2007-11 v. Colton, 146 Hawai# i 577, 581, 463 
P.3d 1234, 1238 (App. 2020); Ueoka v. Szymanski, 107 Hawai# i 386, 
396, 114 P.3d 892, 902 (2005); and 
(8) Thus, the appeal in case number CAAP-23-0000378 is 
duplicative of CAAP-23-0000044. Cates v. State, No. CAAP-22-0000393, 2022 WL 16733710 (App. Nov. 7, 2022)(Order); Ogeone v. Au, No. CAAP-18-0000190, 2019 WL 972542 (App. Feb. 27, 2019)(Order).
