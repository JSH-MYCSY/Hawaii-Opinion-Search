APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 5CCV-22-0000027) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Guidry, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1)
 On November 1, 2022, the Circuit Court of the Fifth 
Circuit (circuit court) entered an order granting summary 
judgment in favor of Plaintiffs/Counterclaim Defendants-Appellees 
Mark Malagodi and Janet Johnston on Claim 2 of their April 26, 2022 Complaint (MSJ Order). 
(2) On January 27, 2023, self-represented Defendants/ 
Counterclaimants-Appellants Cameron E. Nice and Martha J. Jacobsen, AKA Martha J. Jacobsen-Nice (Nice Parties) moved to 
vacate the MSJ Order, which the circuit court denied on April 25, 
2023 (Denial Order).

(3) On or about May 3, 2023, the Nice Parties mailed a 
Motion for Reconsideration of the Denial Order (Motion to 
Reconsider) to Judge Randal G.B. Valenciano's clerk, along with a letter asking the clerk to file the motion with this court. The 
court construes the letter, together with the Motion to Reconsider, as a Notice of Appeal (NA) from the Denial Order. 
(4) On or about May 29, 2023, the Nice Parties mailed 
the Motion to Reconsider to the Chief Clerk of the Hawai# i 
Supreme Court, asking her to file it in this court. 
(5) On June 7, 2023, the Chief Clerk's Office filed the 
Motion to Reconsider as an NA, creating this appeal. 
(6) Even assuming arguendo the NA was timely filed,
1 
the court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal because the Denial Order is not a final, appealable order or judgment. See Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016); Hawai# i Rules of Civil 
Procedure Rules 54(b) and 58; Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Further, the Denial Order is not independently appealable under the collateral-order doctrine, the Forgay doctrine,
2 or HRS 
ยง 641-1(b). See Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai# i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 
1 "A self-represented party . . . shall conventionally file the notice
of appeal with the clerk of the court or agency appealed from. . . . The date 
of receipt shall be deemed the date the notice of appeal was filed with theappellate court." Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 3(a).
Though the Nice Parties incorrectly submitted the NA to Judge Valenciano'sclerk, rather than filing it with the circuit court clerk, it nonethelessappears to have been timely received on May 5, 2023, and "pro se litigantsshould not automatically have their access to appellate review . . .foreclosed because of failure to conform to requirements of the proceduralrules." Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai #i 368, 380-81, 465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020). 
2 See Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848). Though the MSJ Order
appears to have been independently appealable under the Forgay doctrine, thetime to appeal that order expired on December 1, 2022, per HRAP Rule 4(a)(1),the deadline was not extended or tolled under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) or (4), andthe NA expressly appealed from the Denial Order, only. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
832, 836 (2016) (setting forth the requirements for appealability 
under the collateral-order doctrine and the Forgay doctrine); HRS ยง 641-1(b) (specifying requirements for leave to file interlocutory appeal). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
