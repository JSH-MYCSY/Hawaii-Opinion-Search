APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  FIFTH  CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL  NO.  5CCV-22-0000027) 
ORDER  DENYING   MOTION  FOR  RECONSIDERATION 
(By:   Leonard,   Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka   and  Guidry,   JJ.) 
Upon
 consideration of the Motion for Reconsideration 
and Motion for immediate Relief from Judgements [sic], filed 
April 29, 2024, by self-represented Defendants/Counterclaimants-
Appellants Cameron E. Nice and Martha J. Jacobsen aka Martha J. 
Jacobsen-Nice (together, Nice Parties), the papers in support, 
and the record, it appears that: 
(1) The Nice Parties seek reconsideration of the April 
26, 2024 order dismissing the motions they filed on March 25, 
2024. The Nice Parties also seek "immediate relief from 
judgments" and to dismiss with prejudice the complaint filed in 
the underlying case, 5CCV-22-0000027; and 
(2) The Nice Parties fail to demonstrate the court 
overlooked or misapprehended any point of law or fact in the          
          
          
           
          
 
        
        
    
      NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
April 26, 2024 order. Hawai i  Rules of  Appellate Procedure Rule 
40(b). In addition, because the court dismissed this appeal for 
lack of jurisdiction on June 26, 2023, it will dismiss the Nice 
Parties claims for relief in the Motion for immediate Relief from 
Judgements [sic]. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for 
Reconsideration is denied and the Motion for immediate Relief 
from Judgements [sic] is dismissed.
