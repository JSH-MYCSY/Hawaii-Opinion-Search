APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 5CCV-22-0000027) 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and Guidry, JJ.) 
Upon review of self-represented Defendants/ 
Counterclaimants-Appellants Cameron E. Nice and Martha J. 
Jacobsen, aka Martha J. Jacobsen-Nice's (
Nice Parties) June 29, 
2023 motion, the papers in support, and the record, it appears that the Nice Parties request that this court reconsider its June 26, 2023 Order Dismissing Appeal for Lack of Appellate Jurisdiction and reinstate this appeal. The Nice Parties fail to demonstrate that the court overlooked or misapprehended any point of law or fact in dismissing this appeal. Hawai#i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 40(b). The Hawai# i Supreme Court has recognized that "[w]hen we perceive a jurisdictional defect in an 
appeal, we must, sua sponte, dismiss that appeal." Bacon v. 
Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is 
denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, July 21, 2023.
