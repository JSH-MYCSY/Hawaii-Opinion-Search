APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CC131003271) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Guidry, JJ.) 
Hannah Kim Heart, representing herself, appeals from 
the June 5, 2025 Amended Judgment  for The Bank of New York Mellon 
(BONYM) entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.  We 
affirm. 1
BONYM filed a foreclosure complaint against Heart on 
December 16, 2013. On October 19, 2021, the Circuit Court 
entered an order granting BONYM's motion for summary judgment and

interlocutory decree of foreclosure and a judgment ( Foreclosure 
Judgment ).2 Heart did not appeal from the Foreclosure Judgment. 
The commissioner's report on the foreclosure sale was 
filed on March 28, 2023. BONYM moved to confirm the sale. The 
motion was heard on June 7, 2023. The Circuit Court orally granted the motion and directed entry of a judgment. 
Heart filed her notice of appeal on June 13, 2023. The 
Order Approving Commissioner’s Report and Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Confirmation of Foreclosure Sale, Allowance of Costs, Commissions and Fees, Distribution of Proceeds, Directing Conveyance and for Writ of Possession/ Ejectments  was entered on 
August 1, 2023. A judgment was entered on August 2, 2023. The Amended Judgment was entered on June 5, 2025, after a temporary remand. 
Heart's opening brief does not comply with Rule 28(b) 
of the Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure. We liberally 
interpret pleadings prepared by self-represented litigants and do not automatically foreclose them from appellate review because they violate court rules. Erum v. Llego , 147 Hawai #i 368, 380-
81, 465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020). Consistent with the supreme court's policy to reach the merits of an appeal, Hous. Fin. & Dev. Corp. v. Ferguson , 91 Hawai #i 81, 85–86, 979 P.2d 1107, 
1111–12 (1999), we address what we discern to be Heart's arguments. 
Foreclosure cases are bifurcated into separately 
appealable parts: (1) the decree of foreclosure and the order of sale, and (2) all other orders. Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., 
Inc. v. Wise
, 130 Hawai#i 11, 16, 304 P.3d 1192, 1197 (2013). 
Heart's opening brief challenges the Foreclosure Judgment; it does not challenge the order granting BONYM's motion to confirm the foreclosure sale. Heart cannot challenge the merits of the Foreclosure Judgment in her appeal from the order confirming

The Circuit Court's June 5, 2025 Amended Judgment for 
BONYM is affirmed.
