in-Interest-Appellant Louis Mendonca (Mendonca) appeals from the 
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit's May 26, 2023 Final Judgment 
on Louis P. Mendonca's Attorney Lien. On July 31, 2023, this court ordered the parties to, within ten days of the order, show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. On August 1, 2023, Mendonca filed a memorandum in response to the order in which he fails to show cause why this case should not be dismissed. On August 10, 2023, Plaintiffs-Appellees Goran Pleho LLC, Goran Pleho, and Ana Maria Pleho fileda memorandum in response to the order in which they assert that the appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
