directing self-represented Plaintiff-Appellant N.T. (NT) to show 
cause why the appeal should not be dismissed under Hawai i Rules  
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rules 12.1(e) and 30 for failure to 
file the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief, and that 
failure to timely respond to the order or to show good cause may 
result in sanctions, including the dismissal of this appeal;1 and 
(2) NT failed to respond to the order. 
1 The November 8, 2023 order was returned to the court as 
undeliverable. It was mailed to NT's address on record, and NT has not filed 
a notice of change of address with the appellate clerk, in accordance with 
HRAP Rule 25(f).
