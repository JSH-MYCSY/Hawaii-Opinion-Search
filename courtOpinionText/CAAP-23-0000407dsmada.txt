NO.  CAAP-23-0000407 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
A.P.,  Plaintiff-Appellant,  v. 
S.B.,  Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  FAMILY  COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT 
(CASE  NO.  3DV20100038K) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL 
(By:   Hiraoka,  Presiding  Judge,  Wadsworth  and  Guidry,  JJ.) 
Upon  review  of  the  records  in  CAAP-23-0000407  and  CAAP-
23-0000585,  it  appears  that: 
(1)
 On
 June 23, 2023, Plaintiff-Appellant A.P. (Wife) 
filed a notice of appeal from the May 25, 2023 Decree Granting 
Absolute Divorce and Awarding Child Custody (Decree) entered by 
the Family Court of the Third Circuit, creating CAAP-23-0000407. 
The Decree was a final, appealable decree, and the notice of 
appeal was timely filed. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 571-54 
(2018); Hawai i Rules  of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1). 
(2) On October 16, 2023, Wife filed a notice of appeal 
from the October 5, 2023 Amended Decree Granting Absolute Divorce 
and Awarding Child Custody (Amended Decree) entered by the Family 
Court, creating CAAP-23-0000585. The Amended Decree was also a 
final, appealable decree, and the notice of appeal was timely 
filed. HRS ยง 571-54; HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). 
(3) The Amended Decree substantially amends the Decree 
and therefore supersedes it as the operative appealable document. 
See Wiesenberg v. Univ. of Hawaii,
 138 Hawai i 210, 217, 378 P.3d 
926, 933 (2016) (holding that an amended judgment that alters the          
         
       
        
        
       
          
      
        
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
original judgment "in a material and substantial respect" is "the 
operative document for purposes of th[e] appeal"). 
(4) As the notice of appeal in CAAP-23-0000585 properly 
appeals from the operative appealable document, the appeal in 
CAAP-23-0000407 is unnecessary. E.g., Cates v. State, 
No. CAAP-22-0000393, 2022 WL 16733710, at *1 (App. Nov. 7, 2022) 
(Order) (dismissing appeal from interlocutory order granting 
summary judgment as duplicative of and unnecessary to subsequent 
appeal from final judgment). 
Therefore,  IT   IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  the  appeal  in  case 
number  CAAP-23-0000407  is  dismissed  as  unnecessary. 
IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  all  pending  motions  are 
dismissed  as  moot. 
IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  the  appellate  clerk  shall 
serve  a  copy  of  this  order  on  the  clerk  of  the  Family  Court. 
DATED:   Honolulu,   Hawai i,  November  6,  2023.
