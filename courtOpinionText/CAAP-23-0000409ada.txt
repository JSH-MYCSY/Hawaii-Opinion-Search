OPINION OF THE COURT BY LEONARD, ACTING CHIEF JUDGE 
Defendant-Appellant Kamalei Wilbur-Delima (
Wilbur-
Delima) appeals from the May 26, 2023 Orders Denying Defendant's 
Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence (May 26, 2023 Orders),1 
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court),
2 as well as the Circuit Court's April 10, 2023 Findings 
of Fact; Conclusions of Law; Order Denying Defendant's Motion to 
1 The May 26, 2023 Orders denied Wilbur-Delima's request to correct
his sentences in 1PC151000955, 1PC151001978, and 1PC161001506. 
2 The Honorable Trish K. Morikawa presided.  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Correct Illegal Sentence (April 10, 2023 Order)3 (together, 
Orders Denying Correction of Illegal Sentences). In four 
December 13, 2022 Resentencing Orders, the Circuit Court revoked 
Wilbur-Delima's probation, and resentenced him to a term of ten years imprisonment in 1PC151000955, and five years in 1PC151001274, 1PC151001978, and 1PC161001506, all to be served concurrently. 
The fundamental issue in this appeal is whether Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 706-625(1), (4) (2014) and 706-627(1) 
(2014), read in pari materia, exclude "motions to modify" 
probation from motions that toll a defendant's probation. For the reasons stated herein, we hold that a motion to modify probation that seeks to enlarge a condition of probation is a tolling motion. Affirmed. I. BACKGROUND A. June 15, 2015 - April 26, 2017 
On June 16, 2015, the State of Hawai#i (State) charged 
Wilbur-Delima via grand jury indictment with one count of Robbery in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS §§ 708-841(1)(a) (2014) and/or 708-841(1)(b) (2014), in 1PC151000955. On August 17, 2015, the State charged Wilbur-Delima via felony information with one count of Attempted Escape in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS §§ 705-500(1)(b) (2014) and 710-1021 (2014), in 
3 The April 10, 2023 Order denied Wilbur-Delima's motion to correct
his sentence in 1PC151001274. Wilbur-Delima's notice of appeal also purported
to appeal from the December 13, 2022 Orders of Resentencing, Revocation ofProbation ( Resentencing Orders ). However, at the June 26, 2024 oral argument
on this appeal, Wilbur-Delima's attorney acknowledged that the notice ofappeal was untimely as to the Resentencing Orders and stated that Wilbur-Delima was only seeking appellate review of the Orders Denying Correction ofIllegal Sentences.

On July 20, 2016, the Circuit Court
4 entered a judgment 
of conviction, sentencing Wilbur-Delima to concurrent four years probation in 1PC151001274, 1PC151001978, and 1PC151000955. 
On September 14, 2016, the State filed a motion to 
revoke Wilbur-Delima's probation in 1PC151001274 and requested resentencing for Wilbur-Delima's inexcusable violation of multiple conditions of his probation. 
On September 21, 2016, the State charged Wilbur-Delima 
via complaint with Habitual Property Crime, in violation of HRS § 708-803 (Supp. 2023), in 1PC161001506. Wilbur-Delima pled no contest in 1PC161001506 on November 29, 2016. 
The State filed motions to revoke Wilbur-Delima's 
probation in 1PC151001978 and 1PC151000955 on December 8, 2016, asserting that Wilbur-Delima violated multiple conditions of his probation and requested resentencing to a term of imprisonment. 
The Circuit Court

Delima's probation and resentenced him to four years probation in 1PC151001274, 1PC151001978, and 1PC151000955. The Circuit Court ordered the four-year probation terms in 1PC151001274, 1PC151001978, 1PC151000955, and 1PC161001506 (collectively, Subject Cases) to run concurrently. 
B. June 30, 2017 - Present On June 30, 2017, Wilbur-Delima entered Hawaii's 
Opportunity Probation with Enforcement (HOPE) Probation Program
6 
and attended a HOPE Warning hearing with the Circuit Court.7 
The court addressed Wilbur-Delima and explained the consequences of non-compliance with HOPE Probation. Between November 8, 2017, and February 28, 2020, the State filed ten "Motion[s] for Modification of the Terms and Conditions of Probation, Deferred Acceptance of Guilty Plea or Deferred Acceptance of No Contest Plea" (Motions to Modify) and/or "Motion[s] for Modification 
and/or Enlargement of Terms and Conditions of Probation, Deferred

officer within 24 hours of release from custody.
Wilbur-Delima served approximately 41 days in jail. 
On November 23, 2021, in 1PC161001506, 1PC151001978, 
1PC151000955, and November 30, 2021, in 1PC151001274, the State 
filed the "Motion[s] for Revocation of Probation, Resentencing and Issuance of Summons" (Motions for Revocation), asserting that 
Wilbur-Delima failed to maintain substance abuse treatment until 
clinically discharged. 
On February 18, 2022, Wilbur-Delima stipulated to the 
violations in the State's Motions for Revocation; the Circuit Court orally granted the State's motions, allowed Wilbur-Delima another opportunity to complete substance abuse treatment at Kaiser, and continued resentencing to March 22, 2022. Wilbur-Delima failed to appear at the continued resentencing hearings held on March 22, 2022, and April 5, 2022. A bench warrant was issued for Wilbur-Delima's arrest on April 5, 2022, and Wilbur-Delima was arrested on April 22, 2022. On May 17, 2022, the court granted Wilbur-Delima's request for a continuance in order to reapply to drug court. Wilbur-Delima was denied admission to drug court on October 12, 2022. On December 6, 2022, the State convicted Wilbur-Delima of two additional felonies, Habitual Property Crime in lCPC-22-0000697 and Unauthorized Entry into Motor Vehicle in the First Degree in lCPC-22-0000970. 
On December 13, 2022, the Circuit Court issued the 
Resentencing Orders, revoking Wilbur-Delima's probation, and sentencing him to concurrent sentences in the Subject Cases with the longest term of ten years levied in 1PC151000955. On 
7 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
February 15, 2023, Wilbur-Delima filed his Motions to Correct 
Illegal Sentence (Motions to Correct), asserting that the court 
did not have jurisdiction to revoke or modify his probation 
because the State's Motions to Modify did not toll his probation, and therefore, as of August 21, 2021, the court's supervision lapsed. 
Thereafter, the Circuit Court issued the Orders Denying 
Correction of Illegal Sentences. The Circuit Court found that eight of the State's Motions to Modify enlarged the terms and conditions of Wilbur-Delima's probation, thereby tolling his probation for 257 days, and extending his probation period to January 8, 2022. 
Wilbur-Delima filed a notice of appeal on June 23, 
2023. II. POINTS OF ERROR 
Wilbur-Delima raises two points of error on appeal 
contending that the Circuit Court erred in: (1) granting the Motions for Revocation, and ignoring and/or overruling prior orders modifying Wilbur-Delima's probation that did not extend his concurrent four-year terms, and sentencing him to indeterminate prison terms; and (2) denying Wilbur-Delima's Motions to Correct and finding that Wilbur-Delima was still on probation and under the court's jurisdiction on November 23, 2021.

III. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A sentencing judge generally has broad discretion in
imposing a sentence. The applicable standard of review for
sentencing or resentencing matters is whether the courtcommitted plain and manifest abuse of discretion in itsdecision. Factors which indicate a plain and manifest abuseof discretion are arbitrary or capricious action by thejudge and a rigid refusal to consider the defendant'scontentions. And, generally, to constitute an abuse it mustappear that the court clearly exceeded the bounds of reasonor disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to thesubstantial detriment of a party litigant. 
State v. Mundon, 121 Hawai# i 339, 349, 219 P.3d 1126, 1136 (2009) 
(quoting State v. Kahapea, 111 Hawai
#i 267, 278, 141 P.3d 440, 
451 (2006)). 
Statutory interpretation is a question of law 
reviewable de novo. In reviewing questions of statutory 
interpretation, we are guided by the following principles: 
First, the fundamental starting point for
statutory-interpretation is the language of the statuteitself. Second, where the statutory language is plain andunambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plainand obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task ofstatutory construction is our foremost obligation toascertain and give effect to the intention of thelegislature, which is to be obtained primarily from thelanguage contained in the statute itself. Fourth, whenthere is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctivenessor uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, anambiguity exists. 
State v. Milne, 149 Hawai# i 329, 333, 489 P.3d 433, 437 (2021) 
(quoting State v. Castillon, 144 
Hawai#i 406, 411, 443 P.3d 98, 
103 (2019)). 
When there is ambiguity in a statute, the meaning of theambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, withwhich the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may becompared, in order to ascertain their true meaning.Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids indetermining legislative intent, such as legislative history,or the reason and spirit of the law.

IV. DISCUSSION A. Timeliness of Appeals The State challenges this court's jurisdiction over 
Wilbur-Delima's appeal from the Resentencing Orders and the April 10, 2023 Order based on the untimeliness of the filing of the notice of appeal. As noted above, at oral argument, Wilbur-Delima declined to argue that this court should grant relief directly from the Resentencing Orders, instead urging us to "relax the deadline" in the appeal from the April 10, 2023 Order. 
Hawai#i
 appellate courts often reach the merits of a 
criminal defendant's appeal, notwithstanding a failure to meet the deadline for filing a notice of appeal, "where justice so warrants." 
State v. Caraballo
, 62 Haw. 309, 315, 615 P.2d 91, 96 
(1980) (permitting appeal filed after the deadline where defendant had withdrawn his initial appeal based upon counsel's erroneous advice); State v. Cardenas
, 150 Hawai#i 307, 317, 500 
P.3d 492, 502 (App. 2021) (allowing an appeal to proceed, despite an untimely filing of a notice of appeal, when defense counsel has inexcusably or ineffectively failed to perfect an appeal). In addition, even if we were to dismiss or deny relief from Wilbur-Delima's challenge to the April 10, 2023 Order, an illegal sentence can be challenged at any time. 
See Stanley v. State
, 
148 Hawai#i 489, 501, 479 P.3d 107, 119 (2021). For these 
reasons, it is in the interest of justice, as well as judicial 
10 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
economy, to address it here, along with Wilbur-Delima's timely 
challenge to the May 26, 2023 Orders. 
B. Disregard of Prior Modification Orders In Wilbur-Delima's first point of error, he argues that 
the Circuit Court abused its discretion in the Resentencing Orders by failing to properly consider the prior modification orders. As Wilbur-Delima no longer seeks relief directly from the Resentencing Orders, and this argument was not raised in Wilbur-Delima's challenge to the Orders Denying Correction of Illegal Sentences, no relief may be granted on this ground. 
C. Motions to Modify and the Tolling of Probation Wilbur-Delima argues that HRS §§ 706-625(1), (4) (2014) 
and 706-627(1) (2014), read in pari materia, exclude "motions to modify" from motions that toll a defendant's probation. HRS § 706-625 provides, in pertinent part: 
§ 706-625 Revocation, modification of probation
conditions. (1) The court, on application of a probation
officer, the prosecuting attorney, the defendant, or on its
own motion, after a hearing, may revoke probation except asprovided in subsection (7), reduce or enlarge the conditionsof a sentence of probation, pursuant to the provisionsapplicable to the initial setting of the conditions and theprovisions of section 706-627. 
. . . . 
(4) The court may modify the requirements imposed on
the defendant or impose further requirements, if it findsthat such action will assist the defendant in leading alaw-abiding life. 
HRS § 706-627 provides: 
§ 706-627 Tolling of probation. (1) Upon the filing
of a motion to revoke a probation or a motion to enlarge theconditions imposed thereby, the period of probation shall betolled pending the hearing upon the motion and the decisionof the court. The period of tolling shall be computed fromthe filing date of the motion through and including thefiling date of the written decision of the court concerningthe motion for purposes of computation of the remainingperiod of probation, if any. In the event the court fails to file a written decision upon the motion, the period shall 
11 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
be computed by reference to the date the court makes a
decision upon the motion in open court. During the periodof tolling of the probation, the defendant shall remainsubject to all terms and conditions of the probation exceptas otherwise provided by this chapter. 
(2) In the event the court, following hearing,
refuses to revoke the probation or grant the requestedenlargement of conditions thereof because the defendant'sfailure to comply therewith was excusable, the defendant maybe granted the period of tolling of the probation forpurposes of computation of the remaining probation, if any. 
The Circuit Court determined that when reading HRS 
§ 706-625, the term "modify" can mean to either "enlarge" or 
"reduce" a sentence, as the plain meaning of "modify" encompasses both, and that even though the nine motions were titled "motions to modify," they substantively sought to enlarge the conditions of Wilbur-Delima's probation in light of Wilbur-Delima's violations of the conditions of probation, and his sentence was in fact enlarged with the eight orders that he serve various additional periods of jail time. Thus, the court concluded, eight of the nine Motions to Modify tolled Wilbur-Delima's probation. 
Wilbur-Delima argues that the Circuit Court erred in 
concluding that his probation was tolled pursuant to HRS § 706-727(1) because the definition of modify does not equate with enlarging a condition of probation under that provision. 
We conclude that this argument is without merit. Under 
the plain language of HRS § 707-625, a motion to modify the conditions of probation can either seek to reduce or enlarge them. The common understanding of a modification, as well as the legal dictionary definition, is simply to change something. See
Black's Law Dictionary, 11th ed., 1203 (2019) (defining "modification" as a "change to something; an alteration or 
12 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
amendment," and defining "modify" as "[t]o make somewhat 
different; to make small changes to (something)"). If an HRS § 707-625(1) "motion to modify" seeks to enlarge a condition of probation, then under the plain language of HRS § 706-627, probation is tolled. Wilbur-Delima's argument, in essence, is that courts should ignore the substance of an HRS § 707-625(1) motion to modify seeking to enlarge a condition of probation, and in his case, strictly construe the title "motion to modify" to exclude the undisputed fact that an enlarged probation condition, i.e., more jail time, was being sought in each of these nine motions. Wilbur-Delima offers no support for this construction, which appears to be contrary to case law admonitions against raising form over substance. See Coon v. City & Cnty. of 
Honolulu, 98 Hawai# i 233, 254, 47 P.3d 348, 369 (2002) (stating 
that "elevat[ing] form over substance" is an "approach we have repeatedly eschewed"); State v. Poohina, 97 Hawai# i 505, 509, 40 
P.3d 907, 911 (2002); see also State v. Wong, 47 Haw. 361, 367, 389 P.2d 439, 444 (1964) ("In determining whether the order of dismissal was 'an order or judgment, sustaining a special plea in bar' we are guided by substance, not form."). 
Wilbur-Delima also points to the legislative history of 
HRS §§ 706-625 and 706-627. We conclude, however, that this line of argument is of no avail. 
These statutes were enacted in 1972 and read as 
follows: 
Sec. 625 Modification of conditions. 
During a period of probation or suspension of
sentence, the court, on application of a probation officeror of the defendant, or on its own motion, may modify the 
13  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
requirements imposed on the defendant or add further
requirements authorized by section 624. 
Sec. 627 Notice and hearing on revocation of
suspension of sentence or probation, or increasing theconditions thereof. 
The court shall not revoke a probation or suspension
of sentence or increase the requirements imposed thereby onthe defendant except after a hearing upon written notice tothe defendant of the grounds on which such action isproposed. The defendant shall have the right to hear and
controvert the evidence against him, to offer evidence in
his defense, and to be represented by counsel. 
1972 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 9, § 1 at 76. 
Wilbur-Delima argues that because Section 625 states 
that suspended sentences may be "modified" or "further 
requirements" may be added, modifications and increases/enlargements are distinct, with the former meaning small changes, not enlarging or adding further requirements.  
However, this is essentially the same argument he makes with respect to the current form of the statutes. As discussed above, "modified" simply means somewhat changed or altered, and does not preclude a modification in a manner that enlarges an existing condition.  
In 1977, HRS § 706-627 was amended to read as follows: 
Sec. 706-627 Notice and hearing on revocation of
suspension of sentence or probation, or increasing the
conditions thereof; tolling of suspension of sentence orprobation.  (1) The court shall not revoke a probation or
suspension of sentence or increase the requirements imposedthereby on the defendant except after a hearing upon writtennotice to the defendant of the grounds on which such actionis proposed. The defendant shall have the right to hear and
controvert the evidence against him, to offer evidence in
his defense, and to be represented by counsel. 
(2)
 Upon the filing of a motion to revoke a probation
or suspension of sentence or a motion to increase therequirements imposed thereby, the period of probation orsuspension of sentence shall be tolled pending the hearingupon the motion and the decision of the court. The periodof tolling shall be computed from the filing date of themotion through and including the filing date of the writtendecision of the court concerning the motion for purposes ofcomputation of the remaining period of probation orsuspension, if any. In the event the court fails to file a 
14  
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
written decision upon the motion, the period shall be
computed by reference to the date the court makes a decisionupon the motion in open court. During the period of tollingof the probation or suspension, the defendant shallremain subject to all terms and conditions of the probationor suspension except as otherwise provided by this chapter. 
(3) In the event the court, following hearing, refuses
to revoke the probation or suspension or grant the requestedincreases in requirements thereof, the defendant shall begranted the period of tolling of the probation or suspensionfor purposes on computation of the remaining probation orsuspension, if any. 
1977 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 106, § 1 at 189. 
The Senate Standing Committee Report explained that the 
purpose of the legislation was to provide for tolling of 
probation whenever a motion to revoke probation or increase the requirements imposed is filed. S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1105, in 1977 Senate Journal, at 1295. The committee found that under the law at the time, it was possible for a person's probation to run out pending a revocation hearing, making the person free even though they may have committed acts justifying revocation of probation. Id.Wilbur-Delima asserts that this statutory 
language shows that tolling is intended to apply to motions to revoke or increase the requirements of probation, not motions to modify. 
However, we conclude that the Legislature clearly 
indicated that the amendments were designed to prevent a person's probation from lapsing pending a revocation hearing, even though they may have committed acts justifying revoking probation. Id.
It appears that Wilbur-Delima is the exact type of probationer the Legislature wanted to remain on probation pending a decision on resentencing. Wilbur-Delima stipulated to violating the terms and conditions of his probation numerous times, but a hallmark of 
15 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HOPE probation allowed the court to repeatedly modify his 
probation and impose short jail stints in lieu of simply resentencing him to the open term earlier in his probation. The legislative history confirms that the intent of the tolling statute is to prevent a noncompliant probationer from taking advantage of the time it takes for the courts to decide motions that seek to enlarge or revoke their probation. 
Our plain reading of the purpose of the tolling statute 
is reinforced by the 1980 amendments to HRS § 706-627, where the Legislature amended HRS § 706-627(3) to read: 
(3) In the event the court, following hearing,
refuses to revoke the probation or suspension or grant the
requested increases in requirements thereof because thedefendant's failure to comply therewith was excusable, thedefendant [shall] may be granted the period of tolling ofthe probation or suspension for purposes [on] of computationof the remaining probation or suspension, if any.

deletions bracketed). 
The Standing Committee Reports on Act 156 reiterated 
the Legislature's intent from the 1977 amendments, and sought to further amend the law due to concerns that it "[gave] defendants an unfair advantage by allowing them, in essence, to be given 'credit' toward their sentence for a period of time when they are not abiding by the terms of such sentence." H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 434-80, in 1980 House Journal, at 1466, S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 753-80, in 1980 Senate Journal, at 1364.

In 1985, HRS §§ 706-625 and 706-627  were again 
amended. The 1985 amendments to § 706-625 added subsections (b)-
(e), now (2)-(5), and made minor changes to the first subsection: 10
§ 706-625 [Modification of conditions.] Revocation 
of suspension of sentence or probation, modification of
conditions or imposition of further requirements.  (a) During
a period of probation or suspension of sentence, the court,on application of a probation officer, the prosecutingattorney, [or of] the defendant, or on its own motion, aftera hearing, may revoke the suspension of sentence orprobation, modify the requirements imposed on the defendant,or [add] impose further requirements authorized by section706-624. 
(b) The prosecuting attorney, the defendant's
probation officer, and the defendant shall be notified bythe movant in writing of the time, place, and date of anysuch hearing, and of the grounds upon which action underthis section is proposed. The prosecuting attorney, thedefendant's probation officer, and the defendant may appearin the hearing to oppose or support the application, and maysubmit evidence for the court's consideration. The defendant shall have the right to be represented by counsel.For purposes of this section the court shall not be bound bythe Hawaii Rules of Evidence, except for the rulespertaining to privileges. 
(c) The court shall revoke the suspension of sentence
or probation if the defendant has inexcusably failed tocomply with a substantial requirement imposed as a conditionof the order or has been convicted of a felony. The court may revoke the suspension of sentence or probation if thedefendant has been convicted of another crime other than a felony. 
(d) The court may modify the requirements imposed on
the defendant or impose further requirements, if it findsthat such action will assist the defendant in leading alaw-abiding life. 
(e) When the court revokes a suspension of sentence
or probation, it may impose on the defendant any sentencethat might have been imposed originally for the crime ofwhich he was convicted. 
1985 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 192, § 1 at 327-28 (additions 
underlined, deletions bracketed). Wilbur-Delima argues that because subsection (a) kept the distinction between motions to

changed from "Notice and hearing on revocation of suspension of sentence
or probation, or increasing the conditions thereof; tolling" to "Tolling ofsuspension of sentence or probation." 1985 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 192, § 1 at328.

revoke, modify, and add further requirements, and subsection (d) 
also makes a distinction between motions to modify and motions to impose further requirements, the legislature intended these motions to be distinct. Any ambiguity created by the 1985 amendments was resolved by the 1986 amendments. 
In 1986, HRS § 706-625 was amended to read: 
§ 706-625 Revocation [of suspension of sentence or
probation], modification of probation conditions [or
imposition or further requirements]. (a) [During a period of
probation or suspension of sentence, the] The court, onapplication of a probation officer, the prosecutingattorney, the defendant, or on its own motion, after ahearing, may revoke [the suspension of sentence or]probation, [modify the requirements imposed on the
defendant, or impose further requirements authorized by
section 706-624.] reduce or enlarge the conditions of asentence of probation, pursuant to the provisions applicableto the initial setting of the conditions and the provisionsof section 706-627. 
(b) The prosecuting attorney, the defendant's
probation officer, and the defendant shall be notified bythe movant in writing of the time, place, and date of anysuch hearing, and of the grounds upon which action underthis section is proposed. 
The prosecuting attorney, the
defendant’s probation officer, and the defendant may appearin the hearing to oppose or support the application, and maysubmit evidence for the court's consideration. The defendant shall have the right to be represented by counsel.For purposes of this section the court shall not be bound bythe Hawaii Rules of Evidence, except for the rulespertaining toprivileges. 
(c) The court shall revoke [the suspension of
sentence or] probation if the defendant has inexcusablyfailed to comply with a substantial requirement imposed as acondition of the order or has been convicted of a felony.The court may revoke the suspension of sentence or probationif the defendant has been convicted of another crime other than a felony. 
(d) The court may modify the requirements imposed on
the defendant or impose further requirements, if it findsthat such action will assist the defendant in leading alaw-abiding life. 
(e) When the court revokes [a suspension of sentence
or] probation, it may impose on the defendant any sentencethat might have been imposed originally for the crime ofwhich he was convicted.

Clarity was improved with the heading of the statute 
replacing "imposition of further requirements" with 
"modification" to read "Revocation, modification of probation conditions," indicating that modification can encompass an imposition of further requirements. Additionally, "modify the requirements imposed" and "impose further requirements" in subsection (a) were replaced with "reduce or enlarge conditions of probation," again more clearly indicating that modifications encompass reductions and enlargements of probation conditions. Id. In the amendments to HRS § 706-627, the phrases "increase 
the requirements" in subsections (1) and (2) were replaced with "enlarge the conditions imposed." Id.
The Legislature's use of the word modify in HRS § 706-
625 and not in HRS § 706-627 is clear, logical, and consistent with the statutory scheme and legislative history. As discussed, modification can encompass enlargements and reductions. However, only motions to modify seeking enlargements in probation conditions are tolling motions, and probationers subject to such enlargements are the ones that the Legislature wanted to potentially hold accountable for acts justifying the revocation of probation. See H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 450, in 1977 House 
Journal, at 1495 (emphases added); S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1105, in 1977 Senate Journal, at 1295 (stating that the purpose of the 1977 amendments were to prevent a "person's period of probation . . . [from running] out pending a revocation hearing, thus making him a free man, even though he may have committed acts justifying revocation of probation or suspended sentence.")

In sum, we conclude that the legislative history 
underscores the plain meaning of HRS § 706-625 and HRS § 706-627. 
D. Rule of Lenity 
Finally, Wilbur-Delima requests, if this court rejects 
his argument that the tolling provisions in HRS § 706-627 are inapplicable to motions to modify, that we apply the Rule of Lenity in his favor here. Under the Rule of Lenity: 
When a statute is ambiguous, and the legislative
history does not provide sufficient guidance, we follow the
rule of lenity. This "means that the court will not interpret a state criminal statute so as to increase thepenalty that it places on an individual when such aninterpretation can be based on no more than a guess as towhat the legislature intended." Accordingly, "[u]nder therule of lenity, the statute must be strictly construedagainst the government and in favor of the accused." 
State v. Woodfall , 120 Hawai#i 387, 396, 206 P.3d 841, 850 (2009) 
(citations omitted). 
We follow this rule if we have to guess as to the 
meaning of a criminal statute. 
That is not the case here. The 
statute is clear and the legislative history is instructive. 
Accordingly, the Rule of Lenity is not applicable here.
