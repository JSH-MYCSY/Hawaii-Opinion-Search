APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CCV-21-0000286(1)) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Guidry, JJ.) 
The County  of Maui and its Department of Public Works 
appeal from the Final Judgment  for Kia #i Kauaula and Kaipo Kekona 
(together, Kia
#i) entered by the Circuit Court of the Second 
Circuit.  The County challenges the Order granting summary 
judgment for Kia #i on Count 1 of their Amended Complaint  for 
Declaratory and Injunctive Relief . 1
1 The Honorable Kirstin M. Hamman presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 We vacate the Final Judgment in part, and remand for 
entry of (1) an order dismissing Count 1 of the Amended Complaint 
for lack of jurisdiction and (2) an amended judgment. 
BACKGROUND 
This case involves a waterline buried under a portion 
of Kauaula Trail  that runs from the Lahaina Bypass to Mill Street 
in West Maui.2 Work to bury the waterline was completed by 
August 28, 2021. Kia#i sued Wainee Land  & Homes, LLC, Hope 
Builders, LLC, and Launiupoko Irrigation Co., Inc. (the Waterline 
Defendants ) and the County less than a month later. 
Kia#i alleged that the Waterline Defendants buried the 
waterline under Kauaula Trail without complying with the Hawai #i 
Environmental Policy Act ( HEPA), Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) 
Chapter 343, and Maui County Code ( MCC) § 12.04.020. Count 1 
sought declaratory and injunctive relief based on the Waterline 
Defendants' alleged breach of HEPA. 
Count 2 sought injunctive 
relief under HRS Chapter 6E (Historic Preservation). Count 3 sought mandatory injunctive relief under HEPA. 
Kia#i moved for summary judgment. 
The February 10, 
2023 Order granted the motion as to Count 1, but denied it and granted summary judgment for all defendants on Counts 2 and 3.
3 
The Final Judgment was entered on June 9, 2023. This appeal by the County followed. Kia#i did not appeal from the disposition 
of Counts 2 and 3. 
2 Kia#i refer to the unpaved Kauaula Trail as "Kauaula Road." We 
refer to it as a trail to avoid confusion with Kauaula Road , the paved street
that runs mauka from Front Street until it turns into Waine #e Street makai of 
Honoapi #ilani Highway. A tall concrete wall separates Kauaula Road and Waine #e 
Street from Honoapi #ilani
 Highway. Kauaula Trail is mauka of Honoapi #ilani 
Highway. We take judicial notice of these facts pursuant to Hawaii Rules of
Evidence Rule 201. We express no opinion about the legal relationship, ifany, between Kauaula Trail and Kauaula Road. 
3 A court may enter summary judgment for the non-moving party if
there is no genuine issue of material fact and the non-moving party isentitled to judgment as a matter of law. State ex rel. Anzai v. City & County
of Honolulu , 99 Hawai#i 508, 515, 57 P.3d 433, 440 (2002).

POINT OF ERROR 
The County's opening brief does not address subject 
matter jurisdiction. But "lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
can never be waived by any party at any time." Ditto v. McCurdy , 
103 Hawai# i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003). A court must 
ensure it has subject matter jurisdiction, and must dismiss a case on its own if it concludes it lacks jurisdiction. Id. We 
ordered supplemental briefing on the issue under Hawai #i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule ( HRAP) 28(b)(4).
4 Kia#i and the County 
submitted supplemental briefs. 
STANDARD OF REVIEW 
"The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law[.]" 
Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Century Ctr. v. An , 139 Hawai #i 278, 
284, 389 P.3d 115, 121 (2016). 
DISCUSSION 
Count 1 sought declarations that the Waterline 
Defendants (1) had to prepare an environmental assessment and otherwise comply with HRS § 343-5 before burying the waterline under Kauaula Trail; and (2) obtain an MCC § 12.04.020 permit before trenching under Kauaula Trail. 
HRS § 343-5(a)(1) (2010 & Supp. 2021) required 
preparation of an environmental assessment for actions that "[p]ropose the use of state or county lands[.]"
5 
MCC § 12.04.020 (2000) required a permit to dig under 
any County public highway or thoroughfare. 
4 HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) provides, in relevant part: "If an appellate
court, when acting on a case on appeal, contemplates basing the disposition of
the case wholly or in part upon an issue of plain error not raised by theparties through briefing, it shall not affirm, reverse, or vacate the casewithout allowing the parties the opportunity to brief the potential plain-error issue prior to disposition." 
5 HRS § 343-5(a) describes nine actions for which an environmental
assessment is required, but Kia#i relied only on subsection (1). 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Thus, the motion for summary judgment presented the 
issue of whether Kauaula Trail was state or county land, or a 
County public highway or thoroughfare. 
Kia#i contended Kauaula Trail was owned by the County 
because (1) it was abandoned to the Kingdom of Hawai #i under The 
Highways Act, 1892, and (2) one of the Kingdom's successors (the Territory of 
Hawai#i or the State of Hawai #i) transferred title to 
the County "through HRS §§ 264-1 and -2[.]"6  
Wainee Land submitted evidence showing it owned Kauaula 
Trail where it was traversed by the waterline. 
The County denied owning Kauaula Trail and denied 
Kauaula Trail was a County public highway or thoroughfare. It argued that even if Kauaula Trail was abandoned to the Kingdom in 1892, it remains owned by the State, not by the County. 
6 HRS § 264-1 (Supp. 2017) provided, in relevant part: 
(b) All trails, and other nonvehicular rights-of-way in
the State declared to be public rights-of-ways by the
Highways Act of 1892, or opened, laid out, or built by thegovernment or otherwise created or vested as nonvehicularpublic rights-of-way at any time thereafter, or in thefuture, are declared to be public trails. A public trail is
under the jurisdiction of the state board of land andnatural resources unless it was created by or dedicated to aparticular county, in which case it shall be under the
jurisdiction of that county . 
(Emphasis added.) 
HRS § 264-2 (2020) provides, in relevant part: 
The ownership of all public highways and the land, real
estate and property of the same shall be in the governmentin fee simple. The term "government" as used herein meansthe State with reference to state highways and means therespective counties with reference to county highways. . . . 
The governor may, at any time by executive order, turn over
to any county, state land, in fee simple, for use as acounty highway, and the county involved shall thereafter beresponsible for its repair and maintenance as a countyhighway. 
The ownership of all county highways is transferred to and
vested in the respective counties in which the countyhighways lie. 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The County took the same position about another trail 
in McElroy v. McBarnet, No. CV 17-00009 LEK-RLP, 2017 WL 8316933 
(D. Haw. Aug. 21, 2017) (order). There, McElroy sued the County of Maui and others for a declaration that he was entitled to use a trail to access his property because "it is covered by the Highways Act of 1892 and is a Maui County highway pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. § 264-1." Id., 2017 WL 8316933, at *2. The federal district court dismissed the count for declaratory judgment because: 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 264-1 notes that there are two types of
public highways: state highways and county highways.§ 264-1(a)(1)-(2). Plaintiff has named Maui County as aparty to this suit, but not the State of Hawai #i or the 
relevant state agency. At the hearing on the Motion, MauiCounty represented that it does not have responsibility forthe road at issue in the instant matter — that it is not a county road. In short, it is possible that Plaintiff hasnot sued the proper party in this matter, and has thereforenot stated a claim upon which relief can be granted. 
Id., 2017 WL 8316933, at *5 (citing Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure Rule 12(b)(6)). 
The McElroy  court did not discuss whether the State was 
an indispensable party under Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but federal Rule 19 could have been applied. The parallel state rule, Hawai #i Rules of Civil Procedure ( HRCP) 
Rule 19, applies in this case. 
The relief sought by Kia #i was contingent upon Kauaula 
Trail having been abandoned to the Kingdom under The Highways Act, 1892. Kia#i
 did not sue the State for declaratory relief. 
The record does not reflect whether the State contends it owns, or ever owned, Kauaula Trail, or whether the State contends Kauaula Trail is owned by Wainee Land, the County, or some other person or entity. 
Should the State litigate the ownership issue against 
any party to this action, or any other party alleging the State owns Kauaula Trail, there would be a risk of inconsistent 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
results. For example, someone could sue the State because they 
were injured while using Kauaula Trail, alleging that the trail's condition posed "an unreasonable risk of harm." See Bhakta v. 
County. of Maui , 109 Hawai #i 198, 214, 124 P.3d 943, 959 (2005). 
The plaintiff would arguably not be bound by the Circuit Court's ruling in this case that Kauaula Trail is a County public highway or thoroughfare. 
A finding in the tort case that Kauaula Trail 
is a State highway would be inconsistent with the Circuit Court's declaration here. 
The State is thus a party "to be joined if feasible" 
under HRCP Rule 19(a). The Amended Complaint did not explain why the State was not joined, as required by HRCP Rule 19(c). 
Kia#i 
made no showing that the State could not have been made a party. See HRCP Rule 19(b). 
HRS § 632-1(b) (2016), which authorizes declaratory 
judgments, is a jurisdictional statute. Island Ins. Co. v. 
Perry, 94 Hawai #i 498, 502, 17 P.3d 847, 851 (App. 2000). The 
statute provides: "Relief by declaratory judgment may be granted in civil cases where an actual controversy exists between 
contending parties  . . . and the court is satisfied also that a 
declaratory judgment will serve to terminate the uncertainty or 
controversy  giving rise to the proceeding." 
(Emphasis added.) 
In Perry, a liability insurer sought a declaration that 
it had no duty to defend or indemnify its insured against liability for an auto accident. The insurer sued its insured and the accident victim, but later dismissed the insured. 
After a 
bench trial, the circuit court entered a judgment against the victim declaring that the insurer did not have a duty to defend or indemnify its (absent) insured. We held that the insured was "indispensable[,]" 94 Hawai #i at 501, 17 P.3d at 850, because he 
would not be bound by the declaratory judgment and, if found liable to the victim, could re-litigate the insurer's duty to indemnify him, id.  at 502, 17 P.3d at 851. 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Here, Kia #i contend Kauaula Trail was abandoned to the 
Kingdom of Hawai #i under The Highways Act, 1892, and title 
devolved to the County. The County contends that even if Kauaula 
Trail was abandoned to the Kingdom in 1892, title remains with 
the State. 
Wainee Land contends it owns Kauaula Trail. The 
State is not a party. Under these circumstances, the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction to enter a declaratory judgment that necessarily decided the ownership of Kauaula Trail. Perry, 94 Hawai#i at 502, 17 P.3d at 851; see also Haiku Plantations Ass'n 
v. Lono, 56 Haw. 96, 100, 529 P.2d 1, 4 (1974) (holding that trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter declaratory judgment about scope of easement because fee owner was not a party to the action). 
CONCLUSION 
The June 9, 2023 Final Judgment is vacated in part, and 
this case is remanded to the Circuit Court. On remand, the Circuit Court should enter: (1) an order dismissing Count 1 of the Amended Complaint for lack of jurisdiction; and (2) an amended judgment for all defendants and against Kia #i on Counts 2 
and 3 of the Amended Complaint, which should state that "all other claims, counterclaims, and cross-claims are dismissed." See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright , 76 Hawai #i 115, 
119 n.4, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 n.4 (1994).
