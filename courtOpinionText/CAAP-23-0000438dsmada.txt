Upon consideration of the November 10, 2023 Stipulation

all  parties  appearing  in  the  appeal;  and  (4)  dismissal  is

Therefore,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  the  stipulation  is 
approved  and  the  appeal  is  dismissed.   The  parties  shall  bear 
their  own  attorneys'  fees  and  costs  on  appeal. 
IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  all  pending  motions  are 
dismissed.
