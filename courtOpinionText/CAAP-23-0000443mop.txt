We vacate the Judgment and the order on DOE's motion
for taxation of costs, and affirm in part and vacate in part theorder granting DOE's motion for summary judgment, because:(1) Ohana's contract-based claims were not time-barred; but
(2) Ohana did not have "a fiduciary or confidential relation"
with DOE to support its common-law constructive fraud claim,
which was also time-barred; (3) the Circuit Court lacked
jurisdiction to enter a declaratory judgment about DOE's
entitlement to recover under the performance bonds; and (4) the
order taxing costs should be vacated because we are vacating the
Judgment.
BACKGROUND
Ohana contracted with DOE to upgrade or replace fire
alarm systems at Benjamin Parker  Elementary School, Dole Middle
School, Mililani Middle  School, Pu#uhale Elementary School, Waiau
Elementary School, Waihe#e Elementary School, Momilani  Elementary
School, and Mokulele  Elementary School.  Philadelphia Indemnity
Insurance Company ( PIIC) issued performance bonds for each
contract.
Ohana sued DOE on January 5, 2022.  The complaint
alleged that DOE breached each contract and the covenant of goodfaith and fair dealing implied in some.  It sought a declarationthat DOE could not recover on the Benjamin Parker, Dole, andMililani Middle performance bonds.
3  It alleged constructive
fraud, breach of contract, and breach of the implied covenant ofgood faith and fair dealing on DOE's claims under the BenjaminParker, Dole, and Mililani Middle bonds.

DOE moved for summary judgment.  The Circuit Court
entered findings of fact,4 conclusions of law, an order granting
the motion for summary judgment, and the Judgment.  DOE filed a timely post-judgment motion for taxation of costs, which theCircuit Court granted in part.  This appeal followed.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
We review a grant of summary judgment de novo.  Ralston
v. Yim, 129 Hawai #i 46, 55, 292 P.3d 1276, 1285 (2013).  Summary
judgment is appropriate if the evidence shows there is no genuineissue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled tojudgment as a matter of law.  Id.
  When the summary judgment
movant does not bear the burden of proof at trial, it has theburden to show (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact onthe essential elements of the claim addressed by the motion, and(2) the uncontroverted facts entitle it to judgment as a matterof law.  Id.
 at 56, 292 P.3d at 1286.
POINTS OF ERROR
Ohana's opening brief does not state points of error as
required by Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4). 
Ohana appears to contend the Circuit Court erred by: applying thewrong statute of limitations; determining there was no genuineissue of material fact about when Ohana's claims against DOEaccrued; concluding the constructive fraud claims lacked merit;concluding that declaratory relief was unwarranted and improper;and taxing the State's costs against Ohana.

DISCUSSION
1. Ohana's contract-based claims were not
time-barred.
DOE's motion for summary judgment argued that Hawaii
Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 661-5 applied to Ohana's contract-based
claims.  Relevant to this case, the statute provides:
Every claim against the State, cognizable under this
part, shall be forever barred unless the action is commencedwithin two years after the claim first accrues[.]
HRS § 661-5 (2016).  DOE offered the following evidence:
The Benjamin Parker contract was awarded on March 21,
2013.  DOE sent Ohana a notice to cure default dated August 3,2016.  DOE sent Ohana a Termination of Contract For Cause  dated
October 21, 2016.
The Dole contract was awarded on May 30, 2012.  DOE
sent Ohana a notice to cure default dated February 9, 2016.  DOEsent Ohana a Termination of Contract For Cause  dated October 18,
2016.
The Mililani Middle contract was awarded on
February 20, 2013.  DOE sent Ohana a notice to cure default datedDecember 4, 2015.  DOE sent Ohana a Termination of Contract For
Cause dated July 29, 2016.
The Pu#uhale contract was awarded on May 15, 2012.  DOE
sent Ohana a notice to cure default dated December 1, 2015.  DOEsent Ohana a Termination of Contract For Cause  dated May 9, 2016.
The Waiau contract was awarded on September 30, 2013. 
DOE sent Ohana a notice to cure default dated September 26, 2014. DOE sent Ohana a Notice of Termination  dated January 13, 2015.
The Waihe #e contract was awarded on October 25, 2012. 
DOE sent Ohana a notice to cure default dated February 19, 2015. DOE sent Ohana a Notice of Termination  dated June 2, 2015.
The Mokulele contract was awarded on September 25,
2012.  It was terminated for convenience by letter dated April 2,2015, before notice to proceed was issued.
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The Momilani contract was awarded on December 21, 2012. 
DOE sent Ohana a contract completion notice dated May 20, 2015. It stated, "this contract is deemed satisfactorily completed andaccordingly, final payment will be processed shortly."
DOE thus argued that Ohana's "contract-based claims
began to accrue in 2015 or 2016 . . . [and it] had until 2017 or2018 to assert its claims, but it failed to do so." 
Ohana argued that HRS § 661-5 didn't apply because
Ohana's exclusive remedy for DOE's breach of contract wasprescribed by the Hawaii Public Procurement Code , HRS
Chapter 103D, which contains its own statute of limitations.  
Ohana argued its "claims were either subject to the statute oflimitations in [HRS] § 103D-712 or, in the alternative, did notaccrue until [it] had gone through the administrative proceduresin HRS §[§] 103D-703 and 103D-711."
Subject to certain exceptions not applicable here, the
Procurement Code applies "to all procurement contracts made bygovernmental bodies[.]"  HRS § 103D-102 (2012 & Supp. 2014).  TheProcurement Code's procedures and remedies and the rules adoptedby the state procurement policy board are "the exclusive  means
available for persons aggrieved . . . in connection with acontract controversy, to resolve their claims or differences." HRS § 103D-704 (2012) (emphasis added); see
 Koga Eng'g & Constr.,
Inc. v. State , 122 Hawai #i 60, 86, 222 P.3d 979, 1005 (2010)
(discussing legislative history).
DOE contends that "the grievance process under the
Procurement Code was not applicable once the Subject Contractswere terminated" because Hawai #i Administrative Rules ( HAR)
§ 3-126-31 requires a contractor to "proceed diligently with
performance of this contract pending final resolution by acircuit court[.]"  DOE argues the rule "contemplates thatdisputes and claims would be resolved during the life of thecontract."
But HAR § 3-126-31 contains an exception "where there
has been a material breach of contract by the State[.]"  Wrongful
5NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
termination of a contract would be a material breach.  The
Procurement Code's dispute resolution provision applies to all"controversies between a governmental body and a contractor whicharise under, or by virtue of, a contract between them, including,without limitation, controversies based upon . . . rescission ." 
HRS § 103D-703(a) (2012) (emphasis added).  DOE's contention iscontrary to the plain language of HAR § 3-126-31 and HRS§ 103D-703(a).
Before suing DOE, Ohana had to obtain "a decision
issued pursuant to section 103D-703 by a state chief procurementofficer or a designee[.]"  HRS § 103D-711(a) (2012); Koga Eng'g
,
122 Hawai #i at 90-91, 222 P.3d at 1009-10 (holding that circuit
court lacked jurisdiction over retainage claim because Kogadidn't follow HRS § 103D-703 procedure).
DOE's chief procurement officer is the superintendent
of education.  HRS § 103D-203(a)(6) (2012 & Supp. 2021).  Ohanarequested a decision on its claims by letter dated February 19,2021.  DOE's chief procurement officer's designee denied Ohana'sclaims by letter dated July 6, 2021.  That is when Ohana's claimaccrued because that triggered Ohana's six-month deadline to sueDOE under HRS § 103D-712(c) (2012), which provides:
(c) Complaints to initiate judicial actions under
section 103D-711 shall be filed in the circuit court withinsix months of the issuance of a written determination undersection 103D-703.
Cf. Savini v. Univ. of Haw. , 113 Hawai #i 459, 466, 153 P.3d 1144,
1151 (2007) (construing medical-rehabilitative limit of motorvehicle insurance law to postpone accrual of tort claim untilthreshold was met).
We note that Ohana could have sued DOE as early as
May 20, 2021, under HRS § 103D-703(f).  That statute providesthat a contractor "may proceed as if an adverse decision had beenreceived" if a decision is not issued within ninety days after awritten request for one.  The language of HRS § 103D-703(f) ispermissive, not mandatory.  It triggers no deadline to sue.
6NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
DOE contends that Ohana's "logic would allow an
aggrieved contractor to pursue a contract claim against theState, even if the State terminated the contract decades
 ago, so
long as the contractor files suit within six months after receiptof an adverse decision."  DOE argues that would be "a patentlyabsurd and unjust result."  Were that so, the legislature couldhave addressed it by setting a deadline for contractors torequest an HRS § 103D-703 written determination.  It did not.  Acourt "cannot change the language of the statute, supply a want,or enlarge upon it in order to make it suit a certain state offacts."  State v. Abella
, 145 Hawai #i 541, 552, 454 P.3d 482, 493
(2019).
Ohana sued DOE on January 5, 2022 — one day before the
HRS § 103D-712(c) deadline.  Ohana's contract-based claims werenot time-barred.
2. Ohana cannot prove an element of its common-
law constructive fraud claim which, at anyrate, was also time-barred.
Ohana's complaint alleged that DOE committed insurance
fraud under HRS § 431:2-403
5 by making claims under the Benjamin
Parker, Dole, and Mililani Middle performance bonds "without anybasis for demanding payment[,]" and that DOE "breached its legalduty not to engage in insurance fraud."
DOE's motion for summary judgment argued Ohana lacked
standing to maintain a claim under HRS §§ 431:2-403 and 431:2-408, and Ohana did not have a fiduciary or confidentialrelationship with DOE.
Ohana conceded its constructive fraud claims were not
brought under HRS §§ 431:2-403 or 431:2-408.  It argued they were"based on Hawaii common law on constructive fraud."
5HRS § 431:2-403 (2019) criminalizes insurance fraud.  HRS § 431:2-
408 (2019) creates a civil cause of action for insurance fraud available to aninsurer or other licensee.  Ohana is neither an insurer as defined by HRS§ 431:1-202 (2019) nor a licensee as defined by HRS § 431:2-401 (2019).
7NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
DOE replied that Ohana's complaint failed to allege the
parties had a fiduciary or confidential relationship, and Ohananever moved to amend its complaint.
Common law constructive fraud "is characterized by the
breach of [a] fiduciary or confidential relationship."  Yoneji v.
Yoneji, 136 Hawai #i 11, 18, 354 P.3d 1160, 1167 (App. 2015).  It
"extends to all instances when a fiduciary or confidentialrelation exists as a fact, in which there is confidence reposedon one side and a resulting superiority and influence on theother."  Id.
 at 18–19, 354 P.3d at 1167–68.
Ohana argued it had a "special or confidential
relationship" with DOE under HRS § 103D-306 (sole-source procurement), HRS § 103D-312 (fair and reasonable pricing policy;cost or pricing data), and these provisions of HRS § 103D-101:
(a) All public employees shall conduct and
participate in public procurement in an ethical manner.  Inconducting and participating in procurement, publicemployees shall:
(1) Act as a fiduciary and trustee of public moneys;. . . .(3) Act only in the public interest; [and]. . . .(5) Identify and maximize efficiencies in the public
procurement process[.]
. . . .(c) All parties involved in the negotiation,
performance, or administration of state contracts shall actin good faith.
HRS § 103D-101 (2012).
None of the cited statutes creates a fiduciary or
confidential relationship where DOE had "superiority andinfluence" over Ohana.  Ohana failed to establish that element ofits common law constructive fraud claim.  The Circuit Court didnot err by granting summary judgment for DOE on that claim.  See
Ralston, 129 Hawai #i at 60, 292 P.3d at 1290 (summary judgment
8NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
may be granted where opposing party unable to satisfy its burden
of proof).
Alternatively, Ohana's common law constructive fraud
claims were time-barred.  They were based upon DOE's claims onthe performance bonds.  The initial claims were made beforeAugust 29, 2017, when PIIC sued Ohana in federal court.  See
Phila. Indem. Ins. Co. v. Ohana Control Sys., Inc. , 450
F. Supp. 3d 1043, 1049-50 (D. Haw. 2020).  Ohana's claims accruedat the latest in 2019, when DOE made a demand under the bonds. Id.
  The statute of limitations is "two years after the claim
first accrues[.]"  HRS § 661-5 (2016).  Ohana's complaint belowwas filed on January 5, 2022.  Its common law constructive fraudclaims were time-barred.
3. The Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction to
enter a declaratory judgment about DOE'sentitlement to recover under the performancebonds.
Ohana's complaint sought declarations that DOE was not
entitled to recover under the Benjamin Parker, Dole, and MililaniMiddle performance bonds.  DOE's motion for summary judgmentargued that the declaratory judgment statute, HRS § 632-1,provides relief only "where an actual controversy exists betweencontending parties" and PIIC, a contending party, was not a partyto the action.
Ohana argued that DOE was actually saying PIIC was an
indispensable party, which it was not.
DOE replied that PIIC was an indispensable party.In Island Ins. Co. v. Perry
, 94 Hawai #i 498, 17 P.3d
847 (App. 2000), we stated that HRS § 632–1 (1993) wasjurisdictional.  Id.
 at 502, 17 P.3d at 851.  The statute still
provides: "Relief by declaratory judgment may be granted in civilcases where an actual controversy exists between contending
parties . . . and the court is satisfied also that a declaratory
judgment will serve to terminate the uncertainty or controversy
9NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
giving rise to the proceeding."  HRS § 632-1 (2016) (emphasis
added).
DOE's entitlement to recover under the performance
bonds is a controversy that exists (if at all) between DOE andPIIC.  PIIC is a party "to be joined if feasible" under Hawai #i
Rules of Civil Procedure ( HRCP) Rule 19(a).  Ohana's complaint
did not state the reason PIIC was not joined, as required by HRCP
Rule 19(c).  Ohana made no showing that PIIC could not have beenmade a party.  See
 HRCP Rule 19(b).  A declaratory judgment that
DOE is entitled to recover under the performance bonds — the
corollary should Ohana lose its claim — would not "serve toterminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to theproceeding" because PIIC would not be bound.  Perry
, 94 Hawai #i
at 502, 17 P.3d at 851; HRS § 632-1(b).
Because PIIC — one of the "contending parties" — was
not a party to the action below, and because Ohana did not showthat PIIC could not have been made a party, the Circuit Courtlacked jurisdiction to enter a declaratory judgment about DOE'sentitlement to recover under PIIC's performance bonds.  "Lack ofsubject-matter jurisdiction means that a court is without powerto decide the merits of a case."  Schwartz v. State
, 136 Hawai #i
258, 262, 361 P.3d 1161, 1165 (2015).  The Circuit Court shouldhave dismissed Ohana's declaratory judgment counts, rather thanenter summary judgment for DOE and against Ohana on them.  See
Perry, 94 Hawai #i at 502, 17 P.3d at 851.
4.  The order taxing costs is vacated.
Because we are vacating the Judgment, we also vacate
the order granting in part and denying in part DOE's motion fortaxation of costs.  Cf.
 Ass'n of Owners of Kalele Kai v.
Yoshikawa , 149 Hawai #i 417, 420, 493 P.3d 939, 942 (2021)
(stating that "an award of attorneys' fees is inappropriate wherethe underlying judgment is vacated").
10NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
CONCLUSION
The July 17, 2023 Judgment  is vacated.  The summary 
judgments for DOE and against Ohana are affirmed as to Counts 4,10, and 16 of Ohana's complaint, but vacated as to the remainingcounts other than Counts 3, 9, and 15.  This case is remanded tothe Circuit Court for further proceedings not inconsistent withthis memorandum opinion.  On remand, the Circuit Court shouldenter an order dismissing Counts 3, 9, and 15 for lack ofjurisdiction.
