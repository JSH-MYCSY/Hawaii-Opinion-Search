Circuit Court of the First Circuit ( Circuit Court ), in which the 
Circuit Court denied Carter's request to reduce the $3,300,000.00 
($3.3 million ) bail amount.   
3 2
2 The Honorable Ronald G. Johnson presided. 
3 Carter challenges the Circuit Court's January 31, 2023 and May 9,
2023 bail rulings pertaining to Carter's January 9, 2023 motion to set bail and
March 14, 2023 motion to reduce bail. At the time Carter filed his August 22,2023 Notice of Appeal, the record contained no orders reflecting the dispositionof Carter's bail motions. After Carter filed the Notice of Appeal, the Circuit
Court entered the Order Denying Bail Reduction that included the bail rulings
Carter challenges on appeal. We address Carter's challenges in the context ofthe September 1, 2023 Order Denying Bail Reduction, which is an appealable
order. See State v. Johnson, 96 Hawai ‘i 462, 470 n.12, 32 P.3d 106, 114 n.12
(App. 2001) (explaining that orders appealable under the collateral order
exception in criminal cases include "denial of pretrial motions to reducebail"). The August 22, 2023 Notice of Appeal is "deemed to have been filed on
the date" of the September 1, 2023 Order Denying Bail Reduction. Hawai ‘i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 4(b)(4). 
4 Carter's Opening Brief does not comply with HRAP Rule 28 in multiple
respects, and does not contain any record references. Despite non-compliance
with the HRAP, Carter's legal argument is discernible, and we endeavor to afford
"litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where
possible." Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai ‘i 490, 496, 280 P.3d 88, 94 (2012)
(cleaned up); see Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai ‘i 368, 380-81, 465 P.3d 815, 827-28
(2020) (applying liberal review to pleadings by self-represented litigants "to
facilitate access to justice" and to afford opportunity for appellate reviewdespite non-compliance with court rules). While Carter did not providetranscripts of the January 31, 2023 and May 9, 2023 hearings from which he
appeals pursuant to HRAP Rule 10(b)(1)(A), we are able to glean the necessary
background from court minutes, filings in the Circuit Court, and the proceduralhistory set forth in the Order Denying Bail Reduction. 
5 Carter relies on the Eighth Amendment of the United States
Constitution, which states: "Excessive bail shall not be required, norexcessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted." 
While Carter cites Article I, "Section 9" of the Hawai ‘i 
Constitution, he quotes from Article I, Section 12 , which is pertinent here;
this provision states: "Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessivefines imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishment inflicted. The court may

 __FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER__ 
to a "reasonable" amount of $100,000.00, in violation of Hawaii 
Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 804-9.6 
We hold that after making findings to support a denial 
of bail under subsections (b) and (d) of HRS § 804-3, the Circuit 
Court abused its discretion by electing to set cash bail of $3.3 
million instead, and by finding that such amount was reasonable, in violation of HRS § 804-9. 
I. BACKGROUND 
August 30, 2022 initial bail status in Circuit Court was
"no bail" 
On August 26, 2022, Carter was indicted by the 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai ‘
i (State) for five counts: 
Attempted Murder in the Second Degree in violation of HRS 
§§ 705-500, 707-701.5, and 706-656 (Count One); Murder in the Second Degree in violation of HRS §§ 707-701.5 and 706-656 (Count Two); Ownership or Possession Prohibited of any Firearm or 
Ammunition by a Person Convicted of Certain Crimes in violation of 
HRS §§ 134-7(b) and (h) (Count Three); Carrying or Use of Firearm in the Commission of a Separate Felony in violation of HRS § 134-21 (Count Four); and Carrying or Use of a Firearm in the Commission of a Separate Felony in violation of HRS § 134-21 
dispense with bail if reasonably satisfied that the defendant or witness will
appear when directed, except for a defendant charged with an offense punishableby life imprisonment." 
6 Carter quotes from HRS "§ 709-9," which is the predecessor version
of the current statute, HRS § 804-9. HRS § 804-9 (2014 & 2022 Supp.), entitled"Amount," provides: 
The amount of bail rests in the discretion of the justice or
judge or the officers named in section 804-5 and shall be set
in a reasonable amount based upon all available information,including the offense alleged, the possible punishment uponconviction, and the defendant's financial ability to affordbail. The bail amount should be so determined as not to suffer 
the wealthy to escape by the payment of a pecuniary penalty,
nor to render the privilege useless to the poor.

(Count Five). On August 30, 2022, an Order Pertaining to Bail 
(OPB
) was filed, which ordered Carter to be "held without bail" 
(no bail ).7   
On January 9, 2023, Carter filed a Motion for Supervised 
Release or, in the Alternative, to Set Bail ( Motion to Set Bail ), 
arguing that there had been no hearing or findings supporting no bail, as required by HRS § 804-3.
   In response to the Motion to 8
7 The Order Denying Bail Reduction noted in Finding of Fact ( FOF) 5
that at the time the August 30, 2022 OPB of no bail was filed, an August 26,
2022 Pretrial Bail Report ( PBR) had been filed under 1DCW-22-0002294 (initial
criminal felony complaint filed in district court) by the Oahu Intake ServicesCenter (OISC), which recommended against any supervised release for Carter
because Carter "did not have a stable residence"; Carter's "employment could not
be verified and a representative of [Carter]'s alleged employer indicated theyare not familiar with [Carter]"; Carter "ha[d] a criminal record in Nevada,Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, and Hawaii"; and Carter "scored as a 'high' risklevel" based on the pretrial risk assessment OISC conducted. 
8 HRS § 804-3 (2014), entitled "Bailable offenses," states: 
(a) For purposes of this section, "serious crime" means
murder or attempted murder in the first degree, murder or
attempted murder in the second degree, or a class A or B
felony, except forgery in the first degree and failing torender aid under section 291C-12, and "bail" includes releaseon one's own recognizance, supervised release, and conditionalrelease. 
(b) Any person charged with a criminal offense shall be
bailable by sufficient sureties; provided that bail may bedenied where the charge is for a serious crime, and: 
(1) There is a serious risk that the person will flee; 
(2) There is a serious risk that the person will
obstruct or attempt to obstruct justice, or therefore, injure,
or intimidate, or attempt to thereafter, injure, or
intimidate, a prospective witness or juror; 
(3) There is a serious risk that the person poses a
danger to any person or the community; or 
(4) There is a serious risk that the person will engage
in illegal activity. 
(c) Under subsection (b)(1) a rebuttable presumption
arises that there is a serious risk that the person will fleeor will not appear as directed by the court where the person
is charged with a criminal offense punishable by imprisonmentfor life without possibility of parole. For purposes of

Set Bail, the OISC submitted a letter to the Circuit Court noting 
that: 
"The Oahu Intake Service Center (OISC) has not filed any
previous Pretrial Bail Reports in the current case as thedefendant is being held without bail." OISC also cited H.R.S.§ 353-10
9 and noted that persons detained without bail are not 
subsection (b)(3) and (4) a rebuttable presumption arises thatthe person poses a serious danger to any person or communityor will engage in illegal activity where the court determinesthat: 
(1) The defendant has been previously convicted of a
serious crime involving violence against a person within theten-year period preceding the date of the charge against thedefendant; 
(2) The defendant is already on bail on a felony charge
involving violence against a person; or 
(3) The defendant is on probation or parole for a
serious crime involving violence to a person. 
(d) If, after a hearing the court finds that no
condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assurethe appearance of the person when required or the safety ofany other person or community, bail may be denied. 
HRS § 804-3 was amended to its current form in 1987. There is no Hawai ‘i 
case law that analyzes the current version of HRS § 804-3 in the contextof orders denying bail. 
9 HRS § 353-10 (2015 & 2022 Supp.), entitled "Intake service centers,"
provides in subsection (b) that the centers shall: 
(3) Conduct internal pretrial risk assessments on adult
offenders within three working days of admission to a
community correctional center; provided that this paragraphshall not apply to persons subject to county or statedetainers or holds, persons detained without bail, personsdetained for probation violation, persons facing revocation of
bail or supervised release, and persons who have had a
pretrial risk assessment completed prior to admission to acommunity correctional center. . . . 
. . . .

 Provide pretrial bail reports to the courts on adult
offenders, within three working days of admission of theoffender to a community correctional center, that are orderedby the court or consented to by the offender. A complete copy
of the executed pretrial risk assessment . . . shall be
included in the pretrial bail report. . . .

eligible for a pretrial risk assessment. H.R.S. § 353-
10(b)(3). OISC further stated: "Should bail be set in this
matter the OISC would be able to address a Motion for 
Supervised Release in this case." 
FOF 8 (footnote added). 
January 31, 2023 hearing: Bail set at $3.3 million 
to obtain an updated pretrial bail report 
At the January 31, 2023 hearing on the Motion to Set 
Bail, Carter requested a bail amount of "$100,000" to be set. The
State argued that Carter's no bail status pursuant to HRS § 804-3 should continue, as "there was a rebuttable presumption of detention" and that Carter "posed a danger to the community and a flight risk."  The Circuit Court further explained, in FOFs 12 
and 13, that while it believed Carter qualified to be held without
bail under HRS § 804-3, it set a bail amount so an updated PBR 
could be obtained from OISC: 10 
 
12. The Court at the time of the January 1 [sic],11 2023 
hearing, did believe given the charges and the factual
information presented, that Defendant qualified for andwas subject to, being held without bail pursuant to H.R.S.§ 804-3. 
(Emphases added.) It appears in this case that a PBR in accordance with
this statute was completed on August 26, 2022 and filed in the earlier
district court case, not in the Circuit Court case. 
10 In the September 1, 2023 Order Denying Bail Reduction, the Circuit
Court explained in FOF 11 that it found the $3.3 million "to be reasonable"
based on, inter alia, the serious crimes Carter was charged with; the possible
penalties he faced if convicted; Carter's criminal record in Hawai ‘i, Nevada,
Florida, Illinois, and New Jersey, including felony offenses; Carter's arrests
for contempt of court and parole violations indicating risk of flight and non-
compliance with court orders; Carter's conviction and arrest for the violent
crime of robbery; possessing a firearm as a felon; and Carter's severe mentalhealth diagnosis and reported use of illicit substances prior to enteringcustody. 
11 It appears that the Circuit Court was actually referring to the
January 31, 2023 bail hearing, and the January 1, 2023 reference is erroneous. 
6  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  __FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER__ 
13. The Court's setting of bail in this matter allowed the
production of an updated PBR.12 An updated PBR would allow
for further review of any combination of bail conditions
that might address the risks of flight and dangerousness. 
(Footnotes added.) After the hearing, the Circuit Court then 
filed a January 31, 2023 OPB that set an aggregate bail amount of $3.3 million. 
On March 14, 2023, Carter filed another Motion for 
Supervised Release or, in the Alternative, to Reduce Bail ( Motion 
to Reduce Bail ), requesting that the $3.3 million bail be reduced 
to "$100,000." On March 16, 2023, an updated PBR recommended against any supervised release, and noted that Carter did not have a "stable residence," had no verifiable employment, had a 
12 While the statute cited by OISC, HRS § 353-10(b), appears to apply
to the preparation of an initial PBR with pretrial risk assessment within the
first "three working days" of a detainee's admission to a community correctionalcenter, the Circuit Court is entitled to periodic reviews and recommendationsfor a pretrial detainee's bail status based on "new information or a change in
circumstances" under HRS § 353-6.2 (2015 & 2022 Supp.). This statute, entitled
"Community correctional centers; periodic reviews of pretrial detainees,"provides: 
(a) The relevant community correctional centers, on a
periodic basis but no less frequently than every three months,shall conduct reviews of pretrial detainees to reassesswhether a detainee should remain in custody or whether newinformation or a change in circumstances warrantsreconsideration of a detainee's pretrial release or
supervision. 
(b) For each review conducted pursuant to subsection
(a), the relevant community correctional center shall transmit
its findings and recommendations by correspondence or
electronically to the appropriate court, prosecuting attorney,
and defense counsel. 
(c) If a motion to modify bail is filed pursuant to a
recommendation made pursuant to subsection (b), a hearing
shall be scheduled at which the court shall consider the 
motion. 
(Emphases added.) HRS § 353-6.2 does not contain any exclusion on the court'sability to obtain a periodic review report, unlike HRS § 353-10(b)(3)'s
exclusion of certain categories of pretrial detainees from having pretrial risk
assessments prepared.

"criminal record in Nevada, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, and 
Hawaii," and that Carter was "scored as a 'high' risk." Another PBR was filed on April 5, 2023, noting that Carter's proposed supervised release sponsors declined to sponsor Carter. The 
Circuit Court took judicial notice of the PBRs. 
May 9, 2023 hearing: Bail reduction denied and bail 
remains $3.3 million 
At the May 9, 2023 hearing on the Motion to Reduce Bail, 
the court minutes reflect that Carter testified, defense exhibits 
A through C were received,
13 and the Circuit Court denied the bail 
reduction. This ruling was reflected in the subsequently filed September 1, 2023 Order Denying Bail Reduction, in which the Circuit Court made findings under HRS § 804-3, that because the 
statute stated that bail "may be denied" and did not require that 
bail be denied, the Circuit Court maintained the $3.3 million bail 
amount and denied the requested reduction to $100,000.00.
14 
13 The following exhibits were received into evidence: the January 31,
2023 OPB setting bail at $3.3 million (Exhibit A); a Bank of Hawaii banking
statement reflecting Carter's savings of "$875.49" (Exhibit B); and an October
27, 2022 complaint filed against Carter for "$543.35" in unpaid rent (Exhibit
C). 
14 The Order Denying Bail Reduction states in pertinent part: 
FINDINGS OF FACT 
. . . . 
33.
 Given the charges and the factual information presented,
the rebuttable presumption of detention without bail is
applicable, pursuant to H.R.S.§ 804-3. Defendant may be denied
bail based upon the charges and the facts as presented to theCourt, there is a serious risk that Defendant will flee and aserious risk that Defendant poses a danger to any person orthe community. The Court elects not to deny defendant bail inthis instance. 
34. Bail in the amount of $3,300,000 was previously set by the
Court and the Court finds it to be reasonable given the
totality of the circumstances. Id. at 1.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
. . . . 
6.
 HRS § 803(b)(l) states, in pertinent part, "[a]ny person
charged with a criminal offense shall be bailable by
sufficient sureties; provided that bail may be denied wherethe charge is for a serious crime, and there is a serious risk
that the person will flee." 
7. "Under subsection (b)(l) a rebuttable presumption arises
that there is a serious risk that the person will flee or willnot appear as directed by the court where the person is
charged with a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for
life without possibility of parole." HRS § 804-3(c). 
8. The penalty for Attempted Murder in the Second Degree and
Murder in the Second Degree is life imprisonment with the
possibility of parole. HRS § 706-656(2). The State has given
Defendant notice of his eligibility to be sentenced to anextended term of imprisonment, which increases the potentialpenalty that he is facing to life imprisonment without thepossibility of parole. HRS § 706-661(1). 
9. The Court finds that Defendant is charged with multiple
serious crimes under HRS § 804-3(b) and poses a serious flightrisk under HRS § 804-3(b)(l). 
10. Further, bail may also be "denied where the charge is for
a serious crime, and ... [t]here is a serious risk that theperson poses a danger to any person or the community." HRS §804-3(b)(3). 
11. The Court finds that Defendant poses a serious risk of
danger to any person or the community under HRS § 804(b)(3)based on the alleged facts of the current offenses. 
12. The Court has not been presented with a condition or
combination of conditions that will reasonably assure theappearance of Defendant when required or the safety of anyother person or community." HRS § 804-3(d). 
13. Under the circumstances bail may be denied pursuant to
H.R.S. § 804-3, however, there is not a requirement to do so. 
14. Defendant poses a serious risk of flight and a serious
danger to any person or the community. The Court has applied
its wide discretion in considering the foregoing factors, such
as Defendant's pecuniary situation and the maximum potentialpenalty for the charges in the indictment. Sakamoto v. Won BaeChang [sic], 56 Haw. 447, 539 P.2d 1197 (1975). The Courtfinds that the current bail in the amount of $3,300,000 is
reasonable at this time.

 __FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER__ 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
Release on Bail: "The decision whether to grant a 
motion for release on bail . . . requires a judgment call" by the 
trial court; and decisions "requir[ing] a 'judgment call' on the 
part of the trial court, are reviewed for an abuse of discretion." 
State v. Cullen, 86 Hawai ‘i 1, 9, 946 P.2d 955, 963 (1997) (cleaned 
up). "The trial court abuses its discretion when it clearly 
It appears that the Circuit Court cited to Sakamoto v. Won Bae
Chang, 56 Haw. 447, 539 P.2d 1197 (1975), for the proposition that the court has
wide discretion in determining the amount of bail. Carter also relies on Sakamoto, which the State argues is distinguishable, as it is unclear inSakamoto "what were the relevant facts[,]" and because "the statutes relating to
bail have been amended and bec[a]me more detailed since[.]" 
In Sakamoto, the petitioner argued that bail in the amount of
"$300,000" was "in effect a denial of his right to be admitted to bail." Id. at 
449, 539 P.2d at 1199. Sakamoto construed the predecessor version of HRS § 804-3, which is now obsolete. The prior version of HRS § 804-3 stated: "All 
persons charged with criminal offenses shall be bailable by sufficient sureties,unless for offenses punishable by imprisonment for life not subject to parole,when the proof is evident or the presumption great." Id.Under this obsolete 
statute, the Sakamoto Court found that the State "did not sustain [its] burden
that there [was] a fair likelihood that the petitioner [was] in danger of a jury
verdict against him for murder in the first degree[,]" and thus the petitionerwas entitled to bail. Id. at 449-50, 539 P.2d at 1199. The supreme court thenlooked to the predecessor version of the bail amount statute, HRS § 804-9, whichstated: 
The amount of bail rests in the discretion of the justice orjudge or the officers named in section 709-5; but should be sodetermined as not to suffer the wealthy to to [sic] escape bythe payment of a pecuniary penalty, nor to render the
privilege useless to the poor. In all cases, the officer
letting to bail should consider the punishment to be inflictedon conviction, and the pecuniary circumstances of the partyaccused. 
Id. at 450, 539 P.2d at 1199. Under this predecessor version of HRS § 804-9 and
Article I, Section 12 of the Hawai ‘i Constitution, the Sakamoto Court concluded 
that the $300,000 bail amount was excessive, where the lower court found that
petitioner "'[was] not of means,'" that "'pecuniary circumstances of the
[petitioner] would not be the basis on which a high bail can be set[,]'" and
"[n]o evidence has been presented that [petitioner] would not be present at anyof these proceedings should be [sic] not be held in custody[.]" Id. at 450-51,539 P.2d at 1199-200. While the Circuit Court and the parties all referenced toSakamoto, a 1975 case, we conclude that Sakamoto's construction of obsolete 
versions of HRS §§ 804-3 and 804-9 renders it inapposite and unhelpful to our
contemporary application of the current versions of these statutes in this case. 
10  
  
 
 __FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER__ 
exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles of 
law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." Id. (citations omitted). 
Amount of Bail: "It is settled that the determination 
of the amount of bail rests peculiarly within the discretion of the trial court. An appellate court should not disturb or interfere with the exercise of such discretion, unless it is 
clearly abused." State v. Henley, 136 Hawai ‘i
 471, 478, 363 P.3d 
319, 326 (2015) (citation omitted). 
Statutory Construction:  The interpretation of a statute 
is reviewed de novo. 
State v. Choy Foo, 142 Hawai ‘i 65, 72, 414 
P.3d 117, 124 (2018). 
The court's construction of statutes is 
guided by the following rules: 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself. Second,
where the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, our
sole duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning.Third, implicit in the task of statutory construction is ourforemost obligation to ascertain and give effect to theintention of the legislature, which is to be obtained
primarily from the language contained in the statute itself.
Fourth, when there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, orindistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used in astatute, an ambiguity exists. 
Id. (citation omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION 
Carter argues, inter alia, that the Circuit Court set 
"excessive" bail in the amount of $3.3 million in violation of 
Article I, Section 12 of the Hawai ‘i Constitution and HRS § 804-9, 
as he is a "poor person." The State argues that the Circuit Court 
did not abuse its discretion, where it could have "detained Carter without bail as provided in HRS § 804-3(b)[,]" but chose to not do so and instead found that $3.3 million "was reasonable given the 
totality of the circumstances." 
11  
  
 
  
 
  
 
 __FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER__ 
A. The setting of cash bail under HRS § 804-9 entails a
financial circumstances analysis, which is distinct
and different from the risk analyses for denial of
bail under HRS § 804-3(b) and (d). 
Under the HRS, a criminal pretrial defendant is 
ordinarily entitled to a presumption of bail. "If the charge is 
for an offense for which bail is allowable under section 804-3, the defendant may be admitted to bail before conviction as a matter of right and under the least restrictive conditions 
required to ensure the defendant's appearance and to protect the 
public. . . ." HRS § 804-4(a) (2014 & 2022 Supp.) (emphasis added). "Any person charged with a criminal offense shall be bailable by sufficient sureties; provided that bail may be denied where the charge is for a serious crime . . . ." HRS § 804-3(b). 
HRS § 804-1 (2014) defines "bail" as: 
Bail, or the giving of bail, is the signing of the
recognizance by the defendant and the defendant's surety orsureties, conditioned for the appearance of the defendant atthe session of a court of competent jurisdiction to be namedin the condition, and to abide by the judgment of the court. 
"Bail" is generally defined as "[a] security such as cash, a bond, 
or property; esp., security required by a court for the release of a criminal defendant who must appear in court at a future time." Black's Law Dictionary 167 (10th ed. 2014). HRS § 804-3(a) further explains that, under that statute, "'bail' includes release on one's own recognizance, supervised release, and 
conditional release." There are also mandatory "[g]eneral 
conditions of release on bail" that apply to all persons released on any of the different types of bail, under HRS § 804-7.4.
15 
15 HRS § 804-7.4 (2014), entitled "General conditions of release on
bail," provides: 
Any person released on bail, recognizance, supervised release
or conditional release shall be released subject to the
following conditions: 
12  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 __FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER__ 
1. Setting of cash bail is governed by HRS § 804-9. 
As to monetary or "cash" bail, HRS § 804-9 specifically 
requires that the amount be "reasonable," which is determined 
based on "all available information, including the offense 
alleged, the possible punishment upon conviction, and the 
defendant's financial ability to afford bail." HRS § 804-9 circumscribes a court's discretion with the admonition that the cash bail amount "should be so determined as not to suffer the wealthy to escape by the payment of a pecuniary penalty, nor to render the privilege useless to the poor." Thus, a key component 
of setting cash bail under HRS § 804-9 involves analyzing the 
financial circumstances of the defendant, and setting an amount that does not discriminate against indigent defendants and advantage defendants with financial means. 
2. Denial of bail based on risk is governed by HRS
§ 804-3. 
Bail denial for serious crime and serious risk under 
HRS § 804-3(b).  Under HRS § 804-3(b), a person "may be denied" 
bail for a "serious crime" and if the trial court finds any of the 
"serious risk[s]" in (b)(1) through (b)(4) are present: 
(1) There is a serious risk that the person will flee; 
(2) There is a serious risk that the person will obstruct or
attempt to obstruct justice, or therefore, injure, or
intimidate, or attempt to thereafter, injure, or
intimidate, a prospective witness or juror; 
(3) There is a serious risk that the person poses a danger to
any person or the community; or 
(1) The person shall not commit a federal, state or localoffense during the period of release; 
(2) The person shall appear for all court hearings unlessnotified by the person's attorney that the person's appearanceis not required; and 
(3) The person shall remain in the State of Hawaii unless
approval is obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction to
leave the jurisdiction of the court.

(4) There is a serious risk that the person will engage in
illegal activity. 
A "serious crime" under HRS § 804-3 means "murder or attempted 
murder in the first degree, murder or attempted murder in the second degree, or a class A or B felony, except forgery in the first degree and failing to render aid under section 291C-12[.]" HRS § 804-3(a). HRS § 804-3(c) sets forth the criteria for the 
various rebuttable presumptions that may apply to any of the 
applicable "serious risk" findings for a "serious crime" denial of bail under subsection (b), such as "serious risk" of flight under (b)(1), "serious risk" of danger to a person or the community under (b)(3), and "serious risk" of illegal activity under (b)(4). Thus, the bail denial determination under HRS § 804-3(b) involves 
a "serious crime" determination and an analysis of the "serious 
risk" posed by the defendant. 
Bail denial for no risk-mitigating bail conditions under 
HRS § 804-3(d).  Under HRS § 804-3(d), "[i]f, after a hearing the 
court finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person when required or the safety of any other person or community, bail may be denied." 
Thus, the bail denial determination under HRS § 804-3(d) involves 
an analysis of whether any risk-mitigating bail conditions
16 may be 
16 These conditions are set forth in HRS § 804-7.1 (2014 & 2022 Supp.),
entitled "Conditions of release on bail, recognizance, or supervised release,"
which provides in pertinent part: 
Upon the defendant's release on bail, recognizance, or
supervised release, however, the court may enter an order: 
(1) Prohibiting the defendant from approaching or
communicating with particular persons or classes of persons,
except that no such order should be deemed to prohibit anylawful and ethical activity of defendant's counsel; 
(2) Prohibiting the defendant from going to certain
described geographical areas or premises; 
14  
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 __FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER__ 
imposed to provide reasonable assurance against a risk of non-
appearance, or a risk to public safety. If the court determines no risk-mitigating bail conditions or combination of conditions exist under HRS § 804-3(d), then a denial of bail is appropriate.
17 
(3) Prohibiting the defendant from possessing any
dangerous weapon, engaging in certain described activities, or
indulging in intoxicating liquors or certain drugs; 
(4) Requiring the defendant to report regularly to and
remain under the supervision of an officer of the court; 
(5) Requiring the defendant to maintain employment, or,
if unemployed, to actively seek employment, or attend aneducational or vocational institution; 
(6) Requiring the defendant to comply with a specified
curfew; 
(7) Requiring the defendant to seek and maintain mental
health treatment or testing, including treatment for drug oralcohol dependency, or to remain in a specified institutionfor that purpose; 
(8) Requiring the defendant to remain in the
jurisdiction of the judicial circuit in which the charges arepending unless approval is obtained from a court of competentjurisdiction to leave the jurisdiction of the court; 
(9) Requiring the defendant to submit to the use of
electronic monitoring and surveillance; 
(10) Requiring the confinement of the defendant in the
defendant's residence[.] 
17 While not referenced in the Order Denying Bail Reduction that we
review here, there is another bail denial provision set forth in HRS§ 804-7.1, in addition to the bail denial provisions in subsection (b) and (d)
of HRS § 804-3. This bail denial provision under HRS § 804-7.1 states: 
Upon a showing that there exists a danger that the defendant
will commit a serious crime or will seek to intimidate witnesses, or will otherwise unlawfully interfere with the
orderly administration of justice, the judicial officer named
in section 804-5 may deny the defendant's release on bail,recognizance, or supervised release. 
While bail denial under HRS § 804-7.1 contains a similar reference to "serious
crime" as in HRS § 804-3, it does not reference HRS § 804-3 or define "serious
crime." HRS § 804-3 defines "serious crime," but for "purposes of [that]section" only.

 __FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER__ 
B. The Circuit Court made the required findings for a
denial of bail for a "serious crime" and "serious 
risk" under HRS § 804-3(b), and no risk-mitigating
bail conditions under HRS § 804-3(d). 
Here, with regard to the "serious crime" and "serious 
risk" analysis under subsection (b), the Circuit Court found 
Carter was charged with a "serious crime" in each of the five counts in the Indictment under HRS § 804-3(a). The Circuit Court found under (b)(1) that Carter was "charged with multiple serious 
crimes under HRS § 804-3(b) and poses a serious flight risk under 
HRS § 804-3(b)(1)." Conclusion of Law ( COL) 9. The Circuit Court 
applied the rebuttable presumption of serious risk of flight under subsection (c), where "[t]he penalty for Attempted Murder in the Second Degree is life imprisonment with the possibility of parole[,]" and the "State has given [Carter] notice of his eligibility to be sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment, 
which increases the potential penalty . . . to life imprisonment 
without the possibility of parole." COLs 7-8. The Circuit Court also found under subsection (b)(3), that Carter "pose[d] a serious risk of danger to any person or the community" "based on the alleged facts of the current offenses." COLs 10-11. Even though the Circuit Court made the required findings for a denial of bail 
under the "serious crime" prong in HRS § 804-3(b), the Circuit 
Court elected not to deny bail in this case. 
Here, with regard to the analysis of any risk-mitigating 
bail conditions under HRS § 804-3(d), the Circuit Court concluded that: "The Court has not been presented with a condition or combination of conditions that will reasonably assure the appearance of [Carter] when required or the safety of any other 
person or community." COL 12. Despite its conclusion that no 
bail conditions or combination of bail conditions could reasonably assure Carter's appearance or public safety, the Circuit Court elected not to deny bail in this case. We note, however, that it 
16  
     
 
  
 
 
 
 
 __FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER__ 
appears inconsistent for the Circuit Court to find, on the one 
hand, that no bail conditions could mitigate the non-appearance and public safety risks posed by Carter; and on the other hand, to then set cash bail in the face of such risks. 
Despite making findings sufficient to deny bail under 
both HRS § 804-3(b) and (d), the Circuit Court explained in FOF 33 and COL 13,
18 that the statute's use of the term "may" in stating 
"bail may be denied" in subsections (b) and (d), meant that the Circuit Court had discretion to deny bail or to elect not to do so. This is a correct interpretation of the plain meaning of 
"bail may be denied," and the Circuit Court had discretion to 
elect not to deny bail outright. See Choy Foo, 142 Hawai ‘i at 72, 
414 P.3d at 124. However, once the Circuit Court decided to set 
cash bail as an alternative, it was required to exercise its discretion in accordance with the law governing setting the amount 
of cash bail, i.e. HRS § 804-9 and its requirement that the amount 
be "reasonable." The Circuit Court did not properly exercise its discretion in determining the amount of cash bail in this case. 
18 FOF 33 and COL 13 states: 
33. Given the charges and the factual information presented,
the rebuttable presumption of detention without bail isapplicable, pursuant to H.R.S.§ 804-3. Defendant may be
denied bail based upon the charges and the facts as presented
to the Court, there is a serious risk that Defendant will fleeand a serious risk that Defendant poses a danger to any personor the community. The Court elects not to deny defendant bailin this instance. 
. . . . 
13.
 Under the circumstances bail may be denied pursuant to
H.R.S. § 804-3, however, there is not a requirement to do so. 
(Emphases in original.)

  __FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER__ 
C. The Circuit Court abused its discretion by setting cash
bail in the amount of $3.3 million in violation of HRS §
804-9, without analyzing the financial circumstances of
the defendant. 
"Excessive bail shall not be required." U.S. Const. 
amend. VIII; Haw. Const. art. I, § 12. HRS § 804-9 guides and 
circumscribes the scope of a trial court's discretion when setting a cash bail amount. The Circuit Court was required to set such cash bail in a "reasonable amount" that would not "render the 
privilege useless to the poor." HRS § 804-9. The record reflects 
that on September 19, 2022, prior to the bail hearings at issue, the Circuit Court had found Carter was indigent and appointed court-appointed counsel for Carter due to a conflict of interest with the State Office of the Public Defender. The Circuit Court noted in FOF 20 that Carter admitted into evidence a banking statement, and that Carter had an income of "$861 per month from 
Social Security benefits." The bail hearing evidence also 
contained a complaint filed against Carter, which sought to recover unpaid rent from Carter in the amount of "543.35." While FOF 20 reflects that the Circuit Court considered Carter's financial circumstances as HRS § 804-9 requires, the Circuit Court made no findings analyzing Carter's "financial ability to afford 
bail" under HRS § 804-9, and explaining how the $3.3 million 
amount was "reasonable" "based upon all available information," which included Carter's bank account and fixed social security income. HRS § 804-9. The evidence did not indicate Carter had the means to post cash bail in the amount of $3.3 million. 
Here, it appears that the Circuit Court utilized its 
risk-based findings for bail denial under HRS § 804-3 to conclude 
that the $3.3 million bail amount was "reasonable" under HRS 
§ 804-9, which was erroneous. The risk-based analysis for bail denial under HRS § 804-3 is distinct and different from the financial circumstances analysis required under HRS § 804-9. 
18  
   __FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER__ 
"A statutory interpretation that is rational, sensible, and 
practicable is preferred to one which is unreasonable, impracticable, inconsistent, contradictory, and illogical." 
Matter of Lindner, 152 Hawai ‘i 130, 142, 522 P.3d 1117, 1129 (App. 
2022) (cleaned up). If a defendant charged with serious crimes 
poses such a serious risk under the risk analysis in HRS § 804-3(b), then it is logical to allow a deviation from the presumption 
of bail, and to deny bail in that instance. If a defendant's non-
appearance or public safety risks cannot be mitigated by any combination of bail conditions under the risk analysis under HRS § 804-3(d), then it is logical for the statute to allow a deviation from the presumption of bail and to deny bail in that instance. See id. While HRS § 804-9 includes consideration of 
the offense type and possible punishment, it does not entail a risk analysis similar to HRS § 804-3, and focuses on an assessment of financial circumstances, which directs trial courts to avoid discriminatory setting in bail amounts that favor wealthy defendants and disadvantage poor ones. 
We conclude that the Circuit Court abused its discretion 
when it elected to set cash bail of $3.3 million and concluded 
that such amount was reasonable, in violation of HRS § 804-9. See
Henley, 136 Hawai ‘i at 478, 363 P.3d at 326. 
IV.
 CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate in part the 
September 1, 2023 "Order Denying Defendant's Motion for Supervised 
Release or, in the Alternative, to Reduce Bail" filed by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit as to the bail amount, and affirm the remainder of the order, which contains findings that support a denial of bail under HRS § 804-3 (b) or (d). We remand 
for the Circuit Court to issue an order pertaining to bail and to
