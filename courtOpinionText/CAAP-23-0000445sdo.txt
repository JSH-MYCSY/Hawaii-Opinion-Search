(CASE NO. 1CCV-23-0001515) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Nakasone, Chief Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
In this consolidated appeal, self-represented 
Respondent-Appellant/Plaintiff-Appellant Isaac James Kama (Kama) 
challenges the June 19, 2023 family court protective order 
issued against him, and the circuit court's 2024 order dismissing his November 22, 2023 civil complaint alleging various claims against the family court judge, clerk, and court reporter in connection with the family court protective order. We affirm. 
In the family court appeal, CAAP-23-0000445, Kama 
appeals from the June 19, 2023 "Order for Protection," (Order for Protection) filed by the Family Court of the First Circuit (Family Court).

  In the circuit court appeal, CAAP-24-0000434, Kama appeals from the May 20, 2024 "Order Granting (1) Defendant [-Appellee] Azure [M.] Skellington's [(Skellington)] Motion to 
Dismiss, and (2) Defendants[-Appellees] the Honorable Leslie N. 
Maloian, Kimberley Libokmeto, Sandra M.N. You and the Honorable R. Mark Browning's Motion to Dismiss With Prejudice" (Order to

 Dismiss), filed by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit 
(Circuit Court).2 
Kama's Opening Briefs in both CAAP-23-0000445 and 
CAAP-24-0000434 substantially fail to comply with HRAP Rules 
28(b)(4) and (b)(7). The points of error (POE) do not contain 
"where in the record the alleged error was objected to or the manner in which the alleged error was brought to the attention of the court." HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(iii). The argument sections, while containing some citations to the record, are untethered to the POEs and are generally devoid of applicable legal 
authorities. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). We address Kama's 
contentions to the extent they can be discerned. See Erum v.
Llego, 147 Hawaiʻ i 368, 380-81, 465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020) 
(affording liberal review to pleadings by self-represented 
parties to promote access to justice). 
CAAP-23-0000445, family court appeal 
  Kama's discernible contentions appear to be that: (1) the Family Court lacked subject matter and personal jurisdiction; (2) there was insufficient evidence to support the issuance of the Order for Protection; and (3) the firearms prohibition in the Order for Protection violates his Second Amendment rights.  
(1) Kama does not present discernible, applicable 
legal authority to support his argument that "the family court did not have in personam jurisdiction over [Kama] because [Kama] was the holder-in-due-course of ISAAC JAME KAMA© [sic]; and 
2 The Honorable Karin L. Holma presided. We construe Kama's appeal 
to include the June 20, 2024 "Final Judgment," (Final Judgment) entered by 
the Circuit Court following the May 20, 2024 Order to Dismiss. Hawaiʻi Rules 
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(b)(4).

  therefore, no subject matter jurisdiction exists over the matter 
either[,]" and "err[ed] by not respecting and following [Kama]'s jurisdictional issues and his 48 CFR Ch. 1, §53.228 remedy . . . that removes jurisdiction from him in the case." 
The Family Court had subject matter jurisdiction over 
this domestic abuse protective order proceeding under HRS § 571-14 (2018 & 2024 Supp.), pertaining to family court jurisdiction, which provides: "the [family] court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction . . . [i]n all proceedings under [HRS] chapter 586, Domestic Abuse Protective Orders[.]" 
(2) Kama argues "there was insufficient evidence to 
support the family court's decision because [Kama] was erroneously deemed 'not credible'" and Skellington was found to be "credible and reliable." Kama also claims that the Family Court "cut [Kama] off and did not give him a full opportunity to be heard or to hear his evidence of perjury to rebut [Skellington]'s lies in court[.]" 
Appellate courts "will not pass upon [a] trial judge's 
decisions with respect to the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence, because this is the province of the 
trial judge." State v. Eastman
, 81 Hawaiʻi 131, 139, 913 P.2d 
57, 65 (1996) (citations omitted). Kama does not identify where 
in the hearing transcript the Family Court denied his 
opportunity to be heard, and the transcript does not bear out Kama's assertion. The Family Court asked Kama twice to respond to Skellington's allegations of abuse, but in both instances, Kama gave non-responsive information about Skellington; digressed to describe other incidents involving Skellington, sometimes incoherently; and quoted "Scripture." The Family 
Court told Kama, "you're unable to answer the Court's 
4  
       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
  
 questions[,]" and noted that it had "grave concerns" that Kama 
had "refused to admit who you were to this Court" at the outset of the hearing. In concluding that Kama was not credible, the Family Court explained that it "g[a]ve the parties a full and 
fair opportunity to be heard, and attempted to give [Kama] a 
full and fair opportunity to be heard; however, [Kama] . . . g[ave] the Court testimony and statements that [were] not relevant to the proceedings, and . . . quot[ed] Bible Scripture instead." We conclude Kama's evidentiary challenges lack merit. 
(3) From what we are able to discern, it appears that 
Kama claims that the Order for Protection violates his Second Amendment rights because the Family Court "has not ruled that [Kama] is 'dangerous.'" Kama cites the papers of Thomas Jefferson, quotes Justice Amy Coney Barrett's dissenting opinion in Kanter v. Barr, 919 F.3d 437 (7th Cir. 2019) (which held that a felon firearms dispossession statute did not violate the Second Amendment, as applied to the felon), and quotes an amicus 
brief submitted in U.S. v. Rahimi, 602 U.S. 680 (2024).

Kama does not identify where in the record these 
arguments were raised. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(iii). The record 
reflects that Kama did not raise these legal authorities and 
argument for his Second Amendment claim to the Family Court, and they are waived. See County of Hawaii v. C & J Coupe Fam. Ltd.
P'ship
, 119 Hawaiʻi 352, 373, 198 P.3d 615, 636 (2008) ("As a 
general rule, if a party does not raise an argument at trial, that argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal; this

subject to a domestic violence restraining order from possessing a firearm is 
consistent with the Second Amendment, if the order includes a finding that 
the individual represented a credible threat to the physical safety of an intimate partner. 602 U.S. at 690.

 rule applies in both criminal and civil cases." (citations omitted)). 
CAAP-24-0000434, circuit court appeal Kama appears to contend that the Circuit Court should 
not have dismissed his Complaint
4 as an impermissible collateral 
attack. Kama argues that no law "prohibits [Kama] from pursuing his civil case which is a collateral attack and a civil tort claim"; that Kama "has a right to election [sic] this collateral attack, by and through his corporate fiction ISSAC [sic] JAMES KAMA© in addition to appealing the family court judgment"; and 
that because the Family Court judgment is "void" Kama "is 
entitled to attack it collaterally if he chooses that avenue." Kama does not present a coherent legal argument citing pertinent legal authorities to support these assertions. Kama also raises arguments regarding sovereign immunity that are not discernible enough to be addressed. Kama's arguments are deemed waived. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7); Ito v. Inv. Equity Life Holding Co., 
135 Hawaiʻ i 49, 74, 346 P.3d 118, 143 (2015) ("Where an appellant 
makes general assertions of a due process violation, without 
further elaboration or citation to authority, the court cannot reach a reasoned conclusion, and the due process argument is 
deemed waived." (citing C & J Coupe Fam. Ltd. P'ship, 119 Hawaiʻ i 
at 373, 198 P.3d at 636)); Haw. Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawaiʻ i 438, 480, 164 P.3d 696, 738 (2007) (finding that the 
appellants failed to demonstrate error because they "do not

Family Court issued the June 19, 2023 Order for Protection, named, among 
others, the family court judge, clerk, and court reporter as defendants, and alleged that the Order for Protection represented a conspiracy against rights 
under 18 U.S.C. § 241, a deprivation of rights under color of law under 18 
U.S.C. § 242, and a conspiracy to interfere with civil rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1985; Kama sought $16.75 million in damages.

would guide th[e] court in determining the validity of their contention"). 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the June 19, 2023 
Order for Protection, filed by the Family Court of the First Circuit, and the May 20, 2024 Order to Dismiss, filed by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
