dismiss due to a defective complaint because the State did not 
separately execute the declaration. 
Upon  careful  review  of   the  record  and  the  briefs 
submitted  by  the  parties,  and  having  given  due  consideration  to 
the  arguments  advanced  and  the  issues  raised,  we  resolve 
Millard's  point  of  error  as  follows: 
On  November  28,  2022,  the  State  charged  Millard  via 
Complaint  in  1DCW-22-0003477  as  follows: 
The undersigned Deputy Prosecuting Attorney [(DPA)] of 
the City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawai i charges:  
On  or
  about  November  27,  2022,  in  the  City  and  County 
of  Honolulu,  State  of  Hawai i,  ROBERT  ERRTTE   MILLARD  did 
intentionally,  knowingly,  or  recklessly  cause  bodily  injury 
to  wit,  physical  pain,  to  [Complaining  Witness  (CW)], 
thereby  committing  the  offense  of  Assault  in  the  Third 
Degree,  in  violation  of  Section  707-712(1)(a)  of  the  Hawai i 
Revised  Statutes. 
"Bodily in
jury" includes physical pain, illness, or 
any impairment of physical condition. 
I,  [DPA],  declare   under  penalty  of  law  that  the 
foregoing  is  true  and  correct  to  the  best  of  my  knowledge 
and  belief. 
The  1DCW-22-0003477  Complaint  was  dated  and 
electronically  signed  by  the  DPA. 
On  March  14,  2022,  the  State  charged  Millard  via 
Complaint  in  1DCW-22-0000564  as  follows: 
The undersigned Deputy Prosecuting Attorney of the

Harassment, in violation of Section 711-1106(1)(a) and/or 
711-1106(1)(b) of the Hawai i  Revised Sta tutes. 
I, [DP
A], declare under penalty of law that the 
foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge 
and belief. 
The 1DCW-22-0000564 Complaint was dated and 
electronically signed by the DPA. 
The District Court concluded that only one signature 
was required for the Complaint (in both cases) because the 
Complaint and the "I declare" language were a single document. 
Millard
 argues that the State filed a defective 
Complaint in both cases because the Complaints did not meet the 
requirements of Hawai i Rules  of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 
Rule 2.2(g). Millard contends that this "I declare" language must 
have a second separate signature. Millard's argument lacks 
merit. 
HRPP Rule 2.2(g) provides as follows: 
Rule 2.2. FORM OF PLEADINGS AND MOTIONS. 
(g) Signing of pleadings and other documents. Every 
pleading and other document shall be signed by the party or 
the party’s counsel. Where 2 or more documents are filed 
together, the party or party’s counsel need only provide one 
signature at the close of the documents filed together, with 
the exception that where affidavits or declarations of 
counsel are filed together with pleadings or other 
documents, the affidavits or declarations must be separately 
executed. Documents filed through JEFS shall be signed as 
provided by Rule 5 of the Hawai i Electronic Filing and 
Service Rules. 
(Emphasis added). 
Accordingly,  a  declaration  must  be  separately  executed 
when  it  is  one  of  two  documents  filed  together  with  a  pleading.  
See  id.   
Here,  the  "I  declare"  language  is  not  a  separate 
document  unto  itself.   Rather,  as  the  District  Court  determined, 
3
          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the  "I  declare"  language  was  "simply  the  affirmation  portion  of 
the  complaint."   Accordingly,  the  HRPP  Rule  2.2(g)  requirement 
that  a  declaration  document  be  separately  executed  does  not  apply 
to  the  "I  declare"  language  in  the  Complaint.4 
For  these  reasons,  the  District  Court's  July  7,  2023 
1DCW-22-0003477  Judgment  and  August  11,  2023  1DCW-22-0000564 
Judgment  are  affirmed. 
DATED:   Honolulu,  Hawai i,  June  18,  2025. 
On  the  briefs:
 /s/  Katherine   G.  Leonard 
Acting  Chief  Judge 
Eric  Lee  Niemeyer, 
for  Defendant-Appellant. /s/  Keith  K.  Hiraoka 
Associate  Judge 
Stephen  K.  Tsushima, 
Deputy  Prosecuting  Attorney, /s/  Clyde  J.  Wadsworth 
City  &  County  of  Honolulu, Associate  Judge  
for  Plaintiff-Appellee. 
4 We  note  that  the  Hawai i  Supreme  Court  has  upheld  the  sufficiency 
of  complaints  containing  the  "I  declare"  language  without  a  second  signature, 
albeit  on  other  grounds.   E.g.,  State  v.  Mortensen-Young,  152  Hawai i  385, 
387-88,  399,  526  P.3d  362,  364-65,  376  (2023)  (holding  complaints  were 
sufficient  because  they  complied  with  HRPP  Rule  7(d)).
