from the "Findings of Fact , Conclusions of Law , and Order

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2023, and from the "Order Dismissing Case Without Prejudice " 
(Dismissal Order ), entered by the circuit court on July 7, 2023. 
Defendant -Appellee Shaye Kahealani Pacheco Saffery 
(Pacheco Saffery ) was indicted in February 2023 on the following 
counts: (1) Attempted Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the First 
Degree, in violation of Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes ( HRS) §§ 705-500 
(2014) and 712 -1241(1)(b)(ii)(A) (Supp. 2016); (2) Promoting a 
Dangerous Drug in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS § 712 -
1242(1)(b)(i) (Supp. 2016); (3) Prohibited Acts Related to Drug 
Paraphernalia, in violation of HRS § 329 -43.5(a) (2022 ); and (4) 
Promoting a Detrimental Drug in the Third Degree, in violation 
of HRS § 712 -1249(1) (2014). 
In May 2023, Pacheco Saffery filed a Motion to 
Suppress Evidence ( Motion to Suppress ), alleging the illegal 
seizure of her vehicle and moving for the suppression of all 
evidence resulting from the illegal seizure. The evidence that 
Pacheco Saffery sought to suppress included: (1) "[a]ll physical 
evidence seized from [Pacheco Saffery's] p erson or vehicle as a 
result of the unlawful detention/search/seizure"; (2) "[a]ll 
observations made by law enforcement as a result of the unlawful 
detention/search/seizure , including but not limited to any 
observations of the appearance of [Pacheco Saffery] or that of 
her vehicle, the contents therein, and subsequent searches and 
chemical test results"; and (3) "[a]ll statements made by 
[Pacheco Saffery] after the unlawful detention/search/seizure."

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The State opposed the Motion, contending that Pacheco Saffery 
was lawfully arrested, and that the seizure of her vehicle prior 
to issuance of a warrant was lawful due to exigent 
circumstances. 
Following a hearing in June 2023, the circuit court 
granted the Motion to Suppress. The circuit court subsequently 
dismissed the case without prejudice in July 2023. 
The State appealed. Upon careful review of the record 
and the briefs submitted by the parties, and having given due 
consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, 
we resolve the State's point of error as follows . 
The State specifically contends on appeal that the 
circuit court erred by granting Pacheco Saffery's Motion to 
Suppress because "sufficient evidence of exigent circumstances 
existed in the record to support the warrantless seizure" of the 
vehicle. The State specifi cally challenges conclusions of law 
(COL) 5-7 of the Suppression Order. These COL provide, 
5. Here, there were no specific grounds articulated to 
justify a finding of exigent circumstances. The vehicle 
was locked. Officer Sugiyama had the key. The two 
passengers had left the area on foot. There were four 
officers available. A search warrant could be obtained in 
under two hours. 
6. In the absence of exigent circumstances, a warrant 
was required to seize the vehicle. Because the warrant was 
not obtained until later, all evidence obtained as a direct 
or indirect result of the initial seizure must be 
suppressed. Therefore, all evidence found within the 
vehicle must be suppressed. 
7. The defendant's incriminating statement when 
confronted with the evidence found in her vehicle must also 
be suppressed. "[T]he 'fruit of the poisonous tree' 
doctrine 'prohibits the use of evidence at trial which 
3   
 
   
  
  
 
  
   
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
comes to light as a result of the exploitation of a 
previous illegal act of the police.'" State v. Fukusaku, 
85 Hawaiʻi 462, 946 P.2d 32 (1997), quoting State v. 
Medeiros, 4 Haw.App. 248, 251 n.4, 665 P.2d 181, 184 n.4 
(1983). "[A] waiver of one's constitutional rights or a 
confession, even if uncoerced and intelligently given, will 
be inadmissible if induced by a prior illegality." 
State v. Lopez , 78 Hawaiʻi 443, 453, 896 P.2d 889, 909 
(1995). Inculpatory statements made in response to 
interrogation re garding evidence which resulted from an 
illegal search or seizure is the fruit of the poisonous 
tree and must be suppressed. State v. Poaipuni , 98 Haw. 
387, 394, 49 P.3d 353, 360 [(2002)] . Therefore, all 
evidence obtained subsequent to the warrantless seizure 
must be suppressed. 
(Internal citations cleaned up) . 
A trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress is 
reviewable de novo , under the right/wrong standard. State v. 
James, 153 Hawaiʻi 503, 510, 541 P.3d 1266, 1273 (2024) (citing 
State v. Hewitt, 153 Hawaiʻ i 33, 40, 526 P.3d 558, 565 (2023)).  
To the extent that the circuit court's COL 5, 6, and 7 present 
mixed questions of law and fact, they are reviewed for clear 
error. State v. Rapozo, 123 Hawai ʻi 329, 336, 235 P.3d 325, 332 
(2010) ("[A] conclusion of law that presents mixed questions of 
fact and law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard 
because the court's conclusions are dependent upon the facts and 
circumstances of each individual case.") (citation omitted).  
It is undisputed that the police seized Pacheco 
Saffery's vehicle prior to the issuance of a search warrant. 
"It is well established that warrantless searches and seizures 
of items within a constitutionally protected area are 
'presumptively unreasonable unless there is both probable cause 
and a legally recognized exception to the warrant requirement.'"

State v. Phillips , 138 Hawaiʻi 321, 336, 382 P.3d 133, 148 (2016) 
(quoting State v. Bonnell , 75 Haw. 124, 137, 856 P.2d 1265, 1273 
(1993)). "An automobile search without a warrant . . . would 
not be constitutionally proscribed where the search is conducted 
as an incident to a proper arrest, or, assuming the existence of 
probable cause, where exigent circumstances are present." 
State v. Elliott , 61 Haw. 492, 494 -95, 605 P.2d 930, 932 (1980) 
(internal citations omitted) . At issue is whether exigent 
circumstances justified the warrantless seizure that led to the 
search. 
Elliott  instructs that the term "exigent 
circumstances,"  
is incapable of precise definition, and [] each case must 
be decided on its own facts. At the very least, however, 
there must be a showing that at the time of the warrantless 
search and seizure there was probable cause to search; and 
that the police had reason to believe that because of the 
car's mobility or exposure, there was a foreseeable risk that it might be moved or that the evidence which it 
contained might be removed or destroyed before a warrant 
could be obtained
.  
Id. at 496, 605 P.2d at 933 (internal citations omitted). 
Officer Sugiyama, the officer who authorized the 
seizure and search of Pacheco Saffery's vehicle, was the sole 
witness that testified at the hearing on the Motion to Suppress. 
Officer Sugiyama testified that, in addition to himself, there 
were three other officers assisting in Pacheco Saffery's arrest. 
Officer Sugiyama further testified that he did not mention, in 
his report, the two women who had approached the vehicle as it 
5   
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was being secured. When questioned about this omission, Officer 
Sugiyama stated, "I just felt –-it was really brief, and I just 
didn't put it in my report." Officer Sugiyama further testified 
that, to secure the vehicle, "[he] obtained [Pacheco Saffery's] 
vehicle keys, and the vehicle just remained as it was." At 
which time, "[he] stood by waiting for the tow." 
With regard to the length of time it took to obtain 
the search warrant, the record reflects,  
 Q [by defense counsel]. So on the night of –- of 
this incident, you had –- you had a K- 9 search at 2009, 
correct, which is 8:09 p.m.?  
A [by Officer Sugiyama]. Correct. 
 . . . . 
Q. And by 2159 [9:59 p.m.], you already had the 
warrant in hand, correct? 
A. Correct.  
On this record, we conclude that COL 5 and 6 were not 
clearly erroneous. We further conclude that the circuit court 
did not err, in its COL 7, in suppressing the "incriminating" 
statement that Pacheco Saffery made to Officer Sugiyama that 
arose out of the  unlawful seizure of the vehicle. State v. 
Fukusaku, 85 Hawaiʻi 462,  475,  946 P.2d 32, 45  (1997) ("As for 
the suppression of derivative evidence, the fruit of the 
poisonous tree doctrine prohibits the use of evidence at trial 
which comes to light as a result of the exploitation of a 
previous illegal act of the police.") (cleaned up). COL 5, 6, 
and 7 are thus supported by the circuit court's findings and the 
6   
 
  
 
  
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
record evidence. Given the above, the circuit court did not err 
in dismissing this case without prejudice. 
The circuit court's July 5, 2023 Suppression Order, 
and July 7, 2023 Dismissal Order are affirmed.
