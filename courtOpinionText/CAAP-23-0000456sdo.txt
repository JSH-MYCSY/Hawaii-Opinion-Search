RICHARD GARY HARDER, Plaintiff-Appellee, 
v. 
CHERYL MITSUYE SAKAMOTO, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2DV151000342) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Cheryl Mitsuye Sakamoto (Wife) 
appeals from the July 3, 2023 Judgment filed in the Family Court 
of the Second Circuit (family court).
1 This matter arises out of 
a dispute regarding the distribution of proceeds from the sale 
of a Molokaʻ i property (Property) owned by Plaintiff-Appellee 
Richard Gary Harder (Husband
) and Wife. 
1 The Honorable James R. Rouse presided.   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  
 
 Husband filed a Complaint for Divorce in September 
2015. The family court entered a Divorce Decree in January 
2016, which required the parties to sell the Property, and 
provided that Husband, Wife, and the Richard Gary Harder 
Revocable Trust would each receive one-third of the sale 
proceeds. Husband and Wife were to share equally in the costs 
of maintaining the Property in a saleable condition. 
Husband filed a motion to enforce the Divorce Decree 
in November 2022, which resulted in the sale of the Property. Wife subsequently filed a motion to modify the Divorce Decree 
(Motion to Modify), which requested modification of the Divorce 
Decree so that Wife would instead receive half of the net sale 
proceeds. The family court held an evidentiary hearing and 
denied Wife's Motion to Modify. 
On appeal, Wife raises four points of error, 
contending that the family court erred by: (1) "issu[ing] 
findings of fact [(FOFs)] that were clearly erroneous and/or conclusions of law [(COLs)] that were wrong"; (2) "overrul[ing] 
objections to [Husband's] questioning about [Wife's] alleged 
bankruptcy," which occurred prior to Wife's marriage with 
Husband; (3) "den[ying Wife's] Motion to Modify"; and (4) 
denying Wife's request for reimbursement for maintaining the 
Property. 
2   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  
   
 
 Upon careful review of the record, briefs, and 
relevant legal authorities, and having given due consideration 
to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, 
we resolve Wife's points of error as follows : 2
(1) Wife contends the family court erred when it 
denied Wife's Motion to Modify. "Generally, the family court 
possesses wide discretion in making its decisions and those 
decision[s] will not be set aside unless there is a manifest 
abuse of discretion." Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawaiʻ i 41, 46, 137 
P.3d 355, 360 (2006) (citation omitted). The court "will not 
disturb the family court's decisions on appeal unless the family 
court disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant and its decision 
clearly exceeded the bounds of reason." Id.
 (citation omitted). 
Wife contends that her Motion to Modify, construed as 
a Hawaiʻ i Family Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 60(b) motion, entitles 
her to relief under subsections (1) for mistakes, (5) because "it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have 
prospective application," and/or (6) for "any other reason 
2 We consolidate and renumber Wife's points of error and arguments 
herein, to the extent it makes sense to do so, for purposes of our analysis. 
3   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
 justifying relief from the operation of the judgment."3 Wife's 
contentions lack merit. 
HFCR Rule 60(b)(1) motions must be filed "not more 
than one year after the judgment, order, or proceedings was 
entered or taken." The Divorce Decree was entered in January 
2016, and Wife's Motion to Modify was filed in April 2023. 
Wife's Motion to Modify was therefore untimely pursuant to HFCR 
Rule 60(b). 
HFCR Rule 60(b)(5) authorizes the termination of the 
continued enforcement of a judgment when "it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective 
application." See Greene v. Greene, 8 Haw. App. 559, 566, 815 
P.2d 28, 31 (App. 1991) (holding that HFCR Rule 60(b)(5) does not apply where the motion requested an order for a specific 
award and not just the termination of the continued enforcement 
of the award). Here, Wife did not request to discontinue the 
enforcement of the relevant provisions in the Divorce Decree, but instead requested that she receive a bigger share of the 
3 We note that Wife did not cite or rely on any of these HF CR Rule 
60(b) bases for relief from judgment in her Motion to Modify. Because Wife 
was self- represented when she filed this motion, we will construe her Motion 
to Modify as an HFCR Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment. See Makila 
Land Co. v. Kapu
, 152 Hawaiʻi 112, 121, 522 P.3d 259, 268 (2022) ("Pro se 
filings, even when misbranded, should be reasonably construed in a manner 
that results in identifying a route to relief, not in rendering relief 
impossible.") (cleaned up).

 sale proceeds that was initially awarded to her. Therefore, 
HFCR Rule 60(b)(5) does not apply here. 
HFCR Rule 60(b)(6) gives the family court discretion 
to relieve a party from a final judgment for "any other reason 
justifying relief from the operation of the judgment," if the 
motion was made within a reasonable time. "[W]hat constitutes a 
'reasonable time' is determined in the light of all attendant 
circumstances, intervening rights, loss of evidence, prejudice to the adverse party, the commanding equities of the case, and 
the general policy that judgments be final." Id. at 568-69, 815 
P.2d at 32 (citations omitted). Wife contends the Divorce Decree was "unconscionable from its inception" such that "it 
warranted modification from the start." Wife's contention lacks 
merit. The record reflects that Wife's counsel during the 
divorce proceedings drafted the Divorce Decree, and Husband did 
not make any changes to the provisions set forth therein.
4 
We therefore determine, on this record, that the 
family court did not abuse its discretion in denying Wife's Motion to Modify. 
4 Wife further contends that neither party anticipated that the 
Property would remain unsold for several years, and therefore, the inequity 
of the distributions did not become apparent until significant time passed. 
It appears, however, that the parties contemplated the possibility that the 
Property would not sell immediately. The Divorce Decree provides that, if the Property remained unsold after March 1, 2016, the parties were to rent 
out the property and apply the rental proceeds to the monthly mortgage and 
utility costs before either party was required to pay their share.

 (2) Wife contends the family court erred when it 
denied Wife's request for reimbursement for her work in 
maintaining the Property in a saleable condition.  We review 
the family court's decision for abuse of discretion. Fisher, 
111 5
Hawaiʻi at 46, 137 P.3d at 360. 
The Divorce Decree provided that, if the Property had 
not yet been sold by March 1, 2016, "the parties shall be 
equally responsible for the necessary, agreed upon costs to 
maintain the [P]roperty in saleable condition." (Emphasis 
added.) The parties agree that Wife did maintenance and 
landscaping work on the Property during the years prior to its 
sale. Wife contends that she is entitled to reimbursement for her labor "under either the theory of implied contract or the 
theory of unjust enrichment."

5 We decline to address Wife's contention that the family court 
erred in debiting the Hawaiʻ i Real Property Tax Act income tax withholding 
"solely from [Wife's] share of the proceeds rather than the withholding being 
split among the parties." See Hawaii Revised Statutes § 235-68 (2017) 
(governing the "[w] ithholding of tax on the disposition of real property by 
nonresident persons"). Wife did not raise this argument during the family 
court proceedings. See Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea 
Resort Co., 100 Hawaiʻ i 97, 107, 58 P.3d 608, 618 (2002). 
6 Wife also contends that the family court erred in denying her 
reimbursement for her travel costs. Husband testified that travel costs were 
not an agreed- upon cost, and that, although he was aware that Wife was 
traveling to the Property, he did not tell Wife he would pay for her travel 
expenses. Wife testified that Husband was aware she was traveling to the 
Property and did not object to her travel, but also that there was no 
agreement that Husband would compensate her for her plane fares. The family 
court found Husband's testimony credible, and Wife's testimony not credible. We will not address issues dependent on the family court's credibility 
determinations and weighing of evidence. See LC v. MG & Child Support Enf't 
Agency
, 143 Hawaiʻi 302, 310- 11, 430 P.3d 400, 408- 09 (2018).  
6   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
   A claim for implied contract requires the claimant to 
"present evidence that the [opposing party] requested [the 
claimant] to render the services or assented to receiving the[] 
benefit under circumstances negativing any presumption that they 
would be gratuitous." Durette v. Aloha Plastic Recycling, Inc., 
105 Hawaiʻ i 490, 504, 100 P.3d 60, 74 (2004) (cleaned up). An 
implied contract exists where "an agreement in fact, creating an 
obligation, is implied or presumed from their acts," though 
there must still be a "mutual intent to form a contract." Kemp
v. Child Support Enf't Agency, 111 Hawaiʻi 367, 391, 141 P.3d 
1014, 1038 (2006) (cleaned up). 
The record reflects that there was no implied contract 
to pay Wife for her landscaping work. 
Husband testified that: 
he did not agree to pay Wife for landscaping work; Wife would 
tell him "that she was doing a lot of work outside"; Wife would 
send him pictures; he told Wife to stop her work; he told Wife 
multiple times that "she was working [too] much" and that "it 
didn't need to be done"; and that he would not have hired 
someone to do the landscaping work, even if Wife did not do it. 
Wife testified, moreover, that Husband did not agree to 
compensate her for various landscaping work, such as pruning, 
weeding, and trimming. 
The record also reflects that Husband was not unjustly 
enriched by Wife's landscaping work. A claim for unjust 
7   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 enrichment requires the claimant to "prove that he or she 
conferred a benefit upon the opposing party and that the 
retention of that benefit would be unjust." Durette, 105 Hawaiʻ i 
at 504, 100 P.3d at 74 (cleaned up). 
Husband testified that he elected to compensate Wife 
around $1,000/month for her general maintenance work in 
consideration of the Divorce Decree's instruction that the 
Property expenses were to be shared by Husband and Wife equally. 
Husband did not receive the entire benefit of Wife's work, given 
that the Divorce Decree specified that Wife was responsible for 
one-half of the Property expenses. Cf. Small v. Badenhop, 67 
Haw. 626, 635-37, 701 P.2d 647, 654-55 (1985). 
We therefore conclude that the family court did not 
abuse its discretion in denying Wife's claim for reimbursement. 
(3) Wife contends that the family court erred when "it 
[overruled Wife's] objection to any questioning about [her] 
alleged bankruptcy occurring prior to the parties' marriage" as 
being impermissible character evidence pursuant to Hawaii Rules 
of Evidence Rule 404. The record reflects that, during the evidentiary hearing, Wife only objected to the questioning 
because it was argumentative and not relevant. Wife did not 
object to the questioning on the basis that it was impermissible 
character evidence. An evidentiary objection not raised or 
properly preserved in the lower court will not be considered on 
8   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
   
 
 
 
  
  
    appeal, even where the evidence was objected to on other 
grounds. State v. Crisostomo, 94 Hawaiʻ i 282, 290, 12 P.3d 873, 
881 (2000). We therefore conclude that this point of error was 
waived and that plain error review is not required to preserve 
Wife's fundamental rights, nor required by the ends of justice. 
See State v. Metcalfe, 129 Hawaiʻ i 206, 225, 297 P.3d 1062, 1081 
(2013). 
(4) Wife contends that the "Overview" section of the 
family court's FOFs and COLs are "neither findings nor 
conclusions," FOFs 3, 4, 6, 10, 12, 13, 16, 20, 50, 53, 55-59, 
61, 62, and 64-71 are clearly erroneous, and COLs 1, 2, 3-8, 11, 
and 13-15 are wrong.   7
We review the family court's FOFs under the clearly 
erroneous standard; we review COLs de novo under the right/wrong 
standard. Fisher, 111 Hawaiʻ i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360. To the 
extent that Wife challenges the FOFs and COLs as insufficient or 
incomplete, we note that "[t]he trial judge is required to only 
make brief, definite, pertinent findings and conclusions upon 
the contested matters." Rezentes v. Rezentes, 88 Hawaiʻ i 200, 
203, 965 P.2d 133, 136 (App. 1998) (citation omitted). 
7 Wife challenges all FOFs and COLs "to the extent they are germane 
to this appeal." We will not address any FOFs or COLs for which there is no 
discernible argument. See Exotics Haw.- Kona, Inc. v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours 
& Co
, 116 Hawaiʻi 277, 288, 172 P.3d 1021, 1032 (2007).

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  
 
 On this record, and for the reasons set forth above, 
we conclude that the family court's FOFs were not clearly 
erroneous and its COLs were not wrong, and that the family court 
did not abuse its discretion in making its decision. 
We affirm the Judgment.
