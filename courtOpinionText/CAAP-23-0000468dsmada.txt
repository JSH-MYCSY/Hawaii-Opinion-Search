APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT 
(CASE  NO.  3CC15100164K) 
ORDER 
(By:   Wadsworth,  Presiding  Judge,  Nakasone  and  Guidry,  JJ.) 
Upon  consideration  of  Plaintiffs-Appellees  Kenneth  Y. 
Kai  and  Tae  K.  Kai,  Trustees  of  the  Kai  Family  1998  Trust's  (Kai 
Parties )  October  3,  2023  Motion  to  Dismiss  the  Appeal  (Motion), 
the  papers  in  support,  and  the  record,  it  appears  that  self-
represented  Defendant-Appellant  Michael  Miroyan  (Miroyan )  appeals 
on  behalf  of  himself  and  Defendant-Appellant  Hawaiian  Riverbend, 
LLC  (Hawaiian  Riverbend )  from  the  "Order  Granting  Plaintiff's 
Motion  for  Confirmation  of  Foreclosure  Sale,  for  Distribution  of 
Proceeds,  for  Allowance  of  Fees  and  Costs,  and  for  Writ  of 
Possession,  Filed  January  31,  2023"  (Confirmation  Order)  and  the  
        
       
        
           
           
    "Final  Judgment"  (Judgment ),  both  entered  July  5,  2023,  in  the 
Circuit  Court  of  the  Third  Circuit. 
Kai
 Parties seek dismissal of the appeal for lack of 
jurisdiction, arguing that (1) Miroyan lacks authority to 
represent Hawaiian Riverbend, and therefore could not file a 
notice of appeal on its behalf, and (2) Miroyan lacks standing to 
appeal on his own behalf because he is not aggrieved by the 
Confirmation Order or Judgment. 
Kai  Parties  rely,  in  part,  on  the  analysis  in  a 
March  10,  2020  order  entered  in  CAAP-19-0000742—a  prior  appeal 
from  the  same  underlying  case—in  which  this  court  determined  that 
a  notice  of  appeal  signed  and  filed  by  Miroyan  on  behalf  of 
himself  and  Hawaiian  Riverbend  "was  not  valid  as  to  Hawaiian 
Riverbend"  because  non-attorneys  may  not  represent  entities.  
However,  the  Hawai i  Supreme   Court  subsequently   decided   Alexander 
and  Baldwin  v.  Armitage,   which  rejected  the  view  that  the  absence 
of  an  attorney,  where  required,  is  jurisdictional,  and  held  that, 
"in  light  of  our  policy  in  favor  of  hearing  cases  on  the  merits 
wherever  possible  and  our  liberal  construction  of  pro  se 
filings,"  an  appeal  filed  by  a  non-attorney  on  behalf  of  an 
entity  should  not  be  dismissed  "without  giving  the  [entity]  a 
reasonable  opportunity  to  obtain  counsel."   151  Hawai i  37,  51, 
54,  508  P.3d  832,  46,  849  (2022)  (citing  Erum  v.  Llego,  147 
Hawai i  368,  380-81,   465  P.3d  815,  827-28  (2020)).    Accordingly, 
the  notice  of  appeal  is  valid  as  to  Hawaiian  Riverbend;  however, 
in  accordance  with  Alexander  and  Baldwin,  we  will  grant  the 
request  for  dismissal  of  Hawaiian  Riverbend  as  an  appellant 
unless  it  obtains  counsel  within  forty-five  (45)  days  of  this 
order. 
Kai  Parties  contend  Miroyan  is  not  aggrieved  by  the 
Confirmation  Order,  and  therefore,  he  lacks  standing  to  appeal.  
However,  the  Judgment  enters  final  judgment  against  "all 
Defendants,"  which  includes  Miroyan.   Given  further  that  standing 
is  not  an  issue  of  subject  matter  jurisdiction,  Tax  Found.  of 
Hawai i  v.  State,  144  Hawai i  175,  192,  439  P.3d  127,  144  (2019), 
and  with  deference   to  the  court's  policy  of  affording   litigants 
2
  
       
        
      the  opportunity  to  be  heard  on  the  merits  whenever  possible, 
Erum,  147  Hawai i  at  380,  465  P.3d  at  827,  we  decline  to  dismiss 
Miroyan  as  a  party  to  the  appeal  at  this  time.  
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
granted in part and denied in part as follows: 
(1)  The  request  for  dismissal  of  the  appeal  as  to 
Miroyan  is  denied  without  prejudice  to  the  parties  raising  the 
issue  of  Miroyan's  standing  in  the  briefs;  and 
(2)  The  request  for  dismissal  of  the  appeal  as  to 
Hawaiian  Riverbend  is  granted,  unless  within  45  days  of  this 
order,  Hawaiian  Riverbend  obtains  counsel  to  represent  it  on 
appeal,  and  counsel  files  in  this  appeal  a  valid  notice  of 
appearance. 
IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  the  deadline  to  file  an 
opening  brief  is  extended  to  December  18,  2023. 
DATED:
 Honolulu, Hawai i, November  1, 2023.
