the Third Circuit ( circuit court ) in 3PC111000388 ( 2011 case ) 
and 3PC141000474 ( 2014 case ) on July 20, 2023.1 
On appeal, Oili raises a single point of error, 
contending that the circuit court erred in imposing consecutive 
sentences, with respect to the 2011 case and the 2014 case, 
amounting to a fifteen -year term of imprisonment. Upon careful 
review of the record and relevant legal authorities, we resolve 
Oili's point of error as follows. 
Oili was charged in the 2011 case with: (1) 
Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree, in violation of  
Hawaii Revised Statutes  (HRS)  §§ 707-715(1) and 707-716(1)(e); 
(2) Burglary in the First Degree, in violation of HRS § 708-
810(1)(c); (3) Place to Keep Unloaded Firearms Other Than 
Pistols and Revolvers, in violation of HRS § 134-24(a); and (4) 
Assault in the Third Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-
712(1)(a). Oili pled guilty to all four charges, and was 
sentenced to probation in January 2012.  
While on probation, Oili was charged in the 2014 case 
with: (1) and (2) Assault Against a Law Enforcement Officer in 
the First Degree, in violation of HRS § 707 -712.5(1)(a) ; (3) 
Accidents Involving Damage to Vehicle or Property, in violation 
of HRS § 291C -13; (4) Driving Without a License, in violation of

HRS § 286 -102(b); (5) Resisting Arrest, in violation of 
HRS § 710-1026(1); and (6) Conditions of Operation and 
Registration of Motor Vehicles, commonly referred to as no No-
Fault Insurance, in violation of HRS § 431:10C -104(a), creating 
the 2014 case. On June 1, 2015, Oili entered no contest pleas, 
and the court found Oili guilty of counts 1, 2, 3, and 5. Oili 
was sentenced to four years of probation in counts 1 and 2, ten 
days jail in count 3, and one -year jail in count 5, with credit 
for time served. 
Following Oili's arrest in the 2014 case, the State 
moved in the 2011 case for revocation of Oili's probation, and 
for resentencing. In June 2015, after Oili's conviction in the 
2014 case, the circuit court resentenced Oili to a new five -year 
term of probation for his 2011 conviction. 
In July 2017, the State moved for revocation of Oili's 
probation and resentencing, in both the 2011 and 2014 cases, 
after Oili violated the terms and conditions of his probation. 
The circuit court resentenced Oili to a new five -year term of 
probation in the 2011 case, and a new four -year term of 
probation in the 2014 case. 
In June 2019, the State once more moved for revocation 
of Oili's probation and resentencing, in both the 2011 and 2014 
cases, after Oili again violated the terms and conditions of his

probation. The circuit court revoked Oili's probation, and 
resentenced him to a ten -year term of imprisonment in the 2011 
case, and a five -year term of imprisonment in the 2014 case, 
with the prison terms to run consecutively. The circuit court 
entered an Amended Order of Resentencing, and Oili appealed to 
this court. On December 22, 2021, this court, in CAAP -20-
0000712, vacated Oili's sentence, and remanded for resentencing, 
on the grounds that the circuit court failed to state its 
reasoning as to why O ili was sentenced to consecutive terms of 
imprisonment. 
On remand, at Oili's resentencing hearing, the circuit 
court first addressed the sentencing factors set forth in 
HRS § 706-606 (2014), to determine that Oili should be sentenced 
to a term of imprisonment rather than probation. The circuit 
court explained its rationale to Oili, as follows, 
[A]s mentioned you've been on probation since 2012 
and that never work [sic]. And I do see a change in you, 
but the –-the thing that's not good for you is that the 
prison life has been good for you in that it's –-it's 
assumably been keeping you sober, clean and sober from 
drugs and in a controlled lifestyle that's better for you. 
We –-we tried with you at probation. We tried 
substance abuse treatment on probation, but it doesn't work 
when you're free, and that's the problem. So the only 
question I have here, um, well, I'll go through the other 
factors, too, first just to make sure we make a clean 
record. 
The -– the factors of the sentence being imposed to 
reflect the seriousness of the offenses, promote respect 
for the law and provide punishment for the law. 
The first [case] was Terroristic Threatening. That's 
back in -– from 2011 and a firearms charge, and the second 
4   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
case was the assault against a law enforcement officer in 
2014. 
After you were convicted as a felon you know that 
you're not supposed to have any kind of firearms, and 
nonetheless in 2017 you were convicted of ownership 
possession of a firearm and luckily somehow got pled down 
to a Class C [felony] . And in the 20 case it was a 
shooting at the Hilo Terrace Apartments, and that case you 
got pled all the way down to a misdemeanor. 
So all these kinds of things, it's the seriousness of 
the crimes and to provide punishment , it is not unfair to 
ask that you gotta spend time in prison for this. 
Now, the other -– another factor is whether or not 
the sentence affords adequate deterrence to criminal 
conduct. 
You were on probation since 2012. The probation 
sentence did not deter you from criminal conduct and worse 
yet the recurring cases were with drugs , and according to 
this factor of 2(b), you know, a prison sentence is 
required. 
Now, under 2(c) the Court needs to consider the 
protection of the public from further crimes, and that's 
the –-that's the main thing of every probation sentence is 
that you shall not commit another federal or state crime. 
So from your first case you got -– you committed and 
got convicted of three more crimes. And the protection of 
the public especially is that there's innocent people that 
could have gotten shot at the -– at the Hilo Terrace 
Apartments, and the police officers and, um, who effectuate 
a lawful arrest get injured trying to take you into 
custody. That leans towards having to be incarcerated. 
Now, the need for the sentence to provide educational 
training or –-or other treatment. It's clear that you 
need a drug treatment, and you were given the opportunities 
out in the public to do it while on probation many, many 
times over eight years and that didn't turn out okay. And 
I do believe prison will get you drug treatment at some 
point in time in -– in your programming once you are 
sentenced. 
And the problem for you, Mr. Oili, is that treatment 
and freedom don't work together. You can't accomplish it. 
Even with all the assistance of the probation department 
and all the help in the treatment facilities it didn't work 
while you're free. 
Now, the kind of sentences that are available that I 
do consider basically it's probation or it's prison. We 
tried probation many, many times from Judge Nakamura's time 
5   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
since 2012 and that hasn't worked and it will not work, and 
the last –-the last straw was the 2020 case with the, um, 
the firearm. 
The circuit court then addressed whether a concurrent 
or consecutive sentence was warranted. The circuit court 
explained,  
I'll say these things in considering whether or not 
I'm gonna give Mr. Oili a concurrent sentence or 
consecutive sentence.  
Your dangerousness in the public is of great concern. 
It was always a concern with the probation office and with 
this Court. And while on probation and trying to deal with 
your drug problem you kept going back to guns, and that's – 
- that's of greatest concern to me is that there's 
assaultive behavior with the police, possession of firearms and continued drug use.  
And you made all your pleas for chances again and 
again, and you asked your probation officer not to give up on you and –- and they didn't and they worked to try and 
get you into treatment programs. And what happened was 
after your probation was revoked again you recommit a 
violent and dangerous offense by shooting at Mr., um, at 
that, um, at the Hilo Terrace Apartment.  
The LSI assessment conducted on May 15, 2020 results 
in the highest scores for criminogenic factors, being 
criminal history, education, employment and financial. You 
scored a 36 which recommends a high level of supervision.  
It's clear you're not probationable. You're 
convicted -–  you're a convicted felon with continued drug 
use and guns, and it's for the protection of the public that I have to send you to prison.  
And, you know, if I gave you a concurrent sentence 
what that does is it allows you to add on crime after crime 
after crime and you pay for it all one time and that's not 
fair to the public or the criminal justice system, and for 
the protection of the public I will have to impose a 
consecutive sentence . But as you folks had agreed before 
the [2014 case] and 17 -535 [case][]  can be concurrent with 
each other.  2
2 Oili has not appealed his five -year prison sentence in 3CPC -17-
0000535, that the circuit court ruled would run concurrently with the five -
year sentence imposed in the 2014 case. 
6   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
So in 3CP - 17-535 [sic] I sentence you to a term of 5 
years[]  imprisonment; [the 2014 case], 5 years in prison 
concurrent with each other.  
Now, as to [the 2011 case] I'm sentencing you to a 
term of 5 years as to Counts 1 and 3 and 10 years as to 
Count 2. All counts in [the 2011 case] shall be concurrent 
with each other but shall be consecutive as to the terms in 
17-535 and [the 2014 case].  
So 5 –- 17 and  [the 2014 case]shall be concurrent 
with each other consecutive to the [2011]case so that is 10 
years, plus 5 years, and this is based on the need to 
protect the public, and the other factors which I stated 
above is the repeated resort to drugs and firearms after 
being revoked on probation.  
(Emphasis added.) 
We review the circuit court's Orders of Resentencing, 
which sentenced Oili to consecutive ten- and five-year terms of 
imprisonment in the 2011 and 2014 cases, for abuse of 
discretion.  
A sentencing judge generally has broad discretion in 
imposing a sentence. The applicable standard of review for 
sentencing or resentencing matters is whether the court 
committed plain and manifest abuse of discretion in its 
decision. Factors which indica te a plain and manifest 
abuse of discretion are arbitrary or capricious action by 
the judge and a rigid refusal to consider the defendant's 
contentions. And, generally, to constitute an abuse it 
must appear that the court clearly exceeded the bounds of 
reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or 
practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant. 
State v. Kong, 131 Hawaiʻi 94, 101, 315 P.3d 720, 727 (2013) 
(cleaned up).  
Pursuant to HRS § 706-668.5(1) (Supp. 2015), a 
sentencing court has discretion to impose consecutive or 
concurrent sentences. In making this determination, the court 
7   
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
    
  
  
    
    
  
    
  
     
  
    
    
    
  
  
    
     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
must consider the factors set forth in HRS § 706-606.   However, 
"[t]he weight to be given the factors set forth in HRS § 706-606 
in imposing sentence is a matter generally left to the 
discretion of the sentencing court, taking into consideration 
the circumstances of each case." State v. Akana, 10 Haw.App. 
381, 386, 876 P.2d 1331, 1334 (1994). "Absent clear evidence to 
the contrary, it is presumed that a sentencing court will have 
considered all factors before imposing concurrent or consecutive 
terms of imprisonment under HRS § 706-606." Kong, 131 Hawai ʻi at 
102, 315 P.3d at 728 (cleaned up).  3 
Nevertheless, the "circuit courts  must state on the 
record at the time of sentencing the reasons for imposing a consecutive sentence." State v. Hussein, 122 
Hawaiʻi 495, 510, 
229 P.3d 313, 328 (2010). Hussein  requires that the circuit 
3 HRS § 706 -606 provides four factors for the court to consider in 
imposing a sentence: 
(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense and the 
history and characteristics of the defendant; 
(2) The need for the sentence imposed : 
(a) To reflect the seriousness of the offense, to 
promote respect for law, and to provide just 
punishment for the offense; 
(b) To afford adequate deterrence to criminal 
conduct; 
(c) To protect the public from further crimes of 
the defendant; and 
(d) To provide the defendant with needed 
educational or vocational training, medical 
care, or other correctional treatment in the 
most effective manner; 
(3) The kinds of sentences available; and 
(4) The need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities 
among defendants with similar records who have been 
found guilty of similar conduct.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court (1) identify the facts or circumstances within the range 
of statutory factors it should have considered, and (2) confirm 
that the decision was deliberate, rational, and fair. See 
Lewi v. State , 145 Hawaiʻi 333, 350, 452 P.3d 330, 347 (2019). 
On this record, we conclude that the circuit court 
sufficiently identified the facts and circumstances that 
provided the basis for its imposition of a consecutive prison 
sentence under the sentencing factors set forth in HRS § 706 -
606, and it confirmed tha t the decision was "deliberate, 
rational, and fair." We find that the circuit court articulated 
a meaningful rationale for each consecutive sentence. State v. 
Bautista , 153 Hawaiʻi 284, 291, 535 P.3d 1029, 1036 (2023) ("A 
court's rationale must be tether ed to each consecutive 
sentence.") 
The circuit court extensively considered the need for 
Oili's sentences to reflect the seriousness of his offenses, to 
promote respect for the law, to deter other criminal conduct, to 
provide just punishment, to protect the public from further 
crimes of the defendant, and to provide educational training or 
treatment. The circuit court considered, inter alia , the 
seriousness of Oili's 2011 conviction for Terroristic 
Threatening, and his 2014 conviction for assaulting a law 
enforcement officer, the fact that he was convicted of 
9   
 
 
  
 
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
committing additional crimes after these convictions, and his 
continued use of drugs and illegal possession of firearms. The 
circuit court further explained that its imposition of 
consecutive terms of imprisonment for Oili's 2011 and 2014 
convictions "is based on the need to protect the public, and the 
other factors which I stated above is the repeated resort to 
drugs and firearms after being revoked on probation." 
We conclude that the circuit court's statements at the 
sentencing hearing clearly explained its rationale for imposing 
consecutive terms of imprisonment. As the circuit court 
concluded, Oili was placed on probation multiple times, and he 
was given multipl e chances for rehabilitation. However, his 
continued commission of crimes, use of drugs, and illegal 
possession of firearms demonstrated that "[i]t's clear [Oili is] 
not probationable." The circuit court then determined that, 
given these facts and circum stances, the imposition of 
consecutive terms of imprisonment was necessary to protect the 
public.
