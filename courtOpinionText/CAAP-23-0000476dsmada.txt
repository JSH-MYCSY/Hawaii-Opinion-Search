NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
NO. CAAP-23-0000476 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I  
ROSEL LYN ROMANCIA; CHANTELLE LYNN KANANI FERNANDEZ;
SABRINA CELETE ROBERSON, aka SABRINA ROBERSON-ARGEND,
Plaintiffs-Appellees, v.
MICHAEL YELLEN, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
PUNA DIVISION 
(CIVIL NO. 3DRC-22-0000507) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that self-
represented Defendant-Appellant Michael Yellen (Yellen) appeals 
from the District Court of the Third Circuit, Puna Division's 
May 10, 2023 Judgment for Possession (Judgment) and July 25, 2023 
minute order denying Yellen's September 23, 2022 Defendant's 
Motion to Dismiss the Instant Case (Oral Order). 
Though the Judgment is appealable pursuant to the 
Forgay1 doctrine, Ciesla v. Reddish , 78 Hawai#i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 
702, 704 (1995), Yellen filed the August 11, 2023 notice of appeal more than 30 days after its entry, which is outside of the deadline set forth in Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 4(a)(1). The record does not indicate that Yellen timely requested or received an extension of time to appeal, or that the deadline was otherwise tolled or extended. Compliance with the 
1 Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848). No final judgment,
order, or decree has been entered in the underlying case. Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
requirement of timely filing a notice of appeal is 
jurisdictional. Grattafiori v. State
, 79 Hawai#i 10, 13, 897 
P.2d 937, 940 (1995). 
A minute order is not an appealable order. Abrams v. 
Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright
, 88 Hawai'#i 319, 321 n.3, 966 
P.2d 631, 633 n.3 (1998). Even if the Oral Order was reduced to a written order, it would not be appealable under HRS ยง 641-1(a), and no exception to finality applies. 
See Greer v. Baker
, 137 
Hawai#i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (setting forth the 
requirements for appealability under the collateral-order doctrine and the 
Forgay doctrine). 
When the court "perceive[s] a jurisdictional defect in 
an appeal, [it] must, sua sponte, dismiss that appeal." Bacon v. 
Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.
