APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CC161000169) NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Nakasone, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Eboni A. Prentice  appeals from the Amended Final 
Judgment  for Wells Fargo  Bank, N.A. entered by the Circuit Court 
of the Second Circuit on October 27, 2025.1 Prentice challenges 
the July 18, 2023 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment Against All 
Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure . We 
vacate and remand. 
Wells Fargo sued Prentice to foreclose on a mortgage. 
A copy of Prentice's Note to Academy Mortgage  Corporation was 
attached to the complaint. The Note was specially indorsed to Wells Fargo,
2 then indorsed in blank by Wells Fargo. 
Wells Fargo moved for summary judgment and a decree of 
foreclosure in February 2023.3 The Circuit Court entered an 
order granting the motion and a foreclosure judgment on July 18, 2023. Prentice timely appealed. The Amended Final Judgment was entered on a temporary remand. 
Prentice contends that summary judgment should not have 
been granted because (1) Wells Fargo failed to show it had possession of the Note when its complaint was filed, (2) Wells Fargo did not properly authenticate its business records, and (3) there were genuine issues of material fact. 
1 The Honorable Kirstin M. Hamman presided. 
2 "When specially indorsed, an instrument becomes payable to the
identified person and may be negotiated only by the indorsement of that
person." Hawaii Revised Statutes § 490:3-205 (2008). 
3 Prentice never answered the complaint. Her default was entered. 
It was never set aside. Prentice opposed Wells Fargo's motion for summaryjudgment, and the Circuit Court decided the motion on the merits withoutsetting aside Prentice's default. Wells Fargo's supplemental brief states"this error should be seen as harmless" and asks that we "review the results of the foreclosure proceeding as they occurred in the remainder of the record,given the circuit court's apparent decision to resolve this case as if thedefault had in fact been formally set aside." On remand, the parties maystipulate to set aside the entry of default.

We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. Nozawa 
v. Operating Engineers Local Union No. 3, 142 Hawai #i 331, 338, 
418 P.3d 1187, 1194 (2018). Summary judgment is appropriate when 
the moving party shows, by admissible evidence, that the material facts are uncontroverted and it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id.
 at 342, 418 P.3d at 1198. 
(1) A foreclosing plaintiff must establish it was 
entitled to enforce the note when its complaint was filed. U.S. 
Bank Tr., N.A. v. Verhagen , 149 Hawai #i 315, 327, 489 P.3d 419, 
431 (2021). Wells Fargo submitted declarations from its employee Armenia Harrell. 
Harrell authenticated records made in the 
regular course of Wells Fargo's mortgage servicing business. 
Harrell was an "other qualified witness" to 
authenticate Wells Fargo's own business records under Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 803(b)(6) because she "received training on, understand[s] the codes used in, and [has] knowledge of how information is entered, generated, and maintained on the computer system used by Wells Fargo to make these records, including, but not limited to, the document imaging process, how letters are created and maintained on Wells Fargo's system of record, and how payments, fees, and charges are tracked on Wells Fargo's system of record." See State v. Fitzwater
, 122 Hawai #i 354, 366, 227 
P.3d 520, 532 (2010). Harrell's declaration explained how Wells 
Fargo's own records show it had possession of the original Note when its foreclosure complaint was filed. 
Prentice argues that Harrell's declaration doesn't 
sufficiently demonstrate circumstances indicating trustworthiness of Wells Fargo's records as required under 
Deutsche Bank National 
Trust Co. v. Yata , 152 Hawai #i 322, 526 P.3d 299 (2023) and 
Verhagen . The documents in those cases had been received from 
another loan servicer and 
incorporated into the current loan 
servicer's business records. See Yata, 152 Hawai #i at 333, 526 
P.3d at 310 (citing Verhagen , 149 Hawai #i at 325, 489 P.3d at 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
429, and quoting Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Behrendt , 142 Hawai i# 
37, 45, 414 P.3d 89, 97 (2018)). 
Here, Wells Fargo's own records show it possessed the 
original Note. Promissory notes are not hearsay. Verhagen , 149 
Hawai#i at 317, 489 P.3d at 421. Harrell was qualified to prove 
that Wells Fargo was a "[p]erson entitled to enforce" the Note 
under Hawaii Revised Statutes § 490:3-301 when its complaint was filed. 
(2) Prentice argues that summary judgment should not 
have been granted because "the record of the prior servicer should not be admitted[.]" 
She again relies on Behrendt , 
Verhagen , and Yata . Her argument has merit. 
The Note is dated July 2, 2015. Academy Mortgage is 
the lender. Prentice signed the Note on July 6, 2015. Harrell's declaration states that Wells Fargo "became servicer for the Loan effective 09/01/2015." Exhibit 9 shows the location of the collateral file for Prentice's loan on 07/17/2015 to be NWB-CUST, but Harrell's declaration doesn't identify NWB-CUST or state who serviced Prentice's loan before Wells Fargo took over on September 1, 2015. 
Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to 
Prentice, Nozawa, 142 Hawai #i at 338, 418 P.3d at 1194, someone 
other than Wells Fargo serviced Prentice's loan between July 6, 2015 (when Prentice signed the Note) and September 1, 2015. Wells Fargo should have incorporated the prior servicer's records into its own. Harrell's declaration doesn't show circumstances indicating the trustworthiness of the incorporated records, which should have included the history of Prentice's loan payments between July 6, 2015 and September 1, 2015. The accuracy of the prior servicer's payment history affects the accuracy of Exhibit 6, Wells Fargo's own payment history, which is material to whether and when Prentice defaulted. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Other than the copy of the Note,4 Wells Fargo failed to 
establish the facts material to its motion for summary judgment 
through admissible evidence. See Yata, 152 Hawai #i at 333, 526 
P.3d at 310; Verhagen , 149 Hawai #i at 325, 489 P.3d at 429; 
Behrendt , 142 Hawai #i at 45, 414 P.3d at 97. 
(3) Prentice argues that summary judgment should not 
have been granted because there were genuine issues of material fact. We conclude there were, but not those involving Patrick Soria or payments Prentice claims to have made to him.
5 
Wells Fargo originally moved for summary judgment on 
February 9, 2017. The motion was supported by a declaration from Wells Fargo employee Gary L. Hughes. Hughes stated: "Wells Fargo 
has serviced the Loan since its origination." Hughes is contradicted by Harrell, who stated Wells Fargo "became servicer for the Loan effective 09/01/2015." 
The contradiction is material because if Wells Fargo 
was not the original loan servicer, it would have to show circumstances indicating trustworthiness of the prior loan servicer's records incorporated by Wells Fargo. See Yata, 152 Hawai#i at 333, 526 P.3d at 310; Verhagen
, 149 Hawai#i at 325, 489 
P.3d at 429; Behrendt, 142 Hawai #i at 45, 414 P.3d at 97. That 
genuine issue of material fact should have precluded summary judgment because, as we stated, the record doesn't show circumstances indicating the trustworthiness of any prior servicer's incorporated records. 
4 The copy of the Note attached to the motion for summary judgment
was properly authenticated by Wells Fargo's counsel, who had possession of the
original Note when the motion was filed. 
5 We express no opinion concerning the materiality of the payments
Prentice contends she made to Soria, or their legal effect.
