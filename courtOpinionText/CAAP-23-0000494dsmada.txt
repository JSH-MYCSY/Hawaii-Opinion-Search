ORDER  DISMISSING   APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,   Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka   and  Wadsworth,   JJ.) 
Upon review
 of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On December 6, 2023, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief; 
(2) On
 February 27, 2024, the court granted self-
represented Plaintiff-Appellant William Gilroy's (Gilroy) 
December 8, 2023 motion for relief from default of the statement 
of jurisdiction and opening brief, and extended the filing 
deadlines to March 28, 2024. The court cautioned Gilroy that any 
further default of the statement of jurisdiction or opening brief 
may result in the appeal being dismissed, under Hawai i Rules  of 
Appellate Procedure Rules 12.1(e) or 30; and 
(3) Gilroy has not taken any further action in this 
appeal.
