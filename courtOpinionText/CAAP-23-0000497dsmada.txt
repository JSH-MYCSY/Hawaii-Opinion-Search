APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CC161000234) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
John D. Charbonneau  appealed from the July 28, 2023 
judgment of foreclosure entered by the Circuit Court of the 
Second Circuit.  Charbonneau did not obtain a stay of 
enforcement of the judgment of foreclosure. The foreclosure Commissioner  filed a report on December 12, 2023. The 
Commissioner reported: 1
three registered bidders entered ninety-one additional and
successively higher bids with the final and winning bidcoming in [from CNADY LLC] at $1,100,000.00. . . . Interestin the property has been strong and your Commissioner 
1 The Honorable Kirstin M. Hamman presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
recommends that the Court schedule a hearing and reopen
bidding for the subject property to determine if there areadditional bids for the property from other potentialbidders. 
U.S. Bank  National Association moved to confirm the 
foreclosure sale on December 14, 2023. The motion requested a 
finding "that CNADY, L.L.C. is a bona fide good faith purchase[r.]" Charbonneau opposed confirmation of the sale and filed a "Motion of Non-appearance" at the hearing. The circuit court heard the motion to confirm on January 18, 2024. Charbonneau did not appear. No bidders other than the winning bidder were present. The circuit court orally granted the motion. 
The circuit court entered its "Order Approving 
Commissioner's Report and Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Confirmation of Foreclosure Sale, Allowance of Costs, Commissions and Fees, Distribution of Proceeds, Directing Conveyance and for Writ of Possession/Ejectments, [sic] Filed December 14, 2023" on September 10, 2024.
2 The order contained a finding "that the 
price obtained by the Commissioner fairly represents the market value of the Mortgaged Property under the circumstances of the sale and present economic conditions and that no other person indicated any interest in submitting a higher bid." The order also contained this finding: 
3. That CNADY, L.L.C. is a bona fide purchaser,
without any affiliation to [U.S. Bank] or its agents, as
supported by [U.S. Bank]'s Motion. Defendant JOHN D. CHARBONNEAU failed to raise any factual or evidentiaryobjection regarding CNADY, L.L.C. as a bona fide purchaserof the Property, and as such, any objection is deemedwaived. 
The circuit court entered its Judgment  confirming the 
foreclosure sale on September 10, 2024. Charbonneau did not 
appeal from the Judgment or file a timely post-judgment tolling motion, and the time to appeal from the Judgment has expired. 
2 The proceedings below were stayed from January 22, 2024, until
July 18, 2024, because of Charbonneau's bankruptcy.
