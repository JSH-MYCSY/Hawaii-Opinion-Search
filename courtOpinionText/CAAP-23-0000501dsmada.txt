APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 3CCV-21-0000356) 
ORDER GRANTING IN PART MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Defendants-Appellees Erwin 
McMullen and Linda McMullen's (McMullen Parties) August 25, 2023 
Motion to Dismiss Appeal for Lack of Jurisdiction, the papers in 
support, and the record, and there being no opposition, it appears that on August 24, 2023, self-represented Plaintiff-Appellant Howard Hofelich (Hofelich) filed a notice of appeal 
from, inter alia, the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit's 
(Circuit Court) April 13, 2023 "Order Granting Defendants 
[McMullen Parties'] Motion for Partial Summary Judgment" (Partial 
Summary Judgment Order). McMullen Parties seek dismissal of the 
appeal and a sanction against Hofelich for attorney's fees and 
costs. They contend: the Partial Summary Judgment Order is not an appealable order; the Circuit Court did not grant leave to file an interlocutory appeal from the Partial Summary Judgment NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Order; even if the Partial Summary Judgment Order was appealable, 
the notice of appeal is untimely; and the appeal is frivolous. 
We conclude that the court lacks appellate 
jurisdiction. The Circuit Court has not entered a final, appealable judgment under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
ยง 641-1(a) (2016), Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
Rules 58, and Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 
Hawai#i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994), it has not 
certified the Partial Summary Judgment Order for appeal under HRCP Rule 54(b), it has not granted leave to file an interlocutory appeal under HRS ยง 641-1(b) (2016) from any order entered in the underlying case, and no exception to the finality rule applies to any of the orders identified in Hofelich's notice of appeal.
1 See Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai# i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 
832, 836 (2016) (setting out the requirements for the collateral order and Forgay doctrines). Therefore, the court lacks appellate jurisdiction, and the appeal must be dismissed. 
McMullen Parties seek attorney's fees and costs under 
Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 38, under which 
the court may award damages for a frivolous appeal after it decides the appeal. 
Upon review and consideration of the 
McCullen Parties arguments and the record, the court declines to award attorney's fees and costs pursuant to HRAP Rule 38. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is 
granted in part and denied in part as follows: 
1. The appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 2.
 The request for attorney's fees and costs is denied 
without prejudice to a request for costs pursuant to HRAP Rule 39. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, September 11, 2023.
