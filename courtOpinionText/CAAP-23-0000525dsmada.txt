NO.  CAAP-23-0000525 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
T.R.,  on  behalf  of  a  minor,  Plaintiff-Appellee,  v. 
D.R.,  Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  FAMILY  COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT 
(CASE  NO.  3FDA-23-0000643) 
ORDER  DISMISSING   APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,   Presiding   Judge,  Hiraoka   and  Wadsworth,   JJ.) 
Upon
 review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) Self-represented Defendant-Appellant D.R. 
(Appellant ) appeals from the Family Court of the Third Circuit's 
August 15, 2023 Amended Temporary Restraining Order, entered in 
3FDA-23-0000643. 
(2) On November 1, 2023, the Family Court entered an 
Order Dissolving Temporary Restraining Order, which dissolves the 
August 15, 2023 Amended Temporary Restraining Order and enters a 
final decision in Appellant's favor, dismissing the underlying 
case with prejudice. 
(3) An appeal is moot where "events subsequent to the 
judgment of the trial court have so affected the relations 
between the parties that the two conditions for justiciability 
relevant on appeal—adverse interest and effective remedy—have 
been compromised." Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 119 
Hawai i 1, 5, 193 P.3d 839, 843 (2008). Courts "may not decide 
moot questions or abstract propositions of law." Life of the 
Land v. Burns, 59 Haw. 244, 250, 580 P.2d 405, 409 (1978)

IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  all  pending  motions  are 
dismissed.
