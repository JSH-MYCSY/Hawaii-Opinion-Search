ROXANNE EDAYAN and JUSTIN GOREE, Plaintiffs-Appellants, 
v. 
ASSOCIA HAWAII, GWENN BRESSLAUER, and DANIEL KAWAI, 
Defendants-Appellees. 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
HONOLULU DIVISION 
(CIVIL NO. 1DRC-22-0007572)  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Self-represented Plaintiff-Appellant Roxanne Edayan  
appeals from the District Court of the First Circuit's 
September 28, 2023 order granting Defendants-Appellees Associa 
Hawaii, Gwenn Bresslauer,  and Daniel Kawai's (collectively, 
1
1 We note that Defendant- Appellee Gwenn Bresslauer is variably 
identified in the record as "Gwenn Bresslauer," "Gwen Bresslaer," and "Gwenn 
Phillips." For purposes of this disposition, we adopt the spelling in the 
Complaint.   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  
 
   
 
   
 
  
 
 Associa) motion to enforce the mediated settlement agreement and 
dismiss with prejudice.2 
We first note that Edayan's opening brief does not 
comply with Hawai‘ i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28. 
Notwithstanding, we address the issues raised to the extent we can discern in an effort to provide access to justice. Morgan
v. Plan. Dep't, Cnty. of 
Kauaʻi, 104 Hawai‘ i 173, 180-81, 86 P.3d 
982, 989-90 (2004). 
On appeal, Edayan appears to contend the district 
court erred by failing to enter a default judgment against 
Associa and her due process rights were violated. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this appeal as discussed below and affirm. 
According to Edayan, she worked for Associa but was 
terminated. Edayan states "[t]his case is about [her] getting 
her things back after being terminated." 
2 The Honorable Timothy E. Ho presided. 
In addition to Edayan, 
Justin Goree signed the notice of appeal. 
However, the record reflects that Edayan filed the opening brief, and neither 
Edayan nor Goree signed the opening brief as required by Hawai‘i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 32 and Hawai‘i Electronic Filing and Service 
Rules Rule 5. Edayan is not an attorney and cannot represent Goree. Thus, 
we address the issues raised in the opening brief as to Edayan only.

    In November 2022, Edayan filed a complaint for return 
of personal property. 
The parties participated in mediation and reached a 
settlement agreement. 
In June 2023, based on the settlement agreement, 
Associa sent a stipulation to dismiss the case to Edayan, but 
she refused to sign the stipulation. 
In August 2023, Associa moved to enforce the 
settlement agreement and to dismiss the case with prejudice (Motion to Enforce and Dismiss). 
Attached to the motion was the 
settlement agreement signed by Edayan. According to the agreement, Edayan was "entitled to the items identified in the 
list attached hereto as EXHIBIT A, with the exception of all 
paperwork and manuals and any items for which [Associa] has a 
receipt showing that such items were purchased with [its] 
funds." Exhibit A listed nineteen items. Edayan opposed the 
Motion to Enforce and Dismiss. 
On August 28, 2023, the district court held a hearing 
on, and granted, the Motion to Enforce and Dismiss.
3 The 
district court entered its order granting the Motion to Enforce 
and Dismiss on September 28, 2023. Edayan timely appealed. 
3 In the district court, Edayan requested transcripts for the 
August 28, 2023 hearing. However, there are no transcripts in the district 
court record or appellate record. See HRAP Rule 10 (explaining the procedure 
for requesting transcripts).

 On appeal, Edayan appears to contend that (1) the 
district court erred by failing to enter a default judgment 
against Associa, and (2) her due process rights were violated. 
We affirm. 
(1) Edayan first contends "[a] Default Judgment 
should have been taken against the defendants as the SUMMONS 
states." 
Edayan argues that the summons requires a written 
answer or an appearance before the district court, and "[n]one 
of which the above was addressed by the Court." 
The summons attached to the complaint required Associa 
to file an answer or appear "at 1:30 p.m. on the second Monday 
following date of service." The complaint was served on 
December 5, 2022. We take judicial notice, pursuant to Rule 201 
of the Hawai‘ i Rules of Evidence, that the second Monday after 
December 5, 2022, was December 19, 2022. The minutes for 
December 19, 2022, state that attorney "Melanie Oyama [was] 
present via Zoom for [Defendants] Associa Hawaii, Gwen [sic] 
Bresslauer, and Dan Kawai." (Formatting altered.) 
Thus, the record does not support Edayan's claim that 
default judgment should have been entered for failing to comply with the summons. 
(2) Edayan also contends her due process rights were 
violated, because she received no notice that "attorney Oyama 
was going to be representing [Associa] during the December 19, 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 2022 hearing" or that the January 30, 2023 hearing was changed 
to February 21, 2023. 
"[D]ue process is not a fixed concept requiring a 
specific procedural course in every situation. Rather, due 
process calls for such procedural protections as the particular 
situation demands, but its basic elements are notice and an 
opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful 
manner." Davis v. Bissen, 154 Hawai‘ i 68, 82, 545 P.3d 557, 571 
(2024) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
As to Oyama appearing at the December 19, 2022 
hearing, Edayan provides no authority to support her contention 
that failing to notify her that Oyama would be representing Associa violated due process. As discussed above, the summons 
attached to the complaint required Associa to answer or appear 
at court on a particular day; here, it was December 19, 2022. 
On December 19, 2022, Oyama appeared on behalf of Associa. 
Oyama's appearance on behalf of Associa without notifying Edayan 
did not violate her due process rights. 
As to Edayan's argument that she received no notice 
that the January 30, 2023 hearing was changed to February 21, 2023, the minutes for January 30, 2023, state that Edayan was 
"present via Zoom" and the court ordered a pretrial conference 
for February 21, 2023. 
(Formatting altered.) Thus, the record 
does not support Edayan's argument that she received no notice 
5   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  
 
 
 
      
 of the February 21, 2023 hearing. 
There was no violation of 
Edayan's due process rights. 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court's 
September 28, 2023 order granting Associa's Motion to Enforce 
and Dismiss. 
It is further ordered that the August 21, 2025 motion 
for retention of oral argument is denied.
