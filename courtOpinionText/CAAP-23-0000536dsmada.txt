IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
O
F THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
IN THE INTEREST OF P.G. 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(FC-S NO. 22-0046) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that Mother-
Appellant N.G. filed a self-represented1 appeal from a June 16, 
2023 Order Concerning Child Protective Act, entered by the Family 
Court of the Third Circuit in FC-S No. 22-0046. The September 13, 2023 notice of appeal was filed more than thirty days after the order appealed-from, and the deadline to appeal was not tolled or extended. The notice of appeal is therefore untimely. See
 Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1); 
Grattafiori v. State
, 79 Hawai#i 10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995) 
("As a general rule, compliance with the requirement of the 
1 Though Appellant is represented by court-appointed counsel, she
filed the appeal pro se.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, . . . and 
we must dismiss an appeal on our motion if we lack jurisdiction." (citations & internal quotation marks omitted)); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of these rules."). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 23, 2024.
