(FC-S  NO.  22-0045) 
  
        ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of
 the record, it appears that: 
(1) The statement of jurisdiction and opening brief 
were due on or before November 7, 2023, and November 30, 2023, 
respectively; 
(2) Self-represented Mother-Appellant N.G. (Mother)1 
failed to file either document, or request an extension of time; 
(3) On December 5, 2023, the appellate clerk entered a 
default notice informing Mother that the time for filing the 
statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired, the 
matter would be called to the court's attention on December 15, 
2023, for appropriate action, which could include dismissal of 
the appeal under Hawai i Rules of  Appellate Procedure 
1 It appears that Mother is represented by counsel in the underlying 
case, FC-S No. 22-0045, but that she filed the appeal self-represented.
