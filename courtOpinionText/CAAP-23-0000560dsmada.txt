IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
MARSHALL  MARTINEZ,  Petitioner-Appellant,  v. 
SHANNON   CLUNEY,   WARDEN  FOR  HALAWA  CORRECTIONAL   FACILITY, 
Respondent-Appellee 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
(CASE  NO.  1CPN-23-0000003) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka   and  McCullen,   JJ.) 
Upon
 review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On
 February 28, 2024, the court granted self-
represented Petitioner-Appellant Marshall Martinez's (Martinez) 
December 15, 2023 motion for relief from default of the record on 
appeal and ordered that within twenty days from the order, 
"Martinez shall file in the underlying case, 1CPN-23-0000003, a 
motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis , 
consistent with Hawai i Rules  of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 24, or pay the filing fees in the full amount to the Supreme 
Court Clerk's Office." The court cautioned Martinez that failure 
to comply with the order may result in the appeal being 
dismissed; 
(2) On October 9, 2024, the court granted Martinez's 
March 15, 2024 motion to clarify the February 28, 2024 order and 
ordered Martinez to comply with the February 28, 2024 order by 
October 29, 2024, or the appeal could be dismissed; and 
(3) Martinez has not paid the filing fee or obtained a 
fee waiver for this appeal, resulting in no record on appeal          
           
          
          
        
        NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
being filed. An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay 
the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to 
proceed in forma pauperis . HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
