STATE OF HAWAI‘I, Plaintiff-Appellee,  
v.  
MITCHELL PERALTO, Defendant-Appellant  
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT  
(CASE NO. 5PC970000155)  
 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and Guidry, JJ.)  
Defendant -Appellant Mitchell Peralto (Peralto) appeals 
from the Second Order of Resentencing entered by the Circuit 
Court of the Fifth Circuit ( circuit court ) on September 26 , 
2023. 1 The issue before this court is whether the circuit court 
1 The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided.   
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
erred in ruling that Peralto's terms of imprisonment would run 
consecutively. 
Peralto  was charged in 1997  with: (1) Kidnapping, in 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 707-720 ( Count 1);  
and  (2) Murder in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS §§ 707-
701.5 and 706-656 ( Count 2). In January 1998, a jury found 
Peralto guilty as charged on both counts. In July 1998, Peralto 
was sentenced to enhanced sentences on both counts:  life 
imprisonment with the possibility of parole for Count 1, and 
life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for Count 2.  
The circuit court ordered the sentences to be served consecutively.      
In March 2001, the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court vacated 
Peralto's enhanced sentence for Count 2 (Murder) . See State v. 
Peralto, 95 Hawaiʻi 1, 18 P.3d 203 (2001) (abrogated on other 
grounds by State v. Kato , 147 Hawaiʻi 478, 465 P.3d 925 (2020) ). 
Pursuant to this decision, Peralto was resentenced on June 29, 
2004, as follows, 
IT IS HEREBY ADJUDGED, ORDERED AND DECREED that [Peralto] 
is sentenced as follows:  
As to Count I: Kidnapping: [Peralto] is committed to the 
custody of the Director of Public Safety for imprisonment for 
LIFE WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE.  
As to Count II: Murder in the Second Degree: [Peralto] is 
committed to the custody of the Director of Public Safety for 
imprisonment for LIFE WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE WITH A 
MANDATORY MINIMUM TERM OF TEN YEARS.  
2   
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the PERIODS OF CONFINEMENT AS TO 
COUNT I AND COUNT II SHALL RUN CONSECUTIVELY.  
(Emphasis in original) . 
On January 3, 2006, the Hawaii Paroling Authority 
(HPA) set Peralto's minimum term of imprisonment for Count 1 
(Kidnapping) at twenty -five years, to expire on July 4, 2022.2 
The HPA fixed Peralto's minimum term of imprisonment for Count 2 
(Murder) at forty years, with an expiration date to expire forty 
years after his minimum term for Count 1 had expired. The HPA 
thus notified Peralto that his Count 1 term would run first, 
before his Count 2 consecutive term of imprisonment began. 
In January 2023, Peralto petitioned, pursuant to 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 40, for post-conviction 
relief (Rule 40 petition ). Peralto's Rule 40 petition alleged 
ineffective assistance of counsel because Peralto's trial 
counsel did not object to his charging via complaint, instead of 
by a grand jury, as required pursuant to State v. Obrero, 
151  Hawaiʻi 472, 517 P.3d 755 (2022). After hearing Peralto's 
Rule  40 petition, the circuit court vacated Peralto's extended 
Pursuant to HRS § 706 -669(1) ( 2014), 
[w]hen a person has been sentenced to an indeterminate or an 
extended term of imprisonment, the Hawaii paroling authority 
shall, as soon as practicable but no later than six months after 
commitment to the custody of the director of the department of 
[public safety] hold a hearing, and on the basis of the hearing 
make an order fixing the minimum term of imprisonment to be 
served before the prisoner shall become eligible for parole.

sentence for Count 1, and denied all other relief. In September 
2023, the circuit court resentenced Peralto , as to Count 1, as 
follows, 
[Peralto's] sentence as to Count 1: Kidnapping, pursuant to 
the Judgment filed herein on July 10, 1998, is hereby 
amended and the defendant is hereby resentenced as follows: 
AS TO COUNT 1: KIDNAPPING : 
A. You shall be committed to the custody of the 
Director of the Department of Public Safety for 
imprisonment for a period of twenty (20) years with 
credit for time already served; mittimus to issue 
forthwith. Term of incarceration shall be served 
consecutively to Count 2: Murder in the Second Degree 
pursuant to the Judgment filed on July 10, 1998, as 
amended pursuant to the Order Re -Sentencing Defendant 
Mitchell Peralto filed on June 29, 2004, and as amended 
pursuant to the Amended Order Re -Sentencing Defendant 
Mitchell Peralto filed on December 9, 2005. 
(Emphasis in original) . 
Thus, when Peralto was resentenced in September 2023, 
his 20-year maximum term for Kidnapping in Count 1 had expired, 
and he was already serving his 40 -year minimum term for Murder 
in Count 2 . 
On appeal, Peralto raises two points of error, 
contending that the circuit court : (1) "Erred in Sentencing 
[Peralto] to Consecutive Terms [of imprisonment ] Pursuant to the 
Court's Interpretation of HRS § 706 -668.5"; and (2) "Committed 
Plain Error in Depriving [Peralto] of a Jury Determination on 
Consecutive Sentencing ." Upon careful review of the record and 
relevant legal authorities, we resolve Peralto's point s of error 
as follows.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) Peralto contends that the circuit court 
misinterpreted HRS § 706-668.5, thereby sentencing him to an 
illegal prison sentence , because "consecutive sentencing could 
not be imposed to an expired term[.]" Peralto maintains that 
the circuit court had previously vacated his life sentence for 
Count 1, and, upon resenten cing him to twenty years for Count 1 
—— a period of time that had already expired , Peralto's sentence 
for Count 2 could not then be imposed consecutively to the 
already-expired sentence for Count 1. 
"The applicable standard of review for sentencing or 
resentencing matters is whether the court committed plain and 
manifest abuse of discretion in its decision." State v. 
Tauiliili , 96 Hawaiʻi 195, 198, 29 P.3d 914, 917 (2001) (cleaned 
up). We conclude that the circuit court erred by ordering 
consecutive sentences when Peralto had already served the 
sentence imposed for Count 1 , and his sentence for Count 2 was 
the only unexpired prison sentence remaining . 
HRS § 706 -668.5 (Supp. 2022) provides, in pertinent 
part, 
(1) If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on 
a defendant, whether at the same time or at different 
times, or if a term of imprisonment is imposed on a 
defendant who is already subject to an unexpired term of 
imprisonment , the terms may run concurrently or 
consecutively. Multiple terms of imprisonment run 
concurrently unless the court orders or the statute 
mandates that the terms run consecutively.

The  circuit court did two things  at the September 2023 
hearing:   first, it resentenced Peralto to a prison term of 
twenty years for Count 1, and second, it ordered that the newly 
imposed twenty-year term would begin to run after the previously 
imposed life term for Count 2 expired. The circuit court 
explained,  
 . . . . 
this Court is resentencing you, Mr. Peralto, as follows:  
 
As to Count One, kidnapping, the Court is ordering 
that you be committed to the custody of the director of 
Department of Public Safety for imprisonment for a period 
of 20 years. You'll be given credit for time served. 
Mittimus to issue forthwith.  
  
That sentence will run consecutive to the sentence 
that you're currently serving on Count Two, Murder in the 
Second Degree.  
Peralto had already served nearly twenty-six years in 
prison at the time he was resentenced to a twenty-year term for 
Count 1 in September 2023.  The State itself concedes that it 
understands Peralto to have already served his twenty-year term 
for Count 1.   3
On this record, according to the HPA 's 2006 minimum 
term determination, Peralto's life sentence was the only 
remaining "unexpired" prison term after he was resentenced to a 
3 Although the HPA fixed Peralto's minimum term of imprisonment for 
Count 1 at twenty -five years, the reduction of Peralto's Count 1 sentence , 
from an enhanced life sentence with a twenty-five-year minimum, to an 
ordinary term of twenty-years imprisonment , would necessar ily result in a new 
maximum term expiration date of no later than July 4, 2017. The State 
represented in its answering brief that, "The State does not dispute that 
[Peralto's] imprisonment term for Kidnapping, Count 1, expired in July of 
2017."

twenty-year prison term for Count 1 . A sentence cannot run 
consecutively with itself, and it cannot, pursuant to HRS § 706 -
668.5, run consecutively with an already expired prison 
sentence. The plain language of HRS § 706 -668.5 provides that, 
"if a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who is 
already subject to an unexpired term of imprisonment , the terms 
may run concurrently or consecutively." Id. (emphasis added); 
see State v. Abihai , 146 Hawaiʻi 398, 408, 463 P.3d 1055 , 1065 
(2020) ("[T]he fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself. . . . 
[W]here the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, [the 
court's] sole duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious 
meaning."). HRS § 706 -668.5 uses the word "term," not the word 
"sentence. " Peralto's maximum term for Count 1 had expired, and 
he had already begun serving his term for Count 2 when he was 
resentenced. The circuit court therefore abused its discretion 
in ruling that Peralto's sentence of twenty-years imprisonment 
for Count 1 would run consecutively with the only prison 
sentence , for Count 2, that he was currently serving upon his 
resentencing for Count 1 in September 2023 . 
We therefore vacate the circuit court's Second Order 
of Resentencing in part, and remand for Peralto's twenty -year 
sentence for Count 1, and life sentence with parole for Count 2, 
to be imposed as concurrent sentences.

(2) Peralto contends that the circuit court committed 
plain error by "depriv[ing] [him] of his right to a jury in a 
determination of a consecutive sentence, which is in effect an 
extended term ." In making this argument, Peralto acknowledges 
that he was not sentenced to an "extended term," but, relying on 
Flubacher v. State, 142 Hawai ʻi 109, 414 P.3d 161 (2018), he 
argues that "the effect of a consecutive sentence is, for all 
intents and purposes, an extended term, as it imposes a sentence 
more than and extends beyond the 20-year maximum sentence for a 
Class A felony offense of Kidnapping." 
In Flubacher, the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court held that, 
pursuant to Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), 
Flubacher's sentence was illegal because "a judge, and not a 
jury, made the required finding that Flubacher's extended term 
sentence  was necessary for the protection of the public." Id.  
at 118, 414 P.3 at 170.   Peralto's reliance on Flubacher  is 
misplaced.  
In  State v. Kahapea, 111 Hawaiʻi 267, 141 P.3d 440 
(2006), the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court held that Apprendi  is not 
applicable to the imposition of consecutive terms of imprisonment.   See  id.  at 280, 141 P.3d at 453 (quoting  People 
v. Wagener, 752 N.E.2d 430, 441-42 (Ill. 2001), for the proposition that: "[S]entences which run consecutively to each 
other are not transmuted thereby into a single sentence. 
8   
 
 
   
 
  
 
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Because consecutive sentences remain discrete, a determination 
that sentences are to be served consecutively cannot run afoul 
of Apprendi , which only addresses sentences for individual 
crimes."). Pursuant to Kahapea, Peralto's contention that he 
was constitutionally entitled to a jury trial on the consecutive 
term sentence s lacks merit. 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the circuit 
court's Second Order of Resentencing , entered on September 26, 
2023, in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent 
with this summary disposition order.
