NO.  CAAP-23-0000570 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
MARK  FUKUDA,  Plaintiff-Appellant,  v. 
DR.  WILLIAM  WONG,  SR.,  individually  and  as  President  &  CEO  of 
HAWAII  DERMATOLOGY  &  SURGERY,  INC.; 
HAWAII  DERMATOLOGY  &  SURGERY,  INC.,  Defendants-Appellees 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL  NO.  1CCV-21-0000634) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL  FOR  LACK  OF  JURISDICTION 
(By:   Leonard,  Presiding  Judge,  McCullen  and  Guidry,  JJ.) 
Upon  review  of  the  record,  it  appears  that  self-
represented  Plaintiff-Appellant  Mark  Fukuda  (Fukuda)  appeals  from 
the  June  23,  2023  Final  Judgment  entered  by  the  Circuit  Court  of 
the  First  Circuit.   Fukuda  filed  his  October  10,  2023  notice  of 
appeal  more  than  30  days  after  entry  of  the  Final  Judgment,  which 
is  outside  of  the  deadline  set  forth  in  Hawai i  Rules  of 
Appellate   Procedure   (HRAP)  Rule  4(a)(1).    The  record  does  not 
indicate  that  Fukuda  received  an  extension  of  time  to  appeal 
under  HRAP  Rule  4(a)(4),  or  that  the  deadline  was  otherwise 
tolled  by  a  timely-filed  post-judgment  motion  under  HRAP 
Rule  4(a)(3).   Compliance  with  the  requirement  of  timely  filing  a 
notice  of  appeal  is  jurisdictional.   Grattafiori  v.  State,  79 
Hawai i  10,  13,  897  P.2d  937,  940  (1995);  see  also  Hawai i  Rules 
of  Civil  Procedure   Rule  77(d)  ("Lack  of  notice  of  the  entry  [of  a 
judgment]   by  the  clerk  or  failure  to  make  such  service  does  not 
affect  the  time  to  appeal  or  relieve  or  authorize  the  court  to

relieve  a  party  for  failure  to  appeal  within  the  time 
allowed[.]").  
Therefore,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  the  appeal  is 
dismissed  for  lack  of  jurisdiction. 
IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  all  pending  motions  are 
dismissed.
