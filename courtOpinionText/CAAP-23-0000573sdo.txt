APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC141002192) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Nakasone, Chief Judge, and Wadsworth and Guidry, JJ.) 
Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff-Appellant Phyllis 
Kehaulani Duncan Chun (
Chun), self-represented, appeals from the 
September 28, 2023 Judgment entered in favor of Plaintiff/ 
Counterclaim Defendant-Appellee U.S. Bank National Association as Trustee for the Certificateholders Citigroup Mortgage Loan Trust Inc. Asset-Backed Pass-Through Certificates Series 2007-AHL3 (U.S. Bank) by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.  Chun 
also challenges the Circuit Court's September 12, 2023 Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order (FOFs/COLs). 
1/
1/ The Honorable Jeffrey P. Crabtree presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
In return for a loan (Loan), Chun executed a promissory 
note (Note) in favor of Accredited Home Lenders, Inc. 
(Accredited). The Note was secured by a mortgage (Mortgage) on 
certain real property owned by Chun. Later, the Loan was 
conveyed and the Mortgage was assigned to U.S. Bank; the servicing of the Loan was transferred to Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (SPS). 
After Chun defaulted on the Note, U.S. Bank filed a 
foreclosure complaint against her. Chun answered the complaint and filed a counterclaim against U.S. Bank. During the course of the litigation, U.S. Bank and Chun filed various motions for summary judgment, all of which were ultimately denied. Following a three-day jury-waived trial, the Circuit Court entered (1) an interlocutory decree of foreclosure as requested by U.S. Bank, and (2) judgment in favor of U.S. Bank on the complaint and the counterclaim. 
On appeal, Chun contends that the Circuit Court erred 
in "determining that SPS had possession of [the Note] since 2012 and . . . [U.S.] Bank is the owner of Chun's Mortgage and . . . Note thereby entitling standing [sic] to bring this wrongful foreclosure action against Chun." (Capitalization altered.) Relatedly, Chun challenges FOFs 9 through 17, COLs 5 through 43, and the Judgment. 
We review a trial court's findings of fact under the 
clearly erroneous standard. 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Behrendt, 
142 Hawai# i 37, 40, 414 P.3d 89, 92 (2018) (citing Dan v. State, 
76 
Hawai#i 423, 428, 879 P.2d 528, 533 (1994)). A finding of 
fact "is clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence in support of the finding, the appellate court is nonetheless left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made." Est. of Klink ex rel. Klink v. State, 113 Hawai# i 332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 (2007) (quoting Troyer v. 
Adams, 102 Hawai# i 399, 409-10, 77 P.3 83, 93-94 (2003)). We 
review conclusions of law de novo under the right/wrong standard. Behrendt, 142 Hawai# i at 40-41, 414 P.3d at 92-93 (citing Marvin 
v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai# i 490, 495, 280 P.3d 88, 93 (2012)). "[A 
2  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
conclusion of law] that is supported by the trial court's 
[findings of fact] and that reflects an application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned." Est. of Klink, 113 
Hawai#i at 351, 152 P.3d at 523 (quoting Thompson v. Kyo-Ya Co., 
112 Hawai# i 472, 474, 146 P.3d 1049, 1051 (2006)). A mixed 
finding of fact and conclusion of law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard because it depends on the facts and circumstances of the case. Id. (quoting Thompson, 112 Hawai# i at 
474, 146 P.3d at 1051). 
After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Chun's contentions as follows and affirm. 
At the outset, Chun appears to contend that U.S. Bank 
lacked standing to enforce the Note when the foreclosure complaint was filed. 
A foreclosing plaintiff must establish its standing to 
enforce the subject promissory note when the complaint was filed. See Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai# i 361, 368, 390 
P.3d 1248, 1255 (2017). A person entitled to enforce the note includes the "holder," defined in this context as "[t]he person in possession of a negotiable instrument that is payable either to bearer or to an identified person that is the person in possession[.]" HRS §§ 490:1-201(b), :3-301 (2008); 
see U.S. Bank 
Trust, N.A., as Trustee for LSF9 Master Participation Trust v. Verhagen, 149 Hawai# i 315, 327-28, 489 P.3d 419, 431-32 (2021) 
(ruling that the foreclosing plaintiff presented admissible evidence showing its actual or constructive possession, through its loan servicer, of the note indorsed in blank when the complaint was filed). 
Here, U.S. Bank has asserted that through its servicing 
agent SPS, it was the holder in possession of the Note and Allonge to Note (Allonge),
2/ indorsed in blank, at the time the 
2/  An allonge is a "paper sometimes attached to a negotiable
instrument for the purpose of receiving further indorsements when the original
paper is filled with indorsements." Behrendt, 142 Hawai #i at 39 n.1, 414 P.3d
at 91 n.1 (quoting Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise, 130 Hawai #i 
11, 14 n.6, 304 P.3d 1192, 1195 n.6 (2013)).

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
complaint was filed on October 20, 2014. At trial, U.S. Bank 
presented substantial evidence supporting this assertion. This evidence included the testimony of Patrick Pittman (Pittman), the 
SPS Litigation Director and Document Control Officer with 
approximately 21 years of experience working for SPS. He stated that he is familiar with the practices and procedures of SPS and the systems of record that SPS uses to create and record information related to the residential mortgage loans that it services, including the process by which information is entered into those systems and how those records are maintained. 
FOFs 21 through 36, which Chun does not dispute,
 
further summarized Pittman's testimony and the related documentary evidence as follows: 3/
21. Where, as here, SPS acquires the servicing rights
from a prior servicer, the prior servicer's records for the
loan are incorporated and boarded into SPS's systems suchthat the prior servicer's records concerning the loan arepart of SPS's business records. SPS relies upon theaccuracy of those boarded records in providing its loanservicing functions. 
22. Prior to boarding a loan into SPS's system
platform, SPS conducts a data vetting process orreconciliation process of all information that is receivedfrom the prior servicer. Hard copy documents are alsoreviewed to find any data discrepancies. . . . 
23. SPS works with the prior servicer regarding any
data discrepancies or inaccuracies that are found. All loans that are boarded into SPS's system platform have gonethrough the data vetting process. Those records that were previously incorporated into the prior servicer's recordsare then incorporated into SPS's records. 
24. On or about September 27, 2012, SPS performed an
audit of the original documents for the Loan, including theoriginal wet-ink Note and Allonge to Note (together the"Original Note and Allonge "), the original Mortgage, and the
original Title Policy for the Loan (collectively, the"Collateral File "). 
25. On or about September 27, 2012, images of the
Original Note and Allonge, which accurately depict theOriginal Note and Allonge (indorsed in blank), were scannedand uploaded into SPS's database. 
. . . . 
28. On or about October 10, 2012, the Collateral File
for the Loan, including the Original Note and Allonge, was 
3/ See Okada Trucking Co. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 Hawai #i 450,
458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002) (unchallenged findings of fact are binding on
appeal).

placed into SPS's secured vault facility. . . . 
29. In December 2015, the Collateral File for the
Loan, including the Original Note and Allonge, was relocated
from the secured vault facility at [SPS's] initialheadquarters location to the secured vault facility at SPS'snew headquarters (" Decker Lake "), both locations being
within Salt Lake City, Utah. 
30. According to the Audit Report for the File Trail
System, which tracks the movement of the collateral file, noone accessed, and there was no movement of, the CollateralFile for the Loan between November 8, 2012 and December 4,2015. . . . 
. . . . 
32. On or about May 5, 2016, the Collateral File for
the Loan was pulled from shelf location 1HK5 in SPS's
secured vault facility at Decker Lake. The Original Noteand Allonge were removed from the Collateral File and sentto U.S. Bank's foreclosure counsel Leu Okuda & Doi (the " Leu 
Firm") with a Bailee Letter. 
. . . . 
36. Pittman testified that based on his review of 
SPS's business records relating to the Loan, [U.S. Bank],
through its agents, had possession of the Original Note andAllonge at the time the Complaint was filed on October 20,2014, and at all other times from September 2012 throughpresent. 
(Record citations omitted.) Substantial evidence thus supported 
FOF 48 that "U.S. Bank (through its servicing agent SPS) had possession of the original duly indorsed Note and Allonge at the time this action was commenced on October 20, 2014." 
Further testimony by U.S. Bank's counsel Lansen Leu and 
forensic document examiner Kathleen Nicolaides established that U.S. Bank maintained possession of the Original Note and Allonge through trial. At trial, the Original Note and Allonge were authenticated and admitted into evidence as Exhibit P-90. The Circuit Court thus concluded in COLs 25 and 27, as follows: 
25. The documentary evidence and witness testimony
presented by U.S. Bank at trial clearly established by more
than a preponderance of the evidence that U.S. Bank hadcontinuous actual or constructive possession (through SPS,the Leu Firm and Nicolaides) of the Original Note andAllonge from September 2012 through trial, including onOctober 20, 2014 when the Complaint was filed. 
. . . . 
27. U.S. Bank clearly established by more than a
preponderance of the evidence that it has standing, and wasentitled to bring the lawsuit at the time the Complaint wasfiled. 
5  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
These mixed determinations of fact and law are 
supported by substantial evidence in the record and are not 
clearly erroneous. See Verhagen, 149 Hawai# i at 327-28, 489 P.3d 
at 431-32. 
Chun cites no contrary evidence or offers any 
persuasive explanation as to why these determinations are clearly erroneous. 
Rather, she argues generally that: (1) "Chun does not 
have a contract binding her with . . . U.S. Bank, or stranger and non-party SPS"; (2) "[U.S. Bank's] complaint . . . provides no admissible evidence of a possession of Chun's note or mortgage at case commencement"; (3) "[U.S. Bank] provides no evidence of actual damages incurred by Chun [sic] to entitle [U.S. Bank] to a trial or invoke any of the remedial powers of the courts"; and (4) "[U.S. Bank's] witnesses bringing forth statements on behalf of Accredited Homelenders [sic] records with no evidence that they are legitimately entitled to speak on behalf of Accredited nor is there any evidence that accredited assigned the Note to any of these alleged entities." (Capitalization altered.) 
Chun's first and fourth arguments miss the point. U.S. 
Bank submitted substantial evidence that it possessed the Note and Allonge at the time the complaint was filed through trial. As the holder of the Note, U.S. Bank was entitled to enforce it as against Chun. 
And Chun's second argument fails in light of 
the substantial evidence supporting U.S. Bank's possession of the Note during the relevant period, to which Chun did not object at trial. As to Chun's third argument, the Circuit Court found in FOF 50, which Chun does not contest and which substantial evidence supports, that Chun has not made a payment on the Loan since October 15, 2009. 
In any event, based on our review of the record, we 
conclude that substantial evidence also supports FOFs 9 through 17,
4/ which are part of a series of FOFs in which the Circuit 
Court found: (i) Chun executed the Note and Mortgage originated by Accredited and agreed to make monthly payments on the Loan 
4/  Chun contests only FOFs 9 through 17. Any challenge to the
remaining FOFs is waived. See Okada Trucking, 97 Hawai #i at 458, 40 P.3d at
81; Hawai #i Rule of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 28(b)(7). 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
(FOFs 3-7); (ii) Chun, in executing the Mortgage, agreed that the 
Note "c[ould] be sold one or more times without prior notice to [her]" and that the servicer of the Loan could change (FOF 8); (iii) the Loan was conveyed to U.S. Bank in 2007 (FOFs 9-11); (iv) the Mortgage ("[t]ogether with the [N]ote") was assigned to U.S. Bank (FOF 14); and (v) effective August 16, 2012 (and with notice to Chun), the servicing of the Loan was transferred to SPS, which "is, and was at all times relevant, the attorney-in-fact and agent for U.S. Bank with respect to the Loan" (FOFs 12-13, 15-18). The testimony and documentary evidence supporting each of these FOFs is cited therein. Chun cites no contrary evidence or offers any persuasive explanation as to why FOFs 9 through 17 are clearly erroneous. We conclude they are not. 
Chun appears to challenge COLs 5 through 43 based on 
U.S. Bank's alleged failure to prove it possessed the Note when the complaint was filed. That argument fails for the reasons previously stated. Chun does not otherwise challenge the Circuit Court's conclusions that her counterclaims fail on alternative grounds. Any such arguments are therefore deemed waived. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). 
For the reasons discussed above, the Judgment entered 
on September 28, 2023, by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
