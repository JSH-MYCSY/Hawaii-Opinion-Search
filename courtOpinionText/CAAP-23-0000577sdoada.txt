APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(FC-S NO. 21-00019 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Appellant Mother (Mother) appeals from the Order 
Terminating Parental Rights entered on September 27, 2023, in the 
Family Court of the First Circuit (
Family Court) in FC-S No. 21-
00091 (TPR Order).1 The TPR Order terminated the parental rights 
of Mother, and the respective fathers to M.O. and H.F. (together, Children), awarded permanent custody of the Children to Appellee 
Department of Human Services (DHS), and approved a permanent plan with the goal of adoption for the Children by the current 
Resource Caregiver (RCG). 
1 The Honorable Brian A. Costa presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Mother contends that (1) the Family Court abused its 
discretion when it took jurisdiction over DHS's petition when 
there was no Chuukese interpreter present for Mother at the first hearing, even though Mother is Micronesian and speaks Chuukese as her first language, and that interpreter services provided during later proceedings were inadequate.  Mother also contends that DHS 
failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that: (2) 
DHS exerted reasonable efforts to reunite the Children with her; (3) Mother is not willing and able to provide the Children with a safe family home, and will not be willing and able to do so in the reasonably foreseeable future, even with the assistance of a service plan; and (4) DHS's permanent plan dated July 6, 2022, is in the best interests of the Children. Mother also challenges certain aspects of the Family Court's November 9, 2023 Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (FOFs/COLs). Mother contests FOFs 
11, 13, 59, 63, 79-81, 89-99, 101, 106-110, 172, 176, 189, 191-
193, 203, 208-209, 213-215, and 217-218 as clearly erroneous and COLs 13-18 as based on erroneous findings. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Mother's contentions as follows: 
(1) Mother argues that the Family Court abused its 
discretion by taking jurisdiction over DHS's petition at the first return hearing because there was no Chuukese interpreter for Mother at that hearing and interpreter services provided during later proceedings were inadequate. 
2  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On November 24, 2020, RCG filed a petition for 
guardianship because Mother had left the Children in her care in 
March 2020, and she had not heard from Mother since. On February 1, 2021, DHS filed a petition for foster custody of M.O., born in 2014, and H.F., born in 2016, after being ordered to do so in separate guardianship proceedings filed by RCG. 
The Family Court held a hearing on DHS's petition for 
foster custody on February 3, 2021, but there was no proof of service made on any of the parents. 
The Family Court found that 
there was reasonable cause to believe that continued emergency foster care was necessary for the Children, appointed a guardian ad litem for the Children, and scheduled a further return hearing for May 24, 2021. 
Mother and the Father of H.F. (Father 2) appeared on 
May 24, 2021, and both were appointed counsel. The father of M.O. (Father 1) was incarcerated in Arizona and had not been 
served. Father 2 stipulated to the award of foster custody of 
H.F. to DHS and the service plan dated February 1, 2021. However, the hearing was continued as to Mother to obtain a Chuukese interpreter for her. 
On June 22, 2021, Mother appeared with court-appointed 
counsel and a Chuukese interpreter, contested the petition for foster custody and the Family Court scheduled trial for August 4, 2021.  After trial on August 4, 2021, and September 27, 2021, the 
Family Court denied DHS's request for foster custody, ordered the 
Children returned to Mother, but granted DHS family supervision 
3   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
over the Children. The Family Court scheduled a review hearing 
for October 12, 2021. 
Mother argues she was prejudiced by the lack of an 
interpreter at the initial hearing, which tainted the entire 
proceedings.  Mother also contends that the interpreter services 
provided during later proceedings were inadequate, and she was 
required to share an interpreter at one hearing. 
Although an interpreter was not present at the first 
return hearing at which Mother appeared, the Family Court continued the hearing as to Mother to obtain an interpreter. Mother does not demonstrate an abuse of discretion or error by the Family Court. 
Mother is correct that at one hearing, on October 12, 
2021, only one Chuukese interpreter was present even though she and Father 1 were in attendance. However, the October 12, 2021 hearing was Father 1's first appearance, and the Family Court ordered the parties back for a further hearing on November 12, 2021, where two interpreters were present on November 12, 2021. Mother fails to demonstrate prejudice or state that she objected to being required to share an interpreter for that one hearing. 
The difficulties with interpreters that were pointed 
out by Mother during later proceedings appear related to challenges inherent in conducting the hearing through Zoom, which arose from Mother having stated that it would be a financial hardship to return in person for the trial.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that 
the Family Court did not abuse its discretion or deny Mother her 
rights by failing to provide adequate Chuukese interpretation. 
(2) Mother challenges FOF 213 and 214, which found 
that DHS made reasonable efforts to reunify the Children with her and gave her every opportunity to succeed in remedying the problems in the home that subjected the Children to substantial risk of harm. Mother argues that Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 587A-27(c) (2018) requires the court to ensure that each term, condition, and consequence of the service plan has been thoroughly explained to, understood by, and agreed to by each member of the child's family whom the authorized agency deems necessary to the success of the service plan."  Mother contends 
that there is no proof in the record that DHS translated the 
service plan for her and that the findings that DHS made reasonable efforts to reunite the Children with her and gave her every opportunity to succeed are clearly erroneous.  Mother 
points to a July 5, 2022 Safe Family Home Report, in which DHS 
acknowledged that it understood DHS was required to "translate the service plan into Chuukese and have Mother state that she understands and then signs the plan OR have an interpreter present and explain the service plan to [Mother] and then have her sign." 
Although there is no service plan translated or signed 
by Mother in the record, the record shows efforts were made by DHS to translate for Mother what was required of her under the service plans. On October 20, 2021, DHS social worker Tracey

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Zhang connected with an interpreter and Mother to explain the 
service plan to Mother with the assistance of the interpreter. When asked if she had any questions, Mother responded no. 
On January 10, 2022, DHS social worker Esera Esera, 
with the assistance of an interpreter, discussed and explained the Family Service Plan dated December 27, 2021. The DHS social worker also explained to Mother that she needed to be consistent in calling DHS every Monday at 10:00 a.m. so that DHS could arrange for an interpreter.  However, Mother phoned in on only 
one Monday and missed calling in three Mondays after that. 
When Mother moved to Louisiana, DHS requested a Home 
Study from Louisiana, and the individual assigned to the request 
indicated that she would look into finding a Chuukese interpreter. Mother testified that she asked Tyler Behavioral Health for an interpreter, but was denied one because they were able to understand what she was saying.  Notwithstanding the lack 
of an interpreter, Mother successfully completed 7 of 7 sessions 
of the Family Skills Building Parenting Class in Louisiana, which suggests that Mother was not prejudiced by the lack of an interpreter in Louisiana. In addition, at the permanency hearing 
on June 7, 2023, the Family Court specifically went over with 
Mother what was required of her under the service plan and added in the requirement that Mother call DHS every Monday at 10:00 a.m., so that DHS could arrange for an interpreter to discuss the case and progress. On this record, Mother fails to demonstrate that the failure to provide her an interpreter at every encounter 
6  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
with her caused her prejudice or made the proceedings 
fundamentally unfair. 
(3) Mother challenges FOF 209 and COLs 13, 14 and 15, 
which support the Family Court's determination that Mother, Father 1 and Father 2 are not willing and able to provide a safe family home for the Children now or in the reasonably foreseeable future, even with the assistance of a service plan. Mother's contention lacks merit because the Children were in emergency foster custody of DHS as of January 27, 2021, entered foster care on March 28, 2021, spent only three months in Mother's care, from September 27, 2021, through December 27, 2021, under CPS supervision, and by the time trial concluded on September 12, 2023, Mother still had not completed the recommended substance abuse treatment or non sex-offender therapy, which had been recommended for her because M.O. reported being sexually abused by male relatives, but Mother did not seek treatment for M.O. Father 1 was still incarcerated, and Father 2 stipulated that he was not able to provide a safe family home. 
In a substance abuse assessment of Mother dated July 
27, 2021, completed by Hina Mauka, Mother admitted to previously using methamphetamine, but claimed she stopped in August 2020, when she moved to Louisiana with her boyfriend and their son, leaving the Children in the care of her boyfriend's sister. Mother also admitted past use of marijuana and alcohol, starting at age 16.  Mother had four negative drug screens between July 
27, 2021, and August 19, 2021, was a no-show for seven drug 
screens between September 7, 2021 and November 3, 2021, which 
7   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
were thus presumed positive, had a negative drug screen on 
November 15, 2021, but tested positive for amphetamine and methamphetamine on November 22, 2021. Mother was a no show again on December 2, 2021, and December 8, 2021, before having another negative drug screen on December 20, 2021, but was a no show again on January 31, 2022. Mother had negative drug screens on February 2, 2022, and February 8, 2022, but tested positive for THC on February 28, 2022, and for amphetamine, methamphetamine and THC on March 16, 2022. On March 18, 2022, Hina Mauka 
recommended a residential substance abuse treatment program and 
random drug monitoring upon discharge. However, Mother moved to Seattle in March 2022, without completing services here. 
Mother said she would complete services in Seattle. 
However, Mother was a no show for drug screens scheduled for April 14, 2022, April 29, 2022, May 17, 2022, and June 17, 2022, in Seattle. She then moved to Louisiana, had another assessment done for her by Tyler Behavioral Health Clinic on March 9, 2023, completed only 2 of 16 recommended substance abuse services sessions, tested positive for methamphetamines and marijuana on a drug screen on March 17, 2023, and refused to submit to random drug screens on March 10, 2023, May 1, 2023, May 4, 2023, and May 9, 2023. Because Mother did not comply with substance abuse services recommended for her by Tyler Behavioral Health Clinic, the Louisana Department of Children and Family Services denied DHS's request for a home study on whether it was feasible to place the Children with Mother in Louisiana.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The evidence of multiple positive drug screens and no 
shows for drug screens, Mother's failure to complete drug 
treatment in both Hawai#i and Louisiana, and the length of time 
the Children have been in foster care, are substantial evidence of Mother's inability to provide a safe home for the Children now or in the reasonably foreseeable future, even with the assistance of a service plan. 
(4) Mother challenges the Family Court's determination 
that the permanent plan is in the best interest of the Children, and FOF 218 and COLs 16, 17 and 18, which support that determination.
 Mother argues that the permanent plan proposes 
adoption by RCG but RCG lied when testifying, which calls into question her suitability to parent. Mother also argues that if RCG adopts the Children, it would make visitation between the Children and Mother more difficult. 
Although Mother argues RCG falsely testified she was the 
only one caring for the Children, Mother does not point out where in the record that testimony occurred. The Family Court specifically found in FOF 63P that RCG was credible when she testified that she was not the only one caring for the Children prior to the opening of the case even though RCG "was off on time frames when she testified."  We decline to disturb the Family 
Court's determination of the credibility of the witnesses and the 
weight given to their testimony. See, e.g., Stanford Carr Dev. 
Corp. v. Unity House, Inc.
, 111 Hawai#i 286, 296-97, 141 P.3d 459, 
469-70 (2006). 
9    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
There also was substantial evidence to support the 
Family Court's determination that the Children's adoption by RCG 
and her husband are in the best interest of the Children. The following FOFs are unchallenged by Mother: 
51. The Court summarized its in-camera meeting with [H.F.],
which included [H.F.'s] wish to remain with her current resource
caregiver - [RCG and husband]. 
197. From December 27, 2021 to June 20, 2022, the children
were placed [in] a general licensed home. Unfortunately, [H.F.] haddisruptive behaviors, and demanded more attention than [the] [RCG]could provide. 
198. On June 20, 2022, the Children were placed back in the
home of [RCG] who had filed the original petition for legalguardianship. The Children were already familiar with [RCG], andthe Children appeared comfortable in her home with a sense of trustand security. 
202. [RCG] is familiar with the Children having been the
Children's caregiver before this matter started when she petitionedfor legal guardianship. [RCG] is married to [husband] and they areboth committed to providing consistent and permanent care for theChildren. The long-term stability of adoption by [them] is in theChildren's best interest. Furthermore, [RCG] credibly testifiedthat she is willing to maintain contact with Mother after adoption. 
Steven Choy, Ph.D., the Children's therapist since June 
2021, testified that permanency for the Children is important 
because the longer it takes to decide where children will live, it significantly increases psychological problems, and Mother was being very inconsistent in her contacts with the Children and making changes necessary to reunify with the Children. DHS Supervisor Elizabeth Saga-Petai, also testified that Mother's inconsistent parenting and frequent absences were negatively affecting the Children, and the permanent plan, with the goal of adoption, would provide the Children stability. The Children's GAL also was in favor of terminating parental rights so that the Children could be adopted by RCG, because the children were in foster care for over two years, had been with RCG continuously for 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
over a year, and granting them permanency as quickly as possible 
would be in their best interest. The Family Court's findings and conclusion that the goal of the permanent plan of eventual adoption of the Children by RCG and her husband is in the best interest of the Children, FOF 218 and COL 16, 17, and 18, are supported by substantial evidence and are not clearly erroneous. 
Mother contests FOFs 11, 13, 59, 63, 79-81, 89-99, 101, 
106-110, 172, 176, 189, 191-193, 203, 208-209, 213-215, 217-218, as unsupported by the evidence, and challenges COLs 13-18 as based on erroneous findings, but does not present argument beyond what has already been discussed. Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the challenged FOFs and COLs, which present mixed issues of fact and law, are supported by substantial evidence and are not clearly erroneous. 
For these reasons, the Family Court's September 27, 2023 
TPR Order is affirmed.
