Judgment   (Judgment )  entered   by  the  Circuit   Court  of  the  First

Inc.,  misidentified   as  KHON  2's  [(Nexstar's )]  Motion  to  Dismiss

          October 4, 2023 Order Denying Leave to Amend and Order of 
Dismissal (Order Denying Leave to Amend).2 
Liberally construing Wideman's opening brief, Wideman 
contends that the Circuit Court: (1) erred in entering the Order 
Granting July 8, 2022 MSJ; and (2) erred and abused its 
discretion in entering the Order Denying Leave to Amend. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve this 
appeal as follows: 
Wideman argues that the Circuit Court erred in granting 
Nexstar's July 8, 2022 Motion to Dismiss Complaint, as Amended, 
or in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment on Any and All Claims 
Asserted against KHON 2 (July 8, 2022 MSJ) because: (a) Nexstar 
was not properly named in the complaint, (b) Nexstar failed to 
submit its proposed order within ten days of the Circuit Court 
announcing its decision, (c) the Circuit Court erred in 
determining that Nexstar did not defame him, (d) the Circuit 
Court misapplied the doctrine of res judicata , and (e) the 
Circuit Court erred in its determination that Wideman's claims 
were time barred. 
Wideman further argues that the Circuit Court abused 
its discretion when it denied him leave to amend the complaint 
because he was diligently attempting to serve Defendants and to 
amend his claims and there was no prior notice given of the 
court's intent to dismiss.

July 8, 2022 MSJ and the Order Denying Leave to Amend.

          If  a  party  misnamed  in  a  complaint  is  served  and 
appears,  the  court  has  jurisdiction  over  the  improperly  named 
party.   Kajiya  v.  Dep't  of  Water  Supply,  2  Haw.  App.  221,  223, 
629  P.2d  635,  638  (1981)  (misnaming  the  Board  of  Water  Supply  as 
the  Department  of  Water  Supply  did  not  render  the  summons 
insufficient)  (citations  omitted).   Because  Nexstar  appeared  when 
it  filed  the  July  8,  2022  MSJ,  the  Circuit  Court  had  jurisdiction 
over  Nexstar  and  to  decide  the  July  8,  2022  MSJ. 
The fact that the order granting Nexstar's July 8, 2022 
MSJ was entered more than ten days following the announcement of 
the Circuit Court's ruling did not void the order. Rhoads v. 
Okamura , 98 Hawai i 407, 410, 49 P.3d 373, 376 (2002) 
(recognizing that Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of 
Hawaii Rule 23 is a procedural provision to expedite the court's 
business, and failure to submit a judgment within ten days of an 
order granting motion for summary judgment did not void the 
judgment), overruled on
 other grounds by Alford v. City & Cnty. 
of Honolulu , 109 Hawai i  14, 23,  122 P.3d 809, 818 (2005). 
With the
 July 8, 2022 MSJ, Nexstar submitted scripts of 
the broadcasts it ran in 2012 that mentioned Wideman. The 
scripts say that Wideman's ex-wife has been missing since May 13, 
2012, police were conducting an investigation into her 
disappearance, Wideman is not a suspect in his ex-wife's 
disappearance, and Wideman is cooperating with the investigation 
but he was arrested on a parole violation. 
Wideman did not submit any opposition to the July 8, 
2022 MSJ. Wideman does not point to any fact that would 
establish that any of the statements Nexstar made about him in

   its 2012 broadcasts were untrue. Truth is a defense to 
defamation. Wilson v. Freitas , 121 Hawai i 120, 128, 214  P.3d 
1110, 1118 (App. 2009) (citing Gonsalves v. Nissan Motor Corp. in 
Haw., Ltd., 100 Hawai i 149, 173, 58  P.3d 1196, 1220 (2002)). We 
conclude that the Circuit Court did not err in determining that 
there was no evidence of defamation. 
Res judicata , or claim preclusion, prohibits a party 
from relitigating a previously adjudicated cause of action. 
Eastern Sav. Bank, FSB v. Esteban , 129 Hawai i 154, 158,  296 P.3d 
1062, 1066 (2013) (citing Bremer v. Weeks, 104 Hawai i 43, 54,  85 
P.3d 150, 161 (2004)). "[R]es judicata precludes not only the 
relitigation of claims or defense that were litigated in a 
previous lawsuit, but also of all claims and defenses that might 
have been properly litigated, but were not litigated or decided." 
Id. at 159, 296 P.3d at 1067 (citing Restatement (Second) of 
Judgments , §§ 18 & 22 (A.L.I. 1982)). 
In
 Wideman's complaint, as amended on July 18, 2022 
(Amended Complaint ), Wideman alleged that he was a Hawai i State  
prisoner serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole. 
The Amended Complaint further alleged that on May 18, 2012, while 
on parole, Wideman was arrested for allegedly failing to notify 
his parole officer regarding three separate contacts he had with 
law enforcement between July 26, 2011, and May 18, 2012, and his 
parole was revoked following a July 16, 2012 parole revocation 
hearing. It further alleged that Nexstar wrongfully broadcasted 
to the public his criminal history and an allegedly unlawful 
parole revocation arrest.

  Wideman made these same allegations in an April 15, 
2020 complaint (USDC Complaint ) that he filed in the United 
States District Court for the District of Hawaii (District 
Court), which the District Court dismissed with prejudice on May 
18, 2020. 
The
 District Court had jurisdiction to decide the 
claims in the April 15, 2020 Complaint, which alleged that 
Wideman's 2012 arrest and parole revocation deprived him of his 
rights under the United States and Hawai i Constitutions  and that 
media companies, including Nexstar, broadcasted allegedly 
defamatory information about him. Federal law, 28 U.S.C. §§ 
1331, 1367(a), grants United States District Courts original 
jurisdiction over all civil actions arising under the 
Constitution and supplemental jurisdiction over related claims. 
Even if the claims in the Amended Complaint differed somewhat 
from those in the USDC Complaint, Wideman presents no discernible 
argument why he would have been unable to litigate such claims in 
the District Court. Therefore, we conclude that the Circuit 
Court did not err in dismissing the Amended Complaint based on 
res judicata . 
Finally, there is no abuse of discretion when a court 
denies leave to amend if amendment would be futile. Off. of 
Hawaiian Affs. v. State,
 110 Hawai i 338, 365, 133 P.3d 767, 794 
(2006). In light of the above, further amendment would have been 
futile. Therefore, we need not reach Wideman's remaining 
assertions of error.

Accordingly,  the  Circuit  Court's  December  26,  2025 
Judgment  is  affirmed.   Wideman's  June  24,  2024  "Motion  for  an 
Expedited  Appeal  or  in  the  Alternative  for  a  Resolution  at  the 
Possible  Earliest"  is  denied.
