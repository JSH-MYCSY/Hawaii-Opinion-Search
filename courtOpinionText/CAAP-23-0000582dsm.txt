ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
(By:  Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that Defendant-
Appellant Nicholas Abel ( Abel) filed a self-represented appeal1
from the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit's: (1) January 20,
2021 Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence entered in
5CPC-19-0000194, (2) January 20, 2021 Judgment of Conviction and
Probation Sentence entered in 5CPC-19-0000245, and (3) February
22, 2022 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence entered in 5FFC-21-
0000052 (collectively, Judgments ).2

counsel, Matthew Mannisto, remains his counsel of record.

of resentencing entered September 13, 2023, in 5CPC-19-0000194 and 5CPC-19-
