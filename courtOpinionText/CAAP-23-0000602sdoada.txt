 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2023 in 1CPC-22-00012801 by the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit ( circuit court).2 
The  State filed a Felony Information  in October 2022, 
charging  that,  
[Tillman]  did  intentionally or knowingly caus e  bodily 
injury to Gene Spurgeon [complaining witness ( CW)], a 
person who is sixty years of age or older and the age of 
[CW] was  known or reasonably should have been known to 
[Tillman], thereby committing the offense of Assault in the Second Degree, in violation of Section 707 -711(1)(m) of the  
Hawaiʻi  Revised Statutes [( HRS)].   The bodily injury 
alleged in this case is using two hands to shove [CW] in the chest onto the ground. "Bodily injury" means physical 
pain, illness, or any impairment of physical condition.

The jury found Tillman guilty of this charge, and the circuit 
court entered the Judgment of Conviction. 
1   Tillman improperly filed a single notice of appeal,  in CAAP-23-
0000602,  appealing  the Judgment of Conviction entered in 1CP C-22-0001280 and 
the Resentencing Order entered in a separate circuit court case, 1CPC -20-
0000176.   Notwithstanding this procedural defect, we herein exercise this 
court's discretion  to address the points of error  raised by Tillman  in this 
timely filed appeal.   See  Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 3(a) 
("Failure of an appellant to take any step other than the timely filing of a 
notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground 
only for such action as the appellate court deems appropriate[.]") ; see also  
State v. Graybeard, 93 Hawai ‛i 513,  518,  6 P.3d 385, 390  (App. 2000) ("[O]ur 
appellate courts have ignored formal jurisdictional defects that are due to 
the derelictions of a criminal defendant's attorney." )  (citations omitted).  
2 The Honorable Kevin A. Souza presided over 1CPC-20-0000176 and 
1CPC-22-0001280. 
3 HRS § 707-711(1)(m) (Supp. 2021) provides, in relevant part, 
(1) A person commits the offense of assault in the second 
degree if the person : 
 . . . . 
(m) Intentionally or knowingly causes bodily injury to a 
person who is sixty years of age or older and the age of 
the injured person is known or reasonably should be known 
to the person causing the injury [.]

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Following Tillman's conviction in 1CPC-22-0001280, the 
State moved for revocation of Tillman's probation in 1CP C-20-
0000176. The State argued that Tillman violated the terms and 
conditions of his probation by committing the offense for which 
he was convicted in 1CPC-22-0001280. The circuit court granted 
the motion on this basis and entered the Resentencing Order. 
On appeal, Tillman raises the following points of 
error: (1) the prosecutor committed "harmful misconduct" during 
closing argument and by "eliciting and introducing inadmissible 
hearsay evidence" during trial; (2) the circuit court "committed 
plain error in allowing inadmissible hearsay evidence into 
evidence in violation of [Tillman's] constitutional right to 
confrontation"; (3) Tillman's trial counsel violated his 
constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel; and (4) 
the circuit court "erred in utilizing Tillman's acquitted 
conduct in sentencing and resentencing him to open terms of 
imprisonment."4 Tillman also makes an additional argument, not 
properly set forth as a point of error, that setting aside 
Tillman's conviction in 1CPC -22-0001280 would void the 
revocation of his probation in 1CPC -20-0000176 because his 
conviction was the sole basis for his probation revocation. 
4 While the State conceded error on point (4), it is not necessary 
to reach the issue in light of our resolution of this appeal.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon careful review of the record, briefs,  and 
relevant legal authorities, and having given due consideration 
to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, 
we resolve  Tillman's  first contention, regarding prosecutorial 
misconduct, which is dispositive,  as follows.  
Tillman contends that the prosecutor committed 
misconduct during closing argument by "characterizing [Tillman] 
as a 'mean,' 'nasty,' 'cruel' person, who she compared to a 
'bully'" because these characterizations had "the sole purpose 
of igniting and inflaming the passions and prejudices of the 
jury against Tillman." Tillman did not object at trial , and we 
therefore review the prosecutor's alleged misconduct for plain 
error. "Because prosecutorial misconduct impacts the 
fundamental right to a fair trial, there is no difference 
between the plain error and harmless beyond a reasonable doubt 
standard s of review." State v. Hirata , 152 Hawai‛i 27, 31, 520 
P.3d 225, 229 (2022) (citation omitted) . 
The record evidence includes conflicting testimony 
that Tillman was, by one account, the aggressor, and, by 
another, acting in self-defense. The CW testified that Tillman 
was "[v]ery hostile and aggressive," and that Tillman's actions 
were unprovoked. Tillman testified that he "nudged" the CW 
because the CW was "drunk in [Tillman's] face," that the CW 
"swung at [ Tillman]" with his fist and "made contact with 
4   
   
  
     
 
    
     
 
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
[Tillman's ] right shoulder ," and that Tillman's intent in 
"nudging" the CW "was to stop [the CW] from harming [Tillman] 
again or attempting to harm [Tillman] again." 
Two  surveillance videos  —  Exhibits 7 and 8  —  were 
introduced into evidence. The videos depict the incident from 
two different viewpoints, and were referenced  throughout trial,  
including  by the prosecutor during closing argument.   Exhibit 7  
shows  Tillman using his hands to make  contact with the CW's 
upper body, causing the CW to stumble backwards  through the  
Maunakea Marketplace  entrance area. Exhibit 8 shows  the CW 
stumbling backwards out of the entrance  area  and falling on the 
sidewalk. The CW is then seen getting up, approaching  the 
entrance,  pausing at the entrance for a brief time  to talk with 
Tillman (who appears briefly in camera view),  and then walking 
down the sidewalk away from the store  and Tillman on his own 
volition.  
This court has previously observed that "to bully 
someone" means "to intimidate by threats or to domineer." 
State v. Faatea , No. CAAP -17-0000357, 2018 WL 3199236, at *4 
(Haw. App. June 29, 2018) (SDO) (cleaned up) (quoting Webster's 
Third International Dictionary 295 (1961) ). On this record, we 
cannot conclude that the evidence presented at trial allowed for 
a reasonable inference that Tillman was acting like a "bully," 
or that he was "mean," "nasty," or "cruel" to the CW. Tillman's 
5   
  
   
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
actions do not automatically give rise to the inference that 
Tillman meant to "intimidate by threats" or "to domineer" the 
CW. See State v. Basham , 132 Hawai‛i 97, 112, 319 P.3d 1 105, 
1120 (2014) ("Whether the evidence bears a logical and proximate 
connection to the point the prosecutor wishes to prove is 
perhaps the most obvious consideration in determining whether an 
inference is reasonable." ) (cleaned up) . 
The words that the prosecutor used in closing argument 
to describe Tillman carried  connotations beyond what was 
objectively supported by the evidence presented at trial. We  
therefore conclude that the prosecutor's  personal  
characterization of Tillman  as "mean," "nasty," "cruel," and  
comparing  Tillman to  "a bully" constituted, whether intended or 
not,  an improper appeal  to the passions of the jury. See  
State  v. Underwood, 142 Hawai‛i 317, 326, 418 P.3d 658, 667 
(2018) ("[P]rosecutors, like all attorneys appearing before a 
tribunal, are bound to refrain from expressing their personal 
views as to a defendant's guilt or credibility of witnesses.")  
(cleaned up); State v. Williams, 149 Hawai ‛i 381,  394,  491 P.3d 
592, 605  (2021) ("Even when the statements are not calculated to 
inflame the passions or prejudices of the jury, when the likely result is that the jury will be inflamed, the statements are 
prejudicial.")  (citation omitted).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We further conclude that the prosecutor's misconduct 
was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt , and that the 
Judgment of Conviction must therefore be vacated . See Hirata, 
152 Hawaiʻi at 31, 520 P.3d at 229 ("After considering the nature 
of the prosecuting attorney's conduct, promptness or lack of a 
curative instruction, and strength or weakness of the evidence 
against the defendant, a reviewing court will vacate a 
conviction if there is a reasonable possibility that the conduct 
might have affected the trial's outcome." ) (citation omitted ). 
The surveillance videos, which are the only neutral, 
objective evidence in the record, do not depict the 
circumstances leading up to Tillman's physical contact with the 
CW. Tillman and the CW gave conflicting testimony, in which 
both claimed that the other was the aggressor and instigator of 
the altercation. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude 
that there was no reasonable possibility that the prosecutor's 
misconduct might have affected the trial's outcome. Therefore, 
the Judgment of Conviction must be vacated and the case remanded 
for a new trial. 
Given our conclusion as to the prosecutor's misconduct 
during closing argument , we decline to reach Tillman's 
contentions as to hearsay , ineffective assistance of counsel , 
and the circuit court's abuse of discretion in imposing his 
sentence in 1CPC -22-0001280.

Because we vacate Tillman's Judgment of C onviction in 
1CPC-22-0001280, we also vacate the circuit court's Resentencing 
Order in 1CPC-20-0000176 that revoked Tillman's probation on the 
basis of his conviction in 1CPC-22-0001280. 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the Judgment of 
Conviction and remand for a new trial in 1CPC -22-0001280. We 
vacate the Resentencing Order in 1CPC-20-0000176 and remand for 
further proceedings consistent with this summary disposition 
order.
