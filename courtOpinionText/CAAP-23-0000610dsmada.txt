IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
BRONSON  JONES  and  CHASSIDIE  JONES, 
Plaintiffs-Appellees,  v. 
2  BROS.  SERVICES,  LLC,  dba  IZZY  TOWS  IT; 
KAINOA  JUSTIN  AH  SING;  and  ISRAEL  ALVAREZ, 
Defendants-Appellants 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL  NO.  1CCV-21-0001231) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR
 LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, self-represented Defendants-
Appellants Kainoa Justin Ah Sing and Israel Alvarez appeal from 
the October 4, 2023 "Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for ** 
Summary Judgment Against Defendants Kainoa Ahsing [sic] and 
Israel Alvarez" (October 4, 2023 Order) entered in the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit in 1CCV-21-0001231. The court lacks 
appellate jurisdiction because the circuit court has not entered 
a final, appealable order or judgment, see Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016); Hawai i Rules of  Civil 
Procedure Rules 54(b), 58; Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & 
Wright, 76 Hawai i  115, 119,  869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994), and the 
October 4, 2023 Order is not independently appealable under the 
collateral-order or Forgay1 doctrines, nor has the circuit court 
granted leave for interlocutory appeal under HRS ยง 641-1(b). See 
Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai i 249, 253,  369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) 
1 Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848).

Associate Judge NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(setting  forth  the  requirements  for  appealability  under  the 
collateral-order  doctrine  and  the  Forgay  doctrine);  HRS  ยง  641-
1(b)  (specifying  requirements  for  leave  to  file  interlocutory 
appeal).   
Therefore,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  the  appeal  is 
dismissed  for  lack  of  appellate  jurisdiction. 
DATED:   Honolulu,  Hawai i,  January  11,  2024.
