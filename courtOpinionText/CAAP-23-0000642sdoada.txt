SAMUEL  COOPER,  JR.,  Petitioner-Appellant,  v. 
STATE  OF  HAWAI I,  Respondent-Appellee  
APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
(CASE  NO.  1CPN-22-0000028) 
SUMMARY  DISPOSITION  ORDER 
(By:   Leonard,   Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka   and  Wadsworth,   JJ.) 
Petitioner-Appellant   Samuel  Cooper,   Jr.  (Cooper),  self-
represented,   appeals   from  the  October   3,  2023  Order  Denying
 
Petition   to  Vacate,   Set  Aside,  or  Correct   Judgment   or  to  Release 
Petitioner  from  Custody  (Order  Denying  Fifth  Rule  40  Petition ). 1
Cooper  does  not  identify  points  of  error  on  appeal,  as 
such.   Nonetheless,  we  address  Cooper's  argument   to  the  extent 
that  we  are  able  to  discern  it.   On  October  18,  2022,  Cooper 
filed  a  Petition  for  Post-Conviction  Relief  pursuant  to  Hawai i  
Rules  of  Penal   Procedure  (HRPP)  Rule  40  (Fifth  Rule  40  Petition ) 
raising  a  single  ground  for  relief:   that  the  prosecutor  used 
information  charging  in  the  underlying  criminal  case.   Cooper 
seeks  relief  from  the  Circuit  Court's  denial  of  the  Fifth  Rule  40 
Petition. 
The underlying
 criminal case stemmed from a 1999 
murder. On September 3, 1999, Cooper was charged by way of 
complaint with Murder in the Second Degree, in violation of 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 707-701.5 (2014), convicted after a

jury trial, and sentenced to life imprisonment with the 
possibility of parole. 
Cooper appears to argue, as he argued in various 
submissions to the Circuit Court, that he was entitled to a grand 
jury indictment based on State v. Obrero, 151 Hawai i 472, 517 
P.3d 755 (2022). 
Upon careful
 review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Cooper's 
appeal as follows: 
The Hawai i Supreme  Court has held that "Obrero
 applies 
to cases that were pending trial before the decision. Obrero 
does not apply retroactively to defendants who pled out or to 
defendants convicted after a trial." State v. Bautista , 153 
Hawai i  284, 289,  535 P.3d 1029, 1034 (2023). The supreme court 
further held that defendants challenging a charging instrument's 
validity for the first time in an HRPP Rule 40 petition are 
foreclosed from having their trial convictions overturned 
pursuant to Obrero. Id.
 Accordingly, we conclude that Cooper is 
not entitled to relief. 
Therefore, the Circuit Court's October 3, 2023 Order 
Denying Fifth Rule 40 Petition is affirmed. In addition, 
Cooper's Motion for Immediate Decision and Relief, filed on 
November 27, 2024, is hereby denied.
