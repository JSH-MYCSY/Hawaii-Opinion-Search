  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appeal (Wilmington) filed on June 6, 2025, and having received 
no timely response in opposition from Defendant/Cross-claimant-
Appellant Thomas Moses Johnson III (Johnson), and having 
reviewed the papers in support and the record, it appears that: 
1. After Johnson filed an appeal of the October 2, 
2023 order granting Wilmington's motion for summary judgment and interlocutory decree of foreclosure [1CCV-19-0002277 Dkt. 340], 
and the October 18, 2023 judgment [id. Dkt 348], he did not post 
a supersedeas bond or obtain a stay of proceedings before the 
Circuit Court. 
2. On February 10, 2025, the Circuit Court entered 
an Order Approving Commissioner's Report and Granting Amended 
Second Renewed Motion for Confirmation of Foreclosure Sale, 
Allowance of Costs and Fees, Distribution of Proceeds, Directing Conveyance and for Writ of Possession/Ejectments, Filed Herein 
on November 5, 2024 (Order Confirming Foreclosure Sale). In the 
Order Confirming Foreclosure Sale, the Circuit Court determined 
that Zhuping Ye (Ye) or his nominee is a good faith purchaser of 
the subject property. 
3. On April 16, 2025, Ye recorded in Land Court a 
Commissioner's Deed conveying the subject property to Ye and his wife.

4. This court takes judicial notice of the Order 
Confirming Foreclosure Sale and the Commissioner's Deed. Hawaiʻi 
Rules of Evidence Rule 201; State v. Abdon, 137 Hawai
ʻi 19, 26, 
364 P.3d 917, 924 (2016); Wilmington Sav. Fund Soc'y v. Mosier, 
No. CAAP-22-0000382, 2024 WL 3648929 at *2 (Haw. App. Aug. 5, 
2024). 
5. Because no effective relief can be granted, 
Johnson's appeal is dismissed as moot. Wilmington Sav. Fund
Soc'y, FSB v. Domingo, 155 Hawaiʻ i 1, 9-10, 556 P.3d 347, 355-56 
(2024). 
Therefore, IT IS ORDERED that the Motion for Order 
Dismissing Appeal is granted and the appeal is dismissed as 
moot. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, June 25, 2025.
