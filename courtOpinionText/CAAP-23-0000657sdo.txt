2 CPBI is the current owner of a project development on 
Kauaʻi (the Project).  On January 24, 2007, the Kauaʻ i County 
Planning Commission issued a Special Management Area Use Permit 
SMA(U)-2006-5 (SMA), Project Development Use Permit PDU-2006-7, 
and a Class IV Zoning Permit Z-IV-2006-10 (collectively, the 
Permits) to the Project's former owner.2  It is undisputed that 
the Kauaʻ i County  Code (KCC) did not impose a "workforce housing" 
requirement at the time the Permits were issued.3   
Kauaʻi County adopted KCC chapter 7A on December 10, 
2007.  Chapter 7A made workforce housing an exaction under 
certain circumstances.  Despite the Project receiving the 
Permits prior to the adoption of KCC chapter 7A, in July 2022, 
the Housing Agency determined that "as a project requiring 
building permits," the Project "must satisfy [chapter 7A] 
workforce housing requirements."  CPBI appealed, and the Housing 
Agency upheld its initial decision.  CPBI then appealed the 
Housing Agency's decision to the circuit court, and the circuit 
 
2  CPBI acquired the Project after the P ermits were issued.  The 
Project's start date was delayed due to litigation, and Kauaʻ i County waived  
the two- year deadline for the Project's SMA permit and acknowledged  that the 
five-year construction period requirement in the Permits would not start 
until building permits are obtained.   The record reflects that, as of the 
date of the circuit court's Order, construction had not yet commenced on the 
Project, and that neither the previous owners nor CPBI have pulled building 
permits for the Project.  
 
3  The record reflects that, although there was no workforce housing 
requirement when the Permits were issued, Condition No. 18 of the Permits 
specifies that the Project developer will provide employee housing for no 
fewer than three employees.

3 court entered its Order and Final Judgment vacating the Housing 
Agency's decision.   
This secondary appeal followed.  The Housing Agency 
raises four points of error, contending that the circuit court 
erred when it ruled that: (1) "the [Housing Agency's] workforce 
housing requirement violated KCC § 7A-1.5"; (2) "[KCC] [c]hapter 
7A was not intended to be applied to projects that had 
previously obtained zoning permits"; (3) "the Deputy Planning Director had authority to waive [KCC] [c]hapter 7A workforce 
housing requirements for the [P]roject"; and (4) "the Housing 
Agency was estopped from assessing a workforce housing 
requirement." 
We review secondary appeals de novo, and apply the 
standards set forth in Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91-14(g) 
(2012 & Supp. 2016) to determine whether the circuit court's 
determinations were right or wrong.  Flores v. Bd. of Land & 
Nat. Res., 143 Hawaiʻ i 114, 120, 424 P.3d 469, 475 (2018) 
(citations omitted).   
HRS § 91-14, entitled "Judicial review of contested 
cases," provides in relevant part: 
(g) Upon review of the record, the court may affirm the 
decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions 
for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the 
decision and order if the substantial rights of the 
petitioners may have been prejudiced because the 
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders 
are: 
 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
4  
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of 
the agency; 
 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; 
 
(4) Affected by other error of law; 
 
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or 
 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of 
discretion. 
 
HRS § 91-14(g).  
 
"Under HRS § 91-14(g), an agency's conclusions of law 
are reviewable under subsections (1), (2), and (4); questions 
regarding procedural defects under subsection (3); findings of 
fact under subsection (5); and an agency's exercise of 
discretion under subsection (6)."  United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, 
Loc. 646 v. Hanneman, 106 Hawaiʻ i 359, 363, 105 P.3d 236, 240 
(2005) (cleaned up). 
Upon careful review of the record, briefs, and 
relevant legal authorities, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, 
we first address the Housing Agency's contention that the 
Project is subject to KCC chapter 7A.   
"When interpreting a municipal ordinance, we apply the 
same rules of construction that we apply to statutes."  West 
Maui Resort Partners LP v. Cnty. of Maui, 154 Hawaiʻ i 121, 131, 
547 P.3d 454, 464 (2024) (quoting Ocean Resort Villas Vacation 
Owners Ass'n v. Cnty. of Maui, 147 Hawaiʻ i 544, 553, 465 P.3d NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
5 991, 1000 (2020)).  "[W]here the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and 
obvious meaning."  Id. at 132, 547 P.3d at 465.  Moreover, this 
language "must be read in the context of the entire ordinance and construed in a manner consistent with the purposes of the 
ordinance."  Save Diamond Head Waters LLC v. Hans Hedemann Surf, 
Inc., 121 Hawaiʻ i 16, 25, 211 P.3d 74, 83 (2009) (citation 
omitted).   
KCC chapter 7A provides that the workforce housing 
requirement applies to, as relevant here: 
(c) Projects with other approvals granted by the County 
administration, including: 
 
. . . .  
 (2) Zoning or building permits for the development or 
redevelopment of land or buildings on a lot of record 
in any residential, resort, or commercial district 
for the construction of or conversion into more than 
10 residential dwelling units or time share units, or more than 20 hotel rooms.   
 
KCC § 7A-1.4.1(c)(2) (emphasis added). 
KCC § 7A-1.5 governs the time in which the Housing 
Agency must make a workforce housing assessment, and instructs 
that, 
(a) The workforce housing assessment for any project subject to 
this Chapter shall be resolved with the Housing Agency 
prior to final subdivision approval or zoning permit 
approval, whichever occurs first, or if neither is 
applicable to the project, prior to building permit 
application. 
 
(b) The workforce housing assessment for any project subject to 
this Chapter shall be assessed once per project, except 
that an additional workforce housing assessment may be 
applicable to a project, after initial assessment, when NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
6 increased residential or resort density is subsequently 
granted by the County. 
 
KCC § 7A-1.5(a), (b) (emphasis added).   
Pursuant to its plain language, KCC § 7A-1.5(a) 
instructs that the Housing Agency shall "resolve[]" a workforce 
housing assessment for "any project subject to this Chapter 
. . . prior to final subdivision approval or zoning permit 
approval, whichever occurs first."  The record reflects that the Project was granted final zoning permit approval in January 
2007.  Thus, the Housing Agency's deadline for resolving a 
workforce housing assessment had expired in January 2007, which 
was prior to the adoption of KCC chapter 7A in December 2007. 
There is nothing in the language of KCC chapter 7A 
that indicates the drafters' intent that the provisions 
governing workforce housing assessments should have 
retrospective application.  We therefore conclude that the 
circuit court was not wrong in determining that KCC chapter 7A's 
workforce housing requirement does not apply to the Project.  
See In re Medeiros Testamentary Tr. & Life Ins. Tr., 105 Hawaiʻ i 
284, 293, 96 P.3d 1098, 1107 (2004) ("The common law rule 
disfavors retroactive application of laws.  This rule is 
codified in HRS § 1-3 (1993), which provides that '[n]o law has 
any retrospective operation, unless otherwise expressed or 
obviously intended.'") (citation omitted).  In light of this NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
7 conclusion, we need not reach the Housing Agency's remaining 
points of error. 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Order and 
Final Judgment.
