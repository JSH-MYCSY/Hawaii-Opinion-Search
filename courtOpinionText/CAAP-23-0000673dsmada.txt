Appellate  Procedure  (HRAP)  Rule  42(b),  and  each  party  shall  bear 
their  own  attorneys'  fees  and  costs  on  appeal;  (3)  the 
stipulation  is  dated  and  signed  by  counsel  U.S.  Bank  and  Title 
Guaranty,  but  not  any  other  parties  to  the  appeal;  (4)  no  party 
filed  a  response  to  the  stipulation;  (5)  the  stipulation  fails  to 
demonstrate  the  parties  that  did  not  sign  the  stipulation  are 
nominal  appellees  who  need  not  sign  the  stipulation;  and  (6) 
nonetheless,  the  court  will  construe  the  stipulation  as  U.S. 
Bank's  motion  to  dismiss  the  appeal,  under  HRAP  Rule  42(b),  and 
grant  the  requested  relief. 1 
Therefore,
  IT  IS  HEREBY   ORDERED  that  the  Notice  of 
Stipulation  for  Dismissal  of  Appeal,  construed  as  a  motion  to 
dismiss  the  appeal,  is  granted  and  the  appeal  is  dismissed.   The 
parties  shall  bear  their  own  attorneys'  fees  and  costs  on  appeal. 
DATED:   Honolulu,  Hawai i ,  February  27,  2024.

others.
