NO.  CAAP-23-0000680 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
STATE  OF  HAWAI I,  Plaintiff-Appellant,  v. 
UTTARA  DASI  LANGE,  Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  SECOND  CIRCUIT 
(CASE  NO.  2CPC-23-0000386) 
ORDER  GRANTING  MOTION  TO  DISMISS  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,   Acting  Chief  Judge,  Nakasone   and  McCullen,   JJ.) 
Upon
 consideration of Defendant-Appellee Uttara Dasi 
Lange's (Lange) January 24, 2024 Motion to Dismiss Appeal, the 
papers in support and in opposition, and the record, it appears 
that: 
(1) On October 5, 2023, the Circuit Court of the Second 
Circuit (Circuit Court) entered a "Proposed Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law for [Lange]'s Motion to Dismiss" (Dismissal 
Order) dismissing the charges in the underlying case; 
(2) On October 20, 2023, the Circuit Court entered an 
"Amended Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law for [Lange]'s 
Motion to Dismiss" (Amended Dismissal Order), with the only 
change being the inclusion of case number references in the 
findings of fact; 
(3) On
 November 16, 2023, Plaintiff-Appellant State of 
Hawai i (State)  filed a notice of appeal from the Amended 
Dismissal Order, pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 641-13(1) 
(2016); 
(4) Lange seeks dismissal of the appeal for lack of 
jurisdiction, arguing that the time to appeal ran from entry of

the Dismissal Order, and therefore, the notice of appeal was not 
timely filed in accordance with Hawai i  Rules of  Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(b)(1); 
(5) Because the order was not "amended in a material 
and substantial respect," the 30-day deadline to appeal under 
HRAP Rule 4(b)(1) ran from entry of the Dismissal Order, not the 
Amended Dismissal Order, see State v. Mainaaupo , 117 Hawai i 235, 
246
 n.6, 178 P.3d 1, 12 n.6 (2008) (citation omitted); Weisenberg 
v. University of Hawai i, 138 Hawai i 210, 216,  378 P.3d 926, 932 
(2016); thus, the State's appeal is untimely; and 
(6) Compliance with the requirement of timely filing a 
notice of appeal is jurisdictional. Grattafiori v. State, 79 
Hawai i  10, 13,  897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995). 
Therefore,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  the  motion  is 
granted,  and  the  appeal  is  dismissed.

 Honolulu, Hawai i, February 7,  2024.
