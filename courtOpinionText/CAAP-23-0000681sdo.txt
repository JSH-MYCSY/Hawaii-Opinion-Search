PPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
PUNA DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 3DRC-21-0001177) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, and McCullen and Guidry, JJ.) 
This appeal stems from a landlord-tenant dispute in 
which the trial court awarded summary possession to Plaintiff-
Appellee Laverne S. Rodrigues (Rodrigues
). Defendant-Appellant 
Anusuya Shapley (Shapley), self-represented, appeals from the 
Judgment for Possession and the Writ of Possession, both entered 
on August 15, 2023, in the District Court of the Third Circuit, Puna Division (District Court).
1/ 
On May 14, 2021, Rodrigues filed a complaint for 
summary possession of certain real property she owned (theProperty) against Shapley and Defendants-Appellees YMAAS LLC 
(YMAAS) and Allan Yoza (Yoza) (collectively, Tenants). 
Rodrigues alleged that Tenants "have broken" the parties' written 
rental agreement by, among other things, modifying the Property's

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
plumbing, electrical wiring, and physical structure without 
obtaining proper permits under Hawai# i County Code chapters 5A, 
D, and F. 
She further alleged that these actions violated Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 521-51, -52, and -72. 
On November 5, 2021, Shapley, self-represented, filed a 
motion to dismiss the complaint (M
otion to Dismiss), purportedly 
on behalf of both herself and YMAAS. Then, on February 21, 2022, before the Motion to Dismiss was heard, YMAAS, which was then represented by counsel, filed an answer, counterclaim, and demand for jury trial.
2/ 
On February 28, 2022, the District Court "noted [that 
the] demand for jury trial was filed on 02/21/22 and [the] matter will now be pursued under [circuit court case no.] 3CCV-22-54[.]" On October 24, 2022, the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit remanded Rodrigues's summary possession claim to the District Court. 
On December 1, 2022, the District Court dismissed the 
summary possession claim as against Yoza because he had not been served within the required time. 
On January 17, 2023, Rodrigues filed a motion to amend 
the complaint, which was heard and granted by the District Court. Rodrigues filed a First Amended Complaint on March 29, 2023. 
Trial on the summary possession claim was held by the 
District Court on July 14 and August 11, 2023. At the end of trial, the District Court stated, in relevant part: 
I'm ready to rule. I'm going to go ahead and grant the
summary possession based on the credible testimony that I've
heard and the exhibits, reviewing the exhibits and takingjudicial notice of Hawaii County Code Subsection 5, 5(d) and5(e), as well as [Rodrigues's counsel's] two trialmemorandums. 
. . . . 
. . . [Construing HRS §§ 521-51 and 521-69]: If the 
tenant is in immaterial [sic] noncompliance with Section
521-51, the landlord upon learning of any such noncomplianceand after notifying the tenant in writing of thenoncompliance and allowing a specified time not less than

ten days after receipt of notice for the tenant to remedy
the noncompliance, that person may terminate the rentalagreement and bring a summary proceeding for possession ofthe dwelling unit or any other proper proceeding, action, orsuit for possession if the material -- if the tenant is inimmaterial [sic] noncompliance with 521-51(1). 
So I'm finding that the tenant did not comply with the
applicable building and housing laws materially affectingthe health and safety by adding the un-permitted toilets,adding an un-permitted kitchen, dumping gray water into theyard, running sewer pipes over the floor. There was never any cure despite years of ability to do that. 
The rent does not matter in this case. The bills do 
not matter. 
The mold does not matter. There was a material 
breach of the existing contract that was caused by thetenants, Shapley and YMAAS, by doing the renovations withoutthe permits. 
So pursuant to HRS 521-51, 521-69, I'm going to grant
the eviction. Plaintiff is to prepare the order grantingthe summary possession, writ of possession, and judgment forpossession. It will be effective forthwith. 
The Judgment for Possession and the Writ of Possession 
were subsequently entered. 
On appeal, Shapley appears to contend that the District 
Court: (1) lacked jurisdiction because the parties' rental 
agreement "function[ed] as a management agreement with an intent to purchase" and was exempt from the requirements of HRS Chapter 521, the Residential Landlord-Tenant Code; (2) should have dismissed the case after dismissing Yoza because of the court's inability to provide relief; (3) ruled based on "extraneous matters" such as "permitting for property improvements"; (4) ruled based on "inadequate evidence" and Defendants' failure to secure permits, which "falls solely within the province of the property owner"; (5) took Rodrigues's testimony as credible "without sufficient corroborating evidence" and despite her "significant financial interest in the outcome" and her "pattern of dishonesty"; (6) exhibited bias in referring to "past cases and comments from past tenants regarding Defendant's property management style"; and (7) based the judgment on a "misrepresentation" in Rodrigues's trial memorandum.
3/  
3/   Shapley's points of error have been restated and condensed for
clarity. We note that Shapley's opening brief fails to comply in numerous
material respects with Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule
28(b)(4) and (7). In particular, Shapley fails to provide: (1) a "concise

After reviewing the record on appeal and the relevant 
legal authorities, and giving due consideration to the issues 
raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we resolve Shapley's contentions as follows, and affirm. 
(1) Shapley contends that "[t]he nature of the 
agreement, although labeled a 'Rental agreement,' was never intended for lessees to reside on the [P]roperty, instead functioning as a management agreement with an intent to purchase, thus falling outside the jurisdiction of the District Court's summary proceedings under the tenant landlord code." 
Shapley's November 5, 2021 Motion to Dismiss asserted 
in part that the parties' rental agreement reflected the Tenants' intent to purchase the Property and that "some" of the issues in the case "involve title to the [P]roperty." To the extent that Shapley was attempting to raise a defense that involved title to the Property, however, it does not appear that her related declaration met all of the requirements of District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 12.1.

statement of the points of error" (emphasis added), as required by HRAP Rule
28(b)(4); (2) a statement of "where in the record the alleged error[s were]objected to or the manner in which the alleged error[s were] brought to theattention of the court[,]" as required by HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(iii); and (3)"citations to the . . . parts of the record relied on[,]" as required by HRAPRule 28(b)(7). In addition, the argument section is conclusory and oftendifficult to discern. Shapley's "failure to comply with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) isalone sufficient to affirm the circuit court's judgment." Morgan v. Planning
Dep't, Cty. of Kauai, 104 Hawai #i 173, 180, 86 P.3d 982, 989 (2004) (citing
Schefke v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai #i 408, 420, 32 P.3d 52,
64 (2001)). Nevertheless, we have "consistently adhered to the policy ofaffording litigants the opportunity 'to have their cases heard on the merits,where possible.'" Morgan, 104 Hawai #i at 180-81, 86 P.3d at 989-90 (quoting
O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu
, 77 Hawai #i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364
(1994)). We thus address Shapley's arguments to the extent discernible. 
4/ DCRCP Rule 12.1 provides: 
Pleadings . Whenever, in the District Court, in
defense of an action in the nature of an action of trespassor for the summary possession of land, or any other action,the defendant shall seek to interpose a defense to thejurisdiction to the effect that the action is a real action,or one in which the title to real estate is involved, suchdefense shall be asserted by a written answer or writtenmotion, which shall not be received by the court unlessaccompanied by an affidavit of the defendant, setting forththe source, nature and extent of the title claimed bydefendant to the land in question, and such furtherparticulars as shall fully apprise the court of the nature

In any event, Shapley did not establish that there was 
a purchase agreement. In its ruling at the end of trial, the 
District Court stated: "There are two leases in evidence, No. 47, the ten-year lease which ends December 21st of 2027; No. 49 -- Exhibit 49 is a second lease which ends December 21st of 2022." Both documents are entitled "Rental Agreement," identify the "TENANTS" as YMAAS, Yoza and Shapley, and include terms for "RENT" and "OCCUPANCY." With respect to occupancy, both documents indicate a "Fixed Rental Agreement" – Exhibit 47, for a period of ten years, and Exhibit 49 for a period of five years, with an option to renew for an additional five years. Both documents also state: "Tenant intention is to purchase the [P]roperty." The latter statement, however, which does not specify any terms of sale, is not an enforceable agreement. See 
Globalmart, Inc. v. Posec Hawai# i, Inc., No. 28249, 2012 WL 
1650697, at *7 (Haw. App. May 10, 2012) (mem. op.) (agreements to agree are unenforceable). And Shapley points to no evidence in the record that otherwise established that the parties entered into a purchase agreement. 
Shapley also failed to establish that the parties' 
rental agreement was exempt from the requirements of HRS Chapter 521. That chapter "applies to rights, remedies, and obligations of the parties to any residential rental agreement wherever made of a dwelling unit within this State."  HRS § 521-6 (2006) 
(emphasis added). 
Here, both versions of the parties' rental 
agreement (see supra) evidenced a residential rental agreement of a dwelling unit within Hawai# i, and Shapley points to no evidence 
that shows otherwise. Shapley did not establish that any of the exclusions in HRS §521-7 applied – in particular, that she occupied the Property under a "bona fide contract of sale" or as 5/
4/ (...continued)
of defendant's claim. 
5/ Under HRS § 521-8 (2006), "'[r]ental agreement' means all
agreements, written or oral, which establish or modify the terms, conditions,
rules, regulations, or any other provisions concerning the use and occupancyof a dwelling unit and premises"; "'[d]welling unit' means a structure, orpart of a structure, which is used as a home, residence, or sleeping place byone person or by two or more persons maintaining a common household, to theexclusion of all others." 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
"the prospective purchaser after an accepted offer to purchase 
. . . ." §521-7(3), (8) (2006). Shapley argues that she was not intended to reside on the Property, but that would not render HRS Chapter 521 inapplicable, as the rental agreement established terms concerning the use and occupancy of the Property, including Shapley's right to occupy the Property. 
On this record, we conclude that the District Court had 
jurisdiction over Rodrigues's summary possession claim under HRS § 604-5(a) (2016). 
(2) Shapley contends that the District Court should 
have dismissed the case after dismissing Yoza "because of the court[']s inability to provide relief, since the occupants at the property were under leases signed by [him] . . . ." 
Shapley's argument is conclusory, lacks supporting 
legal authority, and relies on factual assertions without supporting references to the record. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(4), (7). To the extent Rodrigues sought summary possession of the Property as against Shapley, she was able to obtain it. To the extent Shapley makes unsupported factual assertions regarding occupants of the Property, we "are not obligated to search the record to crystalize [Shapley's] arguments[.]" Haw. Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 
Hawai#i 438, 469 n.16, 164 P.3d 696, 727 
n.16 (2007) (quoting Kienker v. Bauer, 110 Hawai# i 97, 104 n.12, 
129 P.3d 1125, 1132 n.12 (2006)). In any event, Shapley has not provided a sufficient record for our review of the alleged error, as the only trial transcript she ordered was a partial transcript of her own cross-examination and the District Court's oral ruling at the end of trial. See HRAP Rule 10(b) (making it the appellant's responsibility to include in the record on appeal transcripts of the pertinent oral proceedings conducted by the trial court); Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai# i 225, 230, 
909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) ("The burden is upon appellant in an appeal to show error by reference to matters in the record, and he or she has the responsibility of providing an adequate transcript." (brackets omitted) (quoting Union Bldg. Materials Corp. v. The Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984))). We therefore disregard the asserted error. See 
6   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Tradewinds Hotel, Inc. v. Cochran, 8 Haw. App. 256, 266, 799 P.2d 
60, 67 (1990). 
(3) Shapley contends that the District Court improperly 
ruled based on "extraneous matters, such as permitting for property improvements[,]" which "is not addressed in the lease agreement and thus is not within the jurisdiction of the District Court." 
As explained above, the parties' rental agreement was 
subject to the requirements of HRS Chapter 521. HRS § 521-51(1) (2006) provides that "[e]ach tenant shall at all times during the tenancy . . . [c]omply with all applicable building and housing laws materially affecting health and safety[.]" (Formatting altered.) Based on the evidence presented at trial, the District Court found that "the tenant did not comply with the applicable building and housing laws materially affecting the health and safety by adding the un-permitted toilets, adding an un-permitted kitchen, dumping gray water into the yard, running sewer pipes over the floor." This was not an "extraneous matter" and was not outside the court's jurisdiction. 
(4)-(5) Shapley contends that the District Court ruled 
based on "inadequate evidence" and Defendants' failure to secure permits. She also argues that the District Court took Rodrigues's testimony as credible "without sufficient corroborating evidence" and despite her "significant financial interest in the outcome" and her "pattern of dishonesty." 
Again, Shapley's argument is conclusory, lacks 
supporting legal authority, and relies on factual assertions without supporting references to the record. See HRAP Rule 
28(b)(4), (7). As discussed above, the court's finding that Tenants failed to comply with applicable building and housing laws materially affecting health and safety was relevant to the summary possession claim. In any event, Shapley has not provided a sufficient record for our review of the alleged errors, which challenge the sufficiency and weight of the evidence.

trial, we further note that "[a]n appellate court will not pass upon the trial

at 558. We therefore disregard the asserted errors. See 
Tradewinds Hotel, 8 Haw. App. at 266, 799 P.2d at 67. 
(6) Shapley contends that the District Court exhibited 
bias in referring to "past cases and comments from past tenants 
regarding Defendant's property management style." 
[W]here judicial misconduct or bias deprives a party of the
impartiality to which he or she is entitled, a new trial maybe required. However, reversal on the grounds of judicialbias or misconduct is warranted only upon a showing that thetrial was unfair. See [Handgards], Inc. v. Ethicon, Inc.,
743 F.2d 1282, 1289 (9th Cir.1984) (citations omitted),cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1190 . . . (1985). Unfairness, inturn, requires a clear and precise demonstration ofprejudice. See Mahoney v. Mitchell, 4 Haw. App. 410, 418,
668 P.2d 35, 40–41 (1983) . . . . 
Aga v. Hundahl, 78 Hawai# i 230, 242, 891 P.2d 1022, 1034 (1995). 
Here, while the District Court was explaining his 
ruling, Shapley asserted, "I think you're using hearsay from 
other things[,]" and referred to "your bias in other cases." The District Court responded: "I am not. I'm telling you right now, I have not considered any of that in my decision making." On this limited record, Shapley has not shown that the trial was unfair or otherwise made a clear and precise demonstration of prejudice. 
(7) Shapley contends that the District Court based the 
judgment against her on a "misrepresentation" in Rodrigues's trial memorandum, apparently inferred from the fact that the memorandum did not include the "full county building code." 
Again, Shapley's argument is conclusory, lacks 
supporting legal authority, and relies on factual assertions without supporting references to the record. See HRAP Rule 
28(b)(4), (7). In any event, Shapley has not provided a sufficient record for our review of the alleged error, and we therefore disregard it. See supra; HRAP Rule 10(b); Bettencourt,
