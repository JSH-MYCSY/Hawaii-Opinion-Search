IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻI 
IN THE MATTER OF THE TRUST OF TSUGIO KURIHARA 
REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST AGREEMENT DATED AUGUST 21, 1997, 
as Amended and Restated 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1TR161000036) 
 
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: 
Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that self-
represented Petitioner-Appellant Douglas M. Kurihara (Kurihara
) 
appeals from the Probate Court of the First Circuit's 
November 9, 2023 Denial of Kurihara's "Proposed Order Regarding 
Emergency Ex Parte Petition to Recuse the Honorable R. Mark 
Browning from the Above-Titled Court Action for Abuse of 
Judicial Discretion" (Denial of Proposed Order). The probate 
court issued an Hawai‘i Probate Rules (HPR) Rule 34(a) judgment 
in the underlying proceedings on a separate petition more than 
thirty days before Kurihara filed his notice of appeal in this

case. The probate court has not entered a judgment or certified 
order on the November 9, 2023 Denial of Proposed Order pursuant 
to HPR Rule 34(a) or (b) as Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-
1(a) and/or (b) (2016) require for a trust proceeding under 
these circumstances. 
When this court "perceive[s] a jurisdictional defect 
in an appeal, [it] must, sua sponte, dismiss the appeal." 
Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai‘i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995). 
HRS § 641-1 authorizes appeals from "all final judgments, 
orders, or decrees of circuit" courts in civil matters including 
probate and trust proceedings, and notes appeals "shall be taken 
in the manner and within the time provided by the rules of 
court." 
HPR Rule 1(a) indicates the probate rules apply to 
trust proceedings and HPR Rule 34 requires the entry of a 
judgment or certified order for an appeal: 
RULE 34. ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS, APPEALS. 
(a) Entry of Judgment. All formal testacy orders, 
orders of intestacy and determination of heirs, orders 
establishing conservatorship and/or guardianship, and 
orders establishing protective arrangements shall be 
reduced to judgment and the judgment shall be filed with 
the clerk of the court. Such judgments shall be final and 
immediately appealable as provided by statute. Any other 
order that fully addresses all claims raised in a petition 
to which it relates, but that does not finally end the 
proceeding, may be certified for appeal in the manner 
provided by Rule 54(b) of the Hawai‘ i Rules of Civil 
Procedure.

(b) Interlocutory Orders. In order to appeal from 
any other order prior to the conclusion of the proceeding, 
the order must be certified for appeal in accordance with 
Section 641–1(b) of the Hawai‘i Revised Statutes. 
(c) Final Judgment Closing Proceeding. At the 
conclusion of the proceeding, a final judgment closing the 
proceeding shall be entered and filed with the clerk of the 
court, at which time all prior uncertified interlocutory 
orders shall become immediately appealable. 
(d) Appeals. Final judgments as to all claims and 
parties, certified judgments, certified orders, and other 
orders appealable as provided by law may be appealed 
pursuant to the Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
applicable to civil actions. 
(Formatting altered.) 
Commentary to HPR Rule 34 explains, "Rule 34 [was] written to 
conform probate practice to the policy against piecemeal 
appeals, . . . to bring certainty to the timing of when and how 
an appeal can be taken, and to comply with the provisions of HRS 
§ 641-1." HPR Rule 34 cmt. 
In cases where HPR Rule 34 applies, the supreme court 
has determined when a "final judgment terminating the proceeding 
has not been entered, and" the orders appealed from "were not 
certified for appeal[,] . . . those orders are not before us." 
In re Guardianship of Carlsmith, 113 Hawai
‘i 211, 223, 151 P.3d 
692, 704 (2006). 
On March 6, 2024, the probate court clerk filed the 
record on appeal in CAAP-23-0000684,1 which indicates the only 
1 Kurihara failed to file a statement of jurisdiction in this case 
within ten days after the probate court clerk filed the record on appeal, as

appealable HPR Rule 34(a) judgment filed in the underlying trust 
proceeding was a March 8, 2021 Judgment another party appealed 
from in CAAP-21-0000275.2  The probate court clerk also filed a 
first amended record on appeal on March 7, 2024 and a first 
supplemental record on appeal on May 23, 2024, which also do not 
indicate that an appealable HPR Rule 34(a) judgment was filed in 
the case after March 8, 2021. The record on appeal, the first 
amended record on appeal, and first supplemental record on 
appeal do not indicate that an HPR Rule 34(b) order was filed in 
the case within thirty days before Kurihara filed his notice of 
appeal, or at any time after March 8, 2021. See Hawai‘i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 4(a)(1) ("When a civil appeal is 
permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 
days after entry of the judgment or appealable order."). 
Additionally, the collateral order doctrine does not 
apply here. See generally Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming &
Wright, 88 Hawai‘i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (noting the 
(. . . continued) 
required by Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP ) Rule 12.1(a). HRAP 
Rule 12.1(e) vests this court with discretion to impose sanctions, "including 
dismissal of the appeal following notice and a meaningful opportunity to be 
heard."  However, as noted in the body of this order we dismiss Kurihara's 
appeal because we lack appellate jurisdiction over the order Kurihara 
appealed from, not because Kurihara failed to file a statement of 
jurisdiction in this appeal. 
2 This court disposed of CAAP-21-0000275 in a November 13, 2024 summary 
disposition order.

three elements which must be met in order to invoke the 
collateral order doctrine). 
Absent an appealable judgment, HPR Rule 34(b) 
certified order, or collateral order filed within the 
appropriate time frame, we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that CAAP-23-0000684 
is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.
