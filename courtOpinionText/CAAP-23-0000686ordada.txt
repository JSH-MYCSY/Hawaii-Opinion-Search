IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I

STATE  OF  HAWAI I,  Respondent-Appellee

HONOLULU   DIVISION

ORDER 
(By:   Leonard,   Acting  Chief  Judge,  Nakasone   and  McCullen,   JJ.) 
Upon review
 of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On
 November 17, 2023, the appellate clerk received 
from self-represented Petitioner-Appellant LeRoy Lee Bolden

to Release Petitioner from Custody (Petition), under Hawai i 
Rules
 of Penal Procedure Rule 40, and a Request to Proceed 
Without Paying Filing Fees (Request for Fee Waiver); 
(2) The appellate clerk mistakenly created this appeal 
with the Petition, which should have been forwarded, along with 
the Request for Fee Waiver, to the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit to create a new case; and 
(3) Bolden subsequently filed in this appeal several 
documents that should have been filed in other cases. See 
Hawai i Court  Records Rules Rule 3.3. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appellate 
clerk shall forward to the Clerk of the Circuit Court of First 
Circuit (circuit court clerk) copies of the Petition (Dkt. 1) and
