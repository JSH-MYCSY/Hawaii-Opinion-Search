and 
CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT AGENCY, STATE OF HAWAII, Defendant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1PP171006360) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
D.H.
 (Father) appeals from the October 19, 2023 "Order 
Regarding Attorney's Fees and Costs Related to Respondent-
Father's Motion for Relief after Judgment or Order and Declaration, Filed June 15, 2023" ( Fee Order ) entered by the 
Family Court of the First Circuit.
1 We affirm. 
N.Y., now known as N.S. ( Mother), is the mother of
Child. Mother filed a petition for paternity against Father on 
September 25, 2017. A stipulated order that Father is Child's 
father was entered on January 10, 2018. After more than five years of litigation, the family court entered a stipulated "Order Regarding Custody, Visitation, Child Support and Other Child Related Orders" ( Custody Order ) on April 3, 2023.

Two months later, Father moved for relief from the 
Custody Order. A hearing was held on August 31, 2023. Father 
and Mother testified. On October 3, 2023, the family court entered an order on Father's motion. On October 19, 2023, the family court entered the Fee Order, awarding Mother $2,776.12 in attorney's fees and costs,
2 to be paid by Father within 60 days. 
This appeal followed. The family court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law ( COL) on January 25, 2024, under Hawai #i 
Family Court Rules Rule 52(a). 
Father's opening brief states four points of error and 
challenges many of the family court's findings and conclusions. But he does not argue that any finding of fact was clearly erroneous. See
 Fisher v. Fisher, 111 
Hawai#i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 
355, 360 (2006) (findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly 
erroneous  standard). 
His points on the family court's findings 
of fact are waived. Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived."). 
Father states: "While some of the Findings of Fact are 
important to this case, the determinative factor for this appeal is a question of law on the extent of the Court's authority in a paternity case to assess attorney's fees and court costs in a post-judgment Motion." Conclusions of law are reviewed de novo. 
Fisher, 111 
Hawai#i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360. 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 584-163 applies to 
awards of attorneys fees and costs in paternity actions. Father argues the statute applies only to proceedings that establish 
2 The family court reduced the fee amount. Mother has not appealed
the reduction. Father does not challenge the amount of the award. 
3 HRS § 584-16 (2018) provides: 
The court may order reasonable fees of counsel, experts, and
the child's guardian ad litem, and other costs of the actionand pre-trial proceedings, including genetic tests, subjectto the provisions of section 584-11(f) [regarding contestedgenetic tests], to be paid by the parties in proportions andat times determined by the court. The court may order theproportion of any indigent party to be paid by the State, orsuch person as the court shall direct.

paternity, not to motions filed after the order establishing 
paternity. "We agree that HRS § 584–16 is limited to paternity actions. As specified in HRS § 584–15,[ ] however, paternity 
actions may involve custody issues." Doe v. Doe, 85 Hawai #i 108, 
112, 937 P.2d 949, 953 (App. 1997). Father's motion for relief involved visitation privileges. The family court was authorized to award Mother the attorneys fees and costs she incurred in connection with Father's motion for relief. 4
[T]he family court possesses wide discretion in making its
decisions and those decision[s] will not be set aside unlessthere is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus, we will notdisturb the family court's decisions on appeal unless thefamily court disregarded rules or principles of law orpractice to the substantial detriment of a party litigantand its decision clearly exceeded the bounds of reason. 
Fisher, 111 Hawai#i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360. 
The family court found: 
12. On June 15, 2023, [Father's attorney] filed a
Motion For Relief After Judgment Or Order And Declaration("Motion For Relief"). Prior to filing the Motion forRelief, [Father's attorney] made no attempt to communicatewith [Mother's attorney] to determine whether the issuesraised in the Motion for Relief could be resolved outside of a judiciary court. 
. . . . 
18. Prior to filing the Motion for Relief, [Father's
attorney] made no attempts to communicate the substance ofFATHER's issues with [Mother's attorney], nor seek toresolve FATHER's issues with [Mother's attorney] through amethod of alternative dispute resolution, such asnegotiation or mediation. 
. . . . 
20. In her August 25, 2023 Declaration, MOTHER
articulated her desire to peacefully co-parent with FATHER.MOTHER asserted her desire to avoid renewed court filings, 
4 HRS § 584-15 (2018) provides, in relevant part: 
(c) The judgment or order may contain any other provision
directed against the appropriate party to the proceeding,
concerning the . . . custody . . . of the child, visitation 
privileges with the child , . . . or any other matter in the
best interest of the child. 
(Emphasis added.)

as constant litigation was financially expensive and added
undoubted stress and anxiety to her family. MOTHER was amendable to any competent dispute resolutions methods suchas mediation. 
21. MOTHER articulated [that], prior to filing the
Motion for Relief, FATHER failed to engage in any good faithattempts to settle the issues by intelligently communicatingthe issues to MOTHER or to her counsel through [Father'sattorney]. Instead, FATHER continued to engage inconflictual behavior by filing frivolous motions and seekinglitigation for each and every issue. 
. . . . 
37. [Father's attorney] objected to [Mother's
attorney]'s request for attorney fees and costs but admitted
he made no attempts to resolve FATHER's issues with[Mother's attorney] prior to filing the Motion for Relief.[Father's attorney] gave no reason why he failed in hisobligation to make any attempts to contact [Mother'sattorney] prior to filing the Motion for Relief. 
On this record, we conclude the family court acted 
within its discretion by awarding attorneys fees and costs to 
Mother. The October 19, 2023 "Order Regarding Attorney's Fees and Costs Related to Respondent-Father's Motion for Relief after Judgment or Order and Declaration, Filed June 15, 2023" is affirmed. The record does not show that Father obtained a stay on enforcement of the Fee Order, or whether Father paid the award. If Father has not yet paid the award, Father shall also pay interest on the amount of the award, at ten percent a year under HRS § 478-3 (2008), from December 18, 2023 until the Fee Order is satisfied.
