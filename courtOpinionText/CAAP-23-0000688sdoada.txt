APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CPC-22-0000507) 
  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Nakasone, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.) 
This appeal challenges the dismissal without prejudice 
of a grand jury indictment for a 1978 murder based on 
insufficient evidence of probable cause. 
We affirm. 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawaiʻ i (State) appeals 
from the October 24, 2023 "Findings of Fact [(
FOFs)], 
Conclusions of Law [(COLs)] and Order Granting [Defendant-Appellee Steven Ray Simpson (Simpson)'s] Motion to Dismiss Indictment" (Order Granting Dismissal) filed by the Circuit  
           
 
 
   
 
    
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Court of the Third Circuit (Circuit Court).  The Circuit Court 
concluded that there was "insufficient competent evidence" due 
to lack of foundation for two critical pieces of evidence: (1) a blue plastic tarp, purportedly recovered at the crime scene, which contained Simpson's fingerprint, and (2) "pubic combings," purportedly taken from the decedent's body, which contained Simpson's DNA.   1
 On appeal, the State contends that the Circuit Court: 
(1) "abused its discretion in granting the Motion to Dismiss because 'competency of the evidence' before the grand jury only applies to accusations of prosecutorial misconduct"; and (2) "abused its discretion in substituting its judgment for the grand jury in determining the sufficiency of the evidence 
regarding the foundation of the evidence."
   2
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Simpson's points of error as follows, and affirm. 
1 The Honorable Peter K. Kubota presided. 
2  2   The points of error refer to an "Objection" to the "Proposed 
[FOF]s, [COL]s and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss Indictment"  (Objection),  
but do not identify any specific  FOFs and COLs in the Order Granting 
Dismissal  that the State is challenging on appeal. See  Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4)(C) ( requiring  "either a quotation of 
the finding or conclusion urged as error or reference to appended findings 
and conclusions"). The  State also does not present  argument specific to any 
FOFs or COLs. See  HRAP Rule 28(b)(7)  ("Points not argued may be deemed 
waived.").   Unchallenged FOFs are binding. See  State v. Rodrigues, 
145  Hawai‘i 487, 494, 454 P.3d 428, 435 (2019).   Even if we were to consider 
the State's O bjection, it does not show  that the proposed findings were 
clearly erroneous, where the Objection: summarily refers to the proposed 
findings by number only; indicates  the State " objects"  with a brief reason; 
and contains no legal argument for any objection.

On June 23, 2022, the State indicted Simpson for the 
1978 murder of Valerie Warshay (Warshay) in Puna, Hawaiʻ i, in 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (
HRS) § 707-701(1).3 
On March 16, 2023, Simpson filed a "Motion to Dismiss 
Indictment" (Motion to Dismiss) arguing that "[i]ncompetent 
evidence" and "[e]xcessive use of hearsay evidence denied 
[Simpson] a fair grand jury proceeding[,]" and that 
"[i]nsufficient evidence was presented to support a finding of probable cause[.]" The State opposed the motion. 
The Motion to Dismiss attached the transcript of the 
grand jury proceeding, which contained the testimonies pertinent 
here, of retired Hawaiʻ i County Police Department (HIPD) Officer 
William Perreira ( 
Officer Perreira), HIPD Detective Derek 
Morimoto (Detective Morimoto), and an acquaintance of Warshay 
named Raymond Dana James (James). Officer Perreira testified that he attended the autopsy of Warshay's body, and he responded affirmatively when the prosecutor asked if there were "items taken from [Warshay's] body for forensic purposes such as hair and fingernail clippings[,]" and if he "watched those [items] be collected[.]" Detective Morimoto testified that: "there was a blue tarp that [Warshay's] body was found laying on, [and] two items of swimwear near the body"; the FBI "had developed a fingerprint on the blue tarp"; that fingerprint matched Simpson's "right ring finger"; "Forensic Analytical took 
swabbings from the . . . teeth of the comb that was used to 
3 The Indictment charged that "[o]n or about April 22, 1978 through 
April 23, 1978 . . . STEVEN RAY SIMPSON intentionally or knowingly caused the 
death of another person, Valerie Warshay," committing the offense of 
"Murder," in violation of HRS § 707-701(1) (1976), which provided:  " a person 
commits the offense of murder if he intentionally or knowingly causes the 
death of another person."

collect the pubic hair samples from [Warshay's body], and . . . 
there was a sperm, uh, fraction . . . discovered"; and Simpson 
was identified as "[t]he major contributor" and "[t]he minor contribut[or] was [ ] James." James testified that he met Warshay at Harry K. Brown Park, that they "spent the night together[,]" and that it did not surprise him that his DNA was present on some items of Warshay's. 
At the September 20, 2023 hearing on the Motion to 
Dismiss, the Circuit Court received the grand jury transcript into evidence; and following arguments from both parties, orally granted the motion. The Circuit Court noted "there was no foundation laid as to either of the two key pieces of evidence," leading to "huge leaps in the evidence considered by the grand 
jury[,]" because "[n]o one ha[d] testified with personal 
knowledge that either item was collected from the crime scene or the victim." 
The Circuit Court's October 24, 2023 Order Granting 
Dismissal concluded that the tarp and pubic combings constituted incompetent evidence for lack of foundation, rendering the remaining evidence presented to the grand jury insufficient to establish probable cause, as follows: 
FINDINGS OF FACTS [sic] 
 . . . . 
32.
 The State's case was based upon [Simpson]'s 
fingerprint which was located on a purported blue tarp 
which Warshay was found lying on[,] and DNA analysis of 
Warshay's pubic combings; 
33. [Detective] Morimoto testified that while he 
found the blue tarp in evidence, he had no knowledge of the recovery of the blue tarp, i.e. whether that tarp was in fact a tarp that Warshay was lying on.

34. There was no evidence presented to the grand jury 
that the tarp in the police evidence room was in fact a 
tarp that Warshay was lying on; 
35. [Officer] Perreira did not testify that he saw 
the tarp when he arrived at the crime scene nor did he testify that the police recovered a tarp; 
36. There being no evidentiary foundation 
established, the tarp and its forensic value was 
inadmissible and incompetent evidence; 
37. There was no evidence that police recovered pubic 
combings from Warshay's body; 
38. [Officer] Perreira did not testify that pubic 
combings were recovered; 
39. There was no evidence presented to the grand jury 
that the purported pubic combings which Forensic Analytical analyzed actually came from Warshay; 
40. There being no evidentiary foundation 
established, the pubic combings and its forensic value was 
inadmissible and incompetent. 
41. The Court reviewed the issue of hearsay evidence 
presented to the grand jury and finds that there was not 
excessive use of hearsay evidence presented; 
42. The incompetent and inadmissible evidence 
violated [Simpson]'s due process right to a fair and 
impartial grand jury proceeding; 
43. Without the incompetent and inadmissible 
evidence, evidence presented was insufficient to establish probable cause;

Dismissal.

(1) The Circuit Court's dismissal on grounds that the 
evidence was insufficient to establish probable cause due to incompetent evidence, without a finding of prosecutorial misconduct, was not an 
abuse of discretion. 
The State asserts, based on language from Hawaiʻ i 
cases, that "[o]nly if a claim of prosecutorial misconduct is 
raised can the competency of the evidence be attacked." The 
State relies on language from, inter alia, Chong
, 86 Hawaiʻi at 
289, 949 P.2d at 129 ("The function of grand jury to protect 
against unwarranted prosecution does not entail a duty . . . to determine that the prosecution's case is supported by competent 
evidence." (citation omitted)), and 
Wong
, 97 Hawaiʻi at 518, 
40 P.3d 914 at 920 (holding that because a "grand jury 
proceeding is not adversary in nature[,] . . . an indictment may not be attacked on the ground of the incompetency of the evidence considered by the grand jury, where prosecutorial misconduct is not involved" (citation omitted)). Accordingly, the State argues that "[t]he Indictment should not have been dismissed absent a showing of prosecutorial misconduct." The State claims that the record does not reflect any prosecutorial misconduct and maintains that it "did not step outside the bounds of a proper presentment to the Grand Jury." 
A grand jury's function is to determine whether 
probable cause exists to support the commencement of criminal 
prosecution. See Ganal
, 81 Hawaiʻi at 367, 917 P.2d at 379 ("A 
grand jury indictment must be based on probable cause."); Hawaiʻ i 
Const. Art 1, § 10. "'Probable cause' has been defined as 'a 
state of facts as would lead a person of ordinary caution or prudence to believe and conscientiously entertain a strong 
suspicion of the guilt of the accused.'"

218, 269 P.3d at 753 (quoting Ontai, 84 Hawaiʻ i at 63, 929 P.2d 
at 76). "[S]ufficient legal and competent evidence before a 
grand jury which establishes probable cause that a suspect has violated the law will support an indictment." State v. Kuba, 
68 Haw. 184, 190, 706 P.2d 1305, 1310 (1985) (citing 
State v. 
Scotland, 58 Haw. 474, 476, 572 P.2d 497, 498 (1977)). 
"[W]here 
sufficient legal and competent evidence is presented to a grand jury, the reception of illegal or incompetent evidence would not authorize the court to set aside an indictment if the remaining legal evidence, considered as a whole, is sufficient to warrant 
the indictment." State v. Chong (ICA Chong),
4 86 Hawaiʻ i 290, 
295, 949 P.2d 130, 135 (App. 1997) (quoting Scotland, 58 Haw. at 
476, 572 P.2d at 498). 
Applying these principles here, a trial court 
reviewing a challenge to an indictment based on sufficiency of evidence to establish probable cause considers whether the record of the grand jury proceeding contains "sufficient legal and competent evidence" to support the indictment. See Kuba, 
68 Haw. at 190, 706 P.2d at 1310 (emphasis added). The Circuit Court's competency of evidence analysis did not have to be tethered to a review for prosecutorial misconduct when it was determining whether there was sufficient evidence to establish probable cause to indict Simpson for Warshay's murder. See id.; 
ICA Chong, 86 Hawai‘ i at 295, 949 P.2d at 135. It was not an 
4 ICA Chong is a 1997 opinion from the Intermediate Court of 
Appeals (ICA), and was not overturned on supreme court review in Chong, 
86 Hawaiʻi at 290, 949 P.2d at 130.  The supreme court affirmed ICA Chong, 
holding that "the prosecution's use of pre- scripted questions and answers 
. . . [for] its grand jury witnesses . . . did not so clearly infringe upon 
the jury's decision- making function and was not so innately prejudicial that 
the practice— in and of itself— violated Chong's right to due process of law by 
invading the province of the grand jury." Id. at 289, 949 P.2d at 129.

abuse of discretion for the Circuit Court to determine that 
certain evidence was incompetent in its sufficiency-of-evidence-
to-establish-probable-cause analysis leading to the dismissal of 
the indictment in this case. See Wong, 97 Hawaiʻ i at 517, 
40 P.3d at 919. 
(2) The Circuit Court did not improperly 
"substitut[e] its judgment for the grand jury" when it concluded there was insufficient evidence to support the indictment. 
The State argues that the Circuit Court "abused its 
discretion in substituting its judgment for the grand jury in 
determining the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the 
foundation of the evidence." The State asserts that it "is entitled to legitimate inferences that the physical and forensic evidence testified to is linked to the case," contending that "[t]he State does not need to show a rigorous chain of custody at a grand jury presentment" and "[t]he Grand Jury was entitled to make the inference that the evidence was precisely what it purported to be, and then connect Simpson to the charge in the Indictment."
5 
The Circuit Court's determination that there was 
insufficient evidence to establish probable cause to support the indictment was based on the following unchallenged findings. 
See Rodrigues, 145 Hawai‘ i at 494, 454 P.3d at 435. Regarding 
the tarp, the Circuit Court found in FOFs 33-35 that: 
Detective 
Morimoto "had no knowledge of the recovery of the blue tarp"; 
the State did not present evidence "that the tarp in the police evidence room was in fact a tarp that Warshay was lying on"; and 
5 The State makes no argument based on Hawai‘i Rules of Evidence 
(HRE) Rule 1101(d)(2), which states that the HRE are inapplicable in grand 
jury proceedings.

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Officer Perreira "did not testify that he saw the tarp when he 
arrived at the crime scene nor did he testify that the police 
recovered a tarp[.]" Regarding the pubic combings, the Circuit Court found in FOFs 37-39 that: "[t]here was no evidence that police recovered pubic combings from Warshay's body"; Officer Perreira, whom the record reflects attended the autopsy, "did not testify that pubic combings were recovered"; and the State did not present evidence "that the purported pubic combings which Forensic Analytical analyzed actually came from Warshay[.]" 
We review the Circuit Court's conclusions based on 
these unchallenged findings de novo. Taylor, 126 Hawaiʻ i at 218, 
269 P.3d at 753. 
The COLs pertinent here, COLs 5, 8, 11, and 
12, stated: "[t]he tarp and its forensic value was inadmissible and incompetent evidence"; "[t]he pubic combings and [their] forensic value [were] inadmissible and incompetent"; "[d]isregarding the incompetent and inadmissible evidence, there was insufficient evidence to support the finding of probable 
cause"; and that "[b]ased on insufficient competent evidence 
presented, the indictment must be dismissed." These COLs were not erroneous. See id.; 
Kuba, 68 Haw. at 190, 706 P.2d at 1310; 
ICA Chong, 86 Hawaiʻ i at 295, 949 P.2d at 135. Therefore, the 
Circuit Court did not "substitut[e] its judgment for the grand jury," and did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the 
indictment based on these conclusions that the evidence was 
insufficient to establish probable cause. See Wong, 97 Hawaiʻ i 
at 517, 40 P.3d at 919.
