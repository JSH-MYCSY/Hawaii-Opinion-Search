(2)  The Final Judgment resolves or purports to resolve 
claims raised in a separate but related proceeding, 3CTR-21-

purposes of an evidentiary hearing only;  
(4) The claims raised in 3CTR-22-0000004 remain 
pending, and the Final Judgment does not and cannot resolve all claims of all parties in 3CTR-22-0000004. See  Jenkins v. Cades

granted, and the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
