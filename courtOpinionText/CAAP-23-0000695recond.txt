(CASE NO. 2CC161000597) 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION 
(By:

Upon consideration of the February 10, 2026 Motion for

     overlooked or misapprehended. See Rule 40(b) of the Hawaiʻ i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for 
Reconsideration is denied. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all other pending motions 
are dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, February 19, 2026.
