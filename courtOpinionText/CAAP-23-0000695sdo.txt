APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CC161000597) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Self-represented Plaintiff-Appellant Ronda Beselt 
(Beselt) appeals from the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's 
(1) October 26, 2023 order denying her Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b)(6) Motion and (2) March 27, 2024   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
 order denying her motion to reconsider the deadline to withdraw 
the settlement money (Withdrawal Deadline).1 
On appeal, Beselt challenges the circuit court's 
denial of her (1) HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) Motion, (2) request to 
supplement the record under Hawaiʻ i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 10(e), and (3) motion to reconsider the Withdrawal 
Deadline. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this 
appeal as discussed below and affirm. 
According to Beselt, she was visiting Maui from Canada 
with her husband and two children in January 2015. 
While at the 
beach fronting the Grand Wailea Resort (Grand Wailea), a beach 
umbrella became airborne and struck her in the head. 
Although much litigation stemmed from this incident, 
we recount only the procedural background relevant to this 
appeal. 
In December 2016, Beselt filed a complaint, and later 
a first amended complaint in January 2017, against 
1 The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided. 
Beselt was represented by Kai Lawrence (Lawrence) at the time the 
appeals were filed, but Lawrence withdrew after briefing in this case was 
completed.

  Waldorf=Astoria Management LLC (
Waldorf), a foreign limited 
liability company doing business as the Grand Wailea. 
In August 2019, Beselt and Waldorf entered into a 
"Joint Tortfeasor Release and Indemnification Agreement" 
(Settlement Agreement). (Formatting altered.) Beselt made 
handwritten amendments to the Settlement Agreement and initialed 
those amendments. Beselt consulted an attorney regarding the 
Settlement Agreement. Beselt signed and dated the Settlement Agreement and had it notarized. In accordance with the 
Settlement Agreement, Beselt signed a "Stipulation for Dismissal 
with Prejudice of All Claims and All Parties" (Stipulation to 
Dismiss). (Formatting altered.) 
However, the Stipulation to Dismiss could not be filed 
until the settlement funds were paid, and the settlement funds 
could not be paid until all the conditions of the Settlement 
Agreement were satisfied, including attorneys' liens, which 
Beselt had not yet paid. 
In May 2021, about twenty-one months after signing the 
Settlement Agreement, Beselt moved to stay the proceedings and set aside the Settlement Agreement, which the circuit court 
denied. Beselt moved for reconsideration, which the circuit 
court also denied. Beselt appealed, creating CAAP-21-0000463.

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 In June 2021, Waldorf moved to deposit the settlement 
funds with the court, with the funds to be disbursed after 
Beselt satisfied her attorneys' lien. The circuit court granted 
the motion, retained jurisdiction regarding the disposition of 
the deposited funds, and ordered that if the funds "are not 
withdrawn in full within five (5) years of the date of deposit, 
any monies not yet withdrawn will escheat to the State of 
Hawaiʻi." Beselt appealed, creating CAAP-21-0000490. 
Ultimately, the circuit court dismissed the case with 
prejudice. Beselt appealed, creating CAAP-21-0000492. 
Beselt's appeals in CAAP-21-0000463, CAAP-21-0000490, 
and CAAP-21-0000492 were consolidated (First Appeal
). Following 
remand from this court, the circuit court entered its 
January 12, 2022 Amended Final Judgment dismissing all parties 
and claims. In the First Appeal, Beselt raised as an issue her 
mental capacity to settle the case. Beselt v. Waldorf=Astoria
Mgmt. LLC, 155 Hawaiʻ i 178, 557 P.3d 907, Nos. CAAP-21-0000463, 
CAAP-21-0000490, and CAAP-21-0000492, 2024 WL 4534146, at *1 
(App. Oct. 21, 2024) (SDO). 
This court affirmed the circuit 
court's final judgment. Id. at *3. 
In September 2023, while the First Appeal was pending 
before this court, Beselt filed her HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) Motion for relief from judgment. 
The circuit court denied Beselt's 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) Motion, explaining it lacked jurisdiction and 
4   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 was "not inclined to grant such a request." 
Beselt appealed, 
creating CAAP-23-0000695. 
In January 2024, Beselt requested the circuit court 
remove the five-year deadline to withdraw the settlement funds 
and to place the settlement funds into a "high-yield interest-
bearing account." The circuit court permitted the settlement 
funds to be deposited into an interest-bearing account. The 
circuit court later ruled, among other things, that the five-year deadline was extended to the "shorter or sooner" date of 
January 1, 2027, or until "[a] final judgment [was] entered by 
any appellate court on the issue of the validity of the 
settlement." Beselt moved for reconsideration; the circuit 
court denied Beselt's motion but revised the extension to say 
the "effective date of a final judgment . . . ." (Emphasis 
omitted.) Beselt appealed, creating CAAP-24-0000314. 
CAAP-23-0000695 and CAAP-24-0000314 were consolidated 
(Second Appeal), and this is the appeal we address today. 
Again, in this Second Appeal, Beselt challenges the 
circuit court's denial of her (1) HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) Motion, (2) request to supplement the record under HRAP Rule 10(e), and 
(3) motion to reconsider the Withdrawal Deadline.  
(1)  First, Beselt contends the circuit court abused 
its discretion in denying her HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) Motion.

 Under HRCP Rule 60(b), the circuit court may relieve a 
party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding based on: 
(1) Mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable 
neglect; 
(2) Newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a 
new trial under Rule 59(b); 
(3) Fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation or other misconduct of 
an adverse party; 
(4) The judgment is void; 
(5) The judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is 
based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it 
is no longer equitable that the judgment should have 
prospective application; or 
(6) Any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. 
HRCP Rule 60(b) (formatting altered). We review the denial of 
an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion for an abuse of discretion. Mālama 
Kakanilua v. Dir. of Dep't of Pub. Works, 157 Hawaiʻ i 280, 289, 
576 P.3d 793, 802 (2025). 
(a)  Beselt argues the circuit court disregarded Life 
of the Land v. Ariyoshi, 57 Haw. 249, 553 P.2d 464 (1976).   
According to Beselt, Life of the Land held that jurisdiction to 
rule on an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion remains with the trial court 
while an appeal is pending, so the circuit court's ruling was 
erroneous.  2
2 We note that Beselt also makes various arguments about the timeliness 
of the HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) Motion, but the circuit court's order does not 
reflect that the HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) Motion was denied for untimeliness. 
Thus, we do not address the arguments related to timeliness. 
6   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  In Life of the Land, the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court ruled 
that jurisdiction resided with the appellate court while an 
appeal was pending, but an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion "may be made and considered in the circuit court." 
57 Haw. at 251, 553 P.2d 
at 466. "If that court indicates that it will grant the motion, the appellant may then move in this court for a remand of the 
case," and "[d]uring the pendency of the motion in the circuit 
court, the parties may move in this court for such relief from 
the appeal requirements as may be appropriate." Id.
Here, the circuit court denied Beselt's HRCP 
Rule 60(b)(6) Motion "[o]n the grounds that the Court lacks 
jurisdiction to hear the motion and is not inclined to grant such a request." When Beselt filed her HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) 
Motion on September 25, 2023, the First Appeal was pending 
before this court. 
Thus, this court (not the circuit court) had 
jurisdiction over the case. 
As such, the circuit court properly interpreted Life 
of the Land and acknowledged that it did not have jurisdiction. See 57 Haw. at 251, 553 P.2d at 466. Moreover, the court indicated it was not inclined to grant her HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) 
Motion. If the circuit court was inclined to grant the HRCP 
Rule 60(b)(6) Motion, in accordance with Life of the Land, it 
would be up to Beselt to move for remand so that jurisdiction 
7
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 may be transferred from this court to the circuit court. See
id. 
Thus, indicating it "lacks jurisdiction to hear the 
motion and is not inclined to grant such a request" was not an 
abuse of the circuit court's discretion. 
(b)  Beselt also argues that any denial of her HRCP 
Rule 60(b)(6) Motion on the merits was erroneous because relief 
should have been granted pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(1) through (6) for various reasons. 
But Beselt's HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) Motion was based on 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(6). Thus, to the extent Beselt raises arguments 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(1), (2), (3), and (5) on appeal, 
those arguments are waived. See Right to Know Comm. v. City
Council, 117 Hawaiʻ i 1, 14, 175 P.3d 111, 124 (App. 2007) ("Legal 
issues not raised in the trial court are ordinarily deemed 
waived on appeal." (citation omitted)). 
And as to Beselt's HRCP 
Rule 60(b)(4) argument that the judgment is void based on lack of jurisdiction because she had no mental capacity, this 
argument was raised and ruled on in Beselt
, 2024 WL 4534146, at 
*1-2. 
As to HRCP Rule 60(b)(6), Beselt argues she is 
entitled to relief pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) because she 
8   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 
  
   
    
     
    lacked capacity, she was unrepresented, and her numerous trial 
attorneys3 committed gross negligence. 
Under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6), "the movant must show that 
(1) the motion is based on some reason other than those 
specifically stated in clauses 60(b)(1) through (5); (2) the 
reason urged is such as to justify the relief; and (3) the 
motion is made within a reasonable time." Cvitanovich-Dubie v.
Dubie, 125 Hawai
ʻi 128, 144, 254 P.3d 439, 455 (2011) (citation 
and emphasis omitted). HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) "provides for 
extraordinary relief and is only invoked upon a showing of 
exceptional circumstances." Hawaiʻi

marks and citation omitted). 
"Equity principles guide Rule 60(b) motions." Franco
v. Reinhardt, 153 Hawaiʻ i 406, 415, 539 P.3d 934, 943 (2023).  
HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) relief "is not for the purpose of relieving 
[parties] from free, calculated and deliberate choices [they 
have] made," and a "party remains under a duty to take legal 
steps to protect [its] own interests." Citicorp Mortg., Inc. v.

(2) James J. Bickerton, Nathan P. Roehrig, and Robert S. Miyashita withdrew 
in May 2018; (3) Michael J. Green and Peter C. Hsieh (Hsieh) withdrew in 
August 2019; and (4) Arnold T. Phillips II withdrew in 2023.

 omitted), overruled on other grounds by Mālama Kakanilua, 157 
Hawai
ʻi at 290-92, 576 P.3d at 803-05. 
There are no exceptional circumstances here. Beselt 
attempts to undo the Settlement Agreement. An agreement to 
which Beselt made hand-written edits. Beselt initialed those 
hand-written edits. Beselt consulted an attorney regarding the 
Settlement Agreement.4 Beselt then signed and dated the 
Settlement Agreement. Beselt had the Settlement Agreement notarized. And Beselt signed the Stipulation to Dismiss in 
compliance with the Settlement Agreement. 
A reasonable inference from these uncontested facts is 
that Beselt's agreement to settle was a free, calculated, and deliberate choice, and that she took steps to protect her 
interests. The extraordinary relief provided for under HRCP 
Rule 60(b)(6) was not warranted under these circumstances. 
Thus, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion 
when it indicated it was not inclined to grant relief under HRCP 
Rule 60(b)(6). 
(2) Beselt next contends she is entitled to relief 
pursuant to HRAP Rule 10(e) because one of her trial attorneys 
4 Along with consulting John Rapp (Rapp), Beselt also consulted with 
James Krueger prior to entering into the S ettlement Agreement.  It appears 
that Rapp even communicated with Waldorf's counsel "in a series of 
communications" regarding "suggested revisions and comments to the 
[Settlement Agreement]."

 suffered from severe "mental and physical ailments" during his 
representation of Beselt that "limited his ability to advocate 
properly in the case." This, Beselt contends, warrants 
supplementing and/or clarifying the record on appeal with expert 
reports that allegedly demonstrate her own diminished capacity.5 
HRAP Rule 10(e) allows for correction or modification 
of the record if differences arise as to what truly occurred or 
if something material was erroneously or accidently omitted: 
(e) Correction or modification of the record. 
(1) If any differences arise as to whether the record 
truly discloses what occurred in the court or 
agency appealed from, the differences shall be 
submitted to and settled by that court or agency 
and the record made to conform to the truth. 
(2) If anything material to any party is omitted from 
the record by error or accident or is misstated 
therein, corrections or modifications may be as 
follows: 
(A) by the stipulation of the parties; or 
(B) by the court or agency appealed from, either 
before or after the record is transmitted; or 
(C) by direction of the appellate court before 
which the case is pending, on proper 
suggestion or its own initiative. 
(3) All other questions as to the form and contents of 
the record shall be presented to the appellate 
court before which the case is pending. 
(Formatting altered.) 
5 In making this argument, Beselt improperly attaches appendices that 
are not in the record on appeal. This court does not consider matters 
outside of the record on appeal. Bettencourt v. Bettencourt
, 80 Hawaiʻi 225, 
229 n.2, 909 P.2d 553, 557 n.2 (1995); HRAP Rule 10(a). 
11   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
   
 Beselt fails to show that the expert reports were 
filed and erroneously or accidentally omitted. Instead, Beselt 
attempts to supplement the record on appeal with new evidence.     6
Thus, Beselt is not entitled to relief under HRAP 
Rule 10(e). 
(3) Finally, Beselt contends the circuit court abused 
its discretion when it "failed to adequately address" the 
Withdrawal Deadline, arguing the First Appeal would not likely be resolved by then and Attorney Peter C. Hsieh's (Hsieh) 
"bankruptcy would not be completed until November of 2028."
7 
Waldorf, however, asserts this court lacks 
jurisdiction over an appeal of the Withdrawal Deadline, because 
the circuit court's order "explicitly contemplates further 
action by the circuit court" as the Withdrawal Deadline may be 
"extended upon proper motion." 
We address Waldorf's jurisdictional argument first. 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016) permits appeals 
6 Beselt attempted this same argument in CAAP- 21-0000463 for similar 
expert reports, and this court ruled that Beselt failed to demonstrate that 
the expert reports were "omitted from the record by error or accident" as 
required by HRAP Rule 10(e) because Beselt did not argue that the reports 
were "offered or submitted for filing in the underlying case." 
7 Hsieh, one of Beselt's former attorneys , went through a Chapter 13 
bankruptcy proceeding, resulting in a repayment plan beginning on November 2, 
2023, and lasting for sixty months, or five years. 
12   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   from "final judgments, orders, or decrees." Final orders are 
orders "ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be 
accomplished" and "an order is not final if the rights of a 
party involved remain undetermined or if the matter is retained 
for further action." Familian Nw., Inc. v. Cent. Pac. Boiler &
Piping, Ltd.
, 68 Haw. 368, 369, 714 P.2d 936, 937 (1986) 
(citations omitted). Post-judgment orders are appealable final 
orders under HRS § 641-1(a) "if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto v. McCurdy, 
103 Hawaiʻ i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003). 
Here, the rights of the parties involved do not remain 
undetermined; rather, the circuit court's order set the deadline for the access or withdrawal of the settlement funds and simply 
permitted the parties to move for an extension if necessary. 
And the circuit court retained jurisdiction over the 
"disposition of the funds deposited," not the terms of the 
Withdrawal Deadline. Thus, we have jurisdiction over Beselt's 
appeal from the order denying her motion to reconsider the 
Withdrawal Deadline. 
As to Beselt's contention, the circuit court did not 
abuse its discretion in adjusting the Withdrawal Deadline. 
13
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
   
 
  
 
 Hsieh and Michael J. Green (Green) placed an attorneys' lien on 
the settlement funds.8 According to the Settlement Agreement, 
Beselt can receive the settlement funds "only after all liens, claims or subrogation, and/or reimbursement . . . have been 
satisfied by" Beselt. 
The circuit court allowed the funds to be deposited 
with the circuit court clerk and ordered that if the funds were 
"not withdrawn in full within five (5) years of the date of deposit, any monies not yet withdrawn will escheat to the State 
of Hawaiʻ i." The circuit court then provided Beselt some relief 
by extending the Withdrawal Deadline and accounting for the 
First Appeal pending at the time. The circuit court also provided the option of moving to extend the Withdrawal Deadline 
if necessary. 
As such, Beselt fails to show the circuit court 
disregarded rules or principals of law to her substantial 
detriment. 
In light of the foregoing, we affirm the circuit 
court's October 26, 2023 order denying Beselt's HRCP 
8 On February 1, 2021, Green and Hsieh moved to collect on the 
attorneys' lien (Motion to Collect). On February 26, 2021, the c ircuit court

matter for arbitration.
