IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
TIMOTHY  WILLIAMS, 
Plaintiff/Counterclaim  Defendant-Appellant,  v. 
COSTCO  WHOLESALE  CORPORATION, 
Defendant/Counterclaimant-Appellee 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT 
SOUTH  KOHALA  DIVISION 
(CASE  NO.  3DSC-23-0000009) 
ORDER  GRANTING  IN  PART  MOTION  TO  DISMISS  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Nakasone   and  McCullen,   JJ.) 
Upon  consideration  of  Defendant-Appellee  Costco 
Wholesale  Corporation's  (Costco)  January  8,  2024  motion  to 
dismiss  self-represented  Plaintiff-Appellant  Pastor  Timothy 
Williams's  (Williams )  appeal  filed  November   29,  2023  (Motion), 
the  papers  in  support  and  in  opposition,  and  the   record,  it 
appears  that: 1 
(1)  Williams  appeals  from  an  October  26,  2023  oral 
order  of  the  Hawai i  District   Court,   Third  Circuit,  Small  Claims 
Division   dismissing   his  claims; 
(2)  Costco  asks  the  court  to  dismiss  Williams's  appeal 
for  lack  of  jurisdiction,  to  suspend  all  appellate  deadlines,  and 
1 Though Williams' January 16, 2024 memorandum in opposition to the 
Motion and January 18, 2024 supporting declaration were untimely filed under 
Hawai i Rule s of Appellate Procedure Rules 26(a) and 27(a), the court 
considers the arguments therein, as self-represented litigants should not be 
automatically foreclosed from appellate review because they fail to comply 
with court rules. Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai i 368, 380-81, 465 P.3d 815, 
827-28 (2020).

to  grant  an  award  for  attorney's  fees  and  costs  in  bringing  the

small  claims  division.   Hawaii  Revised  Statutes  ยง  633-28(a) 
(2016);  see  also  Rule  12(b),  Rules  of  the  Small  Claims  Division 
of  the  District  Courts.

1. The appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
2. All other requested relief is denied.
