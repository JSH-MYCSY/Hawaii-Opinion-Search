IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
MARIA  LUISA  ESPINA,  Plaintiff-Appellee,  v. 
RONALD  SENO,  Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  FAMILY  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
(CASE  NO.  1DV191006856) 
SUMMARY   DISPOSITION   ORDER 
(By: Nakasone,
 Chief Judge, Leonard and Guidry, JJ.) 
Self-represented   Defendant-Appellant   Ronald  Seno  (Seno) 
appeals   from  the  October   6,  2023  Order  Imposing   Sanction 
(Sanctions   Order)  entered   by  the  Family  Court  of  the  First 
Circuit   (Family  Court).1 
Liberally construing Seno's opening brief (denominated 
as Opening Statement of [Seno]), Seno generally contends, inter 
alia, that the Family Court erred and abused its discretion in 
sanctioning Seno for failing to comply with the Family Court's 
June 14, 2023 Motion to Set Order (Pretrial Order No. 1) 
(Pretrial Order). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
1 The Honorable Courtney N. Naso presided.

         the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve this 
appeal as follows: 
As a preliminary matter, we note that under the 
collateral order doctrine, a party may immediately appeal from a 
sanctions order if the party is "in immediate jeopardy of being 
found in contempt of court if [it] did not comply with the order 
directing payment of the assessed sum." Siangco v. Kasadate , 77 
Hawai i 157, 161-62, 883  P.2d 78, 82-83 (1994) (internal 
quotation marks omitted). "A sanction order against a party is 
immediately enforceable through contempt proceedings only if the 
sanction order requires the party to pay the sanction in a 
specific amount by a specific day[.]"). Food Plan. Serv. Haw., 
Inc. v. Su Send Chang Tran, No. CAAP-18-0000359, 2018 WL 4579896, 
at *2 (App. Sept. 25, 2018) (Order). The Sanctions Order 
sanctioned Seno in a specific amount, payable by a date certain. 
Thus, this court has appellate jurisdiction. 
Seno challenges the Sanctions Order based on various 
arguments. "Hawai i courts have  the inherent power and authority 
to control the litigation process before them and to impose 
sanctions for abusive litigation practices. However, a trial 
court must exercise its inherent power to impose sanctions with 
restraint and discretion." LaPeter v. LaPeter , 144 Hawai i 295, 
309,
 439 P.3d 247, 261 (App. 2019) (citations and internal 
quotation marks omitted). "The sanctioning order should set 
forth findings that describe the perceived misconduct with 
reasonable specificity, and it must state the sanctioning 
authority ." Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawai i 368, 392,  465 P.3d 815, 
839 (2020) (emphasis added); see also LaPeter , 144 Hawai i at

     309,  439  P.3d  at  261  (sanction  orders  must  inform  the  party  of 
the  authority  for  the  sanction).  
The  Family  Court  states  in  its  January  11,  2024 
Findings  of  Fact  and  Conclusions  of  Law  that  it  sanctioned  Seno 
because  he 
did not file a (1) Settlement Conference Statement, (2) 
Property Allocation Chart, (3) Updated Asset & Debt 
Statement, (4) Updated Income and Expenses Statement, (5) 
proposed Child Support Guidelines Worksheet, nor did he 
submit a (6) Confidential Settlement Letter to the Court, 
which were all due to be filed or submitted to the Court on 
or before September 28, 2023[.] 
The  Sanctions  Order  cites  Hawai i  Family  Court  Rules  
(HFCR)  Rule  89  and  Rules  of  the  Circuit  Courts  of  the  State  of 
Hawai i  (RCCH)  Rule  15.   HFCR  Rule  89  and  RCCH  Rule  15 
collectively  authorize  sanctions  for  an  attorney's  failure  to 
notify  the  court  of  a  settlement,  to  timely  submit  court 
documents,  or  to  timely  appear  at  a  hearing.   However,  Seno  is 
not  an  attorney;  he  is  self-represented.   HFCR  Rule  89 and  RCCH  
Rule  15 do  not  authorize  the  sanctions  imposed.   As  the  cited 3 2 
2 HFCR Rule 89 provides: 
Rule 89. EXPEDITION OF COURT BUSINESS: SANCTIONS. 
(a) Required notice. Attorneys shall advise the 
court promptly if a case is settled. An attorney who fails 
to give the court such prompt advice may be subject to such 
sanction as the court deems appropriate. 
(b) Submission of documents, adherence to court 
policy. An attorney who, without good cause, fails to 
submit documents in a timely manner in accordance with these 
Rules, or who fails to adhere to these Rules or applicable 
statutes, may be subject to such sanction as the court deems 
appropriate. 
(c) Effect of failure to appear or tardiness. An 
attorney who, without good cause, fails to appear or is 
tardy when the attorney's case is before the court on call, 
motion, pre-trial or trial or who unjustifiably fails to 
prepare for a presentation to the court necessitating a 
continuance, may be subject to such sanction as the court 
deems appropriate. 
3 At the time the Sanctions Order was entered, RCCH Rule 15 provided 
(a subsequent rule change was ministerial):

        rules authorize sanctions only against attorneys, and do not 
authorize imposition of sanctions against a self-represented 
party, we conclude that the Family Court erred in entering the 
Sanctions Order against Seno. 
According, the Family Court's October 6, 2023 Sanctions 
Order is reversed. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending 
motions are dismissed. 
DATED:   Honolulu,  Hawai i,  February   5,  2026.

le 15. EXPEDITION OF COURT BUSINESS.

(b) Effect of failure to appear. An attorney who, 
without just cause, fails to appear when the attorney's case
