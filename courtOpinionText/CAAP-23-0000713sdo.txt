Self-represented  Defendant-Appellant  William   K. 
Medeiros,   Jr.,  (Medeiros )  appeals
  from  the  Writ  of  Possession 
(Writ)  and  the  Judgment  for  Possession  (Judgment ),  both  entered

Pogtis,  Jr.,  and  Carman  C.  Pogtis  Joint  Revocable  Trust  dated

         As  a  preliminary  matter,  we  note  that  the  Opening  Brief 
fails  to  comply  with  Hawai i  Rules  of   Appellate  Procedure  (HRAP) 
Rule  28(b)(4)  &  (7)  and  we  recognize  Iwamoto's  argument  that  the 
deficiencies  should  result  in  dismissal  of  this  appeal.   However, 
Hawai i  courts  have  "consistently  adhered  to  the  policy  of 
affording  litigants  the  opportunity  'to  have  their  cases  heard  on 
the  merits,  where  possible.'"   Morgan  v.  Plan.  Dep't,  Cnty.  of 
Kaua i,  104  Hawai i  173,  180-81,  86  P.3d  982,  989-990  (2004) 
(quoting  O'Connor  v.  Diocese  of  Honolulu,  77  Hawai i  383,  386, 
885  P.2d  361,  364  (1994)).   Thus,  we  will  consider  the  merits  of 
Medeiros's  appeal,  to  the  extent  discernible.   
Medeiros identifies four points
 of error on appeal, 
contending that the District Court erred in: (1) proceeding to 
ejectment without proof that Iwamoto had standing; (2) concluding 
that there was no issue of title; (3) not allowing Medeiros's 
brother Don Pogtis (Don) to "enter the complaint for ejectment"; 
and (4) not sending the case "back to the Probate Court for 
further proceedings, upon receiving the Last Will and Testament 
of Mildred Pogtis" (Mildred's Will). The second issue is 
dispositive. 
The key facts are as follows. On May 12, 2023, Iwamoto 
filed a complaint in the District Court, which included three 
counts: (1) summary possession; (2) assumpsit; and (3) damages. 
Medeiros filed an answer denying Iwamoto's right to summary 
possession and, inter alia, claiming to be an "undivided interest 
owner" of the Property. 
On July 10, 2023, Don, also self-represented, filed an 
"Ex Parte Motion of Position Statement for Ejectment of William

       Medeiros, Jr.,  filed May 12, 2023." While "not a name party" to 
the Complaint, Don sought "to protect" Medeiros from eviction, 
stating that Iwamoto held no ownership interest in the Property. 
Attached to Don's "motion" was a signed "Declaration of Don 
Pogtis Sr.", declaring that Medeiros "is my brother and a son of 
Mildred[.]" Don attached copies of the Will of Alfred Pogtis, 
Sr. (Alfred, Sr.) and Mildred's Will. 
On August 12, 2023, Iwamoto filed "Plaintiff's 
Submission that Title Is Not in Issue" (Iwamoto's Title 
Submission ), arguing that Medeiros's "claim that title is in 
issue is NOT warranted." 
On August 14, 2023, Don filed "Defendant Don Pogtis, 
Sr. Motion in Support of William Kalani Medeiros Jr., Position 
Statement in Compliance to [District Court Rules of Civil 
Procedure (DCRCP)] Rule 12.1 and (h) Defense of Title." Don 
referred to himself as a "Defendant" and his siblings as 
"Potential Parties of Interest" in the Property. Don further 
alleged that Iwamoto "failed to service [sic] notice" to him. 
On August 21, 2023, Medeiros filed "William Medeiros 
Jr., Position Statement in Compliance to DCRCP Rule 12.1 and (h) 
Defense of Title" (Rule 12.1 Motion). The motion identified 
Alfred, Sr., as having bequeathed the Property to Mildred, who in 
turn bequeathed the Property to Alfred Pogtis, Jr. (Alfred, Jr.) 
"and not to his heirs." Medeiros contended that he and Don stood 
to inherit according to the terms of Mildred's Will. Attached to 
the Rule 12.1 Motion was a "Declaration of William Medeiros" 
(Rule 12.1 Declaration ) submitted "under the law of perjury," 
attaching and identifying Alfred, Sr.'s death certificate, along

  with Alfred, Sr. and Mildred's Wills. Medeiros signed with "/s/" 
above his typed name. 
In opposition to the Rule 12.1 Motion, Iwamoto argued 
that the Rule 12.1 Motion and Rule 12.1 Declaration were not 
sufficient to comply with DCRCP 12.1, and did not provide the 
court with "particulars to fully apprise the court of the nature 
of [Medeiros's] claim." Iwamoto further argued that Medeiros 
misinterpreted Mildred's Will, Mildred had intended to bequeath 
the Property to Alfred, Jr. only, and thus title was not in 
issue. 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 604-5(d) (2016) 
provides in part: "The district courts shall not have cognizance 
of real action, nor actions in which the title to real estate 
comes in question[.]" 
DCRCP Rule 12.1 states: 
Rule 12.1. DEFENSE OF TITLE IN DISTRICT COURTS. 
Pleadings. Whenever, in the district court, in 
defense of an action in the nature of an action of trespass 
or for the summary possession of land, or any other action, 
the defendant shall seek to interpose a defense to the 
jurisdiction to the effect that the action is a real action, 
or one in which the title to real estate is involved, such 
defense shall be asserted by a written answer or written 
motion, which shall not be received by the court unless 
accompanied by an affidavit of the defendant, setting forth 
the source, nature and extent of the title claimed by 
defendant to the land in question, and such further 
particulars as shall fully apprise the court of the nature 
of defendant's claim. 
Read together,  the Rule 12.1 Motion and Rule 12.1
Declaration  set  forth  the  source  of  Medeiros's  claim  of  title  as 
Mildred's  Will,  the  nature  of  the  claim  as,  in  essence,  that 
Alfred  Jr.  only  received  a  life  estate,  and  the  extent  of  title 
claimed  as  an  undivided  interest  in  the  Property  with  Don.  
Regardless  of  the  ultimate  strength  or  weakness  of  Medeiros's 
claim  to  title,  we  conclude  that  he  sufficiently  raised  the

      claim, thus depriving the District Court of jurisdiction pursuant 
to HRS § 604-5. Accordingly, and based on the entire record 
before us, we further conclude that the District Court erred in 
entering judgment against Medeiros. In light of this conclusion, 
we need not reach Medeiros's other arguments. 
For  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  District  Court's  
November  13,  2023  Writ  of  Possession  and  the  Judgment  for 
Possession  are  vacated.   This  case  is  remanded  to  the  District 
Court  for  further  proceedings  consistent  with  this  Summary 
Disposition  Order,  e.g.,  a  voluntary  dismissal  or  a  sua  sponte 
dismissal  by  the  District  Court.   See  Captain  Andy's  Sailing,
