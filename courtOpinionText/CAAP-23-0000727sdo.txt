LONNELL REGINALD WIDEMAN, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v. 
HMS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CCV-22-0001659) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Guidry, JJ.) 
Lonnell Reginald Wideman, representing himself, appeals 
from the Order Granting HMS's Motion to Compel Arbitration and 
Dismissing the Complaint  entered by the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit.  We affirm. 
1
Wideman sued HMS Construction, Inc. 
He alleged he 
belonged to the Laborers' International Union of North America,
Local 368 ; Local 368 had a collective bargaining agreement ( CBA) 
with HMS; Local 368 dispatched him to HMS to work on the West Oahu Solar Project for six months; two other dispatched laborers started to work, but HMS didn't allow him to work and didn't send him back to Local 368, in violation of the CBA. 
1 The Honorable John M. Tonaki presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HMS moved to compel arbitration and dismiss Wideman's 
complaint. The circuit court granted the motion and dismissed 
the complaint by order entered on December 1, 2023. This appeal followed. 
We review a ruling on a motion to compel arbitration de 
novo. Douglass v. Pflueger Haw., Inc. , 110 Hawai #i 520, 524, 135 
P.3d 129, 133 (2006). A court deciding a motion to compel arbitration must answer two questions: (1) does an arbitration agreement exist between the parties; and (2) if so, is the subject matter of the dispute arbitrable under the agreement. Id. at 530, 135 P.3d at 139. 
Wideman does not dispute he was a Local 368 member; he 
was referred to HMS by Local 368; Local 368 and HMS were parties to the CBA; and the CBA contained a grievance procedure that included an arbitration provision. 
He argues he "never signed a 
contract or agreement that would encompass [him] as a union member to automatically arbitrate any issues that may arise out of employment with any said contractors who have a collective bargaining agreement with the labor union local 368." 
As a union member covered by the CBA, Wideman is bound 
by the CBA, including its grievance procedure. Poe v. Haw. Lab. 
Rels. Bd. , 105 Hawai #i 97, 99, 94 P.3d 652, 654 (2004) ("As a 
member of Bargaining Unit 3 (BU 03) of HGEA, Poe was bound by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement between Employer and HGEA."). 
Wideman argues "there is no enforceable agreement or 
conditions, between [him] and HMS Contractors to arbitrate this, or any particular dispute." He cites Douglass ; 
Brown v. KFC 
National Management Co. , 82 Hawai #i 226, 921 P.2d 146 (1996); and 
Siopes v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. , 130 Hawaii # 437, 
312 P.3d 869 (2013). 
None of those cases involved collective 
bargaining agreements. This one does, and Poe  is dispositive.
