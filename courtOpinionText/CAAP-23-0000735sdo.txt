(CASE NO. 2CCV-22-0000065(2))  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: 
Leonard, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Duarte N. Lima appeals from the 
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's September 26, 2025 First 
Amended Final Judgment in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Harold G. 
Davis and against Lima and Defendants Steve Warsh, Maui Pools   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  
 
   
 
 
 Design & Masonry, LLC, DBA Maui Meadows Pools and Masonry, LLC, 
and Acacia Homes Construction & Remodeling, LLC.1 
On appeal, Lima raises five points of error 
challenging: (1) the entry of default; (2) the denial of his 
motion to set aside and motion for reconsideration; (3) the 
default judgment; (4) the $191,151.73 in contract damages; and 
(5) the attorneys' fees in excess of the 25% allowed under 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 607-14 (2016). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this 
appeal as discussed below and vacate and remand. 
Davis contracted Warsh to build a custom pool at 
Davis's home in Wailuku, Maui. The contract price was $163,415.62. After a dispute arose between Davis and Warsh, 
1 The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided. The circuit court assigned 
the Honorable Kelsey T. Kawano to preside over the settlement conference. 
Lima appealed from the circuit court's December 11, 2023 Judgment, 
which was superseded by the September 26, 2025 First Amended Final Judgment. 
Lima also appeals from various  underlying  orders, including (1)  the 
Settlement Judge's November 30, 2022 oral ruling finding Lima and the other 
Defendants  in default; (2)  the January 17, 2023 "Order Entering Default 
Against All Defendants as to All Claims"; (3)  the February 17, 2023 "Order 
Denying Defendant Duarte Lima's Motion to Set Aside the Order Entering 
Default Against All Defendants as to All Claims Filed January 17, 2023"; 
(4)  the September 19, 2023 "Order Denying Defendant Duarte Lima's Motion for 
Reconsideration and Granting Motion for Default Judgment Against Steve Warsh, 
Maui Pools Design & Masonry, LLC, and Acacia Homes Construction & Remodeling,  
LLC as to All Claims"; (5)  the  November 24, 2023 "Findings of Fact and 
Conclusions of Law and Order"; and (6)  the  Decem
ber 8, 2023  "Order Awarding 
Attorneys' Fees and Costs".  
2   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 Warsh did not complete construction of the pool. Davis claims 
he spent an additional $27,736.11 above the contract price to 
finish building the pool.2 
Davis, then self-represented, filed suit against the 
Defendants seeking general, special, and punitive damages. The 
circuit court entered an order scheduling a settlement 
conference with another judge (Settlement Judge) and a non-jury 
trial. Under the order, the parties were required to "deliver directly to the settlement judge a confidential settlement 
conference letter" (Confidential Letter). 
At the settlement conference, there were no 
Confidential Letters submitted by the Defendants, who were also 
self-represented. Lima maintained that there was nothing for 
him to settle because he was not part of the contract between 
Warsh and Davis. The Settlement Judge stated, "So Mr. Lima is 
out with regard to any kind of settlement discussion." The 
Settlement Judge then continued the conference ordering the Defendants to submit their Confidential Letters pursuant to 
Rule 12.2(b) of the Rules of the Circuit Court of the State of 
Hawaiʻi (RCCH). Lima acknowledged he understood. 
At the continued conference, the Defendants again 
submitted no Confidential Letters to the Settlement Judge. 
2 The alleged total expense of completing the pool, $191,151.73, less 
the contract price, $163,415.62, equals the additional expense, $27,736.11. 
3   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 Instead, Lima and Warsh each submitted letters addressed to the 
circuit court judge, which the circuit court clerk treated as ex 
parte communication, filing the letters and serving the letters 
upon all parties. 
Lima explained to the Settlement Judge that his 
failure to comply resulted from his misunderstanding that the 
circuit court would preside over the case and that the 
Settlement Judge was only "a stand-in for the day." 
Warsh 
explained that he tried to comply by filing in person, "thinking 
that that was the safest, most expedient way to get it done, 
well ahead of the deadline." 
When the Settlement Judge threatened defaulting Warsh 
and Lima, Warsh argued for another opportunity to comply: "We 
were unaware of that. We did not thumb our nose at anything, 
and we thought we were complying. It was out of ignorance, not 
out of lack of respect. I'm asking you to give us one more 
opportunity." 
The Settlement Judge then asked Davis if he was 
willing to accept the $7,500.00 Warsh offered in his letter to the circuit court. Davis rejected the offer. Lima's letter to 
the circuit court made no offer to settle on the basis that he 
was not party to the contract. 
The Settlement Judge found Lima and Warsh "in utter 
noncompliance" and entered default against all Defendants.

 Lima, then represented by counsel, moved to set aside the entry 
of default, which the circuit court denied. Lima then moved for 
reconsideration, which the circuit court also denied. 
Ultimately, the circuit court entered judgment in 
favor of Davis and against the Defendants, awarding over a half-
million dollars in money damages, including contract damages, 
treble damages, and attorneys' fees and costs. The circuit 
court, however, limited Lima's liability to $191,151.73 in damages
3 and $51,217.68 in attorneys' fees and costs, jointly and 
severally liable with the other Defendants. 
On appeal, Lima raises five points of error, but his 
first point is dispositive. 
In his first point of error, Lima contends that none 
of the enumerated conditions under RCCH Rule 12.2 "for imposing sanctions include failure to submit a settlement conference 
statement." Lima argues that RCCH Rule 12.2 should be strictly 
construed to not permit sanctions under the facts of this case because courts have construed identical language in RCCH 
Rule 12.1 as only permitting sanctions where one of the three 
conditions expressly imposed by the rule were met: 
3 It appears that the circuit court awarded Davis the full contract 
price for the pool in addition to the cost Davis claims he expended to 
complete the pool.

 Pursuant to clause (6) of RCCH Rule 12.1(a), one of three 
conditions must be present to trigger the imposition of 
sanctions: (1) a party or his or her attorney must fail to 
appear at a scheduled settlement conference; (2) a party or his or her attorney must neglect to discuss or attempt to 
negotiate a settlement prior to the conference; or (3) a 
party must fail to have a person authorized to settle the 
case present at the conference. 
Kamaunu v. Kaaea, 99 Hawaiʻ i 432, 440, 56 P.3d 734, 742 
(App. 2002), aff'd, 99 Hawai
ʻi 503, 57 P.3d 428 (2002).  Lima's 
argument has merit. 
This court reviews an award of RCCH Rule 12.2 
sanctions under the abuse of discretion standard. 
See Canalez 
v. Bob's Appliance Serv. Ctr., Inc., 89 Hawaiʻ i 292, 300, 972 
P.2d 295, 303 (1999) (discussing standard of review for 
sanctions under identical language in RCCH Rule 12.1(a)(6)). 
"A 
court abuses its discretion whenever it exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles of law or practice to 
the substantial detriment of a party." Dela Cruz v. Quemado, 
141 Hawaiʻ i 338, 344, 409 P.3d 742, 748 (2018) (ellipsis omitted) 
(quoting Shanghai Inv. Co. v. Alteka Co., 92 Hawaiʻ i 482, 491-92, 
993 P.2d 516, 525-26 (2000)). 
Here, the Settlement Judge sanctioned Lima for failing 
to file a Confidential Letter under RCCH Rule 12.2(a)(6). RCCH 
Rule 12.2(a)(6) allows for sanctions when (1) the party or 
party's attorney fails to appear at the settlement conference, 
(2) the party or party's attorney neglects to negotiate prior to 
the conference, or (3) the party fails to have someone

 authorized to settle present at the conference.4 Failing to file 
a Confidential Letter is not one of the permitted reasons for 
sanctioning a party under RCCH Rule 12.2(a)(6). 
In an attempt to show the Settlement Judge did not 
abuse his discretion, Davis cites Dela Cruz and Rearden Family 
Trust v. Wisenbaker, 101 Hawaiʻ i 237, 65 P.3d 1029 (2003), as 
contrary authority that sanctions are permissible under RCCH 
Rule 12.2(a)(6) "when the defaulted party neglects to obey the 
court's orders, either intentionally or negligently, or when 
parties negotiate in bad faith." 
Both Dela Cruz and Rearden involved a failure to 
appear for a settlement conference, not a failure to file a 
4 RCCH Rule 12.2(a)(6), "Sanctions," provides: 
The failure of a party or the party's attorney to 
appear at a scheduled settlement conference, the neglect of 
a party or the party's attorney to discuss or attempt to 
negotiate a settlement prior to the conference, or the failure of a party to have a person authorized to settle 
the case present at the conference shall, unless a good 
cause for such failure or neglect is shown, be deemed an undue interference with orderly procedures. As sanctions, 
the court may, in its discretion: 
(i) Dismiss the action on its own motion, or on the 
motion of any party, or hold a party in 
default, as the case may be; 
(ii) Order a party to pay the opposing party's reasonable expenses and attorneys' fees; 
(iii) Order a change in the calendar status of the 
action; and/or 
(iv) Impose any other sanction as may be appropriate. 
(Formatting altered and emphasis added.)

  Confidential Letter. Sanctions for failure to appear are 
expressly contemplated under RCCH Rule 12.2(a)(6). As such, 
both Dela Cruz and Rearden are materially distinguishable. 
Conversely, in Kamaunu, this court construed the identical 
language of RCCH Rule 12.1(a)(6) as not permitting sanctions for 
failing to make a pretrial monetary settlement offer. 99 Hawaiʻ i 
at 440, 56 P.3d at 742. 
And even if the failure to file a Confidential Letter 
were sanctionable pursuant to other authority,5 the circuit court 
nevertheless abused its discretion in so doing under the five-
factor test adopted in Weinberg v. Dickson-Weinberg, 123 Hawaiʻ i 
68, 71, 229 P.3d 1133, 1136 (2010). 
In Weinberg, the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court adopted the 
Ninth Circuit's five-factor test to determine on appellate 
review whether "a discovery sanction constitutes an abuse of 
discretion." 123 Hawaiʻ i at 71, 2
29 P.3d at 1136.  Under that 
test, the relevant factors are: "(1) the public's interest in 
the expeditious resolution of litigation; (2) the court's need 
to manage its docket; (3) the risk of prejudice to the party 
5 Here, because the circuit court's scheduling order requiring the 
Confidential Letters was entered pursuant to Hawaiʻ i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP
) Rule 16, entry of sanctions, including default, may have been proper 
under subsection (f) of that rule for "fail[ure] to obey a scheduling or 
pretrial order." HRCP Rule 16(f) (allowing sanctions as set forth in HRCP 
Rule 37(b)(2)(B)- (D) governing discovery); Rearden, 
101 Hawaiʻi at 253, 65 
P.3d at 1045. 
However, this argument was not raised below or in the briefing 
and so is waived on appeal. Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived.").

 moving for sanctions; (4) the public policy favoring disposition 
of cases on their merits; and (5) the availability of less 
drastic sanctions." Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting W.H. 
Shipman, Ltd. v. Hawaiian Holiday Macadamia Nut Co., 8 Haw. App. 
354, 362, 802 P.2d 1203, 1207 (App. 1990) (quoting United States 
ex rel. Wiltec Guam, Inc. v. Kahaluu Constr. Co., 857 F.2d 600, 
603 (9th Cir. 1988))). 
Applying the five-factor test here, the first and 
second factors both weigh in favor of default because the default expedited resolution of the case. See Kamaunu, 99 
Hawaiʻi at 444, 56 P.3d at 746 (concluding the first two factors 
weighed against default where trial was still required despite 
default). 
However, beyond that, the last three factors all 
weigh against default. 
On the third factor, Davis was not prejudiced by 
Lima's conduct because the failure to file a Confidential Letter did not "impair[ Davis's] ability to go to trial or threaten[] 
to interfere with the rightful decision of the case." W.H. 
Shipman, Ltd., 8 Haw. App. at 364, 802 P.2d at 1208 (quoting 
Kahaluu Constr. Co.
, 857 F.2d at 604). 
On the fourth factor, public policy "weighs heavily" 
against default. See Kamaunu
, 99 Hawaiʻi at 444, 56 P.3d at 746 
(concluding public policy of hearing cases on the merits "weighs 
heavily" against default); 
see, e.g., Chen v. Mah
, 146 Hawaiʻi 
9   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
   157, 176, 457 P.3d 796, 815 (2020) (citing BDM, Inc. v. Sageco, 
Inc., 57 Haw. 73, 76, 549 P.2d 1147, 1150 (1976); County of 
Hawaiʻi v. Ala Loop Homeowners, 123 Hawaiʻ i 391, 423, 235 P.3d 
1103, 1135 (2010)) ("Our cases have also expressed our policy of 
disfavoring defaults and default judgments and of resolving any 
doubt in favor of the party seeking relief, so that, in the 
interests of justice, there can be a full trial on the 
merits."). 
Finally, on the fifth factor, the availability of 
"less drastic sanctions" weighs against default because any 
prejudice suffered by Davis as a result of Lima's failure to 
comply with the circuit court and the Settlement Judge's orders could have been remedied through the imposition of appropriate 
monetary sanctions such as Davis's expenses for the two 
conferences where Lima did not comply with the circuit court's 
order. See Kamaunu, 99 Hawaiʻ i at 444, 56 P.3d at 746 
(concluding that where less "drastic" sanctions than default are 
available, the fifth factor weighs against default). 
Thus, on balance, the entry of default was an abuse of 
discretion. On remand, Lima is returned to the same position as 
before the error occurred. See Gurrobat v. HTH Corp.
, 135 
Hawaiʻi 128, 134, 346 P.3d 197, 203 (2015) (citing 
Nelson v. 
10   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
   
 
 
 Univ. of Hawaiʻ i, 99 Hawaiʻ i  262, 267, 54 P.3d 433, 438 (2002)). 
As such, we need not reach Lima's remaining points of error. 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the circuit court's 
September 26, 2025 First Amended Final Judgment and underlying orders, and remand this case for further proceedings consistent 
with this summary disposition order.
