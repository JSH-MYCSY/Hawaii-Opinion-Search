APPEAL  FROM  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
HONOLULU  DIVISION 
(CASE  NO.  1DCW-17-0002263) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka  and  Guidry,  JJ.) 
Upon review
 of the record, it appears that: 
(1) The statement of jurisdiction and opening brief 
were due on or before February 23, 2024, and March 25, 2024, 
respectively; 
(2) Self-represented Defendant-Appellant LeRoy L. 
Bolden (Bolden) failed to file either document, or request an 
extension of time; 
(3) On
 April 9, 2024, the appellate clerk entered an 
amended default notice informing Bolden that the time for filing 
the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired, the 
matter would be called to the court's attention on April 19, 
2024, for appropriate action, which could include dismissal of 
the appeal, under Hawai i Rules  of Appellate Procedure Rules 
12.1(e) and 30, and Bolden could request relief from default by 
motion; and 
(4) Since the appellate clerk entered the amended 
default notice, Bolden has not taken any further action in this 
appeal.

dismissed.
