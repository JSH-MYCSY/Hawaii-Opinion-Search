the appeal, under Hawai i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP)
Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and Levitz could request relief from
default by motion;
(4) Levitz has not taken any further action in this
appeal;
(5) On January 16, 2024, the court ordered Deputy
Attorney General Winston I. Wong (Wong) to file, within ten days
from the order, a declaration, affidavit, or certificate of
service indicating Wong's January 10, 2024 letter, which the
court construed as a motion to withdraw as counsel, under HRAP
Rule 50(a), was provided to the client, or that the client was
otherwise informed of Deputy Attorneys General Gary Shiro
Suganuma, Patrick K. Kelly, and Teresa Dawn Zetwick's withdrawal;
(6) Wong did not file a response to the January 16,
2024 order;1 and
(7) On March 27, 2024, Deputy Attorneys General Nathan
S.C. Chee and Joshua J. Michaels filed a letter, which the court
construes as a motion to withdraw Wong as counsel for Defendant-
Appellee State of Hawai i, Department of Taxation, under HRAP
Rule 50(a).  Like Wong's January 10, 2024 letter, the March 27,
2024 letter does not specify whether the client was informed of
the withdrawal of counsel.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
dismissed.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are
dismissed.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerk shall
mail a copy of this order to Wong at his address on file with the
Hawaii State Bar Association. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai i, April 5, 2024.
