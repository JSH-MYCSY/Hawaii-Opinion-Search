DALE G. BASGALL, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2FFC-21-0000007) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Nakasone, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Guidry, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Dale G. Basgall (Basgall) appeals 
from the Family Court of the Second Circuit's (family court) 
November 29, 2023 "Judgment and Sentence of the Court" 
(Judgment).   1
On January 5, 2021, Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawaiʻ i 
(
State) filed a "Felony Information and Non-Felony Complaint" 
(Complaint), charging Basgall with Felony Abuse of Family or 
Household Member, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
1 The Honorable Michelle L. Drewyer presided.   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
   
  § 709-906(1) (2014) and/or (8) (2014) (Count 1), Abuse of Family 
or Household Member, in violation of HRS § 709-906(1) and/or 
(5)(a) (2014) (
Count 2), and Terroristic Threatening in the 
Second Degree, in violation of HRS § 707-717(1) (2014) (Count 3). A jury found Basgall guilty of Count 2, and not guilty of 
Counts 1 and 3. The family court sentenced Basgall to two years 
of probation. 
Basgall raises three points of error on appeal, 
contending: (1) the family court erred by "failing to suppress Basgall's second statement," because it was "the tainted fruit" 
of Basgall's first statement, which the family court had found 
to be inadmissible; (2) the family court made "cumulative 
errors" that were not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; and 
(3) ineffective assistance of counsel.  
Upon careful review of the record, briefs, and 
relevant legal authorities, and having given due consideration 
to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve Basgall's contentions of error as follows: 
(1) Basgall contends that the family court erred in 
admitting his second statement to the Maui Police Department 
(MPD). He contends that his second statement was "the tainted 
fruit" of his first statement because it "resulted from the 
'exploitation' of [his inadmissible first statement]." We 
review the family court's admission of Basgall's second 
2   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 statement de novo under the right/wrong standard. State v.
Heggland, 118 Hawaiʻ i 425, 434, 193 P.3d 341, 350 (2008). 
Under the federal and state constitutions, "[t]he 
fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine prohibits the use of 
evidence at trial which comes to light as a result of the 
exploitation of a previous illegal act of the police." 
State v.
Lee, 149 Hawaiʻ i 45, 50, 481 P.3d 52, 57 (2021) (cleaned up). 
"Where the government proves that the evidence was discovered 
through information from an independent source or where the 
connection between the illegal acts and the discovery of the 
evidence is so attenuated that the taint has been dissipated, 
the evidence is not a 'fruit' and, therefore, is admissible." 
State v. Fukusaku, 85 
Hawaiʻi 462, 475, 946 P.2d 32, 45 (1997) 
(citations omitted). 
"[E]vidence must first be objected to as being the 
'fruit' before the government can be expected to prove that it 
was discovered through an independent source." Id. (cleaned 
up). 
The record reflects that Basgall did not move to exclude 
his second statement, and, as defense counsel represented, Basgall in fact "want[ed] that statement to come in." See
State v. Poaipuni
, 98 Hawaiʻi 387, 394, 49 P.3d 353, 360 (2002) 
(holding that the circuit court did not plainly err where the 
defendant did not seek to exclude his inculpatory statement as 
tainted fruit).

 We therefore conclude that the family court did not 
err by admitting the second statement. 
(2 & 3) Basgall contends, inter alia, that the family 
court erred "in concluding that Basgall's [defense] counsel had 
opened the door regarding prior bad acts of Basgall during his 
cross-examination of [the complaining witness's (CW) daughter 
(Daughter)]." The State agrees and concedes error.2 We review 
the family court's conclusion de novo under the right/wrong 
standard. State v. Miranda, 147 Hawaiʻ i 171, 179, 465 P.3d 618, 
626 (2020). 
Under the "opening the door" doctrine,3 when one party 
presents inadmissible evidence, the opposing party may "adduce 
pertinent evidence that would otherwise be inadmissible" as a 
rebuttal. Id. at 183, 465 P.3d at 630 (citation omitted). "The 
extent of this doctrine is limited, [however,] and it does not allow a party to adduce inadmissible evidence for the purpose of 
rebutting inferences raised by the introduction of admissible 
evidence." Id. (citations omitted). 
2 We note that the State's concession of error is not binding on 
this court. In " confession of error" cases, appellate courts have an 
independent duty " first[,] to ascertain that the confession of error is 
supported by the record and well- founded in law[,] and second[,] to determine 
that such error is properly preserved and prejudicial." State v. Hoang, 93 
Hawaiʻi 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000) (cleaned up). 
3 Hawaiʻi has not adopted the " opening the door" doctrine. Miranda, 
147 Hawaiʻ i at 183 n.13, 465 P.3d at 630 n.13. We need not decide whether 
Hawaiʻi should adopt the doctrine because it does not apply to this case. See 
id. at 184 n.14, 465 P.3d at 631 n.14.

   The record reflects that defense counsel, during his 
cross-examination of Daughter, introduced the video recording of 
an MPD interview, in which Daughter referenced CW's history of 
concussions : 4
THE OFFICER:  So you're --  you're not seriously 
injured? You don't need medics or anything right now, do 
you?  
[CW]:   I was thinking maybe a pain pill sometime 
soon, but I was --  yeah, because I'm going to start feeling 
pain  -- 
[Daughter]:  Yeah, she's --  she's had a lot of 
concussions --  
[CW]:   -- sooner than later.  
[Daughter]:  -- in her lifetime, but we don't go --  we 
can't afford medical attention.  
[CW]:   No, it's not necessary really.  
(Emphasis added.) 
After the recording was played, defense counsel asked 
Daughter, "Now, when you made [that] statement[,] . . . were you 
talking about previous concussions?" 
Daughter responded, "Yes." 
The State did not object. The question was admissible to clarify that Daughter was not saying CW sustained a concussion 
during the incident in question. 
The State, during re-direct examination, asked 
Daughter whether CW's multiple concussions were of "[CW's] own doing," and whether Daughter knew who caused those concussions. 
Basgall objected. 
The State argued that defense counsel's 
cross-examination had "opened the door" to the State's 
4 The State stipulated to the admission of Defense Exhibits M- 1 
through M- 13 into evidence, which included the video recording.

 questions. The family court overruled Basgall's objection, and 
Daughter testified that Basgall had "caused those concussions." 
We conclude that Basgall's introduction of admissible 
evidence regarding CW's concussions did not "open the door" to 
the State's inadmissible evidence of Basgall's prior bad acts. 
See Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 404(b) (prohibiting the 
admission of "[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts . . . 
to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith"). 
We therefore vacate the Judgment, and remand for 
further proceedings consistent with this summary disposition 
order. In light of our conclusion above, we decline to address 
the additional arguments that Basgall raises in point of error 
(2). We further decline to address Basgall's point of error 
(3), which asks this court to vacate the Judgment on the basis 
of ineffective assistance of counsel. See State v. Cordeiro, 
99 Hawaiʻ i 390, 428, 56 P.3d 692, 730 (2002).
