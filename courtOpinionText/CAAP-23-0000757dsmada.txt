 BACKGROUND 
LPIHGC and Nordic PCL Construction, Inc. arbitrated a 
construction dispute. LPIHGC filed the proceeding below in 2010 
to confirm the 2010 Award . 
Nordic moved to vacate the award. 
The circuit court granted LPIHGC's motion to confirm, denied Nordic's motion to vacate, and entered a judgment on the 2010 Award.
2 Nordic appealed. We vacated the order and the judgment 
"[o]n the basis of [the arbitrator]'s failure to disclose certain financial and other relationships with counsel[.]" In re Arb. of 
Nordic PCL Constr., Inc. v. LPIHGC, LLC , No. CAAP-11-0000350, 
2014 WL 624870, at *1 (Haw. App. Feb. 14, 2014) (mem. op.). LPIHGC applied for certiorari. The supreme court granted the application and remanded for the circuit court to conduct an evidentiary hearing because "the factual and/or legal bases upon which the circuit court denied the motion to vacate are unascertainable."

II. DISCUSSION 
A. The Circuit Court's March 3, 2017 Findings of
Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Was anAppealable Final Order 
In an HRS Chapter 658A special proceeding, an appeal 
may be taken from: 
(1) An order denying a motion to compel arbitration; 
(2) An order granting a motion to stay arbitration; 
(3) An order confirming or denying confirmation of an
award; 
(4) An order modifying or correcting an award; 
(5) An order vacating an award without directing a
rehearing ; or 
(6) A final judgment entered pursuant to this chapter. 
HRS § 658A-28(a) (2016) (emphasis added). 
In State of Hawaii Organization of Police Officers 
(SHOPO) v. County of Kaua #i, 123 Hawai #i 128, 230 P.3d 428 (App. 
2010), SHOPO and the County arbitrated an employment dispute. 
SHOPO moved to confirm the award. 
The County moved to vacate it. 
The circuit court denied SHOPO's motion to confirm but only partially granted the County's motion to vacate. The court sent the dispute back to the arbitrator "to rehear the issue of what remedy is appropriate" and "possibly modify the remedy for [SHOPO]." Id. at 128–29, 230 P.3d at 428–29. SHOPO appealed. 
We adopted the view of the majority of jurisdictions that had adopted the Uniform Arbitration Act,
7 and held that the order 
7 Hawai#i adopted the Uniform Arbitration Act in 2001. 2001 Haw. 
Sess. Laws Act 265, § 1 at 810-820. 
4  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
denying SHOPO's motion to confirm was not an appealable order 
"under the circumstances of this case[.]" Id. at 129, 230 P.3d at 429. 
We cited Karcher Firestopping v. Meadow Valley 
Contractors, Inc. , 204 P.3d 1262 (Nev. 2009), which discussed the 
approaches taken by other Uniform Arbitration Act jurisdictions. In Karcher , the district court denied a motion to confirm an 
award, granted a motion to vacate the award, "and referred the matter back to arbitration for supplemental proceedings ." 204 
P.3d at 1263 (emphasis added). Under those circumstances, the Nevada Supreme Court noted "the district court's order vacating the arbitration award and remanding for supplemental proceedings extended, rather than concluded, the arbitration process[.]" Id. 
at 1266. The supreme court concluded the order denying confirmation was not "sufficiently final to be suitable for appellate review," and it lacked jurisdiction over the appeal. Id. 
Here, the circuit court's March 3, 2017 Findings of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order did not remand the dispute to the same arbitrator for supplemental proceedings. It terminated one arbitration process by completely vacating the 2010 Award "and all other rulings of the arbitrator[.]" The circuit court ordered a "rehearing," appropriately using the word in HRS § 658A-23(c). But the new arbitrator was to rehear the entire dispute, and was not bound by the former arbitrator's findings, conclusions, or decision. Under these circumstances, the 
5 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
March 3, 2017 order denying LPIHGC's motion to confirm the award 
was a final order ending the proceeding from which LPIHGC could have appealed under HRS § 658A-28(a)(3). Had LPIHGC wanted to defend the 2010 Award and challenge the circuit court's findings, conclusions, and order on the original arbitrator's evident partiality, it could have done so before incurring the time and expense of new arbitration proceedings. A contrary holding — requiring the parties to arbitrate all over again before LPIHGC could appeal from the circuit court's findings, conclusions, and order vacating the 2010 Award — would force the parties to waste time and resources. 
The Texas Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion in 
East Texas Salt Water Disposal Co. v. Werline , 307 S.W.3d 267 
(Tex. 2010).
8 The supreme court framed the issue as "whether the 
Texas General Arbitration Act (TAA) allows an appeal from a trial court's order that denies confirmation of an arbitration award and instead, vacates the award and directs that the dispute be arbitrated anew."
9 Id. at 268 (footnote omitted). There, East 
Texas and Werline arbitrated an employment dispute. The arbitrator made an award for Werline. Werline moved to confirm. East Texas moved to vacate. The district court denied confirmation, vacated the award, and ordered that the dispute be

E. Tex. Salt Water Disposal Co. , 209 S.W.3d 888 (Tex. App. 2006), aff'd sub 
nom. E. Tex. Salt Water Disposal Co. v. Werline , 307 S.W.3d 267 (Tex. 2010).
Karcher, 204 P.3d at 1265.

substance and structure. See E. Texas , 307 S.W.3d at 270.

"re-submitted to arbitration by a new arbitrator[.]" Id. at 269. 
Werline appealed. The court of appeals held there was evidence to support the award, reversed the district court, and confirmed the award. Id. at 269-70. East Texas petitioned for review, challenging only the court of appeals' jurisdiction. It argued that although TAA § 171.098(a)(3) allowed an appeal from an order denying confirmation of an award, subsection (5) implied that an order vacating an award and directing a rehearing was not 
appealable, creating an exception to subsection (3). Id. at 270. The Texas Supreme Court disagreed. Pertinent to this case, the supreme court held: 
In denying Werline's request for confirmation of the award,
the district court made clear that it rejected the award andall bases on which it rested. . . . 
When an arbitration award is unclear or incomplete or
contains an obvious error, a limited rehearing to correctthe problem is but a preface to determining confirmation,not a decision on the issue. If, for example, thearbitrator's award required clarification or interpretation,a rehearing for that limited purpose would not necessarilybe a denial of confirmation of the award, but merely adeferral of final ruling until the arbitration was complete.
When rehearing is necessary for the issue of confirmation to
be fully presented, vacatur pending rehearing is notappealable, not because the order falls outside 
subsection (5), but because it falls outside subsection (3)
and the rest of section 171.098(a). 
Id. at 270-71 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). 
A concurring justice noted: 
[P]recluding appeal from an order vacating an arbitration
award and requiring re-arbitration works an odd result, asthis case illustrates. Having incurred the expense of onearbitration and one court proceeding, the parties have beenordered to do it all over again. . . . [A] secondarbitration and second confirmation proceeding would beadditional, wasted expense to the parties. They would thenface the delay and expense of a second appellate proceeding,just to arrive where they are now: with the first awardconfirmed, as the court of appeals has held it should have 
7 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
been, a result the Company has not chosen to contest in this
Court. 
Id. at 275 (Willett, J., concurring). 
The Texas Supreme Court's reasoning in E. Texas  is 
consistent with our holding in SHOPO . The circuit court's order 
in SHOPO  (remanding for the arbitrator to rehear and possibly 
modify SHOPO's remedy) was not appealable because it wasn't a 
final order denying confirmation under HRS § 658A-28(a)(3). HRS § 658A-28(a)(5) did not apply because the County's motion to vacate was granted only in part. 
Here, the circuit court's March 3, 2017 Findings of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order vacated the arbitration award and all the arbitrator's rulings, and ordered that a new arbitrator conduct a new arbitration. It was just like the Texas district court order rejecting "the award and all bases on which it rested" and ordering a new arbitration by a new arbitrator. E. Texas, 307 S.W.3d at 270. Both were appealable because they were final  orders denying confirmation under subsection (3) of 
HRS § 658A-28(a) and the identical subsection (3) of TAA § 171.098(a). 
B. The Circuit Court's October 20, 2017 Order
Taxing Costs Was an Appealable Final Order 
LPIHGC argues we should temporarily remand to the 
circuit court for entry of an appealable judgment complying with 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright
, 76 Hawai#i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994), under HRS § 602-57(3) (2016) and 
8 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Waikiki v. Ho #omaka Vill. Ass'n of Apartment Owners , 140 Hawai#i 
197, 204, 398 P.3d 786, 793 (2017). 
[T]he rule in Jenkins  — to wit, that circuit court orders
resolving claims against parties must generally be reduced
to a judgment and the judgment must be entered in favor ofor against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP Rule 58before an appeal may be taken — is limited to circuit courtorders disposing of claims raised in a circuit courtcomplaint . 
Ditto v. McCurdy , 103 Hawai#i 153, 159, 80 P.3d 974, 980 (2003). 
The proceeding below was not initiated by a complaint. 
It was a special proceeding to confirm an arbitration award. 
The 
March 3, 2017 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order was 
an appealable final order under HRS § 658A-28(a)(3) to which the separate judgment rule in Jenkins  did not apply. Nordic's motion 
for taxation of costs was equivalent to a post-judgment motion. The October 20, 2017 Order Taxing Costs was an appealable final order because it ended the proceedings on Nordic's motion for taxation of costs, "leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto
, 103 Hawai#i at 157, 80 P.3d at 978. The time for 
appealing a final post-judgment order begins to run "upon entry thereof, not upon entry of [a] superfluous . . . judgment on the order." 
Id. at 159–60, 80 P.3d at 980–81. 
A Waikiki  remand 
would not revive appellate jurisdiction. 
Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP
) Rule 4(a) 
requires that a notice of appeal "be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable order." LPIHGC filed its Notice of Appeal on December 29, 2023, more than 30 days after 
9 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
entry of the October 20, 2017 Order Taxing Costs. The Notice of 
Appeal was untimely.
