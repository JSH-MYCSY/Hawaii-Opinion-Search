KO OLAUPOKO DIVISION 
(CIVIL NO. 1DRC-23-0004771) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that:
 
(1) On April 5, 2024, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief; 
(2) On May 1, 2024, the court construed self-
represented Defendant-Appellant Ryan Brenneis' (Brenneis) 
April 15, 2024 motion as seeking relief from default and a first extension of time for the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief, granted the motion, and extended the deadline to file the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief to May 31, 2024. The court cautioned Brenneis that any further default of the statement of jurisdiction or opening brief may result in sanctions, including the appeal being dismissed; and
