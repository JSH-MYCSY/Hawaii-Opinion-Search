IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
AIMEE  STINER,  Claimant-Appellant-Appellant,  v. 
BANK  OF  AMERICA,  dba  MERRILL  LYNCH, 
Employer-Appellee-Appellee,  and 
XL  INSURANCE  AMERICA,  INC.,  adjusted  by  SEDGWICK, 
Insurance  Carrier-Appellee-Appellee 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  LABOR  AND  INDUSTRIAL  RELATIONS  APPEALS  BOARD 
(CASE  NO.  AB  2023-038;  DCD  NO.  2-2022-165236) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL  FOR  LACK  OF  JURISDICTION 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka  and  McCullen,  JJ.) 
Upon
 review of the record, it appears that self-
represented Claimant-Appellant-Appellant Aimee Stiner (Stiner) 
appeals from the August 11, 2023 Order Denying Motion for Damages 
(Denial Order) entered by the Labor and Industrial Relations 
Appeals Board. Stiner filed her January 2, 2024 notice of appeal 
more than 30 days after entry of the Denial Order, which is 
outside of the deadline set forth in Hawaii Revised Statutes 
ยง 386-88 (2015) and Hawai i Rules  of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 4(a)(1). The record does not indicate that Stiner received 
an extension of time to appeal under HRAP Rule 4(a)(4), that the 
deadline was otherwise tolled under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), or that 
any other exception applies which may excuse the untimely appeal. 
Compliance with the requirement of timely filing a notice of          
  
      
    
      NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal  is  jurisdictional.   Ditto  v.  McCurdy,  103  Hawai i  153, 
157,
  80  P.3d  974,  978  (2003). 
Therefore, IT
 IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai i, June 27,  2024.
