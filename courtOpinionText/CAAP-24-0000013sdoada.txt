APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT  
(CASE NO. 2CPC-23-0000336)   
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION  ORDER  
(By: Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.)  
Defendant -Appellant Ryan Olson (Olson), appeals from 
the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying 
Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Due to Entrapment, and/or State v. 
Modica[, 58 Haw. 249, 567 P.2d 420 (1977) ( Modica)], and/or 
Motion to Suppress Evidence " (Order), filed on November 15,

2023, by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit ( circuit 
court). 1 Olson contends on appeal that the circuit court erred 
when it issued the Order,2 which rejected Olson's: (1) 
allegations that the Maui Police Department ( MPD) committed 
entrapment and violated his due process rights; (2) allegation 
that the MPD violated Modica; and (3) motion to suppress 
evidence.3 
Upon careful review of the record and relevant legal 
authorities , and having given due consideration to the arguments 
advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we resolve 
Olson's contentions as follows: 
(1) Olson contends that the circuit court erred by 
denying his Motion to Dismiss , and challenges certain FOF and 
COL associated with that ruling . Olson's Motion to Dismiss set 
forth two separate defenses based on MPD's conduct: (1) a 
1   The Honorable Michelle L. Drewyer  presided.  
2   The Order set forth  findings of fact ( FOF) and conclusions of law 
(COL), and ruled  that,  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that [Olson's] Motion to Dismiss 
Due to Entrapment and/or State v. Modica, and/or Motion to 
Suppress Evidence is DENIED.  
3   Olson was charged by felony information, following a n  MPD 
undercover operation, with violating Hawaii Revised S tatutes (HRS )  §  712-
1209.1  (Supp. 2022), Commercial Sexual Exploitation of a Minor.  
In September 2023, Olson filed a Motion to Dismiss Due to 
Entrapment and/or State v. Modica , and/or Motion to Suppress Evidence ( Motion 
to Dismiss ). Following the circuit court 's entry of its Order denying the 
Motion to Dismiss, Olson moved for, and was granted, leave to file an 
interlocutory appeal and a stay of the circuit court proceedings pending 
appeal. This appeal followed.

statutory defense of entrapment, pursuant to HRS § 702-237 
(2014); and (2) a constitutional due process defense. We review 
the circuit court's ruling on the Motion to Dismiss for an abuse 
of discretion. State v. Mortensen -Young, 152 Hawaiʻi 385, 392, 
526 P.3d 362, 369 (2023). 
Olson first contends that the circuit court erred in 
denying his Motion to Dismiss because the MPD entrapped him as a 
matter of law by conducting an "underaged decoy bait and 
switch[,]" thereby "manufactur [ing]" Olson's violation of HRS 
§ 712-1209.1. Olson contends that the tactics the MPD employed 
during its undercover operation created a substantial risk that 
Olson would be persuaded or induced to commit the crime of 
Commercial Sexual Exploitation of a Minor . 
Entrapment is an affirmative defense that requires 
defendant s to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that 
they, 
engaged in the prohibited conduct or caused the prohibited 
result because the defendant was induced or encouraged to 
do so by a law enforcement officer . . . who, for the 
purpose of obtaining evidence of the commission of an 
offense, either: 
(a) Knowingly made false representations designed to 
induce the belief that such conduct or result was not 
prohibited; or 
(b) Employed methods of persuasion or inducement which 
created a substantial risk that the offense would b e 
committed by persons other than those who are ready 
to commit it. 
HRS § 702-237(1); State v. Anderson, 58 Haw. 479, 480  n.3,  482— 
84,  572 P.2d 159, 160  n.3, 161—63  (1977).   "Whether  the  
defendant was entrapped or not ordinarily is a matter for the 
3   
 
 
    
    
 
   
  
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
jury to decide "; entrapment may only be established as a matter 
of law if the evidence is undisputed and clear. State v. 
Powell, 68 Haw. 635, 638, 726 P.2d 266, 267—68 (1986). 
During the undercover operation, two MPD police 
officers assumed the persona of "Sweet Leilani" and indicated 
Sweet Leilani was thirty-four years old. According to the 
circuit court's findings, on July 21, 2023, Olson and Sweet 
Leilani agreed to meet in person for "full service" for $150. 
At 8:59 p.m., Sweet Leilani texted, "Im almost 17. You alright 
with that ?" Olson responded, "Ok."4 At 10:10 p.m., Olson made 
contact with the officer deployed to pose as Sweet Leilani. 
Where the officers posing as Sweet Leilani informed 
Olson that Sweet Leilani was sixteen years old over an hour 
before Olson met up with Sweet Leilani , the evidence was not 
undisputed and clear so as to "create [] a substantial risk that 
the offense would be committed by persons other than those ready 
to commit it." See  HRS § 702-237(1)(b). And Olson did not 
present evidence that the officers made false statements 
designed to induce Olson to  believe  offering to provide $150  to 
a minor to engage in sexual conduct was not prohibited. See  id.  
§ 702-237(1)(a).    
4 Olson acknowledges that Sweet Leilani received his response at 
9:05 p.m.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The circuit court thus did not err by denying Olson's 
Motion to Dismiss and, in so doing, declining to conclude as a 
matter of law that Olson was entrapped.5 
Olson next contends that the circuit court erred in 
denying his Motion to Dismiss because the MPD's conduct during 
the undercover operation violated his due process rights. 
Due process is a limited defense that is available 
only under certain extreme circumstances. Agrabante , 73 Haw. at 
185—87, 830 P.2d at 495 —96. As the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court has 
instructed, "[w]e must necessarily exercise scrupulous restraint 
before we denounce law enforcement conduct as constitutionally 
unacceptable ; the ramifications are wider and more permanent 
than when only a statutory defense is implicated ." Id. at 185, 
830 P.2d at 495 (citation omitted ). To prove a due process 
violation, a defendant must show that a law enforcement 
officer's conduct violates fundamental fairness or is otherwise 
so outrageous that it "shocks the conscience." State v. Tookes, 
67 Haw. 608, 611—12, 699 P.2d 983, 986 (1985) . 
5 We note that defendant s would be entitled to a jury instruction 
on the entrapment defense if they present some evidence of entrapment. 
State v. Agrabante , 73 Haw. 179, 196, 830 P.2d 492, 501 (1992) ("A defendant 
in a criminal case is entitled to an instruction on every defense or theory 
of defense having any support in the evidence, provided such evidence would 
support the consideration of that issue by the jury, no matter how weak, 
inconclusive or unsatisfactory the evidence may be. ") (cleaned up). 
We further note that the circuit court 's FOF and COL, which were based 
on the preponderance of evidence in the pretrial record, are confined to the 
pretrial motion to dismiss.

Again, the officers posing as Sweet Leilani 
represented to  Olson that Sweet Leilani was sixteen  years old 
over an hour before Olson met up with Sweet Leilani. Olson does 
not show how this, or any other behavior by the officers, was so 
outrageous that it shocks the conscience.  
On this record, we determine that the circuit court 
was not wrong in concluding that MPD's undercover operation was 
not so outrageous or shocking as to violate Olson's due process 
rights. 
(2) Olson contends that HRS §§ 712 -1200 (Supp. 2022 ) 
and 712-1209.1 violate his constitutional rights, pursuant to 
Modica, because these statutes permit the "disparate treatment 
of similarly situated defendants who differ only in gender and 
role in the underlying prostitution contract [,]" thereby 
enhancing the criminal consequences against Olson from a petty 
misdemeanor offense to a class B felony offense. Olson's 
contentions lack merit. 
In Modica, the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court held that a 
criminal defendant 's constitutional rights are violated where 
"the same act committed under the same circumstances is 
punishable either as a felony or as a misdemeanor" and "the 
elements of proof essential to either conviction are exactly the 
same[.]" 58 Haw. at 251, 567 P.2d at 422. 
6   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Here, the elements of proof essential to a conviction 
under HRS §§ 712-1200  and 712-1209.1  are not "exactly the same." 
HRS § 712-1200 provides, in relevant part, that "[a]  person 
commits the offense of prostitution if the person engages  in, or 
agrees or offers to engage in, sexual conduct  with another 
person in return for a fee or anything of value."  
HRS § 712-1209.1 provides,  
(1) A person eighteen years of age or older commits the 
offense of commercial sexual exploitation of a minor 
if the person intentionally, knowingly, or 
recklessly: 
(a) Offers or agrees to provide anything of value 
to a member of a police department, a sheriff, 
or a law enforcement officer who represents 
that person's self as a minor to engage in 
sexual conduct; 
(b) Provides anything of value to a minor or third 
person as compensation for having engaged in 
sexual conduct with a minor; 
(c) Agrees to provide or offers to provide anything 
of value to a minor or third person for the 
purpose of engaging in sexual conduct with a 
minor; or 
(d) Solicits, offers to engage in, or requests to 
engage in sexual conduct with a minor in return 
for anything of value. 
The  plain language of HRS § 712-1209.1  expressly instructs  that 
the offer or agreement to provide "anything of value" must be 
for the purpose of, or in exchange for, engaging "in sexual 
conduct with a minor " or with a law enforcement officer "who 
represents that person's self as a minor  to engage in sexual 
conduct"; the plain language of HRS § 712-1200 does not.   
(Emphasis added.)  HRS §§  712-1209.1 and  712-1200 do not treat 
"similarly situated defendants  who differ only in gender and 
role"  differently.

Therefore, w e conclude that the circuit court did not 
err in concluding that there was no Modica violation. 
(3) Olson contends that the circuit court erred in 
denying his Motion to Suppress Evidence.   We review the circuit 
court's denial of the Motion to Suppress Evidence "de novo  to 
determine whether the ruling was right or wrong." State v. 
Hewitt, 153 Hawaiʻi 33, 40, 526 P.3d 558, 565 (2023) (internal 
quotation marks omitted).   Olson's contention is premised on his 
allegation that MPD violated his due process rights. Because we 
conclude the circuit court was not wrong in determining that the 
MPD's conduct was not so outrageous or shocking as to violate 
Olson's  due process rights, we further conclude that the circuit 
court was not wrong in denying Olson's  Motion to Suppress  
Evidence.  
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Order, filed 
November 15, 2023 , by the circuit court.
