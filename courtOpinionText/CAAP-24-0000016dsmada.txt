ORDER  DISMISSING   APPEAL  FOR  LACK  OF  JURISDICTION 
(By:   Leonard,   Acting  Chief  Judge,  Nakasone   and  McCullen,   JJ.) 
Upon  review  of  the  record,   it  appears   that  self-
represented  Defendants/Counterclaimants-Appellants  Cameron  E. 
Nice  and  Martha  J.  Jacobsen,  AKA  Martha  J.  Jacobsen-Nice  (Nice 
Parties )  appeal  from  the  Circuit  Court  of  the  Fifth  Circuit's  
April  17,  2023  "Order  Approving  Plaintiffs'  Attorneys  Fees  and 
Costs  Incurred  up  to  and  Including  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment" 
and  October  11,  2023  "Order  Granting  Plaintiffs'  Motion  for  Award 
of  Costs  and  Fees  Filed  on  September  14,  2023."   We  conclude  that 
the  court  lacks  jurisdiction  because  the  circuit  court  has  not 
yet  entered  a  final,  appealable  judgment.   See  Hawaii  Revised 
Statutes  ยง  641-1(a)  (2016);  Hawai i  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure
