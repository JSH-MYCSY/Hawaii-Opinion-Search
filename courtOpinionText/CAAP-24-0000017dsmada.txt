ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon  review  of  the  record,   it  appears  that  self-
represented
  Defendants/Counterclaimants-Appellants  Cameron  E. 
Nice  and  Martha  J.  Jacobsen,  AKA  Martha  J.  Jacobsen-Nice  (Nice 
Parties )  appeal  from  the  Circuit  Court  of  the  Fifth  Circuit's 
November  1,  2022  "Order  Approving  Plaintiffs'  Motion  for  Summary 
Judgment  Filed  July  29,  2022"  and  February  7,  2023  "Order 
Granting  Plaintiffs'  Motion  to  Enforce  Order  Granting  Plaintiffs' 
Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  Filed  Herein  on  December  13,  2022."  
We  conclude  that  the  court  lacks  jurisdiction  because  the  circuit 
court  has  not  yet  entered  a  final,  appealable  judgment.   See 
Hawaii  Revised  Statutes  ยง  641-1(a)  (2016);  Hawai i  Rules  of  Civil
