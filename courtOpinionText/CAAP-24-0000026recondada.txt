APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL  NO.  1CCV-22-0000984) 
ORDER  DENYING   MOTION  FOR  RECONSIDERATION 
(By:   Hiraoka,   Presiding   Judge,  Nakasone   and  McCullen,   JJ.) 
Upon  consideration   of  the  Second  Motion  for  Order  
(Second  Motion),  filed  March  4,  2024,  by  self-represented 
Defendants-Appellants  Ferdinand   Carreon   Ayson  and  Victoria 
Esprecion   Ayson  (collectively,   Aysons),  which  the  court  construes 
as  a  motion  for  reconsideration,  the  papers  in  support,  and  the 
record,  it  appears  that  the  Aysons  seek  reconsideration  of  the 
court's  February  26,  2024  Order  Denying  Motion  for  Stay,  but  the 
Aysons  fail  to  demonstrate  that  the  court  overlooked  or 
misapprehended  any  point  of  law  or  fact.   See  Hawai i  Rules  of 
Appellate  Procedure  Rule  40(b).
