NO.  CAAP-24-0000028 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
STATE  OF  HAWAI I,  Plaintiff-Appellee,  v. 
SHAWN  J.  MEDEIROS,  Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  SECOND  CIRCUIT 
(CASE  NO.  2CPC-22-0000677) 
ORDER  GRANTING  MOTION  TO  DISMISS  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka   and  Wadsworth,   JJ.) 
Upon  consideration  of  Plaintiff-Appellee  State  of 
Hawaii's  (State)  April  12,  2024  Motion  to  Dismiss  Appeal  for  Lack 
of  Appellate  Jurisdiction,  the  papers  in  support  and  in 
opposition,  and  the  record,  it  appears  the  State  seeks  dismissal 
of  this  appeal  on  the  basis  that  the  Circuit  Court  of  the  Second 
Circuit's  April  18,  2023  Findings  of  Fact,  Conclusions  of  Law, 
and  Order  Denying  Defendant's  Motion  to  Suppress  Evidence  (Denial 
Order),  from  which  self-represented  Defendant-Appellant  Shawn  J. 
Medeiros  appeals,  is  not  a  final  appealable  order  or  judgment, 
and  that  no  exception  to  finality  applies. 
We  conclude  that  the  Denial  Order  is  not  a  final 
judgment  and  sentence  appealable  under  Hawaii  Revised  Statutes 
(HRS)  ยง  641-11  (2016).   The  Circuit  Court  has  not  granted  leave 
to  file  an  interlocutory  appeal  from  the  Denial  Order  under  HRS 
ยง  641-17  (2016).   No  other  exception  to  finality  applies.   See 
State  v.  Johnson,  96  Hawai i  462,  470  n.12,  32  P.3d  106,  114  n.12 
(App.  2001)  ("[T]he  collateral  order  exception  is  applicable  in 
criminal  cases  only  upon  a  denial  of  pretrial  motions  to  reduce          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
bail,  motions  to  dismiss  based  on  double  jeopardy  grounds,  and 
motions   to  dismiss  under  the  Speech  and  Debate  Clause."). 
Therefore,   IT  IS  HEREBY   ORDERED   that  the  motion  is 
granted,   and  the  appeal  is  dismissed  for  lack  of  jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER  ORDERED  that all pending  motions  are
dismissed.  
        
DATED:   Honolulu,   Hawai i,  July  5,  2024.
