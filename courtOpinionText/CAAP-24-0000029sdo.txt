(CASE  NO.  5CPN-22-0000001) 
SUMMARY  DISPOSITION  ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and
 McCullen, JJ.) 
Petitioner-Appellant  Tunu  Afele  (Afele)   appeals  from 
the  December  18,  2023  Findings  of  Fact;  Conclusions  of  Law;  Order 
Rejecting  Claims  Raised  in  November  7,  2022  [Hawai i  Rules  of 
Penal
  Procedure  (HRPP)  Rule  40]  Petition  &  June  30,  2023 
Supplement  Thereto  (Order  Denying  Rule  40  Petition )  entered  by 
the  Circuit  Court  of  the  Fifth  Circuit  (Circuit  Court).   1
In the underlying criminal case, Afele was charged on 
June 4, 2020, in the District Court of the Fifth Circuit with 14 
felony counts, which were then amended on June 10, 2020, to 
include: Counts 1-4, Robbery in the First Degree; Count 5: 
Carrying or Use of Firearm in the Commission of a Separate 
Offense; Count 6, Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree; 
Counts 7 & 8, Criminal Property Damage in the First Degree;

           Counts  9  &  10,  Ownership  or  Possession  Prohibited  of  Any  Firearm 
or  Ammunition  by  a  Person  Indicted  For/Who  Waived  Indictment 
For/Bound  over  to  the  Circuit  Court  For/Convicted  of  Certain 
Crimes;  Count  11,  Place  to  Keep  Loaded  Firearms  Other  than 
Pistols  and  Revolvers;  Count  12,  Place  to  Keep  Ammunition;  Count 
13,  Loaded  Firearm  on  a  Public  Highway;  Count  14,  Theft  in  the 
First  Degree,  and  Count  15,  Terroristic  Threatening  in  the  First 
Degree.   The  case  was  committed  to  the  Circuit  Court  on  June  15, 
2020. 
Afele entered a No-Contest Plea (Plea) on July 8, 2020, 
pleading no contest to Counts 1, 6, 14, and 15. Pursuant to a 
plea agreement, the State agreed to drop the remaining charges 
and discontinue pursuit of extended or consecutive terms. In 
turn, Afele agreed that he would waive the preliminary hearing, 
would not request supervised release or a reduction in bail while 
awaiting sentencing, and that he would not pursue a direct appeal 
from his conviction. On February 24, 2021, Afele was sentenced 
to, inter alia, a 20-year term of imprisonment with a ten-year 
mandatory minimum. 
On November 7, 2022 Afele filed, pro se, the Rule 40 
Petition. Counsel was thereafter appointed and a Supplement to 
Petition was filed. On December 18, 2023, the Circuit Court 
entered the Order Denying Rule 40 Petition. Afele timely 
appealed. 
Afele raises two interrelated points of error on 
appeal, contending that the Circuit Court erred in: (1) denying 
his Rule 40 Petition without a hearing and concluding that Afele 
did not raise a colorable claim for relief; (2) in Findings of

             Fact (FOFs) 4, 5, and 8-15, and Conclusions of Law (COLs) 5, 6, 
10-17, and 18-35 by finding and concluding that Afele failed to 
raise a colorable claim that his plea was not knowing, 
intelligent, and voluntary, and that counsel was ineffective. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Afele's 
points of error as follows: 
A petitioner is entitled to a hearing on post-
conviction review when the petition states a colorable claim for 
relief. Dan v. State, 76 Hawai i 423, 427, 879  P.2d 528, 532 
(1994).2 A claim is colorable when the allegations in the 
petition, taken as true, would possibly change the outcome. Id. 
Afele  argues  that  his  trial  counsel   was  ineffective 
because   he  pressured   Afele  into  taking  a  plea  offer  by  (i) 
telling   Afele  that  he  would  likely  be  sentenced   to  80  years  in 
prison,   (ii)  advising   Afele  to  waive  his  preliminary   hearing, 
(iii)  advising   Afele  not  to  post  bail  because   Afele  would  lose 
the  plea  offer,  (iv)  refusing   to  negotiate   the  plea  terms,  and 
(v)  hardly,  if  ever,  contacting  Afele  in  jail.  
2 HRPP Rule 40 states in part: 
(f) Hearings. If a petition alleges facts that if 
proven would entitle the petitioner to relief, the 
court shall grant a hearing which may extend only to 
the issues raised in the petition or answer. However, 
the court may deny a hearing if the petitioner's claim 
is patently frivolous and is without trace of support 
either in the record or from other evidence submitted 
by the petitioner. The court may also deny a hearing 
on a specific question of fact when a full and fair 
evidentiary hearing upon that question was held during 
the course of the proceedings which led to the 
judgment or custody which is the subject of the 
petition or at any later proceeding.

           "Under article I, section 14 of the Hawai i 
Constitution and the
 Sixth Amendment of the United States 
Constitution, defendants in criminal cases are provided with the 
right to the effective assistance of counsel at trial." State v. 
Salavea , 147 Hawai i 564, 568, 465  P.3d 1011, 1015 (2020). 
Hawai i courts determine whether  the assistance, when viewed as a 
whole, was within the "range of competence demanded of attorneys 
in criminal cases[.]" State v. Richie, 88 Hawai i 19, 39, 960  
P.2d 1227, 1247 (1998). 
To prove ineffective assistance of counsel, a 
petitioner must show "1) that there were specific errors or 
omissions reflecting counsel's lack of skill, judgment, or 
diligence; and 2) that such errors or omissions resulted in 
either the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially 
meritorious defense." Grindling v. State, 144 Hawai i 444, 451,  
445 P.3d 25, 32 (2019) (quoting State v. Silva, 75 Hawai i 419, 
440,
 864 P.2d 583, 593 (1993)). Under this standard, a 
petitioner need not show actual or probable prejudice, but only 
possible prejudice. Wilton v. State, 116 Hawai i 106, 111,  170 
P.3d 357, 362 (2007). 
"General claims of ineffectiveness are insufficient and 
every action or omission is not subject to inquiry." Adams v. 
State,
 103 Hawai i 214, 227, 81 P.3d 394, 407 (2003). Where a 
petitioner alleges insufficiency at the plea bargaining stage, 
our inquiry ends where counsel's advice to take the plea is 
clearly tactical in nature. Id. In Adams, counsel was 
determined to be competent despite failing to inform his client 
of a statute of limitations defense and advising him to take a 
4

           plea deal. Id. at 227-28, 81 P.3d at 407-08. The court reasoned 
this advice was reasonable because the plea reduced the 
defendant's possible maximum term from twenty years to ten. Id. 
Similarly, this court held there was an "obvious tactical basis 
for accepting a time-sensitive plea proposal which would dismiss 
seven counts and forestall further consecutive sentencing and 
higher mandatory minimums[.] " State v. Mikasa, 110 Hawai i  441, 
448
 134 P.3d 607, 614 (App. 2006). 
Afele's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are 
general in nature. Unlike in Adams, Afele has not identified any 
defenses his attorney could have argued in lieu of accepting a 
plea and instead argues that his lawyer did not communicate with 
him enough and that Afele could have aided in his defense better 
if he had bailed out. Like the defendant in Mikasa, Afele 
received the benefit of the bargain. His potential maximum 
sentence was effectively reduced from 80 years to 20 years. 
Eleven counts were dismissed. Afele's plea agreement was time 
sensitive and conditioned on his cooperation. Afele fails to 
cite any authority supporting his contention that his counsel was 
ineffective for allegedly failing to argue for a better deal. 
Afele's other allegations of ineffective assistance of 
counsel fail because they were conditions of the plea agreement. 
The plea agreement required Afele to waive his preliminary 
hearing and not request a reduction in bail or supervised release 
while awaiting sentencing. Neither a preliminary hearing nor the 
availability of bail or supervised release terms are potentially 
meritorious defenses to a crime. Counsel's advice to accept the 
plea, rather than lose it, is the kind of tactical choice that

        does not rise to ineffectiveness. Because Afele does not point 
to any potential defenses trial counsel failed to mount, his HRPP 
Rule 40 Petition did not state a colorable claim. 
Afele also argues that the Plea was invalid because his 
attorney pressured him into taking the Plea and because the plea 
colloquy was deficient. 
A no-contest plea constitutes a waiver of several 
constitutional guarantees. State v. Solomon , 107 Hawai i 117, 
126-27,
 111 P.3d 12, 21-22 (2005). Waiver of constitutional 
rights must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Id. Hawai i 
courts shall
 not accept a no-contest plea without first 
addressing the defendant in open court and determining the plea 
is knowing and voluntary. HRPP 11(e) (2006). 
Afele argues that his plea was not knowing, intelligent 
and voluntary because counsel's performance was so deficient that 
Afele "could not make a reasoned decision" on whether to plead 
guilty. Specifically, Afele argues that counsel pressured him by 
failing to communicate, failing to negotiate a plea deal, and by 
allegedly telling Afele he would likely receive a sentence of 80 
years imprisonment. 
This argument is essentially a restatement of Afele's 
ineffective assistance of counsel argument. But, as shown above, 
Afele's trial counsel did not commit ineffective assistance of 
counsel, and thus this claim fails. Afele does not cite to, and 
we cannot find, any authority that an attorney's advice to take a 
plea deal renders that plea invalid, if the plea is entered 
knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently. Here, the Circuit 
Court specifically colloquied Afele concerning whether he had an 
6
          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
         
         
        
          
           
         
       
       
          
           
           
      
       
        
            
         
            
         
       
         
         
        
           
         
         
         opportunity to discuss the facts of the case with counsel, 
whether he received and was satisfied with legal advice from 
counsel, whether he had any complaints against counsel, and 
whether anyone was forcing him to change his pleas from not 
guilty to no-contest as to the four charges. We conclude that 
Afele's argument that the Plea was not knowing, voluntary, and 
intelligent because counsel was ineffective is without merit. 
Afele further argues that the plea colloquy was 
deficient because the Circuit Court did not inform him that (1) 
at a jury trial he could participate in jury selection, (2) the 
jurors would have to be unanimous in their verdict, or (3) the 
jury could be instructed on lesser-included offenses. 
The
 Hawai i Supreme  Court has expressly rejected the 
argument that trial courts must specifically advise a defendant 
of his right to participate in jury selection and his right to a 
unanimous verdict. State v. Gomez-Lobato ,
 130 Hawai i 465, 470, 
312 P.3d 897, 902 (2013). Afele does not cite, and we cannot 
find, any requirement that a plea colloquy must advise a 
defendant on possible lesser-included offenses. The plea 
colloquy, nearly twenty minutes long, was a true colloquy that 
tracked HRPP Form K, informed Afele of his constitutional rights, 
and ensured that his plea was knowing, intelligent, and 
voluntary. Upon review of the entirety of the colloquy and the 
totality of the circumstances of Afele's Plea, we conclude that 
the colloquy was sufficient and Afele's waiver of, inter alia, 
his right to a jury trial was not constitutionally infirm.
