ORDER  APPROVING  STIPULATION  TO  DISMISS  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka   and  McCullen,   JJ.)

and Disassociation of Cary T. Tanaka as Counsel for Third-Party 
Defendant-Appellee Imua Landscaping Co., Inc. [(Imua 
Landscaping)] (Notice), filed October 4, 2024, by attorney 
Jared J. Say (Say), which the court construes as a motion to

(HRAP) Rule 50(a), the Stipulation for Dismissal with Prejudice 
of all Claims and Parties (Stipulation), filed October 4, 2024, 
by Imua Landscaping, the papers in support, and the record, it 
appears that: 
(1) Imua Landscaping is represented in this appeal by 
Cary T. Tanaka (Tanaka), Greg H. Takase (Takase), and Say from 
the Law Office of Cary T. Tanaka; 
(2) The Notice states the Law Office of Cary T. Tanaka 
changed its name to the Law Office of Darlene F. Itomura; Tanaka 
is no longer associated with the firm; Tanaka's name should be

removed from the JEFS record for this case; and Takase and Say 
should continue to be served with e-filings; 
(3) HRAP Rule 50(a) provides with respect to 
withdrawal, that an attorney moving to withdraw as counsel of 
record "must show that notice of the motion was given by service 
upon the attorney's client." HRAP Rule 50(a); 
(4) The Notice does not specify whether the client was 
informed of the withdrawal of counsel. Nonetheless, the court 
will allow Tanaka to withdraw, but require Say to demonstrate 
service of the Notice upon the client; 
(5) The filing fees have been paid and the appeal has 
been docketed; 
(6) In the Stipulation, the parties stipulate to 
dismiss the appeal with prejudice and bear their own attorneys' 
fees and costs, under HRAP Rule 42. The Stipulation is signed by 
counsel for all appearing parties; and 
(7) Dismissal of the appeal is authorized by HRAP 
Rule 42(a). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice, 
construed as a motion to withdraw as counsel, is granted. Within 
ten days from the date of this order, Say shall file a 
declaration, affidavit, or certificate of service indicating the 
Notice was provided to the client, or that the client was 
otherwise informed of Tanaka's withdrawal. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerk shall 
end Tanaka as a party to this appeal in the Judiciary Information 
Management System. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Stipulation is approved 
and the appeal is dismissed with prejudice. The parties shall 
bear their own attorneys' fees and costs.
