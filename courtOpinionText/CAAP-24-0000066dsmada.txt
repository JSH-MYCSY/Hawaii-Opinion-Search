IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
D.R.,  Plaintiff-Appellant,  v. 
T.R.,  Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  FAMILY  COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT 
(CASE  NO.  3FDV-22-0000801) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR
 LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon  review  of  the  record,   we  conclude  that  the  court  
lacks  appellate  jurisdiction  over  self-represented  Plaintiff-
Appellant  D.R.'s  appeal  from  the  Family  Court  of  the  Third 
Circuit's  November  22,  2023  "Order  from  November  16,  2023,"  as  it 
is  not  a  final,  appealable  decree,  order,  or  judgment.   See 
Hawaii  Revised  Statutes  ยง  571-54  (2018);  Hall  v.  Hall,  96  Hawai i 
105,  111  n.4,
  26  P.3d  594,  600  n.4  (App.  2001)  (holding  that  a 
post-judgment  order  is  an  appealable  final  order  if  it  finally 
determines  the  post-judgment  proceeding),  aff'd  in  part,  and 
vacated  in  part  on  other  grounds,  95  Hawai i  318,  22  P.3d  965 
(2001).  
Therefore,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  the  appeal  is 
dismissed  for  lack  of  appellate  jurisdiction.          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  all  pending  motions  are 
dismissed. 
DATED:   Honolulu,   Hawai i,  February  7,  2024.
