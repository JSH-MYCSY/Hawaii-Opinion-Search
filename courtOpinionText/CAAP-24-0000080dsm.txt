OF THE STATE OF HAWAI I
KEAKA MARTIN, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, Defendant-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 1CCV-22-0000493)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
(By:  Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Upon review of the "Motion for Leave to Extend Time to
File Jurisdictional Statement and Opening Brief on Pending Motion
for Reconsideration" filed by self-represented Plaintiff-
Appellant Keaka Martin on March 25, 2024, the papers in support,
the memorandum in opposition filed by Defendant-Appellee
Department of Public Safety ( DPS) on March 28, 2024, and the
record, it appears that:
1. Martin appeals from the circuit court's
December 20, 2023 Oral Ruling  granting in part and denying in
part DPS's motion for summary judgment; and
2. The Oral Ruling, even if entered as a written
order, would not be appealable because it does not resolve all
claims as to all parties and the record does not show that the
circuit court certified the Oral Ruling for appeal under Hawai i
Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 54(b), Jenkins v. Cades Schutte
Fleming & Wright , 76 Hawai i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338
