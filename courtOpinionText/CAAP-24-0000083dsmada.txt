APPEAL  FROM  THE  FAMILY  COURT  OF  THE  FIFTH  CIRCUIT 
(CASE  NOS.  5GD151000035  and  5GD151000036  (consolidated)) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka  and  Guidry,  JJ.) 
Upon
 review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On
 May 24, 2024, the court granted self-represented 
Mother-Appellant's and Stepfather-Appellant's separate motions 
for relief from default and first extensions of time for the 
statements of jurisdiction and opening briefs to June 24, 2024. 
The court cautioned Mother and Stepfather that any further 
default of the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief may 
result in sanctions authorized by Hawai i Rules  of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rules 12.1(e) and 30, including, without 
limitation, monetary sanctions, the appeal being dismissed, or 
both; 
(2) Mother and Stepfather failed to file either 
document, or request another extension of time; 
(3) On June 26, 2024, the appellate clerk entered a 
default notice informing Mother and Stepfather that the time for 
filing the statements of jurisdiction and opening briefs had 
expired, the matter would be called to the court's attention on 
July 8, 2024, for appropriate action, which could include 
dismissal of the appeal, under HRAP Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and

Mother and Stepfather could request relief from default by 
motion; and 
(4) Mother and Stepfather have not taken any further 
action in this appeal. 
Therefore,  IT   IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  the  appeal  is 
dismissed.  
IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  all  pending  motions  are 
dismissed.
