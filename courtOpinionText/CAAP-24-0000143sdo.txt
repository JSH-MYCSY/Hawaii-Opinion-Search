(CIVIL NO. 1CCV-23-0001480)

self-represented in the Circuit Court proceedings below.

 Shimauchi appeals from the Circuit Court's February 7, 
2024 "Order Denying Plaintiff's Ex Parte  Motion for 
Reconsideration, Filed December 5, 2023 (Dkt. 19)" ( Order 
Denying Reconsideration ), and the December 26, 2025 "Final 
Judgment."  Shimauchi's November 16, 2023 Complaint alleged that 
she had "suffered significant financial harm" from her former 
spouse, Defendant-Appellee John Nuno Rei's ( Rei) "deliberate and 
intentional refusal to comply with the [employment disclosure] provision of the Divorce Decree," and requested damages. Shimauchi filed a December 5, 2023 motion requesting 
reconsideration of the Circuit Court's November 27, 2023 "Order 
Denying [Shimauchi]'s Ex Parte Motion for Personal Service Without State, Filed November 16, 2023 (Dkt. 12)," in which the Circuit Court denied her request for out-of-state service and sua sponte dismissed the Complaint. The February 7, 2024 Order 43
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  Denying Reconsideration reaffirmed the dismissal as follows: 
The Complaint arises from the parties' Divorce
Decree, and seeks modification of that Decree as related tochild support. As such, the Complaint raises issues thatfall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Family Court.
See HRS section 580-1 ("Exclusive original jurisdiction in
matters of . . . divorce is conferred upon the family court. . . ."). Consistent with [Shimauchi]'s purpose and herapparent understanding of the Family Court's jurisdiction,[Shimauchi] previously sought and received modification to
her child support obligations, albeit not in the amount she
seeks. See Rei v. Rei , 1 DV141007523; Rei v. Rei , 1FAL-22-
0000001.

3 The Final Judgment was entered pursuant to a December 1, 2025
remand order from this court. 
4 While Rei is designated an appellee, he was never served with the
Complaint below and was not a party below or in this appeal. No AnsweringBrief was filed. 
5 This court affirmed the family court's order regarding
Shimauchi's motion for post-decree relief, which sanctioned Rei for failureto notify Shimauchi of changes in his employment status but ultimatelyconcluded that Shimauchi failed to prove that she suffered actual damages in

 . . . . 
Here, the Family Court's exclusive jurisdiction to
address [Shimauchi]'s claims renders this Court without
subject matter to take any further action in this case.Accordingly, this Court dismisses [Shimauchi]'s Complaint
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and will take no
further action on the [motion for reconsideration]. 
(Footnote added.) 
On appeal, Shimauchi contends that the Circuit Court 
"erred in (1) holding that [Shimauchi]'s sole remedy is in 
Family Court, (2) in denying [Shimauchi]'s motion to serve [Rei] 
out of state, and (3) dismissing her tort claim when she moved 
for reconsideration." We address whether the Circuit Court erred in its determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, as that point is dispositive. 
Upon careful review of the record and the Opening 
Brief and having given due consideration to the arguments 
advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Shimauchi's challenge 
as follows. 
"The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law 
that this court reviews de novo under the right/wrong standard." 
Uyeda v. Schermer, 144 Hawai ʻi 163, 170, 439 P.3d 115, 122 (2019) 
(citation omitted). 
Shimauchi argues that because her Complaint alleges 
"[c]ommon law fraud," which "is a tort[,]" she is entitled to a 
jury trial under state constitutional and statutory provisions, and her "constitutional guaranty" of a jury trial cannot be "overrid[den]" by the family court's "[e]xclusive original jurisdiction" over divorce decrees under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 580-1(a) ( jury trial argument ). Shimauchi did not 
the form of "overpaid" child support. J.R. v. I.R., No. CAAP-23-0000384,
2025 WL 3301081, at *1-3 (Haw. App. Nov. 26, 2025) (SDO).

 present this jury trial argument to the Circuit Court, and it is 
waived. See State v. Moses, 102 Hawai ʻi 449, 456, 77 P.3d 940, 
947 (2003) 
(applying the general rule that a party's failure to 
raise an argument at the trial level waives that argument on 
appeal). Shimauchi also argues that under Brooks v. Minn, the Circuit Court may exercise subject matter jurisdiction in this matter, because: "Where the family court authorizes payment of a decree arrearage on a deferred payment basis and payment is not made, the deferred payment arrearage then becomes a decree-judgment debt enforceable in both family and civil court." 
73 Haw. 566, 573, 836 P.2d 1081, 1085 (1992) (citation and 
emphasis omitted). This Brooks argument was also not made below 
and is waived. See Moses, 102 Hawai ʻi at 456, 77 P.3d at 947. 
In any event, Brooks is inapposite where the Family Court has 
not authorized any deferred payment of a decree arrearage. 
We conclude the Circuit Court did not err in 
determining that it lacked jurisdiction over the Complaint in this case, under HRS § 580-1(a). 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Circuit Court 
of the First Circuit's February 7, 2024 Order Denying Reconsideration and December 26, 2025 "Final Judgment."
