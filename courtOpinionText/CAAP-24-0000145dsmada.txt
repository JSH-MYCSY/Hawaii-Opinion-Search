NO.  CAAP-24-0000145 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
LEROY  LEE  BOLDEN,  Plaintiff-Appellant,  v. 
STATE  OF  HAWAI I,  Defendant-Appellee  
APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL  NO.  1CCV-23-0000188) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL  FOR  LACK  OF  JURISDICTION 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka   and  McCullen,  JJ.) 
Upon  review  of  the  record,  it  appears  that  self-
represented  Plaintiff-Appellant  Leroy  Lee  Bolden  (Bolden)  filed  a 
notice  of  appeal  on  March  8,  2024,  in  which  he  seeks  relief 
relating  to  1CCV-23-0000188. 
It  is  unclear  what  Bolden  seeks  to  appeal  from,  as  the 
notice  of  appeal  does  not  identify  any  order  or  judgment  entered 
in  1CCV-23-0000188,  nor  does  there  appear  to  be  any  order  or 
judgment  entered  below  from  which  Bolden  could  appeal.   The 
Circuit  Court  of  the  First  Circuit  has  not  entered  a  final, 
appealable  order  or  judgment.   See  Hawaii  Revised  Statutes  (HRS) 
ยง  641-1(a)  (2016);  Hawai i  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  Rules  54(b), 
58;  Jenkins  v.  Cades  Schutte  Fleming   &  Wright,   76  Hawai i  115, 
119,  869  P.2d  1334,  1338  (1994).   None  of  the  orders  entered  in 
the  underlying  case  are  independently  appealable.          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Therefore,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  the  appeal  is 
dismissed  for  lack  of  appellate  jurisdiction.
