Dkt. 69 OGMDNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment Against All
Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure, which
this court vacated on appeal in CAAP-19-0000019.
On December 30, 2024, while the Motion and the appeal
were pending, the Circuit Court entered an order ( December 30,
2024 Order ) vacating, among other things, the October 19, 2020
Judgment, which is the subject of this appeal.  On January 9,
2025, this court temporarily remanded the case and directed the
Circuit Court to enter an order vacating the December 30, 2024
Order as having been entered without jurisdiction, and to enter a
new order "identical in substance" to the December 30, 2024
Order.
On January 14, 2025, while on temporary remand, the
Circuit Court entered the two orders, as instructed.  Because the 
October 19, 2020 Judgment appealed-from has been vacated, this
appeal is moot.  See Kaho ohanohano v. State, 114 Hawai i 302,
332, 162 P.3d 696, 726 (2007) ("[A] case is moot if the reviewing
court can no longer grant effective relief.")(cleaned up); e.g.,
In re TJ, No. CAAP-21-0000596, 2022 WL 16567553, at *1 (App.
Nov. 1, 2022) (Order)("Because the judgment from which this
appeal was taken has been vacated, this appeal is now moot.").
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is
granted and the appeal is dismissed.
