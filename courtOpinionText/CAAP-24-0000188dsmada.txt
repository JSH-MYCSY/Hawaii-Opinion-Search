APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
ORDER DIMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By: Leonard, Acting C.J., and Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that 
Petitioner/Respondent-Appellant Steven Stupak appeals from the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit's March 22, 2024 Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Petition for Instructions or in the Alternative to Remove Co-Personal Representative Steven Stupak, Filed August 15, 2022, entered in 1CLP-21-0000287, and its March 22, 2024 Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Petition for Instructions or in the Alternative to Remove Successor Co-Trustee Steven Stupak, entered in 1CTR-22-0000135 (together, 
March 22, 2024 Orders). 
The court lacks appellate jurisdiction because the 
Circuit Court in each case has not entered a final, appealable NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
order or judgment. See Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-1(a) 
(2016); Hawai# i Probate Rules (HPR) Rule 34(a), (d); Hawai# i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP)
 Rules 54(b) and 58; Jenkins v. Cades 
Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 
1338 (1994). Further, the March 22, 2024 Orders are not 
independently appealable under the collateral-order or Forgay1/ 
doctrines, nor has the Circuit Court granted leave for interlocutory appeal under HPR Rule 34(c), in accordance with HRS ยง 641-1(b). See Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai# i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 
832, 836 (2016) (setting forth the requirements for appealability under the collateral-order doctrine and the Forgay doctrine); HRS ยง 641-1(b) (specifying requirements for leave to file interlocutory appeal). In these circumstances, where, among other things, the Circuit Court has not expressed an intention to enter appealable judgments, we also decline to exercise our authority under HRS ยง 602-57(3) to temporarily remand these matters for that purpose. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
