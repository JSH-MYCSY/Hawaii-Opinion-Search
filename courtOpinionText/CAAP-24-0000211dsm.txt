APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 2CPC-20-0000109)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
(By:  Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that Defendant-
Appellant William Douglas Allen filed a self-represented1 appeal
from the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's March 11, 2024
oral denial of his January 12, 2024 Motion to Dismiss, and from a
June 18, 2021 "Order Denying Defendant's Motion to Strike Count
Three with Reference to Hawaii Revised Statute [sic] ยง 706-657." 
The court lacks appellate jurisdiction because the
Circuit Court has not yet entered a final judgment and sentence
in the underlying case, see  Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS)
ยง 641-11 (2016); State v. Nicol , 140 Hawai i 482, 492, 403 P.3d
259, 269 (2017), the Circuit Court has not directed that either
order appealed from be certified for interlocutory appeal under
HRS ยง 641-17 (2016), and neither order is immediately appealable
under the collateral order exception.  State v. Johnson , 96
Hawaii 462, 470 n.12, 32 P.3d 106, 114 n.12 (App. 2001).
