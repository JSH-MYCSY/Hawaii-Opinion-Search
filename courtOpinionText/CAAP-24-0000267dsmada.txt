NO. CAAP-24-0000267 
 
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI‘I 
E.M., Plaintiff-Appellant, v. 
C.W., Defendant-Appellee. 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3DV221000048) 
  
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Wadsworth, Presiding Judge, Nakasone and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears: 
(1) Self-represented Plaintiff-Appellant E.M. appeals 
from a March 20, 2024 Order from the Family Court of the Third 
Circuit, which the Notice of Appeal states is attached as 
Exhibit A; 
(2) There is no attachment labeled "Exhibit A," but 
payroll statements, a Child Support Enforcement Agency (
CSEA) 
Statement, a May 1, 2023 CSEA Administrative Findings and Order,

and an undated Child Support Guidelines Worksheet are attached 
to the Notice of Appeal; 
(3) There is no family court order dated March 20, 
2024 attached to the Notice of Appeal and no such order appears 
in the record of the underlying case, see generally, In re Doe
, 
96 Hawai‘i 272, 283, 30 P.3d 878, 889 (2001) (explaining that, 
"[i]n general, appeals in family court cases, as in other civil 
cases, may be taken only from (1) a final judgment, order, or 
decree, . . . or (2) a certified interlocutory order"); 
(4) A divorce decree was entered in the underlying 
case on February 26, 2024; 
(5) However, the Notice of Appeal was filed on 
April 1, 2024, more than 30 days after entry of the divorce decree; 
(6) Even if this court construes the Notice of Appeal 
as appealing from the divorce decree, the notice would be 
untimely under Hawai
‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 4(a)(1) (requiring notice of appeal be filed within 30 days 
after entry of judgment or appealable order); and 
(7) Thus, this court lacks jurisdiction over this 
appeal, see HRAP Rule 26(b) (explaining that, "no court or judge 
or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional 
requirements contained in Rule 4 of these rules"); Ditto v. 
McCurdy
, 103 Hawai‘i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003) (noting 
2    
 
 
   
  
 
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
generally "compliance with the requirement of the timely filing 
of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, and we must dismiss an 
appeal on our motion if we lack jurisdiction") (citation and 
internal quotation marks omitted). 
Therefore, IT IS ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed 
for lack of jurisdiction.
