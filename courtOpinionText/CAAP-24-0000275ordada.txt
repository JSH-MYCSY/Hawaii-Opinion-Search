APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL  NO.  1CCV-22-0001662) 
ORDER  GRANTING  MOTION  TO  DISMISS  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka  and  McCullen,  JJ.) 
Upon  consideration  of  Defendants-Appellees  Korean 
Christian  Church  and  Rex  Kim's  (together,  Appellees ) 
September  27,  2024  Motion  to  Dismiss  Appeal  for  Lack  of 
Jurisdiction,  the  papers  in  support  and  in  opposition,  and  the 
record,  it  appears  that  Appellees  seek  dismissal  of  the  appeal 
filed  by  self-represented  Plaintiff-Appellant  Hye  Ja  Choi  from 
the  Circuit  Court  of  the  First  Circuit's  March  22,  2024  Order 
Granting  [Appellees']  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  and  for 
Judgment  on  the  Pleadings  [Dkt.  251]  (March  22,  2024  Order)  on 
the  basis  that  the  court  lacks  appellate  jurisdiction. 
The  record  reflects  that  the  Circuit  Court  has  not 
entered  a  final,  appealable  decree,  order,  or  judgment.   Hawaii 
Revised  Statutes  (HRS)  ยง  641-1(a)  (2016);  Hawai i  Rules  of  Civil 
Procedure   (HRCP)  Rules  58,  54(b);  Jenkins   v.  Cades  Schutte 
Fleming   &  Wright,   76  Hawai i  115,  119,  869  P.2d  1334,  1338          
 
      
          
        NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1994).   Though  the  March  22,  2024  Order  could  be  certified  for 
appeal  in  an  HRCP  Rule  54(b)  judgment,  the  Circuit  Court  has  not 
entered  such  a  judgment  or  expressed  any  intent  to  do  so.  
Further,  the  March  22,  2024  Order  is  not  independently  appealable 
under  the  collateral-order  or  Forgay1  doctrines,   and  the  Circuit 
Court  has  not  granted  leave  for  an  interlocutory  appeal  under  HRS 
ยง  641-1(b).   See  Greer  v.  Baker,  137  Hawai i  249,  253,  369  P.3d 
832,  836  (2016)  (setting  forth  the  requirements  for  appealability 
under  the  collateral-order  doctrine  and  the  Forgay  doctrine);  HRS 
ยง  641-1(b)  (specifying  requirements  for  leave  to  file 
interlocutory  appeal).   
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellees' motion 
is granted and the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.
