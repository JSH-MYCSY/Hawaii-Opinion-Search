lack of jurisdiction on the basis that the "Order Denying 
Defendant[-Appellant] D.R. Horton Hawaii dba D.R. Horton-Schuler 
Division's [(Appellant )] Motion To Dismiss Complaint, Filed 
November 10, 2023 [Dkt. 1] or in the Alternative Stay Proceedings 
and Compel Individual Arbitrations, Filed March 21, 2024 [Dkt. 
55]" (Arbitration Order) is not an appealable order. The 
Arbitration Order stayed the case, directed the parties to engage 
in a consolidated arbitration, and denied Appellant's requests to 
dismiss the case and/or compel the parties to individual 
arbitrations. 
The parties do not dispute that the purchase agreements 
at issue in the underlying case contain "Dispute Resolution" 
clauses under which any disputes arising from the sale of the 
subject properties "shall be arbitrated pursuant to the [Federal 
Arbitration Act (FAA)]." Consistent with the parties' 
expectations under the purchase contracts, we apply the FAA's 
procedural rules in determining whether we have appellate 
jurisdiction. See Gabriel v. Island Pacific Academy, Inc., 140 
Hawai i 325, 333, 400 P.3d  526, 534 (2017) (determining that the 
choice-of-law provision in the contract at issue in the 
underlying case dictated the procedural rules governing an appeal 
from an order concerning arbitration). 
Appellant contends that the court should construe the 
Arbitration Order as a denial of a motion to compel individual 
arbitrations, which it contends is appealable under the FAA 
pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 16(a)(1)(C) or 9 U.S.C. § 16(a)(3).1 
1 9 U.S.C. § 16, which governs appeals under the FAA states, in

The  term  "final  decision"  as  used  in  9  U.S.C. 
§  16(a)(3)  refers  to  "a  decision  that  ends  the  litigation  on  the 
merits  and  leaves  nothing  more  for  the  court  to  do  but  execute 
the  judgment,"  such  as  an  order  directing  the  parties  to  proceed 
to  arbitration  and  dismissing  all  claims  in  the  underlying 
action.   Green  Tree  Financial  Corp.-Alabama  v.  Randolph,  531  U.S. 
79,  86  (2000).   Here,  the  circuit  court  expressly  declined  to 
dismiss  the  complaint,  and  it  further  ordered  that  the  "action  is 
stayed  pending  completion  of  the  consolidated  arbitration"  and 
that  it  "shall  continue  to  have  oversight  ability  over  this 
action  during  the  pendency  of  the  stay."   Thus,  the  Arbitration 
Order  is  not  appealable  under  9  U.S.C.  §  16(a)(3).  
Moreover, the Arbitration Order is not the type of 
order denying arbitration contemplated in 9 U.S.C. § 16(a)(1)(C). 
The effect of the Arbitration Order was not to deny an 
application that arbitration be held in accordance with the 
purchase agreement, but to reject Appellant's argument as to the 
form of arbitration contemplated in the purchase agreement, and 
further, to stay the case and affirmatively order the parties "to 
consolidated arbitrations pursuant to the Purchase Contracts." 
See Bushley v. Credit Suisse First Boston, 360 F.3d 1149, 1153-54 
(9th Cir. 2004) (holding that the denial of a request to compel 
arbitration under the movant's first-choice forum was not an 
appealable order denying arbitration under 9 U.S.C. § 16(a)(1)(B) 
or (C) because the district court nonetheless ordered arbitration 
1(...continued) 
arbitration  t hat  is  subject  to  this  title. 
(b)
 Except as otherwise provided in section 1292(b) of title 
28, an appeal may not be taken from an interlocutory order--
(1) granting a stay of any action under section 
3 of this title; 
(2) directing arbitration to proceed under 
section 4 of this title; 
(3) compelling arbitration under section 206 of 
this title; or 
(4) refusing to enjoin an arbitration that is 
subject to this title.

      NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to proceed, "albeit not in the 'first-choice' . . . forum 
requested."). 
We therefore conclude the Arbitration Order is not 
appealable under the FAA. Consistent with the plain language of 
9 U.S.C. § 16, we further conclude the Arbitration Order is not 
appealable under the collateral order doctrine. See Johnson v. 
Consumerinfo.com, Inc., 745 F.3d 1019, 1021–22 (9th Cir. 2014) 
("The structure of the statute . . . suggests that Congress 
intended to remove appellate jurisdiction from all orders listed 
in § 16(b)(1)-(4), regardless of whether any such order could 
otherwise be deemed collateral."). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellees' Motion 
to Dismiss is granted, and the appeal is dismissed for lack of 
jurisdiction.
