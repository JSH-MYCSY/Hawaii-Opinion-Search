SUMMARY  DISPOSITION  ORDER 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Wadsworth  and  McCullen,  JJ.)

Circuit  (Circuit  Court).  1 
The case arose from a June 28, 2021 incident at an 
Amelia Street home (Kishi Residence) in the Kalihi neighborhood 
of Honolulu. Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai i (State)  charged 
Pa with one count of Burglary in the First Degree (Burglary 1), 
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-810(1)(c) 
1 The Honorable Kenneth J. Shimozono presided at trial. The 
Honorable Ronald G. Johnson presided at delivery of the jury's verdict. The 
Honorable Trish K. Morikawa presided at sentencing, and entered the Judgment.

(2014).2 At trial, the Circuit Court instructed the jury on 
lesser included offenses of Burglary in the Second Degree 
(Burglary 2), in violation of HRS § 708-811(1) (2014)3, and 
Unauthorized Entry in a Dwelling in the Second Degree (UED 2), in 
violation of HRS § 708-812.6(1) (2014).4 The jury acquitted on 
Burglary 1, but convicted on Burglary 2 and UED 2. The Circuit 
Court sentenced Pa to a five-year term of incarceration. The 
Circuit Court then "note[d] that the UED 2 merges with the 
[Burglary] 2, so [Pa's] final charge will be [Burglary] 2." 
Pa raises two points of error on appeal, contending the 
Circuit Court erred by: (1) instructing the jury on the lesser 
included offense of Burglary 2; and (2) violating Pa's due 
process right to presentence allocution. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced by the parties, we 
resolve Pa's points of error as follows: 
2 § 708-810 Burglary in the first degree. (1) A person 
commits the offense of burglary in the first degree if the 
person intentionally enters or remains unlawfully in a 
building, with intent to commit therein a crime against a 
person or against property rights; and: 
    . . . . 
(c
) The person recklessly disregards a risk that the 
building is the dwelling of another, and the 
building is such a dwelling. 
3 § 708-811 Burglary in the second degree. (1) A 
person commits the offense of burglary in the second degree 
if the person intentionally enters or remains unlawfully in 
a building, with intent to commit therein a crime against a 
person or against property rights. 
4 § 708-812.6 Unauthorized entry in a dwelling in the 
second degree. (1) A person commits the offense of 
unauthorized entry in a dwelling in the second degree if the 
person intentionally or knowingly enters unlawfully into a 
dwelling and another person was lawfully present in the 
dwelling. 
2          
       
           
          
           
          
       
           
       
         
           
          
          
           
        
          
           
          
          
           
             
       
         
        
          
          
        
             
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Pa argues that the Circuit Court's instruction on 
Burglary 2 as an included offense was not supported by a rational 
basis in the evidence adduced at trial and the Circuit Court 
erred in allowing the jury to acquit Pa of Burglary 1, but 
convict him of Burglary 2. Pa argues that, under the 
circumstances here, the difference between Burglary 1 and 
Burglary 2 essentially comes down to where the crime happened. 
Under HRS § 708-810(1)(c), Burglary 1 requires proof 
that the defendant recklessly disregarded a risk that the subject 
building is the dwelling of another, and the building is such a 
dwelling. The difference between that offense and Burglary 2 is 
that Burglary 2 does not require a dwelling. However, here, 
there was ample evidence that the Kishi residence was in fact a 
dwelling, including the testimony of four Kishi family members 
that this was their family home, Pa's own reference to the 
building as a house, and the testimony of a police detective that 
every building on Amelia Street was residential. Pa did not 
challenge the proof that the building was a dwelling. Rather, 
his defense and testimony was that he only knocked on the screen 
door, he heard a TV on inside, and an older gentleman came to the 
door, but Pa did not enter the house. 
We conclude that there was no rational basis for the 
jury to acquit Pa of intentionally entering a dwelling, 
recklessly disregarding the risk that it was a dwelling, with the 
intent to commit a crime inside, but then convict him for 
unlawfully entering the same building with the same criminal 
intent. Cf. State v. Flores,
 131 Hawai i 43,  53, 314 P.3d 120, 
3

130 (2013) (analyzing whether there was a rational basis to 
acquit of one offense but convict of a lesser included offense); 
State v. Sneed, 68 Haw. 463, 464, 718 P.2d 280, 281-82 (1986) 
(propriety of instructing on lesser included defense depends on 
whether there is a rational basis to acquit of charged offense, 
but convict of included offense). Thus, we conclude that the 
Circuit Court erred when it instructed the jury to consider 
Burglary 2 an included offense to Burglary 1. 
The State argues that, even if such error occurred, the 
case should be remanded to the Circuit Court to dismiss the 
Burglary 2 conviction and to reinstate the UED 2 conviction, 
citing State v. Deguair, 139 Hawai i  117, 119,  119 n.4, 384 P.3d 
893, 895, 895 n.4 (2016). The State submits that there was a 
rational basis for giving the UED2 instruction because the jury 
could have rationally concluded that Pa did not intend to commit 
a crime therein against a person or property rights because it is 
undisputed that nothing was taken from the home. We conclude 
that this argument has merit. See id.; see also State v. 
Timoteo, 87 Hawai i 108, 109,  119, 952 P.2d 865, 866, 876 (1997). 
Therefore, we vacate the Circuit Court's March 14, 2024 
Judgment, remand this case to the Circuit Court, and direct the 
Circuit Court to reinstate Pa's conviction on UED 2 and 
resentence Pa. See Deguair,
 139 Hawai i at  129, 384 P.3d at 905 
(applying same remedy). Accordingly, as Pa will be resentenced 
on remand, we need not reach Pa's second point of error
