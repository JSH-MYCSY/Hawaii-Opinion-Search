NO.  CAAP-24-0000301 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
IN  THE  INTEREST  OF  J.W. 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  FAMILY  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
(FC-S  NO.  20-00172) 
ORDER  GRANTING  MOTION  TO  DISMISS  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka  and  McCullen,  JJ.) 
Upon consideration
 of Father-Appellee J.W.'s (Father) 
June 4, 2024 Motion to Dismiss Appeal for Lack of Appellate 
Jurisdiction (Motion to Dismiss ), the papers in support and in 
opposition, and the record, it appears that Father seeks 
dismissal of the appeal filed by Mother-Appellant R.E. (Mother) 
from the Orders Concerning Child Protective Act, entered by the 
Family Court of the First Circuit on a September 28, 2021 
(September 28, 2021 Order). The September 28, 2021 Order 
terminated the proceedings in FC-S No. 20-00172, and thus, was 
the operative final, appealable order entered in that case. 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 571-54 (2018). Mother's April 15, 2024 
self-represented Notice of Appeal was filed more than thirty days 
after the September 28, 2021 Order, and the deadline to appeal 
was not tolled or extended. The Notice of Appeal is therefore 
untimely. See Hawai i Rules  of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 4(a)(1); Grattafiori v. State,
 79 Hawai i 10, 13, 897 P.2d 
937, 940 (1995) ("As a general rule, compliance with the 
requirement of the timely filing of a notice of appeal is 
jurisdictional, . . . and we must dismiss an appeal on our motion          
       
          
       
    
         
          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
if we lack jurisdiction.")(citations & internal quotation marks 
omitted); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is 
authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in 
Rule 4 of these rules."). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Motion to Dismiss 
is granted, and the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
DATED:   Honolulu,   Hawai i,  September   25,  2024.
