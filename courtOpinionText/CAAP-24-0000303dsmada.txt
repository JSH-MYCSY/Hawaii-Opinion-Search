NO.  CAAP-24-0000303 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
M.G.,  Plaintiff-Appellant,  v. 
M.A.,  Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  FAMILY  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
(CASE  NO.  1DV221000013) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL  FOR  LACK  OF  JURISDICTION 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka  and  Guidry,  JJ.) 
Upon  review  of  the  record,  we  conclude  that  the  court 
lacks  jurisdiction  over  Plaintiff-Appellant  M.G.'s  appeal  because 
the  Family  Court  of  the  First  Circuit  has  not  entered  a  final, 
appealable  decree,  order,  or  judgment.   See  Hawaii  Revised 
Statutes  (HRS)  ยง  571-54  (2018);  Eaton  v.  Eaton,  7  Haw.  App.  111, 
118-19,  748  P.2d  801,  805  (1987).   Moreover,  none  of  the  orders 
identified  in  the  April  26,  2024  Amended  Notice  of  Appeal  have 
been  authorized  for  interlocutory  appeal  under  HRS  ยง  641-1(b) 
(2016). 
Therefore,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  the  appeal  is 
dismissed  for  lack  of  appellate  jurisdiction. 
IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  all  pending  motions  are 
dismissed.
