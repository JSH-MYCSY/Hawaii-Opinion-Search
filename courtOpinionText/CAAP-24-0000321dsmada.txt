DAVID  FIEDLER,   Plaintiff-Appellant,  v. 
TONY  HYUNDAI  WAIPIO;  CENTRAL  PACIFIC   BANK;  GEICO, 
Defendants-Appellees 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL  NO.  1CCV-23-0000581) 
ORDER  GRANTING   MOTION  TO  DISMISS   APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,   Acting  Chief  Judge,  Wadsworth   and  Guidry,   JJ.) 
Upon  consideration   of  Defendant-Appellee   Tony  Hyundai 
Waipio's   (Tony  Hyundai )  June  27,  2024  Motion  to  Dismiss  Appeal, 
the  papers  in  support,  and  the  record,  it  appears  that:  (1)  Tony 
Hyundai  seeks  dismissal  of  the  appeal  under  Hawai i  Rules  of 
Appellate  Procedure  (HRAP)  Rule  42  based  on  a  lack  of  appellate 
jurisdiction;  (2)  in  self-represented  Plaintiff-Appellant  David 
Fielder's  July  1,  2024  response,  he  asks  the  court  to  grant  the 
motion;  and  (3)  as  it  appears  that  this  court  does  not  have 
jurisdiction  over  this  appeal,  we  will  grant  dismissal  under  HRAP 
Rule  42(b). 
Therefore,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  the  motion  is 
granted,  and  the  appeal  is  dismissed.   Each  party  shall  bear 
their  own  attorneys'  fees  and  costs  on  appeal. 
DATED:   Honolulu,  Hawai i,  July  17,  2024.
