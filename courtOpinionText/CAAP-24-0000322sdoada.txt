v. 
NICHOLAS BURNS, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CPC-19-0000511) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Nicholas Donald Burns
 appeals from the April 1, 2024 
Second Order of Resentencing entered by the Circuit Court of the 
Third Circuit.1 We vacate and remand for further proceedings. 
Burns has, he admits, "a long history of interaction 
with the Court for an array of criminal proceedings." The interaction here began when Burns was charged in Hilo with Theft in the Third Degree, Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Third Degree, and Prohibited Acts Related to Drug Paraphernalia. On December 10, 2019, he pleaded no contest to Theft in the Third Degree and Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Third Degree under a plea agreement. The State agreed to dismiss count 3 for drug paraphernalia. A Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence 
1 The Honorable Wendy M. DeWeese presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was entered on December 12, 2019. Burns was sentenced to 
probation for four years, subject to various conditions. 
On April 9, 2020, the State moved to revoke probation 
and resentence Burns. The motion was based on Burns's conviction and sentence on March 6, 2020, for Habitual Property Crime in Judiciary Information Management System ( JIMS) case 
no. 3CPC-19-0000468 ( Kona Case 1 ), and on March 6, 2020, for 
Habitual Property Crime in JIMS case no. 3CPC-19-0000977 ( Kona 
Case 2). The State withdrew its motion on June 3, 2021, because 
the circuit court in the Kona Cases had granted Burns's motions for reduction of sentence and resentenced Burns to probation subject to conditions. 
Much happened in this case and the Kona Cases after 
June 3, 2021, that is not material to this appeal. On January 9, 2024, the State moved to revoke Burns's probation and resentence him in all three cases. Burns was represented in the underlying Hilo case by court-appointed counsel Ivan Van Leer  and in the 
Kona Cases by court-appointed counsel William Reece. The motions 
were consolidated and heard on January 29, 2024. Reece entered his appearance for Burns in the Kona Cases, and made "a special appearance for Mr. Van Leer" in this case. Burns then stated: 
THE DEFENDANT: Good morning, Your Honor; Nicholas
Burns. Before we proceed with anything else I would like
[to] dismiss counsel in [Kona Case 1] and [Kona Case 2]. 
THE COURT: Okay. Your request is denied.[2] 
Mr. Reece, how does Mr. Burns wish to proceed with the
motions to revoke? 
THE DEFENDANT: Mr. Reece is not authorized to 
represent me anymore. 
THE COURT: Mr. Reece, how does Mr. Burns wish to
proceed? Does he wish to have a hearing? 
MR. REECE: He doesn't --
2 The circuit court had previously denied Burns's November 19, 2019
request that Reece withdraw from representing him in Kona Case 1.

THE DEFENDANT: I haven't talked to him. There's no 
communication. If there's no communication there's no defense. 
THE COURT: Oh, okay. [To the deputy prosecuting
attorney:] Mr. Frye, we'll proceed with the hearing. Okay. 
After hearing evidence, the circuit court found that 
Burns intentionally violated substantial terms or conditions of 
his probation. The court orally granted the motions. The resentencing hearing in all three cases was held on April 1, 2024. An order revoking Burns's probation and resentencing him was entered in each case on April 1, 2024. This appeal followed.

Burns states two points of error: (1) the circuit court 
erred by finding he inexcusably violated conditions of probation; and (2) the circuit court erred by denying his request to 
discharge Reece. The second point is dispositive. 
Although there is no absolute right, constitutional or
otherwise, for an indigent to have the court order a change
in court-appointed counsel, when an indigent defendantrequests that appointed counsel be replaced, the trial courthas a duty to conduct a "penetrating and comprehensiveexamination" of the defendant on the record, in order toascertain the bases for the defendant's request. 
State v. Harter , 134 Hawai #i 308, 323, 340 P.3d 440, 455 (2014) 
(cleaned up). 
The examination must be "sufficient to enable the 
court to determine if there is 'good cause' to warrant 
substitution of counsel." Id. The circuit court did not conduct 
a Harter  examination in this case. 
The State argues this point of error is waived because 
Burns "never objected to Reece's special appearance in this case or requested to continue the hearing for Van Leer to appear." The State's argument is not persuasive because Burns said "Mr. Reece is not authorized to represent me anymore" and "I haven't talked to him. 
There's no communication. If there's no 
communication there's no defense." Burns thus objected to Reece

representing him in the consolidated hearing in this case and in 
the Kona Cases. 
The State argues, "[d]efendants cannot 'impede the 
course of justice or divert or blockade the orderly flow of business in our court system,' by attempting to fire appointed counsel at the last minute" (quoting State v. Torres , 54 Haw. 
502, 505, 510 P.2d 494, 496 (1973)). An indigent defendant cannot dismiss court-appointed counsel by simply moving to dismiss. See State v. Hirano , 8 Haw. App. 330, 333-34, 802 P.2d 
482, 484 (1990) (noting that "[a] defendant does not have a constitutional right to choreograph special appearances by counsel"). But failure to conduct a Harter
 examination is a 
structural error. 
Cf. State v. Cramer, 129 Hawai#i 296, 303, 299 
P.3d 756, 763 (2013) (holding denial of a continuance to appoint new counsel was a "structural error"); 
State v. Reed , 135 Hawai#i 
381, 386, 351 P.3d 1147, 1152 (2015) (holding the "denial of the right to retained counsel of choice" is a structural error); 
State v. Loher , 140 Hawai#i 205, 222, 398 P.3d 794, 811 (2017) 
(noting an appellate court would need to "engage in pure speculation" to determine the impact alternate counsel might have in a hearing). 
The circuit court's April 1, 2024 Second Order of 
Resentencing is vacated, and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this summary disposition order.
