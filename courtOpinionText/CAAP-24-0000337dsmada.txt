LAUREN LIPCON, Plaintiff-Appellant, 
v. 
MALIKO COFFEE COTTAGES, MAURICE SMITH, SYDNEY SMITH, AND MURPHY 
TAUA, individual/business, HANA A. VANDERVOORT, JOSEPH B. 
JACOBS, ANDREW S. FISHER, ELLEN M. FISHER, COUNTY OF MAUI, 
Defendants-Appellee, 
and 
DOES 1-100, Defendants. 
 
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 2CCV-22-0000308) 
Upon consideration of Defendants/Counterclaimants 
Appellees Maliko Coffee Cottages, Maurice Smith, Sydney Smith 
and Murphy Taua's (collectively, Appellees) May 3, 2024 "Motion  
           
 
 
   The record reflects that the Circuit Court has not 
entered a final, appealable decree, order, or judgment. Hawaii 
Revised Statues (HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016); Hawai‘i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rules 58, 54(b); Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai‘ i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994). The Circuit Court has not certified the Order for 
appeal in a HRCP Rule 54(b) judgment or granted leave to file an 
interlocutory appeal under HRS § 641-1(b) (2016), and neither the Forgay
2 nor the collateral order doctrines apply here. See
Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai‘ i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) 
(setting forth the requirements for appealability under the collateral-order doctrine and the Forgay doctrine); HRS 
§ 641-1(b) (specifying requirements for leave to file 
interlocutory appeal). Nor does the Order constitute an order denying a motion to compel arbitration under HRS § 658-28(a)(1) as Lipcon urges.   
 
   
 
 
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to Dismiss Appeal CAAP-24-000337" (Motion), the papers in 
support and in opposition, and the record,1 it appears that 
Appellees seek dismissal of the appeal filed by Plaintiff-
Appellant Lipcon from the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's April 23, 2024 "Order Denying [Lipcon]'s Motion to Strike [Appellees]' Motion for Preliminary Injunction" (Order) on the 
basis that the court lacks appellate jurisdiction. 
1 We have also considered Plaintiff- Appellant Lauren Lipcon's 
(Lipcon) July 1, 2024 "Statement of Jurisdiction" and Appellees' July 1, 2024 
"Counterstatement of Jurisdiction," which reiterate their respective 
arguments regarding appellate jurisdiction. 
2 Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848). 
2  
           
 
 
 
   Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
granted and the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction.
