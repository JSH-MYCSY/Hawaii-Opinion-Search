F THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
IN THE INTEREST OF S.L. 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(FC-S NO. 22-00155) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(
By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Mother-Appellant/Cross-Appellee K.M. (Mother) appeals 
and Father-Appellee/Cross-Appellant J.L. (Father) cross-appeals 
from the April 22, 2024 Order Terminating Parental Rights 
(Termination Order) entered in the Family Court of the First 
Circuit  (Family Court), which terminated Mother's and Father's 
(Parents') respective parental rights to their child, S.L. 
(Child). 1
On appeal, Mother contends the Family Court erred in 
terminating her parental rights because: 
(1) it failed to 
explore legal guardianship as an alternative to adoption; (2) the March 6, 2024 Permanent Plan (Permanent Plan) prepared by 
1 The Honorable Rebecca A. Copeland presided.   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Petitioner-Appellee/Cross-Appellee Department of Human Services 
(DHS) does not explain why seven months is a reasonable time 
period to complete Child's adoption; and (3) the Permanent Plan 
fails to state whether Child's current foster placement with Resource Caregivers (RCGs) would be his post-termination 
permanent placement, which deprives Parents of an opportunity to 
object, and prevents the Family Court from making a proper determination as to the best interests of Child.
2 Echoing 
Mother's third point of error, Father contends that the Family Court clearly erred in finding by clear and convincing evidence that the Permanent Plan is in the Child's best interest because it fails to identify a proposed permanent placement. Parents also challenge the Family Court's Findings of Fact (FOFs) 56, 58, 
61, 71, 73, 165, 167, 168, and 173, and Conclusions of Law (COLs) 25, 35, and 36. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Parents' arguments as follows: 
(1) Mother contends that because the Family Court in 
FC-G No. 22-1-0073 awarded legal guardianship for four of her other children, DHS must have provided a compelling reason why it was in their best interests, which the Family Court failed to explore in this case when it decided adoption was in Child's best interests. In conjunction with this argument, Mother challenges

briefs as collectively raising these three points of error. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
FOF 168,  which she claims is clearly erroneous because there was 
testimony that adoption was not in her other children's best 
interests, as their resource caregiver did not want to adopt. 3
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS
) § 587A-32(a) (2018) 
provides: 
§ 587A-32 Permanent Plan. (a) The permanent
plan shall: 
(1) State whether the permanency goal for the child
will be achieved through adoption, legalguardianship, or permanent custody; 
(2) Establish a reasonable period of time by whichthe adoption or legal guardianship shall befinalized; 
(3) Document: 
(A) A compelling reason why legal guardianship
or permanent custody is in the child'sbest interests if adoption is not thegoal; or 
(B) A compelling reason why permanent custodyis in the child's best interests if adoption or legal guardianship is not thegoal; 
(4) Establish other related goals, including thosepertaining to the stability of the child'splacement; education; health; therapy;counseling; relationship with the child's birthfamily, including visits, if any; culturalconnections; and preparation for independentliving; 
(5) If a child has reached the age of fourteen,describe the services needed to assist the child with the transition from foster care to independent living; and 
(6) Describe the methods for achieving the goals andobjectives set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5). 
(Emphasis added). 
3 FOF 168 states: 
168. Based on the totality of the credible
evidence and testimony, the court does not find theDHS acted improperly in seeking to terminate theparental rights over the child subject to this case,rather than seek legal guardianship as it did for anyof the prior children who were also involved in fostercustody cases. 
3  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 587A-30 (2018) similarly states, inter alia, that 
if a child is not expected to return to a safe family home, the 
child's permanent placement out of the family home shall be "in the following order of preference: (i) Adoption; (ii) Legal guardianship; or (iii) Other permanent out-of-home placement[.]" HRS § 587A-30(b)(5)(B). 
Thus, Hawaii's Child Protective Act requires a 
compelling reason when a permanent plan states a goal of legal guardianship or permanent custody over adoption, not the other way around. Here, Mother argues that there must be a compelling reason why guardianship should also be the goal for Child, but she fails to identify one. Moreover, there was ample clear and convincing evidence in the record concerning, inter alia, unresolved substance abuse and domestic violence, which supported a conclusion that neither Parent was able to provide a safe family home, or would become able to do so within a reasonable period, and therefore the Permanent Plan of adoption was in Child's best interests. Accordingly, we conclude that Mother's first point of error is without merit. 
(2) Mother argues that the Permanent Plan fails to 
explain why seven months from the date of the Permanent Plan is a reasonable period to finalize Child's adoption, as required by HRS § 587A-32(a). As set forth above, HRS § 587A-32(a)(2) required that a permanent plan establish a reasonable period of time for the adoption or guardianship to be finalized, but does not mandate specific parameters for determining the reasonable time. In this case, it appears that the proposed adoption was to 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
be finalized within five months after an April 17, 2024 hearing 
on the termination of parental rights. The September 2024 date allowed time for DHS to make a final decision regarding the adoption and complete various requirements and documentation before the first post-termination permanency hearing required under HRS § 587A-31(a) (2018). Mother presents no specific argument and cites no evidence in the record supporting a determination that this was not a reasonable amount of time. We cannot conclude that this argument provides a basis for appellate relief. 
(3) Mother argues that, in the Permanent Plan, DHS 
must unambiguously identify who DHS believes should adopt Child. It appears, however, that Mother recognizes that this is not a requirement stated in the Hawai# i Child Protection Act or any 
case law thereon. Mother contends that approval of the Permanent Plan without the identification of the proposed placement was not in Child's best interest because Parents would be denied an opportunity to present evidence that a particular proposed placement was not in Child's best interests. However, the plain language of HRS § 587A-32 requires only that the permanent plan state "whether the permanency goal for the child will be achieved through adoption, legal guardianship, or permanent custody," (emphasis added), and nothing in the statutory language supports a conclusion that it must also identify a specific permanent placement. Indeed, the case Mother cites, In the Interest of SP, CAAP-13-0003106, 2014 WL 1658601 (Haw. App. Apr. 25, 2014) (SDO), 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
weighs against her argument. Therein, this court held: 
Specification of adoptive parents is not required in a
proposed permanent plan under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS),
§ 587A–32 (Supp. 2013). In addition, under HRS
§ 587A–33(b)(3) (Supp. 2013), after the [Family Court]terminates parental rights, terminates the existing serviceplan, and revokes foster custody, the permanent custody ofthe child shall be awarded to an appropriate authorizedagency. Thus, the family court cannot approve a permanent
plan that specifies adoptive parents because it is contraryto HRS § 587A–33(b)(3). 
. . . . 
. . . [T]he issue of the permanent adoption of SP isnot determined until after termination of Mother's parental rights and approval of a permanent plan andapproval by the [Family Court] after a permanencyhearing. 
Id. at *1-2 (emphases added); see also Interest of K.K., CAAP-23-
0000058, 2024 WL 490880, at *3 n.4 (Haw. App. Feb. 8, 2024) (SDO) (noting that specification of adoptive parents is not required in a proposed permanent plan). 
Though it appears that a pre-termination permanent plan 
may identify a proposed permanent placement as part of its permanency goal, it is not required to do so, as the final determination of permanent placement is not required to be decided until after termination. See Interest of AB, 145 
Hawai#i 
498, 516–17, 454 P.3d 439, 457–58 (2019) ("[U]pon termination of parental rights, discretion to determine an appropriate custodian is vested in DHS.") (quoting In re Doe, 100 Hawai# i 335, 346, 60 
P.3d 285, 296 (2002)). 
We have carefully reviewed each of Parents' related 
challenges to specific FOFs and COLs, and we conclude that the Family Court did not clearly err in FOFs 56, 58, 61, 71, 73, 165, 167, 168, and 173, and COLs 25, 35, and 36 are not wrong.
