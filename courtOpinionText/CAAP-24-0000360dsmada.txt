IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I 
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
GRANT MARSHALL, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CPC-23-0000240) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka, and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) Self-represented Defendant-Appellant Grant Andrew 
Marshall ( Marshall ) filed a May 9, 2024 Notice of Appeal, which 
appeals from the August 16, 2023 
Judgment of Conviction and 
Sentence in 3CPC-23-0000240. 
(2) "In a criminal case, the notice of appeal shall be 
filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from." 
Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
4(b)(1); Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 641-11 (2016) ("Any party aggrieved by the judgment of a circuit court in a criminal matter may appeal to the intermediate appellate court" and "[t]he sentence of the court in a criminal case shall be the judgment"). 
(3) "[C]ompliance with the requirement of timely 
filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, and we must dismiss an appeal on our motion if we lack jurisdiction." State  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
v. Knight , 80 Hawai#i 318, 323, 909 P.2d 1133, 1138 (1996) 
(quotation marks and citation omitted). 
(4) Marshall filed the May 9, 2024 Notice of Appeal 
more than thirty days after entry of the August 16, 2023 
Judgment 
of Conviction and Sentence. 
(5) The record on appeal is not sufficiently developed 
for this court to address Marshall's contention that his trial 
counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction, without prejudice to Marshall's pending 
Hawai#i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 40 
petition for post-conviction relief in 3CPN-25-0000001. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai#i, June 25, 2025.
