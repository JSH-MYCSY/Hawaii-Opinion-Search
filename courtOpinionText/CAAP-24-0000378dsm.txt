Plaintiff-Appellee Debra A. Weeks with the Opening Brief via U.S. 
Mail and file a certificate of service indicating the date, 
mailing address, and manner in which the service was completed; 
(2) The July 21, 2025 Order further warned that failure 
to comply may result in sanctions, including dismissal of the 
appeal; 
(3) Warner failed to comply with the July 21, 2025 
Order; 
(4) On August 19, 2025, the court ordered Warner to, by 
no later than August 26, 2025, show cause, in a written 
declaration or affidavit, explaining why the appeal should not be 
dismissed for failure to serve the Opening Brief and for failure 
to file a certificate of service so indicating; and          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
          
        
    
        
         (5) Warner  failed to show cause, and to date, he has 
not filed a certificate of service indicating completion of
