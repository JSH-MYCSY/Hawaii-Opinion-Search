the filing fees by July 1, 2024, and that Manara's failure to pay the filing fees or file a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis  by this date will be brought to the court's 
attention for action that may include dismissal of the appeal under Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 3(a). 
(3) On September 19, 2024, the appellate clerk entered 
a "Default of Statement of Jurisdiction & Opening Brief," which NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
