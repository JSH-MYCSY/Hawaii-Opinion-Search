NO. CAAP-24-0000427
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I   
VINCENZO  MOLA,  Petitioner-Appellee,  v. 
DENISE  SMITH,  aka  DIXIE  DENISE  VILLA,  Respondent-Appellee,  and 
INDIRA  LOPEZ-RUIZ,   Non-Party   Appellant 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  DISTRICT   COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
HONOLULU   DIVISION 
(CIVIL  NOS.  1DSS-24-0000435  and  1DSS-24-0000471) 
ORDER  DISMISSING   APPEAL  FOR  LACK  OF  JURISDICTION 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka   and  Guidry,   JJ.) 
Upon
 review of the record, it appears that self-
represented non-party Indira Lopez-Ruiz filed a notice of appeal 
from the April 3, 2024 order denying a "Petition for Ex Parte 
Temporary Restraining Order and for Injunction Against 
Harassment" in 1DSS-24-0000435, and the April 12, 2024 order 
denying a "Petition for Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order and 
for Injunction Against Harassment" in 1DSS-24-0000471. Lopez-
Ruiz filed her notice of appeal on May 31, 2024, after the 30-day 
deadline in Hawai i Rules  of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 4(a)(1). The record does not show that Lopez-Ruiz received 
an extension of time to appeal under HRAP Rule 4(a)(4), or that 
the deadline was tolled by a timely-filed post-judgment motion 
under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). Timely filing a notice of appeal is a

jurisdictional  requirement.   Grattafiori  v.  State,  79  Hawai i  10,

  897  P.2d  937,  940  (1995). 
Therefore, IT IS
 HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
