  ANN  CHRYST,  Defendant-Appellant. 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT

ORDER  DISMISSING   APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,   Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka,   Wadsworth,   JJ.) 
Upon  review  of  the  record,   it  appears   Defendant-
Appellant   Kitty  Ann  Chryst  appeals   from  the  District   Court  of  the
 
Third  Circuit's   respective   "Order[s]   re:  Defendant's   Ex  Parte 
Motion  for  the  Removal   of  Driver's   License   and/or  Motor  Vehicle 
Registration   Stopper   and  Issuance   of  a  Clearance   Letter,"   entered 
May  20,  2024,  in  3DTC-19-053561,  3DTC-18-007296,  and  
3DTC-19-053401  (collectively,  May  20,  2024  Orders). 
We  conclude  the   court  lacks  appellate  jurisdiction,  as 
Chryst's   June  20,  2024  Notice  of  Appeal  was  not  timely-filed 
within  thirty  days  after  entry  of  the  May  20,  2024  Orders,  as 
required  by  Hawai i  Rules  of  Appellate  Procedure  Rule  4(b)(1).  
"[C]ompliance  with  the  requirement  of  timely  filing  of  a  notice 
of  appeal  is  jurisdictional,  and  we  must  dismiss  an  appeal  on  our 
motion  if  we  lack  jurisdiction."   State  v.  Uchima,  147  1

64,  77,  464  P.3d  852,  865  (2020).   
1 The deadline to appeal fell on June 19, 2024.
