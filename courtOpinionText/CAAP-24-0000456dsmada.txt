Intermediate Court of Appeals CAAP-24-0000456 01-MAY-2025 08:09 AM Dkt. 154 OGMD 
NO.  CAAP-24-0000456 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
STATE  OF  HAWAI I,  Plaintiff-Appellee,  v. 
CORY  B.  KARLEEN,  Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  FIFTH  CIRCUIT 
(CASE  NO.  5PC04-1-0292) 
ORDER  GRANTING  MOTION  TO  DISMISS  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  McCullen  and  Guidry,  JJ.) 
Upon  consideration  of  Plaintiff-Appellee  State  of 
Hawaii's  (State)  December  12,  2024  Motion  to  Dismiss  Appeal;  and 
alternatively,  to  Strike  the  Opening  Brief,  the  papers  in 
support,  and  the  record,  it  appears  that: 
(1)
 Self-represented Defendant-Appellant Cory B. 
Karleen (Karleen ) appeals from the Circuit Court of the Fifth 
Circuit's November 15, 2005 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence 
(Judgment ), entered in Case No. 5PC04-1-0292; 
(2) The State seeks, inter alia, dismissal of the 
appeal for lack of jurisdiction; and 
(3) Dismissal
 is warranted, as Karleen's July 2, 2024 
Notice of Appeal was not timely-filed within thirty days after 
entry of the Judgment, as required by Hawai i Rules  of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 4(b)(1), and "compliance with the requirement of          
           
           
          
              
           
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the  timely  filing  of  a  notice  of  appeal  is  jurisdictional."  
State  v.  Brandimart,  68  Haw.  495,  496,  720  P.  2d.  1009,  1010 
(1986). 1 
Therefore,  IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  the  motion  is 
granted,  and  the  appeal  is  dismissed  without  prejudice  to  Karleen 
seeking  alternative  relief  from  the  Circuit  Court  in  a  petition 
under  Hawai i  Rules  of  Penal  Procedure   Rule   40. 
IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  all   pending  motions,  as  well 
as  all  other  documents  and  submittals  filed  by  Karleen  in  this 
appeal,  are  dismissed. 
DATED:   Honolulu,  Hawai i,  May   1,  2025.

1 Though Hawai i courts h ave seen fit in criminal cases to relax the 
deadline for filing a notice of appeal where justice so warrants, including 
where defense counsel has inexcusably or ineffectively failed to perfect an 
appeal on his or her client's behalf despite being asked to do so, State v. 
Cardenas , 150 Hawai i 307, 317, 500 P.3d 492, 502 (App. 2021), those 
circumstances do not apply here.
