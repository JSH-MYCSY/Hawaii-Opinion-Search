Avila Pohlman (Pohlman ) filed the notice of appeal, self-
represented; 
(2) The statement of jurisdiction and opening brief 
were due on or before August 15, 2024, and September 24, 2024, 
respectively; 
(3) Pohlman failed to file either document, or request 
an extension of time; 
(4) On September 27, 2024, the appellate clerk entered 
a default notice informing Pohlman that the time for filing the 
statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired, the 
matter would be called to the court's attention on October 7, 
2024, for appropriate action, which could include dismissal of 
the appeal, under Hawai i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rules 12.1(e) and 30, and Pohlman could request relief from 
default by motion; and          
         NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(5) Pohlman  has not taken any further action in this 
appeal. 
Therefore,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  the  appeal  is 
dismissed.
