Dkt. 47 OGMDNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Maiwela appeals from the April 18, 2016 Judgment
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit in
1CC141000370.  Maiwela filed her July 9, 2024 notice of appeal
more than eight years after entry of the Judgment, which is
outside of the thirty-day deadline set forth in Hawai i Rules of
Appellate Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1).  The record does not
indicate that Maiwela received an extension of time to appeal
under HRAP Rule 4(a)(4), or that the deadline was otherwise
tolled by a timely-filed post-judgment motion under HRAP Rule
4(a)(3).  Compliance with the requirement of timely filing a
notice of appeal is jurisdictional.  Grattafiori v. State, 79
Hawai i 10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995).Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is
granted and the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai i, February 21, 2025.
