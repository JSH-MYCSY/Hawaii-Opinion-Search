APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT

(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka  and  Guidry,  JJ.) 
Upon  consideration  of  Defendant/Counterclaimant/ 
Cross-claimant/Third  Party  Plaintiff-Appellee  Canterbury 
Holdings,  LLC's  (Canterbury  Holdings )  December  11,  2024  "Motion 
to  Dismiss  Appeal  for  Lack  of  Jurisdiction  and  for  Sanctions" 
(Motion),  the  papers  in  support  and  in  opposition,  and  the 
record,  it  appears  that  Canterbury  Holdings  seeks  dismissal  of 
the  appeal  for  lack  of  jurisdiction  and  an  award  of  sanctions 
against  Plaintiff/Counterclaim  Defendant-Appellant  Association  of

       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The AOAO appeals from the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit's June 12, 2024 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and 
Order Granting Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff Canterbury 
Holdings, LLC's Rule 50 Oral Motion for Judgment as a Matter of 
Law" (June 12, 2024 Order). The court lacks jurisdiction because 
the Circuit Court has not entered a final, appealable order or 
judgment. Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai i 
115, 119, 869 P.2d
 1334, 1338 (1994). The June 12, 2024 Order is 
not independently appealable under the collateral order or 
Forgay1 doctrines. See Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai i 249, 253, 369 
P.3d
 832, 836 (2016) (setting forth requirements for 
appealability under the collateral order and Forgay doctrines). 
The Circuit Court did not grant leave for an interlocutory 
appeal. Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 641-1(b) (2016) (specifying 
requirements for leave to file interlocutory appeal). The notice 
of appeal cannot be construed as a premature appeal from a final 
judgment under Hawai i Rules of Appellate Procedure  Rule 4(a)(2) 
because the record does not reflect that the Circuit Court 
announced a final, appealable decision before the AOAO filed its 
notice of appeal. Accordingly, we will grant the request for 
dismissal. 
Canterbury Holdings fails to cite authority supporting 
an award of sanctions against the AOAO. Accordingly, we will 
deny the request for sanctions. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
granted in part and denied in part as follows: 
1. The appeal is dismissed; and 
2. The request for sanctions is denied. 
DATED:   Honolulu,  Hawai  i,  February   3,  2025.
