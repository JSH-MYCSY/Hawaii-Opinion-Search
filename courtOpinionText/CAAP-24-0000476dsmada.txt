(CIVIL  NO.  1CCV-20-0001511) 
ORDER 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka  and  McCullen,  JJ.) 
Upon  consideration  of  Plaintiff-Appellee  Navatek 
Capital   Inc.,  individually   and  derivatively  on  behalf  of  Nominal 
Defendant  PACMAR  Technologies  LLC,  fka  Martin  Defense  Group,  LLC, 
fka  Navatek  LLC's  October  15,  2024  Motion  to  Partially  Dismiss 
Appeal,  the  papers  in  support,  the  record,  and  there  being  no 
opposition,  it  appears  that  PACMAR  seeks  to  dismiss  the  appeal  in 
part  for  lack  of  jurisdiction. 
According  to  Defendant-Appellant  Martin  Kao's  (Kao) 
July  15,  2024  Notice  of  Appeal,  he  appeals  from  the  following 
post-judgment  orders  entered  in  the  Circuit  Court  of  the  First 
Circuit: 
March  15,  2023  Order  Granting  Nominal  Defendant 
PACMAR  Technologies  LLC,  fka  Martin  Defense  Group  LLC, 
fka  Navatek  LLC's  Ex  Parte  Motion  for  Issuance  of 
Garnishee  Summons  After  Judgment  [Michelle  Chapman];           NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
September  5,  2023  Order  Denying  Defendant/ 
Respondent  Martin  Kao's  Motion  to  Quash  Garnishee 
Summons  Directed  to  Michelle  Chapman  (Dkt  707)  and/or 
to  Discharge  or  Release  Garnishee;  
December  1 2,  2023  Order  Granting  Nominal 
Defendant  PACMAR  Technologies  LLC's  Motion  for 
Instructions  on  (1)  Garnishee  Order  [Michelle  Chapman] 
and  (2)  Garnishee  Order  [Geremy  Robinson] 
[(December  12,  2023  Order)];  
January  31,  2024  Order  Denying  Tiffany  Jennifer 
Lam's  Non  Hearing  Motion  to  Intervene  Filed  as  Dkt. 
840  on  October  11,  2023  [(January  31,  2024  Order)];  
March  27,  2024  Order  to  Show  Cause  Why  Defendant 
Martin  Kao  Should  not  be  Held  in  Civil  Contempt  for 
Knowingly  Violating  this  Court's  Orders,  and  for 
Sanctions;   
May  2,  2024  Findings  of  Fact,  Conclusions  of  Law 
and  Order  Granting  Nominal  Defendant  PACMAR 
Technologies  LLC's  Motion  for  an  Order  to  Show  Cause 
Why  Defendant  Martin  Kao,  Should  Not  be  Held  in  Civil 
Contempt  for  Knowingly  Violating  This  Court's  Orders 
and  for  Sanctions  [(May  2,  2024  Order)];  and 
June  14,  2024,  Findings  of  Fact,  Conclusions  of 
Law,  and  Order  Granting  Nominal  Defendant  PACMAR 
Technologies  LLC's  Motion  for  Civil  Contempt  Sanctions 
Against  Defendant  Kao  for  Knowingly  Violating  this 
Court's  Contemp  Order  [(June  14,  2024  Order)].  
PACMAR  contends  each  of  the  post-judgment  orders  from 
which  Kao  seeks  to  appeal  were  independently  appealable  when 
entered,  but  the  Notice  of  Appeal  was  not  timely-filed  with 
respect  to  any  those  orders,  except  for  the  June  14,  2024  Order.  
"A  post-judgment   order  is  an  appealable  final  order 
under  [Hawaii  Revised  Statutes  (HRS)]  §  641–1(a)  if  the  order 
ends  the  proceedings,  leaving  nothing  further  to  be 
accomplished."   Ditto  v.  McCurdy,  103  Hawai i   153,  157,  80  P.3d  
974,  978  (2003). 
The  December  12,  2023  Order  ended  the  post-judgment 
garnishment  proceedings  that  were  initiated  by  PACMAR's  March  2, 
2023  Ex  Parte  Motion  for  Issuance  of  Garnishee  Summons  After 
Judgment  [Michelle  Chapman],  as  it  finally  determined  PACMAR's 
garnishment  rights  with  respect  to  non-party  Michelle  Chapman, 
leaving   nothing   further   to  be  accomplished.    Familian   Nw.,  Inc. 
v.  Cent.  Pac.  Boiler  &  Piping,   Ltd.,  68  Haw.  368,  369,  714  P.2d 
936,  P.2d  938  (1986).

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

October 11, 2023 Non-Hearing Motion to Intervene, as it finally 
decided all issues raised in that motion. 
The May 2, 2024 Order ended the post-judgment 
proceedings with respect to PACMAR's February 9, 2024 Motion for 
an Order to Show Cause Why [Kao] Should not Be Held in Civil 
Contempt for Knowingly Violating this Court's Orders and for 
Sanctions, as it finally decided all issues raised in that 
motion. 
The June 14, 2024 Order ended the post-judgment 
proceedings with respect to PACMAR's May 10, 2024 Motion for

issues raised in that motion. Accordingly, each of the above-

appeal is a jurisdictional defect that can neither be waived by 
the parties nor disregarded by the court in the exercise of 
judicial discretion." Enos v. Pac. Transfer & Warehouse, Inc., 
80 Hawai i 345, 349,  910 P.2d 116, 120 (1996).
