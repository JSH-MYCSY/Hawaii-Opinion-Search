STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DENVER BREWER, also known as DENVER BUCHANAN,
Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CPC-23-0000797) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Guidry, JJ.) 
Denver Brewer, also known as Denver Buchanan, appeals 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence  entered by the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
1 We affirm. 
Brewer was charged by felony information with Assault 
in the Second Degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 707-711(1)(a) and/or (d). He pleaded not guilty. He 
waived his right to a jury trial. The Circuit Court found him 
guilty as charged.2 He was sentenced to five years in prison. 
The Judgment of Conviction and Sentence was entered on June 25, 2024. This appeal followed. 
Brewer states four points of error: (1) the Tachibana 
colloquy was inadequate; (2) he did not voluntarily waive his

2 The Honorable James S. Kawashima presided over the trial. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
right to a jury trial; (3) the evidence was insufficient to 
support a conviction for assault in the second degree; and (4) self-defense was not disproved beyond a reasonable doubt.
(1) Brewer challenges the sufficiency of the trial 
court's Tachibana  colloquy. We review using the right/wrong 
standard. State v. Martin, 146 Hawai #i 365, 377, 463 P.3d 1022, 
1034 (2020). 
Brewer chose to not testify. The trial court had to 
engage him in an on-the-record colloquy to ensure his waiver of the right to testify in his own defense was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai #i 226, 236, 900 P.2d 
1293, 1303 (1995). 
It "should elicit responses as to whether the 
defendant intends to not testify, whether anyone is forcing the defendant not to testify, and whether the decision to not testify is the defendant's." Martin, 146 Hawai #i at 378–79, 463 P.3d at 
1035–36. 
Brewer argues the trial court erred by never asking him 
"if anyone was forcing him not to testify." We "look to the totality of the facts and circumstances to determine whether a waiver of the right to testify was voluntarily and intelligently made." 
Martin, 146 Hawai#i at 379, 463 P.3d at 1036. 
The trial court asked Brewer, "do you wanna testify?" Brewer answered, "No, Your Honor." The court asked, "the important thing is do you feel 
that this is your decision?" 
"Yes," said Brewer. The court asked, "no one can force you to remain 
silent. 
If you wanna testify, you can do it even if your lawyer 
thinks you shouldn't. Do you understand?" 
Brewer answered, "Ye -- yes." The court asked, "you understand if you remain silent, 
no one can force you to testify either, right? No one can force you to say, no, I'm gonna say as the judge you have to come up here. No one can do that, right?" 
"Right[,]" said Brewer. 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Here, as in Martin , "although the circuit court did not 
the [sic] use precise terminology, 'Is anyone forcing you not to 
testify?' the circuit court's questioning was tantamount to eliciting that information." Id. at 380, 463 P.3d at 1037. Here, as in Martin , the Tachibana  colloquy was adequate.
(2) 
Brewer contends he did not voluntarily waive his 
right to a jury trial. 
We review "the totality of the 
circumstances surrounding the case," using the right/wrong 
standard. State v. Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawai#i 465, 469-70, 312 
P.3d 897, 901-02 (2013). "Where it appears from the record that a defendant has voluntarily waived a constitutional right to a jury trial, the defendant carries the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that his/her waiver was involuntary." 
Id. at 469, 312 P.3d at 901 (cleaned up). 
Brewer signed a written Waiver of Trial by Jury  on 
March 5, 2024. 
Although not always required, trial courts are 
advised to conduct a Duarte-Higareda  colloquy to determine 
whether the defendant's waiver of the right to a jury trial was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawai #i 
at 470, 312 P.3d at 902 (referencing United States v. Duarte-Higareda , 113 F.3d 1000, 1002 (9th Cir. 1997)). In a 
Duarte-Higareda  colloquy, the trial court informs the defendant 
that "(1) twelve members of the community compose a jury, (2) the defendant may take part in jury selection, (3) a jury verdict must be unanimous, and (4) the court alone decides guilt or innocence if the defendant waives a jury trial." Id. at 470 n.6, 
312 P.3d at 902 n.6. 
The Waiver of Trial by Jury that Brewer signed 
addressed the Duarte-Higareda  components. The trial court also 
engaged Brewer in an extensive colloquy on each Duarte-Higareda component. Brewer argues his waiver "was not knowing or intelligent because the Court did not inform him of his right to peremptory challenges as set forth in HRS § 635-30 and HRPP Rule 24(b)[.]" The Waiver of Trial by Jury that Brewer signed told him:

5. I have the right to consult with and assist my
attorney in selecting the twelve jurors and makingrequests to excuse one or more jurors for cause orotherwise. 
On the record before us, we hold that the trial court 
was right to conclude that Brewer knowingly, voluntarily, and 
intelligently waived his right to a jury trial.
(3) Brewer contends the evidence was insufficient to 
support a conviction for Assault in the Second Degree. "[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be considered in the strongest light for the prosecution when the appellate court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence to support a conviction; the same standard applies whether the case was before a judge or a jury." State v. Sheffield
, 146 Hawai#i 49, 53, 456 
P.3d 122, 126 (2020). 
On the date of Brewer's offense the elements of Assault 
in the Second Degree were: 
(1) A person commits the offense of assault in the second
degree if the person: 
(a) Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes
substantial bodily injury to another; [or] 
. . . . 
(d) Intentionally or knowingly causes bodily injuryto another with a dangerous instrument[.] 
HRS § 707-711 (Supp. 2022). 
The trial court described the trial evidence in great 
detail when it announced its decision. That evidence included a 
security video of the incident, photographs of the complaining witness's injuries, and testimony by the complaining witness that the trial court found credible. On this record, we conclude the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction for Assault in the Second Degree.
(4) Brewer contends the State did not disprove self-
defense beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial evidence, including the security video and the complaining witness's testimony, 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
considered in the strongest light for the prosecution, was 
sufficient to support the trial court's conclusion "that self-defense has been disproven beyond a reasonable doubt[.]" 
The Judgment of Conviction and Sentence entered by the 
Circuit Court on June 25, 2024, is affirmed.
