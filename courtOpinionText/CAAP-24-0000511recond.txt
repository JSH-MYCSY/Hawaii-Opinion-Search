IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI #I 
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KAI DELA CRUZ, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CPC-19-0001711) 
ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the Motion for Reconsideration  filed by 
Defendant-Appellant Kai Dela Cruz  on December 18, 2025, and the 
record, it appears that Dela Cruz seeks reconsideration of the 
December 8, 2025 Summary Disposition Order  in which we vacated 
his conviction and remanded for a new trial because of a deficient Tachibana
 colloquy, and did not address his contention 
that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress. He argues that "resolution of this point of error will provide guidance to the Circuit Court and the parties on remand." 
On remand, should Dela Cruz choose to renew his motion 
to suppress, the trial court will decide the motion based on the facts it finds after an evidentiary hearing, and the law. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for 
Reconsideration is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai #i, December 22, 2025.
