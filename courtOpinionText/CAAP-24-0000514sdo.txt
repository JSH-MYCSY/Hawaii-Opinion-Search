STATE OF HAWAIʻ I, Plaintiff-Appellee, 
v. 
ERIC G. TADIARCA-WARNER, Defendant-Appellant. 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
WAIʻANAE DIVISION  
(CASE NO. 1DCW-24-0001443)  
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: 
Nakasone, Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Eric G. Tadiarca-Warner appeals 
from the District Court of the First Circuit's July 15, 2024 
Judgment and Sentence, convicting him of Terroristic Threatening 
in the Second Degree in violation of Hawai‘i Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 707-717(1) (2014) and sentencing him to thirty days' 
imprisonment with credit for time served.  1
On appeal, Tadiarca-Warner challenges one of the 
district court's findings as plainly erroneous. 
1 The Honorable Bryant Zane presided.   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
   Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this 
appeal as discussed below and affirm. 
HRS § 707-717(1) provides that "[a] person commits the 
offense of terroristic threatening in the second degree if the 
person commits terroristic threatening other than as provided 
in" HRS § 707-716 (2014). 
HRS § 707-716 prohibits threatening a person on more 
than one occasion, "threats made in a common scheme against different persons[,]" threats against public servants and 
emergency medical service providers, threats with a dangerous 
instrument, and threats against a person who is protected by a 
court order or police officer. 
Terroristic threatening occurs when "the person 
threatens, by word or conduct, to cause bodily injury to another 
person . . . or to commit a felony . . . [w]ith the intent to terrorize, or in reckless disregard of the risk of terrorizing, 
another person[.]" 
HRS § 707-715 (2014). 
Here, the district court found that the complaining 
witness (CW) "was a credible, reliable witness." The district 
court stated that it viewed the "incident as a whole," as "one 
incident." The district court explained:

 And when [Tadiarca- Warner] gets out of his car, uh --
both times, he looks directly at [CW], he's addressing 
[CW], . . . that's the only person he's addressing. It's 
in a manner that, uh -- is conveying a message of, um --
threat. The thumb across the throat, which was understood 
by [CW], and by the court, as a threat to at the very least hurt the person. 
.  .  .  . That the other gestures did indicate that 
[Tadiarca- Warner] wanted to engage -- engage with [CW] 
.  .  . in[] .  .  .  a fight.  
Now, part of the compelling evidence for the court is 
that [Tadiarca
-Warner] at the, uh -- first light, um --
moved, maneuvered his vehicle to the side, . . . taunted 
[CW], uh -- wanted, uh -- [CW] to pull even with him. 
[CW] . . . declined. 
But then, .  .  . [Tadiarca- Warner] maneuvered his 
vehicle behind [CW's] vehicle and continued to follow him for extended period of time.  .  .  .  [CW] did not take a 
direct[]  .  .  . route to[]  .  .  . the shopping center, .  .  . 
but [Tadiarca- Warner] continued to follow him.  And[]  .  .  . 
it was for an extended period of time.  
.  .  .  . And that [Tadiarca- Warner] continuously 
followed -- it's clear that [Tadiarca- Warner] was not 
trying to go anywhere else but to follow [CW].  
And then we get to the part where [Tadiarca- Warner] 
blocks [CW], .  .  . gets out again, and .  .  . further 
engages with [CW] .  .  . confirming that he wanted to 
engage[]  .  .  . with [CW] in a fight.  
(Emphases added.) 
In his sole point of error, Tadiarca-Warner contends 
the "trial court plainly erred in finding, as 'compelling 
evidence,' that '[he] at the, uh — first light, um — moved, 
maneuvered his vehicle to the side, um — tsk — taunted [CW], uh 
— wanted, uh — [CW] to pull even with him.'" (Formatting 
altered.) 
Tadiarca-Warner argues that "at no point did [CW] 
state that [Tadiarca-Warner] indicated a desire for him to 'pull 
3   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 even'." Tadiarca-Warner further argues that the court's finding 
was "a substantive component of the court's reasoning and its 
assessment of [Tadiarca-Warner]'s culpability." 
CW testified that a car came by his right side "really 
fast" and cut him off. 
CW then testified that Tadiarca-Warner 
"was looking in his side rear mirror at [him], and then looking in the rear view, and then he pull[ed] into that center lane"
and was "still eying [CW] up." (Emphases added.) CW explained that Tadiarca-Warner got out of his car, approached, and took 
"his thumb, put[] it against his throat, and d[id] one of these 
things. Co -- crosse[d] it -- you know, thumb across the 
throat." CW testified, "I[] just watch[ed] him going off, 
talking, trying to egg me up -- egg me to move forward. Because
it's a red light. So he[] [was] trying to egg me to move
forward." (Emphasis added.) 
Although CW did not use the words "pull even," he 
testified that Tadiarca-Warner cut him off, looked in the rear-view mirror, then moved his car to the center lane, and tried to 
"egg [him] to move forward." 
Based on CW's testimony, the 
district court's use of "pull even" does not rise to the level 
of plain error. Hawai‘i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 
Rule 52(b) ("Plain errors or defects affecting substantial 
rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the 
attention of the court.").

 Importantly, the district court found CW credible, and 
CW testified to Tadiarca-Warner's conduct, including exiting his 
car at the traffic light, drawing his thumb across his throat, 
entering his car, following CW to and around the shopping mall, 
blocking CW's car with his car, exiting his car again, yelling, 
and making more gestures indicating he wanted to fight. 
As such, there was sufficient evidence to support 
Tadiarca-Warner's conviction for Terroristic Threatening in the 
Second Degree. 
State v. Pulse, 83 Hawai‘ i 229, 244, 925 P.2d 
797, 812 (1996) ("The testimony of one percipient witness can 
provide sufficient evidence to support a conviction."). 
And 
Tadiarca-Warner's substantial rights were not violated. See 
HRPP Rule 52(b). 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court's 
July 15, 2024 Judgment and Sentence.
