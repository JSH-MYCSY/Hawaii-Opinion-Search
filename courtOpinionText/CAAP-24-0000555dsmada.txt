APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL  NO.  1CCV-22-0000389) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka  and  Wadsworth,  JJ.) 
Upon  review  of  the  record  in  CAAP-24-0000555  and 
1CCV-22-0000389,1  it  appears  that: 
(1)  Self-represented  Defendant-Appellant  Jason  Y.M. 
Kimokeo  appeals  from  the  January  18,  2024  "Writ  of  Possession 
and/or  Ejectment"  filed  by  the  Circuit  Court  of  the  First  Circuit 
(January  18,  2024  Writ). 
(2)  The  January  18,  2024  Writ  was  immediately 
appealable.   Ciesla  v.  Reddish,  78  Hawai i  18,  20,  889  P.2d  702, 
704  (1995);  Lambert  v.  Teisina,  131  Hawai i  457,  461,  319  P.3d 
376,  380  (2014)  ("writs  of  possession  .  .  .  are  examples  of 
orders  and  decrees  that  [the  Hawai i  Supreme  Court]  has  held  to 
be  appealable  under  the  Forgay  doctrine."  (citations  omitted)). 
1 The  court  takes  judicial  notice  of  the  record  in  1CCV-22-0000389.  
Hawai i  Rules  of  Evidence  Rule  201.          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3)  Hawai i   Rules  of  Appellate  Procedure  Rule  4(a)(1) 
requires  that  "[w]hen  a  civil  appeal  is  permitted  by  law,  the 
notice  of  appeal  shall  be  filed  within  30  days  after  entry  of  the 
judgment  or  appealable  order."  Kimokeo  filed  the  Notice  of  Appeal 
on  August  20,  2024,  more  than  thirty  days  after  the  January  18, 
2024  Writ  was  entered.   The  circuit  court  record  indicates  that 
1CCV-22-0000389  has  not  been  finally  resolved. 
(4)  Accordingly,  this  appeal  is  untimely  and  we  lack 
jurisdiction.   Ciesla,  78  Hawai i  at  21,  889  P.2d  at  705. 
Therefore,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  this  appeal  is 
dismissed. 
IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  all  pending  motions  are 
dismissed.
