Upon  consideration   of  the  Notice  of  Withdrawal  and

Carvalho,  April  T.  Carvalho,  and  Ikaika  Builders,  Inc.  (Notice), 
filed  October  16,  2024,  by  attorney  Frederick  J.  Arensmeyer 
(Arensmeyer),  the  papers  in  support,  and  the  record  in  Matthews 
v.  Carvalho,  CAAP-24-0000557,  CAAP-24-0000558,  and  CAAP-24-
0000559,  it  appears  that:  
(1)  Arensmeyer  filed  the  identical  Notice  in  CAAP-24-
0000557,  CAAP-24-0000558,  and  CAAP-24-0000559; 
(2)  In  CAAP-24-0000558,  Defendant-Appellant  James  C. 
Carvalho  (James)  is  the  self-represented  Defendant-Appellant,  and 
April  T.  Carvalho  (April)  and  Ikaika  Builders,  Inc.  (Ikaika 
Builders)  are  Defendants-Appellees,  represented  by  attorney 
Randall  Y.  Kunn  Char  (Char); 
(3)  The  Notice  states  that  under  Hawai i  Rules  of 
Appellate  Procedure  (HRAP)  Rule  50(b),  Char  withdraws  as  counsel 
and  Arensmeyer  substitutes  as  counsel  for  "Defendants-Appellants          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
John  C.  Carvalho, [1]  April  T.  Carvalho,  and  Ikaiki  Builders, 
Inc."   The  Notice  is  signed  by  Char  and  Arensmeyer,  includes 
Arensmeyer's  contact  information,  and  is  signed  by  April  and 
James  as  "Defendant-Appellant,"  "Each  individually  and  on  behalf 
of  Defendant-Appellant  Ikaika  Builders,  Inc."; 
(4)  The  court  construes  and  approves  the  Notice  as  Char 
withdrawing  as  counsel  and  Arensmeyer  substituting  as  counsel  for 
April  and  Ikaika  Builders  as  appellees  in  CAAP-24-0000558,  and 
Arensmeyer  entering  an  appearance  as  counsel  for  James  as  the 
appellant  in  CAAP-24-0000558; 
(5)  On  August  20,  2024,  James  filed  the  notice  of 
appeal,  self-represented,  which  created  the  appeal  in  CAAP-24-
0000558; 
(6)  The  record  on  appeal  in  CAAP-24-0000558  was  due  on 
or  before  October  21,  2024,  but  was  not  filed  because  James  did 
not  pay  the  filing  fee  or  obtain  a  fee  waiver.   See  HRAP 
Rules  3(a),  11(b)(1),  (3),  24,  26(a);  
(7)  On  October  23,  2024,  the  appellate  clerk  entered  a 
default  of  the  record  on  appeal  in  CAAP-24-0000558,  informing 
James,  through  Arensmeyer,  that  the  time  to  docket  the  appeal  had 
expired,  James  had  not  paid  the  filing  fee  or  obtained  an  order 
allowing  James  to  proceed  on  appeal  in  forma  pauperis ,  the  matter 
would  be  brought  to  the  court's  attention  on  November  4,  2024, 
for  action  that  may  include  dismissal  of  the  appeal,  and  James 
could  seek  relief  from  default  by  motion; 
(8)  James  has  not  paid  the  filing  fee  or  filed  a  motion 
for  relief  from  default  in  CAAP-24-0000558.   An  appeal  may  be 
dismissed  where  the  record  on  appeal  has  not  been  prepared 
because  the  appellant  failed  to  pay  the  required  fees  or  obtain 
an  order  allowing  the  appellant  to  proceed  in  forma  pauperis .  
HRAP  Rule  11(b)(2),  (c)(2);  and 
(9)  In  addition,  the  notices  of  appeal  that  James  filed 
in  CAAP-24-0000558  and  CAAP-24-00005592  are  nearly  identical, 
1   "John  C.  Carvalho"  is  not  party  to  this  appeal.   The  court  construes 
the  reference  to  "John  C.  Carvalho"  to  mean  "James  C.  Carvalho. " 
2   The  court  takes  judicial  notice  of  the  notice  of  appeal  in  CAAP-24-
0000559,  filed  August  21,  2024.   Hawai i  Rules  of  Evidence  Rule  201. 
2          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
containing  only  minor  technical  differences,  which  effectively 
render  the  appeals  duplicative  and  ensure  James  will  not  be 
prejudiced  by  dismissal  of  the  appeal  in  CAAP-24-0000558. 
Therefore,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  the  Notice  is 
approved  as  follows: 
1. Char  withdraws  as  counsel  and  Arensmeyer 
substitutes  as  counsel  for  April  and  Ikaika  Builders  as  the 
appellees  in  CAAP-24-0000558. 
2. Arensmeyer  enters  an  appearance  as  counsel  for 
James  as  the  appellant  in  CAAP-24-0000558. 
IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  the  appeal  in  CAAP-24-
0000558  is  dismissed. 
IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  all  pending  motions  in  CAAP-
24-0000558  are  dismissed.
