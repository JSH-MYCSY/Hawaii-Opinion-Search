IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I 
D.R., Plaintiff-Appellant, v. T.R., Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3FDV-22-0000801) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
D.R.
, representing himself, appeals from the " Decision 
and Order  on All Pending Motions as of August 8, 2024" entered by 
the Family Court of the Third Circuit on August 8, 2024.1 We 
affirm. 
D.R. filed for divorce from T.R. on October 27, 2022. 
A divorce decree was entered on December 13, 2022. According to 
the transcript of a June 1, 2023 hearing, D.R. filed a number of post-decree motions: "request for modification, motion to seal, motion to dismiss [T.R.]'s motion, motion for post-decree relief, and also [D.R.]'s motion to seal." According to the Decision and Order, evidentiary hearings were held on July 25, 2024, and August 1, 2024. The record on appeal does not contain transcripts of the evidentiary hearings.
2 The family court 
1 The Honorable Jeffrey W. Ng presided. 
2 "The burden is upon appellant in an appeal to show error by
reference to matters in the record, and he or she has the responsibility of
providing an adequate transcript." Bettencourt v. Bettencourt , 80 Hawai#i 
(continued...) NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
announced its decision during an August 8, 2024 hearing. The 
Decision and Order was entered on August 8, 2024. This appeal followed. 
D.R.'s opening brief does not comply with Hawai #i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b). To promote access to justice, we liberally interpret a self-represented litigant's briefs and do not automatically foreclose them from appellate review because they fail to comply with court rules. Erum v. Llego , 147 Hawai #i 
368, 380-81, 465 P.3d 815, 827-28 (2020). But D.R.'s brief does not contain any citations to where in the record his post-decree motions or any evidence presented to the family court can be found. 
We are not obligated to search the record for information 
that should have been provided by D.R. Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. 
Otaka, Inc. , 114 Hawai #i 438, 480, 164 P.3d 696, 738 (2007). Nor 
does the brief contain any factual or legal argument about why the Decision and Order was clearly erroneous or wrong. The only 
argument we discern is a request that this court "do the right thing[.]" 
"The law is clear in this jurisdiction that the 
appellant has the burden of furnishing the appellate court with a sufficient record to positively show the alleged error." Bettencourt
, 80 Hawai #i at 230, 909 P.2d at 558. D.R. has not 
shown any error. 
Accordingly, the "Decision and Order on All 
Pending Motions as of August 8, 2024" entered by the family court on August 8, 2024, is affirmed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai #i, April 10, 2025.
