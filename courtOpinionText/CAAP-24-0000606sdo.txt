NAINOA DAMON, Defendant-Appellant 
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CPC-22-0000378) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Nakasone, Chief Judge, Leonard and Guidry, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Nainoa Damon (Damon) appeals from 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's (circuit court) 
"Judgment of Conviction [and] Sentence" (Judgment), entered on 
August 22, 2024, and "Free Standing Order of Restitution" 
(Restitution Order), entered on August 23, 2024.
1 
On March 30, 2022, the State of Hawaiʻi (State) charged 
Damon by Indictment with the following six counts: (1) Murder in 
1 The Honorable Shanlyn A.S. Park presided.   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  the Second Degree, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§§ 707-701.5 (Supp. 2019), 706-656 (2014); (2) Carrying or Use 
of Firearm in the Commission of a Separate Felony, in violation 
of HRS § 134-21 (2023); (3) Robbery in the First Degree, in 
violation of HRS § 708-840(1)(b)(ii) (2014); (4) Carrying or Use 
of Firearm in the Commission of a Separate Felony, in violation 
of HRS § 134-21; (5) Place to Keep Pistol or Revolver, in 
violation of HRS § 134-25 (2023); and (6) Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree, in violation of HRS § 707
-
716(1)(e) (2014). 
A jury found Damon guilty on all counts, and found 
that the HRS § 706-660.1 (2014) sentencing enhancement should be imposed. The circuit court sentenced Damon to the following 
prison terms: (1) on Count 1, to a life term with the 
possibility of parole, with a mandatory term of 15 years; (2) on 
Counts 2, 3, and 4, to an indeterminate term of 20 years; (3) on 
Count 5, to an indeterminate term of 10 years; and (4) on Count 6, to an indeterminate term of 5 years. The circuit court 
ordered all terms to be served concurrently. In its Restitution 
Order, the circuit court also ordered Damon to pay $3,980.73 to 
the family of the Decedent. 
Damon raises the following points of error on appeal, 
contending that the circuit court: (1) erred in denying "Damon a 
right to a fair trial by failing to dismiss [a juror]"; (2) 
2   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 erred "in allowing [Federal Bureau of Investigation Special 
Agent Andrew Masters (Agent Masters)] to testify as to his 
updated opinions contained in his untimely updated report"; (3) 
erred "in allowing Ridge Li[ʻ ]i [(Liʻi)] and Andreas Schneider 
[(Schneider)] to testify"; (4) "plainly erred in failing to give 
a self-defense instruction"; and (5) "plainly erred in its 
special interrogatory." (Formatting altered.) Damon also 
contends, as point of error (6), that his trial counsel "was 
ineffective and substantially impaired his defense," and, as 
point of error (7), that "[t]he cumulative effect of the errors 
deprived Damon of a right to a fair trial." (Formatting 
altered.) 
Upon careful review of the record, briefs, and 
relevant legal authorities, and having given due consideration to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, 
we resolve Damon's contentions of error as follows: 
(1) Damon contends that the circuit court erred when 
it failed to dismiss one of the jurors, following the juror's 
exposure to an outside influence, thereby violating his right to a fair trial. We review Damon's contention for abuse of 
discretion. State v. Grewer
, 157 Hawaiʻi 104, 111, 575 P.3d 737, 
744 (2025) ("When a claim of juror misconduct arises, trial 
courts first determine whether the alleged deprivation is of a substantially prejudicial nature. In making this determination, 
3   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  trial courts look to the 'general nature' of the alleged 
misconduct and whether it 'could' substantially prejudice the 
defendant. Whether a juror's alleged misconduct 'could' 
substantially prejudice the defendant is a question left to the 
trial court's discretion.") (citations omitted). 
The record reflects that, following a verbal outburst 
in the gallery between two trial attendees, the circuit court 
conducted an individual voir dire of each juror. The circuit court asked each juror: (1) if they saw or heard anything of the 
"outburst" in court; (2) if so, what they saw or heard; and (3) 
whether what they saw or heard would affect their ability to be 
fair and impartial. The circuit court also instructed each 
juror to set aside what they saw or heard, and to not discuss 
the "outburst" or voir dire with any other juror. 
Damon contends that the circuit court erred by not 
excluding a juror who testified that she saw "a gentleman 
talking to another gentleman," and that she heard one man say to the other "something about don't talk about him like that" and 
"you're a good boy." Observing that the juror appeared "visibly 
upset" during voir dire, the circuit court asked the juror: "Can 
you tell me how this incident has affected you?" The juror 
twice told the circuit court she is "a cry baby" and that she 
"cr[ies] about everything." In response to the circuit court's 
questions, the juror affirmed that she could be a fair and 
4   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 impartial juror in this case, that she would follow the circuit 
court's "instruction to set this incident aside and just judge 
this case solely based upon the witnesses here . . . and the 
documents that come into evidence," and that she would not 
discuss the incident or voir dire with the other jurors. 
The circuit court recalled this juror for a second 
voir dire when it came to the circuit court's attention, after 
the initial voir dire, that the juror "had expressed concern for her safety in the public, . . . in regard to being a juror in 
this case." The juror informed the circuit court during this 
second voir dire that she worked in sales and, through her work, 
"encounter[s] everybody in the public" and "help[s] police 
officers and . . . everybody." The circuit court again 
questioned the juror as to her ability to perform her duties as 
a juror, as follows: 
THE COURT: [Juror], I need to be sure. Remember what I 
said. I have three functions as a judge, and one of those 
functions is to be sure that the process is fair. So I'm just 
asking you for your most honest answer. 
There's no right --
THE JUROR: 
Right. 
THE COURT: -- or wrong answer. All right? I just want you 
to understand that.  
Given your strong emotion
s with respect to this incident 
this afternoon that you exhibited to me, would that affect your 
ability to focus on the evidence coming into this trial or would 
it affect -- do you believe that it would affect your ability to 
be fair and impartial to both the prosecution and the defense in this case? 
THE JUROR: It will not affect my, uh --
THE COURT: Okay. 
5   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
 THE JUROR: -- thinking. 
THE COURT: All right. So you feel you can proceed forward 
as a juror even though you have these concerns? 
THE JUROR: Yes. 
(Formatting altered.) 
Following this questioning, the circuit court 
determined that the juror could be fair and impartial.    
On this record, we conclude that the circuit court did 
not abuse its discretion by allowing the juror to remain on the 
jury. 2
(2) Damon contends that the circuit court erred in 
"allowing Agent Masters to testify as to his updated opinions 
contained in his untimely updated report," as this violated 
Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 16. (Formatting 
altered.) "Generally, the decision whether to admit expert 
testimony rests in the discretion of the trial court." State v.
McDonnell, 141 Hawaiʻ i 280, 289, 409 P.3d 684, 693 (2017) 
(citation omitted). However, "to the extent that the trial 
court's decision is dependent upon interpretation of court 
rules, such interpretation is a question of law, which the 
appellate court reviews de novo." Id.
 (cleaned up). 
2 We note that Damon's trial counsel asked the circuit court to 
excuse the juror "out of an abundance of caution" based on his concerns that 
the juror's "founded belief that she's gonna get caught in the crossfire out 
there" would "kick back," but acknowledged that he thought the juror could 
"be fair and impartial." 
6   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 The record reflects that the State disclosed Agent 
Masters' original report to Damon on August 23, 2023. Agent 
Masters' report analyzed Damon's cell phone locations around the 
time of the charged offenses. The State noticed its intent to 
call Agent Masters as an expert "in the area of historical 
cellular site analysis." After both parties had indicated their 
readiness to go to trial on March 12, 2024, the State learned of 
Agent Masters' amended report on March 20, 2024 and received the amended report on March 21, 2024.
3 The State represents that it 
disclosed the amended report to defense counsel on March 21, 2024, the same day that it received the amended report from 
Agent Masters. Damon does not identify any pre-trial order that 
was violated by the admission of this evidence, which was 
disclosed more than a month before the May 1, 2024 trial. Nor 
does he point to any evidence of bad faith or intentional 
withholding. 
In State v. Escobido-Ortiz, this court explained that, 
[HRPP Rule 16(b)] requires the State to disclose material 
and information within the prosecutor's possession or 
control; it does not require the prosecution to discover 
relevant evidence by a particular deadline. Indeed, HRPP 
Rule 16(e)(2) contemplates that a prosecutor may discover 
and disclose relevant evidence during trial. By promptly 
disclosing the [evidence] upon learning of [the expert's] analysis, the prosecution complied with its HRPP Rule 16 
obligations with respect to that evidence. 
3 The amended report differed from the original report because, 
inter alia, it included a new "data session . . . that is a reliable indicator of [Damon's] phone's location." 
7   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  109 Hawaiʻ i 359, 363-64, 126 P.3d 402, 406-07 (App. 2005) 
(emphasis added) (cleaned up). 
On this record, we conclude that the State's prompt 
disclosure of the amended report complied with HRPP Rule 
16(e)(2)'s continuing duty to disclose, and that the circuit 
court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Agent Masters to 
testify regarding his amended report. 
(3) Damon contends that the circuit court erred in 
admitting the testimonies of two State witnesses, Liʻi and 
Schneider, because these witnesses were disclosed to Damon after trial call in violation of HRPP Rule 16. 
Damon moved to preclude 
Liʻi and Schneider's 
testimonies, and the circuit court held an evidentiary hearing 
at which Honolulu Police Department Detective Justin Higa 
(Detective Higa) testified. Detective Higa testified that 
neither Liʻ i nor Schneider had initially come forward to give 
statements to the police, and that he was not able to interview 
them until March 11, 2024. Among other things, while it appears 
that Detective Higa lacked Liʻ i and Schneider's contact 
information, the circuit court's April 23, 2024 "Findings of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Defendant's Motion 
to Preclude Evidence Filed April 2, 2024" (Order Denying 
Preclusion) noted that Detective Higa included the names of 
these two witnesses as "Ridge" and "Andreas" in his November 25, 
8   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   
 
 
    
 
  
  
  
 2022 closing report.4 Detective Higa testified that he disclosed 
Liʻi and Schneider's March 11, 2024 recorded interviews to the 
State "right away." The State promptly disclosed Detective 
Higa's supplemental report with these additional witness 
statements in March 2024, which was over a month before the 
May 1, 2024 trial. 
Damon does not identify any evidence demonstrating the 
State knew that Detective Higa intended to interview Liʻ i and 
Schneider prior to receiving their recorded interviews in March 2024, or that the State failed to promptly disclose the 
recordings of Liʻ i
 and Schneider's interviews. See State ex rel.
Kaneshiro v. Huddy, 82 Hawaiʻ i 188, 195, 921 P.2d 108, 115 (1996) 
("HRPP Rule 16(b)(1)(i) does not obligate the prosecution to 
disclose the name and address of, or statements made by, any 
person, unless and until the prosecution intends to call that 
person as a witness in the presentation of the evidence in 
chief.") (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). 
On this record, we conclude that the circuit court did 
not abuse its discretion in admitting Liʻ i
 and Schneider's 
testimonies.5 
4 The findings of fact are unchallenged. 
5 In conjunction with point of error (3), Damon challenges 
conclusions of law 1 through 5 in the Order Denying Preclusion. We conclude 
that conclusions of law 1 through 5 are not wrong. See State v. Lavoie, 145 
 (continued . . .) 
9   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
   
  
 
   
 (4) Damon contends that the circuit court plainly 
erred by failing to sua sponte instruct the jury as to self-
defense.6 "When jury instructions or the omission thereof are at 
issue on appeal, the standard of review is whether, when read and considered as a whole, the instructions given are 
prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or 
misleading." State v. Culkin, 97 Hawaiʻ i 206, 213, 35 P.3d 233, 
240 (2001). 
"Criminal defendants are entitled to jury instructions 
on every defense or theory of defense having any support in the 
evidence." Id. at 214, 35 P.3d at 241 (citations omitted). 
However, "where evidentiary support for an asserted defense, or 
for any of its essential components, is clearly lacking, it 
would not be error for the trial court to refuse to charge on 
the issue or to instruct the jury not to consider it." State v.
Tuaolo, No. CAAP-19-0000060, 2023 WL 4044583, at *2 (Haw. App. June 16, 2023) (SDO) (cleaned up). 
Pursuant to HRS § 703-304(2) (2014), "[t]he use of 
deadly force is justifiable under this section if the actor believes that deadly force is necessary to protect himself 
5(. . .continued) 
Hawaiʻi 409, 421, 453 P.3d 229, 241 (2019) ("Conclusions of law are reviewed 
de novo under the right/wrong standard of review.") (citation omitted). 
6 Damon withdrew his self- defense and justifiable use of force 
instruction. 
10   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 against death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping, rape, or 
forcible sodomy." The record does not reflect any evidence to 
refute the State's theory that Damon was the initial aggressor, 
or to establish Damon's reasonable belief that shooting the 
Decedent was necessary to his self-defense. 
We therefore conclude that the circuit court's jury 
instructions were not prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, 
inconsistent, or misleading. 
(5) Damon contends that the circuit court committed 
plain error because its special interrogatory failed to instruct the jury on the "state of mind as to possession" required to 
impose a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment pursuant to HRS 
§ 706-660.1.
7 "Because special interrogatories are another way 
in which trial courts instruct juries as to their deliberations and decisions, we review a trial court's special 
interrogatories, or the lack thereof, as we would its jury 
7 HRS § 706- 660.1 states, in pertinent part, 
(1) A person convicted of a felony, where the person had a 
firearm in the person's possession or threatened its use or 
used the firearm while engaged in the commission of the felony, whether the firearm was loaded or not, and whether 
operable or not, may in addition to the indeterminate term 
of imprisonment provided for the grade of offense be 
sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment 
without possibility of parole or probation the length of 
which shall be as follows: 
(a) For murder in the second degree and attempted 
murder in the second degree--up to fifteen years[.] 
11   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 
 
  instructions, or the lack thereof[.]" State v. Sanford, 97 
Hawaiʻi 247, 256, 35 P.3d 764, 773 (2001). 
In State v. Smith, the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court held that, 
"a sentencing enhancement under HRS § 706-660.1 is not an 
element of an underlying offense within the meaning of HRS § 
702-205." 157 
Hawaiʻi 1, 10, 575 P.3d 634, 643 (2025). 
Importantly, HRS § 706- 660.1 does not establish an 
'offense' for possession of a firearm during the commission 
of a felony. . . . HRS § 706- 660.1 establishes factors for 
imposing a mandatory minimum term during sentencing, 
following a predicate conviction. 
Id. at 9, 575 P.3d at 642. The Smith court rejected the 
challenge that an indictment had to allege a state of mind for a 
HRS § 706-660.1 sentencing enhancement. Id. at 8, 575 P.3d at 
642. Here, Damon's HRS § 706-660.1 sentencing enhancement was 
imposed pursuant to his predicate conviction for Murder in the 
Second Degree (Count 1). In finding Damon guilty as to Count 1, the jury found that Damon "intentionally or knowingly engaged in 
conduct" and "by engaging in that conduct, [Damon] intentionally 
or knowingly caused the death of [the Decedent]."   Because a HRS 
§ 706-660.1 sentencing enhancement is not an element of the predicate murder conviction in Count 1, the special 
interrogatory on the enhancement was not required to include a 
state of mind. We therefore conclude that the special interrogatory as to Count 1 was not erroneous.  
12   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 (6) Damon contends, for the first time on appeal, that 
his trial counsel was ineffective. "When a defendant first 
raises the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct 
appeal, the appellate court may consider the merits of the 
appeal de novo if the record is sufficiently developed to 
determine whether there has been ineffective assistance of 
counsel." State v. Salavea, 147 Hawaiʻ i 564, 575, 465 P.3d 1011, 
1022 (2020) (cleaned up). 
In addressing Damon's ineffective assistance of 
counsel claim, we consider whether when, "viewed as a whole," 
trial "counsel's assistance was within the range of competence 
demanded of attorneys in criminal cases." State v. DeLeon, 
131 Hawaiʻ i 463, 478-79, 319 P.3d 382, 397-98 (2014) (citation 
omitted). 
Damon must establish "that there were specific errors 
or omissions reflecting counsel's lack of skill, judgment, or 
diligence," and "that such errors or omissions resulted in 
either the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially 
meritorious defense." State v. Richie, 88 Hawaiʻ i 19, 39, 960 
P.2d 1227, 1247 (1998) (citations omitted). 
On this record, we conclude Damon does not establish 
that his counsel was ineffective in failing to cross-examine 
witnesses about the Decedent's alleged gang membership, drug 
dealing, and gun use. Nor does he establish that his counsel 
was ineffective for failing to object to Agent Masters' amended 
13   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   report being admitted into evidence. See Lussier v. Mau-Van
Dev., Inc., 4 Haw.App. 359, 393, 667 P.2d 804, 826 (App. 1983) 
("[O]bjections need not be renewed if the prior ruling on the 
motion in limine amounted to an unequivocal holding concerning 
the issue raised.") (citation omitted). 
The record is insufficient for us to determine whether 
trial counsel was ineffective by not requesting a continuance 
after the circuit court denied Damon's motions to preclude Agent 
Masters' amended report and Liʻ i and Schneider's testimonies.  
Damon contends that a continuance would have provided time for 
defense counsel to consider the retention of an expert to refute 
Agent Masters' testimony, and to look into whether there were 
any issues that could have affected Liʻ i and Schneider's 
credibility. It is unclear whether defense counsel weighed 
these considerations, such that proceeding without a continuance 
was part of the defense's trial strategy. We therefore affirm 
Damon's conviction without prejudice to Damon filing an HRPP 
Rule 40 petition on this point. 
(7) Damon contends that the cumulative impact of the 
alleged points of error deprived him of his right to a fair 
trial. For the reasons discussed supra, Damon's points of error 
(1) through (6) lack merit, and there is therefore no 
"cumulative" error.

 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit 
court's Judgment and Restitution Order.
