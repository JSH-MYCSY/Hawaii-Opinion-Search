IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
TREVOR  STEPHENS,  Plaintiff/Counterclaim  Defendant-Appellee,  v. 
ARON  DEUTSCH  and  EMILY  WESSEL,  Defendants/Counterclaimants/

SHERRY  MATOS,  Third-Party  Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT 
KONA  DIVISION 
(CIVIL  NO.  3DRC-24-0000724) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,   Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka   and  McCullen,   JJ.) 
Upon
 review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On September 19, 2024, self-represented Defendants/ 
Counterclaimants/Third-Party Plaintiffs-Appellants Aron Deutsch 
and Emily Wessel (together, Appellants ) filed a notice of appeal; 
(2) The same day, the Third Circuit district court 
clerk notified Appellants that the filing fees had not been paid, 
and warned Appellants that failure to pay the fees or request a 
fee waiver may result in the appeal being dismissed, or the 
notice of appeal being stricken; 
(3) The record on appeal was due on or before 
November 18, 2024, see Hawai i Rules  of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 11(b)(1), but was not filed because Appellants failed 
to pay the filing fees or obtain a fee waiver; 
(4) On November 19, 2024, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Appellants that the 
time to docket the appeal had expired, Appellants had not paid 
the filing fees or obtained an order allowing Appellants to

proceed on appeal in forma pauperis , the matter would be brought 
to the court's attention on November 29, 2024, for action that 
may include dismissal of the appeal, and Appellants could seek 
relief from default by motion; and 
(5) Appellants have not taken any further action in 
this appeal. An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay 
the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to 
proceed in forma pauperis . HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
