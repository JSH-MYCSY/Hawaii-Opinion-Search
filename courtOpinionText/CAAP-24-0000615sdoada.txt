Father-Appellant (Father ) appeals from the September 9,

Order) entered by the Family Court of the First Circuit (Family
Court).  Pursuant to the Child Protective Act ( CPA), the Family

(Mother) ( Parents), and K.R. and B.R. ( Children), and awarded

abused K.R.  Father also challenges Findings of Fact ( FOFs) 15,
85, 86, 100, 104-08, 128, 130, 132, 140, and 141, some of which
appear to be mixed questions of fact and law.
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Father's
point of error as follows:
Unchallenged FOFs include the following.  The genesis
of this CPA case was a report to DHS of sexual abuse and threat
of sexual abuse to K.R. by Father, threat of sexual abuse to B.R.
by Father, and physical neglect and threat of neglect of both
Children by Mother.   K.R. was forensically interviewed by a
Honolulu Police Department detective and she disclosed, inter
alia, that Father forced her to have sex with him.  DHS social
worker Kelsey Mills ( Mills) gave expert testimony in the areas of
social work and child protective or child welfare services.  The
Family Court found Mills to be a credible witness and accepted
her testimony.2
The gravamen of Father's appeal is that only the
recording of K.R.'s interview, Mills's testimony, and DHS's
February 14, 2024 Safe Family Home Report implicated Father, and
the evidence was insufficient to support the Family Court's
findings and conclusions that Father is the perpetrator of sexual
abuse to K.R. and not able to provide Children with a safe family 
2Father is K.R.'s step father and B.R.'s father.  K.R. was a
teenager, and B.R. was a young school-age child, at the time of the report.

home, even with the assistance of a service plan.  Father also
challenges the Family Court's rejection of Mother's testimony as
not credible, as well as its rejection of the testimony of Dr.
John Mascaro, PhD, with regard to the allegations in the
Petition.  Father points to certain testimony that he asserts
should be given greater weight than the evidence relied on by the
Family Court.
"It is well-settled that an appellate court will not
pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and
the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trier of
fact."  In re Doe, 95 Hawai# i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001). 
"The [trial] judge may accept or reject any witness's testimony
in whole or in part."  State v. Kwong, 149 Hawai#i 106, 112, 482
P.3d 1067, 1073 (2021).  There is substantial evidence supporting
the Family Court's findings and we are not left with a definite
and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.  See Doe, 95
Hawai#i at 190, 20 P.3d at 623.
We will not disturb the Family Court's assessment of
the credibility of the witnesses in this case.  While there were
some inconsistencies between parts of Mills' testimony and K.R.'s
recorded interview, viewing all of the evidence before the Family
Court, we cannot conclude that the Family Court clearly erred in
its findings or abused its discretion in its determination that
Father is the perpetrator of sexual abuse to K.R. and he is not
willing or able to provide Children with a safe family home, even
with the assistance of a service plan.
