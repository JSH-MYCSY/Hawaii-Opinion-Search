MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
K.T.
 (Father) is the legal father and J.J. ( Mother) is 
the natural mother of I.T., A.T.1, A.T.2, K.T.2, and L.T. 
(collectively, Children ). Mother is the natural mother and K.D. 
is the natural and legal father of T.J.1 Father appeals from the 
September 9, 2024 "Orders Concerning Child Protective Act" entered in FC-S No. 23-00105 and FC-S No. 24-00081 by the Family Court of the First Circuit.
2 The orders awarded the state 
Department of Human Services ( DHS) foster custody over I.T., 
1 T.J. was involved in one of the underlying cases but is not a
subject of these appeals. 
2 The Honorable Lesley N. Maloian presided.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
A.T.1, A.T.2, K.T.2, and L.T. and approved a December 5, 2023 
Family Service Plan. The family court erred by overruling Father's objection when DHS asked a doctor for her opinion on T.J.'s and I.T.'s credibility, but we conclude the error was harmless. Accordingly, we affirm the family court orders. 
On December 7, 2023, DHS petitioned to place T.J., 
I.T., A.T.1, A.T.2, and K.T.2 in foster custody, creating FC-S No. 23-00105. The family court held a hearing on September 9, 2024. The Order[] Concerning Child Protective Act was entered on September 9, 2024. Father appealed, creating CAAP-24-0000619. The family court entered findings of fact ( FOF) and conclusions 
of law ( COL) on October 10, 2024, consistent with Hawai #i Family 
Court Rules ( HFCR) Rule 52(a). 
On June 18, 2024, DHS petitioned to place L.T. in 
foster custody, creating FC-S No. 24-00081. The family court held a hearing on September 9, 2024. The Order[] Concerning Child Protective Act was entered on September 9, 2024. Father appealed, creating CAAP-24-0000620. The family court entered FOFs and COLs on October 10, 2024, consistent with HFCR Rule 52. 
We consolidated the appeals. Father challenges several 
FOFs and one COL entered in both cases. We review findings of fact under the clearly erroneous  standard, and conclusions of law 
under the right/wrong  standard. Est. of Klink ex rel. Klink v. 
State, 113 Hawai #i 332, 351, 152 P.3d 504, 523 (2007). We review 
a mixed finding of fact and conclusion of law under the clearly 
erroneous  standard because it implicates the facts and 
circumstances of the case. Id. A ruling supported by the trial 
court's findings and correctly applying the law will not be overturned. Id. 
Unchallenged FOFs are binding on appeal. In re Doe , 99 
Hawai#i 522, 538, 57 P.3d 447, 463 (2002). Father has not 
challenged these FOFs:

[I.T.] did not. Later in the day, the DHS spoke with [RCG].During this telephone conversation, [I.T.] came onto thephone, crying and reported that she was afraid of the CJC[(Children's Justice Center)] interviewer, and didn't tellthat "her daddy had touched her flower" because her daddytold her that if she told anyone he would take away hermother and blame it on her.

. . . . 
66. On February 6, 2024, the GAL [guardian ad litem]
filed his Guardian Ad Litem's Settlement/Pretrial Statement.The GAL argued . . .

78. On March 25, 2024 and March 27, 2024, [Father]
underwent a Psychosexual Risk Assessment. The MSI II 
Overview  of the Psychosexual indicates the following: 
That [Father's] test taking behavior indicates he wasdefensive on testing and the information is limited."He [sic] is defensive about expressing interest insex, which suggests he is trying to "look good"sexually on the examination. He may be attempting toconvince the evaluator that sine [sic] he has littleinterest in sex, he has to [sic] sexual problems. He was inconsistent in his response to the repeated itemwhich refers to having committed a sex offense. He acknowledges some type of sexual behavior occurred,i.e., he did not plan it, it was an accident, theperson acted older, he made a mistake, etc. [sic] 
. . . . 128. On November 9, 2023, [T.J.] disclosed to her RCG

The DHS also met with [I.T.] alone and she disclosed that [Father] had alsotouched her and pointed to her vagina area. [I.T.] alsodisclosed to the resource care giver that [Father] told herthat if she told anyone, he would take away her mother fromher and blame her that she was touching herself. 
. . . . 
131. On November 20, 2023, [T.J.] and [I.T.]
participated in a forensic interview at the CJC. 
[T.J.]
disclosed sex abuse by [Father] during the interview, while[I.T.] did not. Later after the interview, while the DHSwas talking to the resource care giver on the phone, [I.T.]came on the phone crying and said that she was afraid of theinterviewer, that "her [sic] daddy had touched her "flower",and that he told her if she told anyone he would take awayher mother and blame it on her. 
132. On November 21, 2023, the DHS spoke with
Dr. Joseph Giovannoni ("Dr. Giovannoni"), [Father]'sprevious sex offender provider. Dr. Giovannoni reluctantly,clinically discharged [Father] but had continued concernsbecause [Father] did not appear to have fully engaged intreatment and was just going through the motions to satisfyhis probation. Dr. Giovannoni had met with Mother and completed a safety plan with her regarding [Father] and thecrossing of sexual boundaries. Dr. Giovannoni recommended that the Prosecutor's Office be informed of [T.J.]'sdisclosure and that [Father] complete another sex offenderassessment. 
133. On November 24, 2023, the DHS confirmed the
following harms or threatened harms to the Children:(1) sexual abuse to [T.J.] and [I.T.] by [Father]; 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) threat of sexual abuse to the Children by [Father] and
Mother; [and] (3) threat of neglect to the Children by[Father] and Mother[.] . . . 
134. On February 22, 2024, a Multidisciplinary Team
("MDT") meeting was convened at the DHS' request thatincluded various professionals, including a pediatrician, apsychologist, a nurse, and an independent social worker notemployed by the DHS. The purpose of the MDT was to(1) assist in the development of an appropriate service planfor the family; and (2) assist in case review/direction andthe current status of the case. 
135. The February 22, 2024, MDT found that due to the
CJC interview with [T.J.], [Father]'s past conviction ofsexually abusing a minor, Parents' lack of engagement inservices, and Mother's refusal to hold [Father] responsiblefor sexually abusing [T.J.] and [I.T.], neither parent haddemonstrated the ability to provide a safe and protectivehome for the Children. 
136. The February 22, 2024, MDT recommended that no
children should reside with [Father] and Mother until theycan demonstrate safe and protective caregiving abilities. 
137. On April 12, 2024, another MDT meeting was
convened to address [Father]'s psychosexual assessment aswell as to continue to (1) assist in the development of anappropriate service plan for the family; and (2) assist incase review/direction and the current status of the case. 
138. The April 12, 2024, MDT found no substantial
change in the protective stance of Mother and [Father]regarding the sexual abuse disclosed by [T.J.] and [I.T.].Both parents continue to deny that any sexual abuse occurredand therefore, the risk of further sexual abuse has not beenaddressed. 
[Father]'s most recent psychosexual evaluation
indicates positive impression management and defensiveness,elevated risk for child molestation, poor impulse control,difficulty with authority, and conflict in interpersonalrelationships. The continued diagnosis of antisocialpersonality disorder indicates a high treatment resistantcriminal mindset established over time. These results are consistent with Dr. Giovannoni's statement that emphasizes areluctance to provide clinical discharge as the priortreatment episode did not seem to effect substantial changesin the attitudes and beliefs that drive behavior, and thatthe likelihood to re-offend was still significant. 
(Footnotes omitted). 
Father challenges FOF no. 58 (in both cases): 
58. On November 24, 2023, sex abuse to [T.J.] by her
mother's boyfriend, [Father], was confirmed; Sex abuse of[I.T.] by her father [Father] was confirmed; Threat of sexabuse to [I.T., A.T.1, A.T.2, and K.T.2] by their parents,[Father] and [Mother] was confirmed; Threatened neglect of[T.J., I.T., A.T.1, A.T.2, and K.T.2] by their mother,[Mother], and mother's boyfriend/children's father [Father]was confirmed[.] 
6 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Father argues this finding doesn't state the name of 
the person who made these confirmations. Father's argument is 
not persuasive because the findings are directly supported by DHS's December 5, 2023 Safe Family Home Report  prepared by social 
worker Kaleimomi Cezar, admitted as Exhibit 2. Cezar testified 
and was subject to cross-examination. Hawaii Revised Statute (HRS) § 587A-18(d)(2018). The family court qualified her as an 
expert in social work and child protective and child welfare 
services, and found she was credible. FOF no. 58 was not clearly erroneous. 
Father challenges FOF no. 73 (in both cases) in part: 
73. . . . There were clear disclosures of sexual 
abuse by [Father] on November 20, 2023, during the CJC
interviews. 
Father argues I.T. disclosed no sexual abuse during her 
November 20, 2023 CJC interview. She didn't. But DHS's Safe 
Family Home Report states that after the interview ended, I.T. spontaneously said "her daddy had touched her flower" and he told her "if she told anyone he would take away her mother and blame it on her." Father is correct that I.T.'s disclosure happened after the formal interview ended, but the family court's error was harmless because the record has evidence that I.T. disclosed sex abuse by Father on November 20, 2023. 
Father challenges FOF no. 88 (in both cases) in part: 
88. . . . The Court denied [Father]'s request for
. . . a copy of his psychosexual evaluation. 
Father doesn't dispute the finding, but argues the 
family court abused its discretion by denying him a copy of his psychosexual evaluation because he "has the right to have another psychosexual evaluator review his evaluation." A court abuses its discretion if it clearly exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party. Est. of Klink, 113 
Hawai#i at 
352, 152 P.3d at 524. The family court ordered that all 
7 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
evaluations be given to Father's counsel. Father could have 
reviewed the evaluation with counsel and asked for a review by another evaluator. He doesn't explain how not having his own copy of the evaluation deprived him of a chance to have another evaluator review it. The family court acted within its discretion by denying Father's request for another copy. 
Father challenges FOF no. 95 in FC-S No. 23-00105, 
which is FOF no. 107 in FC-S No. 24-00081, in part: 
95. At the conclusion of the GAL's testimony, the
parties gave brief closing arguments and the Court found by
a preponderance of the evidence that based upon the reportssubmitted pursuant to HRS §§ 587A-7 and 587A-18 and therecord herein, that there is an adequate basis to sustainthe Petition in that the Children are children whose physical or psychological health or welfare has been harmedor is subject to threatened harm by the acts or omissions ofthe Children's family; (2.)[sic] The DHS is awarded fostercustody over the children[.] 
Father argues there was insufficient evidence he 
sexually abused T.J. and I.T.: no evidence about the dates the 
alleged sex abuse occurred; I.T. at first denied sex abuse; and T.J. did not disclose sex abuse during her initial interviews. FOF nos. 95/107 are supported by unchallenged FOF nos. 43, 45, 48, 49, 50, and 54, and by the testimony of DHS social workers Cezar and Renee San Nicolas , William Gillespie , whom the family 
court qualified as an expert in sex offender polygraph examination, and Francisco Najera, Ph.D., all of whom the court 
found to be credible. FOF nos. 95/107 were not clearly erroneous. 
Father challenges FOF no. 105 in FC-S No. 23-00105: 
"[T.J.]'s and [I.T.]'s disclosures of sex abuse by [Father] were consistent and credible." 
Father argues T.J. did not disclose 
sex abuse in her first interview with the police, I.T. did not disclose sex abuse in her CJC interviews, and when I.T. was interviewed by CJC she said Parents never harmed her or T.J. FOF no. 105 is supported by the family court's unchallenged findings that T.J. and I.T. had disclosed sex abuse by Father multiple times to multiple people. Father denied sexually abusing T.J. 
8 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and I.T. but the family court found him "not a credible 
witness[.]" "It is well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." In re Doe
, 95 Hawai#i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001). 
FOF no. 105 was not clearly erroneous. 
Father challenges FOF no. 116 in FC-S No. 23-00105, 
which is FOF no. 126 in FC-S No. 24-00081: 
116. [Father]'s current involvement with child
protective/welfare services and the family court is due to
his sex abuse of [T.J.] and [I.T.] and domestic violencewith Mother, which directly caused the Children to besubject to the abuse and threat of abuse and neglect. 
Father argues DHS only became involved because K.T.2 
suffered a seizure, and there is no evidence that domestic 
violence occurred in Children's presence. The family court found, and Father doesn't dispute, that Children's Aunty took 
K.T.2 to an emergency room with a high fever and seizures on October 18, 2023. DHS met with Mother and Father on October 19, 2023. On October 20, 2023, Aunty told DHS that Father and Mother "have a history of domestic violence." DHS also met with K.D. (T.J.'s father) who stated he wasn't letting T.J. have contact with Father because of an ongoing investigation by HPD DetectiveIzuka. Detective Izuka gave DHS a copy of T.J.'s forensic 
interview on October 24, 2023. DHS's further investigation 
revealed evidence that Father had sexually abused T.J. and I.T. The family court became involved on December 7, 2023, when DHS filed the Petition for Temporary Foster Custody in FC-S No. 23-00105. FOF nos. 116/126 were not clearly erroneous. 
Father challenges FOF no. 119 in FC-S No. 23-00105: 
119. [Father] sexually abused [T.J.] and [I.T.] 
The family court made a similar finding in FC-S No. 24-
00081, FOF no. 129, that "[Father] sexually abused [L.T.]'s siblings [T.J.] and [I.T.]" Father argues there was substantial evidence that K.D. coached T.J. to lie about Father sexually 
9 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
abusing her. FOF nos. 119 and 129 are supported by the family 
court's unchallenged findings and substantial evidence in the record. They were not clearly erroneous. 
Father challenges FOF nos. 140, 143, and 144 in FC-S 
No. 23-00105, which are FOF nos. 150, 153, and 154 in FC-S No. 24-00081: 
140. On May 22, 2024, [Father] participated in a
polygraph examination with William Gillespie
("Mr. Gillespie"). The polygraph examination results showedno deception was indicated to the relevant questions. The polygraph exam was valid in regards to manner and method ofhow it was conducted and as to the results. It was conducted on a properly functioning instrument, [Father] wasproperly interviewed, and [Father] produced usable data tomake a proper conclusion. 
The limitation to polygraph exams in cases like
[Father]'s is what information is provided as well as whatcan be tested in the exam. 
Mr. Gillespie was provided very
little information. Based on the information provided,Mr. Gillespie conducted a polygraph examination related to[Father] engaging in behaviors for sexual gratificationpurposes. [Father] was found to be truthful on that point.In this situation the client controls the examination and not the examiner and the results are a weak examination with a lot of room for interpretation. 
. . . . 
143. The limited results of the polygraph examination
do not negate [Father]'s sex abuse of [T.J.] and [I.T] and
the risk of future sexual abuse of the Children. 
144. The limited results of the polygraph examination
do not negate the current need for [Father] to participatein sex abuse treatment until clinically discharged. 
Father argues: the finding "the results are a [weak] 
examination with a lot of room for interpretation" is contrary to 
the findings that the "polygraph exam was valid in regards to manner and method of how it was conducted and as to the results"; the "polygraph speaks for itself and clearly found no deception when asked whether he sexually abused T.J. or I.T."; and Dr. Francisco Najera "testified that Father cannot receive a 
clinical discharge without admitting the sexual abuse." 
Father's argument is not persuasive. The polygraph 
examiner did not ask Father whether he sexually abused T.J. or I.T. The questions and answers were: 
10 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1) Have you ever physically touched [T.J.] for a
sexual reason? 
NO 
2) Have you ever physically touched [I.T.] for a
sexual purpose? 
NO 
3) Have you ever exposed your bare genitals to any
of your children you children [sic] for sexualpurpose? 
NO 
Gillespie testified that "sexual abuse is actually not 
rooted in . . . sexual pleasure, but in power and control." 
Thus, limiting the questions to sexual reasons or purposes weakened the examination. The family court explained in this unchallenged finding: 
141. Sexual misconduct is broader in scope than just
for sexual gratification purposes. It includes sexual 
harassment, creating sexually hostile environments, andbeing sexually demeaning. Its foundation is in power andcontrol. Touching for [Father]'s own sexual gratificationwould not be in the same test as touching as a form of poweror control. 
Father's argument about Dr. Najera's testimony seems to 
be that because he was truthful about not touching T.J. or I.T. 
for sexual reasons or purposes, he could never be clinically discharged because he couldn't admit to something he didn't do. But the family court explained in this unchallenged finding: 
142. Polygraph examinations are used therapeutically
as part of a client's ongoing supervision and treatment. It 
helps to identify and clarify behaviors which allow forbetter decision making as it relates to needed services andoverall decision making. 
FOF nos. 140/150, 143/153, and 144/154 were not clearly 
erroneous. 
Father challenges FOF no. 145 in FC-S No. 23-00105, 
which is FOF no. 155 in FC-S No. 24-00081: 
11 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
145. The Children's physical or psychological health
or welfare have been harmed and is subject to threatened
harm by the acts or omissions of the Children's family. 
Father argues, "[t]his is a broad finding that covers 
every possibility. There is no expert testimony by a mental 
health professional that there is harm or threatened harm to the children's psychological health or welfare." The finding was supported by the family court's unchallenged findings and substantial evidence in the record. The family court had to make this finding to have jurisdiction over DHS's petitions. HRS § 587A-28(d)(1) (2018) (requiring a family court to determine "[w]hether the [subject] child's physical or psychological health or welfare has been harmed or is subject to threatened harm by the acts or omissions of the child's family"). Father cites no authority to support his argument that expert testimony was required. FOF nos. 145/155 were not clearly erroneous. 
Father challenges FOF no. 149 in FC-S No. 23-00105, 
which is FOF no. 159 in FC-S No. 24-00081: 
149. [Father] is currently not willing and able to
provide the Children with a safe family home, even with the
assistance of a service plan. 
Father argues he and Mother had acquired housing by the 
time of the September 9, 2024 return hearing. Living in a house 
is only one of the factors the family court must consider to make a "safe family home" determination. HRS § 587A-7 (2018). FOF nos. 149/159 are supported by the family court's unchallenged findings and substantial evidence in the record. They were not clearly erroneous. 
Father challenges FOF no. 152 and COL no. 20 in FC-S 
No. 23-00105, which are FOF no. 162 and COL no. 20 in FC-S No. 24-00081: 
152. The Service Plan . . . , is fair, appropriate,
and comprehensive in addressing the identified safety
issues. 
. . . . 
12 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
20. The Service Plan . . . , is fair, appropriate,
and comprehensive in addressing the identified safety
issues. 
Father argues the service plan requires him to take 
part in sex offender treatment with Dr. Najera, who testified 
that Father cannot receive a clinical discharge without admitting to sexual abuse. The family court's mixed findings and conclusions are supported by the family court's unchallenged findings and substantial evidence in the record, and reflect a correct application of the law. They were not clearly erroneous. 
Father challenges FOF no. 153 in FC-S No. 23-00105, 
which is FOF no. 163 in FC-S No. 24-00081, in part: 
153. None of the underlying facts and data upon which
the DHS based its opinions, assessments, and recommendations
were shown to be untrustworthy. 
Father argues the "record does not contain evidence of 
how the DHS reconciled nondisclosure by T.J. and I.T. during 
formal interviews by HPD and the CJC." Father cites no authority requiring DHS to justify a child witness's initial reluctance to reveal abuse. FOF nos. 153/163 are supported by the family court's unchallenged findings and substantial evidence in the record. They were not clearly erroneous. 
Father challenges FOF no. 157 in FC-S No. 23-00105, 
which is FOF no. 167 in FC-S No. 24-00081: 
157. [Father] was not a credible witness, and the
Court rejects his testimony in part. 
Father argues the "finding does not identify what 
testimony is rejected in part to find him not credible." The family court, as the trier of fact, is the sole evaluator of a witness's credibility. In re Doe, 95 
Hawai#i at 190, 20 P.3d at 
623. The family court did not have to specify why it found Father not credible, or which testimony it rejected. FOF nos. 157/167 were not clearly erroneous. 
Without identifying a FOF, Father argues the family 
court: 
13 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
erred in finding medical neglect by [Father] when K.T.[2]
was not taken to his follow-up doctor appointment after hisseizure. Mother and [Father] being homeless they allowedrelatives to care for K.T.[2]. K.T.[2] was in the care ofthese relatives when he had his seizure. [Father] expectedthese relatives to take K.T.[2] to his follow-upappointment. They did not. There is no evidence in the record that [Father] intentionally did not take K.T.[2] tothe follow-up appointment. 
The family court addressed medical neglect in FOF 
no. 73: 
73. The MDT also reviewed its previous report dated
November 16, 2023, and found that it had previously assessedthat [K.T.2]'s seizure was not due to abuse. The minor had a febrile seizure due to an ear infection, which his fatherfailed to bring him in for a follow-up care. Althoughparents gave permission for an aunt and uncle to care for[K.T.2], they did not allow aunt and uncle to take him forfollow-up care; this is consistent with medical neglect. 
The issue was also discussed in this unchallenged FOF: 
25. [Aunty] reported that it was difficult for her
to access medical care for the children because [Father] andMother insisted that they would tell [Aunty] when thechildren's doctors' appointments were scheduled. [Father]and Mother also insisted that she transport everyone to thechildren's appointments. Neither [Father] nor Mother told[Aunty] when [K.T.2]'s follow-up appointments were after hisfirst visit to the ED, when his ear infection was initiallydiagnosed. 
The family court's finding about medical neglect was 
supported by the family court's unchallenged finding and 
substantial evidence in the record. It was not clearly erroneous. 
Without citing to the record, Father argues the family 
court "erred by allowing Dr. Natarajan to testify as to the credibility of T.J. and I.T. over [Father]'s objection." The family court qualified Kayal Natarajan , M.D., FAAP, as an expert 
in pediatric medicine and child abuse and neglect. During Dr. Natarajan's direct examination this happened: 
Q. Doctor, in your -- in your second assessment,
February 22nd, 2024, is it correct in stating that part of
the documents or the information you reviewed was the fourCJC interviews of the children? 
14 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
A. Yes, we did review those. I did. 
Q. Okay. And, Doctor, in your opinion, do you find
the children credible? 
A. Yes, I do. 
[FATHER'S ATTORNEY]: Objection, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Basis? [FATHER'S ATTORNEY]: That's for the Court to decide. THE COURT: Overruled. Q. (BY [DHS'S ATTORNEY]) Doctor, can you please
answer that question again? Do you find the children
credible in the four CJC interviews in this case? 
A. Yes, I do. As a pediatrician, I do. 
The supreme court has held: 
Child victims of sexual abuse have exhibited some 
patterns of behavior which are seemingly inconsistent withbehavioral norms of other victims of assault. Two such types of behavior are delayed reporting of the offenses andrecantation of allegations of abuse. Normally, suchbehavior would be attributed to inaccuracy or prevarication.In these situations it is helpful for the jury to know thatmany child victims of sexual abuse behave in the same
manner. Expert testimony exposing jurors to the unique
interpersonal dynamics involved in prosecutions forintrafamily child sexual abuse may play a particularlyuseful role by disabusing the jury of some widely heldmisconceptions so that it may evaluate the evidence free ofthe constraints of popular myths[.] 
State v. Batangan, 71 Haw. 552, 557–58, 799 P.2d 48, 51-52 (1990) 
(cleaned up). But in criminal cases involving sex abuse of a child, an expert witness's "conclusory opinions that . . . the child victim's report of abuse is truthful and believable is of no assistance to the jury, and therefore, should not be admitted. Such testimony is precluded by [Hawaii Rules of Evidence] Rule 702." Id. at 558, 799 P.2d at 52. "[E]xperts may not give opinions which in effect usurp the basic function of the jury." Id. at 562, 799 P.2d at 54. The family court erred by overruling Father's objection when the State asked for Dr. Natarajan's opinion about T.J. and I.T.'s credibility. 
15  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In Batangan  the complaining witness testified at trial. 
The supreme court stated: "As in most child sexual abuse cases, 
where the only evidence consists of the victim's accusation and the defendant's denial, expert testimony on the question of who to believe is nothing more than advice to jurors on how to decide the case." Id. at 559, 799 P.2d at 52 (quotation mark omitted). 
Here, the family court's finding that Father sexually abused T.J. and I.T. was supported by DHS's December 5, 2023 Safe Family Home Report, testimony from Cezar, San Nicolas, Gillespie, and Dr. Najera, the family court's unchallenged findings of fact, and the court's finding that Father was not a credible witness. Under these circumstances, the court's evidentiary ruling about Dr. Natarajan was harmless error. See State v. McDonnell, 141 Hawai#i 280, 297-98, 409 P.3d 684, 701-02 (2017) (stating that 
error in admitting expert's testimony on statistics was harmless because "[e]rror should not be viewed in isolation and considered purely in the abstract, but must be examined in light of the entire proceedings and given the effect to which the whole record shows it is entitled" (quotation marks omitted)). 
The September 9, 2024 Orders Concerning Child 
Protective Act entered in FC-S No. 23-00105 and FC-S No. 24-00081 are affirmed.
