ORDER  DISMISSING   APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,   Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka   and  Wadsworth,   JJ.) 
Upon
 review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On October 4, 2024, self-represented Defendant-
Appellant Michael Mansell (Mansell ) filed a notice of appeal. 
(2) The statement of jurisdiction was due on or before 
November 18, 2024, and the opening brief was due on or before 
December 18, 2024. 
(3) On December 26, 2024, the appellate clerk entered a 
"Default of Statement of Jurisdiction & Opening Brief." 
(4) The
 court's February 7, 2025 Order granted 
Mansell's motion for relief from default, and extended the 
deadline for Mansell to file the statement of jurisdiction and 
opening brief to March 10, 2025. The February 7, 2025 Order 
stated: "Any further default of the statement of jurisdiction 
or opening brief may result in sanctions authorized by 
[Hawai i Rules  of Appellate Procedure] Rules 12.1(e) and 30, 
including, without limitation, monetary sanctions, the appeal 
being dismissed, or both."

 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
