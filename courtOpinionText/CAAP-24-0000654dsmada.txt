IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
TREVOR  STEPHENS,  Plaintiff/Counterclaim  Defendant-Appellee,  v. 
ARON  DEUTSCH  and  EMILY  WESSEL,  Defendants/Counterclaimants/ 
Third-Party  Plaintiffs-Appellants,  and 
SHERRY  MATOS,  Third-Party  Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT 
KONA  DIVISION 
(CIVIL  NO.  3DRC-24-0000724) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka  and  McCullen,  JJ.) 
Upon consideration of
 the Motion to Strike, Expunge, 
and Seal Document Erroneously Filed on October 11, 2024 Under 
Dkt. 8 (Motion), the paper in support, and the record, it appears 
that: 
(1) On October 8, 2024, self-represented Defendants/ 
Counterclaimants/Third-Party Plaintiffs-Appellants Aron Deutsch 
and Emily Wessel (together, Appellants) filed a notice of appeal; 
(2) On October 9, 2024, the district court clerk 
notified Appellants that the filing fees had not been paid, and 
failure to pay the fees or request a fee waiver may result in the 
appeal being dismissed or the notice of appeal being stricken; 
(3) The record on appeal was due on or before 
December 9, 2024, see Hawai i  Rules of  Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 11(b)(1), but was not filed because Appellants failed to pay 
the filing fees or obtain a fee waiver; 
(4) On December 16, 2024, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Appellants that the          
          
         
          
          
         
    
        
           
          
          
        
        
           
         
         
        
   
        
  
       
      
         
           
        
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
time to docket the appeal had expired, Appellants had not paid 
the filing fees or obtained an order allowing Appellants to 
proceed on appeal in forma pauperis, the matter would be brought 
to the court's attention on December 26, 2024, for action that 
may include dismissal of the appeal, and Appellants could seek 
relief from default by motion; 
(5) Appellants have not taken any further action in 
this appeal. An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay 
the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to 
proceed in forma pauperis. HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2); 
(6) In the Motion, Appellants seek to strike, expunge, 
and/or seal a document they mistakenly filed at docket 8 that is 
unrelated to this appeal and contains personal information; and 
(7) The court finds docket 8 is unrelated to this 
appeal and contains personal information. See Hawai i Court 
Records Rules Rule 2.19.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
granted as follows: 
1. The document filed at docket 8 is stricken. 
2. The appellate clerk shall seal docket 8. 
3. Within ten (10) days from the date of this order, 
any individual may file a motion objecting to the sealing of the 
document. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed.
