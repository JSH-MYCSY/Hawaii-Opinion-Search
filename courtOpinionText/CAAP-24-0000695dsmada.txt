Dkt. 72 OGMDNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The court lacks appellate jurisdiction because the
Circuit Court has not entered a final, appealable order or
judgment, see Hawai i Revised Statutes ( HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016);
Hawai i Rules of Civil Procedure Rules 54(b), 58; Jenkins v.
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai i 115, 119, 869 P.2d
1334, 1338 (1994), and the orders appealed-from are not
independently appealable under the collateral-order or Forgay1
doctrines, nor has the Circuit Court granted leave for an
interlocutory appeal under HRS ยง 641-1(b).  See Greer v. Baker,
137 Hawai i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (setting forth the
requirements for appealability under the collateral-order
doctrine and the Forgay doctrine); HRS ยง 641-1(b) (specifying
requirements for leave to file interlocutory appeal). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is
granted, and the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are
dismissed.
