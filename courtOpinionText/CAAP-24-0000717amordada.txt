(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Guidry, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record in CAAP-24-0000717 and

Basic Speed Rule," and ordered fines totaling $157. The April 
19, 2024 Judgment notified Valientino: 
"If your plea was 
mitigated , the judgment is final and no further review is 
permitted." Valientino paid the $157 fine on April 30, 2024.

Hawai#i Rules of Evidence Rule 201. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) HRS ยง 291D-7(c)(2) (Supp. 2023) states that when "a 
written explanation is included with an answer admitting 
commission of the infraction, the court shall enter judgment for the State" and "[t]here shall be no appeal from the judgement." 
(4) Even if the April 19, 2024 Judgment was appealable, 
Valientino filed the Notice of Appeal on October 28, 2024, which is more than thirty days after the District Court entered the April 19, 2024 Judgment. See Hawai#i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 4(a)(1) ("When a civil appeal is permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable order."). 
(5) When the court "perceive[s] a jurisdictional defect 
in an appeal, [it] must, sua sponte , dismiss that appeal." Bacon 
v. Karlin , 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.
