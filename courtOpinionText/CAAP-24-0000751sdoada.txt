LLC (collectively, the Taxpayers ) appeal from the Tax Appeal 
Court's "Order Denying (1) [ Taxpayers '] Motion for Taxation of 
Attorneys' Fees, Filed August 29, 2024; and (2) [ Taxpayer s'] 
Application for Oral Hearing on Motion for Taxation of 
Attorneys' Fees" (Order Denying Attorneys' Fees ), filed by the 
Tax Appeal Court1 on October 2, 2024. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve the 
Taxpayers ' appeal as follows. 
The Taxpayers raise a single point of error on appeal, 
contending that "[t]he Tax Appeal Court erred in entering the 
Fee Denial Order because [the Taxpayers ] are entitled to their 
reasonable attorney's fees under [Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS)] 
§ 607-14 [(2016)] for prevailing against the City in their real 
property tax refund claims, which are 'in the nature of 
assumpsit.'" Appellee -Appellee City and County of Honolulu 
contends that the Tax Appeal Court lacked jurisdiction or was 
otherwise not authorized to award atto rneys' fees, and therefore 
did not err in denying Taxpayers' fees request. 
We review a trial court's grant or denial of 
attorneys' fees for abuse of discretion. Gailliard v.

However, "[t]he existence of jurisdiction is a question of law 
that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard." Tax 
Found. of Haw. v. State , 144 Hawaiʻi 175, 18 5, 439 P.3d 127, 137 
(2019) (cleaned up). 
Pursuant to the American Rule, each party generally 
pays its own litigation expenses. Oahu Publ 'ns, Inc. v. 
Abercrombie , 134 Hawaiʻi 16, 23, 332 P.3d 159, 166 (2014) 
(citation omitted) . Exceptions exist, however, and attorneys' 
fees may be awarded to the prevailing party "when so authorized 
by statute, rule of court, agreement, stipulation, or 
precedent." Id. (citations omitted). 
Here, the Taxpayers contend that they are entitled to 
attorney s' fees as the prevailing party because their claim s, 
which sought the refund of real property tax assessment s, were 
"in the nature of assumpsit. " Pursuant to HRS § 607-14, 
In all the courts, in all actions in the nature of 
assumpsit  and in all actions on a promissory note or other 
contract in writing that provides for an attorney's fee, 
there shall be taxed as attorneys '  fees, to be paid by the 
losing party  and to be included in the sum for which 
execution may issue, a fee that the court determines to be 
reasonable ; provided that the attorney representing the 
prevailing party shall submit to the court an affidavit 
stating the amount of time the attorney spent on the action 
and the amount of time the attorney is likely to spend to obtain a final written judgment, or,  if the fee is not 
based on an hourly rate, the amount of the agreed upon fee. 
The court shall then tax attorneys' fees, which the court 
determines to be reasonable, to be paid by the losing 
party; provided that this amount shall not exceed twenty -
five per cent of the judgment.

HRS § 607 -14 (emphasis added) . Assumpsit is "a common law form 
of action which allows for the recovery of damages for non -
performance of a contract, either express or implied, written or 
verbal, as well as quasi contractual obligations." Blair v. 
Ing, 96 Hawaiʻi 327, 332, 31 P.3d 184, 189 (2001) (citation 
omitted) . 
The Tax Appeal Court does not have jurisdiction over 
common law  actions  "in the nature of assumpsit."   "[T]he right 
to appeal a tax assessment is purely statutory."  Univ.  of Haw.  
v. City and Cnty.  of Honolulu, 102 Hawaiʻi 440, 444, 77 P.3d 478, 
482 (2003); HRS § 232-13  (2017). The  Tax Appeal Court's 
jurisdiction is strictly defined in HRS § 232-13, as follows,  
The jurisdiction of the tax appeal court is limited to the 
amount of valuation or taxes , as the case may be, in 
dispute as shown on the one hand by the amount claimed by 
the taxpayer or county and on the other hand by the amount 
of the assessment, or if increased by the [state taxation] 
board, or equivalent county administrative body, the 
assessment as so increased. 
(Emphasis added.) As the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court has explained , 
As a general matter, subject matter jurisdiction rests in 
the tax appeal court to hear taxpayer appeals from 
assessments , challenges to taxes paid under protest , and 
adverse rulings by the Director.

The Taxpayers' underlying claims were not common law 
claims "in the nature of assumpsit." The Taxpayers' claims, 
which sought real property tax refunds pursuant to HRS chapter

232,2 fell squarely within the confines of the Tax Appeal Court's 
statutor ily circumscribed jurisdiction. And because the 
Taxpayers' claims before the Tax Appeal Court were not "in the 
nature of assumpsit," the Tax Appeal Court did not have 
jurisdiction to award attorneys' fees pursuant to HRS § 607 -14. 
We therefore determine that the Tax Appeal Court did 
not err in denying the Taxpayers ' request for attorneys' fees , 
and affirm the Tax Appeal Court 's October 2, 2024 Order Denying 
Attorneys' Fees . 3

2 HRS chapter 232 does not expressly authorize the Tax Appeal Court 
to award attorneys' fees. 
3 The Taxpayers also filed a Motion for Retention of Oral Argument 
on July 7, 2025. Pursuant to Hawai ʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 34(c), 
that motion is denied.
