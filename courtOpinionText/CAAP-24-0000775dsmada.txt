APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 5CC161000063) 
ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon review of Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-
Appellee Association of Apartment Owners of Kuhio Shores at 
Poipu's February 4, 2025 Motion to Dismiss Appeal (Motion), the 
papers in support and in opposition, and the record, it appears 
that: 
(1) Self-represented Defendant-Appellant William 
Gilliam (Gilliam) appeals from the November 13, 2024 "Order 
Denying Non-Party William H. Gilliam's Petition to Intervene 
Derivatively on Behalf of Pacific Rim Property Services NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Corporation, a dissolved company, Filed on September 3, 2024, 
[Dkt 191]" (November 13, 2024 Order). 
(2) The November 27, 2024 First Amended Complaint for 
Foreclosure added Gilliam as a defendant. 
(3) The circuit court has not entered a judgment. See 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai#i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) (holding that a civil appeal will be 
dismissed if the circuit court has not entered a separate 
judgment under Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 58 or Rule 
54(b)). 
(4) 
The November 13, 2024 Order is not independently 
appealable. Although an order denying an application for 
intervention is generally an appealable collateral order, Hoopai 
v. Civ. Serv. Comm'n
, 106 Hawai#i 205, 215, 103 P.3d 365, 375 
(2004), the denial of an application to intervene is not 
appealable if the applicant is sufficiently involved in the 
action to have a right to appeal its final disposition. 
Stringfellow v. Concerned Neighbors in Action, 480 U.S. 370, 377 
(1987). 
As Gilliam has been added as a defendant, he is 
sufficiently involved to appeal a final order or judgment. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
granted and this appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai#i , May 19, 2025.
