APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CCV-22-0000964) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By:  Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Defendant/Counterclaimant-
Appellee Dan Dan Zhang aka Dandan Zhang's [(Zhang
)] Motion to 
Dismiss [self-represented] Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-
Appellant Di Wu's [(Wu)] Appeal, filed March 24, 2025, the papers 
in support, and the record, it appears that Zhang seeks dismissal 
of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the October 30, 2024 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting [Zhang]'s Motion for Summary Judgment, Filed August 30, 2024 [Dkt. 507]" (Summary Judgment Order) from which Wu appeals is not an appealable order. 
We conclude we lack jurisdiction because the Circuit 
Court has not entered a final, appealable order or judgment, see 
Hawai#i Revised Statutes (
HRS) ยง 641-1(a) (2016); Hawai#i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 58; 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
& Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994); the 
Circuit Court has not reduced the Summary Judgment Order to an 
HRCP Rule 54(b) judgment as to some but less than all claims and parties; the Summary Judgment Order is not independently appealable under the collateral order or Forgay
1 doctrines; and 
the Circuit Court has not granted leave for an interlocutory appeal under HRS ยง 641-1(b). See Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai# i 
249, 253, 369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (setting forth the requirements for appealability under the collateral order and Forgay doctrines); HRS ยง 641-1(b) (specifying requirements for leave to file interlocutory appeal). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is 
granted, and the appeal is dismissed. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.
