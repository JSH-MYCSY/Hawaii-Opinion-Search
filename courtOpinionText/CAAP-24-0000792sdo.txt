(CR. NO. 1CPC-19-0001435) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Robert A.C. Midel
 appeals from the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit's  September 25, 2024 Judgment 
of Conviction and Sentence,  convicting him of Murder in the 
Second Degree, in violation of Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§§ 706-656 (2014), 707-701.5 (2014). 1
On appeal, Midel contends the circuit court erred by 
(1) failing to ensure he knowingly, intelligently, and 
voluntarily waived his right to a jury trial and denying his

 motion to set aside that waiver (points of error (POE) 1 and 2); 
(2) failing to ensure he knowingly, intelligently, and 
voluntarily waived his right to testify (POE 3); and (3) denying 
his motion to dismiss for violation of his speedy trial and 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48  rights (POE 4).  2
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
2 HRPP Rule 48 provides in pertinent part: 
Rule 48. Dismissal. 
(a) By prosecutor. The prosecutor may by leave of court 
file a dismissal of a charge and the prosecution shall 
thereupon terminate. Such a dismissal may not be filed during the trial without the consent of the defendant. 
(b) By court. Except in the case of traffic offenses 
that are not punishable by imprisonment, the court shall, on motion of the defendant, dismiss the charge, with or without prejudice in its discretion, if trial is not 
commenced within 6 months: 
(1) from the date of arrest if bail is set or from the 
filing of the charge, whichever is sooner, on any offense 
based on the same conduct or arising from the same 
criminal episode for which the arrest or charge was made; 
or 
(2) from the date of re- arrest or re- filing of the 
charge, in cases where an initial charge was dismissed 
upon motion of the defendant; or 
(3) from the date of mistrial, order granting a new 
trial or remand, in cases where such events require a new 
trial. 
  Clauses (b)(1) and (b)(2) shall not be applicable to any 
offense for which the arrest was made or the charge was 
filed prior to the effective date of the rule.

  the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve the 
points of error as discussed below and affirm. 
Vincent 
Vanterpool testified that on August 18, 2018, 
he worked for Securitas as a security officer and resided at the 
Nuʻuanu YMCA. At about 2:15 a.m., Vanterpool observed Midel and 
Ryan Cavalear in a hallway "punching each other." As Vanterpool 
approached Midel and Cavalear, Midel "did a right-hand swing 
towards [Cavalear], and [Cavalear's] legs locked up, and 
[Cavalear] fell over." Midel turned around, and Vanterpool saw 
"a large black knife" in Midel's right hand. Vanterpool heard 
Midel "mention[] everybody there was magical, which [Vanterpool] thought was strange." Midel then "looked down at [Cavalear] and 
said, I can't leave him like this, he's still alive" and pushed 
the knife into Cavalear's neck. Cavalear died. 
In October 2018, the State filed a superseding 
indictment charging Midel for Murder in the Second Degree in 
Case No. 1CPC-18-0001355. Midel moved to dismiss for violation 
of HRPP Rule 48; the circuit court granted Midel's motion and 
dismissed the superseding indictment without prejudice. 
In October 2019, the State reindicted Midel for Murder 
in the Second Degree in the proceeding underlying this appeal. The State moved to set a firm trial week and informed the 
circuit court that the former Chief Medical Examiner for the 
City and County of Honolulu, Dr. Christopher Happy (Dr. Happy), 
3
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
  
      
  
  was a necessary witness but now resided on the continent. The 
State noted that HRPP Rule 48 "runs on March 30, 2020." 
A jury trial was scheduled for the week of January 6, 
2020. Midel, against his counsel's advice, waived his right to 
a jury trial. The circuit court set a new trial week beginning 
March 23, 2020. 
On March 16, 2020, days before the scheduled trial, 
the 
Hawaiʻi Supreme Court announced that all ongoing trials would 
be postponed until after April 30, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In re Judiciary's Response to the COVID-19 Outbreak, 
SCMF-20-0000152, docket #1, filed Mar. 16, 2020. 
The circuit court rescheduled Midel's trial from 
March 23, 2020, to May 4, 2020. 
On April 27, 2020, the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court entered an 
order prohibiting persons from entering judiciary facilities if 
they had traveled in the prior fourteen days. In re Judiciary's
Response to the COVID-19 Outbreak, SCMF-20-0000152, docket #19, filed Apr. 27, 2020. The parties agreed to continue the trial 
to June 29, 2020. 
A bench trial was held on June 29 and 30, 2020. At 
the conclusion of proceedings on June 30, the State indicated it 
had one more witness to present, Dr. Happy. The circuit court recessed and scheduled a status conference to discuss when 
Dr. Happy would be able to return to Hawaiʻ i to testify. 
4   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   
 
 
  
  
  On August 10, 2020, at the status conference, the 
parties discussed resuming trial the week of October 12, 2020. 
The State disclosed that Dr. Happy was willing to test for 
COVID-19 to return to testify, but that if a two-week quarantine 
requirement for incoming travelers was reimposed, Dr. Happy 
would not come and the State would request another continuance. 
On October 15, 2020, the circuit court continued the 
trial from October 29, 2020, to November 17, 2020. 
On October 22, 2020, the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court issued 
an order allowing persons who had traveled in the prior fourteen 
days to enter judiciary facilities if they tested negative for COVID-19 within seventy-two hours from the final leg of 
departure. In re Judiciary's Response to the COVID-19 Outbreak, 
SCMF-20-0000152, docket #69, filed Oct. 22, 2020. 
On November 16, 2020, trial was continued again to 
December 29, 2020. 
On December 29, 2020, the State was not ready to 
proceed and requested a three-month continuance. 
The State 
indicated that, in order to fly in to testify on December 29, 
2020, Dr. Happy was required to take a COVID-19 test on Christmas Day, but the State was unable to secure an appointment 
that day or to guarantee that the results would be received on 
time. The deputy prosecuting attorney further informed the 
circuit court that a new deputy would be assigned to complete 
5
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   
 
 
     
  
 
  
 
 the trial, though that was not the reason for the requested 
continuance. Midel's counsel stated, "[w]e understand [HRPP] 
Rule 48 does not apply. . . . But we are objecting to any 
continuance, especially three months." 
Over Midel's objection, 
the circuit court continued the trial to March 25, 2021. 
On March 25, 2021, Dr. Happy testified, and the State 
rested its case-in-chief. Midel waived his right to testify, exercised his right not to testify, and rested without 
presenting any witnesses or evidence. 
On May 26, 2021, Midel moved to dismiss the indictment 
for violation of his speedy trial and HRPP Rule 48 rights (Motion to Dismiss). 
On June 17, 2021, the circuit court denied Midel's 
Motion to Dismiss, found Midel guilty of second-degree murder, 
and scheduled sentencing for September 15, 2021. 
On August 2, 2021, Midel filed a Motion to Appoint 
Three Qualified Examiners pursuant to HRS § 704-404 (Supp. 2020), which was granted.
3 Of the three examiner reports, 
two opined Midel was not fit to proceed, and the third opined that he was. 
3 The Honorable Christine E. Kuriyama presided over the hearings 
pertaining to Midel's fitness to proceed. 
6   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   
 
 
  
 On January 13, 2022, the circuit court found that 
Midel was not fit to proceed and committed Midel to the custody 
of the State Director of Health. 
On March 21, 2022, the Hawaiʻ i State Hospital requested 
that the circuit court appoint a panel to reassess Midel's 
"current fitness to proceed," noting that Midel did "not appear 
to be experiencing symptoms of a mental disease, disorder or 
defect." 
The circuit court granted Hawaiʻ i State Hospital's 
request, and later received three examiner reports, all opining 
that Midel was fit to proceed. The circuit court found Midel 
fit to proceed. 
On July 18, 2023, Midel filed a Motion to Set Aside 
Waiver of Jury Trial. Following a hearing, the circuit court 
denied Midel's motion. 
On September 25, 2024, the circuit court sentenced 
Midel to life in prison with the possibility of parole and ordered restitution. 
Midel timely appealed. (1) First, Midel contends the circuit court erred by 
failing to ensure he knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to a jury trial and by denying his motion to 
set aside that waiver. 
"It is well established that Hawaiʻi law recognizes the 
right to a jury trial as a fundamental right." State v. Torres
, 
7   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  144 Hawaiʻ i 282, 288, 439 P.3d 234, 240 (2019) (footnote 
omitted). "This right cannot be relinquished absent a knowing, 
intelligent, and voluntary waiver." Id.
Defendants carry "the burden of demonstrating by a 
preponderance of the evidence that [their] waiver was 
involuntary." State v. Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawaiʻ i 465, 469, 312 
P.3d 897, 901 (2013) (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted). 
We note that Midel does not point to where in the 
record he objected to the circuit court's colloquy as 
insufficient. See Hawaiʻ i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 28(b)(4) (requiring appellants to state "where in the 
record the alleged error was objected to"). 
(a) Midel argues the circuit erroneously found his 
waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. 
"A waiver is knowing and intelligent when it is made 
with full awareness of both the nature of the right being 
abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it." 
Torres, 144 Hawaiʻi at 288, 439 P.3d at 240 (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted). 
To determine whether a waiver is knowing and 
intelligent, the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court has advised trial courts 
to conduct a 
Duarte-Higareda colloquy, which informs the 
defendant that: "(1) twelve members of the community compose a 
jury, (2) the defendant may take part in jury selection, (3) a 
8   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  jury verdict must be unanimous, and (4) the court alone decides 
guilt or innocence if the defendant waives a jury trial." Id.
(citing U.S. v. Duarte-Higareda
, 113 F.3d 1000, 1002 (9th Cir. 
1997)). 
"A waiver is voluntary when it was the product of a 
free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, 
or deception." Id. (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted). 
Here, the circuit court's questions tracked the 
Duarte-Higareda colloquy. The circuit court explained that 
Midel and his "lawyer and prosecutor will help select 12 people 
from the community"; "all those 12 people must . . . unanimously 
agree that [he is] guilty"; and "[he is] now asking the court to 
listen to the evidence in [his] case and then the court will 
decide whether [he is] guilty or not guilty based on the 
evidence[.]" After each advisement, Midel indicated he understood. Thus, Midel's waiver was knowing and intelligent. 
The circuit court also asked whether anyone was 
forcing Midel to waive his right to a jury trial or "making 
[him] any promises." He responded no. Midel's responses 
indicate his waiver was voluntary. 
(b) Midel argues that the circuit court's colloquy 
failed to consider his history of mental illness (a "salient 
fact"), which the circuit court was apprised of through the 
9
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  pretrial bail report in Case No. 1CPC-18-0001355 that was 
dismissed. "Salient facts, such as mental illness or language 
barriers, require that a court effectively engage the defendant 
in a dialogue that will effectuate the rationale behind the 
colloquy and the on-the-record waiver requirements." State v.
Chong Hung Han, 130 Hawaiʻ i 83, 92, 306 P.3d 128, 137 (2013) 
(internal quotation marks omitted) (discussing salient facts in 
the context of waiving the right to testify or not to testify). 
The circuit court began its colloquy by asking if 
Midel took any medication, was under a doctor's care, or 
consumed alcohol that morning. Midel answered no to all three questions. 
The circuit court then asked Midel if his mind was 
clear that morning. 
Midel answered yes. The circuit court 
continued by asking questions to determine whether Midel understood his right to a jury trial. Midel's responses show he 
understood. The circuit court's questions were pertinent to 
ascertaining whether Midel's waiver was knowing, voluntary, and 
intelligent. 
Nothing in the dialogue indicates that Midel's 
responses were inappropriate or incoherent. Nothing in the dialogue raises concerns regarding Midel's mental health. 
And although Midel claims the pretrial bail report in 
Case No. 1CPC-18-0001355 should have alerted the circuit court 
10
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 to the possibility of mental health concerns, Midel does not 
explain how an eighteen-month-old pretrial bail report would 
have indicated he was suffering from mental health issues at the 
time he waived his right to a jury trial in this case. 
Also, Midel appeared with counsel, who indicated she 
advised him against giving up his right to a jury trial. 
In 
light of counsel's contrary advice, the circuit court decided to ask Midel more questions to ascertain whether Midel understood 
his right to a jury trial and his waiver of that right. Nothing from that conversation indicated that mental health was a 
salient fact during that waiver. 
(c) Midel also argues the circuit court failed to 
conduct any meaningful dialogue as it required only yes or no 
responses and the dialogue was "more akin to an advisory or a 
lecture, as opposed to a thorough colloquy." 
A "true" colloquy "consists of a verbal exchange 
between the judge and the defendant in which the judge ascertains the defendant's understanding of the proceedings and 
of the defendant's rights." State v. Celestine
, 142 Hawaiʻi 165, 
170, 415 P.3d 907, 912 (2018) (internal quotation marks, 
emphasis, and citation omitted) (examining a true colloquy in 
the context of the rights to testify and not to testify). 
After almost each explanation, the circuit court asked 
Midel if he understood and allowed Midel to answer. 
Contrary to 
11   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 Midel's assertion, the transcript does not reflect the circuit 
court merely lectured Midel. 
And Midel does not proffer 
suggested questions that would have rendered the colloquy a "truer" colloquy. 
In sum, Midel fails to meet his burden of showing, by 
a preponderance of the evidence, that his waiver was involuntary 
or that his substantial rights were affected. Moreover, for the 
reasons discussed, the circuit court did not err by denying 
Midel's motion to set aside the waiver of his right to a jury trial. 
(2) Midel next challenges the waiver of his right to 
testify. As with his arguments regarding his waiver of his 
right to a jury trial, Midel argues "the circuit court merely 
read a lengthy advisement without engaging [him] in any 
meaningful dialogue or discussion after each segment was covered 
or pausing to ensure understanding [of] each aspect of the jury trial." Midel also argues his "history of mental health 
presented a 'salient fact' that should have prompted the circuit 
court to ask additional questions to verify that [he] truly 
understood the right that he was waiving." (Emphasis omitted.) 
"Hawaiʻi law has historically protected both the right 
to testify and the right not to testify." Id.
 at 169, 415 P.3d 
at 911. To protect these rights, the trial court must conduct an on-the-record colloquy. Id. at 169-70, 415 P.3d at 911-12. 
12
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  As stated above, a colloquy must be a true colloquy. Id. at 
170, 415 P.3d at 912. 
As to Midel's argument that the court did not engage 
in a meaningful dialogue or pause to ensure his understanding, 
the record shows that the court paused consistently to ascertain 
Midel's understanding. 
The court also invited Midel to ask 
questions and to take his time. Contrary to Midel's argument, the circuit court's colloquy was meaningful. 
As to Midel's argument that the circuit court failed 
to consider the "salient fact" of his "history of mental health," Midel does not point to anywhere in the proceedings 
prior to the waiver of his right to testify where the court should have been on notice that Midel's mental health was a 
salient fact during that waiver. See State v. Adler
, 108 Hawaiʻi 
169, 178, 118 P.3d 652, 661 (2005) (explaining appellants bear 
"the burden to show error by reference to matters in the record" and courts are "not obligated to sift through the voluminous 
record to verify an appellant's inadequately documented 
contentions" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). 
In sum, Midel failed to show that the circuit court's 
colloquy affected his substantial rights. 
(3) Finally, Midel challenges the denial of his 
Motion to Dismiss. 
Citing State v. Alkire, Midel argues that 
his "trial did not 'meaningfully' commence on June 29, 2020," 
13   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  because "the State had no intention of completing the trial on 
June 29, June 30, or soon thereafter." See 148 Hawaiʻ i 73, 87, 
468 P.3d 87, 101 (2020). 
In Alkire
, the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court explained that 
"HRPP Rule 48 requires a 'meaningful' commencement of trial." 
Id. at 87, 468 P.3d at 101. "[A] trial is 'meaningfully' commenced when a trial court has 'reasonably' committed its 
resources to the trial, which also requires that the parties be 
ready to proceed." Id.
The State moved to set a firm trial week and informed 
the circuit court that Dr. Happy was a necessary witness but now 
resided on the continent. Trial was ultimately postponed due to 
events related to COVID-19. 
Trial commenced on June 29, 2020. Except for 
Dr. Happy, the circuit court heard testimony from all of the State's witnesses over the first two days, including: 
(1) Honolulu Police Department (HPD) Officer Paul Acquavella, 
(2) HPD Sergeant Darryl Jones, (3) HPD Evidence Specialist 
Michael Lynch, (4) HPD Detective Jason Malacas, (5) HPD Evidence 
Specialist Hideko Yoshihara, (6) Jorge Santos, (7) Vincent 
Vanterpool, (8) HPD Officer Che-Wai Lau, (9) Dr. Matthew Koenig, 
(10) HPD Officer Steven Lee, (11) HPD Evidence Specialist Brittany Copp, (12) HPD Officer Christopher Chong, (13) HPD 
14
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   
 
 Evidence Specialist Garrick Baligad, (14) HPD Criminalist 
Michelle Amorin, and (15) Quintin Iriarte. 
And although Dr. Happy's ability (and willingness) to 
travel was hampered by COVID-19 restrictions, the State was 
otherwise ready to proceed, and the circuit court had reasonably 
committed its resources to trial. 
Under the particular circumstances of this case, we 
decline to vacate Midel's conviction under Alkire
. See id.
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's 
September 25, 2024 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence.
