APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CC141002171) 
ORDER 
(By: Nakasone, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Plaintiff-Appellee Deutsche Bank 
National Trust Company, a National Banking Association, as 
Trustee on Behalf of the HIS Asset Securitization Corporation Trust 2007-NC1's ( Deutsche Bank ) Motion to Dismiss Appeal, filed 
December 26, 2024, the papers in support, and the record, it appears that Deutsche Bank seeks dismissal of the appeal filed by self-represented Defendants-Appellants John Lyon Dudoit Jr. and Deborah Ann Dudoit ( Dudoits) from the Circuit Court of the First NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Circuit's minute order entered November 13, 2024 ( Minute Order ), 
and its "decision, if any, adopting" Deutsche Bank's proposed 
"Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Confirmation of Sale, Distribution of Proceeds, and for Writ of Ejectment Filed December 1, 2023" ( Confirmation Order ) for lack of jurisdiction. 
Deutsche Bank's motion has merit. The Minute Order is 
not appealable, nor will it be a final, appealable order or judgment after it is reduced to a formal, written order. Hawaii# 
Revised Statutes ยง 641-1(a) (2016); Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright , 76 Hawai #i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 
(1994); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright , 88 Hawai #i 
319, 321, 966 P.2d 631, 633 (1998). The Confirmation Order and 
its corresponding 
Hawai#i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 54(b) 
Judgment were entered on May 9, 2024. Though the May 9, 2024 Judgment is appealable, the Dudoits filed the November 20, 2024 Notice of Appeal more than thirty days after its entry, which is outside of the deadline set forth in Hawai #i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure ( HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1). The record does not indicate that 
the Dudoits received an extension of time to appeal under HRAP Rule 4(a)(4), or that the deadline was otherwise tolled by a timely-filed post-judgment motion under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). Compliance with the requirement of timely filing a notice of appeal is jurisdictional. Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai #i 10, 
13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is 
granted, and the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all other pending motions 
are dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai#i, January 9, 2025.
