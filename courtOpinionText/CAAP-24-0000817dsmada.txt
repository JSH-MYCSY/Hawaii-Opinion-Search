Defendant-Appellant Di Wu's appeal from the November 27, 2024
"Order Denying Defendant's Motion for Jury Trial, Filed
November 8, 2024 (DKT. 301)."  The circuit court has not entered
an appealable judgment, and the November 27, 2024 Order is not
independently appealable.  See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming &
Wright, 76 Hawai i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) (holding

for leave to file an interlocutory appeal, and stating that the
"refusal of the circuit court to allow an appeal from an
interlocutory judgment, order, or decree shall not be reviewable
by any other court").
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.  
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are
dismissed.
