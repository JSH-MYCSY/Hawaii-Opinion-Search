TREVOR STEPHENS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
AARON DEUTSCH and EMILY WESSEL, Defendants-Appellants
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
KONA DIVISION
(CASE NO. 3DRC-24-0000724)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
(By:  Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.)
On December 12, 2024, self-represented Defendants-
Appellants Aron Deutsch and Emily Wessel (together, Tenants )
filed a notice of appeal from an interlocutory district court
order deciding several motions.  We take judicial notice under
Rule 201 of the Hawaii Rules of Evidence that the district court
started trial on November 1, 2024, but trial has not been
completed.  Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 641-1(a) (2016) permits
appeals in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of the district courts.  The orders from which Tenants
appeal are not final, appealable orders.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  All pending motions are
dismissed.
