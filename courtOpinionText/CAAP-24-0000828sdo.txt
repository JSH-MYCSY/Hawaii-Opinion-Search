1 HRPP Rule 40(a)(2) & (c)(2) provide in pertinent part: 
(a) Proceedings and Grounds. The post-conviction 
proceeding established by this rule shall encompass all 
common law and statutory procedures for the same purpose,

(2) From Custody. Any person may seek relief under 
the procedure set forth in this rule from custody based upon 
a judgment of conviction, on the following grounds: 
(i) that the sentence was fully served;

     Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court) in 
1PC051001262 (the 2005 Case).2 
Doo raises a single point of error on appeal, 
contending that the Circuit Court erred "when it treated Doo's 
Motion to Correct Sentence and Restore the Maximum Term of 
Imprisonment as a nonconforming HRPP Rule 40 petition for post-
conviction relief, removed the file from [the 2005 Case], and 
filed it in the next numbered CPN case." 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Doo's 
point of error as follows: 
In the 2005 Case, Doo was charged with and pleaded 
guilty to four drug-related charges. On August 7, 2006, the 
Circuit Court sentenced Doo to concurrent terms of probation 
with, inter alia, a one-year prison term with credit for time 
served as a special condition of probation in three of the 
counts. No appeal was filed. 
On February 17, 2009, while still on probation in the 
2005 Case, Doo was charged with, and two months later pleaded 
    1(...continued) 
. . . . 
(c) Form and Content of Petition. 
    . . . .
(2) Nonconforming Petition. Where a post-conviction 
petition deviates from the form annexed to these rules, it 
shall nevertheless be accepted for filing and shall be 
treated as a petition under this rule provided that the 
petition (i) claims illegality of a judgment or illegality 
of "custody" or "restraint" arising out of a judgment[.]

     guilty to, three  new drug-related charges (the 2009 Case). Doo 
was ultimately sentenced to concurrent prison terms in the 2009 
Case. No appeal was filed. 
On May 27, 2009, the State of Hawai i (the State) 
filed,
 inter alia, a Motion for Revocation of Probation and 
Resentencing in the 2005 Case, which was granted. On November 7, 
2011, in the 2005 Case, the Circuit Court resentenced Doo to 
concurrent twenty-year and five-year terms, with his maximum term 
expiring January 20, 2032. No appeal was taken from the 
resentencing. 
On March 18, 2021, Hawai i Paroling Authority  (HPA) 
released Doo on parole "effective only to immediate admission 
into a clean and sober house." Standard terms and conditions of 
parole required Doo to, inter alia, "keep the parole 
officer/parole supervisor informed as to your whereabouts." 
Special terms and conditions required Doo to, inter alia, "remain 
in clean and sober house/structured living program for a period 
of six months of your release from prison." HPA's Order of 
Parole stated, inter alia, that failure to abide by the terms and 
conditions would result in suspension of parole. Doo signed and 
accepted HPA's terms and conditions. 
On March 25, 2021, HPA issued a Warrant of Arrest for 
Doo, alleging that Doo: (1) was in possession of methamphetamine 
on March 19, 2021; (2) failed to remain in clean and sober 
housing for the required six months; and (3) failed to inform his 
parole officer of his whereabouts.

          Doo  was  arrested  on  June  25,  2024.   HPA  held  a 
revocation  hearing  on  August  7,  2024,  at  which  Doo  "pleaded 
guilty"  to  the  violations.   HPA  ordered  Doo's  parole  "revoked  for 
the  balance  of  maximum  sentence"  and  ruled  that  due  to  parole 
suspension  from  March  25,  2021,  to  June  25,  2024,  Doo's  new 
maximum  sentence  would  expire  on  April  22,  2035. 
On
 September 18, 2024, in the 2005 Case, Doo filed a 
Motion to Correct Sentence and Restore the Maximum Term of 
Imprisonment (Motion to Correct ), pursuant to, inter alia, HRPP 
Rule 35. 
On
 December 9, 2024, in the 2005 Case, the Circuit 
Court entered the Order to Transfer, concluding in relevant part: 
Defendant's  Petition  filed  almost  thirteen  years  after 
Defendant's  sentence  was  final,  does  not  seek  relief  from 
the  judgment  of  conviction  issued  by  the  Circuit  Court  of 
the  First  Circuit  nor  does  it  challenge  Defendant's  sentence 
to  the  indeterminate  twenty-year  term  of  imprisonment 
sentence  issued  by  the  court.   Instead,  Defendant  seeks 
relief,  as  outlined  in  Rule  40(a)  of  the  [HRPP],  from 
Defendant's  "custody  based  upon  a  judgment  of  conviction"  on 
the  ground  that  his  "custody,  though  not  the  judgment,  [is] 
illegal."   Haw.  R.  Penal  P.  40(a),  (a)(2),  and  (a)(2)(iii), 
Neal  v.  Shimoda,  131  F.3d  818,  824  (9th  Cir.  1997)  ("habeas 
corpus  is  the  exclusive  remedy  for  a  state  prisoner  who 
challenges  the  fact  or  duration  of  his  confinement  and  seeks 
immediate  or  speedier  release").   As  such,  this  court  deems 
Defendant's  Petition  to  be  a  Nonconforming  Petition  for 
Post-Conviction  Relief  pursuant  to  HRPP  Rule  40(c)(2). 
The Circuit Court ordered that the Motion to Correct be 
removed from the 2005 Case and refiled under the next CPN case 
number. On December 12, 2024, Doo timely filed a notice of 
appeal from the Order to Transfer. 
As a preliminary matter, we address the State's 
argument that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction to review 
the Order to Transfer, which was entered in the 2005 Case, 
4
          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
    
     
         
            
          
   
        
          
        
         
          
                      
           
           
 because  it  does  not  end  Doo's  post-conviction  proceedings.   This 
argument  is  without  merit.   The  Order  to  Transfer  effectively 
denied  Doo's  request  for  relief  pursuant  to  HRPP  Rule  35  and 
terminated  the  proceedings  in  the  2005  Case.   We  conclude  that  we 
have  appellate  jurisdiction  to  consider  whether  the  Circuit  Court 
properly  denied  relief  under  HRPP  Rule  35.   See,  e.g.,  State  v. 
Kahapea,  111  Hawai i  267,  269,  141   P.3d  440,  442  (2006) 
(affirming  circuit  court's  denial  of  HRPP  Rule  35  motion);  State 
v.  Guillermo,  91  Hawai i  307,  308,  983  P.2d  819,  820  (1999) 
(vacating  circuit  court's  denial  of  HRPP  Rule  35  motion);  State 
v.  Williams,  70  Haw  566,  567,  777  P.2d  1192,  1193  (1989) 
(vacating  circuit  court's  grant  of  HRPP  Rule  35  motion,  remanding 
for  imposition  of  original  sentence).   
The sole issue properly
 before us in this appeal is 
whether the Circuit Court erred in construing Doo's Motion to 
Correct as an HRPP Rule 40 petition. Doo contends that he is 
entitled to relief pursuant to HRPP Rule 35(a), which provides in 
relevant part: 
(a) Correction of Illegal Sentence. The court may 
correct an illegal sentence at any time and may correct a 
sentence imposed in an illegal manner within the time 
provided herein for the reduction of sentence. A motion 
made by a defendant to correct an illegal sentence more than 
90 days after the sentence is imposed shall be made pursuant 
to Rule 40 of these rules. A motion to correct a sentence 
that is made within the 90 day time period shall empower the 
court to act on such motion even though the time period has 
expired. 
(Emphasis added.) 
It  is  undisputed  that  Doo  did  not  appeal  from  the 
original  judgment  and  sentence  in  the  2005  Case,  which  became 
final  and  appealable  in  2006,  or  when  he  was  resentenced  by  the

      Circuit Court (in the 2005 Case) in 2011. Citing Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 706-670(6), Doo argues in essence that HPA 
resentenced him again in the Order of Parole. This argument is 
without merit. 
HRS § 706-670(6) must be read in context of the entire 
statutory provision, including HRS § 706-607(8). See, e.g., 
Williamson v. Haw. Paroling Auth., 97 Hawai i 183, 193, 35  P.3d 
210, 220 (2001). HRS § 706-670 provides, in part: 
§ 706-670 Parole procedure; release on parole; terms 
of parole, recommitment, and reparole; final unconditional 
release. 
   . . . . 
(6)
 Sentence of imprisonment includes separate parole 
term. A sentence to an indeterminate term of imprisonment 
under this chapter includes as a separate portion of the 
sentence a term of parole or of recommitment for violation 
of the conditions of parole. 
   . . . . 
(8)
 Length of recommitment and reparole after 
revocation of parole. If a parolee's parole is revoked, the 
term of further imprisonment upon such recommitment and of 
any subsequent reparole or recommitment under the same 
sentence shall be fixed by the authority but shall not 
exceed in aggregate length the unserved balance of the 
maximum term of imprisonment. 
Reading these parts together, it is clear that upon 
revocation of parole and recommitment of a parolee, HPA is 
required to "fix" – i.e., determine – the term of further 
imprisonment. This is not a new sentence – HPA is merely setting 
the remaining term of the same sentence, which "shall not exceed 
in aggregate length the unserved balance of the maximum term of 
imprisonment." Id. 
Therefore, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not 
err in concluding that Doo was not entitled to relief pursuant to 
HRPP Rule 35, and instead, Doo was entitled to challenge HPA's 
actions in an HRPP Rule 40 proceeding.
