ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka   and  McCullen,   JJ.) 
Upon
 review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On December 25, 2024, self-represented Respondent-
Appellant Keith Kardash (Kardash ) filed a notice of appeal; 
(2) On January 2, 2025, the district court denied 
Kardash's request to waive the appellate filing fees; 
(3) On March 6, 2025, this court denied Kardash's 
January 5, 2025 motion to waive appellate filing fees filed in 
this court; 
(4) The record on appeal was due on or before 
February 28, 2025, see Hawai i Rules  of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 11(b)(1), but was not filed because Kardash failed to 
pay the filing fees or obtain a fee waiver; 
(5) On March 14, 2025, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Kardash that the time 
to docket the appeal had expired, Kardash had not paid the filing 
fees or obtained an order allowing Kardash to proceed on appeal 
in forma pauperis , the matter would be brought to the court's 
attention on March 24, 2025, for action that may include

dismissal of the appeal, and Kardash could seek relief from 
default by motion; and 
(6) Kardash has not taken any further action in this 
appeal. An appeal may be dismissed where the record on appeal 
has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the 
required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to 
proceed in forma pauperis . HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
