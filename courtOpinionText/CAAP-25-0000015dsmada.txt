APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT   COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL  NO.  3CC181000222) 
ORDER 
(By:   Leonard,   Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka   and  McCullen,   JJ.) 
Upon
 consideration of Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-
Appellee Hawaiian Ranchos Road Maintenance Corporation's 
(Hawaiian Ranchos ) April 2, 2025 Motion to Dismiss Appeal for 
Lack of Appellate Jurisdiction, the papers in support and in 
opposition, and the record, it appears that: 
(1) Self-represented Defendant/Counterclaimant-
Appellant Nancy Bondurant (Bondurant ) appeals from the following 
orders entered by the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit on 
October 15, 2024: (a) the Order Denying Defendant Nancy 
Bondurant's Motion to Stay Proceedings (Stay Order), (b) the 
Order Granting Plaintiff Hawaiian Ranchos Road Maintenance          
      
          
      
        
         
  
        
        
         
          
         
         
         
          
          
        
        
        
        
   
        
           
         
            
          
 
            
          
        NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Corporation's Motion for Sanctions Against Nancy Bondurant 
Pursuant to HRCP Rule 11 (Sanctions Order), and (c) the Order 
Denying Defendant Nancy Bondurant's Motion to Discharge 
Improperly Issued Second Amended [Proposed] Writ of Execution as 
to Defendant Nancy Bondurant, dkt. #609 and Signed Order, dkt. 
#611 (Writ Order); 
(2) Hawaiian Ranchos seeks dismissal of the appeal for 
lack of jurisdiction because, among other things, the Sanctions 
Order is not appealable under the collateral order doctrine,1 and 
the appeals from the Stay Order and Writ Order are moot;2 
(3) A Final Judgment was entered in the underlying case 
on September 6, 2022, and a post-judgment order is appealable 
under Hawai i Revised Statutes § 641–1(a) (2016) if it  disposes 
of all issues raised in a post-judgment motion, Ditto v. McCurdy , 
103 Hawai i 153, 158, 80 P.3d 974, 979 (2003);  accordingly, we 
conclude we have appellate jurisdiction over the Sanctions Order; 
(4) Bondurant has already obtained a stay of the 
underlying proceedings pending the appeal in related case CAAP-
24-0000408;3 accordingly, we conclude the appeal from the Stay 
Order is moot; and 
(5) Hawaiian Ranchos fails to cite authority for its 
argument that the appeal from the Writ Order is moot because the 
Circuit Court subsequently entered a new writ of execution that 
1 See Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai i 249, 254, 3 69 P.3d 832, 837 (2016) 
(setting out the requirements for an appeal under the collateral order 
doctrine). 
2 See Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem, 119 Hawai i 1, 5, 193  P.3d 
839, 843 (2008) (setting forth the elements of the mootness doctrine). 
3 See Order Granting Motion for Stay, CAAP-24-0000408 docket no. 
212.

purportedly supersedes the writ Bondurant challenged; 
accordingly, we will deny the request to dismiss the appeal from 
the Writ Order without prejudice to Hawaiian Ranchos raising the 
issue in its answering brief. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is 
granted in part and denied in part as follows: 
1. The appeal is dismissed in part, but only to the 
extent Bondurant seeks relief from the October 15, 2024 Order 
Denying Defendant Nancy Bondurant's Motion to Stay Proceedings. 
2. All other relief requested is denied without 
prejudice.
