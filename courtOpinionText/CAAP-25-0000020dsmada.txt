APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CC181000160) 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Third-Party Defendant/Third-Party 
Counterclaimant/Crossclaimant-Appellee First Insurance Company of 
Hawaii, Ltd.'s (First Insurance) March 13, 2025 Motion to Dismiss 
Appeal for Lack of Jurisdiction, the papers in support and in NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
opposition, and the record, it appears that First Insurance seeks 
dismissal of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the December 13, 2024 "Judgment" (Purported Judgment) from which 
Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-Appellant 
Association of Apartment Owners of Valley Isle Resort appeals is not a final, appealable judgment. 
We conclude that the Purported Judgment is not a final, 
appealable order or judgment under Hawai# i Revised Statutes (HRS) 
ยง 641-1(a) (2016), Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure (
HRCP) 
Rules 58 and/or 54(b), and Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994), as it 
does not enter final judgment as to all claims and parties, nor does it "contain[] the language necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)," Jenkins, 76 Hawai# i at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. 
The Purported Judgment is not independently appealable under the collateral order doctrine or the Forgay
1 doctrine, and the 
Circuit Court has not granted leave for interlocutory appeal under HRS ยง 641-1(b). See Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai# i 249, 253, 
369 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (setting forth the requirements for appealability under the collateral order and Forgay doctrines); HRS ยง 641-1(b) (specifying requirements for leave to file interlocutory appeal). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is 
granted, and the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.
