IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
RAYLANI  F.  LUPTON,  Petitioner-Appellee,  v. 
KEITH  D.  KARDASH,  Respondent-Appellant 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
HONOLULU  DIVISION 
(CIVIL  NO.  1DSS-23-0000865) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka   and  McCullen,   JJ.) 
Upon
 review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On January 9, 2025, self-represented Respondent-
Appellant Keith Kardash (Kardash ) filed a notice of appeal; 
(2) On March 6, 2025, this court denied Kardash's 
February 23, 2025 motion to waive appellate filing fees; 
(3) The record on appeal was due on or before March 10, 
2025, see Hawai i Rules  of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 11(b)(1), but was not filed because Kardash failed to pay 
the filing fees or obtain a fee waiver; 
(4) On March 14, 2025, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Kardash that the time 
to docket the appeal had expired, Kardash had not paid the filing 
fees or obtained an order allowing Kardash to proceed on appeal 
in forma pauperis , the matter would be brought to the court's 
attention on March 24, 2025, for action that may include 
dismissal of the appeal, and Kardash could seek relief from 
default by motion; and

(5) Kardash has not taken any further action in this 
appeal. An appeal may be dismissed where the record on appeal 
has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the 
required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to 
proceed in forma pauperis . HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
