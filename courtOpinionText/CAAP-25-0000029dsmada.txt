IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
TREVOR  STEPHENS,  Plaintiff-Appellee,  v. 
ARON  DEUTSCH  and  EMILY  WESSEL,  Defendants-Appellants 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT 
KONA  DIVISION 
(CASE  NO.  3DRC-24-0000724) 
ORDER  DISMISSING   APPEAL  FOR  LACK  OF  JURISDICTION 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka   and  Guidry,   JJ.) 
On  January   15,  2025,  self-represented   Defendants-
Appellants   Aron  Deutsch   and  Emily  Wessel  (together,   Tenants ) 
filed  a  notice  of  appeal  from  a  January   15,  2025  interlocutory 
district   court  order  striking   a  document   they  filed.   We  take 
judicial   notice  under  Rule  201  of  the  Hawai i  Rules  of  Evidence 
that  the  District  Court  of  the  Third  Circuit,  Kona  Division, 
started  trial  on  November  1,  2024,  and  on  December  24,  2024, 
ordered  the  parties  to  submit  proposed  findings  by  January  21, 
2025. 
Hawaii
 Revised Statutes ยง 641-1(a)(2016) permits 
appeals in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or 
decrees of the district courts. The January 15, 2025 order which 
Tenants appeal from is not a final appealable order.          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Therefore,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  this  appeal  is 
dismissed  for  lack  of  jurisdiction.   All  pending  motions, 
including  Tenants'  January  16,  2025  Motion  for  Stay  Pending 
Appeal,  are  dismissed.
