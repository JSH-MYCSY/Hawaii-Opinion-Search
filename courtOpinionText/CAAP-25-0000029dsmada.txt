NO.  CAAP-25-0000029 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
TREVOR  STEPHENS,  Plaintiff-Appellee,  v. 
ARON  DEUTSCH  and  EMILY  WESSEL,  Defendants-Appellants 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT 
KONA  DIVISION 
(CASE  NO.  3DRC-24-0000724) 
ORDER  DENYING  MOTION  FOR  RECONSIDERATION 
(By:   Leonard,   Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka   and  Guidry,   JJ.) 
On  March  28,  2025,  self-represented   Defendants-
Appellants   Aron  Deutsch   and  Emily  Wessel  (together,   Tenants ) 
filed  a  Motion  to  Reconsider   and  Reinstate   (Motion).   The  Motion 
requests   reconsideration   of  our  February   5,  2025  Order  Dismissing 
Appeal  for  Lack  of  Jurisdiction.   Alternatively,  Tenants  request   
leave  to  file  another  appeal  to  seek  review  of  a  January  15,  2025 
interlocutory  order  of  the  District  Court  of  the  Third  Circuit, 
Kona  Division. 
Hawai i Rules  of Appellate Procedure Rule 40(a) 
provides that a motion for reconsideration may be filed by a 
party only within ten days after the filing of the order. To the 
extent that Tenants seek reconsideration of our February 5, 2025 
order, the Motion is untimely.

Tenants also seek leave to file another appeal to 
obtain appellate review of the district court's January 15, 2025 
interlocutory order. That request is not properly before this 
court and must be denied. We take judicial notice, however, 
under Rule 201 of the Hawai i  Rules of  Evidence, that on 
March 25, 2025, Tenants appealed from the district court's 
March 25, 2025 writ of possession and judgment for possession, 
and that appeal is pending with this court in CAAP-25-0000246. 
Tenants may seek appellate review of interlocutory orders, 
including the January 15, 2025 interlocutory order, in 
CAAP-25-0000246. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is 
denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai i, April 4,  2025.
