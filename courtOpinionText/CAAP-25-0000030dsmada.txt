NO.  CAAP-25-0000030 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
STATE  OF  HAWAI I,  Plaintiff-Appellee,  v. 
TONY  RAY  PETTY,  Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
(CR.  NO.  1CPC-18-0001948) 
ORDER  GRANTING  MOTION  TO  DISMISS  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka  and  McCullen,  JJ.) 
Upon
 consideration of Plaintiff-Appellee State of 
Hawaii's (State) May 2, 2025 Motion to Dismiss Appeal and, 
Assuming Arguendo this Motion to Dismiss Appeal Is Denied, to 
Extend the Time to File the State's Answering Brief Until 40 Days 
After this Motion is Disposed of (Motion), the papers in support, 
and the record, it appears that: 
(1) Self-represented Defendant-Appellant Tony Ray Petty 
(Petty) appeals from the Circuit Court of the First Circuit's 
April 11, 2019 Judgment of Conviction (Judgment ), entered in 
1CPC-18-0001948; 
(2) The State seeks, inter alia, dismissal of the 
appeal for lack of jurisdiction; and 
(3) Dismissal
 is warranted, as Petty's Notice of 
Appeal, received January 13, 2025, was not timely-filed within 
thirty days after entry of the Judgment, as required by Hawai i 
Rules
 of Appellate Procedure Rule 4(b)(1), and "compliance with 
the requirement of the timely filing of a notice of appeal is

jurisdictional."1 State v. Brandimart , 68 Haw. 495, 496, 720 P. 
2d. 1009, 1010 (1986). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is 
granted, and the appeal is dismissed without prejudice to Petty 
seeking alternative relief from the Circuit Court in a petition 
under Hawai i Rules of Penal  Procedure Rule 40. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai i, May 12, 2025.

1 Though Hawai i cour ts have seen fit in criminal cases to relax the 
deadline for filing a notice of appeal where justice so warrants, including 
where defense counsel has inexcusably or ineffectively failed to perfect an 
appeal on his or her client's behalf despite being asked to do so, State v. 
Cardenas ,
 150 Hawai i 307, 317, 500 P.3d 492, 502 (App. 2021), those 
circumstances do not apply here.
