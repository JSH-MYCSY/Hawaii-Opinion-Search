APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 1CC131002313) NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL 
(By: Nakasone, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Defendant/Crossclaim Defendant-
Appellant Launani Assets LLC's (Launani) July 14, 2025 Motion for 
Dismissal and Fourth Extension of Time to File Opening Brief, the papers in support, and the record, it appears that Launani seeks to dismiss this appeal or, alternatively, an extension of time to file the opening brief. Because the court will grant the request to dismiss the appeal, we need not address the request for an extension of time. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is 
granted and the appeal is dismissed, under Hawai#i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 42(b). The parties shall bear their own fees and costs. 
DATED: 
Honolulu, Hawai#i, July 24, 2025.
