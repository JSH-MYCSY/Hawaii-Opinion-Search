v. 
CHRISTOPHER M. KELIIHELEUA, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CPC-21-0000789) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, Wadsworth and Guidry, JJ.) 
Christopher M. Keliiheleua  appeals from the Findings of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, Order Granting in Part and Denying in 
Part Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Counts I and IV for Lack of Probable Cause  entered by the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit.
1 We affirm. 
A grand jury returned a six-count indictment against 
Keliiheleua. Keliiheleua moved to dismiss Counts I (Sexual Assault in the First Degree) and IV (Sexual Assault in the Third Degree). The Circuit Court entered findings of fact ( FOF), 
conclusions of law ( COL), and an order dismissing Count IV, but 
1 The Honorable James S. Kawashima presided. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
denying the motion as to Count I. Keliiheleua's timely motion 
for leave to file this interlocutory appeal was granted. 
We review an order denying a motion to dismiss an 
indictment for lack of probable cause de novo under the 
right/wrong  standard. State v. Park, 149 Hawai #i
 542, 546, 495 
P.3d 392, 396 (App. 2021) (citing State v. Taylor, 126 Hawai #i 
205, 215, 269 P.3d 740, 750 (2011)). 
A grand jury indictment must be based on probable
cause. Probable cause is established by a state of facts as
would lead a person of ordinary caution or prudence tobelieve and conscientiously entertain a strong suspicion of
the guilt of the accused . The evidence to support an
indictment need not be sufficient to support a conviction.In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to establishprobable cause before the grand jury, every legitimateinference that may be drawn from the evidence must be drawnin favor of the indictment and neither the trial court nor 
the appellate court on review may substitute its judgment as
to the weight of the evidence for that of the Grand Jury . 
Id. (emphasis added) (cleaned up). 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 707-730 (2014) 
provides, in relevant part: 
(1) A person commits the offense of sexual assault in the
first degree if: 
. . . . 
(d) The person knowingly subjects to sexual
penetration another person who is mentallydefective,[.2] 
"Sexual penetration" means "any intrusion of any part 
of a person's body or of any object into the genital or anal 
opening of another person's body; it occurs upon any penetration, however slight, but emission is not required." HRS § 707-700 
2 "Mentally defective" means "a person suffering from a disease,
disorder, or defect which renders the person incapable of appraising the
nature of the person's conduct." HRS § 707-700 (2014). The complainingwitness's caregiver testified that the complaining witness was twenty-twoyears old, had been diagnosed with "moderate intellectual disability," andfunctioned at the age of a ten-year old.

(2014). "[G]enital opening" includes "the anterior surface of 
the vulva or labia majora[.]" Id. 
(1) Keliiheleua challenges the following FOFs: 
7. The Complainant [( CW)] testified that [Keliiheleua]: 
a. Touched her vagina. 
i. When asked, [CW] went on to explain that
her vagina was sore after this touching. 
b. Put his mouth on her vagina. 
c. Sucked on her nipple. 
d. Touched her breast. 
e. Touched her butt. 
. . . . 
11. [CW] in this case testified that [Keliiheleua] touched
her vagina and that after the touching her vagina wassore. 
(Citations to record omitted.)3 
We review FOFs under the clearly erroneous  standard. 
Park, 149 Hawai #i at 546, 495 P.3d at 396. A finding of fact is 
not clearly erroneous if the record contains substantial evidence 
supporting it. Id. Substantial evidence is credible evidence of 
sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion. Id. 
CW testified to the grand jury that Keliiheleua "sucked 
on my nipple, touched my butt, and he kissed me on the lips." 
The State asked CW, "Did he put his, um, mouth anywhere 
else on your body besides your butt? I'm sorry, your breast?" 
3 Keliiheleua also challenges FOF no. 10, that "Grand Jury Counsel
was available to the grand jury on the date of the proceeding." We do not 
address it because he doesn't explain why he believes it is material to hisappeal. 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 CW answered, "On my vagina."4 
The State asked CW which part of her body Keliiheleua 
touched. 
CW answered, "My breast, my vagina, and my butt." 
The State asked, "Was it sore down there?" "It was." "Sore at your vagina?" "Yeah." FOF nos. 7 and 11 accurately describe CW's grand jury 
testimony. They are not clearly erroneous.
(2) Keliiheleua challenges the following COLs: 
6. "[I]t is not necessary to establish guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt, by clear and convincing evidence oreven by a preponderance of the evidence. It is not necessary to establish guilt at all. It is merelynecessary to establish a situation where a strongsuspicion of guilt would be believed and consciouslyentertained by a man of ordinary caution or prudence."State v. Freedle , 1 Haw. App. 396, 400, 620 P.2d 740,
743 (1980). 
. . . . 
8. Given that every legitimate inference that may be
drawn from the evidence must be drawn in favor of the 
indictment, this court should not disturb the grandjury's finding given the sufficiency of the evidencepresented by the Complainant in this case. See
: State 
v. Kuba, 68 Haw. 184, 190, 706 P.2d 1305 (1985)(citing State v. Freedle, 1 Haw. App. at 399, 620 P.2d
at 743 ( construing  People v. Shirley, 78 Cal. App. 3d
424, 144 Cal. Rptr. 282 (1978)[))]. 
We review COLs de novo under the right/wrong  standard. 
Park, 149 Hawai #i at 546, 495 P.3d at 396. 
COL no. 6 was right. In Freedle, the trial court 
dismissed an indictment for manslaughter. 1 Haw. App. at 396, 
4 "Sexual penetration" also includes "[c]unnilingus . . . , whether
or not actual penetration has occurred." HRS § 707-700. Count I of the indictment was based solely on Keliiheleua allegedly "inserting his fingerinto [CW's] genital opening," and did not allege cunnilingus as the conductelement of the offense.

620 P.2d at 741. The State appealed. This court reversed. 
After the passage quoted in COL no. 6, we discussed the evidence presented to the grand jury and concluded the grand jurors could have 
believed and conscientiously entertained a strong suspicion
that the [defendant], in drawing his firearm under thesecircumstances, consciously disregarded a substantial andunjustifiable risk that his conduct would cause the gun todischarge and thus, cause the death of the decedent.Whether that suspicion can be turned into proof is a matterfor trial. 
Id. at 401, 620 P.2d at 743. 
COL no. 8 was also right. In Kuba, the supreme court 
stated, "sufficient legal and competent evidence before a grand 
jury which establishes probable cause that a suspect has violated the law will support an indictment[,]" and "[p]robable cause has been established when it can be said that a reasonable and prudent person viewing the evidence would have a strong suspicion that a crime had been committed." 68 Haw. at 190, 706 P.2d at 1310 (citations omitted). The court continued: 
Furthermore, "every legitimate inference that may be drawn
from the evidence must be drawn in favor of the indictment and neither the trial court nor the appellate court onreview may substitute its judgment as to the weight of theevidence for the Grand Jury ." Freedle, 1 Haw. App. at 399,
620 P.2d at 743 (emphasis added) (construing People v.
Shirley, 78 Cal.App.3d 424, 144 Cal.Rptr. 282 (1978)). 
Id. at 190, 706 P.2d at 1310–11. 
(3) Keliiheleua challenges the following COLs, which 
contain mixed findings and conclusions: 
11. Based on the testimony by [CW], a fair inference canbe drawn that there is probable cause to believe thatsexual penetration as charged in Count I occurred. 
12. Based on the testimony of [CW], a fair inference canbe drawn that there is probable cause to believe that[Keliiheleua]'s finger was inserted in [CW]'s genitalopening as the definition of penetration, which was 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
included in the indictment presented to the grand
jury, defines it as any intrusion however slight. 
"[A] conclusion of law that presents mixed questions of 
fact and law is reviewed under the 'clearly erroneous' standard 
because the conclusion is dependent upon the facts and circumstances of the case." Park, 149 Hawai #i at 546, 495 P.3d 
at 396. 
COL nos. 11 and 12 were supported by substantial 
evidence. The cases cited by Keliiheleua are distinguishable because they involved the State presenting no evidence of an 
element of the charged offense, see Park , 149 Hawai #i at 551, 495 
P.3d at 401 (no evidence to show defendant had some part in directing affairs of alleged criminal enterprise); State v. Russo, 141 Hawai #i 181, 195-96, 407 P.3d 137, 151-52 (2017) (no 
evidence to show defendant willfully failed or refused to comply with lawful order of law enforcement officer); State v. Atwood , 
129 Hawai# i 414, 420, 301 P.3d 1255, 1261 (2013) (no evidence to 
show defendant intended to not perform contract); State v. Ontai , 
84 Hawai# i 56, 64, 929 P.2d 69, 77 (1996) (no evidence to show 
continuity of alleged enterprise), or involved the probable cause to arrest standard, which is not at issue here, see State v. Maganis, 109 Hawai#i
 84, 86, 123 P.3d 679, 681 (2005) (probable 
cause to arrest "requires more than a mere suspicion but less than a certainty"). 
Here, the evidence presented to the grand jury would 
lead a person of ordinary caution or prudence to believe and conscientiously entertain "a strong suspicion" that Keliiheleua inserted his finger into CW's genital opening. See Kuba, 68 Haw. 
at 190, 706 P.2d at 1310. 
COL nos. 11 and 12 were not clearly 
erroneous.
