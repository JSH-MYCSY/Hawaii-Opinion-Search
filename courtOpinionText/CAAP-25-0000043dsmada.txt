NO.  CAAP-25-0000043 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I  
DAMON  VAN  DEUSEN  and  CORRINA  VAN  DEUSEN, 
as  and/or  for  Co-Trustees  of  the  Dirk  Edward  Van  Deusen  Trust, 
Plaintiffs-Appellees,  v. 
CASSIE  LUND  and  LAEL  WILSON,  Defendants-Appellants 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT 
KONA  DIVISION 
(CASE  NO.  3DRC-24-0002236) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL  FOR  LACK  OF  JURISDICTION 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka  and  Guidry,  JJ.) 
On  January  23,  2025,  self-represented  Defendants-
Appellants  Cassie  Lund  and  Wilson  Lael  (together,  Tenants )  filed 
a  Notice  of  Appeal  from  the  "Order  Granting  Plaintiff's  Oral 
Motion  for  a  Rent  Trust  Fund." 
Tenants'  Notice   of  Appeal  does  not  comply  with  Hawai i 
Rules  of  Appellate   Procedure   Rule  3(c)(2)   because   it  does  not 
attach  a  copy  of  the  order  being  appealed   from. 
We  take  judicial  notice  under  Rule  201  of  the  Hawai i  
Rules  of  Evidence   that  on  November   29,  2024,  the  District   Court  
of  the  Third  Circuit,  Kona  Division  (district  court),  entered  an 
Order  Granting   Plaintiff's   Oral  Motion  for  a  Rent  Trust  Fund 
(Rent  Trust  Fund  Order).   The  Rent  Trust  Fund  Order  directs 
Tenants  to  deposit  the  sum  of  $3,500.00  with  the  Clerk  of  the 
Court  on  the  first  day  of  each  month  "until  this  case  is  disposed 
[of]  by  this  Court."

We also take judicial notice that the district court 
started trial on December 17, 2024, resumed trial on 
December 23, 2024, and ordered the parties to return for further 
trial on January 29, 2025 on Plaintiffs-Appellees Damon Van 
Duesen and Corrina Van Deusen, as and/or for Co-Trustees of the 
Dirk Edward Van Deusen Trust's October 11, 2024 Complaint for 
Summary Possession. 
Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 641-1(a)(2016) permits 
appeals in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or 
decrees of the district courts. The Rent Trust Fund Order which 
Tenants appeal from is not a final appealable order. 
Therefore,  IT   IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  this  appeal  is 
dismissed  for  lack  of  jurisdiction.   All  pending  motions, 
including  Tenants'  January  27,  2025  Motion  for  Stay  Pending 
Appeal,  are  dismissed. 
DATED:   Honolulu,   Hawai i,  January   31,  2025.
