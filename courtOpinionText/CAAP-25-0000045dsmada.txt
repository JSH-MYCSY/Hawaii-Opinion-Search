NO.  CAAP-25-0000045 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
IN  THE  INTEREST  OF  K.  CHILDREN 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  FAMILY  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
(FC-S  NO.  21-00160) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL  FOR  LACK  OF  JURISDICTION 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Wadsworth  and  McCullen,  JJ.) 
Upon review of
 the record in CAAP-25-0000045 and 
FC-S No. 21-00160,1 it appears that: 
(1) Father-Appellant (Father) appeals from the Family 
Court of the First Circuit's (family court) January 17, 2025 
"Orders Regarding Child Protective Act" (January 17, 2025 Order). 
Father challenges the family court's denial of his motion for 
reconsideration of the order denying oral motion for recusal of 
the Honorable Lesley N. Maloian. 
(2) In the underlying case, Petitioner-Appellee 
Department of Human Services (DHS) filed a petition for temporary 
foster custody, and on March 8, 2024, DHS filed a motion to 
terminate the parental rights of Father (TPR Motion). The record 
indicates that the family court has not ruled on the TPR Motion, 
which is set for hearing on April 7, 2025 before the Honorable 
Kyle T. Dowd, and Father did not seek leave to file an 
interlocutory appeal. 
1 The court takes judicial notice of the record in FC-S No. 
21-00160. Hawai i Rule s of Evidence Rule 201.

(3) "In general, appeals in family court cases, as in 
other civil cases, may be taken only from (1) a final judgment, 
order, or decree, . . . or (2) a certified interlocutory order." 
In re Doe, 96 Hawai i 272, 283, 30  P.3d 878, 889 (2001) (citing 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 571–54 and 641–1(a)-(b)); HRS 
§ 587A-36 (2018). 
(4) This appeal is premature insofar as the TPR Motion 
remains pending, the family court has not entered an appealable 
final order, and the January 17, 2025 Order is not independently 
appealable. See In re Doe, 107 Hawai i 12, 15, 108  P.3d 966, 969 
(2005) ("The final order or decree appealable under HRS § 571–54 
is the order or decree that determines the ultimate rights and 
liabilities of the parties."); Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai i 249, 
253, 369
 P.3d 832, 836 (2016) (reciting the requirements for 
appeals under the collateral-order doctrine and the Forgay 
doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (2016) (setting forth the requirements 
for leave to file an interlocutory appeal). 
(5) When the court "perceive[s] a jurisdictional defect 
in an appeal, [it] must, sua sponte, dismiss that appeal." Bacon 
v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986). 
Therefore,  IT   IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  the  appeal  is 
dismissed  for  lack  of  appellate  jurisdiction. 
IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  all  pending  motions  are 
dismissed.
