APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3PC930000141) 
ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that Defendant-
Appellant Francis Grandinetti , representing himself, filed a 
Notice of Appeal  from Judiciary Information Management System 
(JIMS) case no. 3PC930000141. Grandinetti identifies no final 
judgment or order from which he seeks to appeal. We take 
judicial notice of the record in JIMS no. 3PC930000141 under Rule 201, Hawaii Rules of Evidence, Chapter 626, Hawaii Revised Statutes. No appealable judgment or order was entered in JIMS no. 3PC930000141 during the thirty-days before Grandinetti filed the Notice of Appeal. See
 Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 4(b)(1) ("In a criminal case, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from."). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
