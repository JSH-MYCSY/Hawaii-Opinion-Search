APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT 
(CASE  NO.  3PC930000141) 
ORDER  DENYING  MOTION  FOR  RECONSIDERATION 
(By:  Leonard,  Presiding  Judge,  Hiraoka  and  Wadsworth,  JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the
 July 3, 2025 "Defendant on 
Motion for Partial Reconsideration of Judgment Within Ten Days of 
Decision, HRAP," filed by self-represented Defendant-Appellant 
Francis Grandinetti, the papers in support, and the record, it 
appears that Grandinetti seeks reconsideration of the June 25, 
2025 Order dismissing this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. 
Grandinetti presents no point of law or fact we overlooked or 
misapprehended. See Rule
 40(b), Hawai i Rules  of Appellate 
Procedure.          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
