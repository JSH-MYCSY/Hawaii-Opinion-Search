IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I  
ELDINE  PAULINE,   Petitioner-Appellant,  v. 
STATE  OF  HAWAI I,  Repsondent-Appellee  
APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
(CASE  NO.  1CPN-24-0000029) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL  FOR  LACK  OF  JURISDICTION 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka,  Wadsworth,  JJ.) 
Upon  review  of  the  record,  it  appears  that  Petitioner-
Appellant  Elden  Pauline  appeals  from  Respondent-Appellee  State  of 
Hawaii's  December  19,  2024  Answer  to  Petition  to  Vacate,  Set 
Aside  or  Correct  Judgment  or  to  Release  Petitioner  for  Custody 
(Rule  40,  HRPP),  filed  in  1CPN-24-0000029. 
Pursuant  to  Hawaii  Revised  Statutes  ยง  641-11  (2016)  and 
Hawai i  Rules  of  Penal  Procedure  Rule  (HRPP)  40(h),  "appeals  from 
proceedings  for  post-conviction  relief  may  be  made  from  a 
judgment  entered  in  the  proceeding  and  must  be  taken  in 
accordance  with  [HRAP]  Rule  4(b)."   Grattafiori  v.  State,  79 
Hawai i  10,  13,  897  P.2d  937,  940  (1995)  (cleaned  up).   Although 
HRPP  Rule  40(h)  refers  to  the  appealable  document  as  a 
"judgment,"  the  supreme  court  has  indicated  that  a  "written 
order"  denying  an  HRPP  Rule  40  petition  for  post-conviction

relief  is  appealable  pursuant  to  HRPP  Rule  40(h).   Id.  at  14,  897 
P.2d  at  941.   The  court  must  dismiss  an  appeal  on  its  motion  if 
it  lacks  jurisdiction.   Id.  at  13,  897  P.2d  at  940. 
The Circuit Court of the First Circuit has not entered 
an order disposing of Pauline's Petition for Post Conviction 
Relief. Accordingly, the appeal is premature, and the court 
lacks appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
