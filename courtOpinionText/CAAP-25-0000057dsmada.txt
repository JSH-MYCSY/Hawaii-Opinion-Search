and the opening brief was due June 4, 2025. 
(3) On
 June 10, 2025, the appellate clerk entered a 
"Default of Statement of Jurisdiction & Opening Brief," which 
informed Kristi that the time for filing the statement of

called to the court's attention on June 20, 2025 for appropriate 
action that may include dismissal of the appeal under Hawai i 
Rules

appeal, and did not request any extension of time or file the 
statement of jurisdiction and opening brief.
