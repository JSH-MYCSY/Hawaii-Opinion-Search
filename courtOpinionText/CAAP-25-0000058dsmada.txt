IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
PATRICIA  AMANN,  Plaintiff-Appellee,  v. 
SCOT  PAUL  STEWART  and  LISA  PERRONE,  Defendants-Appellants. 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT 
NORTH  AND  SOUTH  KONA  DIVISION 
(CASE  NO.  3DRC-25-0000151) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL 
(By:  Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka,  and  Wadsworth,  JJ.) 
Upon
 review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) Self-represented Defendants-Appellants Scot Paul 
Stewart (Stewart) and Lisa Perrone (collectively, Appellants) 
filed the notice of appeal on February 3, 2025. 
(2) The court's May 2, 2025 Order denied Stewart's 
February 12, 2025 Request for Relief from Court Filing Fees, and 
directed that within 15 days, Appellants "shall either (i) file 
in this court a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma 
pauperis that complies with HRAP Rule 24(a), or (ii) pay the 
filing fees in the full amount to the Supreme Court Clerk's 
Office." The May 2, 2025 Order stated: "Failure to file in this 
court a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis 
or pay the filing fees may result in the appeal being dismissed." 
(3) Appellants have not complied with the May 2, 2025 
order, the time for compliance has expired, and Appellants have 
not paid the appellate filing fee. As a result, the record on 
appeal has not been prepared. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is

dismissed. See Hawai i  Rules of  Appellate Procedure Rule 24(c) 
("Failure of the unsuccessful movant [to proceed on appeal in 
forma pauperis] to pay the unpaid filing fees or to give security 
for costs shall not affect the validity of the appeal, but is 
ground for such action as the appellate court having jurisdiction 
over the appeal deems appropriate, and may include dismissal of 
the appeal.").
