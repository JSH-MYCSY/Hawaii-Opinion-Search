DAMON  VAN  DEUSEN  and  CORRINA  VAN  DEUSEN,

Plaintiffs-Appellees,  v. 
CASSIE  LUND  and  LAEL  WILSON,  Defendants-Appellants 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT 
KONA  DIVISION 
(CASE  NO.  3DRC-24-0002236) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka  and  McCullen,  JJ.) 
Upon review
 of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On February 12, 2025, self-represented Defendants-
Appellants Cassie Lund and Lael Wilson (together, Appellants) 
filed the notice of appeal; 
(2) On
 March 11, 2025, the court denied Appellants' 
February 14, 2025 Motion for Leave to Proceed In Forma Pauperis, 
without prejudice to Appellants filing another such motion that 
includes information on income and assets, as required by Hawai i 
Rules
 of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 24(a); 
(3) Appellants did not file a subsequent motion for 
leave to proceed in forma pauperis; 
(4) The record on appeal was due on or before April 14, 
2025, see HRAP Rules 11(b)(1), 26(a), but was not filed because 
Appellants failed to pay the filing fees or obtain a fee waiver; 
(5) On April 30, 2025, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Appellants that the 
time to docket the appeal had expired, Appellants had not paid

the filing fees or obtained an order allowing Appellants to 
proceed on appeal in forma pauperis, the matter would be brought 
to the court's attention on May 12, 2025, for action that may 
include dismissal of the appeal, and Appellants could seek relief 
from default by motion; and 
(6) Appellants have not taken any further action in 
this appeal. An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay 
the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to 
proceed in forma pauperis. HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
