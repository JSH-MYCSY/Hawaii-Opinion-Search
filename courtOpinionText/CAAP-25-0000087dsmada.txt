ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka  and  McCullen,  JJ.) 
Upon review
 of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On February 10, 2025, self-represented Plaintiff-
Appellant Guillermo Canlas (Canlas) filed a notice of appeal; 
(2) The record on appeal was due on or before April 11, 
2025, see Hawai i Rules  of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 11(b)(1), but was not filed because Canlas failed to pay the 
filing fees or obtain a fee waiver; 
(3) On April 24, 2025, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Canlas that the time 
to docket the appeal had expired, Canlas had not paid the filing 
fees or obtained an order allowing Canlas to proceed on appeal in 
forma pauperis , the matter would be brought to the court's 
attention on May 5, 2025, for action that may include dismissal 
of the appeal, and Canlas could seek relief from default by 
motion; and

(4) Canlas has not taken any further action in this 
appeal. An appeal may be dismissed where the record on appeal 
has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the 
required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to 
proceed in forma pauperis . HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
