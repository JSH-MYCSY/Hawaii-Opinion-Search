RAYLANI  F.  LUPTON,  Petitioner-Appellee,  v. 
KEITH  D.  KARDASH,  Respondent-Appellant 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
HONOLULU  DIVISION 
(CIVIL  NO.  1DSS-23-0000865) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka  and  McCullen,  JJ.) 
Upon review
 of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On February 18, 2025, self-represented Respondent-
Appellant Keith Kardash (Kardash) filed the notice of appeal; 
(2) The record on appeal was due on or before April 21, 
2025, see Hawai i Rules  of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 11(b)(1), but was not filed because Kardash failed to pay 
the filing fees or obtain a fee waiver; 
(3) On April 23, 2025, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Kardash that the time 
to docket the appeal had expired, Kardash had not paid the filing 
fees or obtained an order allowing Kardash to proceed on appeal 
in forma pauperis, the matter would be brought to the court's 
attention on May 5, 2025, for action that may include dismissal 
of the appeal, and Kardash could seek relief from default by 
motion; and 
(4) Kardash has not taken any further action in this 
appeal. An appeal may be dismissed where the record on appeal 
has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the
