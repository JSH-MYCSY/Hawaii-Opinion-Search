OF THE STATE OF HAWAI #I 
STATE OF HAWAI #I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. 
FRANCIS GRANDINETTI, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
NORTH AND SOUTH HILO DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 3DCW-25-0000285) 
ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that Defendant-
Appellant Francis Grandinetti , representing himself, filed a 
Notice of Appeal from Judiciary Information Management System 
(JIMS) case no. 3DCW-25-0000285. Grandinetti identifies no final 
judgment or order from which he seeks to appeal. See
 Hawai#i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 3(c)(2) ("The notice of appeal 
shall designate the judgment, order, or part thereof and the court or agency appealed from[.]"). We take judicial notice of the record in JIMS no. 3DCW-25-0000285 under Rule 201, Hawaii Rules of Evidence, Chapter 626, Hawaii Revised Statutes and conclude that no appealable judgment or order was entered in JIMS no. 3DCW-25-0000285.

dismissed.
