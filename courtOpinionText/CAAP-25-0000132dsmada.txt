APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL  NO.  3CC19100153K) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka,  and  Wadsworth,  JJ.) 
Upon review
 of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On March 6, 2025, self-represented Defendant-
Appellant Alan Brooks Bram (Bram) filed a notice of appeal. 
(2) The record on appeal was due on or before 
May 5, 2025, see Hawai i Rules  of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 11(b)(1), but was not filed because Bram failed to pay the 
filing fees or obtain a fee waiver. 
(3) On May 8, 2025, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Bram that the time to 
docket the record on appeal had expired, Bram had not paid the 
filing fees, the record on appeal cannot be prepared and filed 
without full payment of all fees or an order allowing Bram to 
proceed on appeal in forma pauperis , the matter would be brought 
to the court's attention on May 19, 2025 for action that may

include dismissal of the appeal, and Bram could seek relief from 
default by motion. 
(4) Bram has not taken any further action in this 
appeal. An appeal may be dismissed where the record on appeal 
has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the 
required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to 
proceed in forma pauperis . HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
