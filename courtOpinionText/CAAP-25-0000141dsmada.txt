(CASE NO. 1CCV-24-0001353) 
ORDER 
(By: Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
1. Plaintiff-Appellant Thomas P. Flores, II filed his 
notice of appeal in the circuit court on March 9, 2025; 
2. Flores purports to appeal from the circuit court's 
February 27, 2025 Trial Setting Status Conference Order; and 
3. The Order is not an appealable order because it 
does not resolve all claims as to all parties and the circuit court did not certify it for appeal under 
Hawai#i Rules of Civil 
Procedure Rule 54(b), Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright , 
76 Hawai# i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994); it is not an 
appealable collateral order, see Greer v. Baker , 137
