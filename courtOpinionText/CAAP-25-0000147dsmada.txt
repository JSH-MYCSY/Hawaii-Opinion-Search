APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT 
(CASE  NO.  3CC16100281K) 
ORDER  GRANTING  MOTION  TO  DISMISS  APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka,  Wadsworth,  JJ.) 
Upon  consideration  of  Plaintiff/Counterclaim 
Defendant-Appellee  Palm  Avenue  Hialeah  Trust,  a  Delaware 
Statutory  Trust,  for  and  on  Behalf  and  Solely  with  Respect  to 
Palm  Avenue  Hialeah  Trust,  Series  2014-1's  (Palm  Avenue)  
May  13,  2025  Motion  for  Order  Dismissing  Appeal,  the  papers  in          
         
          
  
         
       NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
support, the record, and there being no opposition, it appears 
that Palm Avenue seeks dismissal of the appeal filed by 
self-represented Defendant/Counterclaimant-Appellant 
Albert M. Goldberg (Goldberg ) for lack of jurisdiction. 
Goldberg  appeals  from  the   Circuit  Court  of  the  Third 
Circuit's  January  29,  2025  "Order  Granting  [Palm  Avenue]'s  Motion 
to  Dismiss  Defendants/Counterclaimants  Elinor  K.  Goldberg  And 
Albert  M.  Goldberg's  Counterclaim,  Filed  January  6,  2017,  Filed 
Herein  on  July  7,  2022."   The  court  lacks  appellate  jurisdiction 
because  the  Circuit  Court  has  not  entered  a  final,  appealable 
order  or  judgment,  see  Hawaii  Revised  Statutes  (HRS)  ยง  641-1(a) 
(2016);  Hawaii  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  Rules  54(b),  58;  Jenkins 
v.  Cades  Schutte  Fleming  &  Wright,   76  Hawai i  115,  119,  869  P.2d 
1334,
  1338  (1994),  and  the  order  appealed-from  is  not 
independently  appealable  under  the  collateral  order  or  Forgay
doctrines,   nor  has  the  Circuit  Court  granted  leave  for  an 
interlocutory   appeal  under  HRS  ยง  641-1(b).    See  Greer  v.  Baker, 
137  1 
Hawai i  249,  253,  369  P.3d  832,  836  (2016)  (setting  forth  the 
requirements  for  appealability  under  the  collateral-order 
doctrine  and  the  Forgay  doctrine);  HRS  ยง  641-1(b)  (specifying 
requirements  for  leave  to  file  interlocutory  appeal).  
Therefore,  IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  the  motion  is 
granted,  and  the  appeal  is  dismissed  for  lack  of  jurisdiction. 
IT  IS  FURTHER   ORDERED  that  all  pending  motions  are 
dismissed.
