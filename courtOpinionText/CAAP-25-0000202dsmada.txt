IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
STATE  OF  HAWAI I,  Plaintiff-Appellee,  v. 
KONA
  WONG,  Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  OF  THE  FIFTH  CIRCUIT 
LĪHU E  DIVISION 
(CASE  NOS.  5DCW-25-0000013;  5DCW-25-0000014; 
5DCW-25-0000015;  and  5DCW-25-0000019) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL  FOR  LACK  OF  JURISDICTION 
(By:   Nakasone,  Chief  Judge,  Leonard  and  Wadsworth,  JJ.) 
Upon review of the
 record, it appears that 
self-represented Defendant-Appellant Kona Wong appeals from the 
"Order[s] Denying Defendant's Motion to Quash" (collectively, 
Denial Orders) entered March 19, 2025 by the District Court of 
the Fifth Circuit in case numbers 5DCW-25-0000013, 
5DCW-25-0000014, 5DCW-25-0000015, and 5DCW-25-0000019. The court 
lacks appellate jurisdiction because the Denial Orders are not 
final decisions or judgments, Hawaii Revised Statutes § 641-12 
(2016), there is "no statutory warrant for interlocutory appeals 
in criminal cases from district courts," State v. Valiani, 57 
Haw. 133, 135, 552 P.2d 75, 76 (1976), and the Denial Orders do 
not deny motions to dismiss raised on double jeopardy grounds, 
cf. State v. Baranco,
 77 Hawai i 351,  884 P.2d 729 (1994).

Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.
