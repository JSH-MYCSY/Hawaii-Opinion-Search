MARK  ZIEBOLD,  Plaintiff-Appellee,  vs.  
JAMES  BUI  AND  DIANA  BUI-NGUYEN,  Defendants-Appellants. 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT 
PUNA  DIVISION 
(CIVIL  NO.  3DRC-24-0000850) 
ORDER  DISMISSING   APPEAL 
(By:  Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka,   and  Wadsworth,   JJ.) 
Upon review
 of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On March 20, 2025, self-represented Defendants-
Appellants Diana Bui and James Bui (collectively, Appellants ) 
filed a notice of appeal. 
(2) The record on appeal was due on or before 
May 19, 2025, see Hawai i Rules  of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 11(b)(1), but was not filed because Appellants failed to pay 
the filing fees or obtain a fee waiver. 
(3) On May 21, 2025, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Appellants that the 
time to docket the record on appeal had expired, Appellants had 
not paid the filing fees, the record on appeal cannot be prepared 
and filed without full payment of all fees or an order allowing 
Appellants to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis , the matter 
would be brought to the court's attention on June 2, 2025 for 
action that may include dismissal of the appeal, and Appellants 
could seek relief from default by motion.

(4) Appellants have not taken any further action in 
this appeal. An appeal may be dismissed where the record on 
appeal has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay 
the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to 
proceed in forma pauperis . HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
