NO.  CAAP-25-0000297 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
In  the  Interest  of 
TA 
Born  on  00/00/2012. 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  FAMILY  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
(FC-S  NO.  24-00118) 
ORDER 
(By:   Nakasone,  Chief  Judge,  Leonard,  and  Wadsworth,  JJ.) 
Upon  consideration  of  the  March  31,  2025  Declaration  
in  Support  of  Motion  for  Leave  to  Proceed  on  Appeal  In  Forma 
Pauperis  (IFP  Motion)  and  the  June  10,  2025  Motion  to  Correct 
Record/Docket  on  Appeal  and  Remove  Counsel  (Motion  to  Correct 
Record),  the  papers  in  support,  and  the  record,  and  noting  no 
opposition  to  either  motion,  it  appears  that: 
(1) On
 March 31, 2025, Mother, self-represented, filed 
the notice of appeal, which appears to appeal from certain orders 
entered in the Family Court of the First Circuit (Family Court); 
(2) On
 the same date, Mother filed the IFP Motion, 
which appears to have been unnecessary under Hawai  Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 24(b); 
(3) Mother was represented by court-appointed counsel, 
Crystal Asano (Asano), in FC-S 24-00118 (the Family Court 
Proceeding );

(4) On April 23, 2025, the Family Court granted Asano's 
motion to withdraw as Mother's counsel in the Family Court 
Proceeding; 
(5) Asano, who is listed as Mother's counsel in this 
appeal on the Judiciary Information Management System, filed the 
Motion to Correct Record in order to make clear that she is not 
Mother's counsel on this appeal; 
(6) Meanwhile, the statement of jurisdiction and the 
abbreviated opening brief were due on or before May 12, 2025, 
and June 5, 2025, respectively; 
(7) Mother failed to file either document, or request 
an extension of time; 
(8) Mother has been conventionally served with multiple 
documents in this appeal at her address on record, including 
without limitation the June 17, 2025 Default and Statement of 
Jurisdiction & Opening Brief (Notice of Default ) informing Mother 
that the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction and 
abbreviated opening brief had expired, the matter would be called 
to the court's attention on June 27, 2025, for appropriate 
action, which could include dismissal of the appeal under Rules 
12.1(e) and 30 of the Hawai i Rules of Appellate Procedure,  and 
Mother could request relief from default; and 
(9) Mother has not taken further action in this appeal. 
Therefore,  IT  IS  HEREBY   ORDERED  that  the  appeal  is 
dismissed. 
IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED   that  all  pending  motions  are 
dismissed. 
IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED  that  the  appellate  clerk  shall 
mail  a  copy  of  this  order  to  Mother  at  her  address  on  record. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai i, July 18, 2025.
