APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Nakasone, Chief Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant JayJay J. Peter appeals from the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit's March 13, 2025 orders 
revoking his probation and sentencing him to a five-year term 
and ten-year term of imprisonment, to run concurrently with   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   
 
   credit for time served.1 On appeal, Peter challenges the 
revocation of his probation for failure to report to his 
probation officer at any point during the five months prior to 
his rearrest following release. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the issues raised and the arguments advanced, we resolve this 
appeal as discussed below, and affirm. 
Pursuant to a global plea deal in two criminal cases, 
on August 1, 2024, Peter was convicted of Burglary in the Second Degree and Theft in the First Degree, and a charge of 
Unauthorized Control of a Propelled Vehicle in the First Degree 
was dismissed. The parties also agreed to a sentence of a four-
year term of probation for each offense, to run concurrently, 
with 364 days of jail. The circuit court imposed the agreed-
upon sentence. 
As a condition of his probation, Peter was required to 
report to his probation officer upon release from confinement, either immediately or to schedule an appointment within 24 
hours: 
1 The Honorable Trish K. Morikawa presided. 
2   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
  
 [U]pon your release from confinement, you are ordered to 
report immediately to:  
 
Adult Client Services  
777 Punchbowl Street  
Honolulu, HI 96813  
(808) 539- 4500  
or upon release from any  term of  confinement, you are 
ordered to schedule an appointment with your probation officer or an Adult Client Services Branch designee within 24 hours of release[.]  
The next day, August 2, Peter was released from 
custody. Six weeks later, Probation Officer Danielle Boter 
declared that Peter failed to report to or contact probation 
within 24 hours of his release and his whereabouts were still 
unknown. The State moved to revoke Peter's probation, a bench 
warrant issued, and Peter was arrested on January 17, 2025, more than five months after his release from confinement. 
During the hearing on the motion to revoke, Peter 
admitted he did not report to his probation officer within 24 
hours after his release or anytime thereafter. Peter stated 
that, after his release from custody, he went to Waiʻ anae and was 
drinking with family, he was confused and forgot, he did not 
have a phone, he did not have his paperwork with him, and he did 
not know where the probation office was located. And when 
asked, "Did you ever go to the probation office after August 2, 
2024?" Peter responded, "No, I didn't." 
The circuit court found that Peter "inexcusably failed 
to comply with a substantial requirement of the Judgment setting 
3
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
   forth the terms and conditions of probation" and, thus, revoked 
his probation. Peter timely appealed from each order, which we 
consolidated. 
On appeal, Peter admits he did not report to his 
probation officer but contends the circuit court "erred in 
revoking [his] probation because there was insufficient evidence 
to support the Circuit Court's conclusion that [he] willfully 
and inexcusably failed to comply with the conditions of probation." 
Hawaiʻi
 Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706-624(1)(b) (2014) 
provides as a mandatory condition of probation "[t]hat the defendant report to a probation officer as directed by the court or the probation officer[.]" HRS § 706-625(3) (Supp. 2024) 
provides that the circuit court "shall revoke probation if the 
defendant has inexcusably failed to comply with a substantial 
requirement imposed as a condition of the order." 
In determining "inexcusability," we must look at 
whether Peter's actions were intentional, and if so, were his 
actions "a deliberate attempt to circumvent the court's 
probation order." State v. Villiarimo, 132 Hawaiʻ i 209, 222, 320 
P.3d 874, 887 (2014). 
"[T]he mind of an alleged offender may be 
read from his acts, conduct and inferences fairly drawn from all the circumstances." State v. Stocker, 90 Hawaiʻ i 85, 92, 976 
4   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
 P.2d 399, 406 (1999) (quoting State v. Sadino
, 64 Haw. 427, 430, 
642 P.2d 534, 537 (1982)). 
We review the circuit court's decision that Peter's 
failure to comply was inexcusable under the right/wrong 
standard. See State v. Lazar, 82 Hawaiʻ i 441, 443, 922 P.2d 
1054, 1056 (App. 1996). 
Here, the circuit court's probation order required 
Peter to report to his probation officer, at the latest, by 
scheduling an appointment within 24 hours from being released 
from confinement. The probation order provided the address and 
phone number for the probation office. 
Peter, however, did not report to his probation 
officer within the first 24 hours after being released from confinement. And Peter admitted to not reporting to the 
probation office at all after his release from confinement. 
Peter was arrested over five months after being released. 
Additionally, Peter acknowledges that this conduct 
differed from his conduct while on probation in 2005 and 2008, 
when he did meet with his district court probation officer. 
A reasonable inference from these circumstances is 
that Peter failed to report to his probation officer as ordered by the circuit court and for over five months thereafter. 
Failing to report at all to his probation officer for over five 
months evinces a deliberate attempt to evade complying with the 
5
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
 
   
 circuit court's probation order. See Villiarimo, 132 Hawaiʻ i at 
222, 320 P.3d at 887. 
Thus, the circuit court did not err in concluding 
Peter's failure to report to the probation office was 
inexcusable. 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's 
March 13, 2025 "Order of Resentencing and Revocation of 
Probation" in 1CPC-23-0000743 and 1CPC-23-0000826. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, January 27, 2026.
