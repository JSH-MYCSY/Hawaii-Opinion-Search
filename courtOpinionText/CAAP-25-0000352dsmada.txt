(1)  In  the  Stipulation,  under  Hawai i   Rules  of 
Appellate  Procedure  (HRAP)  Rule  42(b),  the  parties  stipulate  to 
dismiss  with  prejudice  all  claims  and  cross-claims  against  JPMC, 
to  bear  their  own  attorneys'  fees  and  costs  as  to  the  dismissal 
of  the  claims  and  cross-claims  against  JPMC,  and  the  Stipulation 
does  not  affect  Plaintiffs-Appellants  Alfred  Demello,  Jr., 
Cheryl  A.  Hall,  Rande  Lynn  Gramenz,  Katherine  A.  Patterson, 
Edward  Reder,  Nancy  Lynn  Sats,  Steven  L.  Wiltz,  and  Lori  J. 
Wiltz's  (together,  Appellants )  claims  against  Defendant/ 
Crossclaim  Defendant-Appellee  Bank  of  America,  N.A., 
Defendants/Cross-Claimants-Appellees  James  Thomas  McCleery  and 
Margaret  Ellen  McCleery,  and  Defendant-Appellee  Colin  P.  Thompson 
(together,  Remaining  Appellees ).   The  Stipulation  is  signed  by 
counsel  for  all  appearing  parties;

 filed the Stipulation, the circuit court 
clerk docketed the appeal;

extension of time for the transcripts to July 14, 2025; and 
(5) There appears to be good cause to grant the 
Extension Request, under HRAP Rule 26(b). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Stipulation is 
approved as follows: 
1. The appeal is dismissed with prejudice as to all 
claims and cross-claims against JPMC.
