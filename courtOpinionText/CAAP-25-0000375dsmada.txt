NO.  CAAP-25-0000375 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
MICHAEL   T  LODGE,  Trustee   of  the  524  KALANIKOA  IRREVOCABLE  TRUST 
dated  February  22,  2023,  Plaintiff-Appellee,  v. 
LARRY  A.  RUTKOWSKI,   Defendant-Appellant. 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  DISTRICT   COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT 
NORTH  AND  SOUTH  HILO  DIVISION 
(CIVIL  NO.  3DRC-24-0001886) 
ORDER  DISMISSING   APPEAL 
(By:   Leonard,   Presiding   Judge,  Hiraoka,   Wadsworth,   JJ.)
 
Upon  review  of  the  record,   it  appears   that  self-
represented   Defendant-Appellant
  Larry  A.  Rutkowski  appeals   from 
the  January   6,  2025  Judgment  for  Possession  entered  by  the 
District  Court  of  the  Third  Circuit.   Rutkowski  filed  the  April 
25,  2025  Notice  of  Appeal  more  than  thirty  days  after  entry  of 
the  Judgment,  which  is  outside  of  the  deadline  set  forth  in 
Hawai i  Rules  of  Appellate   Procedure   (HRAP)  Rule  4(a)(1).    The 
record  does  not  indicate  that  Rutkowski  received  an  extension  of 
time  to  appeal  under  HRAP  Rule  4(a)(4),  or  that  the  deadline  was 
otherwise  tolled  by  a  timely-filed  post-judgment  motion  under 
HRAP  Rule  4(a)(3).   Compliance  with  the  requirement  of  timely 
filing  a  notice  of  appeal  is  jurisdictional.   Grattafiori  v. 
State,  79  Hawai i  10,  13,  897  P.2d  937,  940  (1995).
