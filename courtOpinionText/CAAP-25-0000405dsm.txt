APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CCV-23-0000074) 
ORDER (1) DENYING MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE APPEALS AND 
(2) DISMISSING CASE NO. CAAP-25-0000405 
(By: Nakasone, Chief Judge, Leonard and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Plaintiff-Appellant Lauren 
Lipcon's (Lipcon) December 14, 2025 motion to consolidate CAAP-
25-0000305 and CAAP-25-0000405 (Motion to Consolidate), the 
papers in support, and the record in case numbers CAAP-25-
0000305 and CAAP-25-0000405, it appears that:   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  
 
 1. Lipcon seeks to consolidate the appeals in case 
numbers CAAP-25-0000305 and CAAP-25-0000405; 
2. In case number CAAP-25-0000305, Lipcon appealed 
from the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit's April 1, 2025 
oral ruling on her December 21, 2023 "Motion to Compel 
Arbitration of Amended Counterclaim" (Motion to Compel 
Arbitration) filed in 2CCV-23-0000074; 
3. On April 14, 2025, the circuit court reduced the 
oral ruling to a written order denying Lipcon's Motion to Compel Arbitration (Order Denying Motion to Compel Arbitration); 
4. The Order Denying Motion to Compel Arbitration is 
a final, appealable order under Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes § 658A-
28(a)(1) (2016) and Hawaiʻ i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 4(a)(2), and both appeals are from the Order Denying Motion 
to Compel Arbitration. The notice of appeal in CAAP-25-0000305, 
though premature, is deemed timely-filed under HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(2), and the notice of appeal in CAAP-25-0000405 was 
timely-filed under HRAP Rule 4(b)(1); and 
5. Therefore, the appeal in case number CAAP-25-
0000405 is duplicative and unnecessary, as the court will review 
the Order Denying Motion to Compel Arbitration in case number 
CAAP-25-0000305. Accordingly, we will sua sponte dismiss the 
appeal in case number CAAP-25-0000405, rendering the request for consolidation moot. See Ogeone v. Au, Nos. CAAP-18-0000190 and 
2   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 
  CAAP-18-0000951, 2019 WL 972542, at *1 (App. Feb. 27, 2019) 
(Order). 
Thus, IT IS ORDERED that the appeal in case number 
CAAP-25-0000405 is dismissed as unnecessary, and all pending 
motions in CAAP-25-0000405 are dismissed as moot. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Motion to Consolidate 
in CAAP-25-0000305 is denied as moot. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerk shall 
file this order in case numbers CAAP-25-0000305 and CAAP-25
-
0000405.
