Default of Statement of Jurisdiction and Opening Brief, stating the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction expired on July 25, 2025; the time for filing the opening brief expired on September 24, 2025; the matter would be called to the court's attention on October 13, 2025 for action that could include dismissal pursuant to HRAP Rules 12.1(e) and 30; and that Kahumoku could seek relief from default by motion. 
(4) The appellate clerk mailed the default notice to 
Kahumoku on October 1, 2025 at Kahumoku's address of record. The United States Postal Service returned the notice as "not deliverable as addressed." 
(5) Kahumoku has not filed a notice of change of 
address, consistent with HRAP Rule 25(f), has failed to file the statement of jurisdiction and the opening brief, and has not taken any further action in this appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is
