) filed the notice of appeal in this 
matter on June 2, 2025. The record on appeal was filed on July 29, 2025. The statement of jurisdiction and opening brief were due, without extension, on August 8, 2025 and September 8, 2025, respectively. Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP)

(2) On August 11, 2025, Appellants filed Alex Cadiz, 
Ernesto Basconcillo, and Leonila C. Basconcillo's Motion for 
Extension of Time to File Jurisdictional Statement and to Retain New Counsel, which requested an extension to November 6, 2025 to file the statement of jurisdiction, but did not request an extension of time to file the opening brief. On September 19, 2025, the court granted an extension of time until October 7, 2025 to file the statement of jurisdiction. 
(3) On October 9, 2025, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the statement of jurisdiction and opening brief, stating the time for filing the statement of jurisdiction expired on October 7, 2025; the time for filing the opening brief expired on September 8, 2025; the matter would be called to the court's attention on October 20, 2025 for action that could include dismissal, pursuant to HRAP Rules 12.1(e) and 30; and that Appellants could seek relief from default by motion. 
(4) Appellants have failed to file the statement of 
jurisdiction and the opening brief, and have not taken any further action in this appeal. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
