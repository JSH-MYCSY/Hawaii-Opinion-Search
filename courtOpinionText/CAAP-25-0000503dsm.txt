APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  THIRD  CIRCUIT 
(CASE  NO.  3CCV-23-0000325) 
ORDER  APPROVING  STIPULATION  TO  DISMISS  APPEAL 
(By: Leonard, Presiding
 Judge, Wadsworth and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon  consideration   of  the  November  10,  2025  Stipulation 
for  Dismissal  of  Appeal  with  Prejudice  (Stipulation),  filed  by 
Defendant-Appellee  Suzette  S.  Gurtler  (Gurtler),  the  papers  in 
support,  and  the  record,  it  appears  that: 
(1) The
 appeal has not been docketed. 
(2) Although the parties' Stipulation states it is 
being submitted pursuant to Hawai i  Rules of  Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 42(b), because the appeal has not been docketed, the 
matter is governed by HRAP Rule 42(a). The parties stipulate to 
dismiss the appeal with prejudice and bear their own attorneys' 
fees and costs. 
(3) The Stipulation is signed by counsel for Gurtler 
and by self-represented Plaintiff-Appellant Jonas Molloy.          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

approved pursuant to HRAP Rule 42(a) and the appeal is dismissed 
with prejudice. The parties shall bear their own attorneys' fees 
and costs.
