IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻ I 
CHRISTIAN P. CLEMENS, Claimant-Appellee/Appellee, 
v. 
PALI'S POOLS LLC, Employer-Appellant/Appellant, Delinquent, 
and SPECIAL COMPENSATION FUND, 
Appellee-Appellee. 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD 
(CASE NO. AB 2025-041; DCD NO. 2-2024-321025)) 
ORDER DISMISSING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION 
(By: Hiraoka, Presiding Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.) 
  Upon consideration of Employer/Appellant-Appellant 
Pali's Pools, LLC's (Pali's Pools) January 26, 2026 Motion for 
Relief from Order Dismissing Appeal and to Reinstate Appeal Due to Excusable Neglect (Motion for Reconsideration), the papers in support, and the record,  it appears that: 
1
(1) Pali's Pools, self-represented through its owner, 
Paul Norris (Norris), seeks reconsideration of the December 23, 2025 Order Dismissing Appeal; 
1 The court did not consider self- represented Claimant/Appellee-
Appellee Christian P. Clemens's January 28, 2026 Memorandum in Opposition to 
Employer- Appellant's Motion to Reinstate Appeal, because a response to a 
motion for reconsideration is not permitted unless requested by the court.

              (2) Norris is not a licensed attorney and may not 
represent his limited liability company, Pali's Pools, in this 
appeal. See Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes §§ 605-2, 605-14 (2016); 
Oahu Plumbing & Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr., Inc., 60 Haw. 
372, 377, 590 P.2d 570, 574 (1979) ("non-attorney agents are not allowed to represent corporations in litigation"); Kailua 50 LLC 
v.
 Ichida Kemp, No. CAAP-19-0000799, 2020 WL 429323, at *1 (Haw. 
App. Jan. 28, 2020) (SDO) (holding a non-attorney is not allowed 
to represent a limited liability company in litigation); and 
(3) A motion for reconsideration of the December 23, 
2025 order was due on or before January 2, 2026. See HRAP 
Rule 40(a) ("A motion for reconsideration may be filed by a party only within 10 days after the filing of the . . . dispositional order, or ruling . . . ."). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for 
Reconsideration is dismissed as unauthorized and untimely. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed.
