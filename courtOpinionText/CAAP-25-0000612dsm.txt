NO.  CAAP-25-0000612 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
THOMAS  SCHMIDT,  Plaintiff/Counterclaim  Defendant-Appellant,  v. 
JERE  GEARHART  and  DALE  GEARHART, 
Defendants/Counterclaimants/Third-Party  Plaintiffs-Appellees, 
and  BRIGIDA  A.  SCHMIDT,  Third-Party  Defendant-Appellee 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  FIRST  CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL  NO.  1CCV-19-0002015) 
ORDER  DISMISSING  APPEAL 
(By:
 Leonard, Presiding
 Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.) 
Upon  consideration  of  Plaintiff/Counterclaim  Defendant-
Appellant  Thomas  Schmidt's  (Schmidt )  November  26,  2025  Motion  to 
Remand  to  Circuit  Court  for  Entry  of  a  Judgment,  the  papers  in 
support  and  in  opposition,  and  the  record,  it  appears  that: 
(1)
 The statement of jurisdiction and opening brief 
were due October 13, 2025 and November 12, 2025, respectively; 
(2) Schmidt failed to file either document or request 
an extension of time; 
(3) On
 November 17, 2025, the appellate clerk entered a 
default notice informing Schmidt that the time for filing the 
statement of jurisdiction and opening brief had expired, the 
matter would be called to the court's attention on November 27, 
2025 for appropriate action, which could include dismissal of the 
appeal under Hawai i Rules  of Appellate Procedure Rules 12.1(e) 
and 30, and Schmidt could request relief from default by motion; 
(4) Schmidt has not taken any further action in this 
appeal;          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
        
          
          
         
         
           
         
        
          
            
         
         
  
          
          
       
       
  
        
            
        
          (5) Schmidt seeks a temporary remand of the appeal, 
arguing that the September 19, 2022 Final Judgment and March 4, 
2024 Final Judgment in Favor of Brigida A. Schmidt and against 
Thomas Frank Schmidt (March 4, 2024 Final Judgment ) fail to 
comply with the requirements of Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming 
& Wright, 76 Haw. 115, 869 P.21 1334 (1994), and the September 
19, 2022 Final Judgment contains an error in the caption; 
(6) The September 19, 2022 Final Judgment complies with 
Jenkins , as it "show[s] finality as to all claims against all 
parties" on its face, 76 Haw. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339, and 
Schmidt has not sought relief from the Circuit Court under 
Hawai i Rules of Civil Procedure  Rule 60(a) to correct any 
clerical error; and 
(7) The March 4, 2024 Final Judgment is not subject to 
Jenkins requirements. Ditto v. McCurdy , 103 Hawai i 153, 158, 80 
P.3d
 974, 979 (2003) ("[T]he separate judgment requirement 
articulated in Jenkins is inapposite in the post-judgment 
context."). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the November 26, 
2025 Motion to Remand to Circuit Court for Entry of a Judgment is 
denied. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appeal is dismissed 
under Hawai i  Rules of  Appellate Procedure Rules 12.1(e) and 30. 
DATED:   Honolulu,   Hawai i,  January   8,  2026.
