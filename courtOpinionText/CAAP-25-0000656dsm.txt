NO. CAAP-25-0000656 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI #I 
ALVIN K. KEAHI, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. 
AUDREY AGENA; et al., Defendants-Appellees,
and 
MILTON K.C. CHING; et al., Interested Parties-Appellees,
and 
KONA WONG KAPULE, Interested Person-Appellant. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 5CCV-24-0000077) 
ORDER 
(By: Nakasone, Chief Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Plaintiff-Appellee Alvin K.
Keahi
's October 28, 2025 Motion to Dismiss Appeal, the papers in 
support and in opposition, and the record, it appears that Keahi 
seeks dismissal of the appeal filed by self-represented Defendant-Appellant Kona Wong Kapule for lack of jurisdiction. 
Kapule appeals from the Circuit Court of the Fifth 
Circuit's August 28, 2025 oral order ( Oral Order ) denying his 
July 31, 2025 "Special Appearance and Motion to Quash Amended NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 Complaint." A minute order is not an appealable order. Abrams 
v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai #i 319, 321 n.3, 966 
P.2d 631, 633 n.3 (1998). However, even if the Oral Order was 
reduced to a written order, this court would nonetheless lack appellate jurisdiction because the Oral Order is not a decision that could be reduced to a final judgment, see Hawai# i
 Revised 
Statutes ( HRS) § 641-1(a) (2016); Hawai #i Rules of Civil 
Procedure Rules 54(b), 58; Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai #i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994), the 
Circuit Court has not granted Kapule leave for an interlocutory appeal under HRS § 641-1(b), and the Oral Order would not be independently appealable under the collateral-order or Forgay
 
doctrines. See Greer v. Baker, 137 Hawai #i 249, 253, 369 P.3d 
832, 836 (2016) (setting forth the requirements for appealability under the collateral-order and Forgay doctrines); cf. Brown v. Wong, 71 Haw. 519, 795 P.2d 283 (1990) (holding that an order denying the State's motion to dismiss based on sovereign immunity is not an appealable collateral order). 1
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is 
granted, and the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
