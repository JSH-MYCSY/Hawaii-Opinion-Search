a default of the record on appeal, informing Dolzozi that the time to docket the record on appeal had expired, Dolzozi had not paid the filing fees, the record on appeal cannot be prepared and filed without full payment of all fees or an order allowing Dolzozi to proceed on appeal 
in forma pauperis, the matter would 
be brought to the court's attention on December 29, 2025 for action that may include dismissal of the appeal, and Dolzozi could seek relief from default by motion. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(4) Dolzozi has not taken any further action in this 
appeal. An appeal may be dismissed where the record on appeal 
has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to proceed in forma pauperis. HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed.
