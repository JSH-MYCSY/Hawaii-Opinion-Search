v. 
TANMAYO ANNEX NICOLE MOREAU BROWN, Respondent-Appellee. 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
WAILUKU DIVISION 
(CASE NO. 2DSS-25-0000115) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that: 
(1) On November 12, 2025, self-represented Petitioner-
Appellant Breeze Corlion Dolzozi (Dolzozi
) filed a notice of 
appeal. 
(2) The record on appeal was due January 2, 2026. See 
Hawai#i Rules of Appellate Procedure (
HRAP) Rule 11(b)(1). 
(3) On January 6, 2026, the appellate clerk entered a 
default of the record on appeal, informing Dolzozi that the time 
to docket the record on appeal had expired, Dolzozi had not paid the filing fees, the record on appeal cannot be prepared and filed without full payment of all fees or an order allowing Dolzozi to proceed on appeal 
in forma pauperis, the matter would 
be brought to the court's attention on January 16, 2026 for action that may include dismissal of the appeal, and Dolzozi could seek relief from default by motion. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(4) Dolzozi has not taken any further action in this 
appeal. An appeal may be dismissed where the record on appeal 
has not been prepared because the appellant failed to pay the required fees or obtain an order allowing the appellant to proceed in forma pauperis. HRAP Rule 11(b)(2), (c)(2). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai#i, February 19, 2026.
