APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  SECOND  CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL  NO.  2CCV-24-0001007) 
ORDER  GRANTING  IN  PART  MOTION  TO  DISMISS  APPEAL 
(By: Leonard, Presiding
 Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.) 
Upon  consideration   of  Plaintiffs-Appellees  David  Brown 
and  Santo  Triolo's  (Appellees )  December  19,  2025  Motion  to 
Dismiss  Appeal  and  for  Award  of  Attorneys'  Fees  and  Costs,  the 
papers  in  support,  the  record,  and  there  being  no  timely 
opposition  filed,  it  appears  as  follows. 
On  November   18,  2025,  self-represented  Defendant-
Appellant  Augustine  Andrew  Ponce  (Appellant )  filed  a  notice  of 
appeal  from  the  Circuit  Court  of  the  Second  Circuit's  October  16, 
2025  Judgment  on  Findings  of  Fact,  Conclusions  of  Law,  and  Order 
Granting  Plaintiffs'  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  and  for 
Interlocutory  Decree  of  Foreclosure  (Judgment ).   Appellees  seek 
dismissal  of  the  appeal  as  untimely. 
The court lacks appellate jurisdiction because the 
notice of appeal was not timely-filed within thirty days of the          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
        
         
         
           
         
        
         
   
       
         
           
         
       
          
         
        
           
        
          
           
       
 
       
          
   Judgment, as required under Hawai i Rules of Appellate  Procedure 
(HRAP)
 Rule 4(a)(1),1 and the record does not indicate that 
Appellant received an extension of time to appeal under HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(4), or that the deadline was tolled by a timely post-
judgment motion under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). Compliance with the 
requirement of timely filing a notice of appeal is 
jurisdictional. Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai i 10, 13, 897  
P.2d 937, 940 (1995). 
Appellees further seek an award of their attorneys' 
fees and costs in bringing their motion, citing Hawai i Revised 
Statutes (HRS)
 § 604-10.5(h) and HRAP Rule 39. HRS § 604-10.5(h) 
(2016) governs awards of attorneys' fees and costs in District 
Court actions to enjoin and temporarily restrain harassment; 
however, this appeal is from a Circuit Court foreclosure case. 
While HRAP Rule 39(a) allows taxation of costs against an 
appellant when dismissing an appeal, Appellees' motion does not 
request an award of costs. Thus, the court will deny the 
request. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the December 19, 
2025 Motion to Dismiss Appeal and for Award of Attorneys' Fees 
and Costs is granted in part and denied in part as follows: 
1. The appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction. 
2. The request for attorneys' fees and costs is 
denied.

1 Per HRAP Rules 4(a)(1) and 26(a), the deadline to appeal was 
Monday, November 17, 2025.
