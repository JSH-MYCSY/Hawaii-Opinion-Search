NO.  CAAP-25-0000845 
IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
IN  THE  MATTER  OF  THE  PHYLLIS  ANN  WOLF  REVOCABLE  LIVING  TRUST 
DATED  JULY  9,  1999,  AS  AMENDED 
APPEAL  FROM  THE  CIRCUIT  COURT  OF  THE  SECOND  CIRCUIT 
(CASE  NO.  2CTR-24-0000014) 
ORDER 
(By: Leonard,
 Presiding Judge, McCullen and Guidry, JJ.) 
Upon  consideration   of  Respondent-Appellee  Mele  Jean 
Strickland,  Trustee  for  the  Phyllis  Ann  Wolf  Revocable  Living 
Trust  Dated  July  9,  1999's  (Strickland )  February  2,  2026  Motion 
to  Dismiss  Appeal  Filed  by  Kanani  Ann  Wolf  on  December  1,  2025, 
the  papers  in  support  and  in  opposition,  and  the  record,  it 
appears  that: 
(1) Petitioner-Appellant
 Kanani Ann Wolf (Wolf) appeals 
from the September 30, 2025 Final Judgment entered in the Circuit 
Court of the Second Circuit; 
(2) Strickland
 requests that the court dismiss the 
appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Wolf's December 1, 2025 
notice of appeal was not filed within thirty days of the Final 
Judgment, as required by Hawai i Rules  of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1), and Wolf failed to obtain an extension of 
time to appeal under HRAP Rule 4(a)(4); 
(3) Strickland further requests taxation of costs 
against Wolf pursuant to HRAP Rule 39(a), to be awarded after 
submission of an itemized and verified bill of costs;          NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
        
           
          
          
        
          
       
        
        
        
       
       
        
    
      (4) The court concludes that Wolf's notice of appeal 
was not timely filed, and an appellant's failure to file a timely 
notice of appeal is a jurisdictional defect that can neither be 
waived by the parties nor disregarded by the court in the 
exercise of judicial discretion, Enos v. Pac. Transfer & 
Warehouse, Inc., 80 Hawai i 345, 349, 910  P.2d 116, 120 (1996); 
and 
(5) Strickland has not submitted an itemized and 
verified bill of costs to be taxed against Wolf. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is 
granted in part and denied in part as follows: 
1. The appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate 
jurisdiction. 
2. The request for taxation of costs is denied 
without prejudice to Strickland filing such a request that 
complies with HRAP Rule 39(d).
