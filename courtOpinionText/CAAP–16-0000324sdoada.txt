SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Ginoza, Chief Judge, Reifurth and Chan, JJ.)
 
On appeal are two consolidated cases, CAAP-16-0000324
 
and CAAP-16-0000587, arising from the same underlying matter
 
concerning various post-judgment motions regarding the award of
 child custody and child support with respect to two minor
 children shared by Defendant-Appellant KP (Mother or Defendant)
 and Plantiff-Appellee SC (Father or Plaintiff) in the Family
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Court of the Third Circuit (family court).1
 
In CAAP-16-0000324, Mother challenges a "Memorandum
 
Decision" dated March 27, 2015,2 issued to the parties by the
 
family court, the "Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
 
Reconsideration from Court's Memorandum Decision Dated March 27,
 2015" filed on August 3, 2015, the "Order Denying Defendant's
 Motion to Reconsider filed on August 18, 2015" filed on 
September 3, 2015, and the "Order on Plaintiff's Motion for
 Reconsideration from Court's Memorandum Decision, Filed Herein on
 April 6, 2015" filed on March 10, 2016.
 
In CAAP-16-0000587, Mother appeals from the "Findings
 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision of the Court" filed on
 July 27, 2016 (FOFCOL and Decision). 
On appeal, Mother contends that the family court erred
 
by: 1) denying Mother's claim for reimbursement for health
 insurance premiums she had paid, 2) failing to award Mother
 reimbursement for child support arrearages due from January 2009
 through October 2012, and 3) not awarding Mother full
 reimbursement for their minor children's expenses paid by Mother.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Mother's
 points on appeal as follows and affirm.
 
Mother and Father divorced on November 12, 2010. The
 
1
 The Honorable Lloyd Van De Car presided over both cases.

 It appears that the Memorandum Decision was not filed in the family
court proceeding and is therefore not part of the record on appeal.
 
[D]ocuments, such as clerk minutes and letters to and from
the court, that are in, attached to, or appended to thelower court record but which have not been "filed" in the lower court record as evidenced by the court clerk's filestamp, are not a part of the record on appeal. [Hawai 'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP)] Rule 10(a). In other words, for purposes of the appeal, these documents do notexist and may not be cited as if they exist. HRAP Rule 28(b). 
Webb v. Harvey , 103 Hawai 'i 63, 66, 79 P.3d 681, 684 (App. 2003). 
Thus, we do
not consider t
he Memorandum Decision.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
divorce decree awarded: 1) Mother and Father joint legal custody
 
and shared physical custody of their two children, 2) Mother with
 monthly child support in the amount of $200.00, and 3) no spousal
 support. Subsequently, Mother and Father disputed various child
 visitation, child custody, and child support issues through a
 number of post-judgment motions. Following a series of orders
 entered by the family court addressing the various post-judgment
 motions, the family court appears to have issued a Memorandum
 Decision, dated March 27, 2015, from which Mother and Father
 submitted post-judgment motions for relief. Although the
 Memorandum Decision was not made part of the record, and is
 therefore not available for review on appeal, based on our review
 of the record, the disposition of the various post-judgment
 orders is finally resolved and reflected in the FOFCOL and
 Decision.
 
In the FOFCOL and Decision entered on July 27, 2016,
 
the family court ordered the following:
 
1. Based on the guidelines applicable when the Motion was
filed and heard, commencing March 1, 2014, Plaintiff's
monthly child support obligation shall be $249, per child,
per month, for a total of $498, per month.
 
2. The Court determines that except for anything Plaintiff
may owe from March 1, 2014, on account of this decision, and
Defendant's $624 overpayment, Plaintiff owes no child
support arrearages. The issue of child support owing from
September 28, 2007, to January 13, 2009 remains unresolved,
and either party may set that matter for hearing. 
3. To the extent that Defendant is seeking reimbursement for
any medical insurance premiums she has paid on behalf of the
children, that request is denied. Neither is Plaintiff
entitled to reimbursement for the health insurance premiums
he paid.
 
4. Plaintiff incurred post-divorce out of pocket medical
expenses for the children totaling $1,033.87, and Defendant
incurred a total of $222.71. Reconciling these amounts
results in Defendant owing Plaintiff $405.58.
 
5. Regarding the childrens' [sic] expenses for school and
extracurricular activities, Plaintiff spent $356.00, and
Defendant spent $377.34. Plaintiff owes Defendant one-half
the difference between these two amounts, or $10.67.
 
6. Plaintiff is entitled to reimbursement for one-half of
 the federal taxes he paid in the amount of $5,378.46, during
the pendency of the divorce. As such, Defendant owes
Plaintiff the sum of $2,689.23.

7. Defendant owes Plaintiff the sum of $2,292.22, for her
proportionate share of the cost of the childrens' [sic]
medical insurance, pursuant to the terms of the Divorce
Decree, filed November 12, 2010. 
8. Plaintiff owes Defendant the sum of $1,044.19, for his
share of the childrens' [sic] cell phone bill.
9. Defendant owes Plaintiff the sum of $1,048.50, for her
share of the timeshare maintenance fees for 2013, 2014, and
2015.
10. All other pending requests for relief not addressed here
are denied.  
Mother essentially argues that the family court erred
by denying her requests for reimbursements for medical insurance
premiums for their children, an award of all child support
arrearages, and reimbursement for medical bills and other
expenses for their children, that had been paid by Mother.
"Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion
in making its decisions and those decisions will not be set aside
unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion."  Kakinami v.
Kakinami, 127 Hawai #i 126, 136, 276 P.3d 695, 705 (2012). 
Further, "[s]ince no rules or guidelines have been published
advising the family court how to decide [a certain child support
issue], the relevant appellate standard of review is the abuse of
discretion standard.  Clark v. Clark , 110 Hawai #i 459, 465, 134
P.3d 625, 631 (App. 2006) (internal quotation marks, citation,
and brackets omitted).  "Thus, [an appellate court] will not
disturb the family court's decision on appeal unless the family
court disregarded the rules or principles of law or practice to
the substantial detriment of a party litigant and its decision
clearly exceeded the bounds of reason."  Kakinami , 127 Hawai #i at
136, 276 P.3d at 705.   
Here, the family court denied Mother's request for
reimbursement of health insurance premiums that she had paid
during a period when Father was responsible for providing medical
insurance for their children and Mother had believed that her
children were not covered under Father.  In support of this
decision, the family court found the following:
[t]he Divorce Decree [filed November 12, 2010] requires
[Mother] maintain and continue paying the premiums on the
childrens' [sic] medical, vision, drug and dental insurance
4NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
until [Father] has equivalent coverage available to him.
[Mother's] Exhibit V establishes that [Father] provided
health insurance coverage for the children effective
December 1, 2010. It appears from the evidence that
[Father] has continued to maintain that coverage since.
There was no evidence presented to the Court to establish
what coverage [Mother] was providing on the date of the
Divorce Decree or whether equivalent coverage was available
to [Father] prior to December 1, 2010.
 
We note that the family court included its findings in the 
conclusions of law section of the FOFCOL and Decision, however, we construe these as findings of fact rather than conclusions of law. Mother does not challenge these findings of fact on appeal, and we must therefore accept them for purposes of this appeal. See Bremer v. Weeks, 104 Hawai' i 43, 63, 85 P.3d 150, 170 
(2004)("'[F]indings of fact . . . that are not challenged on appeal are binding on the appellate court.'"). Accordingly, we conclude that the family court did not abuse its discretion in rendering its decision regarding the denial of Mother's request for medical insurance premiums. 
In regard to Mother's request for child support
 
arrearages, the family court ruled as follows:
 
The Court determines that except for anything [Father] may
owe from March 1, 2014, on account of this decision, and
[Mother's] $624 overpayment, [Father] owes no child support
arrearages. The issue of child support owing from
September 28, 2007, to January 13, 2009 remains unresolved,
and either party may set that matter for hearing.
 
The family court indicated that it based its decision and
 
calculation upon review of all the previous child support orders
 entered and the amounts paid and unpaid in connection with those
 orders from the date the divorce decree was entered. Further, at
 the hearing on December 9, 2014, Mother testified that according
 to the Child Support Enforcement Agency, no unpaid child support
 was outstanding from the date the divorce decree was entered and
 the arrearages that were being requested were claims for
 retroactive payment of child support prior to the divorce decree. 
Mother did not point to any finalized orders requiring child
 support payments which had been violated. Based on the
 foregoing, we conclude that the family court did not abuse its
 discretion when it ruled on Mother's request for child support
 arrearages, as set forth above.

Finally, Mother challenges the family court's
 
calculation of reimbursements owed in regards to the children's
 
expenses including medical, school, extracurricular, and the
 children's cell phone bill. In support of the family court's
 calculation of reimbursements owed to Mother and Father, pursuant
 to the terms set forth in the divorce decree, it considered the
 exhibits submitted by Mother and Father containing receipts,
 records, bills, and other supporting documentation, and the
 testimony provided at the evidentiary hearing. We conclude that
 the family court did not abuse its discretion in its
 determination for reimbursements. Additionally, Mother has
 failed to demonstrate that the family court disregarded the rules
 or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of
 a party litigant and that its decision clearly exceeded the
 bounds of reason.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Findings of
 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision of the Court" filed on
 July 27, 2016, in the Family Court of the Third Circuit is
 affirmed.
