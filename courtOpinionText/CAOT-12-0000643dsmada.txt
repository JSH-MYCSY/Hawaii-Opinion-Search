ORDER DISMISSING WITHOUT PREJUDICE
 
PETITIONER-APPELLANT’S COMPLAINT FILED ON
 
JULY 17, 2012 AND APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER CAOT-12-0000643
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the complaint that Petitioner 
Arwin E. Echineque (Petitioner Echineque) filed on July 17, 2012, 
in the Hawai' i Intermediate Court of Appeals in appellate court 
case number CAOT-12-0000643, the papers in support, and the records and files herein, it appears that Petitioner Echineque's July 17, 2012 complaint is not part of an appeal from S.P.P. No. 10-1-0066 or Criminal No. 06-1-1633, but, instead, Petitioner Echineque's July 17, 2012 complaint purports to invoke original NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
jurisdiction in the Hawai' i Intermediate Court of Appeals for the 
purpose of asserting causes of action arising out of alleged 
personal injuries and alleged civil rights violations. Pursuant to HRS § 602-57 (Supp. 2011), the Intermediate Court of Appeals does not have original jurisdiction to address the issues that Petitioner Echineque raises in his July 17, 2012 complaint. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Petitioner Echineque's
 
July 17, 2012 complaint in appellate court case number CAOT-12­0000643 is dismissed without prejudice to Petitioner Echineque
 presenting his arguments in a complaint that Petitioner Echineque
 files in a circuit court or a district court. Appellate court
 case number CAOT-12-0000643 is dismissed in its entirety.
