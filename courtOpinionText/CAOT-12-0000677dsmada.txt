IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
ARWIN R. ECHINEQUE, Petitioner-Appellant, v
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P.
 NO. 10-1-0066; CR. NO. 06-1-1633)
 
ORDER DISMISSING WITHOUT PREJUDICE PETITIONER-APPELLANT’S
 
COMPLAINTS FILED ON JULY 30, 2012, AND AUGUST 1, 2012
AND THE ENTIRETY OF APPELLATE COURT CASE NUMBER CAOT-12-0000677
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the two complaints that 
Petitioner Arwin E. Echineque (Petitioner Echineque) filed on 
July 30, 2012, and August 1, 2012, in the Hawai
'i Intermediate 
Court of Appeals in appellate court case number CAOT-12-0000677, the papers in support, and the records and files herein, it appears that Petitioner Echineque's July 30, 2012 complaint and August 1, 2012 complaint are not part of an appeal from S.P.P. No. 10-1-0066 or Criminal No. 06-1-1633, but, instead, purport to invoke original jurisdiction in the Hawai' i Intermediate Court of 
Appeals for the purpose of asserting causes of action arising out of alleged personal injuries and alleged civil rights violations. Pursuant to HRS § 602-57 (Supp. 2011), the Hawai' i Intermediate 
Court of Appeals does not have original jurisdiction to address the issues that Petitioner Echineque raises in his July 30, 2012 complaint and August 1, 2012 complaint. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Petitioner Echineque's
 
July 30, 2012 complaint and August 1, 2012 complaint in appellate
 court case number CAOT-12-0000677 are dismissed without prejudice
 to Petitioner Echineque presenting his arguments in a complaint
 
that Petitioner Echineque files in a circuit court or a district
 court. Appellate court case number CAOT-12-0000677 is dismissed
 in its entirety.
