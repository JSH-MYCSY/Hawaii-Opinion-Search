v. 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NOS. 1CC121003182; 1PC061001633) 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and McCullen, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of self-represented Petitioner 
Arwin R. Echineque'
s complaint filed December 29, 2016, in CAOT-
16-0000887, the papers in support, and the record and files 
herein, it appears as follows: 
(1) Echineque identifies Civil No. 12-1-3182 (1CC121003182) and Criminal No. 06-1-1633 (1PC061001633) as underlying cases; 
(2) Echineque asserts he suffered weight-lifting injuries while imprisoned for a 2007 conviction for Assault in the Second Degree and Terroristic Threatening in the Second Degree in Criminal No. 06-1-1633; 
(3) Echineque seeks one million dollars in damages; 
(4) To the extent Echineque seeks to initiate a civil claim, this court lacks original jurisdiction to hear his claims, see Hawai# i Revised Statutes 602-
57 (2016); and NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(5) To the extent Echineque seeks an appeal from a 
decision in Civil No. 12-1-3182 or Criminal No. 06-1-1633, the "complaint" cannot be construed, even liberally, as appealing from any particular order or judgment entered in either case. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that CAOT-16-0000887 is 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerk shall 
mail a copy of this order to Craig Iha, Deputy Attorney General, Supervisor, Public Safety, 425 Queen Street, Honolulu, HI 96813. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 4, 2026.
