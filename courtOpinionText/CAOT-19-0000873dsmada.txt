NO. CAOT-19-0000873
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
BRIAN NOBU PURUGGANAN, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Respondent-Appellee.
ORDER DISMISSING CASE NUMBER CAOT-19-0000873 FOR LACK OF
JURISDICTION AND DISMISSING ALL PENDING MOTIONS AS MOOT
(By:  Ginoza, Chief Judge, Leonard and Wadsworth, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the non-conforming petition that
Petitioner Brian Nobu Purugganan (Purugganan) filed against
Respondent-Appellee State of Hawai#i (the State) on December 26,
2019, in case number CAOT-19-0000873, it appears Purugganan is
attempting to invoke original jurisdiction in the Intermediate
Court of Appeals.  Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 602-57
(2016), the Intermediate Court of Appeals does not have original
jurisdiction to address Purugganan's December 26, 2019 petition.
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that CAOT-19-0000873 is
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that all pending motions
in CAOT-19-0000873 are dismissed as moot.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai#i, May 8, 2020.
