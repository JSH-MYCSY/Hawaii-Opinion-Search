SEPTEMBER 3, 2020 
LEONARD, PRESIDING JUDGE, AND CHAN, J., WITH
HIRAOKA, J., CONCURRING AND DISSENTING IN PART 
OPINION AND ORDER OF THE COURT BY LEONARD, J. 
On August 26, 2020, Plaintiff State of Hawai# i (State), 
by and through its Attorney General Clare E. Connors (
AG), filed 
a Complaint for Injunctive Relief (Complaint), naming the State's 
Chief Election Officer Scott T. Nago (Nago) as Defendant. The 
Complaint includes an Agreed Upon Statement of Facts, Issues, and 
Reasons in Support, and is accompanied by a Declaration by Nago.   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Complaint concerns a special election to fill a 
vacant seat in the Hawai# i Senate. The parties agree that if 
candidates are nominated, or file nomination papers, up until the 
latest possible date contemplated under the applicable statute, which is September 24, 2020, then the Office of Elections will not have sufficient time to provide ballots to uniformed service members and other overseas voters. 
The parties further agree 
that the candidate filing deadline for this Senate seat should be advanced to September 5, 2020, to provide sufficient time for the Office of Elections to provide ballots to uniformed service members and other overseas voters in compliance with state and federal statutory mandates. The parties do not agree on the proper method to advance the candidate filing deadline and ask this court to determine, on an expedited basis: 
1. Whether Hawaii Revised Statutes (
HRS) § 17-3(b)(3) 
(2009) and HRS Chapter 15D (Supp. 2019) confer discretion on Nago to advance the candidate filing deadline for the subject special election from September 24, 2020, to September 5, 2020; and 
2. If Nago does not have the discretion to advance 
the candidate filing deadline, whether the AG may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief pursuant to HRS § 15D-17,
1 
which will effectively advance the candidate filing deadline for 
1 Although the Complaint principally states that it seeks injunctive
relief, other equitable remedies are sought as well. 
2 I. JURISDICTIONFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the subject special election from September 24, 2020, to 
September 5, 2020. 
For the reasons set forth below, we hold that Nago does 
not have the discretion to unilaterally advance a candidate filing deadline, but that construing the applicable statutes with reference to each other, there is an alternative means to ensure substantial compliance with HRS Chapter 15D, the Uniform Military and Overseas Voters Act. 
We deny the AG's request for injunctive 
relief, but grant other equitable relief including a declaration that the subject statutes must be construed with reference to each other and in a manner to ensure that ballots and balloting materials for the City and County of Honolulu, including for the special election to fill the vacant Senate seat, are transmitted no later than September 18, 2020, and instructions to Nago to accept the nomination of party candidates and the nomination papers of nonpartisan candidates for the special election for the Sixteenth District of the Hawai# i State Senate not later than 
4:30 p.m., on Saturday, September 5, 2020. 
 
HRS § 602-57(2) (2016) confers jurisdiction upon the 
Hawai# i Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) over an original 
civil action that is submitted on agreed facts: 
§ 602-57 Jurisdiction.  Notwithstanding any other law
to the contrary, the intermediate appellate court shall have
jurisdiction, subject to transfer as provided in section602-58 or review on application for a writ of certiorari asprovided in section 602-59:

Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 18 
further provides: 
Rule 18. Agreed Facts; Submission On.
(a) Submission.  As authorized by law, the parties to
a dispute that might be the subject of a civil action orproceeding in any court or agency may, without the action ofa trial court or agency, agree to submit a case directly tothe intermediate court of appeals upon a statementcontaining the facts upon which the controversy depends, astatement of the question or issues, the contentions of theparties as to each issue, and the form of judgment that eachparty requests the intermediate court of appeals to render.
(b) Good Faith.  It must be shown by affidavit or
declaration that the controversy is real and that theproceedings are a good faith effort to determine the rightsof the parties.
(c) Disposition.  The appellate court may refuse to
entertain a case submitted on agreed facts. If the appellate court entertains the case, the judgment renderedthereon shall be entered and may be enforced as in othercases, subject to the right of a party to move forreconsideration or, if the case is decided in theintermediate court of appeals, apply for a writ ofcertiorari. 
This case, submitted to the ICA upon agreed facts, 
falls within the parameters of HRS § 602-57(2) and HRAP Rule 18. 
We hereby exercise our discretion to entertain this case and render a decision based upon the facts agreed to by the parties. II. AGREED UPON FACTS

On June 18, 2020, the Honorable Breene Harimoto 
(Senator Harimoto), the Hawai# i State Senator for District 16, 
2 The parties submitted additional agreed facts, as well as their
respective formulations of the issues and the reasons and authorities in
support of their positions, in conjunction with the Agreed Upon Statement ofFacts filed with the Complaint. Pursuant to this court's August 27, 2020Order, on August 28, 2020, the parties filed a Supplemental Statement ofAgreed Upon Facts.

passed away.3 Had he not died, Senator Harimoto's term would 
have ended on November 8, 2022. The parties agree that, pursuant 
to Hawai# i law, a special election to fill the vacancy left by 
Senator Harimoto's death must be held at the upcoming November 3, 
2020 general election (General Election). 
The parties agree, and Nago avers, as follows. The 
Office of Elections is responsible for printing paper ballots and 
generating HTML ballots, which are included in the ballot packages transmitted to voters by their respective counties. Based on the programming used to generate the ballots, the ballots are finalized on a countywide basis and cannot be finalized by district. The City and County of Honolulu's ballots cannot be finalized until the list of Senate District 16 candidates is finalized. Once the list of candidates is finalized, the Office of Elections needs a minimum of twelve days to generate, proof, print, and deliver paper ballots and HTML ballots to the City and County of Honolulu. There are approximately 478,926 active registered voters in the City and County of Honolulu. 
On August 26, 2020, Nago issued a Proclamation stating 
that a special election will be held on November 3, 2020, to fill the vacant seat caused by the death of Senator Harimoto. The Proclamation provides that party candidates shall be nominated by 
3 We note in passing that prior to Senator Harimoto, the current
governor of Hawai #i, the Honorable David Ige, represented this district from
November of 1994, to the time he was elected as governor.

the county committees of the parties and submitted to the Office 
of Elections no later than 4:30 p.m. on Saturday, September 5, 2020. Nonpartisan candidates are to file their nomination papers within the same time frame. The Proclamation states that the Office of Elections will be open on Saturday, September 5, 2020. The parties point out that, unlike the typical nomination paper process in regularly-scheduled elections, no signatures are required on the nomination papers to be submitted by candidates wishing to run in this special election.
4 
On August 26, 2020, the Proclamation was posted on the 
homepage of the Office of Elections' website and submitted to the Garden Island, The Maui News, Hawaii Tribune-Herald, West Hawaii Today, and Honolulu Star-Advertiser for publication. The publication dates for the Proclamation were August 29, 2020, for The Maui News, and August 30, 2020, for all other publications. Copies of the Proclamation were emailed to each of the qualified political parties, and a call was also placed to each political party. III. DISCUSSION 
HRS § 17-3 (2009) provides various mandates for the 
filling of a vacancy in the Hawai# i Senate.
5 Applicable to this 
4 HRS § 12-5(d) (2009) provides: "No signatures shall be required
on nomination papers for candidates filing to run in a special primary or
special election to fill a vacancy." 
5 HRS § 17-3(a) concerns any vacancy, the term of which ends at the
next succeeding general election. HRS § 17-3(b) concerns any vacancy, theterm of which does not end at the next succeeding general election. As 
(continued...) 
6 5(...continued)  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
case, HRS § 17-3(b)(3) provides, in relevant part: 
(3) If [a vacancy] occurs after the sixtieth day prior to
the next succeeding primary but not later than on thefiftieth day prior to the next succeeding generalelection, or if there are no qualified candidates forany party or nonpartisan candidates in the primary,the vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term atthe next succeeding general election. The chief election officer shall issue a proclamationdesignating the election for filling the vacancy.Party candidates for the unexpired senate term shallbe nominated by the county committees of the parties
not later than  4:30 p.m. on the fortieth day prior to
the general election; nonpartisan candidates may filenomination papers for the unexpired term not later 
than  4:30 p.m. on the fortieth day prior to the
general election with the nonpartisan candidate who is
to be nominated to be decided by lot, under thesupervision of the chief election officer. The candidates for the unexpired term shall be elected inaccordance with this title. Pending the election, thegovernor shall make a temporary appointment to fillthe vacancy, and the person appointed shall serveuntil the election of the person duly elected to fillthe vacancy. 
(Emphasis added). 
Thus, pursuant to HRS § 17-3(b)(3), candidates for the 
vacant Senate seat must be nominated or file nomination papers 
not later than 4:30 p.m. on the fortieth day prior to the GeneralElection, which the parties agree is September 24, 2020. The parties also agree that Nago is the State official that is responsible for implementing HRS § 17-3(b)(3).  
The parties further agree that, pursuant to HRS § 15D-4 
(Supp. 2019),  Nago is also responsible for implementing HRS 
6
Senator Harimoto's term did not end at the next succeeding general election,
HRS § 17-3(b) applies here.

Chapter 15D, the Uniform Military and Overseas Voters Act, as 
well as its federal counterpart, 42 U.S.C. § 1973ff,  the 
Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. The Uniform Military and Overseas Voters Act was passed by the Hawai# i 
Legislature in 2012. A Senate Standing Committee report explains its purpose: 7
The federal Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee 
Voting Act of 1986 and the Military and Overseas Voter
Empowerment Act of 2009 have not been wholly effective inovercoming the difficulties overseas voters face.Furthermore, these federal laws do not apply to state or 
responsible for implementing this chapter and the State'sresponsibilities under the Uniformed and Overseas CitizensAbsentee Voting Act, 42 U.S.C. section 1973ff et seq.
(b) The chief election officer shall establish an 
electronic transmission system through which a covered votermay apply for and receive voter registration materials,military-overseas ballots, and other information under thischapter. 
The chief election officer may satisfy the
requirements of this chapter by utilizing an electronictransmission system established by the Federal VotingAssistance Program in lieu of creating a separate electronictransmission system.
(c) The chief election officer shall develop
standardized absentee-voting materials, including privacyand transmission envelopes and their electronic equivalents,authentication materials, and voting instructions, to beused with the military-overseas ballot of a voter authorizedto vote in any jurisdiction in this State.
(d) The chief election officer shall accept forms
prescribed by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens AbsenteeVoting Act, 42 U.S.C. section 1973ff et seq., for use by acovered voter [that] contains the prescribed standarddeclaration to swear or affirm specific representationspertaining to the voter's identity, eligibility to vote,status as a covered voter, and timely and proper completionof an overseas-military ballot. 
7 42 U.S.C. § 1973ff has been editorially reclassified and
transferred to 52 U.S.C. § 20302. Previously, in 2009, Congress passed theMilitary and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act, which amended the Uniformed and
Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. § 1973ff, et seq. 
Pub. L. No. 111-84, §§ 577 to 582, 583(a), 584 to 587, 123 Stat. 2190 (2009).
In particular, states are now required by 52 U.S.C. § 20302 to "transmit avalidly requested absentee ballot to an absent uniformed services voter oroverseas voter . . . not later than 45 days before the election" so long asthe absentee ballot request was received at least 45 days before the election.

local elections, which results in states conducting
elections under procedures that vary dramatically from stateto state. The lack of uniformity between jurisdictions andthe non-applicability of federal law complicate efforts toengage voters and represents a major impediment to theability of military personnel and overseas civilians tovote. 
By adopting the Uniform Military and Overseas Voters
Act, this measure addresses these issues by extending theassistance and protections for military and overseas votersunder existing federal law to state elections. This measurealso uniformly applies the military and overseas votingprocess to all covered elections of which the State hasprimary administrative responsibility.  
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2450, in 2012 Senate Journal, at 1020. 
In short, HRS Chapter 15D was intended to provide 
assistance to and protections for uniformed military and other 
overseas voters, by implementing deadlines and procedures to ensure that these voters are not disenfranchised. The Uniform Military and Overseas Voters Act applies to general, special, or 
primary elections for state office, as well as, inter alia, to general, special, or primary elections for federal office. HRS 
§ 15D-3 (Supp. 2019). HRS § 15D-9(a) (Supp. 2019) provides: 
§ 15D-9 Transmission of unvoted ballots.  (a) No 
later than  forty-five days before the election or, if the
forty-fifth day before the election is a weekend or holiday,
no later than  the business day preceding the forty-fifth
day, the election official in each jurisdiction charged with
distributing a ballot and balloting materials shall transmita ballot and balloting materials to all covered voters whoby that date submit a valid military-overseas ballotapplication. 
The parties agree that, pursuant to HRS § 15D-9(a), the 
ballots and balloting materials must be transmitted no later than 
September 18, 2020.  As the parties further agree, if the 8

Overseas Voter Empowerment Act, ballots must be mailed no later than September
19, 2020. 
9 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
candidates' filing deadline remains as September 24, 2020, then 
the Office of Elections will not be able to meet the ballot mailing deadline in HRS § 15D-9(a) or the corresponding deadline under federal law. 
Nago contends that because the Uniform Military and 
Overseas Voters Act, including HRS § 15D-9, was enacted after HRS § 17-3(b)(3), HRS § 15D-9 supersedes any conflicting provisions of HRS § 17-3(b)(3). 
He cites no authority for this proposition, 
but relies on the logic that the Legislature must have been aware of the existing statutory deadlines when it imposed the new ones. Nago further contends that, given his statutory responsibility to implement both HRS § 17-3(b)(3) and HRS § 15D-9, he has the discretion to harmonize the statutes. He submits that it is a reasonable exercise of his discretion to advance the candidate filing deadline for the Senate District 16 vacancy from the latest possible day permitted under HRS § 17-3(b)(3) to September 5, 2020, in order to allow the Office of Elections sufficient time to prepare and furnish the ballots to the City and County of Honolulu, thereby complying with the state and federal laws enacted to assist overseas and military voters and to protect their voting rights. 
The AG argues that for the candidate filing deadline to 
be advanced, the AG must make an application to a court and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief. Implicit in this argument is the AG's disagreement with Nago's contention that the 
10 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
statutory scheme grants Nago the discretion to unilaterally 
advance the candidate filing deadline. 
The AG further argues 
that, under well-established principles of statutory construction, where there is a plainly irreconcilable conflict between a general and a specific statute concerning the same subject matter, the specific statute governs. The AG then submits that the no-later-than-40-days-prior-to-the-election deadline in HRS § 17-3(b)(3) is more specific than the no-later-than-45-days-before-the-election deadline in HRS § 15D-9 and, therefore, HRS § 17-3(b)(3) governs. The AG offers no explanation as to why we should construe the former as more specific than the latter; this argument is not persuasive. 
The AG further argues that HRS § 15D-17 (Supp. 2019) 
authorizes her to bring this action for injunctive or other equitable relief in order to ensure compliance with the Uniform Military and Overseas Voters Act deadline. HRS § 15D-17 provides: 
§ 15D-17 Equitable relief.  A court may issue an
injunction or grant other equitable relief appropriate to
ensure substantial compliance with or enforce this chapteron application by:
(1) A covered voter alleging a grievance under thischapter; or
(2) The attorney general of the State.
No award of attorney fees or costs shall be permitted in anyprivate cause of action initiated under this chapter. 
We begin with Nago's contention that, in light of the 
apparently conflicting statutory scheme and his statutory 
responsibilities, the Legislature must have intended to give him the discretion to harmonize the statutes, as needed, and to 
11 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
advance the candidate filing deadline in this instance. While we 
recognize Nago's supervisory authority and many interrelated 
responsibilities pursuant to, inter alia, HRS Chapters 11 (Elections, Generally) (2009 & Supp. 2019), 15 (Absentee Voting) 
(2009 & Supp. 2019), 15D (Uniform Military and Overseas Voters Act), 16 (Voting Systems) (2009 & Supp. 2019), and 17 (Vacancies) (2009 & Supp. 2019), Nago fails to point to any statutory provision expressly or implicitly granting him such discretion. It may well be that, pursuant to HRS § 11-4 (Supp. 2019)
9 and in 
accordance with HRS Chapter 91 (Hawaii Administrative Procedures Act), Nago may adopt administrative rules to this effect, but Nago points to no such rules, and after reviewing Hawai# i 
Administrative Rules Chapter 3-177 (Rules of the Office of Elections) (effective July 26, 2020), we find none. See generally Green Party of Haw. v. Nago, 138 
Hawai# i 228, 378 P.3d 
944 (2016) (discussing rulemaking requirements and the Office of Elections). Accordingly, we cannot conclude that Nago has the discretion to unilaterally advance the candidate filing deadline for the subject special election from September 24, 2020, to September 5, 2020. 
9 HRS § 11-4 provides: 
§ 11-4 Rules.  The chief election officer may make,
amend, and repeal rules governing elections held under this
title, election procedures, and the selection,establishment, use, and operation of all voting systems nowin use or to be adopted in the State, and all other similarmatters relating thereto as in the chief election officer'sjudgment shall be necessary to carry out this title. 
12 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
 This case nevertheless requires further interpretation 
of HRS §§ 17-3(b)(3), 15D-9(a), and 15D-17. 
The fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself. Where 
the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, thiscourt's sole duty is to give effect to the statute's plainand obvious meaning, which is obtained primarily from thelanguage contained in the statute itself. 
Waters v. Nago, 148 Hawai# i 46, __, 468 P.3d 60, 75 (2019) 
(citation omitted). 
It has long been held that particular 
statutory language must be read in the context of the entire 
statutory scheme and must be construed consistent with the purpose of the statute or statutes. See id.; see also Halstead v. Pratt, 14 Haw. 38, 39 (1902) ("The general rule is that a statute should be construed with reference to the system of laws of which it is a part, unless a contrary intention clearly appears. If this were not so, statutes would often have to be given absurd constructions, for they often do not contain express provisions as to the extent of their operation in this respect."). 
The Hawai# i Legislature has enacted provisions 
governing statutory construction, as well, including: 
§ 1-14 Words have usual meaning.  The words of a law 
are generally to be understood in their most known and usual
signification, without attending so much as to the literaland strictly grammatical construction of the words to theirgeneral or popular use or meaning. 
HRS § 1-14 (2009). 
§ 1-15 Construction of ambiguous context.  Where the 
words of a law are ambiguous: 
(1) The meaning of the ambiguous words may be soughtby examining the context, with which the 
13  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may be
compared, in order to ascertain their truemeaning.
(2) The reason and spirit of the law, and the causewhich induced the legislature to enact it, maybe considered to discover its true meaning.
(3) Every construction which leads to an absurdityshall be rejected. 
HRS § 1-15 (2009). 
§ 1-16 Laws in pari materia.  Laws in pari materia, or
upon the same subject matter, shall be construed withreference to each other. What is clear in one statute maybe called in aid to explain what is doubtful in another. 
HRS § 1-16 (2009). 
HRS §§ 17-3(b)(3) states that party candidates shall be 
nominated by their parties not later than 4:30 p.m. on the 
fortieth day prior to the general election and nonpartisan candidates may file nomination papers not later than 4:30 p.m. on the fortieth day prior to the general election.  The statute is 
unambiguous in its clear prohibition against a later party nomination or a later filing of nomination papers, but it does not expressly prohibit an earlier deadline. See Waters, 148 Hawai
#i at __, 468 P.3d at 78-79 (holding that a similar "not 
later than" provision prohibited the consideration and counting of ballots that were not received by the City Clerk or a designated representative prior to the "not later than" date and 10
10 We note that HRS § 17-3(b)(3) uses the word "shall" with respect
to party candidates and "may" with respect to nonpartisan candidates. Courts 
have frequently struggled with the legislative use of the terms "may" and"shall" in close proximity. See, e.g., Gray v. Admin. Dir. of the Court, 84
Hawai #i 138, 149-50, 931 P.2d 580, 591-92 (1997). However, here, it seems
clear that the distinction refers to who submits the nomination. 
Party

time). 
HRS § 17-3(b)(3) does not, for example, mandate that the 
candidates have "until" the fortieth day prior to the general 
election or otherwise foreclose an earlier deadline. 
HRS § 15D-9(a) similarly states that ballots and 
balloting materials shall be transmitted not later than forty-five days before the election (or the preceding business day, if a weekend or holiday). This statute is equally unambiguous in its clear prohibition against a later transmission of ballots and balloting materials to the subject voters. See Waters, 148 
Hawai# i at __, 468 P.3d at 78-79. As set forth above, the 
Uniform Military and Overseas Voters Act was enacted in 2012 for the specific and express purpose of providing assistance to and protections for uniformed military and other overseas voters, by implementing deadlines and procedures to ensure that these voters are not disenfranchised. 
The not-later-than deadline in HRS 
§ 15D-9(a) is clearly a linchpin in this statutory scheme. 
Perhaps ironically, years earlier, in Act 35 of 1990, 
the Hawai# i Legislature amended the not-later-than date in HRS 
§ 17-3(b)(3) from thirty days prior to the election to forty days prior to the election for the express purpose of complying with federal recommendations for the mailing of absentee ballots, providing statutory consistency for state election laws, and providing election officials with sufficient time to comply with federal guidelines. See H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 542-90, in 1990 
House Journal, at 1044; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2939, in 1990 
15 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Senate Journal, at 1202. However, Congress later amended the 
corresponding federal law to require states to transmit ballots not later than forty-five days before the election. See 52 
U.S.C. § 20302.
11 
The Hawai# i Legislature's clear intent in enacting the 
Uniform Military and Overseas Voters Act in 2012 was to extend the federal protections for the covered voters to Hawai# i state 
elections. 
Thus, notwithstanding any ambiguity in these statutes, 
the overarching "reason and spirit of the law, and the cause which induced the legislature to enact" them lead us to conclude that HRS § 17-3(b)(3) must be interpreted in a manner that gives full effect to the Legislature's intent in enacting HRS § 15D
-
9(a). See HRS §§ 1-15 & 1-16; cf., 
e.g., State v. Keawe, 107 
Hawai# i 1, 5-6, 108 P.3d 304, 308-09 (2005) (interpreting HRS 
§ 803-5 to include a temporal requirement in order to give full effect to the Legislature's intent in enacting HRS § 803-1 and related provisions). We further conclude that the transmission of ballots and balloting materials for the City and County of Honolulu without a complete list of candidates for the special election to fill Senator Harimoto's unexpired term would lead to an absurdity because it would undermine the Legislature's intent

Voting by Absent Uniformed Services Voters and Overseas Voters in Elections

16 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in enacting HRS § 15D-9(a) and potentially disenfranchise persons 
entitled to vote in the special election for Senate District 16. 
While, admittedly, a further amendment to HRS § 17-
3(b)(3) might have provided even greater clarity,12 the 
Legislature did in fact enact HRS § 15D-17 to expressly authorize a court to issue an injunction or grant other equitable relief appropriate to ensure substantial compliance with or to enforce the mandates in HRS Chapter 15D, in this case, HRS § 15D-9(a). As authorized by the Legislature in HRS § 15D-17, the AG has petitioned this court for relief in order to ensure substantial compliance with or to enforce HRS § 15D-9(a). IV. CONCLUSION 
Accordingly, we turn to the parties' requests for 
relief. For the reasons stated above, we decline Nago's request that this court declare that he has the discretion to advance the candidate filing deadline for the special election to fill Senator Harimoto's unexpired term from September 24, 2020, to September 5, 2020. We also decline the AG's request that this court enjoin Nago from enforcing a September 24, 2020 candidate filing deadline for the special election to fill Senator Harimoto's unexpired term. Because Nago has officially proclaimed his intent to accept party nominations and nonpartisan candidate nomination papers at no time later than 4:30 p.m. on

§ 17-3(b)(3) in 2018 and 2020.

court, the requested injunctive relief is unnecessary.13 
Now, therefore, pursuant to the authority provided in

OPINION BY HIRAOKA, J.,
CONCURRING IN PART AND DISSENTING IN PART 
Respectfully, I dissent in part. 
I concur that Nago1 
does not have discretion to unilaterally advance the filing 
dates2 prescribed by HRS § 17-3(b)(3). I also concur that under 
HRS § 15D-17, the ICA may grant the AG's request for equitable relief to clarify directory language in the election statute, in 
this case concerning deadlines for political parties. 
In my view, however, absent a constitutional challenge
3 
we have no authority under HRS § 15D-17 to grant equitable relief 
contrary to the plain and unambiguous mandatory language of HRS 
§ 17-3(b)(3). I would hold that HRS § 17-3(b)(3) mandates that 
nonpartisan candidates be allowed to file nomination papers for 
the Senate District 16 special election until September 24, 2020, 
and that the AG is not correct that such a ruling would result in 
irreparable damage.

Officer are part — is charged to administer and enforce those

Haw. Const. art. V, § 5. In reviewing actions of the 
executive branch: 
The court does not have the function of determining
what should be done, or the latitude to substitute its
appraisals and conclusions for those of the executivebranch. The function of the court . . . is to consider whether there is a showing that proposed executive action iscontrary to law or an abuse of discretion.

constrained by principles of statutory construction. That is 
because "[n]either the courts nor the administrative agencies are 
empowered to rewrite statutes to suit their notions of sound 
public policy where the legislature has clearly and unambiguously

Of particular significance for this case, the 
Hawai# i Supreme Court has stated: 
We cannot change the language of the statute . . . in order
to make it suit a certain state of facts.  We do not 
legislate or make laws. Even where the Court is convinced 
in its own mind that the Legislature really meant andintended something not expressed by the phraseology of the
Act, it has no authority to depart from the plain meaning of
the language used .

Statutory Analysis 
Under HRS § 15D-9, the State must transmit ballots for 
federal, state, and local elections to certain military person
-
nel, spouses, and dependents, and to registered voters living 
outside the United States, "[n]o later than forty-five days 
before the election or, if the forty-fifth day . . . is a weekend 
or holiday, no later than the business day preceding the forty-
fifth day[.]" For the special election to fill the vacancy in 
State Senate District 16 (Special Election), that date is Friday, 
September 18, 2020 (Mailing Date). 
Under HRS § 17-3(b)(3): 
Party candidates for the unexpired senate term shall be
nominated by the county committees of the parties not laterthan 4:30 p.m. on the fortieth day prior to the generalelection; nonpartisan candidates may file nomination papersfor the unexpired term not later than 4:30 p.m. on thefortieth day prior to the general election[.] 
(Underscoring added.) The 40th day before the Special Election 
is September 24, 2020 (Filing Date). 
The Mailing Date is 6 days before the Filing Date. 
According to the parties, Hawai# i election ballots are prepared 
on a county-wide basis. The State requires a minimum of 12 days 
to generate, proof, print, and deliver ballot packages4 to the 
county clerks for mailing. To meet the Mailing Date, given the 12-day lead time, the State must begin preparing ballots by 
September 6, 2020. That is why Nago issued the Proclamation, 
which advanced the filing deadline for party nominees and non-
partisan candidates to September 5, 2020. 
4 Ballot packages for elections by mail include: (1) an official
ballot; (2) a return identification envelope with postage prepaid; (3) a
secrecy envelope or secrecy sleeve; and (4) instructions. HRS § 11-102(a)(Supp. 2019). 
-3-FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Hawai# i Supreme Court has held: 
[T]his court has subscribed to the proposition that, where
the verbs "shall" and "may" are used in the same statute,especially where they are used in close juxtaposition, weinfer that the legislature realized the difference inmeaning and intended that the verbs used should carry withthem their ordinary meanings. Not surprisingly, we havetherefore construed the close proximity of the contrastingverbs "may" and "shall" to require a mandatory effect forthe term "shall." . . . [T]he converse would seem to follow,namely, that the close proximity of the contrasting verbs"may" and "shall" requires a non-mandatory, i.e., adiscretionary, construction of the term "may." 
Gray v. Admin. Dir. of the Court , 84 Hawai# i 138, 149, 931 P.2d 
580, 591 (1997) (cleaned up). In HRS § 17-3(b)(3), the subject 
of the mandatory verb "shall" is "the county committees of the 
[political] parties[.]" The statute mandates that parties 
"shall" nominate their candidates "not later than" the Filing 
Date but, as noted by the majority, "it does not expressly 
prohibit an earlier deadline" for political parties. 
September 5, 2020, is "not later than" September 24, 2020. I 
agree that Nago advancing the filing date — for 
political party 
nominations — to harmonize the conflict between sections 17-3(b)(3) and 15D-9 was not contrary to law. 
However, in HRS § 17-3(b)(3) the subject of the 
permissive verb "may" is "nonpartisan candidates." The statute 
permits — i.e., gives a right to — nonpartisan candidates to file 
nomination papers until the Filing Date.
5 The majority correctly 
observes that the statute does not "mandate that the candidates have 'until' the fortieth day prior to the general election." In 
my view, the legislature's use of the words "may file . . . not 
later than" the stated time and date is the functional equivalent 
of the stating that nonpartisan candidates have "until" that time 
and date to file. I would hold that advancing the filing date

before the Filing Date, the nonpartisan candidate whose name will appear on
the Special Election ballot is to be decided by lot, under the supervision ofthe State's Chief Election Officer. HRS § 17-3(b)(3). 
-4-FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
could deprive a nonpartisan candidate of a right granted by the 
plain language of the statute, and is therefore beyond our 
authority to declare lawful under HRS § 15D-17. 
Injunctive Relief 
The AG seeks an injunction prohibiting Nago from 
enforcing the September 24, 2020 Filing Date, and mandating a 
filing date of September 5, 2020. 
The AG contends that if the 
State cannot know who all of the Special Election candidates will be until the Filing Date, the State will have to mail ballot 
packages that might not list all qualified candidates for the 
Special Election. 
The test for granting or denying injunctive relief has 
three parts: 
(1) whether the plaintiff is likely to prevail on the
merits; (2) whether the balance of irreparable damage favorsthe issuance of a temporary injunction; and (3) whether thepublic interest supports granting an injunction. . . . [T]hemore the balance of irreparable damage favors issuance ofthe injunction, the less the party seeking the injunctionhas to show the likelihood of . . . success on the merits. 
Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. Hous. & Cmty. Dev. Corp. of 
Hawai# i, 117 Hawai# i 174, 211-12, 177 P.3d 884, 921-22 (2008), 
rev'd on other grounds, Hawaii v. Office of Hawaiian Affairs, 556 
U.S. 163 (2009) (cleaned up) (citation omitted). I would deny 
the injunctive relief requested as to a nonpartisan candidate. 
1. The State is not likely to prevail on
the merits against nonpartisan candidates. 
As discussed above, I would hold that the Filing Date 
cannot legally be advanced for any nonpartisan candidates. 
-5-FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2. The State has not 
shown irreparable damage. 
If the State complies with the Mailing Date, and if an 
otherwise qualified nonpartisan candidate files nomination papers 
after the Special Election ballots are prepared, but before the 
Filing Date, the Special Election result could be subject to 
challenge.6 Were that to happen, the potential remedy is pre-
scribed by HRS § 11-174.5 (2009). That statute provides, in relevant part: 
If the judgment [of the supreme court] should be that the
. . . special . . . election was invalid, a certified copythereof shall be filed with the governor, and the governorshall duly call a new election to be held not later than onehundred twenty days after the judgment is filed. 
See Waters v. Nago , 148 Hawai# i 46, 468 P.3d 60 (2019) (inval -
idating special election decided by 22-vote margin where 350 
ballots received by city clerk after poll closure were commingled 
with timely ballots, so that recount excluding invalid votes was 
not possible). 
Barring any other irregularities, no other state, or 
any federal or local, election result would be subject to chal-
lenge. In my opinion, with respect to nonpartisan candidates for 
the Special Election, a plain reading of the statutes at issue 
requires compliance with each. The possible consequence is that 
the Special Election could be held invalid, in which case a new 
special election for Senate District 16 only must be held; 
ballots for the new special election would have to be provided to 
military personnel, spouses, and dependents, and to registered 
voters living outside the United States, who are registered to 
6 Should that situation arise, the Office of Elections may wish to
delay reporting the Senate District 16 election result until after any
challenge to the Special Election is decided, in the event a new specialelection for that district is required. See City & Cty. of Honolulu v. State
,
143 Hawai #i 455, 464, 431 P.3d 1228, 1237 (2018) (noting that "settling such
challenges before the votes are tallied protects the integrity of our mostsacred democratic institutions."). 
-6-FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
vote in Senate District 16 as required by HRS § 15D-9. 
In my 
view, the potential damage caused by the conflicting statutes 
would be inefficient and wasteful, but not irreparable. 
3. The public interest does not
support the requested injunction. 
The AG recognizes that "advancing the . . . Filing 
[Date from September 24, 2020, to September 5, 2020, will] 
require[] that . . . prospective nonpartisan candidates decide 
whether to run for this office 20 days earlier than antici-
pated[.]" Based upon the plain language of HRS § 17-3(b)(3) 
mandating that nonpartisan candidates for special election be 
given until "not later than 4:30 p.m. on the fortieth day prior 
to the general election[,]" I would hold that the injunction 
requested by the AG is contrary to the public interest stated by 
the legislature. 
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, I would hold: (1) HRS 
§ 15D-9 requires that blank Special Election ballots be trans-mitted to certain military personnel, spouses, and dependents, 
and to registered voters living outside the United States, "no 
later than" September 18, 2020; (2) the plain language of HRS 
§ 17-3(b)(3) requires that a nonpartisan candidate "may" file 
nomination papers for the Special Election "not later than 
4:30 p.m. on" September 24, 2020; and (3) if an otherwise 
qualified nonpartisan candidate filed nomination papers for the 
Special Election after ballots are finalized but before the 
September 24, 2020 Filing Date, the Special Election result could 
be subject to challenge; were that to happen, the damage would 
not be irreparable because the potential remedy is prescribed by 
HRS § 11-174.5. I acknowledge that would be wasteful and 
inefficient to effectuate, but it is the result I believe the law 
-7-FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
requires absent an amendment to one or more of the statutes by 
the legislature.
