CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CIVIL NO. 93-3974) 
ORDER DISMISSING CASE FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By:  Leonard, Presiding Judge, Hiraoka and Guidry, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record in CAOT-22-0000491, it 
appears that the court lacks jurisdiction under Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) ยง 602-57(3) (2016) over Plaintiffs-Petitioners 
Benjamin Paul Kekona and Tamae M. Kekona's August 12, 2022 Motion 
for Order or Writ in Aid of Jurisdiction. HRS ยง 602-57(3) grants this court jurisdiction to "make or issue any order or writ necessary or appropriate in the aid of its jurisdiction[.]" The record does not indicate any attempt to appeal from Civil No. 93-3974 having been made. There is nothing for this court to aid under HRS ยง 602-57(3). Cf. State by Off. of Consumer Prot. v. 
Joshua
, 141 Hawai#i 91, 99, 405 P.3d 527, 535 (2017); 
Waikiki v. 
Ho#omaka Village Association of Apartment Owners
, 140 Hawai#i 197, 
398 P.3d 786 (2017). Only the Hawai# i Supreme Court has NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
jurisdiction to issue an original writ to a court of inferior 
jurisdiction. HRS ยง 602-5(3) (2016). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that CAOT-22-0000491 is 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, October 10, 2023.
