IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI I  
TOBIUS DAVIES, Petitioner, v. 
THE HONORABLE SHIRLEY M. KAWAMURA, 
JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, 
STATE OF HAWAII , Respondent Judge, and 
STATE OF HAWAI I, Respondent 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By:   Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Wadsworth, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record in CAOT-24-0000470 and 1CPN-
23-0000022,1 it appears that we lack jurisdiction to grant the 
relief requested in self-represented Petitioner- Appellant Tobius 
Davies' (Davies) July 10, 2024 document, which the court 
construes as a petition for writ of mandamus, "Asking to Remove 
Judge Because My Due Process is Being Violated of No Court 
Hearing/Legal Counsel [sic] Release From Custody" (Petition ). 
Insofar as Davies contends, and the record indicates,
that the Circuit Court of the First Circuit has not yet issued a 
final ruling in Davies' Hawai i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 
Rule 40 proceeding in 1CPN-23-0000022, this court lacks appellate 
jurisdiction.   See Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai i 10, 13, 897 
P.2d 937, 940 (1995) (dismissing appeal because "pursuant to 
[Hawai i Rules of Appellate Procedure] Rule 4(b), an appeal from 
an order denying post-conviction relief must either be filed 
within thirty days after the entry of the order denying the HRPP 
Rule 40 petition or, in the alternative, after the announcement 
        
1   The court takes judicial notice of the record in 1CPN-23-0000022.

but before the entry of the order"); Hawaii Revised Statutes 
ยง 602-5(a)(3) (2016) (stating that only the Hawai i Supreme Court 
has jurisdiction to issue an original writ directed to a court of 
inferior jurisdiction). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal is 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, without prejudice to Davies 
seeking relief in the Hawai i Supreme Court. 
IT
 IS FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions are 
dismissed. 
DATED:   Honolulu, Hawai i, December 10, 2024.
