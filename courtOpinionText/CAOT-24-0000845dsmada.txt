NO. CAOT-24-0000845
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI I
ERIC STROEVE, Petitioner, v.
STATE OF HAWAI I, Respondent
ORDER DISMISSING CASE
(By:  Leonard, Acting Chief Judge, Hiraoka and Guidry, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, the court finds that self-
represented Defendant-Appellant Eric Stroeve's December 27, 2024
"Petition for Writ of Dismissal" does not notice an appeal from a
judgment entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit in
1CPC-21-0000568.  Hawaii Revised Statutes ( HRS) ยง 641-11 (2016). 
Rather, it appears to seek affirmative relief in the nature of a
writ of mandamus and/or writ of habeas corpus, which the Hawai i
Supreme Court has exclusive, original jurisdiction to grant.  HRS
ยง 602-5(a)(3), (4) (2016). 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that case No. CAOT-24-
0000845 is dismissed without prejudice to seeking relief via
petition to the Hawai i Supreme Court.
