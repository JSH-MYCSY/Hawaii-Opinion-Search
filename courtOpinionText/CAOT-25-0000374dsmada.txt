IN  THE  INTERMEDIATE  COURT  OF  APPEALS 
OF  THE  STATE  OF  HAWAI I 
JASON  FLETCHER,  Petitioner,  v 
STATE  OF  HAWAI I,  Respondent. 
ORDER 
(By:  Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka,  Wadsworth,  JJ.) 
Upon  review  of  the  record,  the  court  finds  that  self-
represented  Petitioner  Eric  Fletcher's  (Fletcher)  April  25,  2025 
Petition  Under  28  U.S.C.  ยง  2254  for  Writ  of  Habeas  Corpus  by  a 
Person  in  State  Custody  appears  to  seek  affirmative  relief  in  the 
nature  of  a  federal  petition  for  writ  of  habeas  corpus,  which 
this  court  lacks  jurisdiction  to  decide.   Therefore,  IT  IS  HEREBY 
ORDERED  that  case  No.  CAOT-25-0000374  is  dismissed  for  lack  of 
jurisdiction  without  prejudice  to  Fletcher  seeking  relief  from 
the  appropriate  court  having  jurisdiction.
