ORDER 
(By:   Leonard,  Acting  Chief  Judge,  Hiraoka,   Wadsworth,   JJ.) 
Upon  review  of  the  record,   the  court  finds  that  self-
represented   Petitioner   John  Michael   Wright  Huffman 's  May  16,  2025
 
"Petition  for  Writ  of  Mandamus  (Original  Proceeding)"  does  not 
notice  an  appeal  from  an  appealable  decree,  order,  or  judgment 
entered  by  the  Family  Court  of  the  First  Circuit  in  1FUJ-24-
0000033.   Rather,  it  appears  to  seek  affirmative  relief  in  the 
nature  of  a  writ  of  mandamus,  which  the  Hawai i  Supreme   Court  has 
exclusive,   original   jurisdiction   to  grant.   Hawai
 i  Revised 
Statutes   ยง  602-5(a)(3)   (2016).    Therefore,   IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED 
that  case  No.  CAOT-25-0000408  is  dismissed   for  lack  of 
jurisdiction  without   prejudice  to  Huffman  filing  a  petition   for 
writ  of  mandamus  in  the  Hawai i  Supreme   Court. 
Dated: Honolulu, Hawai i  June 24,  2025.
