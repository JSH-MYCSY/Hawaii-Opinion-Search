IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I 
OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
MARK F. BUCKMAN, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 10-073-8907)
 
ORDER OF PUBLIC CENSURE
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and Duffy, JJ.,
and Intermediate Court of Appeals Chief Judge Nakamura,
assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of the Office of Disciplinary
 
Counsel’s Petition for Issuance of Reciprocal Discipline Notice,
 
our December 8, 2010 Notice and Order, Assistant Disciplinary
 Counsel’s affidavit regarding service of the notice and order,
 Respondent Mark F. Buckman’s lack of response thereto, and the
 record, it appears Respondent Buckman stipulated to, and the
 California State Bar Court imposed a public reproval with
 conditions, upon stipulation of misconduct in two cases wherein
 Respondent Buckman failed "to pay promptly, as requested by a
 client, funds in [his] possession [that] the client was entitled
 to receive," and "to maintain the respect due to the courts of
 justice and judicial officers." It further appears that such
 
conduct merits the substantially equivalent discipline of public
 censure in this jurisdiction. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Buckman is hereby
 
publically censured. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Buckman shall
 
comply with the stipulated conditions imposed by the California
 State Bar Court and shall submit an affidavit of compliance to
 this court, under the case number on this order, after all
 conditions have been met.
