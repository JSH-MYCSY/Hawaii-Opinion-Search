OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
DANILO T. AGUILAR, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 10-070-8904)
 
ORDER OF DISBARMENT
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba and Duffy, JJ.,
and Intermediate Court of Appeals Chief Judge Nakamura,
assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of the Office of Disciplinary 
Counsel’s Petition for Issuance of Reciprocal Discipline Notice, 
our December 22, 2010 Notice and Order, Respondent Danilo T. 
Aguilar’s lack of response to the notice and order, and the 
record, it appears Respondent Aguilar was disbarred by the United 
States District Court for the District of Hawai
'i on November 24, 
2010 after conviction upon 2 counts of money laundering. It further appears Respondent Aguilar was summarily suspended from 
practice by the Supreme Court of Guam on September 10, 2010. It 
further appears that Respondent Aguilar does not maintain a 
practice in this jurisdiction and delaying the effective date of 
this order for thirty days, as provided by Rule 2.16(c) of the 
Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i (RSCH), would 
serve no purpose. Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Danilo T. Aguilar
 
is disbarred, effective upon entry of this order.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, in addition to any other 
requirements for reinstatement imposed by the Rules of the 
Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i, Respondent Aguilar shall 
pay all costs of these proceedings as approved upon timely submission of a bill of costs. 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that Respondent Aguilar shall,
 
within ten (10) days after the date of this order, file with this
 
court an affidavit in full compliance with RSCH Rule 2.16(d). 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
