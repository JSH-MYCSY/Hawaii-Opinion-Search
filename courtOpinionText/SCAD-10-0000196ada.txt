OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THOMAS D. COLLINS, III, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 10-044-8878)
 
ORDER OF PUBLIC CENSURE
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba and Duffy, JJ.,
and Intermediate Court of Appeals Chief Judge Nakamura,
assigned by reason of vacancy) 
This court has received the Disciplinary Boardâ€™s Report 
and Recommendation for the Public Censure of Respondent Thomas D. 
Collins, III. 
In consideration of the report and the 
stipulations in support of the report, it appears that Respondent Collins was convicted of several counts of failure to file state 
income and general excise tax returns and that the convictions 
were entered upon deferred acceptance of guilty and deferred 
acceptance of no contest pleas. Respondent Collins stipulated 
that his failures to file tax returns violated Rule 8.4(a) and 
8.4(b) of the Hawai' i Rules of Professional Conduct. 
Consequently, a public censure is warranted. Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Thomas D. Collins,
 
III, 
is Publicly Censured. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 3, 2011.
