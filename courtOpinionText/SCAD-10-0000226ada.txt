IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I 
OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
JANET CLARE MILLER, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 10-006-8840)
 
ORDER OF SUSPENSION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba and Duffy, JJ.,
and Intermediate Court of Appeals Chief Judge Nakamura,
assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of the Office of Disciplinary 
Counsel’s Petition for Issuance of Reciprocal Discipline Notice, 
our January 3, 2011 Notice and Order, Respondent Janet Clare 
Miller’s response to the petition, Disciplinary Counsel’s reply, 
and the record, it appears Respondent Miller was suspended from 
practice for one year by the Supreme Court of California by order 
filed August 4, 2009, and that enforcement of the California 
suspension order was suspended for two years subject to 
conditions that include a requirement that she take and pass the 
Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam within one year. 
It 
further appears Hawai' i rules do not permit suspension of 
suspension orders and the substantially equivalent discipline in 
this jurisdiction is a suspension for one year, subject to 
fulfillment of the conditions imposed by the Supreme Court of California. It further appears that Respondent Miller does not 
maintain a practice in this jurisdiction and delaying the 
effective date of this order for thirty days, as provided by Rule 
2.16(c) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i 
would serve no purpose. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Miller is
 
suspended from practice in this jurisdiction for one year,
 effective upon entry of this order.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, as a condition of her
 
reinstatement, Respondent Miller must prove compliance with all
 
of the conditions imposed by the California Supreme Court.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, March 9, 2011.
