ORDER OF INTERIM SUSPENSION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama and Duffy, JJ.,
Circuit Judge Chang in place of Acoba, J., recused and
Circuit Judge Kim, in place of Intermediate Court of Appeals
Chief Judge Nakamura, recused)
 
Upon consideration of the Office of Disciplinary
 
Counsel’s petition for the interim suspension of Respondent Frank
 
M.
 Fernandez from the practice of law pursuant to Rule 2.23 of 
the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i (RSCH), 
Respondent Fernandez’s memorandum in response to our order to 
show cause, and the record, it appears Petitioner has presented 
“sufficient evidence demonstrating that an attorney has committed 
a violation of the Hawai' i Rules of Professional Conduct and 
poses a substantial threat of serious harm to the public” and Respondent Fernandez has failed to show good cause as to why his 
license to practice law in this jurisdiction should not be immediately suspended pending the outcome of disciplinary
 
proceedings. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Fernandez is
 
suspended, pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.23(a)(3), pending the outcome
 
of the disciplinary proceedings and until further order of this
 
court. This order is effective upon entry. In view of the fact
 
that some pending complaints date back to 2006, it is the court’s
 
expectation that the investigation will be completed as
 
expeditiously as possible. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this order imposing interim
 
suspension on Respondent Fernandez shall constitute a suspension
 
of Respondent Fernandez for purposes of RSCH Rule 2.16, and
 
Respondent Fernandez shall comply with the requirements of that
 
rule.
 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that the Clerk shall forthwith
 
distribute a copy of this order to all judges. Distribution may
 
be by electronic mail.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, April 18, 2011.
