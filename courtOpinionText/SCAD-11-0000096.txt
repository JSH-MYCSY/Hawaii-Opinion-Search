OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
GARY L. HARTMAN, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 05-130-8282, 05-146-8298,06-118-8458,
07-018-8478, 10-003-8837, 10-007-8841)
 
ORDER OF SUSPENSION 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy and McKenna, JJ.) 
We have considered the Disciplinary Board’s Report and 
Recommendation to suspend Respondent Gary L. Hartman from the 
practice of law in light of the record, the stipulations of the 
parties, and Respondent Hartman’s lack of objection as exhibited 
by his failure to request briefing as permitted by Rule 2.7(d) of 
the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i (RSCH). 
It appears Respondent Hartman neglected clients’ cases, took unearned fees, did not maintain trust accounts and books and 
records required by our rules, did not comply with court orders, 
and did not cooperate with the disciplinary investigations that 
resulted from the complaints of his clients and the report of 
payments against insufficient funds in trust accounts. 
Respondent Hartman’s misconduct resulted in multiple violations of Hawai' i Rules of Professional Conduct Rules 1.15(a)(1), 
1.15(b), 1.15(c), 1.15(d), 1.15(g), 1.3, 8.1(b), 8.4(a) and 
8.4(d). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Hartman is
 
suspended from the practice of law in this jurisdiction for one
 
year and one day, effective 30 days after entry of this order as
 
provided by RSCH Rule 2.16(c).
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Hartman shall
 
comply with the requirements of RSCH Rule 2.16 and shall pay such
 
costs, if any, as are subsequently assessed upon timely
 
submission of Disciplinary Counsel’s verified bill of costs.
