IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
EARLE A. PARTINGTON, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 10-079-8913)
 
ORDER OF CLARIFICATION
 
(By: 
Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Duffy, and
McKenna, JJ., and Intermediate Court of Appeals
Chief Judge Nakamura, in place of Acoba, J., recused)
 
Upon consideration of the record, it appears the 
November 21, 2011 Order Suspending Imposition of Discipline is 
unclear as to when (1) the November 9, 2011 Order of Suspension 
is effective and (2) the affidavit of compliance required by the 
Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai 'i Rule 2.16(d) 
must be filed. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that as the result of the
 
November 21, 2011 Order Suspending Imposition of Discipline, the
 30-day suspension of Respondent Partington from the practice of
 
law in this jurisdiction that was imposed by the November 9, 2011
 
Order of Suspension shall take effect on January 2, 2012, and 
that Respondent Partington must therefore file the affidavit of 
compliance by January 12, 2012. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, December 12, 2011.
