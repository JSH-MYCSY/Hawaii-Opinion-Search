'I 
OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
TERRIE CHUN, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 11-031-8955)
 
ORDER OF DISBARMENT
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the Office of Disciplinary 
Counsel’s petition for issuance of a reciprocal discipline notice 
to Respondent Terrie Chun, the memorandum, affidavit, and 
exhibits appended thereto, and the record, it appears the Supreme 
Court of California disbarred Respondent Terrie Chun from the 
practice of law in that state on July 30, 2009; this court, on 
June 1, 2011, issued a notice and order requiring Respondent 
Chun, in accordance with Rule 2.15(c) of the Rules of the Supreme 
Court of the State of Hawai
'i (RSCH), to show cause as to why the 
same or substantially equivalent discipline should not be imposed in the State of Hawai' i; service of this court’s notice and order 
is deemed effective June 2, 2011; and Respondent Chun has not appeared or shown cause as to why such discipline should not be 
imposed. It further appears that Respondent Chun is not within 
the State of Hawai' i and that making this disbarment order 
effective 30 days after its entry as provided by RSCH Rule 2.1(c)  
 would serve no purpose. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.15(c), 
that Respondent Chun is disbarred from the practice of law in the 
State of Hawai' i, effective upon entry of this order. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, in addition to any other 
requirements for reinstatement imposed by the Rules of the 
Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i, Respondent Chun shall pay 
all costs of these proceedings as approved upon timely submission of a bill of costs and an opportunity to respond thereto, as 
prescribed by RSCH Rule 2. 
DATED: 
Honolulu, Hawai' i, July 19, 2011.
