(ODC 07-177-8637)
 
ORDER OF SUSPENSION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the Disciplinary Boardâ€™s Report 
and Recommendation for the Suspension of Respondent Richard 
Hacker, and upon full consideration of all the evidence in the 
record and the transcripts of the disciplinary hearings, it 
appears that Respondent Hacker falsified two letters that were 
material to a lawsuit pending against him and presented them to 
opposing counsel as authentic, fraudulently misrepresented his 
financial assets to a federal bankruptcy court for personal 
benefit, violated his professional duty of diligence and 
competence to a client in the underlying divorce matter, and has 
demonstrated a pattern of misconduct before tribunals in 
violation of Rules 1.1, 1.4(a), 3.4(b), 8.4(a) and (c) of the 
Hawai'i Rules of Professional Conduct. Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Hacker is
 
suspended from the practice of law in this jurisdiction for a 
period of five years, effective 30 days from entry of this order, 
as provided by Rule 2.16(c) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of 
the State of Hawai' i. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, in addition to any other 
requirements for reinstatement imposed by the Rules of the 
Supreme Court of the State of Hawai
'i, Respondent Hacker shall 
pay all costs of these proceedings as approved upon timely submission of a bill of costs. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Hacker shall, 
within ten (10) days after the date of this order, file with this 
court an affidavit in full compliance with Rule 2.16(d) of the 
Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, August 16, 2011.
