IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
B. LADD M. UEOKA, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 09-066-8789)
 
ORDER OF PUBLIC CENSURE
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the Report and Recommendation of 
the Disciplinary Board of the Hawai' i Supreme Court, the 
stipulated facts, and the evidence in the record, it appears that 
Respondent B. Ladd M. Ueoka negligently breached client 
confidences and failed to ensure the staff of his law offices 
complied with the professional duties of confidentiality, in 
violation of the Hawai' i Rules of Professional Conduct (HRPC) 
Rules 1.6, 5.3(b), 5.3(c) and 8.4(a). It further appears that Respondent Ueoka initially failed to cooperate with the Office of 
Disciplinary Counselâ€™s investigation into the matter, in 
violation of HRPC Rule 8.1(b), 8.4(a), and 8.4(d), requiring the 
issuance of a subpoena to secure cooperation, and that Respondent 
Ueoka has three prior informal admonitions on his record, two for 
failing to cooperate with Office of Disciplinary Counsel investigations. Therefore, it appearing that Public Censure is
 
warranted,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent B. Ladd M. Ueoka
 
is Publicly Censured.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Ueoka shall pay 
all costs of the proceedings as approved upon timely submission 
of a bill of costs as prescribed by the Rules of the Supreme 
Court of the State of Hawai
'i Rule 2.3. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
