ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 11-039-8963)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.
and Intermediate Court of Appeals Chief Judge Nakamura,
in place of Acoba, J., recused)
 
Upon consideration of the petition filed by the Office 
of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC), the exhibits and affidavits 
attached thereto, the Notice of Reciprocal Discipline issued 
pursuant to the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of 
Hawai'i (RSCH) Rule 2.15(b) on November 22, 2011 by the Supreme 
Court of the State of Hawai' i, the affidavit of service filed by 
1
ODC on January 10, 2012 ,  and the record, it appears the 
January 10, 2012 affidavit of service, the ODC’s transmittal
 memo, and the attached exhibit indicating the appearance of the
 
envelope containing the Notice of Reciprocal Discipline and the
 
1
 We note it appears the certificate of service filed with the
 
January 10, 2012 affidavit is defective, as it does not state that service was
executed, but only that the documents “will be served” upon Respondent Shea.
            
         
           
             
           
         
           
           
      Alaska Disciplinary Order mailed on November 28, 2011 all bear an 
address different from the address Respondent Shea registered 
with the Hawai' i State Bar Association (HSBA); to wit, 329 F 
Street, Suite 2222, Anchorage, Alaska, whereas Respondent Shea’s registered address is Suite 222.
2 Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that ODC shall file with the
 
Supreme Court a certificate of service or a declaration of its
 
attempts to serve Respondent Shea a copy of the November 22, 2011
 
Notice of Reciprocal Discipline and a certified copy of the
 
Alaska Disciplinary Order by certified mail, pursuant to RSCH
 
Rules 2.11 and 2.17(d)(1), at the address currently registered
 
with the HSBA.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 26, 2012.

 It also appears, according to the affidavit of Deputy Chief
 
Disciplinary Counsel Charlene Norris and the ODC’s internal transmittal memo,
that ODC’s October 24, 2011 initial service of its petition upon Respondent
Shea was also to the incorrect address, to wit Suite 2222, though the actual
envelope bore the correct address. It further appears, according to Norris’s
affidavit and the ODC’s internal transmittal memo, that ODC’s subsequent
October 25, 2011 service of the same documents, bearing the JIMS system’s
electronic filing stamp, were also sent to the same incorrect address, though
the envelope bore the correct address.
