OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
WEVLEY WILLIAM SHEA, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 11-039-8963)
 
ORDER OF SUSPENSION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.
and Intermediate Court of Appeals Chief Judge Nakamura,
in place of Acoba, J., recused)
 
Upon consideration of the petition filed by the Office 
of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC), the exhibits and affidavits 
attached thereto, the Notice of Reciprocal Discipline issued 
pursuant to Rule 2.15(b) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the 
State of Hawai
'i (RSCH), the affidavit of service filed by ODC on 
April 18, 2012 and the record, it appears that, on May 18, 2011, the Supreme Court of the State of Alaska entered an order 
suspending Respondent Wevley William Shea from the practice of 
law for a period of 25 months and subjected Shea to other 
conditions necessary for his reinstatement, to wit that he comply 
with Alaska Bar Rules 2, Section 1(d) and 29(c)(1), and that he 
provide evidence from a psychologist or psychiatrist that he is 
mentally fit to return to the practice of law. In light of the 
fact Respondent Shea was not in the State of Hawai' i, we allowed ODC to serve documents required by RSCH Rule 2.15(b) upon
 
Respondent Shea by certified mail, pursuant to RSCH Rules 2.11. 
Such service was complete on February 2, 2012. It further
 
appears Respondent Shea did not file a response addressing why
 
the imposition of the same or substantially equivalent discipline
 
would be unwarranted. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Wevley William
 
Shea is suspended from the practice of law in this jurisdiction
 
for 25 months, effective 30 days after entry of this order, as
 
provided by RSCH Rule 2.16(c).
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, in addition to the
 
requirements set out in RSCH Rules 2.16 and 2.17, Respondent
 
Sheaâ€™s reinstatement is contingent upon proof of his
 
reinstatement to the Alaska Bar.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, May 1, 2012.
