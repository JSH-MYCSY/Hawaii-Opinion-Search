IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I 
OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
DENNIS D. NISHIMURA, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 05-138-8290)
 
ORDER ALLOWING RESIGNATION IN LIEU OF DISCIPLINE
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the Office of Disciplinary 
Counsel (ODC)’s “Petition for Order Granting Request of Dennis D. 
Nishimura to Resign From the Practice of Law in Lieu of 
Discipline” and the memorandum, affidavits, and exhibits in 
support thereof, it appears the Petition is supported by 
Respondent Nishimura’s affidavit and the affidavit meets the 
requirements of Rule 2.14(a) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of 
the State of Hawai
'i (RSCH). In sum, Nishimura admits to failing 
to properly advance a client matter, failing to communicate with a client, depositing unearned client funds in a general business 
account, resulting in misappropriation of those funds, failing to 
maintain unearned deposits in a client trust account until 
earned, failing to return unearned client funds promptly upon 
request of a client, improperly negotiating with a client for the client to withdraw an ODC complaint, arranging to have an 
individual in Nishimura’s employ open a business account in the 
employee’s name in order to facilitate Nishimura’s efforts to 
hide assets from the State of Hawaii’s Department of Taxation, 
failing to properly maintain and manage his client trust 
accounts; and providing inadequate cooperation to the ODC during 
its subsequent investigations into his actions, in violation of 
Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.15(a)(1), 1.15(a)(2), 1.15(c), 1.15(d), 
1.15(f)(3), 1.15(f)(4), 1.16(d), 3.2, 8.1(b), 8.3(d)(2)(ii), 
8.4(a), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d) of the Hawai' i Rules of Professional 
Conduct. It further appears that Respondent Nishimura’s behavior included multiple acts of misappropriation and that any 
reinstatement must be predicated upon full restitution of all 
misappropriated money. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.14, that
 
the petition is granted and Respondent Dennis D. Nishimura’s
 
request to resign in lieu of discipline is granted.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED the request to make this order
 
effective February 28, 2012 is denied. This order is effective
 
30 days after entry, as provided by RSCH Rules 2.14(d) and
 
2.16(c).
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any reinstatement is
 
conditioned upon proof that Respondent Nishimura has made full
 
restitution of all misappropriated monies.
 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that (1) the Clerk shall remove
 
Respondent Dennis D. Nishimura’s name from the role of attorneys
 
licensed to practice law in this jurisdiction and (2) within
 
thirty (30) days after entry of this order, Respondent Nishimura
 
shall submit to the Clerk of this court the original certificate
 
2
 evidencing his license to practice law in this jurisdiction. 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that (1) Respondent Nishimura 
shall comply with the requirements of RSCH Rule 2.16 and (2) the 
Disciplinary Board shall publish the notice of disbarment, as 
required by RSCH Rule 2.16(e), and provide notice to all judges 
of the State of Hawai' i, as required by RSCH Rule 2.16(f).

Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 17, 2012.
