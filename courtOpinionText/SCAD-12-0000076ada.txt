ORDER ALLOWING RESIGNATION IN LIEU OF DISCIPLINE
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the Office of Disciplinary 
Counsel (ODC)’s 
“Petition for Order Granting Request of 
Ronald D.S. Lau to Resign From the Practice of Law in Lieu of 
Discipline” and the memorandum, affidavits, and exhibits in 
support thereof, it appears the Petition is supported by 
Respondent Lau’s affidavit and the affidavit meets the 
requirements of Rule 2.14(a) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of 
the State of Hawai' i (RSCH). In sum, Lau admits to failing to 
act with reasonable diligence in representing clients, failing to keep clients reasonably informed about the status of their 
matters and promptly complying with their reasonable requests for 
information, attempting to improperly settle a claim against him 
for malpractice by not first advising the former client in writing that independent representation was appropriate, 
misappropriating client funds, improperly transferring funds out 
of his client trust account electronically, failing to provide 
clients with appropriate accountings concerning their advance 
fees, failing to return promptly to clients their files and 
unearned fees upon termination of the representation, and failing 
to cooperate with ODC during its subsequent investigations into 
his actions, in violation of Rules 1.3, 1.4, 1.8(h), 1.15(c), 
1.15(d), 1.15(e), 1.15(f)(3), 1.15(f)(4), 1.16(d), 8.1(b), 
8.4(a), and 8.4(d) of the Hawai' i Rules of Professional Conduct. 
It further appears that Respondent Lau’s behavior included misappropriation of client funds and that any reinstatement must 
be predicated upon full restitution of all misappropriated money. 
It also appears that Respondent Lau has been suspended since 
November 24, 2010, pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.12A. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.14, that
 
the petition is granted and Respondent Ronald D.S. Lau’s request
 
to resign in lieu of discipline is granted.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the resignation is effective
 
30 days after the date of this order, as provided by RSCH Rules
 
2.14(d) and 2.16(c).
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that reinstatement is conditioned
 
upon proof that Respondent Lau has made full restitution of all
 
misappropriated monies.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that (1) the Clerk shall remove
 
Respondent Ronald D.S. Lau’s name from the role of attorneys
 
licensed to practice law in this jurisdiction and (2) within
 
thirty (30) days after entry of this order, Respondent Lau shall
 
submit to the Clerk of this court the original certificate
 
evidencing his license to practice law in this jurisdiction. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that (1) Respondent Lau shall
 
comply with the requirements of RSCH Rule 2.16 and (2) the
 
2
 Disciplinary Board shall provide notice to the judges, as
 
required by RSCH Rule 2.16(f), but Respondent Lau having been on
 
interim suspension since November 24, 2010, the Disciplinary
 
Board need not publish the notice of disbarment that would
 
otherwise have been required by RSCH Rule 2.16(e).
 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that Respondent Lau shall pay to
 
the Disciplinary Board all costs associated with these
 
proceedings.
