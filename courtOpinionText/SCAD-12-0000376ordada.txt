ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
  
(ODC 07-172-8632, 08-004-8647, 09-016-8739, 09-017-8740,
09-085-8808, 09-087-8810, 09-088-8811, 09-089-8812, 09-090-8813)
 
ORDER OF DISBARMENT
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and McKenna, JJ.,
and Intermediate Court of Appeals Associate Judge Fujise,
in place of Pollack, J., recused)
 
Upon consideration of the Disciplinary Board’s report
 
and recommendation to disbar Respondent Frank M. Fernandez, the
 
briefs filed by Respondent Fernandez and the Office of
 
Disciplinary Counsel (ODC), and upon full consideration of all
 
the evidence in the record, this court reaches the following
 
findings and conclusions by clear and convincing evidence;
 
specifically, that
 
Respondent Fernandez was aware Rule 1.15(d) of the 
Hawai
'i Rules of Professional Conduct (HRPC) states all fees are 
refundable until earned and was further aware legal fees are earned through the provision of legal services. 
In ODC Case No. 09-088-8811, Fernandez did not contact
 Ginger Davids for documents necessary for the filing of a
 
lawsuit, despite the fact he was in contact with her sister, and
 
despite the fact the Davids’ contact information did not change
 
during the period of representation. Fernandez did not keep the
 
Davids apprised of the status of the case, allowed the statute of
 
limitations to expire, and never in fact filed a lawsuit. In
 
doing so, he violated HRPC Rule 1.2(a) (“[a] lawyer shall abide
 
by a client’s decisions concerning the objectives of
 
representation, . . . and shall consult with the client as to the
 
means by which the objectives are to be pursued”), Rule 1.3 (“A
 
lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in
 
representing a client”), Rule 1.4(a) (“a lawyer shall keep a
 
client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and
 
promptly comply with reasonable requests for information”) and
 
Rule 1.4(b) (“[a] lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent
 
reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed
 
decisions regarding the representation”). By failing to provide
 
the Davids with a satisfactory accounting of the $1,500.00 in
 
client funds, failing to inform the Davids of the termination of
 
the representation, to return files, or to provide a refund of
 
the $120.00 filing fee until the instigation of the disciplinary
 
proceedings, Fernandez violated HRPC Rule 1.15(f)(3) (providing a
 
right to an accounting of funds earned) and Rule 1.16(d)
 
(requiring the attorney to terminate representation with the
 
client’s interests in mind, including refunding unearned fees and
 
returning client files). 
In ODC Case No. 09-089-8812, by arranging to serve as
 
both attorney and bail bondsman to Jennifer Garcia, Fernandez
 
instigated a non-waivable conflict of interest that violated HRPC
 
Rule 1.7(b) (“[a] lawyer shall not represent a client if the
 
representation of that client may be materially limited . . . by
 
the lawyer's own interests”) and engaged in a business
 
transaction with a client related to the representation, in
 
2
 violation of HRPC Rule 1.8(a). 
By attempting to secure Bruce Toyoshiba’s waiver of his
 
right to an accounting and to a refund of unearned fees,
 
Fernandez violated HRPC Rules 1.15(d) (“[a]ll fee retainers are
 
refundable until earned), Rule 1.15(f)(3) and Rule 8.4(c) (“It is
 
professional misconduct for a lawyer to . . . engage in conduct
 
involving dishonesty . . . deceit or misrepresentation”). 
In ODC Case No. 09-090-8813, by serving as both Larry
 
Souza’s attorney and bail bondsman, and by failing to inform
 
Souza of the conflict of interest inherent in that practice,
 
Fernandez violated HRPC Rules 1.4(b), 1.7(b), and 1.8(a). By
 
attempting to secure from Souza a waiver of Souza’s right to an
 
accounting and a refund of unearned fees, Fernandez violated HRPC
 
Rules 1.15(d), 1.15(f)(3), and 8.4(c). By failing to respond to
 
Souza’s inquiries, failing to seek Souza’s prior consent to a
 
substitution of attorneys at the hearings, and for securing
 
continuances without consulting with Souza, Fernandez violated
 
HRPC Rules 1.2(a), 1.3, 1.4(a) and 1.4(b). 
In ODC Case No. 09-087-8810, by attempting to secure
 
from Charles Martin a waiver of Martin’s right to an accounting
 
and a refund of unearned fees, Fernandez violated HRPC Rules
 
1.15(d), 1.15(f)(3), and 8.4(c). By failing to inform Martin of
 
the status of his cases, Fernandez violated HRPC Rule 1.4(a). By
 
misrepresenting in written communications with ODC the hearings
 
Fernandez attended on Martin’s behalf, Fernandez violated HRPC
 
Rule 8.1(a) (“a lawyer in connection with . . . a disciplinary
 
matter, shall not . . . knowingly make a false statement of
 
material fact”). By failing to maintain any financial records
 
regarding the monies received from Martin and how they were
 
disbursed, Fernandez violated HRPC Rule 1.15(f)(3).
 
In ODC Case No. 07-172-8632, Fernandez never filed a
 
proper motion for supervised release or reduced bail, but rather
 
filed a single ex parte motion that was summarily denied. His
 
3
   actions violated his duties under HRPC Rule 1.3 to diligently
 
pursue the purpose of the representation. By misrepresenting to
 
Michael Respicio over the course of two months the cause for the
 
delay in Respicio’s case, Fernandez violated HRPC Rules 1.4(a),
 
1.4(b) and 8.4(c). By failing to maintain records regarding the
 
payments made by Respicio and the disbursement of those funds,
 
Fernandez violated HRPC Rule 1.15(f)(3). By attempting to secure
 
a waiver of Respicio’s right to a refund of unearned fees,
 
Fernandez violated HRPC Rules 1.15(d) and 8.4(c).
 
In ODC Case No. 08-004-8647, Fernandez, by
 
misrepresenting to Patience Nwanna that Bruce DeLeon, a paralegal
 
in his office was, in fact, an attorney, or that he had co­
counseled with attorney Michael Nauyokas on federal employment
 
matters, violated HRPC Rule 8.4(c). By accepting the full flat
 
fee from Nwanna for his personal use and benefit, failing to
 
accomplish the objective of the representation – the filing of a
 
lawsuit for defamation against her employers – and failing to
 
subsequently refund any of the flat fee, Fernandez violated HRPC
 
Rules 1.15(c) (“[a] lawyer in possession of any funds . . .
 
belonging to a client . . . , where such possession is incident
 
to the lawyer's practice of law, is a fiduciary and shall not
 
commingle such funds . . . with his . . . own or misappropriate
 
such funds . . . to his . . . own use and benefit”), 1.15(d), and
 
1.16(d) (“[u]pon termination of representation, a lawyer shall
 
take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a
 
client’s interests, such as . . . refunding any advance payment
 
of fee that has not been earned”). By attempting to secure a
 
waiver from Nwanna of her right to an accounting and a refund of
 
unearned fees, and by providing a deficient accounting, Fernandez
 
violated HRPC Rules 1.15(d), 1.15(f)(3) and 8.4(c). 
By representing to Nwanna he was familiar with federal
 
employment litigation when the record demonstrates he was not and
 
by subsequently failing to educate himself on the required
 
4
 knowledge, Fernandez violated HRPC Rules 1.1 (competence) and
 
8.4(c). By failing to heed Nwanna’s instructions as to the
 
purpose of the litigation and instead pursuing a discrimination
 
claim after Nwanna informed him she had waived her right to such
 
a claim, by failing to communicate with her during his pursuit of
 
that strategy, and by ultimately drafting a one-sentence
 
defamation claim for state district court, Fernandez violated
 
HRPC Rules 1.1, 1.2(a), 1.4(a), and 1.4(b). 
In ODC Case No. 09-016-8739, we note that, in response
 
to ODC inquiries seeking justification of the $10,000.00 in fees
 
he had received, Fernandez informed ODC he represented R.J. at
 
several hearings, including hearings held on May 15, June 19,
 
June 26, and June 30, 2008 which he, in fact, did not attend. By
 
misrepresenting facts to ODC in the course of its investigation,
 
Fernandez violated HRPC Rule 8.1(a). By improperly attempting to
 
secure from the Hams a waiver of their right to a refund of
 
unearned fees, Fernandez violated HRPC Rules 1.15(d) and 8.4(c). 
By relying on a unilaterally imposed rate of $250.00 an hour to
 
justify his $10,000.00 fee, imposed without consultation with the
 
Hams and announced only after a dispute arose concerning the fee,
 
Fernandez violated HRPC Rule 1.5(b) (“When the lawyer has not
 
regularly represented the client, the basis or rate of the fee
 
shall be communicated to the client, preferably in writing,
 
before or within a reasonable time after commencing the
 
representation”). Furthermore, by failing to safeguard the funds
 
in the client trust account once a dispute arose concerning the
 
fee, but instead employing them for his own use and benefit,
 
Fernandez violated HRPC Rule 1.15(c) (“[if] the right of the
 
lawyer . . . to receive the funds is disputed by the client, . .
 
. the disputed portion shall not be withdrawn until the dispute
 
is finally resolved”). By failing to maintain records sufficient
 
to provide an accurate accounting of the nature and duration of
 
the work performed, Fernandez violated HRPC Rule 1.15(f)(3). For
 
5
 failing to research court records to determine what other
 
convictions, pending charges or probationer status might affect
 
his efforts to reduce his client’s $1,000,000.00 bail, and for
 
denying it was his duty to do so, Fernandez violated HRPC Rules
 
1.1, 1.2(a), and 1.3. By failing to reasonably communicate with
 
his client during his client’s incarceration, Fernandez violated
 
HRPC Rule 1.4(a).
 
In ODC Case No. 09-017-8740, for agreeing to a 
contingency fee arrangement but failing to reduce the agreement 
to writing, Fernandez violated HRPC Rule 1.5(c). For failing to 
keep Phillip apprised of Fernandez’s purported efforts to 
overturn Phillip’s previous convictions, Fernandez’s appeals of 
the subsequent denials, and Fernandez’s purported appeal to the 
Governor of the State of Hawai' i for clemency, Fernandez violated 
HRPC Rules 1.4(a) and (b). By improperly attempting to secure from Phillip’s wife a waiver of her right to an refund, Fernandez 
violated HRPC Rule 1.15(d) and 8.4(c). By failing to maintain 
financial records or to provide an accurate accounting of work 
done in his representation of Phillip sufficient to justify the 
$8,000.00 in fees, Fernandez violated HRPC Rule 1.15(f)(3). 
In ODC 09-085-8808, by agreeing to the representation
 
of Durant Sirom without informing Sirom or his father of the
 
clear conflict of interest of his existing representation of
 
Sirom’s cousin, Fernandez violated HRPC Rule 1.4(b). By
 
improperly attempting to compel Sirom’s father to waive his right
 
to a refund, Fernandez violated HRPC Rules 1.15(d) and 8.4(c). 
By failing to provide a detailed accounting of the hours spent on
 
the Sirom matter sufficient to justify an asserted total billing
 
of $10,000.00, Fernandez violated HRPC Rule 1.15(f)(3). For
 
later asserting a unilaterally imposed rate of $250.00 an hour to
 
justify his fee, without first consulting with his client,
 
Fernandez violated HRPC Rule 1.5(b).
 
In aggravation, we find Fernandez had two previous
 
6
 informal reprimands imposed upon him, a dishonest and selfish
 
motive, a pattern of misconduct extending over at least nine
 
different client matters, multiple offenses in all cases before
 
the court, a refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his
 
conduct toward his clients and their funds, substantial
 
experience in the practice of law, and an indifference to making
 
restitution. In mitigation, we note the delay in convening
 
disciplinary proceedings, but also note that the lack of records
 
maintained by Respondent Fernandez equally contributed to
 
evidentiary challenges present in the matters at hand. 
Therefore, disbarment being an appropriate sanction, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Frank M. Fernandez 
is disbarred from the practice of law in the State of Hawai' i 
effective thirty days after the entry of this order. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Fernandez shall, 
in accordance with Rule 2.16(d) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i (RSCH), file with this court within 10 
days after the effective date of his disbarment, an affidavit showing compliance with RSCH Rule 2.16(d) and this order. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, as a condition of
 
reinstatement, in addition to any requirements imposed pursuant
 
to RSCH Rules 2.3, 2.16, and 2.17, Respondent Fernandez shall pay
 
all costs of these proceedings as approved upon the timely
 
submission of a bill of costs and an opportunity to respond
 
thereto, as prescribed by RSCH Rule 2.3(c).
