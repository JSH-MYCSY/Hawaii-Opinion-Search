OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
WING C. NG, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 09-002-8725)
 
ORDER OF SUSPENSION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and McKenna, JJ.
and Intermediate Court of Appeals Associate Judge Ginoza,
assigned by reason of vacancy) 
Upon consideration of the Report and Recommendation of 
the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of the State of 
Hawai'i, the briefs submitted by Respondent Wing C. Ng and the 
Office of Disciplinary Counsel, and the record, this court finds 
by clear and convincing evidence, after de novo review of the 
entire record, see Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Breiner, 89 
Hawai'i 167, 171, 969 P.2d 1285, 1289 (1999), Respondent Ng filed 
the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding and the adversarial 
proceeding in United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of 
Hawai'i for the improper purpose of delaying ongoing litigation 
in federal court in California, in light of the timing, effect, and underlying details of the petition. See  In re Silberkraus,
 
336 F.3d 864, 868 (9th
  Cir. 2003) (“‘[C]ourts may infer the
purpose of a filing from the consequences of a pleading or
 
motion’”) (quoting In re Start the Engines, Inc.  219 B.R. 264,
 
270 (Bankr.C.D. Cal. 1998)). The court further finds Respondent
 
Ng was inexperienced in bankruptcy law at the time of the filing. 
The court further finds, however, that, upon the dismissal of the
 
Chapter 11 petition and the related adversarial proceedings,
 
Respondent Ng was on notice of Judge Faris’s rulings that (1) the
 
dispute underlying the alleged tax liabilities and ownership of
 
the implicated assets was between two parties, (2) while the
 
bankruptcy court has, by statute, authority to address tax
 
liabilities, it was not the appropriate venue to address either
 
the question of tax liabilities or ownership of the underlying
 
assets, particularly as those issues were being capably addressed
 
by the federal litigation in California, and (3) consequently
 
Judge Faris viewed the filing of bankruptcy petitions in his
 
court, having as their nexus the two parties, the underlying
 
assets, and the ownership of those assets, as bad faith attempts
 
to further delay the California litigation. This court finds,
 
therefore, Ng’s filing of the Chapter 7 petition as (1) a bad
 
faith attempt to further delay the California litigation, (2) in
 
light of the bankruptcy court’s previous rulings, as a failure by
 
Respondent Ng to comprehend the functioning of the judicial
 
process and a failure to competently represent his client, and
 
(3) brought with the intent to unduly burden and harass the
 
opposing party in the California litigation by frivolously
 
2
 increasing the cost and difficulty of litigation, in violation of 
Rules 1.1, 3.1, and 4.4 of the Hawai' i Rules of Professional 
Conduct (HRPC). See Matter of Burns , 657 N.E.2d 738, 739 
(Indiana, 1995); In re Comfort, 159 P.3d 1011, 1020 (Kansas, 
2007); In re Disciplinary Action Against Plunkett, 432 N.W.2d 
454, 455 (Minn. 1988); In re Snyder, 35 S.W.3d 380, 385 (Mo. 
2000). This court further finds (1) the continued filing of 
documents by Respondent Ng in the appeal of the dismissal of the 
Chapter 7 petition after Respondent Ng unequivocally no longer 
represented the petitioner and, hence, lacked standing to file 
such documents, (2) his continued failure to understand the 
implications of his conduct, and (3) his appeal to the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit of the finding by 
the United States District Court for the District of Hawai' i that 
his appeal of the Chapter 7 petition’s dismissal was frivolous and lacked merit, violated HRPC Rules 1.1 and 3.1. We further 
find Respondent Ng’s failure to understand, in the instant 
disciplinary proceedings, despite being so informed in writing by 
the Disciplinary Board, that he had the right to call expert 
witnesses to testify in his defense and, instead, his continued 
insistence that the absence of tax or other financial experts at 
the disciplinary hearing was not of his own making but the fault 
of the Board, is the incompetent practice of law, in violation of 
HRPC Rule 1.1. See In re W.D.P., 104 Hawai' i 435, 438, 91 P.3d 
1078, 1081 (2004). 
In aggravation, this court finds Respondent Ng has
 
committed multiple ethical violations and refuses to acknowledge
 
3
 the wrongful nature of his conduct. In mitigation, we note the
 
absence in the record of any prior discipline against Ng. 
Therefore, it appearing that suspension is appropriate,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Ng is suspended 
from the practice of law in this jurisdiction for a period of one 
year and one day, effective 30 days after the date of entry of 
this order, as provided by Rules 2.3(a)(2) and 2.16(c) of the 
Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i (RSCH). 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, in addition to any other 
requirements for reinstatement imposed by the Rules of the 
Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i, Respondent Ng shall pay 
all costs of these proceedings as approved upon the timely submission of a bill of costs, as prescribed by RSCH Rule 2.3(c). 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Ng shall, within
 
ten days after the effective date of his suspension, file with
 
this court an affidavit in full compliance with RSCH Rule
 
2.16(d).
