IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I 
OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
DONALD L. WILKERSON, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 10-014-8848)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, and McKenna, JJ.,
Intermediate Court of Appeals Associate Judge Leonard,
in place of Acoba, J., recused,
and Intermediate Court of Appeals Associate Judge Fujise,
assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of the Report and Recommendation of 
the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of the State of 
Hawai
'i, the stipulated facts, and the evidence in the record, it 
appears Respondent Donald L. Wilkerson requested and was granted a deferred acceptance of a no-contest plea to nine misdemeanor 
counts of Wilful Failure to File a General Excise Tax Return, 
under HRS § 231-35 (2001). It further appears that, having 
fulfilled the conditions of the plea after one year, the district 
court dismissed the charges. It also appears Respondent 
Wilkerson’s actions constitute one violation of Rule 8.4(a) and 
nine violations of Rule 8.4(b) of the Hawai' i Rules of 
Professional Conduct (HRPC) and, in aggravation, Respondent Wilkerson has received two prior disciplinary sanctions, in 2004
 
and 2005, for violations of HRPC Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a), 1.4(b),
 
1.15(b), 1.15(d), 3.3(a), 8.1(b), 8.4(c) and 8.4(d). In
 
mitigation, it appears Respondent Wilkerson cooperated with the
 
present investigation, has expressed remorse, has taken
 
subsequent remedial measures to ensure the violations do not
 
reoccur, and has performed significant pro bono work on behalf of
 
indigent criminal defendants. Therefore, it appearing that
 
public censure is warranted,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Donald L.
 
Wilkerson is publicly censured.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Wilkerson shall
 
pay all costs of the proceedings, as approved upon a timely
 
submission of a bill of costs, as prescribed by RSCH Rule 2.3(c).
