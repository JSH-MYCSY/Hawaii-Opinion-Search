ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 12-014-9030, 12-035-9051,

ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the record in Office of
 
Disciplinary Counsel v. Nishioka, SCAD-12-0001113, this court
 
makes the following findings and conclusions by clear and
 
convincing evidence. On February 11, 2013, this court allowed
 Respondent Greg Nishioka to resign in lieu of discipline,
 effective March 13, 2013, required him to surrender to the court
 clerk his license to practice law, and to file, by March 25,
 2013, a certificate of compliance with his disbarment, pursuant
 to Rule 2.16(d) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of
 Hawai'i. The order was served electronically the same day upon 
Respondent Nishioka’s attorney in the matter. In the light of
 his failure to timely return his law license and to file the
 
required affidavit of compliance, this court, on April 5, 2013,
 entered an order to show cause upon Respondent Nishioka, to which
 Respondent Nishioka untimely responded on April 29, 2013, failing
 therein to explain his continued failure to file the affidavit of
 compliance required by RSCH Rule 2.16(d). Subsequently, on 
May 10, 2013, this court imposed sanctions of $50.00 upon
 Respondent Nishioka, requiring he submit proof of payment with
 the clerk by May 20, 2013, and warning him that failure to pay
 the sanctioned imposed or further failure to file the affidavit
 of compliance could result in further sanctions. The order for
 sanctions was served upon Nishioka’s attorney by electronic means
 the same day. As of the date of entry of this order, Nishioka
 has failed to file the affidavit of compliance or to submit proof
 he has paid the sanction imposed by this court’s May 10, 2013
 order. As such, this court, pursuant to RSCH Rules 2.14(d) and
 Rule 2.20(a), finds and concludes Respondent Nishioka, is “an
 attorney [who] has been . . . disbarred and has not comp[li]ed
 with [RSCH] Rule 2.16.” Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Nishioka shall,
 
within 10 days of the date of service of this order upon him,
 submit to this court an affidavit demonstrating any good cause as
 to why his legal practice, including its files and client trust
 accounts, should not be placed under a trusteeship, pursuant to
 
2
 RSCH Rule 2.20. Respondent Nishioka is hereby notified that
 
failure to timely respond shall be deemed an acquiescence to such
 a trusteeship.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that ODC shall attempt to serve a
 
copy of this order upon Respondent Nishioka both personally and
 by certified or registered mail and shall submit to this court
 within 20 days after the date of entry of this order an affidavit
 detailing its efforts at such service and the outcome.
 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that ODC shall submit to this
 
court, within 20 days after the date of entry of this order, the
 nomination of a trustee, pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.20, of a
 responsible person, including an assistant disciplinary counsel
 from its offices, to assume said trusteeship should it be
 necessary.
