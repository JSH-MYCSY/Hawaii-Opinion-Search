DISCIPLINARY BOARD OF THE HAWAI' I SUPREME COURT,
Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
MICHAEL K. KANESHIRO,
Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 12-047-9063)
 
ORDER OF TRANSFER TO INACTIVE STATUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) petitions to
 
transfer Respondent Michael K. Kaneshiro to inactive status due
 
to a mental or physical illness or disability. Because the
 motion was approved for filing by the Disciplinary Board Chair,
 we view the motion as a Disciplinary Board Petition to Determine
 Capacity to Practice Law, made pursuant to Rule 2.19(b) of the
 Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i (RSCH). 
Respondent Kaneshiro did not submit a response. Upon
 consideration of the petition and the affidavits and exhibits
 attached thereto, this court concludes that Respondent Kaneshiro
 is rendered incapable of the practice of law due to a mental or
 
physical illness or disability. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Clerk shall re-caption 
the case Disciplinary Board of the Hawai' i Supreme Court v. 
Michael K. Kaneshiro. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Michael K.
 
Kaneshiro is immediately transferred to involuntary inactive
 status in this jurisdiction pursuant to RSCH Rules 2.19(c),
 effective with the filing of this order. Respondent Kaneshiro
 shall remain on involuntary inactive status until further order
 of this court.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that ODC shall attempt to effect
 
personal service of this order upon Respondent Kaneshiro and
 shall file with this court an affidavit setting forth the results
 of such service attempts within 20 days after the date of entry
 of this order.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Kaneshiro may
 
file a motion with this court, at any time he deems appropriate,
 for reinstatement to the practice of law. Said motion shall
 state with particularity evidence in support of the motion,
 including pertinent medical reports, as set forth in RSCH Rule
 2.19(g).
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that upon transfer of Respondent
 
Kaneshiro to inactive status the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
 
2
 shall suspend and hold in abeyance any disciplinary proceedings
 
against Respondent Kaneshiro to the extent required by RSCH Rule
 2.19(h).
 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that the Board shall publicize
 
notice of the transfer of Respondent Kaneshiro to inactive
 status, as required by RSCH Rules 2.19(d) and (e). 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, February 22, 2013.
