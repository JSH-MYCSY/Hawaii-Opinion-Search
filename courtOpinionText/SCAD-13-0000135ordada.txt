OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
GILBERT P. KEA, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 06-029-8369, 06-052-8392, 07-048-8508, 07-139-8559)
 
ORDER OF SUSPENSION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the Report and Recommendation of
 
the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of the State of
 
Hawai'i, recommending, inter alia, that this court disbar 
Respondent Gilbert P. Kea, the Petitions, and the evidence in the
 
record, this court reaches the following findings and conclusions
 
based upon clear and convincing evidence; specifically, that:
 
In ODC No. 06-029-8369, by failing to ensure he
 
maintained communications with the Department of Labor and
 
Industrial Relations (LIRAB) after missing the October 6, 2000
 
hearing, and thereby failing to attend subsequent hearings on
 
November 17, 2000 and December 7, 2000, which resulted in the
 
dismissal of his client’s appeal, Kea violated Rules 1.1, 1.3 and
 3.4(e) of the Hawai' i Rules of Professional Conduct (HRPC). By 
failing to keep his client apprised of the hearing schedule and 
failing to provide her with sufficient information during the 
period of September through December, 2000 sufficient to preserve 
her appeal, Kea violated HRPC Rules 1.4(a) and 1.4(b). By 
failing to inform LIRAB of his withdrawal from the 
representation, to the detriment of the client’s interests, Kea 
violated HRPC Rule 1.16(d). By failing to respond to the Office 
of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) or obey the subpoena issued in the 
matter, Kea violated HRPC Rules 8.1(b) and 8.4(d). In 
mitigation, however, we note the client failed to assert any 
interest in the matter for more than three years following Kea’s 
withdrawal, and waited a further twenty-two months to report the 
matter to ODC and, further, a summons and petition in the matter 
was not filed by ODC until more than five years after the 
issuance of its April 4, 2006 subpoena, on September 9, 2011. 
In ODC No. 06-052-8392, by failing to file the
 
affidavit for damages and to otherwise complete the litigation,
 
Kea violated HRPC Rules 1.3 and 3.2. By failing to respond to
 
the client’s numerous telephone calls, her requests for a
 
briefing on the status of the litigation, and for a copy of the
 
court order denying her own, pro se affidavit, Kea violated HRPC
 Rules 1.4(a) and 1.4(b). By failing to inform the client of his
 
suspension from the practice of law or to provide her with her
 
requested final accounting or a refund of unearned fees, he
 
violated HRPC Rules 1.4(b), 1.15(f)(3) and 1.16(d). When Kea
 
informed the client’s assistant on November 5, 2005, that he had
 
2
 filed the required affidavit for costs with the court when, in
 
fact, he had not, Kea misrepresented the truth, in violation of
 
HRPC Rule 8.4(c). By failing to respond to ODC’s inquiries in
 
the subsequent investigation, Kea violated HRPC Rules 8.1(b) and
 
8.4(d). This court further notes ODC corresponded with Kea in
 
this matter in April, 2006, but did not issue the petition
 
seeking discipline until more than five years later, on
 
September 9, 2011.
 
In ODC No. 07-139-8559, by failing to communicate with
 
his client between September and December, 2006, and by failing
 
to appear at the December 6, 2006 hearing, Kea violated HRPC
 
Rules 1.3, 1.4(a), and 1.4(b). By misrepresenting the
 
seriousness and implications of his December 15, 2006 suspension
 
for failing to cooperate, thereby denying the client the
 
opportunity to timely arrange for alternate legal representation,
 
Kea violated HRPC Rules 1.4(b) and 8.4(c). By providing legal
 
advice at a January, 2007 meeting with the client while suspended
 
from the practice of law, Kea violated HRPC Rule 5.5(a). In
 
light of the length of the representation and the work invested
 
by Kea on the client’s behalf, the record does not establish by
 
clear and convincing evidence that Kea failed to earn all of the
 
funds received, making a restitution order inappropriate, but the
 
record does demonstrate that, by failing to provide an accounting
 
when he paid himself $7,000.00 in client funds during the
 
representation, and by again failing to provide an accounting
 
when paying himself the final installment of $1,621.24 upon the
 
conclusion of the representation, Kea violated HRPC Rule
 
3
   
 1.15(f)(3). By failing to respond to ODC’s investigation into
 
the matter, Kea violated HRPC Rule 8.1(b) and 8.4(d). Finally,
 
this court notes the record does not indicate when ODC received
 
Trombley’s complaint and when, or if, ODC contacted Kea in this
 
matter, but notes the relevant events occurred in 2006 and early
 
2007, and the formal petition for discipline in this matter was
 
filed February 13, 2012.
 
In ODC No. 07-048-8508, by failing to file an affidavit 
that he had fully complied with the conditions of his December 
15, 2005 interim suspension, as required by Rule 2.16(d) of the 
Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i (RSCH), or to 
respond to ODC’s inquiries into that failure, Kea violated HRPC Rule 3.4(e), 8.1(b), and 8.4(d). The court again notes, however, 
ODC notified Kea on April 9, 2007 of the initiation of 
disciplinary proceedings for the failure to file the affidavit, 
but did not issue its petition in that case until September 9, 
2011. 
In aggravation, this court finds Respondent Kea had
 
substantial experience in the practice of law and in the present
 
matters finds multiple violations and a pattern of being
 
unresponsive and dilatory with regards to clients’ needs. In
 
mitigation, this court notes Kea’s clean disciplinary record
 
prior to the instant matters, and the substantial delay in the
 
disciplinary process. Therefore, suspension being warranted,
 
see, e.g., ODC v. Duvauchelle, No. 19459 (October 14, 1997); ODC
 
v. Ching, No. 16907 (April 14, 1993); ODC v. Battista , No. 13626
 
(September 27, 1989),

 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Gilbert P. Kea is
 
suspended from the practice of law in this jurisdiction for five
 
years, effective nunc pro tunc to September 9, 2011.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Kea shall
 
file with this court, within ninety days after the date of entry
 
of this order, an affidavit that he has complied with the
 
requirements of RSCH Rule 2.16 with regards to his suspension
 
from the practice of law, commencing on December 15, 2006.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Kea’s
 
interim suspension for failure to cooperate, imposed pursuant to
 
RSCH Rule 2.12A, is set aside, pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.12A(b).
