OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
MARJORIE H. MANUIA, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 09-13-8736, 11-055-8979,
11-070-8994, 11-071-8995 and 12-046-9062)
 
ORDER OF SUSPENSION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the Report and Recommendation of
 
the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of the State of
 
Hawai'i, recommending, inter alia, that this court suspend 
Respondent Marjorie Manuia for one year and one day, the
 
stipulated facts, and the evidence in the record, this court
 reaches the following findings and conclusions based upon clear
 and convincing evidence; specifically, that:
 
In ODC No. 09-013-8736, Manuia took no action on her
 
client’s divorce proceedings between November, 2007 and August,
 2008, in violation of Rule 1.3 of the Hawai' i Rules of 
Professional Conduct (HRPC) and, by failing to provide the client
 with the promised quarterly statements, Manuia violated HRPC Rule
 1.15(f)(3). By transferring to her business account $1,178.40 in
 
client funds to which she knew she had no rightful claim, Manuia
 violated HRPC Rules 1.15(c) and 1.15(d). By failing to timely
 respond to the client’s telephone calls, Manuia violated HRPC
 Rule 1.4(a). By failing to provide an accounting and a refund
 for 113 days from the initial request for both, Manuia violated
 HRPC Rules 1.15(f)(3) and 1.16(d). By billing the client $375.00
 for time spent reviewing his file before returning it to him, she
 violated HRPC Rule 1.5(a). By failing to maintain the proper
 financial records regarding client funds and to perform the
 required account reconciliations, Manuia violated HRPC Rules
 1.15(g) (1), (2), (8) and (9).
 
In ODC No. 11-055-8979, by accepting a $10,000.00 fee,
 
earning $916.21 of the fee, including general excise tax, by
 December 15, 2010, and allowing the balance on her client trust
 account to be drawn down to $5,721.83 as of that day, Manuia
 misappropriated at least $3,361.99 of the client’s money, in
 violation of HRPC Rules 1.15(c) and (d). By failing to timely
 provide an accounting, Manuia violated HRPC Rule 1.15(f)(3). 
Manuia violated HRPC Rules 1.15(g)(1), (2), (8), and (9) by
 failing to maintain the client’s financial information in the
 manner and form required by the Rules and by failing to perform
 required reconciliations. The remaining violations to which
 Manuia stipulated in this matter are not supported by clear and
 
2
 convincing evidence in the record, including the stipulated
 
facts, or are inapplicable to the conduct alleged. 
In ODC No. 11-070-8994, by failing to provide the
 
client with an accounting of his funds for 65 days, particularly
 in light of evidence in the record that she possessed such
 information shortly after the request was made, Manuia violated
 HRPC Rule 1.15(f)(3). By failing to maintain required financial
 records and perform required reconciliations during the time she
 held the client’s money in trust, Manuia violated HRPC Rule
 1.15(g)(1), (2), (8) and (9). The remaining violations to which
 Manuia stipulated in this matter are not supported by clear and
 convincing evidence in the record, including the stipulated
 facts, or are inapplicable to the conduct alleged. 
In ODC No. 11-071-8995, Manuia, by failing to respond
 
to the client’s requests for a final billing, violated HRPC Rule
 1.4(a), by failing to provide a final accounting, violated HRPC
 Rule 1.15(f)(3), and, by failing to maintain the required
 financial records regarding client funds or to perform the
 required reconciliations during the relevant time period,
 violated HRPC Rules 1.15(g)(1), (2), (8), and (9).
 
In ODC No. 12-046-9062, the record and the stipulated
 
facts in particular, do not support, by clear and convincing
 evidence, the violations stipulated to by Respondent Manuia in
 the Settlement Agreement. Manuia’s conduct with regard to the
 
3
 declaration did not rise to the level of a violation of HRPC Rule
 
1.3, particularly in light of the shortcomings in the service of
 the document upon Manuia, the resulting truncation of time within
 which to respond, and the lack of harm to the client as a result
 of Manuia’s late filing of her response. Ten days to execute a
 withdrawal and substitution of counsel, absent evidence in the
 record of exigent circumstances necessitating immediate
 withdrawal, does not rise to the level of improper withdrawal in
 violation of HRPC Rule 1.16(d). Failure to timely provide an
 accounting to a client constitutes a violation of HRPC Rule
 1.15(f)(3), but the record is silent as to when, or if, the
 client made a request for an accounting. The record is similarly
 silent as to any failure on Manuia’s behalf to communicate with
 the client, to timely return her telephone calls or otherwise
 fail to respond to inquiries, necessary to find, by clear and
 convincing evidence, that Manuia violated HRPC Rule 1.4(a).
 
In addition, this court finds, by clear and convincing
 
evidence, the following factors in aggravation and mitigation. 
In aggravation, we find Manuia has received one previous
 discipline, a 2007 informal admonition for failing to timely
 provide a client with a copy of a court order and an accounting
 when requested, in violation of HRPC Rules 1.4(a) and 1.15(f)(3);
 a pattern of misconduct – a failure to communicate, to timely
 provide accountings, and to effectively and properly withdraw
 
4
 from representations – between the present matter and the past
 
discipline, and within the present disciplinary proceedings;
 multiple violations of the HRPC; and substantial experience in
 the practice of law. In mitigation, we find an absence of a
 selfish or dishonest motive, a favorable reputation in the
 community, including an admirable willingness to represent under-
served portions of the community, personal and emotional
 challenges during part of the relevant period, a cooperative
 attitude toward ODC and the disciplinary process; and a
 recognition of the wrongful nature of her conduct. Therefore, a
 period of suspension being warranted, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Manuia is 
suspended from the practice of law in this jurisdiction for a period of one year and one day, effective 30 days after the date of entry of this order, as provided by Rules 2.3(a)(2) and 2.16(c) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i 
(RSCH). 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Manuia shall
 
complete a course on the management of a law practice, including
 in its curriculum case-load management, time management, and the
 appropriate management of client funds, offered by the Practicing
 Attorneys Liability Management Society, proof of completion of
 said course being a precondition to the granting of any petition
 for reinstatement Respondent Manuia may file in the future.

 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, in addition to any other 
requirements for reinstatement imposed by the Rules of the 
Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i, Respondent Manuia shall 
pay all costs of these proceedings as approved upon the timely submission of a bill of costs, as prescribed by RSCH Rule 2.3(c). 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Manuia shall,
 
within ten days after the effective date of her suspension, file
 with this court an affidavit that she is in full compliance with
 RSCH Rule 2.16(d).
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, May 20, 2013.
