ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 13-016-9086)
 
ORDER IMPOSING PUBLIC CENSURE
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the Office of Disciplinary
 
Counsel’s May 1, 2013 petition for issuance of a reciprocal
 
discipline notice to Respondent Philip Martin Kleinsmith,
 pursuant to Rule 2.15(b) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the
 State of Hawai' i (RSCH), the memorandum, affidavit, and exhibits 
appended thereto, the May 23, 2013 Notice of Reciprocal
 Discipline issued by this court, and the record, it appears: (1)
 on March 20, 2012, the Supreme Court of Arizona imposed upon
 Respondent Kleinsmith a reprimand, a one-year term of probation,
 subject to early termination upon the completion of an ethics
 course at his own expense, and costs of the proceedings, for
 conduct in violation of Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.16, 5.3, and
 8.4(d) of the Arizona Rules of Professional Conduct; (2) this
 
court’s May 23, 2013 Notice of Reciprocal Discipline was served
 on Respondent Kleinsmith on May 28, 2013, (3) by the terms of the
 May 23, 2013 order and RSCH Rule 2.15(b), Respondent Kleinsmith
 had until June 27, 2013 to respond to the Notice with any reasons
 as to why reciprocal discipline should not be imposed upon him,
 (4) Respondent Kleinsmith has failed to file a response with this
 court, and (5) a review of the record and precedent demonstrates,
 pursuant to RSCH Rules 2.15(c) and (d), that reciprocal
 discipline is authorized and justified. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Philip Martin
 
Kleinsmith is publicly censured by this court, pursuant to RSCH
 Rules 2.3(a)(3) and 2.15(c).
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Kleinsmith shall
 
bear the costs of these reciprocal proceedings, pursuant to RSCH
 Rule 2.3(c), upon the timely submission of a verified bill of
 costs by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.
