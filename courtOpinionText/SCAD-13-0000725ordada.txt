March 8, 2013, the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County, in
 
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, suspended Respondent Feeney
 
for one year and one day, effective April 8, 2013, for

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Feeney is
 
suspended from the practice of law in this jurisdiction for one
 
year, effective nunc pro tunc to April 8, 2013.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Feeney’s

Massachusetts.
 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that Respondent Feeney shall bear
 
any costs of these proceedings incurred by the Office of

bill of costs, as authorized by RSCH Rule 2.3(c).
