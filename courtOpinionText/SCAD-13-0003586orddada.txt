CHRISTOPHER M. FUJIYAMA,
Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 13-031-9101)
 
ORDER GRANTING PETITION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the petition for the immediate
 
restraint of Respondent Christopher M. Fujiyama from the practice
 
of law pursuant to Rule 2.13 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of
 the State of Hawai' i (RSCH) filed on September 25, 2013 by the 
Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) pursuant to RSCH Rule
 2.13(a), the affidavit and exhibits attached thereto, the
 September 27, 2013 response filed by Respondent Christopher M.
 Fujiyama, the exhibit accompanying Respondent Fujiyama’s
 submission, the October 3, 2013 submission by ODC in reply to
 Respondent Fujiyama’s submission, and the October 7, 2013 
“sur-reply” filed by Respondent Fujiyama, the court notes the
 proof of the finding of guilt in the United States District Court 
for the District of Hawai' i of Respondent Fujiyama for 
trafficking in counterfeit goods, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2320(a) would be, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2320(b) and HRS § 701-107(2) (Supp. 2005), a felony were it a conviction in Hawai'i state courts and further that the conviction is for a 
crime involving dishonesty or false statements. The court notes Respondent Fujiyama’s cooperative and responsible attitude since his conviction, including his self-reporting of his conviction to ODC, but concludes, pursuant to RSCH Rules 2.13(a)(2), 2.13(a)(3) and 2.13(c), Respondent Fujiyama’s restraint from the practice of law is warranted during the pendency of the disciplinary proceedings against him. Finally, the court notes that, in his submission, Respondent Fujiyama requests that formal proceedings be instituted forthwith. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Fujiyama is
 
restrained from the practice of law, pursuant to RSCH Rule
 2.13(b), said suspension constituting a suspension for the
 purposes of RSCH Rule 2.16 during the pendency of the
 disciplinary proceedings and, therefore, shall be effective 30
 days from the entry date of this order, pursuant to RSCH Rule
 2.16(c).
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Fujiyama shall
 
file an affidavit of compliance with his suspension within 10
 
2
 days after the effective date of his suspension, pursuant to RSCH
 
Rule 2.16(d).
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that ODC shall file proof of the
 
finding of guilt, and any other related documents it deems
 relevant, with the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court as
 required by RSCH Rule 2.13(a), file in the docket of this case
 proof of that filing, and refer the Board to the provisions of
 RSCH Rule 2.13(d) for the prompt institution of a formal
 disciplinary proceeding pursuant to RSCH Rules 2.7 and 2.13(d).
