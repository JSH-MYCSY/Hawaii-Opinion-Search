(ODC 13-003-9073)
ORDER
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Wilson, JJ.,
and Intermediate Court of Appeals Associate Judge Leonard,
assigned by reason of vacancy)
Upon consideration of the November 12, 2020 motion,
filed by Respondent Stephen Woodruff, which we deem a motion for
reconsideration, and the exhibits and declarations submitted in
support of that motion, and the record in this matter, we note
that, pursuant to Rule 40(a) of the Hawai#i Rules of Appellate
Procedure, the deadline for filing a motion for reconsideration
of this court’s October 11, 2016 order of disbarment was
October 21, 2016 and therefore find that Respondent Woodruff’s
motion is untimely.  Therefore, Electronically Filed
