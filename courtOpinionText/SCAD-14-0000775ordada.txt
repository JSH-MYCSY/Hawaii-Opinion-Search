OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL,
Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
M. CORA AVINANTE,
Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC CASE NOS. 10-069-8903; 12-024-9040; 12-030-9046)
 
ORDER OF REINSTATEMENT
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the November 12, 2014 affidavit
 
submitted by Respondent M. Cora Avinante and the record, it
 
appears Respondent Avinante has complied with the requirements of
 Rule 2.16 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of
 Hawai'i (RSCH) as well as all relevant requirements of the June 
12, 2014 order imposing upon her a 120-day period of suspension
 from the practice of law, except for the completion of the audit
 of her practice and submission of proof of adoption of the
 audit’s recommendations. It further appears Respondent Avinante
 has until June 12, 2015 to complete the aforementioned audit and
 submit proof of completion. Finally, it appears the Office of
 
Disciplinary Counsel was served notice of Respondent Avinante’s
 affidavit, as required by RSCH Rule 2.17(b)(2). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, pursuant to RSCH Rule
 
2.17(b), Respondent Avinante is reinstated to the practice of law
 in this jurisdiction, effective upon entry of this order.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Avinante is
 
hereby notified that failure to meet the July 12, 2015 deadline
 for submission of proof of adoption of the recommendations
 arising from the audit of her practice may result in a further
 period of suspension, upon a review of the record, including
 relevant audit reports.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
