GERARD A. JERVIS,
Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC CASE NOS. 10-060-8894, 10-034-8868)
 
ORDER OF SUSPENSION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.
and Intermediate Court of Appeals Associate Judge Leonard,
in place of McKenna, J., recused) 
Upon consideration of the Report and Recommendation of 
the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of the State of 
Hawai'i, submitted to this court on June 23, 2014, for the 
imposition of a six-month suspension upon Respondent Gerard A. 
Jervis, and upon a de novo  review of the record, this court finds 
and concludes the following by clear and convincing evidence. 
A review of the record supports the Hearing Officer’s 
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, as amended by the 
Disciplinary Board, except for Conclusions 9 and 12, which we 
decline to adopt, for the reasons set forth below. 
With particularity, in Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) Case No. 10-060-8894, the record supports Finding of 
Fact 6, that the retainer agreement between the client and 
Respondent Jervis did not contain the handwritten additions at 
the time it was signed by the client but was completed at a later 
time, and not by the client, insofar as the agreement bears the 
date of February 28, 2008, while the record contains a disclosure 
authorization form from the client dated February 1, 2008 and 
correspondence from Respondent Jervis’s office concerning the 
workers’ compensation claim began by at least February 12, 2008; 
the agreement bears a handwritten constructive discharge date of 
September 30, 2007, in handwriting which Respondent Jervis 
admitted was his, while the actual constructive discharge date of 
September 28, 2007 was known by the client and recorded 
previously in the client’s claim, filed by the client, with the 
Hawai'i Civil Rights Commission. Based upon that Finding and a 
review of the record, including the extensive correspondence amongst the client, Respondent Jervis’s office, the Hawai' i 
Employers’ Mutual Insurance Company, Inc. and the Department of Labor & Industrial Relations, often either clearly addressed to 
Respondent Jervis or otherwise designating Respondent Jervis as 
the client’s attorney, to which Respondent Jervis offered no 
objection, and, in particular, the June 3 and 4, 2009 email 
exchange between the client and Respondent Jervis, we conclude 
the client reasonably concluded Respondent Jervis was 
representing him in his workers’ compensation claim. See Otaka, 
Inc. v. Klein, 71 Haw. 376, 383, 791 P.2d 713, 717 (1990); Geoffrey C. Hazard, W. William Hodes, and Peter R. Jarvis, The 
2
 Law of Lawyering § 2.05 at 2-7 through 2-8 (4th
  ed. 2015);
Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers § 14 (1998). 
Insofar as the record supports the conclusion an attorney-client
 
relationship existed between the client and Respondent Jervis in
 
the workers’ compensation claim, it also supports the conclusion
 
Respondent Jervis violated Rules 1.3, 1.4(a) and 1.4(b) of the
 
1
Hawai'i Rules of Professional Conduct (HRPC) (1994)  in that
representation, by failing to transmit the settlement offer to 
his client or otherwise act upon it, and by failing to attend the 
September 24, 2009 hearing on the claim. 
Also in ODC Case No. 10-060-8894, the record supports 
the conclusion Respondent Jervis was derelict in his 
representation of his client in the Civil Rights discrimination 
claim, and failed to communicate with the client regarding the 
matter, including regarding important information needed to make 
strategic decisions concerning the claim, including efforts by 
the Hawai' i Civil Rights Commission to interview his client. His 
conduct in that representation violated HRPC Rules 1.3, 1.4(a), and 1.4(b). 
In ODC Case No. 10-034-8868, we conclude both the loan
 
and the amendment to the fee agreement, which modified the loan,
 
are subject to HRPC Rule 1.8(a). See In re Curry, 16 So.3d 1139,
 
1153-54 (La. 2009); In re Hefron, 771 N.E.2d 1157, 1158 (Ind.
 2002); Naiman v. New York Univ. Hosps. Ctr., 351 F.Supp.2d 257,
1
   Unless otherwise indicated, all HRPC Rules cited herein are to
 
HRPC (1994), the Rules in effect at the time of the conduct
underpinning the alleged violations.
 
3
  
 264 (S.D.N.Y. 2005); The Law of Lawyering, § 9.14 at 9-50 through
 
9-53 (2015). However, we also conclude, upon review of In re
 
Trewin, 684 N.W.2d 121 (Wis. 2004), Wisconsin’s SCR 20:1.7(b) and
 
1.8(a) cited in that case, HRPC Rules 1.7(b) and 1.8(a), as well
 
as HRPC Rules 1.7(b) and 1.8(a) (2014), that, at the time of the
 
events here, neither HRPC Rule 1.7(b) nor 1.8(a) required the
 
attorney to obtain a written conflict waiver from a client in
 
these circumstances.2
 
However, with regard to the $100,000.00 loan from the
 
Trust to Respondent Jervis, we also conclude Respondent Jervis
 
did not provide the trustee-client with a clear written
 
explanation of the differing interests involved in the
 
transaction, in violation of HRPC Rule 1.8(a), and that the terms
 
of the loan were not fair and reasonable to the Trust, again in
 
violation of HRPC Rule 1.8(a), in light of both the insufficient
 
security for the loan and its vague and unclear terms of
 
repayment of the indebtedness. See In the Matter of Hultman, 3
 
Cal. State Bar C. Rptr. 297 (Cal. Bar Ct. 1995); Hunniecutt v.
2   In 2014, the Hawai 'i Rules of Professional Conduct were amended 
to require a written waiver in these circumstances: 
Rule 1.8. Conflict of Interest: Prohibited transactions.
 
(a) A lawyer shall not enter into a business
transaction with a client or knowingly acquire an ownership,
possessory, security or other pecuniary interest adverse to
a client unless: 
. . .
 (3) the client consents in writing to the essential
terms of the transaction and the lawyer’s role in the
transaction, including whether the lawyer is representing
the client in the transaction.
 
4
 State Bar of California, 748 P.2d 1161, 1167 (Cal. 1988); In re
 
Discipline of Singer, 865 P.2d 315, 316-17 (Nev. 1993); GMAC v.
 
Everett Chevrolet, Inc. 317 P.3d 1074, 1078-79 (Wash. Ct. App.
 
2014); In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Miller, 66 P.3d
 
1069, 1076 (Wash. 2003); In re McGlothen, 663 P.2d 1330, 1336,
 
1337 (Wash. 1983); Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing
 
Lawyers § 126, at 323 (2000).
 
With regard to the amendment of the fee agreement, we
 
conclude Respondent Jervis failed to provide the Trust with a
 
clear explanation of the differing interests involved in amending
 
the contingency fee agreement and extinguishing the $100,000.00
 
loan obligation he alone owed the Trust. Respondent Jervis’s
 
conduct again violated HRPC Rule 1.8(a).
 
The record supports the aggravating factors found by
 
the Hearing Officer and the Board: substantial experience in the
 
practice of law, one prior discipline, offering false statements
 
in a disciplinary investigation (concerning his purported lack of
 
previous workers’ compensation work), and a refusal to
 
acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct in ODC Case No.
 
10-034-8868.
 
In mitigation, we note Respondent Jervis’s pro
 
bono work, particularly on behalf of the Native Hawaiian
 
community.
 
In light of previous-settled litigation between
 
Respondent Jervis and the successor trustees of the Trust, in
 
which the successor trustees settled claims in part related to
 
Respondent Jervis’s representation of this Trust, we decline to
 
5
 order reimbursement.
 
Nevertheless, in light of Respondent Jervis’s conduct
 
regarding the Trust and the injury inflicted on the Trust, a
 
substantial period of suspension is appropriate. See ODC v.
 
Bertelmann, SCAD-12-950 (February 15, 2013); ODC v. Ching, No.
 25697 (May 2, 2003); ODC v, Chatburn, No. 24777 (May 30, 2002);
 
ODC v. Arnobit, Jr., No. 16932 (July 19, 1993). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Jervis is 
suspended from the practice of law in this jurisdiction for six 
months, effective thirty days after the entry date of this order, 
as provided by Rules 2.3(a)(2) and Rule 2.16(c) of the Rules of 
the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i (RSCH). 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, in addition to any other 
requirements for reinstatement imposed by the Rules of the 
Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i, Respondent Jervis shall 
pay all costs of these proceedings as approved upon the timely submission of a bill of costs, as prescribed by RSCH Rule 2.3(c). 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that Respondent Jervis shall,
 
within 10 days after the effective date of his suspension, file
 
with this court an affidavit that he is in full compliance with
 
RSCH Rule 2.16(d).
