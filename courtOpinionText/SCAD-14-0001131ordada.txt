(ODC 14-049-9192)
 
ORDER ALLOWING RESIGNATION IN LIEU OF DISCIPLINE
  
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the Office of Disciplinary
 
Counsel (ODC)’s petition for an order granting the request of
 
attorney Cheryl R. Brawley to resign from the practice of law in
 lieu of discipline, and the memorandum, affidavits, and exhibits
 attached in support thereof, we note the petition is supported
 by Respondent Brawley’s affidavit which meets the requirements
 of Rule 2.14(a) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State
 of Hawai' i (RSCH). We further note Respondent Brawley admits to 
failing to maintain a business account for her practice,
 withdrawing client funds for her own use and benefit before
 earning them, failing to keep client funds in trust until
 earned, misrepresenting material facts to ODC during its 
investigation, and creating a false deposit slip in support of those misrepresentations, in violation of Rules 1.15(a)(2), 1.15(c), and 1.15(d) of the Hawai' i Rules of Professional 
Conduct (HRPC) (1994) and HRPC Rule 8.4(c) (2014). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.14, that
 
the petition is granted and Respondent Cheryl R. Brawley’s
 request to resign in lieu of discipline is granted.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the resignation shall
 
become effective 30 days after the date of this order, as
 provided by RSCH Rules 2.14(d) and 2.16(c).
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that (1) the Clerk shall remove
 
Respondent Brawley’s name from the role of attorneys licensed to
 practice law in this jurisdiction and (2) within thirty days
 after entry of this order, Respondent Brawley shall submit to
 the Clerk of this court the original certificate evidencing her
 license to practice law in this jurisdiction or an affidavit
 establishing good cause for her failure to do so. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that (1) Respondent Brawley 
shall comply with the requirements of RSCH Rule 2.16 and (2) the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i 
shall provide notice of the disbarment as required by RSCH Rule 2.16(e) and (f). 
2
 IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that Respondent Brawley shall 
bear the costs of these proceedings upon the timely submission
 
by ODC of a verified bill of costs, as authorized by RSCH Rule
 2.3(c).
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, September 26, 2014.
