Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
MICHAEL G.M. OSTENDORP,
Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
  
(ODC CASE NO. 10-057-8891)
 
ORDER OF REINSTATEMENT
  
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the December 23, 2016 petition
 
and affidavit submitted by Respondent Michael G.M. Ostendorp and
 
the record, it appears Respondent Ostendorp has complied with all
 relevant requirements upon which his six-month period of
 suspension from the practice of law is contingent, and has
 complied with the requirements of Rule 2.16 of the Rules of the
 Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i (RSCH), though we note 
Respondent Ostendorp still must complete an audit of his practice
 as provided in this courtâ€™s May 3, 2016 order. It further
 appears the Office of Disciplinary Counsel was served notice of
 the affidavit, as required by RSCH Rule 2.17(b). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, pursuant to RSCH Rule 
2.17(b), Respondent Ostendorp is reinstated to the practice of 
law in the jurisdiction of the State of Hawai' i, effective upon 
entry of this order. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 17, 2017.
