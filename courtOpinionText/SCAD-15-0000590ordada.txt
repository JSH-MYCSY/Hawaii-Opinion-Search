ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC CASE NOS. 14-025-9168, 14-026-9769,

ORDER ALLOWING RESIGNATION IN LIEU OF DISCIPLINE 
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the petition submitted by the 
Disciplinary Board of the Hawai' i Supreme Court for an order 
granting the request of attorney Robert Lee Stone to resign from 
the practice of law in lieu of discipline, and the affidavits and 
exhibits attached in support thereof, we note the petition is 
supported by Respondent Stone’s affidavit, which meets the 
requirements of Rule 2.14(a) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of 
the State of Hawai' i (RSCH). We further note Respondent Stone 
admits that, when he was not licensed to practice law in this jurisdiction, he did enter into representations of six separate 
clients in this jurisdiction, for mortgage foreclosure defense for property located in Hawai' i, and did not disclose to the 
Board of Bar Examiners of the Hawai' i Supreme Court two ongoing 
investigations against him being conducted by the Office of 
Consumer Protection of the State of Hawai' i Department of 
Commerce and Consumer Affairs, three disciplinary complaints against him pending with the Attorney Registration and 
Disciplinary Commission of the Supreme Court of the State of 
Illinois, and a lawsuit in the United States District Court for 
the District of Hawai' i against a former colleague, conduct which 
constituted multiple violations of Rules 3.3(a), 8.1(a), 8.1(b), 8.4(c) of the Hawai' i Rules of Professional Conduct (1994). 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.14, that
 
the petition is granted and Respondent Robert L. Stone’s request
 to resign in lieu of discipline is granted.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the resignation shall become
 
effective 30 days after the date of this order, as provided by
 
RSCH Rules 2.14(d) and 2.16(c).
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of this court
 
shall remove Respondent Stone’s name from the role of attorneys
 
licensed to practice law in this jurisdiction and, within thirty
 
days after entry of this order, Respondent Stone shall submit to
 
the Clerk the original certificate evidencing his license to
 
practice law in this jurisdiction or an affidavit establishing
 
good cause for his failure to do so. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Stone shall
 
comply with the requirements of RSCH Rule 2.16 governing
 
disbarred attorneys and the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme
 
2
 Court of the State of Hawai' i shall provide notice of the 
disbarment as required by RSCH Rules 2.16(e) and 2.16(f). 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that Respondent Stone shall bear
 
the costs of these proceedings upon the timely submission by ODC
 
of a verified bill of costs, as authorized by RSCH Rule 2.3(c).
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 23, 2015.
