ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 09-011-8743)
 
ORDER
 
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Pursuant to Rule 2.19 of the Rules of the Supreme Court
 
of the State of Hawai' i (RSCH), and upon due consideration of the 
entire record in this matter, this court hereby concludes that
 
Respondent Kendall C.S. Wong is presently in the course of a
 disciplinary proceeding both before this court, pursuant to the
 August 5, 2016 order entered by this court in response to the 
May 27, 2016 petition filed with this court by the Office of
 Disciplinary Counsel on behalf of the Disciplinary Board of the
 Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i, as well as before the 
Disciplinary Board through the remand by the Board of his
 disciplinary matter for further review. We further conclude
 
that, based upon a review of the entire record in this matter,
 Respondent Wong, by his own statements to the Board, has
 established he is presently incapacitated due to a physical
 infirmity that prevents him from fulfilling his obligations in
 the disciplinary matter and from practicing law. See Docket
 
3:64, 71, 79, 171, 181, 183, 189. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Kendall C.S. Wong
 
is hereby transferred immediately to inactive status, on the
 grounds of the aforementioned disability, for an indefinite
 period of time. Respondent Wong is cautioned he may not resume
 the practice of law until reinstated by order of this court.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Wong may remedy
 
this suspension by filing an application for reinstatement,
 pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.19(f).
 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that the Disciplinary Board shall
 
publicize notice of Respondent Wongâ€™s suspension as required by
 RSCH Rules 2.19(d) and 2.19(e).
