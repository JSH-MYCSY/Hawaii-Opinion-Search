ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 13-006-9076)
 
ORDER OF PUBLIC CENSURE
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon examination of the July 18, 2016 report filed with
 
this court by the Disciplinary Board of the Hawai 
'i Supreme 
Court, the exhibits appended to it, and the record as a whole,
 
and upon full and careful consideration of the briefs in this
 matter submitted to this court by Respondent Dexter K. Kaiama and
 by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, we conclude, by clear and
 convincing evidence, that the record supports the violations
 identified by the Disciplinary Board:
1
 specifically, that, on
1
   We accept the Findings and Conclusions as amended by the
 
Board, with two exceptions.  Based upon the Hearing Officer’s role as
finder of fact, we accept Finding No. 12 as proposed by the Hearing
Officer, and accept Finding 13, as amended to read “It was never
Respondent’s intent to be disruptive.”  Nevertheless, insofar as we
join other jurisdictions in applying an objective test regarding such
conduct, and conclude Respondent Kaiama, at a minimum, leveled his
(continued...)
 July 13, 2012, by filing the Notice of Protest and its 
attachments in the Third Circuit litigation presided over by the Judge in question, Respondent Kaiama, with reckless disregard as to the truth or falsity of the allegation, accused the presiding Judge of committing war crimes under international Conventions, and thereby filed a frivolous document that served no legal or practical purpose, in violation of Rule 3.1 of the Hawai' i Rules 
of Professional Conduct (HRPC) (1994), harassed and embarrassed the Judge, in violation of HRPC Rule 3.5(b), engaged in conduct reasonably likely to disrupt the tribunal - and which did disrupt the tribunal - in violation of HRPC Rule 3.5(c), and made statements with reckless disregard as to their truth or falsity concerning the integrity of the Judge, in violation of HRPC Rule 8.2. 
With regard to Respondent’s arguments concerning the
 
scope of permitted testimony at the disciplinary hearings, we
 note Respondent Kaiama had an opportunity to argue before the
 Hearing Officer for the admission of witness testimony, and was
 allowed to submit written evidence into the proceedings regarding
 the legal arguments which he asserted supported his accusations
 against the Judge. We therefore conclude the Hearing Officer’s
 evidentiary rulings, made following the October 17, 2014 hearing,
 
1(...continued)
accusations with a reckless disregard to their truth or falsity, we
conclude the record supports the violations of the Hawai 'i Rules of 
Professional Conduct identified by the Board. 
2
 and the general conduct of the proceedings did not deny 
Respondent Kaiama’s rights to due process. See Bank of Hawaii v. 
Kunimoto, 91 Hawai' i 372, 388, 984 P.2d 1198, 1214 (1999). 
We conclude that Respondent Kaiama’s allegations are
 
clearly false upon the evidence in the record, as Respondent
 Kaiama has not proffered any evidence the Judge in question has
 been convicted of war crimes by any court or tribunal. 
We further conclude the Respondent’s accusations were
 
not opinion based upon fully-disclosed facts, but were mere
 allegations, based upon tenuous legal analysis of broad statutory
 provisions which do not survive analysis. We conclude Respondent
 Kaiama’s allegations “‘imply a false assertion of fact’” which
 could “reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about
 their target” which are not true, and the charge of war criminal
 does, by its plain language, charge the Judge with “commission of
 a criminal offense.” See Standing Comm. on Discipline of the
 
U.S. Dist. Ct. v. Yagman
, 55 F.3d 1430, 1438 (9th
  Cir. 1995)
(quoting 
Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1, 19 (1990)). 
In sum, in the words of the United States Court of Appeals for
 the Ninth Circuit, Respondent Kaiama’s accusations “erode public
 confidence without serving to publicize problems that justifiably
 
deserve attention,” id. at 1438.  As such, Respondent’s
 
allegations are not protected speech. Cf. State ex. rel.
 
Oklahoma Bar Ass’n v. Porter, 766 P.2d 958, 968 (1988). We
 
further conclude these allegations were made with a reckless
 
3
 disregard to their truth or falsity, and were not assertions a
 
reasonable attorney, considered in light of all his professional
 functions, would make in the same or similar circumstances. See
 
Yagman, 55 F.3d at 1440, U.S. Dist. Ct. v. Sandlin, 12 F.3d 861,
 866-67 (9
th
  Cir. 1993);  In re Terry, 394 N.E.2d 94, 95-96 (Ind.
1994); 
In re Comfort, 159 P.3d 1011, 1019-20, 1027 (Kan. 2007);
 
Kentucky Bar Ass’n v. Blum, 404 S.W.3d 841, 856 (Ky. 2013); In re
 Cobb, 838 N.E.2d 1197, 1212 (Mass. 2005); In re Petition for
 Disciplinary Action Against Nathan, 671 N.W.2d 578, 584-86 (Minn.
 2013), In re Coe, 903 S.W.2d 916, 917 (Mo. 1995); Matter of
 Westfall, 808 S.W.2d 829, 837 (Mo. 1991); Disciplinary Counsel v.
 Gardner, 793 N.E.2d 425, 429 (Ohio 2003); Lawyer Disciplinary Bd.
 v. Hall, 765 S.E.2d 187, 198 (W.Va. 2014). 
We also emphasize Respondent Kaiama faces discipline 
for the allegations made in the Notice of Protest, not for his arguments in the underlying litigation that the court lacked jurisdiction because of the continued existence of the Kingdom of Hawai'i, an argument which, if successful, could achieve an 
articulable objective for his client, i.e., dismissal of the litigation. See ODC v. Burgess, No. 12608 (August 3, 1988) 
(drawing a similar distinction and imposing a public censure for 
Burgess’s personal denial of the de jure  legitimacy of the 
government of the State of Hawai' i and its courts, in so doing 
repudiating his oath taken upon admission to the bar). By 
contrast, the allegations for which Respondent Kaiama faces 
4
 discipline do not serve any discernible purpose within the
 
underlying litigation and, hence, cannot be characterized as mere
 ‘zealous representation’ of the Respondent’s clients. Nor do the
 allegations bear a rational relationship to any previous opinions
 of this or other courts of the State and, hence, are not good
 faith arguments for an extension of such precedent. Nor was the
 filing of the Notice justified for any other proper purpose: 
Respondent Kaiama does not offer any specific evidence, cite to
 any court rule or procedure of any other fora, or articulate any
 reasonable legal theory to support his assertion that filing the
 Notice of Protest was necessary to preserve the issue for review
 by another forum. In short, we conclude that the allegations
 serve no other purpose but to harass the presiding Judge by
 threatening him with dire consequences for his previous and
 subsequent rulings in the litigation. 
Respondent Kaiama’s conduct warrants suspension, absent
 
mitigating circumstances. See American Bar Association Standards
 
for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (2000), Standards 6.22 and 6.32;
 ODC v. Ng, SCAD-12-414 (March 1, 2013); ODC v. Shea, SCAD-11-777
 (May 1, 2012); see also ODC v. Cook, No. 28300 (March 6, 2007);
 Gardner, 793 N.E.2d at 424, Sandlin, 12 F.3d at 862-63, 867; Cf.
 Westfall, 808 S.W.2d at 838. 
We find, in aggravation, that Respondent Kaiama has
 
substantial experience in the practice of law while, in
 mitigation, we find Respondent Kaiama has a clean disciplinary
 
5
 record, his conduct was absent a dishonest or selfish motive, and
 
he was fully cooperative with the disciplinary proceedings. 
Therefore, in light of the mitigating factors, which outweigh
 those in aggravation,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Kaiama is publicly
 
censured for his misconduct. Respondent Kaiama is, however,
 cautioned that further such conduct may result in a period of
 suspension.
 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that Respondent Kaiama shall bear
 
the costs of the disciplinary proceedings upon the approval of a
 timely-submitted verified bill of costs from the Office of
 Disciplinary Counsel.
