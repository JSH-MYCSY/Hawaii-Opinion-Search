IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I
 
IKE EMANUEL DURU,
Petitioner,
 
vs.
 OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL,
Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(Prior Supreme Court No. 27356; ODC Case No. 05-031-8183)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION
 
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the Disciplinary Board’s Report
 
and Recommendation to Deny Reinstatement of Petitioner Ike
 
Emmanuel Duru and the record in this matter, we find and
 conclude, after careful and thorough review, that Petitioner Duru
 failed to follow court rules governing his disbarment,
 particularly in his failure to inform his Maui employer or the
 Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) of his foreign disbarment,
 and failed to fulfill substantive conditions of this court’s
 November 10, 2005 reciprocal disbarment, particularly his failure
 to successfully seek reinstatement in Georgia. 
We further find and conclude that Respondent Duru has 
failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence, as required by 
Rule 2.17(b)(4) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai'i, that he is rehabilitated from the ethical conduct 
underlying that disbarment, particularly his engaging in discussion of legal matters with a licensed attorney and the attorney’s client, his failure to report in his petition criminal and civil litigation in which he was involved during his disbarment, and his failure to timely act with initiative regarding his outstanding student loan obligations. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition is denied.
 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Petitioner Duru shall bear
 
the expenses incurred in the investigation into and processing of
 his petition, upon the timely submission of a verified bill of
 costs by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, February 21, 2017.
