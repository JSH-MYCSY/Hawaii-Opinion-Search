OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL,
Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
KENDAL A. LUKE,
Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC 15-046-9265)
 
ORDER OF REINSTATEMENT
 
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the June 19, 2017 petition and
 
affidavit submitted by Respondent Kendal A. Luke, and the record,
 
we conclude Respondent Luke has complied with the requirements of
 Rule 2.16 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of
 Hawai'i (RSCH), as well as all relevant requirements currently 
due in the February 17, 2017 order imposing upon him a 90-day
 period of suspension from the practice of law. Furthermore, it
 appears that, on June 19, 2017, the Office of Disciplinary
 Counsel was served notice of Respondent Lukeâ€™s petition and
 affidavit, as required by RSCH Rule 2.17(b)(2), and has not 
 objected. We note Respondent Luke has until February 16, 2018 to
 
submit to this court a successful score in the Multistate
 Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, pursuant to RSCH Rule
 
2.17(b), Respondent Luke is reinstated to the practice of law in
 this jurisdiction, effective upon entry of this order.
 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that Respondent Luke is reminded
 
that failure to timely submit a successful MPRE result to this
 court may result in an additional period of suspension, upon a
 review of the record.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, July 11, 2017.
