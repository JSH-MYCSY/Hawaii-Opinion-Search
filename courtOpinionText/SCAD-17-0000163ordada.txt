SCAD-17-0000163 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
In re: Application for the Reinstatement of 
JO-ANN MARIE ADAMS, 
Respondent. 
ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.
and Intermediate Court of Appeals Associate Judge Reifurth,
in place of McKenna, J., recused) 
Upon consideration of the May 12, 2019 affidavit 
regarding reinstatement submitted by Respondent Jo-Ann Adams, the 
report filed on May 15, 2019, the memorandum filed by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel on May 17, 2019, and the record in this matter, it appears Respondent Adams has complied with all relevant requirements upon which her one-year period of suspension from the practice of law is contingent, has paid all required fees, and has complied with the requirements of Rule 2.16 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of 
Hawai# i 
(RSCH), though we note Respondent Adams still must complete an audit of her practice within one year from the entry date of this order and submit to this court proof of a successful completion 
of that audit within 60 days thereafter, as provided by the March 7, 2018 order of suspension.  It further appears the Office of Disciplinary Counsel was served notice of the affidavit, as required by RSCH Rule 2.17, and does not take issue with any facts asserted in Respondent Adamsâ€™s affidavit.  Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, pursuant to RSCH Rule 
2.17(b), Respondent Adams is reinstated to the practice of law in the jurisdiction of the State of Hawai# i, effective upon entry of 
this order, contingent upon her proper registration and payment of required dues to the Hawai# i
 State Bar Association, pursuant 
to RSCH Rule 17(d). 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, May 28, 2019.
