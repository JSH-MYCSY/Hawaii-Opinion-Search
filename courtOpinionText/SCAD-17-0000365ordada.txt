ORDER OF SUSPENSION
  
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the petition submitted on 
April 24, 2017 by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC),
 
requesting the immediate suspension of Respondent Venetia
 Carpenter-Asui from the practice of law pursuant to Rule 2.12A of
 the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i (RSCH), 
the declaration and exhibits attached thereto, and the record, we
 find Respondent Carpenter-Asui has failed to meaningfully or
 substantively respond to lawful requests from ODC regarding its
 investigations into alleged misconduct committed by her, or to
 respond to this courtâ€™s May 8, 2017 order to show cause as to why
 she should not be immediately suspended for the above conduct. 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.12A,
 
Respondent Carpenter-Asui is suspended from the practice of law. 
This order is effective immediately and until further order of
 this court.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this order imposing 
suspension upon Respondent Carpenter-Asui shall constitute a suspension for purposes of RSCH Rule 2.16. The Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i and Respondent 
Carpenter-Asui shall therefore comply with the relevant requirements of that Rule. 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that the Clerk shall forthwith
 
distribute a copy of this order to all judges, pursuant to RSCH
 Rule 2.16(f). Distribution may be by electronic mail.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, June 8, 2017.
