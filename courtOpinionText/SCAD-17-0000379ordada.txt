ORDER OF SUSPENSION 
 
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the petition submitted on May 2,
 
2017 by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC), requesting the
 
immediate suspension of Respondent Dean T. Kauka from the
 practice of law pursuant to Rule 2.12A of the Rules of the
 Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i (RSCH), the declaration and 
exhibits attached thereto, and the record, we find Respondent
 Kauka has failed to meaningfully or substantively respond to
 lawful requests from ODC regarding its investigations into
 alleged misconduct committed by him, or to respond by the May 31,
 2017 deadline to this courtâ€™s May 10, 2017 order to show cause as
 to why he should not be immediately suspended for the above
 
conduct. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.12A,
 
Respondent Kauka is suspended from the practice of law. This
 order is effective immediately and until further order of this
 court.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this order imposing 
suspension upon Respondent Kauka shall constitute a suspension for purposes of RSCH Rule 2.16. The Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i and Respondent Kauka shall 
therefore comply with the relevant requirements of that Rule. 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that the Clerk shall forthwith
 
distribute a copy of this order to all judges, pursuant to RSCH
 Rule 2.16(f). Distribution may be by electronic mail.
