IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL,
Petitioner, 
vs. 
JAMES S. RICHARDS,
Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(ODC 17-0-198) 
ORDER OF DISBARMENT 
(By:  Recktenwald,  C.J.,  Nakayama,  McKenna,  Pollack,  and  Wilson,  JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the April 17, 2019 motion for the 
reciprocal disbarment of Respondent James S. Richards, filed by 
the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) pursuant to Rule 2.15(b) 
of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai# i (RSCH), 
the May 1, 2019 notice and order entered by this court, and the record in this matter, we find that, on September 27, 2018, the 
Supreme Court of the State of California entered an order, 
disbarring Respondent Richards, based upon Richardsâ€™s conviction 
for willfully attempting to evade the payment of federal income 
taxes for the years 1994 through 2003, and engaging in conduct 
involving intentional dishonesty and concealment, conduct which, 
if committed in this jurisdiction, would constitute violations of Rules 8.4(b) and 8.4(c) of the Hawai# i Rules of Professional 
Conduct (2014).  We further find that the record in this matter 
establishes that service of the May 1, 2019 Notice and Order was 
properly made upon Respondent Richards on May 2, 2019 at the 
address Respondent Richards has registered with the 
Hawai# i State 
Bar Association for service of process and, therefore, that Respondent Richards had until June 3, 2019 to show cause as to 
why his disbarment in this jurisdiction is unwarranted. 
Respondent Richards has not responded to the Notice and Order, 
and a review of the record and precedent demonstrates, pursuant 
to RSCH Rules 2.15(c) and (d), that reciprocal discipline is 
authorized and justified.  Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent James S. Richards 
is disbarred from the practice of law in this jurisdiction, 
pursuant to RSCH Rules 2.3(a)(1) and 2.15(c).  Furthermore, RSCH 
Rule 2.16(c) notwithstanding, insofar as the record indicates 
Respondent Richards has been restrained from practice in this 
jurisdiction since January 18, 2018, the disbarment shall be 
effective immediately upon entry of this order. 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that Respondent Richards is 
reminded he may not resume the practice of law in this 
jurisdiction until reinstated by order of this court. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 26, 2019.
