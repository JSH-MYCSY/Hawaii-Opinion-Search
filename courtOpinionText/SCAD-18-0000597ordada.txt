IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL,
Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
JOSEPH C. LEHMAN,
Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(ODC 18-0082)
  
ORDER OF DISBARMENT
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the Office of Disciplinary
 
Counsel’s July 27, 2018 petition for issuance of a reciprocal
 
discipline notice to Respondent Joseph C. Lehman, pursuant to
 
Rule 2.15(b) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of
 
Hawai'i (RSCH), the memorandum, affidavit, and exhibits appended 
thereto, the August 21, 2018 Notice of Reciprocal Discipline
 issued by this court, and Respondent Lehman’s October 16, 2018
 
submission to this court in response, we note that, on July 21,
 
2016, the Supreme Court of Indiana disbarred Respondent Lehman
 
for practicing law while suspended. Such conduct, if committed
 
in this jurisdiction, would result in disbarment or a substantial
 
additional period of suspension. See ODC v. Au, SCAD-13-911
 (January 21, 2014); ODC v. Morikawa, Case No. 18999 (July 19,
 
2010). Finally, we find no support in the record for any of the
 
exceptions set forth in RSCH Rule 2.15(c) that would warrant
 
imposition of any discipline aside from disbarment in this
 
jurisdiction. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Joseph C. Lehman
 
is disbarred, pursuant to RSCH Rules 2.3(a)(1) and 2.15(c),
 
effective upon entry of this order.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Lehman shall, in
 
accordance with RSCH Rule 2.16(d), file with this court, within
 
10 days of the entry date of this order, an affidavit showing
 
compliance with RSCH Rule 2.16(d). 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Lehman shall bear
 
the costs of these reciprocal proceedings, pursuant to RSCH Rule
 
2.3(c), upon the timely submission of a verified bill of costs by
 
the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.
 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that Respondent Lehman shall not
 
resume the practice of law in this jurisdiction until re-admitted
 
by order of this court, as set forth in RSCH Rules 2.17(a) and
 
2.17(b)(1). Any application for reinstatement shall include
 
proof of readmission to, and good standing with, the Indiana
 
State Bar.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 25, 2018.
