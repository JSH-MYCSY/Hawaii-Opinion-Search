DISCIPLINARY BOARD OF THE HAWAI# I SUPREME COURT,
Petitioner,

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(ODC 16-O-420) 
ORDER OF TRANSFER TO INACTIVE STATUS 
(By:  Recktenwald,  C.J.,  Nakayama,  McKenna,  Pollack,  and  Wilson,  JJ.) 
Upon review of the April 29, 2019 petition filed by the 
Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai# i, 
requesting this court to immediately transfer Respondent Harry E. 
Eliason to inactive status, pursuant to Rule 2.19(b) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai# i (RSCH), we conclude 
interim transfer to inactive status is warranted. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Eliason is 
immediately transferred to inactive status in this jurisdiction, pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.19(c), effective with the filing of this order. Respondent Eliason shall remain on inactive status until further order of this court but may, at his discretion, apply to 
this court for a return to active status, pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.19(f), upon submission of evidence that he is fit to resume the practice of law. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Office of Disciplinary 
Counsel (ODC) shall suspend and hold in abeyance proceedings against Respondent Eliason to the extent required by RSCH Rule 2.19(h). 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Disciplinary Board 
shall, pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.19(d), cause a notice of this transfer to inactive status to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the judicial circuit in which Respondent Eliason maintained his practice. 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that the clerk of the court, 
pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.19(e), shall transmit a certified copy of this order to all judges of the State of 
Hawai# i and shall 
request their assistance and such action as may be indicated to protect the interests of both Respondent Eliason and his clients. 
DATED: Honolulu, 
Hawai# i, May 6, 2019.
