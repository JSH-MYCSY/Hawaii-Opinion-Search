vs. 
 
SUZANNE T. TERADA, 
Respondent.  
   
 
 ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(ODC NOS. 16- O-008, 16-O- 049, 16-O -365)  
 
 ORDER OF SUSPENSION 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, J., 
and Circuit Judge Ochiai, in place of Mckenna, J., recused, 
with Pollack, J., dissenting, with whom Wilson, J., joins) 
 
Upon consideration of the June 3, 2019 report of the 
Disciplinary Board of the Hawaii Supreme Cou rt, the briefing 
submitted by Respondent Suzanne T. Terada and the Office of 
Disciplinary Counsel (ODC), and the record in this matter, we 
make the following Findings of Fact by clear and convincing 
evidence, and reach the following Conclusions.  
In ODC Case No. 16 -O-008, we find that the record 
contains sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the Office of 
Disciplinary Counsel failed to carry its burden of demonstrating Electronically Filed
Supreme Court

 2 that Respondent Terada failed to explain the purpose of the 
$25,000.00 paid by her clien t into her client trust account, to 
be held in contingency for the final costs associated with the 
closure of the estate of the client =s mother.  In all other 
respects, we confirm the Findings of the Disciplinary Board in 
its report.  We therefore conclude  that, in Case No. 16 -O-008, 
Respondent Terada =s conduct violated Rules 1.3, 1.4(a)(2), 
1.4(a)(3), 1.4(a)(4), 1.15(d), and 1.16(d) of the Hawaii Rules 
of Professional Conduct (HRPC) (2014).  
In Case No. 16 -O-049, we confirm the Findings of the 
Disciplinary  Board in its report, and therefore conclude the 
Respondent =s conduct violated HRPC Rules 1.15(d), 1.15(e), and 
8.4(c). 
In Case No. 16 -O-365, we confirm the Findings of the 
Disciplinary Board and conclude that Respondent Terada =s conduct 
therefore violated  HRPC Rules 1.1, 1.4(a)(3), 1.4(a)(4), 
1.16(d), and 8.4(c), but also conclude a review of the record 
demonstrates, as alleged by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, 
that the Respondent signed an affidavit that she knew did not 
represent the truth and knew,  or should have known, that it 
would be submitted to the bankruptcy court, in violation of HRPC 
Rule 3.3(a)(1).  
In particular, we note the Board =s Finding, based upon 
the Hearing Officer =s role as finder of fact, that the Respondent 
acted with wilful inten t in two of the client matters, and 
caused, or threatened to cause, financial and other injuries to 
all three clients.  Absent mitigating circumstances, such 
conduct warrants disbarment.  See, e.g., ODC v. Cusmano , No. 
22770 (January 5, 2000).  
In aggravati on, we find that Respondent =s conduct  
 3 evinced a pattern of misconduct (of delay, a refusal to act with 
diligence, and a refusal to communicate with others), multiple 
offenses, deceptive conduct during the disciplinary proceedings, 
and a refusal to acknowle dge the wrongful nature of her conduct.  
We also find one of her clients was vulnerable, and that she has 
substantial experience in the practice of law.  
In mitigation, we find the Respondent has a strong 
record of community service, has a clean disciplinar y record, 
and bore extraordinary personal stressors during the relevant 
time that were a factor in her failure to communicate or act 
with diligence, and which mitigate against a more severe 
discipline.  Nevertheless, we conclude a period of suspension is 
warranted.   Therefore,  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Suzanne Terada is 
suspended from the practice of law for a period of eighteen 
months, effective 30 days after the entry date of this order, as 
provided by Rules 2.3(a)(2) and 2.16(c) of the Rules of the 
Supreme Court of the State of Hawaii (RSCH).  
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Terada shall, 
within 10 days after the effective date of her suspension, file 
with this court an affidavit that she has fully complied with 
RSCH Rule 2.16(d).  
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Terada shall 
complete an audit of her practice, by the Practicing Attorney 
Liability Management Society or similar organization, within 60 
days of the commencement of her suspension and shall file a 
declaration with ODC and the Disciplinary Board within 30 days 
after completion of the audit, attesting to its successful 
completion, though an extension shall be available based upon 
demonstration of good cause.   
 4 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Terada shall 
bear the cost of the disciplinary proceedings, upon approval by 
this court of a timely filed verified bill of costs from ODC, 
pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.3(c).  
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaii, June 29, 2020.
