ORDER
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Wilson, JJ.,
and Intermediate Court of Appeals Associate Judge Leonard,
assigned by reason of vacancy)
Upon consideration of the November 6, 2020 motion for
reconsideration filed by Respondent Gary Dubin and the exhibits
and declaration accompanying it, alleging this court has
improperly relied upon an ex parte record to impose disbarment
upon him and seeking an order dismissing these disciplinary

Dkt. 304 ODMRdisbarment date filed by attorney Keith M. Kiuchi, we reiterate
that the disposition of this matter was based solely and
exclusively upon the record of the four cases from the Office of
Disciplinary Counsel listed in the caption of the disbarment
order, a record which provided ample evidence supporting
Respondent Dubin’s disbarment, and expressly state that no ex
parte communications or exchanges of any variety occurred in the
disposition of this matter. 
We note that this court afforded Respondent Dubin 60
days to complete the closure of his law practice and that neither
Respondent Dubin nor attorney Kiuchi offers compelling evidence
as to why this period of time was insufficient for Respondent
Dubin to inform clients of his disbarment and arrange for the
return of their client files or the transfer of those files to
associate, or other, counsel, pursuant to his duties under Rule
2.16 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai#i
(RSCH) and to the authorization and duties under Rule 1.16(d) of
the Hawai#i Rules of Professional Conduct (HRPC).
In addition, attorney Kiuchi’s submission indicates
that a transfer of the law practice from Respondent Dubin to
Kiuchi, pursuant to HRPC Rule 1.17, may have already occurred,
obviating the need for the involvement of this court.
Therefore,
2IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Respondent Dubin’s motion for
reconsideration is denied.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that attorney Kiuchi’s motion for
an extension of the effective date of Respondent Dubin’s
disbarment is denied.  Insofar as the effective date of
Respondent Dubin’s disbarment remains November 9, 2020,
Respondent Dubin is now disbarred from the practice of law and is
bound by the duties and limitations imposed upon him by RSCH Rule
2.16, particularly, in light of attorney Kiuchi’s submission, the
duties imposed by RSCH Rule 2.16(h).  Respondent Dubin may only
assist attorney Kiuchi to the extent that Dubin’s conduct does
not constitute the practice of law. See HRS § 605-14 (2016); RSCH
Rules 2.16 and 2.17(a); HRPC Rule 5.5.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, November 10, 2020.
