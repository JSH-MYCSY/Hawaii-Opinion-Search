Dkt. 68 ORD2 
 attorney Fukumoto, and the record in this matter, we conclude 
Trustee Hebblethwaite has completed his duties in this 
trusteeship and that the fees he requests  are for work 
reasonable in duration and related to the duties of the 
trusteeship.  We find the value of the computer which is the 
subject of ODC’s motion to be less than $50.00 and, pursuant to 
RSCH Rule 2.20(d)(2)(F) (2021) , subject to destruction.  We 
further conclude that requiring attorney Fukumoto to be 
responsible for the total expenses incurred by this trusteeship 
is warranted and authorized by RSCH Rule 2.20(d) (2019) and RSCH 
Rule 2.20(e)(2021).  Therefore,  
  IT IS HEREBY ORDER ED that Trustee Hebblethwaite’s 
report is approved, and his motion for discharge is granted.   As 
a final duty, T rustee Hebblethwaite shall transfer control of 
the two client trust accounts from attorney Fukumoto’s practice, 
maintained at First Hawaiian Ban k and ending in x1593 and x0496, 
to ODC, which shall maintain them until either a valid request 
for the funds therein is approved by this court or until the 
contents are ripe for a determination that they be declared 
abandoned and can escheat to the state, afte r December 15, 2024.  
  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Disciplinary Board 
shall pay  Trustee Hebblethwaite , within 30 days of the entry 
date of this order, $1,764.00 in fees and $83.12 in General 3 
 
Excise Tax, calculated at the Oahu rate of 4.712%, for a tot al 
of $1,847.12 . 
  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that ODC may, pursuant to RSCH 
Rule 2.20(d)(2)(F), dispose of the computer described in its 
October 22, 2021 submission, according to its standard 
procedures for disposing of outdated technology.  
  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that  ODC may submit a renewed 
motion for an order and judgment against attorney Fukumoto, 
which shall include a full summary of expenses incurred by the 
Disciplinary Board and ODC in this matter.
