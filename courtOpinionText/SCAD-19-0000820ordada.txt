Respondent.
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(ODC Case No. 19-0539)
ORDER OF SUSPENSION
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the petition for issuance of a
reciprocal discipline notice upon Respondent Lawrence Jacob Song,
filed on November 21, 2019 by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
pursuant to Rule 2.15(b) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the
State of Hawai#i (RSCH), the declaration and exhibits appended
thereto, the December 3, 2019 order entered by this court,
providing Respondent Song 30 days from the date of service of
that order upon him to submit to this court any reasons why
reciprocal discipline should not be imposed upon him, and his
lack of response to that order by the January 6, 2020 deadline
established by the record, we conclude the imposition of a period
of suspension similar to the period imposed by the California
Supreme Court upon Respondent Song is warranted.  Therefore,Electronically Filed
