ORDER
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the report, submitted on June 24,
2021 by Bradley Tamm of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC),
as Trustee, pursuant to Rule 2.20 of the Rules of the Supreme
Court of the State of Hawai ʻi (RSCH), over the solo legal
practice of deceased attorney Wesley Y.S. Chang, and the record
in this matter, we conclude that nothing further remains for
Trustee Tamm to do in this trusteeship, and that the remaining
funds in Chang’s former client trust account at Bank of Hawaii,
ending in x4207, will, on June 18, 2023, be ripe for a motion
that they be declared abandoned and to escheat to the state,
pursuant to HRS Ch. 523A.  Therefore,Electronically Filed
