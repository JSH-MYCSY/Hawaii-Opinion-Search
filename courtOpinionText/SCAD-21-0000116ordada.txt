(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the March 9, 2021 report,
submitted by the Disciplinary Board of the Hawai ʻi Supreme Court
and the declarations and exhibits appended thereto, and the
arguments of both Respondent Frederick J. Arensmeyer and the
Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) presented in the briefs, and
after a 
de novo review of the record, we find the record does not
establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent
Arensmeyer, through his initial responses to ODC’s inquiries into
allegations of misconduct committed by a different attorney,
knowingly created a misapprehension on ODC’s part that hinderedElectronically Filed
