Dkt. 160 ORD2 
 the following provisions of the Hawaiʻi Rules of Professional 
Conduct (HRPC) (2014), in the following manner.  
  The Respondent’s conduct at the March 23, 2022 hearing 
in Kaupo Ranch v. Smith, 2CCV-21-0000255 (hereinafter “ Kaupo 
Ranch”), at the March 24, 2022 hearing in Loquet v. Livesay, 
2DSS-22-0000058, and his conduct at the March 23, 2022 hearing 
in Bank of New York Mellon v.  Akahi, 2CC181000483 , demonstrate a 
failure of the duty of competence owed to those clients, in 
violation of HRPC Rule 1.1, and his conduct at the latter two 
hearings constitutes a failure of the duty of diligence owed to 
his clients, in violation of HRPC Rule 1.3.  
  The Respo ndent, during the March 23, 2022 hearing in 
Kaupo Ranch , engaged in argument which we conclude was wholly 
frivolous, in violation of HRPC Rule 3.1.  
  At the January 12, 2021 hearing i n Deutsche Bank 
National Trust Co. v. Russo , 2CC141000126 (hereinafter “ Russo”), 
the Respondent refused to cease interrupting opposing counsel, 
and, at the March 23, 2022 hearing in Kaupo Ranch , the 
Respondent  refused to obey the court’s directives to limit 
himself to legal argument, and to cease speaking when directed 
to do so  by the court, thereby, on these occasions, knowingly 
refusing to obey an obligation under the rules of a tribunal, in 
violation of HRPC Rule 3.4(e).  3 
   The Respondent, on March 5, 2022, sent an email 
directed at a fellow attorney, wherein he threatened to present 
criminal charges against the attorney for, we conclude, the sole 
purpose of obtaining an advantage in a civil matter, in 
violation of HRPC Rule 3.4(i).  
  The Respondent, at the January 12, 2021 hearing in the 
Russo litigation, spoke in a loud and a ggressive manner to the 
presiding judge, and threatened the judge, and, at the March 23, 
2022 hearing in the Kaupo Ranch litigation, yelled at the 
presiding judge and made a series of condescending and 
disrespectful statements directed at the judge, which we 
conclude constituted harassment of the presiding judges, in 
violation of HRPC Rule 3.5(b).  
  By engaging in the conduct described immediately 
above, and by, at the January 12, 2021 hearing in the Russo 
litigation, yelling and interrupting opposing counsel, the 
Respondent engaged in conduct we conclude was reasonably likely 
to disrupt a tribunal, in violation of HRPC Rule 3.5(c).  
  The Respondent, in a March 25, 2022 email transmitted 
to opposing counsel following a deposit ion, employed means, in 
the course of representing a client, which we conclude had no 
substantial purpose other than to embarrass or burden the 
recipient attorney, in violation of HRPC Rule 4.4(a).  4 
   The Respondent, we conclude, provided legal services 
to clients, both pro bono  and for money, while suspended from 
practice, and thereby engaged in the unauthorized practice of 
law in this jurisdiction, in violation of its regulations 
governing the practice of law, in violation of HRPC Rule 5.5(a).  
  The Respon dent advertised legal services while 
suspended from practice which, we conclude, contained material 
misrepresentations or omissions of fact regarding his licensure 
to practice law, in violation of HRPC Rule 7.1(a).  
  The Respondent, by advertising as a “Ce rtified Legal 
Consultant” during the period of suspension, implied he could 
achieve results in the courts by means that would violate the 
HRPC and relevant law, in violation of HRPC Rule 7.1(b).  
  The Respondent, in advertisements posted during his 
suspension, held himself out as a “Certified Legal Consultant” 
without providing the basis for such a certification, and, in 
doing so, failed to therefore include language in the 
advertisement required by HRPC Rule 7.4(d), in violation of HRPC 
Rule 7.4(d).  
  The Respondent informed the Office of Disciplinary 
Counsel that his New Jersey law license was inactive when, at 
the time, it was, in fact, active, which we conclude was a false 5 
 statement made to a disciplinary authority, in violation of HRPC 
Rule 8.1(a).  
  We accept the factors both in aggravation and 
mitigation to which the parties have stipulated.  
  We conclude that, absent the mitigating factors, the 
misconduct committed by the Respondent warrants, at a minimum, a 
two-year suspension from the practice of la w. See, e.g., ODC v. 
Au, SCAD-13-911 (January 21, 2014); ODC v. Tagupa , No. 26762 
(March 24, 2016); ODC v. Hicks , No. 23372 (January 20, 2006); 
ODC v. Verdin , No. 22349 (September 13, 2001).  However, in 
light of the mitigating factors, we conclude that ado pting the 
recommendation of the Board, to accept the proposed discipline 
to which the parties have stipulated, is warranted.  Therefore,  
  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Respondent, Michael J. 
Collins XXVII, is suspended for two years from the practice of 
law. 
  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this two -year suspension is 
stayed for a two -year probationary period, effective upon entry 
of this order, during which the Respondent is required to fully 
comply with the conditions of probation as agreed upon by the 
parties, as set forth at Docket 140:70 -74 and Docket 152:1 -5. 
  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Respondent is hereby 
notified that failure to fully comply with the terms of the 6 
 
probation may result in revocation of the stay and the 
imposition of the two -year sus pension from practice.  
  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Respondent shall bear 
the costs of these disciplinary proceedings, upon approval by 
this court of a timely filed Verified Bill of Costs submitted by 
the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, pursuant to Rul e 2.3(c) of 
the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawaiʻi.
