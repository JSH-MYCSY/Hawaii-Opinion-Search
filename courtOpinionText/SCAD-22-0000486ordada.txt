Dkt. 111 OSUSmatter, we find that Respondent Crowell has failed to respond to
four separate subpoenas lawfully issued by ODC, pursuant to RSCH
Rule 2.12, and that therefore grounds exist for the granting of
the petition.  See RSCH Rule 2.12A(a).  Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, pursuant RSCH Rule 2.12A,
Respondent Crowell is suspended from the practice of law.  This
order is effective immediately and until further order of this
court.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this order imposing
suspension upon Respondent Crowell shall constitute a suspension
for purposes of RSCH Rule 2.16.  The Disciplinary Board of the
Hawai#i Supreme Court and Respondent Crowell shall therefore
comply with the relevant requirements of that Rule.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk of the court,
pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.16(f), shall promptly transmit by
electronic means a copy of this order to all judges of the State
of Hawai# i. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, December 15, 2022.
