Dkt. 21 OSUS2 
 Respondent Allen does not oppose the imposition of reciprocal 
discipline, and the record in this matter, we conclude the 
record submitted supports the imposition of a two-year 
reciprocal suspension in this jurisdiction.  W e note Respondent 
Allen remains administratively suspended in this jurisdiction.  
Finally, we note that previous attempts at service to Respondent 
Allen’s address registered with the Hawai ʻi State B
ar Association 
have been unsuccessful, and note ODC has identified an alternate 
address in California, and an email address, for communication 
with Allen.  Therefore,  
  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for reciprocal
discipline is granted.   
  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Allen is 
suspended from the practice of law in this jurisdiction for two
years, effective upon entry of this order, RSCH Rule 2.16(c) 
notwithstanding, in light of his current administrative 
suspension.  Respondent Allen shall, however, file an affidavit
or declaration, within 40 days of the entry date of this order,
complying with the requirements of RSCH Rule 2.16(d).   
 
 
  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Allen shall bear 
the costs of this reciprocal disciplinary proceeding upon the 
approval of a timely submitted Verified Bill of Costs, pursuant 
to RSCH Rule 2.3(c), and shall be required to submit, as a 
prerequisite to reinstatement, proof of payment of any such bill 3 
  
of costs and proof of his compliance with the disciplinary 
conditions imposed upon him in Colorado and his reinstatement to
good standing in that jurisdiction.   
  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Disciplinary Board of 
the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court shall comply with RSCH Rule 2.16(e) 
with regard to general notice of Allen’s suspension, and the 
clerk of the court shall comply with RSCH Rule 2.16(f) regarding 
the notice to the judges of the State of Hawaiʻi. 
  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, pursuant to RSCH Rule 
2.11(b), the clerk shall serve the instant  order and any future 
documents on Respondent Allen at the California address and, as 
a courtesy, the email address found at Docket 3:3 in the record.
