WITH RECKTENWALD, C.J., CONCURRING IN PART; 
AND GINOZA, J., CONCURRING SEPARATELY 
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J. 
In this disciplinary proceeding, we find no Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Professional Conduct (HRPC) violation. Thus, we dismiss the 
Office of Disciplinary Counsel’s (ODC) amended petition filed 
against Mark Zenger.  
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
I. 
Opposing counsel, Stacey Joroff, filed a disciplinary 
complaint against Zenger. Joroff represented a wife and Zenger 
a husband in a Family Court of the Fifth Circuit divorce case. 
After a disciplinary board member approved initiation of 
formal disciplinary proceedings, ODC filed a petition for 
discipline and summons in August 2019. See Rules of the 
Disciplinary Board (DBR) Rule 19(a) (“Counsel shall institute a 
Formal Disciplinary Proceeding when: (a) a Formal Disciplinary 
Proceeding is approved or ordered by a Reviewing Board Member[.]”). Then ODC filed an amended petition in October 
2019. 
ODC’s amended petition alleged that Zenger’s language in a 
memorandum in opposition constituted misconduct. ODC said that 
“[Zenger’s memorandum] characterized the opposing party and her 
counsel’s tactics as ‘sleazy[,]’ ‘sneaky[,]’ ‘engaged in an evil 
and intentional plan[,]’ a ‘hissy fit[,]’ and handled with ‘absolute neglect.’” ODC also alleged misconduct at a February 
28, 2018 chambers conference before Family Court Judge Edmund 
Acoba. ODC said that during the chambers conference, Zenger 
raised his voice, used profanity, called Joroff “sneaky,” 
“slimy,” and “sleazy,” and “loomed over Joroff and pointed his 
finger at her.” 
2  
  
 
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
ODC maintained that Zenger’s conduct violated HRPC Rules 
4.4(a) and 3.5(c). 
HRPC Rule 4.4(a) reads: 
In representing a client, a lawyer shall not use means that 
have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, 
or burden a third person, or use methods of obtaining 
evidence that violate the legal rights of such a person. 
HRPC Rule 3.5(c) reads: “A lawyer shall not engage in 
conduct intended or reasonably likely to disrupt a tribunal.” 
Zenger, an attorney since 1983 with a spotless professional 
record, denied violating the rules of professional conduct. 
Seasoned Honolulu attorney David Lum (hearing officer) 
presided over the disciplinary hearing. 
In October 2020, Zenger 
moved to dismiss the amended petition’s allegations that words 
in his memorandum violated ethical rules. Zenger maintained, 
among other things, that his statements were protected by the 
litigation privilege and the constitutional right to free 
speech.  He said that he “at worst, engaged in rhetorical 
hyperbole, which is considered to be non-defamatory and fully 
protected by the First Amendment freedom of speech.” 
In February 2021, the hearing officer recommended that the 
Board Chair grant Zenger’s motion to dismiss. In April 2021, 
the Disciplinary Board denied Zenger’s motion and remanded the case to Hearing Officer Lum for further proceedings. See DBR 
Rule 4(a) (“The Chairperson approves the filing and dismissal of all petitions[.]”) It reasoned that the litigation privilege 
3  
   
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
immunized Zenger in litigation, but not from possible discipline 
for professional misconduct, and that constitutional free-speech 
provisions did not foreclose disciplinary proceedings. 
After the Board returned the case to the hearing officer, a 
hearing ensued. It spanned six days. Joroff, Zenger, and Judge 
Acoba testified. Zenger called Judge Acoba’s court clerk.  And 
he also called character witnesses Peter C. Wolff, former 
Federal Public Defender, and Trudy K. Senda, retired Fifth Circuit district court judge. 
The hearing officer ruled in Zenger’s favor. ODC had 
failed to clearly and convincingly show an HRPC violation. In 
November 2022, the hearing officer filed Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law, and Recommendations for Discipline. 
Next, we detail the material factual findings and legal 
conclusions. 
The “hotly contested” divorce case involved custody and 
visitation, and financial-related issues. The parties attended mediation. They appeared to agree on custody and visitation. 
Property division and other matters concerning their children 
remained unresolved. On February 7, 2018, Joroff emailed 
Zenger, informing him that she would prepare a stipulation 
regarding custody and visitation. If Husband signed off, Joroff 
communicated, then her client would withdraw an upcoming motion 
for pre-decree relief. 
4  
   
  
    
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In her email, Joroff wrote that she understood that Husband 
wanted to keep the home; therefore, an appraisal would need to 
be completed to determine the buyout amount. Joroff requested 
the most recent mortgage statement. Zenger did not reply to the 
email. Joroff did not send a draft stipulation. 
On February 20, 2018, Joroff moved for an Immediate Sale 
and/or Order for Appraisal of Real Property. Without alerting 
Zenger, she sought and received a “quick answer” hearing date -February 28, 2018. Joroff declared: “[Husband] has stated that 
he wishes to buy [Wife] out of the property . . . [Wife] 
requests that an appraisal be ordered by the court with 
[Husband] paying for the appraisal since he is saying he wants 
to buy [Wife] out.” Yet during litigation, Husband made no such 
representation. Hearing Officer Lum later found that “Ms. 
Joroff had no factual basis for her Declaration statement that 
[Husband] stated wanting to buy [Wife] out of the property. The 
statement was false because the only information she received was from [the mediator] telling her in mediation that [Husband] 
wanted to retain the home.”  Joroff served Husband by U.S. mail. 
On February 26, 2018, Zenger filed Husband’s memorandum in 
opposition to the motion. He disputed Joroff’s assertion that 
Husband wanted to buy Wife’s interest in the home. He explained 
that Wife had “arbitrarily short set” the hearing, and served 
the motion by “snail mail” on Zenger. Zenger wrote: “[Wife] did 
5  
   
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
all of these sneaky, sleazy things as part and parcel of an evil 
and intentional plan to ‘sandbag’ [Husband] and give him a very 
short time within which to file a cogent opposition.” Zenger 
described Wife’s actions as a “hissy fit” in retaliation for 
Husband’s unwillingness to provide the mortgage information 
demanded in Joroff’s February 7 email. 
Right before the February 28 court hearing on the motion 
for property appraisal and sale, Judge Acoba summoned Zenger and Joroff to his chambers. As they sat, Joroff served Zenger with 
an unfiled copy of Wife’s motion to set trial. It already had a 
hearing date, March 7, 2018. Judge Acoba asked the lawyers for 
the number of witnesses they aspired to call at trial. The 
court focused on matters relating to the motion to set and 
trial, and not the short-set hearing. 
Zenger voiced displeasure about discussing an unfiled 
motion that he had just received. As for that day’s hearing, 
neither Judge Acoba nor Joroff had read Husband’s memo in opposition. The hearing officer added, Joroff “never filed a 
reply to address these words[.]” And he found that “[p]rior to 
her formal [disciplinary] hearing testimony, [Joroff] had never 
complained about or otherwise objected to [Zenger’s] use of” 
words in the memorandum that the ODC alleged violated the 
ethical rules (“hissy fit,” “sneaky,” “sleazy,” “evil and 
intentional plan,” and “abject neglect”). 
6  
     
  
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Joroff’s ODC complaint letter only mentioned Zenger’s 
remarks during the chambers conference. (ODC later alleged that 
Zenger’s memorandum in opposition language violated HRPC Rules 
4.4(a) and 3.5(c).) 
Judge Acoba did not view Zenger’s conduct as disrupting the 
unscheduled chambers conference. 
The hearing officer related 
that Judge Acoba “never mentioned or questioned the propriety or the use of the words in the Memo [in] Opposition or warned against using or sought to sanction or hold [Zenger] in contempt 
for use of those words or for disrupting the tribunal with 
them.” 
Context was key to the hearing officer. He found that 
Zenger’s words “descriptively characterize[d] the actions or 
inactions of [Wife], [Joroff’s] client, in the context of 
the . . . divorce.” Thus, Zenger’s language “amounted to 
nothing more than statements of opinion about what was 
happening[] which . . . [were] based upon fully-disclosed facts.” 
The hearing officer made extensive findings about Zenger’s 
conduct in relation to HRPC Rules 4.4(a) and 3.5(c): 
6. Mr. Zenger delineated in the pleading a bases 
[sic] for why he felt that [Wife], through her attorney Ms. 
Joroff’s motion constituted a “ hissy fit[,]” why he 
believed that Ms. Joroff’ s client’ s actions were “ sneaky” 
and “sleazy” and amounted to engaging in an “ evil and 
intentional plan[, ]” and why he thought that Ms. Joroff’ s 
client had handled her divorce case with “abject 
neglect[.]” 
7  
    
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
7. When Mr. Zenger asserted that Ms. Joroff’ s client 
has engaged in certain “ sneaky” and “sleazy” things as part 
and parcel of an “ evil and intentional plan[,]” he also 
again openly related why he felt that way: it was because 
Ms. Joroff’ s client has short- set the hearing on her motion 
for only 8 days later and then proceeded to serve the 
motion by depositing in the mail to Mr. Zenger, rather than 
serving him personally, in order to give him a very short 
time within which to file a cogent opposition. And, 
finally, when Mr. Zenger referenced Ms. Joroff’ s client’ s 
“abject neglect” in the handling of the divorce case, he 
told the court why: Ms. Joroff’ s client had not initiated 
formal discovery. 
8. Under these circumstances, Mr. Zenger’s use of 
these words in the pleading amounted to nothing more than statements of opinion about what was happening, which 
opinions are based upon fully- disclosed facts. These 
words, while some may deem to be exaggerated, emphasize a point. 
9. The ODC has further presented no proof or 
evidence as to how or why Mr. Zenger’s use of the aforesaid 
words had no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay or burden Ms. Joroff. 
10. A reasonable lawyer could not find that Mr. 
Zenger meant to embarrass or publicly shame Ms. Joroff by 
filing the Memo in Opposition through use of these words, 
for example, sand bag [sic], given the revised statement of 
facts. 
11. Mr. Zenger’ s language in the Memorandum in 
Opposition is not the type of obstreperous conduct that HRPC 3.5( [c]) prohibits in the context of the situation 
facing [Husband]. 
In chambers, the conference got heated. Zenger and Joroff 
both talked loudly. Judge Acoba testified that Zenger and 
Joroff maintained at least three feet between them, even “once 
[Zenger] started leaning in.” Contrary to ODC’s allegation, the 
hearing officer found that Zenger did not point his finger within six inches of Joroff’s face or chest or loom over her. 
The hearing officer also found that Zenger “was not out of 
8  
   
  
  
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
control, [and did not] yell, bully [or] physically threaten 
[Joroff] in any way, in protecting [his client’s] interests.” 
The hearing officer credited Zenger’s explanation that he 
said “horseshit” and “bullshit” to describe what “Ms. Joroff was 
attempting to do during the chambers conference when she 
insisted on proceeding forward with her Motion to Set which was 
unfiled yet had a hearing date assigned on March 7, 2018 and 
opposing his request for more time to put his position statement together.” He found that “[Zenger] had ample ‘ammunition’” to 
explain to Judge Acoba the implications of Joroff’s motion to 
set and appraisal and sale filing. Zenger thus “never . . . 
used profanity or other words aimed to embarrass [Joroff].” 
The hearing officer concluded there was no misconduct. The 
words objected to in the memo in opposition were not “personal 
attacks made with the intention of embarrassing” either Wife or 
Joroff nor were the words “intended or reasonably likely to 
disrupt a tribunal.” The hearing officer believed that the memo’s context mattered, and that Zenger made statements on 
behalf of Husband “to disclose the honest truths behind the 
actions of [Wife] and her counsel”: 
The ODC has not presented by clear and convincing 
evidence the allegations pertaining to the words used in 
Memo in Opposition violate HRPC Rules 4.4(a) and 3.5(c). 
This is unlike ODC v. Luke ([attorney] suspended for 
calling an opposing party a “slut”). I do not consider the 
words objected to in the Memo in Opposition to be personal 
attacks made with the intention of embarrassing both or 
either of them. ODC has construed the Motion for Immediate Sale as a simple, routine motion for appraisal. I disagree 
9  
  
  
 
   
  
  
 
 
  
 
  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and find that the evidence is contrary to such 
characterization. That is important for my establishing 
the context in which the words were used in the Memo in Opposition. ODC claims that the Memo in Opposition was 
disproportionate to the language chosen by Ms. Joroff in her motion – previously citing an example as [Husband], 
through his counsel, lobbing a hand grenade in response to 
a firecracker. I again disagree. Read the title to an 
alleged routine motion for appointment of an appraiser for the property. I find that the better example from the 
evidence is hand grenade to defend against hand grenade. [Husband] and Mr. Zenger made these statements to disclose 
the honest truths behind the actions of [Wife] and her 
counsel. Nor do I find that the words in the Memo in 
Opposition were used intended or reasonably likely to 
disrupt a tribunal. 
In finding no chambers conference misconduct, the hearing 
officer concluded that “[t]he ODC has not presented by clear and 
convincing evidence the allegations pertaining to conduct during 
the in chambers conference violated [HRPC] Rules 4.4(a) and 
3.5(c). The words and conduct attributable to [Zenger] was [sic] not intended or had no substantial purpose other than to 
embarrass [Joroff], or intended or reasonably likely to disrupt 
a tribunal.” 
Thus, the hearing officer recommended that the Board 
dismiss the amended petition. 
On March 2, 2023, the Disciplinary Board accepted the 
hearing officer’s uncontested findings of fact. The Board had 
no quarrel with any finding. It concluded that the “[hearing 
officer’s] decision of mixed findings of fact and law to dismiss the provoking writings was not clearly erroneous.” But the 
Board rejected the conclusion of law that Zenger’s in-chambers 
conduct was not misconduct under the HRPC. Thus, per DBR Rule 
10  
   
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
    
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
27, the Board ordered a public reprimand at its next regularly 
scheduled meeting. And it ordered Zenger to pay the Board all 
costs of the years-long disciplinary proceedings. 
On March 2, 2023, the same day the Board issued its 
decision, Zenger filed his notice of rejection. See DBR Rule 
27(b)(iii) (“If either Party rejects the Public Reprimand or the Respondent fails to appear without good cause, the Board shall 
file a report with the Supreme Court.”) 
Per Rules of the Supreme Court of Hawaiʻ i (RSCH) Rule 
2.7(d), the Board submitted the record to this court. In June 
2023, the Board filed its Report, Findings, and Recommendations 
for the Imposition of Discipline (Board Report). 
The Board sided with ODC. It broadly construed HRPC Rule 
4.4(a) to cover profanity, voice tone, and descriptions of opposing counsel’s tactics as misconduct. And it tethered its 
expansive view to the Guidelines of Professional Courtesy and 
Civility for Hawai
ʻi Lawyers. The Board Report reasoned: 
The Hearing Officer made findings about [Zenger’s] 
behavior at the chambers conference. [Zenger] was found or 
admitted to have used profanity [“horseshit” “bullshit”] 
and argued in a raised voice. In the course of which he described opposing counsel and her client’s “sandbagging” 
tactics as “sneaky”, “sleazy”, “slimy”, and “evil”. . . . 
The Disciplinary Board considered his conduct 
unprofessional. A lawyer must endeavor to persuade [sic] a 
client’s cause within the rules using facts and logic; not insults and ire. Lawyers are not hired thugs but are 
expected to be learned counsel to participate in the highly 
choreographed and finely tuned judicial apparatus. The 
Disciplinary Board, in light of the goals and aspirations 
inscribed in the rules of professional conduct and the 
guidelines for civility, finds that the ambit of rule 
11  
   
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
4.4(a) HRPC is broad enough to proscribe [Zenger’s] 
behavior as alleged and admitted. 
Daily exposure to the pressures and stresses of the 
conflicts in which a lawyer is immersed should not distract 
the lawyer from measured professional conduct. 
(Emphasis added.) 
The Board relied on the Guidelines of Professional Courtesy 
and Civility for Hawaiʻi Lawyers to find misconduct and punish 
Zenger. The Board Report quoted the Guidelines. “The practice 
of law is an honorable and dignified profession. It is filled 
with clients in need, busy schedules, and crowded dockets. 
These guidelines are aspirational and will hopefully assist all 
in the legal profession and the justice system in conducting themselves in a manner that is fair, efficient, and humane.” 
Then the Board turned to the courtesy and civility 
guidelines to find misconduct, justify a public reprimand, and 
send a message to other attorneys. 
The Disciplinary Board considers this principle to be such 
an important message to the legal community that it views 
this case as appropriate for a public, rather than a 
private, reprimand. 
This court granted Zenger’s request to submit briefing 
pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.7(d) (“The supreme court will not 
entertain briefs or oral argument except[] . . . upon request of 
the supreme court.”). 
II. 
We find no violation of HRPC Rules 4.4(a) and 3.5(c). We 
hold that the Disciplinary Board erred. 
12  
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
First, we discuss the words in Zenger’s memo. The 
Disciplinary Board adopted the hearing officer’s recommendation 
to dismiss the charges arising from Zenger’s memo. Thus, the 
Board does not seek to reprimand Zenger for his memo. Given the 
Board’s conclusions regarding Zenger’s chambers language, 
though, we address ODC’s charge that Zenger violated Rules 
4.4(a) and 3.5(c) when he wrote “sneaky,” “sleazy,” “evil,” and 
“hissy fit” to embarrass, delay, or burden Joroff and Wife in his memo. Zenger’s memo supplies the context to his chambers 
conduct. Our analysis, like the hearing officer’s, includes a 
look at the memorandum in opposition and ODC’s allegation. 
The hearing officer concluded that the context of the memo 
in opposition oriented the inquiry. 
As the hearing officer 
understood, when it comes to attorney discipline under the HRPC, the circumstances matter. Zenger made those statements on 
behalf of Husband “to disclose the honest truths behind the 
actions of [Wife] and her counsel.” 
The findings are undisputed. According to the hearing 
officer, Wife’s counsel made “false” statements about Husband’s stance on the family home. Wife short set the appraisal and 
sale hearing, and served Zenger by mail, leaving Zenger little 
time to respond. Under the circumstances, the hearing officer 
did not err in ruling that Zenger’s words were not “personal 
attacks made with the intention of embarrassing . . . either 
13  
  
  
  
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
[Wife or Joroff].” See Off. of Disciplinary Counsel v. Au, 107 
Hawaii ‘ 327, 337,  113 P.3d 203, 213 (2005) (explaining the Hawai‘ i 
Supreme Court is the trier of fact and law in attorney 
discipline cases). 
Zenger also did not violate HRPC Rule 3.5(c). Judge Acoba 
“never mentioned or questioned the propriety or the use of the words in the Memo [in] Opposition or warned against using or 
sought to sanction or hold [Zenger] in contempt for use of those 
words or for disrupting the tribunal with them.” 
Thus, we agree 
with the hearing officer that the memo’s content was not reasonably likely to disrupt a tribunal. The language in Zenger’s memorandum did not violate HRPC Rules 4.4(a) and 
3.5(c). 
Next, we discuss the chambers conference. Zenger’s conduct 
in Judge Acoba’s chambers did not constitute misconduct. As the 
hearing officer put it, “[t]he ODC has not presented by clear 
and convincing evidence the allegations pertaining to conduct 
during the in chambers conference violated [HRPC] Rules 4.4(a) 
and 3.5(c).” 
The physical conduct that ODC alleged did not happen. 
Zenger neither pointed his finger within six inches of Joroff’s face or chest, nor loomed over her, the hearing officer found. 
Instead, Zenger sat before a judge and protected his client’s 
interests. He “was not out of control, [and did not] yell, 
14  
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
bully [or] physically threaten [Joroff] in any way, in 
protecting [his client’s] interests.” 
The linguistic conduct that ODC alleged happened. But it 
was not misconduct. Zenger did not violate HRPC Rule 4.4(a). 
The hearing officer found that Zenger “never . . . used 
profanity or other words aimed to embarrass [Joroff].” We 
agree. 
Though ill-mannered, the profanity (“horseshit” and 
“bullshit”) and other words from the memo repeated by Zenger, were not intended to embarrass or burden Joroff. Rather, as the 
hearing officer concluded, the words described Joroff’s 
litigation tactics. They expressed Zenger’s reasonable 
complaints about service and that day’s quickly-set hearing, and 
his protest about discussing an unfiled (yet scheduled) motion 
to set that Joroff had just served on him. The hearing officer 
observed, “[Zenger] had ample ‘ammunition’” to explain to Judge 
Acoba the implications of Joroff’s motion to set and her appraisal and sale filing. 
We reject the Board’s reliance on the Guidelines of 
Professional Courtesy and Civility for Hawaiʻi Lawyers to find 
misconduct under Rule 4.4(a) and its recommendation that we discipline Zenger. 
The Board reported to this court: “The Disciplinary Board, 
in light of the goals and aspirations inscribed in the rules of 
15  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
professional conduct and the guidelines for civility, finds that 
the ambit of rule 4.4(a) HRPC is broad enough to proscribe 
[Zenger’s] behavior as alleged and admitted.” 
Because the HRPC does not integrate the Guidelines, we hold 
that failing to follow an aspirational “section” – like Section 
6 Communications with Clients and Adversaries - does not subject 
an attorney to discipline under the HRPC. The Guidelines are 
not incorporated in the HRPC, so they are not factors the Board may rely on to enlarge the professional conduct rules and 
regulate a wider range of attorney conduct. 
The Board’s belief that the HRPC’s scope is so broad as to 
embrace the Guidelines is misguided. Attorney discipline is 
quasi-criminal in nature. Matter of Thalheim, 853 F.2d 383 (5th 
Cir. 1988).  While “[t]he object of the disciplinary process is not to punish lawyers,” punishment still flows from an HRPC 
violation. See Akinaka v. Disciplinary Bd. of Hawaiʻ i Sup. Ct., 
91 
Hawaiʻi 51, 55, 979 P.2d 1077, 1081 (1999) (“[The goal is to]  
protect members of the public and to ensure the orderly and 
efficient administration of justice by disciplining those 
attorneys who do not conform to the [HRPC].”); In re 
Disciplinary Bd. of Hawaiʻ i Sup. Ct., 91 Hawaiʻ i 363, 370, 984 
P.2d 688, 695 (1999) (“Attorney disciplinary proceedings are not 
designed to be a forum for the disgruntled or a platform for the 
disaffected.  Disciplinary proceedings are designed to protect 
16  
  
 
 
    
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the public interest, the integrity of the judicial process, and 
the integrity of the courts, by providing a mechanism by which 
to determine whether an attorney admitted to practice in this 
state is fit to continue as an officer of the court.”). 
A disciplined attorney faces serious personal and 
professional consequences. Disciplinary proceedings are 
adversarial proceedings consuming time and resource efforts 
comparable to civil and criminal proceedings. See In re
Ruffalo, 390 U.S. 544, 551 (1968) (“[Disbarment proceedings] are 
adversary proceedings of a quasi-criminal nature.”); Akinaka, 91 
Hawai‘i at 57, 979 P.2d at 1083 (“ODC acts in a quasi-
prosecutorial manner in the disciplinary process[.]”) (footnote 
omitted).  Findings imposing attorney discipline must be 
supported by clear and convincing evidence. RSCH Rule 8.9(e). 
Attorneys facing disciplinary proceedings are entitled to 
procedural due process. Ruffalo, 390 U.S. at 551 (attorneys 
facing disbarment are entitled to due process); State v. Perez, 
885 A.2d 178, 186 (Conn. 2005) (“[A] sanction for professional 
misconduct adversely affects an attorney’s vested right to practice law. . . . Thus, attorneys subject to disciplinary 
proceedings are entitled to due process of law.”) (quoting 
Briggs v. McWeeny, 796 A.2d 516, 528 (Conn. 2002)); In re Trask, 
46 Haw. 404, 420, 380 P.2d 751, 760 (1963) (for attorneys 
accused of unprofessional conduct, “[a] fair trial by an 
17  
   
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
impartial tribunal is essential to due process”); Bank of Hawaiʻ i 
v. Kunimoto, 91 Hawaiʻ i 372, 388, 984 P.2d 1198, 1214 (1999) 
(out-of-state attorneys had limited property interests in pro 
hac vice status granting the procedural due process right to 
notice); Hallock Grievance Comm. for Tenth Jud. Dist., 180 
N.E.3d 549, 552 (N.Y. 2021) (“[a] lawyer charged with misconduct 
is ‘entitled to procedural due process, which includes fair notice of the charge’”) (quoting Ruffalo, 390 U.S. at 550-51). 
Because our disciplinary rules aim to ensure fair process and 
procedure, they must provide sufficient “notice” to attorneys 
regarding what constitutes prohibited conduct.  
Consistent with procedural due process, we reject the 
Board’s broad reading embedding the Guidelines. 
Limiting the 
HRPC to the rules themselves ensures that attorneys clearly 
understand what constitutes professional misconduct, safeguards 
attorneys against arbitrary enforcement, and advances a fair and 
just application of the HRPC. See also RSCH Rule 2.2. 
Per Rule 4.4(a), we examine whether Zenger’s conduct 
intended solely to embarrass, delay, or burden others. See
 HRPC 
Rule 4.4(a). The rule thus excludes an examination of whether Zenger was “at all times . . . civil [and] courteous” pursuant 
to the Guidelines. See
Guidelines of Professional Courtesy and 
Civility for Hawaiʻi Lawyers, Section 6: Communications with 
Clients and Adversaries.

Zenger’s chambers conduct also did not violate Rule 3.5(c). 
Although we do not condone such occurrences, in context,  
Zenger’s loud voice and word choices were not “abusive or 
obstreperous conduct” reasonably likely to disrupt a tribunal. 
HRPC Rule 3.5, cmt. 2 (“Refraining from abusive or obstreperous 
conduct is a corollary of the advocate’s right to speak on 
behalf of litigants.”). His comments pertained to the matters 
at hand. He did not try to undermine or challenge the court’s authority.  The conference was off record, and no parties, 
jurors, and members of the public were around.   Cf. Off. of
Disciplinary Counsel v. Breiner, 89 
Hawaiʻi 167, 168, 969 P.2d 
1285, 1286 (1999). 
Under the circumstances, Zenger’s conduct was not 
reasonably likely to disrupt a tribunal, and did not violate 
HRPC Rule 3.5. 
We hold that the language in Zenger’s memorandum and his 
conduct in chambers did not violate HRPC Rules 4.4(a) and 
3.5(c). 
III. 
Because the Board urges this court to publicly reprimand 
Zenger for a putative disregard of the Guidelines for 
Professional Courtesy and Civility, we go on. 
HRPC Rule 4.4 does not, as the Board suggests, incorporate 
guidelines covering courtesy and civility. 
We decline to 
19  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
formally reprimand Zenger for word choices that, when taken in 
context, do not constitute misconduct under the HRPC. 
Honor and integrity are core features of the legal 
profession. 
Our profession is independent, self-regulated, and 
serves the public interest. The HRPC’s Preamble reads: “The profession has a responsibility to assure that its regulations 
are conceived in the public interest and not in furtherance of 
parochial or self-interested concerns of the bar. . . . Neglect of these responsibilities compromises the independence of the 
profession and the public interest which it serves.” The ODC 
and the Disciplinary Board hold key enforcement roles in the 
self-regulation of 
Hawaiʻi’s legal industry. 
But the Guidelines are not disciplinary rules. 
They do not 
regulate attorney conduct. They are ideals. See Guidelines 
Preamble (“The Guidelines are not mandatory rules of 
professional conduct, nor standards of care, and are not to be 
used as an independent basis for either disciplinary charges by 
the Office of Disciplinary Counsel or claims of professional 
negligence. They are offered for the guidance of lawyers and for the information of their clients, as well as for reference 
by the courts.”). 
Courts may look to the Guidelines to impose sanctions for 
attorney conduct. See State v. Talo, No. CAAP-20-0000565, 2022 
WL 1640808, at *2 (Haw. App. May 24, 2022) (SDO). But court 
20  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
sanctions differ from attorney discipline imposed by the Hawaiʻ i 
Supreme Court under the HRPC. 
RSCH Rule 2.2 (“The Hawaiʻ i Rules 
of Professional Conduct, attached hereto as Exhibit A, shall 
govern the conduct of all attorneys subject to discipline under 
this rule.”). 
This court values courtesy and civility within the legal 
profession. “[Z]ealously . . . protect[ing] and pursu[ing] a client’s legitimate interests, within the bounds of the law, 
while maintaining a professional, courteous, and civil attitude 
toward all persons involved in the legal system” is a balance 
attorneys must aspire to. See
 HRPC Preamble. 
Still, the 
Guidelines of Professional Courtesy and Civility 
for Hawaiʻi Lawyers – laudable and goal-worthy as they are – have 
no impact on attorney discipline. 
The Board calls for a public reprimand. 
DBR Rule 27 
details permissible attorney punishment. Per Rule 27(a), a public reprimand “signifies that misconduct has been found.” 
Because we find no misconduct, we decline to publicly reprimand Zenger. 
Public reprimand or other disciplinary measures from a 
state’s high court may seriously harm an attorney’s livelihood 
and professional reputation. See Hallock, 180 N.E.3d at 552 
(“Sanctions imposed in disciplinary proceedings ‘may have serious consequences resulting in impairment of repute, loss of 
21  
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
clientele, or, in the case of disbarment, loss of license to 
practice a profession which is their very source of 
livelihood.’”). Potential clients or employers may hesitate to 
hire or employ a disciplined attorney. Other attorneys, legal professionals, and judiciary employees may view the reprimanded 
attorney as unethical or untrustworthy. We decline to 
underestimate the career impact of a supreme court order that 
admonishes an attorney. 
At the time of the ODC hearing, Zenger was well-regarded on 
Kauaʻi. Judge Acoba testified that he “thought highly of 
[Zenger]” and considered Zenger “to be one of the best litigators on Kauai.” Zenger “zealously represents his clients” Judge Acoba said, and because he has “[g]ood client control,” 
the fifth circuit regularly appointed him to the most difficult 
criminal cases. Judge Senda related that Zenger is a “zealous 
advocate” and “very compassionate and very committed to access 
to justice.” He is “one of the few attorneys here on island 
that always gladly accepts court appointed cases.” Zenger “did 
pro bono work quite frequently,” Judge Senda recalled. Zenger, she said, is “considered on this island a top tier litigator” 
who is “very committed to the justice system.” Former Federal 
Public Defender Wolff and Judge Senda also testified to Zenger’s 
reliability, moral character, and integrity. 
22  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
A rebuke from this court is timeless; it mars an attorney’s 
reputation forever. A Hawaiʻ i attorney must act ethically and 
obey the HRPC. Or suffer professional consequences. And when 
ODC alleges misconduct, an attorney has the right to defend 
themself. The disciplinary rules aim to provide fair 
proceedings, consistent with due process. A Board 
recommendation finding misconduct based on violating guidelines 
outside the HRPC undercuts the framework and purpose of the 
HRPC. When a case like this reaches us, we decide whether an 
attorney has violated the HRPC, or not. Deciding whether an 
attorney offended guidelines is just not something this court 
should do in HRPC proceedings. 
The concurrence’s framing of our reference to the record’s 
evidence about Zenger’s professional life as “impliedly and unfairly convey[ing] a sentiment that Stacey Joroff’s experience 
in chambers that led to her filing a disciplinary complaint was 
groundless” misses the context. Our discussion solely stresses 
the reputational and career impact that a disciplinary reprimand 
from this court may inflict on an otherwise well-regarded attorney. It also highlights the private interests that prompt 
this court to ensure procedural due process for attorneys 
accused of misconduct. Because Joroff’s reputation is not the 
focus of the ODC proceedings, we neither uplift nor disparage 
hers. 
23  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
This court does not rule by “sentiment.” As we say, 
context is key in this case. We do not comment on the “grounds” 
for ODC complaints. This court determines whether attorneys 
violate the HRPC. Whether Joroff’s actions “warranted” Zenger’s 
conduct, or whether Zenger’s conduct constituted “zealous 
advocacy” are not truly part of this HRPC inquiry. Given the 
context of the legal proceedings, Zenger’s chambers conduct was 
not intended to disrupt the tribunal, or embarrass, delay, or burden Joroff. Thus, Zenger did not violate the HRPC. 
The hearing officer found that “use of [words like ‘sneaky’ 
and ‘sleazy’] in the pleading amounted to nothing more than 
statements of opinion about what was happening [which were] 
based upon fully-disclosed facts.” 
Because we do not believe 
this court should reprimand attorneys for not meeting aspirational goals in the context of HRPC disciplinary 
proceedings, we do not address whether seven dirty words – 
“sneaky,” “slimy,” “sleazy,” “evil,” “hissy fit,” “horseshit,” and “bullshit” - violate the Guidelines or deserve protection 
under the litigation privilege. 
Our regulatory framework does not allow this court to find 
no professional misconduct, yet police words to see if a lawyer 
lived up to an ideal. 
We hold that Zenger did not violate HRPC Rules 4.4(a) and 
3.5(c). ODC failed to show that Zenger’s conduct had “no 
24  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden” 
Joroff. See HRPC Rule 4.4(a). ODC also failed to show that 
Zenger’s conduct was “intended or reasonably likely to disrupt a tribunal.” See HRPC Rule 3.5(c). 
We dismiss ODC’s amended petition.
