OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J.
 
Paulette Ka' anohiokalani Kaleikini requests that this 
court award $255,158.00 in attorney’s fees and $2,510.24 in costs
 
1
against City and State defendants  for work performed in the
trial court and on appeal in relation to Kaleikini v. Yoshioka,
 128 Hawai' i 53, 283 P.3d 60 (2012). For the reasons set forth 
below, we grant in part and deny in part Kaleikini’s request for
 fees and costs.
 
I. Background
 
A. Underlying appeal
 
The relevant factual background is set forth in this
 
court’s published opinion:
 
Kaleikini brought this suit against the City and
County of Honolulu and the State of Hawai 'i,
challenging the approval of the Honolulu High-Capacity
Transit Corridor Project (rail project or project). The rail project involves the construction of anapproximately 20-mile fixed guideway rail system fromWest O'ahu to Ala Moana Center.  Construction on the 
1 The City defendants are: Wayne Yoshioka, in his official capacity 
as Director of the City and County of Honolulu’s Department of TransportationServices; the City and County of Honolulu; the Honolulu City Council; PeterCarlisle, in his official capacity as Mayor of the City and County ofHonolulu; the City and County of Honolulu Department of TransportationServices; and the City and County of Honolulu Department of Planning andPermitting.  See Kaleikini v. Yoshioka, 128 Hawai 'i 53, 56 n.1, 283 P.3d 60, 
63 n.1 (2012).  Because Peter Carlisle was sued in his official capacity, KirkCaldwell was automatically substituted in his place as respondent/defendant­appellee.  Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 43(c)(1) (2012).
The State defendants are: William J. Aila, Jr., in his official
capacity as Chairperson of the Board of Land and Natural Resources (BLNR) andstate historic preservation officer; Pua 'alaokalani Aiu, in her official
capacity as administrator of the State Historic Preservation Division (SHPD);the BLNR; the Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR); NeilAbercrombie, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Hawai 'i; and 
the O'ahu Island Burial Council (OIBC).  However, Kaleikini explained in her
complaint that the OIBC was named as “an interested party,” whose interestswere “more properly aligned with [Kaleikini].”  Accordingly, reference to theState in this opinion does not include the OIBC.  See id. at 56 n.2, 283 P.3d 
at 63 n.2. 
-2­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
rail project is planned to take place in four phases
. . . .  It is undisputed that the rail project has a“high” likelihood of having a potential effect onarcheological resources in certain areas of Phase 4,which includes Kaka 'ako. 
Kaleikini argued that the rail project should be
enjoined until an archaeological inventory survey,
which identifies and documents archaeological historic
properties and burial sites in the project area, is
completed for all four phases of the project.  More
 specifically, Kaleikini argued that Hawai 'i Revised 
Statutes chapters 6E, 343, and 205A, and their
implementing rules, require that an archaeological
inventory survey be completed prior to any approval or
commencement of the project.  Kaleikini asserted that
 the failure to complete an archaeological inventory
survey prior to the start of construction jeopardized
the integrity of native Hawaiian burial sites by
foreclosing options such as not building the rail,
changing its route, or using a technology that would
have less impact on any sites.
The City moved to dismiss Kaleikini’s complaint
and/or for summary judgment, and the State joined in
the motion.  The City acknowledged that an
archaeological inventory survey was required for each
phase of the rail project.  However, . . . . the City
and State contended that as long as an archeological
inventory survey had been completed for a particular
phase, construction could begin on that part of the
project even if the surveys for the other phases had
not yet been completed.
 
Id. at 56-57, 283 P.3d at 63-64 (footnotes omitted).
 
The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of
 
the City and State on all of Kaleikini’s claims. Id. at 57, 283
 
P.3d at 64. Kaleikini appealed, and this court held that “the
 
SHPD failed to follow its own rules when it concurred in the rail
 project prior to the completion of an archaeological inventory
 survey for the entire project”:
 
In sum, the SHPD failed to comply with HRS
chapter 6E and its implementing rules when it
concurred in the rail project prior to the completion
of the required archaeological inventory survey for
the entire project.  The City similarly failed to
comply with HRS chapter 6E and its implementing rules
by granting a special management area permit for the
rail project and by commencing construction prior to
the completion of the historic preservation review
process.
 
-3­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Id. at 57, 66, 283 P.3d at 64, 73.
 
Accordingly, this court vacated the circuit court’s
 
judgment on Counts 1 through 4 of Kaleikini’s complaint, which
 
challenged the rail project under HRS chapter 6E, and remanded
 for further proceedings. Id.
 
B. Request for attorney’s fees and costs
 
Kaleikini timely filed a request for attorney’s fees
 
and costs. Kaleikini requests costs pursuant to HRAP Rule 39,
2
 
2 HRAP Rule 39 (2012) provides, in pertinent part:
 
(a) Civil Costs; To Whom Allowed.  Except in
criminal cases or as otherwise provided by law, if an
appeal or petition is dismissed, costs shall be taxed
against the appellant or petitioner upon proper
application unless otherwise agreed by the parties or
ordered by the appellate court; if a judgment is
affirmed or a petition denied, costs shall be taxed
against the appellant or petitioner unless otherwise
ordered; if a judgment is reversed or a petition
granted, costs shall be taxed against the appellee or
the respondent unless otherwise ordered; if a judgment
is affirmed in part and reversed in part, or is
vacated, or a petition granted in part and denied in
part, the costs shall be allowed only as ordered by
the appellate court.  If the side against whom costs
are assessed has multiple parties, the appellate court
may apportion the assessment or impose it jointly and
severally.
(b) Costs For and Against the State of Hawai 'i. 
In cases involving the State of Hawai 'i or an agency
or officer thereof, if an award of costs against theState is authorized by law, costs shall be awarded inaccordance with the provisions of this rule; otherwisecosts shall not be awarded for or against the State ofHawai'i, its agencies, or its officers acting in their
official capacities.
(c) Costs Defined. Costs in the appellate courts
are defined as: (1) the cost of the original and one
copy of the reporter’s transcripts if necessary for
the determination of the appeal; (2) the premiums paid
for supersedeas bonds or other bonds to preserve
rights pending appeal; (3) the fee for filing the
appeal; (4) the cost of printing or otherwise
producing necessary copies of briefs and appendices,
provided that copying costs shall not exceed 20¢ per
page; (5) necessary postage, cost of facsimiles,

by David Kimo Frankel and Ashley Obrey, Native Hawaiian Legal
 
Corporation (NHLC) attorneys, at both the trial and appellate
 levels. Specifically, Kaleikini seeks fees totaling $127,579.00,
 which includes $96,495.00 for 275.7 hours of work performed by
 Frankel at the rate of $350.00 per hour, and $31,084.00 for 163.6
 hours of work performed by Obrey at the rate of $190.00 per hour. 
Alternatively, Kaleikini seeks fees totaling $54,995.00 for the
 appeal only, which includes $48,440.00 for 138.4 hours of work
 performed by Frankel, and $6,555.00 for 34.5 hours of work
 performed by Obrey. Additionally, Kaleikini asks that her
 requested fees be enhanced by a multiplier of two.
 
The City and State filed objections to Kaleikini’s
 
request, and Kaleikini filed a reply to each of the objections.

II. DISCUSSION
 
As set forth below, we resolve Kaleikini’s request as
 
follows. First, we deny Kaleikini’s request for fees and costs
 for trial level work, without prejudice to Kaleikini seeking
 those fees in the circuit court. Second, we conclude that
 Kaleikini is entitled to an award of appellate fees because (1)
 Kaleikini prevailed on the disputed main issues before this court
 and therefore is the prevailing party on appeal; and (2)
 
5
 Faith Action for Community Equity and Pacific Resource Partnership
 
(FACE/PRP) previously filed an amicus curiae brief in this case, and also
filed an objection to Kaleikini’s fees request “to the extent [it] may be read
to seek attorneys’ fees and costs against FACE/PRP[.]”  Because Kaleikini does
 not seek fees or costs from FACE/PRP, we do not discuss this objection
further.
 
-6­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Kaleikini’s case meets all three prongs of the private attorney
 
general doctrine. Third, Kaleikini’s request for fees and costs
 against the State is barred by sovereign immunity. Fourth,
 although we award fees against the City, we reduce some of
 Kaleikini’s requested hours and her attorneys’ requested hourly
 rates to achieve a reasonable attorney fee award. Fifth,
 Kaleikini is not entitled to an enhancement of the lodestar
 amount. Finally, Kaleikini is entitled to her requested
 appellate costs.
 
Accordingly, for the reasons set forth below, we award
 
Kaleikini $41,192.00 in fees and $343.00 in costs against the
 City.
 
A.	 Kaleikini’s request for fees and costs attributable to work
performed at the trial level is more properly within the
trial court’s discretion
 
Kaleikini seeks fees and costs relating to work 
performed both at the trial level and on appeal. Kaleikini 
asserts that “[i]t is not entirely clear that this Court is prohibited from awarding attorneys’ fees for work at the trial court level[.]” (Citing Fought & Co., Inc. v. Steel Eng’g & Erection, Inc., 87 Hawai' i 37, 52, 951 P.2d 487, 502 (1998); S. 
Utsunomiya Enters., Inc. v. Moomuku Country Club, 76 Hawai' i 396, 
402, 879 P.2d 501, 507 (1994)). She further argues, “Given that the work undertaken in the circuit court was essential in order to prevail, all the fees from the entire case should be awarded.” The City and State argue that Kaleikini should seek fees incurred 
-7­ 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
at the trial level in the trial court. Kaleikini responds that
 
this court should award her trial level fees and costs based on
 
principles of judicial economy.
 
6
“Although HRAP Rule 39(d) and HRS § 607-14[ ] could be
construed to allow this court to make such awards [of trial-level attorney’s fees], decisions about fees incurred at the trial level are more properly within the trial court’s discretion.” S. 
Utsunomiya Enterprises, Inc., 76 Hawai' i at 402, 879 P.2d at 507. 
This is because 
[t]here are a multitude of situations that arise
during litigation at the trial level that may
contribute to the legal and strategic decisions made
by each party; the trial judge is in the best position
to ascertain the motivations of the parties and the
reasonableness of actions undertaken by counsel and
the parties.
 
Nelson v. Univ. of Hawai' i, 99 Hawai' i 262, 269, 54 P.3d 433, 440 
(2002). 
Accordingly, the trial court is in the best position to
 
determine the reasonableness of fees and costs incurred at the
 
trial level. We therefore deny Kaleikini’s request for fees and
 costs for work performed at the trial level, without prejudice to
 her seeking those fees and costs in the circuit court. 
Accordingly, the remainder of this opinion addresses only
 Kaleikini’s request for fees and costs attributable to her
 appeal.
 
6
 HRS § 607-14 governs attorneys’ fees in actions in the nature of
 
assumpsit and is inapplicable in the instant case.
 
-8­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
B. Kaleikini is the prevailing party on appeal
 
The first issue this court must resolve regarding 
Kaleikini’s request for fees and costs is whether Kaleikini is 
the prevailing party on appeal. See Sierra Club v. Dep’t of 
Transp. (Superferry II), 120 Hawai' i 181, 215, 202 P.3d 1226, 
1260 (2009) (“The first issue that must be determined regarding the fee and cost award is whether Sierra Club was the prevailing party.”). Kaleikini argues that she is the prevailing party because she prevailed on the disputed main issue in her appeal. The City argues Kaleikini did not prevail on the disputed main issue because she did not prevail on the claims she brought pursuant to HRS chapter 343 and 205A.
7 
Where, as here, there is no final judgment clearly
 
8
stating which party prevailed,  the court “is required to firstidentify the principle issues raised by the pleadings and proof in a particular case, and then determine, on balance, which party prevailed on the issues.” Superferry II, 120 Hawai' i at 216, 202 
P.3d at 1261 (quoting MFD Partners v. Murphy, 9 Haw. App. 509, 515, 850 P.2d 713, 716 (1992)). A party “will be deemed to be the successful party for the purpose of taxing costs and 
7
 The State does not present any argument on this issue.

 In Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel , 117 Hawai 'i 92,
122, 176 P.3d 91, 121 (2008), this court reviewed a trial court’s award of
attorney’s fees and costs entered pursuant to HRS § 607-14 (Supp. 1997), andnoted that, “for purposes of HRS § 607-14, the party in whose favor judgmentwas entered is the prevailing party.”  In the instant case, this court did notenter judgment in favor of either party, but rather vacated the circuitcourt’s judgment and remanded for further proceedings.  Accordingly, Kamakadoes not resolve whether Kaleikini is the prevailing party on appeal.

attorney’s fees” “where [that] party prevails on the disputed
 
main issue, even though not to the extent of his original
 contention[.]” Food Pantry, Ltd. v. Waikiki Bus. Plaza, Inc., 58
 
Haw. 606, 620, 575 P.2d 869, 879 (1978) (footnote omitted).
 
Here, Kaleikini’s complaint in the circuit court
 
alleged six counts:
 
First, Kaleikini alleged that the City’s grant of a
special management area permit for the rail project
and its decision to commence construction on the
 project prior to the completion of an AIS violated HRS
§§ 6E-8 and 6E-42, and their implementing rules, HAR
chapters 13-275 (2002) and 13-284 (2002) (Counts 1-2). 
Kaleikini further alleged that the DLNR, through the
SHPD, violated HRS §§ 6E-8 and 6E-42, and their
implementing rules, in authorizing an AIS to be
postponed (Counts 3-4).  Kaleikini also alleged that
Governor Abercrombie violated HRS chapter 343 by
accepting the final EIS for the rail project, because
the final EIS did not contain an AIS and was therefore
 incomplete (Count 5).  Finally, Kaleikini alleged that
the City and State Defendants had failed to “give full
consideration of the impact of the [rail project] on
iwi and cultural and historic values prior to
decisionmaking” (Count 6). 
Kaleikini, 128 Hawai' i at 60-61, 293 P.3d at 67-68 (footnotes 
omitted).
 
At the heart of each count was Kaleikini’s argument
 
that an AIS must be completed for all four phases of the rail
 
project prior to any approval or commencement of the project. 
See id. at 61, 283 P.3d at 68. The circuit court orally granted
 summary judgment in favor of the City and State on all counts on
 the ground that the phased approach to the AIS for the rail
 project was not prohibited by law. Id. at 66, 283 P.3d at 73. 
Accordingly, the circuit court entered final judgment in favor of
 the City, State, and OIBC, and against Kaleikini on all of her
 
-10­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
claims. Id. Thus, the City, State, and OIBC were the prevailing
 
parties in the circuit court.
 
Kaleikini’s primary argument on appeal was that the
 
City and State failed to comply with HRS §§ 6E-8 and 6E-42 and
 
their implementing rules by allowing a decision on the project to
 be made prior to the completion of an AIS for the entire project
 
(Counts 1-4). Id. Additionally, Kaleikini argued that the final
 
EIS was inadequate under HRS chapter 343 because it did not
 
contain a completed AIS (Count 5), id. at 81, 283 P.3d at 88, and
 that the City and State failed to give full consideration to
 cultural and historic values, as required under HRS chapter 205A
 (Count 6), id. at 84, 283 P.3d at 91.
 
This court held that the circuit court erred in
 
granting summary judgment in favor of the City and State on
 Counts 1 through 4 because an AIS for all four phases of the
 project was required prior to approval of the project. Id. at
 
72, 283 P.3d at 79. Accordingly, this court vacated the judgment
 with respect to these counts, and remanded to the circuit court
 for further proceedings. Id. at 88, 283 P.3d at 95. However,
 
this court held that the circuit court properly granted summary
 judgment in favor of the City and State on Counts 5 and 6. Id.
 
The City argues that the case is “[a]t best, a draw”
 
because Kaleikini did not prevail on Counts 5 and 6. However,
 this court noted that Kaleikini’s “primary argument on appeal”
 concerned Counts 1 through 4, and this court ruled in favor of
 
-11­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Kaleikini on those counts. Id. at 66, 68, 283 P.3d at 73, 75. 
Because Kaleikini prevailed on the “primary argument on
 
appeal[,]” she prevailed on the disputed main issue.
 
The City also argues that Kaleikini cannot be deemed 
the prevailing party because this court remanded for further proceedings and the proceedings therefore have not concluded. In support of this argument the City cites Nelson. Nelson concerned 
a request for fees brought pursuant to statute, which allowed for fees “in addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff or plaintiffs[.]” 99 Hawai' i at 265, 54 P.3d 436 (emphasis added). 
Thus, this court was required to determine whether the plaintiff had been awarded a “judgment” within the meaning of the statute. Id. This court noted that the forms of relief envisioned by the 
statute required a finding in favor of the plaintiff on the merits. Id. at 266, 54 P.3d at 437. “Consequently, a judgment 
on appeal that merely vacates a trial court judgment unfavorable to the plaintiff and places the plaintiff back where the plaintiff started does not, in itself, provide any grounds for an award of fees to the plaintiff.” Id. 
Nelson is distinguishable from the instant case for two
 
reasons. First, Kaleikini does not seek fees pursuant to
 statute, but rather pursuant to the private attorney general
 doctrine. As discussed below, the private attorney general
 doctrine does not require that a plaintiff receive a final
 
-12­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
judgment in his or her favor before fees may be awarded.9 
Second, this court ruled in favor of Kaleikini on the merits of 
Counts 1 through 4. Kaleikini, 128 Hawai' i at 73, 81, 283 P.3d 
at 80, 88. This court remanded to the circuit court to determine the proper relief to be awarded on these counts. Id. at 81, 283 
P.3d at 88. Thus, unlike in Nelson, this court’s ruling in the instant case did not place the plaintiff “back where the plaintiff started[.]” 99 Hawai' i at 266, 54 P.3d at 437. 
Accordingly, Kaleikini is the prevailing party on
 
appeal for the purposes of attorney’s fees.
 
C. The private attorney general doctrine applies
 
“Normally, pursuant to the ‘American Rule,’ each party 
is responsible for paying his or her own litigation expenses. 
This general rule, however, is subject to a number of exceptions: attorney’s fees are chargeable against the opposing party when so authorized by statute, rule of court, agreement, stipulation, or precedent.” Superferry II, 120 Hawai' i at 218, 202 P.3d at 1263 
(brackets omitted) (quoting Fought, 87 Hawai' i at 50-51, 951 P.2d 
at 500-01). “This court has [also] recognized a number of equitable exceptions to the ‘American Rule.’” In re Water Use 
Permit Applications (Waiâ hole II), 96 Hawai' i 27, 29, 25 P.3d 
9
 This court considers three “basic factors” in determining whether 
the private attorney general doctrine applies: “(1) the strength or societal
importance of the public policy vindicated by the litigation, (2) thenecessity for private enforcement and the magnitude of the resultant burden onthe plaintiff, [and] (3) the number of people standing to benefit from thedecision.”   Superferry II , 120 Hawai 'i at 218, 202 P.3d at 1263 (quoting Maui 
Tomorrow v. State, 110 Hawai 'i 234, 244, 131 P.3d 517, 527 (2006)). 
-13­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
802, 804 (2001). One such exception is provided by the private 
attorney general doctrine, which “is an equitable rule that allows courts in their discretion to award attorneys’ fees to plaintiffs who have ‘vindicated important public rights.’” Id.; 
see also Superferry II, 120 Hawai' i at 218, 202 P.3d at 1263 
(quoting Maui Tomorrow, 110 Hawai' i at 244, 131 P.3d at 527). 
This court considers three “basic factors” in 
determining whether the private attorney general doctrine applies: “(1) the strength or societal importance of the public policy vindicated by the litigation, (2) the necessity for private enforcement and the magnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff, [and] (3) the number of people standing to benefit from the decision.” Superferry II, 120 Hawai' i at 218, 202 P.3d 
at 1263 (quoting Maui Tomorrow, 110 Hawai' i at 244, 131 P.3d at 
527). 
As set forth below, all three prongs of the private
 
attorney general doctrine have been satisfied in the instant
 case. Accordingly, we may award attorney’s fees to Kaleikini.
10
 
10 The State makes several arguments as to why the private attorney
 
general doctrine should not apply.  First, the State argues that Kaleikini
should not be awarded fees because the legislature did not intend that private
persons be awarded fees in HRS chapter 6E cases, except to the extent
authorized by HRS § 607-25(e).  The State appears to argue that HRS § 607­25(e) is the exclusive means for seeking attorney’s fees in cases brought
pursuant to HRS chapter 6E.  Fees are not available pursuant to HRS § 607­25(e) in this case.  HRS § 607-25(e) (Supp. 2011) (providing for fees “[i]n
any civil action in this State where a private party sues for injunctive
relief against another private party who has been or is undertaking any
development without obtaining all permits or approvals required by law from
government agencies”) (emphasis added).
This court rejected an argument similar to the State’s in
Superferry II, where it held that HRS § 607-25 is not the exclusive means for

See id. 
1.	 The strength or societal importance of the public
policy vindicated by the litigation
 
Kaleikini asserts that this case has vindicated an
 
issue of “great public importance[,]” specifically the historic
 
preservation and protection of iwi. Kaleikini also asserts that
 this case vindicated at least four other important public
 policies: (1) the historic preservation review process is
 sequential and requires an AIS prior to the SHPD’s concurrence in
 
10(...continued)
seeking fees in an action brought pursuant to HRS chapter 343 because HRS
§ 607-25 focuses on “development,” which is only a narrow subset of actionsthat may lead to a violation of HRS § 343-5.  120 Hawai 'i at 222-25, 202 P.3d 
at 1267-70.  Although the underlying claims in Superferry II  arguably involved
a challenge to approval of a “development,” see id. at 186, 202 P.3d at 1231(noting that the project involved Hawai 'i Superferry, Inc.’s proposal to
“develop and operate a high-speed roll-on/roll-off ferry service”), this courtnonetheless held that fees were available pursuant to the private attorneygeneral doctrine, id. at 222-25, 202 P.3d at 1267-70.  Similarly, here, HRSchapter 6E governs conservation of historic properties in a variety ofcontexts, and not solely in relation to “development.”  See, e.g. , HRS §§ 6E-8 
and 6E-42.  Accordingly, the State’s argument is without merit for the reasonsset forth in Superferry II.
Second, the State argues that this court should apply the test set
forth in Reliable Collection Agency v. Cole, 59 Haw. 503, 507, 584 P.2d 107,109 (1978), for determining whether attorney’s fees are available.  This argument is without merit.  The purpose of the Reliable  test is to determine
whether a statute implicitly provides a private right of action. Id. This 
inquiry focuses on whether a private party can sue to enforce a statute. Cnty. of Hawai 'i v. Ala Loop Homeowners, 123 Hawai 'i 391, 406 n.20, 235 P.3d 
1103, 1118 n.20 (2010).  It does not address whether a private party may recover attorney’s fees.
Moreover, this court has never applied the Reliable test in
considering whether an award of fees is appropriate pursuant to the privateattorney general doctrine, see Superferry II, 120 Hawai 'i at 219-25, 202 P.3d 
at 1264-70, and we decline to do so here.  Application of the Reliable testwould render the private attorney general doctrine wholly illusory:  if the relevant statute reflects a legislative intent to award attorney’s fees, thenthe “equitable powers of the judiciary to provide” such fees pursuant to theprivate attorney general doctrine, Superferry II, 120 Hawai 'i at 219, 202 P.3d 
at 1264 (citation omitted), would be unnecessary.  In contrast, if a statuteis silent as to the availability of fees, the private attorney generaldoctrine would be unavailable.  In light of this court’s decision to awardfees pursuant to the private attorney general doctrine in the face oflegislative silence regarding fees, id. at 221-23, 202 P.3d at 1266-68, theState’s argument is unpersuasive.

a project; (2) phasing of the historic preservation review
 
process is impermissible; (3) standing may exist pursuant to HRS
 § 6E-13(b), even where an irreparable injury has not yet
 occurred; and (4) procedural injury is a basis for standing
 pursuant to HRS § 6E-13(b).
 
The City argues that the issue on which Kaleikini
 
prevailed was “ultimately one of process that turned on the
 Court’s interpretation of the definition of ‘project area’ in the
 applicable administrative regulations and not any constitutional
 
right or provision[.]” (Emphasis in original). The State
 
similarly argues that “this case is not about the protection of
 
iwi[,]” but rather involves a “relatively arcane dispute as to
 
how, not whether, to protect the iwi[.]” Moreover, the State
 
argues that application of the private attorney general doctrine
 
in this case would “swallow the general American rule” because
 all laws involve important public policy interests or they “would
 not have been enacted in the first place.”
 
Even assuming that the City and State are correct that 
the policies vindicated by this case are largely procedural, this court has found the first prong of the private attorney general doctrine satisfied in other similar circumstances. In Superferry II, this court considered whether the first prong was satisfied in a dispute over the need for an environmental assessment for the Hawai' i Superferry. 120 Hawai' i at 186-87, 202 P.3d at 1231­
32. The prevailing party argued that this prong was satisfied
 
-16­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
because the litigation was “responsible for establishing the 
principle of procedural standing in environmental law in Hawai' i 
and clarifying the importance of addressing the secondary impacts of a project in the environmental review process pursuant to HRS chapter 343.” Id. at 220, 202 P.3d at 1265. This court agreed. 
Id. 
Here, Kaleikini’s case was responsible for clarifying 
the principle of procedural standing in historic preservation law in Hawai' i, and clarifying the importance of addressing impacts 
on historic properties prior to approval and commencement of projects that are subject to the provisions of HRS chapter 6E. Kaleikini, 128 Hawai' i at 71, 283 P.3d at 78; see Superferry II, 
120 Hawai' i at at 220, 202 P.3d at 1265. Accordingly, the first 
prong of the private attorney general doctrine is satisfied in this case. 
2.	 The necessity for private enforcement and the magnitude
of the resultant burden on the plaintiff
 
Kaleikini asserts that private enforcement was
 
essential because she was solely responsible for challenging the
 
City’s failure to prepare an AIS prior to decision making and
 construction, and the City and State either completely abandoned,
 or actively opposed, her cause. The City responds that neither
 the City nor the State abandoned their duties under HRS chapter
 6E, but rather erroneously believed that their plan was lawful. 
The State acknowledges that private enforcement may have been
 
-17­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
necessary, but argues that attorney’s fees are not necessary
 
because other private parties may have been “willing to pay
 market rates (indeed above market rates) to bring the suit if
 plaintiff had not done so.” The State also asserts that NHLC
 could have represented Kaleikini pro bono.
 
A review of this court’s case law concerning the second 
prong of the private attorney general doctrine is instructive. This court first examined the private attorney general doctrine in Waiâhole II, and concluded that the second prong of the doctrine was not satisfied in that case. 96 Hawai' i at 31, 25 
P.3d at 806. There, the underlying dispute concerned “water distributed by the Waiâhole Ditch System, a major irrigation infrastructure on the island of Oahu[.]” In re Water Use Permit 
Applications (Waiâhole I), 94 Hawai' i 97, 110, 9 P.3d 409, 422 
(2000). Following a lengthy and complex contested case hearing, the Commission on Water Resource Management (Commission) issued a final decision with respect to release of water from the System, which focused primarily on the “public trust doctrine.” Id. at 
110, 113, 9 P.3d at 422, 425. The Commission concluded that, “[u]nder the State Constitution and the public trust doctrine, the State’s first duty is to protect the fresh water resources (surface and ground) which are part of the public trust res.” Id. at 113, 9 P.3d at 425. On appeal, this court held, inter alia, that “article XI, section 1 and article XI, section 7 [of the Hawai' i Constitution] adopt the public trust doctrine as a 
-18­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
fundamental principle of constitutional law in Hawai' i.” Id. at 
132, 9 P.3d at 444. Nevertheless, this court reversed in part
 
the Commission’s decision. Id. at 189, 9 P.3d at 501.
 
Subsequently, multiple public parties, denominated the
 
Windward Parties, sought attorney’s fees against both private and
 governmental parties involved in the dispute. Waiâhole II, 96
 
Hawai'i at 28-29, 25 P.3d at 803-04. This court noted that, in 
cases from other jurisdictions in which the second prong of the
 private attorney general doctrine had been satisfied, “the
 plaintiffs served as the sole representative of the vindicated
 public interest. The government either completely abandoned, or
 actively opposed, the plaintiff’s cause.” Id. at 31, 25 P.3d at
 
806 (citations omitted). However, this court observed that the
 Windward Parties
 
represented one of many competing public and private
interests in an adversarial proceeding before the
governmental body designated by constitution and
statute as the primary representative of the people
with respect to water resources, the Commission on
Water Resources Management.  The Commission duly
recognized its duties as trustee of state water
resources, even to an extent further than this court
deemed appropriate. . . .  Nonetheless, the court made
no rulings regarding the ultimate disposition of water
resources, but simply remanded the matter to the
commission for further findings and conclusions.
 
The relevant point, of course, is not the extent
of the Windward Parties’ success on appeal, but,
rather, the role played by the government.  In sum,
 unlike other cases, in which the plaintiffs
single-handedly challenged a previously established
government law or policy, in this case, the Windward
Parties challenged the decision of a tribunal in an
adversarial proceeding not contesting any action or
policy of the government.  The Windward Parties cite
 no case in which attorneys’ fees were awarded in an
adversarial proceeding against a tribunal and the
losing parties and in favor of the prevailing party,
based on the reversal of the tribunal’s decision on
 
-19­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
appeal.  Nor does such a rule appear prudent from a
policy standpoint, where public tribunals in
adversarial settings must invariably consider and
weigh various “public interests.”  Therefore, we hold
that this case does not qualify for an award of
attorneys’ fees under the conventional application of
the private attorney general doctrine.
 
Id. at 31-32, 25 P.3d at 806-07 (citations omitted).
 
Similarly, in Maui Tomorrow, this court determined that 
the second prong of the private attorney general doctrine had not 
been satisfied in an action where the plaintiff contested “a policy of the BLNR to lease water rights without performing the required analysis.” 110 Hawai' i at 245, 131 P.3d at 528. This 
court concluded that the private attorney general doctrine was not applicable because the State “did not ‘abandon’ or ‘actively oppose’ [the plaintiff’s] cause[,]” but rather concluded that an agency other than the BLNR was the appropriate agency to fulfill the State’s duty. Id. This court also analogized Maui Tomorrow 
to Waiâhole II, noting that Maui Tomorrow 
involve[d] an appeal from the decision of a tribunal
in an adversarial proceeding, and the circuit court
‘made no rulings regarding the ultimate disposition of
water resources, but simply remanded the matter . . .
for further findings and conclusions.’  Like the
 Windward Parties [in Wai âhole II, the Maui Tomorrow
plaintiffs] cite[d] no cases in which fees were
awarded against a tribunal and the losing parties
based on the reversal of the tribunal’s decision on
 appeal.
 
Id. (citation omitted).
 
In contrast, in Superferry II, this court found that
 
the second prong of the private attorney general doctrine was
 
satisfied, where “the plaintiffs . . . were comprised of two
 non-profit organizations and an unincorporated association” who
 
-20­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
were “solely responsible for challenging [the Department of 
Transportation’s (DOT)] erroneous application of its responsibilities under HRS chapter 343.” 120 Hawai' i at 220, 202 
P.3d at 1265. In that case, “DOT exempted the Superferry project from the requirements of HRS chapter 343 without considering its secondary impacts on the environment[,]” “[i]n contravention of its responsibilities under the laws of this state[.]” Id. at 
221, 202 P.3d at 1266. 
This court distinguished Superferry II from Maui
 
Tomorrow, noting that, in Maui Tomorrow,
 
the challenged government policy resulted from an
erroneous understanding that another state agency was
to perform the duty at issue. . . .  In this case, DOT
simply did not recognize its duty to consider both the
primary and secondary impacts of the Superferry
project on the environment.  DOT was not under the
 erroneous understanding that another agency was
considering those impacts, as in Maui Tomorrow;
rather, in this case DOT wholly abandoned that duty by
issuing an erroneous exemption to Superferry.
 
Id. (citation omitted).
 
Unlike the multiple public parties in Waiâhole II, 96 
Hawai'i at 28-29, 25 P.3d at 803-04, or even the “two non-profit 
organizations and an unincorporated association” in Superferry 
II, 120 Hawai' i at 220, 202 P.3d at 1265, the plaintiff in the 
instant case was Kaleikini -- a single, private individual.11 
Kaleikini was solely responsible for challenging the City and State’s erroneous application of HRS chapter 6E, and clarifying 
11
 Accordingly, the State’s argument that other private parties may
 
have been “willing to pay market rates (indeed above market rates) to bring
the suit if plaintiff had not done so[,]” is unpersuasive.
 
-21­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the City and State’s responsibilities under the law. See 
Superferry II, 120 Hawai' i at 220-21, 202 P.3d at 1265-66. 
The City and State argue that the instant case is 
similar to Waiâ hole II and Maui Tomorrow because SHPD did not 
wholly abandon its duties under the law, but rather recognized 
the necessity of an AIS and erroneously believed the study could be delayed. However, it is apparent from this court’s opinion that the City and State acted “[i]n contravention of [their] responsibilities under the laws of this state,” see Superferry II, 120 Hawai' i at 221, 202 P.3d at 1266, in concurring in the 
rail project and proceeding with construction prior to the completion of an AIS for all four phases of the project, Kaleikini, 120 Hawai' i at 57, 283 P.3d at 64 (“In sum, the SHPD 
failed to comply with HRS chapter 6E and its implementing rules when it concurred in the rail project prior to the completion of the required archaeological inventory survey for the entire project. The City similarly failed to comply with HRS chapter 6E and its implementing rules by granting a special management area permit for the rail project and by commencing construction prior to the completion of the historic preservation review process.”). 
Moreover, although the OIBC agreed with Kaleikini that
 
the phased approach was impermissible, id. at 62-64, 283 P.3d at
 69-71, the OIBC did not bring suit to enforce the provisions of
 HRS chapter 6E and took no position with regard to the City’s
 motion for summary judgment, see id. at 65, 283 P.3d at 72. 
-22­  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Thus, private enforcement by Kaleikini was necessary to ensure
 
the City and State complied with HRS chapter 6E and its
 implementing rules.
 
Accordingly, the second prong of the private attorney
 
general doctrine was satisfied in this case.
 
3.	 The number of people standing to benefit from the
decision
 
Kaleikini asserts that “[t]he public at large benefits
 
from a decision that ensures the integrity of the historic
 
preservation review process.” The City concedes that “the public
 generally benefits from this decision and the third prong may
 arguably be satisfied.” The State argues that “the number of
 persons benefitted [sic] is indeterminate” because “there is no
 evidence that any significant number of persons are concerned
 about whether an AIS may be completed in phases.”
 
In Superferry II, this court concluded that the third 
prong was satisfied where “this court’s opinion . . . provided a public benefit, because it is generally applicable law that established procedural standing in environmental law and clarified the need to address secondary impacts in environmental review pursuant to HRS chapter 343 and will benefit large numbers of people over long periods of time.” 120 Hawai' i at 221, 202 
P.3d at 1266 (internal quotation marks omitted). In Waiâhole II, this court concluded that “all of the citizens of the state, present and future, stood to benefit from the decision.” 96 
-23­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Hawai'i at 31, 25 P.3d at 806. 
In the instant case, this court’s opinion established
 
“generally applicable law” regarding standing to enforce historic
 
preservation laws. See Superferry II, 120 Hawai' i at 221, 202 
P.3d at 1266. In addition, this court’s opinion ensured that
 historic preservation laws will be enforced as written. The
 plain language of those laws supports a conclusion that the
 decision in this case benefits all citizens of the State:
 
The Constitution of the State of Hawaii recognizes the
value of conserving and developing the historic and
cultural property within the State for the public
good. . . . The legislature further declares that it
is in the public interest  to engage in a comprehensive
program of historic preservation at all levels of
government to promote the use and conservation of such
property . . . .
 
HRS § 6E-1 (2009) (emphasis added).
 
Accordingly, the third prong of the private attorney
 
general doctrine was satisfied in this case.
 
In sum, all three prongs of the test for the private
 
attorney general doctrine have been satisfied. Accordingly, we
 
award Kaleikini reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to the
 private attorney general doctrine.
 
D.	 Kaleikini’s request for attorney’s fees against the State is
barred by sovereign immunity
 
This court has noted that:
 
The doctrine of sovereign immunity refers to the
general rule, incorporated in the Eleventh Amendmentto the United States Constitution, that a state cannotbe sued in federal court without its consent or an express waiver of its immunity.  The doctrine of sovereign immunity, as it has developed in Hawai 'i,
also precludes such suits in state courts. 
-24­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
State ex rel. Anzai v. Honolulu, 99 Hawai' i 508, 515, 57 P.3d 
433, 440 (2002) (citations and footnote omitted). 
Pursuant to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, “the 
sovereign State is immune from suit for money damages, except 
where there has been a clear relinquishment of immunity and the State has consented to be sued.” Bush v. Watson, 81 Hawai' i 474, 
481, 918 P.2d 1130, 1137 (1996) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). This court has recognized that “an award of costs and fees to a prevailing party is inherently in the nature of a damage award.” Superferry II, 120 Hawai' i at 226, 202 P.3d 
at 1271 (quotation marks omitted) (quoting Fought, 87 Hawai' i at 
51, 951 P.2d at 501). Accordingly, to properly award attorney’s fees and costs against the State, “there must be ‘a clear relinquishment’ of the State’s immunity[.]” Id. (quoting Bush, 
81 Hawai' i at 481, 918 P.2d at 1137). For the reasons set forth 
below, the State has not waived its sovereign immunity for an award of attorney’s fees and costs in the circumstances of this case. 
This court has noted that the State has waived immunity
 
to suit only to the extent as specified in HRS chapters 661 and
 662.
12 Taylor-Rice v. State, 105 Hawai' i 104, 110, 94 P.3d 659, 
665 (2004) (citations omitted). HRS § 661-1(1) “contains a limited waiver of sovereign immunity for claims against the State 
12
 HRS § 662-2 (1993) waives the State’s immunity to suit for
 
liability for the torts of its employees and is not applicable here.
 
-25­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of Hawai' i that are founded upon a statute[.]”13 Garner v. State, 
Dep’t of Educ., 122 Hawai' i 150, 160, 223 P.3d 215, 225 (App. 
2009). In determining the extent of the State’s waiver of
 
sovereign immunity, this court relies on the following principles
 derived from federal law:
 
(1) a waiver of the Government’s sovereign immunity
will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in
favor of the sovereign; (2) a waiver of sovereign
immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory
text; (3) a statute’s legislative history cannot
supply a waiver that does not appear clearly in any
statutory text; (4) it is not a court’s right to
extend the waiver of sovereign immunity more broadly
than has been directed by the [the legislature]; and
(5) sovereign immunity is not to be waived by policy
arguments[.]
 
Taylor-Rice, 105 Hawai' i at 110, 94 P.3d at 665 (citations, 
internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).
 
In the instant case, Kaleikini argues that the State
 
waived its sovereign immunity pursuant to HRS § 6E-13(b) and
 
13 HRS § 661-1 (1993) provides, in pertinent part:
 
The several circuit courts of the State and, except as
otherwise provided by statute or rule, the several
state district courts shall, subject to appeal as
provided by law, have original jurisdiction to hear
and determine the following matters, and, unless
otherwise provided by law, shall determine all
questions of fact involved without the intervention of
a jury.
 
(1) All claims against the State founded upon
any statute of the State; or upon any regulation
of an executive department; or upon any
contract, expressed or implied, with the State,
and all claims which may be referred to any such
court by the legislature; provided that no
action shall be maintained, nor shall any
process issue against the State, based on any
contract or any act of any state officer which
the officer is not authorized to make or do by
the laws of the State, nor upon any other cause
of action than as herein set forth.
 
(Emphasis added).
 
-26­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
article XI, section 9 of the Hawai' i Constitution. For the 
reasons set forth below, neither HRS § 6E-13(b) nor article XI,
 
section 9 waives the State’s sovereign immunity.
 
1.	 HRS § 6E-13(b) does not waive the State’s sovereign
immunity
 
Kaleikini relies primarily on Superferry II in arguing 
that the State waived its immunity for fees pursuant to HRS § 6E­
13(b). There, this court concluded that the State waived its sovereign immunity pursuant to HRS § 343-7, because that statute authorizes judicial review of specified agency decisions. 120 Hawai'i at 226-28, 202 P.3d at 1271-73. Although HRS § 343-7 
does not expressly waive the State’s immunity for attorney’s fees resulting from such judicial review, this court nonetheless concluded that the State’s liability for fees was “to be judged under the same principles as those governing the liability of private parties.” Id. at 229, 202 P.3d at 1274. Accordingly, 
fees could be awarded against the State based on the private attorney general doctrine. Id. at 230, 202 P.3d at 1275. 
HRS § 6E-13(b) is distinguishable from HRS § 343-7, and
 
a waiver of the State’s sovereign immunity cannot similarly be
 implied from HRS § 6E-13(b). This is because HRS § 6E-13(b)
 (2009) allows suit to be brought only for a restraining order or
 injunctive relief:
 
Any person may maintain an action in the trial court
having jurisdiction where the alleged violation
occurred or is likely to occur for restraining orders
or injunctive relief  against the State, its political
subdivisions, or any person upon a showing of
 
-27­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
irreparable injury, for the protection of an historic
property or a burial site and the public trust therein
from unauthorized or improper demolition, alteration,
or transfer of the property or burial site.
 
(Emphasis added).
 
It is well settled that a provision allowing for 
declaratory or injunctive relief is not a waiver of the State’s 
sovereign immunity, but rather an exception to the sovereign immunity doctrine for which no waiver is necessary. Superferry 
II, 120 Hawai' i at 229 n.30, 202 P.3d at 1274 n.30 (“Where a 
party seeks only injunctive relief, the ability to sue the state does not stem from a waiver of sovereign immunity, but from the fact that sovereign immunity does not bar the suit in the first place.”). Indeed, Superferry II expressly recognized the distinction between a claim brought pursuant to HRS § 343-7 and one seeking only injunctive relief. Id. (noting that the case 
relied on by the dissent in Superferry II, Taomae v. Lingle, 110 Hawai'i 327, 132 P.3d 1238 (2006), was distinguishable because it 
involved a suit for injunctive relief and therefore involved “no statutory waiver of sovereign immunity for the underlying action”). 
Accordingly, HRS § 6E-13(b) does not contain a waiver
 
of the State’s sovereign immunity.
 
2.	 Article XI, section 9 of the Hawai' i Constitution does 
not waive the State’s sovereign immunity 
Kaleikini relies primarily on Ala Loop Homeowners in
 
arguing that the State waived its immunity to fees pursuant to
 
-28­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
article XI, section 9 of the Hawai' i Constitution. There, this 
court concluded that article XI, section 9 contained an implied 
private right of action to enforce the provisions of HRS chapter 205 and other “laws relating to environmental quality.” 123 Hawai'i at 409-17, 235 P.3d at 1121-29. Accordingly, Ala Loop 
Homeowners was permitted to assert its claims. Id. at 422, 235 
P.3d at 1134. However, this court subsequently denied Ala Loop Homeowners’ request for attorney’s fees and costs on the ground that there had been no “clear relinquishment” of the State’s sovereign immunity. Cnty. of Hawai' i v. Ala Loop Homeowners, No. 
27707 (Haw. Mar. 21, 2011) (Order). 
There are several reasons why article XI, section 9 
does not waive the State’s sovereign immunity in this case. First, the Hawai' i Constitution does not waive the State’s 
sovereign immunity pursuant to HRS § 661-1 because claims based on the constitution are not “founded upon any statute of the State[.]” Kaho'ohanohano v. State, 114 Hawai' i 302, 338, 162 P.3d 
696, 732 (2007). Second, it is not apparent that article XI, section 9 applies to Kaleikini’s claims, as it pertains to “laws relating to environmental quality, including control of pollution and conservation, protection and enhancement of natural resources.” Haw. Const. art. XI, § 9. Finally, nothing in the plain language of article XI, section 9 clearly relinquishes the State’s sovereign immunity with respect to attorney’s fees. Article XI, section 9 provides: 
-29­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Each person has the right to a clean and healthful
environment, as defined by laws relating to
environmental quality, including control of pollution
and conservation, protection and enhancement of
natural resources.  Any person may enforce this right
against any party, public or private, through
appropriate legal proceedings, subject to reasonable
limitations and regulation as provided by law.
 
This provision must be strictly construed. See Taylor-
Rice, 105 Hawai' i at 110, 94 P.3d at 665. Nothing in article XI, 
section 9 expressly waives the State’s immunity for attorney’s
 
fees.
 
In sum, there has been no clear relinquishment of the
 
State’s sovereign immunity, and thus the State’s immunity bars
 Kaleikini’s request for fees based on the private attorney
 general doctrine.
14
 
E.	 Although the fees requested by Kaleikini are generally
reasonable, we deny some of the hours requested and reduce
the attorneys’ requested hourly rates
 
Kaleikini requests a total of $54,995.00 in fees in
 
relation to her appeal. Specifically, Kaleikini requests
 
$48,440.00 for 138 hours of work performed by Frankel, and
 $6,555.00 for 34.5 hours of work performed by Obrey. This court
 employs the “lodestar” method in determining a reasonable
 attorney’s fee. DFS Group L.P. v. Paiea Props., 110 Hawai' i 217, 
222, 131 P.3d 500, 505 (2006). Under the lodestar method, the
 court multiplies the number of hours reasonably expended by a
 
14
 The State also has not waived its immunity for costs.  HRS § 607­
24 waives the State’s immunity for costs “[i]n all cases in which a final
judgment or decree is obtained against the State[.]”  This provision is to be strictly construed. See Taylor-Rice, 105 Hawai 'i at 110, 94 P.3d at 665.
Because Kaleikini has not yet obtained a final judgment or decree against theState, the State’s immunity bars her request for costs. 
-30­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
reasonable hourly rate. Id.
 
The City argues that the hours billed by Kaleikini’s
 
attorneys are not reasonable because she should not recover fees
 
for (1) her unsuccessful claims; (2) work that was duplicative,
 clerical, or insufficiently documented; and (3) amounts which
 otherwise are not recoverable due to the State’s sovereign
 immunity. Additionally, the City argues that the requested
 hourly rates are not reasonable.
 
For the reasons set forth below, (1) Kaleikini can 
recover fees for work attributable to all of her claims pursuant to Schefke v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai' i 408, 
444, 32 P.3d 52, 88 (2001); (2) the City has not specifically challenged any of the charges as duplicative, clerical, or insufficiently documented; (3) the City is not liable for fees that are directly attributable to other parties; and (4) a lower hourly rate than that requested by Kaleikini’s attorneys is reasonable. 
1.	 Kaleikini can recover fees for work attributable to
 
Counts 5 and 6
 
The City and State argue that Kaleikini should not
 
recover all of her fees because she did not prevail on two of her
 
claims, i.e., her HRS chapter 343 claim (Count 5) and her HRS
 chapter 205A claim (Count 6). The City and State note that
 Kaleikini’s fee request does not ascribe her fees to particular
 claims, and argue that Kaleikini should have allocated the fees
 
-31­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to discrete claims so that this court could discount fees
 
attributable to unsuccessful claims. Because Kaleikini did not
 
allocate her fees to discrete claims, the State requests that
 
Kaleikini’s fees be reduced by 50%. The City requests that the
 fees be reduced by two-thirds because Kaleikini “only prevailed
 on one out of three statutory grounds[.]”
 
In Schefke, this court articulated the following test,
 
derived from Hensley v. Eskerhart, 461 U.S. 424 (1983), for
 determining “whether a partially prevailing plaintiff may recover
 an attorney’s fee for legal services on unsuccessful claims”:
 
the trial court must determine (1) whether or not
unsuccessful claims are related to successful claims,
and (2) whether or not the plaintiff achieved a level
of success that makes the hours reasonably expended a
satisfactory basis for making a fee award. 
Unsuccessful claims are deemed unrelated if they are
distinctly different claims for relief that are based
on different facts and legal theories.  Thus, even
where the claims are brought against the same
defendants, counsel’s work on one claim may be
unrelated to his or her work on another claim, work on
such an unsuccessful claim cannot be deemed to have
 been expended in pursuit of the ultimate result
achieved, and the hours spent on the unsuccessful
claim should be excluded in considering the amount of
a reasonable fee.
 
On the other hand, if the plaintiff’s claims for
relief involve a common core of facts or are based on
 related legal theories and much of counsel’s time is
devoted generally to the litigation as a whole, making
it difficult to divide the hours expended on a
claim-by-claim basis, such a lawsuit cannot be viewed
as a series of discrete claims.  In that situation, a
plaintiff who has won substantial relief should not
have his or her attorney’s fee reduced simply because
the trial court did not adopt each contention raised.
As to the required level of success, where a
plaintiff has obtained excellent results, his or her
attorney should recover a fully compensatory fee
because litigants in good faith may raise alternative
legal grounds for a desired outcome, and the court’s
rejection of or failure to reach certain grounds is
not a sufficient reason for reducing a fee.  If, on
the other hand, a plaintiff has achieved only partial
or limited success, the product of hours reasonably
expended on the litigation as a whole times a
 
-32­  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount even
where the plaintiff’s claims were interrelated,
nonfrivolous, and raised in good faith.
 
Schefke, 96 Hawai' i at 444, 32 P.3d at 88 (citations, internal 
quotation marks, brackets, ellipses, and footnote omitted). 
Kaleikini’s case would appear to be precisely the type 
of case envisioned by the Schefke court as allowing for an award 
of fees attributable to unsuccessful claims. First, Kaleikini’s unsuccessful claims were related to her successful claims. See 
id. All six claims involved a common core of facts, i.e., the 
City and State’s decision to proceed with the rail project absent a completed AIS. Kaleikini, 128 Hawai' i at 60-61, 283 P.3d at 
67-68. In addition, although the claims were based on different statutory provisions, they all were based on a related legal theory, i.e., that a completed AIS was required prior to any decision making on the project. Id. Moreover, this would appear 
to be a case in which “much of counsel’s time is devoted generally to the litigation as a whole[.]” Schefke, 96 Hawai' i 
at 444, 32 P.3d at 88. For example, the argument section of Kaleikini’s opening brief was approximately 23 pages long. The first four pages of argument provided an overview of laws applicable to all six of Kaleikini’s claims. Approximately 13 
pages were dedicated to her successful claims. Approximately six 
pages were dedicated to her unsuccessful claims. Although the
 
arguments concerning her unsuccessful claims cited different
 
statutory provisions and case law, the facts and legal principles
 
-33­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
relied on were nearly identical to those cited in relation to her
 
successful claims, including the importance of native Hawaiian
 burials and the potential for negative consequences if an AIS is
 not completed early in the planning process.
 
Second, Kaleikini “achieved a level of success that 
makes the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for making a fee award.” Id. (brackets omitted). In this regard, 
Kaleikini’s case is nearly indistinguishable from Hensley, which was cited with approval in Schefke. 96 Hawai' i at 444 n.78, 32 
P.3d at 88 n.78. In Hensley, the plaintiffs raised six constitutional challenges, and the trial court found constitutional violations in five of those areas. 461 U.S. at 427-28. The Court stated: 
In this case, for example, the District Court’s award
of fees based on 2,557 hours worked may have been
reasonable in light of the substantial relief
obtained.  But had [the plaintiffs] prevailed on only
one of their six general claims, . . . a fee award
based on the claimed hours clearly would have been
excessive.
 
Id. at 436 (internal citation omitted).
 
Here, Kaleikini obtained relief on four of her six
 
claims, and on the primary issue raised in her appeal. In light
 
of this substantial relief, and the relationship between her
 successful and unsuccessful claims, she may recover fees
 attributable to her unsuccessful claims.
 
-34­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
2.	 The City has not specified which billing entries it
views as duplicative, clerical, or insufficiently
documented
 
The City asserts that some of Kaleikini’s fees are
 
duplicative, associated with clerical tasks, and insufficiently
 
documented. The City does not specify which charges it is
 challenging.
 
This court has declined to discount fees where the 
opponent fails to argue that hours spent on any particular task are unreasonable. Cnty. of Hawai' i v. C&J Coupe Family Ltd. 
P’ship, 120 Hawai' i 400, 407, 208 P.3d 713, 720 (2009) (“The 
County does not argues that . . . the number of hours expended on any particular task is unreasonable. . . . [A]ttorneys’ fees must be awarded . . . for the number of hours requested.”); see also Rapozo v. Better Hearing of Haw., LLC, 120 Hawai' i 257, 265, 
204 P.3d 476, 484 (2009) (“Respondent does not challenge any item on this list or otherwise object to the reasonableness of the requested fees. Consequently, Petitioner’s request for $8,658.00 in attorney fee is granted.”). Moreover, a review of Kaleikini’s request does not indicate that any of the requested fees are duplicative, clerical, or insufficiently documented. 
Accordingly, the City’s argument is without merit.
 
3.	 Some of Kaleikini’s requested fees are attributable
only to the State, and are not recoverable against the
City
 
The City argues that Kaleikini should not be permitted
 
to recover from the City “amounts that would have been
 
-35­  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
attributable to [the State], but for which [Kaleikini] cannot
 
recover due to the State’s sovereign immunity.” Accordingly, the
 
City argues, “if sovereign immunity bars any recovery against
 
[the State], any award against [the City] should be reduced
 accordingly.” The City cites no authority in support of this
 argument. Kaleikini argues that the City and State worked “hand­in-hand” on the rail project, and accordingly that all of her
 fees are recoverable against the City pursuant to Superferry II.
 
Superferry II is not directly on point. There, this 
court considered whether the private attorney general doctrine could serve as a basis for recovery of attorney’s fees against a private party, Hawai' i Superferry, Inc. (Superferry), and 
concluded there was “no reason not to apply the private attorney general doctrine to a private defendant.” 120 Hawai' i at 224-25, 
202 P.3d at 1269-70. In so doing, this court noted: 
[I]n this case Superferry worked hand-in-hand with DOT
throughout the planning and implementation of the
Superferry project and throughout this litigation, in
promoting its own private business interests.  Under
 these facts, we see no unfairness in requiring
Superferry, jointly with DOT, to pay Sierra Club’s
attorney’s fees awarded by the circuit court.
 
Id. at 225, 202 P.3d at 1270.
 
Superferry II indicates that, had an award against the
 
State not been barred by sovereign immunity, the City would have
 
been jointly and severally liable for all of Kaleikini’s fees. 
Accordingly, there is some basis for allowing Kaleikini to
 recover all of her fees against the City. At the same time,
 
-36­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Superferry II is not directly on point because it did not resolve
 
the question at issue here, i.e., whether a defendant may be held
 liable for the full award of attorney’s fees, where an award
 against a co-defendant is barred by sovereign immunity.
 
In the instant case, we conclude that it is reasonable
 
for Kaleikini to recover against the City for all of the work
 performed, except for work that is clearly identifiable as being
 directed at another party, such as Kaleikini’s replies to the
 State and FACE/PRP. Allowing Kaleikini to recover against the
 City for work that was directed at all parties (such as the
 opening brief and transfer application) is reasonable in light of
 the City having taken a leading role in the appeal and in the
 trial court. For example, the City’s answering brief was 35
 pages long and addressed each of the Counts in Kaleikini’s
 complaint, including Count 5, which ran only against the State. 
In contrast, the State’s answering brief was 15 pages long and
 addressed only Counts 1 through 4.
 
Kaleikini’s billing records clearly indicate that 18
 
hours of Frankel’s time and 2.8 hours of Obrey’s time cannot be
 fairly attributed to addressing the City:

Obrey 9/10/12 Review amicus brief to determine if meheula complied with court’sorder[.] 0.5 
Based on the foregoing, we grant Kaleikini’s request
 
for fees for 120.4 hours of work performed by Frankel (138.4
 
requested hours minus 18 hours) and 31.7 hours of work performed
 by Obrey (34.5 requested hours minus 2.8 hours).
 
4. The requested hourly rate is not reasonable
 
Kaleikini requests that attorney Frankel be awarded
 
fees at a rate of $350.00 per hour, and that attorney Obrey be
 
awarded fees at a rate of $190.00 per hour. Both the City and
 Kaleikini agree that a reasonable attorney’s fee should be
 calculated according to prevailing market rates in the relevant
 community. (Citing Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895 (1984)).
 
Kaleikini asserts that her requested rates are at or
 
below prevailing market rates in the community. Kaleikini
 submits two declarations in support of this assertion. First,
 Kaleikini attached a declaration from Matthew Adams, who declared
 that he is a California attorney who represents the plaintiffs in
 a federal lawsuit relating to the rail project,
 Honolulutraffic.com, et al. v. Federal Transit Administration, et
 
-38­ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
al., Civ. No. 11-00307 AWT. He declared that his hourly rate in
 
that case was $570.00, and that his co-counsel’s rate was $800.00
 per hour. Additionally, he declared that the federal case
 involved issues similar to those in the instant case. Kaleikini
 also attached a declaration of James J. Bickerton, who declared
 that the rates requested by Kaleikini’s attorneys were “at or
 below the prevailing market hourly rate for professionals of
 similar experience, skill and competence.”
 
The City argues that Kaleikini’s requested rates are 
not reasonable. The City does not suggest an alternative rate that would be reasonable, but points to cases in both state and federal courts in Hawai' i in which attorneys were compensated at 
lower rates than those requested here. In response, Kaleikini cites to cases in both state and federal courts in which attorneys were compensated at the same or higher rates as those requested here. 
The most recent state case cited by the parties that 
addresses hourly rates is C&J Coupe. There, the requested hourly 
rate was not challenged by the opposing party, and this court 
determined that the rates “appear[ed] to be reasonable[.]” 120 Hawai'i at 407, 208 P.3d at 720. The rates were as follows: 
Kenneth R. Kupchak $335-350 
Robert H. Thomas $300-325 
Mark M. Murakami $220-230 
Robert D. Harris $190 
Christie-Anne H. Kudo-Chock $145-150

In a recent unpublished federal district court order in
 
Olson v. Lui, No. 10-00691 ACK-RLP, 2012 WL 3686682 (D. Haw. Aug.
 
27, 2012), the court awarded attorney’s fees at the following
 rates:
 
Paul Alston $450 
Pamela W. Bunn $270 
Shellie Park-Hoapili $200 
Noreen M. Kanada $100 
Gail Pang $50 
Id. at *2-5.
 
The order indicated that Alston had more than 40 years
 
of experience, Bunn had 15, and Park-Hoapili had almost seven.16
 
Id. at *3-4.
 
Here, Frankel was admitted to practice in 1992 (20
 
years prior to the 2012 decision in Kaleikini), and Obrey in 2009
 (3 years). Using the foregoing rates as a guide, we conclude
 that $300.00 per hour is a reasonable hourly rate for Frankel,
 and $160.00 is a reasonable hourly rate for Obrey. These rates

 Although the opinion did not list the years of experience for each 
attorney, a review of the Hawai 'i State Bar Association’s 2009-2010 Annual 
Directory indicates that Kupchak was admitted to practice in 1971 (38 years
prior to the 2009 decision in C&J Coupe), Thomas in 1987 (22 years), Murakami
in 1999 (10 years), Harris in 2002 (7 years), and Kudo-Chock in 2007 (2years).  Agua-Andrews and Kincaid are not listed in the Directory.

are well within the range of associate and partner rates listed
 
in the Pacific Business News 2012 Book of Lists, which was
 attached to Kaleikini’s request as Appendix C.
17
 
Based on the foregoing, we grant Kaleikini’s request
 
for fees in the amount of $36,120.00 for work performed by
 Frankel (120.4 hours x $300.00 per hour), and $5,072.00 for work
 performed by Obrey (31.7 hours x $160.00 per hour), for a total
 award of $41,192.00.
 
F.	 Kaleikini is not entitled to an enhancement of the lodestar
 
amount
 
Kaleikini asks that this court enhance her attorney’s
 
fee award by a multiplier of two, based on this court’s opinion
 
in Schefke. The City argues that an enhancement is not available
 under Schefke, nor is it supported by the policies underlying
 Schefke. The City also argues that an enhancement by a
 multiplier of two would be unreasonable. Kaleikini responds that
 an enhancement is supported by the reasoning in Schefke, and that
 Schefke expressly leaves the door open for an enhanced award for
 non-profit public interest law firms. For the reasons set forth
 below, Kaleikini’s argument is without merit.
 
In Schefke, the trial court awarded fees based on the 
lodestar method, but denied the plaintiff’s request for a multiplier. 96 Hawai' i at 419, 32 P.3d at 63. On appeal, this 
17
 The list provides a range of partner billing rates from $150.00 to
 
$595.00 at the top 50 ranked firms.  The list provides a range of associate
billing rates from $120.00 to $300.00 at the same firms.
 
-41­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
court vacated the fee award on other grounds, and also addressed
 
the enhancement issue. Id. at 445, 32 P.3d 89. After reviewing
 
conflicting federal case law concerning enhancements, id. at
 
445-51, 32 P.3d at 89-95, this court held that “where a court
 awards attorney’s fees pursuant to fee-shifting statutes in cases
 involving contingency fee arrangements,” the contingent fee
 arrangement does not place a ceiling on the amount of fees
 recoverable, id. at 450-51, 32 P.3d at 94-95. Thus, “should a
 fee agreement provide less than a reasonable fee, the defendant
 should nevertheless be required to pay the higher amount.” Id.
 
at 451, 32 P.3d at 95 (brackets and ellipses omitted) (quoting
 Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489 U.S. 87, 93 (1989). This court
 continued:
 
For example, if a nonprofit legal service organization
represents a plaintiff and agrees to receive no
compensation from the plaintiff, that fact will not
bar the plaintiff from obtaining a reasonable fee
award when he or she prevails.  Thus, in this case,
the fact that doubling Plaintiff’s lodestar fees would
result in more fees than Plaintiff agreed to pay his
attorney should not in itself prevent Plaintiff from
receiving that amount.  However, if the doubled amount
exceeds a “reasonable” fee, Plaintiff is not entitled
to the exceeded amount.
 
Id. at 451, 32 P.3d at 95.
 
In sum, this court concluded that “our courts should be
 
given discretion to enhance the lodestar fee when an attorney has
 
been retained on a contingency fees basis.” Id. at 452, 32 P.3d
 
at 96.
 
By its clear terms, the holding in Schefke does not
 
apply in the instant case. First, Schefke was clearly limited to
 
-42­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
cases involving fee-shifting statutes. Id. at 454, 32 P.3d at 98
 
(“We note that this holding applies only to statutes with fee-
shifting provisions enacted to encourage the enforcement of law
 through lawsuits filed by private persons.” (internal quotation
 marks, ellipses, and citation omitted)). Here, however,
 Kaleikini seeks fees pursuant to the private attorney general
 doctrine, rather than a fee-shifting statute.
 
Second, Schefke is clearly limited to cases taken on a
 
contingency basis:
 
A court must first determine whether a case was taken
 
on a contingency basis because if a client has
contracted to pay the lodestar fee, regardless of the
outcome of the case, and has paid the attorney on a
continuing basis, then the attorney has clearly
avoided the risk of nonpayment and enhancement is not
appropriate.
 
Id. at 454, 32 P.3d at 98 (internal quotation marks, ellipses and
 
brackets omitted).
 
Here, NHLC did not take Kaleikini’s case on a
 
contingency basis. Although Kaleikini asserts that, “[i]n this
 case, the payment of any fees was purely contingent on prevailing
 on the merits[,]” (emphasis added), she acknowledges that there
 was no contingent fee arrangement by which she would pay NHLC in
 the event she prevailed.
 
Nevertheless, Kaleikini points to the following
 
sentence from Schefke as indicating that her fee request was
 
intended to be covered by the Schefke rule: “ For example, if a
 
nonprofit legal service organization represents a plaintiff and
 
-43­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
agrees to receive no compensation from the plaintiff, that fact
 
will not bar the plaintiff from obtaining a reasonable fee award
 when he or she prevails.” Id. at 451, 32 P.3d at 95. However,
 
read in context, it is not apparent that this sentence was
 intended to extend the Schefke enhancement rule to circumstances
 in which a legal service organization represents a client without
 the expectation of compensation. Rather, it appears that this
 court viewed such a circumstance as analogous to an enhancement,
 in that the legal service provider could receive more fees from
 the defendant than what the plaintiff had originally contracted
 to pay.
18 Moreover, this single statement is not sufficient to
 
override the repeated statements by the Schefke court that the
 holding there was specific to contingency fee arrangements. See,
 
e.g., id. at 450-51, 32 P.3d at 94-95 (allowing enhancements
 “where a court awards attorney’s fees pursuant to fee-shifting
 statutes in cases involving contingency fee arrangements”); id.
 at 454, 32 P.3d at 98 (noting that one of three factors a court
 must consider in determining whether to award an enhancement is
 “whether a case was taken on a contingent basis” (internal
 quotation marks and citation omitted)).
 
Moreover, the policies underlying Schefke do not
 
18
 The enhancement is designed to prevent the contingent fee from
 
being a “ceiling” on the attorney’s compensation. See id. at 450, 32 P.3d at
 
94. Put another way, under a contingency arrangement, an attorney may
contract to receive less than a reasonable fee -- and less than the lodestar
 
amount -- from his or her client.  However, the enhancement allows the
attorney to receive a reasonable fee award from the defendant, even if that
fee exceeds what the client would have paid the attorney under the contingency
arrangement.
 
-44­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
support an extension of the enhancement rule to the circumstances
 
of this case. The purpose of an enhancement in contingency fee
 cases is to ensure that the attorney is awarded a reasonable fee. 
See id. at 451, 32 P.3d at 95. “Contingency enhancements merely
 compensate lawyers at market rates for services lawyers provide
 to clients who win.” Id. at 453, 32 P.3d at 97 (quoting Charles
 
Silver, Incoherence and Irrationality in the Law of Attorneys’
 Fees, 12 Rev. Litig. 301, 332 (1993)). Although Schefke clearly
 states that the fee may be enhanced beyond the lodestar, “[t]here
 is a ‘strong presumption’ that the lodestar represents the
 ‘reasonable’ fee.” Id. at 443 n.72, 32 P.3d at 87 n.72
 
(quotation marks and brackets omitted); see also Perdue v. Kenny
 A., 559 U.S. 542, --, 130 S.Ct. 1662, 1673 (2010) (“[T]here is a
 ‘strong presumption’ that the lodestar figure is reasonable, but
 that presumption may be overcome in those rare circumstances in
 which the lodestar does not adequately take into account a factor
 that may properly be considered in determining a reasonable
 fee.”).
 
Here, Kaleikini offers no argument to rebut the
 
presumption that the lodestar is reasonable. The only factors
 she relies on asserting that she is entitled to a multiplier of
 two are (1) any award of fees in this case was contingent on
 Kaleikini prevailing and seeking fees from defendants; (2) her
 attorneys’ time could have been spent representing “other
 deserving native Hawaiians”; and (3) this court’s decision
 
-45­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
involved “significant and broad issues of great public interest.” 
However, these factors do not establish that the lodestar is
 unreasonable, or that an enhancement is necessary to achieve a
 reasonable fee.
 
Finally, it should be noted that Kaleikini’s requested 
enhancement exceeds the multiplier that is ordinarily awarded. Schefke, 96 Hawai' i at 455, 32 P.3d at 99. Although the 
enhancement in “typical contingency cases rang[es] between twenty and thirty-five percent of the lodestar[,]” id., Kaleikini requests a multiplier of two, i.e., one hundred percent of the lodestar. Such an enhancement is exceedingly rare, id. at 455-56 n.102, 32 P.3d at 99-100 n.102 (noting that a 100% enhancement had been awarded only in civil rights cases and only three times between 1980 and 1985), and 
will be appropriate only in the rare and exceptional
case in which the risk of nonpayment has not been
mitigated at all, i.e., where the “legal” risk
constitutes an economic disincentive independent of
that created by the basic contingency in payment and
the result achieved is significant and of broad public
interest.
 
Id. at 456, 32 P.3d at 100 (brackets omitted) (quoting Rendine v.
 
Pantzer, 661 A.2d 1202, 1231 (N.J. 1995)).
 
Kaleikini has not presented any argument to support
 
such an extraordinary multiplier. Moreover, the prospect of
 Kaleikini receiving any fees in this case, even is she prevailed,
 was entirely speculative in light of this court’s limited case
 law on the private attorney general doctrine. Thus, it does not
 appear that lack of payment was an economic disincentive for her
 
-46­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
counsel. Additionally, although this case was significant and
 
the public will benefit from the decision, “the result achieved
 cannot be said to be of such significant and broad interest as to
 justify a multiplier of two.” See id. (internal quotation marks
 
and ellipses omitted).
 
In sum, Schefke does not apply and Kaleikini offers
 
insufficient argument to rebut the presumption that the lodestar
 represents a reasonable fee. Accordingly, the imposition of an
 enhancement in this case is unwarranted.
 
G. Kaleikini is entitled to her requested costs
 
Kaleikini asserts that she incurred $343.00 in costs
 
relating to her appeal, consisting of $275.00 in court costs for
 
the filing of the appeal and $68.00 for the cost of printing
 briefs and appendices on appeal (170 pages x 4 copies at 10¢ per
 page). Kaleikini asserts that these costs are authorized
 pursuant to HRAP Rule 39(c) (2012), which provides, “Costs in the
 appellate courts are defined as: . . . (3) the fee for filing the
 appeal; [and] (4) the cost of printing or otherwise producing
 necessary copies of briefs and appendices, provided that copying
 costs shall not exceed 20¢ per page[.]”
 
The City objects to some of Kaleikini’s requested costs
 
relating to work in the trial court, but does not specifically
 object to any of the costs Kaleikini requests in relation to her

appeal.19 At the same time, the City argues that Kaleikini’s
 
“only possible recoverable cost is the $275 appellate filing
 
fee.” The City does not explain why Kaleikini’s $68.00 in costs
 for copying briefs and appendices should be disallowed.
 
Recovery of the $275.00 appellate filing cost is
 
expressly permitted pursuant to HRAP Rule 39(c)(3), and the City
 does not object to this cost item. Accordingly, we grant
 Kaleikini’s request for $275.00 in appellate filing costs.
 
In addition, Kaleikini’s copying costs are expressly 
recoverable under HRAP Rule 39(c)(4). This court has noted that costs recoverable pursuant to HRAP Rule 39(c)(4) include “those briefs encompassed by HRAP Rule 28, including the number of copies required by HRAP Appendix A.” Kamalu v. ParEn, Inc., 110 
Hawai'i 269, 279, 132 P.3d 378, 388 (2006). In addition, HRAP 
Rule 32.1 requires parties to deliver to the appellate clerk paper copies of the documents specified in HRAP Appendix A, which includes four copies of opening, answering, and reply briefs. 
Here, Kaleikini’s opening brief consisted of 43 pages
 
and the attached appendices consisted of 128 pages, for a total
 of 171 pages. Accordingly, Kaleikini’s request for $68.00 in
 copying costs (170 pages x 4 copies at 10¢ per page) is
 reasonable, and would appear to be less than Kaleikini actually

 The State does not provide any argument with respect to
 
Kaleikini’s costs.

expended.20 We therefore grant Kaleikini’s request for $68.00 in
 
copying costs.
 
Based on the foregoing, we grant Kaleikini’s request
 
for costs in the amount of $343.00.
 
III. CONCLUSION
 
Kaleikini’s request for appellate attorney’s fees and
 
costs is granted against the City in the amount of $41,192.00 in
 
attorney’s fees and $343.00 in costs. Kaleikini’s request for
 trial level fees and costs is denied, without prejudice to her
 seeking those fees and costs in the circuit court.

 Additionally, it appears that Kaleikini has not sought costs for
 
her reply briefs.
