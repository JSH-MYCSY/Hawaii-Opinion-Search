 HRS § 291C-105, entitled “Excessive speeding,” provides in
 
relevant parts as follows:
 
(a) No person shall drive a motor vehicle at a speed
exceeding:
(1) The applicable state or county speed limit by
  
   
     the State of Hawai' i (the State) filed an application for 
transfer on October 26, 2012. On November 21, 2012 this court
 
accepted transfer of the case. We vacate the court’s March 19,
 2012 Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment,
 and instruct the court to dismiss the charge without prejudice.
 
I.
 
On January 1, 2012, Defendant was cited for excessive
 
speeding for traveling seventy-three miles per hour in a thirty-
five mile per hour speed zone, HRS § 291C-105(a)(1) (2007).
 
Defendant was arraigned and charged on March 19, 2011.
 
The oral charge did not allege a state of mind for the offense:
 
[THE  STATE]:   On  or  about  January  1,  2011,  in  the  City  and
County  of  Honolulu,  [S]tate  of  Hawai[ ']i,  you  did  drive  a  motor
vehicle  at  a  speed  exceeding  the  applicable  state  or  county  speed
limit  by  30  miles  per  hour  or  more  thereby  violating  Section  291C
Subsection  105([a])(1)  of  the  [HRS].   This  is  your  first  offense
 
in  the  last  five  years.   How  do  you  plead  -- do  you  understand  the
 
charge  against  you?
[
DEFENDANT]: Yes, I do.
 
THE  COURT:   And  how  do  you  plead?
 
[DEFENDANT]:   Not  guilty.
 
Following his arraignment, Defendant’s defense counsel orally
 moved to dismiss the charge for failure to include the requisite
 state of mind for the offense:
 
[DEPUTY  PUBLIC  DEFENDER]:   Your  Honor,  before  we  begin
defense  would  be  making  an  oral  motion  to  dismiss  for  defective
complaint,  a  failure  to  state  a  state  of  mind.   There  is  a  current
 
case  pending  in  the  supreme  court,  the  Nesmith  case,  that
addresses  this  exact  issue.   So  we’d  ask  to  dismiss  due  to
 
defective  complaint.
   
[THE  STATE]:   Uh,  the  -- it’s  the  State’s  understanding  that
the  Nesmith  case  concerns  [HRS  §]  291E-61  and  not  the  section  at
issue  today.
[DEPUTY  PUBLIC  DEFENDER]:   Also,  Your  Honor,  there’s  no
 
definition  of  “public  street”  stated  in  the  complaint,  so  we’d
 
t
hirty miles per hour or more[.]
 
2
      
        
        
    
      
       
        
         
       
  
         
      
       
     
     also ask for dismissal on that.
 
[THE  STATE]:   Um,  all  -- all  definitions  in  this  section
 
fall  under  [HRS  §]  291C-1  unless  otherwise  specified.
 
The court summarily denied the motion.
 
At the conclusion of the bench trial, the court found
 
Defendant guilty as charged.
 
In his opening brief, Defendant raised three points of
 
error:
 
1. The district court erred in denying [Defendant’s]
motion to dismiss because the oral charge failed to
allege the requisite mens rea.
 
2. The district court violated [Defendant’s]
constitutional right to testify when it failed to
properly advise him of his right pursuant to Tachibana
v. State[, 79 Hawai 'i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995)] and
ensure whether [Defendant’s] waiver of such right wasvoluntary and knowing. 
3. The [court] erred because the State did not
establish sufficient foundation for the accuracy of
the speed reading and that Officer Maeshiro was
qualified to operate the Ultralyte laser.
 
The State answered each point of error:
 
1. As to point one, the State argues that HRS § 291C-105(a)
 
describes an absolute liability offense for which the state of
 
3
mind requirements of HRS § 702-204 (1993)  do not apply.  The
 
State argues that a negligent state of mind may be specified by
 
the definition of an offense but cannot be incorporated into an
 offense through HRS § 702-204.
 
3
 HRS § 702-204 provides as follows:
 
Except  as  provided  in  section  702-212,  a  person  is  not
guilty  of  an  offense  unless  the  person  acted  intentionally,
knowingly,  recklessly,  or  negligently,  as  the  law  specifies,  with
respect  to  each  element  of  the  offense.   When  the  state  of  mind
 
required  to  establish  an  element  of  an  offense  is  not  specified  by
the  law,  that  element  is  established  if,  with  respect  thereto,  a
person  acts  intentionally,  knowingly,  or  recklessly.
 
3
          
              
           
           
        
         
                
           
          
           2. As to point two, the State concedes the Tachibana issue.
 
3. As to point three, the State argues that sufficient
 
foundation was laid to admit the speed reading as substantial
 
evidence of Defendant’s speed.
 
The State filed an application for transfer on October
 
26, 2012.
 
The State sought a mandatory transfer pursuant to HRS §
 
602-58(a)(1).4 The State asserted that Defendant’s first point
 
of error (whether a charge for excessive speeding must set forth
 the state of mind requirements) implicates a question of
 fundamental public importance. 
The State also sought a discretionary transfer pursuant
 
to HRS § 602-58(b)(1).
5 The State asserted that issues of
 
whether HRS § 291C-105(a) constitutes an absolute liability
 offense so that the state of mind requirements of HRS § 702-204
 do not apply or whether absolute liability may plainly appear
 from the language of a statute itself have never been addressed.
6
 
II.
 
On July 19, 2012, this court accepted an application
 
4 HRS § 602-58(a)(1) provides in relevant part that “[t]he supreme
 
court, in the manner and within the time provided by the rules of court, shall
grant an application to transfer any case within the jurisdiction of the
intermediate appellate court to the supreme court upon the grounds that the
case involves”“a question of imperative or fundamental public importance.”
 
5
 HRS § 602-58(b)(1) provides in relevant part that “[t]he supreme
 
court . . . may grant an application to transfer . . . upon grounds that the
case involves” “a question of first impression or a novel legal question.”
 
6
 Because our ruling on Defendant’s first point of error disposes of
 
the case, we do not reach his remaining questions raised on appeal.

 for transfer in State v. Gonzalez, No. SCAP-11-0000500, 128 
Hawai'i 314, 288 P.3d 788, 2012 WL 5970946 (Nov. 28, 2012), which 
presented identical issues with respect to the sufficiency of a charge of excessive speeding. A published opinion in Gonzalez was filed on November 28, 2012. 
III.
 
Logically, the discretionary issue pertaining to strict 
liability must be answered first. The State raises nearly identical arguments to those it raised in Gonzalez regarding strict liability. In Gonzalez, we held that “neither the plain language of the statute nor the legislative history supported the State’s contention that HRS § 291C-105(a) is a strict liability offense.” 2012 WL 5970946 at *9 (citing State v. Buch, 83 Hawai'i 308, 316, 926 P.2d 599, 607 (1996)). Therefore, “HRS § 
702-204 applies to HRS § 291C-105(a),” and “the State must prove that a defendant acted intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly,” in a charge of excessive speeding. Id. (citing Buch, 83 Hawai' i 
at 316, 926 P.2d at 607). HRS § 291C-105(a) then is not a strict liability offense, but instead requires that the State prove that a defendant acted intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. Id. 
IV.
 
The mandatory transfer issue in the instant case was
 
also raised in Gonzalez. In Gonzalez, “after the charge was
 read, Defendant orally moved to dismiss the charge, arguing that
 the oral charge ‘fail[ed] to state the requisite state of mind’
 
5
           
              
              
          under HRS § 702-204.” Id. at *1.7 The State “responded by 
arguing that a defendant’s state of mind is not an element of an 
offense, and, as such, need not be alleged in an oral charge.” Id. The district court “denied Defendant’s motion, ruling that 
when a statute does not expressly set forth the culpable state of mind, but rather imports the mens rea element from [HRS § 702­212], that ‘obviates the need of the [S]tate to articulate a state of mind.’” Id. In Gonzalez, the State agreed that, if HRS 
§ 291C-105(a) contains a mens rea requirement, then the oral charge in that case was insufficient under State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai'i 48, 276 P.3d 617 (2012). Gonzalez, 2012 WL 5970946 at 
*9. 
This court held in Gonzalez that, “as in Nesmith, the 
defendant objected to the failure to allege the requisite state of mind at trial.” Id. at *9 (citing Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i at 51, 
276 P.3d at 620.). Gonzalez stated that in Nesmith, “this court 
reasoned that ‘state of mind requirements, though not an element of an offense” were required to be included in the charges against the defendant in order ‘to alert the defendants of precisely what they needed to defend against to avoid a conviction.’” Id. (quoting Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i at 56, 276 P.3d 
at 625.)). According to Gonzalez, Nesmith “held that the state of mind must be included in a charge or the case must be 
7
 In this case, as in Gonzalez and Nesmith , the defendant objected
 
to the failure to allege the requisite state of mind at trial. See Gonzalez ,
2012 WL 5970946 at *9 (“In this case, as in Nesmith , the defendant objected to
the failure to allege the requisite state of mind at trial.”)
 
6
 dismissed without prejudice.” Id. (citing Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 
at 54, 276 P.3d at 623)). Because the charge in Gonzalez did not 
refer to the requisite states of mind, Nesmith “mandate[d] dismissal without prejudice.” Id. Likewise, the absence of an 
allegation of the requisite states of mind in the instant case requires dismissal of the excessive speeding charge without prejudice. 
V.
 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate Defendant’s
 
conviction and remand this case to the court with instructions to
 dismiss the charge without prejudice, because HRS § 291C-105(a)
 is not a strict liability offense and the oral charge herein
 failed to allege the requisite states of mind.
