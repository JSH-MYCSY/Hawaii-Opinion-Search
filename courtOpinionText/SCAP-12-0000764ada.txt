OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.
 
  
I. Introduction 
Following the publication of 
our opinion in Gurrobat v. HTH 
Corp.
, 133 Hawai i 1, 323 P.3d 792 (2014), Plaintiff­
Appellee/Cross-Appellant Raymond Gurrobat (“Gurrobat”) ,

 Gurrobat  initially requested $555.45 in costs, but withdrew 
entries totaling $19.90 in his  reply memorandum; Gurrobat  also  put his  
requested costs at $589.25 at one point, but this appears to be a 
typographical error.

persons, requested that we award him attorneys’ fees and costs 
for his appeal and cross-appeal, and provide for interest on the 
judgment. Gurrobat bases his request for fees and costs on 
Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure (“HRAP”) Rule 39 (2007), and 
on the fee shifting provisions found in Hawai i Revised Statutes 
(“HRS”) §§ 388 -11(c) (Supp. 1999) and 480-13(a) (2008). He 
bases his request for interest on HRAP Rule 37 (2000). In 
total, Gurrobat requests an award of atto rneys’ fees based on a 
lodestar of $90,422.50 and enhanced based on a multiplier to be determined by the court, 4.712% general excise tax on the 
awarded fees, $535.55 in costs,
1 and an award of post judgment 
interest on the damages affirmed in our opinion. 
Defendants-Appellants/Cross-Appellees HTH Corp. and Pacific 
Beach Corp. (“Defendants”) acknowledge that Gurrobat is entitled 
to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs under HRS § 388-11(c) 
for prevailing on their appeal, but contend he is not entitled 
to fees and costs under HRS § 480-13(a)(1) for his successful 
cross-appeal. In addition, Defendants oppose many individual 
time entries in Gurrobat’s fee request as being vague and/or 
block billed. Defendants also claim that any fees awarded should be subject to a downward adjustment of thirty percent

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
because the key issue underlying Defendants ’ appeal was largely 
decided by this court in Villon v. Marriott Hotel Services, 
Inc.
, 130 Hawai i 130, 306 P.3d 175 (2013). Defendants oppose 
all but $18.85 of Gurrobat’s costs requested on various grounds.  
Finally, Defendants assert that an award of interest should be 
denied as premature, and is better left to the discretion of the 
trial court. 
We hold that Gurrobat is entitled to attorneys’ fees for 
both the appeal and cross-appeal, in the amount of $84,032.50, 
plus $3,959.61 in general excise tax.  We also award costs in 
the amount of $435.55. In addition, we hold Defendants jointly 
and severally liable for the payment of Gurrobat’s attorneys’ 
fees and costs. Finally, we hold that post judgment interest is 
not appropriate under the circumstances of this case. 
II. Background 
Gurrobat filed a class action complaint in the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit (“circuit court”), asserting claims 
for damages under both Hawaii ’s wage laws, HRS §§ 388-6 (1993) 
and 388-10 (Supp. 1999), and under Hawaii’s unfair methods of 
competition (“UMOC”) provisions, HRS §§ 480 -2(e) (2008) and 480­
13(a). Gurrobat , 133 Hawai i at 3, 323 P.3d at 794.  The lawsuit 
was based on Defendants’ violations of HRS § 481B -14 (2008) for 
charging customers of the Pacific Beach Hotel and the Pagoda 
Hotel service charges without fully disclosing to customers that 
3
      
 
 
  
   
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
   
    

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the charges were not entirely being distributed to non-managerial service employees. 
Id.  
The circuit court ultimately granted summary judgment 
for 
Gurrobat on the wage law claims, awarded $1,678,783 in damages, 
and held Defendants jointly and severally liable for the 
damages. 133 Hawai i at 10, 323 P.3d at 801.  The circuit court, 
however, granted summary judgment for Defendants on the UMOC 
claims. 133 Hawai i at 3, 323 P.3d at 794.  Defendants appealed 
the circuit court’s grant of summary judgment on the wage law 
claims; Gurrobat cross-appealed the circu it court’s grant of 
summary judgment on the UMOC claims. 133 Hawai i at 4, 323 P.3d 
at 795. 
This court accepted a discretionary transfer from the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals pursuant to HRS § 602-58(b)(1) 
(Supp. 2011). On February 25, 2014, we issued our opinion in 
Gurrobat, 133 Hawai i 1, 323 P.3d 792 (“Opinion”). The Opinion 
(1) affirmed the circuit court’s order granting Gurrobat’s  
motion for class certification; (2) affirmed the circuit court’s 
grant of summary judgment as to the unpaid wages under HRS 
Chapter 388; and (3) affirmed in part the award of damages as to 
the HRS Chapter 388 claim.   133 Hawai i at 23, 323 P.3d at 814.   
We vacated, however, the portion of the grant of summary  
judgment as to damages under HRS Chapter 388  that imposed joint

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and several liability on Defendants and remanded for further 
proceedings to properly apportion damages between Defendants.2 
Id. The Opinion further held that the circuit court erred in 
granting Defendants ’   motion for summary judgment on the UMOC  
claims, and that  Gurrobat had established the necessary elements  
to recover damages under HRS §§ 480-2 and 480-13 for violations 
of HRS § 481B-14.  133 Hawai i at 23-24, 323 P.3d at 814-15.  We  
therefore vacated the circuit court’s order granting Defendants’ 
motion for summary judgment on Gurrobat’s UMOC claim, and 
remanded the claim to the circuit court for further proceedings 
consistent with the Opinion.   133 Hawai i at 24, 323 P.3d at 815.   
Gurrobat 
then timely filed a “Motion for Attorneys’ Fees 
and Costs and Provision of Interest .” Defendants filed a 
Memorandum in Opposition; Gurrobat filed a Reply. We denied the 
motion without prejudice because it did not substantially comply 
with HRAP Form 8. Gurrobat then filed a compliant First Amended 
Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs and Provision of Interest 
(“Motion”). Following a substitution of counsel, Defendants 
filed a new Memorandum in Opposition (“Opposition”) on July 28, 
One of the two defendants, HTH C orporation, operated both hotels 
where service charges were unlawfully withheld from service employees; the 
other defendant, Pacific Beach Corporation, only operated one of the two hotels, and therefore could only be held liable for injuries to employees a t 
that hotel.

 The “American Rule” provides that each party is normally 
responsible for paying h is or her attorneys’ fees .   Schefke v. 
Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd. , 96 Hawai i  408, 444, 32 P.3d 
52, 88 (2001).  Attorneys’ fees are only, therefore, “charg eable 
against the opposing party when so authorized by statute, rule 
of court, agreement, stipulation, or precedent.”  Lee v. Aiu, 85 
Hawaii 19, 32, 936 P.2d 655, 668 (1997) (citation omitted).   
    
  
 
 
                     
 3  In  his  Reply, Gurrobat  questions  the appropriateness of  
Defendants raising new substantive arguments in response to what he  
characterizes  as   a “non-substantive filing made to meet form requirements.”     
Reply  at  9.   While Gurrobat  styles  the Motion as   a “First    Amended Motion,”   it   
was filed after the original  motion  was denied  without  prejudice,  and is  
therefore better considered as a new motion rather than an  amended one.  See  
generally  5 Wright  & Miller  Federal  Practice  and Procedure:  Civil 3d  § 1194  
(“In   theory, a motion   may be   amended at any time   before  the  judge has acted  
upon  the request . .   . .”) (emphasis added).  We  will  therefore consider  only  
the July 28, 2014 filing as the Opposition to this motion.   
 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
2014 that raised objections not found in the prior opposition.3 
Gurrobat then filed a new Reply Memorandum (“Reply”). 
III. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs 
A. Availability of Attorneys’ Fees 
Gurrobat’ s attorneys’ fees request is based on several 
statutes. Gurrobat asserted claims based on Defendants’ 
violation of Hawaii’s hotel or restaurant service charge law, HRS § 481B-14. HRS § 481B-4 deems violations of Chapter 481B to 
be “unfair method[s] of competition . . . within the meaning of 
section 480-2. ” HRS 480-13(a), in turn, provides a private 
cause of action for those injured by violations of Chapter 480. 
6
      
 
 
     
 
 
 Defendants’ objections are based on their reading of the 
text of these two statutes, so we begin with a comparison.  
  
   
 Defendants  essentially argue that HRS §  480-13(a) allows  
for attorneys’ fees on appeal only when the trial court decision 
appealed from resulted in a final judgment for the plaintiff.  
The circuit court issued a judgment that was for  Gurrobat on  his    
     
   

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In addition, we have held that employees harmed by violations of 
HRS § 481B-4 may bring actions to enforce their rights and seek 
remedies under HRS § 388-11. See Villon, 130 Hawai i at 132-33, 
306 P.3d at 177-78. 
Gurrobat therefore bases his request for attor neys’ fees on 
the statutory fee shifting provisions found in HRS §§ 388-11(c) 
and 480-13(a). Defendants acknowledge that Gurrobat is entitled 
to fees under the former, but claim that fees are not available 
under the latter under the circumstances of this case. 
HRS § 388-11(c) reads, in relevant part: 
The court in  any action  brought under this  section shall,  
in  addition  to  any  judgment  awarded to  the plaintiff or  
plaintiffs, allow interest of six per  cent per year from  
the date  the wages  were  due,  costs of action, includi ng 
costs of   fees   of   any nature, and   reasonable   attorney’s   
fees, to be paid by the defendant. . . .  
 
HRS § 480-13(a)(1) reads, in relevant part: 
[A]ny  person who is injured in    the person’s business    or   
property by reason of anything forbidden or declared  
unlawful by  this  chapter  . . .  [m]ay  sue for damages 
sustained by the person, and, if the judgment is for the 
plaintiff, the plaintiff shall be awarded a sum not less 
than  $1,000  or  threefold damages by  the plaintiff  
sustained, whichever sum is the greater , and reasonable  
attorney’s fees together with the costs of suit  . . . .

 This court denied Nelson’s requ est for fees without 
prejudice, finding that the award of fees was inappropriate, as 
Nelson’s appellate victory “merely vacate[d] a trial court 
judgment unfavorable to the plaintiff, and place[d] the 
plaintiff back where the plaintiff started.”  99 Hawai i at 266,  
54 P.3d at 437.   Defendants therefore claim that Nelson  bars an  
    

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HRS Chapter 388 claims, but which was against him on his HRS 
Chapter 480 claims. Therefore, Defendants assert, the 
“judgment” required under HRS § 480-13(a)(1) is absent and 
Gurrobat cannot recover fees for hours expended on his cross-appeal of the circuit court’s grant of summary judgment for 
Defendants on the Chapter 480 claim. 
In support of their argument, Defendants cite to our 
decision in Nelson v. University of Hawai i, 99 Hawai i 262, 
54 P.3d 433 (2002). In Nelson , plaintiffs requested attorneys’ 
fees following a successful appeal that vacated a trial court judgment in favor of defendants  and remanded the case for a new 
trial. 99 Hawai i at 264, 54 P.3d 435.  Plaintiffs in that case 
based their fee request on HRS § 378-5(c), a fee  shifting 
statute that provides:  
In any action brought under this part, the court, in 
addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff or plaintiffs, shall allow costs of action, including costs of 
fees of any nature and reasonable attorney’s fee s, to be 
paid by the defendant. 
99 Hawai i at 265, 54 P.3d at   436.

  When interpreting a statute, we follow well established 
principles: 
  
    
  
      
 
 
  
     
        
 
   
    
 
 
 
 
 The word “judgment” may be defined as “a court’s final 
determination of the rights and obligations of the parties in a 
case.”    Black’s Law Dictionary   858 (8th ed. 2004).   A judgment 
on appeal meets this definition.   In Nelson, this court 
addressed the question of whether a judgment on appeal could be 
a judgment for the purposes of an award of fees.  99 Hawai i  at 
265, 54 P.3d at 436.  In that case, we held that attorneys’ fees 
were potentially available on appeal given the relevant 
statutory language in HRS § 378  -5(c), which reads:   “[T]he 
court, in addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff  . . 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
award of attorneys’ fees on appeal if this court has not issued  
a judgment awarding damages to the plaintiff.   We disagree.  
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpreta tion is the language of the statute itself. 
Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task of 
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when 
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness 
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an ambiguity exists. And fifth, in construing an ambiguous 
statute, the meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought 
by examining the context, with which the ambiguous words , 
phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning. 
State v. Silver , 125 Hawai i 1, 4, 249 P.3d 1141, 1144 (2011)

. shall allow costs of action, including . . . reasonable 
attorney’s fees , to be paid by the defendant.” Id. 
The relevant language in HRS § 480
-13(a)(1) is similar, but 
not identical: “[I]f the judgment is for the plaintiff, the 
plaintiff shall be awarded a sum not less than $1,000 or 
threefold damages by the plaintiff sustained, whichever sum is 
the greater, and reasonable attorney’s fees together with the 
costs of suit . . . .” The only difference of note between 
these provisions is that HRS § 378-5(c) uses the term “any 
judgment,” while HRS § 480-13(a)(1) uses “the judgment.” In 
context, the two phrases convey similar meanings, but there could be some uncertainty as to whether the words have different 
meanings. Silver , 125 Hawai i at 4, 249 P.3d at 1144. Confronted 
with this ambiguity, we will “consider ‘the reason and spirit of 
the law, and the cause which induced the legislature to enact it 
. . . to discover its true meaning.’”  125 Hawai i at 4-5, 249  
P.3d at 1144-45 (citation and brackets omitted).  
The language of the fee shifting provision in HRS 
§ 480-13(a)(1) dates back to the initial passage of Hawaii’s 
antitrust laws. 1961 Haw. Sess. Laws 313. The passage of 
Hawaii’s antitrust statutes was part of the transition to 
statehood, and was intended to prevent “a void in the regulation of business practices which may cause practices destructive of competition to prevail.” H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 97, in 1961

House Journal, at  687.  Private rights of action providing for 
treble damages and fee awards are not unique to Hawaii’s 
antitrust statutes; they are also a common feature of federal 
antitrust laws:  
Where the interests of individuals or private groups or 
those who bear a special relation to the prohibition of a 
statute are identical with the public interest in having a 
statute enforce d, it is not uncommon to permit them to 
invoke sanctions. This stimulates one set of private interest to combat transgressions by another without resort 
to governmental enforcement agencies. . . . It is clear 
Congress intended to use private self -interest as a means 
of enforcement and to arm injured persons with private 
means to retribution when it gave to any injured party a 
private cause of action in which his damages are to be made 
good threefold, with costs of suit and reasonable 
attorney’s fee. 
 330 U.S. 743, 751 (1947) 
(discussing Robinson-Patman Act). 
The provisions of HRS § 480
-13 are similar to the language 
of section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15(a).4 See Davis 
v. Four Seasons Hotel, Ltd. , 122 Hawai i 423, 427-28, 228 P.3d 
303, 307-08 (2010). The private right of action provisions of 
the Clayton Act were “intended to help persons of small means 
who are injured in their property or business by combinations or 
corporations violating the antitrust laws.” Minnesota Mining  & 
4 Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) (2009), provides 
in relevant part : 
(a) Amount of recovery; prejudgment interest: Except as provided in 
subsection (b) of this section, any person who shall be injured in his 
business or property by reason of anything forbidden in t he antitrust laws 
may sue therefor . . . , and shall recover threefold the damages by him 
sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney’s fee. . . .

Mfg. Co. v. New Jersey Wood Finishing Co., 381 U.S. 311, 319 
(1965) (internal 
quotation marks omitted) (quoting legislative 
history of Clayton Antitrust Act). The attorney fee provisions 
in federal antitrust statutes are an important part of the 
private right of action. See  Farmington Dowel Prods. Co. v.  
Forster Mfg. Co.
, 421 F.2d 61, 88 (1st Cir. 1969) (rejecting 
argument that attorneys’ fees could not be awarded unless 
actually paid by plaintiff because such a holding “would leave 
p
rivate antitrust enforcement to the independently wealthy.”) . 
The fee shifting provision in HRS § 480-13(a)(1) is thus 
akin to fee shifting provisions found in federal antitrust laws. 
HRS § 480-3 (2008) specifically provides that “[t]his chapter 
shall be construed in accordance with judicial interpretations 
of similar federal antitrust statutes . . . .” We therefore 
look to federal law for guidance in interpreting HRS § 480-13, 
and turn, as we did in Nelson and in Schefke , to federal case 
law interpreting the similar federal statutes. See Nelson, 99 
Hawaii at 266, 54 P.3d at 437; Schefke, 96 Hawai i at 444-45, 32 
P.3d at 88-89. 
The language of the Clayton Act’s fee shifting provisions 
is similar to the language of Hawaii’s law. HRS § 480-13(a)(1) 
provides that the award of treble damages, costs, and fees will occur “if the judgment is for the plaintiff.” The federal 
statute omits the “if the judgment” language, and simply 
12
      
 
 
  See  Perkins v. 
 
 
 
 
    See  Perkins v. Standard 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
provides that “any person who shall be injured . . . shall 
recover” treble damages, costs and fees. 15 U.S.C. § 15(a). 
Section 4 of the Clayton Act permits the recovery of fees for 
expenses incurred on appeal; the United States Supreme Court has 
held that the language and purpose of the Clayton Act make it 
clear that appellate fees are available. 
Standard Oil Co. of Cal. , 399 U.S. 222, 223 (1970) (per curiam). 
The fee shifting provisions of the Clayton Act are present to 
ensure that the plaintiff’s treble damages recovery is not 
reduced by the fees incurred 
on appeal. 
Oil Co. of Cal. , 474 F.2d 549, 553 (9th Cir. 1973), supplemented 
by
, 487 F.2d 672 (9th Cir. 1973).  
As in 
Nelson, the question before this court is not, 
therefore, whether a judgment on appeal can serve as a basis for an award of attorneys’ fees, but whether the outcome of the 
appeal was sufficient to constitute a judgment for the 
plaintiff. In Nelson, we looked to federal case law 
interpreting federal civil rights statutes permitting 
“prevailing parties” to recover attorneys’ fees.  99 Hawai i at 
266-67, 54 P.3d at 437-38. We found that “an appellate judgment 
that affirms or directs a partial victory for plaintiff, while 
at the same time remanding the case for further proceedings, 
could serve as the basis for a fees award” provided that the 
judgment on appeal “creat[es] at least a ‘material alteration of 
13
      
 
 
     
 
 
    
 
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the legal relationship of the parties . . . . ’” 99 Hawai i at 
267, 54 P.3d at 438. 
In Nelson , fees were not awarded because the case was 
remanded for a new trial, placing plaintiff “in the same 
position as she was before trial.” Id. We held, however, that 
Nelson would be entitled to recover appellate fees if she 
eventually prevailed in the trial court.  99 
Hawaii at 269, 54  
P.3d at 440. Nelson’s fee request was therefore denied without 
prejudice, and the trial court was specifically instructed that 
it could provide for fees for work done on the appeal if Nelson 
eventually obtained “a judgment   . . . that represents a material 
alteration of the legal relationship between herself and UH.” Id.  
The circumstances in this case differ from those in Nelson
. 
In this case, we concluded that Gurrobat “presented sufficient evidence, there being no issues with respect to the first and 
third elements, to satisfy the second element required for 
recovery on Plaintiffs’ UMOC claim.” Gurrobat , 133 Hawai i at 
24, 323 P.3d at 815. 
This determination did not merely return 
Gurrobat to the position he was in when the case was filed, as 
in Nelson. In holding that Gurrobat had satisfied the remaining 
element required for recovery on the UMOC claim, this court materially altered the legal relationship of the parties, as the

only task remaining for the circuit court on remand is the 
determination of the amount of damages. Gurrobat is therefore 
entitled to attorneys’ fees for time expended on his cross-
appeal of the circuit court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants on Gurrobat’s UMOC claim. 
B. Challenged Hours 
Having determined that Gurrobat may recover fees for work 
done on both the appeal and cross-appeal, we now turn to what 
constitutes reasonable attorneys’ fees in this case. 
Gurrobat has submitted itemized timesheets detailing the 
hours that his three attorneys (John Perkin, James Bickerton, 
and Brandee Faria) expended on the appeal in this case. 
Defendants have objected to most of the individual time 
entries in the documentation submitted by Gurrobat.  Defendants 
grouped their objections into three categories: objections to 
time spent on the cross-appeal, which we have already addressed; 
objections to ent ries they view as “block billed”; and 
objections to entries they view as “vaguely generic.” We 
therefore turn now to Defendants’ block billing and v agueness 
objections. 
1. Alleged Block Billing 
Block billing has been defined as “the time -keeping method 
by which each lawyer and legal assistant enters the total daily time spent working on a case, rather than itemizing the time 
15
      
 
 
  Block billing is a disfavored method of documenting time 
spent for the purposes of supporting a motion for attorneys’ 
fees. See, e.g., Hawai i Ventures , 116 Hawai i at 475, 173 P.3d  
at 1132. Parties seeking attorneys’ fees bear the burden of 
demonstrating that the fees requested are reasonable. See Sharp  
v. Hui Wahine, 
49 Hawai i 241, 246, 413 P.2d 242, 247 (1966).    As 
we have noted, the issue with block billing is that it “can make 
it impossible for the court to determine the reasonableness of 
the hours spent on each task.”  Hawaii Ventures , 116 Hawai i  at 
475, 173 P.3d at 1132.  Block billing is problematic because it 
makes it more difficult for the party requesting fees to 
demonstrate the reasonableness of the billed hours; a party 
requesting attorneys’ fees block bills at its own risk. See, 
e.g., Welch v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.  , 480 F.3d 942, 948  (9th Cir. 
2007) (approving of a 20% reduction applied to specific block  
billed entries).  
   
   
  
 
   

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
expended on specific tasks.” Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, 
Inc., 116 Hawai i 465, 475, 173 P.3d 1122, 1132 (2007) (quoting 
Robinson v. City of Edmond, 160 F.3d 1275, 1284 n.9 (10th Cir. 
1998)). 
Block billing may also be defined as the practice of 
lumping multiple tasks into a single time entry.  Id. 
Defendants request that we deny 
recovery of fees for all 
block billed time, asserting that “it is basically accepted as a 
16
      
 
 
     
  
  
  
 
  

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
matter of law that ‘block billing’ is totally unacceptable and a 
rejected means of seeking an award of fees, no matter the 
context for the request.”  (Opposition at 14). In support of 
this assertion, Defendants cite to a number of cases, the most recent from 1999,  from a range of jurisdictions.  Id.   
Defendants’ reliance on these cases is , however,  misplaced.  
Neither current Hawai i law nor the recent practice of 
American courts suggest that block billing is categorically unacceptable, or that block billing should normally result in 
denial of the block billed entries. If anything, it appears 
generally accepted that block billing should not automatically 
lead to the rejection of block billed entries. See, e.g., 
Mendez v. Cnty. of San Bernardino  , 540 F.3d 1109, 1129 (
 9th Cir. 
2008) (“[T]he use of block billing does not justify an across
­
the-board reduction or rejection of all hours.”) (emphasis in 
original), overruled on other grounds by  Arizona v. ASARCO LLC , 
773 F.3d 1050, 1058 n.1 (9th Cir. 2014); Thompson, Inc. v. Ins.  
Co. of N.Am.
, 11 N.E.3d 982, 1025 (Ind. Ct. App. 2014) (Indiana 
cases expressly permit block billing); Maddox v. Greene Cnty. 
Children Servs. Bd. of Dirs., 12 N.E.3d 476, 498 (Ohio Ct. App. 
2014) (holding that the trial court was not required to deny 
fees altogether for block billed entries); 546-552 W. 146th  St.  
LLC v. Arfa, 99 A.D.3d 117, 123 (N.Y. App. Div. 2012) (holding 
17
      
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
  
 
     

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that block billing does not render a fee request per se 
unreasonable). 
Block billing may lead to the exclusion of the block billed 
hours where the practice makes it impossible to distinguish 
between compensable and non-compensable tasks.  See Hawai i 
Ventures
, 116 Hawai i at 476, 173 P.3d at 1132.  Where this is 
not the case, courts may still reduce the portion of the fee 
request that was block billed by a percentage to account for the 
increased difficulty in determining the reasonableness of hours 
billed in this format. See, e.g.,  
Welch, 480 F.3d at 948 
(holding that courts may apply a percentage reduction, but only to hours actually block billed). 
With the foregoing in mind, we turn to Defendants’ specific 
block billing objections. Defendants present a list of 103 separate time entries that they object to on the grounds that 
the entries are “block billed.” In 79 of these 103 entries , 
Gurrobat’s counsel billed less than one hour; in 56 of the 
objected-to entries, counsel billed 0.1 hour. 
One-tenth of one hour (0.1 hour) is the shortest generally 
accepted unit of attorney time for billing purposes. It is 
possible to block bill even such a short period of time, in that 
an attorney can accomplish and bill multiple compensable tasks 
within one six minute block. As long as the billed tasks are 
18
      
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
                     
 5  We  note  that  when  counsel  actually recorded a task as “work on    
answering brief,” Defe ndants  objected  to  the entry as  being too vague to  
support a claim for fees. See  Opposition at 18.   

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
compensable, the six minute block may represent a reasonable 
expenditure of time. 
In addition, block billing can only occur where multiple 
tasks are lumped together into a single billing entry. In order 
to determine if multiple tasks are actually being claimed in a 
single block, a certain degree of common-sense is required; the 
mere inclusion of the word “and” in a billing entry is certainly 
not determinative. For example, “reviewing and drafting” a 
document, “reviewing and revising” a document, “drafting and finalizing” a document, and other such descriptions all involve 
the single task of “working on” a document.
5 See, e.g., Wise v. 
Kelly, 620 F.Supp. 2d 435, 451 (S.D.N.Y. 2008).  Similarly, tasks such as drafting a document and making a follow-up 
telephone call related to the same document can be viewed as 
part of the single task of working on the document.  See id.  
  
Billing descriptions that merely detail the types of activities that make up a single general task will not normally su
pport a 
block billing objection, provided the court can determine the 
reasonableness of the hours expended on the general task. 
Upon examination, none of the allegedly block billed 
entries includes more than one general task
, and all of the 
19
      
 
 
   
  
    
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
 
    

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
billing entries are reasonable. Defendants’ block billing 
objections are therefore rejected. 
2. Alleged Vagueness 
Defendants object to numerous time entries on the grounds 
that the entries are “vaguely generic.” The majority of 
these 
objections appear to cover time entries where it is not clear to 
Defendants whether the task detailed related to the appeal or 
cross-appeal. Fees cannot be awarded if it is impossible to 
distinguish between compensable and non-compensable claims.  See  
Hawai
i Ventures , 116 Hawai i at 478, 173 P.3d at 1135. Here, 
because we have held that fees are available for both Defendants’ appeal an d Gurrobat’s cross-appeal, this issue does 
not arise. 
Defendants also state that “some of the time entries are so 
vaguely generic, that it is impossible to discern whether the 
hours expended for the task were reasonable . . . .” Defendants 
identify only two specific time entries as falling into this group within the brief: one time entry for 3.6 hours for 
“[p]repare Answering Brief” and one from the same attorney for 
0.4 
hours for “[w]ork on answering brief.” (Opposition at 18). 
It is true that these two time descriptions lack the specificity 
seen in many of the entries that appear on Defendants’ list of 
block billing objections.  Nevertheless, the total time spent on 
the answering brief appears reasonable.    
20

      
 
 
   
  
 
    
   
   
 
   
  
 
  
  
 
 
                     
           
      
  
  

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Although such time entries are not excessively descriptive, 
they are not so vague as to warrant rejection. Defendants’ 
vagueness objections are therefore rejected. 
3. Excluded Tasks 
We now turn to Gurrobat’s itemized fee request. For the 
most part, the listed items are adequately described and clearly 
relate to appellate work. Some of the time entries, however, 
relate to tasks that are not appropriately considered part of 
the appeal. 
In particular, Gurrobat includes time spent on work done at 
the trial court in order to address issues related to the final 
judgment. The time entries in question refer to work done at 
the trial court on a Hawai i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 60 
motion, and on an Amended Final Judgment.6 As the trial court is 
better able to determine the reasonableness of time expended on 
this issue, and as we have remanded the case to the trial court 
for further proceedings, we deny the portions of the fee request 
attributable to the revised judgment without prejudice to 
Gurrobat requesting these fees at the trial court on remand. 
6 In total, Gurrobat document s 19.2 hours of work by attorney 
Faria, 2.5 hours by attorney Perkin, and 0.7 hours by attorney Bickerton that 
are attributable to matters related to procuring the trial court’s final 
judgment.

C. Lodestar Hours and Rates 
Courts determine a reasonable attorneys’ fee using the 
lodestar method, in which the number of hours reasonably 
expended are multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. See 
Kaleikini v. Yoshioka
, 129 Hawai i 454, 469, 304 P.3d 252, 267  
24

      
 
 
   Hensley v. Eckerhart
 
 Gurrobat  submitted requests for 150.2 hours of work by  
attorney Brandee Faria, 25.4 hours by attorney John Perkin, and 
85.3 hours by attorney James Bickerton.  After considering 
Defendants’    specific  objections and excluding time attributable 
to work done at the trial court level,  as noted above,  we find 
that the lodestar should be calculated based on 131.0 hours of  
work by attorney Faria  (150.2 hours requested less 19.2 hours  
disallowed for trial court work), 22.9 hours by  attorney Perkin  
(25.4 hours requested less 2.5 hours disallowed for trial court  
work), and 84.6 hours by attorney Bickerton (85.3 hours 
requested less 0.7 hours disallowed for trial court work).   
 Gurrobat  requests that we set the fee at the  2011 billing 
rates of $425 per hour for Mr. Perkin, $375 per hour for Mr. Bickerton, and $325 per hour for Ms. Faria.   Gurrobat states   
that he is sett  ing these rates at 2011 levels in part to “take 
advantage of the (unappealed) law of the case establishing those 
rates as reasonable.”  Gurrobat ’s reliance on  “law of the case ”   
is misplaced.  The “law of the case” doctrine provides that 
“[u]nless cogent reasons support the second court’s action, any 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(2013). This method is generally considered to be “[t]he most 
useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable 
fee . . . .” , 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983).  
The lodestar approach is strongly presumed to yield a reasonable fee. 
See City of Burlington v. Dague , 505 U.S. 557, 562 (1992).

modification of a prior ruling of another court of equal and 
concurrent jurisdiction will be deemed an abuse of discretion.” 
Wong v. City and Cnty. of Honolulu  , 66 Haw. 389, 396, 
665 P.2d 157, 162 (1983) (  emphasis added) (citations omitted).  
Thus, with respect to the reasonableness of appellate fees, the 
doctrine is not triggered by a trial court determination.  
In any event, Gurrobat’s requested rates are adequately 
supported by documentation demonstrating that the rates fall within current market rates.  Defendants do not challenge the 
requested hourly rate.  This court therefore approves Gurrobat’s 
requested rates. 
Applying these rates to the hours we determine were 
reasonably expended, we arrive at a final lodestar of 
$84,032.50.
8 
D. Lodestar Modification 
Both Gurrobat and Defendants request that this court adjust 
the lodestar award. Gurrobat requests an upward modification. 
Defendants assert that an upward modification is inappropriate, 
and that the lodestar should be adjusted downward. 
Our analysis begins, as it must, with the “‘strong 
presumption’ that the lodestar represents the reasonable fee.” 
131.0 hours at $325 per hour for Ms. Faria = $42,575.00 ; 84.6 
hours at $375 per hour for Mr. Bickerton = $31,725.00; 22.9 hours at $425 per 
hour for Mr. Perkin = $9,732.50.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Kaleikini, 129 Hawai i at 475, 304 P.3d at 273 (2013) (citations 
omitted). Where attorney s’ fees are requested under fee 
shifting statutes that provide for the recovery of reasonable 
attorneys’ fees, as is the case here, the party requesting a 
lodestar adjustment must 
show that the unmodified lodestar would 
lead to an unreasonable fee. See id.  
T
his court’s decision in Schefke
 makes it clear that upward 
modification of the lodestar may be warranted in fee shifting 
cases. Gurrobat argues that consideration of each of the twelve 
lodestar adjustment factors first set forth in the Fifth 
Circuit’s opinion in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 
488 F.2d 714 (5th  Cir. 1974),  overruled on other grounds by  
Blanchard v. Bergeron, 489 U.S. 87, 91-94 (1989), and 
subsequently adopted by the Ninth Circuit in Kerr v. Screen 
Extras Guild, Inc. , 526 F.2d 67, 70 (9th Cir. 1975), abrogated 
in part by Davis  v. City & Cnty. Of San Francisco,  976 F.2d 
1536, 1546 n.4 (9th Cir. 1992),  vacated on other grounds on 
denial of reh’g by  984 F.2d 345 (9th Cir. 1993) , demonstrates 
that an upward adjustment should be awarded in this case. It is 
clear that Gurrobat ’s counsel obtained favorable results; 
counsels’ acceptance of this case on a contingent fee basis 
played a vital role in the vindication of the rights of the 
class, and litigating this issue served a public purpose. See 
Nelson, 99 Hawai i at 266, 54 p.3d at 437 
(noting that civil

rights fee shifting statutes serve a public purpose); Schefke, 
96 Hawai i at 452-454, 32 P.3d at 96-98 (holding that Hawai i 
courts have discretion to enhance lodestar when attorneys have 
accepted a case on a contingent fee basis). Nevertheless, we 
decline a fee enhancement in this case. 
Upward modification of the lodestar is warranted when 
necessary to “ achieve a ‘reasonable’ award of fees.” Schefke, 
96 Hawai
i at 452, 32 P.3d at 96 (emphasis added). As we start 
with the presumption that application of the lodestar is 
sufficient to determine a reasonable fee,  see  Kaleikini
, 129 
Hawaii at 475, 304 P.3d at 273, it is necessary to enhance the 
lodestar only if it does not result in a reasonable fee. 
Here, Gurrobat argues that a lodestar enhancement could 
result in a reasonable fee, but does not argue that the lodestar 
alone does not result in a reasonable fee. It is insufficient 
for Gurrobat to demonstrate that the fee will remain within the range of the reasonable fees after application of a multiplier; 
he must also show that the lodestar does not provide for a 
reasonable fee.  See id. (rejecting enhancement when party 
seeking fees failed to “establish that the lodestar is 
unreasonable, or that enhancement is necessary to achieve  a 
reasonable fee”).  
28
      
 
 
   
 
 
    
  
 
 
 
 
 
 By the same token, Defendants’ arguments for a downward  
modification are similarly unavailing.  We have already 
discussed Defendants’ specific challenges to the claimed hours, 
and Defendants do not argue that the proposed  hourly rates are 
unreasonable.  Defendants also object to the unaltered lodestar, 
however, on the grounds that Gurrobat did not obtain an  
unqualified victory.  Although Gurrobat did not complete  ly  
prevail on appeal, he did prevail on all but one of the issues  
raised in the appeal and cross-appeal.  This court’s remand  on  
 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Gurrobat’s only explicit effort to rebut the presumption 
that the lodestar was reasonable is an argument in his Reply 
that the election to seek compensation at below market rates 
demonstrates that the lodestar was unreasonable. Gurrobat’s 
counsel, however, suggested their rates and stated that the rates are “well within the range of what is reasonable and 
appropriate in th is market.” (Faria Decl. at ¶ 10). Even if we 
treat the statement contained within the Reply as a 
clarification of Gurrobat’s initial argument rather than a new 
argument raised for the first time in the Reply, see Taomae v. 
Lingle, 110 Hawai i 327, 333 n.14, 132 P.3d 1238, 1244 n.14 
(2006) (declining to consider matters raised for the first time in the reply memorandum when considering whether to award 
attorneys’ fees) , Gurrobat has not successfully rebutted the 
presumption that the requested rates are reasonable.

fact that Gurrobat prevailed, and his attorneys should recover a 
fully sufficient compensatory fee. Schefke, 96 Hawai i at 444, 
32 P.3d at 88. 
Defendants also argue that the lodestar should be reduced 
because the central issue in Defendants’ appeal was effectively 
decided by this court’s intervening decision in Villon, 130 
Hawaii 130, 306 P.3d 175. As Gurrobat notes, however, Villon 
was not published until very late in the course of this appeal.9 
The reasonableness of attorneys’ fees is measured based on the point in time when the work was performed, and not based on 
hindsight. See  Woolridge v. Marlene Indus
 .  Corp., 898 F.2d 
1169, 1177 (6th Cir. 1990). 
As neither Gurrobat nor Defendants have rebutted the 
presumption that the lodestar results in a reasonabl
e fee, we 
will not apply either an upward or downward modification to the lodestar in this case. Gurrobat is therefore awarded attorneys’ 
fees in the lodestar amount of $84,032.50, plus an additional $3,959.61 (4.712% of the total) for general excise tax. See 
Cnty. of Hawai i v. C & J Coupe Family Ltd. P ’ship, 120 Hawai i 
400, 409-10, 208 P.3d 713, 722-23 (2009) (“[I]t is common

week before we issued our order setting the case for oral argument.

practice in this jurisdiction to include an excise tax in the 
amount of the fee award.”) . 
E. Costs 
10Gurrobat  seeks costs in the sum of $535.55.  Defendants 
have objected to all but $18.85 of this request. Most of 
Defendants’ objection s stem from their argument that costs and 
fees are not available for Gurrobat ’s cross-appeal. Based on 
our previous analysis, Gurrobat is entitled to these costs. 
Some of the requested costs, however, pertain to obtaining 
an amended final judgment from the trial court. As noted 
earlier, costs and fees for work done at the trial court are 
best addressed there. We therefore deny Gurrobat’s request for 
the cost of copies of the Rule 60 motion ($94.20) and his 
request for “Copies Opp To Proposed Final Judgment Opp” [sic] 
($5.80) without prejudice. 
Gurrobat is therefore awarded costs in the amount of 
$435.55. 
F. Apportionment of Fees and Costs 
In our earlier opinion in this case, we reversed the 
portion of the circuit court’s judgment that held defendants 
jointly and severally liable for damages, and remanded the case 
for apportionment of damages. Gurrobat , 133 Hawai i at 18-19, 
10 Gurrobat initially requested $555.45, but withdrew two entries in 
his Reply.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
323 P.3d at 809-10. Neither party addressed the question of 
apportionment of attorneys’ fees in their briefing. Therefore, 
it appears Defendants concede joint and several liability. 
We note in any event that Defendants elected to present a 
joint defense throughout the proceedings, and that there is 
nothing in the record that would provide a court with any basis 
for apportioning liability for fees and costs. The question of 
whether defendants may be held jointly and severally liable for 
attorneys’ fees in a case where defendants are not jointly and 
severally liable for damages is one of first impression in this 
jurisdiction. Other jurisdictions, however, have had cause to 
examine this issue, and have held that the circumstances of a 
case may render attorneys’ fees indivisible, and that joint and 
several liability for fees can be appropriate in such cases even 
in the absence of joint and several liability for damages. See, 
e.g.
, Molnar v. Booth , 229 F.3d 593, 605 (7th Cir. 2000) (joint 
and several award of fees appropriate in case where the issues against the two defendants “were the same or similar.”); Walker 
v. 
U.S. Dep’t of Housing & Urban Dev., 99 F.3d 761, 773 (5th 
Cir. 1996) (joint and several fee award appropriate where 
defendants presented joint defense and shared experts); CR-RSC 
Tower I, LLC, v. RSC Tower I, LLC
, 56 A.3d 170, 218 (Md. 2012) 
(imposing joint and several liability for fees and costs when

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
claims centered on common issues and attributable to all 
defendants). 
In this case, 
Defendants proceeded jointly throughout the 
entirety of the proceedings.  Defendants were represented by the 
same counsel, and submitted a single set of briefs.  Although 
liability for the damage award can and will be divided between 
the Defendants on remand, the work that Gurrobat’s counsel put 
in to the case cannot readily be divided.  See  Jones v. 
Southpeak Interactive Corp. of Delaware, -- F.3d --, 2015 WL 
309626, at *16 (4th Cir. Jan. 26, 2015). 
We therefore hold 
Defendants jointly and severally liable for the payment of 
appellate fees and costs. We emphasize, however, that this has 
no bearing on our prior determination that Defendants are not 
jointly and severally liable for the damage award itself. 
IV. Interest 
Gurrobat requests that this court award interest on the 
portions of the circuit court judgment that were affirmed. 
Gurrobat bases this request on the post judgment interest 
provisions of HRS § 478-3 (2000), which provides for 10% per 
annum interest on judgments, and on HRAP Rule 37, which 
provides: 
Unless otherwise provided by law, if a judgment for money 
in a civil case is affirmed, whatever interest is allowed 
by law shall be payable from the date the judgment was 
entered in the circuit or district court. If the judgment 
is modified or vacated with a direction that a judgment for 
money be entered in the circuit or district court, the 
33
      
 
 
  
 
  
 While remand will still result in a judgment awarding money  
damages to Gurrobat, the judgment will likely not be in the 
amount initially awarded.  Under the circumstances,  therefore,  
an award of post  judgment interest under HRS § 478-3 is not 
appropriate. 
  
 We hold that Gurrobat is  entitled to attorneys’ fees for 
both his appeal and cross  -appeal, in the amount of $84,032.50  
plus $3,959.61  in general excise tax.  We award costs in the 
amount of $435.55.  We hold Defendants jointly and severally 
liable for payment of both attorneys’ fees and costs. We deny, 
however, that portion of Gurrobat’s   request that relates to work 
done to obtain an amended final judgment from the trial court 
without prejudice to Gurrobat  seeking such costs and fees in the 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
notice  an d judgment  on  appeal  shall  contain  instructions  
with respect to allowance of interest.  
 
In this case, we did not remand the case with an explicit 
direction regarding an amount of money to be entered on appeal. 
Instead, we remanded for further proceedings consistent with 
this court’s holdings that: (1) the imposition of joint and 
several liability on Defendants was inappropriate; and (2) that 
Gurrobat presented sufficient evidence to satisfy the 
requirements to recover treble damages under HRS § 480-13.
