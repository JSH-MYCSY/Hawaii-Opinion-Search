OPINION OF THE COURT BY ACOBA, J.
 
We hold that Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellee/Cross-
Appellant Lloyd Y. Asato (Asato) had standing to bring a claim 
challenging the validity of Hawai
'i Administrative Rule (HAR) §         
     
          
        
          
         
         
          
        
          
         
      
       
        
 
 
          ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
3-122-66 (2008), based on his status as an “interested person”
 
1
pursuant to Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91-7 (1993) , and in
order to satisfy the “needs of justice.” See Life of the Land v. 
Land Use Comm’n., 63 Haw. 166, 176, 623 P.2d 431, 441 (1981). We 
2
also decide that HAR § 3-122-66 (2003)  is invalid because it
exceeds the scope of authority given by the legislature to 
Respondent/Defendant-Appellee/Cross-Appellee State of Hawai' i 
Procurement Policy Board (the Board). See HRS § 91-7(b) (“The 
court shall declare the rule invalid if it finds that it . . . exceeds the statutory authority of the agency[.]”). Finally, the court did not err in declining to invalidate all contracts issued under HAR § 3-122-66, as requested by Asato. 
I.
 A.
 
On January 25, 2011, Asato filed a Complaint asserting
 
1 HRS § 91-7 provides as follows:
 
§ 91-7. Declaratory judgment on validity of rules. (a) Any
interested person may obtain a judicial declaration as to
the validity of an agency rule as provided in subsection (b)
herein by bringing an action against the agency in the
circuit court of the county in which petitioner resides or
has its principal place of business. The action may be
maintained whether or not petitioner has first requested the
agency to pass upon the validity of the rule in question.
(b) The court shall declare the rules invalid if it
finds that it violates constitutional or statutory
provisions, or exceeds the statutory authority of the
agency, or was adopted without compliance with the statutory
rulemaking procedures.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
two causes of action, one for declaratory relief (declaratory
 
action) and one for injunctive relief (injunctive action). In
 his Complaint, Asato maintained that he brought the Complaint
 pursuant to HRS § 91-7 and that he “also had the necessary
 standing to prosecute this action under Federal Electric Corp. v.
 Fasi [(Federal Electric)], 56 Haw. 57, 62, 527 P.2d 1284, 1289
 (1974) and Iuli v. Fasi [(Iuli)], 62 Haw. 180, 186, 613 P.2d 653,
 657 (1980)” as a taxpayer.

The Complaint asserted that HAR § 3-122-66  “is and has
always been contrary to the ‘minimum of three persons’
 
3 HAR § 3-122-66 provides in relevant part as follows:
 
§ 3-122-66 Waiver to Requirement for Procurement of Professional
 
Services.
 
(a) If the names of less than three qualified persons are
submitted pursuant to section 103D-304(g), HRS, the head of
the purchasing agency may determine that :
(1) Negotiations under section 103D-304(h), HRS, may be
conducted provided that :
(A) The prices submitted are fair and reasonable ; and
(B) Other prospective offerors had reasonable opportunity to
respond; or there is not adequate time to resolicit through
public notice statements of qualifications and expressions
of interest ;
(2) The offers may be rejected pursuant to subchapter 11 and
new statements of qualifications and expressions of interest
may be solicited if the conditions in paragraph (1) (A) and
(B) are not met;
(3) The proposed procurement may be cancelled; or
(4) An alternative procurement method may be conducted to
include but not be limited to direct negotiations with other
potential offerors if the head of the purchasing agency
determines in writing that the need for the service
continues, but that either the price of the offers received
are not fair and reasonable or that the qualifications of
the offerors are not adequate to meet the procurement needs,
and there is no time for resolicitation, or resolicitation
would likely be futile.

requirement [in] HRS § 103D-304(g)  and is therefore invalid, and
4
 HRS § 103D-304 (Supp. 2010) provides in relevant part as follows:
 
§ 103D-304 Procurement of professional services
 (a) Professional services shall be procured in accordance
with sections 103D-302, 103D-303, 103D-305, 103D-306, or
103D-307, or this section ; provided that design professional
services furnished by licensees under chapter 464 shall be
procured pursuant to this section or section 103D-307 .
Contracts for professional services shall be awarded on the
basis of demonstrated competence and qualification for the
type of services required, and at fair and reasonable
prices.
 
(b) At a minimum, before the beginning of each fiscal year,
the head of each purchasing agency shall publish a notice
inviting persons engaged in providing professional services
which the agency anticipates needing in the next fiscal
year, to submit current statements of qualifications and
expressions of interest to the agency. . . .
 
(c) The head of the purchasing agency shall designate a
review committee consisting of a minimum of three persons
with sufficient education, training, and licenses or
credentials for each type of professional service which may
be required. . . .
The committee shall review and evaluate all submissions and
 other pertinent information, including references and
reports, and prepare a list of qualified persons to provide
these services. . . .
 
(d) Whenever during the course of the fiscal year the agency
needs a particular professional service, the head of the
purchasing agency shall designate a selection committee to
evaluate the statements of qualification and performance
data of those persons on the list prepared pursuant to
subsection (c) along with any other pertinent information,
including references and reports. The selection committee
shall be comprised of a minimum of three persons with
sufficient education, training, and licenses or credentials
in the area of the services required. . . .
(e) The selection criteria employed in descending order of
importance shall be:
(1) Experience and professional qualifications relevant to
the project type;
(2) Past performance on projects of similar scope for public
agencies or private industry, including corrective actions
and other responses to notices of deficiencies;
(3) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time;
and
 (4) Any additional criteria determined in writing by the
selection committee to be relevant to the purchasing
agency's needs or necessary and appropriate to ensure full,
(continued...)

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
must be declared void ab initio and permanently enjoined from all
 
further use.” Further, the Complaint alleged that “[a]ccording
 to internet listings of contract awards on the State Procurement
 Office website[,] . . . the previous City and County of Honolulu
 Administration has awarded at least twenty six (26) professional
 service contracts for architects and engineers or for other
 professionals with less than three (3) persons on the list
 submitted to the selection committee” and that “[a]ll contracts
 
4(...continued)
open, and fair competition for professional services
contracts.
 
(f) The selection committee shall evaluate the submissions
of persons on the list prepared pursuant to subsection (c)
and any other pertinent information which may be available
to the agency, against the selection criteria. . . .
 
(g) The selection committee shall rank a minimum of three
persons based on the selection criteria and send the ranking
to the head of the purchasing agency. . . .
 (h) The head of the purchasing agency or designee shall
negotiate a contract with the first ranked person, including
a rate of compensation which is fair and reasonable,
established in writing, and based upon the estimated value,
scope, complexity, and nature of the services to be
rendered. If a satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated
with the first ranked person, negotiations with that person
shall be formally terminated and negotiations with the
second ranked person on the list shall commence. The
contract file shall include documentation from the head of
 the purchasing agency, or designee, to support selection of
other than the first ranked or next ranked person. Failing
accord with the second ranked person, negotiations with the
next ranked person on the list shall commence. If a contract
at a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the
selection committee may be asked to submit a minimum of
three additional persons for the head of the purchasing
agency to resume negotiations in the same manner provided in
this subsection. Negotiations shall be conducted
confidentially.

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
that have been issued based on HAR § 3-122-66 are void ab
 
initio.” Therefore, Asato’s declaratory action requested that
 “the court declare as a matter of law that HAR § 3-122-66 has
 never been valid and has always been ultra vires because it is
 contrary to and violates the “minimum of three persons
 requirement in HRS § 103D-304(g)[.]”
 
Correlatively, Asato’s injunctive action requested that
 
“all existing contracts in which HAR § 3-122-66 was used in
 violation of the ‘minimum of three persons’ requirement in HRS §
 103D-304(g) be rescinded as being void ab initio.” Asato also
 asked that “a preliminary injunction, and after hearing, a
 permanent injunction be entered enjoining and restraining [the
 Board] and all its agents, servants, and employees, and all
 others acting in concert with them, including but not limited to
 the administrator of the State Procurement Office, and all of his
 agents, servants[,] and employees, and all chief procurement
 officers and their agents, servants and employees in the state
 and county governments from utilizing HAR § 3-122-66 in the
 
procurement of professional services under HRS § 103D-304.”
 
On January 10, 2012, Asato filed a motion for summary
 
judgment. Asato again contended that “HAR § 3-122-66 conflicts
 
with HRS § 103D-304(g) and should be struck down[.]” Again,
 Asato asked the court to “declare that HAR § 3-122-66 has never
 been valid and has always been ultra vires and is void ab initio,
 
6
         
          
      
       
     
   
         
        
       
   
        
       
      
  
        
       
       
     
       
    
         
   
     
   
         
      
        
        
        
         
          
          
      
       
   
      
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
enjoin its current and future use and declare that every
 
government contract issued under the invalid authority of HAR §
 3-122-66 is void ab initio.”
 
On March 30, 2012, the Board filed a cross-motion for
 
summary judgment. The Board argued that HAR § 3-122-66 was
 
5
authorized by HRS § 103D-102(b)(4)(L),  and therefore “HAR § 3­
5 HRS § 103D-102 (Supp. 2010) provides in relevant part as follows
 
§ 103D-102 Application of this chapter
 (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), this chapter shall not
apply to contracts by governmental bodies:
 
. . .
 (4) To procure the following goods or services which are
available from multiple sources but for which procurement by
competitive means is either not practicable or not
advantageous to the State :
(A) Services of expert witnesses for potential and actual
litigation of legal matters involving the State, its
agencies, and its officers and employees, including
administrative quasi-judicial proceedings;
(B) Works of art for museum or public display;
(C) Research and reference materials including books, maps,
periodicals, and pamphlets, which are published in print,
video, audio, magnetic, or electronic form;
(D) Meats and foodstuffs for the Kalaupapa settlement;
(E) Opponents for athletic contests;
(F) Utility services whose rates or prices are fixed by
regulatory processes or agencies;
(G) Performances, including entertainment, speeches, and
cultural and artistic presentations;
(H) Goods and services for commercial resale by the State;
(I) Services of printers, rating agencies, support
facilities, fiscal and paying agents, and registrars for the
issuance and sale of the State's or counties’ bonds;
(J) Services of attorneys employed or retained to advise,
represent, or provide any other legal service to the State
or any of its agencies, on matters arising under laws of
another state or foreign country, or in an action brought in
another state, federal, or foreign jurisdiction, when
substantially all legal services are expected to be
performed outside this State;
(K) Financing agreements under chapter 37D; and
(L) Any other goods or services which the policy board

     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
122-66 is a valid rule.” According to the Board, Asato did not
 
have standing as a taxpayer because he did not demonstrate that
 he had suffered a pecuniary loss from the enactment of HAR § 3­122-66, and Asato did not have standing under HRS § 91-7 because
 “HRS § 91-7 limits relief to claims from ‘interested persons’ who
 can show an actual or threatened injury.” (Citing Richard v.
 Metcalf, 82 Haw. 249, 253, 921 P.2d 169, 173 (1996).) Finally,
 the Board maintained that Asato could not challenge specific
 contracts awarded under HAR § 3-122-66 because “[c]hallenges to
 the award of procurement contracts are governed exclusively by
 the Procurement Code.” (Citing HRS § 103D-704.)
 
B.
 
On June 8, 2012, the circuit court of the first circuit
 
6
(the court)  issued an order granting Asato’s motion for summary
judgment. As to Asato’s standing, the court concluded that Asato
 was an “interested person” under HRS § 91-7 because he “seeks to
 obtain a judicial declaration,” and “has brought an action
 against the agency in circuit court and is asking us to determine
 whether or not this rule is valid or invalid as it violates
 
5(...continued)
determines by rules or the chief procurement officer
determines in writing is available from multiple sources but
for which procurement by competitive means is either not
practicable or not advantageous to the State[.]

 The Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto presided.
 
8
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
statutory provisions or exceeds statutory authority.” The court 
also held that the “three-part test of injury in fact” set forth in Bush v. Watson, 81 Hawai' i 474, 918 P.3d 1130 (1996) “would 
have been met here.” 
The court explained that the first prong of the test
 
was met because Asato demonstrated that the Board used HAR § 3­122-66 to “exempt certain procurements from requirements of HRS §
 103D-304, where [Asato] assert[ed] that the administrative rule
 is inconsistent with the statute.” The second prong was met
 “because the actual or threatened injury to [Asato], as a
 taxpayer, is directly traceable to [the Board’s] actions,
 especially in concerning integrity of contracts using taxpayer
 funds.” Finally, the third prong was met because “a favorable
 decision would require [the board] to follow the statutory
 mandates of HRS § 103D-304, and would result or render [sic] HAR
 § 3-122-66 invalid, which is the direct object of [Asato’s]
 lawsuit.” 
As to the validity of HAR § 3-122-66, the court
 
explained that “[HRS §] 103D-102(b)(4) lists 11 very specific
 goods and services exempted from the ambit of 103D,” and
 therefore “subsection (L) . . . must be read by its plain and
 obvious meaning -- which is that the policy board must determine
 by rule, or [the] chief procurement officer must determine in
 writing, specific classes of goods or services which are
 
9
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
available from multiple services, but for which procurement by
 
competitive means is either not practicable nor advantageous to
 the State[;]” but “HAR § 3-122-66 does not do any such thing.” 
Moreover, the court concluded that HAR § 3-122-66 could not be
 justified by the need to “fill a gap left in HRS § 103D-304,”
 because “[t]he plain language of section 304 does not leave any
 such gaps[.]” Therefore, the court held that “that HAR §
 3-122-66 is invalid[.]”
 
However, the court “declin[ed] to declare any contracts
 
exempted under HAR § 3-122-66 void prior to the date that its
 order is filed,” because “the plain reading of standing in HRS §
 91-7 is that the court shall declare the rule invalid and that is
 all the court does.”
 
Finally, the court ruled on Asato’s request for
 
attorney’s fees pursuant to the private attorney general
 doctrine. It held that all three factors of the private attorney
 general doctrine, set forth infra, were met, and awarded Asato
 reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. 
C.
 
On August 15, 2012, the court entered a judgment in
 
favor of Asato and against the Board. Then, on September 4,
 2012, the court issued its order awarding attorney’s fees and
 costs. 
10
         
     
          
          
        
        
    
         
 
         
       
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
D.
 
Both Asato and the Board appealed the court’s August 15,
 
2012 judgment. The Board also appealed the court’s September 4,
 
2012 order awarding attorney’s fees and costs. On June 27, 2013,
 Asato filed an application for transfer of the appeal from the
 Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) to this court. This court
 granted a discretionary transfer on August 1, 2013, pursuant to
 HRS § 602-58(b) (Supp. 2012) .
7 The parties had already filed 
briefs with the ICA. 
II. 
A. 
In its Opening Brief, the Board argued, inter alia,
 
that (1) Asato did not have standing as a taxpayer because he
 failed to meet any of the three requirements for taxpayer
 standing set forth in Iuli, (2) the court erred in concluding
 that Asato had standing under HRS § 91-7 because Asato did not
 suffer injury in fact, and (3) that the court erred in concluding 
that HAR § 3-122-66 was invalid, because the Board was authorized
 
7
 HRS § 602-58(b) provides as follows:
 
(b) the supreme court, in a manner and within the time
provided by the rules of the court, may grant an application
to transfer any case within the jurisdiction fo the
intermediate appellate court to the supreme court upon the
grounds that the case involves:
(1) A question of first impression or a novel legal
question; or
(2) Issues upon which there is an inconsistency in the
decisions of the intermediate appellate court or of
the supreme court.
 
11
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to adopt HAR § 3-122-66 under HRS § 103D-102(b)(4)(L). 
B.
 
1.
 
Asato filed a cross-appeal, arguing inter alia that the
 
court erred in refusing to grant his requested relief of (1)
 “declar[ing] as a matter of law that HAR § 3-122-66 has never
 
8
been valid and has always been void ab initio[,]”  (2)
“declar[ing] that every government contract issued under the
 invalid authority of HAR § 3-122-66 is void ab initio,” and (3)
 “preliminarily and permanently enjoin[ing] and restrain[ing] the
 [Board] . . . from using HAR § 3-122-66.” 
2. 
In its Answering Brief on cross-appeal, the Board asserted
 
that “[a] declaration of invalidity is 
all that is required by HRS §
 
91-7,” and therefore the court did not err in “refusing to also
 declare the Rule void ab initio or ‘always . . . ultra vires.’” 
(Emphasis in original.) In the alternative, the Board contended
 that “even if Asato’s position were correct,” he was not entitled to
 the “voiding of all government contracts entered into pursuant to
 the Rule.” 
8
 To  reiterate,  the  court’s  order  concluded  that  “HAR  §  3-122-66  is
 
invalid,  pursuant  to  the  statutory  authority  under  HRS  §  91-7.”   Asato
 
construes  the  court’s  order  as  ruling  that  “HAR  §  3-122-66  was  invalid  as  of
 
the  date  of  entry  of  its  order.”   Asato  does  not  explain  why  it  was  relevant
that  the  court  declined  to  rule  that  HAR  §  3-122-66  “has  never  been  valid;”
however,  this  argument  is  apparently  linked  to  his  contention  that  the  court
should  have  invalidated  each  contract  issued  under  HAR  §  3-122-66.
 
12
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The Board explained that, first, “while HRS § 91-7 
allows a circuit court to hear attacks on a rule’s validity, it 
‘does not give the circuit court jurisdiction to hear a challenge to the application of a rule.’” (Quoting Puana v. Sunn, 69 Haw. 187, 189, 737 P.3d 867, 869 (1987).) (Emphasis in original.) Second, according to the Board, “voiding the contracts would clearly be improper because the parties to the contracts are not parties to this case,” and “the ‘absence of interested parties can be raised at any time even by a reviewing court on its own motion.’” (Quoting Marvin v. Pfleuger, 127 Hawai' i 490, 503, 280 
P.3d 88, 101 (2012).) (Emphasis in original.) 
As to Asato’s argument that he was entitled to an 
injunction, the Board asserted that Asato waived any argument that he was entitled to an injunction because Asato’s Opening Brief did not “mention [] the standards required to obtain an injunction or [] attempt to argue that Asato met such standards.” Additionally, the Board noted that Asato “did not even file a motion for a preliminary or permanent injunction.” The Board explained that “‘[a]n injunction is an extraordinary remedy’ which is used when a problem cannot ‘be adequately redressed by an action at law.’” (Quoting Morgan v. Planning Dep’t, County of Kaua'i, 104 Hawai' i 173, 188, 86 P.3d 982, 997 (2004).) (Emphasis 
added.) Here, “[b]ecause the [court] declared that [HAR § 3-122­
13
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
66] was invalid, an injunction would have been superfluous even
 
if Asato had properly requested one.”

In his Reply Brief, Asato argued that “injunctive 
relief is an appropriate and necessary remedy to stop a government agency’s statutory violation,” and that “[n]o Hawai' i 
court has said an injunction is unnecessary to restrain a violation of a statute.” Additionally, according to Asato, he had standing as a taxpayer to challenge the individual contracts issued under HAR § 3-122-66, in addition to his challenge based on HRS § 91-7. Also, Asato contended that the Board failed to raise the issue of absent indispensable parties before the court and that “the identification and disposition of affected government contracts could take place on remand or in a separate proceeding[.]” (Citing Haiku Plantations Ass’n v. Lono, 56 Haw. 96, 103, 529 P.2d 1, 6 (1974).) Finally, Asato maintained that the Board’s indispensable parties argument also fails because “illegal, and hence, void, contracts are not enforceable against the government agency where the agency violated the procurement law or a public policy.”

HRS § 91-7.9 See Life of the Land, 63 Haw. at 176, 623 P.2d at
 
441. As related, Asato’s action was brought pursuant to HRS §
 
91-7, which allows “[a]ny interested person” to obtain “a
 
judicial declaration as to the validity of an agency rule.” The
 court determined that Asato had standing under HRS § 91-7.
10 The
 
9 Inasmuch as we find standing based on HRS § 91-7, we need not 
reach the claims raised on taxpayer standing or HRS § 632-1. It is said,
“[m]any states have liberalized taxpayer standing . . . and allow taxpayersuits against any improper expenditure without need to show special injury tothe plaintiff.” Akau v. Olohana Corp. , 65 Haw. 383, 387, 652 P.2d 1130, 1133 
(1989). The ability to challenge illegal public expenditures is “based upon .. . the taxpayer’s equitable ownership of such funds and his liability toreplenish the public treasury for deficiencies caused by themisappropriation.” Hawai'i’s Thousand Friends v. Anderson , 70 Haw. 276, 282,
768 P.3d 1293, 1298 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). This court has 
recognized that in “special situations,” such as where the State awards 
government contracts involving “patently improper and defective bidding procedures,” a plaintiff does not need to demonstrate actual pecuniary harmbecause the harm to taxpayers “could be presumed.” Iuli, 62 Haw. at 185-86,
613 P.3d at 657; see also Federal Electric , 56 Haw. at 62, 527 P.2d at 1290;
Mottl v. Miyahira , 95 Hawai 'i 381, 391 n.13, 23 P.3d 716, 727 n.13 (2001). 
10 Although the court did not decide the taxpayer standing issue, it
 
may be noted that the dissent contends that the “special situation” discussed
 in Iuli and Federal Electric is not presented here because (1) “HAR § 3-122-66
 
[] is not an ‘innovative procedure without the benefit of definitive
 guidelines,’” dissenting opinion at 28 (quoting Federal Electric , 56 Haw. at
66, 527 P.2d at 1291), (2) unlike in the instant case, in Federal Electric ,
the City awarded a contract to a bidder whose bid exceeded the plaintiff by
more the $90,000, dissenting opinion at 28, and (3) Federal Electric and Iuli
 
were “decided at a time when there was no express provision allowing for a
judicial action by disappointed bidders.” Dissenting opinion at 26-28.
Respectfully, the foregoing is incorrect. First, to reiterate,
Iuli recognized that harm may be presumed in all cases involving “patently
 
improper or defective bidding procedures,” irrespective of whether those
 procedures were “innovative.” Iuli, 62. Haw. at 185-86, 613 P.3d at 657.
Second, Federal Electric did not rely on the fact that the plaintiff was the
lowest bidder. The issue in Federal Electric was not that the plaintiff’s bid
was the lowest bid, but rather that due to indefinite specifications, it could
not be determined whether the plaintiff was in fact the lowest bidder.
Federal Electric , 56 Haw. at 62, 527 P.3d at 1289. Third, the lack of any
express provision allowing for suit by a disappointed bidder was irrelevant
inasmuch as the law granted disappointed bidders standing to sue irrespective
of their standing as taxpayers. Id.; see also, e.g. , In re Air Terminal
Servs., 47 Haw. 499, 510-12, 393 P.2d 60, 68 (1964) (holding that a
disappointed bidder who was not a taxpayer had standing to argue that it had a
“clear legal right to be awarded the contract”). Thus, the requirements
imposed by the dissent on taxpayer standing in this area are inconsistent with

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
analysis as to HRS § 91-7 in this opinion differs from that of
 
the court, in that Asato is not required to satisfy the three-
part injury in fact test in order to obtain standing as an
 “interested person”.
 
B.
 
This court has considered what is required to become
 
“[a]ny interested person” under HRS § 91-7 in two prior cases. 
In Life of the Land, the plaintiffs challenged the legality of
 procedures followed by the Land Use Commission in boundary
 review. Id. at 177, 623 P.2d at 441. The Land Use Commission
 
asserted that the plaintiffs had not demonstrated standing to
 seek judicial relief. Id. at 171, 623 P.2d at 437-38. 
In rejecting the Land Use Commission’s argument, this
 
court articulated the general principle that “we have not been
 inclined to foreclose challenges to administrative determinations
 through restrictive applications of standing requirements, and
 see no sound reason for doing so here.” Id. at 171, 623 P.2d at
 
438. Life of the Land further took note of the “expansive trend
 
in defining injury for standing purposes,” as articulated in In
 re Hawaiian Elec. Co., 56 Haw. 260, 535 P.2d 1102 (1975):
 
“We note that the trend in American jurisprudence as
evidenced by recent decisions of this court and courts
 
10(...continued)
our  precedent.

     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
across the land, has been to broaden the class of persons that
have standing to challenge agency action. The United States
 Supreme Court has clearly indicated that standing cannot be
confined only to those who allege economic harm, nor can it be
denied to others simply because many persons share the same
purported injury . . . .”
 
Life of the Land, 63 Haw. at 175, 623 P.2d at 440 (emphasis
 
added) (quoting In re Hawaiian Elec. Co., 56 Haw. at 256 n.1, 535
 P.2d at 1105 n.1). This court further observed that
 “‘[c]omplexities about standing are barriers to justice; in
 removing the barriers the emphasis should be on the needs of
 justice.’” Id. at 174 n.8, 623 P.2d at 439 n.8 (quoting E.
 
Diamond Head Ass’n v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals, 52 Haw. 518, 523
 n.5, 470 P.2d 796, 799 n.5 (1971)). “Our touchstone[,]” Life of
 the Land concluded, therefore “remains ‘the needs of justice.’” 
Id. at 176, 623 P.2d at 441.
 
Having articulated the standing doctrine thus, Life of
 
the Land surmised that the plaintiff organization and its members
 had a “‘stake’ in the outcome of the alleged controversy adequate
 to invoke judicial intervention, even though they [were] neither
 owners nor adjoining owners of land reclassified by the Land Use
 Commission . . . .” Id. at 177, 623 P.2d at 441. In applying
 
HRS § 91-7, this court determined that because the plaintiffs had
 interests that “may have been adversely affected, they
 undoubtedly [were] ‘interested persons[,]’” for purposes of HRS §
 
17
         
           
             
              
            
               
               
             
           
            
            
            
             
            
          
         
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
91-7.11 Id. at 177-78, 623 P.2d at 441. It also noted that
 
plaintiffs had been deemed “aggrieved persons” in a prior case
 
and thus were undoubtedly “interested persons.” Id. at 178, 623
 
P.2d at 441.
 
In Richard, this court seemingly adopted a more 
stringent standing requirement for “[a]ny interested person” than was necessarily required in Life of the Land. Instead of concluding simply that the plaintiffs had interests that “may have been adversely affected,” Life of the Land, 63 Haw. at 177­78, 623 P.2d at 441, Richard required that the plaintiffs demonstrate an “injury in fact.” Richard, 82 Hawai' i at 253-54, 
921 P.2d at 173-74. However, it is not clear how Richard reached this conclusion. Richard states that it was relying on Bush, 
which, according to Richard, “applied the ‘injury in fact’ test to determine the standing of a party who had filed a declaratory judgment action under HRS § 91-7.” Richard, 82 Hawai' i at 253, 
11
 The dissent notes that this statement is “not at odds with the
 
application of the injury in fact test.” Dissenting opinion at 17. Although
 
not “at odds” with the injury in fact test, Life of the Land did not
explicitly require that all three prongs of the injury in fact test be
satisfied in its discussion of standing under HRS § 91-7. See 63 Haw. at 177­
78, 623 P.2d at 441. The dissent further states that “nothing in Life of the
Land suggests that a plaintiff need not demonstrate injury in fact in order to
have standing under HRS § 91-7[,]” dissenting opinion at 18-19, yet, nothing
in Life of the Land requires that a plaintiff demonstrate injury in fact
either. Indeed, were the criteria for “[a]ny interested person” the same as
 the injury in fact test for an “aggrieved” person, this court would have
simply said so in Life of the Land , since the plaintiffs had already been
designated as “aggrieved” persons, having met the injury in fact test. That
 the standing threshold for “interested person[s]” was not the same is
 manifested by that fact, and the extended discussion concerning “interested
 person[s]” in Life of the Land .
 
18
         
           
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
921 P.2d at 173. However, Bush does not mention either HRS § 91­
7 or “[a]ny interested person”, or provide any analysis on why the injury in fact test should apply to “[a]ny interested person[s].” See Bush, 81 Hawai' i at 479, 918 P.2d at 1135. 
Thus, it was not evident why “[a]ny interested person”
 
must meet the injury in fact test under Richard, when, in Life of
 the Land, this court stated that a plaintiff who has interests
 that “may have been adversely affected,” is “[a]ny interested
 person.” Life of the Land, 63 Haw. at 177-78, 623 P.2d at 441
 
(emphasis added). Accordingly, in the absence of supportive
 reasoning, it is difficult to accord governing impact to this
 
12
 aspect of Richard,  particularly where the plain language of HRS
§ 91-7 and the legislative history of that statute require a
 different result that is in accord with Life of the Land.
 
C.
 
In the context of HRS § 91-7, “[a]ny” means “one
 
selected without restriction.” Merriam Webster’s Collegiate
 
Dictionary 53 (10th ed. 1993). “Interested” is defined as “being
 affected or involved[.]” Id. at 610. “Persons” is defined in
 
HRS § 91-1 (1993) broadly as “individuals, partnerships,
 corporations, associations, or public or private organizations of
 any character other than agencies.” Therefore, “[b]ased on the
 
12
 Richard is overruled to the extent that it may conflict with the
 
decision herein.

plain language of [HRS § 91-7], then, [any] interested person[ is
 
one who is, without restriction] ‘affected’ by or ‘involved’”
 with the validity of an agency rule. AlohaCare v. Ito, 126
 
Hawai'i 326, 360, 271 P.3d 621, 655 (2012) (Acoba, J., concurring 
and dissenting). This is consistent with the holding in Life of
 the Land that a plaintiff who has interests that “may have been
 adversely affected,” is an “interested person.”
13 63 Haw. at
 
177-78, 623 P.2d at 441. Under the circumstances of this case,
 Asato qualifies as an “interested person” because, as a taxpayer
 challenging a specific public bidding procedure, he may be
 affected by the validity of a regulation that allegedly allowed
 an illegal expenditure of public funds.
14 See e.g., Hawai' i’s 
Thousand Friends, 70 Haw. at 282, 768 P.3d at 1298. 
13 The dissent argues that where the legislature has intended “any
 
person” to be able to bring suit, it has used the term “any person”.
 
Dissenting opinion at 22-23. See, e.g., HRS § 91-12. However, Asato is not
 
simply “[a]ny person”, but a taxpayer who may be affected by the illegality of
a bidding procedure. Also, by the same token, the term “[a]ny interested
 person” does not by its plain language require that an individual have met the
injury in fact test.
 
14
 The dissent states that “Asato made no showing that he was either
 
personally ‘affected’ by or ‘involved’ with HAR § 3-122-66.” Dissenting
 opinion at 21. However, Asato is affected as a taxpayer, in challenging the
validity of a specific bidding procedure in the procurement context . In that
 
specific situation, our taxpayer cases indicate harm may be presumed. See nn.
 
9 and 10, supra. By stating that the majority “fails to point to any
allegation made by Asato that he was personally affected by or involved with
HAR § 3-122-66[,]” dissenting opinion at 21-22 (emphasis added), the dissent
appears to be arguing that Asato could not meet the injury in fact test;
however, we hold that that test does not apply for the reasons set forth supra
and infra. For the same reasons, Asato’s complaint was sufficient to
withstand summary judgment. See dissenting opinion at 11 n.2.
 
20
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
D.
 
Furthermore, in adopting HRS § 91-7, the legislature
 
deviated from the MSAPA with respect to who may be “[a]ny
 
interested person.” See Model State Administrative Procedure
 
Act, 1961 Act (U.L.A.) § 7. The MSAPA section setting out a
 procedure for declaratory judgments as to the validity or
 applicability of rules provides, as its first sentence, that:
 “The validity or applicability of a rule may be determined in an
 action for declaratory judgment in the [court], if it is alleged
 that the rule, or its threatened application, interferes with or
 impairs, or threatens to interfere with or impair, the legal
 rights or privileges of the plaintiff.” Id. (emphasis added). 
In contrast, the first sentence of HRS § 91-7(a) provides, to
 reiterate, that “[a]ny interested person may obtain a judicial
 declaration as to the validity of an agency rule . . . .”
 
In explaining this departure from the MSAPA, the House 
Judiciary Committee stated that “[y]our Committee is of the opinion that this section will allow an interested person to seek judicial review on the validity of a rule for the reasons enumerated therein regardless of whether there is an actual case or controversy.” H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 8, in 1961 House Journal, at 658 (emphasis added). The three-part injury test serves as Hawai' i’s counterpart to the Article III “cases and 
controversies” requirement. See Bush, 81 Hawai' i at 479, 918 
21
         
           
           
              
          
           
             
           
             ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
P.2d at 1135; Life of the Land, 63 Haw. at 172, 623 P.2d at 438. 
See also Mottl, 95 Hawai' i at 396, 23 P.3d at 731 (Acoba, J., 
concurring, joined by Ramil, J.) (“Our analogue of ‘article III’ jurisdictional requirements is the three-part injury test.”). However, courts of this state are not bound by the U.S. Constitution’s Article III, § 2 “cases or controversies” requirement. See Life of the Land, 63 Haw. at 171-72, 623 P.2d 
at 438. 
Accordingly, where the legislative history of HRS § 91­
7 indicates that no “actual case or controversy” is required, see
 1961 House Journal, at 658, the legislature obviously intended to
 liberalize standing requirements.
15 As a result, this court
 
should not mandate that the three-part injury test is necessary
 to bring an action pursuant to HRS § 91-7.
 
E.
 
Moreover, it is well-established that the requirements 
to be “[a]ny interested person” are less than those to be an “aggrieved person” in HRS chapter 91.
16 See AlohaCare, 126 
Hawai'i at 344, 271 P.3d at 640; Richard, 82 Hawai' i at 253, 921 
15
 This is also evidenced by the language of HRS § 91-7(a), which
 
states that “[t]he action may be maintained whether or not petitioner has
first requested the agency to pass upon the validity of the rule in question.”
 
16
 HRS 91-14 (Supp. 2004) uses the term “person aggrieved”. That
 
section provides for judicial review for “[a]ny person aggrieved by a final
decision and order in a contested case or by a preliminary ruling of the
nature that deferral of review pending entry of a subsequent final decision
would deprive appellant of adequate relief . . . .” HRS § 91-14(a).
 
22
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
P.2d at 173; Life of the Land, 63 Haw. at 177-78, 623 P.2d at
 
441. Indeed, by using the term “[a]ny interested person” rather 
than “aggrieved [person]”, the legislature established a “broader platform” for “persons” bringing actions under HRS § 91-7. Cf. 
AlohaCare, 126 Hawai' i at 362, 271 P.3d at 657 (Acoba, J., 
concurring and dissenting) (noting that in the context of HRS § 91-8 (1993), “[a]ny interested person” should be construed differently from an HRS § 91-14 “aggrieved person”). 
Under our case law, an “aggrieved person” is one who 
has suffered an injury in fact, see E & J Lounge Operating Co. v. Liquor Comm’n of City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 118 Hawai' i 320, 346 
n.35, 189 P.3d 432, 458 n.35 (2008), and therefore, the term “[a]ny interested person” is one who is subject to less stringent standing requirements. Based on the plain language of HRS § 91­7, the legislative history, and the differences between an “interested person” and a “person aggrieved” in Chapter 91, an “interested person” need not show injury in fact in order to bring an action pursuant to HRS § 91-7. 
Also, our courts have “broadened standing in actions 
challenging administrative decisions[,]” Mottl, 95 Hawai' i at 
391, 23 P.3d at 726, and “in cases of public interest under our jurisdiction[,]” Bush, 81 Hawai' i at 479, 918 P.2d at 1130. As 
was held in Pele Defense Fund v. Paty, 73 Haw. 578, 837 P.2d 1247 (1992), “[t]his court has adopted a broad view of what 
23
         
 
          
             
              
          
            
          
           
               
          
              
            
      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
constitutes a ‘personal stake’ in cases in which the rights of 
the public might otherwise be denied hearing in a judicial form.” 73 Haw. at 593, 837 P.2d at 1257 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Life of the Land, explained that “standing 
requirements should not be barriers to justice.” 63 Hawai' i at 
174, 623 P.2d 431. In this case, to deny Asato standing as an “interested person” would be to effectively erect a barrier to justice by preventing judicial review of the validity of HAR § 3­122-66
.17 
One of the reasons stated for imposing the injury in 
fact requirement is to deny standing in cases where the litigant “‘seek[s] to do no more than vindicate [his or her] own value preferences through the judicial process[.]’” Richard, 82 
Hawai'i at 253, 921 P.2d at 174 (quoting Sierra Club v. Morton, 
405 U.S. 727, 740 (1972)). Instead, the litigant here sought a declaratory judgment as to the validity of a regulation. This type of action cannot be said to be one that vindicates Asato’s own value preferences through the judicial process, because if 
17
 The dissent states that we “impl[y] that standing under Life of
 
the Land is so expansive that the injury in fact requirement no longer applies
under HRS § 91-7.” Dissenting opinion at 17. To the contrary, we simply
articulate the principles in Life of the Land indicating what “[a]ny
 
interested person” means under HRS § 91-7. Although the dissent would mandate
the same injury in fact requirement, applicable to “aggrieved person[s],” in
 contested cases under HRS § 91-14 for “[a]ny interested person[s]” in claims
 brought under HRS § 91-7, it sets forth no reasons why the injury in fact test
applied to aggrieved persons should be mandated for “[a]ny interested person”
in the context of dissimilar actions and remedies under HRS § 91-7. See State
 
v. Fields, 67 Haw. 268, 274, 686 P.2d 1379, 1385 (1984) (internal quotation
marks and citation omitted).
 
24
         
         
         
      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the regulation is indeed invalid, then the action brought by
 
Asato will actually serve to uphold the legislature’s intent in
 the government procurement area.
 
F.
 
As noted, HAR § 3-122-66 allowed for the Board to, 
under certain circumstances, procure professional services where less than three potential qualified persons had been identified, HAR § 3-122-66(a), in contrast with HRS § 103D-304(g) which required that “[t]he selection committee shall rank a minimum of three persons based on the selection criteria and send the ranking to the head of the purchasing agency.” In bringing an action to determine whether the promulgation of HAR § 3-122-66 exceeded the scope of the Board’s authority outlined in the procurement code, Asato therefore sought to effectuate the purposes behind the procurement code, and accordingly, the public interest. See CARL Corp. v. State, Dep’t of Educ., 85 Hawai' i 
431, 455, 946 P.2d 1, 25 (1997) (noting that “[i]t is certainly in the public interest that the [State] abide by the procurement rules it has set for itself”). 
When the legislature enacted the current procurement
 
code, HRS chapter 103D in 1993, it set out a number of intended
 purposes in the preamble to the act, among which were:
 
(4) Ensuring the fair and equitable treatment of all persons

1993 Haw. 1st Special Sess. Laws Act 8, § 1 at 38-39. A
 
challenge to the validity of a particular regulation as outside
 the scope of the procurement code protects the principles under
 which the HRS chapter 103D was enacted. Specifically, Asato’s
 complaint contended that “[c]ontracts issued in circumvention of
 the ‘minimum of three persons’ requirement [in] HRS § 103D-304(g)
 violate . . . the long established public policies . . .
 including ‘[p]roviding increased economy in procurement
 activities and maximizing to the fullest extent practicable the
 purchasing value of public funds.’” (Quoting HRS § 103-304(g).) 
Inasmuch as Asato sought to sustain the objectives of the
 procurement code, his action was “a case of public interest,”
 
Bush, 81 Hawai' i at 479, 918 P.2d at 1130, and therefore relaxed 
standing requirements would apply.18 Therefore, Asato has
 
18 Additionally, a determination that Asato has standing to challenge 
the regulation herein is consistent with the principle of separation of 
powers. It has been explained that “[w]ithout judicial review, there would be no ‘check’ on the propriety of the agency’s actions under the law and theagency could be left to decide the legality of its own actions.” Alakai Na 
Keiki, Inc. v. Matayoshi , 127 Hawai 'i 263, 277, 277 P.3d 988, 1002 (2012)
(citing McHugh v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd. , 777 P.2d 91, 107 (Cal. 1989).
Consequently, “if the legislature delegates judicial power to anadministrative agency and precludes judicial review of the legality of theagency’s own actions, a separation of powers issue would arise.” Id. HRS § 
91-7 allows for judicial review of the validity of agency rules. However, ifjudicially-imposed standing limitations preclude review of administrative

standing to challenge the validity of HAR § 3-122-66, under HRS §
 
91-7, as mandated by “the needs of justice.” Life of the Land,
 
63 Haw. at 176, 623 P.2d at 441.
 
G.
 
The dissent asserts that “until today, it has been well
 
settled that a plaintiff must satisfy the three-part injury in
 order to have standing under HRS § 91-7[,]” dissenting opinion at
 16, and that we abandon long standing precedent in reaching a
 different conclusion. Id. Respectfully, based on the previous
 
cases, the standing issue is squarely presented in this case and
 previously was not “well settled.” In the discussion of standing
 in the context of HRS § 91-7, this court never actually applied
 the three-part injury in fact test in Life of the Land or
 indicated that it must be applied in order for a plaintiff to be
 an “interested person.” 63 Haw. at 177-78, 623 P.2d at 441. 
While the plaintiffs in that case clearly would have satisfied
 the test, because they had already been deemed “aggrieved
 persons,” this court did not require in Life of the Land that
 plaintiffs allege an injury in fact in order to achieve HRS § 91­7 standing. Id. In Richard, as noted, no reasoning was
 
proffered as to why an “interested person” must meet the injury

agency actions, in contravention of the doctrine of separation of powers.

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
in fact test, despite the fact that it was the first case to 
articulate that requirement. 82 Hawai' i at 253-54, 921 P.2d at 
173-74. Instead, Richard may have erroneously assumed that the issue had already been resolved in Bush. Id. at 253, 921 P.2d at 
173. Thus, the issue of HRS § 91-7 standing was far from “well
 
settled.”
 
Of course, the doctrine of stare decisis must not be 
treated lightly. See State v. Garcia, 96 Hawai' i 200, 206, 29 
P.3d 919, 925 (2001). However, under these circumstances, we seek to address an issue that was not well-supported or well-settled, and in doing so, review an ancillary holding of Richard, which in any event, was not necessarily intended to set precedent in this area. No reasoned or comprehensive discussion of the meaning of the phrase “[a]ny interested person,” or the legislative history of HRS § 91-7, including its source in the MSAPA, has been had in any of our cases. Standing is a prudential doctrine, see Citizens for Protection of North Kohala Coastline v. County of Hawai' i, 91 Hawai' i 94, 100, 979 P.2d 1120, 
1126 (1999), and where no prudential reasons have ever been set forth in support of a particular standing requirement, review of that requirement is warranted, as we do so here. 
IV.
 
We conclude that HAR § 3-122-66 manifestly exceeds the 
28
         
       
         
        
         
       
        
      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
scope of the authority granted to the Board by the legislature. 
To reiterate, HRS § 91-7(b) provides that “[t]he court shall
 declare the rule invalid if it finds that it . . . exceeds the
 statutory authority of the agency[.]” The court in this case
 correctly determined that “HAR § 3-122-66, as a rule allowing
 waiver of HRS § 103D-304(g), contradicts or conflicts with the
 statute it attempts to implement.”
 
In connection with the rule-making authority of
 
administrative agencies,
 
“a public administrative agency possesses only such rule-
making authority as is delegated to it by a state
legislature and may only exercise this power within the
framework of the statute under which it is conferred.
 Administrative rules and regulations which exceed the scope
of the statutory enactment they were devised to implement
are invalid and must be struck down.”
 
Haole v. State, 111 Hawai' i 144, 152, 140 P.3d 377, 385 (2006) 
(quoting Stop H-3 Ass’n v. State Dep’t of Transp., 68 Haw. 154, 
161, 706 P.2d 446, 451 (1985)) (other citations omitted). Moreover, “an administrative agency can only wield powers expressly or implicitly granted to it by statute.” Id. (quoting 
Morgan, 104 Hawai' i at 179-80, 86 P.3d at 988-89). Thus, the 
authority of the Board is delineated by the statutory authority given to it by the legislature. See Puana, 69 Haw. at 189, 737 
P.2d at 870 (holding that an agency’s authority “is limited to enacting rules which carry out and further the purposes of the legislation”). 
29
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Of course, an administrative agency may also exercise
 
its authority through implied powers not expressly granted,
 
inasmuch as “the legislature cannot foresee all the problems
 incidental to carrying out the duties and responsibilities of the
 agency.” Haole, 111 Haw. at 152, 140 P.3d at 385 (citation
 
omitted). However, such implied powers are limited to those
 “reasonably necessary to carry out the powers expressly granted.” 
Id. (citation omitted).
 
Moreover, “[i]t is axiomatic that an administrative rule 
cannot contradict or conflict with the statute it attempts to implement.” Agsalud v. Blalack, 67 Haw. 588, 591, 699 P.2d 17, 19 
(1985) (citations omitted); see Hyatt Corp. v. Honolulu Liquor Comm’n, 69 Haw. 238, 241, 738 P.2d 1205, 1206-07 (1987). A rule that conflicts with an enabling statute must be declared invalid as outside the scope of the agency’s authority. See Tamashiro v. 
Dep’t of Human Servs., 112 Hawai' i 388, 427, 146 P.3d 103, 142 
(2006) (holding that where the agency’s rule conflicted with HRS chapter 91, it exceeded the agency’s authority). 
The question in this case, then, is whether, in
 
promulgating HAR § 3-122-66 the Board was either (1) exercising
 the statutory authority granted to it by the legislature, or (2)
 exercising its implied power “reasonably necessary to carry out
 the powers expressly granted.” Haole, 111 Haw. at 152, 140 P.3d
 
at 385. If not, then the regulation must be struck down.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
A.
 
1.
 
First to be addressed is whether there is a conflict
 
between the regulation and the procurement code. As explained,
 the court found that there was a conflict between HAR § 3-122-66
 and HRS § 103D-304, inasmuch as HAR § 3-122-66 allows a waiver of
 HRS § 103D-304(g). 
The plain language of the relevant statute, HRS § 103D­
304(g) provides that: “The selection committee shall rank a minimum of three persons based on the selection criteria and send the ranking to the head of the purchasing agency.” (Emphasis added.) Where the word “shall” is used in statutes, it is “‘generally imperative or mandatory.’” Leslie v. Bd. of Appeals 
of Cnty. of Hawai' i, 109 Hawai' i 384, 393, 126 P.3d 1071, 1081 
(2006) (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 1375 (6th ed. 1990)). Thus, HRS § 103D-304(g) unambiguously requires that in every situation, the selection committee rank “a minimum of three persons.” 
The challenged regulation, HAR § 3-122-66(a)(1), on the
 
other hand, provides that:
 
(a) If the names of less than three qualified persons are
submitted pursuant to section 103D-304(g), HRS, the head of
the purchasing agency may determine that :
 
(1) Negotiations under section 103D-304(h), HRS,
may be conducted provided that:
 
(A) The prices submitted are fair and
reasonable; and
 
31
         
    
    
      
    
   
       
        
        
      
        
         
        
        
        
      
          
         
         
         
          
        
         
       
     
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(B) Other prospective offerors had
reasonable opportunity to respond; or
there is not adequate time to resolicit
through public notice statements of
qualifications and expressions of
interest.
 
(Emphasis added.) By its language, then, this regulation
 
provides for procurement procedures that may take place with
 “less than three qualified persons” under certain circumstances. 
19
 HRS § 103D-202 (Supp. 1997)  gives the Board the “authority and
responsibility to adopt rules, consistent with this chapter,
 governing the procurement, management, control, and disposal of
 any and all goods, services, and construction.” (Emphasis
 added.) HAR § 3-122-66 “exceed[s] the scope” of the Board’s
 authority to promulgate rules pursuant to HRS § 103D-202, because
 the rule provides for procurement to take place in a situation 
19 HRS § 103D-202 provides in full as follows:
 
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the [Board]
shall have the authority and responsibility to adopt rules,
consistent with this chapter, governing the procurement,
management, control, and disposal of any and all goods,
services, and construction. All rules shall be adopted in
accordance with chapter 91 ; provided that the [Board] shall
have the power to issue interim rules by procurement
directives, which shall be except from the public notice,
public hearing, and gubernatorial approval requirements of
chapter 91. The interim rules shall be effective for not
 more than eighteen months. The [Board] shall consider and
decide matters of policy within the scope of this chapter
including those referred to by a chief procurement officer.
The [Board] shall have the power to audit and monitor the
implementation of its rules and the requirements of this
chapter, but shall not exercise authority over the award or
administration of any particular contract, or over any
dispute, claim, or litigation pertaining thereto .
 
(Emphases added.)
 
32
          ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
that the statute, by its plain language, would not allow, and
 
thus is not consistent with HRS § 103D-304(g). 
Specifically, where there are less than three qualified 
persons that can be considered for a professional services contract, the statute, by use of the word “shall” would disallow the procedures set forth in HAR § 3-122-66 to continue. HRS § 103D-304(g). The regulation, however, would permit procurement procedures to continue and allow for negotiations and award, despite that fact that less than three qualified persons were submitted for consideration by the head of the purchasing agency. HAR § 3-122-66. Manifestly, this regulation is in excess of the limitations in HRS § 103D-304(g), and thus the Board did not have the authority to promulgate such a rule under its general rule-making authority set forth in HRS § 103D-202. The Board, then, exceeded the bounds of the “rule-making authority as [was] delegated to it by the state legislature,” Haole, 111 Hawai' i at 
152, 140 P.3d at 385, because the rule conflicts with HRS § 103D­304(g). 
This case is similar in some respects to Capua v. 
Weyerhaeuser Co., 117 Hawai' i 439, 184 P.3d 191 (2008). In 
Capua, this court considered whether a regulation promulgated by the director of the Labor and Industrial Relations (director) was inconsistent with a statute. 117 Hawai' i at 441, 184 P.3d at 
193. The regulation deemed that an employee waived the right to
 
33
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
certain vocational rehabilitation benefits when that employee had
 
been awarded permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits. Id. at
 
447, 184 P.3d at 199. The relevant statute stated that “‘[t]he
 director shall refer employees who may have or have suffered
 permanent disability as a result of work injuries . . . for such
 physical and vocational rehabilitation services as are
 feasible[,]’” and that “‘[t]he eligibility of any injured
 employee to receive other benefits under this chapter shall in no
 way be affected by the employee’s entrance upon a course of
 physical or vocational rehabilitation as herein provided.’” Id.
 
at 446, 184 P.3d at 198 (some emphasis omitted) (quoting HRS §
 386-25 (1993)). 
Capua concluded that, by its use of the mandatory term
 
“shall”, the statute mandated the director to refer an employee
 for vocational rehabilitation, including employees who had been
 awarded PPD benefits, contrary to the regulation. Id. Thus,
 
Capua determined that the regulation was inconsistent with the
 statute, and therefore beyond the authority of the director to
 promulgate. Id. at 448, 184 P.3d at 200.
 
The same situation is presented by the instant case,
 
where the statute requires that there “shall” be a minimum of
 three qualified persons considered, and the regulation, in
 contradiction, allows for a procedure whereby less than three
 qualified persons may be considered. As such, the regulation in 
34
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the instant case is plainly outside the express rule-making
 
powers granted to the Board. 
2.
 
HAR § 3-122-66 is also outside the scope of the implied
 
powers of the Board, because it directly conflicts with the
 procurement code. Where a regulation conflicts with a statute,
 the regulation cannot be said to be “reasonably necessary to
 carry out the powers” expressly granted to the administrative
 agency. Puana, 68 Haw. at 189, 737 P.2d at 870.
 
Moreover, although “the legislature cannot foresee all
 
the problems incidental to carrying out the duties and
 responsibilities of the agency[,]” id. (citation omitted), as
 will be explained infra, the legislature in this instance
 apparently did foresee the possibility that there would be less
 than three qualified persons for consideration. 
B.
 
In addition to the conflict between the plain language 
of the statute and regulation at issue, the legislative history of HRS § 103D-304 further supports the conclusion that HAR § 3­122-66 is invalid because it “exceed[s] the scope of the statutory enactment [it was] devised to implement . . . .” Haole, 111 Hawai' i at 152, 140 P.3d at 385. The requirement set 
forth by the legislature that there be a minimum of three persons 
35

identified by the selection committee was enacted to establish a
 
base number for the procurement process when “professional
 services” contracts are at issue.
 
“Professional services” means those services within the
 
scope of the practice of architecture, landscape
architecture, professional engineering, land surveying, real
property appraisal, law, medicine, accounting, dentistry,
public finance bond underwriting, public finance bond
investment banking, or any other practice defined as
professional by the laws of this State or the professional
and scientific occupation series contained in the United
States Office of Personnel Management’s Qualifications
Standards Handbook.
 
HRS § 103D-104 (Supp. 2011).
 
As noted, the current version of the Procurement Code
 
was enacted in 1993. See 1993 Haw. 1st Special Sess. Laws Act 8,
 
§ 1 at 37-38. 
Prior to 1993, the Procurement Code, at HRS
 
Chapter 103, did not differentiate between the procurement of
 
“professional services” and the procurement of other types of
 goods and services. See HRS Chapter 89 (1985 Repl.) The
 
legislature’s 1993 revisions to the HRS included a section
 specifically on the procurement of “professional services.” See
 
1993 Haw. 1st Special Sess. Laws Act 8, § 2 at 49. This section,
 HRS § 103D-304, as set forth by the legislature in 1993, stated
 as follows:
 
(e) . . . . Unless fewer than three submissions have
 
been received, the screening committee shall conduct
discussions with at least three persons regarding the
services which are required and the services they are able
to provide. . . . . The committee shall provide the head of
the purchasing agency with the names of the three persons
who the committee concludes is the most qualified to provide
the services required for the project, with a summary of
each of their qualifications.
 
36
         
        
         
       
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(f) The head of the purchasing agency shall evaluate
the summary of qualifications for each of the three persons
provided by the screening committee and may conduct
additional discussions with any of them.
 
See id. at 50 (emphasis added).
 
In 1995, the legislature amended HRS § 103D-304 to
 
delete the phrase, emphasized above, stating that “[u]nless fewer
 
than three submissions have been received, the screening
 committee shall conduct discussions with at least three persons 
. . . .” 1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 178, § 10 at 301-02. In 1997,
 the language “a minimum of three persons” was added to HRS §
 103D-304, in reference to the number of qualified persons that
 needed to be evaluated, 1997 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 21, § 1 at 26,
 and in 2003, the phrase “minimum of three persons” was moved to
 its current location, in subsection (g) of the statute. 2003
 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 52 § 5, at 78-79. Finally, in 2004, HRS §
 103D-304(g) was amended again, leaving the “minimum of three
 persons” language intact. 2004 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 216, § 1 at
 984.
 
Accordingly, in 1993, the legislature contemplated a
 
situation in which there could be less than three initial
 submissions to the preliminary screening committee (later termed
 the “selection committee”). However, this language was deleted
 in 1995, and thereafter there was no longer a provision allowing
 for less than three persons to be considered in connection with
 professional services procurements. The relevant Conference
 
37
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Committee Report from 1995 states that the legislature amended
 
the Procurement Code by “[c]larifying that agencies may publish
 more than one notice inviting persons engaged in providing
 professional services to submit current statements of
 qualifications and expressions of interest, and may publish
 additional notices if previously unanticipated needs for
 professional services arise.” Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 38, in 1995
 House Journal, at 969. Therefore, in connection with requiring
 no less than three persons to be considered, the legislature
 expanded the notice provisions inviting professional services
 persons to submit qualifications. See id. This legislative
 
history indicates that the legislature did consider the situation
 where there may be less then three qualified persons who could be
 identified for these types of procurements, and decided that the
 solution was to expand the invitation process to obtain more
 qualified professionals.
 
Relatedly, the 1995 revisions were aimed at the
 
evaluation process via confidential discussions as well as the
 allowance for less than three submissions to the screening
 committee for consideration. See 1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 178, §
 
10 at 302. As constituted prior to 1995, then-subsection (e) of
 HRS § 103D-304 was in conflict with itself. It provided that the
 screening committee had to conduct confidential communications
 with at least three persons regarding their services, “[u]nless
 
38
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
fewer than three submissions [had] been received.” Id. But, two
 
sentences later, it required that the screening committee
 
“provide the head of the purchasing agency with the names of the
 three persons who the committee concludes is [sic] the most
 qualified to provide the services required for the project[.]” 
Id. The conflict arises because it is not clear how, where less
 
than three submissions had been received, the screening committee
 could provide the head of the purchasing agency with “the names
 of the three persons” who were most qualified.
 
Pursuant to the 1995 revisions, the legislature altered
 
the procedure so that the screening committee could conduct
 confidential discussions with any person submitted to it, and
 also resolved the conflict in the pre-1995 statute by deleting
 the provision contemplating a situation where “fewer than three”
 submissions had been received by the screening committee. See
 
id. The alternative way the legislature could have resolved the
 
conflict would have been by allowing the screening committee to
 submit the names of less than three persons to the head of the
 purchasing agency where the screening committee itself had
 received less than three submissions. Instead, the legislature
 deleted any reference to a situation where the screening
 committee might be presented with “fewer than three” submissions. 
Id. 
39
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Inasmuch as the legislature specifically required that
 
there be a “minimum of three persons” considered, the Board was
 
unquestionably acting outside the scope of its authority when it
 promulgated HAR § 3-122-66, because it acted in conflict with the
 legislature’s purpose to ensure that there were three persons
 considered. Here, by overriding the solution to a problem that
 the legislature had already considered, the Board, in effect,
 implemented a legislative solution. It is not the role of
 administrative agencies to legislate outside the ken of their
 statutorily prescribed role. HAR § 3-122-66 thus exceeds the
 Board’s express powers and any implied powers that the Board may
 excercise. As discussed, because HAR § 3-122-66 directly
 conflicts with HRS § 103D-304(g), it cannot be justified under
 the general rule-making authority of the Board, set forth in HRS
 § 103D-202. HRS § 103D-202 provides only that the Board shall
 adopt rules “consistent with [HRS Chapter 103D.]” HAR § 3-122-66
 is not consistent with HRS Chapter 103D.
 
Also, it is not for this court to second-guess the
 
legislature’s intention when it set forth the specifics of the
 procurement process over a number of years and through numerous
 legislative amendments to the Procurement Code. It appears that
 that issue raised by HAR § 13-122-66 was in fact contemplated by
 the legislature, which in turn declined to provide for the
 remedial solution proffered by the Board. “‘[N]either the courts
 
40
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
nor the administrative agencies are empowered to rewrite statutes 
to suit their notions of sound public policy where the legislature has clearly and unambiguously spoken.’” State v. 
Harada, 98 Hawai' i 18, 50, 41 P.3d 174, 206 (2002) (Acoba, J., 
concurring and dissenting) (quoting 1 N. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction § 3.06, at 55 (5th ed. 1992-94)). As such, the statutory scheme must be upheld, requiring that the regulation be invalidated. See Haole, 111 Hawai' i at 152, 140 
P.3d at 385. 
V.
 
For the reasons described above, the statute and the
 
legislative history demonstrates, the issue here was specifically
 contemplated and addressed by the legislature. There is no “gap”
 to be filled by the administrative agency. 
A.
 
First, the statutory mandate at issue in this case,
 
that there be a “minimum of three persons” ranked by the
 selection committee, HRS § 103D-304(g), is in connection with the
 procurement of “professional services” only. “Professional
 services” includes recognized specialities where there are likely
 to be three qualified persons available and willing to provide
 “services within the scope of the practice of architecture,
 landscape architecture, professional engineering, land surveying, 
41
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
real property appraisal, law, medicine, accounting, dentistry,”
 
etc.
 
Second, even if there are less than three qualified
 
persons available for a particular service, there are other
 options available, including resolicitation, for example. Thus,
 as explained, when the legislature amended HRS § 103D-304 as part
 of Act 178 in 1995, expressly deleting the language “[u]nless
 fewer than three submissions have been received,” it noted that
 Act 178 also “[c]larifi[ed] that agencies may publish more than
 one notice inviting persons engaged in professional services to
 submit current statements of qualifications and expressions of
 interest, and may publish additional notices if previously
 unanticipated needs for professional services arise.” Conf.
 Comm. Rep. No. 38, in 1995 House Journal, at 969. HRS § 103D­304(b) provides that additional notices shall be given if, inter
 alia, “[t]he response to the initial notice is inadequate[,]” or
 “[n]ew needs for professional services arise.” Further, in the
 event that subsequent solicitation proves futile, or time does
 not allow for subsequent solicitation, the procuring entity may
 need to redefine the scope of the services sought.
 
Third, there are provisions in the Procurement Code
 
that allow for the procurement of services in an emergency, HRS §
 103D-307 (1993), or where the amount of the contract would be
 considered a “small purchase” pursuant to HRS § 103D-305 (Supp.
 
42
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
2009). See HRS § 103D-304(j) (allowing contracts under a certain
 
monetary amount to be negotiated “with at least two persons on
 
the list of qualified persons”). Thus, in either of these
 situations, the procuring entity has options for procurement
 processes that do not run afoul of HRS § 103D-304(g).
 
Taking all of these factors into consideration, the
 
statute would not lead to legally absurd results. State and
 county governments would not be precluded from procuring
 professional services such as architects and engineers where they
 can resolicit services, where they are able to redefine the scope
 of the work to obtain three qualified persons, where the
 procurement meets the statutory limits for a “small purchase”
 procurement, HRS § 103D-305, and where the procurement is an
 emergency procurement as described in HRS § 103D-307. 
Consequently, the legislature obviously accounted for those
 instances where three qualified persons might not be available. 
By doing so, the legislature manifested its adherence 
to the proposition that in the absence of these exceptions, that no award be made unless three qualified bidders are considered. The wisdom of that determination is committed to the legislature. See County of Kauai v. Baptiste, 115 Hawai' i 15, 60, 165 P.3d 
916, 961 (2007) (Acoba, J., dissenting, joined by Duffy, J.) (“[N]ot all wisdom resides in the judiciary. In our democracy, governance is a tripartite function.”). The legislature has 
43
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
clearly spoken, by virtue of the express language and legislative
 
history of HRS § 103D-304. Accordingly, the qualifications on
 the state’s and local government’s ability to procure
 professional services do not produce an erroneous result.
 
B.
 
Where the regulation provides for procedures outside
 
those authorized by the legislature, it necessarily follows that
 there is harm to the public. Where a contract award may be based
 on a consideration of less than the minimum number of “qualified
 persons” required by the statute, there may be an unwarranted
 basis for a review committee to determine that less than three
 persons is permissible. 
As currently constituted, the text requiring three
 
qualified persons effectuates the legislative purposes behind the
 Procurement Code, including “[p]roviding increased economy in
 procurement activities and maximizing to the fullest extent
 practicable the purchasing value of public funds,” and
 “[f]ostering effective broad-based competition within the free
 enterprise system[.]” 1993 Haw. 1st Special Sess. Laws Act 8, §
 1 at 38-39. By mandating that there be “a minimum of three
 persons” ranked in all professional services procurement not
 otherwise exempted from HRS § 103D-304, the Procurement Code
 ensures that the procuring entity is incentivized to obtain the 
44
         
        
 
         
        
       
    
        
        
      
       
       
    
       ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
widest possible range of qualified persons for a particular
 
project.
 
C.
 
Lastly, the Board alleges that HAR § 3-122-66 was
 
adopted in accordance with its authority under HRS § 103D­102(b)(4)(L). As noted previously, HRS § 103D-102(b)(4) provides
that 
 
(b) “ [Chapter 103D] shall not apply to contracts by
government bodies:
 
. . . .
 
(
4) To procure the following goods or services which are
available from multiple sources but for which procurement by
competitive means is either not practicable or not
advantageous to the State :
(A) Services of expert witnesses . . .
(B) Works of art for museum or public display;
(C) Research and reference materials including books,
maps, periodicals, and pamphlets . . .
(D) Meats and foodstuffs for the Kalaupapa settlement;
(E) Opponents for athletic contests;
(F) 
U
tility services whose rates or prices are
fixed  by  regulatory  processes  or  agencies;
(G)  Performances,  including  entertainment,  speeches,
and  cultural  and  artistic  presentations;
(H)  Goods  and  services  for  commercial  resale  by
the  State;
(I)  Services  of  printers,  rating  agencies,  support
facilities,  fiscal  and  paying  agents,  and  registrars
for  the  issuance  and  sale  of  the  State’s  or  counties’
 
bonds;
(J)  Services  of  attorneys  employed  or  retained  to
advise,  represent  or  provide  any  other  legal  services
to  the  State  or  any  of  its  agencies,  on  matters
arising  under  laws  of  another  state  or  foreign
country,  or  in  an  action  brought  in  another  state,
federal,  or  foreign  jurisdiction,  when  substantially
all  legal  services  are  expected  to  be  performed
outside  this  State;
(K)  Financing  agreements  under  chapter  37D;  and
(L)  Any  other  goods  or  services  which  the  policy  board
determines  by  rules  or  the  chief  procurement  officer
determines  in  writing  is  available  from  multiple
source  but  for  which  procurement  by  competitive  means
is  either  not  practicable  or  not  advantageous  to  the
State[.]
 
(Emphases added.)
 
45
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
However, it is plain that applying the canon of
 
statutory construction known as ejusdem generis, HAR § 3-122-66
 
cannot be reconciled under HRS § 103D-102(b)(4)(L). “The
 doctrine of ejusdem generis states that ‘where general words
 follow specific words in a statute, those general words are
 construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those
 objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.’” Singleton
 
v. Liquor Comm’n of Hawai' i, 111 Hawai' i 234, 242 n.14, 140 P.3d 
1014, 1022 n.14 (2006) (quoting Peterson v. Hawaii Elec. Light Co., 85 Hawai' i 322, 328, 944 P.2d 1265, 1271 (1997) (other 
citation omitted)). 
Subsection (L) is meant to identify particular goods or
 
services exempt from the requirements of the Procurement Code. 
The general words “[a]ny other goods or services” in subsection
 (L) must, under the doctrine of ejusdem generis, be construed in
 connection with the list of items (A) through (K) preceding it. 
Items (A) through (K) enumerate specific types of goods or
 services, for example, works of art, research and reference
 materials, out-of-state attorney services, printers, and
 performances. See HRS § 103D-102(b)(4)(A) - (K). The Board
 
would construe (L) not to exempt types of goods or services, but
 instead to provide an exemption when a particular factual
 situation is posited -- specifically, where less than three
 qualified persons are identified under HRS § 103D-304. This
 
46
         
      
       
        
       
      
       
       
   
        
         
          
        
        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
would give the general words “[a]ny other goods or services” in
 
HRS § 103D-102 (b)(4)(L) a meaning dissimilar to the specific
 exemptions enumerated at HRS § 103D-102(b)(4)(A) - (K), and
 therefore would be inconsistent with established principles of
 statutory construction. Accordingly, the factual situation of
 less than three qualified persons under the Board’s rule HAR § 3­122-66, cannot be rationalized as an unenumerated exception
 within the scope of HRS § 103D-102(b)(4).
 
Also, HRS § 103D-102(b)(4)(L) provides an exemption
 
only for “[a]ny other goods or services which the policy board
 determines by rules or the chief procurement officer determines
 in writing is available from multiple sources but for which
 procurement by competitive means is either not practicable or not
 advantageous to the State[.]” Id. (emphasis added). The
 
“rule[]” providing an exemption for these other goods and
 
20
 which specifically includes
 services is HAR § 3-120-4 (2011),  
20 HAR § 3-120-4 provides, in relevant part:
 
§ 3-120-4. Procurements exempt from chapter 103D, HRS.
 (a) Notwithstanding the intent of chapter 103D, HRS, to
require governmental bodies to procure their goods and
services through competitive bidding, it is acknowledged
that there may be situations where procurement by
competitive means is either not practicable or not
advantageous to the State.
 
(b) Exhibit A titled “Procurements Exempt From Chapter 103D,
 
HRS” dated 03/17/2011, is located at the end of this
chapter. This exhibit provides a list of goods and services
which the procurement policy board has determined to be
exempt from chapter 103D, HRS, because although such goods
(continued...)
 
47
         
        
       
      
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
an Exhibit listing the specific goods and services that the Board
 
has deemed exempt from HRS chapter 103D, “because although such
 goods and services may be ‘available from multiple sources,’
 their ‘procurement by competitive means would be either not
 practicable or not advantageous to the State.’” HAR § 3-120-4
 (quoting HRS § 103D-102(b)(4)). The Exhibit referenced in HAR §
 3-120-4 includes services such as “[b]urial services” and
 “[c]ourt reporter services”, but does not include “professional
 services” as defined in HRS § 103D-104. HAR § 3-122-66, in
 contrast, does not reference any language from HRS § 103D­102(b)(4), and focuses, again, on the number of qualified persons
 available rather than the type of good or service being procured. 
Thus, it is plain that HAR § 3-120-4, and not HAR § 3-122-66, is
 the Board’s rule by which it exempts goods or services not
 already enumerated in HRS § 103D-102(b)(4).
 
HAR § 3-122-66 is also inconsistent with HRS § 103D­
102(b)(4)(L), because HAR § 3-122-66 does not require that the
 “chief procurement officer determines in writing”, HRS § 103D­102(b)(4)(L), that the specific good or service is exempt from
 HRS Chapter 103D. 
20(...continued)
and services may be available from multiple sources, their
procurement by competitive means would be either not
practicable or not advantageous to the State .
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
48
         
        
          
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Rather, HAR § 3-122-66 allows the “head of the purchasing agency”
 
to determine that negotiations may be conducted “[i]f the names
 of less then three qualified persons are submitted . . . .” 
Therefore, for numerous reasons, HRS § 103D-102(b)(4)(L) cannot
 serve as a basis on which to justify the Board’s promulgation of
 HAR § 3-122-66, which is outside the scope of the Board’s
 authority.
 
VI.
 
Finally, the court did not err with respect to the
 
points of error raised by Asato on cross-appeal. First, the
 court did not err in refusing to declare that HAR § 3-122-66 “has
 never been valid and has always been ultra vires and void ab
 initio.” Instead, the court correctly complied with the language
 of HRS § 91-7 and declared the statute invalid. Second, the
 court did not err in “refusing to declare that every government
 contract issued under the invalid authority of HAR § 3-122-66 is
 void ab initio,” inasmuch as the validity of those contracts was
 not before the court.
21 Third, the court did not err in refusing
 
to grant a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting use
 of HAR § 3-122-66 because the legal remedy of declaring HAR § 3­
21
 The principles, as addressed herein, pertain to the universal
 
procurement of all professional services contracts and not to any particular
contract or “project.”
 
49
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
122-66 invalid constituted an adequate legal remedy rendering an
 
injunction unnecessary.22
 
A.
 
As to Asato’s first point of error on cross-appeal,
 
Asato’s argument regarding the validity of HAR § 3-122-66 was
 apparently linked to his contention that the court should have
 declared every award issued under HAR § 3-122-66 invalid,
 inasmuch as Asato maintained that the contracts were “void ab
 initio” because HAR § 3-122-66 “has never been valid.” However,
 as explained infra, the court correctly declined to declare every
 contract issued under HAR § 3-122-66 invalid.
 
The court’s ruling was consistent with HRS § 91-7. HRS
 
§ 91-7 states that “the court shall declare the rule invalid if
 it finds that it violates . . . statutory provisions, or exceeds
 the statutory authority of the agency.” (Emphasis added.) In
 consonance with the plain meaning of HRS § 91-7, the court
 declared that “HAR § 3-122-66 is invalid, pursuant to the
 
22 Asato’s  Opening  Brief  also  raised,  as  additional  points  of  error
 
(4)  that  “the  attorney  general  and  [the  Board]  improperly  contended  and
participated  in  the  enactment  and  perpetuation  of  HAR  §  3-122-66[,]”  (5)  that
“the  attorney  general  and  [the  Board]  have  disregarded  and  violated  their
public  trust  responsibilities,”  and  (6)  that  “the  attorney  general  and  [the
Board]  [should]  be  judicially  barred  or  estopped  from  asserting  the  issues  in
its  appeal[.]”   However,  these  are  not  truly  “points  of  error”  inasmuch  as 
they  do  not  state  an  “alleged  error  committed  by  the  court[.]”   Hawai'i  Rules 
of  Appellate  Procedure  Rule  28(b)(4)(i).   Moreover,  Asato  apparently  concedes 
that  these  issues  were  “not  argued  before  the  [court].”   See  State  v.  Moses,
102  Hawai'i  449,  456,  77  P.3d  940,  947  (2003)  (“As  a  general  rule,  if  a  party
does  not  raise  an  argument  at  trial,  that  argument  will  be  deemed  to  have  been
waived  on  appeal[.]”).   Thus,  these  contentions  of  error  are  not  discussed 
further. 
50
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
statutory authority under HRS § 91-7.” (Emphasis added.) Asato
 
points to nothing in the language or legislative history of HRS §
 91-7 requiring the court to declare that a rule “has never been
 valid,” instead of ruling that the rule “is invalid.” Hence, the
 court satisfied the statutory mandate of HRS § 91-7.
 
B.
 1.
 
As to Asato’s second point of error on cross-appeal,
 
the court did not err in refusing to rule that every government
 contract issued under HAR § 3-122-66 was void ab initio. In his
 Complaint, Asato requested a declaratory judgment that HAR § 3­122-66 was invalid pursuant to HRS § 91-7 and HRS § 632-1 and
 also requested that “all existing contracts in which HAR § 3-122­66 was used . . . be rescinded as being void ab initio.” 
However, Asato did not cite any authority allowing the court to
 rescind all contracts authorized under HAR § 3-122-66.
 
Similarly, Asato brought his motion for summary
 
judgment under, inter alia, HRS § 91-7 and HRS § 632-1, and
 maintained that “[t]here are no genuine disputes of material fact
 as to the meaning of the ‘minimum of three persons’ requirement
 in HRS § 103D-304(g) and the . . . inconsistency of HAR § 3-122­66 which nullifies the ‘minimum of three persons requirement.” 
In his memorandum in support of his motion, Asato again requested 
51
         
         
              
              
             
          
       
            
             
           
        
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
that the court “declare that every government contract issued
 
under the invalid authority of HAR § 3-122-66 is void ab initio.” 
However, Asato did not cite any authority allowing the court to
 declare every government contract invalid.
23
 
2.
 
As an initial matter, it is unclear whether Asato’s
 
request that the court rule that every contract awarded under HAR
 § 3-122-66 is invalid is brought under his declaratory action or
 his injunctive action. In any event, first, Asato’s request for
 declaratory judgment did not permit the court to invalidate each
 contract awarded under HAR § 3-122-66. HRS § 91-7 only allows
 parties to “obtain a judicial declaration as to the validity of
 an agency rule.” (Emphasis added.) Thus, this court has
 explained that “HRS § 91–7 does not give the circuit court
 jurisdiction to hear a challenge to the application of a rule”
 but instead allows for “attacks on a rule’s validity.” Puana, 69
 
Haw. at 189, 737 P.2d at 869 (emphasis added). In awarding
 contracts pursuant to HAR § 3-122-66, agencies “applied” that
 
23
 In Asato’s memorandum, he stated that “all contracts issued under
 
the invalid authority of HAR § 3-122-66 are [] void ab initio,” and cited to
 
Exhibits 1 and 4. Exhibit 1 was a copy of Asato’s complaint, which identified
26 contracts that Asato believed were issued under HAR § 3-122-66. Exhibit 4
 was a copy of a “Department of Transportation procurement award for
Architecture and Engineering professional services,” showing that the
 “selection list for th[e] contract did not have the ‘minimum of three persons
 required by HRS § 103D-304(g).” Asato also attached as Exhibit 19 the Board’s
 Answers to Interrogatories, which admitted that at least 11 of the 26
contracts identified in Asato’s complaint “were procurements awarded pursuant
 to HAR § 3-122-66.”
 
52
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
rule. Hence, Asato’s challenge to every contract awarded under
 
HAR § 3-122-66 could not be brought under HRS § 91-7.
 
Additionally, in an action brought under HRS § 632-1, 
it must be demonstrated that “antagonistic claims are present between the parties involved which indicate imminent and inevitable litigation,” or “a party asserts a legal relation, status, right, or privilege in which the party has a concrete interest and that there is a challenge or denial of the asserted relation, status, right, or privilege by an adversary party who also has or asserts a concrete interest therein.” HRS § 632-1. In other words, “‘the question is whether the facts alleged, under all the circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant a declaratory judgment.’” Kaho'ohanohano v. State, 114 Hawai' i 302, 332, 162 
P.3d 696, 726 (2007) (Acoba, J., concurring) (quoting United Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646 v. Yogi, 101 Hawai' i 46, 57, 62 
P.3d 189, 200 (2002)) (emphasis added). Absent any rendition of the circumstances surrounding each contract, it cannot be determined from the allegations whether there is a “substantial controversy” as to a particular contract that is “of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant a declaratory judgment.” Id. 
Hence, a declaratory judgment generally declaring that all the 
53
         
            
            
           
            
     
         
           
                
             
          
               
            
          
              
            
     
         
              
           
             
            
            
      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
contracts issued under HAR § 3-122-66 are invalidated cannot be
 
issued pursuant to HRS § 632-1.
 
Finally, the court could not have invalidated every
 
contract awarded under HAR § 3-122-66 as “ancillary relief” under
 either HRS § 91-7 or HRS § 632-3.
24 HRS § 632-3 provides that
 
“[f]urther relief based on a declaratory judgment may be granted
 whenever necessary or proper, after reasonable notice and
 hearing, against any adverse party whose rights have been
 adjudicated by the judgment.” (Emphasis added.) Here, however,
 the recipients of contracts awarded under HAR § 3-122-66 were not
 made parties to the case, and therefore their rights have not
 been “adjudicated by the judgment.” Consequently, the court
 
24 In his Reply Brief, Asato cited Costa v. Sunn , 5 Haw. App. 419,
 
697 P.2d 43 (1985) for the proposition that “the court's authority to grant
ancillary relief under § 91–7 is coextensive with its authority under HRS
Chapter 632.” However, Asato made no further argument as to why “ancillary
 relief” in appropriate in this case.
In Costa, the plaintiff challenged new rules for public assistance
programs promulgated by the Department of Social Services and Housing (DSSH).5 Haw. App. at 420, 697 P.2d at 45. The plaintiff brought a class action on behalf of “all residents of the State of Hawai 'i and members of their public
assistance households who were, or will be, adversely affected by [newrules].” Id. at 422, 697 P.2d at 46. In addition to invalidating the new
rules, the court ordered DSSH to reinstate the old rules and “reinstate all recipients or applicants who may have had their benefits reduced, terminated,or denied” pursuant to the new rules. The court held that these action were valid under the court’s authority to grant “ancillary relief.” Id. at 425, 
697 P.2d at 48. 
However, Costa cited HRS § 632-3 as authority for granting
“ancillary relief.” Id. at 425, 697 P.2d at 48. As explained infra, under
HRS § 632-3 ancillary relief is only available against parties whose rights
have been adjudicated. Inasmuch as Costa was a class action, all of the
parties were before the court and thus their rights were adjudicated. Here,
in contrast, Asato has requested relief against parties who are not before the
court. Hence, Costa is inapposite.
 
54
         
         
        
           
          
            
           
              
               
          
          
      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
could not have invalidated those contracts on the basis of
 
“ancillary relief.”
 
In his Reply Brief, Asato argued for the first time
 
that, in addition to supporting his standing to sue as a
 taxpayer, Lucas and Federal Electric served as a basis to
 invalidate the contracts awarded under HAR § 3-122-66. According
 to Asato, those cases demonstrate that, following a suit by a
 taxpayer, courts have a “continuing obligation to invalidate
 unlawful . . . government contracts.” However, as the Board
 points out, generally the parties to the contract must be made
 parties to a suit in which the contract is challenged. See Haiku
 
Plantations Ass’n v. Lono, 56 Haw. 96, 102, 529 P.2d 1, 5 (1974)
 (“This court cannot undertake to hear and determine questions
 affecting the interests of these absent persons unless they are
 made parties and have had an opportunity to come into court.”
 (internal quotation marks omitted)).
25 Moreover, any contract
 
remedies must be tailored to the facts of each case. See Air
 
Terminal Servs., 47 Haw. at 509, 393 P.2d at 67 (explaining the
 
25
 Asato apparently argues that, based on Haiku Plantations , if all
 
of the government contracts were invalidated, “the identification and
 
disposition of affected government contracts could take place on remand or in
a separate proceeding.” However, in Haiku Plantations , the court “reverse[d]
 
and vacate[d]” the portions of a declaratory judgment that were adverse to the
parties not before the court, and stated that further adjudication could be
had “in a future proceeding in which all of those having an interest are made
parties before the court.” 56 Haw. at 102, 529 P.2d at 6. Plainly, then,
under Haiku Plantations it would be inappropriate to make any determination
regarding the validity of government contracts when the parties to those
contracts are not before the court.

“unavailability of mandamus to attack a public contract when the
 
contract has not only been executed but possession has been taken
 and the concessionaire is operating under it”).
26 Thus, neither
 
case cited by Asato would permit the court to simply declare all
 the contracts invalid under the circumstances here.
27
 
C.
 
As to Asato’s third point of error on cross-appeal, it
 
has been explained that “courts generally will refuse to grant
 injunctive relief unless plaintiff demonstrates that there is no
 adequate legal remedy[.]” Wright and Miller, 
Federal Practice
 
and Procedure § 2944; see also Punohu v. Sunn, 66 Haw. 485, 487,
 666 P.2d 1133, 1135 (1983) (holding that injunctive relief was
 inappropriate because “the same relief can be obtained through an
 application for a stay in the administrative appeal under Chapter
 91,” and therefore “there is no lack of an adequate remedy at law
 
26 In Air Terminal Servs. , this court indicated that the disappointed
 
bidder should have sought injunctive relief because the contract had already
been issued. See Air Terminal Servs. , 47 Haw. at 509, 393 P.2d at 67
(rejecting the disappointed bidder’s argument that “the case should be treated
 the same as an injunctive suit”). However, this court explained that because
the recipient of the contract had been dismissed from the suit with prejudice,
and the disappointed bidder had failed to amend the complaint to state a claim
for injunctive relief against the recipient of the contract, the action must
be treated as a mandamus action, and that mandamus was not available “where
 the performance of the contract has proceeded as far as it has here.” Id. at
 
506, 510, 393 P.2d at 66, 68. Thus, under Air Terminal Servs. , it is apparent
that the recipient of the contract is a necessary party in a challenge to void
a contract that has already been awarded and partially performed.
 
27
 Inasmuch as the parties to the contracts awarded are not before
 
the court, see discussion supra, we do not discuss Asato’s contention that the
parties who have already performed work on the contracts issued under HAR § 3­122-66 are not entitled to any compensation on such contracts because the
contracts are void and against public policy.
 
56
         
       
         
        
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
available to the appellees”). Here, Asato requested injunctions
 
restraining the Board from “using HAR § 3-122-66 in the
 procurement of professional services under HRS § 103D-304[.]” 
However, by declaring HAR § 3-122-66 invalid, the court
 effectively ruled that HAR § 3-122-66 “is void and cannot be
 enforced.” Hyatt Corp., 69 Haw. at 240, 738 P.2d at 1206. 
Hence, the court’s ruling effectively prohibits the Board from
 using HAR § 3-122-66 in the procurement of professional services. 
In other words, the remedy provided by the court accomplished the
 same purpose as Asato’s requested injunctions. Consequently,
 there was “an adequate remedy at law,” and injunctive relief was
 not appropriate.
 
VII.
 
Inasmuch as we hold that Asato prevailed on his HRS §
 
91-7 challenge to the validity of HAR § 3-122-66, we must decide
 whether the court properly granted attorney’s fees and costs
 pursuant to the private attorney general doctrine.
 
The private attorney general doctrine is an equitable 
doctrine and an exception to the traditional “American Rule” that each party must pay its own litigation expenses. See Honolulu 
Const. & Draying Co. v. State, Dep’t of Land & Nat. Res., 130 Hawai'i 306, 308, 310 P.3d 301, 303 (2013). 
Courts applying the doctrine consider three basic factors :
(1) the strength or societal importance of the public policy
vindicated by the litigation, (2) the necessity for private
enforcement and the magnitude of the resultant burden on the
 
57
         
         
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
plaintiff, and (3) the number of people standing to benefit
from the decision.
 
Id. (emphasis in original) (quoting Sierra Club v. Dep’t of 
Transp. of State of Hawai' i, 120 Hawai' i 181, 218, 202 P.3d 1226, 
1263 (2009) (Sierra Club II)) (other citation omitted). 
The court’s determination as to the private attorney
 
general doctrine is reviewed “under the abuse of discretion
 standard,” however, “we review de novo whether the trial court
 disregarded rules or principles of law that arise in deciding
 whether or not a party satisfies the three factors of the private
 attorney general doctrine.” Id. at 313, 310 P.3d at 308. In
 
determining whether Asato was in fact entitled to fees, we need
 not address all three factors, inasmuch as we conclude that Asato
 is unable to satisfy the third prong of the doctrine.
 
As to the third criterion, “the number of people 
standing to benefit from the decision,” Sierra Club, 120 Hawai' i 
at 218, 202 P.3d at 1263 (citations omitted), the court determined that “proper enforcement of the procurement code via enforcement through HRS § 103D-304 is of benefit to all citizens of the state.” The Board contends, on the other hand, that “even if invalidation of the [r]ule could benefit someone in some theoretical case, there is no showing that even a handful of people, let alone many people, would benefit.” 
58
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
This court has found that the third prong of the 
private attorney general doctrine has been satisfied where 
plaintiffs have vindicated causes that included procedural rights related to environmental review, see Sierra Club v. Dept. of Transp., 115 Hawai' i 299, 304, 167 P.3d 292, 297 (2007) (Sierra 
Club I), Native Hawaiian cultural rights, Maui Tomorrow, 110 Hawai'i at 245, 131 P.3d at 528, and historic preservation, 
Honolulu Const. & Draying Co., 130 Hawai' i at 319, 310 P.3d at 
314. We have recognized that the third prong of the doctrine had 
been met where “all of the citizens of the state, present and future, stood to benefit from the decision.” In re Water Use 
Permit Applications, 96 Hawai' i 27, 31, 25 P.3d 802, 806 (2001) 
(Waiahole II) (citing In re Water Use Permit Applications, 94 Hawai'i 97, 98, 9 P.3d 409, 510 (2000) (Waiahole I) (recognizing 
the “ultimate importance of these matters to the present and future generations of our state”)). In connection with equitable rationales underlying the doctrine, we have also explained that the types of causes to which the private attorney general doctrine is applicable, “do not involve the fortunes of a single individual to the extent necessary to encourage their private vindication in the courts.” Honolulu Const. & Draying Co., 130 
Hawai'i at 319, 310 P.3d at 914 (emphasis in original) (quoting 
Waiahole II, 96 Hawai' i at 30, 25 P.3d at 802 (quoting Serrano v. 
Priest, 569 P.2d 1303, 1313-14 (Cal. 1977))). 
59
         
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In the instant case, the specific holding would apply
 
in future cases where there are fewer than three qualified
 
bidders for professional services contracts pursuant to HRS §
 103D-304(g). Asato argued, however, that all taxpayers will
 benefit from this action because they are entitled to expect
 “that all public funds will be spent lawfully and prudently[.]” 
But, there may be, for example, providers of 
professional services who would be individually affected or involved sufficiently to encourage them to bring a suit challenging the validity of a regulation promulgated pursuant to the Procurement Code. See Waiahole II, 96 Hawai' i at 30, 25 P.3d 
at 802. Thus, under the circumstances, this case does not meet the third criterion of the private attorney general doctrine, and accordingly Asato is not entitled to attorney’s fees and costs. 
VIII.
 
Subject to the reasons set forth above, the court’s
 
August 15, 2012 judgment is affirmed in part and vacated in part,
 and the court’s September 4, 2012 order awarding attorney’s fees
 and costs is reversed.
