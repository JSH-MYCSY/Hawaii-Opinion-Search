I. Introduction 
In this appeal, Appellants Sierra Club and Senator Clayton 
Hee 
oppose the Land Use Commission’s (“LUC”) reclassific ation of 
approximately 767.649 acres of Appellee Castle & Cooke Homes 
Hawaii, Inc.’s (“Castle & Cooke”) land from the state 
agricultural land use district to the state urban land use 
district. The land is slated for development of Castle &

Cooke’s Koa Ridge Makai and Waiawa projects. Appellants sought 
review of the LUC’s decision by the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit (“circuit court”),1 which dismissed their appeal. 
Appellants raise the following points of error: 
1. The trial court erred by refusing to uphold the 
requirements of Article XI, Section 3, of the Hawaii State 
Constitution. 
2. The decision of the State Court to uphold the 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decision and Order of the Land Use Commission is in violation of Act 183, HRS 
§[§] 205[- ]41-52. 
3. The decision of the State Court to uphold the 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decision and Order of the Land Use [C]omission is in violation of HAR § 15 -15-
77.  
Although there are three points of error, Appellants essentially 
make two points. First, they argue that the LUC should be 
required to “stay” the reclassification of the potentially 
important agricultural land at issue pending formal designation 
of Important Agricultural Lands (“IALs”) in each county ,2 
pursuant to the intent behind Article XI, Section 3 of the 
Hawaii Constitution, as implemented by Act 183 (points of error 
one and two). Second, they argue that the circuit court should 
have ruled that the LUC improperly weighed the evidence 
supporting its findings that the reclassification (1) would not 
substantially impair agricultural production, and (2) was 
1 The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided. 
2 Act 183 directed the counties to formally identify IALs, then submit 
IAL land maps to the county councils for decision -making.  The county 
councils then transmit the maps to the LUC, which then finally designates 
IALs. See 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (“HRS”) §§ 205 -47(a), (e), - 48, and -
49(a)(Supp. 2005). 
To date, formal IAL designation has not been completed.

reasonably necessary for urban growth, pursuant to Hawai i 
Administrative Rules (“HAR”) § 15-15-77(b)(6) (effective 2000 -
2013) (point of error three).  HAR § 15-15-77(b)(6) requires the 
LUC to “specifically consider” the following when reclassifying 
agricultural land: 
Lands in intensive agricultural use for two years prior to 
date of filing of a petition or lands with a high capacity for intensive agricultural use shall not be taken out of 
the agricultural district unless the commissions finds 
either that the action: 
(A) Will not substantially impair actual or potential 
agricultural production in the vicinity of the subject property or in the county or State; or 
(B) Is reasonably necessary for urban growth. 
We affirm the circuit court’s decision and order , which 
affirmed the LUC’s decision and order, and which dismissed 
Appellants’ appeal. This court has already recently held that, 
pursuant to Save Sunset Beach Coalition v. City & County of 
Honolulu, 102 Hawai i 465, 476, 78 P.3d 1, 12 (2003), Article XI, 
Section 3, standing alone, is not self-executing, and its 
constitutional history as well as the legislative history of Act 
183 do not reveal an intent to require the LUC to delay 
reclassifying agricultural land pending formal designation of 
IALs. See  Sierra Club , 2015 WL 9306955, *1.  Therefore, this 
opinion does not further address Appellants’ first and second 
points of error; rather, this opinion focuses on Appellants’ 
third point of error, whether the reclassification violated HAR 
§ 15-15-77(b)(6).  As to that point of error, we conclude that

 On October 3, 2011, Castle & Cooke filed a Petition for 
Land Use District Boundary Amendment (“Petition”) before the  
LUC. Castle & Cooke sought to reclassify approximately 767.649 
acres of land at Waipio and Waiawa, on the island of Oahu, from 
the agricultural district to urban district to develop the Koa 
Ridge Makai and Waiawa Project (the “Project”).  
 Castle & Cooke described the Koa Ridge Makai portion of the 
Project as follows:  
 
Castle & Cooke described the Waiawa portion of the project as 
consisting of “approximately 1,500 residential units comprised 
of a mix of single-family and multi-family residential units, a community center with neighborhood retail, a neighborhood park, *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
substantial evidence supported the LUC’s finding s that the 
reclassification of the land at issue in this case satisfied HAR 
§ 15-15-77(b)(6).  The evidence in support of these findings was 
adduced through Castle & Cooke’s witnesses, whose expertise and 
credibility the Appellants did not challenge. 
II. Background 
A. Land Use Commission Proceedings 
1. Castle & Cooke’s Petition 
Koa Ridge Makai is planned to consist of approximately 
3,500 residential dwelling units comprised of a mix of 
single-family and multi -family residential units, light 
industrial, commercial and community uses.  A mixed- use 
“Village Center” is planned to include a health care 
component, residential, commercial, and community center. Parks and open space are also planned throughout Koa Ridge 
Makai, together with churches, recreational centers,  and 
schools.

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
and an elementary school. Parks and open space are also planned 
throughout Waiawa.” According to its Incremental Development 
Plans, Castle & Cooke plans to develop Koa Ridge Makai first, 
then Waiawa.3 The Project lands are located within the Urban 
Community Boundary (“UCB”) of the Central Oahu Sustainable 
Communities Plan (“CO SCP”). According to the Final 
Environmental Impact Statement prepared for the Project, the CO 
SCP focuses “future residential development on master planned 
suburban communities within ” the UCB. The UCB “was established 
to provide long-range protection from urbanization for 10,500 acres of prime and unique agricultural lands and for 
preservation of open space, while providing adequate land for 
residential, commercial and industrial uses needed in Central 
Oahu for the foreseeable future.” 
2. 	Other Parties and Intervenors to the Petition 
Proceedings 
As the district boundary petition involved land areas 
greater than 15 acres, pursuant to HRS § 205-4(e)(1) (Supp. 
2005), “the office of planning[] and the county planning 
department” were mandated to appear as parties to “make 
recommendations relative to the proposed boundary change.” The 
Office of Planning (“OP”) and the City and County of Honolulu 
Under HAR § 15- 15-78 (effective 2000- 2013), the LUC can reclassify 
lands incrementally if “full development of the subject property cannot 
substantially be completed within ten years after the date of” the LUC’s 
approval.

 Castle & Cooke called Ann Bouslog, an expert in the fields 
of real estate, market assessment and economic impacts. She 
testified that the Project was necessary for urban growth in the 
region as follows:  “Oahu has an acute shortage of housing 
suitable for primary residents. . . . And this shortfall is 
expected to increase in the coming decades. Even with complete 
buildout of all identified planned and entitled units as of late 
last year, O ahu could be short some 30,000 units of primary 
housing by the year 2030.”   Bouslog projected that there would 
be a shortage of “at least 6500” homes “in Central O ahu based on 
DPP’s own 2009 projections. . . .” She testified that Central Oahu is a popular residential location and projected that all 
5000 of the Project’s homes would be bought between 2023 and *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Department of Planning and Permitti ng (“DPP”) generally 
supported the Petition.  The LUC granted the Sierra Club’s and 
Senator Clayton Hee’s petitions to intervene. They opposed the 
Petition and sought to protect the Project lands from urbanization. 
3. 	Evidence Presented at the LUC Hearings on the 
Petition 
The LUC held three evidentiary hearings on the Petition in 
early 2012. Relevant to the issues on appeal, the several 
individuals testified, and their testimony is summarized below. 
a. Testimony of Ann Bouslog 
6
    
 
 
  
    
 Castle & Cooke also called Bruce Plasch, an expert in 
agriculture and economic assessment.  He testified that the 
contraction of plantation agriculture released 177,000 acres for 
diversified agriculture by January 2010, with about 15,000 acres 
still available on O ahu.   2,500 acres were in upper Kunia, 8,500 
acres were on the North Shore, over 2,700 acres were near 
Kahuku, and about 1,700 acres were scattered throughout O ahu.   
According to Plasch, “most of these lands have soil ratings, 
solar radiation, and access to irrigation water similar to Koa 
Ridge Makai and Castle & Cooke Waiawa.”   Plasch testified that 
42,600 acres of land on O ahu is of high-quality outside the 
City’s urban growth boundaries.   Of that land, only 12,000 acres 
was being farmed in 2010, leaving nearly 30,000 acres available 
for diversified agriculture.   To farm these lands, which were 
once irrigated, Plasch testified, water infrastructure would need to be improved. Plasch also testified that the current 
agricultural tenants on the Project lands, Aloun Farms and 
Flying R Livestock Company, both secured replacement lands.

2026. When offered the chance to cross-examine Bouslog, the 
Appellants’ attorney stated, “No questions for this witness.” 
b. Testimony of Bruce Plasch

 The Appellants submitted into evidence the written 
testimony of Hector Valenzuela, a University of Hawai i professor 
and vegetable crop extension specialist.   He did not support the 
Petition because it “would represent a permanent loss to Oahu 
and to the state of a substantial portion of the previous 
remaining prime agricultural land available for diversified 
agricultural production.”  
    
    
 
 
  
  
 
 
                                                           
  
   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
c. 	Aloun Farms’ Letter of Support for the 
Petition 
Aloun Farms’ Principals, Alec and Mike Sou, submitted a 
letter in support of the Petition; it stated that their 335-acre 
replacement lands4 have “productive soils, a reliable source of 
water and existing irrigation systems which will support the 
cultivation of [Aloun Farms’] variety of crops.” 
d. Testimony of Hector Valenzuela 
4. 	The LUC’s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, 
and Decision and Order 
On June 21, 2012, the LUC approved the Petition by a vote 
of 7-0. The LUC issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of 
Law, and Decision and Order. With regard to whether the reclassification would impair agricultural production and was 
reasonably necessary for urban growth, the LUC made the 
following findings: 
In addition to the 335 acres Castle & Cooke provided to Aloun Farms, 
Dole Pineapple Plantation also offered Aloun Farms a lease over 332 
additional acres. 
8
 4    
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
87. In anticipation of the Project and to mitigate the 
impacts of development on agricultural operations, 
Petitioner arranged with Dole Foods to issue a lease to 
Aloun Farms for approximately 335 acres of former pineapple 
land located north of the Dole Plantation.  The lease term 
is for ten years, with a five -year renewal option.  In 
addition, approximately 332 acres of abutting lands have 
been offered to Aloun Farms. The approximately 667 acres 
of land being offered as replacement land is twice as much 
land as Aloun Farms is  farming currently at Koa Ridge.  The 
335 acres currently leased by Aloun Farms has sufficient access to water from the Tanada Reservoir, which provides fresh clean water to the replacement lands and is 
distributed through an existing irrigation delivery system 
throughout the site. Coordinated efforts to improve the 
delivery of year round supply of water are being worked out 
with Dole Foods, and a plan acceptable to Aloun Farms has been clearly laid out in Aloun Farms’ water contract. 
Aloun Farms has begun site [sic] and the soil amendment 
process of the 335 -acre replacement site and anticipates 
its first crops in the summer of 2012. The replacement 
lands will allow Aloun Farms to grow a variety of crops and 
maintain similar production, revenues, operating costs, *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
NEED FOR THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT. 
68. Oahu has an acute shortage of housing suitable for 
primary residents, and this shortfall is projected to 
continue to increase by 2030 based on growth projections. 
Even with complete buildout of all identified planned and entitled units as of July 2008, the  shortfall will be 
approximately 30,000 units by 2030. This is based on DPP’s 2009 population projections (which assume the State 
Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism’s 
2035 Series, published in 2008) and an updated inventory of 
Commission- entitled and planned potential future 
developments islandwide.   
 
69. There is a need to entitle at least 6,500 more units 
in Central O ahu. 
70. Central O ahu has proven to be a popular residential 
location due to its cool, upland climate, relative 
proximity to the island’s main employment centers, high 
quality master -planned communities, and affordability.  
71. The Project is estimated to close an avera
ge of 200 to 
425 residential units per year, and complete absorption of 
the Projects 5,000 residential units is projected to occur 
between 2023 and 2026.

Agricultural Resources 
. . . . 
9
    
 
 
    
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
96. The Island of O ahu has approximately 42,600 acres of 
high quality farmland outside of the City’s Urban Growth 
Boundaries, excluding lands under military control and 
lands in Kahuku that are scheduled to become a wildlife 
refuge. In 2010, an estimated 12,000 acres were farmed on 
Oahu, some of which was land within the Urban Growth 
Boundaries. Assuming that the farms in the Urban Growth 
Boundaries eventually relocate to land outside of the Urban 
Growth Boundaries, over 30,000 acres of good farmland  on 
Oahu will remain available for growing additional crops 
(42,000 acres - 12,000 acres).    
 
 
 
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
delivery costs, employment, and payroll as would occur at 
Koa Ridge Makai. 
88. Because of the replacement lands with a source of 
water and existing irrigation that have been made available 
and because Petitioner stopped charging Aloun Farms rent at Koa Ridge which saves Aloun Farms $129,000 annually, the 
Project is not anticipated to have a significant impact on 
the operation of Aloun Farms. However, some adjustments in 
varieties and cultivation practices might be required due 
to different agronomic conditions (e.g., soils, temperature, solar radiation, elevation and rainfall). 
Also, Aloun Farms will incur the cost of preparing the 
former pineapple field for farming vegetable crops. 
. . . . 
94. The contraction and closure of sugarcane and pineapple 
plantations have released farmland that can now be used for 
other crops. As of January 2010, over 177,000 acres 
remained available statewide for farming. 
95. On Oahu, over 15,000 acres of former plantation land 
remain available including approximately 2,500 acres in 
upper Kunia, approximately 8,500 acres on the North Shore, over 2,700 acres near Kahuku, and approximately 1,700 acres 
scattered throughout other parts of the island. The word 
“available” refers to land not being farmed. 
. . . . 
113. Reclassification and development of the Petition Area 
will not have an adverse impact on agricultural resources 
nor on actual or potential agricultural production in the 
vicinity of the Petition Area or in the City o r  State.  
There is sufficient land available on O ahu and in the State 
to accommodate the loss of land for the Project and to 
accommodate diversified agriculture.    
The LUC made the following Conclusions of Law relevant to 
this appeal: 
10    
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
1. Pursuant to HRS chapter 205 and the Commission rules 
under HAR chapter 15 -15, and upon consideration of the 
Commission decision -making criteria under HRS section 205 -
17, the Commission finds upon the clear preponderance of 
the evidence that the reclassification of Koa Ridge Makai, 
Increment 1, consisting of approximately 576.435 acres of 
land, situated at Waipi o, Island of O ahu, State of Hawai i, 
TMKs: 9-4- 06: portion of 1, portion of 2, portion of 3, 
portion of 5, 38, and portion of 39 and 9 -5-03: portion of 
1 and portion of 4, shown approximately on Exhibit “A” 
attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein, from 
the State Land Use Agricultural District to the State Land 
Use Urban District, and subject to the conditions stated in 
the Order below, conforms to the standards for establishing 
the boundaries of the State Land Use Urban District, is reasonable, not violative of HRS section 205 -2 and is 
consistent with the policies and criteria established pursuant to HRS sections 205 -16, 205-17, and 205A- 2.  
2. The Commission also finds upon the clear preponderance 
of the evidence that the reclassification of Castle & Cooke 
Waiawa, Increment 2, pursuant to the incremental 
districting under 
section HAR 15- 15-78, consisting of 
approximately 191.214 acres of land, situated at Waiawa, 
Island of O ahu, State of Hawai i, TMKs: 9 -4-06: portion of 
29 and portion of 31 and 9 -6-04: 21, shown approximately on 
Exhibit “A” attached hereto and incorporat ed by reference 
herein, from the State Land Use Agricultural District to 
the State Land Use Urban District, and subject to the conditions stated in the Order below, conforms to the 
standards for establishing the boundaries of the State Land 
Use Urban District, is reasonable, is not violative of HRS 
section 205 -2, and is consistent with the policies and 
criteria established pursuant to HRS sections 205 -16, 205-
17, and 205A -2. 
. . . . 
6. Article XI, Section 3, of the Hawai i State Constitution 
states the f ollowing in full: “The State shall conserve 
and protect agricultural lands, promote diversified 
agriculture, increase agricultural self -sufficiency and 
assure the availability of agriculturally suitable lands. The legislature shall provide standards and criteria to 
accomplish the foregoing. Lands identified by the State as important agricultural lands needed to fulfill the purposes 
above shall not be reclassified by the State or rezoned by 
its political subdivisions without meeting the standards 
and criteria established by the legislature and approved by 
a two-thirds vote of the body responsible for the 
reclassification or rezoning action.” 
7. HRS section 205 -41 declares that there is a compelling 
State interest in conserving the State’s agricultural lan d 
resource base and assuring the long -term availability of 
agricultural lands for agricultural use to achieve the

 The LUC’s Decision and Order reclassified the Petition 
lands from the state agricultural land use district to the state 
urban land use district, subject to preconditions that are not 
relevant on appeal.

purposes of Article XI, Section 3, of the Hawai i State 
Constitution. 
B. Circuit Court Appeal 
Appellants filed an agency appeal with the circuit court.  
Relevant 
to this appeal, the Appellants argued that the LUC’s 
decision and order violated HAR § 15-15-77(b)(6),5 which requires 
the LUC to “specifically consider” the following when 
reclassifying agricultural land: 
Lands in intensive agricultural use for two years prior to 
date of filing of a petition or lands with a high capacity 
for intensive agricultural use shall not be taken out of the agricultural district unless the commission finds 
either that the action: 
(A) Will not substantially impair actual or potential 
agricultural production in the vicinity of the subject 
property or in the county or State; or (B) Is reasonably necessary for urban growth. 
The Appellants focused on subsection (A), arguing, “Despite 
overwhelming and dispositive evidence to the contrary, the 
Findings conclude that there are sufficient alternative 
agricultural lands and that agriculture on Oahu will not be 
The Appellants also argued that the LUC’s decision and order violated 
HAR § 15- 15-77(a), which requires district boundary amendments to conform to 
the Hawai i State Plan.  The Appellants abandoned this issue upon transfer to 
this court, as this issue was not raised as a point of error in their Opening 
Brief, and was referenced for the first time in their Reply Brief. This 
argument has therefore been waived.  S ee Matter of Hawaiian Flour Mills, 
Inc., 76 Hawai i 1,14 n.5, 868 P.2d 419, 432 n.5 (1994) (citing Hawai i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4)).

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
harmed by the reclassification.” They argued that the LUC’s 
decision was “based on t he unsubstantiated assertion that there 
is a large amount of available farm land on Oahu and thus taking 
this proven and productive land out of production will not be 
harmful to agriculture on Oahu or in Hawaii in general.” 
Specifically, the Appellants contended that the replacement 
lands lack State funding for water infrastructure, and lack a 
track record of producing crops like those grown on the Petition 
lands. As to subsection (B), whether the reclassification was 
necessary for urban growth, the Appellants claimed in a footnote 
that “there was very unconvincing testimony of the need for an 
additional 5000 housing units in this location. . . .”  
 In its Answering Brief, Castle & Cooke counter-argued that 
the reclassification complied with HAR § 15-15-77(b)(6).    Castle 
& Cooke argued that the  LUC was provided with substantial 
evidence that the reclassification “will not substantially 
impair actual or potential agricultural production” and “is reasonably necessary for urban growth.”   As to the “agricult ural 
production” prong, Castle & Cooke pointed to Plasch’s testimony about the thousands of acres that had become available for 
diversified agriculture upon the contraction of plantation 
agriculture. Castle & Cooke also noted it had designated 679 
13

    
 
 
  
  
 
   
 
 As to the “urban growth” prong, Castle & Cooke argued that 
the LUC was provided with substantial evidence that the 
reclassification was necessary for urban growth from, inter 
alia, Bouslog, who testified about Central Oahu’s acute housing 
shortage for primary residents.   Castle & Cooke pointed out that 
the Appellants did not dispute Bouslog’s testimony or cross -
examine her during the LUC hearings.  They also failed to 
“provide any witness or documents to the LUC that would contradict the evidence presented during the hearings that the 
                                                           
  
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
acres as IAL in other parts of O ahu6 and provided its current 
tenant, Aloun Farms, with replacement land for its farming operations. To refute the Appellants’ suggestion that the 
replacement land lacks necessary water infrastructure, Castle & 
Cooke cited to Aloun Farms’ letter of support, that noted their 
replacement land “has productive soils, a reliable source of water and existing irrigation systems  which will support the 
cultivation of [their ] variety of crops. . . .” Thus, Castle & 
Cooke maintained, reclassification of the petition lands “would 
not substantially impair actual or potential agricultural 
production.” 
During the pendency of the Petition proceedings, Castle & Cooke 
successfully obtained LUC designation of this land as IAL through the farmer/ 
landowner- initiated IAL designation procedure set forth in HRS § 205 -44 
(Supp. 2005). This procedure is separate from the formal county -initiated 
IAL designation procedure set forth in HRS § 205 -47. 
14
 6    
 
 
  
 The LUC argued in its Answering Brief that the 
reclassification did not violate HRS §  15-15-77(b)(6), because 
(1) the Project area   is designated for urban development in the 
CO SCP; (2) there is an acute shortage of housing for primary 
residents on Oahu; (3)  and adequate replacement lands exist for 
agricultural tenants displaced by the project.   The LUC asserted 
that it did not “simply ignore” testimony that the lands had been in active cultivation, but “considered the specific 
replacement lands . . . as well  as other evidence concerning 
agriculture in Hawaii in general. . . .”     
 
 
 
 
 The circuit court issued its Decision and Order Denying and 
Dismissing Appellants the Sierra Club and Senator Clayton Hee’s *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
reclassification of the Petition lands is reasonably necessary 
for urban growth.” 
The circuit court held oral argument.  The circuit court 
asked the Appellants which particular findings of fact and 
conclusions of law they believed were in error, as their Opening 
Brief did not include that information; the Appellants viewed 
“the entire thing” as in error. Further into the oral argument, 
the Appellants’ attorney conceded, “We’re not challenging the 
expertise [of individuals who testified before the LUC] because 
[the LUC is] entitled to mak e credibility determinations.” 
After hearing argument from all of the parties, the circuit court dismissed the appeal an d affirmed the LUC’s decision. 
15
    
 
 
   
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
The circuit court therefore affirmed the LUC’s Findings of Fact 
and Conclusions of Law and Decision and Order and dismissed the 
appeal. The Appellants timely appealed, ultimately obtaining a 
transfer of the appeal from the ICA to this court.     
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Appeal Filed on July 20, 2012, on April 11, 2013. The circuit 
court made the following findings relevant to this appeal: 
7. The Court, in its review of all the Findings of 
Fact, finds that there is evidence as to the unmet housing 
needs and the availability of other suitable agricultural land and the criteria required under HRS § 205-17 and HAR § 
15-15-77.  The Court finds that the LUC D&O was not 
arbitrary and/or an abuse of discretion in that there was 
substantial, reliable, probative evidence to support its 
Findings of Fact. 
8. The Court finds that there was no challenge by 
Appellants as to the credibility or the expertise of the various witnesses that testified before the LUC. 
9. The Court therefore finds that the LUC did not 
violate HAR § 15-15-77. 
III. Standard of Review 
Review of a decision made by the circuit court upon its 
review of an agency’s decision is a secondary appeal. T he 
standard of review is one in which this court must 
determine whether the circuit court was right or wrong in 
its decision, applying the standards set forth in HRS §  91-
14(g) . . . to the agency’s decision.  
Dep’t  of Env. Servs.  v. Land Use Comm’n , 127 Hawai i 5, 12, 275 
P.3d 809, 816 (2012) (citation omitted).   An agency’s 
conclusions of law are reviewed de novo,  while an agency’s 
factual findings are reviewed for clear error.  Camara v. 
Agsalud, 67 Haw. 212, 216, 685 P.2d 794, 797 (1984).  
In order to  preserve the function of administrative 
agencies in discharging their delegated duties and the 
function of this court in reviewing agency determinations, 
a presumption of validity is accorded to decisions of 
administrative bodies acting within their sphere of 
expertise and one seeking to upset the order bears “the heavy burden of making a convincing showing that it is 
16
    
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
 On the issue of whether the reclassification violated HAR  
§ 15-15-77(b)(6), the parties largely repeat, before  this court, 
the arguments made to the circuit court, and those arguments 
will not be repeated. Before reaching the merits of the issue, 
we must address the lack of specificity in Appellants’ challenge 
to the LUC’s decision and order. Before the circuit court and 
this court, the Appellants did not designate any  particular 
findings of fact as clearly erroneous. It was the Appellants’ 
burden, however, to point out specifically which findings of 
fact and conclusions of law were erroneous.  MPM Hawaiian, Inc. 
v. Amigos, Inc., 63 Haw. 485, 486, 630 P.2d 1075, 1077 (1981)  
(per curiam) (Findings of fact “are presumed to be correct, and appellant bears the burden of pointing out specifically where 
they are erroneous.”)   It should not be this court’s 
responsibility to search the record in this case for evidence 
supporting the LUC’s factual findings. See  Campbell v. DePonte, 
57 Haw. 510, 513, 559 P.2d 739, 741 (1977) (“An appellant’s mere 
challenge of a finding does not cas[t] the onus of justifying it 
on this court. The party seeking to overthrow findings has the *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
invalid because it is unjust and unreasonable in its 
consequences.” 
In re Hawaii Elec. Light Co., 60 Haw. 625, 630, 594 P.2d 612, 
617 (1979) (citations omitted). 
IV. 	Substantial Evidence Supported the LUC’s Findings That 
the Reclassification Complied with HAR § 15-15-77(b)(6). 
17
    
 
 
   
  
 
 
 
  We remind counsel that Hawai i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(“HRAP”) Rule 28(b)(4)(C) (2010) requires that an appellant’s 
opening brief concisely state points of error, and, “when the 
point involves a finding or conclusion of the . . . agency, 
either a quotation of the finding or conclusion urged as error 
or reference to appended findings and conclusions. . . .” This *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
burden of pointing out specifically wherein the findings are 
clearly erroneous.”) (citation omitted).  
It was clear in this case that the entire decision and 
order was not at issue in this appeal.  The Appellants focused 
on the agriculture and urban growth findings, not the 
introductory findings describing procedural matters, the 
petition area, the proposal for reclassification, Castle & 
Cooke’s financial capa bility to undertake the project, or State 
and City plans; or the hundreds of other findings regarding 
impacts upon the economy, society, flora, fauna, archaeological, 
historical, cultural, groundwater and surface water, parks and 
recreation, and scenic resources; or noise, air quality, highway 
and roadway facilities, water service, wastewater disposal, 
drainage, solid waste disposal, schools, police and fire 
protection, emergency/medical services, civil defense, 
electricity and telephone service, energy conservation, 
commitment of state funds and resources, and conformance with State and City land use management plans.   
18
    
 
 
  
 The Appellants allege that the LUC improperly weighed the 
evidence before it in determining that the reclassification of 
the Petition lands would not substantially impair agricultural 
production and was reasonably necessary for urban growth. A 
court reviewing an agency’s findings of fact, however must 
“decline to consider the weight of the evidence to ascertain 
whether it weighs in favor of the administrative findings, or   
. . . review the agency’s findings of fact by passing upon the 
credibility of witnesses or conflicts in testimony, especially *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
court has looked past violations of HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) to reach 
the merits of a case where issues of great importance are at 
stake. See, e.g., Morgan v. Planning Dep’t , 104 Hawai i 173, 
181, 86 P.3d 982, 990 (2004) (“[B]ecause the issues raised in the instant case are of great importance [i.e., the Hawai i 
constitution’s recognition of the significance of conserving and 
protecting Hawaii’s natural beauty and natural resources], we 
address the merits of the issues raised . . . notwithstanding 
the [Appellants’] technical violation of HRAP Rule 28(b)(4).”)  
In this case, due to the public interest in the proposed Koa  
Ridge development, we choose to construe Appellants’ appeal as challenging the findings of fact reproduced in Section II.A.4 of 
this opinion. Even given this latitude, however, the Appellants 
fail to carry their burden of showing why the LUC’s decision and 
order should not be affirmed.   
19
    
 
 
  As such, the resolution of this issue on appeal depends on 
whether the witnesses the LUC credited provided substantial 
evidence to support the LUC’s findings of fact. Substantial 
evidence is “credible evidence which is of sufficient quality 
and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.” 
In Re Water Use Permit Applications,  94 
Hawaii 97, 119, 9 P.3d 409, 431 (2000). In this case, the 
witness testimony the LUC credited (summarized in Sections 
II.A.3.a, b, and c of this opinion) provided substantial 
evidence to support its findings.   Therefore, the 
reclassification satisfied the requirements of HAR § 15-15-77(b)(6).       
   
 
   
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
the findings of an expert agency dealing with a specialized 
field.” Application of Hawaiian Elec. Co.,  81 Hawai i 459, 465, 
918 P.2d 561, 567 (1996). Appellants’ attorney acknowledged as 
much before the circuit court, when he admitted, “We’re not 
challenging the expertise [of individuals who testified before the LUC] because [the LUC is] entitled to make credibility 
determinations.”    
V.
	 The LUC’s Decision and Order Omits a Conclusion that the 
Preponderance of the Evidence Shows that the 
Reclassification Does Not Violate Part III of Chapter 205, but the Omission is Harmless. 
HRS § 205-4(h) (Supp. 2005) requires the LUC to approve a 
proposed boundary amendment only after concluding, by a 
20
    
 
 
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
preponderance of the evidence, that it is “reasonable, not 
violative of section 205-2 [governing districting and  
classification of lands]  and part III of this chapter   [governing 
Important Agricultural Lands], and consistent with the policies 
and criteria established pursuant to sections 205-16 [compliance 
with the Hawai i State Plan] and 205-17  [listing other LUC 
decision-making criteria] .” (Emphasis added). HAR § 15-15-77 
further requires that any approved boundary amendment be 
consistent with HRS § 205A-2 (Hawaii’s Coastal Zone Management 
Program). In this case, in Conclusions of Law 1 and 2, the LUC 
concluded, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the 
reclassification of the Koa Ridge and Waiawa lands were “reasonable, not violative of HRS section 205 -2 and . . . 
consistent with the policies and criteria established pursuant to HRS sections 205-16, 205-17, and 205A-2.” Conclusions  of Law 
1 and 2 are erroneous because they omit any conclusion regarding part III of HRS Chapter 205. Although the Appellants did not 
challenge these conclusions of law, this court may freely review 
them.  Ka Pa akai O Ka Aina v. Land Use Comm’n , 94 Hawai i 31, 41, 
7 P.3d 1068, 1078 (2000).    
Under the circumstances of this case, however, this error 
is harmless because the LUC made separate 
conclusions to show 
that it recognized the significance of important agricultural 
21
    
 
 
  
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
lands under the Hawai i State Constitution and Part III of  
Chapter 205:  
6. Article XI, Section 3, of the Hawai i State Constitution 
states the following in full: “ The State shall conserve 
and protect agricultural lands, promote diversified 
agriculture, increase agricultural self- sufficiency and 
assure the availability of agriculturally suitable lands. 
The legislature shall provide standards and criteria to 
accomplish the foregoing. Lands identified by the State as 
important agricultural lands needed to fulfill the purposes 
above shall not be reclassified by the State or rezoned by 
its political subdivisions without meeting the standards and criteria established by the legislature and approved by 
a two-thirds vote of the body responsible for the 
reclassification or rezoning acti on.” 
7. HRS section 205 -41 [located in Part III of Chapter 205] 
declares that there is a compelling State interest in 
conserving the State’s agricultural land resource base and 
assuring the long -term availability of agricultural lands 
for agricultural use to achieve the purposes of Article XI, 
Section 3, of the Hawai i State Constitution.  
 
Again, we note that the formal county-initiated IAL designation 
process has not concluded. See  
http://mapoahuagland.com/about/faq/  (last visited Apr. 5, 2016).  
Further, the City & County of Honolulu has no intention of identifying the Project lands as IAL because they are included 
in county plans calling for urban development. See id.    Under 
HRS § 205-47(a), “lands that have been designated, through the state land use, zoning, or county planning process, for urban 
use by the State or county ”  are not subject to county 
identification as IALs. Thus, under the facts of this case, reclassification woul d not be “violative of part III” because 
this particular parcel was not, and would not be, identified as IAL.  We believe these conclusions of law show that the LUC 
22

    
 
 
  
 The LUC in this case properly reclassified Castle & Cooke’s 
property from the agricultural land use district to the urban 
land use district. Substantial evidence supported the LUC’s 
findings that the reclassification satisfied HAR § 15-15-
77(b)(6).  The LUC’s error in omitting a conclusion of law that 
the reclassification was not violative of Part III of Chapter 
205, by a preponderance of the evidence, was harmless. We 
therefore affirm th e circuit court’s decision and order , which 
affirmed the LUC’s decision and order and dismissed the 
Appellants’ appeal.  
   
 
  
  
  
   
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
complied with Part III of Chapter 205 to the extent that it 
could, given the unfinished state of the formal county IAL 
designation process.
