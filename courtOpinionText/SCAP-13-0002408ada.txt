I. Introduction 
Petitioner/Intervenor/Cross-Appellant-Appellant 
Friends of Makakilo (“Friends” or “FOM”), a 501(c)(4) non -profit 
corporation, appeals from the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit’s Final Judgment dated June 26, 2013, and filed June 27, 
2013, which affirmed its November 9, 2013 Order dismissing FOM’s 
“cross-appeal”1 as untimely. Friends filed an Application for 
Transfer (“Application”) with the Court on April 2, 2014. The 
Court has accepted FOM’s appeal as a discretionary transfer 
under Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 602 -58 (Supp. 2013).    
FOM’s appeal poses a question of first impression: 
when must a party that seeks judicial review of an 
administrative decision in the form of a cross-appeal file 
notice of its cross-appeal in circuit court?  In brief, Friends 
suggests that cross-appeals may be filed within the deadlines 
set forth in Rule 4.1(b) of the Hawai ʻi Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (“HRAP”),2 i.e., within fourteen days after the initial 
notice of appeal is served on the cross-appellant, or within the 
time prescribed for filing the notice of appeal, whichever is 
later. Respondents/Appellees-Appellees D.R. Horton-Schuler

Hawaiʻi (“State”), and the Land Use Commission (“LUC”) assert 
that there is no fourteen-day extension for the filing of cross-
appeals, as all requests for judicial review must be filed within thirty days after service of the certified copy of the 
agency’s final decision and order, as provided for in HRS § 91 -
14(b) (Supp. 2010). 
II. Background 
A. Procedural History 
The at-issue “cross -appeal” aris es from an LUC 
contested case hearing, Docket Number A06-771.  In January 2007, Horton-Schuler petitioned the LUC to reclassify certain lands in 
ʻEwa District, Oʻ ahu from agricultural to urban use (“Ho ʻopili 
lands” or “Hoʻ opili Development”). Horton-Schuler later amended 
its petition in September 2008. In February 2009, the LUC 
permitted Friends to intervene, and in September 2009, the LUC 
granted FOM’s motion to declare the petition deficient, with 
leave to Horton-Schuler to amend.  Horton-Schuler filed 
subsequent amendments to its petition in May and July 2011. In September 2011, the Sierra Club and Senator Clayton Hee were 
granted intervenor status. The LUC continued a hearing on the 
revised petition on several discrete days from October 2011 to 
March 2012, with oral arguments held in May and June 2012.  In 
its June 21, 2012 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and 
Decision and Order (“Decision”), the LUC granted Horton -

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Schuler’s petition to reclassify t he Hoʻopili lands subject to 
certain conditions.3 A copy of the LUC’s Decision was delivered 
to Friends on June 23, 2012. 
On July 20, 2012, Senator Hee and the Sierra Club 
filed a notice of appeal with the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit, requesting judicial review of the Decision (“Sierra 
Club appeal” or “Sierra Club notice of appeal”). On August 2, 
2012, Friends filed a “Notice of Cross Appeal to Circuit Court.” 
On August 23 and 24, 2012, the LUC and Horton-Schuler 
respectively filed motions to dismiss FOM’s “cross-appeal.”4 
Oral argument on the motions was held on October 9, 
2012. By an order dated November 9, 2012 (“Order”), the circuit court held, pursuant to HRS § 91-14, that: (a) FOM’s “cross -
appeal” was not allowed by law because aggrieved parties, as 
defined in HRS § 91-14, have a right to appeal an agency 
decision, but not a right to cross-appeal, and (b) it is 
undisputed that FOM’s “cross-appeal,” when viewed simply as a 
request for judicial review, was untimely. The circuit court further held that even if cross-appeals of agency decisions were permitted and FOM’s “cross-appeal” was deemed timely, (1) the 
3 On June 27, 2012, the LUC issued errata to its Decision to correct a 
typographical error. A copy of the errata was delivered to Friends on June 
29, 2012. None of the parties assert that the errata affect our 
consideration of the issues presented. 
4 The Office of Planning, State of Hawai ʻi joined both motions to dismiss, and 
Horton- Schuler joined the LUC’s motion.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
content of the “cross -appeal” exceeded the scope of FOM’s 
limited intervention in the proceedings before the LUC, and (2) 
Friends lacked standing to appeal as an “aggrieved person.” 
Accordingly, the circuit court dismissed FOM’s “cross-appeal ” 
with prejudice, and affirmed its Order by Final Judgment filed June 27, 2013. 
B. Points of Error 
In its opening brief, Friends identifies eight points 
of error. 
Point one contends the circuit court erred when it 
concluded that, pursuant to HRS § 91-14, an aggrieved party in a 
contested case before the LUC “[does] not [have] the right to 
cross-appeal.” 
Points two through five repeat a single reason why the 
circuit court erred in concluding that FOM’s “cross -appeal” was 
untimely: “[T]he timely appeal by the Sie rra Club/Hee divested 
the LUC of jurisdiction and cross-appeals were appropriate and allowed by Rule 4.1, H.R.A.P. thereby extending the deadline for 
a cross appeal to 14 days after the original appeal deadline of 
30 days.” 
Points six and seven attack the circuit court’s 
alternative rulings, which are based on the assumption that 
FOM’s “cross-appeal” was timely and appropriately filed. 
5
         
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Lastly, in point eight, it appears Friends contends 
that because the November 9, 2012 Order dismissed Friends from 
the case, final judgment should not have been entered against it 
pursuant to that Order. “It is Friends’ belief that due process 
would prohibit ruling on a party no longer a party to a case.” 
III.  Standards of Review 
A. Jurisdiction 
The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law 
that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard. 
Questions regarding subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at 
any stage of an action.  When reviewing a case where the circuit 
court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, the appellate court 
retains jurisdiction, not on the merits, but for the purpose of 
correcting the error in jurisdiction. A judgment rendered by a 
circuit court without subject matter jurisdiction is void. 
Lingle v. Haw. Gov’t Employees Ass’n, 107 Hawai ʻi 178, 183, 111 
P.3d 587, 591 (2005) (citation and quotation marks omitted). 
B. Statutory Interpretation 
“Statutory interpretation is a question of law 
reviewable de novo.” Kaleikini v. Yoshioka, 128 Hawaiʻ i 53, 6 7, 
283 P.3d 60, 74 (2012) (citation omitted).  
IV.  
Discussion 
The right to appeal is purely statutory and exists 
only when jurisdiction is given by some constitutional or

statutory provision. Lingle, 107 Hawai ʻi at 184, 111 P.3d at 593 
(quotation marks omitted) (citing Burke v. Cnty. of Maui, 95 
Hawaiʻi 288, 289, 22 P.3d 84, 85 (2001); Oppenheimer v. AIG Haw. 
Ins. Co., 77 Hawaiʻ i 88, 91, 881 P.2d 1234, 1237 (1994); Chambers 
v. Leavey, 60 Haw. 52, 57, 587 P.2d 807, 810 (1978)).  
Jurisdiction is conferred upon circuit courts to review 
administrative decisions by HRS § 91-14, which provides in part: 
(a) Any person aggrieved by a final decision and order in a 
contested case . . . is entitled to judicial review thereof under 
this chapter; but nothing in this section shall be deemed to 
prevent resort to other means of review, redress, relief, or 
trial de novo, including the right of trial by jury, provided by law. . . . 
(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, proceedings for review 
shall be instituted in the circuit court . . . within thirty days 
after service of the certified copy of the final decision and order of the agency pursuant to rule of court . . . . The court 
in its discretion may permit other interested persons to 
intervene. 
HRS § 91-14. 
It is uncontested that Friends did not file its 
“cross-appeal” within “thirty days after service of the 
certified copy of the final decision and order of the agency,” 
as required by HRS § 91-14(b).   Nevertheless, Friends contends 
that the deadline set forth in HRS § 91  -14(b) does not apply to 
5 its “cross-appeal”; rather, court rules govern.   Specifically, 
Friends asserts: (1)  its “cross-appeal” was timely filed because 
Friends asserts the filing of the Sierra Club notice of appeal divested the 
LUC of jurisdiction, but fails to explain why it therefore follows that the 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure govern its “cross -appeal” in circuit 
court.

Rule 4.1 of the Hawai ʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure, which 
permits a party to file a cross-appeal within fourteen days of 
that party’s receipt of another party’s timely filed notice of appeal, applies to its “cross -appeal,”
6 and (2) nothing in HRS § 
91-14 prohibits the filing of cross-appeals of agency decisions to circuit court. 
A. 	HRS § 91-14 Permits the Filing of Cross-Appeals of Agency 
    Decisions within the Time Allowed in HRS § 91-14(b) 
As a preliminary matter, the term “cross -
appeal” 
should be defined: where multiple requests for judicial review 
are initiated, “the appeal of each is called a ‘cross -appeal’ as 
regards that of the other[s].” Black’s Law Dictionary  124 (4th 
ed. 1957). In other words, cross-appeals exist whenever more 
than one party requests judicial review of the same decision.  
The plain language of HRS 
§ 91-14(a) shows the Hawai ʻi 
Legislature contemplated that multiple requests for review of a 
  HRAP Rule 4.1 provides: 
(a) Right of cross -appeal. 
(1) If a timely notice of appeal is filed by a party, any 
other party may, if allowed by law, file a cross -appeal. 
(2) In civil cases involving multiple -party plaintiffs or 
defendants, if one party files a timely notice of appeal, any 
other party, whether on the same or opposite side as the party 
first appealing, may file a notice of cross -appeal. 
(3) In criminal cases, the state or the defendant may file 
a cross- appeal within the time and under the circumstances 
permitted by this rule if the appeal is otherwise allowed by law. 
(b) Manner and time of filing. 
(1) A notice of cross -appeal shall be filed within 14 days 
after the notice of appeal is served on the cross -appellant, or 
within the time prescribed for filing the notice of appeal, 
whichever is later. . . . 
HRAP Rule 4.1.

single decision and order may be initiated.  See HRS § 91-14 
(“Any person aggrieved . . . is entitled to judicial review     
. . . .” (emphasis added)) ; Bowers v. Alamo Rent-A-Car, Inc., 88 
Hawai
ʻi 274, 277, 965 P.2d 1274, 1277 (1998) (“ The starting point 
in statutory construction is to determine the legislative intent 
from the language of the stat ute itself.” (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted)). Moreover, the Court has previously 
heard matters where multiple parties request judicial review of 
the same agency decision without sua sponte  addressing the issue 
of jurisdiction. See, e.g. , 
Ka Paʻakai O Ka ʻaina v. Land Use 
Comm’n, 94 Hawaiʻ i 31, 34, 39, 7 P.3d 1068, 1071, 1076 (2000) 
(noting that four distinct parties each filed separate timely agency appeals from the LUC’s order to the Circuit C ourt of the 
Third Circuit, and addressing the appeals of the circuit court decision lodged by two of those parties); see also Bacon v. 
Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127, 1129 (1986) (“ When we 
perceive a jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must, sua 
sponte, dismiss that appeal.” (quoting Familian Nw., Inc. v. 
Cent. Pac. Boiler & Piping, Ltd., 68 Haw. 368, 369, 714 P.2d 936, 937 (1986)) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Thus, HRS 
§ 91-14 specifically permits the filing of cross-appeals in 
circumstances where multiple parties request judicial review of 
an agency decision within the thirty-day window provided in HRS 
§ 91-14(b). 
9
         
 
 
                      
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The circuit court’s Order might be read to be contrary 
to this, as the court stated : “Pursuant to [HRS] § 91 -14, an 
aggrieved party to the proceedings below before the Land Use 
Commission has the right of appeal to the circuit court, but not 
the right to cross-appeal. . . .  Haw. Rev. Stat. § 91-14[]     
. . . does not provide for cross-appeals . . . .”   However, a 
careful examination of the Order reveals that the court was not 
concerned with whether multiple aggrieved parties are permitted 
to appeal the same agency decision, or whether aggrieved parties 
are denied a right to request judicial review of an agency 
7 decision if they are not first to file.   Indeed, had Friends 
filed its “Notice of Cross Appeal” within the thirty -day window 
8 provided in HRS § 91-14(b), timeliness would not be an issue.   
Rather, the circuit court was concerned with whether HRS § 91-14 
specifically addresses the right to “cross -appeal” according to 
the procedure described in Rule 4.1 of Hawai ʻi Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (or a similar procedure that provides additional time 
for the filing of a cross-appeal beyond the thirty-day window of 
HRS § 91-14(b)).  The circuit court correctly observed, that by the statute’s plain language, it does not.  
7 During oral argument in discussing Ka Paʻ akai O Ka ʻaina, 94 Hawaiʻ i 31, the 
circuit court acknowledged that multiple parties may request judicial review 
of the same agency decision. 
8  See supra note 7.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Yet, even if the plain language of a statute is clear, 
this court can nevertheless consider legislative history to 
ensure its interpretation of the statute does not produce an 
absurd result contrary to legislative intent.  See Survivors of  
Medeiros v. Maui Land & Pineapple Co. , 66 Haw. 290, 297, 660 
P.2d 1316, 1321 (1983)  (observing that the plain language rule 
does not preclude this court from examining the leg
islative 
history to “adequately discern the underlying policy which the legislature seeks to promulgate and . . . to determine if a 
literal construction would produce an absurd or unjust result, 
inconsistent with the policies of the statute”).   Accordingly, 
the following sections explore whether, despite the plain language of HRS § 91-14, the legislature intended to allow an 
extension of time to file cross-appeals in the manner described 
in HRAP Rule 4.1. 
B. 	HRS § 91-14 Does Not Permit 
the Filing of Cross-Appeals of 
    Agency Decisions Outside the Time Allowed in HRS § 91-14(b) 
1. Rule 72 of the Hawai ʻi Rules of Civil Procedure, Not 
Rule 4.1 of the Hawai ʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure, 
Applies to FOM’s “Cross-Appeal.” 
As a preliminary matter, we observe that 
HRAP Rule 
4.1(a) appears to confer a “right” to cross -appeal in certain 
circumstances. See HRAP Rule 4.1(a) (titling the provision as 
“Right of cross
-appeal”); Haw. Const. art. VI, § 7 (stating that 
rules relating to “process, practice, procedure, and appeals” 
11
         
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
promulgated by the Supreme Court have the “force and effect of 
law”); Cresencia v. Kim , 85 Hawaiʻ i 334, 335, 944 P.2d 1277, 1278 
(1997) (“The interpretation of a rule promulgated by the courts 
involves principles of statutory construction.” (citation 
omitted)). 
Nevertheless, there is no need to comment on whether 
a “right” to cross-appeal is bestowed by HRAP Rule 4.1, as the 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure do not apply to a circuit 
court’s review of admi nistrative decisions and orders. See HRAP 
Rule 1(a) 
(“Scope of Rules. These rules govern all proceedings 
in the Hawaiʻ i appellate courts except as otherwise provided by 
statute, Rules of the Supreme Court, or Rules of the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals.” (emphasis added)); Rule 2.1 
(“‘[A]ppellate court(s)’ or ‘Hawai ʻi appellate court(s)’ mean(s) 
the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court and the Hawai ʻi Intermediate Court of 
Appeals, collectively and individually, but does not include the land or tax appeal courts[.]”). 
Although a circuit court might assume an appellate 
role when reviewing administrative decisions, it is not an  
“appellate court” as that term is used in the HRAP, and 
therefore the HRAP —  including Rule 4.1 —  do not apply to it. 
Indeed, when the HRAP were first promulgated and adopted in  
1984, Rules 73 through 76 of the Hawai ʻi Rules of Civil Procedure 
(“HRCP”) (each relating to appeals to the Supreme Court)  were 
deleted from the HRCP because they were addressed by the new

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HRAP. HRCP Rule 72, “Appeal to a Circuit Court,” on the other 
hand, remained intact.  See Order Adopting Hawaii Rules of 
Appellate Procedure and Superseding Certain Other Rules (Apr. 
16, 1984). Simply put, by its plain language and history, the 
HRAP do not, nor were they ever intended to, address requests 
for judicial review of administrative decisions submitted to 
circuit courts; instead, the HRCP are the source of relevant 
rules. See  Cresencia , 85 Hawaiʻ i at 335, 944 P.2d at 1278; 
Bowers
, 88 Hawaiʻ i at 277, 965 P.2d at 1277 (“A rational, 
sensible and practicable interpretation [of a statute] is 
preferred to one which is unreasonable or impracticable.” 
(quoting State v. Lobendahn , 71 Haw. 111, 112, 784 P.2d 872, 873 
(1989)) (internal quotation marks omitted) (brackets in 
original)).   
The adoption of HRAP 
Rule 4.1 in 19999 and subsequent 
amendments do not alter this arrangement. Tellingly, Rule 4.1 
largely mirrors former HRCP Rule 73. Compare HRAP Rule 4.1(a), 
(b) (“If a timely notice of appeal is filed by a party, a ny 
other party may, if allowed by law, file a cross-appeal. . . .  
A notice of cross-appeal shall be filed within 14 days after the 
notice of appeal is served on the cross-appellant, or within the 
time prescribed for filing the notice of appeal, whichever is 
Effective January 1, 2000. See Order Amending the Hawai ʻi Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (Dec. 6, 1999).

later.”), with HRCP Rule 73(a)(2) (1972) (“[I]f a timely notice 
of appeal is filed by a party, any other party may file a notice 
of appeal within 14 days of the date on which the first notice 
of appeal was filed, or within the time otherwise herein 
prescribed, whichever period last expires.”). HRCP Rule 72 
(2012), the relevant portions of which have not changed since 
1972 — prior to the enactment of the HRAP — lacks language 
similar to former HRCP Rule 73 or HRAP Rule 4.1.  Thus, when 
HRCP Rule 72 (appeals to a circuit court) is read together with 
former HRCP Rule 73 (appeals to the Supreme Court), it is 
evident that a fourteen-day cross-appeal provision was 
purposefully excluded from HRCP Rule 72.  This court’s clear 
intent restricting the scope of HRCP Rule 72 is unchanged by the 
subsequent adoption of HRAP Rule 4.1. 
Friends suggests that application of Rule 72 
nevertheless permits the filing of cross-appeals.  According to 
Friends, because HRCP Rule 72(e) requires the statement of the case filed by an appellant be treated by the court “as near as 
may be[] as an original complaint, ” HRCP Rule 72(e),
10 it 
Statement of case . The appellant shall file in the circuit court 
concurrently with the filing of appellant’ s designation, a short 
and plain statement of the case and a prayer for relief. 
Certified copies of such statement shall be served forthwith upon 
every appellee. The statement shall be treated, as near as may 
be, as an original complaint and the provision of these rules respecting motions and answers in response thereto shall apply. 
HRCP Rule 72(e).

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
therefore argues analogous treatment should be extended to the 
rest of the case so as to permit the filing of cross-appeals in 
the same manner as cross- or counter-claims. Nothing in HRCP 
Rule 72(e) allows such an extension. The focus of the rule is, 
as designated by its title, confined to (1) mandating the filing 
of a statement of the case together with a notice of appeal, and 
(2) applying the Hawai ʻi Rules of Civil Procedure with respect 
only to motions and answers — there is no mention of cross-
appeals — that are filed in response to the statement.11 Friends 
fails to identify any support for a contrary interpretation. 
Thus, the application of HRCP Rule 72 to FOM’s “cross -appeal” 
does not give it the relief it seeks. 
2.	 The Legislature Intended HRS § 91-14 to Conform with 
HRCP Rule 72. 
The limited scope of HRCP Rule 72 bears on a proper 
interpretation of HRS § 91-14.  The Hawai ʻi Administrative 
Procedure Act (“HAPA” or “Hawaiʻ i APA”), which includes HRS § 91-
14, was enacted in 1961 and modeled after a 1959 draft of the 
National Conference of Commissioners’ Model State Administrative 
11  Friends also notes that HRCP Rule 81(e) (2006) requires that, except as 
otherwise provided in Rule 72, the Hawai ʻi Rules of Civil Procedure apply to 
all proceedings in circuit court, including certain administrative appeals 
such as the one here. However, Friends fails to identify which rule of civil

Procedure Act (“1959 Draft”).12 H. 1-8, Gen. Sess., at 654 
(Hawaiʻi 1961). The legislature intentionally deviated from the 
1959 Draft with respect to Section 91- 14(b) in order to “conform 
to the procedure provided in the Hawaii Rules of Civil 
Procedure. . . .” Id. at 660.  Specifically, the legislature 
required that, “[e]xcept as otherwise provided herein, proceedings for review shall be instituted in the circuit court 
. . . pursuant to the provisions of the Hawaii rules of civil procedure . . . .” HRS § 91 -14(b) (1961) (emphasis added).

language contained in the statute itself. And we must read

appeals “instituted in the circuit court,” HRCP Rule 72 — not 
former HRCP Rule 73 — and its accompanying intentional lack of a 
provision for an extension of time to file a cross-appeal.  A 
review of the legislative histories for post-1961 amendments to 
HRS § 91-14 does not provide reason to alter this interpretation 
of the legislature’s intent. 
3.	 Another State Has Concluded That in the Absence of a 
Specific Statutory Provision, “Cross -Appeals” of 
Administrative Decisions Are Subject to the Same Filing 
Deadlines as the Initial Appeal. 
Although it may be a matter of first impression for 
this court whether a cross-appeal of an administrative decision 
may be timely filed beyond the statutory deadline to institute 
administrative “proceedings for review,” one other court has 
already addressed the issue: 
Courts to have considered similar statutory schemes [as that 
presented in Hawai ʻi’s APA] have concluded that in the absence of 
a provision expressly extending the time for filing a cross-
petition, any aggrieved party seeking judicial review of an 
administrative decision must file a separate, timely petition for 
review. In other words, where another deadline is not specified, a cross- petition is subject to the same filing deadline as the 
original petition.  
Ahmann v. Corr. Ctr. Lincoln, 755 N.W. 3d 608, 611 (Neb. 2008); 
see also  id. 
at 611 nn.11, 12 (cases cited). 
The circumstances in Nebraska are particularly 
insightful. Up until 2008, the timing provision in Nebraska’s 
APA read: “Proceedings for review shall be instituted by filing 
a petition in the district court of the county where the action 
17

is taken within thirty days after the service of the final 
decision by the agency. . . .” Neb. Rev. Stat. § 84 -917(2)(a) 
(2008). The statute’s similarity to HRS § 91 -14 is unsurprising 
as both the Hawai
ʻi APA and Nebraska APA amount to “substantial 
adoption[s] of the major provisions of the Revised 1961 Model 
State Administrative Procedure Act.” 15 Uniform Laws Annotated  
180, 181 (Master ed. 
2000).14 In reviewing the provision, the 
Nebraska Supreme Court held: “[B]ecause the [Nebraska] APA makes 
no mention of an extended or different deadline for filing a 
cross-petition . . . . the plain language of the APA requires 
that the same deadline be applied to any party seeking judicial 
review of an administrative decision.” Ahmann, 755 N.W.2d at 
612 (footnote omitted). 
In this case, HRS § 91-14(b)’ s similar omission of 
extended or different deadlines to file a cross-appeal indicates 
that all parties seeking review in the circuit court must 
institute proceedings in the circuit court within thirty days 
after service of the certified copy of the agency’ s final 
decision and order. 
14 The section regarding the deadline for requesting judicial review in the 
various iterations of the Model State Administrative Procedure Act has gone 
substantively unchanged. Compare Model State Admin. Proc. Act   § 12, 9C 
U.L.A.
 179 (1957) (1946 Act), with Nat’l Conference of Comm’rs on Unif. State 
Laws, Revision of the Model State Admin. Proc. Act § 14 (1960) (reflecting 
recommendations made by committee members to the 1959 Draft), and 
Unif. Law 
Comm’rs Model State Admin. Proc. Act (1961) §  15, 15A U.L.A. 11 (2000).

4. 	The Legislature, Not the Court, Should Balanc e Parties’ 
Competing Interests. 
Although there may be prudential reasons for applying 
the same deadline to all requests for judicial review,15 such a 
rule may spark the filing of preemptive appeals, thereby wasting 
client and court resources. Friends makes a similar argument: 
“If the silence of Rule 72 on cross appeals is interpreted as a 
denial of the right to file a cross appeal, the result is that 
every party in a contested case must file an appeal to protect 
itself in case another party files an appeal and does not 
include them as a party. ” FOM’s position, however, is based on 
an unfounded legal conclusion that an appellant’s omission of a party from the appeal’s case caption or service list precludes 
the “omitted” party from participating in the appeal. 
In any event, it is within the purview of the 
legislature, not the court, to re-examine and address these competing interests. For example, after the Nebraska Supreme 
Court’s ruling in Ahmann , the Nebraska Legislature revised its 
APA to expressly “vest in a responding party of record the right to a cross-appeal against any other party of record,” and 
provide the respondent with “thirty days after being served with 
15 See, e.g., Ahmann, 755 N.W. 3d at 611– 12 (“Applying the same deadline for 
petitions and cross- petitions serves to ensure that all the parties affected 
by an administrative decision are aware of any challenge to that decision and 
receive prompt notice of the issues presented for judicial review.”).

the summons and petition for review” to serve its cross -appeal.  
Neb. Rev. Stat. § 84-917(2)(a) (2009).       
Unless the legislature enacts a similar provision, 
however, for the reasons already discussed, an “aggrieved 
person” seeking judicial review of an administrative decision 
under the Hawaiʻ i APA must institute review proceedings within 
thirty days after service of the final decision and order, as 
provided in HRS § 91-14. Accordingly, the circuit court did not 
err when it concluded Friends untimely filed its “cross-appeal.” 
C. 	As FOM’s “Cross -Appeal” Was Untimely Filed, the Remaining 
Points of Error Need Not Be Reached by the Court 
Points of error six and seven concern the circuit 
court’s alternative rulings that are contingent on a timely 
filed “cross-appeal.” As we affirm the circuit court’ s 
dismissal of FOM’s “cross-appeal” as untimely, we need not, and do not, reach these points of error. 
Further, Friends concedes that the issue raised in 
point of error eight is relevant only “if the case is reversed.” As we affirm the circu it court’s dismissal of FOM’s “cross -
appeal,” we need not reach point eight.
