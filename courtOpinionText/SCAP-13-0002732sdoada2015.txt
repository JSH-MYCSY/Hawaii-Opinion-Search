SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.,
and Circuit Judge Alm, in place of Wilson, J., recused)
 
This appeal concerns the arbitrability of certain
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“purchase-based” claims pursuant to an arbitration provision
 
contained in the Declaration of Condominium Property Regime of
 
Kapalua Bay Condominium. The questions presented in the
 
underlying appeal are controlled by our recent decision in
 
Narayan v. Marriott (Narayan I), No. SCWC-12-819, at 16 (Hawai' i 
June 3, 2015) (pub. op.), where we held “that the arbitration 
provision contained in the condominium declaration is 
unenforceable because the terms of the various condominium 
documents are ambiguous with respect to the Homeowners’ intent to 
arbitrate.” 
Pursuant to our analysis in Narayan I, the circuit
 
court’s July 12, 2013 order denying Defendants the Ritz-Carlton
 
Hotel Company, L.L.C., the Ritz-Carlton Development Co., Inc.,
 
Marriott International, Inc., Marriott Vacations Worldwide
 
Corporation, Marriott Ownership Resorts, Inc., the Ritz-Carlton
 
Management Company, L.L.C., Marriott Two Flags, LP, and MH
 
Kapalua Venture, LLC’s motion to compel arbitration is affirmed.
