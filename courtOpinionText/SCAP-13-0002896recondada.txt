1 As stated by the Director of Taxation in its answering brief 
regarding the General Excise Tax claims, “[S]tatutory construction questions
pertaining to regulation of businesses are separate from questions pertaining
to whether their revenues should be taxed.” (Citing Med. Underwriters of
Cal., 115 Hawaiʻ i at 194- 95, 166 P.3d at 367- 68). We further note that the 
Director of Taxation contended that “the OTCs improperly rel[ied]” upon the 
same definition of “travel agency” that the Director of Taxation directs thiscourt to rely on in the motion for reconsideration.
