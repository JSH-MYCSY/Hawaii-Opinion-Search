SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ., and
Circuit Judge Nakasone, in place of Wilson, J., recused)
 
This appeal concerns the arbitrability of certain 
“purchase-based” claims pursuant to an arbitration clause 
contained in the Declaration of Condominium Property Regime of Kapalua Bay Condominium. On June 30, 2015, we affirmed the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit’s (circuit court) order denying Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration pursuant to our opinion in Narayan v. Ritz-Carlton Development Co., 135 Hawai' i 
327, 350 P.3d 995 (2015) (Narayan I). 
On January 11, 2016, the Supreme Court of the United
 
States vacated and remanded Narayan I and this case for further
 consideration in light of its decision in DIRECTV, Inc. v.
 Imburgia, 136 S. Ct. 463 (2015). 
The questions presented in this appeal are controlled 
by our decision in Narayan v. Ritz-Carlton Development Co., No. SCWC-12-0000819, at 3 (Haw. July 14, 2017) (pub. op.) (Narayan II), which affirmed our decision in Narayan I and held that “under long-standing Hawai' i contract law, the arbitration clause 
is unconscionable.”

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Pursuant to our analysis in Narayan II, the circuit
 
court’s August 26, 2013 order denying Defendants’ motion to
 
compel arbitration is affirmed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, July 14, 2017.
