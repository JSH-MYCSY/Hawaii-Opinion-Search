APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CAAP-13-0003607; CIV. NO. 12-1-0586)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSTION ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.,
and Circuit Judge Nakasone, in place of Wilson, J., recused)
  
This appeal concerns the arbitrability of certain 
“purchase-based” claims pursuant to an arbitration provision 
contained in the Declaration of Condominium Property Regime of Kapalua Bay Condominium. 
The questions presented in the 
underlying appeal are controlled by our recent decision in 
Narayan v. Marriott (Narayan I), No. SCWC-12-819, at 16 (Hawai' i 
June 3, 2015) (pub. op.), where we held “that the arbitration
 
provision contained in the condominium declaration is
 unenforceable because the terms of the various condominium
 documents are ambiguous with respect to the Homeowners’ intent to
 arbitrate.” 
Pursuant to our analysis in Narayan I, the circuit
 
court’s August 26, 2013 order denying Defendants Marriott
 International, Inc., The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, LLC,
 Marriott Two Flags, LP, the Ritz-Carlton Development Company,
 Inc., the Ritz-Carlton Management Company, LLC, John Albert,

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Edgar Gum, Marriott Ownership Resorts, Inc., MH Kapalua Venture,
 
LLC, and Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation’s motion to
 compel arbitration is affirmed.
