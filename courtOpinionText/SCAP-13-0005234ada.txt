(Supp. 2008), which was repealed by the state legislature on 
June 28, 2012 by Act 182.  Plaintiff-Appellant Russell L. 
Hungate (Hungate) appeals the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit’s (circuit court) order granting Defendants-Appellees 
David B. Rosen ’s and his law office’s (collectively, Rosen ) 
motion to dismiss the complaint.  Hungate also appeals the 
circuit court’s order granting Defendant-Appellee Deutsche Bank 
National Trust Company’s (Deutsche Bank ) motion to dismiss the 
first amended complaint.1 
On appeal, we consider whether the circuit court 
wrongly dismissed Hungate’s claims alleging Deutsche Bank and 
Rosen violated statutory, contractual, and common law duties, 
and committed unfair or deceptive acts or practices (UDAP).  We 
conclude the circuit court erred in dismissing the majority of 
Hungate’s claims. Accordingly, we vacate in part the circuit 
court’s November 5, 2013 order granting Ros en’s motion to 
dismiss, vacate in part the circuit court’s April 8, 2014 order 
granting Deutsche Bank’s motion to dismiss , and remand for 
further proceedings. 
1 On appeal, Hungate’s case was split into two appellate case 
numbers. SCAP- 13-0005234 is Hungate’s appeal of the circuit court’s order 
dismissing the original complaint. SCAP -14-0000772 is Hung ate’s appeal of 
the circuit court’s order dismissing the first amended complaint, which 
Hungate filed after the circuit court dismissed his original complaint. 
Hungate’s cases were consolidated by th is court into SCAP -13-0005234.

  Hungate  secured a mortgage loan  from IndyMac Bank, 
F.S.B. (IndyMac), in the amount of $324,090 to  purchase real  
2 property in Kalā heo, Kaua i in 2007.   Hungate executed the 
mortgage on February 10, 2007 and recorded  it  in the Bureau of 
Conveyances on February 16, 2007.   In March 2007, IndyMac 
assigned its interest in Hungat e’s mortgage to one of its 
subsidiaries, which then assigned 
its interest to Deutsche Bank.  
                     
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
I. Background 
Because the circuit court dismissed Hungate’s August 
6, 2013 complaint and his 
first amended complaint, filed 
December 19, 2013, pursuant to Hawai i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) Rule 12(b)(6)  (2000), we take the factual allegations  
from the complaints  as true for purposes of this appeal.  See  
Young v. Allstate Ins. Co. , 119 Hawai i 403, 406, 198 P.3d 666,  
669 (2008). Hungate’s initial complaint and first amended 
complaint included the following factual allegations.  
A. Factual Allegations 
To address the possibility of foreclosure, the 
mortgage contract included a power of sale clause that allowed 
the property to be sold through a non -judicial foreclo
sure.  The 
power of sale clause, found in section 22 of Hungate’s mortgage, 
2 At the proceeding on R osen’s motion to dismiss, Hungate’s counsel 
represented that the property was a vacant 10,000 square foot lot with ocean 
views. Hungate planned to build a “dream home” on the property but he did 
not proceed with his plan after he experienced financial difficulties.

reads in relevant part as follows: “Lender shall publish a 
notice of sale and shall sell the Property at the time and place 
and under the terms spe cified in the notice of sale.”  
On August 5, 2008, IndyMac 
notified Hungate that his 
loan was in default because he had not made the required 
payments. On January 14, 2009, an individual acting on behalf 
of IndyMac3 executed a notice of mortgagee’s intention to 
foreclose under power of sale.  On March 16, 2009, the notice of 
intention of foreclosure was properly filed at the Bureau of 
Conveyances by IndyMac on behalf of Deutsche Bank as the holder 
of the note. The notice offered Hungate’s property for sale 
with a quitclaim deed and made no warranties. 
Deutsche Bank retained Rosen, a Hawai i-licensed 
attorney, to conduct the foreclosure of Hungate’s property. Deutsche Bank followed the non  -judicial foreclosure process set 
4 forth in HRS § 667 Part I.   
To begin the non-judicial foreclosure process, Rosen 
published a notice of 
sale in The Garden Island , a newspaper of 
general circulation, as required by former HRS § 667-5(a)(1) 
(Supp. 2008). Under HRS § 667-5(a)(1), the attorney must 
3 The record is unclear as to whether the individual was employed 
by IndyMac or another entity. 
4 An alternative non -judicial foreclosure process with additional 
statutory requirements, codified in HRS § 667 Part II (Supp. 2008), was also 
available.

                     ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
publish the notice of the mortgagee’s intention to foreclose 
“once in each of three successive weeks . . . in a newspaper 
having a general circulation in the county in which the 
mortgaged property lies[.]” In compliance with this 
requirement, Rosen published a notice  of sale once a week for 
three weeks on March 20, March 27, and April 3, 2009.  The 
5 notice of sale stated a sale date of April 17, 2009.   
Rosen then postponed the sale a total of four times in 
2009: from April 17 to May 15, from May 15 to Ju
ne 12, from June 
12 to July 17, and from July 17 to August 14. These dates were never published. Whether the postponement was publicly 
announced to the bidders who attended each sale date, as 
required by HRS § 667-5(d), is contested. 
At the August 14, 2009 sale, Deutsche Bank was the 
sole bidder with a winning credit bid of approximately $161,250.  
This amount was substantially below the market value of 
Hungate’s property. A “Mortgagee’s Grant Deed Pursuant to Power 
of Sale” was recorded at the Bureau of Conveyances on October 
30, 2009 by Deutsche Bank. 
B. Procedural History 
On August 6, 2013, Hungate filed his initial complaint 
against Rosen and Deutsche Bank. Hungate contended that 
5   The notice states ,  in relevant part ,  that the mortgagee “gives 
notice that Mortgagee will hold a sale by public auction on April 17, 2009 at 
12:00 noon At [sic] the flagpole fronting the fifth circuit court building.”

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Deutsche Bank and Rosen wrongfully conducted the foreclosure of 
Hungate’s property by (1) advertising a proposed sale date 28 
days after the date of the first published notice, when HRS § 
667-76 required that the sale date be at least 29 days after the 
first published notice; (2) failing to publicize the postponed sale date, in violation of the mortgage’s power of sale clause ; 
and (3) breaching their common law duty to secure the best 
possible price for the property.  Hungate also argued that 
Deutsche Bank and Rosen violated HRS § 480-2
7 because their 
actions constituted unfair and deceptive trade acts or practices and resulted in unfair methods of competition. 
Rosen filed a motion to dismiss under HRCP Rule 
12(b)(6). Rosen argued (1) the initial sale date was scheduled 
after the expiration of four weeks, when including the date 
first advertised, and thus he complied with HRS § 667-7; (2) 
6	 HRS § 667-7 (Supp. 2008) states as follows: 
(a) The notice of intention of foreclosure shall contain: 
(1)	 A description of the mortgaged property; and 
(2)	 A statement of the time and place proposed for 
the sale thereof at any time after the 
expiration of four weeks from the date when 
first advertised. 
(b)	 The affidavit described under section 667 -5 may   
lawfully be made by any person duly authorized to act 
for the mortgagee, and in such capacity conducting 
the foreclosure. 
7 HRS § 480-2(a) (2008) states that “[u]nfair methods of 
competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any 
trade or commerce are unlawful. ”

publication of a sale postponement notice was not required by 
HRS § 667-5(d)8 or the mortgage;9 and (3) Rosen is not liable to 
Hungate because Rosen did not owe a duty of care to Hungate, a 
non-client. 
On November 5, 2013, the circuit court granted Rosen’s 
motion to dismiss.10 The court ruled that (1) Rosen complied 
with HRS §§ 667-5 and 667-7 as a matter of law; (2) HRS § 667­
5(d) and the power of sale clause of the mortgage did not 
require publication of the postponement of the non-judicial 
foreclosure sale; (3) Hungate lacked standing to assert claims 
under HRS chapter 480; and (4) Hungate’s common law claims were 
foreclosed because Rosen did not owe a duty to Hungate. 
On December 19, 2013, Hungate filed his first amended 
complaint against Rosen and Deutsche Bank.  The claims were nearly identical to those alleged in the initial complaint.
11 
8 HRS § 667-5(d)(Supp. 2008) states in relevant part as follows: 
“Any sale, of which notice has been given . . . may be postponed fro m time to 
time by public announcement made by the mortgagee or by a person acting on 
the mortgagee’s behalf.” 
9 Rosen noted that the notice of mortgagee’s intention to foreclose 
under power of sale stated that “[t]his sale may be postponed from time to 
time by public announcement made by Mortgagee or someone acting on 
Mortgagee’s behalf.” (Emphasis omitted). 
10 The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided. 
11 In addition to the claims raised in the initial complaint, 
Hungate alleged that Deutsche Bank’s practice of granting quitclaim deeds , 
rather than limited warranty deeds , was an unfair and deceptive trade 
practice. This claim is not an issue before the court.

Deutsche Bank filed a motion to dismiss the first 
amended complaint, making arguments similar to those presented 
by Rosen. 
On April 8, 2014, the circuit court granted in part12 
Deutsche Bank’s motion to dismiss Hungate’s first amended 
complaint. As with its prior dismissal of Hungate’s August 6, 
2013 complaint, the court ruled that (1) Deutsche Bank complied 
with the notice requirement under HRS §§ 667-5 and 667-7 as a 
matter of law, and (2) HRS § 667-5(d) and the power of sale 
clause did not require that postponements of sale be published. 
After appealing to the Intermediate Court of Appeals, 
the parties filed applications for transfer that were 
subsequently granted by this court.

Hawaii 184, 193, 159 P.3d 143, 152 (2007) .  When construing 
statutes, the court is governed by the following rules:  
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself. 
Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task of 
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be o btained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness 
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an ambiguity exists. 
When there is ambiguity in a statute, “the meaning of 
the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning. ” 
Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids in 
determining legislative intent, such as legislative 
history, or the reason and spirit of the law.

III. Discussion 
Taking the facts alleged in Hungate’s complaints as 
true, the circuit court improperly dismissed Hungate’s initial 
complaint and first amended complaint.  In reaching this 
conclusion, we assess Hungate’s claims against Deutsche Bank and 
Rosen, respectively.  
In Part A, we hold  the circuit court erred in 
dismissing the majority of Hungate’s claims  against Deutsche 
Bank regarding the alleged HRS chapter 667 Part I violations.  Additionally, we conclude the mortgage’s power of sale clause 
required Deutsche Bank to publish all postponements of the 
foreclosure sale.   Regarding Hungate’s HRS c hapter 667 Part I 
claims against Rosen, we  conclude  that the statute required 
Rosen (1) to give proper notice of the sale date under former 
HRS § 667-7 and (2) to give notice of the postponements of the  
sale in accordance with the mortgage’s power of sale clause per former HRS § 667  -5.  However, we hold that th  ose statutory 
10
  
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
   
   
  
  
 
 
  
    ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
provisions do not create a private right of action against the 
attorney of a foreclosing mortgagee. We conclude Hungate does 
not have a cause of action against Rosen under former HRS § 667­
5 and his claims against Rosen based upon the mortgage’s power 
of sale clause cannot stand. 
In Part B, we determine that Deutsche Bank had a 
common law duty to Hungate to use reasonable means to obtain the 
best price for Hungate’s property. In Part C we hold that the 
circuit court erred in d ismissing Hungate’s unfair or deceptive 
acts or practices claim against Deutsche Bank, but properly 
dismissed Hungate’s UDAP claim against Rosen. 
A.	 The Circuit Court Erred in Dismissing the Majority of 
Hungate’s Claims Alleging HRS Chapter 667 Part I Violations 
against Deutsche Bank 
Hungate alleges that Deutsche Bank  and Rosen 
improperly conducted the foreclosure sale of Hungate’s property. 
Specifically, Hungate contends  Rosen and Deutsche Bank: (1) 
advertised a foreclosure date earlier than permitted under HRS 
§ 667 Part I; (2)  failed to publish the notices of postponements 
of the sale as was required by the power of sale clause;  and (3) 
improperly permitted  a non-attorney to prepare and sign  the 
notice of sale.  
We hold that the circuit court erred in dismissing 
Hungate’s complaints against Deutsche Bank on the basis of the first two allegations. As to the third allegation, former HRS 
11
  
 
  
 
 
Former HRS § 667-  7(a)(2) required that “[t]he notice 
of intention of foreclosure shall contain: . .  . A statement of 
the time and place proposed for the sale [of the mortgaged 
property] at any time after  the expiration of four weeks from 
the date when first advertised.” 
(Emphasis added).  Thus, 
                     
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
§ 667-5 does not require a Hawai i-licensed attorney to prepare 
and sign a notice of sale, and we affirm in part the circuit 
court’s April 8, 2014 order  dismissing Hungate’s first amended 
complaint.    
Regarding the allegations against Rosen, we conclude 
that Hungate does not have a cause of action against  Rosen for 
violating statutory  requirements  under HRS chapter 667, or for 
his failure to adhere to the requirements of the mortgage’s 
power of sale clause.     
1. HRS § 1-29 Governs the Scheduling of a Foreclosure Sale 
Under Former HRS § 667 Part I13 
13  The events at issue here occurred between 2007 and 2009. In the wake 
of the mortgage crisis, the legislature formed a Mortgage Foreclosure 
Task Force in 2010.  See  2010 Haw. Sess. Laws, Act 162, § 2, at 375.   
The Task Force recommended extensive changes to the Hawaiʿi foreclosure 
statute in reports to the legislature in December 2010 and December 
2011, and many of those changes were subsequently enacted by the 
legislature in the 2011 and 2012 legislative sessions.  See  generally  
Final Report of the Mortgage Foreclosure Task Force to the Legislature 
for the Regular Session of 2012 (December 2011);  see also   2011 Haw. 
Sess. Laws, Act 48 at 84; 2012 Haw.  Sess. Laws, Act 182 ,  at 630.  Among 
other things, those revisions imposed UDAP liability on foreclosing 
mortgagees for a series of specific violations of the statutory procedures which now govern nonjudicial foreclosure. HRS §  667-60 
(2016).  
12
  
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
   
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
whether the advertised sale date on April 17, 2009 was “af ter 
the expiration of four weeks” is the crux of this issue. 
Hungate contends that HRS § 1-29 is the proper method 
to calculate whether Deutsche Bank and Rosen complied with HRS 
§ 667-7.  HRS § 1-29 (2009) provides that time periods are 
calculated “by excluding the first day and including the 
last[.]” Under Hungate’s analysis, Deutsche Bank and Rosen 
advertised a foreclosure sale date that was exactly 28 days from 
the date the notice was published, and therefore the sale was 
not scheduled “after the expiration of four weeks.” 
Deutsche Bank and Rosen argue 
that we should apply the 
time computation rule set forth in Silva v. Lopez , which 
required that we “include the day of the first publication a nd 
exclude the day the act is advertised to be done.” Silva
, 5 
Haw. 262, 270 (Haw. Kingdom 1884). The time computation rule of 
Silva indicates that Deutsche Bank and Rosen advertised a sale 
date in compliance with the four-week requirement. 
We hold that HRS § 1-29 is the appropriate computation 
rule. In 1923, the Hawai i legislature passed Act 3, the 
predecessor to HRS § 1-29, which set forth a time computation rule that is substantially the same as HRS § 1-29.  1923 Haw. 
Sess. Laws Act 3, § 1 at 2.  To explain the necessity of Act 3, 
the chair of the House Judiciary Committee noted that “under our existing statutes no definition is given nor method supplied in 
13

  
 
   
 
  
    
 
   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
the computation of time for the performance or completion of an 
Act under contract or legal req uirement[.]” H. Stand. Comm. 
Rep. No. 9, in 1923 House Journal, at 97. Due to the absence of 
a time computation provision, he explained that “numerous 
interpretations [of time computation] based principally on the 
decisions of other courts and jurisdicti ons” resulted. Id.   
Silva
 is one such case that used the decisions of other courts 
to determine a time computation rule. Specifically,  the Silva  
court cited a New Hampshire case in deciding  that the day an  act  
occurred was included in computing time.  Silva , 5 Haw. at 262. 
By passing Act 3, which became HRS § 1-29, the Hawai i 
legislature outlined the procedure by which we now calculate time. Thus, HRS § 1-29 sets forth the computation rule to be 
used when calculating the scheduling of foreclosure sales 
pursuant to HRS § 667 Part I.    
HRS § 1-29 mandates that the earliest date for the 
sale 
of Hungate’s property was April 18, 2009, and thus Deutsche 
Bank did not give the requisite amount of notice.  HRS § 1-29 states that “[t]he time in which any act provided by law is to 
be done is computed by excluding the first day and including the 
last[.]” Combined with the “after the expiration of four weeks ” 
language from HRS § 667-7(a)(2), HRS § 1-29 requires that March 20, 2009, the date Deutsche Bank and Rosen first published the 
notice of sale, be excluded from the notice calculation as it 
14
  
 
   
 
   
  
 
 
 
  
   
   
 
   
 
  
   
  
                     ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
was “the first day.”  Counting four weeks—28 days —from March 
21, 2009, results in the earliest possible sale date falling on 
April 18, 2009. Accordingly, the circuit court erred in determining that a sale date of April 17, 2009 complied with the 
requirements of HRS § 667-7. 
2. The Power of Sale Clause Required Deutsche Bank to 
Publish Postponements of the Foreclosure Sale 
Hungate argues that Deutsche Bank and Rosen were 
required to publish all postponements of the April 17, 2009 sale 
date for two reasons: (1) the original sale date advertised in 
the notice was one day early and thus notice was not properly 
given, and (2) the power of sale clause of Hungate’s mortgage 
required publication of postponements of the foreclosure sale. 
Deutsche Bank and Rosen contend the power of sale 
clause cannot require publication of postponements because former HRS § 667-5(d)(Supp. 2008) allows for sales to be postponed “from time to time by public announcement[.]”  This 
section presupposes, however, that “notice has been given ” in 
accordance with HRS § 667-7(a)(2).
14 Former HRS § 667-5(d).  As 
noted supra, Deutsche Bank did not comply with the time 
computation required by HRS § 667-7(a)(2) and thus did not, as 
14   Because former HRS §§  667-5 and 667-7  are  in pari materia, 
inasmuch as they both discuss the notice of intention of foreclosure, we read 
the two statutes together. See  HRS § 1-16 (2009) (“Laws in pari materia, or 
upon the same subject matter, shall be construed with reference to each other.”).

required by HRS § 667-5(d), give proper notice. Therefore, 
Deutsche Bank cannot avail itself of the public announcement 
postponement method in HRS § 667-5(d).  
Even assuming Deutsche Bank provided  timely notice of 
the date of sale  by public announcement, Hungate contends  
Deutsche Bank was required  —pursuant to former HRS § 667­  
5(a)(2)—to publish all postponements of the foreclosure sale in 
compliance with the mortgage’s power of sale clause .   HRS §   667­
5(a)(2) states that the attorney shall “ [g]ive any notices and 
do all acts as are authorized or required by the power [of sale]  
contained in the mortgage.”   (Emphasis added).   Thus, if the  
mortgage’s power of sale clause requires more than what is 
required under HRS § 667 Part I   , the mortgagee must follow the 
requirements of the power of sale  clause.  The relevant portion  
of the power of sale clause  of Hungate’s mortgage  states: “If 
Lender invokes the power of sale, . . . Lender shall publish  a 
notice of sale and  shall sell the Property at the time and place 
and under the terms specified  in the notice of sale.”   (Emphases 
added). Under Hungate’s interpretation of the clause, any 
change in the time, place, or terms specified in the notice of 
sale, which includes the date, time, and place of the sale,  
requires the lender to publish a new notice of sale with the new terms. 
16

  
 
  
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
In contrast  to Hungate’s position, Deutsche Bank and  
Rosen interpret the power of sale clause to allow postponement 
by public announcement because  the notice of sale expressly 
permits oral postponement.   The power of sale clause states that 
the mortgagee “shall sell the Property at the time and place and 
under the terms specified in the notice of sale .” (Emphasis 
added).   Because the notice of sale expressly states that the 
sale “may be postponed from time to time by public announcement made by Mortgagee or someone acting on Mortgagee’s behalf,” 
Deutsche Bank and Rosen assert that oral postponement complied 
with the “terms specified in the notice of sale.” According to 
Deutsche Bank’s and Rosen’s analysis of  the power of sale 
clause, only a single notice  must be published, and not “a 
notice of sale for each  postponed date.”   (Emphasis added) 
(citing Lima v. Deutsche Bank Nat’l Trust Co. , 943 F. Supp. 2d 
1093, 1101 (D. Haw. 2013)).  Thus, under Deutsche Bank ’s  and 
Rosen’s  interpretation  of the power of sale clause, once a  
notice of sale is published, the power of sale is complied with 
as long as future postponements are publicly announced orally at 
the time of the scheduled sale.   
Because 
there are two reasonable interpretations of 
the power of sale clause, an ambiguity exists as to whether a 
new notice must be published to postpone the foreclosure sale. 
See Wong , 130 Hawai i at 45, 
305 P.3d at 461 (explaining a 
17

  
 
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
contract is ambiguous  “when its terms are reasonably susceptible 
to more than one meaning”) . The application of contract 
interpretation principles to resolve the power of sale  clause ’s 
ambiguity supports the conclusion that Deutsche Bank was 
required to publish postponement notices. “[A]ny ambiguity in a 
mortgage instrument should be construed against the party 
drawing the documents,” State Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Kauaian Dev. 
Co., 62 Haw. 188, 198, 613 P.2d 1315, 1322 (1980), or in other 
words, “against the party who supplies the words [.]” 
Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 206 (Am. Law Inst. 1981).   
The ambiguity in the power of sale  clause should thus be 
resolved against Deutsche Bank, as the party who supplied the  
words of the contract.  Thus,  the more stringent interpretation, 
which requires postponements of the sale be published through a new notice, prevails.  Accordingly, the circuit court should not 
have dismissed Hu ngate’s complaints based on its reasoning that 
Deutsche Bank was not required to publish all postponements of  
the foreclosure sale.   
3. A Hawai i-licensed Attorney Is Not Required to Prepare or 
Sign a Notice of the Mortgagee’s Intention to Foreclose  
Former HRS § 667-5   (Supp. 2008) requires a mortgagee  
foreclosing under a power of sale “be represented by an attorney who is licensed to practice law in the State and is physically located in the State.”  HRS § 667-5(a).  The  attorney must

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
“[g]ive notice of the mortgagee’s . . . intention to foreclose 
the mortgage and of the sale . . . by publication” and “[g]ive 
any notices and do all acts as are authorized or required by the 
power contained in the mortgage.” HRS § 667 -5(a)(1)-(2).  
Hungate contends that Deutsche Bank did not comply with HRS § 667-5 because the notice of sale for Hungate’s property was 
15 16not prepared and signed by an attorney licensed in Hawai i.
The language of former HRS § 667-5 does not require a 
Hawaii-licensed attorney to prepare or sign the notice.  Our 
“fundamental starting point for statutory interpretation is the 
language of [HRS § 667-5] itself.” Citizens Against Reckless 
Dev., 114 Hawai i at 193, 159 P.3d at 152.   HRS § 667-5 only 
requires an attorney to “give notice” and “do all acts as are 
authorized or r equired” by the power of sale.   HRS § 667­
5(a)(1)-(2).  Neither of these requirements involves the  
preparation and signing of a notice. The language of the 
statute itself  thus does not  provide that a Hawai i-licensed 
attorney is required to prepare or sign a notice.  
15 Hungate also uses the terminology that a non -attorney “published” 
the notice. But, as Deutsche Bank notes, Hungate stated in his opening brief 
in CAAP- 13-0005234 that “Rosen caused to be published [the notice of sale] in 
the Kauai publication The Garden Island .” 
16 Deutsche Bank argues that Hungate waived this issue because it 
was not properly raised at trial. Hungate explains that this issue was 
raised in his memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss. Assuming 
arguendo that this claim was not waived, this claim is nonetheless meritless. 
19
  
 
  
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Additionally, the legislative history of HRS § 667-5 
does not evince the intent that a Hawai i-licensed attorney 
prepare or sign a notice  of the mortgagee’s intention to 
foreclose. The legislature’s purpose in enacting HRS § 667 -5 
was to ensure that  where a power of sale clause is included in 
the mortgage, interested parties be able to request and timely 
receive information. See  Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 3-08, in 2008 
House Journal, at 1710, 2008 Senate Journal, at 793; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2108, in 2008 Senate Journal, at 917.  To 
accomplish this, the legislature required a mortgagee  to hire a 
Hawaii-licensed attorney, who is physically present in the 
state, to serve as a “contact individual”  in order to facilitate 
the providing of information.   S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2108, in 
2008 Senate Journal, at 917.   A Hawaii-licensed attorney must 
therefore serve as a contact  individual and provide notice of a 
mortgagee’s intent to foreclose on a pro perty
—but the 
legislative history contains no indication of legislative intent 
that the attorney prepare or sign a notice of the mortgagee’s 
intention to foreclose.    
Accordingly, 
the circuit court properly dismissed 
Hungate’s first amended complaint as to his claim that a non-attorney prepared and signed the notice of sale.

4.  Former HRS §§ 667-5 and    667-7 Create No Private Right of  
Action Against a Foreclosing Mortgagee’s Attorney  
Hungate contends Rosen owed statutory duties under HRS  
§§  667-5 and 667-7.  In response, Rosen argues former HRS § 667-5 
fails to involve the kind of  “special relationship” between 
Hungate and Rosen  necessary for an attorney to owe a duty to a 
non-client.  Generally, a duty imposed on an attorney in favor 
of an adversary of the attorney’s client poses  an “unacceptable 
conflict of interest.” Buscher v. Boning ,  114 Hawaiʻ i 202, 220,  
159 P.3d 814, 832 (2007).   For that reason, absent special 
circumstances, attorneys owe no duty of care to non-clients.  See  
id.   The question raised here is whether the requirements of 
former HRS §  667-5 and former HRS § 667-7 impose    duties that may 
be enforced against the attorney of a foreclosing mortgagee  
under a private right of action.   
Requirements imposed by statutes do not necessarily  
give rise to a private right of action.   Cannon v. University of 
Chicago, 441 U.S.   677, 688 (1979)(noting that the fact that    a 
“statute has been violated and some person harmed does not 
automatically give rise to a private cause of action in favor of 
that person”).   In considering whether a duty imposed by statute 
creates a private right of action, our court has consistently 
focused on the intent of the legislature. Whitey’s Boat 
Cruises, Inc. v. Napali-Kauai Boat Charters, Inc., 110 Hawai  ʻi

302, 312, 132 P.3d 1213, 1223  (2006).   We review such questions 
de novo  as a matter of law.   Namauu v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 
62 Haw. 358, 362, 614 P.2d 943, 946 (1980)(noting that “the 
nature and extent of duty imposed by statute is a matter of 
law”).  
The 
language of former HRS § 667-5, as amended in 
2008, indicates the legislature intended attorneys to provide 
notice of the mortgagee’s intention to foreclose and notice of 
the sale of the mortgaged property; the language also shows the 
legislature intended attorneys to comply with the power of sale 
clause in the mortgage. Former HRS § 667-5(a) explicitly states 
that “[t]he attorney shall[] . . . [g]ive notice of the 
mortgagee’s . . . intention to foreclose the mortgage and of the 
sale of the mortgaged property.” (Emphasis added). In 
addition, the attorney “ shall . . . do all acts as are 
authorized or required by the power contained in the mortgage,” such as complying with the power of sale clause of the mortgage. Former HRS § 667-5(a)(2) (emphasis added).  An attorney thus is 
required under the statute to give proper notice and to perform 
all acts authorized or required by the power of sale clause.
17 
Although Rosen failed to follow some requirements of former HRS 
17 Former HRS § 667 -5(d), however, permits the mortgagee or “some 
person acting on the mortgagee’s behalf” —not necessarily an attorney —to 
postpone the sale by public announcement.

§ 667-5, we hold that the statute did not create a cause of 
action against attorneys who fail to follow its requirements. 
In determining whether a private cause of action 
should be recognized based on statutory requirements, we 
consider the following factors: (1) whether the plaintiff is 
“one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was 
enacted”; (2) whether there is “any indication of legislative 
intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or 
to deny one”; and (3) whether a private cause of action would be 
“consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff .” Whitey’s Boat 
Cruises, 110 Hawai ʻi at 312, 132 P.3d at 1223. While each factor 
is relevant, “the key factor” is whether the legislature 
“intended to provide the plaintiff with a private right of 
action.” Id. at 313 n.20, 132 P.3d at 1224 n.20; see also 
Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington , 442 U.S. 560, 575 (noting that 
the three factors used to assess whether a private cause of 
action may be implied from statutory language ultimately “ are 
ones traditionally relied upon in determining legislative 
intent”). 
We first consider whether Hungate was a member of the 
class for whose special benefit the statute was enacted. As 
discussed supra , the statute was amended to benefit the “ party 
in breach of the mortgage agreement.” H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 
23
  
 
  
       
18                
  HRS § 667 -4 (1993) does provide the mortgagor may defend against  
foreclosure.  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
1192, in 2008 House Journal, at 1450. As the party in breach of 
the mortgage contract, Hungate falls within the class for whom 
the statute was enacted. 
The second factor considers whether there is “any 
indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either 
to create such a remedy or to deny one.” Whitey’s Boat Cruises, 
Inc., 110 Hawai ʻi  at 312, 132 P.3d at 1223.   Former HRS § 667  -5 
and its legislative history are  silent as to whether the 
legislature intended to create a cause of action on behalf of 
18 the mortgagor  against the mortgagee’s lawyer.   “[I]mplying a 
private right of action on the  basis of [legislative]  silence is 
a hazardous enterprise, at best. ”   Touche Ross & Co , 442 U.S. at  
571.   Nonetheless, legislative silence alone is not dispositive. 
See  1A C.J.S. Actions § 62  (2016)(when a statute is silent, a 
court may infer a statutory private right of action where there 
is strong evidence that “the statutory scheme” implies it).   
We turn, then, to the third factor, whether a private 
cause of action would be consistent with “the underlying 
purposes of the legislative scheme.” Whitey’s B oat Cruises, 
Inc., 110 Hawai ʻi  at 312, 132 P.3d at 1223. H  ere, amendments to 
the foreclosure process set forth in HRS chapter  667 Part I were 
intended to “expand[] the rights of mortgagors .”   Kondaur 
24
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Capital Corp. v. Matsuyoshi , 136 Hawaiʻ i 227, 239, 361 P.3d 454, 
466 (2015) (explaining that amendments to former HRS § 667-5 
“added requirements that mortgagees must fulfill in order to accomplish a valid foreclosure sale” resulting in a benefit to 
mortgagors by “expand[ing] and bolster[ing] the protect ions to 
which they are entitled ”). 
However, a 
close reading of the legislative history of 
the 2008 amendment shows it was enacted to set additional burdens on the 
mortgagee  to protect the mortgagor; the statute 
was not amended to regulate attorneys representing mortgagees.  The amendment’s structure or scheme attempted “to streamline and 
ensure transparency in the non-judicial foreclosure process by requiring a foreclosure mortgagee to provide pertinent 
information regarding the property to interested parties.” S. 
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2108, in 2008 Senate Journal, at 917 
(emphasis added). 
The committee reports explain that potential buyers 
and other interested parties faced difficulties in obtaining 
updated information regarding foreclosure sales from banks and 
entities located outside of Hawai ʻi:  “A large number of Hawaii  
foreclosures are handled by servicing corporations located on 
the mainland that provide little to no information relating to 
the foreclosure to parties that are entitled to information regarding the property to be foreclosed.” Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 
25

  
 
  
 
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
3-08, in 2008 House Journal, at 1710, 2008 Senate Journal, at 
793. Due to the growing concern that mortgagees were creating 
obstacles for parties seeking information, the legislature 
required a mortgagee to hire a Hawaiʻ i-licensed attorney, who is 
physically present in the state, to serve as a “contact 
individual.” S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2108, in 2008 Senate 
Journal, at 917.   The legislature concluded that a “ Hawaii-based 
attorney will ensure that interested parties have a means to obtain information from a person with a local presence and the 
ability to provide useful information.” Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 3
08, in 2008 House Journal, at 1710, 2008 Senate Journal, at 793. Thus, the underlying structure  and intent of the amendment was  
to enable interested parties to request and receive information 
in a timely manner from 
mortgagees , and not to regulate 
attorneys’  conduct.   Permitting a mortgagor to assert a claim 
against the foreclosing mortgagee’s attorney for failure to 
comply with former HRS § 667-  5 falls outside this statutory 
scheme.  
­
We also 
consider the further factor of whether 
“additional remedies are unnecessary ” when determining whether 
to recognize a new cause of action. Best Place, Inc. v. Penn 
America Ins. Co. , 82 Hawaiʿi 120, 126, 920 P.2d 334, 340 (1996).  
In this case, creating a cause of action under former HRS § 667­
5 is not necessary to protect the interests of the mortgagor.  
26

  
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
   
 
 
   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Rather, the mortgagor can protect its interests through filing a 
claim against the mortgagee for wrongful foreclosure. See  
Santiago v. Tanaka , 137 Hawaiʿi 137, 158-59, 366 P.3d 612, 633­
34 (2016) (holding the nonjudicial foreclosure was wrongful and 
awarding restitution to mortgagor). When voiding the 
foreclosure is not possible, the mortgagor is entitled to 
“restitution of their proven out-of-pocket losses” through a 
wrongful foreclosure claim. Id. 
at 158, 366 P.3d at 633. 
Because mortgagees could be required to provide restitution to 
injured mortgagors under a wrongful foreclosure claim, a 
“sufficient incentive” exists for mortgagees to ensure that the 
foreclosure proceedings are correctly performed by attorneys.  
Best Place, Inc. , 82 Hawaiʿi at 127, 920 P.2d at 341. The 
interests of the mortgagor are thus protected. 
In sum
, we conclude that recognizing a cause of action 
based upon former HRS § 667-5 is not warranted. Because former HRS §§ 667-5 and 667-7 are 
in pari materia,  inasmuch as they 
both discuss the notice of intention of foreclosure, we read the 
two statutes together. See 
HRS § 1-16 (2009) (“ Laws in pari 
materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall be construed with reference to each other.”). Accordingly, for the same 
reasons Hungate cannot assert a cause of action against Rosen under HRS § 667-5, he cannot assert a claim under HRS § 667-7. 
Hungate also makes a contract-based argument that 
27
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Rosen was required to adhere to the mortgage’s power of sale 
clause because former HRS § 667  -5(a)(2) states that the attorney 
shall “[g]ive any notices and do all acts as are authorized or 
required by the power [of sale] contained in the mortgage.”   
However, Hungate’s ability to make this contract -based claim 
ultimately relies  upon the availability of a cause of action 
under former HRS § 667-5.  As discussed  supra, Hungate cannot  
assert a viable cause of action against Rosen under HRS § 667  -5; 
thus, his contract-based claim does not stand.          
B.
	 Deutsche Bank Must Use Reasonable Means to Obtain the Best 
Price for a Foreclosed Property 
In addition to Hungate’s allegations that Deutsche 
Bank and Rosen violated HRS § 667 Part I and the mortgage 
contract, Hungate asserts that Deutsche Bank violated common law 
duties established in Silva 
and Ulrich v. Sec. Inv. Co. , 35 Haw. 
158 (Haw. Terr. 1939). Quoting Ulrich
, Hungate contends that 
failing to give proper notice under former HRS § 667-7(a)(2) and 
failing to publish postponement announcements as required by the 
mortgage’s power of sale clause constituted violations of the 
common law duty to “use all fair and reason able means in 
obtaining the best prices for the property on sale[.]” Ulrich, 
35 Haw. at 168. We agree. In reaching this conclusion, we first discuss the duty owed by mortgagees under Ulrich. We then 
address the burden of the mortgagee who purchases the foreclosed 
28
  
 
   
 
                     
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
property to demonstrate that the foreclosure sale was “regularly 
and fairly conducted” and that “an adequate price” was paid by 
the mortgagee. Ulrich, 35 Haw. at 168.  
1. Deutsche Bank Owes a Common Law Duty to Hungate 
We recently reaffirmed Ulrich  and recognized that this 
common law duty extends to mortgagees conducting non-judicial foreclosure sales of real property. See  Kondaur Capital Corp. 
v. Matsuyoshi, 136 Hawaiʿi  227, 361 P.3d 454  (2015).  At the 
time Ulrich  was decided, the law did not distinguish between 
19 real property and chattel mortgages;  accordingly,  the court did 
not limit Ulrich ’s holding to chattel mortgages. See  RLH § 
19   The statutory provisions governing non -judicial foreclosures when 
Ulrich  was decided were Revised L aws of Hawai i (RLH)  §§ 4724 -4728 (1935).  
Ulrich, 35 Haw. at 163. RLH § 4724, the former version of HRS § 667 -5, 
provided as follows:  
Notice  of  foreclosure;  affidavit after sale.  When  a power  
of  sale  is  contained in  a mortgage, the mortgagee,  or  any 
person  having  his estate  therein,  or  authorized  by  such  
power to  act in  the premises, may,  upon  a breach  of  the  
condition, give notice of his intention to foreclose the 
mortgage, by publication of such  notice in the English 
language once in each of three successive weeks, the first  
publication to be not less than twenty -eight days  before  
the day of sale, and the last  publication to  be  not less  
than  fourteen  days  before  the day of  sale, in  a newspaper 
published either in the county in which the mortgaged  
property lies, or in Honolulu, and having a circulation in  
such  county; and also  give  such  notices  and do  all such  
acts  as  are authorized or  required  by  the power contained  
in  the mortgage.  He  shall,  within  thirty  days  after  
selling the property in pursuance of the power, file a copy 
of  the notice  of  sale  and his affidavit,  setting forth his 
acts  in  the premises  fully and particularly, in  the bureau  
of  conveyances,  in  Honolulu.  The affidavit and copy  of  the 
notice  shall be  recorded  by  the registrar,  with  a notice  of  
reference thereto in the margin of  the record of  the 
mortgage deed, if recorded in his office.

4724; Kondaur, 136 Hawaiʿi at 240, 361 P.3d at 467 (analyzing 
RLH § 4727); Ulrich , 35 Haw. at 163-68.  In Kondaur, we 
explained that Ulrich’s rationale, to protect the mortgagor from 
being “wrongfully and unfairly taken advantage of by the 
mortgagee,” applies with equal force to non -judicial foreclosure 
sales of real property. Kondaur, 136 Hawaiʿi at 240, 361 P.3d 
at 467.  Mortgagors of both real and personal property therefore 
continue to benefit from the protections set forth in Ulrich. 
Id. at 240, 361 P.3d at 467.  Accordingly, under Kondaur and 
Ulrich, in addition to the duties required under the now-
repealed HRS § 667 Part I, a mortgagee has a duty to use “fair 
and reasonable means in obtaining the best prices for the property on sale.” Id. at 235, 361 P.3d at 462 (citing Ulrich , 
35 Haw. at 168); see also Silva , 5 Haw. at 265 (requiring the 
mortgagee “to use discretion in an intelligent and reasonable 
manner, not to oppress the debtor or to sacrifice his estate”). 
We further clarify that the mortgagee’s duty to seek 
the best price under the circumstances does not require the mortgagee to obtain the fair market value of the property.  
Indeed, “[m]any commentators have observed that the foreclosure 
process commonly fails to produce the fair market value for 
foreclosed real estate.” Restatement (Third) of Prop.: 
Mortgages § 8.3 cmt. a (Am. Law Inst. 1997).  There are several reasons why foreclosure sales fail to attract fair market value

bids, such as the difficulty in inspecting the subject 
properties, technical publication notices, marketable title 
concerns, and the lack of a willing seller.  Id.; see also First 
Bank v. Fischer & Frichtel, Inc.
, 364 S.W.3d 216, 226 (Mo. 2012)

known that property, when sold at a forced sale, usually does 
not bring its full value’ and, instead, ‘has the potential of 
bringing only a fraction of the fair market value ’” (citations 
omitted)). While final bids on foreclosed property need not equate to fair market values, the mortgagee nonetheless has a 
duty to use fair and reasonable means to conduct the foreclosure 
sale in a manner that is conducive to obtaining the best price 
under the circumstances. 
2. Deutsche Bank Carries the Additional Burden to 
Demonstrate a Regular and Fair Sale and an Adequate Sale 
Price 
In addition t
o the duty of a mortgagee to use fair and 
reasonable means to obtain the best price for the property, a 
mortgagee who purchases the foreclosed property has the burden 
to show that the sale was “regularly and fairly conducted” and 
that “an adequate price” w as paid under the circumstances. 
Ulrich
, 35 Haw. at 168; see also  Kondaur
, 136 Hawaiʿi at 241-42, 
361 P.3d at 468-69.  As we explained in Kondaur , “[i]n instances 
where the mortgagee assumes the role of a purchaser in a self-
dealing transaction, the burden is on the mortgagee . . . to 
31
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
establish its compliance with these obligations.” Id. at 240, 
361 P.3d at 467.  This burden properly falls on the mortgagee 
because in choosing to conduct the non-judicial foreclosure sale 
under HRS § 667 Part I, the mortgagee elects a position superior 
to the mortgagor with a duty to treat the mortgagor fairly and 
without resorting to the advantage derived from its authority to 
conduct the sale. 
There is no neutral party, such as a court, 
supervising the sale and ensuring a fair and reasonable process. When the non-judicial foreclosure sale results in the mortgagee 
purchasing the property, it is therefore imperative that the 
mortgagee establish that this result occurred after a fairly 
conducted sale. Id. at 241-43, 361 P.3d at 468-70.  
Accordingly, because Deutsche Bank purchased Hungate’s property, Deutsche Bank has the burden to establish that the sale was 
fairly conducted and resulted in an adequate price under the 
circumstances. Id. at 240-42, 361 P.3d at 467-69. 
C.	 The Circuit Court Erred in Dismissing Hungate ’s Unfair or 
Deceptive Acts or Practices Claim Against Deutsche Bank,

weeks of notice and failing to publish the notice of sale.  HRS 
§ 480-2(a) provides that “unfair or deceptive acts or practices 
in the conduct of any trade or commerce are unlawful.” 
HRS § 480-2 contains “broad language in order to 
constitute a flexible tool to stop and prevent fraudulent, unfair or deceptive business practices for the protection of 
both consumers and honest 
business[persons] .” Haw. Cmty. Fed.

statute “is remedial in nature and must be liberally construed 
in order to accomplish the purpose for which it was enac ted.”

his complaint and first amended complaint, but does not dispute the circuit

As a mortgagor who purchased residential property, 
Hungate alleges he qualifies as a consumer under HRS chapter 
480. A consumer is a “ natural person who, primarily  for 
personal, family, or household purposes, purchases, attempts to purchase, or is solicited to purchase goods or services or who 
commits money, property, or services in a personal investment.” 
HRS § 480-1 (2008).  “[I]n the context of consumer debt, the 
determination of whether the individual seeking suit is a 
‘consumer’ should rest on whether the underlying transaction 
which gave rise to the obligation ”  met the requirements of HRS 
§ 480-1.    
Flores  v. Rawlings   Co., LLC , 117   Hawaiʿi  153, 164,   177  
P.3d 341, 352   (2008).   Here,  the underlying   transaction involved   
committing money  in a personal    investment pursuant   to HRS §    480­
1, namely, purchas ing residential   property.   See Keka , 94 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Countrywide Fin. Corp. , 761 F.3d 1046, 1052 (9th Cir. 
2014)(applying Hawaiʿi 
law).  
To assert an unfair or deceptive acts or practices 
claim pursuant to HRS § 480
-2, Hungate must qualify as a 
“consumer” and the alleged conduct of Rosen and Deutsche Bank 
must involve “trade or commerce.” We address separately 
Hungate’s claims against Deutsche Bank and Rosen for unfair and 
deceptive acts or practices.

(1995))(explaining “real estate or residences q ualify as 
‘personal investments’”). Further, we have held that an 
individual who purchases residential property through acquiring 
a loan, i.e., a “loan borrower ,” is a “consumer” committing 
money in a personal investment within the meaning of HRS § 480­
1. Keka
, 94 Hawaiʿi at 227, 11 P.3d at 15 (citing Cieri, 80 
Hawaiʿi at 69, 905 P.2d at 44). Hungate, as a loan borrower who 
purchased residential property, is thus a consumer. 
We also conclude Deu tsche Bank’s acts occurred in 
trade or commerce. Trade or commerce means a “business 
context.” Cieri, 80 Hawaiʿi at 65, 905 P.2d at 40.  
Transactions conducted in a business context, “by their very nature, include transactions conducted by a financial 
institution,” such as a “loan extended by a financial 
institution[.]” Keka, 94 Hawaiʿi at 227, 11 P.3d at 15. Thus, 
the nature of a non-judicial foreclosure, which results from a 
loan transaction, is that of a transaction conducted in the 
business context. It is undisputed that Deutsche Bank is a 
financial institution regularly engaged in providing loans and 
conducting foreclosures. Deutsche Bank’s acts throughout the 
foreclosure proceedings therefore occurred in the business context.

We next consider whether Hungate alleged sufficient 
facts that Deutsche Bank engaged in unfair or deceptive acts.21 
“The question of whether a practice constitutes an unfair or 
deceptive trade practice is ordinarily a question of fact.” 
Balthazar v. Verizon Haw., Inc. , 109 Hawaiʿi 69, 72 n.4, 123 
P.3d 194, 197 n.4 (2005) (citation omitted).  To determine 
sufficiency, w e accept the allegations made in Hungate’s 
complaints as true and “view them in the light most favorable 
to” Hungate. Cayetano
, 111 Hawaiʿi at 476, 143 P.3d at 15. 
“[D]ismissal is proper only if it ‘appears beyond doubt that the 
plaintiff[s] can prove no set of facts in support of [their] 
claim[s] that would entitle [them] to relief. ’” Id. (citation 
omitted). 
A practice “is unfair when it [1] offends established 
public policy and [2] when the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or [3] substantially injurious to 
consumers.” Keka, 94 Hawaiʿi at 228, 11 P.3d at 16 (citation 
omitted). Hungate need not allege that Deutsche Bank ’s actions 
21 The circuit court did not reach the merits of Hungate’s unfair or 
deceptive acts or practices claim in its dismissals of the initial complaint 
and the f irst amended complaint.  In its dismissal of the initial complaint, 
the circuit court found that Hungate did not have standing to assert a n 
unfair or deceptive acts or practices claim against Rosen, and thus did not reach the merits of Hungate’s claim. In dismissing the first amended 
complaint against Deutsche Bank, the court explained that Hungate’s unfair or deceptive acts or practices claim was based in part on his allegation that 
Deutsche Bank failed to comply with the four -week requirement and failed to 
publish notice of the postponements of the foreclosure sale. The court 
determined that Hungate did not state a claim as to these issues and did not 
further address Hungate’s unfair or dece ptive acts or practices claim.

meet all three of these  factors to assert an unfair act or 
practice. See  id.  at 229, 11 P.3d at 17 (determining that the 
conduct in question was “unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous and 
substantially injurious to consumers ,” but not addressing 
whether the conduct offended public policy); Kapunakea Partners 
v. Equilon Enters. LLC , 679 F. Supp. 2d 1203, 1210 (D. Haw. 
2009)(analogizing the three factors as applied to federal 
antitrust laws to application of HRS § 480-2 to determine “[a]  
practice may be unfair because of the degree to which it meets

A practice  may be unfair if it  “offends public policy 
as it has been established by statutes, the common law, or 
otherwise[.]” Kapunakea Partners , 679 F. Supp. 2d at 1210 
(citing FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson , 405 U.S. 233, 244 n.5 
(1972)). Hungate claims Deutsche Bank ’s  conduct offended public 
policy because Rosen’s actions, on behalf of Deutsche Bank,  
violated HRS § 667 Part I, as discussed supra. Deutsche Bank 
also bore a common law duty to “use all fair and reasonable 
means in obtaining the best prices for the property on sale[.]”

purpose of non-judicial foreclosure statutes is to “protect the

debtor from a wrongful loss of property” (citation omitted)); 
Hoge v. Kane , 4 Haw. App. 533, 540, 670 P.2d 36, 40 (1983) 
(discouraging any action that “prevents a free, fair, and open 
[judicial foreclosure] sale or [that] chills the sale”). A 
factfinder could determine  Deutsche Bank’s conduct offended 
public policy or otherwise met the test for “unfair ,”  and 
therefore Hungate sufficiently alleged that Deutsche Bank  
engaged in unfair acts or practices.   
Hungate also alleged that Deutsche Bank conducted the 
non-judicial foreclosure deceptively.  A deceptive act or practice is “(1) a representation, omission, or practice[] that 
(2) is likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably under the 
circumstances [where] (3)[] the representation, omission, or 
practice is mater ial.” 
Courbat v. Dahana Ranch, Inc. , 111 
Hawaiʿi  254, 262, 141 P.3d 427, 435 (2006) (citation omitted).  
A representation, omission, or practice is material if it 
“involves ‘information that is important to consumers and, hence, likely to affect their choice of, or conduct regarding, a 
product.’”  Id.  (citation omitted).  The test to determine 
deceptiveness “is an objective one, turning on whether the act or omission ‘is likely to mislead consumers, ’  . . . as to 
information ‘important to consumers ’  . . . in making a decision   
regarding the product or service.” Id. (citations omitted).

    ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
“[P]roof of actual deception is unnecessary.” Rosa v. Johnston , 
3 Haw. App. 420, 427, 651 P.2d 1228, 1234 (1982).  
The same conduct that Hungate alleges to be unfair may  
also be considered to be deceptive. Hungate contends Rosen’s 
practice, on behalf of Deutsche Bank,  of conducting foreclosure 
sales on the 28th rather than 29th day from the date of first publication and failing to publish postponements of the sale 
date was likely to mislead reasonable consumers and could reduce 
buyer interest. Such practices  could render potential buyers 
less able to determine whether the property was available for sale and less able to obtain important information regarding the 
property. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit explained, “[p]roper notice of the actual date of a 
foreclosure auction is essential to ensure that foreclosed properties bring adequate prices and that the public has an 
appropriate opportunit y to bid.” 
Kekauoha-Alisa v. Ameriquest 
Mortg. Co. (In re Kekauoha-Alisa) , 674 F.3d 1083, 1091 (9th Cir. 
2012). Although Kekauoha-Alisa  presented a stronger case in 
which no public announcement of the sale was provided at all, 
the failure to publish the postponement  of a foreclosure sale 
could mislead consumers. Thus, a factfinder could determine  
Rosen’s scheduling of a foreclosure sale too early and failure 
to publish postponement notices , while acting on Deutsche Bank’s 
behalf, were deceptive acts.  
39

  
 
  
  
  
 
   
 
 
  
  
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
In addition to adequately alleging sufficient facts 
that Deutsche Bank ’s conduct were unfair or deceptive pursuant 
to HRS § 480-2, Hungate was also required to allege sufficient 
facts to show he was injured. See 
HRS § 480-13.  “[T]he mere 
existence of a violation is not sufficient  ipso facto to support 
the action; forbidden acts cannot be relevant unless they cause 
private damage.” Ai
, 61 Haw. at 618, 607 P.2d at 1312 
(overruled on other ground by Robert’s, 91 Hawaiʿi at 247, 982 
P.2d at 876).  HRS chapter 480 does not define injury or damages, but “Hawaiʿi courts have not set a high bar for 
proving” injury. Compton, 761 F.3d at 1053. Hungate need only 
allege that “he has, as a ‘direct and proximate result’ of [Deutsche Bank’s] violation [of section 480 -2], ‘sustained 
special and general damages’ . . . to withstand a motion to 
dismiss.” Id. at 1054 (citations omitted).  Based on the 
allegations in the complaints, the factfinder could determine Hungate was injured by the foreclosure sale, which eliminated equity that Hungate held in the property and prevented him from 
using the property. 
Accordingly, we hold that Hungate sufficiently alleged 
claims of unfair and deceptive acts or practices under HRS 
§ 480-2 against Deutsche Bank, and the circuit court erred  in 
dismissing Hungate’s unfair or deceptive acts or practices claim  
against Deutsche Bank.  
40
  
 
   
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
2. Under the Circumstances, Hungate Cannot Claim Unfair 
or Deceptive Acts or Practices by Rosen 
Hungate also argues  that he has standing as a consumer 
to assert an unfair or deceptive acts or practices claim against 
Rosen. Rosen maintains that the circuit court properly  
dismissed Hungate’s unfair or deceptive acts or practices  claim 
because Hungate  was not a consumer of Rosen’s services. We 
rejected a similar contention in  Flores. In Flores, the 
plaintiffs brought an unfair or deceptive acts or practices  
claim against a collection agency that provided subrogation and 
claims recovery services to the Hawai i Medical Services 
Association (HMSA) based on actions conducted in regards to a 
loan agreement between plaintiffs and HMSA. Flores, 117 Hawaiʿi  
at 155-57, 177 P.3d at 343-45.  Citing the statute’s definition 
of “consumer,” t he collection agency argued that the plaintiffs 
were not consumers because the plaintiffs did not purchase, 
attempt to purchase, or solicit to purchase goods or services  
from the agency. Id.  at 163, 177 P.3d at 351; see  HRS 480-1.  
We disagreed with the agency’s argument, and held that “the 
statutory structure of HRS chapter 480 does not require that one 
be a ‘consumer’ of the defendant ’s goods or services, but merely 
a ‘consumer.’” Id. at 164, 177 P.3d at 352.  A plaintiff  
“establishes his standing as a consumer in terms of his 
relationship to a transaction, not by a contractual relationship 
41

  
 
  
 
  
 
 
    
 
 
 
   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
with the defendant.” Id.   Therefore, the “only requirement” is 
that the consumer’s commitment of money, property, or services 
in a personal investment forms the  basis of his complaint.  Id.  
at 164-65, 177 P.3d at 352-53.  As Hungate asserts, he is a consumer based on the mortgage with Deutsche Bank, and is thus 
also a “consumer vis-à-vis  the mortgagee’s law yer for the same 
transaction.”  
Additio
nally, Hungate argues that Rosen acted as an 
agent for Deutsche Bank in conducting the foreclosure, and thus 
should be similarly held liable under the UDAP statute. Hungate 
cites Cieri v. Leticia Query Realty, Inc. , 80 Hawaiʿi 54, 65, 
905 P.2d 29, 40 (1995), to show that an agent or broker in a real estate transaction can be sued for UDAP under HRS § 480-2.  
However, the unique nature of the attorney-client relationship 
warrants distinguishing the role of broker and attorney for 
purposes of this case. Sellers and purchasers of real estate 
often “utilize and rely on brokers for their expertise and resources, including access to data in locating properties as 
well as determining pricing of ‘comparables’ as a basis for 
negotiations.” 
Cieri
, 80 Hawaiʿi at 65, 905 P.2d at 40.  Hence, 
the role of a broker is to provide clients with expertise and 
resources in real estate transactions. 
In contrast,  the role of an attorney involves 
representing a client’s interests against those of an opposing 
42
  
 
          
        
          
           
           
         
    
                     
  
   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
party within an adversary system.  Attorneys bear a duty to 
zealously represent clients “within the bounds of the law.”   
Giuliani v. Chuck  , 1 Haw. App. 379, 384, 620 P.2d 733, 737 
(1980); see also  Hawaiʿi  Rules of Professional Conduct, 
22  “Preamble,” ¶  2; ¶ 8; ¶ 9.  In other settings, we have declined 
to recognize a duty in favor of  a plaintiff adversely affected 
by an attorney’s  performance of legal services on behalf of the 
opposing party. In Boning, we noted that  “creation of a duty in 
favor of an adversary of the  attorney’s client would create an 
unacceptable conflict of interest. Not only would the 
adversary’s interests interfere with the client’s interests, the 
attorney’s justifiable concern with being sued for negligence 
would detrimentally interfere with the attorney-client 
relationship.” Boning, 114 Hawaiʿi  at 220, 159 P.3d at 832.  
Permitting 
a party to sue his or her opponent’s 
attorney for UDAP under HRS § 480-2 in foreclosure actions 
presents a similar issue in that an attorney’s concern with 
being sued by a party opponent could compromise his or her 
representation of the client. In a UDAP action, an attorney 
would be especially vulnerable to suit because, for example, 
under HRS § 480-2 “actual deception nee d not be shown; the 
22 Our desire to avoid creating unacceptable conflicts of interest 
in this context, to protect attorney -client counsel and advice from the 
intrusion of competing concerns, and to allow adequate room for zealous 
advocacy, does not encompass, for example, allowing attorneys to conduct 
patently illegal activities on behalf of clients. 
43
  
 
                      
  
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
capacity to deceive  is sufficient.” Keka, 94 Hawaiʿi  at 228, 11 
P.3d at 16 (emphasis added) (citations omitted)  .  Accordingly, a 
plaintiff would need only to allege that opposing counsel has 
breached the statutory duty under  HRS § 480- 2 “not to engage in 
unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce . . . in a way that caused private damages[] 
in order to state a claim under” HRS chapter 480. Compton, 761 
F.3d at 1056. Given that UDAP lacks  a more rigorous or precise   
state of mind requirement, “ even a carefully rendered opinion 
could, if incorrect, have the capacity to deceive.” Short,  691  
P.2d at 172 (Pearson,     J., concurring).    The attorney would 
therefore “have to insure the correctness of his [or her] 
opinions and strategies,” rendering it “virtually  impossible  for  
an attorney to    effectively perform   the traditional   role of legal    
counselor.”   Id.   Similar to   the negligence   issue in   Boning,  in  
foreclosure actions   an  attorney’s  justifiable  concern with being    
sued by the opposing     party for   UDAP could compromis  e the   
attorney’s  ability  to zealously   represent his   or her client.     
Consequently, based on the allegations against Rosen, we decline 
to recognize a UDAP claim against him by Hungate under HRS § 
23480-2 in the instant  foreclosure action.        
23 We do not now decide whether the 2012 amendments to the 
foreclosure statute create potential UDAP liability under some circumstances 
for attorneys conducting nonjudicial foreclosures. See HRS § 667-60 
(2016)(imposing UDAP liability on “any foreclosing mortgagee” for violating a
