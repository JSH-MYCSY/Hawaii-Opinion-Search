APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT  
(CAAP-
13-0005253; CIV. NO. 13-1-2097-07) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER   
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ. ) 
This case arises from the foreclosure sale of the 
properties of Plaintiffs-Appellants Julie M. Sigwart (Sigwart) 
and James L. K. Dahlberg (Dahlberg).  Both Sigwart ’s and 
Dahlberg’s mortgages contained a power of sale clause that 
allowed non-judicial foreclosures.  After Sigwart and Dahlberg 
defaulted on their mortgages, Attorney David B. Rosen (Rosen)  
 
   To foreclose on Sigwart’s property, Rosen published 
the notice of sale on July 3, 10, and 17, 2009; the notice of  
sale indicated  a sale date of July 31, 2009. Although Sigwart’s 
property was located in the County of Maui, the notice of sale 
was published in a publication with circulation in the County of 
Hawaiʻi and no ge neral circulation in the County of Maui.  The 
sale of Sigwart’s  property was postponed from July 31, 2009 to 
August 28, 2009 through “mesne postponements” that were cried 
1 out between July 31 and August 28, 2009.   Rosen did not publish 
any notices of the  continued sale dates.   At the August 28, 2009 
sale, U.S. Bank, N.A., the claimed holder of the note secured by  
the mortgage, was the sole bidder with a bid of $383,712.13.

was retained by the foreclosing mortgagees to carry out non-
judicial foreclosures under Part I of HRS Ch. 667 (2008).    
To foreclose on Dahlberg’s property, Rosen published a 
notice of sale on August 13, 20
, and 27, 2010; the notice of 
sale indicated a sale date of September 10, 2010. The sale of 
Dahlberg’s property was also postponed through “mesne 
postponements” that were cried out at the original sale. Rosen did not publish any notices of the continued sale date. At the 
January 7, 2011 sale, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., the claimed holder

postponements were cried out, only that they were within this range. 
The Affidavit of Foreclosure filed with the Bureau of Conveyances 
stated only that a “ postponement was cried on July 31, 2009, original 
sale. Sale was postponed to August 28, 2009 by mesne po stponements.”

  Rosen filed a motion to dismiss the first amended 
complaint on September 4, 2013. Rosen argued, inter alia , that: 
(1) publication of the postponement notice was not required  by 
Hawaiʻi law; (2)   the initial sales were scheduled after the 
expiration of four weeks from the date first advertised  in the 
notice of sale and complied with HRS § 667-7 (Supp. 2008   ); and   
(3) Sigwart and Dahlberg lacked standing to maintain a HRS 
chapter 480 claim because they were not  Rosen’s clients and  were  
not owed a duty of care by their lender’s attorney. T he first 
Circuit Court granted  Rosen’s  motion to dismiss the complaint, 
and final judgment was entered on October 30, 2013.   Sigwart and 
Dahlberg appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals.   They 
argued, inter alia  , that Rosen’s actions in violation of the 
nonjudicial foreclosure statute’s publication requirements were *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI’I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
of the note secured by Dahlberg’s Mortgage, w as the highest 
bidder with a bid of $225,000. 
Sigwart and Dahlberg filed a complaint against Rosen 
on July 31, 2013, alleging that Rosen had failed to properly advertise and conduct the non-judicial foreclosure sales of 
their properties in violation of the duties under plaintiffs’ 
mortgages, statutory law (including HRS §§ 667-5 and 667-7), 
common law, and the consumer protection statute, HRS § 480-2 
(2008).  Sigwart and Dahlberg amended the complaint on August 
23, 2013 to add further allegations.

  Sigwart and Dahlberg contend  the circuit court erred 
in granting Rosen’s motion to dismiss .   We disagree.  We 
recently held that the statutory requirements of former HRS §§ 
667-5 and 667-7 do not give rise to a priv  ate right of action 
against a foreclosing mortgagee’s attorney .   Hungate, 139 Hawaiʻ i  
at 405-07, 391 P.3d   at 12-14.    In addition,  given the  
circumstances alleged in that case, we declined to recognize an 
unfair or deceptive acts or practices (UDAP)  claim against Rosen  
as the foreclosing mortgagee’s attorney .   Id.  at 412-413, 391 
P.3d at 19-20; HRS  § 480-2.    *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI’I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
unfair and deceptive and therefore gave rise to a UDAP claim and 
that they had standing to bring such a claim. The case was 
later transferred to this court.  
Because this case was dismissed pursuant to 
Hawaiʻi 
Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6), we take the facts 
alleged by Sigwart and Dahlberg as true.  Hungate v. Law Office  
of David B. Rosen, 139 Hawaiʻ i 394, 401, 391 P.3d 1, 8 
(2017)(citation omitted). In addition, we view the allegations 
in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs “in order to 
determine whether the allegations contained therein could 
warrant relief under any alternative theory.” In re Estate of 
Rogers
, 103 Hawaiʻ i 275, 280, 81 P.3d 1190, 1195 (2003)(citation 
omitted).

  Dismissal under HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate 
where “the allegations of the complaint itself clearly 
demonstrate that plaintiff does not have a claim.”   Touchette v. 
Ganal, 82 Hawaiʻ i  293, 303, 922 P.2d 347, 357 (1996).   
Accordingly, we hold that the circuit  court properly granted 
Rosen’s motion to dismiss .  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI’I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
We premised our holding concerning Hungate’s UDAP 
claim, in part, on our “desire to avoid creating unacceptable 
conflicts of interest in this context, to protect attorney-
client counsel and advice from the intrusion of competing 
concerns, and to allow adequate room for zealous advocacy . . . 
. ” Id. at 413, n.22, 391 P.3d at 20, n.22. While we recognize 
that those concerns do “not encompass, for example, allowing 
attorneys to conduct patently illegal activities on behalf of clients,” id., the allegations in Sigwart and Dahlberg’s 
complaint do not rise to the level of patently illegal activities conducted by Rosen.
