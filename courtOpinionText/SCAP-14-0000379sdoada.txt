SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Petitioner/Appellee-Appellant 
Kyo-ya Hotels & Resorts LP’s (Kyo-ya) appeal from the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit’s “Order Denying Appellee Kyo-ya  
 
   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Hotels & Resorts LP’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs Under 
HRS § 607-14.5 Filed on 11/13/2013” (Order Denying Kyo-ya’s Attorneys’ Fees), entered on January 6, 2014, together with all submissions in support thereof, and in light of our decision in 
Surfrider Found. v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals, No. SCAP-13-0005781, 
2015 WL 5597179 (2015), we conclude that the claims presented by 
Respondents/Appellants-Appellees are not frivolous within the meaning of HRS § 607-14.5 (Supp. 2014) so as to merit recovery by Kyo-ya of attorneys’ fees and costs. See Tagupa v. VIPDesk, 
135 Hawai #i 468, 479, 353 P.3d 1010, 1021 (2015) (“A frivolous 
claim is a ‘claim so manifestly and palpably without merit, so as to indicate bad faith on the [pleader’s] part such that argument to the court was not required.’” (alteration in original) (quoting 
Coll v. McCarthy, 72 Haw. 20, 29—30, 804 P.2d 
881, 887 (1991)). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order Denying Kyo-ya’s 
Attorneys’ Fees is affirmed. 
  DATED: Honolulu, 
Hawai#i, November 2, 2015.
