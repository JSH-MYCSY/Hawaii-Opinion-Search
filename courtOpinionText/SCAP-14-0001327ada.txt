I. Introduction 
This case concerns a petition for a writ of quo 
warranto challenging Representative Calvin K.Y. Say’s (Say) 
authority to hold office as a representative of the Twentieth 
District of Hawai i. Quo warranto is “a common -law writ used to 
inquire into the authority by which a public office is held or a franchise is claimed.” Dejetley v. Kaho ohalahala, 122 Hawaiʻ i 
251, 265, 226 P.3d 421, 435 (2010) (quoting Black’s Law 
Dictionary 1371 (6th ed. 1990)).  Hawai i Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 659-1 (1993) defines a writ of quo warranto as “an order 
issuing in the name of the State by a circuit court and directed 
to a person who claims or usurps an office of the State or of 
any subdivision thereof . . . inquiring by what authority the 
person claims the office or franchise.”

  We consider the following issues  upon transfer of the 
case from the Intermediate Court of Appeals  (ICA): (1) whether 
“the law of the case” doctrine operates to foreclose Say’s 
arguments premised on article III, section 12 of the Hawai i  
Constitution, (2) whether the legitimacy of Say’s qualifications 
to hold a seat in the State of Hawai  i House of Representatives   
presents a nonjusticiable political question, (3) whether the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Hawai i was 
permitted to represent the House  of Representatives  against 
Appellants, and (4) whether permissive intervention by the House  
of Representatives  was proper.

Procedure (HRCP) Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). ”1 
We resolve the issues as follows: (1) the “law of the 
case” doctrine does not foreclose Say’s arguments, (2) 
the 
legitimacy of Say’s qualifications to hold office presents a 
nonjusticiable political question, (3) the Attorney General was 
not prohibited from representing the House of Representatives, 
and (4) the grant of permissive intervention to the House of 
Representatives was proper.

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
A. Trial Court Proceedings 
Say has served as the representative for the Twentieth 
District of Hawai
i  since 1976.  In December 2012, Appellants 
filed a petition for a writ of quo warranto  in the circuit court  
alleging that Say lived and lives in the Twenty-Fifth District  
of Hawai i.   Appellants challenged Say’s authority to hold office 
as a representative of the Twentieth District because he was not 
a “qualified voter” of the Twentieth District as required by 
article III, section 6 of the Hawai  i Constitution.2   
Say filed a motion to dismiss the petition in the 
circuit court
, arguing Appellants’ quo warranto petition 
challenged his voter registration, and was therefore subject to 
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Office of the City Clerk, City 
and County of Honolulu, pursuant to HRS § 11-25 (2012).3 
The circuit court granted Say ’s motion to dismiss, 
ruling the petition was a challenge to Say’s voter registration 
2 Article III, section 6 of the Hawai i Constitution provides in 
relevant part: 
No person shall be eligible to serve as a member of the 
house of representatives unless the person has been a 
resident of the State for not less than three years, has 
attained the age of majority and is, prior to filing 
nomination papers and thereafter continues to be, a 
qualified voter of the representative district from which 
the person seeks to be elected[.] 
3 HRS § 11- 25 provides that “ [a]ny registered voter may challenge 
the right of a person to be or to remain registered as a voter in any 
precinct . . . . The challenge shall be delivered to the clerk . . . . The 
clerk shall, as soon as possible, investigate and rule on the challenge.” 
4
  
 
 
and that challenges to voter registration are exclusively within 
the province of the county clerk.  The order stated in part:  
 
  
 
 
   
  In April 2014, the ICA vacated the circuit court’s 
dismissal, ruling that the circuit court did, in fact, have 
jurisdiction to hear petitions for quo warranto. Hussey v. Say, 
133 Hawai i 229, 234,   325 P.3d 641, 646  (App. 2014), 
reconsideration denied , 133 Hawai i 452, 330 P.3d 390 (App. 2014)  
(Hussey I).  The ICA concluded that A ppellants’ actual challenge 
was to Say’s qualification to remain seated as a house 
representative, and not to Say’s voter registration. Id.  at 
233, 325 P.3d at 645. The ICA explained, “[o]ur courts have 
jurisdiction over the interpretation of constitutional provisions for the qualification of candidates for the house of 
representatives and of elected representatives to serve in that 
capacity”  and  “[c]ircuit  courts have jurisdiction over ‘ actions 
or proceedings in or in the nature of . . . quo warranto. ’”   Id.  
at 233-34, 325 P.3d at 645-46 (citing HRS § 603  -21.7(b)(1993)).   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
1.  The Petition for Quo Warranto is, on its face, a challenge 
to Respondent’s voter registration. Challenges to voter 
registration are exclusively within the province of the 
clerks of the respective counties pursuant to Haw. Rev. 
Stat. § 11 -25.  
 
2. The circuit courts can never have jurisdiction over 
challenges to voter registration. A person ruled against by 
the county clerk may appeal to the board of registration 
pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. § 11 -26, and an appeal from a 
board of registration decisi
on must be made to the 
intermediate court pursuant to Haw. Rev. Stat. § 11 -51. 
B. Appeal to the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
5
  
 
 
 
  
  
   
   
 On remand, the circuit court issued a writ of quo 
warranto against  Say “to show by what warrant and authority [he 
claimed] title to the office of member of the House of 
Representatives for the Twentieth Representative District.”  
 
  
 
 
                     
    
  
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
The ICA held the circuit court reversibly erred by granting Say’s motion to dismiss. Id. at 235, 325 P.3d at 647. 
Say moved for reconsideration  before the ICA, arguing 
4 for the first time that article III, section 12  of the Hawai i 
Constitution dictates  that the House of Representatives, not the 
circuit court, had  the exclusive jurisdiction  to address the quo 
warranto petition in his case.   The ICA denied the motion 
without comment.  
C. Remand to the Circuit Court 
1. Proceedings on Remand 
On July 18, 2014, the House 
of Representatives moved 
to intervene in the case. Appellants subsequently moved to 
disqualify the Attorney General from representing the House of 
Representatives. Appellants maintained the Attorney General’s 
4 Article III, section 12 of the Hawai i Constitution provides in 
relevant part: 
Each house shall be the judge of the elections, returns and 
qualifications of its own members and shall have, for 
misconduct, disorderly behavior or neglect of duty of any 
member, power to punish such member by censure or, upon a two-thirds vote of all the members to which such house is 
entitled, by suspension or expulsion of such member. 
6
  
 
 representation of the House of Representatives created a 
conflict of interest with the state interest  Appellants assumed 
pursuant to their writ of quo warranto.   Appellants argued  that 
the Attorney General’s client wa s the State of Hawai i, and 
therefore he could  not represent one state interest against  
another without creating a conflict of interest.   The circuit 
court denied the motion  to disqualify the Attorney General.  The 
court explained that the House  of Representatives had its own 
distinct “[c]onstitutionally conferred interest in this 
proceeding” under article III, section 12 of the Hawai i 
Constitution. The court concluded that  because  the parties’ 
interests were distinct and because  Appellants and the House of 
Representatives had their own separate counsel, there was no 
conflict of interest.   
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
At the August 29, 2014 hearing, the  circuit court 
rejected the House  of Representatives’  claim for intervention as 
of right, ruling there was no evidence showing a possible 
impairment of its  ability to protect its interests.  However, 
the court granted the House  of Representatives’  motion to 
intervene on a permissive basis.   The court also rejected 
Appellants’ “law of the case” argument that the ICA’s denial of Say’s motion for reconsideration foreclosed him from making an 
article III, section  12 argument again on remand.  The circuit 
7

  
 
 
court concluded that the article III, section 12 issue was a 
“defense . . . outside of the original appeal” and that the 
“summary denial by the appellate court under these circumstances 
cannot be construed as a decision on the merits of the new  
defense.”  
 
     
  
 
 
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
2. Circuit Court’s Ruling s on Motions to Dismiss 
Say filed two motions to dismiss  Appellants’ petition 
for quo warranto on July 18, 2014.  The first was premised on 
collateral estoppel because earlier challenges to his residency  
were rejected in other forums.  In the  second motion, Say made  
the argument that the House  of Representatives, and not the 
court, was the proper authority to preside over  the quo warranto 
petition per article III, section 12 of the Hawai i Constitution.  
The House 
of Representatives also filed a motion to 
dismiss Appellants’ quo warranto petition on August 29, 2014, 
arguing that article III, section 12 of the Hawai i Constitution 
confers exclusive jurisdiction to judge the qualifications of 
its members upon the House of Representatives, therefore 
rendering the question nonjusticiable by the court. 
At its September 18, 2014 hearing, the circuit court 
orally denied Say’s motion to dismiss based on collateral 
estoppel, concluding the current proceedings involved different issues and parties than those in the prior adjudications. Say’s

  The law of the case doctrine holds that “ a  
determination of a question of law made by an appellate court in 
the course of an action becomes the law of the case and  may not 
be disputed by a reopening of the question at a later stage of 
the litigation.”   Fought & Co. v. Steel Eng’ g & Erection, Inc., 
87 Hawai i 37, 48-49, 951 P.2d 487, 498-99 (1998) (citation   
omitted). “This doctrine applies to issues that have been 
decided either expressly or by necessary implication.”   Id.   In 
other words, “the usual practice of courts to refuse to disturb 
all prior rulings in a particular case” is referred to as the ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
and the House of Representatives’ motions premised on 
nonjusticiability were heard together. On September 30, 2014, 
the circuit court granted Say ’s and the House of 
Representatives’ motions to dismiss the quo warranto petition. The court ruled that the legitimacy of Say’s qualifications to 
hold office as a representative presented a nonjusticiable 
political question, and accordingly dismissed the quo warranto 
petition. Judgment was entered on October 31, 2014, and 
Appellants appealed to the ICA on November 28, 2014. 
At the ICA, the parties filed applications for 
transfer which were subsequently granted by this court on June 9, 2015.

IV. Discussion 
A.	 The ICA’s Order Denying Say’s Motion for Reconsideration is Not the Law of the Case 
In Hussey I, the ICA held the circuit court had  
jurisdiction to hear petitions for quo w
arranto, stating “[o]ur 
courts have jurisdiction over the interpretation of 
constitutional provisions for the qualification of candidates 
for the house of representatives and of elected representatives 
to serve in that capacity.” 133 Hawai i at 233, 325 P.3d at 645.  
Say subsequently filed a Hawai i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
5 (HRAP) Rule 40 (2000)   motion for reconsideration, making the 
argument that “[t]o the extent the petition is a challenge to 
5 HRAP Rule 40 reads in relevant part: 
Motion for Reconsideration.
  
(b) Contents. The motion shall state with particularity 
the points of law or fact that the moving party contends 
the court has overlooked or misapprehended, together with a 
brief argument on the points raised. The motion shall be supported by a declaration of counsel to the effect that it 
is presented in good faith and not for purposes of delay.

Say’s qualifications to serve as a member of the House of 
Representatives, the House is the judge of his qualifications 
pursuant to Art. III, sec. 12 of the Hawaii Constitution. ” The 
ICA summarily denied Say’s motion without comment. 
On remand before the circuit court, Appellants 
contended the ICA’s denial of Say’s motion for reconsideration precluded him from  raising the article III, section 12 argument 
again because the ICA’s ruling on the issue was the  “law of the 
case.”   Appellants explained that the “law of the case” doctrine 
“posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages of the same case.” 
Christianson v. Colt Indus.  Operating  
Corp., 486 U.S. 800, 816  (1988) (citation   omitted).  In 
Appellants’ view, the ICA’s holding that circuit courts have  
jurisdiction in quo warranto cases and its denial of Say’s motion for reconsideration established that the circuit court, 
and not the House of Representatives, was the proper authority 
to investigate Say’s qu alifications to hold office.  The circuit 
court rejected the argument that the ICA’s denial of Say’s 
motion for reconsideration was the “law of the case,” stating:  
[T]he ICA’s summary denial of Respondent Say’s motion for 
reconsideration cannot be construed as a decision on the 
merits of the Article III, Section 12 jurisdictional 
argument. Such argument was newly raised in the 
reconsideration and was not a part of the trial and 
appellate record before the ICA in Hussey v. Say , supra.     
12
  
 
 
According to Appellants,  the circuit court wrongly interpreted 
the “law of the case” doctrine in concluding that the law of the 
case exists only when there is an express decision on the merits  
of a claim. Appellants maintain the circuit court was precluded from considering Say’s article III, section 12 argument on 
remand where the ICA had formerly decided that  courts have 
jurisdiction over quo warranto petitions.     
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
The “law of the case” doctrine holds that  “a 
determination of a question of law made by an appellate court in 
the course of an action becomes the law of the case and may not 
be disputed by a reopening of the question at a later stage of 
litigation.” Tabieros v. Clark Equip. Co. , 85 Hawai i 336, 352 
n.8, 944 P.2d 1279, 1295 n.8 (1997).  Thus, as the United States 
Supreme Court held, the “law of the case” doctrine “merely 
expresses the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen 
what has been decided.” Christianson , 486 U.S. at 802.  In 
Ditto v. McCurdy, 98 Hawai i 123, 128, 44 P.3d 274, 279 (2002),  
this court held “the law of the case concept applies to single 
proceedings, and operates to foreclose re-examination of decided 
issues either on remand or on a subsequent appeal but does not 
encompass issues presented for decision but left unanswered by 
the appellate court.” An appellate court may decide an issue  
“either expressly or by necessary implication.”  Id.   A question

is decided explicitly or implicitly when it is “specifically 
determined in a prior decision . . . [or] necessarily determined 
to arrive at the decision. ” , 535 N.W.2d 
210, 212 (Mich. Ct. App. 
1995). 
Because Say’s motion for reconsideration was denied 
without comment, the ICA did not explicitly decide the issue of 
whether article III, section 12 of the Hawai i Constitution gives 
the House of Representatives exclusive jurisdiction over 
investigations of the qualifications of its members.  Therefore, 
the question before us is whether the ICA implicitly resolved 
the article III, section 12 issue as a necessary step in 
reaching its conclusion  that “[c]ircuit courts have jurisdiction 
over ‘actions or proceed ings in or in the nature of . . . quo 
6  warranto’” pursuant to HRS § 603-21.7(b).  Hussey I, 133  Hawaii 
at 233-34, 325 P.3d 645  -46.     
6 HRS § 603- 21.7(b) provides in relevant part : 
Nonjury cases. The several circuit courts shall have 
jurisdiction, without the intervention of a jury except as provided by statute, as follows: 
. . . . 
(b) Of actions or proceedings in or in the nature of habeas 
corpus, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, and all other 
proceedings in or in the nature of applications for writs 
directed to courts of inferior jurisdiction, to 
corporations and individuals, as may be necessary to the 
furtherance of justice and the regular execution of the law.

   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
In Hussey I , the ICA considered the language of HRS § 
603-21.7(b) and cases involving challenges to the qualifications 
of county council representatives7 and state trustees.8 133 
Hawaiʻi at 234, 325 P.3d at 646.  These authorities clearly 
establish the general rule that circuit courts have jurisdiction over petitions for quo warranto. However, article III, section 
12 of the Hawai i Constitution states that “each house shall be 
the judge of the . . . qualifications of its own members.” 
Neither HRS § 603-21.7(b) nor the cases the court considered 
raised the issue of whether article III, section 12 supersedes 
the general rule and creates an exception granting the House of 
Representatives jurisdiction over quo warranto petitions 
involving its members. Furthermore, Say did not raise this 
argument to the court until after the ICA issued its opinion. 
Thus, it appears the ICA applied the general rule granting 
circuit courts jurisdiction over petitions for quo warranto 
because it was unaware that a constitutional exception existed 
7 In Dejetley , 122 Hawaii at 266, 226 P.3d at 436, the court 
concluded that a writ of quo warranto “seem[ed] to be an appropriate remedy” 
for the defendant’s alleged violation of section 3 -3 of the Charter of the 
County of Maui residency requirements, which automatically and instantly 
created a forfeiture and vacancy of his office. 
8 In Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. Cayetano , 94 Hawai i 1, 5, 6 P.3d 
799, 803 (2000), the State sought a judicial determination that the Office of Hawaiian Affairs trustees appropriately held their elected offices after the 
U.S. Supreme Court held the trustees’ eligibility requirements to be 
unconstitutional. The Hawai i Supreme Court concluded, “the State should see k 
relief through a quo warranto petition filed pursuant to HRS chapter 659.” 
Id.  at 8, 6 P.3d at 806. 
15
  
 
 
for cases involving legislators.   It follows that, where the ICA 
was uninformed of the   article III, section 12 issue, it could  
not have implicitly decided the constitutional issue  as a 
necessary step in resolving the appeal.  
 
     
   
 
  
 
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Because the ICA neither expressly  nor implicitly 
decided the issue of whether circuit court s have jurisdiction   
over petitions for quo warranto involving House representatives   
in light of article III, section 12 of the Hawai i Constitution,  
its denial of Say’s  motion for reconsideration cannot be  viewed 
as the  “law of the case.”   Moreover,  since this was a new    
argument made on appeal from a motion to dismiss, the  
reinstatement of proceedings  on remand would have allowed and 
did allow Say to present and argue  the issue at the  circuit 
court.   Accordingly, Say was not foreclosed from raising  his  
article III, section 12 argument before the circuit court on 
remand. 
B.	 Representative Say’s Residency Issue Presents a 

Nonjusticiable Political Question
 
On remand from Hussey I, the circuit court concluded 
that the issue of Say’s qualification to hold office constitutes 
a political question and thus is nonjusticiable by the courts. The circuit court accordingly held that the legislature has 
exclusive jurisdiction to judge Say’s qualifications pursuant to 
article III, section 12 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution.  Appellants 
16
  
 
 
maintain the circuit court reversibly erred in reaching this  
conclusion.   They  argue the issue    of Say’s qualification to hold 
office is justiciable  by the courts because HRS  § 659 provides 
judicially discoverable and manageable standards for executing 
quo warranto proceedings  involving political figures  .  
Furthermore, Appellants contend allowing the House of  
Representatives to judge Say’s qualifications to hold office

“Justiciability” is a legal term of art relating to 
the court’s position as one of the three coequal branches of 
government.   It is a doctrine meant to assure that the courts 
“not intrude into areas committed to the other branches of 
government.” Trs.  of Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. Yamasaki , 69 
Haw. 154, 168, 737 P.2d 446, 455 (1987)  (citing Flast v. Cohen ,

Article III, section 1: The legislative power of the State shall 
be vested in a legislature, which shall consist of two houses, a 
senate and a house of representatives. Such power shall extend 
to all rightful subjects of legislation not inconsistent with 
this constitution or the Constitution of the United States.

resolution of a dispute “threatens confrontation with the other 
parts of government  . . . .”   Yamasaki   at 169, 737 P.2d at 455.  
A case involving a nonjusticiable political question must be 
dismissed when there is “a textually demonstrable constitutional 
commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department.” 
Id. at 170, 737 P.2d at 455 (quoting Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 
186, 217 (1962)).   
Generally, circui
t courts have jurisdiction over quo 
warranto petitions. HRS § 603-21.7(b).  However, in this case, 
there is a clear “textually demonstrable constitu tional 
commitment” of the issue to the legislature because article III, 
section 12 explicitly commits the determination of 
qualifications of House members to the House of Representatives 
itself. The legislature, not the court, possesses the authority 
to judge the qualifications of its members. In Harris  v. 
Cooper, 14 Haw. 145, 148 (Haw. Terr. 1902), the court explained 
(. . .continued) 
qualified voters of this State at a general election. The person 
receiving the highest number of votes shall be the governor. In 
case of a tie vote, the selection of the governor shall be 
determined as provided by law. 
Article VI, section 1: The judicial power of the State shall be 
vested in one supreme court, one intermediate appellate court, 
circuit courts, district courts and in such other courts as the 
legislature may from time to time establish. The several courts 
shall have original and appellate jurisdiction as provided by law and shall establish time limits for disposition of cases in 
accordance with their rules.

 that “[t]he very fact that ‘each house shall be the judge of the 
10 elections, returns, and qualifications of its members  is 
sufficient reason why neither the Secretary nor the courts 
should undertake to pass upon the question of the eligibility of 
a candidate” and that “[t] he jurisdiction of each house of the 
legislature is exclusive in such cases. Each branch of the government must respect the prerogatives of each of the others.”    
 
                      
   
  
 
 
 
  
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Courts in other jurisdictions faced with interpreting 
language similar or identical to that of article III, section  12 
of the Hawai i Constitution have held that the legislature, not 
the court, has the power to judge the qualifications of its 
members. In Buskey v. Amos,  310 So.  2d 468, 469 (Ala. 1975), 
the Supreme Court of Alabama rejected a similar quo warranto 
challenge, holding “[i]n view of this constitutional provision 
this court is compelled to hold that it lost jurisdiction of 
this appeal when the appellee  became a member of the State 
11 Senate.”   The Supreme Court of Iowa ruled in State ex rel. 
Turner v. Scott, 269 N.W.2d 828, 832 (Iowa 1978) that the Iowa 
10 The court interpreted the language of the Hawai i Organic Act, 
ch. 339, 31 Stat. 141, § 15 (1900), the predecessor to article III, section 
12 of the Hawai i Constitution. The section reads “[t]hat each house shall be 
the judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of its own memb ers.” 
11 Article IV, section 51 of the Alabama Constitution provides in 
relevant part that “[e]ach house shall choose its own officers and shall 
judge the election, returns, and qualifications of its members.”

Constitution “clearly leaves to the Senate the determination as 
to whether a member is qualified” and t hat the issue is 
“nonjusticiable and improper for judicial resolution.”12 The 
holdings of these courts support our conclusion that, based on  
the plain language of article III, section 12 of the Hawai ʻi  
Constitution and our jurisdiction’s case law, the Hous e of 
Representatives maintains the exclusive authority to determine 
the qualifications  of its members to hold office.   
Appellants cite Ford v. Leithead-Todd , No. CAAP-15-
0000561, 2016 WL 4705136 at *6 (Haw. Ct. App. Sept. 8, 2016),  
for the proposition that the Hawaiʻ i  constitution cannot  grant 
the House of Representatives exclusive authority to review its 
representatives’ qualifications. Appellants maintain that this 
policy would leave the House’s discretion unchecked , thus   
violating the separation of  powers doctrine.   
In Leithead-Todd , the ICA held that the circuit court, 
and not the Mayor or County Council, had jurisdiction over quo warranto proceedings involving a challenge to the Director of 
the Department of Environmental Management’s (Director) 
qualifications to hold office.  Id. at *7.  The Charter of the 
County of Hawaiʻ i (CCH) expressly granted the Mayor authority to 
12   Article III, section 7 of the Iowa Constitution provides that 
“[e]ach house shall choose its own officers, and judge of the qualification, 
election, and return of its own members. A contested election shall be 
determined in such manner as shall be directed by law.”

remove the Director.13 However, the ICA held the Mayor could not 
assess the qualifications of the Director in response to a quo 
warranto inquiry because he had previously approved her 
qualifications when he appointed her Id. According to the ICA, 
granting the Mayor this “unreviewable discretion in determining the qualifications of the Director” would essentially render the 
CCH provisions identifying qualifications for the office of the 
Director meaningless
, leading to an absurd result.  Id. Thus, 
the ICA held that the question of the Director’s qualification 
to hold office must be evaluated by the court, and the CCH could 
not textually commit this authority to the Mayor. Id. 
Following this reasoning, Appellants maintain the 
House of Representatives should not have 
the authority to review 
Say’s qualifications to be a representative because this policy 
would similarly grant the House unfettered review of the qualifications of its members.  However, unlike the Director in 
Leithead, Say was not appointed by the same authority that would 
review his qualifications. He was elected by his constituents, while his qualifications will be reviewed by the House. Thus, 
13 CCH § 6- 10.3 (2010) reads in relevant part: 
The director of environmental management shall be appointed 
by the mayor, confirmed by the council, and may be removed 
by the mayor. The director shall have had a minimum of five years of administrative experience in a related field 
and an engineering degree or a degree in a related field. 
21
  
 
 
the danger of “unreviewable discretion” present in Leithead-Todd  
does not exist here because Say’s qualifications will not be 
14 reviewed by the same individuals who   selected him for office.    
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
                     
   
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Accordingly, the House of Representatives has 
exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether Say satisfied the 
constitutional residency requirements of a sitting House member. 
On this basis, the ruling of the ICA in Hussey I, 133 Hawai i at 
235, 325 P.3d at 647 granting quo warranto jurisdiction is 
overruled. 
C. The Attorney General is Permitted to Represent the House 
of Representatives 
Appellants argue the circuit court erred by denying 
Appellants’ motion to disqualify the office of the Attorney 
General and by concluding it could represent the House of 
Representatives. Appellants base their claim on two arguments. 
First, Appellants maintain the Attorney General may 
represent the legislature as a whole, but is not statutorily 
authorized to represent only the House of Representatives. 
14 In Leithead -Todd, the ICA concluded that allowing the Mayor to 
assess the qualifications of a Director he had appointed would leave the 
Mayor’s discretion unchecked , and therefore the question should be 
adjudicated by the court.  However, the ICA suggested that this holding does 
not extend to situations involving quo warranto writs granted against state 
legislators: In a footnote, the ICA cited the Iowa Supreme Court’s holding in 
Scott
, 269 N.W.2d at 832 that a quo warranto action to remove a state senator 
from office was a political question nonjusticiable by the courts. The ICA’s 
reference to Scott 
implies that its holding in Leithead- Todd  does not apply 
to the issue of a state representative’s qualification to hold office. 
Leithead- Todd, No. CAAP -15-0000561, 2016 WL 4705136 at *9 n.6.

 Citing HRS § 28-4 (2009), Appellants explain that the Attorney 
General is tasked to “give advice and counsel to the heads of 
departments, district judges, and other public officers, in all 
matters connected with their public duties, and otherwise aid 
and assist them in every way requisite to enable them to perform 
their duties faithfully.” A dditionally, per HRS § 26-7 (2009), 
the Attorney General has the responsibility to “ administer and 
render state legal services, including furnishing of written 
legal opinions to the governor, legislature, and such state 
departments and officers as the governor may direct[.]”   
Appellants assert this statutory language should be strictly 
construed because the powers of the Attorney General originate 
from English common law  and  “statutes in derogation of the 
common law must be strictly construed and, where it does not appear that there was a legislative purpose in the statute to 
supersede the common law, the common law applies.”  
Doi v. 
Hawaiian Ins. & Guar. Co., 6 Haw. App. 456, 465, 727  P.2d 884, 
889 (1986). In Appellants ’  view, strict construal of the  
statutory language authorizes the Attorney General   to represent 
the  “legislature” as a whole per HRS § 26-7, but not the House 
of Representatives alone.  
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
HRS § 26-7 instructs that the department of the 
attorney general “shall administer and render state legal 
services, including furnishing of written legal opinions to the  
23

  
 
 governor, legislature, and such state departments and officers  
as the governor may direct  . . . .    
The attorney general shall 
be charged with such other duties and have such authority as 
heretofore provided by common law or statute .” HRS § 26-7  
(emphasis added). We have noted that the common law of this jurisdiction broadly interprets the Attorney General’s powers of 
representation: 
 
  
 
  
Chun v. Bd. of Trs.' of Emps. Ret. Sys. of State of Hawaii, 87 
Hawaii 152, 169, 952 P.2d 1215,    1233  (1998) (quoting Darling 
Apartment Co. v. Springer , 22 A.2d 397, 403 (Del. 1941)).   There 
is no statute or common law rule that expressly restricts  the 
Attorney General to representing the legislature as a whole. 
Accordingly, the Attorney General ’s broad jurisdiction to 
represent the interests of the state includes representation of the House of Representatives  in this case.  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
[I]n addition to those conferred on it by statute, the 
office [of the Attorney General] is clothed with all the 
powers and duties per
taining thereto at common law; and, as 
the chief law officer of the State, the Attorney General, in the absence of express legislative restriction to the contrary, may exercise all such power and authority as the 
public interests may from time to time require. 
Appellants ’ second argument is  that the Attorney 
General’s representation of the House of Representatives created  
a conflict of interest in violation of the Hawai  i Rules of  
Professional Conduct  (HRPC), thus precluding  the Attorney 
General from representing   the House of Representatives  .  
24

  
 
 
Appellants maintain  the Attorney General’s representation of the 
House of Representatives results in a conflict   because the 
Attorney General’s  “client” is the State of Hawaiʻ i, and 
therefore the Attorney General  cannot represent the House of 
Representatives if in so doing the Attorney General’ s office  
takes a position adverse to the general state interest 
Appellants defend  via their writ of quo warranto.   
 
    
  
  
 
  
                     
    
 
     
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Appellants cite 
HRPC Rule 1.7 (b)(3)(1994) in support 
of the proposition that the Attorney General is barred from 
representing one state interest against another. HRPC Rule 1.7 
(b)(3) provides in relevant part that “a lawyer may represent a 
client if . . . the representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by one client against another client 
represented by the lawyer in the same litigation or other 
proceeding before a tribunal.” I n the case at bar, the Attorney 
General does not represent multiple clients. The Office of the Attorney General represents the House of Representatives, and 
Appellants are represented by independent counsel.  HRPC Rule 
1.7 (b)(3) thus does not apply.
15 Therefore, the Attorney 
15 Furthermore, the Attorney General’s duty to protect the public 
interest does not preclude the Office of the Attorney General from 
representing the House of Representatives in this case. The Attorney 
General’s common law duty to protect the public interest is subject to his or 
her definition of what is in the best interests of the state or public at 
large. See Chun, 87 Hawai ʻi at 169, 952 P.2d at 1233. Thus, Appellants ’ writ

General is not disqualified from representing the House of 
Representatives. 
D. 	The Circuit Court Did Not Err in Granting Permissive 
Intervention to the House of Representatives
 
Appellants assert that the circuit c ourt’s grant of 
permissive intervention to the House of Representatives under 
16HRCP Rule 24 constituted reversible error because the circuit 
court lacked any factual basis to grant intervention. 
However, 
Appellants failed to provide any argument or analysis in support 
of this statement in their opening brief. 
Under the Hawai i Rules of Appellate Procedure, points 
not argued may be deemed waived.  HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) (2010  ).  
This court is “not obliged to address matters for which the 
(. . .continued) 
of quo warranto does not ipso facto  establish their position to be in the 
public interest and is not binding upon the Attorney General.    
16 HRCP Rule 24(b) states: 
(a)Permissive Intervention.  Upon timely application anyone 
may be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a 
statute confers a conditional right to intervene; or (2) 
when an applicant’s claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common. When a party to 
an action relies for ground of claim or defense upon any 
statute, ordinance, or executive order administered by an 
officer, agency or governmental organization of the State 
or a county, or upon any regulation order, requirement or 
agreement issued or made pursuant to the statute, ordinance 
or executive order, the officer, agency or governmental 
organization upon timely application may be permitted to 
intervene in the action. In exercising its discretion the 
court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the 
original parties.  
26
  
 
 
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
appellants have failed to present discernible arguments.”  
Exotics Hawai i-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co.,  116 
Hawaii 277, 288, 172 P.3d 1021, 1032 (2007).    
Furthermore, a grant of permissive intervention under 
HRCP Rule 24(b) only requires that “an applicant’s claim or 
defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in 
common.” In this cas e, the House of Representatives and 
Appellants contested the legal question  of whether the courts or 
the legislature possess jurisdiction over quo warranto petitions involving state representatives.   Thus, the House  of 
Representatives’  claim shared a question of law in common with 
the main action of the case, and permissive intervention was 
proper. In exercising its discretion to grant permissive 
intervention, the court  must consider whether the intervention 
will “unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication  of the rights 
of the original parties.”  HRCP Rule 24(b). There is no 
evidence or allegation that the circuit court’s grant of 
permissive intervention caused undue delay or prejudiced the 
adjudication of the rights of the original parties  in this case.  
Therefore, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in granting permissive intervention to the House of 
Representatives.
