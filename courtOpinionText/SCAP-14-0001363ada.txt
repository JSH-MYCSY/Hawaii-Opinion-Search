2 OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
After this court filed its opinion in O’Grady v. 
State, No. SCAP -14-0001363, 2017 WL 2464970 (Haw. June 7, 2017) , 
Michael Patrick O’Grady  and Leiloni O’Grady (collectively, the 
O’Gradys or Petitioners)  moved for an award of attorney’s f ees 
in the amount of $15,842.14 and costs in the amount of 
$4,815.17, pursuant to sections 662-9 and 662 -12 of the Hawai i 
Revised Statutes (HRS) and Hawai ʿi Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 39, against the State of Hawai ʿi (State) and the 
State of Hawaiʿ i Department of Transportation (DOT) 
(collectively, Respondents).   We grant the O’Gradys’ request for 
costs but deny their request for attorney’s fees.  
II. DISCUSSION 
A. Attorney’s fees u nder HRS §§  662-9 and 662- 12 
The O’Gradys  contend that this court has the 
discretion to award attorney ’s fees pursuant to HRS § 662- 9 
(2016) and HRS § 662- 12 (2016).  Respondents oppose the 
O’Gradys’ request for attorney’s fees, arguing th at under HRS § 
662-12, “there must be a judgment in favor of Petitioners 
against the State,” and that “there has been no judgment” in 
this case.  Thus, Respondents assert that the O’Gradys’ request 
for attorney’s fees is “at best, premature.”  Further, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
3 Respondents contend that the fees requested cannot be awarded as 
sanctions because “the State was not the appealing party.”   
Our analysis c ommences with the statutory 
interpretation of HRS § 662- 9 and HRS § 662- 12.  “Statutory 
interpretation is a question of law reviewable de novo.”  Boyd 
v. Haw. State Ethics Comm’n , 138 Hawaii 218, 224, 378 P.3d 934, 
940 (2016).  The established canons of statutory interpretation 
advise us to begin with the plain- language interpretation of the 
provisions of the statute at issue, bearing in mind that 
“implicit in the task of statutory construction is our foremost 
obligation to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the language 
contained in the statute itself.”  Id. (quoting Estate of Roxas 
v. Marcos , 121 Hawaii 59, 66, 214 P.3d 598, 605 (2009)).  A 
court may examine other sources, including a statute’s 
legislative history, in order to “discern the underlying policy 
[that] the legislature sought to promulgate” in the enactment of 
the statute.  State v. Abel , 134 Hawai i 333, 339, 341 P.3d 539, 
545 (2014) (alteration in original) (quoting State v. McKnight , 
131 Hawai i 379, 388, 319 P.3d 298, 307 (2013)). 
HRS § 662- 9 states  as follows:  “In an action under 
this chapter, court costs and fees as set by law may be allowed 
to the prevailing party. ”  HRS § 662- 9 (emphasis added).   HRS § ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
4 662-9 thus allows an award of “fees ,” which includes  attorney’s 
fees.  See Fee, Black’s Law Dictionary  (10th ed. 2014) (defining 
“fee” as “[a] charge or payment for labor or services, esp. 
professional services” and includes “attorney’s fees”).   The 
amount of fees awarded by a court , however, must be determined 
as “set by law.”  HRS § 662 -9.  Accordingly, while HRS § 662- 9 
provides discretionary authority to the courts to award fees to 
the prevailing party, the allowable amount and the manner in 
which such fees is to be calculated are governed by another 
source of law.  See id.  HRS § 662 -12, entitled “Atto rney’s 
fees,” of the State Tort Liability Act is a statute that “ set[s] 
by law” the manner in which attorney’s  fees may be determined 
and awarded by a court under HRS § 662-9.  See State v. 
Alangcas , 134 Hawaii 515, 527, 345 P.3d 181, 193 (2015) (“Laws 
in pari materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall be 
construed with reference to each other.  . . . .” (quoting State 
v. Kamana o, 118 Hawaii 210, 218, 188 P.3d 724, 732 (2008))).  
In pertinent part, HRS § 662- 12 reads as follows: 
The court rendering a judgment for the plaintiff pursuant 
to this chapter . . . may, as a part of such judgment, . . 
. determin e and allow reasonable attorney’ s fees which 
shall not, however, exceed twenty -five per cent of the 
amount recovered and shall be payable out of the judgment 
awarded to the plaintiff; provided that such limitation 
shall not include attorney’s fees and costs that the court 
may award the plaintiff as a matter of its sanctions.  
HRS § 662- 12. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
5 HRS § 662- 12 provides courts with discretionary 
authority to “determine and allow reasonable attorney’s fees,” 
and it also governs the allowable amount of attorney’s fees 
(“twenty-five per cent of the amount recovered ”) and the manner 
in which it may be awarded to the plaintiff ( “payable out of the 
judgment awarded”) subject to an exception (if the fees are “a 
matter of . . . sanctions”) .  HRS § 662
-12.  Reading HRS § 662-
12 in pari materia with HRS § 662- 9, when the plaintiff is the 
prevailing party in a suit brought under the State Tort 
Liability Act, the court rendering a judgment for the plaintiff 
may, pursuant to HRS § 662-12, allow reasonable attorney’s fees 
not to exceed twenty- five percent of the amount recovered and 
payable out of the judgment awarded to the plaintiff.  HRS §§ 
662-9, 662-12.1 
This interpretation i
s supported by Levy v. Kimball, 
51 Haw. 540, 465 P.2d 580 (1970), which interpreted HRS § 662-
12, and by the amendments to HRS § 662 -12 that the legislature 
enacted subsequent to our decision in Levy.  At the time that 
                     
 1 The limitation as to the amount of allowable attorney’s fees and 
the manner in which attorney’s fees may be awarded, however, does not apply 
if such fees are being awarded as sanctions.  We also note that HRS  § 662-12 
applies only when the court is “rendering  a judgment for the plaintiff.”  
Thus, where the State is the prevailing party under HRS § 662 -9, HRS § 662 -12 
does not “set by law” the amount of awardable attorney’s fees or the manner 
in which such fees may be awarded, as this statute only applies to the 
plaintiff; in such a situation, there must be another statute that 
independently “set[s] by law” the attorney’s fees that may be awarded to the 
State as the prevailing party.  See HRS § 662 -9. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
6 Levy was decided, HRS § 662- 12 provided as follows: “ The court 
rendering a judgment for the plaintiff pursuant to this chapter 
. . . may, as a part of such judgment, award,  or settlement, 
determine and allow reasonable attorney’s fees which shall not , 
however, exceed twenty per cent of the amount recovered. ”  51 
Haw. at 543, 465 P.2d at  582 (quoting HRS § 662 -12 (1968)).  The 
State in Levy argued that the phrase “as a part of such 
judgment” in HRS § 662-12 implied that the attorney’s fees 
awarded under the statute would be paid out of th
e judgment, not 
in addition to it.  Id.  Rejecting the argument, this court held 
that “HRS § 662-12 authorizes the trial court to award an 
attorney’s fee up to 20 per cent of the judgment, in addition to 
the judgment and not out of the judgment.”  Id. at 546, 465 P.2d 
at 584. 
After Levy was decided, the legislature amended HRS § 
662-12 in 1979, as follows:  
Attorney ’s fees.  The court rendering a judgment for the 
plaintiff pursuant to this chapter or the attorney general 
making a disposition pursuant to section 662- 11 may, as a 
part of such judgment,  award, or settlement,  determine and 
allow reasonable attorney ’s fees which shall not, however, 
exceed [twenty]  twenty-five per cent of the amount 
recovered and shall be payable out of the judgment awarded 
to the plaintiff; provided that such limitation shall not 
include attorney ’s fees and costs that the court may award 
the plaintiff as a matter of its sanctions .

Reg. Sess. (1979)-- “would have repealed section 662 -12 . . . on

No. 861, in 1979 Senate Journal, at 1389.  The accompanying 
House Standing Committee Report explains:  
Your Committee heard testimony that because the 20% award 
is made over and above the judgment, it is 20% higher than 
would be made against any other defendant.  Your Committee 
feels that there is no reasonable basis for such a 
differentiation and finds that the disallowance of such an 
award is desirable and necessary.  
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 619 , in 1979 House Journal, at 
1434. 
The Senate Standing Committee 
amended the House Draft 
“to make attorney’s fees payable out of judgments awarded to 
plaintiffs, thus treating the problem more directly ,” and this 
change was confirmed by the Conference Committee.3

8 The 1979 amendment and its accompanying committee 
reports reflect that the legislature intended to reverse Levy’s 
holding that fees under HRS § 662-12 would be awarded in 
addition to the judgment.  Thus, the language of HRS § 662- 12, 
as it stands today, permits an award of attorney’s fees, but the 
fee award of the court must not exceed twenty- five percent of 
the amount recovered and must be paid from the proceeds of the 
4judgment, not in addition to it.  
The United States District Court for the District of 
Hawaii recently reached the same result in Kauhako v. S
tate of 
Hawaii Board of Education  Department of Education , Civil No. 13 -
00567 DKW-KJM, 2016 WL 7365206 (D. Haw. Nov. 28, 2016), adopted 
by No. CV 13-00567 DKW- KJM, 2016 WL 7362835 (D. Haw. Dec. 19, 
2016).  After looking at the 1979 amendments to HRS § 662- 12, 
the district court held that the statute permits an award of 
fees payable out of the judgment, not in addition to it.  Id. at 
*5.  Under the circumstances, it declined to award a ttorney’s 
                     
 4 HRS § 662 -12 does not require a court to award attorney’s fees, 
and a decision not to do so  may be particularly appropriate when there is an 
attorney- client fee agreement  exceeding the statutory amount or the presence 
of other reasons not to award fees.  See Kauhako v. State of Haw. Bd. of 
Educ. Dep’t of Educ. , Civil No. 13 -00567 DKW -KJM, 2016 WL 7365206 (D. Haw. 
Nov. 28, 2016), adopted by  No. CV 13- 00567 DKW -KJM, 2016 WL 7362835 (D. Haw. 
Dec. 19, 2016) (recommending that the district court deny attorneys’ fee 
award under HRS § 662 -12 because the award would come out of and not be added 
to the judgment); Viveiros v. State , 54 Haw. 611, 614, 513 P.2d 487, 489 -90 
(1973) (affirming trial court’s denial of awarding attorney ’s fees under  HRS 
§ 662-12).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
9 fees to the plaintiff because doing so would only apportion the 
judgment without “ increas[ing] the net result to the moving 
party.”  
Id. 
  The O’Gradys , on the other hand, suggest an 
interpretation of HRS § 662- 9 that would allow recovery of 
attorney’s fees in full, in addition to the judgment.  According 
to the O’Gradys, so long as they are the “ prevailing part[ies] ” 
within the meaning of that phrase under HRS §
 662-9, they can  
recover the full amount of their attorney’s fees under HRS 
§ 662-9 without regard to the restrictions and limitations in 
HRS § 662-12.  This interpretati on disregards  the words “as set 
by law” in HRS § 662 -9 and the specific provisions in HRS § 662-
12 regarding recovery of attorney’s fees.  In particular, the 
O’Gradys’ interpretation not only  would allow parties to claim 
attorney’s fees in addition  to the judgment, it would also 
circumvent the amount of attorney’s fees that may be awarded by 
a court in suits brought under the State Tort Liability Act.  
Further
, the O’Gradys’ position would bypass  the statutory 
revisions made by the legislature through the 1979 amendment to 
HRS § 662-12.  
The O’Gradys also contend that they can recover the 
full amount of their attorney’s fees “as a sanction” under HRS § 
662-12.  However, the exclusion in HRS § 662- 12 that pertains to 
“sanctions” means that, if sanction s were to be awarded pursuant ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
10 to another legal authority, then it must be specifically 
excluded from the statutory amount that a court may award 
pursuant to HRS § 662- 12.  See HRS § 662- 12.  HRS § 662- 12, by 
itself, does not provide sufficient grounds for awarding 
attorney’s fees “as sanctions ,” and the O’Gradys do not identify 
any authority that would permit this court to award attorney’s 
5fees as sanctions.  
We therefore conclude that HRS § 662- 9 allows a court 
to award attorney’s fees only to the extent p ermitted under HRS 
§ 662-12.  Consequently, we evaluate the O’Gradys’ request for a 
court award of attorney’s fees pursuant to the parameters of HRS 
§ 662-12.6 
                     
 5 This conclusion is supported by the legislative history of the 
1979 amendment to HRS § 662 -12.  The Conference Committee exempted 
“sanctions” from the application of the twenty -five-percent cap and the 
requirement that the attorney’s fees be awarded from the judgment awar ded to 
plaintiffs because “it is necessary that the authority of the court to award 
sanctions against the Attorney General and his staff should not be negated by 
implication.”  Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 62, in 1979 Senate Journal, at 981 —82; 
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 60, in 1979 House Journal, at 1115.  The Conference 
Committee noted that “sanctions are to be allowed similarly as against all 
other party litigants whenever unreasonable conduct by the Attorney General 
or his staff is deemed by the court to have unfairly required accrual of 
attorney’s fees and costs by the opposing party.”  Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 62, 
in 1979 Senate Journal, at 981 —82; Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 60, in 1979 House 
Journal, at 1115.  Thus, the legislature, in amending HRS § 662 -12, 
recognized that the courts already had a preexisting power to impose 
sanctions pursuant to various other laws, and the exception for “sanctions” 
included in the 1979 amendment to HRS § 662 -12 simply acknowledged that power 
and structurally conformed HRS § 662 -12 with that  power so that the statute 
would not conflict or implicitly negate that power.  HRS § 662 -12, therefore, 
did not create an independently sufficient authority for a court to award 
attorney’s fees as sanctions.  
 6 The holding in this case is based upon our analysis of HRS §§ 
662-9 and 662- 12 and does not address other statutory provisions or 
applicable law allowing an award of attorney’s fees  against the State . ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
11 B. The O’Gradys’  request for recovery of  attorney’s fees under 
HRS §§ 662 -9 and 662- 12 is premature  
  As discussed, in a suit brought under the State Tort 
Liability Act, HRS §§ 662- 9 and 662 -12 permit a “court rendering 
a judgment for the plaintiff” to “determine and allow reasonable 
attorney’s fees” to the “prevailing ” plaintiff , but the fees 
awardable by a court may not exceed  twenty-five per cent of the 
amount that the plaintiff recovered and must be paid “out of the 
judgment awarded to the plaintiff.”  HRS §§ 662 -9 (2016), 662 -12 
(2016). 
Accordingly, the first issue for this court to address 
regarding the O’Gradys’ request for attorney’s fees is whether 
this court’s judgment on appeal in  O’Grady v. State , No. SCAP-
14-0001363, 2017 WL 2464970 (Haw. June 7, 2017), is a “judgment 
for” the O’Gradys under HRS § 662- 12.  Generally, “[a] judgment 
is the final action of a court, which disposes of the matter 
before it.”  Inter-Island Resorts, Ltd. v. Akahane , 44 Haw. 93, 
96, 352 P.2d 856, 859 (1960); accord Final Judgment , Black’s Law 
Dictionary  (10th ed. 2014 ) (defining “ final judgment” as “[a] 
court’s last action that settles the rights of the parties and 
disposes of all issues in controversy” ). 
We have discu ssed the concept of a judgment “for”  a 
party, as a requirement for fee- shifting, in Nelson v. 
University  of Hawai i, 99 Hawaii 262, 54 P.3d 433 (2002).  In ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
12 Nelson, the petitioner sought appellate attorney’s fees pursuant 
to HRS § 378-5(c) (1993),7 after this court vacated a circuit 
court judgment favoring the defendant university and remanded 
the case for a new trial.  Id. at 264, 54 P.3d at 435.  HRS § 
378-5(c) directs an award of attorney’s fees for “any judgment 
awarded” to an employment discrim ination plaintiff.  HRS § 378-
5(c).  After looking to HRS § 378-5 as a whole, the  Nelson court 
held that “the phrase ‘judgment awarded to the plaintiff’  refers 
generally to favorable relief or damages that follow as a result 
of a finding that the defendant engaged in discriminatory 
practice.”  Nelson , 99 Hawaii at 266, 54 P.3d at 437.  
Consequently, this court denied the request for at torney’s fees  
because the judgment on appeal “merely vacate[d] a trial court 
judgment unfavorable to the plaintiff and 
place[d] the plaintiff 
back where [she] started. ”  Id. 
HRS § 662- 12 is substantially similar to HRS § 378-
5(c), the fee-shifting statute at issue in Nelson.  Read as a 
whole, HRS § 662-12 provides that an award of attorney’s fees 
may be paid out of (1) “a judgment for the plaintiff, ” or (2) an 
                     
 7 HRS § 378 -5(c) provides as follows:  
 In any action brought under this part, the court, in 
addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff or plaintiffs, 
shall allow costs of action, including costs of fees of any 
nature and reasonable attorney ’s fees, to be paid by the 
defendant.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
13 “award” or “settlement”  pursuant to alternative resolution of 
the case under HRS § 662- 11 (2016).8  All of these dispositions 
of a case involve the payment of damages to the plaintiff 
pursuant to a determination (or admission) that the State is 
liable in tort.  The language of HRS § 662- 12 thus indicates 
that “a judgment for the plaintiff ” must, at minimum, order 
payment of damages or other favorable relief in favor of the 
plaintiff.  See Nelson , 99 Hawaii at 266, 54 P.3d at 437. 
In this case, the judgment on appeal will vacate the 
circuit court’s judgment and remand the case  for further 
proceedings.  We stated in our opinion that the circuit court 
“misapprehended the relevant  standard for evaluating legal 
causation” and clarified the correct test.  O’Grady
, 2017 WL 
2464970, at *1.  Accordingly, we instructed the circuit court to 
determine, on remand, “whether the State’s breach of its duty 
was the legal cause . . . of the O’Gradys’ injuries”  by applying 
the analytical standard set forth in our opinion.  Id.  at *13.  
It follows that we did not ourselves determine the question of 
                     
 8 HRS § 662 -11 provides: 
 (a) The attorney general may arbitrate, compromise, 
or settle any claim cognizable under this chapter.  
 (b) Claims arbitrated, compromised, or settled by the 
attorney general for $10,000 or less shall be paid from the 
state risk management  revolving fund.  Claims arbitrated, 
compromised, or settled by the attorney general for more 
than $10,000 shall be paid only after funds are 
appropriated by the legislature for the payment of those 
claims. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
14 legal causation.  Neither did we resolve whether the O’Gradys 
had established their negligence claim against the State nor 
order the State to pay damages to the O’Gradys .  Like the 
plaintiff in  Nelson, our judgment in this case merely returns 
the O’Gradys to a prior position in the proceedings, and the 
judgment therefore “ does not, in itself, provide any grounds for 
an award of fees” to the O’Gradys.  Nelson, 99 Hawaii at 266, 54 
P.3d at 437.  Thus, we hold that the O’Gradys ’ request for 
attorney’s fees under HRS § 662 -12 is premature because there 
9has been no judgment for the O’Gradys  in this case.   See id. 
C. Appellate c osts pursuant to HRAP Rule 39 
The O’Gradys argue that they are entitled to costs 
pursuant to HRAP Rule 39.  The O’Gradys maintain  that, when  a 
judgment is vacated, HRAP Rule 39(a) enables courts to tax costs 
at their discretion, that HRAP Rule 39(d) enables courts to tax 
costs against the State “if an award of costs is authorized by 
                     
 9 Because, at the outset, we conclude that the request for  
attorney’s fees is premature, it is not necessary to consider arguments 
regarding the quantum or reasonableness of fees to which the O’Gradys contend 
they are entitled.  Similarly, we do not need to resolve Respondents’ 
argument pertaining to th e applicability of this court’s opinion in DFS Group  
L.P. v. Paiea Properties , which held “that the twenty -five per cent limit [in 
HRS § 607- 14] does not apply in cases that involve ‘only an adjudication of

131 P.3d 500, 504 (2006) (quoting Food Pantry, Ltd. v. Waikiki Bus. Plaza, 
Inc., 58 Haw. 606, 621, 575 P.2d 869, 880 (1978)).  Finally, the O’Gradys 
assert that, since the ultimate damage award is unknown at this stage, any 
attorney’s fees immediately awarded would be an offset from the fees 
ultimately awarded.  The O’Gradys do not provide any authority to support 
this contention, and we do not address it in light of our disposition.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
15 law,” and that HRAP Rule 39(c) provides a definition for 
“appellate costs.”  
Respondents, on the other hand, assert that HRAP Rule 
39(b), which governs “Costs for and a gainst the State of 
Hawaiʿi,” applies in this case  rather than HRAP Rule 39(a).  
Therefore, Respondents argue that “there must be some other law 
authorizing costs against the State under the circumstances.”  
Respondents then note that the O’Gradys “ do not cite to any 
specific law that expressly authorizes the award of costs 
against the State.”  In the alternative, if the court holds that 
HRAP Rule 39(a) applies, Respondents request this court to 
decline to award appellate costs b ecause “[i]n this case 
[Respondents] neither participated in inappropriate conduct 
below nor filed a frivolous appeal.”   
The construction of a court rule is subject to de novo 
review.  In re Ishida-Waiakamilo Legacy Tr., No. SCWC -13-
0000449, 2017 WL 2590870, at *4 (Haw. June 15, 2017).  HRAP Rule 
39(b) provides: 
 (b) Costs for and against the State of Hawai ʿi.  In 
cases involving the State of Hawai ʿi or an agency or officer 
thereof, if an award of costs against the State is 
authorized by law, costs shall be awarded in accordance 
with the provisions of this Rule; otherwise costs shall not 
be awarded for or against the State of Hawai ʿi, its 
agencies, or  its officers acting in their official 
capacities.  
HRAP Rule 39(b) (2016).   Therefore, as to costs, the first issue 
is whether the O’Gradys have identified a law that  authorizes an ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
16 award of costs against the State of Hawai ʿi.  If so, HRAP Rule 
39(b) directs that the provisions of HRAP Rule 39 apply as they 
ordinarily would.  See Oahu Publ’ns, Inc. v. Abercrombie , 134 
Hawaiʿi 16, 24 n.5, 332 P.3d 159, 167 n.5 (2014) (holding that 
HRAP Rule 39(a) would apply where requesting party cited statute 
authorizing recovery of “reasonable attorney’s fees and all 
other expenses” ).  
The O’Gradys  seek costs pursuant to HRS § 662- 9, which 
states that, “[i]n an action under [the State Tort Liability 
Act], court costs and fees as set by law may be allowed to the 
prevailing party.”  HRS § 662 -9 (2016).  Respondents challenge 
the source of authority that the O’Gradys identified, arguing  
that HRS § 662- 9 does not itself permit an award of costs 
against the State but merely implies that “there must be  some 
other law” authorizing the award of such costs.  Respondents 
argue that , since the O’Gradys do not cite any such law,  costs 
should not be awarded. 
Under HRAP Rule 39(b), costs must be “authorized by 
law.”  HRAP Rule 39(b) reiterates the general rule that costs 
cannot be awarded against the State of Hawai ʿi unless there is a 
“clear relinquishment ” of the State’s sovereign immunity.  See 
Nelson v. Hawaiian Homes Comm’ n, 130 Hawai i 162, 168, 307 P.3d 
142, 148 (2013) (“[A]n award of costs and fees to a prevailing 
party is inherently in the nature of a damage award.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
17 Accordingly, to properly award . . . costs against [the State] . 
. ., there must be ‘a clear relinquishment’  of the State’s 
immunity in this case. ” (first and third alterations in 
original) (footnote omitted) (citation omitted)).   Thus, there 
must be a law that clearly relinquishes the State’s sovereign 
immunity from court costs and authorizes 
an award of such costs.  
HRAP Rule  39(b); Nelson , 130 Hawai
i at 168, 307 P.3d at  148. 
This court has previously established “that the State 
has waived immunity to suit . . . to the extent as specified in 
HRS chapter[] . . . 662.”  Nelson, 130 Hawai i at 169, 307 P.3d 
at 149 (footnote omitted) (quoting  Taylor–Rice v. State , 105 
Hawaii 104, 110, 94 P.3d 659, 665 (2004)).  The plain language 
of HRS § 662- 9 specifically grants a court discretion to award 
“court costs . . . as set by law . . . to the prevailing party.”  
Thus, HRS § 662-9 clearly relinquishes the State’s immunity from 
court costs awardable to prevailing parties in suits brought 
under the State Tort Liability Act.  Id.  As such, HRS § 662- 9 
“authorize[s] by law” the award of court costs under HRAP Rule  
39(b). 
Respondents misapprehend the plain language of HRS § 
662-9 in arguing that HRS § 662- 9, by itself, is not sufficient 
to “authorize by law” the award of costs under HRAP  Rule 39(b).  
Contrary to Respondents’ position, the phrase “as set by law” in ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
18 HRS § 662-9 is not fundamentally equivalent to the phrase “as 
authorized by law” in HRAP Rule 39(b).  
As relevant to this case, the ordinary signification 
of the word “authorize”  is “[t]o give legal authority” or “to 
empower.”  Authorize , Black’s Law Dictionary  
(10th ed. 2014); 
see State v. Guyton , 135 Hawai i 372, 378, 351 P.3d 1138, 1144 
(2015) (“In conducting a plain meaning analysis, ‘this court may 
resort to legal or other well accepted dictionaries as one way 
to determine the ordinary meaning of certain terms not 
statutorily defined.’” (quoting State v. Pali, 129 Hawai i 363, 
370, 300 P.3d 1022, 1029 (2013))).  In contrast, to “set” means 
“to fix or decide on as a time, limit, or regulation” ; “to fix 
10 at a certain amount” ;to “[p]ut or bring into a specified 
11state”; or to “[f] ix (a price, value, or limit) on something.”  
  Thus, while HRAP Rule 39(b) requires some law that 
gives legal authority or empowers an appellate court to award 
costs to a plaintiff who prevails in a suit brought under the 
State Tort Liability Act, HRS § 662-9 provides that the quantum 
of costs that may be awarded under the statute must be regulated 
and fixed by law and 
may not exceed the limits to the amount

19 that the applicable law prescribes .  Therefore , HRS § 662- 9 
fulfills the requirement in HRAP Rule 39(b) that “an award of 
costs against the State is authorized by law,” but the manner in 
which costs is computed and awarded is
 informed and regulated by 
other applicable law.  HRS § 662 -9; HRAP Rule 39(b). 
Further, reading HRS § 662- 9 in pari materia with HRAP 
Rule 39(b), the provisions of Rule 39 “set[s] by law” --i.e., 
regulates and limits-- the amount of costs that can be awarded to 
a prevailing plaintiff in a suit brought under the State Tort 
Liability Act.  HRS § 662
-9; HRAP Rule 39(b).  HRAP Rule 39(b) 
states that “if an award of costs against the State is 
authorized by law, costs shall be awarded in accordance with the 
provisions of this Rule .”  Because HRS § 662- 9 “authorize[s] by 
law” the award of costs in this case, the  provisions of HRAP 
Rule 39 control the amount of awardable costs and the 
evidentiary burden that must be satisfied in order to be 
entitled to such costs.  HRAP Rule 39(b).  This is consistent 
with our conclusion that the phrase “as set by law” in HRS § 
662-9 means that the computation and amount that may be awarded 
as costs against the State must be limited by other governing 
law, which, in this case, are the relevant provisions of HRAP 
Rule 39. 
This interpretation is further supported by the 
decision in E ducators Ventures, Inc. v. Bundy , 3 Haw. App. 435, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
20 652 P.2d 637 (1982).  Pursuant to HRS § 467-16 (1976), the 
circuit court in that case ordered the payment of $10,000 from 
the real estate recovery fund to each of the plaintiffs for 
damages, court costs an d fees, and attorney’s fees.  Id. at 436 —
37, 652 P.2d at 638.  HRS § 467- 16 provided that persons 
aggrieved by the acts of a licensed real estate broker or 
salesman  
may recover by order of the circuit court or district court 
of the county where the violation occurred, an amount of 
not more than $10,000 for damages sustained by the fraud, 
misrepresentation, or deceit, including court costs and 
fees as set by law , and reasonable attorney fees as 
determined by the court.  
HRS § 467-16 (emphasis added).  The ICA affirmed the circuit 
court’s award and held that the 10,000 -dollar limit in HRS § 
467-16 applied not only to damages and court costs and fees, it 
applied equally to attorney’s fees.  Educators Ventures, Inc. , 3 
Haw. App. at 437, 652 P.2d at 638.  
Although the phrase “set by 
law” appears in HRS § 467 -16, the ICA affirmed the circuit 
court’s award and did not look to other statutes or legal 
authority that would independently permit the circuit court’s 
award to the plaintiffs.  See  id. at 437—41, 652 P.2d at 638 —40.  
Implicit in the ICA’s opinion is that HRS § 467 -16 sufficed to 
empower the circuit court to render an award that included 
“court costs and fees as set by law.”  See id.  This is 
consistent with our determination in this case that HRS § 662- 9 
provides authority to this court to award costs and that the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
21 phrase “as set by law” does not mean that another statute or 
legal source must independently allow for the award of costs 
against the State.  We therefore conclude that HRS § 662 -9 
“authorize[s] by law” the award of costs against Respondents in 
this case, and the amount of awardable costs and the manner in 
which such costs can be awarded are “set by law” by the 
provisions of HRAP Rule 39. 
In light of the foregoing, we proceed to the 
determination of  whether the O’Gradys  are entitled to costs 
pursuant to HRAP Rule 39(b) and HRS § 662- 9.  Under HRS § 662- 9, 
“costs . . . may be allowed to the prevailing party.”   HRS § 
662-9’s requirement is mirrored by the intent underlying HRAP 
Rule 39: “to allow the party prevailing on appeal  to recover 
those costs reasonably incurred in prosecuting the appeal.”  Jou 
v. Argonaut Ins. Co
., 133 Hawaii 471, 477, 331 P.3d 449, 455 
(2014) (quoting Leslie v. Estate of Tavares , 93 Hawaii 1, 7, 994 
P.2d 1047, 1053 (2000)).  Thus, the O’Gradys  may be awarded 
costs only if they are the prevailing party in their appeal to 
this court.  Nelson , 130 Hawaii at 165, 307 P.3d at 145 (“The 
first step in analyzing whether Plaintiffs are entitled to 
attorneys’ fees (and costs) is to determine whether they are the 
‘prevailing party.’”) .  The O’Gradys argue that they prevailed 
on the main disputed issue in the appeal-- “whether the cir cuit ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
22 court erred in deciding that the State was not the cause of the 
O’Grady’s [sic] injuries” --because this court vacated the 
circuit court’s judgment in favor of the State on the issue of 
causation.  Hence, the O’Gradys assert that they were the 
“prevailing party” in the appeal and are entitled to costs under 
HRS § 662-9.   
“The ‘prevailing party’  is the one who “prevail s on 
the disputed main issue. ”  Nelson, 130 
Hawaii at 165, 307 P.3d 
at 145 (quoting  Food Pantry, Ltd. v. Waikiki Bus. Plaza, Inc. , 
58 Haw. 606, 620, 575 P.2d 869, 879 (1978)).  In determining 
which party prevailed on the disputed main issu
e on appeal, a 
court can compare the relief sought with the relief awarded.  
Jou, 133 Hawai i at 477, 331 P.3d at 455.  But “[e]ven  if the 
party does not prevail ‘ to the extent of his original 
contention, he will be deemed to be the successful party for the 
purpose of taxing costs. ’”  Nelson, 130 Hawai i at 165, 307 P.3d 
at 145 (quoting Food Pantry, Ltd. , 58 Haw. at 620, 575 P.2d at 
879). 
The disputed main issues  on appeal  were (1) wheth er 
“the circuit court erred in holding that the State’s breach of 
its duty of care was not a legal cause of the [ O’Gradys’ ] 
injuries” and (2) whether the discretionary function exception 
applied in this case.  
O’Grady v. State , No. SCAP -14-0001363, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
23 2017 WL 2464970, at *1  (Haw. June 7, 2017).  This court held 
that the circuit court “misapprehended the relevant standard for 
evaluating legal causation, ” id., by requiring the O’Gradys to 
prove factual and legal matters that are  not relevant to 
determining the existence of legal causation,  id. at *9 —13.  
Additionally, we held that “the State ha[d] not established that 
it [was] relieved from liability under the discretionary 
function exception with regard to the duty recognized by the 
circuit court.”  Id.  at *17.  Thus, we vacated the second 
amended judgment and remanded the case to the circuit court for 
further proceedings consistent with the opinion.  Id. at *18. 
In light of the issues raised on appeal, our 
conclusions with respect to each of them,  and our disposition in 
12 this case, the O’Gradys  were the “prevailing part[ies].”  See 
Nelson, 130 Hawai i at 166, 307 P.3d at  146 (concluding that the 
plaintiffs were the prevailing parties because this court held 
that “the political question doctrine did not bar determination” 
of certain substantive issues underlying the case, affirming on 
                     
 12 The relief that the O’Gradys requested was for this court to 
“reverse the circuit court’s judgment in favor of the State, and render 
judgment in the O’Gradys’ favor.”  This court, on the other hand, vacated the 
judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings.  The fact that the 
relief requested and the relief awarded are not the same does not change the 
conclusion that the O’Gradys were the prevailing parties on appeal: the 
vacatur of the circuit court’s judgment, although short of what the O’Gradys 
requested, is still favorable for the O’Gradys.  Nelson, 130 Hawai i at 165, 
307 P.3d at  145. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
24 narrower grounds the ICA’s vacatur of the circuit court’s 
decision predicated on the political question doctrine).  
Having concluded that  HRS § 662- 9 authorizes the award 
of costs against the State in this case and that the O’Gradys  
are the prevailing parties under HRS § 662- 9, we now determine 
the amount of costs that can be awarded “in accordance with the 
provisions of . . . Rule [39].”  HRAP Rule 39(b).   Because this 
court vacated the circuit court’s judgment and remanded the case 
for further proceedings, the amount that may be awarded to the 
O’Gradys is set by law in HRAP Rule 39(a):  “if a judgment . . . 
is vacated, . . . the costs shall be allowed only as ordered by 
the appellate court. ”  In situations w here the circuit court’s 
judgment is vacated, “courts have routinely ordered an award of 
appellate costs to the party that prevailed on the main disputed 
issue on appeal.”  Jou, 133 Hawai i at 479, 331 P.3d at 457.  
Costs, for the purposes of Rule 39, include “ the cost 
of the original and one copy of the reporter’s transcripts if 
necessary for the determination of the appeal; . . .  the fee for 
filing the appeal; [and] the cost of printing or otherwise 
producing necessary copies of briefs and appendices, provided 
that copying costs shall not exceed 20¢ per page .”  HRAP Rule 
39(c).  In substantia ting a request for costs, “ where 
appropriate, copies of invoices, bills, vouchers, and receipts ” 
shall be attached as support.  HRAP Rule 39(d)(1) . ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
25 Insofar as Respondents do not make “a specific 
objection” to the O’Gradys’ itemized cost request --and the State 
in fact asks this court to award the full amount of requested 
costs if we find that the O’Gradys are entitled to costs --we 
grant in full the costs that the O’Gradys request in the amount 
13of $4,815.17.   Wong v. Takeuchi , 88 Hawai i 46, 53, 961 P.2d 
611, 618 (1998) (“Unless there is a specific objection to an 
expense item, the court ordinarily should approve the item.”

III.  CONCLUSION 
In a suit brought under the State Tort Liability Act, 
the authority of the court to award attorney’s fees to a 
prevailing plaintiff under HRS § 662- 9 is defined and bounded by 
the provisions of HRS § 662- 12.  The O’Gradys’ request for 
attorney’s fees is pr emature under HRS §§ 662- 9 and 662- 12 
                     
 13 The costs that the O’Gradys  seek consist of (1) $4,416.36 for 
thirteen transcripts, all of which were “necessary for the determination of 
the appeal” as they contain relevant testimony from witnesses at the trial 
pertinent to this court’s holding on the merits of this case, see HRAP Rule 
39(c), and supported by invoices for the transcripts and the corresponding 
checks that their counsel paid , see HRAP Rule 39(d)(1); (2) filing fees in 
the amount of $315.00, which are allowed under HRAP Rule 39(c)(3); and (3) 
photocopying costs in the  amount of $86.81, which is allowed and complies 
with the 20  cents per page  limitation under HRAP Rule 39(c)( 4). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
26 because there has been no “judgment for” them within the meaning 
of that phrase in HRS § 662- 12.  As to costs, we conclude that 
HRS § 662-9 authorizes by law the award of fees to a prevailing 
plaintiff but that the awardable amount, the manner in which the 
amount may be requested and the award made, and the 
documentation necessary to support the request are governed by 
the relevant provisions of HRAP Rule 39.  We award the O’Gradys 
costs in the amount of $4,815.17 pursu
ant to HRS § 662- 9 and 
HRAP Rule 39 because the O’Gradys were the “prevailing party on 
appeal,” and the State did not lodge specific objections to any 
of the expense items included in t he O’Gradys’ request for 
costs.
