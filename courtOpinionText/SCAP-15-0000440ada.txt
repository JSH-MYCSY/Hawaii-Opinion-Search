2 the charges against him.  The motions sought to preclude a third 
trial in this case based on  federal and state constitutional 
grounds, state statutory provisions, and the inherent power of 
the trial court.  We affirm.  
I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
  In the course of their altercation on November 5, 
2011, Christopher Deedy fatally shot Kollin Elderts  (the 
deceased) at a fast food restaurant in Waik īkī.  Deedy was 
indicted by a grand jury on November 16, 2011, charging him with 
murder in the second degree ( Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS ) §§ 
706-656 (1993 & Supp. 1996) and  707-701.5 (1993)) and carrying 
or use of firearm in the commission of a separate felony (HRS § 
134-21 (Supp. 2006)).  The first trial was conducted  from July 
to August 2013.  At the settling of the jury instructions, the 
circuit court noted that both parties had asked that a 
manslaughter instruction not be given and indicated that,  from 
what the court recalled,  it “didn’t think there was any evidence 
to support manslaughter anyway.”  The circuit court thereafter 
instructed the jury only on the charged offenses.  The jury was 
deadlocked and unable to reach a verdict, and the circuit court 
found manifest necessity to declare a mistrial.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
3 1  A second trial was conducted a year later.   At the 
close of the evidence, the parties objected to submitting 
instructions on the included offenses of reckless manslaughter, 
assault in the first degree, and assault in the second degree on 
the grounds that there was no evidentiary basis to instruct on 
these offenses.  The circuit court overruled the parties’ 
objection and concluded that there was a rational basis in the 
evidence to give jury instructions on reckless manslaughter and 
the assault offenses.  After six and a half days of 
deliberation, the jury acquitted Deedy of second-degree murder.   
The jury was deadlocked on all of the included offenses.  The 
circuit court thereafter entered a not guilty verdict on the 
second-degree murder count and concluded that Deedy could be 
retried on the included offenses on which the second jury was 
hung. 
  On November 26, 2014, Deedy filed a motion to dismiss 
the case under the United States Constitution, a motion to 
dismiss under State v. Moriwake , 65 Haw. 47, 647 P.2d 705 
(1982), a motion to dismiss under the Hawai i Constitution, and a 
motion to dismiss under HRS §§ 701 -109 to 701- 111.  The State 
opposed Deedy’s dismissal motions.  After Deedy filed an omnibus 
                     
 1 The Honorable Karen S.S. Ahn  presided  over both trials.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
4 reply, the circuit court conducted a hearing on the motions.  At 
the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court orally ruled 
against Deedy on his motion to dismiss brought p ursuant to 
Moriwake and later issued a written order denying the motion 
that set forth findings of facts and conclusions of law.  The 
circuit court, by minute order, also denied Deedy’s other 
dismissal motions and later issued written orders denying these 
motions. 
  The circuit court approved Deedy’s request to file an 
interlocutory appeal of the court’s denial of Deedy’s dismissa l 
motions.  Deedy  timely filed a notice of appeal, and the appeal 
was transferred to this court. 
II. ARGUMENTS ON APPEAL 
  Deedy contends that a third trial in his case is 
barred based on multiple grounds: (1) principles of double 
jeopardy under the state and federal constitutions; (2) 
statutory provisions under the Hawaii Penal Code that preclude 
further prosecution; (3) the circuit court’s abuse of its 
discretion in failing to exercise its inherent authority to 
dismiss the case with prejudice; and (4) his immunity from State 
prosecution under the Supremacy Clause of the federal 
constitution.  Deedy urges this court to vacate the circuit 
court’s orders, hold one or more of his constitutional or other 
claims meritorious, and remand this case for entry of dismissal ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
5 with prejudice.  The State counters that Deedy’s arguments  are 
without merit and also contends that Deedy has waived  his claims 
by raising them in an untimely manner. 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Double Jeopardy 
  Whether double jeopardy principles require the 
dismissal of a criminal charge is “a question of constitutional 
law that we review under the right/wrong standard o f review.”  
State v. Deguair , 136 Hawai i 71, 85, 358 P.3d 43, 57 (2015) 
(quoting State v. Toyomura , 80 Hawai i 8, 15, 904 P.2d 893, 900 
(1995)).   
B. Statutory Construction 
  Statutory construction “presents questions of law that 
are reviewed de novo under t he right/wrong standard.”  State v.  
King, 139 Hawai i 249, 253, 386 P.3d 886, 890 (2016) (quoting 
State v. Lei, 95 Hawai i 278, 281, 21 P.3d 880, 883 (2001)). 
C. Moriwake  Analysis 
  A trial court’s application of State v. Moriwake  to a 
motion to dismiss an indictment is reviewed for an abuse of 
discretion.  See State v. Hinton , 120 Hawai i 265, 278 —80, 204 
P.3d 484, 498— 99 (2009).   
The trial court abuses its discretion when it clearly 
exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment 
of a party litigant.  The burden of establishing abuse of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
discretion is on appellant, and a strong showing is 
required to establish it.  
State v. Deguair , 136 Hawai i 71, 84–85, 358 P.3d 43, 56–57  
(2015) (quoting Hinton, 120 Hawai i at 273, 204 P.3d at 492) .  
6 D. Supremacy Clause Immunity 
  “Supremacy Clause immunity dismissals present a mixed 
question of law and fact and are reviewed de novo. ”  Wyoming v.  
Livingston , 443 F.3d 1211, 1226 (10th Cir. 2006).   
IV. DISCUSSION 
A. Waiver and Forfeiture 
  As a preliminary matter, the State asserts that Deedy 
has waived or forfeited claims based upon his double jeopardy 
and federal immunity motions 
because the motions were filed well 
after the conclusion of the second trial.   As support for its 
position, the State relies upon Hawai i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP) Rule 12 (2015), which provides,  inter ali a, that motions 
regarding “defenses and objections based on defects in the 
institution of the prosecution ” must be raised prior to trial 
and “within 21 days after arraignment unless the court otherwise 
2directs.”  HRPP Rule 12(b) (1), (c) (emphasis added).   Failure by 
                     
 2 HRPP Rule 12 provides, in relevant part:  
      (b) Pretrial motions.  Any defense, objection, or 
request which is capable of determination without the trial 
of the general issue may be raised before trial by motion.  
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
7 a party to file pretrial motions in compliance with subsections 
(b) and (c) of HRPP Rule 1 2 “shall constitute waiver thereof ,” 
subject to the court’s authority to “grant relief from the 
waiver.”  HRPP Rule 12(f).  
  HRPP Rule 12(b)(1), however, does not apply in this 
case because the second retrial was not an “institution of [a] 
prosecution.”  “A prosecution is commenced either when an 
indictment is found or a complaint filed, or when an arrest 
warrant or other process is issued, provided that such warrant 
or process is executed without unreasonable delay .”  HRS § 701 -
108(5) (1993 & Supp. 2006).  Thus, a retrial is a continuation 
of a prosecution that was already instituted, State v. Mundon , 
129 Hawai i 1, 14 n.22, 292 P.3d 205, 219 n.22 (2012) (citing 
United States v. Bailin , 977 F.2d 270, 276 (7th Cir. 1992)),  and 
HRPP Rule 12(b)(1) is accordingly not applicable to a retrial. 
                                                                        
(. . . continued) 
 
Motions may be written or oral at the discretion of the 
judge.  The following must be raised prior to trial:  
      (1) defenses and objections based on defects in the 
institution of the prosecution;  
. . . . 
      (c) Motion date.  Pretrial motions and requests must 
be made within 21 days after arraignment unless the court 
otherwise directs.  
. . . . 
      (f) Effect of failure to raise defenses or 
objections.  Failure by a party to raise defenses or 
objections or to make requests which must be made prior to 
trial, within the time set by the court pursuant to section 
(c), or within any extension thereof made by the court, 
shall constitute waiver thereof, but the court for cause 
shown may grant relief from the waiver.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
8   Further underscoring the rule’s inapplicability is its 
requirement that “[p]retrial motions and requests must be made 
within 21 days after arraignment unless the court otherwise 
directs.”  HRPP Rule 12(c).  Arraignment tak es place at the 
commencement of a prosecution, and no new arraignment is had 
after a mistrial and before a retrial.  See HRPP Rule 5(b) 
(2008); HRPP Rule 10 (2008).  It would therefore not be possible 
to comply with the HRPP Rule 12(b)(1) deadline for pretrial 
motions if its requirements were imposed on motions concerning 
issues relating to a retrial.  Accordingly, HRPP Rule 12(b)(1)  
does not apply to motions filed with respect to a retrial,  and 
we therefore consider the merits of all the contentions that 
Deedy has asserted in his appeal . 
B. Double Jeopardy Principles Under the State and Federal 
Constitutions 
  Deedy contends that a third trial is barred by the 
double jeopardy clauses of article I, section 10 of the Hawai i 
3Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.   
The double jeopardy clause of the State and federal 
constitutions “ forbid[] a second trial for the purpose of 
affording the prosecution another opportunity to supply evidence 
                     
 3 Deedy’s arguments in support of his state const itutional double 
jeopardy claims parallel those he makes in support of his federal double 
jeopardy claims, and accordingly, they are discussed together.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
9 which it failed to muster in the first proceeding.”  State v.  
Quitog, 85 Hawai i 128, 140, 938 P.2d 559, 571 (1997) (quoting 
Burks v. United States , 437 U.S. 1, 11 (1978)).  “D ouble 
jeopardy protects individuals against: (1) a second prosecution 
for the same offense after acquittal; (2) a second prosecution 
for the same offense after conviction; and (3) multiple 
punishments for the same offense.”   Id. at 141, 938 P.2d at  572 
(quoting State v. Ontiveros , 82 Hawai i 446, 450, 923 P.2d 388, 
392 (1996)). 
  Deedy raises three arguments to support his 
constitutional double jeopardy claims: (1) the State abandoned 
reckless manslaughter and the assault offenses by its trial 
strategy; (2) the circuit court’s ruling in th e first trial with 
respect to the submission of jury instructions on the included 
offenses constituted an acquittal of the reckless manslaughter 
and the assault offenses; and (3) even assuming that double 
jeopardy has not attached, the doctrine of collateral estoppel 
precludes a third trial . 
1. Quitog Abandonment of Reckless Manslaughter and the Assault 
Offenses  
  Deedy contends that the State abandoned the reckless 
manslaughter and assault offenses and is thus barred from 
retrying him for these offenses under the principles enunciated 
in State v. Quitog , 85 Hawai i 128, 938 P.2d 559 (1997). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
10   In  Quitog, this court held that the doub le jeopardy 
clause of the Hawai i Constitution “bar[s] a retrial of the 
defendant as to the originally charged offense ” if the following 
prerequisites are satisfied: 
during final argument in a criminal prosecution for [the 
originally charged offense], (1) the prosecution abandons 
its initial position that the defendant is guilty as 
charged by (a) expressly conceding that he is not and (b) 
exhorting the jury to convict the defendant of one of  
several included offense as to which the trial court has 
instructed the jury, (2) the jury deadlocks by virtue of 
its inability to reach a unanimous agreement regarding the 
particular offense, if any, of which the defendant has been 
proved guilty, (3) the  trial court declares a mistrial 
based upon “manifest necessity,” and (4) the prosecution 
could have presented the jury with the theory that it 
subsequently wishes to advance on retrial.  
Quitog, 85 Hawai i  at 129–30, 938 P.2d at 560–61.  Said another 
way, “the Hawaii Constitution ‘ bars retrial for [a] charge when 
the governme nt’s deliberate trial strategy’ --which is completely 
incompatible with another approach that it could have pursued, 
but expressly chose not to--accompanies the term ination of ‘the 
first trial . . . without the jury passing upon that charge. ’”  
Id. (quoting United States v. Cavanaugh , 948 F.2d 405, 417 (8th 
Cir. 1991)).  This test was derived from federal courts of 
appeals cases, as noted in this court’s opinion in Quitog.  Id. 
at 148—49, 938 P.2d at 579 —80 (citing Cavanaugh , 948 F.2d at  413 
(concluding that the government at trial abandoned the theory 
that there were two separate criminal acts--assault and murder--
because the government presented the acts that allegedly ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
11 constituted assault as an integral part of the actual murder); 
Sizemore v. Fletcher , 921 F.2d 667, 673 (6th Cir. 1990) (ruling 
that a second trial may be “barred by double jeopardy” if “the 
first trial ended without a verdict for reasons of the 
prosecution’s making”); Saylor v. Cornelius , 845 F.2d 1401, 
1403, 1408 (6th Cir. 1988)). 
  Deedy maintains that all of the Quitog requirements 
were met in this case: the State abandoned the initial position 
it took in the indictment, which allowed for conviction of the 
included offenses, by (1) conceding that the evidence it adduced 
did not support finding him guilty of any included offense and 
by so exhorting the second jury; (2) the second jury deadlocked 
on the included offenses; (3) the circuit court tacitly found 
manifest necessity and declared a mistrial; and (4) the State 
could have presented the second jury with the theories 
underlying the included offenses. 
  T he circumstances of Quitog are markedly different 
from this case.  At the outset, Quitog applies in situations 
where the State “abandons its initial position that the 
defendant is guilty as charged .”  Quitog , 85 Hawaii at 129, 938 
P.2d at 560 (emphasis added).  Deedy is essentially attempting 
to apply Quitog in reverse: that is, the State ostensibly 
abandons the position that the defendant could also be guilty of 
the included offenses by focusing on the charged offense and by ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
12 imploring the factfinder to find the defendant guilty as 
charged.  Based on the clear language of Quitog, this sort of 
reverse application was never contemplated; accordingly, in 
cases where the State focuses on the charged offense, the 
concept of abandonment adopted by this court in Quitog does not 
apply, and the State is not precluded from proceeding with a 
retrial of the defendant on the included offenses of the charged 
offense.  See Quitog , 85 Hawaii at 129, 938 P.2d at 560. 
  Further, even assuming that the Quitog framework 
applies, the facts of this case do not demonstrate abandonment 
of reckless manslaughter and the assault offenses.  The 
defendant in Quitog was charged with attempted murder in the 
second degree; however, during the State’s closing argument at 
trial, the deputy prosecutor stated, in pertinent part, the 
following:  
[BY THE DPA]: . . .  
What I am about to tell you will probably surprise many, if 
not all of you.  
[Quitog] is charged with Attempted Murder in the Second 
Degree, among other things.  He is not guilty of Attempted  
Murder in the Second Degree . . . . . 
Now, as I argued to you at the outset, [Quitog] is not  
guilty of Attempted Murder because there was no intent to 
kill.  I’ll admit that.  The [prosecution] does not seek a  
conviction of Attempted Murder in the Second Degree .  Well,  
let me tell you something else.  He’s also not guilty of  
Attempted Manslaughter because Attempted Manslaughter 
requires reckless conduct . 
 . . .  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
13 He’s guilty of Assault in the First Degree .  He’s guilty of 
intentionally or knowingly causing serious bodily injury. . 
. . [D]on’t convict him either of Assault in the Second 
Degree or Assault in the Third Degree because he did much 
more than that; . . . the injuries he created and what was 
on his mind, his state of mind, was more than recklessly; 
was more than substantial bodily injury; and was more than 
bodily injury.  That’s why the [prosecution] asks you to 
convict him of Assault in the First Degree . 
Quitog, 85 Hawai i at 132–33, 938 P.2d at 563–64 (footnote 
omitted). 
  Th is court determined, based on the deputy 
prosecutor’s final  argument, that the State abandoned the 
charged offense of attempted murder in the second degree.   Id. 
at 149, 938 P.2d at 580.  We reached this conclusion because the 
State could have presented this theory to the original jury but 
chose not to and because the trial terminated without a 
determination of guilt or innocence on the charged offense 
following “a deliberate, tactical decision by the prosecution.”   
Id. (quoting Cavanaugh , 948 F.2d at 416). 
  In contrast, the deputy prosecutor at the second trial 
did not exhort the jury to acquit Deedy of reckless manslaughter 
and the assault offenses.  During the second trial, the State 
explicitly discussed the possibility that the jury could convict 
Deedy of an  included offense if the jury found it appropriate to 
do so: 
  You have also heard from the Court that there 
are other counts you may consider if you feel it is 
necessary at a certain point in your deliberations.  They ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
14 are Reckless Manslaughter and Manslaughter as a Result of 
Extreme Mental or Emotional Disturbance.  
  The state of mind for the Reckless Manslaughter 
is self- explanatory.  It’s reckless.  And you have heard 
the definition of what reckless conduct is.  It’s reckless 
as opposed to intentional and knowing, which is what Murder 
Second requires.  
  The second manslaughter option relates to a 
situation in which the defendant intentionally causes the 
death of [the deceased], but he does so while under extreme 
emotional distress.  This type of manslaughter is a defense 
that the defendant must prove to you.  That is his burden 
in this case for that defense.  
  . . . Other charges that the Court has given 
you to consider -- at a certain point in your deliberation, 
if you feel that you need to, include Assault in the First 
Degree, and Assault in the Second Degree.  Now, like the 
difference between  Murder 2 and Reckless Manslaughter, the 
Assault charges incorporate the intentional and reckless 
states of mind.  Assault 1 would be intentional, Assault 2, 
reckless.  The difference between the Murder/Manslaughter 
charges and the Assault 1, Assault 2 charges is what 
happens, the consequence of the action.   
  . . .  
  I urge you to carefully consider all of the 
instructions as given.  In doing so, you will find that 
there is only one charge which is supported by the credible 
evidence in this case, and that is the original charge of 
Murder in the Second Degree.  
  Additio nally, the jury acquitted Deedy of the charged 
offense in this case unlike in Quitog, where the jury deadlocked 
on the charged offense.  Quitog, 85 Hawai i at 145–46, 938 P.2d 
at 576–77.  Thus, the resolution  of this case also does not meet 
Quitog’s second  requirement that the factfinder deadlocks with 
respect to the charged offense.  Id. at 129, 938 P.2d at 560.   
Relatedly, the third Quitog requirement is also not satisfied in ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
15 this case because, unlike in Quitog, where the mistrial was 
declared with respect to the charged offense, the declaration of 
a mistrial in this case was made only with respect to reckless 
manslaughter and the assault offenses; Deedy was acquitted of 
the charged offense of second- degree murder .  Id. at 135, 938 
P.2d at 566.  Finally, the fourth Quitog  requirement is not met 
because, unlike in Quitog, the State in this case did not 
“expressly conced[e]” that Deedy  was not guilty of reckless 
manslaughter and the assault offenses and, in fact, “presented 
the [second] jury with the theory that it subsequently wishes to 
advance on retrial.”  Id. at 129–30, 938 P.2d at  560–61; cf. 
Cavanaugh, 948 F.2d at 413, 417. 
  Based on the foregoing, it cannot be said that the 
State abandoned reckless manslaughter and the assault offenses .  
The State’s trial strategy of primarily arguing that the 
evidence supports a conviction on second- degree murder does not 
demonstrate, contrary t o Deedy’s contention, that the State 
abandoned reckless manslaughter and the assault offenses.  
Urging the jury to convict on the original charge is not the 
type of statements or acts that the Quitog court determined as 
constituting abandonment: the State in this case did not go “out 
on a limb” to take reckless manslaughter and the assault 
offenses “off the table.”  Quitog, 85 Hawai i at 146, 938 P.2d at  
577.  Thus, Quitog  and its federal counterparts do not bar a ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
16 retrial on reckless manslaughter and the included assault 
offenses. 
2. Acquittal 
  Deedy next contends that, under the double jeopardy 
clause of the state and federal constitutions, he may not be 
retried for reckless manslaughter and the included assault 
offenses because the circuit court’s rulin g at the first trial--
that there was no rational basis in the evidence to support a 
reckless manslaughter jury instruction--constituted an acquittal 
4for purposes of double jeopardy.  
  Deedy reasons that the circuit court’s finding that 
there was no rational basis to support a reckless manslaughter 
charge necessarily implies that the State would not have been 
able to overcome a judgment of acquittal, which is governed by a 
higher standard than “rational basis.”  Deedy argues that this 
court should find the circuit court’s refusal to issue a 
reckless manslaughter jury instruction as sufficient to bar a 
retrial on that charge.  According to Deedy, the circuit court’s 
independent conclusion in the first trial that the evidence did 
                     
 4 Deedy similarly contends that the State is precluded from 
retrying the firearm offense, which is dep endent on Deedy’s commission of a 
separate felony.  Correlatively, in each instance where Deedy argues that he 
had already been acquitted of reckless manslaughter and the assault offenses -
-e.g., collateral estoppel, discussed infra--his respective argument  is that 
he may not be retried on the firearm offense as well.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
17 not rationally support a reckless manslaughter instruction 
establishes his lack of criminal culpability for that offense 
and satisfies the U.S. Supreme Court’s definition of an 
5“acquittal” in Evans v. Michigan, 568 U.S. 313 (2013).  
  It is beyond dispute that “[t] he constitutional 
guarantee against double jeopardy ‘ protects against a second 
prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. ’”  State v. 
Lee, 91 Hawai i 206, 209, 982 P.2d 340, 343 (1999) (footnote 
omitted) (quoting North Carolina v. Pearce , 395 U.S. 711, 717 
(1969)).  This court has adopted the Supreme Court’s test in 
determining whether a defendant is deemed acquitted: “ A 
defendant is acquitted only when ‘ the ruling of the judge, 
whatever its label, actually represents a resolution [in 
defendant’ s favor], correct or not, of some or all of the 
factual elements of the offense charged. ’”  State v. Dow , 72 
Haw. 56, 65, 806 P.2d 402, 407 (1991) (alteration in original) 
(quoting United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co. , 430 U.S. 564,  
571 (1991)).  
                     
 5 Deedy quotes Evans’s definition of an “acquittal”: “An 
‘acquittal’ includes a ruling by the court that the evidence is insufficient 
to convict, a factual finding that necessarily establishes  the criminal 
defendant’s lack of criminal culpability, and any other ruling which relates 
to the ultimate question of guilt or innocence.”  (Quoting Evans, 568 U.S. at 
319.)  The State responds that Evans is distinguishable because the trial 
court in that  case expressly ruled in favor of the defendant’s motion for a 
judgment of acquittal based upon the court’s conclusion that the State failed 
to provide sufficient evidence to establish a particular element of the 
offense.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
18   As an initial matter, t he “acquittal” rule does not 
apply to lesser included offenses where the greater charge has 
not been resolved by the factfinder , as was the case in Deedy’s 
first trial.  Cases decided by this court and the Supreme Court 
did not involve th
e situation  postulated by Deedy-- where the 
defendant is deemed to have been acquitted of included offenses 
for double jeopardy purposes even though resolution of a greater 
charge is pending.  See State v. Poohina , 97 Hawaii 505, 510, 40 
P.3d 907, 912 (2002);  Dow, 72 Haw. at 65, 806 P.2d at  407; 
Evans, 568 U.S. at 31 5-16; Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U .S. at 
571-72. 
  HRPP Rule 29(a) also sheds light on the faulty nature 
of Deedy’s argument.  Th e rule states in relevant part as 
follows: 
The court on motion of a defendant or  of its own motion 
shall order the entry of judgment of acquittal of one or 
more offenses alleged in the charge after the evidence on 
either side is closed if the evidence is insufficient to 
sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses . 
HRPP Rule 29(a) (1977).  This rule provides no authority for a 
trial court to acquit a defendant of an included offense without 
first acquitting the defendant of the greater charge then 
pending before the factfinder.  That is, HRPP Rule 29(a) would 
not have allowed the circuit court in this case to acquit Deedy 
of the included offenses of reckless manslaughter,  assault in 
the first degree, and assault in the second degree without first ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
19 acquitting him of second- degree murder.  In fact, HRPP Rule 
29(a) operates in reverse.  When a court grants a motion for a 
judgment of acquittal, the court must consider whether the 
evidence would be sufficient to sustain a conviction of an 
included offense.  2A Charles Alan Wright, Peter J. Henning, & 
Sarah N. Welling, Federal Practice and Procedure § 467 (4th 
ed.); United States v. Hawpetoss, 388 F. Supp. 2d 952, 957 (E.D. 
Wis. 2005) (“[B] ecause a defendant may be found guilty of a 
lesser offense necessarily included in the offense charged in 
the indictment, a court confronted with a Rule 29 motion at the 
close of the evidence must also consider whether the evidence 
would be sufficient to sustain a conviction of such a lesser 
6offense.”).   Consequently, contrary to Deedy’s contention, a 
court lacks authority to grant a judgment of acquittal of 
included offenses before granting an acquittal of the greater 
offense, and indisputably, the circuit court did not grant an 
acquittal of the greater offense i n the first trial in this 
case. 
                     
 6 Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (Fed. R. Crim. P.) Rule 29 is 
substantially similar to HRPP Rule 29, and interpretation by the federal 
courts of Fed. R. Crim. P. Rule 29 may be used to guide this court’s own 
interpretation of HRPP Rule 29.  See State v. Crisostomo , 94 Hawai i 282, 287 –
88, 12 P.3d 873, 878 –79 (2000) (“Because HRPP Rule 24(c) is nearly identical 
to its federal counterpart, i.e., Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCrP) 
Rule 24(c) (1999), this court may look to parallel federal law for guidance.” 
(footnote omitted)).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
20   In addition, a trial court’s decision resolving the 
issue of whether to give or withhold certain jury instructions 
is not a “resolution . . .  of some or all of the factual 
elements of the offense charged ” and, thus, does not constitute 
an acquittal.  Dow , 72 Haw. at 65, 806 P.2d at 407 (alteration 
in original) (quoting Martin Linen Supply Co. , 430 U.S. at  571).  
As this court has previously explained, whether a trial court 
must give a particular jury instruction is “a question of law 
based on an objective juror standard.”  State v. Taylor , 130 
Hawaii 196, 207, 307 P.3d 1142, 1153 (2013).  In State v. 
Maelega, the court explained that the determination of whether 
to instruct the jury on the defense of extreme mental or 
emotional disturbance (EMED) called for the court’s “legal 
conclusion” that the defendant “had met his burden of production 
by coming forward with evidence at trial to support his defense 
of EMED manslau ghter.”  80 Hawaii 172, 177 n.8, 907 P.2d 758, 
763 n.8 (1995); see also id. at 179 n.10, 907 P.2d at 765 n.10 
(emphasizing that whether a particular instruction should be 
given to the jury is a legal “question that should be decided by 
the trial court as a matter of law”).   
  This means that the circuit court’s conclusion in this 
case that the jury should not be instructed on included offenses 
was a determination of a legal question--i.e., whether there was ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
21 a rational basis to instruct the jury on included offenses--and 
not a resolution of any of the factual elements determinative of 
a person’s guilt of the included offenses.  See Taylor, 130 
Hawaii at 207, 307 P.3d at 1153; Maelega , 80 Hawai i at 177 n.8, 
179 n.10, 907 P.2d at 763 n.8, 765 n.10.  Thus, the court’s 
decision not to instruct the jury on included offenses is not an 
acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy.  Cf. Dow, 72 Haw. 
at 65, 806 P.2d at 407 (stating that a ruling is an acquittal 
under double jeopardy principles if it resolves some or all of 
the factual elements of the charged offense).  
  Deedy’s argument is also unavailing when the procedure 
underlying whether to give instructions on lesser included 
offenses is examined.  The  United States Supreme Court and 
several other jurisdictions have characterized the test 
governing the issuance of jury instructions on lesser included 
offenses as a “procedural safeguard” that is “especially 
important” in cases where the failure to instruct “on a lesser 
included offense would seem inevitably to enhance the risk of an 
unwarranted conviction.”   Beck v. Alabama , 447 U.S. 625, 637 
(1980); accord State v. Morales , 673 N.W.2d 250, 254 –55 (N.D. 
2004); State v. Tweed , 491 N.W.2d 412, 416 (N.D. 1992); State v. 
Powell, 154 P.3d 788, 796 –97 (Utah 2007); State v. Dahlin , 695 
N.W.2d 588, 597 (Minn. 2005); State v. Andrade , 954 P.2d 755, 
758 (N.M. Ct. App. 1997).  The Commentary on the Model Penal ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
22 Code (MPC) has also de scribed the test as “procedural in 
nature.”
  Model Penal Code and Commentaries § 1.07, cmt. 5 at 
129 & n.106 (Official Draft and Revised Comments 1985) 
[hereinafter MPC Commentaries].  
Accordingly, a trial court’s 
ruling on whether to issue jury instructions on lesser included 
offenses does not constitute an acquittal for double jeopardy 
purposes.  See Evans , 568 U.S. at 319
-20 (explaining that 
procedural rulings that result in dismissals are not acquittals 
that implicate double jeopardy concerns). 
  Finally , the manner in which Deedy urges this court to 
apply the “acquittal” rule and the practical effects of suc h an 
application are at odds with this court’s precedents governing 
the ramifications of the trial court’s failure to give jury 
instructions on lesser included offenses when certain 
prerequisites have been satisfied.  It is well established that 
“trial cou rts shall instruct juries as to any included offenses 
having a rational basis in the evidence without regard to 
whether the prosecution requests, or the defense objects to, 
such an instruction.”   State v. Adviento , 132 Hawai i 123, 140, 
319 P.3d 1131, 1148 (2014) (quoting State v. Haanio , 94 Hawai i 
405, 407, 16 P.3d 246, 248 (2001), overruled in part on other 
grounds by State v. Flores , 131 Hawai i 43, 314 P.3d 120 (2013)).  
Failure to do so will result in the vacatur of the trial court’s ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
23 judgment and a remand for a new trial.  Id. at 152, 319 P.3d at  
1160 (remanding the case for a new trial because of the circuit 
court’s failure to instruct the jury on extreme mental or 
emotional disturbance).   
  Under  Deedy’s approach , whenever a trial court 
determines that jury instructions on lesser included offenses 
are not required and an appellate court disagrees, the appellate
court could not remand the case for a retrial because doing so 
would offend double jeopardy principles.  Yet precedents from 
this court have expressly provided for this result.  Flores, 131
Hawaii at 58, 314 P.3d at  135 (remanding for a retrial because 
the court failed to instruct the jury on an included offense); 
Adviento, 132 Hawai i at 152, 319 P.3d at 1160; State v. Faamama ,
139 Hawai i 94, 101, 384 P.3d 870, 877 (2016) (holding that the 
circuit court’s failure to give instructions on  the included 
offense of theft in the second degree required remand for  a 
7retrial).   Therefore, Deedy was not acquitted of reckless 
manslaughter and the assault offenses within the meaning of 
“acquittal” under both the Hawaii and federal constitutions.  
 
 
                     
 7 Further, if a trial court’s determination to not submit jury 
instructions on lesser included offenses were deemed an acquittal of the 
included offenses, then the legal consequence would also be an acquittal of 
the greater offense whe n the lesser included offense “is established by proof 
of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission 
of the offense charged.”  See HRS § 701- 109(4)(a) (2014).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
24 3. Collateral Estoppel 
  Deedy argues that, even assuming that double jeopardy 
has not attached, the doctrine of collateral estoppel stemming 
from the double jeopardy clauses of the State and federal 
constitutions precludes the State from trying him a third time.  
Deedy maintains that the State is collaterally estopped from 
retrying him on reckless manslaughter and the included assault 
offenses because the circuit court, at the first trial, had 
already acquitted him of these charges.  According to Deedy, he 
was acquitted when the circuit court ruled that there was no 
evidence to support a reckless manslaughter instruction because 
the evidence does not factually support a finding of 
recklessness.  Thus, Deedy concludes that the issue of whether 
he had a reckless state of mind when he fired the lethal shot 
may not be relitigated at a third trial.  The State responds 
that, during the settling of jury instructions at the first 
trial, the circuit court “neither considered the application of 
the reckless state of mind to each element of reckless 
manslaughter nor made any such findings.”  
  The doctrine of “collateral estoppel means that ‘when 
an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid 
and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between 
the same parties in any future lawsuit.’”  State v. Mundon , 129 
Hawaii 1, 14, 292 P.3d 205, 218 (2012) (quoting Ashe v. Swenson , ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
25 397 U.S. 436, 443 (1970)).  Collateral estoppel “is a principle 
embodied in the right against double jeopardy, and precludes 
relitigation of issues already decided, even when double 
jeopardy is not necessarily implicated.”  Id. (citing Ashe, 397 
U.S. at 443).  
  In Ashe--the case from which this court adopted the 
collateral estoppel principle-- the defendant, who allegedly 
robbed individuals engaged in a poker game, was acquitted by a 
jury of the charged offense with respect to one of the victims 
and was then found guilty of the same offense with respect to 
another victim.  Ashe, 397 U.S. at 438 —39.  The Supreme Court 
concluded that,  
[o]nce a jury had determined upon conflicting testimony 
that there was at least a reasonable doubt that the 
petitioner was one of the robbers, the State could not 
present the same or different identification evidence in a 
second prosecution for the robbery of [a different victim] 
in the hope that a different jury might find  that evidence 
more convincing.  
Id. at 446. 
  In this case, there was no determination that Deedy 
was not guilty of reckless manslaughter or the assault offenses  
because the circuit court’s determination at the first trial 
that jury instructions on the included offenses were not to be 
given was not tantamount to an acquittal, see supra , and 
because, at the second trial, the jury was deadlocked on these 
included offenses.  Accordingly, the State is not collaterally ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
26 estopped under the Hawai i or federal constitution from retrying 
8Deedy on these offenses.  
C. Statutory Provisions Affecting Further Prosecution 
  In addition to his state and federal double jeopardy 
claims, Deedy contends that pursuant to HRS §§ 701-109(2) 
(1993), 701- 110(1) (1993) , and 701-111(1)(a) and (1)(c) (1993), 
he may not be retried for reckless manslaughter and the included 
assault offenses. 
1. HRS § 701-109(2) 
  Deedy asserts that HRS § 701-109(2) bars a third trial 
on reckless manslaughter and the included assault offenses.  HRS 
§ 701-109(2) provides as follows:  
                     
 8 The dissent, su a sponte, relies on plain error to argue that the 
State is barred from retrying Deedy by judicial  estoppel rather than 
collateral  estoppel as Deedy maintains.  Dissent at 4-8.  No party has raised 
this argument at any stage of the proceeding, and it is incorrect in any 
event.  The dissent contends that the State may  not now argue that Deedy is 
guilty of reckless manslaughter because this stance is inconsistent with the 
State’s position at both trials.  The dissent maintains that the State’s 
position that a reckless manslaughter instruction was not required 
necessarily implied that there was no rational basis in the evidence for 
finding Deedy guilty of reckless manslaughter.  Dissent at 5 (citing Flores, 
131 Hawai i at 51, 314 P.3d at 128).  
However, it is not the State that determines whether there is a 
rational basis in the evidence for an included instruction.  Adviento , 132 
Hawaii at 140, 319 P.3d at 1149.  The State’s position regarding the 
submission of an included offense instruction to the jury is irrelevant to 
whether Deedy can be retried.  And, it was similarly irrelevant to the 
State’s ability to discuss in closing argument the applicability of the 
court’s included instructions (as the State did in the second trial).  
Unequivocally, the State’s assessment of the evidence as it pertained to the 
submission of included offense jury instructions at an earlier trial does not 
estop the State from retrying the defendant on an included offense on which 
the jury deadlocked.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
27 (2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this section, a 
defendant shall not be subject to separate trials for 
multiple offenses based on the same conduct or arising from 
the same episode , if such offenses are known to the 
appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the 
commencement of the first trial and are within the 
jurisdiction of a single court.  
 
HRS § 701-109(2) (emphasis added) . 
  HRS § 701- 109(2) has previously been labeled by this 
court as the “compulsory joinder” law, in that it “ acts as a 
procedural limitation upon the State’ s power under HRS § 701-
109(1) to seek convictions for all offenses resulting from a 
single course of conduct. ”  State v. Aiu , 59 Haw. 92, 95 –96, 576 
P.2d 1044, 1047 (1978).  The Commentary on HRS § 701- 109 states 
that “[s]ubsection (2) requires joinder of the trials of two or 
more offenses based on the same conduct.”  HRS § 701 -109 cmt.; 
accord State v. Carroll , 63 Haw. 345, 351, 627 P.2d 776, 780 
9(1981).   “Section 701 -109(2) reflects a policy that all charges 
that arise under one episode be consolidated in one trial so 
that a defendant need not face the expense and uncertainties of 
multiple trials based on essentially the same episode. ”  State 
v. Servantes, 72 Haw. 35, 38, 804 P.2d 1347, 1348 (1991).  The 
Servantes court noted that the joinder requirement of HRS § 701-
                     
 9 HRS § 701 -109(2) was patterned after MPC § 1.07(2), and the 
commentary on MPC § 1.07(2) is i n accord with this court’s interpretation of 
the requirements of HRS § 701 -109(2): “It requires the prosecution to join in 
one trial all offenses based on the same conduct or arising from the same 
criminal episode.”  MPC Commentaries § 1.07, cmt. 3 at 116.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
28 109(2) “is designed to prevent the State from harassing a 
defendant with successive prosecutions where the State is 
dissatisfied with the punishment previously ordered or where the 
State has failed to convict the defendant. ”  Id. 
  HRS § 701- 109(2) simply has no application in this 
case because all offenses with which Deedy was charged were 
tried together at the first and second trials.  Instead, HRS § 
701-109(2) applies where there are charges arising from the same 
conduct or the same episode and the State attempts to try those 
charges separately.  See, e.g. , Carroll, 63 Haw. at  346–53, 627 
P.2d at 777 (stating that the defendant was charged in the 
circuit court with attempted criminal property damage in the 
second degree and was previously acquitted in an earlier 
district court trial of possession of an obnoxious substance, 
but holding that the separate charges were based on distinct 
courses of conduct).  In this case, Deedy was not being charged 
separately for the same course of conduct; there is but one 
criminal action filed in the circuit court.  As discussed supra, 
a retrial on reckless manslaughter and the included assault 
offenses is merely a “continuation” of the same prosecution 
following the declaration of a mistrial when the jury was 
deadlocked as to those offenses.  See State v. Mundon, 129 
Hawaii 1, 14 n.22, 292 P.3d 205,  219 n.22 (2012) (quoting United 
States v. Bailin, 977 F.2d 270, 276 (7th Cir. 1992)). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
29 2. HRS § 701-110(1) 
  Deedy further argues that a third trial on reckless 
manslaughter and the included assault offenses is barred by HRS 
§ 701-110(1), which provides as follows: 
When a prosecution is for an offense under the same 
statutory provision  and is based on the same facts as a 
former prosecution, it is barred by the former prosecution 
under any 
of the following circumstances:  
(1) The former prosecution resulted in an acquittal which 
has not subsequently been set aside.  There is an acquittal 
if the prosecution resulted in a finding of not guilty by 
the trier of fact or in a determination by the court that 
there was insufficient  evidence to warrant a conviction.  A 
finding of guilty of a lesser included offense is an 
acquittal of the greater inclusive offense, although the 
conviction is subsequently set aside on appeal by the 
defendant.  
 
HRS § 701-110(1) (emphasis added). 
  In pe rtinent part, the Commentary on HRS § 701- 110 
states that this statute “ bars a new prosecution for an offense 
under the same statutory provision and based upon the same facts 
as a former prosecution when there is an acquittal .”  HRS § 701 -
110 cmt.  The statute has been previously applied by this court 
in cases involving a conviction of a lesser included offense 
that barred a retrial on the greater offense, since the 
conviction of the lesser included offense is an acquittal of the 
greater offense.  
For example, in State v. Feliciano , 62 Haw. 
637, 618 P.2d 306 (1980), superseded by statute on other grounds
 
as stated in State v. Kalaola , 124 Hawai i 43, 52, 237 P.3d 1109, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
30 1118 (2010), we held that a retrial on the originally charged 
greater offense was barred by HRS § 701-110(1) because “[t] he 
jury conviction in the first trial on the lesser included 
offense automatically acquitted the appellant of the greater 
charge in the indictment.”  Id. at 644, 618 P.2d at 311.  
Because of that automatic acquittal, HRS § 701 -110(1) precluded 
a retrial on the greater charge.   
  In this case, the  acquittal in the second trial was 
only as to the original charge of second-degree murder and not 
as to any of the included offenses .  If the State were 
attempting to retry Deedy  for the initially  charged offense of 
murder in the second degree under the same statutory provision, 
then HRS § 701- 110(1) would bar such an attempt.  But, instead, 
the State seeks to retry Deedy on the included offenses of 
reckless manslaughter
, assault  in the first degree, and assault 
in the second degree--of which he was not acquitted--given that 
the second jury was hung as to these offenses
.  Further, 
contrary to Deedy’s position , the circuit court’s non-submission 
of jury instructions on these included offenses in the first 
trial did not constitute an acquittal.  See supra .  Accordingly, 
HRS § 701-110(1) does not bar a retrial on reckless manslaughter 
and the included assault offenses. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
31 3. HRS § 701-111(1)(a) and (1)(c) 
  Deedy asserts that a third trial is also barred by HRS 
§ 701-111(1)(a) and (1)(c), which states as follows:  
Although a prosecution is for a violation of a different 
statutory provision or is based on different facts, it is 
barred by a former prosecution under any of the following 
circumstances:  
(1) The former prosecution resulted in an acquittal which 
has not subsequently been set aside or in a conviction as 
defined in section 701 -110(3) and the subsequent 
prosecution is for:  
(a) Any offense of which the defendant could have been 
convicted on the first prosecution  
. . .  
(c) An offense based on the same conduct. . .
 . 
HRS § 701-111(1)(a), (c).  At the outset, HRS § 701-111 has no 
application in this case because 
it “obviously was intended to  
deal with a new prosecution , commenced after a termination of a 
prior prosecution, and terminated as defined in that section. ”  
State v. Wacker , 70 Haw. 332, 333, 770 P.2d 420, 421 –22 (1989),  
overruled on other grounds by  State v. Dow , 72 Haw. 56, 806 P.2d 
402 (1991) (emphasis added).  This statute “was not intended to 
deal with a situation where there were multiple counts, under 
different statutes, in an original prosecution, which were tried 
together as required by statute, resulting in an acquittal on 
some of the counts, and a mistrial on others. ”  Id. 
  In this case, a retrial on reckless manslaughter and 
the included assault offenses will not be a “new prosecution” ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
32 because, as discussed supra, it will merely be a “ continuation ” 
of the original prosecution.  State v. Mundon , 129 Hawaii 1, 14 
n.22, 292 P.3d 205, 219 n.22 (2012) (quoting United States v.  
Bailin, 977 F.2d 270, 276 (7th Cir. 1992)); HRS § 701-108(5) 
(1993 & Supp. 2006).  
  In addition, even assuming that HRS § 701-111 applies 
in the context of a retrial, Deedy’s argument --predicated on HRS 
§ 701-111(1)(a)--would be  without merit because this subsection 
does not apply where, as here, the factfinder acquits the 
defendant of the greater offense but is deadlocked as to the 
lesser included offenses of the greater offense.  MPC  
Commentaries § 1.09 cmt. 2 at 157 n.5 (noting that MPC § 
1.09(1)(a), which is identical to
 HRS § 701-111(1)(a) , does not 
bar a retrial on lesser included offenses “where there is an 
acquittal of the greater offense and a mistrial is proper
ly 
declared with respect to the lesser offense”) ; People v. 
Jenkins, 354 N.E.2d 139, 140 (Ill. App. Ct. 1976) (where the 
jury acquitted the defendant of the greater offense but failed 
to agree as to the included offenses, Illinois’s statute that 
parallels HRS § 701-111(1)(a) does not bar a retrial on the 
included offenses).   Accordingly, HRS § 701-111(1)(a) and (1)(c) 
does not bar a retrial on reckless manslaughter and the included 
assault offenses. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
33 D. Moriwake  Claim 
  Deedy next argues that the circuit court erroneously 
denied his motion to dismiss, brought pursuant to this court’s 
decision in State v. Moriwake , 65 Haw. 47, 647 P.2d 705 (1982), 
because the court misapplied and misapprehended the factors 
relevant to the determination of whether dismissal is 
appropriate.  In Moriwake , we held that trial courts, “[w] ithin 
the bounds of duly exercised discretion ,” may in appropriate 
circumstances “dismiss[] an indictment with prejudice following 
the declaration of one or more mistrials because of genuinely

rights are not yet implicated.”  Id. at 55, 647 P.2d at 711.  
  In making a determination as to whether to dismiss an 
indictment, the role of a trial court is to balance “ the 
interest of the state against fundamental fairness to a

v. Braunsdorf, 297 N.W.2d 808, 817 (1980) (Day, J., 
dissenting)).  The factors that the court should consider in 
undertaking this balance include the following:  
(1) the severity of the offense charged; (2) the number of 
prior mistrials and the circumstances of the jury 
deliberation therein, so far as is known; (3) the character 
of prior trials in terms of length, complexity and 
similarity of evidence presented; (4) the likelihood of any 
substantial difference in a subsequent trial, if allowed;

vacate a trial court’s Moriwake  ruling unless the party 
challenging the ruling can make a strong showing that the court 
abused its discretion by clearly exceeding  the bounds of reason 
or disregarding rules or principles of law or practice.  State

Hinton, 120 Hawai i at 273, 204 P.3d at 492. 
1. Severity of the Offense  
  The circuit court concluded that the first factor 
favors retrial because manslaughter is “unquestionably a serious 
charge based upon an accused allegedly recklessly causing . . .  
the death of another person.”  Deedy argues that this factor 
weighs against retrial for the following reasons: even though 
reckless manslaughter may be viewed as a serious offense because 
it involves the death of a person, third- degree negligent ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
35 homicide (which also involves causing a death of another person) 
is only a misdemeanor; he had been acquitted of second-degree 
murder; and the State abandoned reckless manslaughter.  However, 
reckless manslaughter is designated by the legislature as a 
class A felony, see  HRS § 707-702(3) (1993 & Supp. 2006),  it may 
subject a convicted defendant to an indeterminate term of twenty 
years of imprisonment, see HRS § 706-659 (2014), its commission 
results in the death of another human being , and, “ when 
considered in light of, or as compared with, other felony 
offenses (such as murder, rape, or kidnapping) ,” reckless 
manslaughter is an offense of serious gravity.  See Hinton, 120 
Hawaii at 278, 204 P.3d at  497 (intimating that murder, rape, 
and kidnapping are serious offenses and considering the felony 
classification of the charged offense in evaluating the first 
Moriwake factor).  Further, as discussed supra, the State did 
not “abandon” reckless manslaughter in this case , contrary to 
Deedy’s contention.  Accordingly, the circuit court did not 
abuse its discretion in concluding that reckless manslaughter is 
a serious offense and that the first Moriwake  factor weighs in 
10favor of a retrial.  
                     
 10 Deedy does not claim that the seriousness of the felony firearm
charge favors dismissal, so this court need not reach this issue.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
36 2. The number of prior mistrials and the circumstances of the 
jury deliberation therein, so far as is known 
  In analyzing this factor, the circuit court 
specifically referenced the jury communications from the second 
jury and noted that the jury appeared concerned about the 
recklessness state of mind and the timing of its applicability.  
The court also stated tha t “[i]t is difficult to discern from 
communications precisely how jury deliberations proceeded.”  
Thus, the circuit court concluded that, “considering the legal 
and factual complexity of this case and the fact that a retrial 
will focus solely upon a reckless state of mind, this factor is 
neutral.”  
  Deedy disagrees with the circuit court, arguing that 
the first jury voted eight to four in favor of acquittal on the 
murder charge and the second jury voted seven to five in favor 
of acquittal on the reckless manslaughter charge.  Deedy also 
contends that the lengthy deliberation of the first and second 
juries weighs in favor of dismissal.  The State responds that 
the juries in the first and second trials acquitted Deedy only 
of second-degree murder and that the contents of the jury 
communications to the court indicated that the jurors did not 
acquit Deedy of any of the lesser included offenses. 
  Although there have been two trials in this case, only 
the second trial involved submission to the jury of the included ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
37 11reckless manslaughter and assault offenses.   And even in cases 
where there had been two trials, both of which ended in a 
mistrial as to certain counts, this court has held that it was 
not an abuse of discretion for the circuit court to conclude 
that the second Moriwake  factor weighed slightly for the 
allowance of a retrial.  Deguair, 135 Hawai i at 88, 358 P.3d at  
60. 
  Further, as the circuit court appears  to have 
inferred, the jury communications from the second jury evince a 
degree of confusion about the recklessness state of mind and its 
application.  The third communication from the jury inquired, 
“Is recklessness limited to only at the time of using deadly 
force or includes from beginning to end leading up to the point 
of using deadly force?”  The fourth jury communication mirrored 
the inquiry contained in the third jury communication.  The 
                     
 11 The dissent argues that the number of times the jury was 
instructed on reckless manslaughter and assault offenses should be irrelevant 
to our analysis because it does not change the number of chances the State 
has been afforded to obtain a guilty verdict.  Dissent at 1 1-12.  However, 
the second factor provides for consideration of “the number of prior 
mistrials and the circumstances of the jury deliberation therein , so far as 
is known.”  Moriwake , 65 Haw. at 56, 647 P.2d at 712  (emphasis added).  Thus, 
the number of prior mistrials is not considered in isolation.  Instead, the 
circuit court duly considered the circumstances of the jury deliberations, 
which included not only the offenses that were deliberated upon in each trial 
but also the nature of the jury communications in the earlier trials.  The 
circuit court was therefore not foreclosed from considering the number  of 
opportunities a jury has had to reach a consensus on the issue of guilt as to 
the offenses that would be involved in a retrial.  That a jury had evaluated 
the reckless manslaughter charge only once before was thus relevant to the 
circuit court’s evalua tion of the second Moriwake  factor, and the court did 
not abuse its discretion by taking it into consideration.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
38 sixth jury communication asked, “If we sign the ‘no[t] guilty’ 
ndverdict form on the charge of murder in the 2  degree, does it 
mean that Deedy is not guilty [of] the lesser charges of 
st ndreckless manslaughter, 1  degree assault [and] 2  degree 
assault?”  And the eighth jury communication asked whether 
“reckless manslaughter  [is] included in Murder in the Second 
Degree Charge or are they sepporate [sic]?”  The circuit court  
may duly take into account its concern, founded upon these 
communications, that the jury was confused with  the import of 
the recklessness state of mind in the court’s instructions .  
Hinton, 120 Hawai i at 278–79, 204 P.3d at  497–98 (holding that 
the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by finding the 
second Moriwake factor weighed in favor of retrial because the 
12jury “seemed confused”) .   In light of the circuit court’s 
                     
 12 In Hinton , 120 Hawai i  at 270, 204 P.3d at 489, the jury submitted 
communications during deliberations requesting the definition and application 
of a term related to the charge.  When the jury proceeded to deadlock, the 
trial court declared a mistrial, and the defendant moved to dismiss the 
charges under Moriwake .  Id. at 271, 204 P.3d at 490.  In considering the 
second Moriwake
 factor, the trial court observed, “[A]ll in all, the 
questions [the jury] asked and their trouble following the evidence makes me 
feel that this factor weighs in favor of a retrial.”  Id.  On review, the 
court in Hinton
 held that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in 
finding that the second Moriwake factor weighed towards retrial.  Id.
 at 279, 
204 P.3d at 499.  Thus, we have approved consideration of jury communications 
evincing confusion under Moriwake
’s second factor.  
  In apparent disagreement with this court’s decision in Hinton, 
the dissent contends that, under our interpretation, “whenever jury 
communications indicate confusion, the State may be afforded another 
opportunity to retry the case” to correct strategic missteps that led to the 
jury’s confusion.  Dissent at 1 4.  However, there is no indication here that 
the jury’s confusion resulted from mistakes on the part of the State.  We

39 conclusion regarding the legal and factual complexity of the 
case and that a retria l will focus solely upon a reckless s tate 
of mind, the court clearly did not exceed the bounds of reason 
13in weighing this factor as “neutral” in its Moriwake analysis.   
3. The character of prior trials in terms of length, complexity 
and similarity of evidence presented 
  The circuit court determined that the length, 
complexity, and evidence presented weigh in favor of retrial.  
Deedy asserts that the lengthy prior trials —-the first trial 
lasting 23 days and the second trial 16 days--and the similarity 
of the evidence adduced at each trial weigh in favor of 
dismissal. 
  “A comparison between the evidence presented, 
witnesses testifying, and legal theories argued in each trial 
                                                                        
(. . . continued) 
 
also note that the circuit court ultimately concluded with regard to the 
second Moriwake factor that “this factor is neutral,” which was decidedly not 
an abuse of discretion in light of our precedent.
  (Emphasis added.)  
 13 The dissent argues that our holding  may allow the State to “avoid 
some of the repercussions” of its “fail[ure] to obtain a conviction due to 
its unclear presentation of the facts.”  Dissent at 1 4.  However, the jury 
communications in the second trial focused upon the complexities of the legal 
standards the jury was required to apply.  It is the ultimate responsibility 
of the trial court, not the State, to ensure that the jury possesses “a clear 
and correct understanding of what it is they are to decide.”  State v. 
Adviento, 132 Hawai i 123, 137, 319 P.3d 1131, 1145 (2014) (quoting State v. 
Hoey, 77 Hawai i 17, 38 –39, 881 P.2d 504, 525 –26 (1994)).  And it is the 
court, not the State, that is responsible for providing correct instructions 
on the law.  Id.  (citing State v. Locquiao , 100 Hawai i 195, 205, 58 P.3d 
1242, 1252 (2002)).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
40 [is] relevant to the third Moriwake factor.”  Deguair, 136 
Hawaii at 88, 358 P.3d at  60.  We note, however, that the length 
of previous trials, considered in and of itself, is not a strong 
indicator of whether the third Moriwake  factor favors or 
disfavors a retrial.  For example, in Hinton, this court agreed 
with the trial court’s determination that, although the short 
length of the previous trial favored a retrial, the fact that 
the case was not complex ultimately weighed against a retrial.  
See Hinton , 120 Hawai i at 271, 279, 204 P.3d at 490, 498.  In 
Deguair, this court agreed with the trial court’s reasoning 
that, even if the previous trials were somewhat long, the fact 
that the case was not complex weighed against a retrial.  136 
Hawaii at 89, 358 P.3d at  61.  Evident in both Hinton and 
Deguair is the fact that the length of the previous trials, as 
an ingredient in the evaluation of the third Moriwake  factor, 
must be viewed and analyzed in the context of the complexity of 
the case.  See Hinton , 120 Hawai i at 271, 279, 204 P.3d at  490, 
498; Deguair , 136 Hawai i at 88– 89, 358 P.3d at 60 –61. 
  The court in this case considered the length of the 
previous trials and observed that the two trials had been 
legally and factually complex:  
  The two trials were legally complicated; the 
self-defense and defense of others instructions, alone , 
included some complex provisions.  In addition, both trials 
were factually complicated, involving as they did, not one ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
41 or two events, but a series of alleged events as witnessed 
in part by a number of  persons, and without the benefit of 
a surveillance tape that contained any sound or that 
captured greater detail . . . Thus, the jury had to weigh 
credibility of numerous witnesses as to all events it 
deemed relevant, had to decide what the tape portrayed, had 
to determine what precisely had occurred, and then had to  
apply these facts to some complicated legal principles . 
(Emphases added.)  As stated by the circuit court, not only did 
the second jury have to consider second-degree murder , its 
included offenses, and a felony firearm offense, it also had to 
evaluate, as to each of these offenses, whether self- defense or 
defense of others applied.  See Hinton , 120 Hawaii at 279, 204 
P.3d at 498 (agreeing with the trial court that the third 
Moriwake  factor weighed against retrial in part because the 
first trial was not complicated).  Additionally, these complex 
legal principles had to be applied to facts and  circumstances 
that, as the trial court noted, were subject to recounting by 
numerous witnesses and captured by a soundless and 
14insufficiently detailed surveillance video.  
  If this court were to accept Deedy’s proposition , 
echoed by the dissent,  Dissent at 23-2 4,--that longer  and more 
complex previous trials should tip the third Moriwake  factor in 
                     
 14 Although the dissent does not dispute that the trial was complex, 
it argues that this consideration weighs in favor of dismissal.  Dissent at 
23-24.  Our precedents clearly hold otherwise.  See Hinton, 120 Hawai i at 
279, 204 P.3d at 498; Deguair, 136 Hawai i at 89, 358 P.3d at 61.  This is 
because trials that involved complicated issues may have a greater likelihood 
to be resolved by a second jury with a different complement of jurors than 
would trials that deadlocked on non- complicated issues.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
42 favor of dismissal-- then there will be a greater likelihood that
the third Moriwake  factor will favor dismissal of cases 
involving more serious 
charges, cases with a greater number of 
charged offenses or defendants, and cases involving offenses of 
more complexity in their alleged commission or in the applicable
15law, in contrast to cases of less seriousness.   Thus, Deedy’s 
argument that “lengthy prior trials . . . weigh[] in favor of 
dismissal under Moriwake ” is inconsistent with this court’s 
decisions in both Hinton and Deguair and would bring about 
incongruous results.  
 
  The circuit court also examined the difference in the 
presentation of evidence and the legal theories pursued between 
the first and second trials, stating that  
[w]hile many of the same witnesses and the same 
surveillance tape were presented at both trials, the second 
trial’s evidence appeared to place greater emphasis upon 
[Deedy]’s alleged state of intoxication and the State’s 
theory that the deceased already had sustained a gunshot 
                     
 15 The dissent maintains that there is no “linear” relation such 
that cases involving serious charges or multiple defendants “necessarily 
result in longer and/or more complicated trials.”  Dissent at 2 4.  However, 
we merely observe that there is a greater likelihood that lengthier 
trials will occur in such cases.  And at least one empirical study confirms 
that high- stake criminal litigation tends to involve longer trials.  See 
Barry Mahoney & Dale Ann Sipes, Toward Better M
anagement of Criminal 
Litigation, 72 Judicature 29, 33 –34 (1988) (detailing results of study that 
“not surprisingly” indicated “[t]he most serious felony charge trials --
homicide, rape and robbery
--consistently take longer (both overall and in 
specific segments) than do theft, burglary and narcotics cases”).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
wound before he and [Deedy] fell to the restaurant 
floor.[16] 
(Emphasis added.) 
43   Given that the circuit court duly considered the 
differences “between both trials with respect to the legal 
theories, evidence presented, and witnesses who testified ,” 
Deguair, 136 Hawai i at 88–89, 358 P.3d 60 –61, and in light of 
its determination that the previous trials were both factually 
and legally complex, the circuit court plainly did not abuse its 
discretion in determining that the third Moriwake factor favors 
17retrial.   See Hinton, 120 Hawai i at 279, 204 P.3d at 498; 
                     
 16 The dissent contends that the circuit court abused its discretion 
when evaluating the third Moriwake factor by mistakenly equating the 
different emphases that the State placed upon the evidence in the  two trials 
with dissimilarities in the evidence p resented in the trials.  Dissent at 20-
21.  The dissent, however, misapprehends the circuit court’s analysis.  The 
court’s allusion to differing emphases in the two trials referred to 
differences in the legal theories  that the State presented, which our 
precedents require a court to account for when analyzing the third Moriwake 
factor.  See Deguair, 136 Hawai i at 88, 358 P.3d 60 (“A comparison between 
the . . . legal theories argued in each trial [is] re
levant to the third 
Moriwake factor.”). 
 17 The dissent in its evaluation of the second and third Moriwake 
factors faults the State’s trial strategy of focusing its efforts upon 
obtaining a murder conviction rather than a manslaughter conviction.  Dissent 
at 15, 22 (contending that dismissal is called for because the State 
“deliberately and strategically chose not to focus on whether Deedy could be 
convicted of reckless manslaughter” “and instead fixate[d] its efforts on 
pursuing a murder conviction”).  Deed y was indicted by a grand jury that 
charged him with murder in the second degree (along with the related firearm 
offense).  It is unclear if it is the dissent’s position that the State is 
required to divide its advocacy in a prosecution between the charged  offense 
and included offenses if it wishes to avoid dismissal when a jury deadlocks 
on an included offense.  Even assuming this were the case, the evidence as 
presented at trial indisputably supported the submission of an included 
offense instruction on r
eckless manslaughter, the jury in fact deadlocked on 
this charge, and Deedy has not challenged the circuit court’s determination 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
44 Deguair, 136 Hawai i at 89, 358 P.3d at  61 (reasoning that the 
third Moriwake factor favored dismissal because the case was not 
complex and deferring to the circuit court’s findings because 
that court took into account the various considerations that 
bear upon this factor). 
4. The likelihood of any substantial difference in a subsequent 
trial, if allowed 
  The circuit court concluded that this factor favors 
retrial, reasoning that, “[i ]n a third trial, the prosecution 
will focus exclusively upon a reckless state of mind, which 
carries different requirements than does an intentional or 
knowing state of mind.”  The court reasoned that “the greater 
state of mind . . . will otherwise be irrelevant, meaning that 
evidentiary emphasis and argument during that third trial will 
differ from what they were when the focus was the charged 
offense.”  In addition, the circuit court determined that, if 
the government meets its burden at the third trial, the defenses 
of self-defense and defense of others would be rendered 
inapplicable. 
                                                                        
(. . . continued) 
 
that there was a rational basis in the evidence for the jury to be instructed 
on this offense at the second trial.  Thus, the S tate’s trial strategy did 
not preclude the jury from consideration of reckless manslaughter at the 
second trial. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
45   Deedy disagrees with the circuit court, contending 
that, not only has the State consistently taken the position 
that its evidence does not support a finding that Deedy harbored 
a reckless state of mind, there is also “no reason to think the 
witnesses will be different, the videotape will depict anything 
different, or the experts will opine something new.”  The State 
asserts that the presentation of the evidence at a retrial --
which would focus on whether Deedy harbored a reckless state of 
mind when he discharged the fatal shot-- will substantially 
differ from the prior trials. 
  T he circuit court concluded that the evidence that 
will be presented at a third trial will be tailored to 
addressing the specific elements of the recklessness state of 
18mind,  and as such, the self-defense and defense of others 
justifications will have a more limited application.  See 
generally HRS § 703-310 ( 1993); State v. Culkin , 97 Hawaii 206, 
                     
 18 Deedy takes issue with the circuit court’s reasoning that a third 
trial would allow the State to present evidence and argument on recklessness 
when the State, from Deedy’s point of view, “had opted not to adduce or 
advance” recklessness at the prior trials.  However, a more serious state of 
mind subsumes within it all less serious states of mind.  For example, 
“[w]hen the law provides that rec klessness is sufficient to establish an 
element of an offense, that element also is established if, with respect 
thereto, a person acts intentionally or knowingly.”  HRS § 702 -208 (1993).  
In this case, by introducing evidence to support its argument in the first 
two trials that Deedy harbored an intentional state of mind, the State was in 
effect also introducing evidence that Deedy acted with a knowing, reckless, 
or negligent state of mind.  Id.  Thus, it is incorrect to contend, as Deedy 
does, that the State “opted not to adduce” evidence of the recklessness state 
of mind when it focused its case on the intentional state of mind.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
46 216, 35 P.3d 233, 243 (2001) (“ HRS § 703 –310 quite plainly 
instructs that self- defense is not available as justification 
where a defendant believes that the use of force is necessary, 
but is reckless or negligent in so believing .”).  Deedy places 
inordinate emphasis on his claim that the evidence at a third 
trial will not be substantially different from that introduced 
at the first and second trials.  While “[t] his court has 
indicated that whether the evidence submitted in a subsequent 
trial would be substantially different from prior trials is 
relevant” in evaluating the fourth Moriwake  factor, this court 
has never held that it is dispositive as to whether this factor 
favors retrial. 
 Deguair, 136 Hawai i at 89, 358 P.3d at 61 . 
  The primary focus of this factor is the likelihood of 
any substantial difference in a subsequent trial, which includes 
not only the evidence presented, but also the theory of guilt, 
the applicable defenses, and the likelihood of a verdict as 
opposed to a hung jury.  See, e.g. , id. (noting that not only 
was evidence to be offered at a third trial substantially the 
same as the second trial, it was also not likely that there 
would be a substantial difference in the result of a third 
trial).  Here, the circuit court concluded that the differing 
emphasis of the prosecution’s case, as well as the manner in 
which the evidence will be characterized (even assuming that the 
evidence will closely parallel the evidence in the first and ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
47 second trials), could reasonably make a substantial difference 
in a subsequent trial.  See id.; Hinton , 120 Hawai i at 279, 204 
P.3d at 498.  Thus, this is unlike Moriwake , in which the court 
stated, “There was no indication that a third trial would 
proceed in a manner any different than did the previous two.”   
Moriwake, 65 Haw. at 57, 647 P.2d at 713.  Based on the circuit 
court’s analysis, it cannot be said that the court abused its 
discretion in weighing this factor in favor of retrial. 
5. The trial court’s own evaluation of relative case strength  
  As to the fifth factor, the circuit court concluded 
that the “[r]esolution of this case is based in large part upon 
credibility and the factual application of the self- defense 
defense provisions during the series of alleged events” and that 
the evidence would be sufficient either to convict or acquit 
Deedy “depending upon who and what a jury elected to believe.”   
Thus, the circuit court rejected the argument that the 
government’s case was inherently flawed or too weak to support a 
conviction, and therefore, the court determined that this factor 
favored retrial.  Deedy, on the other hand, argues that the 
State’s evidence is not compelling or weighty and that his 
defenses are not implausible; thus, Deedy believes that this 
factor weighs in favor of dismissal.  The State contends that 
the circuit court did not abuse its discretion with respect to 
the fifth factor because the jury rejected Deedy’s argument that ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
48 his conduct was justified and because a reasonable jury could 
find that Deedy acted with a reckless state of mind.   
  The circuit court’s findings and conclusions in its 
written order reflect that it duly considered the evidence 
adduced at trial and, cognizant of Moriwake ’s dictates,  that it 
impartially evaluated each party’s case  and weighed these 
considerations against fundamental fairness to Deedy.  See 
Hinton, 120 Hawai i at 280, 204 P.3d at  499 (although the trial 
court did not make a specific finding or conclusion on the fifth 
factor, in its final analysis , the court “‘balanced’  the 
relative case strength factor and determined it weighed in favor 
of retrial ”).  Indeed, the circuit court in this case expressly 
stated in its Moriwake  ruling that it was taking judicial notice 
of “all pre-trial matters,” “jury selection, both trials, jury 
communications, and all post-trial matters. ”  The court, in 
clear recognition of Moriwake, also stated that it was “mandated 
to balance the interest of the State against fundamental 
fairness to a defendant with the added ingredient of the orderly 
functioning of the court system.”   The circuit court having 
overseen both trials and having closely evaluated the evidence 
concluded that the State’s evidence was of sufficient strength 
for a jury to return a guilty verdict on the reckless 
manslaughter charge.  This is in contrast to  what the trial 
court concluded in Deguair, where the quality of the Stat e’s ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
49 evidence was so lacking that this court agreed with  the circuit 
court’s conclusion  that relative case strength favored 
dismissal.  See Deguair , 136 Hawai i  at 90, 358 P.3d at 62.  
There is no indication in the record to refute the circuit 
court’s determination that the evidence was sufficiently strong 
to support a conviction on retrial.  Accordingly, the trial 
court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that its 
evaluation of relative case strength favored retrial. 
6. The professional conduct and diligence of respective counsel, 
particularly that of the prosecuting attorney 
  Because “[c]ounsel acted with diligence and did the 
best job they could do,” the circuit court concluded that this 
factor weighs in favor of retrial.  For the same reason, Deedy 
contends that this factor weighs in favor of dismissal as there 
can be no inference that the State can litigate its case any 
better at a retrial.   The Sta te argues that the circuit court 
did not abuse its discretion with respect to this factor and 
claims that Deedy “ignores the practical consequences of the 
jury acquitting him of murder,” which “will require the deputy 
prosecutor to present the case in a di fferent manner.”  
  In Hinton , 120 Hawai i at 280, 204 P.3d at 499, “the 
trial court determined that this factor weighed against retrial 
inasmuch as the attorneys for both parties ‘ did a good job. ’”  
Because “the ICA did not contend that this factor weighed  in ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
50 favor of retrial,” this court accepted the circuit court’s 
analysis of this factor without independently evaluating it.  
Id.  The same is true in Deguair: because neither party 
challenged the circuit court’s determination that the 
prosecutor’s diligent  and professional presentation of the 
State’s case weighed against retrial, this court did not 
consider that determination.  Deguair , 136 Hawaii at 90, 358 
P.3d at 62. 
  The quality of counsel’s professional conduct and the 
level of their diligence could weigh either in favor or against 
retrial depending on the circumstances and specific facts of the 
case, including the result of the evaluation of other relevant 
Moriwake  factors.  For example, when it is extremely unlikely 
that there would be a substantial difference in a subsequent 
trial, as was the case in Hinton and Deguair, the trial court 
may determine that the professional conduct and diligence of 
counsel would weigh against retrial.  See Deguair, 136 Hawai i at 
89, 358 P.3d at 61 —62; Hinton, 120 Hawai i at 279, 204 P.3d at 
498—99.  This is in part because, in such an instance, it would 
appear equally unlikely that counsel’s diligence and 
professionalism would make any difference in a retrial.  On the 
other hand, in cases where there is a likelihood of a 
substantial difference in a subsequent trial, the degree of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
51 counsel’s diligence and professionalism may be found to weigh in 
favor of retrial.  In such cases, counsel’s d iligence and 
professionalism would still play a significant role and may 
influence the outcome of a retrial. 
  In this case, t he circuit court’s conclusion as to the 
sixth Moriwake factor is consistent with, and supported by, the 
circuit court’s other finding that it is likely that a third 
trial would result in substantial difference in this case 
because the presentation of the evidence at a third trial will 
be tailored to addressing the recklessness state of mind and 
because the self-defense and defense of others justifications 
could be rendered inapplicable.   See supra.   Accordingly, the 
circuit court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the 
sixth Moriwake factor favors retrial.  See  Deguair, 136 Hawai i 
at 89, 358 P.3d at 61;  Hinton, 120 Hawai i at 279, 204 P.3d at 
19498.  
                     
 19 Deedy further contends that two other factors bear relevance to 
the balancing test under Moriwake : (1) the fact that the State has expressly 
and consistently maintained that it has no evidence to support a reckless 
manslaughter charge--the same charge that will be the subject of a third 
trial--and (2) the expenses and resources that have been used in litigating 
this case are disproportionately high as compared to other cases involving 
similar charges and that a third trial will only elevate costs further for 
both Deedy and the public.  We note that Deedy raises these factors for the 
first time on appeal, and, as such, the circuit court had no opportunity to 
consider these factors in exercising its discretion pursuant to Moriwake.  In 
any event, the State did, in fact, raise in the second trial that the jury 
could find that the evidence it presented supported conviction on the lesser 
included offenses.  With respect to costs, the expense of the trial would

52 7. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion 
  While this court stated in Moriwake that “in most 
cases, serious consideration be given to dismissing an 
indictment with prejudice after a second hung jury mistrial[, ] 
this is not to say that the preclusion of even a second trial or 
the allowance of a third or even more trials would not be 
appropriate in certain circumstances.”  Moriwake , 65 Haw. at 57, 
647 P.2d at 713.  This court later reaffirmed that “ the Moriwake 
court squarely placed the discretion in the hands of the trial 
court to determine under which ‘certain circumstances’  dismissal 
after one or more mistrials would be appropriate.”   Hinton, 120 
Hawaii at 279, 204 P.3d at  498.  Axiomatic in Hinton , therefore, 
is that the trial courts  also are provided with the discretion 
to determine unde r which “certain circumstances” retrial after 
one or more mistrials would be appropriate.  See id.  In this 
case, the circuit court, after careful consideration of all of 
the relevant Moriwake  factors and in the proper exercise of its 
discretion, determine
d that under the circumstances of this 
case, a retrial after two prior mistrials is the outcome that 
the Moriwake  framework provides.  See id. 
                                                                        
(. . . continued) 
 
appear to be contraindicative of whether a third trial should be allowed, as 
costs may be related to the complexity of the case.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
53   We will not disturb this determination because it is 
manifest that the circuit court duly considered the rules and 
principles of law underlying Moriwake .  The circuit court was 
aware of the applicable factor- balancing test, analyzed each 
factor in light of the facts and circumstances of this case, and 
weighed the factors in accordance with the canons of Moriwake .  
See supra .  Thus, it cannot be concluded that the circuit court 
“disregard[ed] rules or principles of law or practice to the 
substantial detriment of a party litigant.”  Deguair, 136 Hawai i 
at 84–85, 358 P.3d at 56 –57 (quoting Hinton, 120 Hawaii at 273, 
204 P.3d at 492). 
  Further, it is evident from the circuit court’s 
Moriwake ruling that the findings and conclusions it made with 
respect to each of the Moriwake factors are based on facts in 
the record, reasonable inferences from the record, and a logical 
process of reasoning.  See, e.g. , id. at 88—90, 358 P.3d at 60 —
62 (concluding that the circuit court did not exceed the bounds 
of reason because its Moriwake ruling was based on findings and 
conclusions supported by the record and obtained by duly 
considering and weighing the relevant Moriwake  factors).  
Accordingly, it cannot be said that the circuit court in this 
case “exceed[ed]  the bounds of reason ” in its findings and 
conclusions with respect to the Moriwake  factors and the manner ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
54 in which the factors were weighed and balanced.  Id. at 84–85, 
358 P.3d at 56 –57 (quoting Hinton, 120 Hawai i at 273, 204 P.3d 
at 492).   
  We reaffirm that in cases involving a trial court’s 
application of the Moriwake factor- balancing test, deference is 
accorded to the court’s findings and conclusion s.  Moriwake , 65 
Haw. at 56, 647 P.2d at 712.  As this court has underscored, 
Moriwake  rulings are “accord[ed ] deference . . . for much the 
same reason that [an appellate court] will seldom question the 
20propriety of a hung jury mistrial declaration.”  Id.  
                     
 20 As this court stated,  
there are especially compelling reasons for allowing the 
trial judge to exercise broad discretion in deciding 
whether or not “manifest necessity” justifies a discharge 
of the jury.  On the one hand, if [the judge] discharges 
the jury when further deliberations may produce a fair  
verdict, the defendant is deprived of his “valued right to 
have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.”  But if 
[the judge] fails to discharge a jury which is unable to 
reach a verdict after protracted and exhausting 
deliberations, there exists a significant risk that a 
verdict may result from pressures inherent in the situation 
rather than the considered judgment of all the jurors. . . 
. The trial judge’s decision to declare a mistrial when 
[the judge] considers the jury deadlocked is therefore 
accorded great deference by a reviewing court.  
Moriwake , 65 Haw. at 52 –53, 647 P.2d at 710 (quoting Arizona v. Washington , 
434 U.S. 497, 509— 10 (1978)).  In Arizona, upon which the Moriwake  court 
relied, the Supreme Court noted that the reason “for this defer ence in the 
‘hung’ jury situation is that the trial court is in the best position to 
assess all the factors  which must be considered in making a necessarily 
discretionary determination whether the jury will be able to reach a just 
verdict if it continues t o deliberate.”  434 U.S. at 510 n.28 (emphasis 
added).  The same is true in the Moriwake context because the trial court is 
the tribunal most intimately acquainted with the facts and circumstances of 
the case and has been personally involved in the procedu
ral history of the 
case, including the conduct of the prior trials, and the development of the 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
55   In view of the foregoing principles, and according 
appropriate deference to the findings and conclusions of the 
circuit court in this case, the circuit court did not exceed the 
bounds of reason or disregard rules or legal principles when it 
concluded that all of the following  factors --the severity of the 
offense, character of prior trials, likelihood of any 
substantial difference in a subsequent trial, relative case 
strength, and the quality of counsel-- did not favor dismissal.  
Id.; Deguair, 136 Hawai i at 84– 85, 358 P.3d at 56 –57.  In a 
similar vein, the circuit court did not exceed the bounds of 
reason or disregard rules or legal principles when it determined 
that one factor--the number of prior trials--has a neutral 
effect on whether a retrial is appropriate.  Deguair , 136 Hawai i 
at 84–85, 358 P.3d at 56 –57 (quoting Hinton, 120 Hawai i at 273, 
204 P.3d at 492). 
  Accordingly, the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion in denying Deedy’s motion to dismiss after “balancing 
the interest of the state against fundamental fairness to a 
                                                                        
(. . . continued) 
 
record; has seen firsthand and independently appraised the evidence and the 
credibility of the witnesses; and has closely observed the jury and the 
manner in which the jury deliberated.  Thus, the trial court is clearly in 
the “best position” to consider and weigh the Moriwake factors relevant to 
determining whether a case should be retried or dismissed with prejudice.  
Cf. Arizona, 434 U.S. at 510 n.28.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
56 defendant with the added ingredient of the orderly functioning 
of the court system.”  Moriwake, 65 Haw. at  56, 647 P.2d at  712.  
E. Supremacy Clause Immunity 
  Lastly, Deedy contends that the Supremacy Clause of 
the U.S. Constitution shields him from prosecution under the 
criminal laws of Hawai i.  Deedy maintains that he is immune from 
prosecution for a violation of a state’ s criminal laws because 
his actions arose out of his performance of his duty as a 
federal agent.  Deedy argues that Supremacy Clause immunity 
applies to him because he did not exceed his authority or 
wantonly violate state criminal law when he fired the fatal 
shot.  Deedy asserts that “state law is irrelevant” in analyzing 
whether he is immune and that “violations of agency policy,” 
“errors of judgment,” and his “mistakes of fact” do not s uffice 
to deny him of Supremacy Clause immunity.  Accordingly, Deedy 
concludes that the circuit court should have granted his 
dismissal motion based on federal constitutional law. 
  Under the U.S. Constitution, a federal officer is 
entitled to Supremacy Clause immunity “ only when his acts are 
both (1) authorized by the laws of the United States and (2) 
necessary and proper to the execution of his responsibilities. ”  
Morgan v. California , 743 F.2d 728, 731 (9th Cir. 1984).  The 
court must view the 
evidence “ in the light most favorable to the 
state.”  Id. at 733 .  When there is “a conflict of evidence” as ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
to the elements of Supremacy Clause immunity (e.g., whether the 
defendant’s conduct is authorized by federal law), “ the state 
court ha[s] jurisdiction ,” and the defendant would not be immune 
from state prosecution.  United States ex rel. Drury v. Lewis , 
200 U.S. 1, 7–
8 (1906). 
57   Special Agent Matthew Golbus, the resident agent of 
the Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) in the Honolulu resident 
office, testified that the authority for special agents with the 
21DSS comes from 22 U.S.C. 2709 (2012).   Thus, Deedy’s general 
                     
 21 At the time of the incident, 22 U.S.C. 2709 stated in relevant 
part as follows: 
(a)
 General authority  
Under such regulations as the Secretary of State may 
prescribe, special agents of the Department of State and 
the Foreign Service may--
 
(1) conduct investigations concerning illegal passport 
or visa issuance or use;  
. . .  
(2) obtain and execute search and arrest warrants, as 
well as obtain and serve subpoenas and summonses issued 
under the authority of the United States;  
(3) protect and perform protective functions directly 
related to maintaining the security and safety of 
[designated officials and their family members and 
foreign missions ]
; 
. . .  
(4) if designated by the Secretary and qualified, under 
regulations approved by the Attorney General, for the 
use of firearms, carry firearms for the purpose of 
performing the duties authorized by this section; and  
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
58 duties and the scope of his authority were defined and 
delineated by 22 U.S.C. § 2709, and, as relevant to the facts of 
this case, Deedy had the authority to “make arrests . . . for 
any offense against the United States committed in [his] 
presence, or for any felony cognizable under the law of the 
United States.”  22 U.S.C. § 2709(a)(5).  
  Deedy maintains that his actions were authorized by 18 
U.S.C. § 111(a)(1) (2012), which provides that whoever “ forcibly 
assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes 
with any person designated in section 1114 of this title while 
engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties ” 
is punishable under federal law.  (Emphasis added.)   The 
argument appears to be that Deedy was authorized to arrest the 
deceased and to use deadly force in effectuating such arrest 
because the deceased assaulted him while he was engaged in the 
performance of official duties--a course of conduct prohibited 
by 18 U.S.C. § 111(a)(1). 
                                                                        
(. . . continued) 
 
(5) make arrests without warrant for any offense 
against the United States committed in their presence,
or for any felony cognizable under the laws of the  
United States  if they have reasonable grounds to 
believe that the person to be arrested has committed or 
is committing such felony.  
. . . . 
22 U.S.C. § 2709 (2012) (underlining added) (footnote omitted).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
59   However, Deedy does not explain how a night of 
socializing and drinking alcoholic beverages in Waikīk ī with 
friends was part of his “official duties ” as a State Department 
agent within the meaning of that phrase in 18 U.S.C. § 111(a)(1) 
such that he was authorized by 18 U.S.C. § 111 and 22 U.S.C. § 
2709 to arrest the deceased and, if necessary, to inflict deadly 
force upon him.  Cf.
 Cunningham v. Neagle , 135 U.S. 1, 52 –53 
(1890) (federal marshal was authorized to fatally shoot an 
individual who attacked a Supreme Court justice whom the marshal 
was tasked to protect);  Wyoming v. Livingston , 443 F.3d 1211, 
1226 (10th Cir. 2006) (agents who trespassed on private property 
were authorized by the Endangered Species Act to monitor wolves 
and were thus performing their official duties).  That Deedy was 
not engaged in the performance of his official duties is 
substantiated by Speci al Agent Golbus’s testimony that DSS 
agents are specifically authorized , pursuant to internal State 
Department policy, to carry firearms “[i]n the performance of 
their duties with respect to investigating passport and visa 
issuance or use in performing protective functions.”  On the 
night of Deedy’s altercation wi th the deceased, Deedy was not 
investigating passport and visa issuance or performing 
protective functions or any other conduct enumerated in 22 
U.S.C. § 2709(a); rather, he was drinking alcoholic beverages at 
multiple bars and then ate at a fast- food rest aurant in Waik īkī. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
60 Because Deedy does not provide any federal authority 
for the proposition that his activities that evening were part 
of his official duties, this court need not reach the issue of 
whether Deedy’s actions were “ necessary and proper to the 
execution of his responsibilities .”  However, even assuming that 
Deedy was performing an official duty when he shot the deceased, 
Deedy does not explicate  how his conduct was necessary and 
proper, under the circumstances, to the execution of that duty.  
Even Deedy’s expert witness testified that a federal agent “just 
can’t shoot anybody just ‘cause [that person] say[s] [he is] 
going to kill [the agent] and [he] starts coming at [the 
agent].”  Deedy’s expert witness further testified that federal 
agents “sho uld not instigate confrontation ” and that they should 
not “use deadl y force in a situation in which [they] ha[ve] 
created the need for such force.” 
Finally, even assuming that the evidence was 
conflicting as to whether Deedy’s conduct was authorized by 
federal law or as to whether his actions were necessary and 
proper to the execution of his responsibilities, “the state 
court” has jurisdiction, and Deedy would not be immune from 
state prosecution.  Lewis
, 200 U.S. at  7–8.  Accordingly, Deedy 
is not immune from state prosecution under the Supremacy Clause. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
61 V. CONCLUSION  
  Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court’s 
(1) Order Denying Defendant Deedy’s Motion to Dismiss Under 
State v. Moriwake ; (2) Order Denying Defendant Deedy’s Motion to 
Dismiss Under the United States Constitution; (3) Order Denying 
Defendant Deedy’s Motion to Dismiss Under the Hawaii 
Constitution; and (4) Order Denying Defendant Deedy’s Motion to 
Dismiss Under Haw. Rev. Stat. §§ 701- 109, 701- 110, and 701-111 .  
This case is remanded to the circuit court for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
