OPINIONS OF THE COURT 
PART ONE 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., with whom Nakayama,
McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ., join) 
I. Introduction 
Appellant Tax Foundation of Hawaiʻi challenges the 
Sta
te of Hawaii’s implementation of Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 248-2.6 (Supp. 2015), which authorizes the State to be 
reimbursed for its costs in administering a rail surcharge on 
state general excise and use taxes on behalf of the City and 
County of Honolulu. More specifically, the issues on appeal are: (1) whether we lack jurisdiction because this is a 
“controversy with respect to taxes” under HRS § 632-1; (2) 
whether Tax Foundation has standing to bring its challenge; (3) 
whether the State violated HRS § 248-2.6 by retaining 10% of the 
gross proceeds of the surcharge without calculating the actual 
cost of administering the surcharge; and (4) whether the State’s 
application of HRS § 248-2.6 is unconstitutional. 
We co
nclude that: (1) the circuit court had 
jurisdiction to hear Tax Foundation’s claims because its complaint was not a “controversy with respect to taxes” within 
the meaning of HRS § 632-1; (2) Tax Foundation has standing
2; (3) 
(c
ontinued . . .) 
2 2 Four members of this court have determined that Tax Foundation has 
standing, but on different grounds. Justices McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the State did not violate HRS § 248-2.6 by retaining 10% of the 
gross proceeds of the surcharge; and (4) the State’s application 
of HRS § 248-2.6 does not violate the Hawaiʻi or United States 
C
onstitutions. Accordingly, we vacate the circuit court’s order 
and judgment granting the State’s motion to dismiss for lack of 
jurisdiction, and remand this case to the circuit court with 
instructions to grant the State’s motion for summary judgment on 
the merits. 
II. Background 
A. Act 247 
In 2005, the legislature enacted Act 247, authorizing 
counties to impose a surcharge of up to 0.5% on state general excise and use taxes. 2005 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 247, §§ 3-4 at 
770-72. The purpose of Act 247 was to allow counties to levy 
surcharges “to fund public transportation systems.” Id., § 1 at 
770. The county surcharges are levied, assessed, collected, and 
otherwise administered by the Department of Taxation (DOTAX). 
Id., § 3 at 771. After collecting the surcharge, DOTAX 
(. . . continued)
conclude that Tax Foundation established standing under HRS § 632-1, and as
s
uch, do not believe it is necessary to address taxpayer standing. I 
conclude that Tax Foundation has satisfied the requirements of taxpayer
standing. Justice Nakayama concludes that Tax Foundation does not have
standing to challenge the State’s implementation of HRS § 248-2.6. See Part 
II, the Dissenting Opinion by Recktenwald, C.J., and the Dissenting Opinion
by Nakayama, J., for detailed discussions regarding Tax Foundation’s
standing. 
3 3 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
transmits the funds to the State Department of Budget and 
Finance (Budget and Finance), which deposits them into special 
accounts. Id., § 5 at 773. After deducting and withholding 
costs as specified in HRS § 248-2.6, Budget and Finance 3 
HRS § 248-2.6 (Supp. 2015) provides: 
(a) If adopted by county ordinance, all county
surcharges on state tax collected by the director of
taxation shall be paid into the state treasuryquarterly, within ten working days after collection,and shall be placed by the director of finance in
special accounts. Out of the revenues generated by
county surcharges on state tax paid into each
respective state treasury special account, the
director of finance shall deduct ten per cent of the
gross proceeds of a respective county’s surcharge on
state tax to reimburse the State for the costs of assessment, collection, and disposition of the countysurcharge on state tax incurred by the State.Amounts retained shall be general fund realizationsof the State. 
(b) The amounts deducted for costs of assessment,
collection, and disposition of county surcharges on
state tax shall be withheld from payment to the
counties by the State out of the county surcharges on
state tax collected for the current calendar year. 
(
c) For the purpose of this section, the costs of
assessment, collection, and disposition of the county
surcharges on state tax shall include any and all
costs, direct or indirect, that are deemed necessaryand proper to effectively administer this section andsections 237-8.6 and 238-2.6. 
(d) After the deduction and withholding of the costs
under subsections (a) and (b), the director of
finance shall pay the remaining balance on [a]
quarterly basis to the director of finance of each
county that has adopted a county surcharge on state
tax under section 46-16.8. The quarterly payments
shall be made after the county surcharges on statetax have been paid into the state treasury specialaccounts or after the disposition of any tax appeal,as the case may be. All county surcharges on statetax collected shall be distributed by the director of
finance to the county in which the county surcharge
on state tax is generated and shall be a general fund
realization of the county, to be used for the 
(continued . . .)

disburses the remaining balance to each applicable county’s 
Director of Finance. Id., § 5 at 773. 
B. Proceedings in the Circuit Court4 
1. Tax Foundation’s Complaint 
On October 21, 2015, Tax Foundation of Hawai ʻi (Tax 
Foundation) filed a class action5 on behalf of all taxpayers in 
the City and County of Honolulu. The complaint alleged6 that 
after Act 247 was enacted, the City and County of Honolulu 
enacted Ordinance 05-027, imposing a surcharge on state general 
excise and use taxes (Honolulu County surcharge). Tax 
Foundation asserted the following about the surcharge. Honolulu 
is the only county to have adopted such a surcharge. Budget and 
Finance has retained 10%7 of the Honolulu County surcharge 
(. . . continued)
purposes specified in section 46-16.8 by each of the
counties. 
(Emphases added.) 
4 The Honorable Edwin C. Nacino presided. 
5 Nothing in the record shows that the class was certified. 
6 The following factual allegations taken from the complaint appear to be
uncontested. 
We note that Act 1 (S.B. 4), 29th Leg., 1st Spec. Sess. (2017), was
enacted on September 5, 2017, and among other things, amended the State’s
withholding from 10% to 1% of gross proceeds of the surcharge. This newly
enacted legislation postdates the period at issue here, and therefore doesnot affect our consideration of the State’s previous application of HRS §
248-2.6. To avoid confusion, all references to the surcharge withholding
under HRS § 248-2.6(a) in this opinion will be to the 10% figure. 
5 7 8 Act 213, SLH 2007, § 121 required DOTAX to provide two years of
reporting that detailed the level of staffing and funding necessary to
administer county surcharge collections. DOTAX reported that the total
amount budgeted for staffing positions was $749,876 for the 2008 fiscal year
and $700,508 for the 2009 fiscal year. Apart from the 2008 and 2009 fiscal
years, it appears undisputed that DOTAX has not calculated the actual costs
incurred in assessing, collecting, and distributing the surcharge, asserting
that it is not “necessary or required” to perform such an analysis. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
amounts collected by DOTAX since it was initially levied, and 
disbursed the remaining 90% to the City and County of Honolulu. 
During the fiscal years ending June 30, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 
2015, Budget and Finance retained approximately $21.2, $19.3, 
$24.2, and $24.8 million, respectively, which went to the State 
general fund. As of December 31, 2015, the cumulative total of 
the State’s surcharge withholdings was $177,865,487.24. 
Tax Foundation also alleged that the State violated 
HRS § 248-2.6(d) by retaining 10% of the City and County of Honolulu’s surcharge gross proceeds without calculating the 
actual costs of administering it.
8 Tax Foundation alleged that 
the 10% retained by the State “grossly exceed[ed]” the costs 
incurred to assess, collect, and dispose of the Honolulu County 
surcharge funds. Tax Foundation further alleged that City and 
County of Honolulu taxpayers were required to pay a higher state 
tax than taxpayers of other counties as a result of the State’s 
failure to follow HRS § 248-2.6, that the State had violated the 
general laws provision in Article VIII, § 1 of the Hawaii 
6 9 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Constitution, and violated the equal protection clauses of the 
Hawaii and United States Constitutions. 
Tax 
Foundation sought declaratory, injunctive, and 
mandamus relief. In Count I, Tax Foundation sought an “order 
enjoining the State from continuing to violate” constitutional 
provisions and injunctive relief in the form of reimbursements, 
to the plaintiffs “and/or” the City and County of Honolulu, of 
amounts “improperly kept by the State.” In Count II, Tax 
Foundation sought “mandamus directing the State to follow HRS 
§ 248-2.6(d), and deduct and withhold only the cost of 
administering the Oahu surcharge and to pay the remaining 
balance of the 10% county surcharge initially withheld to 
Honolulu.” 
2. The State’s Motion to Dismiss 
The State filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, 
a
sserting: (1) the circuit court lacked jurisdiction because 
HRS § 632-1 (1993) prohibits declaratory relief in “‘any 9
HRS § 632-1 provides in relevant part: 
In cases of actual controversy, courts of record,
w
ithin the scope of their respective jurisdictions,
shall have power to make binding adjudications of
right, whether or not consequential relief is, or atthe time could be, claimed, and no action orproceeding shall be open to objection on the groundthat a judgment or order merely declaratory of rightis prayed for; provided that declaratory relief may
not be obtained in any district court, or in any
controversy with respect to taxes, or in any case
where a divorce or annulment of marriage is sought.
(c
ontinued . . .) 
7 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
controversy’ with respect to taxes,” (2) mandamus and injunctive 
relief was not warranted because HRS §§ 40-35 (Supp. 2006)10 and 
232-14.5 (Supp. 2006)11 provided adequate and exclusive remedies 
for tax disputes in tax appeal court, and (3) Tax Foundation 
lacked standing. Regarding the relief sought by Tax Foundation, 
the State argued that “any taxpayer can pay a tax under protest 
and file suit for a refund under section 40-35, HRS, or timely file a tax refund claim and appeal from a denial of the refund 
claim to the Tax Appeal Court under section 232-14.5, HRS.” 
3. Tax Foundation’s Opposition to the State’s Motion to
D
ismiss 
Ta
x Foundation opposed the State’s motion to dismiss, 
arguing that the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction because its complaint did not challenge the assessment or collection of taxes, but rather sought to correct mishandling 
(. . . continued)
Controversies involving the interpretation of deeds,
wil
ls, other instruments of writing, statutes,
municipal ordinances, and other governmental
regulations, may be so determined, and this
enumeration does not exclude other instances of 
actual antagonistic assertion and denial of right. 
(Emp
hasis added.) 
10 HRS § 40-35(b) provides that “[a]ny action to recover payment of taxes
under protest shall be commenced in the tax appeal court.” 
11 HRS § 232-14.5(a) provides that “[t]he denial in whole or in part by
the department of taxation of a tax refund claim may be appealed by the
filing of a written notice of appeal to a board of review or the tax appeal
court within thirty days after notice of the denial of the claim.” 
8 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
after assessment and collection of the Honolulu County 
surcharge. Tax Foundation argued that the matter was not a “tax 
controversy” or an attack on the State’s ability to collect 
taxes, and was instead an attempt to force the State to comply 
with HRS § 248-2.6. 
Tax Foundation analogized to the ICA opinion in Hawaii 
I
nsurers Council v. Lingle, where the ICA held that HRS § 632-
1’s prohibition on actions regarding taxes did not apply because 
the plaintiff was not attempting to keep the State from 
assessing and collecting taxes. 117 Hawaiʻi 454, 184 P.2d 769 
(
App. 2008), aff’d in part and rev’d in part on other grounds, 
120 Hawaiʻi 51, 201 P.3d 564 (2008) . 
Ta
x Foundation also changed its position regarding the 
relief it was requesting. Although Tax Foundation initially 
sought reimbursement to itself “and/or” the City and County of 
Honolulu in its complaint, in its opposition, it stated that it “does not seek any refund for itself or any other taxpayer.” Tax Foundation argued that since it did not seek a declaratory 
ruling as to its own liability for taxes, and only sought to 
have the State pay its excess surcharge withholdings to the City 
and County of Honolulu, its claim did not belong in tax appeal 
court. 
Tax Foundation asserted that it had standing because 
it paid general excise tax on income derived from fundraising 
9 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that it conducted to support its activities. As to the injury 
suffered, Tax Foundation argued that if the State returned the 
excess funds it had diverted to the City and County of Honolulu, 
the Honolulu surcharge “could end sooner.” Tax Foundation 
argued that this injury was traceable to the State’s actions, 
and was redressable, asserting that “the State could, if it 
chose, determine the costs” of administering the Honolulu County surcharge. 
4. Motions for Summary Judgment 
Tax Foundation filed a motion for summary judgment, 
and argued, inter alia, that the “plain and unambiguous language of HRS § 248-2.6” supported its interpretation, and that the 
State’s reading of HRS § 248-2.6 is unconstitutional and forces 
the City and County of Honolulu taxpayers to subsidize the rest 
of the State. 
In its cross-motion for summary judgment, the State 
argued: (1) the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over Tax 
Foundation’s claims, (2) HRS § 248-2.6 expressly requires that 
the State retain 10% of the Honolulu County surcharge, (3) 
retention of 10% does not violate the equal protection clause, 
(4) retention of 10% is consistent with the general laws 
provision of the state constitution, and (5) Tax Foundation was 
challenging a “policy decision” and should seek a statutory 
amendment from the legislature. 
10 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
5. Hearing on the Motions 
At a hearing on the various motions, the circuit court 
found that Tax Foundation’s complaint presented a controversy 
arising out of a tax, and that it lacked jurisdiction over the 
dispute based on HRS § 632-1, stating that HRS § 632-1 “broadly 
implies many controversies that can arise out of a tax.” Tax 
Foundation orally requested leave to amend its complaint to clarify that the declaratory relief it sought was not subject to 
HRS § 632-1’s prohibition against tax controversies. The 
circuit court denied the request. The circuit court also 
determined that it lacked authority to impose mandamus relief on 
another branch of government. Thus, the circuit court granted 
the State’s motion to dismiss, and did not reach the issue of 
whether Tax Foundation had standing. The court further ruled 
that the cross-motions for summary judgment were moot. 
The circuit court subsequently filed its written order 
granting the State’s motion to dismiss. The order stated: 
The court, having read the memoranda in support and
in opposition to the motion and the declarations
filed therewith, and having heard the arguments of
counsel, and based on the records and files herein
and for good cause shown, GRANTS Defendant STATE OF
HAWAII’S Motion to Dismiss Complaint Filed on October
21,2015 (Filed on November 10, 2015) for the reason
that Plaintiff’s claims for relief are barred by
section 632-1, Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes, because
Plaintiff’s complaint constitutes or involves “a
controversy with respect to taxes,” and thus thiscourt lacks subject matter jurisdiction. 
Plaintiff’s request for leave to amend their
complaint filed on October 21, 2015 is denied for the 
11 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
reason that the Court has dismissed the Plaintiff’s 
complaint. 
The parties’ cross motions for summary judgment filed
on January 21, 2016, and March 3, 2016, respectivelyare, therefore moot, given the Court’s decision to
grant Defendant’s motion to dismiss the complaint. 
Final judgment was entered on June 1, 2016. 
C. Appeal 
Tax Foundation timely appealed, seeking review of the 
circuit court’s judgment and order granting the State’s motion 
to dismiss. We granted Tax Foundation’s subsequent request to 
transfer the appeal to this court. 
1. Tax Foundation’s Opening Brief 
Tax Foundation raises three points of error. Tax 
Foundation argues that the circuit court erred in: (1) granting 
the State’s motion to dismiss on the basis that it had no 
jurisdiction because the complaint sought declaratory relief 
involving a controversy with respect to taxes, (2) not granting 
Tax Foundation’s motion for summary judgment, and (3) not allowing Tax Foundation the opportunity to amend its complaint. 
As to the first point of error, Tax Foundation argues 
“[t]his is NOT a dispute over taxes.” (Capitalization in 
original). Tax Foundation asserts that its claim “arises from, 
and involves, only what the State does after the Surcharge has 
been assessed, collected, and deposited into the State’s 
coffers.” (Emphasis in original). Tax Foundation emphasizes 
the portion of HRS § 632-1 providing that controversies 
12 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
involving the interpretation of statutes are not prohibited.12 
Tax Foundation argues that HRS § 632-1 allows a declaratory 
ruling on the proper interpretation of HRS § 248-2.6 because 
such declaratory relief would not affect the State’s ability to 
assess or collect the general excise tax or the Honolulu County 
surcharge. 
Tax Foundation also argues that the tax appeal court’s 
limited jurisdiction would not include the claims in its 
complaint. HRS § 232-13 limits the jurisdiction of the tax 
appeal court to determining “‘the amount of valuation or taxes, 
as the case may be, in dispute[.]’” The liability for paying 
the general excise tax or Honolulu County surcharge is 
undisputed; therefore, Tax Foundation argues, the tax appeal 
court does not have jurisdiction over this case. 
As to the second point of error, Tax Foundation 
asserts that HRS § 248-2.6 is “clear and unambiguous[,]” and 
mandates that the State should retain only the costs it incurs 
in administering the Honolulu County surcharge. 
As to the third point of error, Tax Foundation argues 
t
hat the circuit court abused its discretion in not allowing it 
HRS § 632-1(a) provides, in relevant part: 
[D]eclaratory relief may not be obtained in any
district court, or in any controversy with respect to
taxes . . . . Controversies involving theinterpretation of . . . statutes . . . may be sodetermined[.] 
13 12 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“at least one opportunity to amend” its complaint. Tax 
Foundation cites Hawai ʻi Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 
15(a)(2)13 and case law stating that in the absence of an 
apparent or declared reason, such as undue delay, bad faith, or 
dilatory motive, leave to amend should be freely given.14 
2. The State’s Answering Brief 
I
n its Answering Brief, the State argues: (1) the 
circuit court correctly dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because it is a tax controversy under HRS 
§ 632-1, (2) the circuit court correctly denied Tax Foundation’s 
request for mandamus relief, (3) Tax Foundation does not have 
standing, (4) Tax Foundation improperly argues the merits of the case, (5) the State should prevail on the merits, and (6) the 
circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying Tax 
Foundation’s oral motion to amend its complaint. The State also 
13 HRCP Rule 15(a) (2012) provides in pertinent part: 
Amendments before trial. 
(1) AMENDING AS A MATTER OF COURSE. A party may
amend the party’s pleading once as a matter of course
at any time before a responsive pleading is served . . . 
(2) OTHER AMENDMENTS. In all other cases, a
party may amend the party’s pleading only by leave
of court or by written consent of the adverse party;
and leave shall be freely given when justice so
requires. . . . 
14 Since we conclude that the circuit court had jurisdiction, see infra,
we do not address this argument further. 
14 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
argues that Tax Foundation is “[a]sking the court to interfere 
with a statute . . . [which] violates the separation of powers 
at the heart of our system of government.” 
As to subject matter jurisdiction, the State argues 
that the plain language of HRS § 632-1 supports dismissal, 
because HRS § 632-1 applies to “‘any controversy with respect to 
taxes’” instead of being limited to the assessment or collection of taxes. The State asserts that interpretations of the federal 
Declaratory Judgment Act and Tax Anti-Injunction Act protect not 
just assessment and collection, but “any activities that are 
intended to or may culminate in the assessment or collection of 
taxes[.]” The State argues that Tax Foundation’s lawsuit “may 
ultimately culminate in the ‘collection’ of the State’s portion 
of the taxes being obstructed.” 
The State also argues that this type of case belongs 
in tax appeal court rather than in circuit court. The State 
argues that the tax appeal court has jurisdiction to hear: (1) “‘taxpayer appeals from assessments’” pursuant to HRS Chapter 
232, (2) “‘challenges to taxes paid under protest’” pursuant to 
HRS § 40-35, (3) “‘adverse rulings by the Director,’” and (4) 
appeals from the denial of refund claims by DOTAX pursuant to 
HRS § 232-14.5. The State also argues that, even if the court 
finds that this case is not a “controversy with respect to 
taxes,” the circuit court lacks jurisdiction because the tax 
15 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
appeal statutes in HRS Chapter 232 provide a “‘special form of 
remedy’ specific to tax cases” that must be followed according 
to HRS § 632-1. 
The State argues that it is appropriate for an 
appellate court to rule on the standing issue presented in the 
State’s motion to dismiss, asserting that standing is a 
jurisdictional matter that the court must address as a threshold matter. The State further asserts that Tax Foundation does not 
satisfy the first and third prongs of the Sierra Club v. Hawai ʻi 
Tourism Authority, 100 Hawai ʻi 
 242, 59 P.3d 877 (2002) (plurality 
op
inion) test for standing.15 
As to the merits, the State argues that although “it 
would be improper for this Court to decide this case on the 
merits when the circuit court did not have an opportunity to 
address the merits first[,]” if this court decides to address 
the merits, the State should prevail as a matter of law based on the rules of statutory construction, legislative intent, and principles of statutory interpretation. 
3. Tax Foundation’s Reply Brief 
The three-part test used to determine whether a plaintiff has standing
is whether: (1) the plaintiff has suffered “an actual or threatened injury”
as a result of the defendant’s wrongful conduct, (2) the injury is fairly
traceable to the defendant’s actions, and (3) a favorable decision would
likely provide relief for the plaintiff’s injury. Sierra Club, 100 Hawaiʻi at 
250, 59 P.3d at 885 (citation omitted). 
16 15 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In its Reply Brief, Tax Foundation argues: (1) the 
circuit court had jurisdiction pursuant to the ICA’s decision in 
Hawaii Insurers Council, (2) Tax Foundation has standing, (3) 
the State misreads HRS § 248-2.6, (4) the State’s interpretation 
of HRS § 248-2.6 is not consistent with the intent of the 
legislature, and (5) the circuit court erred in not allowing Tax 
Foundation to amend its complaint and amendment would not be futile. 
III. Standards of Review 
A. Existence of Jurisdiction and Dismissal for Lack of 
Jurisdiction 
“The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law 
that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard.” Lingle 
v. Hawaiʻi Gov’t Employees Ass’n, AFSCME, Local 152, 107 Hawaiʻi 
178, 182, 111 P.3d 587, 591 (2005). 
“A trial court’s dismissal for lack of subject matter 
jurisdiction is a question of law, reviewable de novo.” 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 94 Hawaiʻi 330, 337, 13 P.3d 1235, 
1242 (2000) (emphasis removed) (citing McCarthy v. United 
States, 850 F.2d 558, 560 (9th Cir. 1988)). 
Our review [of a motion to dismiss for lack of
subject matter jurisdiction] is based on the contents
of the complaint, the allegations of which we acceptas true and construe in the light most favorable tothe plaintiff. Dismissal is improper unless itappears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove noset of facts in support of his claim which would
entitle him to relief.

Casumpang, 94 Hawaiʻi at 337, 13 P.2d at 1242 (citations and 
qu
otation marks omitted). 
B. Standing 
“[T
]he issue of standing is reviewed de novo on 
appeal.” Mottl v. Miyahira, 95 Hawaiʻi 381, 388, 23 P.3d 716, 
72
3 (2001) (citation omitted). 
C. Statutory Interpretation 
“The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
re
viewable de novo.” Peer News LLC v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 
138 Hawaiʻi 53, 60, 376 P.3d 1, 8 (2016). 
D. Constitutional Questions 
“We 
review questions of constitutional law de novo, 
under the right/wrong standard.” State v. Kalaola, 124 Hawaiʻi 
43, 49, 237 P.3d 1109, 1115 (2010) (citation omitted) . 
E. Summary Judgment 
“On appeal, the grant or denial of summary judgment is 
r
eviewed de novo.” First Ins. Co. of Hawaiʻi v. A&B Properties, 
1
26 Hawaiʻi 406, 413-14, 271 P.3d 1165, 1172-73 (2012) (citation 
omitted). Furthermore, 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the
pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories
and admissions on file, together with the affidavits,
if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled
to judgment as a matter of law. A fact is material

IV. Discussion 
A
. The Relief Requested by Tax Foundation Does Not Constitute
a Tax Refund Claim 
We 
must first address whether the circuit court had 
subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate Tax Foundation’s 
complaint. The tax appeal court has exclusive jurisdiction over 
tax refund claims. HRS §§ 232-13 and 232-14.5(a),(c). HRS 
§ 232-13 states that the jurisdiction of the tax appeal court is 
limited to disputes about the “amount of valuation or taxes.” 
HRS § 232-14.5(a) provides that a denial of a tax refund claim 
by DOTAX “may be appealed by the filing of a written notice of 
appeal to a board of review or the tax appeal court[,]” and 
subsection (c) provides that “this section shall apply to tax 
refund claims for all taxes administered by the department of 
taxation.” The circuit court therefore does not have 
jurisdiction over tax refund claims, and only the tax appeal 
court may consider tax refund claims. 
The State argues that Tax Foundation seeks a tax 
reimbursement to itself and class members, and as such, presents 
a tax refund controversy over which the tax appeal court has 
exclusive jurisdiction. Tax Foundation, however, now only seeks 
19 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
reimbursement to the City and County of Honolulu. Initially, 
Tax Foundation’s complaint effectively sought a partial tax 
refund by requesting reimbursement to itself, its class members, 
“and/or” the City and County of Honolulu of the allegedly 
improperly kept surcharge funds. However, Tax Foundation later 
disclaimed any refund remedy for itself and its class members in 
its opposition to the State’s motion to dismiss, leaving only the City and County of Honolulu to recover. Therefore, taxpayer 
liability is not in dispute. 
Because the tax appeal court’s jurisdiction is limited 
to determining “the amount of valuation or taxes, as the case 
may be, in dispute[,]” HRS ' 232-13, and here there is no dispute 
about any taxpayer’s tax liability, Tax Foundation cannot bring its claim before the tax appeal court. Tax Foundation’s dispute 
concerns only the post-collection disposition of the surcharge 
funds. Accordingly, the circuit court is not barred from 
hearing Tax Foundation’s claim based on HRS § 232-14.5. 
B. HRS § 632-1 Does Not Bar Subject Matter Jurisdiction in
this Suit 
T
he parties dispute whether the circuit court 
correctly dismissed this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under HRS § 632-1, which prohibits declaratory 
20 16 In previous cases involving the issue of subject matter jurisdiction
under the tax exclusion provision of HRS § 632-1, this court has applied
various tests to determine whether the funds at issue were a tax and 
therefore subject to HRS § 632-1’s exclusionary provision, or a fee and
therefore not subject to the exclusion. See, e.g., Hawaii Insurers Council 
v. Lingle, 120 Hawaiʻi 51, 64-66, 201 P.3d 564, 577-79 (2008). As discussed 
infra, we conclude that this is not a “controversy with respect to taxes”
within the meaning of HRS § 632-1 because the prohibition against tax
controversies does not apply if the declaratory relief sought does not
interfere with the government’s ability to assess and collect taxes. We 
therefore do not make a determination on whether the funds retained by the
State are appropriately characterized as a tax or a fee, because even as a
tax, this is still not a prohibited tax controversy. Accordingly, the
circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to hear Tax Foundation’s claim. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
judgment actions in any “controversy with respect to taxes[.]”
Tax Foundation and the State make arguments related to the 
portions of HRS § 632-1 emphasized below: 16 
In cases of actual controversy, courts of record,
within the scope of their respective jurisdictions,
shall have power to make binding adjudications ofright, whether or not consequential relief is, or atthe time could be, claimed, and no action orproceeding shall be open to objection on the groundthat a judgment or order merely declaratory of right
is prayed for; provided that declaratory relief may
not be obtained in any district court, or in any
controversy with respect to taxes, or in any case
where a divorce or annulment of marriage is sought.
Controversies involving the interpretation of deeds,
wills, other instruments of writing, statutes,
municipal ordinances, and other governmental
regulations, may be so determined, and thisenumeration does not exclude other instances of actual antagonistic assertion and denial of right. 
HRS § 632-1 (emphasis added). 
The ICA has held that HRS § 632-1’s tax exclusion 
p
rovision prohibits declaratory relief in tax matters, in order 
to “permit the government to assess and collect taxes alleged to 
be due it without judicial interference.” Hawaii Insurers 
21 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Council v. Lingle, 117 Hawaiʻi 454, 463, 184 P.2d 769, 778 (App. 
2
008) (citation and quotation marks omitted), aff’d in part and 
rev’d in part on other grounds, 120 Hawaiʻi 51, 201 P.3d 564 
(2008). In Hawaii Insurers Council, an insurance trade 
association challenged the constitutionality of a statute that 
permitted the Director of Finance to transfer funds from the 
Compliance Resolution Fund, into which assessments imposed on 
insurers were deposited, to the State’s General Fund. Id. at 
457, 184 P.3d at 772. The circuit court determined that it 
lacked jurisdiction because the lawsuit violated the prohibition 
against declaratory relief actions in tax controversies under 
HRS § 632-1. Id. at 458, 184 P.3d at 773. The ICA determined 
that the transfer of funds operated as a tax, but rejected the 
argument that the matter was a prohibited “controversy with 
respect to taxes” under HRS § 632-1. Id. at 463, 184 P.3d at 
778. The ICA noted that HRS § 632-1 was amended in 1972 to mirror the tax exclusion in the federal Declaratory Judgment Act, which “prohibits declaratory relief in tax matters to 
permit the government to assess and collect taxes alleged to be 
due it without judicial interference.” Id. 
The ICA determined that the Insurers Council was not 
attempting to keep the State from assessing and collecting 
taxes, but rather challenging the transfer of proceeds on the 
ground that they were unconstitutional taxes. Id. Because the 
22 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
constitutional challenge did not interfere with the government’s 
assessment or collection of taxes, the ICA concluded that the 
case was not a “controversy with respect to taxes” within the 
meaning of HRS § 632-1 or HRCP Rule 57. Id. 
As previously indicated, HRS § 632–1 was amended in 
1972 to mirror the tax exception in the federal Declaratory 
Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201. 1972 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 89, § 1 at 338. We therefore turn to federal case law interpreting 
the Declaratory Judgment Act’s tax exception. 
In Cohen v. United States, 650 F.3d 717, 719 (D.C. 
Cir. 2011), appellants argued that the refund procedure created 
by the Internal Revenue Service for taxpayers to recoup money 
from an illegal tax on phone calls was unlawful. The Court of 
Appeals for the District of Colombia rejected a broad 
interpretation of the Declaratory Judgment Act’s tax exclusion, 
which would have precluded all suits “conceivably ‘with respect 
to Federal taxes.’” Id. at 730. The court looked to the 
legislative history of the Declaratory Judgment Act, which 
stated that “the orderly and prompt determination and collection 
of Federal taxes should not be interfered with.” Id. (quoting 
S. Rep. No. 74-1240, at 11 (1935)). The court also considered 
precedent stating that the interpretation of the Declaratory 
Judgment and Anti-Injunction Acts was coextensive, and 
ultimately determined that “‘with respect to Federal taxes’ 
23 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
means ‘with respect to the assessment or collection of taxes.’” 
Id. at 727 (citing E. Kentucky Welfare Rights Org. v. Simon, 506 
F.2d 1278, 1284 (D.C. Cir. 1974); Ecclesiastical Order of the 
ISM of AM, Inc. v. I.R.S., 725 F.2d 398, 404-05 (6th Cir. 1984); 
In re Leckie Smokeless Coal Co., 99 F.3d 573, 583-84 (4th Cir. 
1996); Perlowin v. Sassi, 711 F.2d 910, 911 (9th Cir. 1983); 
McCabe v. Alexander, 526 F.2d 963 (5th Cir. 1976); Tomlinson v. Smith, 128 F.2d 808, 811 (7th Cir. 1942)). Since the suit did 
not affect the assessment or collection of the tax, the 
Declaratory Judgment Act did not limit the court’s jurisdiction. 
Id. at 736; see also Direct Marketing Ass’n v. Brohl, 135 S. Ct. 
1124 (2015) (constitutional challenge to statutory reporting 
requirements preceding the assessment and collection of taxes 
was not barred). 
We are persuaded by the D.C. Circuit Court’s 
interpretation of the federal Declaratory Judgment Act, and the 
reasoning of the ICA. Accordingly, we adopt the ICA’s holding in Hawaii Insurers Council that declaratory relief may be 
obtained in tax matters under HRS § 632-1 where such relief does 
not interfere with the assessment or collection of taxes. 
Declaratory relief may be obtained here because Tax 
Foundation’s claim does not interfere with the government’s 
ability to assess or collect either the general excise and use 
tax, or the Honolulu County surcharge. A ruling in Tax 
24 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Foundation’s favor would not impact DOTAX’s ability to assess or 
collect these taxes because Tax Foundation does not dispute its 
liability to pay general excise and use tax, or the Honolulu 
County surcharge. Tax Foundation contests only the 
“administration and allocation” of the Honolulu County surcharge 
after it is assessed and collected. 
Accordingly, this is not a “controversy with respect 
to taxes” and the exclusionary provision does not apply because only suits that would restrain the assessment and collection of 
taxes fall within the scope of HRS § 632-1. The circuit court 
therefore had jurisdiction and erred in dismissing on that 
basis.

PART TWO: TAX FOUNDATION HAS HRS § 632-1 STANDING 
(By: McKenna, J., with whom Pollack and Wilson, JJ., join) 
C. Standing 
1. I
ntroduction 
In ge
neral, standing is a prudential concern regarding 
whether the party seeking a forum has alleged a sufficient 
personal stake in the outcome of a controversy as to justify the exercise of the court’s remedial powers on the party’s behalf. See Life of the Land v. Land Use Comm’n (“Life of the Land II”), 
63 Haw. 166, 172, 623 P.2d 431, 438 (1981) (citation omitted). 
In Hawaiʻi state courts, standing is a prudential consideration 
re
garding the “proper – and properly limited – role of courts in 
a democratic society” and is not an issue of subject matter 
jurisdiction, as it is in federal courts. Importantly, this 
court has repeatedly ruled that standing requirements may be 
tempered, or even prescribed, by legislative declarations of pol
icy.17 Therefore, standing requirements can differ based on 
legislative enactments. 
HRS Chapter 632 is an example of a statutory scheme in 
w
hich standing requirements have been prescribed by legislative 
declarations. See Life of the Land II, 63 Haw. at 172 & n.5, 
26 17 See Life of the Land II, 63 Haw. at 172, 623 P.2d at 438; see also, 
e.g., Asato v. Procurement Policy Bd., 132 Hawaiʻi 333, 364, 322 P.3d 228, 259 
(2014); Sierra Club v. Dep’t of Transp. (“Superferry I”), 115 Hawai ʻi 299,
321, 167 P.3d 292, 314 (2007); Citizens for Protection of North Kohala
Coastline v. Cnty. of Hawaiʻi, 91 Hawai ʻi 94, 100, 979 P.2d 1120, 1126 (1999). 18 See Corboy v. Louie, 128 Hawaiʻi 89, 104, 283 P.3d 695, 710 (2011),
which is cited to in the Chief Justice’s Dissenting Opinion. Dissenting 
Opinion by Recktenwald, C.J. (“Dissent”). Corboy involved a request for
refund under HRS §§ 40-35(b) and 232-3 of taxes paid under protest; although
the plaintiff also sought declaratory relief regarding the bases for
requesting a refund, see Corboy, 128 Hawaiʻi at 94, 283 P.3d at 700, HRS § 
632-1 was not discussed in the opinion. The Dissent characterizes the 
“injury in fact” test as the “traditional injury in fact” analysis, also
citing Superferry I, 115 Hawaiʻi at 319, 167 P.3d at 312. Superferry I arose 
out of the Hawai ʻi Environmental Policy Act, HRS Chapter 343, and did not
involve HRS § 632-1. See Superferry I, 115 Hawai ʻi at 304, 167 P.3d at 297. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI R EPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
623 P.2d at 438 & n.5. Through language in HRS Chapter 632, the 
Hawaiʻi State Legislature has stated its views regarding when a 
par
ty should be able to bring declaratory relief claims under 
that Chapter. Despite this, some of our recent opinions have 
required a party requesting declaratory relief under HRS § 632-1 
to also satisfy the common law three-part “injury in fact” test 
for standing, which requires a showing that (1) the plaintiff 
has suffered an actual or threatened injury as a result of the 
defendant’s conduct, (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the 
defendant’s actions, and (3) a favorable decision would likely 
provide relief for t he plaintiff’s injury.18 Requiring 
satisfaction of this test, which was originally developed in 
federal courts due to subject matter jurisdiction concerns, 
limits declaratory relief otherwise available under the language 
of Chapter 632, thereby contravening prudential considerations 
of the “proper – and properly limited – role of courts” as 
“prescribed” by the Hawaiʻi State Legislature. 
27 19 The Dissent concludes that Tax Foundation has “taxpayer standing.” See 
infra notes 35 & 39. Justice Nakayama agrees with the Chief Justice that HRS
§ 632-1 does not set out a test for standing, but she would not address
taxpayer standing based on Mottl v. Miyahira, 95 Hawaiʻi 381, 23 P.3d 716 
(2001), and Corboy, 128 Hawai ʻi 89, 283 P.3d 695, in which we did not consider
general taxpayer standing when that basis for standing had not been expresslyargued. See Mottl, 95 Hawai ʻi at 391 n.13, 23 P.3d at 726 n.13; Corboy, 128 
Hawaiʻi at 106 n.32, 283 P.3d at 712 n.32. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI R
 EPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Based on these considerations as well as the reasons 
discussed below, we hold that a party seeking declaratory relief 
under HRS § 632-1 need not satisfy the three-part “injury in 
fact” test to have standing. Rather, consistent with standing 
requirements prescribed by the legislature through the language 
of HRS § 632-1, we hold that a party has standing to seek 
declaratory relief in a civil case brought pursuant to HRS § 632-1(b) (2016): (1) where antagonistic claims exist between the 
parties (a) that indicate imminent and inevitable litigation, or 
(b) where the party seeking declaratory relief has a concrete 
interest in a legal relation, status, right, or privilege that 
is challenged or denied by the other party, who has or asserts a 
concrete interest in the same legal relation, status, right, or 
privilege; and (2) a declaratory judgment will serve to 
terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the 
proceeding. Applying this standard, Tax Foundation has standing 
to seek declaratory relief under HRS § 632-1. We therefore need not address whether Tax Foundation has “taxpayer standing.”
 19
28 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
2. Background 
In this case, Tax Foundation, as a putative class 
representative, requested a declaratory judgment pursuant to HRS 
§ 632-1 (1993), as well as other ancillary relief. The circuit 
court dismissed Tax Foundation’s complaint due to an alleged 
lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on the language in HRS 
§ 632-1 that declaratory judgments are not available for “any 
controversy with respect to taxes.” The State of Hawaiʻi 
(
“State”) had alternatively requested dismissal based on Tax 
Foundation’s alleged lack of standing, but the circuit court did 
not address standing due to its dismissal based on subject 
matter jurisdiction grounds. 
In 
its Answering Brief, the State reasserts Tax 
Foundation’s alleged lack of standing as an alternative basis on 
which this court should affirm the circuit court’s dismissal of 
Tax Foundation’s lawsuit. The State argues that because Tax 
Foundation seeks to have the State pay the City and County of 
Honolulu (“City”) the portion of the ten percent deduction from 
the City’s 0.5% general excise tax surcharge (“Surcharge”) that 
exceeds costs of administration, only the City can meet the 
three-part “injury in fact” test for standing.20 
(
continued . . .) 
29 20 The State cites to Sierra Club v. Hawai ʻi Tourism Authority, 100 Hawai ʻi 
242, 59 P.3d 877 (2002) (plurality opinion), to assert that Tax Foundation
must meet the three-part “injury in fact” test for standing. Sierra Club was *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In its Reply Brief, Tax Foundation argues it has 
standing to request declaratory relief. It did not specifically 
assert “taxpayer standing,” but it alleges that “[g]overnments 
do not pay taxes; taxpayers do[,]” and that as a taxpayer, it is 
continuously injured by the State’s diversion of money away from 
the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation (“HART”) 
project, “which causes over-collection of the amounts needed to sustain HART.” It contends that a favorable decision would 
provide more support to HART for the benefit of the City to the 
relief of affected taxpayers, including itself, and that the 
(. . . continued)
n
ot an HRS § 632-1 lawsuit, but instead involved a request for declaratory
relief under HRS § 201B-15 (Supp. 2000), which then provided in relevant 
part: 
[
A]ny action or proceeding to which the authority,
the State, or the county may be party, in which anyquestion arises as to the validity of this chapter or anyportion of this chapter , or any action of the authority may 
be filed. . . . 
This language differs significantly from HRS § 632-1, which is quoted anddiscussed more extensively below. 
The State also cites to Akinaka v. Disciplinary Board of the Hawaiʻi 
Supreme Court, 91 Hawaiʻi 51, 979 P.2d 1077 (1999) (per curiam), for the
additional proposition that “one does not have standing to assert a violation
of rights belonging to another, since the person entitled to a right is the
only one who can be directly injured by its deprivation.” 91 Hawai ʻi at 58, 
979 P.2d at 1084 (citation omitted). Akinaka is inapposite, as it dealt with
an opposing party seeking to compel attorney disciplinary proceedings. See 
91 Hawai ʻi at 53, 979 P.2d at 1079. We held that the complainant lacked
standing because he had “no recognizable interest in the outcome of the . . .investigation” and was therefore not injured. 91 Hawai ʻi at 58, 979 P.2d at 
1085. 
30            
        
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
more the State diverts, the less the City receives, and the 
longer the Surcharge is needed, the more taxpayers must pay. 
3. Discussion 
a. The Nature of Standing Requirements in Hawai ʻi 
State Courts 
Before discussing standing requirements for purposes 
of HRS § 632-1, it is important to clarify that, in Hawaiʻi state 
c
ourts, the issue of standing is a prudential concern and not an 
issue of subject matter jurisdiction, as suggested by some of 
our cases. For example, in Kēahole Defense Coalition, Inc. v. 
Board of Land & Natural Resources (“Kēahole”), 110 Hawaiʻi 419, 
134 P.3d 585 (2006), we stated that “standing is a 
jurisdictional issue that may be addressed at any stage of a 
case.” Kēahole, 110 Hawaiʻi at 427, 134 P.3d at 593 (citation 
and footnote omitted). In Akinaka, we also stated that this 
court has a duty to address standing sua sponte, even if it is 
not raised by the parties. See Akinaka, 91 Hawaiʻi at 55, 979 
P.2d at 1081. 
In federal courts, standing does implicate subject 
matter jurisdiction. The three-part “injury in fact” test is 
based on the “cases and controversies” limitation on federal 
court jurisdiction under Article III, section 2 of the United 
States Constitution. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 
U.S. 555, 560 (1992) ( “Though some of its elements express 
31 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
merely prudential considerations that are part of judicial self-
government, the core component of standing is an essential and 
unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement 
of Article III.” (citation omitted)). Thus, in federal courts, 
although standing secondarily implicates prudential concerns, 
standing is fundamentally an issue of subject matter 
jurisdiction. In other words, in federal courts, where a plaintiff lacks standing, no “case or controversy” exists to 
confer subject matter jurisdiction. 
Hawaiʻi state courts, on the other hand, are not 
s 
ubject to a “case or controversy” jurisdictional limitation. 
Rather, pursuant to Article VI, Section 1 of the Constitution of 
the State of Hawaiʻi, “[t]he several courts . . . have original 
and appellate jurisdiction as provided by law . . . .” In 
Hawaiʻi courts, standing is solely an issue of justiciability, 
arising out of prudential concerns of judicial self-governance. 
See Life of the Land II, 63 Haw. at 171-72, 623 P.2d at 438. As 
explained by Justice Nakamura in Trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. Yamasaki, 69 Haw. 154, 737 P.2d 446 (1987): 
Unlike the federal judiciary, the courts of Hawaii
are not subject to a cases or controversies limitation like
that imposed by Article III, § 2 of the United States
Constitution. But like the federal government, ours is onein which the sovereign power is divided and allocated amongthree co-equal branches. Thus, we have taken the teachingsof the Supreme Court to heart and adhered to the doctrinethat the use of judicial power to resolve public disputes
in a system of government where there is a separation of
powers should be limited to those questions capable of
judicial resolution and presented in an adversary context. 
32 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
And, we have admonished our judges that even in the absence
of constitutional restrictions, they must still carefullyweigh the wisdom, efficacy, and timeliness of an exerciseof their power before acting, especially where there may bean intrusion into areas committed to other branches of government. 
Our guideposts for the application of the rules of
ju
dicial self-governance founded in concern about the
proper — and properly limited — role of courts in ademocratic society reflect the precepts enunciated by the
Supreme Court. When confronted with an abstract or 
hypothetical question, we have addressed the problem in
terms of a prohibition against rendering advisory opinions;
when asked to decide whether a litigant is asserting
legally recognized interests, personal and peculiar to him,
we have spoken of standing; when a later decision appearedmore appropriate, we have resolved the justiciabilityquestion in terms of ripeness; and when the continuedvitality of the suit was questionable, we have invoked themootness bar. 
We ha
ve also followed the teachings of the Supreme
Court where political questions” are concerned. . . . 
Yamasaki, 69 Haw. at 170-72, 737 P.2d at 455-56 (internal 
citations, quotation marks, punctuation, and footnotes omitted)
(emphases added).  
Thus, Yamasaki recognizes that standing is a 
prudential concern in Hawai ʻi state courts, which are not subject 
to the case and controversy subject matter jurisdiction 
limitation of federal courts. Yamasaki also noted that standing 
is a prudential concern “founded in concern about the proper – 
and properly limited – role of courts in a democratic society.” 
69 Haw. at 171, 737 P.2d at 456 (citation omitted). Furthermore, 
our previous pronouncements that “standing principles are 
governed by ‘prudential rules’ of judicial self-governance,” and 
that “the touchstone of this court’s notion of standing is ‘the 
33 21 Furthermore, if lack of standing was an issue of subject matter
jurisdiction, it could not be waived, and a case in which a plaintiff lacks
standing would have to be dismissed. Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure 
(“HRCP”) Rule 12(h)(3) (2000) provides that “[w]henever it appears by
suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of
the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.” See also Chun v. 
Emps.’ Ret. Sys., 73 Haw. 9, 14, 828 P.2d 260, 263 (1992), reconsiderationdenied, 73 Haw. 625, 829 P.2d 859 (1992) (“[L]ack of subject matterjurisdiction can never be waived by any party at any time.” (citationomitted)). We have noted, however, that a claim of lack of standing can be 
waived. See Ito v. Inv’rs Equity Life Holding Co., 135 Hawai ʻi 49, 59 n.24,
346 P.3d 118, 128 n.24 (2015) (“In its Reply Brief . . . IELHC again claims
that HLDIGA does not have standing . . . . However, this argument was waived
on appeal because IELHC did not raise it in its opening brief.” (citation
omitted)); see also In re Tax Appeal of Univ. of Hawaiʻi v. City & Cty. of 
Honolulu (“In re Univ. of Hawai ʻi”), 102 Hawai ʻi 440, 445 n.13, 77 P.3d 478,
483 n.13 (2003) (“We do not address the issue of whether the University has
standing to appeal pursuant to a specific statute, inasmuch as the University
did not raise this issue on appeal.” (citation omitted)). Both Ito and In re 
Univ. of Hawai ʻi cited to Hawai ʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure (“HRAP”) Rule
28(b)(7) in support of this point, which provides that “[p]oints not argued
may be deemed waived.” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI R
 EPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
needs of justice[,]’” see, e.g., Mottl, 95 Hawaiʻi at 389-90, 23 
P.3d 
at 724-25, reflect our awareness that standing is a 
prudential issue and not an issue of subject matter 
jurisdiction, as “the needs of justice” cannot eliminate the 
requirement of subject matter jurisdiction. In addition, as 
pointed out earlier, in Hawaiʻi state courts, standing 
requirements may be tempered, or even prescribed, by legislative 
declarations of policy. See Life of the Land II, 63 Haw. at 
172, 623 P.2d at 438. 21 
Courts of other states also recognize that standing is 
a prudential concern and not an issue of subject matter 
jurisdiction. See, e.g., Weatherford v. City of San Rafael, 395

state Constitution has no case or controversy requirement

omitted)); Deutsche Bank Nat’l Trust Co. v. Johnston, 369 P.3d 1046, 1052 (N.M. 2016) (“[W]hile a plaintiff’s . . . lack of 
prudential standing [is] not strictly jurisdictional, [it] 
implicate[s] the ‘properly limited . . . role of courts in a 
democratic society’ and [is a] relevant concern[] throughout a 
litigation.” (citation omitted)); Biggs v. Cooper ex rel. Cty. 
of Maricopa, 341 P.3d 457, 460 (Ariz. 2014) (“In Arizona, 
standing is a prudential consideration rather than a

(“[I]n Pennsylvania, the issue of standing implicates prudential 
concerns.” (citation omitted)). 
Therefore, we preliminarily clarify that, in Hawai ʻi 
state courts, standing is not an issue of subject matter 
35 22 It appears the line of cases erroneously suggesting that standing is a
matter of subject matter jurisdiction started with State v. Kam, 69 Haw. 483,
488, 748 P.2d 372, 375-76 (1988) (“Although the question of standing ‘was not
raised by the parties, appellate courts are under an obligation to insure
that they have jurisdiction to hear and determine each case.’” (citation
omitted)). Subsequent cases include Akinaka, 91 Hawaiʻi at 5 5, 979 P.2d at 
1081;  Kēahole,   110  Hawaiʻi at 427-28, 134 P.3d at 593-94; Hui Kako ʻo Aina 
Hoʻopulapula v. Board of Land & Natural Resources, 112 Hawai ʻi 28, 59, 143 
P.3d 1230, 1261 (2006); and McDermott v. Ige, 135 Hawai ʻi 275, 283, 349 P.3d 
382, 390 (2015). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REP ORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
jurisdiction,22 but arises solely out of justiciability concerns 
based on prudential concerns of judicial self-governance, and is 
based on “concern about the proper – and properly limited – role 
of courts in a democratic society.” Accordingly, although 
Hawaiʻi state courts may consider standing even when not raised 
by the parties, they are not required to do so sua sponte, as 
they would be required to do if they perceive issues of subject 
matter jurisdiction. 
In this case, however, the State expressly alleged 
lack of standing as an alternative basis for its dismissal 
motion. We therefore address standing in our de novo review of 
the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment. 
The conflation of the subject matter jurisdiction and justiciability
implications of standing may have arisen due to language in our precedent
stating that it would not be proper to “invoke a court’s jurisdiction” where
a plaintiff lacks standing. See, e.g., Mottl, 95 Hawaiʻi at 389, 23 P.3d at 
724 (“It is well settled that the crucial inquiry with regard to standing is
whether the plaintiff has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the
controversy as to warrant his or her invocation of the court’s jurisdiction
and to justify exercise of the court’s remedial powers on his or her behalf.”
(quoting Akinaka, 91 Hawai ʻi at 55, 979 P.2d at 1081 )).

b. Declaratory Judgments under HRS Chapter 632 
Tax Foundation premises its request for declaratory 
relief on HRS § 632-1, which is part of HRS Chapter 632 
governing “Declaratory Judgments.” The Chapter has four 
sections, HRS § 632-1 relating to “[j]urisdiction; controversies 
subject to,” HRS § 632-2 (2016) relating to “[a]ppeals,” HRS § 
632-3 (2016) relating to “[f]urther relief upon judgment,” and HRS § 632-6 (2016) relating to “[p]rovisions, remedial.” HRS § 
632-1 provides as follows: 
Jurisdiction; controversies subject to. (a) In cases of 
actual controversy, courts of record, within the scope of
their respective jurisdictions, shall have power to make
binding adjudications of right, whether or not
consequential relief is, or at the time could be, claimed,
and no action or proceeding shall be open to objection on
the ground that a judgment or order merely declaratory ofright is prayed for; provided that declaratory relief maynot be obtained in any district court, or in anycontroversy with respect to taxes, or in any case where adivorce or annulment of marriage is sought. Controversies 
involving the interpretation of deeds, wills, other
instruments of writing, statutes, municipal ordinances, and
other governmental regulations may be so determined, and
this enumeration does not exclude other instances of actual antagonistic assertion and denial of right. 
(b) Relief by declaratory judgment may be granted in civil
cases where an actual controversy exists between contending
parties, or where the court is satisfied that antagonistic
claims are present between the parties involved which
indicate imminent and inevitable litigation, or where in
any such case the court is satisfied that a party asserts alegal relation, status, right, or privilege in which theparty has a concrete interest and that there is a challengeor denial of the asserted relation, status, right, orprivilege by an adversary party who also has or asserts a
concrete interest therein, and the court is satisfied also
that a declaratory judgment will serve to terminate the
uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the
proceeding. Where, however, a statute provides a special
form of remedy for a specific type of case, that statutory
remedy shall be followed; but the mere fact that an actualor threatened controversy is susceptible of relief througha general common law remedy, a remedy equitable in nature, 
37 23 The Dissent opines that HRS § 632-1, which is entitled “Jurisdiction;
controversies subject to” does not set out standing requirements but is
merely a jurisdictional statute. Yet, the Dissent acknowledges we havestated that HRS Chapter 632 is an instance in which standing requirementshave been “tempered, or even prescribed, by legislative declarations ofpolicy[,]” citing Life of the Land II, 63 Haw. at 172 & n.5, 623 P.2d at 438& n.5. It is difficult to understand how the legislature “tempered, or even
prescribed” standing requirements in Chapter 632, if Chapter 632 does not
actually contain standing criteria or requirements. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
or an extraordinary legal remedy, whether such remedy is
recognized or regulated by statute or not, shall not debara party from the privilege of obtaining a declaratoryjudgment in any case where the other essentials to suchrelief are present. 
When construing a statute, our foremost obligation is 
to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the language 
contained in the statute itself, and we must read statutory 
language in the context of the entire statute and construe it in 
a manner consistent with its purpose. See In re Doe, 95 Hawaiʻi 
183, 191, 20 P.3d 616, 624 (2001) (citation omitted). 
HRS § 632-1 is somewhat verbose, but can be broken 
down as follows. The title of HRS § 632-1 is “Jurisdiction; 
controversies subject to.”23 In general, subsection (a) discusses 
subject matter jurisdiction. It starts by providing that, in cases of actual controversy, courts of record have power to make 
binding adjudications of right whether or not consequential 
relief is, or at the time could be, claimed. It also provides 
that a declaratory relief action cannot be objected to on the 
grounds that declaratory relief is the only relief sought; in 
38 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
other words, other remedies, such as damages or injunctive 
relief, need not also be sought. Subsection (a) further 
provides that the district courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction over declaratory relief claims and that other 
courts of record cannot grant declaratory relief in any controversy with respect to taxes or in a case seeking divorce 
or annulment. The subsection clarifies, however, that declaratory relief can be sought in controversies involving the 
interpretation of deeds, wills, other instruments of writing, 25 24
24 As noted in Justice Acoba’s dissenting opinion in County of Hawaiʻi v. 
Ala Loop Homeowners, 123 Hawaiʻi 391, 235 P.3d 1103 (2010): 
[
S]ince its enactment in 1921, HRS § 632–1 has undergone 
several amendments. In 1945, a pertinent amendment was 
made to HRS § 632–1 with the intent “to expand the
proceedings for declaratory judgments to a scope that will
render such proceedings of real value[.]” S. Stand. Comm. 
Rep. No. 235, in 1945 Senate Journal, at 656. Furthermore, 
the House Committee on the Judiciary noted that the
amendment would “afford greater relief by declaratory
judgment than the present law.” H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 
76, in 1945 House Journal, at 566. This court has recently
determined that, by this amendment, the legislature
“intended to ‘afford [citizens] greater relief,’” and,
therefore, a petitioner was not precluded “from bringing a
declaratory judgment action under the current HRS § 632–1 , 
even though [relief through another right of action was]
available provided that ‘the other essentials to such
relief [were] present.’ ” Dejetley v. Kahoʻohalahala, 122 
Hawaiʻi 251, 268, 226 P.3d 421, 438 (2010) (quoting HRS
§ 632–1). 
123 Hawaiʻi at 434, 235 P.3d at 1146 (Acoba, J., dissenting). 
25 In 1921, when Hawai ʻi’s declaratory judgment act was enacted, district
courts were not courts of record. Effective January 1, 1972, Act 188, 1970 
Hawaii Sess. Laws 443, established district courts as courts of record and 
redesignated district magistrates as district judges. See State v. Okuda, 71 
Haw. 434, 438 n.6, 795 P.2d 1, 4 n.6 (1990) (per curiam). 
39 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
statutes, municipal ordinances, or other governmental 
regulations. It further states that this list is not 
exhaustive, and that declaratory relief can also be sought in 
other situations involving other antagonistic assertions or 
denials of rights. 
Subsection (b) of the statute more specifically addresses 
“
controversies subject to” declaratory relief. It states that 
relief by declaratory judgment may be granted in civil cases
where (1) there is an actual controversy between contending 
parties; or (2) (a) antagonistic claims exist between the 
parties (i) that indicate imminent and inevitable litigation, or 
(ii) where the party seeking declaratory relief has a concrete 
interest in a legal relation, status, right, or privilege that 27 26
26 Our discussion does not include the repeated phrase that “the court is
satisfied.” Interestingly, there are numerous federal cases relating a
“court is satisfied” with standing or standing requirements. See, e.g.,Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S.Ct. 1540, 1550 (2016) (“The [Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals] thus concluded that Robins’ ‘alleged violations of his
statutory rights were sufficient to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of
Article III.’” (internal brackets and citation omitted)); Walker v. Lamb,
Case No. 4:18-cv-04094, 2019 WL 542328, at *7 (W.D. Ark. Feb. 11, 2019)(“[T]he Court is satisfied that Plaintiff has standing to bring the presentlawsuit.”); Am. Fed’n of State, Cty. & Mun. Emps. (AFSCME) Council 79 v.Scott, 278 F.R.D. 664, 668–69 (S.D. Fla. 2011) (“The Court is satisfied thatthe Union has demonstrated an injury in fact. . . . [T]he Court is satisfied
that the Union satisfies the last two standing prongs.”); White v. Engler,
188 F. Supp. 2d 730, 743 (E.D. Mich. 2001) (“The Court is satisfied that
Plaintiffs have standing to pursue such action. The Court is also satisfied 
that the NAACCP has standing to pursue this action on behalf of its
members.”). 
27 Declaratory relief ordinarily cannot be utilized to enjoin the
enforcement of a valid criminal statute, but may be available where a
criminal statute affects a continuing course of conduct but is not subject tochallenge in a criminal court because the government refuses to bring
criminal proceedings. See Pacific Meat Co. v. Otagaki, 47 Haw. 652, 656, 394
P.2d 618, 620-21 (1964). 
40 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
is challenged or denied by the other party, who has or asserts a 
concrete interest in the same legal relation, status, right, or 
privilege; and (b) a declaratory judgment will serve to 
terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the 
proceeding.28 
As indicated in the paragraph above, the plain 
language of HRS § 632-1(b) seemingly allows for declaratory relief where there is an “actual controversy between contending 
parties” or “antagonistic claims” are present between contending 
parties (along with other requirements). We discuss the first 
“or” in HRS § 632-1(b) in more detail in Section IV.C.3.d below. 
In any event, subsection (b) of HRS § 632-1 further 
provides that where another statute provides a special form of 
remedy for a specific type of case, that statutory remedy must 
be followed. The subsection also clarifies, however, that if 
the other requirements for declaratory relief delineated in the 
statute are met, a party will not be prohibited from obtaining a 
declaratory judgment even if the actual or threatened 
controversy is susceptible of relief through a general common 
41 28 The Dissent opines that because HRS § 632-1 does not use language such
as “an aggrieved party,” “any interested person,” or “any person” in
describing who can bring a declaratory judgment action, it does not set out
standing requirements. The language of subsection (b), however, clearly lays
out when “parties” can bring a request for declaratory relief. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
law remedy, an equitable remedy, or an extraordinary legal 
remedy, whether or not such a remedy is recognized by statute. 
HRS § 632–6 then provides: 
This chapter is declared to be remedial. Its purpose is to
afford relief from the uncertainty and insecurity attendantupon controversies over legal rights, without requiring oneof the parties interested so to invade the rights asserted
by the other as to entitle the party to maintain an
ordinary action therefor. It is to be liberally
interpreted and administered, with a view to making the
courts more serviceable to the people. 
(Emphasis added.) 
Thus, nothing in the language of HRS § 632-1, the 
statement of legislative intent in HRS § 632-6, nor any other 
provision in HRS Chapter 632 requires a party to satisfy a 
three-part “injury in fact” test in order to seek declaratory 
relief. 
c. Our Precedent Regarding Standing under
HRS § 632-1 
Recently, in Asato v. Procurement Policy Board, 132 
Hawaiʻi 333, 322 P.3d 228 (2014), we clarified the confusion in 
our case law regarding whether the three-part “injury in fact” test applies to declaratory judgment lawsuits brought pursuant 
to HRS § 91-7 under which “any interested person” may seek 
declaratory relief regarding the validity of administrative 
rules.
29 Analyzing the somewhat confusing pronouncements of our 
(
continued . . .) 
42 29 HRS § 91-7 (2012 & Supp. 2014) provides in pertinent part: *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
prior case law on the issue, we held that a person seeking a 
judicial declaration under HRS § 91-7 need not satisfy the 
three-part “injury in fact” test to qualify as an “interested 
person” with standing under that statute. See Asato, 132 Hawaiʻi 
a
t 342-46, 322 P.3d at 237-41. The Asato majority noted that in 
Life of the Land II, this court held that plaintiffs whose 
interests “may have been adversely affected” had standing to 
request declaratory relief under HRS § 91-7. Asato, 132 Hawaiʻi 
at 342, 322 P.3d at 237 (citing Life of the Land II, 63 Haw. at 
177-78, 623 P.2d at 441). We also noted that in Richard v. 
Metcalf, 82 Hawaiʻi 249, 921 P.2d 169 (1996), however, this court 
appeared to have adopted a more stringent standing standard, 
requiring that the plaintiff demonstrate an “injury in fact” to 
have standing under HRS § 91-7. See Asato, 132 Hawaiʻi at 342, 
322 P.3d at 237 (citing Richard, 82 Hawaiʻi at 253-54, 921 P.2d 
at 173-74). We stated: 
(. . . continued)
Declaratory judgment on validity of rules. ( a) Any
interested person may obtain a judicial declaration as to
the validity of an agency rule as provided in subsection
(b) by bringing an action against the agency in the circuit
court or, if applicable, the environmental court, of the
county in which the petitioner resides or has its principalplace of business. The action may be maintained whether ornot the petitioner has first requested the agency to passupon the validity of the rule in question. 
Th
e original 1961 version of the statute was in effect at the time of Asato;
in 2014, the legislature added “or, if applicable, the environmental court.”2014 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 218, § 3 at 739. 
43 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
However, it is not clear how Richard reached this
c
onclusion. Richard states that it was relying on Bush [v.
Watson, 81 Hawai ʻi 474, 479, 918 P.2d 1130, 1135 (1996),
r
econsideration denied, 82 Hawai ʻi 156, 920 P.2d 370
(1996)], which, according to Richard, “applied the ‘injuryin fact’ test to determine the standing of a party who hadfiled a declaratory judgment action under HRS § 91–7.”
Richard, 82 Hawai ʻi at 253, 921 P.2d at 173. However, Bush
does not mention either HRS § 91–7 or “[a]ny interested
person”, or provide any analysis on why the injury in fact
test should apply to “[a]ny interested person[s].” See 
Bush, 81 Hawai ʻi at 479, 918 P.2d at 1135. 
Id. We opined that “in the absence of supportive reasoning, it 
is difficult to accord governing impact to this aspect of 
Richard, particularly where the plain language of HRS § 91-7 and 
the legislative history of that statute require a different 
result that is in accord with Life of the Land [II].” Asato, 
132 Hawaiʻi at 343, 322 P.3d at 238 (footnote omitted). 
The Asato majority also addressed the dissent’s 
statement that it had “been well settled that a plaintiff must 
satisfy the three-part ‘injury in fact’ test in order to have 
standing under HRS § 91-7,” Asato, 132 Hawaiʻi at 362, 322 P.3d 
at 257 (Recktenwald, C.J., dissenting, in which Nakayama, J., 
joined), by noting Richard had not proffered reasoning as to why 
an “interested person” must meet the “injury in fact” test, 
despite the fact that it was the first case to adopt that 
requirement. Asato, 132 Hawaiʻi at 346, 322 P.3d at 241 (citing 
Richard, 82 Hawaiʻi at 253–54, 921 P.2d at 173–74). The majority 
noted that “Richard may have erroneously assumed that the issue 
had already been resolved in Bush.” Id. (citing Richard, 82 
44 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Hawaiʻi at 253, 921 P.2d at 173). We noted that although the 
doctrine of stare decisis must not be treated lightly, we were 
“address[ing] an issue that was not well-supported or well-
settled.” Asato, 132 Hawaiʻi at 346, 322 P.3d at 241. We also 
noted that “[s]tanding is a prudential doctrine, and where no 
prudential reasons have ever been set forth in support of a 
particular standing requirement, review of that requirement is 
warranted, as we do so here.” Asato, 132 Hawaiʻi at 346, 322 
P.3d at 241 (citing Citizens, 91 Hawaiʻi at 100, 979 P.2d at 
1126) (emphasis added). 
S
imilar to Asato, which evaluated our precedent 
regarding standing to bring a declaratory relief action under 
HRS § 91-7, as discussed below, our precedent regarding 
requirements for standing under HRS § 632-1 has also been 
confusing and has not been well settled. As further discussed 
below, our cases that have required satisfaction of a three-part 
“injury in fact” test for HRS § 632-1 standing have not 
adequately set forth prudential reasons for doing so. Rather, 
our imposition of a three-part “injury in fact” test to HRS § 
632-1 standing actually contravenes prudential considerations 
regarding the appropriate role of the judiciary within the three 
branches of government, because the three-part test contradicts 
the language of HRS § 632-1 and the legislative mandate of HRS § 
632-6. 
45 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Dalton v. City and County of Honolulu, 51 Haw. 400, 
462 P.2d 199 (1969), appears to be the first reported case in 
which we expressly addressed standing in the context of a case 
requesting a declaratory judgment pursuant to HRS § 632-1. We 
stated: 
The standing necessary to pursue a declaratory
judgment is described in HRS § 632-1: 
Controversies involving the
interpretation of . . . statutes, municipal
ordinances, and other governmental regulations,may be so determined, and this enumeration doesnot exclude other instances of actual antagonistic assertion and denial of right. 
Relief by declaratory judgment . . . may
be granted in all civil cases where an actual
controversy exists between contending parties,
. . . or where in any such case the court is
satisfied that a party asserts a legalrelation, status, right, or privilege in whichhe has a concrete interest . . . . 
Dalton, 51 Haw. at 402-03, 462 P.2d at 202. 
In Dalton, we held that plaintiffs residing in very 
close proximity to a proposed high rise apartment building 
development, which would restrict their scenic view, limit their 
sense of space, and increase population density, clearly had 
standing to bring an HRS § 632-1 declaratory relief action 
because they had a “concrete interest” in a “legal relation” and 
because the case was an “actual controversy,” not merely a 
hypothetical problem. Dalton, 51 Haw. at 403, 462 P.2d at 202. 
46 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
There was no reference in Dalton to a three-part “injury in 
fact” test for standing.30 
Twenty-two years after Dalton, Life of the Land II 
also briefly discussed HRS § 632-1 declaratory relief standing. 
See Life of the Land II, 63 Haw. at 178, 623 P.2d at 442. We 
stated: 
Standing is that aspect of justiciability focusing on
the party seeking a forum rather than on the issues he
wants adjudicated. And the crucial inquiry in itsdetermination is “whether the plaintiff has ‘alleged such apersonal stake in the outcome of the controversy’ as to
warrant his invocation of . . . (the court’s) jurisdiction
and to justify exercise of the court’s remedial powers on
his behalf.” While standing requisites ordinarily comprise
one of the “prudential rules” discussed earlier, they may
also be tempered, or even prescribed, by legislative and
5 constitutional declarations of policy.

an
d Hawaii State Constitution, Article XI, Section 9,
Environmental Rights. . . . 
Life of the Land II, 63 Haw. at 172 & n.5, 623 P.2d at 438 & n.5 
(quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498–99 (1975)). In Life 
of the Land II, we discussed the liberalization of standing 
requirements in federal court environmental cases, in which the 
courts had shifted from the “legal right” to the “injury in 
47 30 The Dissent asserts that since Dalton, this court has consistently
required a party seeking declaratory relief under HRS § 632-1 to establish an
injury or a threatened injury. As noted by the Dissent, however, Dalton didnot use the terms “injury” or “threatened injury.” Rather, Dalton refers to“a ‘concrete interest’ in a ‘legal relation,’” which are the terms
specifically contained within the legislative prescription of HRS § 632-1.

fact” standard to evaluate standing. Life of the Land II, 63 
Haw. at 174, 623 P.2d at 439. We also stated: 31 
While the term “injury in fact” may not appear in their
text, our decisions have afforded standing on a basis atleast coextensive with federal doctrine where harm to such 
interests has been alleged. This is not to suggest our
standing requisites will follow every twist or turn in the
development of federal doctrine. Our touchstone remains 
“the needs of justice.” 
63 Haw. 176, 623 P.2d at 441 (emphasis added) (citation 
omitted). We further stated in footnote 6: 
The Supreme Court’s standing doctrine includes a
requirement that there be a showing of a “logical nexus”
between the interest asserted and the claim sought to beadjudicated. See Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 102 (1968).In Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group,
Inc., 438 U.S. 59 (1978), the Court summarized its doctrine
as follows: 
The essence of the standing inquiry is whether
t
he parties seeking to invoke the court’s
jurisdiction have “alleged such a personal stake in
the outcome of the controversy as to assure thatconcrete adverseness which sharpens the presentationof issues upon which the court so largely depends forillumination of difficult constitutional questions.”
Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962). As refined 
by subsequent reformulation, this requirement of a
“personal stake” has come to be understood to require
not only a “distinct and palpable injury,” to theplaintiff, Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501 (1975),
but also a “fairly traceable” causal connection
between the claimed injury and the challenged
conduct. Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous.
Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 261 (1977). See also Simon 
v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 41-42

requirement of the foregoing nexus was only applicable in

did generally discuss this shift, it did so in the context of discussingUnited States Supreme Court cases discussing standing requirements in federalcourts. See Life of the Land II, 63 Haw. at 172-73, 623 P.2d at 438-39

taxpayers’ suits and “outside the context of . . . (such)
su
its, a litigant must demonstrate . . . (nothing) more
than injury in fact and a substantial likelihood that thejudicial relief requested will prevent or redress theclaimed injury to satisfy the ‘case or controversy’requirement of Art. III.” Id. at 79. 
Life of the Land II, 63 Haw. at 173 n.6, 623 P.2d at 439 n.6. 
Thus, in Life of the Land II, we referred to the term 
“injury in fact” as a concept that loosened, not tightened, 
standing requirements under HRS § 91-7. We also made clear that 
our standing requirements would not necessarily follow federal 
standards, but would instead be based on the “needs of justice.” 
63 Haw. at 176, 623 P.2d at 441. We noted that even under 
federal standing requirements existing at that time, components 
of the three-part “injury in fact” test applied only in 
taxpayers’ suits. 63 Haw. at 173 n.6, 623 P.2d at 439 n.6. In 
any event, Life of the Land II actually analyzed standing under 
HRS § 91-7. With respect to HRS § 632-1 standing, we merely 
stated as follows: 
HRS § 632-1 authorizes courts of record to issue
declaratory judgments “in cases of actual controversy.”
Our brief discourse on the “prudential rules” and their
application to this case has obviated a necessity for
further debate on whether an “actual controversy” exists. 
Life of the Land II, 63 Haw. at 178, 623 P.2d at 442 (footnote 
omitted). As can be seen, in Life of the Land II, we analyzed 
HRS § 632-1 standing based on the “actual controversy” language 
of the statute, and we did not actually apply an “injury in 
fact” requirement to HRS § 632-1. 
49 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Later, in Citizens, we pointed out the difference 
between standing requirements for HRS § 91-14 agency appeals and 
HRS § 632-1 declaratory judgment actions, and stated: 
Citizens first contends that the circuit court erred 
in concluding that it did not establish an injury in fact
nor raise a genuine issue of material fact relating to theexistence of an injury in fact. Likewise, as noted above,Chalon describes the issue of Citizens’ standing in termsof proving an injury in fact sufficient to invoke acontested case hearing. These arguments wholly
misapprehend and blur the distinction between standing to
participate in a contested case hearing under HRS § 91-14
and standing in an action for declaratory relief under
HRS § 632-1 (1993). 
As a general rule, standing is the aspect of
ju
sticiability focusing on the party seeking a forum rather
than on the issues he wants adjudicated. In order for 
individuals or groups legitimately to invoke contested casehearing procedures on SMA permit applications before theState Land Use Commission (LUC), they must be “directly andimmediately affected by the Commission’s decision.” HPC 
Rule 4-2(6)(B). In PASH, we stated that this requires a
party to demonstrate that its interests were injured. The 
demonstration is evaluated via a three-part “injury in
fact” test requiring: “(1) an actual or threatened injury,
which, (2) is traceable to the challenged action, and (3)
is likely to be remedied by favorable judicial action.” 
On the other hand, for the purposes of establishing
s
tanding in an action for declaratory relief, HRS § 632-1
interposes less stringent requirements for access andparticipation in the court process. As this court 
explained in Richard v. Metcalf, 82 Hawai ‘i 249, 254 n.12, 
9 
21 P.2d 169, 174 n.12 (1996), 
Al
though HRS § 632-1 provides for standing to sue “in
cases of actual controversy,” HRS § 632-6 clarifies
that the purpose of HRS chapter 632 is to affordrelief without requiring one of the partiesinterested so to invade the rights asserted by the
other as to entitle the party to maintain an ordinary
action therefor. It is to be liberally interpreted
and administered, with a view to making the courts
more serviceable to the people.

(emphases added). 
50 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In Citizens, we did refer to the plaintiff 
organization’s “injury in fact” in analyzing its standing, 
stating that “although Citizens’ members are neither owners nor 
adjoining owners of the Mahukona project, they nonetheless 
alleged an injury in fact sufficient to constitute standing to 
participate in a declaratory judgment action.” Citizens, 91 
Hawaiʻi at 101, 979 P.2d at 1127. We were clear, however, that 
t
he three-part “injury in fact” test did not govern standing for 
HRS § 632-1 declaratory judgment actions, noting that “injury to 
its members’ quality of life is threatened,” and concluding that 
“Citizens asserts personal and special interests sufficient to 
invoke judicial resolution under HRS § 632-1.” Id. The 
concept of “personal” and “special” interests sufficient for 
standing mentioned in Citizens had actually been developed to 
define what constitutes a “person aggrieved” under HRS § 91-14 
with standing to request judicial review of contested cases 
pursuant to that statute. See, e.g., Life of the Land, Inc. v. 
Land Use Comm’n, 61 Haw. 3, 8, 594 P.2d 1079, 1082 (1979); Life 
of the Land II, 63 Haw. at 176, 623 P.2d at 440-41; Mahuiki v. 
Planning Comm’n, 65 Haw. 506, 515, 654 P.2d 874, 880 (1982); Ka 
Paʻakai O Ka ʻĀina  v.  Land  Use  Comm’n,  94  Hawaiʻi 31, 42-43, 7 
P.3d 1068, 1079-80 (2000). Therefore, it appears that in 32
51 32 Although Citizens used the phrase “injury in fact,” it did not apply
the three-part “injury in fact” test for HRS § 632-1 standing. 33 Specifically: *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI R EPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Citizens, we juxtaposed the “personal and special interests” 
requirement for a “person aggrieved” to have standing under HRS 
§ 91-14 to an HRS § 632-1 declaratory relief action. 
Then, in the 2001 Mottl case, 95 Hawaiʻi 381, 23 P.3d 
71
6, we again acknowledged liberalized standing requirements for 
HRS § 632-1 declaratory judgment actions, but then applied the three-part “injury in fact” test for standing under that 
statute. In Mottl, we addressed whether the University of 
Hawaiʻi Professional Assembly and some of its members had 
standing to bring an HRS § 632-1 declaratory relief lawsuit 
asserting that the State of Hawaiʻi wrongfully reduced the 
University of Hawaii’s allotment of appropriated funds.
 We 
began our standing analysis by stating: 33
It is well settled that the crucial inquiry with
regard to standing is whether the plaintiff has alleged
such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as 
The complaint alleged: (1) a violation of the principle of
separation of powers implicit in the Hawai ʻi Constitution by
reducing, without authority, the budgetary allocation to the
University of Hawai ʻi below the amount legislatively appropriated;
and (2) a violation of HRS ch. 37 by (a) failure to restore tothe University of Hawai ʻi an amount sufficient to pay the faculty
paychecks on June 30, 1998 when the federal injunction precluded
implementation of the payroll lag, (b) causing monies encumbered
in fiscal year 1998 for the purchase of supplies, services, and
other purposes to be diverted to the payment of salaries, and (c)causing the University of Hawaii’s budget in fiscal year 1999 tobe impaired by the cost shifted from the fiscal year 1998. 
Mottl, 95 Hawaiʻi at 385, 23 P.3d at 720. 
52 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to warrant his or her invocation of the court’s 
jurisdiction and to justify exercise of the court’sremedial powers on his or her behalf. In deciding whetherthe plaintiff has the requisite interest in the outcome ofthe litigation, we employ a three-part test: (1) has theplaintiff suffered an actual or threatened injury as a
result of the defendant’s wrongful conduct; (2) is the
injury fairly traceable to the defendant’s actions; and (3)would a favorable decision likely provide relief forplaintiff’s injury. 
. . . . 
On the other hand, for the purposes of establishing
st
anding in an action for declaratory relief, HRS_§ 632–1
interposes less stringent requirements for access and
participation in the court process. As this court 
explained in Richard v. Metcalf, 82 Hawai ʻi 249, 254 n.12, 
92
1 P.2d 169, 174 n.12 (1996), 
alt
hough HRS § 632–1 provides for standing to sue in
cases of actual controversy, HRS § 632–6 (1993)
clarifies that the purpose of HRS chapter 632 is toafford relief without requiring one of the parties
interested so to invade the rights asserted by the
other as to entitle the party to maintain an ordinaryaction therefor. It is to be liberally interpretedand administered, with a view to making the courtsmore serviceable to the people. 
Mottl, 95 Hawaiʻi at 389, 23 P.3d at 724 (some internal quotation 
m
arks, ellipses, footnotes, brackets, and citations omitted) 
(emphases added). 
In Mottl, we applied the three-part “injury in fact” 
test to HRS § 632-1 standing for the first time, and we ruled 
that the plaintiffs did not meet its requirements. See Mottl, 
95 Hawaiʻi at 395, 23 P.3d at 730. After Mottl, a few opinions 
have expressly required plaintiffs to satisfy the three-part 
“injury in fact” test to establish standing in HRS § 632-1 
declaratory judgment lawsuits. See, e.g., Cty. of Kauaʻi ex rel. 
Nakazawa v. Baptiste, 115 Hawaiʻi 15, 26, 165 P.3d 916, 927 
53 34 The Dissent opines that this court should follow the Intermediate Court
of Appeals’ (“ICA[’s]”) opinion in Bremner v. City & County of Honolulu, 96
Hawaiʻi 134, 28 P.3d 350 (App. 2001), in which the ICA applied the three-part
“injury in fact” test to determine HRS § 632-1 standing. Bremner, however, 
cited to Bush, 81 Hawai ʻi at 479, 918 P.2d at 1135, as authority for its
application of the three-part “injury in fact” test to HRS § 632-1 standing.See Bremner, 96 Hawaiʻi at 139, 28 P.3d at 355. Yet Bush was brought under 42 
U.S.C. § 1983, not HRS § 632-1. See Bush, 81 Hawaiʻi at 477-78, 918 P.2d at 
1133-34. Bremner also cited to Mottl as authority for its application of the
three-part “injury in fact” test for HRS § 632-1 standing. See Bremner, 96 
Hawaiʻi at 139, 28 P.3d at 355 . As noted, however, it is unclear why Mottl
applied the three-part “injury in fact” test to HRS § 632-1 standing, and, as
discussed in this opinion, application of the test to declaratory reliefactions under HRS Chapter 632 contravenes prudential considerations when thelegislature has clearly delineated standing requirements under HRS § 632-1.
Therefore, we decline to adopt Bremner, which is inconsistent with the
language and legislative intent of HRS Chapter 632. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

-53. 
As in our adoption of the three-part “injury in fact” 
tes
t in the context of HRS § 91-7 standing, discussed in Asato, 
it is unclear why we adopted the test for HRS § 632-1 standing 
in Mottl. Similar to the confusion in our case law regarding 
standing requirements for HRS § 91-7 that we clarified in Asato, 
our case law regarding standing requirements for HRS § 632-1 
declaratory judgment actions has also been unsettled and 
confusing. We therefore now clarify standing requirements for 
a declaratory judgment lawsuit under HRS § 632-1. 34
d. Sta
nding Requirements under HRS § 632-1(b) 
As discussed in Section IV.C.3.a, standing in Hawai ʻi 
state courts is a prudential doctrine in which our courts are 
directed to “weigh the wisdom, efficacy, and timeliness of an 
54 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
exercise of their power before acting, especially where there 
may be an intrusion into areas committed to other branches of 
government.” Life of the Land II, 63 Hawaiʻi at 172, 623 P.2d at 
438. To reiterate, we have noted that standing requirements may 
be tempered, or even prescribed, by legislative declarations of 
policy. See id. In HRS §§ 632-1 and 632-6, the legislature has 
declared its policy regarding standing, and has expressed its 
view regarding the “proper — and properly limited — role of 
[our] courts[,]” Yamasaki, 69 Haw. at 171, 737 P.2d 456 
(citation omitted), with respect to declaratory judgment actions 
under HRS Chapter 632. 
A
s discussed in Section IV.C.3.b, the language of HRS 
§ 632-1 provides that declaratory relief is available in civil cases (1) where there is an actual controversy between 
contending parties; or (2) (a) where antagonistic claims exist 
between the parties (i) that indicate imminent and inevitable 
litigation, or (ii) where the party seeking declaratory relief 
has a concrete interest in a legal relation, status, right, or 
privilege that is challenged or denied by the other party, who 
has or asserts a concrete interest in the same legal relation, 
status, right, or privilege; and (b) a declaratory judgment will 
serve to terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to 
the proceeding. 
55 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
As further discussed in Section IV.C.3.b, the language 
of HRS § 632-1(b) would seemingly allow for declaratory relief 
in civil cases where there is an “actual controversy” or 
“antagonistic claims” between contending parties. We first 
address the meaning of “actual controversy.” 
As noted in Kaleikau v. Hall, 27 Haw. 420 (Haw. Terr. 
1
923), Hawaiʻi ’s Declaratory Judgment Act, enacted in 1921, was 
c
opied in toto from the declaratory judgment act of Kansas. 
Kaleikau, 27 Haw. at 426. The Kansas Supreme Court first 
addressed its declaratory judgment act in State ex rel. Hopkins 
v. Grove, 201 P. 82 (Kan. 1921). The Kansas Supreme Court noted 
that its statute was explicitly limited in its operation to cases of “actual controversy.” Grove, 201 P. at 83. In 
addressing what constituted an “actual controversy,” the court 
stated: 
Against the validity of the statute it is urged that
the occasion for judicial action cannot arise until a claim
is made that an actual wrong has been done or is
immediately threatened, and, moreover (what is much thesame thing stated in another way), that a decision cannotproperly be classed as a judgment, as strictly judicialact, unless, besides determining the merits of thecontroversy between the parties, deciding which is right,
it affords (or denies) some additional remedy––in other
words “consequential relief”––and therefore that power to
decide a controversy in the absence of the conditions
indicated is not judicial and cannot be conferred uponcourts by the Legislature. This view appears to us to be
unsound, and to be the result of confusing declaratory
judgments with advisory opinions and decisions in moot
cases, and perhaps also of an inclination to treat a
general practice that has been long established as having
acquired the force of a constitutional guaranty. A mere 
advisory opinion upon an abstract question is obviously not
a judgment at all, since there are no parties to be bound,and the rights of no one are directly affected. The 
56 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
situation is substantially the same where opposing parties
present a moot question––one the decision of which can haveno practical effect. Where a judgment is sought of suchcharacter as to be of no benefit unless accompanied by anorder the carrying out of which is impossible, the futilityof the proceeding is a sufficient basis for a court’s
refusal to entertain it, whether or not jurisdiction to do
so exists. But some judgments are wholly or in part self– operative. They perform a valuable function in and of themselves. It is often said that a cause of action arises only upon the breach of a duty––the invasion of a right.
This, however, is merely the announcement of a general rule
of practice subject to possible exceptions and to
legislative change. . . . 
201 P. at 84. 
Thus, the Kansas Supreme Court indicated that an 
“a
ctual controversy” under the Kansas declaratory judgment act 
(which Hawaiʻi copied in its entirety) did not require additional 
“c
onsequential relief,” but could not be an “advisory opinion” 
upon an abstract question or that involved a “moot” case, for 
which a declaratory judgment would have no practical effect. 
Therefore, at the time of the enactment of Hawaiʻi’s declaratory 
judgment act, it appears an “actual controversy” was one that 
that did not lack justiciability based on the “advisory opinion” 
prohibition or “mootness” prongs of justiciability concerns. 
Much later, in Life of the Land II, we indicated that an “actual 
controversy” was one that generally satisfied prudential rules 
of self-governance, including “standing.” Life of the Land II, 
63 Haw. at 171-78, 624 P.2d at 437-42. 
Acc
ordingly, the first prong of HRS 632-1(b) allowing 
for declaratory relief in a case of “actual controversy” between 
57 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
contending parties merely mandates that prudential requirements, 
including standing, be satisfied, but does not set out any 
actual standing requirements. 
In the second prong of HRS § 632-1(b), however, the 
legislature has expressed its policy and has expressed its view 
regarding the “proper — and properly limited — role of [our] 
courts” – by providing that a party has standing to bring an action for declaratory relief in a civil case (1) where 
antagonistic claims exist between the parties (i) that indicate 
imminent and inevitable litigation, or (ii) where the party 
seeking declaratory relief has a concrete interest in a legal 
relation, status, right, or privilege that is challenged or 
denied by the other party, who has or asserts a concrete 
interest in the same legal relation, status, right, or 
privilege; and (2) a declaratory judgment will serve to 
terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the 
proceeding. 
The Chief Justice’s Dissent acknowledges that “[w]hen 
the bill that enacted HRS §§ 632-1 and 632-6 was first introduced in 1921, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary 
explained that its purpose was to provide ‘parties in dispute’ a 
judicial determination of rights ‘before a cause of action 
accrues by breach of such rights by either party.’” Dissenting 
Opinion by Recktenwald, C.J. (citing S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 
58 35 The Chief Justice opines that HRS § 632-1 does not set out standing
requirements and would hold that a party would usually need to satisfy the
common law three-part “injury in fact” test to have standing to seek
declaratory relief under HRS § 632-1. The Chief Justice does not address 
whether Tax Foundation would satisfy the three-party “injury in fact” test
here and instead applies the common law two-part “taxpayer standing” test
articulated in Hawaii’s Thousand Friends v. Anderson, 70 Haw. 276, 283, 768 
P.2d 1293, 1299 (1989), that “(1) plaintiff must be a taxpayer who
contributes to the particular fund from which the illegal expenditures are
allegedly made; and (2) plaintiff must suffer a pecuniary loss [by the
increase of the burden of taxation], which, in cases of fraud, are presumed.
70 Haw. at 282, 768 P.2d at 1298. He opines that Tax Foundation satisfies
both requirements for taxpayer standing in this case. It therefore appears
that the Chief Justice considers “taxpayer standing” to be a more relaxed
common law standing test than the three-part “injury in fact” test.
“Taxpayer standing” clearly does not require a showing of the third prong of
the “injury in fact” test — that “a favorable decision would likely provide
relief for the plaintiff’s injury.” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
263, in 1921 Senate Journal, at 616) . Consistent with this 
purpose, the plain language of HRS § 632-1 does not require 
satisfaction of a three-part “injury in fact” test for a party 
to have standing. Imposition of this additional requirement 
when standing requirements of HRS § 632-1 have otherwise been 
met limits the availability of declaratory relief in our state 
courts. Thus, imposition of an additional “injury in fact” requirement contravenes the legislature’s specific declaration 
of policy regarding HRS § 632-1 standing as well as its general 
declaration of policy under HRS § 632-6 that Chapter 632 “be 
liberally interpreted and administered, with a view to making 
the courts more serviceable to the people.” Requiring 
satisfaction of an additional “injury in fact” test for standing 35 
59 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
under HRS § 632-1 contravenes prudential considerations of the 
“proper – and properly limited – role of courts.” 
To summarize, restricting standing by imposing 
stan
ding requirements that do not exist in the language of HRS § 
632-1, despite the express intent of the legislature, is antithetical to prudential considerations. As stated by the 
United States Supreme Court, courts “cannot limit a cause of action that [the legislature] has created merely because 
‘prudence’ dictates.” Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control 
Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 128 (2014).
 3 6
We therefore hold that a party has standing to seek 
declaratory relief in a civil case brought pursuant to HRS § 
632-1 (1) where antagonistic claims exist between the parties 
(a) that indicate imminent and inevitable litigation, or (b) 
where the party seeking declaratory relief has a concrete 
interest in a legal relation, status, right, or privilege that 
is challenged or denied by the other party, who has or asserts a 
concrete interest in the same legal relation, status, right, or 
privilege; and (2) a declaratory judgment will serve to 
terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the 
proceeding. 
60 36 Our discussion of recent cases in Section IV.C.3.c, indicates that some 
of our decisions may have had that result. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Our holding is consistent with standing requirements 
set out by the legislature through the language of the statute. 
The common law three-part “injury in fact” test is simply 
inconsistent with HRS Chapter 632. For example, the first prong 
of the three-part “injury in fact” test for standing requires a 
showing that “the plaintiff has suffered an actual or threatened 
injury as a result of the defendant’s conduct.” This is a greater showing than required by HRS § 632-1(b), which does not 
require an “actual or threatened injury.” The second prong of 
the three-part “injury in fact” test requires a showing that 
“the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant’s actions,” a 
requirement that also does not exist under the language of HRS § 
632-1(b). The third prong of the “injury in fact” test is also 
more stringent, as it requires a showing that “a favorable 
decision would likely provide relief for the plaintiff’s 
injury,” rather than a showing that a declaratory judgment will 
serve to terminate the uncertainty or controversy. The third prong also clearly violates the language of HRS § 632-1(a), 
which provides that declaratory relief may be sought whether or 
not consequential relief could be claimed.
37 
(c
ontinued . . .) 
61 37 The Dissent asserts that construing HRS § 632-1 as delineating its own
standing requirements “injects unnecessary complexity into a simple doctrine
and a straightforward line of case law,” and suggests that “stray[ing] fromthis court’s precedent applying the ‘injury in fact’ test to HRS § 632-1
actions” constitutes a complexity about standing that creates a barrier to
justice. The three-part “injury in fact” test for standing is, however, far
from “simple” or “straightforward.” See, e.g., Juan Olano, Note, The38 The Dissent states that “removal” of the “injury in fact” “requirement”
“marks a departure from a long history of judicial intervention only in
justiciable controversies that are presented in an adversary context.” As 
discussed, however, there is no “long history” of the “injury in fact”
requirement for standing in Hawaiʻi courts; the concept was introduced in 1981
in Life of the Land II, and not in the context of HRS § 632-1, but in the
context of HRS § 91-7. See Life of the Land II, 63 Haw. at 173, 623 P.2d at 438-49. It was not until the 2001 Mottl case that the “injury in fact” testwas applied to HRS § 632-1. The statutory language of HRS § 632-1 has neverincluded an “injury in fact” requirement, so there was no “injury in fact”requirement to remove. In addition, nothing in this opinion removes the
requirement of a “justiciable controvers[y] presented in an adversary
context.” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI R
 EPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Finally, our holding regarding the requirements for 
standing under HRS § 632-1 is consistent with the “less 
stringent requirements for access and participation in the court 
process” under HRS § 632-1, and recognizes that “[o]ur 
touchstone remains the ‘needs of justice.’” Life of the Land 
II, 63 Haw. at 176, 623 P.2d at 441 (citation omitted).38 
e. Tax Foundation Has Standing under HRS § 632-1 
Applying the standing requirements delineated above to 
the facts of this case, we hold that Tax Foundation has HRS § 
632-1 standing as: (1) (a) antagonistic claims exist between Tax 
Foundation and the State with respect to whether HRS § 248-2.6 
(1993 & Supp. 2005) requires additional amounts from its rail 
surcharge payments be paid over to HART; and, under prong (ii),

axpayer to bring suit, we now consider the merits of its 
challenge.40 
The parties dispute whether the plain language of HRS 
§ 248-2.6 expressly requires the State to retain 10% of the 
Honolulu County surcharge, as the State contends, or whether the 
State is required to retain only those costs it actually incurs 
in its administration of the surcharge, as Tax Foundation 
contends. 
HRS § 248-2.6 provides in relevant part: 
(a) . . . Out of the revenues generated by county
surcharges on state tax paid into each respective state
treasury special account or the mass transit special fund,the director of finance shall deduct ten per cent of the
gross proceeds of a respective county’s surcharge on state
tax to reimburse the State for the costs of assessment,collection, disposition, and oversight of the countysurcharge on state tax incurred by the State. Amountsretained shall be general fund realizations of the State. 
(b) The amounts deducted for costs of assessment,
collection, disposition, and oversight of county surcharges
on state tax shall be withheld from payment to the counties
by the State out of the county surcharges on state tax
collected for the current calendar year. 
64 40 We note that the circuit court did not reach the parties’ arguments on
the merits, having ruled that the cross-motions for summary judgment were
moot. However, this court may decide questions of law even when they werenot reached by the trial court. Gregg Kendall & Assocs., Inc. v. Kauhi, 53Haw. 88, 94, 488 P.2d 136, 141 (1971); see also Bush v. Watson, 81 
Hawaiʻi  
474, 487, 918 P.2d 1130, 1143 (1996) (holding third-party agreements violated
the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act despite trial court not ruling on that
issue). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(c) For the purpose of this section, the costs of
assessment, collection, disposition, and oversight of the
county surcharges on state tax shall include any and allcosts, direct or indirect, that are deemed necessary andproper to effectively administer this section and sections
237-8.6 and 238-2.6. 
(d) For a county with a population equal to or less than
five hundred thousand that adopts a county surcharge on
state tax, after the deduction and withholding of the costs
under subsections (a) and (b), the director of finance
shall pay the remaining balance on a quarterly basis to the
director of finance of each county that has adopted a
county surcharge on state tax under section 46-16.8. . . . 
HRS § 248-2.6. 
It is well-established that: 
[W]here there is no ambiguity in the language of a statute,
and the literal application of the language would not
produce an absurd or unjust result, clearly inconsistentwith the purposes and policies of the statute, there is noroom for judicial construction and interpretation, and thestatute must be given effect according to its plain andobvious meaning. 
State v. Palama, 62 Haw. 159, 161, 612 P.2d 1168, 1170 (1980). 
Additionally, “courts are bound, if rational and 
p
racticable, to give effect to all parts of a statute, and that 
no clause, sentence, or word shall be construed as superfluous, 
void, or insignificant if a construction can be legitimately found which will give force to and preserve all the words of the 
statute.” Camara v. Agsalud, 67 Haw. 212, 215-216, 685 P.2d 
794, 797 (1984). 
Tax Foundation argues that HRS § 248-2.6 requires the 
State’s initial 10% deduction to be reduced by the costs 
specified in subsection (c), and that the State must remit the 
remaining balance back to the City and County of Honolulu. 
65 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Whether subsection (c) requires a calculation of actual costs, 
when viewed in isolation, is ambiguous. However, when viewed in 
context with the rest of the statute, the scope of subsection 
(c) becomes clear. Nothing in the remaining portions of HRS § 
248-2.6 suggests a requirement to engage in such a calculation 
and reimbursement. There is no language in the statute that 
establishes a procedure for remitting the funds in excess of the State’s withholding. Beyond stating that “[a]mounts retained 
shall be general fund realizations of the State[,]” the text of 
HRS § 248-2.6 does not contemplate any other manner of the 
disposition of the 10% deduction. 
T
he language of HRS § 248-2.6 expressly requires that 
the State retain 10% of the surcharge proceeds, and a literal 
application of the statute’s language does not produce an absurd 
or unjust result. HRS § 248-2.6(a) provides that the State 
“shall deduct ten per cent . . . to reimburse the State for the 
costs of assessment . . . .” Subsections (b) and (d) prescribe the timing and payment of the surcharge balance to the counties, 
and (c) explains the broad range of costs contemplated by the 
legislature in determining that 10% was an appropriate 
retention. This construction of HRS § 248-2.6(a) does not 
render the remaining subsections superfluous, void, or 
insignificant, as contended by Tax Foundation. Nor is this 
application of the language clearly inconsistent with the 
66 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
purpose of reimbursing the State for the costs of assessment, 
collection, disposition, and oversight of the county surcharge. 
The legislative history of Act 247 also supports the 
i
nterpretation that HRS § 248-2.6 requires the State to retain 
10% of surcharge proceeds. Prior to its final amendment in conference committee, the bill that eventually became HRS § 248-
2.6(a) contained the following language regarding the State’s retention of costs: 
[T]he director of finance shall retain, from time to time,
sufficient amounts to reimburse the State for the costs of 
assessment, collection, and disposition of the countysurcharge on state tax incurred by the State . . . . 
H.B. 1309, H.D. 2, S.D. 2, 23rd Leg., Reg. Sess. (2005) 
(emphasis added), available at https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/ 
session2005/bills/HB1309_SD2_.htm. 
The conference committee amended this subsection to 
its current form, which states: 
[T]he director of finance shall deduct ten per cent of the
gross proceeds of a respective county’s surcharge on statetax to reimburse the State for the costs of assessment,collection, and disposition of the county surcharge onstate tax incurred by the State. 
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 186, in 2005 House Journal, at 1829; 2005 
Senate Journal, at 1092; 2005 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 247, § 5 at 
773 (emphasis added). 
The legislative history therefore reflects the 
legislature’s intent to set the costs at 10% instead of requiring the State to calculate, “from time to time, sufficient 
67          1. HRS § 248-2.6 Does Not Violate the Equal Protection
Clauses of the Hawaiʻi or U.S. Constitutions *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
amounts” to reimburse itself for the costs of the surcharge’s 
administration. Accordingly, we conclude that HRS § 248-2.6 
requires the State to retain 10% of the surcharge’s gross 
proceeds. 
E. HRS § 248-2.6 Survives Constitutional Scrutiny 
Tax Foundation argues that the State’s interpretation 
o
f HRS § 248-2.6 violates the equal protection clauses of the 
state and federal constitutions. See Haw. Const. art. I, § 5; 
U.S. Const. amend. XIV. “[T]he equal protection clauses of the 
United States and Hawaiʻi Constitutions mandate that all persons 
s
imilarly situated shall be treated alike[.]” DW Aina Lea 
Development, LLC v. Bridge Aina Lea, LLC., 134 Hawaiʻi 187, 218, 
339 P.3d 685, 716 (2014) (quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
“Equal protection jurisprudence has typically been concerned 
with governmental classifications that affect some groups of 
citizens differently than others.” Id. (quotation marks and 
brackets omitted). It is well-established that “unless 
fundamental rights or suspect classifications are implicated, we 
will apply the rational basis standard of review in examining a 
denial of equal protection claim.” KNG Corp. v. Kim, 107 Hawaiʻi 
73, 82, 110 P.3d 397, 406 (2005) (quoting Sandy Beach Def. Fund 
v. City Council, 70 Haw. 361, 380, 773 P.2d 250, 262 (1989)) 
68 41 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(emphasis omitted). The rational basis standard of review 
applies here because Tax Foundation does not allege that either 
a fundamental right or a suspect classification is implicated.41 
Under rational basis review, “[t]he test of 
constitutionality is whether that statute has a rational 
relation to a legitimate state interest.” Maeda v. Amemiya, 60 
Haw. 662, 669, 594 P.2d 136, 141 (1979) (citations omitted). The party challenging the constitutionality of a statutory 
classification has the burden of showing that the classification 
is not rationally related to its statutory purpose. Sandy Beach 
Def. Fund, 70 Haw. at 380, 773 P.2d at 262. Furthermore, the 
rational basis standard “is especially deferential in the 
context of classifications made by complex tax laws. [I]n 
structuring internal taxation schemes the States have large 
leeway in making classifications and drawing lines which in 
The parties dispute whether Honolulu taxpayers have been classified by
the legislature as a result of HRS § 248-2.6. Tax Foundation argues that
Honolulu taxpayers are a “distinctive class” as a result of the State’s
interpretation of HRS § 248-2.6, because they alone fund State functions
available to all Hawai ʻi residents through their contributions to the
surcharge, a portion of which is retained by the State. The State asserts 
that the legislature has made no classification as a result of HRS § 248-2.6
because each county was permitted to levy a surcharge on state tax by passing
the required ordinance, and therefore there is “no differential treatment ofHonolulu residents even if other counties have not chosen to implement the
surcharge.” For the purposes of this discussion, we assume that Tax
Foundation is correct since Honolulu taxpayers are subject to a different tax
burden from those of other counties. 
69 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
their judgment produce reasonable systems of taxation.” 
Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 11 (1992) (citations omitted). 
Applying these principles here, the State’s collection 
of 10% of the surcharge’s gross proceeds pursuant to HRS § 248-
2.6 is rational. The State’s legitimate interest is in 
reimbursing itself for the costs incurred in its administration 
of the surcharge. The State’s 10% retention of the surcharge’s gross proceeds is rationally related to this interest because in 
2005, it was uncertain what the potential burden of the 
surcharge’s administration would be, and it was reasonable for 
the State to estimate administration costs at 10% of the 
surcharge’s gross proceeds. The purpose of the 10% retention 
under HRS § 248-2.6(a), to reimburse the State for its costs, 
was served because costs were incurred as a result of 
administering the surcharge. Beyond this stated purpose, it is 
also rational for Honolulu taxpayers to bear an increased tax 
burden to further a state interest in mitigating increased burdens on State services incurred by State agencies due to the 
implementation of the mass transit rail system, the use and 
benefit of which the City and County of Honolulu alone receives. 
A
ccordingly, the State’s retention of 10% of the 
surcharge’s gross proceeds has a rational relation to the 
purpose of reimbursing the State for the cost of administering 
the surcharge. HRS § 248-2.6 therefore does not violate the 
70 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
protections guaranteed by the equal protection clauses of the 
Hawaii or United States Constitutions. 
2. HR
S § 248-2.6 Does Not Violate the General Laws
Provision of the Hawai ʻi Constitution 
Tax Foundation also argues that the State’s 
application of HRS § 248-2.6 is unconstitutional because it 
violates the general laws provision of the Hawaiʻi Constitution, 
f
ound in Article VIII, § 1. That provision states: 
The legislature shall create counties, and may create other
political subdivisions within the State, and provide forthe government thereof. Each political subdivision shallhave and exercise such powers as shall be conferred undergeneral laws. 
Haw. Const. art. VIII, § 1. 
General laws, as used in Article VIII, § 1, are laws 
that: 
apply uniformly throughout all political subdivisions ofthe State. But a law may apply to less than all of thepolitical subdivisions and still be a general law, if itapplies uniformly to a class of political subdivisions,which, considering the purpose of the legislation, aredistinguished by sufficiently significant characteristics
to make them a class by themselves. 
Bulgo v. County. of Maui, 50 Haw. 51, 58, 430 P.2d 321, 326 
(1967). 
Act 247 applies uniformly to all political 
subdivisions of the state because each county is given the opportunity to adopt the surcharge. See HRS § 46-16.8(a) (“Each 
county may establish a surcharge on state tax . . . .”). Any 
county that does so is subject to a withholding by the State of 
71 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
10% of the gross proceeds of the surcharge as provided in HRS 
§ 248-2.6. The fact that the City and County of Honolulu is the 
only county that has adopted the surcharge does not change the 
fact that HRS § 248-2.6 applies uniformly to all Hawai ʻi 
taxpayers who live in counties that have opted in and adopted 
the surcharge. Whether the statute requires the State to retain 
10% of the surcharge’s gross proceeds or retain only its actual 
costs similarly does not change the fact that each county is 
treated the same with respect to the disposition of those 
proceeds. Accordingly, the State’s interpretation of HRS § 248-
2.6 does not violate the General Laws provision of our 
constitution. 
V
. Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the circuit 
court’s order and judgment granting the State’s motion to 
dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Because we 
conclude that the State’s application of HRS § 248-2.6 is 
consistent with the statute’s plain language and legislative 
intent, and that HRS § 248-2.6 does not violate the state or 
federal constitutions, we remand this case to the circuit court 
72 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
with instructions to grant the State’s motion for summary 
judgment.
