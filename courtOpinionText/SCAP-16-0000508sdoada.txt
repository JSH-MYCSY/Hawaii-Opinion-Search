SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ., and

On interlocutory appeal, Defendant- Appellee  Kaupo 
Ranch, Ltd. (Kaupo Ranch or the Ranch)  challenges the Circuit 
Court of the Second Circuit’s June 8, 2016 “Order Granting 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Su mmary Judgment Filed April 28, 
2016.”  The circuit court granted partial summary judgment to 
Plaintiff-Appellee The Malulani Group (Malulani Group or the Electronically Filed

 Group) on remand from a decision by the Intermediate Court of 
Appeals (ICA) in Malulani Group’s favor on two issues relating 
to the existence of 
an implied easement from a landlocked parcel 
on Maui to the nearest road.  See Malulani Grp., Ltd. v. Kaupo 
Ranch, Ltd. , 133 Hawai ʻi 425, 329 P.3d 330 (App. 2014).  The 
parcel1 is owned  by the Malulani Group.  T he easement would run 
across property owned by the Ranch.  We accepted transfer of 
Kaupo Ranch’s interlocutory appeal of the grant of partial 
summary judgment to Malulani.   We affirm the circuit court’s 
grant of partial summary judgment on remand.   Id. at 436, 329 
P.3d at 341 
The ICA’ s decision  involved two issues.  First, Kaupo 
Ranch had argued that only private ownership of the parcels 
prior to severance can satisfy the first element of an implied 
easement, not government ownership.  In a case of first 
impression in Hawai ʻi, the ICA held that the “unity of ownership” 
element for an implied easement (also described as the common 
                                                           
 1  Whether the Malulani parcel is landlocked as a matter of fact is 
not before us.  In other words, whether the Malulani parcel was landlocked at 
the time of severance, and remains so now, goes only to the fourth element 
for an easement implied by necessity, as well as the fourth element for an 
easement implied by prior use, not the first element at issue here.  See Jon 
W. Bruce & James W. Ely, Jr., The Law of Easements and Licenses in Land  § 4.6 
(2018)(describing the four elements for an easement by necessity); id. at §§ 
4.11-12(noting that the fourth element for an easement by necessity requires 
necessity at the time of severance and continuing necessity); id.  at § 4.16 
(stating that the fourth element of an easement by prior use requires the 
necessity at severance for the preexisting use to continue).  The common 
grantor or “unity of ownership” requirement is the first element of both 
forms of implied easement.  Id. at §§ 4.6, 4.16.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 grantor requirement) may be satisfied by the Kingdom of Hawaii’s 
ownership of the two parcels prior to severance.2  Id. at 430-33, 
329 P.3d at 335-38.  Second, the ICA held that the statute of 
limitations in Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 657–313 does not 
apply to implied easements, as Kaupo Ranch had urged, but only 
to easements by prescription, a form of easement not here at 
issue.  Id.  at 434-36, 329 P.3d at 339-41. 
On remand, the Malulani Group moved for summary 
judgment on the issues of law decided in its favor by the ICA, 
namely, the unity of ownership and statute of limitations 
issues.  Malulani Group argued to the circuit court that the 
ICA’s decision in its favor was the law of the case and that, in 
any event, the ICA opinion was properly decided.   Kaupo Ranch 
argued that the ICA’s conclusion that the “unity of ownership” 
element for an implied easement may be satisfied by government 
ownership contradicted our precedents regarding the 
interpretation of royal patent grants, specifically, the use of 
parol evidence in construing them.  In addition, Kaupo Ranch 
argued that there is a common law limitation period for bringing 
                                                           
 2  On the unity of ownership (or common grantor) element for implied 
easements, see Ass’n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., 
Ltd. , 100 Hawaiʻ i 97, 105, 58 P.3d 608, 616 (2002) (“All implications of 
easements necessarily involve an original unity of ownership of the parcels 
which later become the dominant and servient parcels.”  (citation  omitted)).  
 
 3  HRS § 657 -31 (“No person shall commence an action to recover 
possession of any lands, or make any entry thereon, unless within twenty 
years after the right to bring the action first accrued. ”)

 an action for interference with an easement, and that Malulani 
Group’s claim for an easement accrued more than twenty years 
before the complaint was filed.  The circuit court rejected the 
Ranch’s arguments and granted Malulani Group’s motion for 
summary judgment on the “unity of ownership” and statute of 
limitations issues. 
We affirm the circuit court’s grant of summary 
judgment on each issue.  The ICA correctly decided that initial 
ownership of both parcels by the Kingdom of Hawai ʻi satisfies the 
“unity of ownership” or common grantor element for implied 
easements.4  Malulani , 133 Hawai ʻi at 429- 34, 329 P.3d at 334- 39. 
In addition, the ICA correctly held that no statute of 
limitations applies to implied easements and that HRS § 657-31 
governs easements by prescription, which involve the easement 
equivalent of adverse possession.  Id. at 434-36, 329 P.3d at 
339-41. 
The circuit court on remand from the ICA decision 
properly granted summary judgment to Malulani Group on each of 
the two issues in accord with the ICA’s decision.  We affirm the 
circuit court’s June 8, 2016 “Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion 
for Partial Summary J udgment Filed April 28, 2016.”   We remand

implied by necessity and an easement implied by prior use . *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
