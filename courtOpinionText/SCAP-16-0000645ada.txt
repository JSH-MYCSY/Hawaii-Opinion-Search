2 is not a party may challenge a foreclosing plaintiff’s 
entitlement to enforce the n
ote.  Because the requirement-- that 
a party seeking to foreclose must be entitled to enforce the 
note at the inception of the foreclosure action --is based on 
principles of standing and statutory construction rather than 
contractual rights, we hold that the purchaser may assert such a 
challenge.  In this case, the evidence Wells Fargo presented 
regarding its entitlement to foreclose at the time the complaint 
was filed was not admissible on the grounds 
asserted, and 
therefore we vacate 
the order granting summary judgment and 
remand the case for further proceedings. 
I. BACKGROUND 
A. Factual History 
 
 On January 30, 2006, Karen Zakarian executed a 
promissory note (Note) in favor of the Funding Group, Inc. 
(Funding Group) for $408,000.  Funding Group then endorsed the 
note to Option One Mortgage Corp. (Option One) via an allonge,1 
and Option One endorsed the N
ote in blank via another allonge .2  
                     
 1 “An ‘allonge’ is defined as ‘[a] slip of paper sometimes attached 
to a negotiable instrument for the purpose of receiving further indorsements 
when the original paper is filled with indorsements.’”  Mortgage Elec. 
Registration Sys., Inc. v. Wise , 130 Hawai i 11, 14 n.6, 304 P.3d 1192, 1195 
n.6 (2013) (quoting Allonge , Black’s Law Dictionary  (9th ed. 2009)).  
 2 If an instrument is endorsed in blank, it is payable to the 
bearer.  Hawaii Revised Statutes §  490:3-205(b) (2008).  For example, a 
holder of an instrument may write “pay to the order of” and not write the

3 The Note was secured by a mortgage executed by Zakarian in favor 
of Funding Group (Mortgage) on property located at 1430- 4 
Hunakai Street #106 in Honolulu (the “ Property”), which is in a 
condominium project called Waialae Gardens.  The Mortgage was 
subsequently assigned from Funding Group to Option One on July 
5, 2006, and then from Option One to Wells Fargo on May 10, 
2007. 
  
Following a bankruptcy proceeding, Zakarian entered 
into a security retention agreement on March 14, 2011, with 
American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc. (AHMS), a loan servicer 
acting on Wells Fargo ’s behalf, which required that she continue 
to make payments and comply with the terms of the Note and the 
Mortgage in order to remain in the Property .  Subsequently, a s a 
result of a separate foreclosure action between the Association 
of Apartment Owners of Waialae Gardens (AOAO) and Zakarian, a 
court-appointed commissioner conveyed the Property via a 
commissioner’
s apartment deed to Jonathan Behrendt on November 
23, 2011.  An exhibit to the deed noted the Mortgage as an 
encumbrance.  AHMS notified Zakarian in a written notice dated

name of the endorsee.  See Uniform Commercial Code  § 3-205 cmt. 2 (Am. Law. 
Inst. & Unif. Law Comm’n 2002).  This is a blank endorsement.  Id. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
4 November 29, 2011, tha t she was in default under the terms of 
the Note and Mortgage.    
B. Circuit Court Proceedings 
  Wells Fargo filed a  complaint in the Circuit Court of 
the First Circuit (circuit court) on March 9, 2015,  against 
Behrendt and the AOAO, inter alia, seeking foreclosure of the 
Mortgage and sale of the P roperty.  The complaint asserted that 
Wells Fargo was the holder of the Note and entitled to enforce 
it, that the Note was secured by the Mort gage, and that Wells 
Fargo was the mortgagee of record.  Additionally, the complaint 
alleged that Zakarian had defaulted in the performance of the 
terms set forth in the Note and Mortgage.   Copies of , inter 
alia, the Note, two allonges --one made out to Option One and one 
endorsed in blank, the Mortgage , and assignments from Funding 
Group to Option One and from Option One to Wells Fargo were 
attached to the complaint as exhibits .  The complaint also 
stated that the AOAO had previously foreclosed on the Property , 
that the Property was conveyed to Behrendt by virtue of a 
commissioner’s deed, and that the interest of Behrendt in the 
Property was subject to the Mortgage.  Wells Fargo asserted that 
it was entitled to foreclosur e of the M ortgage and the sale of 
the Property.   
  Following Behrendt ’s answer to the complaint, Wells 
Fargo moved for summary judgment and for a decree of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
5 foreclosure.  Wells Fargo attached as an exhibit to the summary 
judgment motion, inter alia, a declaration of Vanessa Lewis 
(Lewis Declaration).  Lewis averred that she was a contract 
management coordinator for Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC  (Ocwen), 
the new servicer for Wells Fargo for the M ortgage, and in that 
capacity had access to and was familiar with Wells Fargo’s 
records pertaining to the case, including Ocwen’s records 
related to servicing the loan.  Lewis indicated that she had 
personal knowledge of the facts and matters stated,  based on her 
review of the business records described in her declaration.  
Lewis stated that  Ocwen’s records related to the loan were made 
and are maintained in the regular course of Ocwen’s busine ss.  
According to those records, Lewis represented, Wells Fargo is in 
possession of the original  Note between Zakarian and Funding 
Group, a copy of which was attached to the summary judgment 
motion along with copies of the allonges and Mortgage.  
Additionally, Lewis stated that written notice was sent to 
Zakarian regarding her default on payments and Zakarian did not 
timely cure the default.   
  In opposition to the motion for summary judgment, 
Behrendt responded that, although Lewis claimed to be an Ocwen 
contract management coordinator and alleged that Ocwen was the 
servicing agent for Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo did not provide the 
court with any such authorization or agency agreement.  Behrendt ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
6 also asserted that neither Lewis nor Wells Fargo explained what 
her role or relationship to Wells Fargo was besides claiming 
that she had  access to Ocwen’s business records .  Lewis did not 
claim to be the custodian of the records,  Behrendt argued, or 
provide any foundation to establish her competency to 
authenticate tho se records beyond merely being familiar with 
them.  Thus, Lewis did not establish that she could authenticate 
the documents, Behrendt concluded, and her statements were 
inadmissible hearsay.  Behrendt therefore maintained  that Wells 
Fargo did not meet its burden of production to succeed on the 
summary judgment motion because there was a genuine issue of 
material fact as to the authenticity of the N ote and as to 
whether Wells Fargo was the holder of the N ote.   
  In its reply, W ells Fargo asserted that the testimony 
in the Lewis Declaration was admissible because it was subject 
to the hearsay exception for records of regularly conducted 
activity.  (Citing Hawaii  Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 
803(b)(6).)    
  On August 30, 2016, the  circuit court granted the 
summary judgment motion and issu ed a foreclosure decree in its 
“Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of 
Foreclosure Against All Defendants on Complaint Filed March 9, 
2015” (Order Granting Summary Judgment).  The court concluded ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
7 that Wells Fargo was entitled to have the M ortgage foreclosed, 
to have the Property sold free and clear of Behrendt’s claim, 
and to judgment in its favor as a matter of law on the 
complaint.  The court filed the Judgment the same day.  Behrendt 
timely appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) from 
the Order Granting Summary Judgment and the 
Judgment.3  
II. STANDARD S OF REVIEW  
  A trial court’s findings of fact are reviewed under 
the clearly erroneous standard of review.  Dan v. State , 76 
Hawaiʻi 423, 428, 879 P.2d 528, 533 (1994).  Conclusions of law , 
in contrast, are reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard 
of review.  Marvin v. Pflueger , 127 Hawai ʻi 490, 495, 280 P.3d 
88, 93 (2012).  Specifically, t his court reviews “the circuit 
court’s grant or denial of summary judgment de novo.”  Querubin  
v. Thronas, 107 Hawai ʻi 48, 56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005)  
(citation omitted) .  Similarly,  “[o]n appeal, the issue of 
standing is reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard.”  
Abaya v. Mantell, 112 Hawai ʻi 176, 180, 145 P.3d 719, 723 (2006)  
(citation omitted) . 
                     
 3 After the parties submitted briefs to the ICA, Wells Fargo ’s 
application for transfer to this court was granted.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
8 III.  DISCUSSION 
A. Behrendt May Challenge T he Foreclosure  
  Behrendt contends that Wells Fargo did not meet its 
prima facie burden of demonstrating that it was the holder of 
the Note at the time its complaint was filed and did not provide 
any admissible evidence that it possessed the Note at the time 
it filed its motion for summary judgment.  Behrendt argues that 
the Lewis Declaration did not demonstrate personal knowledge of 
any such facts, but that it instead offered vague, unfounded 
testimony that amounted to inadmissible hearsay at best.  Thus, 
Behrendt contends that genuine issues of material fact remain in 
dispute with respect to Wells Fargo ’s standing to sue  and 
whether Wells Fargo was the holder of the Note secured by the 
Mortgage.   
  Wells Fargo contends that because B ehrendt was not a 
party to the Mortgage and because the re is no reasonable 
interpretation of the M ortgage that confers contractual rights, 
obligations, and standing on Behrendt or upon any subsequent 
purchaser who does not assume the M ortgage,  Behrendt could not 
“seek protection” under the Mortgage.  In other words, Wells 
Fargo argues that Behrendt could not attack the  foreclosure 
because he  was a stranger to the Note and Mortgage  transactions.  
Further, even if Behrendt did have standing to challenge the 
foreclosure, Wells Fargo asserts , the circuit cou rt’s Judgment ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
9 should still be affirmed because t he Lewis Declaration 
authenticates4 the original N ote and states that Lewis had 
“personal knowledge of the facts and matters stated” based on 
her access to and familiarity with its records and the records 
of Ocwen.  
 
 Under our law, a foreclosing party “must demonstrate 
that all conditions precedent to foreclosure under the note and 
mortgage are satisfied and that all steps required by statute 
have been strictly complied with” to prove entitlement to 
foreclose.  Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo
, 139 Hawai ʻi 361, 
367, 390 P.3d 1248, 1254 (2017).  Typically,  this requires that 
the plaintiff “prove the existence of an agreement, the terms of 
the agreement, a default by the mortgagor under the terms of the 
agreement, and giving of the cancellation notice. ”  Id.  A 
foreclosing plaintiff must also prove that the plaintiff is 
entitled to foreclose the note and mortgage.  Id. (citing Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS ) §§ 490:3-301, 490:3-308). 
  Th e “burden to prove entitlement to enforce the note 
overlaps with the requirements of standing in foreclosure 
actions.”  Id. (quoting Mottl v. Miyahira , 95 Hawai ʻi 381, 388, 
23 P.3d 716, 723 (2001)).  Under the doctrine of standing, a 
                     
 4 Wells Fargo uses the term “authenticate” to  describe the act of 
confirming through a declaration that a document is a record of regularly 
conducted business activities admissible under HRE Rule 803(b)(6).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
10 plaintiff typically must have suffered an injury-in -fact to 
“justify exercise of the court’s remedial power s on his or her 
behalf.”  Id. at 368, 390 P.3d at 1255 (citing 
Mottl, 95 Hawai ʻi 
at 389, 23 P.3d at 724).  For a foreclosing plaintiff, the 
injury-in-fact is the mortgag
or’s “failure to satisfy its 
obligation to pay the debt obligation to the note holder.”  Id.  
Thus, a person seeking to judicially foreclose on a mortgage 
following a promissory note default must establish that it was 
the “person entitled to enforce the note” as defined by HRS § 
490:3-301 at the time the foreclosure complaint was filed to 
satisfy standing and to be entitled to prevail on the merits
.5  
                     
 5 HRS § 490:3 -301 (2008) provides as follows:  
“Person entitled to enforce” an instrument means (i) the 
holder of the instrument, (ii) a nonholder in possession of 
the instrument who has the rights of a holder, or (iii) a 
person not in possession of the instrument who is entitled 
to enforce the instrument pursuant to section 490:3 -309 or 
490:3-418(d).  A person may be a person entitled to enforce 
the instrument even though the person is not the owner of 
the instrument or is in wrongful possession of the 
instrument.  
“Holder” as it appears in the statute is a term of art, defined in HRS § 
490:1-201(b) (2008 ) as  
(1) The person in possession of a negotiable instrument 
that is payable either to bearer or to an identified person 
that is the person in possession;  
(2) The person in possession of a negotiable tangible 
document of title if the goods are deliverable either to 
bearer or to the order of the person in possession; or  
(3) The person in control of a negotiable electronic 
document of title.  
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
11 Id. at 368-69, 390  P.3d at 1255-56; see also  U.S. Bank N.A. v.  
Mattos, 140 Hawai i 26, 33, 398 P.3d 615, 622 (2017); In re 1250  
Oceanside Partners , 260 F.  Supp. 3d 1300 , 1312-13 (D. Haw. 
2017).   
  Wells Fargo claims that Behrendt ’s defense is 
contractually-based and thus barred by the fact that Behrendt 
was a stranger to the Note and Mortgage .  This court’s reasoning 
in 
Reyes-Toledo, however, was based on standing and the 
statutory foreclosure requirements and was not tied to the 
contractual relationship between the parties.  See 139 Hawai i at 
367–68, 390 P.3d at 1254 –55 (“[A] foreclosing plaintiff does not 
have standing to foreclose on mortgaged property unless the 
plaintiff was entitled to enforce the note that has been 
defaulted on.” (citing Hanalei, BRC Inc. v. Porter , 7 Haw. App. 
304, 310, 760 P.2d 676, 680 (1988))).  Thus, principles 
governing standing and statutory construction--and not 
contracts--apply here.6 
                                                                              
(. . . continued) 
 
As Wells Fargo claims to be entitled to enforce the Note as the holder of the 
Note and in turn argues that it is the holder of the Note by virtue of its 
possession of the endorsed -in-blank Note, Wells Fargo appears to use the 
terms “hold” and “possess” and their derivatives interchangeably.  
 6 Additionally, Behrendt’s argument --that Wells Fargo did not hold 
the Note and was thus itself a stranger to the transaction--does not rely on 
Behrendt’s contractual rights.  Although it is true that Behrendt cannot 
assert an affirmative defense based on rights derived from a contract that he 
is not a party to, no privity of contract is required for Behrendt to argue 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
12   As we observed in Reyes -Toledo, 
requiring “that a 
foreclosing plaintiff prove its entitlement to enforce the note 
at the commencement of the proceedings ‘provides strong and 
necessary incentives to help ensure that a note holder will not 
proceed with a foreclosure action before confirming that it has 
a right to do so.’”   Reyes-Toledo, 139 Hawai ʻi at 369, 390 P.3d 
at 1256 (quoting Deutsche Bank Nat ’l Trust Co. v. Johnston , 369 
P.3d 1046, 1052 (N.M. 2016)) . 
This procedural safeguard is vital because the 
securitization of mortgages has given rise to a pervasive 
failure among mortgage holders to comply with the technical 
requirements underlying the transfer of promissory notes 
and, more generally the recording of interests in property.   
Indeed, scholars have commented on the widespread 
documentation problems that are associated with modern 
mortgage securitization practices.   It appears that under 
these circumstances, not even the plaintiffs may be sure if 
they actually own the notes they seek to enforce . 
Id. (brackets, quotations marks, footnotes, and citations 
omitted). 
  Thus, requiring a foreclosing plaintiff to prove an 
entitlement to foreclose serve s “essential purpose[s ],” such as 
“protect[ing] the maker of an instrument from multiple 
enforcements of the same instrument .”  Id. (citing Porter , 7 
                                                                              
(. . . continued) 
 
that Wells Fargo has not met the burden of proving its right to foreclose on 
the Property.  Indeed, under Wells Fargo’s argued rule, a property owner 
could not defend against an ejectment or replevin action by a  plaintiff 
falsely claiming to have purchased the property from a prior owner because 
the current property owner would not have been a party to the fabricated 
transaction.  This approach is plainly flawed.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
13 Haw. App. at 308, 760 P.2d at 679).  The requirement also serves 
to ensure that a foreclosing party in an action brought against 
a homeowner is actually entitled to bring the action, thus 
protecting the homeowner from an improper foreclosure .  Id.  
This prerequisite serves no less an essential purpose when  the 
homeowner is a subsequent purchaser of the property as Behrendt 
is here.   
  Th e ICA has concluded that a party  who obtains  an 
interest in property subsequent to a foreclosing party can 
challenge the foreclosure.  In Bank of New York Mellon v. Lemay , 
a defendant obtained its interest in the subject property at a 
foreclosure sale, and  a party with a senior secured interest 
later brought a foreclosure action.  137 Hawai ʻi 30, 34, 364 P.3d 
928, 932 (App. 2015).  The defendant sought discovery regarding 
an employee of the purported loan servicer who submitted a 
declaration in support of the plaintiff’s summary judgment 
motion.  See id. at 34-35, 364 P.3d at  932-33.  At a motion to 
compel hearing, the defendant argued that the requested 
information was relevant to determine if the foreclosing party 
had standing and was entitled to foreclose.  Id. at 33, 364 P.3d 
at 931.  The trial court indicated that it was not inclined to 
grant the motion as the defendant was not a party to  the note 
and mortgage.  Id. at 34, 364 P.3d at 932.  The trial court 
later granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, which ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
14 the ICA concluded was effectively a denial of the motion to 
compel.  Id. 
  On review, the ICA reasoned that the defendant was 
“permitted to seek discovery of information relevant to 
defending its interest in the property .”  Id. (citing Hawaiʻ i 
Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 26(b)(1)(A)).  The ICA concluded 
that the trial court’s “hesitation” to grant the motion to 
compel because the defendant was not a party to the note or 
mortgage was “unwarranted”  and that denying the motion was 
error.  Id. at 34– 35, 364 P.3d at 932 –33.  The ICA accordingly 
vacated the order granting summary judgment, ruling that the 
effective denial of the defendant’s  motion to compel constituted 
an abuse of discretion that substantially prejudiced the 
defendant.  Id. at 35, 364 P.3d at 933.   
  A lthough the d efendant was  not a party to the note or 
mortgage in Lemay, the ICA recognized that information rebutting 
the plaintiff’s claim that it was entitled to enforce the note 
was relevant to the defense of the junior interest in the 
property.  Id. at 34 –35, 364 P.3d at 932 –33.  Thus, the Lemay 
decision allowed a subsequent purchaser to cha llenge whether the 
lender was entitled to foreclose on the mortgage securing the 
note.  
  Under facts similar to this case, a court of appeals 
in Florida also concluded that a subsequent purchaser has ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
15 standing to challenge the plaintiff’s authority to bring the 
foreclosure proceeding.  3709 N. Flagler Drive Prodigy Land  
Trust v. Bank of Am., N .A., 226 So.  3d 1040 , 1042-43 (Fla. Dist. 
Ct. App. 2017) (per curiam) [here inafter Prodigy Land Trust ].  
There, the original property owners transferred title of  the 
subject property via quitclaim deed to a trust, after which the 
foreclosing bank filed a foreclosure complaint naming the trust 
as a party.  Id. at 1041.  At trial, the foreclosing bank argued 
that, because the trust was not a party to the note or mortgage, 
the trust “should not be allowed to contest anything other than 
damages.”  Id. 
  The court of appeals disagreed, reasoning that, 
because “[a]n owner of property must be joined in a foreclosure 
proceeding of that property in order to make a decree of 
foreclosure valid,” there was “no question that [the trust] had 
standing to contest the foreclosure proceeding.”  Id. (citations 
omitted).  The court explained that a  “subsequent purchaser  has 
an interest in assuring that the foreclosing plaintiff actually 
has the authority to bring the suit and is entitled to raise 
such a defense.”  Id. at 1042.  Holding otherwise, the court 
concluded, “ would allow a stranger to the note and mortgage to 
foreclose on the property, and a subsequent purchaser would ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
16 never have the ability to defend against the taking of a bona 
fide interest in the property through a foreclosure sale. ”  Id.7 
B. Wells Fargo Did No t Satisfy Its Burden 
  Behrendt contends that Wells Fargo has  not met its 
burden of proving that it was the holder of the N ote at the time 
the complaint was filed because it has  not offered admissible 
evidence on this point.  Wells Fargo responds that the Lewis 
Declaration was sufficient to authenticate the copy of the Note 
attached to its summary judgment motion and that its possession 
of the Note at the time the action was initiated is in turn 
proven by the identical copy of the Note attached to the 
complaint.   
  Under Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 56(e) 
(2000) and Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawai i 
                     
 7 The cases Wells Fargo cites in support of its position are 
inapposite, unpersuasive, or lack precedential value.  They largely involve 
either challenges by individuals who did not possess an interest in the 
property at the time of the foreclosure action, see, e.g., United States v. 
Palmer, 578 F.2d 144, 145 -46 (5th Cir. 1978)  (per curiam); Thriving Invs., 
LLC v. Chao , 184 So. 3d 552 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2015), or subsequent 
purchasers who challenged the substantive terms of the mortgage or the manner 
in which the mortgage was administered, see, e.g. , Johnson v. Ocwen Loan 
Servicing, 374 F. App’x 868 , 871 (11th Cir. 2010)  (per curiam); CCM 
Pathfinder Palm Harbor Mgmt., LLC v. Unknown Heirs of Gendron , 198 So. 3d 3, 
6 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2015).  Wells Fargo also cites an unpublished 
concurrence that is flatly contradicted by a published majority opinion of a 
court of equal authority within the same jurisdiction, compare Pealer v. 
Wilmington Tr. Nat’l Ass’n, 212 So. 3d 1137, 1137 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2017) 
(Sleet, J., concurring)  (per curiam), with Prodigy Land Trust, 226 So. 3d at 
1040-41, and a case that addresses the separate issue of whether a subsequent 
purchaser may affirmatively bring an action based on an allegedly wrongful 
foreclosure after the foreclosure is complete--a matter on which we expressly  
reserve judgment.  See  Garner v. Wells Fargo Home Mortg., Inc. , 505 F. App’x 
837 (11th Cir. 2013) (per curiam).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
17 Rule 7(g) (1997), “a declaration in support of a summary 
judgment motion must be based on personal knowledge, contain 
facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the 
declarant is competent to testify as to the matters contained 
within the declaration.”  U.S. Bank N.A. v. Mattos , 140 Hawai ʻi 
26, 30, 398 P.3d 615, 619 (2017).  Inadmissible evidence “cannot 
serve as a basis for awarding or denying summary judgment.”  
Haw. Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Keka , 94 Hawai i 213, 221, 11 
P.3d 1, 9 (2000) (quoting GE Capital Haw., Inc. v. Miguel , 92 
Hawaii 236, 242, 990 P.2d 134, 140 (App. 1999)).   
  Wells Fargo contended before the circuit court that 
the loan documents attached to its summary judgment motion were 
admissible under the hearsay exception for records of regularly 
conducted business activities.8  (Citing HRE Rule 803(b)(6) 
                     
 8 The circuit court’s conclusions of law did not specify the ground 
on which it determined that the loan documents were admissible.  Because the 
court granted the summary judgment motion after considering Wells Fargo’s 
argument regarding HRE Rule 803(b)(6), which was the sole basis contended for 
admissibility, we consider the court’s ruling as having been premised on HRE 
Rule 803(b)(6). 
  On appeal, Wells Fargo also does not cite an evidentiary rule as 
a basis for the admissibility of the loan documents.  However, it identifies 
State v. Fitzwater as controlling precedent on the issue of the documents’ 
admissibility.  (Citing 122 Hawai i 354, 36 7-68, 227 P.3d 520, 53 3-34 (2010) 
(outlining HRE Rule 803(b)(6)’s application to third -party business records 
that have been incorporated into the receiving company’s business record s).)  
Accordingly, this opinion addresses whether the proffered loan documents fall 
within the requirements of the HRE Rule 803(b)(6) exception and does not 
consider whether the instruments would be admissible under any other basis.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
18 (2002).)  HRE Rule 803(b)(6) ( Supp. 2002 ) provides that the 
following are not excluded by the rule against hearsay: 
A memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any 
form, of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, 
made in the course of a regularly conducted activity, at or 
near the time of the acts, events, conditions, opinions, or 
diagnoses, as shown by the testimony of the custodian or 
other qualified witness , or by certification that complies 
with rule 902(11) or a statute permitting certification, 
unless the sources of information or other circumstances 
indicate lack of trustworthiness.  
 
(Emphasis added.)  Wells Fargo argues that the Lewis Declaration 
establishes that the Note met the requirements for admission 
under HRE Rule 803(b)(6)
.   
 
 The Lewis Declaration reads  in pertinent part as 
follows: 
1.  I am a[] contract Management Coordinator of Ocwen Loan 
Servicing, LLC (“Ocwen”), servicer for WELLS FARGO BANK, 
N.A. AS TRUSTEE FOR OPTION ONE MORTGAGE LOAN TRUST 2006 -2 
ASSET-BACKED CERTIFICATES, SERIES 2006 -2 (“[Wells Fargo]”) 
of the mortgage loan at issue in this case (the “Loan”).  
As such, I am  authorized to make this Declaration.  
2.  I am over the age of 18 years, and I have personal 
knowledge of the facts and matters stated herein based on 
my review of the business records described below.  The 
statements set forth in this Declaration are true  and 
correct, to the best of my knowledge and belief.  
3.  In the regular performance of my job functions, I have 
access to and am familiar with [Wells Fargo]’s records and 
documents relating to this case (the “Records”), including 
Ocwen’s business records  relating to the servicing of the 
Loan (the “Ocwen Records”).  In making this Declaration, I 
relied upon the Records.  
4.  The Ocwen Records document transactions relating to the 
Loan and were made and are maintained in the regular course 
of Ocwen’s business consistent with Ocwen’s regular 
practices, which require that records documenting 
transactions relating to serviced mortgage loans be made at 
or near the time of the transactions documented by a person 
with knowledge of the transactions or from information 
transmitted by such a person.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
19 5.  According to the Ocwen Records, [Wells Fargo] is in 
possession of an original promissory note dated January 30, 
2006 in the principal amount of $408,000.00 executed by 
KAREN LYNN ZAKARIAN in favor of THE FUNDING GROUP, INC. 
(the “Note”).  A true and correct copy of the Note is 
attached hereto as Exhibit 1.  
6.  The Note is endorsed in blank.  
7.  According to the Ocwen Records, the Note is secured by 
a mortgage dated January 30, 2006 and recorded on February 
7, 2006 in  the Bureau of Conveyances of the State of 
Hawaii, as Document Number 2006 -023995 (the “Mortgage”).  A 
true and correct copy of the Mortgage is attached hereto as 
Exhibit 2.  
8.  According to the Ocwen Records, the Mortgage was 
assigned to OPTION ONE MORTGAGE CORPORATION by that 
assignment dated February 3, 2006 and recorded on July 5, 
2006 in the Bureau of Conveyances of the State of Hawaii, 
as Document Number 2006 -123207.  The Mortgage was then 
assigned to [Wells Fargo] by that assignment dated April 
24, 2007 and recorded on May 10, 2007 in the Bureau of 
Conveyances of the State of Hawaii, as Document Number 
2007-084291 (the “Assignments”).  True and correct copies 
of the Assignments are attached hereto as Exhibits 3 and 4.  
  In Mattos , this court reviewed the sufficiency of a 
nearly identical declaration attesting to a promissory note and 
other documents relating to a foreclosure under the HRE Rule 
803(b)(6) business records exception.  140 Hawaiʻ i at 31, 398 
P.3d at 620.  The Lewis Declaration, apart from information 
specific to this case, is virtually identical to the declaration 
in Mattos, which was also prepared by an Ocwen employee.  
Compare Lewis Declaration, supra, with Mattos, 140 Hawai ʻi at 30–
31, 398 P.3d at 619 –20.  This court’s decision in Mattos is 
therefore dispositive as to whether HRE Rule 803(b)(6) may serve 
as a basis to admit into evidence the documents attached to the 
Lewis Declaration. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
20   Lewis did not aver that she was the custodian of 
records for her employer , Ocwen, or for Wells Fargo.  Thus, the 
documents attached to her declaration are admissible under HRE 
Rule 803(b)(6) only if the declaration demonstrates that Lewis 
is a “qualified witness” with respect to those documents.  See 
Mattos, 140 Hawaiʻ i at 32, 398 P.3d at 621.   
  The court in Mattos held that a witness may be 
qualified to provide the testimony required by HRE Rule 
803(b)(6) even if the witness is not employed by the business 
that created the document or lacks direct, p ersonal knowledge of 
how the document was created.  Id.  “There is no requirement 
that the records have been prepared by the entity that has 
custody of them, as long as they were created in the regular 
course of some entity ’s business. ”  Id. (quoting State v.  
Fitzwater , 122 Hawai ʻi 354, 366, 227 P.3d 520,  532 (2010)).  The 
witness, however, must have enough familiarity with the record-
keeping system of the business that created the record to 
explain how the record was generated in the ordinary course of 
business.  Id.   
  Records received from another business and 
incorporated into the receiving business ’ records may in some 
circumstances be regarded as “created” by the receiving 
business.  Id.  Incorporated records are admissible under HRE 
Rule 803(b)(6) when a custodian or qualified witness testifies ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
21 that the documents were incorporated and kept in the normal 
course of business, that the incorporating business typically 
relies upon the accuracy of the contents of the documents , and 
the circumstances otherwise indicate the trustworthiness of the 
document.  See id. ; Fitzwater, 122 Hawai i at 367-68, 227 P.3d at 
533-34. 
  Here, as in Mattos, the Lewis Declaration does not 
establish that the loan documents were received by Ocwen and 
then incorporated into Ocwe n’s records.  In addition , although 
Lewis averred that Ocwen’s records relating to the loan were 
made and maintained in the regular course of Ocwen’s business, 
Lewis asserted only that she had “access to and [was] familiar ” 
with Wells Fargo’s records and documents  relating to this case.  
(Emphasis added.)  The Lewis Declaration does not establish that 
Lewis was familiar with Wells Fargo’s  record-keeping system .  It 
also makes no assertions as to Lewis’s familiarity with the 
record-keeping systems of Funding Group or Option One, which 
first created the Note and allonges.  Thus, the Lewis 
Declaration satisfies  the foundational requirements to make 
Lewis a qualified witness only with respect to Ocwen’s original 
records about the loan and not any records of Wells Fargo or the 
loan documents themselves.  See Mattos , 140 Hawai ʻi at 32-33, 398 
P.3d at 621-22. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
22   The Lewis Declaration also refers  only to the Note and 
not the allonges that Wells Fargo asserts were used to endorse 
the Note in blank.  As noted, the Lewis Declaration does not 
establish that Lewis 
was a qualified witness,  and thus she could 
not have satisfied the requirements of HRE Rule 803(b)(6) with 
respect to the allonges.  But, as with the declaration in 
Mattos, the Lewis Declaration did not attempt to a
dmit the 
allonges under the business records exception.  See id.   Thus, 
even if the Note fell within the bounds of HRE Rule 803(b)(6), 
the allonges endorsing it in blank did not because the 
declaration did not provide the requisite foundation.   This is 
to say that the documents  purporting to a llow Wells Fargo to 
enforce the Note were  not admissible under the business record 
exception.  Since the documents were not admissible as asserted,  
Wells Fargo did not meet its burden of establishing facts 
necessary for a grant of summary judgment.  See id.   
  In sum, Lewis was not a qualified witness with respect 
to the documents attached to her d eclaration, and thus she c ould 
not provide the foundation to admit the m under HRE Rule 
803(b)(6).  The circuit court therefore erred in  granting 
summary judgment to the extent it relied on the documents’ 
admissibility under the business record exception to the hearsay 
rule. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
23 IV. CONCLUSION 
  
There is no bar to Behrendt challenging Wells Fargo ’s 
standing to foreclose on the Note, and Wells Fargo submitted no 
properly admitted evidence demonstrating that it was entitled to 
enforce the Note at the time the complaint was filed, 
as 
required by Reyes-Toledo
.  See Bank of Am. , N.A. v. Reyes-
Toledo, 139 Hawaiʻ i 361, 368, 390 P.3d 1248,  1255 (2017).  The 
circuit court thus erred in its grant of summary judgment in 
favor of Wells Fargo.  Accordingly, the circuit court’s  Order 
Granting Summary Judgment and the August 30, 2016 Judgment are 
vacated, and the case is remanded to the circuit court for 
further proceedings.
