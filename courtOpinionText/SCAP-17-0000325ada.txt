OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J. 
 
I.  Introduction 
 Dentons represents itself as the world’s largest law firm.  
Dentons US LLP maintains offices throughout the United States, 
including, as of July 2018, an office in Hawaiʻi comprising the Electronically Filed

 former partners (and other employees) of the former Hawai ʻi law 
firm Alston Hunt Floyd & Ing (“AHFI”) .  Prior to joining Dentons 
US LLP as partners, the AHFI partners incorporated themselves 
into separate lawyers ’ professional business organizations.  See  
Declaration of Paul Alston (“[T]he lawyers who were to become 
partners in Dentons US LLP form[ed] their own individual law 
corporations and ha[d] those corporations become partners in 
Dentons.”).   
 Dentons US LLP represents Defendant- Appellee CIT Bank in 
this appeal, through two former AHFI partners who are Hawai ʻi-
licensed.  During the course of the appeal, Dentons US LLP, 
through these two partners, filed a motion for admission pro hac 
vice of a California attorney with a different law firm.  
Counsel for Plaintiff- Appellant Stephanie Sheveland 
(“Sheveland”) opposed the motion, alleging that Dentons US L LP, 
as a firm, was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in 
Hawaiʻi, in violation of Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 605 -
14 (2016), which provides the following, in relevant part: 
It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, association, or 
corporation to engage in or to attempt to engage in or to 
offer to engage in the practice of law, or to do or attempt 
to do or offer to do any act constituting the practice of 
law, except and to the extent that the person, firm, or 
association is licensed or autho
rized so to do by an 
appropriate court, agency, or office or by a statute of the 
State or of the United States. . . .  
 
This court is the “appropriate court” authorizing the practice 
of law in this state.  See Haw. Const. art. VI, § 7 (“The **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
3 
 supreme court shall have power to promulgate rules and 
regulations in all civil and criminal cases for all courts 
relating to process, practice, procedure and appeals, which 
shall have the force and effect of law.”).  
 The specific court rule governing the organized practice of 
law in Hawai ʻi is Rule 6 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of 
Hawaiʻi (“RSCH”), titled “Lawyer’s Professional Business 
Organizations,” which provides, in relevant part, as follows:  
      (a) Compliance with this rule 
and applicable 
statutes. Any person or persons seeking to practice law as 
a corpor
ation, a company, an association, in partnership, 
or in some other lawful organizational form (hereafter, 
lawyers’ professional business organization) shall comply 
with the provisions of this rule and[,] if applicable[,] 
statutes. 
. . . . 
      (d) Shares; ownership and transfer.  
      (1) Sh
ares or interests in a lawyers’ professional 
business organization may be owned only by a lawyers’ 
professional business organization or by one or more 
persons licensed to practice law in this state by this 
court. . . .  
. . . . 
      (e)  Directors. Notwithstanding any statutory 
provisions, each director of a lawyers’ professional 
business organization shall be licensed to practice law in 
this state by this court. . . . 
      (f)  Officers. Notwithstanding statutory provisions, 
each officer of a lawyers’ professional business 
organization shall be licensed to practice law in this 
state by this court. . . .  
 
RSCH Rule 6 (2001).  Sheveland contends that the language of 
RSCH Rule 6 requires every partner of Dentons US LLP to be 
Hawaiʻi-licensed.  
Sheveland argues  that, without such a 
requirement, non-Hawai ʻi-licensed attorneys could direct the 
activities of Hawai ʻi-licensed attorneys in a Hawaiʻi firm **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
4 
 without regulation or oversight by this court or the Office of 
Disciplinary Counsel.  She asserts that Dentons US LLP is 
“majority owned by persons not licensed to practice law in 
Hawaiʻi,” in violation of the rule.   Sheveland asserts that the 
Hawai
ʻi-licensed att orneys appearing in this appeal “should be 
barred from stating or representing that they are practicing or 
appearing as part of ‘Dentons US LLP.’”    
 CIT Bank counter- argues that Sheveland’s interpretation of 
RSCH Rule 6 contradicts the rule’s plain text,  purpose, and 
history.  As to Rule 6(d)(1)’s plain language, CIT Bank asserts 
that shares or interests in a law firm can be owned either by 
another lawyer’s professional business organization or by one or 
more Hawai ʻi-licensed attorneys: 
(d) Shares; owners
hip and transfer.  
(1)  Shares or interests in a lawyers’ professional 
business organization may be owned only by a lawyers’ 
professional business organization or by one or more 
persons licensed to practice law in this state by this 
court. . . . 
 
CIT Bank points out that the “one or more persons” language 
allows a Hawai ʻi law firm to be owned by non
-Hawaiʻi-licensed 
attorneys and a minimum of one Hawaiʻi-licensed attorney.  Were 
the rule to require that only Hawaiʻi-licensed attorneys could 
own law firms practicing in Hawai ʻi, CIT Bank argues, the phrase 
“one or more” would have to be omitted from the rule.   
 CIT Bank next turns to the history of RSCH Rule 6.  CIT 
Bank argues that when the rule was first promulgated, there were **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
5 
 no express jurisdictional limitations contained in the statutes 
the rule referenced (namely, HRS Chapter 416, the Hawai ʻi 
Professional Corporation Law, and Chapter 605, the chapter 
governing attorney licensure in Hawai ʻi).  Instead, CIT Bank 
argues, the statutes “reflected an intent only to limit 
management and control of professional corporations to licensed 
individuals.”  CIT Bank also points out that the rule was not 
updated after the repeal of the Hawai ʻi Professional Corporation 
Law in 1987 and its replacement with the Professional 
Corporation Act.  The Professional Corporation Act expressly 
provided that corporate shares could be owned by anyone in the 
United States, its territories, and the District of Columbia.   
 CIT Bank further argues that Sheveland’s interpretation is 
inconsistent with other court rules that contemplate multi
-
jurisdictional law firm practice in Hawai ʻi.  CIT Bank cites to 
RSCH 11(b) (2016), which requires firms composed “in whole or in 
part
” by Hawaiʻ i-licensed attorneys to participate in the IOLTA 
program.  It also notes that Hawai ʻi Rules of Professional 
Conduct (“HRPC”) Rule 7.5 (2014) similarly permits multi -
jurisdictional law firm practice, as it requires Hawaiʻi law firm **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
6 
 letterheads to indicate which attorneys are not licensed to 
practice in Hawaiʻ i.1     
 CIT Bank also points out that this court’s ethical rules 
once prohibited Hawai ʻi law partnerships from including any 
person not licensed to practice law in Hawai ʻi.  See Hawaiʻi Code 
of Professional Responsibility (“HCPR”) Disciplinary Rule (“DR”) 
2-102(D) (“A partnership shall not include any person not 
licensed to practice law in the courts of the State of 
Hawaii.”); see also HCPR Ethical Consideration (“EC”) 2 -11 (“No 
partnership for the practice of law in the State of Hawaii may 
include a member who is not admitted to practice in the courts 
of the State of Hawaii.”) .  Over 30 years ago, however, those 
rules were deleted.  Lastly, CIT Bank asserts that statutes on 
similar subject matter, namely the licensure of Hawai ʻi 
professionals organized into corporations, do not limit 
ownership of corporate shares to just Hawai ʻi-licensed 
individuals.  See HRS § 415A-9(a) (2004) (“A professional 
corporation may issue shares . . . only to individuals 
authorized by law in this State or in any other state or 
territory of the United States or the District of Columbia to 
                     
1  CIT Bank also argues that Sheveland’s interpretation of RSCH Rule 6 
renders the rule unconstitutional under the United States Constitution’s 
Commerce Clause and Privileges and Immunities Clause.  As we dispose of the 
RSCH Rule 6 challenge using canons of interpretation, we do not address the 
constitutional issues.     **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
7 
 render a professional service permitted by the corporation’s 
articles of incorporation.” ) (emphasis added). 
 Amicus Curiae Federal National Mortgage Association 
(“FNMA”) filed a substantive joinder to CIT Bank’s reply brief.   
FNMA is represented by Carlsmith Ball, a multi- jurisdictional 
law firm with offices in Hawai ʻi a
nd California (and, in the 
past, Guam).  FNMA points out an inconsistency within RSCH Rule 
6:  amendments to the rule to expressly include law partnerships 
inadvertently retained jurisdictional limitations initially 
intended for law corporations.  FNMA submits that Carlsmith Ball 
was properly formed as a law partnership before this change to 
RSCH Rule 6 occurred.  FNMA posits that the rule change 
“inadvertently divested properly formed partnerships like 
Carlsmith Ball, which had partners licensed in other 
jurisdictions, of their legitimate business interests,” in 
violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment 
to the United States Constitution.  FNMA adds that it was 
“highly doubtful” that this court would have amended RSCH Rule 6 
in a manner exposing it to constitutional challenge .    
 This court issued an order granting Dentons US LLP’s motion 
for pro hac vice admission and stating that an opinion on the 
RSCH Rule 6 issue would be forthcoming.  This opinion now 
addresses the issue.  We hold that the following underlined 
portions of RSCH Rule 6 have been superseded, by implication, by **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
8 
 other rules of this court that  permit law firms composed of 
Hawaiʻi-licensed and non- Hawaiʻi-licensed attorneys to practice 
law in Hawaiʻ i, to mean “in this state or in any other state or 
territory of the United States or the District of Columbia” : 
(e)  Directors .  Notwithstanding any statutory provisions, 
each director of a lawyers’ professional business 
organization shall be licensed to practice law  in this 
state by this court .  A lawyers’ professional business 
organization that has only one shareholder need have only 
one director who shall be such shareholder.  
(f)  Officers .  Notwithstanding statutory provisions, each 
officer of a lawyers’ professional business organization 
shall be licensed to practice law  in this state by this 
court, except as provided in this subsection (f).
  If a 
lawyers’ pr ofessional business organization is incorporated 
with a single shareholder and a single director after July 
1, 1987, or if a lawyers’ professional business 
organization converts to having a single shareholder and a 
single director after that date, the person or persons 
holding the offices of secretary and treasurer need not be 
licensed.  If a lawyers’ professional business organization 
had a single shareholder and single director prior to July 
1, 1987, the person or persons holding the offices of vice -
president and secretary need not be licensed, in which 
event the offices of president and treasurer shall be held 
by the sole shareholder as previously required by this 
rule.  An unlicensed person, even if permitted to serve as 
an officer pursuant to this rule,  shall in no event serve 
as a director or be a shareholder of a lawyers’ 
professional business organization.  2
 
 
II.  Discussion 
 Upon closer inspection, the above- identified portions of 
RSCH Rule 6 have been impliedly superseded by other court rules 
governing the organized practice of law to mean “in this state 
or in any other state or territory of the United States or the 
                     
2  The continued need for the remainder of RSCH Rule 6 is not addressed at 
this time. 
 **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **

 District of Columbia.”   As will be discussed in further detail 
below, when the rule was first promulgated, it was clear that 
only Hawaiʻ i
-licensed attorneys could serve as partners or 
shareholders in Hawaiʻi law corporations.  Two years later, 
however, this court’s ethical rules governing the practice of 
law changed dramatically, to eliminate the requirement that only 
Hawaiʻi-licensed attorneys could serve as partners in Hawaiʻi law 
firms.  RSCH Rule 6, however, remained the same in all material 
respects.  This court went further to promulgate new rules that 
seemed to allow law firms practicing in Hawaiʻi to have non-
Hawaiʻi-licensed members, as long as these firms noted the 
jurisdictional limitations of these attorneys on their 
letterheads and firm listings (HRCP Rule 7.5) and contributed to 
the IOLTA program (RSCH Rule 11(b)).  (Even when related 
statutes changed to allow non- Hawaiʻi-licensed individuals to 
serve as shareholders, officers, directors, and partners within 
Hawaiʻi professional corporations and partnerships, RSCH Rule 6 
still remained materially unchanged.)  Thus, the above-
identified portions of RSCH Rule 6, which prohibit non-Hawaiʻi-
licensed attorneys from serving as directors or officers of 
Hawaiʻi law firms with a multi-jurisdictional presence, were 
repealed by implication by these related court rules.  As such, **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
10 
 RSCH Rule 6 does not prohibit Dentons US LLP from practicing law 
in Hawai ʻi through its Hawai ʻi-licensed attorneys. 
 
A.  RSCH Rule 6’s History 
 
RSCH 6 (initially numbered RSCH Rule 24) originated in a 
per curiam opinion of this court, Petition of the Bar 
Association of Hawaii, 55 Haw. 121, 516 P.2d 1267 (1973) (per  
curiam).  In that matter, the Hawai ʻi State Bar Ass
ociation 
petitioned this court to allow the incorporation of attorneys 
under the newly enacted Professional Corporation Act, then HRS 
§§ 416-141 through 154.  55 Haw. at 121, 516 P.2d at 1267-68.  
This court was aware that attorneys sought to establish law 
corporations to benefit from federal tax advantages, but it was 
concerned that the Bar Association’s proposed rule would limit 
malpractice liability of incorporated attorneys, contrary to the 
Uniform Partnership Act, the HCPR, and a state statute 
forbidding abridgment of the substantive rights of client-
litigants.  55 Haw. at 122, 516 P.2d at 1268.  This court 
therefore adopted the rule, then numbered RSCH Rule 24, 
governing Professional Corporations, which read, in relevant 
part, as follows: 
(b) Requirements for Issuance of Certificate of 
Registration.   The clerk shall issue a Certificate of 
Registration to such corporation if its application shows 
that:  
 (1)  The applicant is organized and exists pursuant 
 to Professional Corporation Law, HRS, Sections 416 -**  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
11 
  141 through 416 -154, and is a professional 
 corporation within the meaning of said law and 
 complies with all the requirements of said law and 
 this rule. 
 (2)  Each shareholder, director and officer of the 
applicant is licensed to practice law in this state 
by this court. . . .   
 
(c)  Shares; Ownership and Transfer.  
 (1)  Shares in a law corporation may be owned only by 
the corporation or by one or more persons licensed to 
practice law in this state by this court.   
 
. . . . 
(j)  Compliance with Law and Rules of Court.   A law 
corporation’s affairs shall be conducted in compliance with 
law and with the rules of this court.  It shall be subject 
to the applicable rules and regulations adopted by, and the 
disciplinary powers of, this court.  Nothing in this rule 
shall affect or impair the disciplinary powers of this 
court over any law corporation or over any person licensed 
to practice in this state by this court.  
 
RSCH Rule 24 (1979) (emphases added).  RSCH Rule 24 thus 
prohibited non-Hawai ʻi-licensed attorneys from serving as 
shareholders, directors, or officers of Hawaiʻi law corporations.  
 
Contemporaneous provisions of the HCPR and the HRS provide 
a fuller picture of the jurisdictional limitations on organized 
law practice at that time.  Between 1970 and 1981, HCPR DR 2-
102(D) stated, “A partnership shall not include any person not 
licensed to practice law in the courts of th e State of Hawaii.”  
EC 2-11 likewise provided, “No partnership for the practice of 
law in the State of Hawaii may include a member who is not 
admitted to practice in the courts of the State of Hawaii.”  
Similarly, HRS § 416- 146 (1976) required that “[s]ha res of 
capital in a professional corporation . . . be issued only to a 
licensed person. . . .” with “licensed person” referring to the 
attorney licensing provisions in HRS Chapter 605, which **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
12 
 pertained only to Hawai ʻi licensure by this court.  Thus, it 
seems clear that at that time, all law partners, shareholders, 
officers, and directors had to have been Hawaiʻi-licensed 
attorneys.   
 
B.   RSCH Rule 6’s Inconsistency with Related Court Rules  and 
 Statutes  
 
 Just two years following RSCH Rule 24’s adoption, h owever, 
inconsistencies between the rule and other court rules appeared.  
HCPR DR 2-102(D) and EC 2-11 were amended to delete the 
requirement that every partner in a law firm be licensed to 
practice law in Hawai ʻi.  The 1981 amendment to HCPR DR 2- 102(D) 
stated the following, which allowed, with conditions, Hawaiʻi law 
firm ownership by Hawaiʻi-licensed and non-Hawaiʻ i-licensed 
attorneys: 
A law firm shall not be formed or continued between or 
among lawyers licensed in different jurisdictions unless 
all enumerations of the partners, associates, and “of 
counsel” lawyers of the firm on its letterhead and in other 
permissible listings make clear the jurisdictional 
limitations on those partners, associates, and “of counsel” 
lawyers of the firm not licensed to practice in all listed 
jurisdictions.  
 
(Emphasis added.)3  Likewise, the 1981 amendment to EC 2- 11 
deleted the sentence, “No partnership for the practice of law in 
                     
3   In 1994, the HCPR was replaced by the Hawaiʻi Rules of Professional 
Conduct (“HRPC”); Rule 2 -102(D) was replaced with the “identical” HRPC Rule 
7.5(e), which provided the following, which, again, allowed, with conditions,  
law firms to be owned by non -Hawaiʻi-licensed and Hawaiʻi-licensed attorneys 
practicing in Hawaiʻ i: 
 
(continued. . .)  **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
13 
 the State of Hawaii may include a member who is not admitted to 
practice in the courts of the State of Hawaii.”  These changes 
to court rules are clearly inconsistent with the prohibitions 
within RSCH Rule 6 against non-Hawai ʻi-licensed att
orneys serving 
as directors or officers within Hawaiʻi law firms that have a 
multi-jurisdictional presence.  Where court rules conflict in 
this way, the later rules prevail.  
See, e.g., Bank of America 
v. Reyes-Toledo, 143 Hawaiʻi 249, 257, 428 P.3d 761, 769 (2018) 
(“[W]hen interpreting rules promulgated by the court, principles 
of statutory construction apply.”) (citations omitted); HRS § 1 -
9 (2009) (“The repeal of a law is . . . implied when the new law 
contains provisions contrary to, or irreconcilable with, those 
of the former law.”); Wahiawa Sugar Co. v. Waialua Agric.  Co., 
13 Haw. 109, 110, 1900 WL 2519, 1 (Haw. Terr. 1900) 
(acknowledging that “repeals by implication are not favored,” 
but, as between two versions of a statute that conflict, the 
latter must prevail over the former).  Although repeal or 
supersession of rules by implication is not favored, in this 
                                                                  
(continued. . .) 
A law firm shall not be formed or continued between or 
among lawyers licensed in different jurisdictions unless 
all enumerations of the partners, associates, and “of 
counsel” lawyers of the firm on its letterhead and in other 
permissible listings make clear the jurisdictional 
limitations on those partners, associates, and “of counsel” 
lawyers of the firm not licensed to practice in all listed 
jurisdictions.   
 
(Emphasis added.) 
 **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
14 
 case, the inconsistency between the changes to court rules and 
the relevant portions of RSCH Rule 6 is so clear, and there is 
no rational basis for harmonizing the inconsistencies, that 
supersession by implication exists.  See Fuentes v. Workers’ 
Comp. Appeals Bd., 16 Cal.3d 1, 7, 547 P.2d 449, 453 (1976) 
(“Repeals by implication are not favored, and are recognized 
only when there is no rational basis for harmonizing two 
potentially conflicting laws.”) .   
 RSCH Rule 6(e) and (f)4 also became inconsistent with 
related statutes governing professional corporations.  The 
Legislature replaced HRS Chapter 416 with Chapter 415A in 1985.  
1985 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 259 at 495-504.  Section 9(a) of the 
newly enacted chapter provided that non-Hawaiʻ i-licensed 
professionals could own shares in Hawaiʻi professional 
corporations or serve as partners alongside Hawaiʻi-licensed 
professionals: 
  A professional corporation may issues  shares, fractional  
  shares, and rights or options to purchase shares only to:  
 
 (1) Natural persons who are authorized by law in this  
  State or in any other state or territory of the United  
  States or the District of Columbia to render a    
  professional service permitted by the articles of   
  incorporation of the corporation; and  
  (2) General partnerships in which all the partners are  
  qualified persons with respect to such professional   
  corporation and in which at least one partner is   
  a uthorized by law in this State to render a    
  professional service permitted by the articles of   
  incorporation of the corporation.  
 
                     
4  RSCH Rule 24 was renumbered RSCH Rule 6 in 1984.  
 **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
15 
 1985 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 259 § 9 at 497- 98 (emphases added).5, 6   
 In September 1987, prompted by the repeal of HRS 
Chapter 
416 (the Hawai ʻi Professional Corporation Law) and its 
replacement by HRS Chapter 415A (the Hawaiʻi Professional 
Corporation Act), RSCH Rule 6 was extensively amended, more 
closely resembling, sub- section by sub-section, the rule in 
place today: 
 (a) Compliance with this Rule and the Hawaii 
Professional Corporation Act.   Any person or persons 
seeking to practice law as a corporation shall comply with 
the provisions of this rule and the Hawaii Professional 
Corporation Act, HRS Chapter 415A.  
. . . . 
 
 
                     
5  Very shortly afterward, the first provision was amended to allow 
corporations to issue shares, fractional shares, and rights of options 
to purchase shares only to “individuals,” instead of “natural persons,” 
“authorized by law in this State or in any other  state or territory of 
the United States or the District of Columbia to render a professional 
service permitted by the corporation’s articles of incorporation.”  
1987 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 135, § 115 at 271.  The legislature deleted 
the second provision regarding general partnerships owning shares where 
at least one partner is authorized by law in this State.  Id.     
 
6  Section 9(b) of the newly enacted chapter also provided, however, that 
a “licensing authority for any profession,” such as this court over the legal 
profession, can “further restrict, condition, or abridge the authority of 
professional corporations to issue shares” where it is deemed “necessary . . 
. to prevent violations of the ethical standards of such profession. . . .”  
1985 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 259 § 9 at 498.  As such, this provision, codified 
as HRS § 415A- 9(b), recognizes the inherent authority of this court to 
regulate the practice of law.  
See In re Ellis , 53 Haw. 23, 25 n.1, 487 P.2d 
286, 287 n.1 (1971) (“This court has inherent powe r to regulate matters 
before it regarding the practice of law.”) (quoting Hawaiʻi Constitution, 
article V, section 1, which vests judicial power in the courts).  Thus, 
section 9(b) does not purport to affect this court’s authority to prohibit 
non-Hawaiʻi-licensed attorneys from serving as directors or officers of 
Hawaiʻi law firms with a multi -jurisdictional presence.  As we have already 
noted, however, it appears that this court’s later -enacted rules 
contemplating multi- jurisdictional law practice in Hawaiʻi repealed, by 
implication, those parts of RSCH Rule 6(e) and (f) prohibiting non -Hawaiʻi-
licensed attorneys from serving as officers and directors of Hawaiʻi law 
firms. **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **  
 
16 
  (d) Shares; Ownership and T
ransfer. 
  (1)  Shares in a law corporation may be owned 
only by the corporation or by one or more persons licensed 
to practice law in this state by this court. . . .  
. . . . 
 (e) Directors.   Notwithstanding the provisions of HRS 
§ 415A-14, each director of a law corporation shall be 
licensed to practice law in this state by this court. . . .  
. . . . 
 (f) Officers.   Notwithstanding the provisions of HRS 
§ 415A-14, each officer of a law corporation shall be 
licensed to practice law in this state by this court. . . .  
. . . . 
 (h)  Compliance with Law and Rules of Court.   A law 
corporation’s affairs shall be conducted in compliance with 
law and with the rules of this court.  It shall be subject 
to the applicable rules and regulations adopted by, and all 
the disciplinary powers of, this court.  Nothing in this 
rule shall affect or impair the disciplinary powers of this 
court over any law corporation or over any person licensed 
to practice in this state by this court.  
 
RSCH Rule 6 (1987). 
 As argued by CIT Bank, the plain language of RSCH Rule 6(d) 
appears to allow Dentons to practice law in Hawaiʻi as a lawyers’ 
professional business organization.  RSCH Rule 6(d)(1) states, 
in relevant part, “ Shares or interests in a lawyers’ 
professional business organization may be owned only by a

. .”  Contrary to Sheveland’s assertion, the word “only” 
modifies the two forms of share ownership that are allowed:  
one, by a lawyer’s professional business organization,  or two, 
by “one or more persons licensed to practice law in this state 
by this court. . . .”  According to Paul Alston, Dentons US LLP  
is owned in part by individual Hawai ʻi-licensed attorneys 
formerly from AHFI who have individually incorporated as each’ s **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **

 own lawyer’s professional business organization.  See 
Declaration of Alston (“It was further determined that any 
concerns about RSC[H] 6 could also be addressed by having the 
lawyers who were to become partners in Dentons US LLP form their 
own individual law corporations and have those corporations 
become partners in Dentons.  In that way, consistent with the 
language of RSC[H] 6, the interests in Dentons US LLP (a 
“lawyer’s professional business organization”) are owned by 
other “lawyer
s’ professional bu siness organizations” – i.e., our 
individual law corporations.”) .  Thus, Dentons US LLP shares or 
interests, owned by each former AHFI partner’s lawyer’s 
professional business organization, satisfies RSCH Rule 6(d)(1). 
 Even if the former AHFI partners who are now Dentons US LLP 
partners are viewed as individuals instead of law corporations, 
there is still no violation of RSCH Rule 6(d)(1), as Dentons US 
LLP would be owned “by one or more persons licensed to practice 
law in this state by this court. . . .”  This is because shares 
or interests in Dentons US LLP are owned by one or more Hawai ʻi-
licensed attorneys:  the former AHFI partners.  
Thus, RSCH Rule 
6 is no impediment to the former AHFI partners’ practice of law 
in Hawaiʻ i as part of Dentons US LLP.7 
                     
7  Even after the amendments to court rules authorizing law practice 
ownership by non- Hawaiʻi-licensed and Hawaiʻi-licensed attorneys, the 
provisions of RSCH Rule 6 currently at issue remained substantively unchanged 
for over three decades.  During this period, RSCH Rule 6 was amended multiple

  C.  Concerns about the Conduct of non-Hawaiʻ i-Licensed Attorneys 
 within Hawaiʻ i  Lawyers’ Professional Business Organizations  
 
 Finally, w e also address Sheveland’s concern that non -
Hawaiʻi-licensed attorneys, in Hawai ʻi firms with a multi-
jurisdictional presence, may direct the conduct of Hawaiʻi-
licensed attorneys in a manner free from oversight by this court 
or the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.  For the following 
                                                                  
(continued. . .) 
times, but never to account for the changing regulatory landscape surrounding 
organized law practice in Hawai ʻi.  First, in 1995, RSCH Rule 6(a) was amended 
to include organized law practice in the form of partnerships, as follows 
(with new material underscored):  
 
(a)  Compliance With this Rule and Either the Hawaiʻ i 
Professional Corporation Act or the Hawai ʻi Partnership Act.  
Any person or persons seeking to practice law as a 
corporation or in partnership shall comply with the 
provisions of this rule and 
either the Hawaiʻ i Professional 
Corporation 
Act, HRS Chapter 415A, or the Hawaiʻ i 
Partnership Act, HRS Chapter 425 or both, if applicable . 
 
(We note that, despite the express addition of “partnership” as an 
organizational form for law practice, Rule 6(d)(1), (e), and (f) still 
referred to only the corporate concepts of shares, directors, and officers, 
and not partnership concepts.)    
 Second, in 1999, RSCH Rule 6 was amended to introduce the term 
“lawyer’s professional business organization” to cover law practiced in the 
form of a “corporation, a company, an association,” or a “partnership.”  RSCH 
Rule 6(a) was also amended to require compliance with the rest of the 
provisions of RSCH Rule 6 as well as “any applicable statutes,” instead of 
expressly referencing HRS Chapters 415A and 425 (governing corporations and 
partnerships, respectively) as it once had.   
 Lastly, in 2001, RSCH Rule 6(d)(1) was amended slightly to delete the 
bracketed “the” and replace it with the underscored “a”, as follows: “Shares 
or interests in a lawyer’s professional busines s organization may be owned 
only by [the] a lawyer’s professional business organization or by one or more 
persons licensed to practice law in this state by this court. . . .”  RSCH 
Rule 6 has not changed since this 2001 amendment.   
 The relevant portions of RSCH Rule 6 (e) and (f) did not appropriately 
evolve in response to dramatic changes to related court rules contemplating 
the inclusion of non- Hawaiʻi-licensed attorneys in Hawai ʻi lawyers’ 
professional business organizations with a multi -jurisdictional presence.  
Thus, for the reasons stated in this opinion, RSCH Rule 6 is no impediment to 
the former AHFI partners’ practice of law in Hawai ʻi as part of Dentons US 
LLP.

 reasons, HRS § 605- 14 would still prohibit non-Hawai ʻi-licensed 
attorneys from doing so within this jurisdiction.  
 
 Fought & Co. v. Steel Eng’g and Erection, Inc. , 87 Hawai ʻi 
37, 951 P.2d 487 (1998), is instructive on this issue.  In that 
case, the Department of Transportation withheld payment for a 
Kahului Airport construction project from a general contractor, 
who, in turn, withheld payment from its subcontractor, who, in 
turn, withheld payment from its subcontractor, Fought & Co. 
(“Fought”), a company headquartered in Oregon, which employed 
Oregon-licensed general counsel.  87 Hawai ʻi at 41-42, 43, 951 
P.2d at 491-92, 493.  Fought initiated a contract action in 
Hawaiʻi through Hawaiʻi-licensed local counsel, who filed all 
briefs and made all court appearances in Hawaiʻi courts.  87 
Hawaiʻi at 44-45, 48, 951 P.2d at 494-95, 498.  Fought’s gen eral 
counsel assisted local counsel by preparing the company’s 
statement of position in anticipation of mediation, consulting 
and strategizing on the appeal, conducting legal research and 
reviewing the briefing of local counsel and other parties to the 
litigation, and resolving issues pertaining to the posting of 
another party’s supersedeas bond.  87 Hawai ʻi at 46, 951 P.2d at 
496.  While we concluded Fought’s general counsel was indeed 
engaged in the practice of law, we held that it was not the **  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  **

 “unauthorized practice of law” because it did not take place 
within this jurisdiction.  Id.     
 We reasoned that Fought’s general counsel represent ed an 
Oregon corporation, rendered all legal services in Oregon, did 
not draft or sign any of the court filings, did not appear in 
Hawaiʻi courts, a
nd did not communicate with counsel for other 
parties on Fought’s behalf.  87 Hawaiʻi at 48, 951 P.2d at 498.  
In sum, we concluded that Fought’s general counsel’s “role was 
strictly one of consultant to Fought and Fought’s Hawaiʻi 
counsel.”  Id.  We emphasized that “Fought’s Hawai ʻi counsel were 
at all times ‘in charge’ of Fought’s representation within the 
jurisdiction so as to insure that Hawaiʻi law was correctly 
interpreted and applied.”  Id.  Non-Hawaiʻi-licensed attorneys 
within Dentons US LLP must comply with HRS § 605-14 and Fought .     
 
III.  Conclusion 
 We hold that the portions of RSCH Rule 6 identified in 
Section I have been superseded by implication to mean “in this 
state or in any other state or territory of the United States or

partners’ practice of law in Hawai ʻi as part of Dentons US LLP.
