OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J.  
  This case is a consolidated appeal from twenty- nine 
General Excise Tax assessments levied by the Director of 
Taxation of the State of Hawai i against
 five online travel 
companies based on car rental transactions that took place in 
Hawaii between January 1, 2000,  and December 31, 2013.   The Electronically Filed

2 online travel companies contend that the majority of the 
assessments are barred because they have already litigated their 
General Excise Tax liability for the years in question to final 
judgment in a previous case.  They further argue that the rental 
car transactions should qualify for a reduced General Excise Tax 
rate that is calculated based only on the portion of the 
proceeds that they re tain because rental cars are “tourism 
related services” within the meaning of a statutory income -
reducing provision.  The Director of Taxation of the State of 
Hawai‘i responds that the State cannot be estopped from 
collecting taxes it is legally owed based on a previous 
litigation and that the rental car transactions must be taxed at 
the full rate because no income -reducing provision applies. 
  We hold on review that, because our precedent does not 
permit the actions of a specific  government official to impede 
the fundamental sovereign power of taxation, the assessments are 
not barred and may be considered on the merits.  We further hold 
that rental cars are tourism related services and the assessed 
transactions qualify for the reduced General Excise Tax rate 
based only on the portion of the proceeds that the online travel 
companies retained.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
3 I. BACKGROUND 
A. The OTCs ’ Business Model 
 
 The taxpayers in this case are five online travel 
companies1 (the “OTCs”) that provide services similar to those of 
a traditional travel agent through their respective public 
websites.2  The OTCs maintain databases of up- to-date information 
about travel- related services offered by third- party providers, 
including airline flights  and car and hotel rentals.  Travele rs 
accessing the websites  can view availability and price data for  
services associated with a destination and make reservations 
through the OTCs rather than contacting service providers 
directly.  The OTCs negotiate and contract with service 
providers to secure reduced pricing in exchange for providing 
                     
 1 The parties to this appeal and cross -appeal include 
Priceline.com, Inc. (n/k/a The Priceline Group, Inc.); Expedia, Inc.; 
Hotwire, Inc.; Orbitz, LLC; and Trip Network, Inc. (d/b/a Cheaptickets.com).  
Before the tax court,  the consolidated tax appeal also included Hotels.com, 
L.P.; Internetwork Publishing Corp. (d/b/a Lodging.com); Travelweb LLC; 
Travelocity.com LP (n/k/a TVL LP); and Site59.com, LLC.  The tax assessments 
levied against Travelocity.com LP (n/k/a TVL LP) and  Site59.com, LLC were 
resolved out of court, and the appeal was dismissed with prejudice by 
stipulation on November 29, 2016.  The tax court entered judgment in favor of 
Hotels.com, L.P.; Internetwork Publishing Corp. (d/b/a Lodging.com); and 
Travelweb LLC in the stipulated final judgment filed April 25, 2017, and no 
party has appealed this portion of the ruling.   
  No OTC that was a party to any stage of the proceedings in this 
case was headquartered or had a principal place of business in the State of 
Hawaii. 
 2 Some of the OTCs also operate call centers and process 
transactions over the telephone using a substantially identical business 
model. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
4 global marketing and supplying a  mechanism for connecting 
customers with excess inventory. 
  
In the transactions at issue in this case, the  OTCs 
utilized a business method called the “merchant model.”   In a 
merchant model transaction, a customer make s a single payment to 
an OTC for all purchased services at the time of the 
reservation--typically as 
a credit card charge processed through 
the OTC’s website.  The OTC appear s as the merchant of record 
for the credit card transaction.  This payment--called the 
“gross income” or “gross receipts” --includes at least two 
components: the base price for services set by contract between 
the OTCs and service providers
, which the OTCs 
remit to the 
service providers, and an amount that the OTCs retain as 
compensation for facilitating the transaction.   See Hawaii 543
                     
 3 The OTCs also employ the “agency” or “retail” model of 
transaction, in which customers make reservations thr ough the OTCs’ websites 
and make payment directly to the service provider at the time of service.  
The service provider then forwards a portion of the proceeds to the OTC as a 
commission for facilitating the transaction.  The Director of Taxation of the 
State of Hawai‘ i has issued separate tax assessments to the OTCs based on 
their agency- model transactions in the tax years at issue in this case, but 
the OTCs are not challenging these assessments in this appeal.  
 4 The briefs refer to this base price of the service as the “net 
rate.”  Because “net” may alternatively refer to the amount the OTCs retain 
after all expenses, see  Net, Black’s Law Dictionary  (10th ed. 2014), this 
opinion instead uses the term “base rate.”  
 5 The briefs alternatively refer to this amount as a “service fee,” 
“facilitation fee,” “mark -up,” and “margin,” and sometimes characterize it as 
representing separate charges for facilitating the initial transaction and 
for providing ongoing customer service related to the reservation.  Any 
distinction in the compensation retained by the OTCs is not relevant to this 
appeal, and this Opinion refers to the full amount collectively.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
5 Revised Statutes (HRS) § 237- 3 (2017) (defining “gross income”).  
Some of the transactions at issue in this case also included a 
“tax recovery” charge representing the estimated amount of taxes 
the service providers would pay on the transaction, which the 
OTCs also forwarded to the service  providers.6  No component of 
the gross income is explicitly designated to satisfy  the OTCs’ 
own tax obligations. 
  
The OTCs do not disclose the total amount of gross 
income collected in each transaction to service providers and do 
not inform customers  of the separate cost of each component of 
the payment.  Consequently, only the OTCs know how much money 
they retain in each 
merchant model transaction. 
  With respect to vehicle  rentals, merchant model 
transactions are further divided into package and stand- alone 
transactions.  In package transactions, customers purchase 
multiple travel- related services simultaneously through the OTCs 
for a single payment.  A customer may reserve  an airline ticket 
or hotel room at the same time as a rental vehicle , for 
instance.  The OTCs separate the base rate for each included 
service and forward t hat amount to  the appropriate service 
provider.  A stand- alone transaction, by contrast,  involves only 
                     
 6 In those transactions that did not include a tax recovery fee, 
customers typically paid applicable taxes, fees, and surcharges directly to 
the service provider at the time of the service.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
6 a rental vehicle reservation from a single service provider.   
All of the OTCs engaged in package transactions during the years 
at issue in this case, but only Priceline.com, Inc. and Hotwire, 
Inc. also offered stand-alone car rentals as a standard business 
practice.7 
B. The 2015 Travelocity Case 
  Prior to 2011, the OTCs filed no tax returns with and 
paid no taxes to the State of Hawai i on merchant-model 
transactions that resulted in the purchase of services rendered 
within the State.  See Travelocity.com, L.P. v. Dir. of 
Taxation, 135 Hawaii 88, 95-96, 346 P.3d 157, 164- 65 (2015).  In 
2011 and 2012, the Director of Taxation of the State of Hawaii 
(the Director) issued two sets of “Notice[s] of Final Assessment 
of Additional General Excise And/Or Use Tax” to each OTC .  See 
id. at 93, 346 P.3d at 162.  The Director retroactively assessed 
the OTCs for unpaid General Excise Tax (GET)  on the gross income  98
                     
 7 Although a majority of the OTCs generally do not offer stand -
alone car rentals, the evidence indicates that stand- alone transactions 
accounted for approximately two -thirds of bookings in all assessed merchant 
car rentals by revenue and volume.  
 8 The final assessment represents the culmination of an 
administrative procedure in which a taxpayer is first informed of a proposed 
assessment and given an opportunity to file an administrative protest before 
the assessment is finalized.  See generally  Matter of Simpson Manor, Inc., 57 
Haw. 1, 7, 548 P.2d 246, 250 (1976) (describing the procedure as it relates 
to due process).  
 9 As discussed in greater detail below, the GET is a tax assessed 
“based on the privilege or activity of doing business within the State and 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
7 from transactions from 1999 to 2011 that resulted in hotel room 
rentals within the State of Hawai i, as well as interest and 
penalties for failing to file and non
-payment.   Id. at 92, 346 
P.3d at 161. 10
  The OTCs appealed the assessments to the tax court, 
arguing, inter alia, that they were not subject to GET because 
their business activities did not take place in Hawai i as the 
authorizing statute
 required.  Id. at 98-99 , 116, 346 P.3d at 
168-69, 185 (citing HRS § 237-13 (Supp. 1999) ).  On August 15, 11

not on the fact of domicile.”  Travelocity, 135 Hawai i at 103, 346 P.3d at 
172 (quoting Matter of Grayco Land Escrow, Ltd., 57 Haw. 436, 447, 559 P.2d 
264, 272 (1977)).  It is imposed on gross income derived from, inter alia
, 
“any service business” within the State that is not exempted or otherwise 
provided for in the authorizing statute.  Id.  at 97, 346 P.3d at 166 (quoting 
HRS § 237- 13 (Supp. 1999)).  The “inherent pervasiveness” of the tax is 
mitigated by a number of income -reducing provisions specifying that certain 
classes of transactions are untaxed or taxed on a value less than the gross 
income derived from the transaction.  Id. at 106, 346 P.3d at 175 (quoting 
Matter of Tax Appeal of Cent. Union Church
--Arcadia Ret. Residence, 63 Haw. 
199, 202, 624 P.2d 1346, 1349 (1981)).  
 10 The Director also assessed Travel Accommodations Tax (TAT) and 
associated interest and penalties on the transactions.  Travelocity, 135 
Hawaii at 93, 346 P.3d at 162.  The TAT is a tax imposed on the gross rental 
proceeds derived by “operators” of short -term “transient accommodations” 
including hotels.  Id.  at 119
-20, 346 P.3d at 188 -89 (citing HRS § 237 –2 
(Supp. 1998)).  The OTCs appealed the assessments, and the tax court found 
that the OTCs were not “operators” subject to TAT under the authorizing 
statute.  Id. at 127, 346 P.3d at 196.  On review, this court agreed.  Id.  
 11 HRS § 237 -13 provides in relevant part: 
There is hereby levied and shall be assessed and collected 
annually privilege taxes against persons on account of 
their business and other activities in the State measured 
by the application of rates against values of products, 
gross proceeds of sales, or gross income, whichever is 
specified, as follows:

8 2013, the tax court entered final judgment finding the OTCs 
liable for the full amount of the assessed GET .  Id. at 92, 346 
P.3d at 161.  The Director and OTCs filed cross appeals, and 
this court granted transfer.  Order, Travelocity.com, LP v. Dir. 
of Taxation, No. SCAP-13-0002896, 2013 WL 6822079 (Haw. Dec. 24, 
2013). 
  On March 17, 2015, this court issued an opinion 
affirming in part and vacating in part the tax court’s final 
judgment.  Travelocity, 135 Hawai i at 127, 346 P.3d at 196.
  The 
court first determined that the OTCs ’ merchant hotel room 
transactions constituted “sufficient ‘business and other 
activities in the State’ to impose the GET” because the OTCs 
actively solicited and contracted with Hawai i hotels and Hawai i 
consumers to profit from the sale of occupancy rights that were 
wholly exercised in Hawai i.  Id. at 105, 346 P.3d at 174 
(quoting HRS § 237- 13). 
                                                                        
(. . . continued) 
 
. . . . 
(6) Tax on service business.  
 (A) Upon every person engaging or continuing within 
the State in any service business or calling including 
professional services not otherwise specifically taxed 
under this chapter, there is likewise hereby levied and 
shall be assessed and collected a tax equal to four per 
cent of the gross income of the business . . . .  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
9   The court went on to hold , however, that the assessed 
transactions qualified for GET apportionment under a related 
statutory provision because the rented hotel rooms were 
“transient accommodations . . . furnished through arrangements 
made by a travel agency . . . at noncommissioned negotiated 
contract rates” for which the “gross income [was] divided 
between the operator of transient accommodations . . . and the 
travel agency.”  Id. at 106, 113, 346 P.3d at 175, 182 (quoting 
12HRS § 237-18(g) (1993)
 (emphasis omitted)).   Accordingly, the 
court held that the OTCs were liable for GET and associated 
interest and penalties ba sed on only the amounts they retained 
from the assessed transactions and not the gross income.  Id.  at 
113, 346 P.3d at 182. 
  The court therefore remanded the case to the tax court 
to make a final determination of each OTC ’s GET liability under 
the ruling.  Id. at 127, 346 P.3d at 196.  The tax court entered 
                     
 12 HRS § 237 -18(g) provides in full:  
Where transient accommodations are furnished through 
arrangements made by a travel agency or tour packager at 
noncommissioned negotiated contract rates and the gross 
income is divided between the operator of transient 
accommodations on the one hand and the travel agency or 
tour packager on the other hand, the tax  imposed by this 
chapter shall apply to each such person with respect to 
such person’s respective portion of the proceeds, and no 
more. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
10 a set of Stipulated Final Judgments on Remand on September 21, 
2015, establishing each OTC’s GET liability.  
C. The Present Case 
  
On December 9, 2013, while the cross- appeals of the 
tax court’ s initial judgment in Travelocity were pending, the 
Director issued a new set of “Notice[s] of Final Assessment of 
Additional General Excise And/Or Use Tax” based on the gross 
income from the OTCs’ merchant renta l car transactions from 2000 
to 2012.   This was followed on July 18, 2014, by an additional 
set of GET assessments based on the gross income  from the OTCs’ 
2013 merchant rental car transactions.  1413
1. The Tax Court Proceedings 
  Upon receiving the merchant rental car GET 
assessments, the OTCs filed timely notices of appeal to the tax 
court.  The appeals were consolidated, and prior to trial the 
Director and OTCs filed cross- motions for partial summary 
judgment.   
                     
 13 The OTCs filed timely administrative protests for all of the 
assessments at issue in this case.  
 14 The 2013 assessmen ts also included GET and TAT on the OTCs’ 
merchant hotel room rental transactions.  Following this court’s decision in 
Travelocity, 135 Hawai i at 127, 346 P.3d at 196, the TAT assessments were 
canceled by stipulation.  The 2013 merchant hotel room rentals ’ GET 
assessments are also not at issue in this appeal.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
11 a. The Director’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment  
  
On May 9, 2016, the Director filed a motion seeking  a 
ruling that the OTCs were liable for GET on the gross income 
from all merchant rental car transactions in the State of Hawai i 
from 2000 to 2013, as well as interest and penalties for failing 
to file and non-payment.  The Director first contend ed that, 
under our precedents, the assessment of taxes, penalties, and 
interest are presumed correct, making it the OTCs ’ burden to 
disprove the accuracy of the challenged assessments.  (Citing 
Travelocity, 135 Hawai i at 114 -15, 346 P.3d at 1 83-84.)  The 
Director then argued that Travelocity was dispositive as to the 
GET’s applicability to the OTCs’  merchant rental car 
transactions because the rentals constituted business and other 
activities in Hawaii under HRS § 237- 13 in the same manner as 
the OTCs’ merchant hotel room rentals.   (Citing 135 Hawaii at 
103-05, 346 P.3d at 172-74.)   
  Anticipating the OTCs ’ counter- argument  based on their 
earlier administrative protests, the Director assert ed that no 
income-reducing provision applied to the merchant rental car 
transactions.  Specifically, the Director argued that “the 
income-reducing provision in HRS § 237- 18(f)15 that applies to 
                     
 15 HRS § 237 -18(f) provides in full  as follows: 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
12 ‘tourism related services’ simply does not encompass”  the 
merchant rental car transactions based on legislative history 
and principles of statutory construction.   
  
Lastly, the Director argued that the OTCs a re subject 
to penalties under HRS § 231-39(b)16 for their undisputed failure 
                                                                        
(. . . continued) 
 
Where tourism related services are furnished through 
arrangements made by a travel agency or tour packager and 
the gross income is divided between the provider of the 
services and the travel agency or tour packager, the tax 
imposed by this chapter shall apply to each such person 
with respect to such person’s respective portion of the 
proceeds, and no more.  
As used in this subsection “tourism related services” means 
catamaran cruises, canoe rides, dinner cruises, lei 
greetings, transportation included in a tour package, 
sightseeing tours not subject to chapter 239, admissions to 
luaus, dinner shows, extravaganzas, cultural and 
educational facilities, and other services rendered 
directly to the customer or tourist, but only if the 
providers of the services other than air transportation are 
subject to a four per cent tax under this chapter or 
chapter 239.  
 16 HRS § 231 -39(b) (2017) provides in relevant part  as follows: 
(b) There shall be added to and become a part of the tax 
imposed by such tax or revenue law, and collected as such:  
(1) Failure to file tax return.  In case of failure 
to file any tax return required to be filed on the 
date prescribed therefor (determined with regard to 
any extension of time for filing), unless it is shown 
that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not 
due to neglect, there shall be added to the amount 
required to be shown as tax on the return five per 
cent of the amount of the tax if the failure is for 
not more than one month, with an additional five per 
cent for each additional month or fraction thereof 
during which the failure continues, not exceeding 
twenty-five per cent in the aggregate. . . .  
(2) Failure to pay tax.  
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
13 to file returns or pay GET on their merchant rental car 
transactions because they had not demonstrated the failure was 
“due to reasonable cause and not due to neglect.”  ( Citing 
Travelocity, 135 Hawai i at 113, 346 P.3d at 182.)   
  On July 26, 2016, the OTCs filed an opposition to the 
Director’s motion for partial summary judgment.   Directing the 
court to their own cross- motion for partial summary judgment, 
discussed below, the OTCs argued that the assessments for tax 
years 2000 to 2011 were barred under the doctrine of res 
judicata due to GET liability for those years having been 
litigated to final judgment in Travelocity.   
  The OTCs then contended that the Director had 
misapprehended this court’s statements in Travelocity  about the 
presumption of a tax assessment’s correctness; only the 
calculation of the amount of tax owed is presumed correct, the 
OTCs asserted, and questions of law regarding  application of a 
tax are reviewed de novo. (Citing 135 Hawai i  at 114, 346 P.3d at
183.)  The OTCs pointed out that our precedents indicate tax  
                                                                        
(. . . continued) 
 
(A) If any part of any underpayment is due to 
negligence or intentional disregard of rules 
(but without intent to defraud), there shall be 
added to the tax an amount up to twenty -five 
per cent of the underpayment as determined by 
the director. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
14 statutes should be interpreted strictly with ambiguity resolved 
in favor of the taxpayer.  (Citing In re Fasi, 63 Haw. 624, 629, 
634 P.2d 98, 103 (1981).)   
  The OTCs then argued that the assessments should be 
vacated because they failed to apply the GET apportioning 
provision for “tourism  related services ” under HRS § 237 -18(f).  
The OTCs asserted that vehicle rentals fall squarely within the 
conventional conception of tourism related services and disputed 
the Director’s interpretation of legislative history and 
application of statutory construction
 principles.  Lastly, the 
OTCs argued that genuine issues of material fact existed as to 
which OTCs filed or paid  GET during the years in question, and  
the determination of penalties should therefore be deferred 
until after the resolution of the partial summary judgment 
motions.   
b. The OTCs’ Cross -Motion for Partial Summary Judgment 
  
On July 7, 2016, the OTCs filed a motion seeking a 
judgment that the GET assessments covering 2000 through 2011 
were barred by res judicata because the Director had previously 
assessed and litigated 
the OTCs’ GET liability for those years 
to final judgment in Travelocity.   
Relying on a range of 17
                     
 17 The OTCs also  contended that the assessments should be vacated 
for failing to apply GET apportionment, utilizing arguments substantially 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
15 federal cases, the OTCs argued that established “hornbook 
principles” of law  make clear that a taxpayer’s liability for a 
single type of tax during  a single tax year gives rise to a 
single cause of action.  The OTCs contended the doctrine of res 
judicata should therefore bar all claims or defenses that were 
brought or could have been  brought in the previous proceeding to 
establish their GET liability.   
  The OTCs further argued that the Director was aware of 
and could have included the merchant car rental transactions in 
the first action, pointing to the assessed hotel room 
transactions in Travelocity that also included a car rental as 
part of the purchased package.  Public policy also weighed in 
favor of applying res judicata , the OTCs concluded, because the 
doctrine serves to promote finality, relieve parties of the cost 
of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and encourage 
reliance by preventing inconsistent decisions.   
  On July 26, 2016, the Director filed an opposition to 
the OTCs’ cross -motion for partial summary judgment.  The 
Director argued that the OTCs’ res judicata argument fails 
because the OTCs did not file GET returns and Hawai i tax 
                                                                        
(. . . continued) 
 
identical to those included in the OTCs’ opposition to the Director’s motion 
for partial summary judgment.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
16 statutes treat non-filers in “a different and more punitive 
manner than taxpayers who file returns.”  Applying res judicata 
would encourage tax fraud, the Director continued, 
by requiring 
the Director to guess what undisclosed business activities a 
non-filer has conducted in Hawai i.  The Director further pointed 
out that article VII, section 1 of the Hawaii Constitution 
prohibits the surrender or suspension of the taxing power, and 
that this court has held that estoppel defenses do not apply to 
the fundamental sovereign power of taxation.  (Citing Dir. Of 
Taxation v. Med. Underwriters of Cal., 115  Hawaii 180, 194, 166 
P.3d 353, 367 (2007).)   
  Additionally, the  Director asserted that no Hawaii 
court had ever recognized res judicata as a defense to taxation 
and that the OTCs had not met the technical requirements of the 
doctrine as applied by Hawai i courts in any event .  Lastly, the 
Director argued that even if res judicata was an available 
defense under the circumstances, summary judgment was 
inappropriate because genuine issues of material fact existed as 
to whether the Director knew about the OTCs ’ merchant rental car 
transactions at the time of Travelocity and thus could have 
included them in the prior proceeding.   
  The Director’s opposition also included a number of 
additional arguments that the merchant rental car transactions ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
17 did not qualify as “tourism  related services” for GET 
apportionment under HRS § 237- 18(f).  Most notably, the Director 
contended that certain types of rental car transactions could 
not be characterized as tourism related services under any 
definition of the term, including rentals to Hawai i residents 
whose vehicles have broken down or to business persons traveling 
to the State or among the islands for only business purposes. 
c. Hearing and the Tax Court’s Ruling  
  The tax court held a joint hearing on the cross-
motions on August 5, 2016.  At the hearing, the tax court 
expressed “legitimate concern about how many times the taxpayers 
are going to have to come back to . . . defend general excise 
tax issues” and stated that “there’ s very little dispute that 
people in the world, including the tax director in Hawaii, knew 
that car rental services were part of the services that these 
online travel companies offered” prior to Travelocity .  The 
court found, however, that this did not equate to knowledge of 
“actionable conduct” by the OTCs on which additional GET could 
be assessed.  Because Travelocity and the present case were 
initiated through separate assessments based on “completely 
different activity giving rise to the alleged tax liability,” 
the court found that the present action was not barred by res 
judicata.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
18   Turning to whether the HRS § 237- 18(f) apportioning 
provision applied, the court found that the primary commonality 
among the ten enumerated examples of tourism related services in 
the statute was that they were part of tour packages.  Citing 
this court’s discussion of the term “tour packager” in 
Travelocity, the court asserted that the legislature’s inclusion 
of “transportation included in a tour package” rather than 
simply “transportation” confirmed that the provision was 
intended to reach only services packaged together 
for resale by 
a travel agent.  Accordingly, the court found that the stand-
alone merchant rental car transactions did not qualify as 
tourism related services for GET apportionment under HRS § 237-
18(f).  The court further found that package transactions, 
however, in which the rental car was purchased along with at 
least one other service, qualified as “transportation included 
in a tour package” and were thus tourism  related services within 
the meaning of the GET apportionment provision. 
  On November 4, 2016, the court entered an order 
corresponding with its oral rulings  granting in part and denying 
in part the Director and OTCs ’ cross-motions for partial summary 
judgment.18  On April 25, 2017, the tax court entered a 
                     
 18 The order included failure- to-file penalties against all OTCs for 
tax years 2000 through 2012, as well as failure-to-pay penalties against all

19 Stipulated Order and Final Judgment Disposing of All Issues and 
Claims of All Parties.  Both the Director and the OTCs timely 
appealed.   Prior to briefing, the Director and the OTCs each 
filed applications for transfer to this court.  This court 
granted transfer on August 11, 2017. 
2. Proceedings Before this Court 
  Before this court, the Director argues that the tax 
court erred by applying the HRS § 237-18(f)  GET apportioning 
provision to the OTC’s package rental car transactions.  The 
Director contends that, by determin ing that rental cars included 
in package transactions were “transportation within a tour 
package,” the court  disregarded the plain language of the law by 
changing the term “transportation” to “rental cars”  and ignoring 
the word “tour.”   
 
 The Director further asserts that the legislative 
history of HRS § 237- 18(f) and other taxing provisions indicates 
that the legislature intended only those services in which a 
tourist is conveyed to a second location by another party to be 
included in the term “transportation,” and that this meaning is 
reflected by standard rules of statutory construction and in the 
                                                                        
(. . . continued) 
 
OTCs for tax years 2000 through 2013 except for priceline.com for the period 
from May 2013 through December 2013.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
20 various portions of the Hawai‘i Ad
ministrative Rules that employ 
the term.  And, e ven were rent al cars “transportation” for 
purposes of HRS § 237- 18(f), the Director contend s, the OTCs 
failed to demonstrate that rental cars are included in a “tour” 
package.  The Director argues that the OTCs submitted no 
evidence detailing the components included in the specific 
assessed transactions, and thus there is no evidence in the 
record to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether 
the transactions constituted “tour” packages.19  An evidentiary 
presumption in favor of the correctness of the Director ’s tax 
assessments therefore should have been determinative , the 
Director contends, regardless of whether the inclusion of 
airfare or accommodations would qualify a transaction as a tour 
package.   
 
 The OTCs in turn argue that the tax court erred by 
failing to find that principles of res judicata bar the Director 
from collecting additional assessments of a  tax for tax years 
that have been previously litigated to final judgment.  And even 
if these assessments 
are not wholly  barred, the OTCs maintain, 
                     
 19 The Director’s own  submitted evidence included documentation from 
which it can be reasonably inferred that the assessed transactions included 
package transactions with accommodations or airfare as a component, including 
a declaration by a consultant hired by the DOT indicating such package 
transactions accounted for approximately one -third of the assessed 
transactions by volume and revenue.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
21 the tax court’s ruling cannot stand  because it failed to apply 
the HRS § 237- 18(f) income-apportioning provision to the OTCs 
stand-alone merchant car rental transactions, which legislative 
history and principles of statutory con
struction confirm are 
“tourism related services” within the meaning of the statute .   
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
  This court reviews the grant or denial of summary 
judgment de novo.  Travelocity.com, L.P. v. Dir. of Taxation, 
135 Hawaii 88, 96–97, 346 P.3d 157, 165 –66 (2015).  “When the 
facts are undisputed and the sole question is one of law, the 
decision of the [tax court] is reviewed ‘under the right/wrong 
standard. ’”  Id. at 97, 436 P.3d at 166 (quoting Kamikawa v. 
United Parcel Serv., Inc., 88 Hawaii 336, 338, 966 P.2d 648, 650 
(1998)). 
III.  DISCUSSION 
  In reviewing the tax court’s grant or denial of 
summary judgment, this court applies the same standard as the 
trial court: “summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, 
together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no 
genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party  
is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  Travelocity.com, 
L.P. v. Dir. of Taxation, 135 Hawaii 88, 96–97, 346 P.3d 157, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
22 165–66 (2015) (quoting Fujimoto v. Au, 95 Hawai i 116, 136, 19 
P.3d 699, 719 (2001)).  When 
performing this evaluation, we 
consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-
moving party.  Umberger v. Dep ’t of Land & Nat. Res., 140 Hawaii 
500, 528, 403 P.3d 277, 305 (2017) (quoting Lambert v. Waha, 137 
Hawaii 423, 432 n.9, 375 P.3d 202, 211 n.9 (2016)). 
In this case, the OTCs argue that the Director was 
barred by res judicata from bringing an action to enforce any 
additional GET assessments based on years for which the OTCs’ 
GET liability was litigated to final judgement in Travelocity.  
The Director responds that as an estoppel defense, res judicata 
is not available as a defense against the sovereign power of 
taxation.  We therefore first examine the development of the 
doctrine of res judicata, relevant statutory law, and our 
precedent concerning the application of estoppel defenses in 
this context.  We then turn to the statutes governing the GET 
and examine their plain text, legislative history, and 
applicable canons of statutory construction to determine whether 
rental car transactions qualify as “tourism  related services” 
for purposes of the relevant income-reducing provision.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
23 A. Res Judicata 
1. Overview 
  The OTCs argue that the Director is barred from 
assessing them additional GET for the years 2000- 2011 by res 
judicata because their GET liability for those years was 
litigated to final judgment in Travelocity.  The Corpus Juris 
Secundum defines res judicata as the doctrine that “treats the 
final determination of an action as speaking the infallible 
truth as to the rights of the parties as to the entire subject 
of the controversy, so that such controversy and every part of 
it must stand irrevocably closed by such determination.”  50 
C.J.S. Judgments § 926 (2018).  
This common law doctrine has its 
roots in the Roman and Germanic 
legal systems that contributed 
to Anglo-American law, and similar rules give preclusive effect 
to final judgments in most contemporary legal systems.  
Developments in the Law- Res Judicata, 65 Harv. L. Rev. 818, 820 
(1952). 20
  As recognized in this court’s early decisions, the 
doctrine was historically considered to have two interrelated 
aspects, each arising from the litigation of a matter to final 
                     
 20 The GET assessments in this case also include rental car 
transactions in the years 2012 and 2013, years which were not included in the 
Travelocity  assessments and thus not covered by the OTCs’ res judicata  
defense.  See  supra, notes 13, 14, and accompanying text.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
24 judgment: one barring the bringing of a new action between the 
parties based on the same subject matter as a previous claim, 
and one barring the relitigation of specific issues previously 
determined in a case between the same parties.  
Res judicata  is twofold.  The judgment of a court of 
competent jurisdiction is a bar to a new action in any 
court between the same parties or their privies concerning 
the same subject matter, and precludes the relitigation, 
not only of the issues which were actually litigated in the 
first action, but also of all grounds of claim and defense 
which might have been properly litigated in the first 
action but were not litigated or decided.  Likewise, the 
adjudication by a court  of competent jurisdiction of any 
right, fact or issue arising between the parties and 
actually litigated by them bars the relitigation between 
the same parties or their privies in any court of the same 
right, fact or issue arising in any subsequent action  or 
suit between the same parties or their privies, and this 
irrespective of whether the later action or suit relates to 
the same subject matter.  
In re Bishop, 36 Haw. 403, 416 –17 (Haw. Terr. 1943) (citing 
Makainai v. Lalakea, 29 Haw. 482 (Haw. Terr. 1926)).  Thus, res 
judicata as originally articulated by this court prohibited the 
assertion of any grounds of 
claim or defense that was or could 
have been asserted in a prior litigation between the parties 
in 
a later litigation concerning the same subject matter .  This 
concept was historically called “estoppel by judgment, ”  and is 
modernly termed “claim preclusion ,” “true res judicata ,” or 
simply “res judicata .”  See E. A. K., Judgments- Distinction 21
                     
 21 Some formulations further divide claim preclusion into the 
concepts of “merger,” “bar,” and “splitting.”  See Restatement (Second) of 
Judgments § 24 (1982).  Merger prevents a plaintiff from asserting a new 
action on a “claim or any part thereof” when a “final personal judgment” has 
been rendered in the plaintiff’s favor on that claim.  Id. at § 18(1). Bar

25 Between Res Judicata and Estoppel by Verdict, 7 Tex. L. Rev. 
167, 168 (1928); 46 Am. Jur. 2d Judgments § 443 (2018).  The 
doctrine further prohibited the relitigation of specific 
issues 
that were actually decided in a prior litigation against a 
party--regardless of the subject matter of th
e subsequent 
litigation.  This is known as “estoppel by verdict,” “collateral 
estoppel,” “partial res judicata,” or, in modern times, “issue 
preclusion.”  E. A. K., supra, at 168; 46 Am. Jur. 2d Judgments 
§ 443; Hemmings v. C.I.R
., 104 T.C. 221, 231 (1995). 
  Although some academics still refer to both concepts 
as falling “[w]ithin the general doctrine of res judicata ,” 46 
Am. Jur. 2d Judgments § 443, this court has largely adopted the 
modern view that “[r]es judicata, or claim preclusion, and 
collateral estoppel, or is
sue preclusion, are . . . . separate 
doctrines that ‘involve [] distinct questions of law.’”   Bremer 
v. Weeks, 104 Hawai i 43, 53 & n.14, 85 P.3d 150, 160 & n.14 
(2004) (quoting Dorrance v. Lee, 90 Hawai i 143, 148, 976 P.2d 
904, 909 (1999)).   22
                                                                        
(. . . continued) 
 
prevents a plaintiff from bringing another action on a claim on which the 
plaintiff has previously lost. Id. at § 19.  Splitting is the rule that 
multiple claims from a “series of connected transactions ” may not be brought  
in separate actions.  
Id. at § 24. 
 22 The OTCs argue only that the assessments in this  case are barred 
by the first concept, claim preclusion.  This opinion therefore addresses 
issue preclusion only when relevant to its analysis of claim preclusion.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
26   Under modern formulations, the party asserting claim 
preclusion has the burden of proving three elements to establish 
that an action is barred: 1) there was a final judgment on the 
merits, 2) both parties are the same or are in privity with the 
same parties in the original suit, and 3) the claim decided in 
the original suit is identical with the one presented in the 
action in question.  E. Sav. Bank, FSB v. Esteban, 129 Hawai i 
154, 159, 296 P.3d 1062, 1067 (2013) (quoting Bremer, 104 Hawai i 
at 54, 85 P.3d at 161).  Some courts alternat ively phrase the 
third element as “the same cause of action must be involved in 
both cases” and explicitly add a fourth requirement: that the 
first judgment was rendered by a court of competent 
jurisdiction.  See Batchelor-Robjohns v. United States, 788 F.3d 
1280, 1285 (11th Cir. 2015).   
  All but one of the elements are undisputed  in this 
case; the Director does not contest that there was a final 
judgment on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction in 
Travelocity, nor that the case 
involved the same parties as the 
present suit.  Rather, the Director argues that as a matter of 
law res judicata is not available as a defense in an action by 
the State to collect GET.

 23 Given our disposition of this issue, we need not address whether 
the OTCs’ GET liability on the merchant rental car transactions constitutes 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
27 2. The Statutory Framework  
  As an initial matter, 
res judicata is a common law 
doctrine, and common law may generally be overridden by 
statute.   See In re Water Use Permit Applications, 94 Hawaii 
97, 120, 9 P.3d 409, 432 (2000) (holding the legislature may 
override common law doctr ine “as it deems appropriate or 
necessary”); cf. Gold Coast Neighborhood Ass’ n v. State, 140 
Hawaii 437, 451, 403 P.3d 214, 228 (2017) (“However, statutes 
which abrogate the common law must do so expressly, not 
impliedly, and such statutes ‘ must be strictly construed. ’” 
(quoting Burns Int ’l Sec. Servs., Inc. v. Dep’ t of Transp., 66 
Haw. 607, 611, 671 P.2d 446, 449 (1983))) .  Indeed, many federal 
courts have reasoned that the federal internal revenue code has 
displaced the common law
 rules of claim preclusion when holding 
that a claim by the federal government for a tax deficiency is 
not barred by a final judgment in a taxpayer’s previous refund 
action based on the same tax year.  Hemmings v. C.I.R., 104 T.C. 24
                                                                        
(. . . continued) 
 
the same claim litigated in Travelocity or whether the Director as a factual 
matter could have pursued the OTCs ’ GET liability for the merchant rental car 
transactions in Travelocity . 
 24 There may be exceptions to the legislature’s ability to override 
the doctrine of res judicata  when to do so would violate the separation of 
powers by “unconstitutionally interfer[ing] with the judiciary’s authority to 
manage the judicial process and th[e] court’s ability to finally resolve 
matters on appeal by precluding subsequent and repetitive efforts to 
relitigate the same claims.”  Berkson v. LePome, 126 Nev. 492, 495 (2010).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
28 221, 235 (1995) (citing, inter alia, Pfeiffer Co. v. United 
States, 518 F.2d 124, 130 (8th Cir. 1975); Caleshu v. United 
States, 570 F.2d 711, 713 –14 (8th Cir. 1978); Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corp. v. Alloytek, Inc., 924 F.2d 620, 626 (6th Cir. 
1991)).  25
  The Director contends that two Hawai i statutes are 
relevant to this appeal.  First, HRS § 237- 40 (2017) provides 
general guidelines for when the Director may issue a GET 
assessment.  When a taxpayer files a re turn, the Director may 
issue an assessment “within three years after the annual ret urn 
was filed, or within three years of the due date prescribed for 
the filing of the return, whichever is later.”  HRS § 237- 40(a).  
When a taxpayer has failed to file a return, however, GET “may 
be assessed or levied at any time .”  HRS § 237- 40(b).  The 
Director then points to HRS § 237- 38 (2017), which  further 
addresses the failure to file a return: “If any person fails, 
                     
 25 In analyzing whether the action was barred by res judicata, 
Hemmings  considered whether the government’s deficiency claim was a 
compulsory counterclaim under Federal Rule s of Civil Procedure (FRCP) Rule 
13(a) (2009), which is substantially identical to Hawaii Rules of Civil 
Procedure Rule 13(a) (2000).  The rule requires that a  defendant assert in a 
responsive pleading “any claim that --at the time of its service--the pleader 
has against an opposing party if the claim . . . arises out of the 
transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party’s 
claim.”  FRC P Rule 13(a).  Compulsory counterclaim rules incorporate common 
law principles of res judicata.  Tyler v. DH Capital Mgmt., Inc., 736 F.3d 
455, 460 (6th Cir. 2013).  Accordingly, the “classification of compulsory 
counterclaims is often determinative of ple as of res judicata.”  Cleckner v. 
Republic Van & Storage Co., 556 F.2d 766, 769 (5th Cir. 1977) (citing 
Aerojet- General Corp. v. Askew, 511 F.2d 710, 717 (5th Cir. 1975)).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
29 neglects, or refuses to make a return, the department of 
taxation may proceed as it deems best to obtain information on 
which to base the assessment of the tax.  After procuring the 
information the department shall proceed to assess the tax.”  
  Although the Director argues that these provisions 
grant her wide latitude to assess GET in the manner of her 
choice because the OTCs did not file GET returns for the years 
in question, neither statute speaks directly to the Director’s 
authority to issue multiple assessments for the same tax.
  HRS § 
237-40’s statement that “the tax may be levied or assessed at 
any time” is at most ambiguous on the point; an authorization to 
issue a single assessment at any time is not equivalent to an 
authorization to issue 
multiple  assessments .  And, contrary to 
the Director’s characterization, HRS § 237 -38 does not authorize 
her to proceed as she deems best generally, but rather only  in 
“obtain[ing] information on which to base the assessment of the 
tax.”  
 
  In comparison, the federal statutes that courts have 
interpreted as displacing  aspects of res judicata  in federal tax 
cases speak directly on the governmen t’s discretion  in filing a 
deficiency counterclaim.  See 26 U.S.C. § 7422 (2012) (“[T]he 
United States may counterclaim in the taxpayer ’s suit.” 
(emphasis added)); Patzkowski v. United States, 576 F.2d 134, 
136 n.1 (8th Cir. 1978) (“When a taxpayer has sued for a refund, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
30 the Government may, of course, assert its collection action as a 
counterclaim; alternatively, however, it may file a separate 
collection action. ”).  And in some cases these courts have also 
found structural indications that the normal preclusion rules 
would undermine the federal statutory scheme more generally by, 
for example, allowing a taxpayer to unilaterally shorten the 
statute of limitations on the government’s deficiency claim by 
bringing an action for a refund based on the same tax year.  See 
Pfeiffer, 518 F.2d at 129.   
  In the absence of such a clear pronouncement from the 
legislature or an obviously incompatible statutory scheme, this 
court will not infer an intention to override the normal 
functioning of res judicata from the statutes governing GET 
assessments.  See Gold Coast, 140 
Hawaii at 457, 403 P.3d  at 234 
(“Abrogation of such a deeply -rooted principle of law is 
contradictory to our jurisdiction ’s requirement that the common 
law governs unless ‘otherwise expressly
 provided.’” (quoting HRS 
§ 1-1 (2009)). 
3. Res Judicata, Estoppel, and the Sovereign Taxation Power 
  The Director argues that res judicata is a form of 
estoppel and that estoppel defenses do not apply to the 
fundamental sovereign tax power under this court’s decision in ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
31 Director of Taxation v. Medical Underwriters of California, 115 
Hawaii 26180, 193 -94, 166 P.3d 353, 366- 67 (2007).   In Medical 
Underwriters, this court considered whether Medical Underwriters 
of California (MUC) could assert the defense of equitable 
estoppel in a tax appeal.  Id.   In the years prior to the case, 
the insurance division of the State of Hawai i’s Department of 
Commerce and Consumer Affairs had treated MUC as an insurance 
company for licensing purposes under the state insurance code.  
Id. at 183, 166 P.3d at 356.  Relying on this classification, 
MUC reasoned that it was exempt from GET under HRS § 237- 29.7 
(2001), which specifically excludes “insurance companies 
authorized to do business under” the insurance code.  Id.  
                     
 26 The Director also argues that the fundamental sovereign right of 
taxation is protected by article VII, section 1 of the Hawaii Constitution, 
which is entitled “Taxing Power Inalienable” and provides that “[t]he power 
of taxation shall never be surrendered, suspended or contracted away.”  
Courts interpreting similar provisions have generally held that such 
provisions bar the State from surrendering the power of taxation through a 
promise, contract, or transaction.  See Sheehy v. Pub. Emps. Ret. Div., 864 
P.2d 762, 766 (Mont. 1993) (“Article VIII, Section 2 of the 1972 Constitution 
[] prohibits the state from surrendering or contracting away the power to 
tax.  Under that constitutional provision, the state cannot promise any group 
of taxpayers that it will never tax them.”); Nw. Nat. Life Ins. Co. v. 
Jordan, 447 F. Supp. 856, 861 (D. Nev.  1978) (“[T]he Round Hill assessment 
bonds do not attempt to restrict the State of Nevada or the [Tahoe Regional 
Planning Agency] from promulgating and enforcing land use restrictions in the 
Lake Tahoe Basin.  Nor would such a promise have been legally binding. . . . 
[T]he police power and power of eminent domain are generally considered 
inalienable.  It is presumed that parties contract with knowledge that 
reservation of essential attributes of sovereign power is written into all 
contracts.” (citation omit ted)).  The provision is therefore inapposite here, 
where the State’s taxation power would be incidentally barred as the 
consequence of prior litigation.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
32 Accordingly, the company did not file or pay GET from 1985 to 
1999.  Id. 
  In 1999, the Director assessed MUC for unpaid GET for 
these years, arguing that MUC did not meet the statutory 
requirements to be an “insurance company.”  Id. at 183, 187, 166 
P.3d at 356, 360.  MUC appealed the assessments, arguing inter 
alia that the Director was estopped from denying its status as 
an insurance company because MUC had detrimentally relied on it s 
classification by the insurance division--another agency of the 
State government.  Id. at 193, 166 P.3d 366.   
  This court held  that MUC was not an insurance company 
for purposes of the GET exemption and that the Director was not 
estopped from collecting the back-taxes.  Id. at 194, 166 P.3d 
367.  The court reasoned that, although “generally, ‘the 
doctrine of equitable estoppel is fully applicable against the 
government,’” “significant limitations have been placed on the 
doctrine in this context.”  Id. at 193, 166 P.3d 366 (quoting 
State v. Zimring, 58 Haw. 106, 126, 566 P.2d 725, 738 (1977); 
Filipo v. Chang, 62 Haw. 626, 634, 618 P.2d 295, 300 (1980)).  
One such limitation is that the doctrine cannot be applied to 
prevent the State from exercising its sovereign power.  Id. 
(citing Filipo, 62 Haw. at 634, 618 P.2d at 300; Godbold v. 
Manibog, 36 Haw. 206, 214 (Haw. Terr. 1942)).  Because it was 
“beyond dispute that the power of taxation is a sovereign power ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
33 of the state,” the court reasoned that “the doctrine of 
equitable estoppel may not be applied against the government ’s 
power to tax.”  Id. at 194, 166 P.3d 367 (citing Fitzgerald v. 
City of Bangor, 726 A.2d 1253, 1255 –56 (Me. 1999); PCS, Inc. v. 
Ariz. Dep’t of Revenue, 176 Ariz. 628, 630, (Ariz. T.C. 1993)). 
  In so holding, this court quoted from Fitzgerald v. 
City of Bangor, a decision by the Supreme Judicial Court of 
Maine holding that estoppel is unavailable in tax cases in order 
“to assure that no officer of government has the ability to 
interfere inadvertently with the government ’s fundamental 
sovereign power to tax its citizens.”  115 Hawai i at 194, 166 
P.3d at 367 (quoting Fitzgerald , 726 A.2d at 1255 –56).  The 
Maine court reason ed that taxation was “the paramount function 
of government by which it is enabled to exist and function at 
all.”  Fitzgerald, 726 A.2d at 1256 n.4 (quoting Me.  Sch. Admin. 
Dist. No. 15 v. Raynolds, 413 A.2d 523, 533 (Me. 1980)).  “An 
administrative officer charged with the duty of collecting taxes 
had neither the power to abrogate the state ’s sovereign power to 
tax nor the power to grant an exemption to a taxpayer,” the 
court continued.  Id.  Accordingly, tax officials cannot prevent 
the government from exercising its fundamental tax authority by ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
34 27intentional or unintentional acts, the court concluded.   See 
id. 
  The OTCs argue that “ Medical Underwriters is about 
equitable estoppel” and that “[t]he question of whether a taxing 
authority may bring an action in the first instance (despite its 
delay and/or the taxpayer’s reliance) is very different from 
whether a taxing authority is free to relitigate claims that 
already were brought, or could have been brought, in a prior 
action that resulted in a final judgment.”   
  Equitable estoppel and res judicata share a common 
ancestry; both “evolved from the medieval common law theory of 
estoppel by matter in pais (‘in the country’ or ‘on the land’).”  
Christopher Brown, A Comparative and Critical Assessment of 
Estoppel in International Law, 50 U. Miami L. Rev. 369, 372 
(1996).  The rule originally concerned the binding effect of 
representations made in public.  Id.  As written records became 
more common, res judicata split off and became a doctrine of its 
                     
 27 It is noted that federal courts do not follow this rule in 
federal tax litigation, and instead apply a higher standard in determining 
whether equitable estoppel is available as a defense against the government ’s 
power of taxation than in other contexts.  See  Norfolk S. Corp. v. C.I.R., 
104 T.C. 13, 60 (1995), aff’d, 140 F.3d 240 (4th Cir. 1998) (holding  
government may only be equitably estopped based on a mistake of law when “a 
taxpayer can prove he or she would suffer an unconscionable injury” and 
setting forth a five factor test for equitable estoppel based on misstatement 
of fact).  It is therefore unsurprising that federal courts also consider res 
judicata  a potential defense against the government’s taxation power when a 
statute does not provide otherwise.  See, e.g., Erickson v. United States, 
309 F.2d 760, 768 (Ct. Cl. 1962); Lenny v. Williams, 143  F.Supp. 29, 34 (N.D. 
Ohio 1956).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
35 own, premised on the official recording of court proceedings.  
Id. at 375. 
  “In spite of the historical association between 
estoppel by res judicata and the other forms of estoppel, the 
former is founded on vastly different princ iples.”  Id.  
Equitable estoppel, as its name implies, exists primarily to 
ensure fairness to litigants by protecting innocent parties and 
“prevent[ing] a party from profiting from his or her 
wrongdoing.”  Major League Baseball v. Morsani, 790 So.2d 1071, 
1078 (Fla. 2001).  Res judicata likewise protects litigants by 
“reliev[ing] parties of the cost and vexation of multiple 
lawsuits” and ensuring finality, thus permitting “reliance on 
adjudication.”  State by Price v. Magoon, 75 Haw. 164, 189, 858 
P.2d 712, 724 (1993) (quoting Kauhane v. Acutron Co., 71 Haw. 
458, 463-64, 795 P.2d 276, 278-79 (1990)).   
  But res judicata also serves to “conserve judicial 
resources” and “prevent[] inconsistent decisions.”  Id.  The 
doctrine is an aspect of “the inherent abili ty of the judiciary 
to manage litigation and finally resolve cases,” and some courts 
have held that efforts by the other branches of government to 
circumvent res judicata violate the separation of powers.  
Berkson v. LePome, 126 Nev. 492, 499-500, 245 P.3d 560, 565-66 
(2010) (holding that a 
statute that permitted plaintiffs whose 
victories were reversed on appeal to file new actions violated ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
36 the separation of powers); accord  Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, 
Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 225 (1995) (holding that a statute 
permitting plaintiffs to refile actions previously dismissed as 
untimely violated separation of powers). 
  Thus, unlike equitable estoppel, res judicata is a 
rule not only “of fundamental and substantial justice” and 
“private peace” but of “public policy.”  Magoon, 75 Haw. at 189, 
858 P.2d at 724 (quoting Kauhane , 71 Haw. at 463- 64, 795 P.2d at 
278-79).  Some courts have classified this as the doctrine’s 
primary purpose.  
See Buromin Co. v. Nat ’l Aluminate Corp., 70 
F.Supp. 214, 217 (D. Del. 194 7) (“The doctrine of res judicata 
is primarily one of public policy and only secondarily of 
private benefit to the individual litigants.  It has its roots 
in the maxim that it concerns the public that there be an end to 
litigation when one party has had a full and free opportunity of 
presenting all the facts pertinent to the controversy.”)   Some 
commentators argue this distinction is significant enough that 
“in contemporary practice, [claim and issue preclusion] are not 
considered estoppels at all in spite of their nomenclature. ”  
Brown, supra, at 376. 
  This case therefore presents a conflict between 
competing doctrines.  On the one hand, Medical Underwriters held 
that estoppel defenses should not be available 
against the 
government in tax cases “to assure that no officer of government ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
37 has the ability to interfere inadvertently with the government ’s 
fundamental sovereign power to tax its citizens.”  115 Hawai i at 
194, 166 P.3d at 367 (quoting Fitzgerald
, 726 A. 2d at 1255–56).  
On the other, res judicata implicates public policy and 
fundamental judicial powers such as the ability to finally 
resolve cases, and the doctrine potentially serves as a check on 
the other branches of government.  Berkson, 126 Nev. at 500.   
This is to say that, without some form of preclusion, there is 
nothing to stop litigants--including the executive and 
legislative branches--from simply relitigating adverse 
determinations until they receive a  favorable decision. 
  In light of the competing considerations of the 
sovereign power to tax versus the public policy of case 
finality, we also consider the doctrine of issue preclusion.  
Although both claim preclusion and issue preclusion were 
historically considered aspects of 
res judicata and are 
nominally forms of estoppel, when considered in relation to each 
other it becomes clear th at the doctrines serve different 
purposes.   
  Claim preclusion “may be viewed as a rule of battle 
which forces one side to fire all of its guns at once rather 
than withhold some of its rounds for later in the battle.”  
Brown, supra, at 375.  It serves to conserve judicial resources 
by preventing a “multiplicity of suits” and to protect litigants ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
38 against the “cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits.”  Kauhane, 
71 Haw. at 463, 795 P.2d at 278.  It thus promotes finality 
generally in that it ensures all of the litigation related to a 
given incident or transaction is settled at once. 
  Issue preclusion, by  contrast, protects the core 
judicial power to render final decisions as to facts and law in 
specific controversies.  See Berkson, 126 Nev. at 500.  Even in 
the absence of claim preclusion, issue preclusion 
makes judicial 
determinations conclusive and prevents a party from repeatedly 
litigating adverse decisions in the hopes of securing a more 
favorable outcome. 
  W e held in Medical Underwriters that the actions of a 
specific government official may not deprive the State of Hawai i 
of its sovereign power to collect the taxes it is legally due.  
115 Hawai i at 193-94, 166 P.3d at 366- 67.  Our reasoning holds 
equally true when those actions are in the context of  a prior 
litigation, and the common law defense of claim preclusion is 
thus inapplicable against the State in tax cases.   Id.  T his is 
not to say, however, that the State may relitigate adverse 
judicial tax decisions ad infinitum.  The core judicial power to 
make binding determinations of issues that come before the 
courts remains protected by the doctrine of issue preclusion, 
which applies with full force in tax litigation. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
39   Because the doctrine of claim preclusion is 
inoperative as a defense against the State’s sovereign taxation 
power, the OTCs may not invoke it to bar the Director’s 
enforcement of the tax assessments here at issue.28  The tax 
court was therefore correct to deny the OTCs ’ cross-motion for 
partial summary judgment. 
B. GET Apportionment for Tourism Related Services  
  HRS § 237- 18(f) permits travel agencies to pay GET on 
only the portion of their proceeds that they retain when the 
agencies split their gross income from arranging “tourism 
related services” with third- party service providers.  Both 
parties challenge the tax court’s conclusion that the provision 
applies categorically to services sold as part of a travel 
package.  The Director argues that car rentals are not tourism 
related services within the meaning of the statute  regardless of 
whether the rental is a component of a travel package.  
Conversely, the OTCs contend that vehicle rentals are covered by 
HRS § 237-18(f) irrespective of their inclusion in a package 
transaction.  
                     
 28 The OTCs have not raised issue preclusion as a defense, and it is 
therefore unnecessary for this court to determine whether the OTCs’ GET 
liability for the assessed years would be an issue entitled to preclusive 
effect.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
40 1. The Presumption of Validity and Interpretory Balance 
  As a threshold matter, the parties disagree as to the 
litigant in whose favor this court is obliged to interpret the 
governing GET statutes.  The Director asserts that GET 
assessments are presumed correct and that it is the OTCs ’ burden 
to disprove their accuracy.  By  contrast, the OTCs argue that, 
under settled cannons of statutory construction, laws imposing 
taxes are construed strictly against the government with any 
doubt resolved in favor of the taxpayer.  The Director responds 
that this court has recognized an exception to the general rule 
when a taxpayer seeks an exemption from a tax of general 
applicability, in which case the statute should be interpreted 
strictly against the taxpayer.    
  This court has held that GET assessments enjoy a 
presumption of validity under HRS § 232 –13 (2017), which 
provides that “the assessment . . . shall be deemed prima facie 
correct.”  Travelocity, 135 Hawai i at 114- 15, 346 P.3d at 183- 84 
(emphasis omitted) (citing In re Valley of Temples Corp., 56 
Haw. 229, 232, 533 P.2d 1218, 1220 (1975)).  The use of the term 
prima facie, however, indicates that this presumption concerns 
the evidentiary burden of establishing sufficient facts to 
prevail.  See Prima Facie Case, Black’s Law Dictionary  (10th ed. 
2014) (“A party’s production of enough evidence to allow the 
fact-trier to infer the fact at issue and rule in the party’s ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
41 favor.”); Riv era v. Philip Morris, Inc., 125 Nev. 185, 190 –91 
(2009) (“The party that carries the burden of production must 
establish a prima facie case.   The burden of production may be 
switched from one party to another by a presumption.”  (citations 
omitted)).  It is  therefore inapplicable to the Director’s legal 
conclusions, which are reviewable de novo as questions of law.  
Weinberg v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 82 Hawai i 317, 322, 922 
P.2d 371, 376 (1996).
 
  We have  further recognized that, as applied in tax 
cases, there is a “rule of strict construction . . . . favoring 
the taxpayer on provisions imposing the tax or cutting against 
him on exemptions.”  Honolulu Star Bulletin, Ltd. v. Burns, 50 
Haw. 603, 604, 446 P.2d 171, 172 (1968) (quoting In re Taxes, 
Hawaiian Pineapple Co., 45 Haw. 167, 192, 363 P.2d 990, 1003 
(1961)).  We have held, however, that “the rule of strict 
construction with regard to taxing statutes is resorted to only 
‘as an aid to construction when an ambiguity or doubt is 
apparent on the face of t
he statute, and then only after other 
possible extrinsic aids of construction available to resolve the 
ambiguity have been exhausted.’”  Travelocity, 135 Hawai i at 121 
n.47, 346 P.3d at 190 n.47 (quoting 
Bishop Trust Co. v. Burns, 
46 Haw. 375, 399–400, 381 P.2d 687, 701 (1963)).   
  This court is therefore  free to interpret GET statutes 
through normal tools of statutory interpretation and will resort ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
42 to the rule of strict construction only if these methods do not 
yield a clear answer.   
2. The Text of the Statute  
  “Under general principles of statutory construction, 
courts give words their ordinary meaning unless something in the 
statute requires a different interpretation. ”  Saranillio v. 
Silva, 78 Hawai i 1, 10, 889 P.2d 685, 694 (1995) (citing Ross v. 
Stouffer Hotel Co. ( Hawaii), 76 Hawaii 454, 461, 879 P.2d 1037, 
1044 (1994)).  Thus, “ [t]he fundamental starting point of 
statutory interpretation is the language of the statute itself.”  
State v. Alangcas , 134 Hawaii 515, 525, 345 P.3d 181, 191 (2015) 
(citing Hawaii Gov ’t Emps. Ass’n v. Lingle, 124 Hawai i 197, 202,  
239 P.3d 1, 6 (2010)).  “ [W]here the statutory language is plain 
and unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning.”  Schmidt v. Bd. of Dirs. of Ass’ n of 
Apartment Owners of Marco Polo Apartments, 73 Haw. 526, 531 –32, 
836 P.2d 479, 482 (1992) (citations and quotes omitted).  
  HRS § 237- 18(f) grants GET apportionment for “tourism 
related services  [] furnished through arrangements made by a 
travel agency or tour packager” when “the gross income is 
divided between the provider of the services and the travel ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
43 agency or tour packager. ”29  The statute defines tourism related 
services as “catamaran cruises, c anoe rides, dinner cruises, lei 
greetings, transportation included in a tour package,  
sightseeing tours not subject to chapter 239, admissions to 
luaus, dinner shows, extravaganzas, cultural and educational 
facilities, and other services rendered directly to the customer 
or tourist.”  Thus, the statute on its face imposes three 
requirements: 1) the arrangement is made by a travel agency or 
tour packager; 2) the gross income from the transaction is 
divided between the service provider and the travel agency or 
tour packager; and 3) the service is a tourism  related service,  
defined as either one of the enumerated examples or “[an]other  
service[] rendered directly to the customer or tourist.”  
                     
 29 HRS § 237 -18(f) is restated here as follows:  
(f)  Where tourism related services are furnished through 
arrangements made by a travel agency or tour packager and 
the gross income is divided between the provider of the 
services and the travel agency or  tour packager, the tax 
imposed by this chapter shall apply to each such person 
with respect to such person ’s respective portion of the 
proceeds, and no more.  
As used in this subsection “tourism related services” means 
catamaran cruises, canoe rides, dinner cruises, lei 
greetings, transportation included in a tour package, 
sightseeing tours not subject to chapter 239, admissions to 
luaus, dinner shows, extravaganzas, cultural and 
educational facilities, and other services rendered 
directly to the customer or tourist, but only if the 
providers of the services other than air transportation are 
subject to a four per cent tax under this chapter or 
chapter 239.  
(Emphasis added.) ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
44   As the Director acknowledges, this court determined in 
Travelocity that the first two requirements are generally met in 
transactions following the OTCs ’ merchant  business model.30  135 
Hawaii at 108, 111, 346 P.3d at 177, 180 (“[F]or the purposes of  
the GET Apportioning Provision, the OTCs operate as travel 
agencies in the Assessed Transactions. . . . [I]n the Assessed 
Transactions, gross income is divided, as that term is used in 
the GET Apportioning Provision.”).   Further, vehicle rentals are  
“services rendered directly to the customer or tourist”  within 
the plain meaning of the provision, indicating that they would 
be tourism related services under a literal reading of the  
statutory definition.31   
  Rental cars also fall within the conventional 
understanding of tourism related services independent of the 
statutory definit ion.  As the OTCs point out, numerous  
publications marketed toward tourists visiting Hawai i promote 
renting a car during a vacation, including many publications 
released by the State itself.  And the previous State Strategic 
                     
 30 This court held in Travelocity  that the OTCs acted as travel 
agencies in the specific transactions there at issue.  135 Hawai i at 108, 346 
P.3d at 177.  Although we did not hold that the OTCs were travel agencies for 
all purposes, the Director does not dispute the OTCs’ status as trav el 
agencies in the transactions in this case.  
 31 As discussed infra, canons of statutory construction may in some 
instances justify departing from the plain meaning of this type of “catch -
all” residual clause.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
45 Tourism Plan expressly noted that rental cars are commonly 
thought of as part of the “visitor industry” due to the 
prominent role they play servicing tourists.  See Hawaii Tourism  
Authority, Hawai i Tourism Strategic Plan 2005- 2015 at 8, 14, 16 
(“When speaking about the ‘visitor industry,’ what generally 
comes to mind are those directly involved in hotels and other  
accommodations, airlines, car rental agencies, visitor 
attractions, tour operators, and restaurants and retail 
operations. . . . Currently, the primary transportation modes 
used by visitors are air carriers, cruise ships, ferries, public  
transportation vehicles, private buses, rental cars  and taxis. .  
. . [N]early all visitors on the neighbor islands (and still 
many on O ahu) rely on tour buses, taxis or rental cars .” 
(emphases added)).   
  Indeed, the Director ultimately does not dispute that 
“in a general sense, car rentals are part of the tourism 
industry.”  The Director instead attempts to distinguish 
services that are part of the tourism industry from “tourism 
related services.”   But--at least under the common understanding 
of the term--the distinction is unfounded.  A conventional 
dictionary defines “related” to simply mean “associated” or ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
46 “connected.”32  Services that are part of the tourism industry 
are plainly associated or connected with tourism, and thus 
“tourism related” under the plain meaning of the phrase
. 
  Because rental cars are tourism
 related services under 
both the plain- text of the statutory definition and conventional 
definitions of the term, the rental car transactions satisfy HRS 
§ 237-18(f)’s third requirement.  The text of HRS § 237-18(f) 
therefore supports extending GET apportionment to the assessed 
rental car transactions.
 
3. Legislative History 
 
 Even when the meaning of a law is apparent on its 
face, “[l]egislative history may be used to confirm [the 
court’s] interpretation of a statute’ s plain language.”  E & J 
Lounge Operating Co. v. Liquor Comm’n of City & Cty. of 
Honolulu, 118 Hawai ‘i 320, 335, 18
9 P.3d 432, 447 (2008).  The 
legislative history of HRS § 237-18(f) indicates that the 
provision was intended to protect and encourage the growth of 
the Hawai i visitor industry.  The statute was enacted in 1986 as 
part of larger legislation concerning the taxation of tourism.  
See 1986 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 340, § 7 at 767 .  Both the report 
of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means and the conference 
                     
 32 Related, Dictionary.com Unabridged, 
http://www.dictionary.com/browse/related (last visited Feb. 20, 2019 ).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
47 committee report on the bill note that HRS § 237- 18(f) was 
intended to alleviate the effects of pyramiding that “does not 
serve the interests of the State in encouraging tourism.”  S. 
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 651- 86, in 1986 Senate Journal, at 1077; 
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 70- 86, in 1986 House Journal, at 962.  
  In 1991, the legislature expanded the definition of 
“tourism related services” by a dding six specific services and 
the catch-all clause for “other services rendered directly to 
the customer or tourist.”  See 1991 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 287, § 1 
at 695.  The report of the House Committee on Tourism stated 
that the change was intended to addr ess “inequities [that] 
appear to exist in existing statutes regarding the assessment of 
the general excise tax on the revenues of travel-related 
companies.”  H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 140, in 1991 House 
Journal, at 891.  
  Together, these statements evince the legislature’s 
intention that HRS § 237- 18(f) promote tourism by affording 
favorable tax treatment to parties that facilitate recreational 
travel to the State.  As this court observed in Travelocity, the 
legislature made similar statements when enacting HRS § 237-
18(g), which provides GET apportionment for transient 
accommodations booked through a travel agency or tour packager, 
and HRS § 237-18(h), which provides GET apportionment when motor 
carriers contract together to provide transportation.  See  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
48 Travelocity, 135 Hawai i at 110, 346 P.3d at 179.  We noted that, 
in enacting HRS § 237- 18(h), the legislature specifically 
“identified transportation as an element of the Hawaii visitor 
industry that needed protection.”  Id.  Considering the three 
provisions collectively, this court observed that “the 
legislature repeatedly sought to protect tourism- related 
industries.”  Id. at 111, 346 P.3d at 180.  We therefore held 
that the analogous HRS § 237- 18(g) GET apportionment provision 
“should not be given a const rained interpretation that would 
frustrate the legislative intent to protect the tourism 
industry.”  Id. 
  The record indicates the OTCs’ business model is 
designed to promote efficiency by providing global marketing for 
Hawaii service providers and connecting customers with excess 
inventory and availability.  It reflects that the  OTCs are often 
able to offer customers decreased prices due to the volume of 
their sales, as well as a central point from which visitors can 
book a variety of services at once.  The record therefore 
indicates that the OTCs’  business model makes Hawaii 
tourism 
cheaper for consumers, suggesting that the OTCs are the type of 
companies to which the legislature intended HRS § 237-18(f) to 
apply.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
49   Further, the legislature expressly stated that the 
1991 expansion of the definition of tourism related services was 
intended to eliminate “inequities” in the GET treatment of the 
income of “travel related companies ”--a descriptor that the OTCs 
indisputably fit.  See Travelocity, 135 Hawai i  at 106, 346 P.3d 
at 175 (holding that the OTCs are “travel agencies,” which is 
conventionally defined as, inter alia , “
an office or enterprise 
engaged in selling, arranging, or furnishing information about 
personal transportation or travel” (quoting Webster’s Third New 
International Dictionary 2433 (unabr. 1993)).   Thus, the 
legislative history of HRS § 237- 18(f) supports extending GET 
apportionment broadly to the services offered by the OTCs that 
are rendered directly to a customer by a service provider w
ith 
whom the OTCs divide the proceeds of the transaction.   
4. Canons of Statutory Construction  
  “Whether a statutory term is unambiguous  . . . does 
not turn solely on dictionary definitions of its component 
words.”  Yates v. United States, 135 S.Ct. 1074, 1081 (2015).  
Courts consider the context in which the term occurs, including 
the role it plays in the 
larger statutory scheme .  Id. at 1081 -
82.  In situations in which a statute contains specific examples 
followed by a general term, courts have generally found 
sufficient ambiguity to turn to cannons of statutory 
construction in interpreting the general term.  See  Peterson v. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
50 Hawaii Elec. Light Co., 85 Hawai i 322, 329, 944 P.2d 1265, 1272 
(1997) (“If the general words are given their full and natural 
meaning, they would include the objects designated by the 
specific words, making the latter superfluous.” (quoting 
Sutherland Statutory Construction § 47.17 (2000))), superseded 
on other grounds by HRS § 269 -15.5 (2007).   
  The primary cannon employed in such instances is 
ejusdem generis,  which translates as “of the same kind or 
class.”  Ejusdem Generis
, Black’s Law Dictionary  (10th ed. 
2014).  “The doctrine of ejusdem generis states that where 
general words follow specific words in a statute, those general 
words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to 
those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.”  
Asato v. Procurement Policy Bd., 132 Hawaii 333, 352, 322 P.3d 
228, 247 (2014) (quoting Singleton v. Liquor Comm’n of Hawaii, 33
                     
 33 This court has also employed a related doctrine, noscitur a 
sociis (literally, “it is known by its associates”) which we have freely 
translated as “words of a feather flock together” or “ the meaning of a word 
is to be judged by the company it keeps.”  Noscitur a Sociis, Black’s Law 
Dictionary  (10th ed. 2014); State v. Deleon, 72 Haw. 241, 244, 813 P.2d 1382, 
1384 (1991).  The doctrine “provides that the meaning of words may be 
determined by reference to their relationship with other associated words and 
phrases.”  Peterson, 85 Hawai i at 328, 944 P.2d at 1271.  Although the 
parties’ briefs in this case analyze ejusdem generis  and noscitur a sociis  as 
separate doctrines, this court has held that ejusdem generis  is an applied 
“variation” of noscitur a sociis.  Id.; see also  Noscitur a Sociis, Black’s 
Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (“The ejusdem generis  rule is an example of a 
broader linguistic rule or practice to which reference is made by the Latin 
tag noscitur a sociis .” (quoting Rupert Cross, Statutory Interpretation  
118 (1976) ). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
51 111 Hawai i 234, 242 n.14, 140 P.3d 1014, 1022 n.14 (2006)) 
(internal quotations omitted).   Courts employing the doctrine 
identify the commonality shared by the enumerated examples and 
use this commonality to limit the reach of the general term.  
See State v. Kahalewai, 56 Haw. 481, 489, 541 P.2d 1020, 1026 
(1975). 
  As the OTCs argue , the Director has consistently 
failed to identify a commonality shared by all  of the tourism 
related services identified in the statute--“catamaran cruises, 
canoe rides, dinner cruises, lei greetings, transportation 
included in a tour package, sightseeing tours,  . . . admissions 
to luaus, dinner shows, extravaganzas, [and] cultural and 
educational facilities.”   Both of the commonalities argued by 
the Director--that the activities are done primarily for 
enjoyment and that the services are ends in themselves rather 
than a means of enjoying other activities
--are belied by the 
inclusion of “transporta tion included in a tour package, ” which 
fits neither description.  Thus, the only clear commonality 
among all of the enumerated tourism related services is that 
they are marketed and sold primarily (albeit not exclusively) to 
tourists.  34
                     
 34 The tax court instead determined that the commonality between the 
ten items was that they “were part and parcel of . . . tour packages,” and 
thus concluded that vehicle rentals are tourism  related services only when 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
52   Notwithstanding the general applicability of ejusdem 
generis, this court has held that the cannons of statutory 
construction are only “aids in ascertaining and giving effect to 
the legislative intent, [and] these rules cannot be used in 
contravention of the purpose of the legislature by confining the 
operation of the statute within narrower limits than intended.”  
State v. Prevo, 44 Haw. 665, 668 –69, 361 P.2d 1044, 1047 (1961); 
see also Holi v. AIG Hawaii Ins. Co., 113 Hawai i 196, 204, 150 
P.3d 845, 853 (Ct. App. 2007) (“The doctrine of ejusdem generis 
‘is only app
licable where legislative intent or language 
expressing that intent is unclear.’” (quoting Sutherland 
Statutory Construction  § 47.18 (2000)).  The cannons are also 
not a bar to applying the “sense of the words used which best 
harmonizes with the design of the statute or the end in view.”  
Prevo, 44 Haw. at 669, 361 P.2d at 1047.  Thus, this court is 
not required to employ ejusdem generis
 if it concludes the

included in a travel package.  Although there are some indications that the 
1991 bill expanding the definition of tourism  related services was initially 
introduced to add, inter alia , “transportation that is included in tour 
packages sold for package prices[] and other incidental services included 
within tour packages,” see H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 140, in 1991 House 
Journal, at 891,  the bill went through substantial revisions prior to 
enactment.  See  H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 683, in 1991 House Journal, at 1081  
(noting revisions to clarify the provision covered “services rendered to the 
customer or tourist directly”).  Presently, there is no indication in the 
text of the statute that it is limited to services included in tour packages, 
and both parties agree that “[a] ‘stand -alone’ luau is included within HRS § 
237-18(f) to the same extent as a luau purchased as part of a package.”  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
53 legislature clearly intended HRS § 237- 18(f) to include or 
exclude the assessed rental car transactions or if it finds that 
the doctrine is in disharmony with the design of the statute. 
  Here, HRS § 237-18(f) provides that tourism services 
may be “rendered directly to the customer or tourist,”  implying 
that it is not a prerequisite for the term ’s application that 
the service be primarily marketed and sold to tourists.  
(Emphasis added.)  And, a s stated, the provision is limited by 
two other requirements: the service must be arranged by a travel 
agency or tour packager,  and the income from the transaction 
must be divided between the arranger and the service provider.  
Our decision in Travelocity established that, to qualify as a 
travel agency, a business must
 generally be “engaged in selling, 
arranging, or furnishing information about personal 
transportation or travel” or “engaged in selling and arranging 
transportation, accommodations, tours and trips for travelers.”  
135 Hawai i35 at 106, 346 P.3d at 175
.   Thus, applying the literal 
meaning of the catch- all clause of HRS § 237-18(f)-- that is, 
interpreting the clause to encompass all services provided 
directly to a customer-- does not create an unbounded GET 
                     
 35 (Quoting Travel Agency, Webster ’s Third New International 
Dictionary  2433 (unabr. 1993); Travel Agency, Merriam –Webster, 
http://www.merriam -webster.com/dictionary/travel%20agency (last visited Sept. 
17, 2014).)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
54 exemption.  The provision covers  only transactions  by a party 
whose business model centers on arranging travel services, and 
only when those services are rendered directly to the consumer 
by a third-party service provider with whom the proceeds are 
divided.   
 
 Such an interpretation avoids  the unequal tax 
treatment disfavoring travel facilitators that would result if 
this court were to apply ejusdem generis.  Many services 
commonly used by tourists would likely not qualify as primarily 
marketed or sold to tourists-- which is, as stated, the only 
clear commonality shared by all the enumerated examples of 
“tourism related services” included in HRS § 237 -18(f).  For 
example, spa or massage treatments are in all likelihood enjoyed 
by locals and tourists in similar measure.  Under an ejusdem 
generis interpretation of HRS § 237-18(f), a spa service sold 
directly to a customer by the spa provider would be subject to 
GET only once.  By contrast, the same spa service sold to a 
tourist for the same price as part of a package arranged by a 
travel agent would be taxed twice--once on the full amount 
tendered to the arranger
 and once on the amount remitted to the 
spa provider.   
  As discussed supra, the legislature enacted the 1991 
expansion of HRS § 237-18(f) that added the catch-all clause to 
the definition of tourism related services specifically to ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
55 correct “inequities [that] appear to exist in existing statutes 
regarding the assessment of the general excise tax on the 
revenues of travel- related companies.”   H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 
140, in 1991 House Journal, at 891.   It is apparent that 
applying the doctrine of ejusdem generis would produce a result 
that would be inconsistent with the legislative goal of 
promoting Hawai i tourism by providing special tax treatment to 
companies that facilitate travel to the State.   
  Given these indications of incompatibility, we decline 
to apply the doctrine of ejusdem generis, and instead interpret 
“tourism related services” in accordance with its plain text and 
legislative history 
to include all services rendered directly to 
customers that satisfy HRS § 237-18(f) ’s other requirements for 
GET apportionment.
  Accordingly, the provision of rental 
vehicles is a “tourism  related service” within the meaning of 
the statute, and the tax court erred by failing to apply GET 
apportionment to the assessed stand -alone rental car 
transactions.  
IV. CONCLUSION 
  Based on the foregoing discussion, we  hold that the 
claim preclusion component of res judicata is not an available 
defense against the government’s sovereign power of taxation, 
and all assessments in this case are therefore considered on the 
merits.  We further hold that car rentals are tourism related ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
56 services that qualify for GET apportionment under these 
circumstances.  Accordingly, we  vacate the tax court’s 
Stipulated Order and Final Judgment Disposing of All Issues and 
Claims of All Parties and remand this case for recalculation of 
the OTCs’ GET liability  and associated penalties and interest.
