OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
  This case arises from the Tax Appeal Court of the 
State of Hawaii’s dismissal of fourteen appeals of real property Electronically Filed
Supreme Court
SCAP-17-0000482
27-JUL-2018
08:16 AM***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
2 tax assessments as untimely filed.  The notices  of appeal were 
filed on Tuesday, January 17, 2017--the next business day 
following the January 15 deadline set by a county real property 
tax ordinance.  The tax court dismissed the appeals, reasoning 
that the county ordinance supersed ed the “weekend rule” 
established by Hawai i state law, which typically extends legal 
deadlines that would otherwise fall on a weekend or holiday to 
the following business day.  Although the January 15, 2017 
appeal deadline fell on a Sunday and was immediately followed by 
a State holiday, the tax court found that strict adherence to 
the deadline was required.  We conclude that the tax court erred 
in determining that the timeliness of the appeal was determined 
by county ordinance and not state law.  
II. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
 
 In 2015, the City Council of the City and County of 
Honolulu (the City) passed Bill 39 FD1 to amend Revised 
Ordinance of Honolulu (ROH ) § 8-1.16 (1990) to add an exception 
to the provision’s general rule extending legal deadlines 
falling on weekends and holidays  to the following business day.  
The addition provided that “[n]otwithstanding the foregoing, the 
due date for any appeal  shall comply with the jurisdictional 
requirements set forth in the law establishing the right to 
appeal.”  (Emphasis added.)   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
3   On December 19, 2016, Kalaeloa Ventures, LLC (KV) 
received notices of real property tax assessments (Assessment 
Notices) from the City for fourteen parcels.  Page 2 of each 
notice stated under “Important Dates to Remember” that the 
deadline for filing app eals was “January 15 (on or before).”  
The Assessment Notices further provided that the assessments 
could be appealed to the City’s board of review or the Tax 
Appeal Court of the State of Hawai i (tax court ).  Appeals to the 
board of review, it noted, could be filed  online, and the 
“[d]eadline to file is on or before January 15, 2017.  Any 
appeals submitted after January 15, 2017 will be subject to 
dismissal.”  (Emphasis omitted.)  Regarding appeals to the tax 
court, the Assessment Notices  provided as follows: “Appeals to 
the Tax Appeal Court are filed at 777 Punchbowl Street, 1st  
Floor, Honolulu, Hawaii, 96813,  on or before January 15 
preceding the tax year.”   
  January 15, 2017,  was a Sunday, and  January 16, 2017,  
was Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a state holiday.  The tax court 
clerk’s office was closed on both dates.  On January 17, 2017, 
KV filed a notice of appeal to the tax court for each of the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
4 fourteen parcels (collectively, Notices of Appeal) challenging 
the City’s Assessment Notices.1   
A. City’s Motions to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, Motion s 
for Summary Judgment  
  The City filed a “Motion to Dismiss, or in the 
Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment” for each of KV’s 
Notices of Appeal (collectively, the City’s Motion).   The City 
requested that the tax court dismiss KV’s Notices of Appeal with 
prejudice pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Hawai i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP), or, alternatively, grant summary judgment 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 56 for lack of subject matter 
jurisdiction.   
  T he City argued that KV did not timely file the 
Notices of Appeal on or before January 15, 2017, as required by 
ROH § 8-12.1(a)2 and Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 232-16.3  
                     
1 The merits of the grounds set forth in KV’s Notices of Appeal are 
not at issue in this appeal.   
 2 ROH § 8- 12.1(a) (1997) provides as follows:  
Any taxpayer or owner who may deem himself or herself 
aggrieved by an assessment made by the director or by the  
director’s refusal to allow any exemption, may appeal from 
the assessment or from such refusal to the board of review 
or the tax appeal court pursuant to HRS Section 232 -16 on 
or before January 15th preceding the tax year, as provided 
in this article.  
 3 HRS § 232 -16(a) (2017) provides in part as follows: “An appeal to 
the tax appeal court is properly commenced by filing, on or before the date 
fixed by law for the taking of the appeal, a written notice of appeal in the 
office of the tax appeal court.”  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
5 Anticipating KV’s counterarguments, the City contended that HRS 
§ 1-32,4 one of the statutory “weekend rules” allow ing acts that 
are legally required to be performed on a particular date to be 
done the next business day when the specified  day is a Sunday or 
a holiday, does not apply to filing real property tax assessment 
appeals.  The 2015 amendment of ROH § 8- 1.16 excluded these 
appeals from the weekend rule ’s operation , the City argued.   The 
amended ordinance made the deadline for perfecting appeals 
mandatory, the City asserted, and it thus could not be extended 
by the weekend rule.  
 
  
In addition, the City  submitted that, where a conflict 
between specific and general statutes cannot be resolved in pari 
materia, the county ordinances dealing specifically with the 
deadline for real property tax assessment appeals
--ROH §§ 8-
12.1(a) and 8-1.1 6--must prevail over the general weekend rule.    
                     
 4 HRS § 1-32 (2009) provides as follows:  
Whenever any act of a secular nature other than a work of 
necessity or mercy is appointed by law or contract to be 
performed upon a particular day, which day falls upon a 
Sunday or holiday, the act may be performed upon the next 
business day with the same effect as if it had been 
performed upon the appointed day.  When so provided by the 
rules of court, the act also may be performed upon the next 
business day with the same effect as if it had been 
performed upon the appointed day if the appointed day falls 
on a Saturday.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
6   T he City also asserted  that article VIII, section 3 of 
the Hawai i Constitution5 broadly grants  counties the exclusive 
authority over functions, powers, and duties relating to the 
taxation of real property, including the authority to set filing 
deadlines and any procedures relating to the filing of real 
property tax assessment appeals, so long 
as those deadlines and 
procedures do not violate the state or federal constitution.  
The City concluded that KV’s Notices of Appeal were untimely 
executed, filed, and served, and therefore the tax court lacked 
subject matter jurisdiction to hear the appeals.  
 
  KV opposed the City’s Motion, contend ing that the date 
for filing the Notices of Appeal extended to January 17, 2017, 
because HRS § 1-29,6 the weekend rule that sets forth the method 
                     
 5 Article VIII, section 3 of the Hawai i Constitution provides as 
follows:  
The taxing power shall be reserved to the State, except so 
much thereof as may be delegated by the legislature to the 
political subdivisions, and except that all functions, 
powers and duties relating to the taxation of real property  
shall be exercised exclusively by the counties , with the  
exception of the county of Kalawao.  The legislature shall 
have the power to apportion state revenues among the 
several political subdivisions.   
(Emphasis added.) 
 6 HRS § 1- 29 (2009) provides as follows:  
The time in which any act provided by law is to be done is 
computed by excluding the first day and including the last, 
unless the last day  is a Sunday or holiday and then it is 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
7 for computing deadlines, excludes Sundays and holidays from the 
computation of time.  Under this court’s precedent, KV argued, 
the City’s constitutional authority  has not been int erpreted to 
broadly extend to set ting filing deadlines and any procedures 
related to real property tax assessment appeals.  KV also 
asserted that the tax court’s subject matter jurisdiction 
derived from HRS § 232- 11.7  Based on precedent , the City did not 
have authority to expand or limit the jurisdiction of the tax 
court beyond that provided by state statute , KV contended.    
  KV alternately argued that, because  statutes related 
to the same subject matter must be construed together, statutes 
establishing filing deadline s must be read in conjunction with 
HRS § 1-29.  KV added that statutory deadlines must be 
interpreted in a manner that achieves  the intent of the 
legislature to provide a meaningful opportunity to appeal.   
                                                                               
(. . . continued) 
 
also excluded.  When so provided by the rules of court, the 
last day also shall be excluded if it is a Saturday.  
 7 HRS § 232 -11 (2017), “Court of record; general duties, powers, 
seal,” provides in relevant part as fo llows:  
The tax appeal court shall hear and determine appeals as 
provided in section 232 -16 or 232 -17.  It shall be a court 
of record; have jurisdiction throughout the State with 
respect to matters within its jurisdiction; and shall have 
the power and authority in the manner provided in section 
232-13, to decide all questions of fact and all questions 
of law, including constitutional questions, involved in any 
such matters, without the intervention of a jury.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
8   In reply, the City rejected KV’s argument that ROH § 
8-1.16 may be interpreted as allowing application of the weekend 
rule, contending that
 the ordinance provides  specificity in 
regard to the appeal filing deadline.  The City submitted that, 
because HRS § 1-32 conflicts with ROH § 8-1.16, the former does 
not apply here.   
B. Tax Court Hearing and Order  
  On May 1, 2017, the City’s Motion came  on for hearing 
before the tax court.8  The tax court consolidated the Notices  of 
Appeal for purposes of the hearing  and granted the City’s 
request for the matter to be considered only as a motion to 
dismiss and not as a motion for summary judgment.  The tax court 
stated that the dispositive issue in the case was w
hether the 
City had the constitutional authority to negate the weekend rule 
by ordinance as it relates to real property tax assessment 
appeals.  Construing ROH § 8- 12.1 together with ROH § 8- 1.16, 
the tax court noted that the City was “emphatic ” that all 
appeals must be filed on or before “and not after January 15.”   
  The tax court likened the case to State ex rel. Anzai 
v. City and County of Honolulu , 99 Hawai i 508, 57 P.3d 433 
(2002), which it interpreted “as providing or recognizing the 
superiority of the counties’ interest in real property tax.”  
                     
 8 The Honorable Gary Wong Bae Chang presided.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
9 Accordingly, the tax court explained that it “recognizes the 
constitutional principle of the superior power of the City to 
address matters of real property tax, ” noting that the counties 
do not have uniform appeals deadlines, “so there appears to  be 
at least some variation in terms of a county or the City’s 
interest in setting their real property tax deadlines.”    
  The tax court concluded that ROH § 8 -1.16 negated the 
statewide weekend rule as it applied to tax appeals  because the 
Hawaii Constitution grants  exclusive authority to the counties 
over real property tax assessments .  Therefore, the tax court 
held that KV’s Notices of Appeal were untimely and that the 
court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the cases.   On May 
30, 2017, the tax court entered orders  granting the City’s 
Motion as to each of KV’s Notices of Appeal  and dismissed the 
appeals with prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.   
  KV timely filed a notice of appeal from the tax 
court’s order granting the City’ s motion to dismiss, and the 
case was subsequently transferred to this court.   
III.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
  The interpretation of municipal ordinances “is a 
question of law reviewable de novo
.”  Weinberg v. City & Cty. of  
Honolulu , 82 Hawaii 317, 322, 922 P.2d 371, 376 (1996) (citation 
omitted).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
10   This court “ answer[s] questions of constitutional law 
by exercising our own independent judgment based on the facts of 
the case.”  State v. Aplaca , 96 Hawai i 17, 22, 25 P.3d 792, 797 
(2001) (quoting State v. Jenkins , 93 Hawai i 87, 100, 997 P.2d 
13, 26 (2000)).  Thus, “questions of constitutional law are 
reviewed on appeal ‘under the “ right/wrong ” standard.’”  Id. 
(quoting Jenkins, 93 Hawai i at 100, 997 P.2d at 26).   
IV. DISCUSSION 
  KV’s first t wo points of error on appeal contend that 
the tax court erred in concluding  that the City had 
constitutional authority to negate the statutory weekend rule by 
ordinance as it applies to real property tax assessment appeals, 
thereby rendering th e Notices of Appeal untimely filed.9  The 
City responds that ROH § 8-1.16 does not restrict the 
jurisdiction of the tax
 court granted by HRS § 232- 11 because 
ROH § 8-1.16 simply establishes that the weekend rule applies to 
only certain filings that do not include appeals.  Nonetheless, 
the City argues, even if ROH § 8- 1.16 does negate HRS §§ 1 -29 
and 1-32, the City has the authority to restrict the subject 
matter jurisdiction of the tax court as it relates to real 
property tax assessment appeals because the Hawaii Constitution 
                     
 9 In light of our disposition of the appeal in this case, we find 
it unnecessary to address KV’s other points of error.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
11 broadly confers all functions, powers, and duties related to 
real property tax assessment upon  the counties.   It is thus 
within the City’s constitutional authority, the City argues, to 
negate HRS §§ 1-29 and 1-32 by ordinance insofar as the statutes 
apply to real property tax assessment appeals.10   
  As stated, the City amend ed ROH § 8-1.16 in 2015 to  
read as follows:  
When the due date for any notice, application, document or 
remittance required by this chapter falls on a Saturday, 
Sunday or legal holiday, the notice, application, document 
or remittance shall not be due until the next succeeding 
day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the due date for any appeal 
shall comply with the jurisdictional requirements set forth 
in the law establishing the right to appeal.   
ROH § 8-1.16 (2015) (pertinent amendment underlined).   
  This court has held that “the right to appeal a tax 
assessment is purely statutory.”  Univ. of Haw. v. City & Cty. 
                     
 10 The Attorney General of the State of Hawai i submitted an amicus 
curiae brief on behalf of the State because the City has “draw n into 
question” the constitutionality of HRS §§ 1 -29 and 1- 32.  The State frames 
KV’s appeal as a challenge to whether the City has constitutional authority 
to limit the tax court’s jurisdiction over real property tax assessment 
appeals by negating application of the statutory weekend rule as it relates 
to real property tax assessment appeals.  The City does not have that 
authority, the State contends, because the state legislature is 
constitutionally empowered to establish the subject matter jurisdiction of 
the tax court.  (Citing Haw. Const. arts. III, VI.)  
  The State argues further that even if this court finds that the 
counties were granted authority over real property tax assessment appeals to 
the tax court through article VIII, section 3 of the Hawai i Constitution, 
that authority is limited by the reservation of power to the legislature to 
enact statutes of statewide concern in article VIII, section 6 of the Hawai i 
Constitution.  Because HRS §§ 1 -29 and 1- 32 are statutes of statewide 
concern, the State contends, ROH § 8 -1.16 is preempted insofar as it 
conflicts with them.  We do not find it necessary to address this argument.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
12 of Honolulu , 102 Hawai i 440, 444, 77 P.3d 478, 482 (2003).  HRS 
§ 232-16(a) (2017)11 establishes th e right to appeal  to the tax 
court, specifically providing that “ [a] taxpayer  . . . may 
appeal directly to the tax appeal court. ”12  Indeed, the ROH 
expressly recognize HRS § 232-16 as a statute governing appeals 
to the tax court by stating, “An appeal to the tax appeal court 
may be filed by a taxpayer or the director as provided in HRS 
Sections 232-8 through 232
-14 and Sections 232-16 through 232-
18.”  ROH § 12.8(a) (1983).  
                     
 11 HRS § 232 -16(a) provides in relevant part as follows:  
A taxpayer or county may appeal directly to the tax appeal 
court . . . An appeal to the tax appeal court is properly 
commenced by filing, on or before the date fixed by law for 
the taking of the appeal , a written notice of appeal in the 
office of the tax appeal court and by service of the notice 
of appeal on the director of taxation and, in the case of 
an appeal from a decision involving the county as a party, 
the real property assessment division of the county 
involved.  An appealing taxpayer shall also pay the costs 
in the amount fixed by section 232 -22. 
(Emphasis added.)  
 12 HRS § 232 -16 is part of HRS Chapter 232, which generally sets 
forth the statutes governing tax appeals to the tax court, the state boards 
of review, and a small claims court within the tax court.  See generally  HRS 
Chapter 232.  The chapter comprehensively provides for the judicial functions 
of the tax court.  HRS § 232 -11, inter alia, establishes that the tax court 
shall be a court of record and that it has the power to hear and determine 
appeals as provided in HRS § 232 -16.  HRS § 232 -11 (2017).  HRS § 232 -14(a) 
(2017) provides, inter alia, that the Supreme Court of Hawai i shall have the 
power to make rules relating to procedure in tax appeals and other process by 
the tax appeal court.  HRS Chapter 232 establishes two methods for 
challenging property assessments: appeals to a state or county board of 
review and appeals to the tax court.  HRS §§ 232 -15, 232- 17 (2017).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
13   HRS § 232- 16 also sets forth requirements for when and 
how appeals to the tax court will be taken, including the 
required contents of a notice of appeal
, the cost for filing an 
appeal,13 and the appropriate timeframe with in which  an appeal 
may commence.  “ An appeal to the tax appeal court is properly 
commenced by filing, on or before the date fixed by law for the 
taking of the appeal[. ]”  HRS § 232-16(a).  HRS § 232 -16(d) 
(2017) states that an appeal “shall be deemed to have been taken 
in time if . . . the notice shall have been deposited in the 
mail . .  . on or before the date fixed by law for the taking of 
the appeal.”   
  Pursuant to HRS § 232- 16, the counties have by 
ordinance set the date to take an appeal from a real property 
tax assessment.14  The City provided for such a date in ROH § 8-
12.1, which provides in pertinent part as follows :   
Any taxpayer or owner who may deem himself or herself 
aggrieved by an assessment made by the director or by the 
                     
 13 HRS § 232 -16 cross- references HRS § 23 2-22, which provides , “The 
nonrefundable costs to be deposited in any one case per taxpayer on any 
appeal to the tax appeal court shall be an amount set pursuant to rules 
adopted by the supreme court, which shall not exceed $100.”  HRS § 232 -22 
(2017).   
 14 For example, Maui County requires appeals to be filed with its 
board of review prior to being heard by the tax appeal court.  Maui County 
Code § 3.48.595 (2014).  Appeals must be filed on or before April 9 preceding 
the tax year.  Id.  Hawai i County also requires appeals to be filed on or 
before April 9 preceding the tax year.  Hawai i County Code § 19- 91 (2016).  
Kaua
i County requires appeals to be filed with the tax court on or before 
December 31 preceding the tax year.  Kaua i County Code § 5A -12.1 (2011).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
14 director’ s refusal to allow any exemption, may appeal from 
the assessment or from such refusal to the board of review 
or the tax appeal court pursuant to HRS Section 232 -16 on 
or before January 15th preceding the tax year , as provided 
in this article.  
ROH § 8-12.1(a) (1997) (emphasis added).  Therefore, HRS § 232-
16’s “date fixed by law”  as it relates to appeals of City real 
property tax assessments is “on or before January 15 th preceding 
the tax year.”  See  HRS § 232 -16; ROH § 8- 12.1.  
  In HRS Chapter 1 Title 1, the chapter pertaining to 
the construction of laws and common law, the legislature 
provided for extending deadlines when a date fixed by law on 
which an action must be performed falls on a non- business day--
that is, a Sunday, holiday, or, when provided  for by court 
rules, a Saturday.  See HRS §§ 1- 29, 1-32 (2009).  HRS § 1- 29 
provides that when computing the time in which any act provided 
by law is to be done, the last day is included in the 
computation of time unless it is a Sunday or a holiday: 
The time in which any act provided by law is to be done is 
computed by excluding the first day and including the last, 
unless the last day is a Sunday or holiday and then it is 
also excluded.   When so provided by the rules of court, the 
last day also shall be excluded if it is a Saturday.  
HRS § 1-29.  HRS § 1-32 correspondingly provides that any act 
that is appointed by law to occur on a Sunday or a legal holiday 
may be done with the same effect on the next business day 
following the Sunday or legal holiday: 
Whenever any act of a secular nature other than a work of 
necessity or mercy is appointed by law or contract to be 
performed upon a particular day, which day falls upon a 
Sunday or holiday, the act may be performed upon the next ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
15 business day with the same effect as if it had been 
performed upon the appointed day.   When so provided by the 
rules of court, the act also may be performed upon the next 
business day with the same effect as if it had been 
performed upon the appointed day if the appointed day falls 
on a Saturday.  
HRS § 1-32.  HRS §§ 1- 29 and 1 -32 by their plain language thus 
encompass all possible acts appointed by law to be done on a 
particular day.  Cf.  Allstate Ins. Co. v. Pruett , 118 Hawai i 
174, 181, 186 P.3d 609, 616 (2008) (“[B]y itself, the term ‘any 
person,’ ‘encompass[es]  every possible individual . . . . ’” 
(second alteration in original)  (citation omitted)).  
  
As noted, HRS § 232 -16 provides that an appeal from a 
real property tax assessment must be filed by the “date fixed by 
law,” which,  pursuant to ROH  § 8-12.1, is “on or before January 
15th preceding the tax year. ”  Therefore, HRS §§ 1- 29 and 1- 32 
by their plain terms apply t o the City’s “date fixed by law” for 
filing real property tax appeals as prescribed in ROH § 8- 12.1.   
  
Accordingly, when the Ci ty’s date fixed by law--
January 15 preceding the tax year-- falls on a Sunday or a 
holiday, an appeal may be filed with the tax court on the next 
business day with the same effect as if it had been filed upon 
the “appointed day. ”  See HRS §§ 1-29, 1-32, 232 -16.  In this 
case, KV’s Notices of Appeal were filed on Tuesday, January 17, 
2017, which was the next business day after Sunday, January 15, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
16 and the holiday on Monday, January 16.  Thus, pursuant to HRS §§ 
1-29 and 1-32, KV’s Notices of Appeal were tim ely filed.15   
  The City argues, however,  that it has the 
constitutional authority to determine the tax court’s 
jurisdiction by excluding real property tax assessment appeals 
to the tax court from application of the weekend rule.  This 
authority, according to the City, is derived from article VIII, 
section 3 of the Hawai i Constitution, which provides the 
following:  
Section 3 .  The taxing power shall be reserved to the 
State, except so much thereof as may be delegated by the 
legislature  to the political subdivisions, and except that 
all functions, powers and duties relating to the taxation 
of real property shall be exercised exclusively by the 
counties , with the exception of the county of Kalawao.  The 
legislature shall have the power to  apportion state 
revenues among the several political subdivisions.  
                     
 15 Citing Kin kaid v. Board of Review of the City & County of 
Honolulu, 106 Hawai i 318, 323 -24, 104 P.3d 905, 910 -11 (2004), the City 
contends that ROH § 8 -1.16 must prevail because it is a “specific” statute, 
unlike HRS §§ 1- 29 and 1 -32 which are of general concern, and the ordinance 
and statutes cannot be resolved in pari materia.  However, Kinkaid dealt with 
a conflict between two state statutes of coequal  authority--HRS § 232 -17, 
establishing the right to appeal to the tax court from a decision of a state 
or county board of review, and HRS § 91 -14(a), granting a right of appeal to 
the circuit court from a state or county board of review decision.  Kinkaid, 
106 Hawai i at 323, 104 P.3d at 910.  By contrast, here a county ordinance is 
in conflict with a state statute.  Under such circumstances, the appropriate 
analysis is one of sovereign preemption--and not the reconciliation of a 
specific statute with a  general statute--because HRS §§ 1 -29 and 1 -32 are 
statutes of statewide concern  that take precedence over the enactments of the 
State’s political subdivisions .  See Richardson v. City & Cty. of Honolulu , 
76 Hawai i  46, 66, 868 P.2d 1193, 1213 (1994) (“Thus, if an ordinance truly 
conflicts with Hawai i  statutory law that is of statewide concern, then it is 
necessarily invalid because it violates article VIII, section 6 of the Hawai i  
Constitution and HRS § 50 –15--the state’ s supremacy provisions. ”).   Kin
kaid 
is therefore inapposite.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
17 Haw. Const. art. VIII, § 3 (emphases added).   
  “In interpreting constitutional  provisions, ‘[t]he 
general rule is that, if the words used in a constitutional 
provision . . . are clear and unambiguous, they are to be 
construed as written.’”   Everson v. State , 122 Hawai i 402, 407,  
228 P.3d 282, 28 7 (2010) ( alterations in original) (quoting 
Watland v. Lingle , 104 Hawai i 128, 139, 85 P.3d 1079, 1090 
(2004)).  Here, article VIII, section 3 does not provide the 
City with authority to define the jurisdiction of the tax court 
when the tax court exercises its judicial power to review real 
property tax assessments imposed by the City.   This judicial 
power is derived from article VI, section 1 of the Hawai i 
Constitution, which establishes the power of the judiciary:  
Section 1.  The judicial power of the State shall be vested 
in one supreme court, one intermediate appellate court, 
circuit courts, district courts and in such other courts as 
the legislature may from time to time establish.  The 
several courts shall have original and appellate 
jurisdiction as provided by law  and shall establish time 
limits for disposition of cases in accordance with their 
rules.[16]  
Haw. Const. art. VI, § 1 (emphasis added).  This constitutional 
provision does not provide an exception allowing the City to 
                     
 16 Article III, section 1 of the Hawai i Constitution vests 
legislative power of the State in a legislature, which extends to “all 
rightful subjects of legislation not inconsistent” with the federal and state 
constitutions, including the authority to establish the subject matter 
jurisdiction of the courts under article VI, section 1.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
18 define the state tax court’s jurisdiction whenever it consider s 
appeals of real property tax assessments.   
  
In addition, article VIII of the Hawai i Constitution, 
entitled “L ocal Government, ” prov ides in section 6,  “This 
article shall not limit the power of the legislature to enact 
laws of statewide concern.”  Haw. Const. art. VIII, § 6 .  Thus, 
article VIII reserves the State legislature ’s power to enact 
laws of statewide concern even where powers, functions,  and 
duties have been given to the counties.  The tax court, which is  
established by statute, is a statewide court, and therefore its 
jurisdiction is inherently a matter of statewide concern.   
  Even assuming an ambiguity exists in these  
constitutional provisions , this court has “repeatedly held that 
the fundamental principle in construing a constitutional 
provision is to give effect to the intention of the framers and 
the people adopting it.”  Everson, 122 Hawai i at 407, 228 P.3d 
at 287 (quoting Pray v. Judicial Selection Comm’n of the State  
of Haw., 75 Haw. 333, 343, 861 P.2d 723, 728 (1993)).  In 
determining the intention of the framers and the people adopting  
the constitution, this court may look to constitutional history 
and the legislative implementation of the constitutional 
amendment.  Id.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
19 The constitutional history of article VIII, section  3 
indicates that the Local Government Committee preferred the 
provision’s current language --granting the counties power over 
“all functions, powers and duties relating to the taxation of 
real property”--over the amendment’s original proposed language , 
which afforded counties “the power to levy a tax on real 
property.”  The report of the Committee of the Whole indicates 
the change was made in order to “clarify the [Local Government] 
standing committee’s intent to grant all taxing powers relating 
to real property to the counties.”  Comm. of the Whole Rep. No. 
7, in 1 Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of Hawai i 
of 1978, at 1008 (1980).  Although  the Local Government 
Committee expressed in its standing committee report that a 
general grant of taxing powers to the counties would include the 
(presumably administrative) adjudication of appeals,17 there is 
                     
 17 The Local Government Committee Report states in relevant part as 
follows:  
 
Presently, under the Hawaii Revised Statutes, the State is 
responsible for assessing all real property in the State 
that is subject to the payment of real property taxes, and 
for levying and collecting all such taxes, and adjudicating 
taxpayer appeals.  Basic policies defining real property, 
setting the basis of assessment, determining the manner in 
which rates are set, setting exemptions  and describing the 
appeals process are the responsibility of state 
lawmakers.  . . . A general grant of taxing powers to the 
counties would include: a) assessments of property, b) 
adjudications of appeals, c) levying of tax rates, d) 
collections of taxes and e) formulation of basic policies.   
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
20 no indication--and the City does not argue-- that the authority 
was meant to divest the state tax court of its then-existing 
jurisdiction over real property tax appeals.18  In short, there 
is nothing in the Local Government Committee ’s standing report , 
the committee report of the Committee of the Whole, or the final 
language adopted in article VIII, section 3 of the Hawai i 
Constitution to suggest the provision was intended to allow the 
counties to limit the state tax court ’s jurisdiction  over real 
property tax appeals at their  discretion.  
  The framers also provided for a period of transition 
in article XVIII, section 6 of the Hawai i Constitution
 as 
authority over real property taxation transferred from the State 
to the counties.  
This provision provided that article VIII, 
                                                                               
(. . . continued) 
 
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 42, in 1 Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention 
of Hawai i of 1978, at 594 -95 (1980).  When the constitutional amendment was 
drafted, the two venues for adjudicating real property tax assessment appeals 
were state boards of review and the tax court.  HRS § 232 -15 (1967); HRS § 
232-16 (1963).  While the ultimate authority to review tax appeals has 
remained with the State, HRS § 232 -16(a) now provides “that a taxpayer 
appealing a real property  tax assessment shall first obtain a decision from 
an administrative body established by county ordinance, prior to appealing to 
the tax appeal court, if county ordinance requires a taxpayer to do so.”  
 18 Notwithstanding its argument that the counties were 
constitutionally granted exclusive authority over matters pertaining to real 
property taxation, the City  contrarily relies upon HRS § 232 -16(d) and Rule 
2(a) of the R ules of the Tax Court (RTAC)  to argue that KV’s Notices of 
Appeal would have been timely if postmarked on January 15 by an in -house 
postage machine.  In relying upon HRS § 232 -16 and RTAC Rule 2(a) as the 
authorities that establish the timeliness of an appeal, the City undermines 
its argument that the tax court’s jurisdiction as  it relates to appeals from 
City real property tax assessments is determined by City ordinances.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
21 section 3 of the Hawai i Constitution would take effect two years 
after ratification, with an additional eleven- year transition 
period during which policies related to real property taxation 
would be uniform throughout the state.19   
  In 1980, pursuant to article XVIII, section 6 of the 
Hawaii Constitution, the legislature passed House Bill (H.B. ) 
2193-80, enacted as Act 279 (1980) and codified as HRS Chapter 
246A, to transfer real property taxation from the State to the 
counties.20  1980 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 279, § 6 at 533-36; State 
ex rel. Anzai v. City & Cty. of Honolulu , 99 Hawai i 508, 511, 57  
                     
 19 Article XVIII, section 6 provides in pertinent part as follows:  
 
The amendment to Section 3 of Article VIII shall take 
effect on the first day of July after two full calendar 
years have elapsed following the ratification of such 
amendment [November 7, 1978]; provided that for a period of 
eleven years following such ratification, the policies and 
methods of assessing real property taxes shall be uniform 
throughout the State and shall be established by agreement 
of a majority of the political subdivisions.   
 20 HRS § 246A -1 (repealed) provided the purpose of the chapter as  
follows:  
Purpose.  The legislature finds that section 3 of article 
VIII of the constitution of the State has been amended to 
provide that all functions, powers, and duties relating to 
the taxation of real property heretofore reserved to the 
State shall be exercised exclusively by the counties with 
the exception of the County of Kalawao.  It is the purpose 
of this chapter to provide for the orderly transfer of 
these functions, powers, and duties, including the transfer 
of personnel, records, and equipment to the counties.  
HRS § 246A- 1 (repealed by 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 52, § 8 at 85 -86).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
22 P.3d 433, 436 (2002).  Regarding appeals, Act 279, section 6 
read as follows:  
The right of appeal from  administrative actions or 
determinations as now provided by law shall not be impaired  
by this Act .  
 
Each of the counties shall by ordinance provide for appeals 
from assessments, denial of an exemption, or the denial of 
a dedication to the same extent and in accordance with the 
procedures prescribed in chapter 232, Hawaii Revised 
Statutes.  
1980 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 279,  § 6 at 536 (emphases added).  Act 
279 thus preserved then- existing rights of appeal,  including  the 
right to appeal to the tax court from a real property tax 
assessment.  The right to appeal was found then, as it is today, 
in HRS § 232-16.  
  Separate and apart from the existing right of appeal 
to the tax court, 
the House Standing Committee Report on H.B. 
2193-80 (Act 279) expressly noted that the constitution granted 
the counties authority to establish an appeals process by county 
ordinance, but the committee distinguished that appeals process 
from the existing tax court appeals procedure:   
[P]rovision has been made to provide that appeals from 
assessments, denial of exemptions, or denial of dedication 
may be made under an appeals process established by county 
ordinance or may be made to the appropriate state court as 
is now the law.  It is the feeling of your Committee that 
the counties not only have the power to 
establish such an 
appeals process, but that they are mandated to do so by the 
provisions of this bill and the constitution transferring 
the real property tax function to the counties.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
23 H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 422- 80, in 1980 House Journal, at 
1461.21  The Committee thus appears to have envisioned the 
continuation of two forums for filing real property tax 
assessment appeals, with authority granted  to the counties to 
establish boards of review to take initial appeals from real 
property tax assessments in place of existing s tate boards of 
review, and the tax court retaining ultimate appellate 
jurisdiction.  In addition, comparing H.B. No. 2193-80 w ith its 
Senate companion bill, Senate Bill No. 2219-80, the Senate 
Standing Committee on Intergovernmental Relations noted the 
distinction between the forums for appeal: “Both [bills] permit 
appeals to the State court system in disputes.”  S. Stand. Comm. 
Rep. No. 824-80, in 1980 Senate Journal, at 1409.  The committee 
reports indicate that the legislature did not consider the 
“functions, powers and duties relating to real property 
taxation” to include authority  over the jurisdiction of the tax 
court as it relates to real property tax assessment appeals and 
that the committees intended the appellate jurisdiction of the 
tax court to continue as it did prior to the implementation of 
article VIII, section 3 of the Hawai i Constitution.  
                     
 21 The City quotes this committee report in support of its argument 
that HRS § 246A- 4 (Act 279, § 6) granted the City authority over the 
jurisdiction of the tax court as it relates to real property tax appeals.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
24   The  following year,  the legislature enacted Act 78 
(1981), which amended HRS § 246A -4 to clarify the transition 
process for real property tax appeals pending before the state 
boards of review and to allow for the boards’  decisions to 
continue to be appealed to the tax court as provided in HRS 
Chapter 232.22  Thus, after July 1, 1981, appeals from real 
property tax assessments could be made to the county- established 
boards of review or to the tax court pursuant to HRS § 246A- 4 
(repealed).23  As stated , although the legislature provided for a 
transition from the state boards of review to  the county-
                     
 22 Act 78 amended HRS § 246A -4, Appeals, to read ,  
The right of appeal from administrative actions or 
determinations as now provided by law shall not be impaired 
by this chapter.  
 
Each of the counties shall by ordinance provide for appeals 
from assessments, denial of an exemption, or the denial of 
a dedication.  
 
For purposes of this transfer, all appeals from the 
assessment of real property taxes made to the various 
boards of taxation review, all appeals from  the denial of 
an exemption made to such boards, and every other appeal 
made to such boards prior to July 1, 1981, shall continue 
to be heard and decided by the board of taxation review for 
the taxation district in which the appeals have been made.  
The jurisdiction of all such boards to hear and decide the 
appeal shall extend and continue over such matters until 
decision is filed with the assessor as provided in section 
232-7.  Any such decision made by the board may be appealed 
to the tax appeal court as provided in chapter 232.  
HRS § 246A- 4 (repealed); see 1981 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 78, § 1 at 108 -09. 
 23 Act 78 also removed the requirement in Act 279 that the counties’ 
provision of a right to appeal from assessments established by ordinance must 
be to the same extent and in accordance with HRS Chapter 232.  1981 Haw. 
Sess. Laws Act 78, § 1 at 108 -09. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
25 established boards of review, the legislature did not discuss or 
provide for a transition of control over the tax court’s 
jurisdiction to the counties with respect to real property tax 
assessment appeals, indicating that such divesting of authority 
was not contemplated.24   
  At the end of the eleven- year transition period, the 
legislature enacted amendments to various statutory provisions 
to further facilitate the transfer of matters involving real 
property taxation to the counties.  1989 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, 
§ 9 at 42.  Act 14 amended HRS § 232-16(a) to read as follows: 
A taxpayer or county [may], in all cases, may appeal 
directly to the tax appeal court without appealing to [the] 
a state board of review , or any equivalent administrative 
body established by county ordinance,  by filing on or 
before the date fixed by law for the taking of the appeal.   
1989 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, § 9 at 42 (material to be deleted 
bracketed and additions underlined).  Act 14 also made changes 
to other sections within HRS C hapter 232 to include references 
to an “equivalent administrative body established by county 
ordinance” and to state-established boards of review.  See, 
e.g., 1989 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, §§ 10- 11 at 43.  As 
discussed, no provision was made or discussed for a transfer of 
control over the jurisdiction of the tax court as it relates to 
                     
 24 See S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 806, in 1981 Senate Journal, at 
1257; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 295, in 1981 House Journal, at 1061; H. Stand.
Comm. Rep. No. 578, in 1981 House Journal, at 1179.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
26 real property tax assessment appeals.  The same  was true in 
2011, when the legislature enacted Act 106 amending HRS § 232-
16(a) to enable the counties to require a taxpayer to appeal a 
real property tax assessment to a county board of review prior 
to filing an appeal with the tax court.25  2011 Haw. Sess. Laws 
Act 106, § 1 at 277- 78.   
  In 2016, the legislature further amended and repealed 
statutory provisions relating to real property taxation that 
were unnecessary or obsolete due to the constitutional transfer 
of real property taxation to the counties.  2016 Haw. Sess. Laws 
Act 52, § 1 at 87.  Among the provisions repealed was HR S § 246-
46, which set forth the date for appeals of real property tax 
assessments to both the state boards of review and the tax 
court.26  2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 52,  § 7 at 88.   
  Accordingly, t
he legislative history of the statutes 
implementing article VIII, section 3 of the Hawai i Constitution 
                     
 25 The purpose of H.B. 1532 (2011), subsequently enacted as Act 106, 
was to reduce the number of appeals to the tax court by requiring taxpayers 
to, if required by county ordinance, first appeal to the applicable county  
board of review for an initial decision from that body prior to appealing to 
the tax appeal court.  S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 888, in 2011 Senate Journal, 
at 1160.   
 26 HRS § 246 -46 (repealed) provided in pertinent part as follows:  
Any taxpayer who may deem oneself aggrieved by an 
assessment made by the assessor or by the assessor’s 
refusal to allow any exemption, may appeal from the 
assessment or from such refusal to a board of review or the 
tax appeal court, on or before April 9 preceding the tax 
year, as provided in chapter 232.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
27 does not indicate that  authority  over the jurisdiction of the 
tax court was granted to the counties.  A review of our caselaw 
leads to a similar conclusion. 
  In 
University of Hawai i v. City &  County of Honolulu , 
this court held that counties require statutory authority to 
expand the jurisdiction of the tax court.  See 102 Hawai i at 
444-45, 77 P.3d at 482-83.   We concluded that the University of 
Hawaii did not have standing to appeal from a real property tax 
assessment as an “owner” of the assessed property , pursuant to 
ROH § 8-12.1 (1987), because ROH § 8-12.1 expanded the right of 
appeal beyond that provided for by the ordinance’s enabling 
statute, HRS § 232-16 (2003).27  Id. at 441, 77 P.3d at 479.  In 
our analysis, we stated that because the right to appeal a tax 
assessment is purely statutory, “whether a person challenging an 
assessment bears such a relation to the real property being 
assessed as to entitle that person the right to appeal is 
determined by the applicable statutes.”  Id. at 444, 77 P.3d at 
482 (quoting Maile Sky Court Co. v. City & Cty. of Honolulu , 85 
Hawaii 36, 39, 936 P.2d 672, 675 (1997)).   Thus, while “the 
                     
 27 The ordinance in question, ROH § 8 -12.1 (1987), provided in 
pertinent part that “[a]ny taxpayer or owner  . . . may appeal the assessment 
. . . to the board of review or tax appeal court pursuant to HRS Section 232 -
16.”  HRS § 232- 16 (2001), however, only extended the right to appeal to a 
taxpayer or county.  Univ. of Haw., 102 Hawai i at 441 n.1, 77 P.3d at 479 n.1 
(citing HRS § 232 -16 (2001)).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
28 exclusive taxation authority of the State director over real 
property was turned over to the counties under an amendment to 
the Hawai i Constitution . . . the authority to oversee and 
create laws for tax appeals remains with the State director.”  
Id. at 445 n.12, 77 P.3d at 483 n.12.  Accordingly, absent 
statutory authority, the City could not expand to an “owner” the 
right of appeal to the tax court from a real property tax 
assessment pursuant to HRS § 232-16.  See id. at 444-45, 77 P.3d 
at 482-83.   
  In ruling upon the City’s Motion, t he tax court relied 
on our holding in Anzai as “providing or recognizing the 
superiority of the counti es’ interest in real property tax.”   In 
Anzai, this court upheld a county ordinance that removed an 
exemption from taxation of real property leased to the State if 
the lease terms required the State to pay taxes on the leased 
property (the Exemption).  99 Hawai i at 510-13, 57 P.3d at  435-
38.  We found that the State impermissibly infringed on the 
county’s constitution al authority by enacting a statute 
requiring the county  to maintain the Exemption for the 1996- 97 
tax year.  Id. at 520-22, 57 P.3d at 445-47.  HRS § 246A- 2(2), 
which required the counties to maintain uniform exemptions 
during the eleven-year transfer of power, had lapsed, we noted, 
when the county enacted its ordinance removing the Exemption and ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
29 thus, based on the facts of the case, the county ordinance 
controlled over the state statute.  Id. at 520 -21, 57 P.3d at 
445-46.  We stated,  
Simply put, the Constitution obligated the County to 
maintain the Exemption for eleven years, after which period  
the County was free to exercise its exclusive authority to 
increase, diminish, enact, or repeal any exemptions 
involving real property taxes without interference by  the 
legislature.  To argue, as the State does, that the 
Exemption is a matter of statewide concern is to ignore the  
fact that the framers of the amendment clearly understood 
real property taxation powers, including the power to  
create or repeal exemptions, as matters of local concern.  
Id. at 521, 57 P.3d at 446.  In rejecting the State’s argument 
that the Exemption was a matter of statewide concern, this  court 
pointed to the amendment’s constitutional history, which 
demonstrated the framers ’ clear intent that exemptions were a  
matter of local concern included in the transfer of real 
property taxation power.  Id. at 521-22, 57 P.3d at 446- 47.  
Here, however, the constitutional history of the amendment does  
not demonstrate  a clear intent on the part of the framers to  
transfer to the counties control over the jurisdiction of the  
statewide tax court as it relates to real property tax 
assessment appeals.    
  Taken together,  under a plain meaning reading of  
applicable constitutional provisions; the constitutional history 
of article VIII, section 3 of the Hawai i Constitution;  the 
legislative history of its implementing legislation;  and 
relevant caselaw, article VIII, section 3 of the Hawai i ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
30 Constitution does not grant the counties authority to restrict 
or expand the tax court’s jurisdiction .  This authority is  
reserved to the State as a function of the legislative power to 
enact laws of statewide concern.   Thus, the City does  not have 
the constitutional authority to negate via ordinance the 
statutory weekend rule as it applies to the tax court’s  
jurisdiction, and KV’s  Notices of Appeal were therefore timely 
filed.28   
V. CONCLUSION 
  Based on the foregoing, the tax court’s May 30, 2017 
order granting the City Council of the City and County of 
Honolulu’s motion to dismiss or in the alternative, motion for 
                     
 28 It is noted that if this court interpreted article VIII, section 
3 of the Hawai i Constitution to grant counties control over the procedure of 
the tax court, such an interpretation would require the state tax court to 
potentially have four sets of internal procedures to govern each county’s 
appeals.  Any county could change its ordinances at any time, creating 
procedural confusion in the court and requiring the tax court to interpret 
county ordinances that would control state court procedural rules.  This 
would be contrary to the statewide jurisdiction of the tax court and this 
court’s authority to make rules relating to the tax court’s procedure 
pursuant to HRS § 232 -14 and article VI, section 7 of the Hawai i 
Constitution.  
  Additionally, if, as the City purports, the “functions, powers 
and duties relating to the taxation of real property” conferred on the 
counties included those related to the tax court, then the “functions, powers 
and duties” of the tax court could only be exercised “exclusively” by the 
counties.  Thus, the tax court could not function in accordance with HRS 
Chapter 232, the Rules of the Tax Court, and other applicable rules 
promulgated by this court.  Further, the historical use of the tax court as a 
forum for appeals of real property tax assessments would be unconstitutional 
because the functions, powers, and duties of the tax court were not 
“exclusively” exercised by the counties.  This court construes legislation to 
avoid illogical, impractical, and absurd  results.  See Morgan v. Planning 
Dep’t, Cty. of Kauai, 104 Hawai i 173, 185, 86 P.3d 982, 994 (2004).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
31 summary judgment is vacated,  and the case is remanded to the tax 
court for further proceedings to consider the merits of the tax 
assessment appeals.
