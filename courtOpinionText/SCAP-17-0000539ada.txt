OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J. 
 INTRODUCTION I.
  In our previous decision in this case, A.A. v. B.B. , 
139 Hawai i 102, 384 P.3d 878 (2016), we vacated the final 
judgment of the family court denying the petition of A.A. 
(hereafter W.N.) for joint custody of a minor child with B.B. 
(hereafter S.M.).  The case was remanded to the family court 
with instructions that it determine whether W.N. established a Electronically Filed

2 prima facie case of de facto custody,  and if so, that the court 
render a custody award in the child’s best interest.   
  On remand, the family court entered an order without 
holding a further evidentiary hearing or taking additional 
evidence in which it found that W.N. was  not a “fit and proper 
person” as required to establish a prima facie entitlement to  
custody of the minor child.  W.N. appealed the family court’s 
adverse ruling,  and the request to transfer the case to this 
court was granted .  We conclude that the family court erred in 
not holding a further hearing to ascertain whether W.N. is 
presently a fit and proper person and whether a custody award 
would be in the minor child’s present best interests .  
Accordingly, we vacate the family court’s 2017 Order and remand 
the case for a further evidentiary hearing consistent with this 
opinion.  We also provide guidance as to evidentiary matters 
that may arise on remand. 
 FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY II.
  W.N. and S.M. entered into a committed relationship in 
March 2009.  In 2011, W.N. and S.M. jointly decided to bring 
S.M.’s newborn biological granddaughter (Ch ild) into their home 
to raise her as their daughter.  S.M. legally adopted Child, and 
S.M. and W.N. jointly shared parental care, duties, and 
responsibilities for Child.  W.N., S.M., Chil d, and S.M.’s 
teenage son (Son) lived together as a family unit from October ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
3 2011 until October 2013.  In October 2013, W.N. and S.M. 
separated, and they entered into a written 50/50 co-parenting 
agreement for Child.  In April 2014, S.M. sent W.N. a letter 
declaring that he was revoking the 50/50 co- parenting agreement 
on the basis that it was his parental right to do so.   
  In  May 2014, W.N. filed a petition in the Family Court 
of the Third Circuit (family court)  seeking joint legal and 
joint 50/50 physical custody of Child (custody p etition)  
pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-46(a)(2) (Supp. 
2013).1  W.N. asserted that he was the de facto parent of Child 
and was a fit and proper person to have care, custody, and 
control of Child.  S.M. sought dismissal of the custody petition 
                     
 1 HRS § 571 -46(a) provides in relevant part as follows:  
(a) In actions for divorce, separation, annulment, separate 
maintenance, or any other proceeding where there is at 
issue a dispute as to the custody of a minor child, the 
court, during the pendency of the action, at the final 
hearing, or any time during the minority of the child, may 
make an order for the custody of the minor child as may 
seem necessary or proper.  In awarding the custody, the 
court shall be guided by the following standards, 
considerations, and procedures:  
 (1) Custody should be awarded to either parent or to 
both parents according to the best interests of the 
child, and the court also may consider frequent, 
continuing, and meaningful contact of each parent 
with the child unless the court finds that a parent 
is unable to act in the best interest of the child;  
 (2) Custody may be awarded to persons other than the 
father or mother whenever the award serves the best 
interest of the child.  Any person who has had de 
facto custody of the child in a stable and wholesome 
home and is a fit and proper person shall be entitled 
prima facie to an award of custody[.]  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
4 contending that W.N. was a legal stranger to Child, that HRS § 
571-46(a)(2) was unconstitutional, and that W.N. had no standing 
before the family court.  
 
 On October 3, 2014, the family court held an 
evidentiary hearing on the custody petition  (2014 Hearing).2  
Scott and Janet Crosier (collectively, the Crosiers) testified 
that each had supervised visitations between W.N. and Child,  and 
they favorably described the interactions between W.N. and 
Child.  W.N. sought to introduce the visitation reports into 
evidence that the Crosiers had each prepared contemporaneously 
with the supervised visitation
s.  The family court sustained 
S.M.’s objections to their admission because they contained 
hearsay statements of Child, rejecting W.N.’s argument that the 
statements were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted 
by Child.  The court also sustained S. M.’s foundation objection s 
to the Crosiers using their respective visitation reports to 
refresh their recollections.  As to Janet Crosier, W.N. 
proffered 
that the reports would aid her in recalling Child’s 
behaviors and interactions with W.N. that she could not 
remember.   
  Dr.  Jamuna Wyss, who was qualified as an expert in  
parent-child psychological relationships and parenting styles, 
                     
 2 The Honorable Melvin H. Fujino presided.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
5 testified that he taught W.N. parenting techniques.  Dr. Wyss 
testified favorably as to W.N.’s relationship with Child .  He 
also testified that Child would likely suffer “damaging 
psychological consequences” if W.N.’s relationship with Child 
was terminated.  W.N.’s counsel asked Dr. Wyss if he was aware 
of any sexual abuse allegations against W.N. and sought to 
introduce a letter written by Dr. Wyss to Child Welfare 
Services.  The court sustained S.M.’s objection to the admission  
of the letter and did not allow Dr. Wyss to testify as to his 
opinion on the allegations because it was outside the scope of 
his April 25, 2014 clinical note (clinical note).3  Dr. Wyss then 
testified generally that he did not believe W.N. posed any 
threat to Child.   
  Additionally, W.N. sought to introduce progress notes 
from his individual 
therapy se ssions with Dr. Wyss, as well as 
S.M. and W.N.’s couples therapy se ssions with Dr. Wyss.  The 
court again sustained S.M.’s objection to the introduction of 
the progress notes as outside the scope of Dr. Wyss’s clinical 
note.  Further, Dr. Wyss testified that he taught W.N. anger 
                     
3 S.M.’s counsel objected on the basis that the parties agreed to 
exchange reports prepared by the expert witnesses prior to the hearing and as 
such, the testimony should be limited to Dr. Wyss’s report--the April 25, 
2014 clinical note.  The record does not contain an on -the-record pretrial 
ruling limiting expert testimony to the contents of the experts’ reports.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
6 management techniques4 and related that, in his opinion, W.N. had 
made progress on anger management.5   
  Dr. Jennifer De Costa, a family counselor and a 
licensed marriage and family therapist, was called by S.M.  and 
qualified as an expert in family behavior and relationships.  
Dr. De Costa testified that she had treated Son and regularly 
used written tests to assess Son’s depression and anxiety in 
treatment.  Dr. De Costa stated that she observed a correlation 
between fluctuations in Son’s test scores and his interactions 
with W.N.  S.M. asked Dr. De Costa if Son had displayed “extreme 
regression” since W.N. began visitation with Child, and Dr. De 
Costa responded affirmatively.   
  Dr. De Costa testified that she also met w
ith Child 
and initially had no concerns as to Child’s developm ent.  After 
visits started with W.N., however, Dr. De Costa stated that 
Child began to exhibit “some regressive behaviors.”  Dr. De 
Costa answered “yes” when asked hypothetically whether she would 
have concerns about Child having a custodial relationship with 
W.N. given his anger management problem,  her knowledge of W.N.’s 
relationship with Son,  and Child’s regressive behaviors.  Dr. De 
                     
 4 W.N. testified that his anger management problem is characterized 
by raising his voice, swearing, and walking away to cool off.   
 5 Dr. Wyss indicated that his opinion on W.N.’s anger management 
progress relied on W.N.’s self -reporting.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
7 Costa further testified that she did not think that termination 
of the relationship would harm Child. 
  S.M. also called W.N.’s sister, C.N., to testify.  
C.N. testified that she had concerns about W.N.’s temper , which 
she had expressed to S.M.,  and that W.N.’s behavior had not 
improved. 
  After  the parties ’ arguments, the family court ruled 
that W.N. had not shown a compelling state interest as to why 
the de facto custody presumption of HRS § 571 -46(a)(2) should 
apply to him under a strict scrutiny standard .  The family court 
denied the custody petition and a llowed S.M. to stop all 
visitations.  On December 11, 2014, the family court entered 
findings of fact, conclusions of law, and its final judgment on 
the custody petition. 
 
 W.N. appealed,  and following transfer of the case to 
this court, we held that application of HRS § 571- 46(a)(2) would 
not infringe upon S.M.’s fundamental liberty interests or right 
to privacy under the Hawai i Constitution, and that W.N. was 
therefore not required to establish a compelling state interest 
as a prerequisite 
for the family  court to make a de facto 
custody determination.  A.A. v. B.B. , 139 Hawai i 102, 108 , 113-
16, 384 P.3d 878, 884, 889 -92 (2016).  We noted that the record 
may support a finding that W.N. satisfied all elements of HRS § 
571-46(a)(2), which would invoke the de facto custody ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
8 presumption.  Id. at 107 n.8, 384 P.3d at 883 n.8.  
Additionally, although this court held that any error by the 
family court in restricting Dr. Wyss’s testimony or excluding 
the progress notes was harmless under the circumstances, we 
stated that “if further evidentiary proceedings are held on 
remand, the family court may revisit its ruling regarding the 
proffered evidence.”6  Id. at 116 n.23, 384 P.3d at 892 n.23.  We 
vacated the final judgment denying W.N.’s cus tody petition and 
remanded the case to the family court with instructions that the 
court determine whether W.N. met the requirements for a de facto 
custody presumption pursuant to HRS § 571- 46(a)(2), and if so, 
for a custody award in the child’s best inter est.  Id. at 116-
17, 384 P.3d at 892-93. 
  At  a status conference following remand, the family 
court indicated that it would limit its review to the existing 
record and invited the parties to provide briefing on whether it 
had authority for such limitation.7  W.N. submitted a memorandum 
arguing that there was sufficient evidence in  the record to 
determine that he met the elements for a de facto custody 
                     
 6 As to other evidentiary issues raised by W.N. , this court held 
that Dr. De Costa was properly qualified as an expert in her field and the 
family court did not err in accepting her testimony.  A.A., 139 Hawai i at 116 
n.23, 384 P.3d at 892 n.23.

remand.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
9 presumption and that an award of joint custody of Child to him 
would be in the best interests of Child.  In the alternative, if 
the family court did not find that there was sufficient evidence 
to establish a de facto custody presumption, W.N. argued that an 
evidentiary hearing was necessary to supplement the 2014 Hearing 
record.  In support, W.N. contended that his arguments and 
evidence presented at the 2014 Hearing were not focused on the 
elements of HRS § 571
-46(a)(2) because the family court 
requested briefing on whether W.N. had a constitutional right 
and a statutory basis to assert a custodial claim.  
  W.N. maintained that it would be error for the family 
court to conclude that he failed to meet his burden to establish 
that he is a “fit and proper person” without an opportunity to 
supplement the record,  particularly in light of this court’s 
observation that the record may support a finding that W.N. met 
all the elements of HRS § 571- 46(a)(2).  W.N. also argued that 
the family court foreclosed him from presenting evidence from 
Dr. Wyss to rebut allegations of sexual abuse that were used to 
determine W.N.’s fitness for custody.  W.N. further argued that 
it would be a manifest injustice for the family court not to 
consider new evidence on remand regarding W.N.’s fitness for 
custody.  As an offer of proof, W.N. stated that since the 2014 
Hearing, he had obtained a State of Hawaii Department of Human ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
10 Services foster care license, for which he underwent a 
psychosexual evaluation. 
  S.M. filed a memorandum in support of limiting the 
family court’s review on remand to the existing record.  S.M. 
argued that whether or not W.N. was a fit and proper person must 
be determined as of the date of the 2014 Hearing because 
considering new evidence on remand would improperly afford W.N. 
a “second bite of  the apple” and an opportunity to present 
improvements to “his situation”  in order to increase his fitness 
for custody.  Prior to holding a new evidentiary hearing, S.M. 
argued, the family court should determine from the existing 
record whether W.N. satisfied the elements of HRS § 571- 46(a)(2) 
for a de facto custody presumption. 
  T he family court ruled that it would base its review 
on the 2014 Hearing record to determine whether W.N. was 
entitled to a de facto custody presumption.  The court stated 
that it would afford the parties an opportunity to raise any 
evidentiary objections, in writing,  from their review of a video 
recording of the 2014 Hearing.  W.N. reiterated the need to 
supplement the record in order to present evidence on events 
subsequent to the 2014 Hearing bearing upon the issue of whether 
he is a fit and proper person.  The court indicated that it 
would take this  argument under consideration.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
11   W.N. subsequently filed a petition raising objections 
to the exclusion of the Crosiers’ visitation reports  and Dr. 
Wyss’s progress  notes.  Rather than excluding the Crosiers ’ 
visitation reports, W.N. argued, any hearsay statements therein 
could be redacted and the visitation reports could then be 
considered in determini ng W.N.’s entitlement to a de facto 
custody presumption and in  rendering a custody award in the best 
interests of Child.  In addition, W.N. objected to the exclusion 
of Dr. Wyss’s progress notes and argued the court should permit 
Dr. Wyss to provide testimony to rebut the sexual abuse 
allegations against W.N.  Dr. Wyss’s testimony should  address  a 
letter he  wrote to Child Welfare Services regarding the 
allegations, W.N. contended, and the letter should be admitted 
into evidence.  S.M. filed a statement of no objection to 
limitation to the 2014 Hearing record on remand. 
  T he family court denied all of W.N.’s evidentiary 
objections.  The court found that the Cros iers’ visitation 
reports were hearsay and the Crosiers were allowed to testify, 
and that Dr.  Wyss’s progress n otes were cumulative.   The family 
court then determined that based upon its review of the 2014 
Hearing record, W.N. had failed to establish a prima facie case 
under HRS § 571- 46(a)(2) for a de facto custody presumption.  
Accordingly, the family court ruled that it would not be in the 
best interests of Child to award W.N. joint custody.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
12   On June 8, 2017, the family court entered its Findings 
of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order ( 2017 Order).  The 
family court found that a review of the transcripts and the 
audio and video recording of the 2014 Hearing enabled it to 
judge credibility and determine whether W.N. satisfied the 
elements of HRS § 571- 46(a)(2).  Based upon this evidence, the 
family court concluded that while W.N. met two of the three 
elements of HRS § 571- 46(a)(2), he did not meet his burden as to 
the “fit and proper person” statutory element because of (1) his 
undisputed anger management problem and (2) Dr. De Costa’s and 
C.N.’s unfavorable testimony, including Dr. De Costa’s testimony 
as to Child’s regression and Son’s performance on psychological 
tests and “extreme regression.”   The family court thus denied 
W.N.’s custody petition.   
 
 W.N. timely filed a Notice of Appeal from the 2017  
Order.  The case was subsequently transferred to this court. 
 STANDARDS OF REVIEW III.
 
 This court reviews the family court’ s findings of 
facts (FOF) under the “clearly erroneous” standard.  Waldecker 
v. O’Scanlon, 137 Hawai i 460, 466, 375 P.3d 239, 245 (2016).  
A FOF is clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks 
substantial evidence to support the finding, or (2) despite 
substantial evidence in support of the finding, the 
appellate court is nonetheless left with a definite and 
firm conviction that a mistake has been made.  “Substantial 
evidence” is credible evidence which is of sufficient 
quality and probative value to enable a person of 
reasonable caution to support a conclusion.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
13 Id.  On appeal, the family court ’s conclusions  of law are 
reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard.  Id. (citing In 
re Doe, 95 Hawai i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001)).    
  “The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
reviewable de novo.”  Kauai Springs, Inc. v. Planning Comm’ n of 
Cty. of Kaua i, 133 Hawai i 141, 163, 324 P.3d 951, 973 (2014)  
(quoting Franks v. City & Cty. of Honolulu , 74 Haw. 328, 334, 
843 P.2d 668, 671 (1993)).   
  “[W]here the admissibility of evidence is determined 
by application of the hearsay rule, there can be only one 
correct result, and the appropriate standard for appellate 
review is the right/wrong standard. ”  State v. Moore, 82 Hawai i 
202, 217, 921 P.2d 122, 137 (1996) (internal quotation marks and 
citation omitted). 
 DISCUSSION IV.
  W. N. asserts that the  family court abused its 
discretion by denying his request to hold an evidentiary hearing 
on remand.  W.N. contends that the only disputed issue before 
the family court on remand was whether he  satisfied the “fit and 
proper person” eleme nt of HRS § 571 -46(a)(2) for application of 
a de facto custody presumption.  Yet, argues W.N. , the family 
court improperly limited evidence bearing upon this 
determination by excluding (1) the Crosiers’ visitation reports ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
14 based upon hearsay statements of Child;8 (2) Dr. Wyss’s progress 
notes from the individual and couples therapy sessions, his 
testimony as to matters ruled outside the scope of his clinical 
note, and his letter to Child Welfare Services;9 and (3) evidence 
that W.N. had subsequently obtained a foster care license that 
required him to undergo a psychosexual evaluation.   To determine 
the best interests of Child, W.N. asserts, the family court must 
consider the present circumstances instead of those from the 
date of the 2014 Hearing.  As such, W.N. maintains, it was a 
manifest injustice for the family court to deny his request to 
present new evidence and to hold based solely on the 2014 
Hearing record that he is not “a fit and proper person.”10   
  In response, S.M. argues that the family court w
as not 
required by this court’s decision to hold a new evidentiary 
                     
 8 W.N. also challenged the ruling in the 2014 Hearing that did not 
allow the Crosiers to use their reports to refresh their recollections.   
 9 W.N. argues that although in A.A. v. B.B.  this court found that 
the family court’s limitation of Dr. Wyss’s testimony and the exclusion of 
the progress notes were harmless, it was error for the family court  on remand 
to prevent W.N. from offering relevant information to establish that he is a 
“fit and proper person.”  This court, W.N. asserts, foresaw this problem and 
stated that the family court could revisit its evidentiary rulings on remand.  
 
 10 W.N. also argues that the trial court abused its discretion 
in 
finding, contrary to this court’s fo otnote in A.A. v. B.B., that there was 
not sufficient evidence in the record to hold that W.N. is a “fit and proper 
person.”  In doing so, W.N. maintains, the family court improperly 
disregarded extensive favorable testimony from both Dr. Wyss and the Cros
iers 
as to W.N.’s relationship with and care of Child, as well as Dr. Wyss’s 
testimony regarding W.N.’s progress in anger management.  That evidence was 
sufficient, W.N. contends, to find that he is a “fit and proper person.”  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
15 hearing on remand.  On the contrary, S.M. contends, the decision 
indicated that the hearing record was sufficient to make a 
determination as to whether W.N. had established a prima facie 
case of a de facto custody presumption under HRS § 571- 46(a)(2).  
It would have been error, S.M. asserts, for the family court to 
give W.N. an opportunity to re- litigate the issues heard at the 
2014 Hearing with new facts.11  Additionally, S.M. argues that 
the family court on remand properly excluded the evidence that 
W.N. sought to introduce as it contained hearsay or was 
needlessly cumulative
 and that the court rendered  rulings as to 
W.N.’s evidentiary objections in accordance with this court’s 
evidentiary holdings in the first appeal.   
  
We first address the question as to whether the family 
court erred on remand when it denied W.N.’s request for a 
further evidentiary hearing.  Thereafter, w e turn to W.N.’s 
evidentiary objections on remand, including the  exclusion of the 
Crosiers’ visitatio n reports, the limitation of Dr. Wyss’s 
testimony, and the exclusion of Dr. Wyss’s progress notes.  
                     
 11 As to the family court’s co nclusion that W.N. did not meet the 
“fit and proper person” element, S.M. contends that W.N.’s admitted anger 
management problem and the  testimony regarding Child and Son’s regression, 
sexual abuse allegations, and conflicts between S.M. and W.N. were  sufficient 
to establish that it would not be in the best interests of Child to award 
W.N. joint custody.  Thus, S.M. argues, the family court properly held that 
W.N. is not a fit and proper person for custody.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
16  A Court Must Consider Relevant, Probative Evidence T o A.
Determine Whether The Petitioner  Is A Fit And Proper Person And 
Whether A Custody Award Is In The Best Interests Of The Child 
  The primary issue before this court is whether the 
family court erred on remand by precluding W.N. from presenting 
evidence of circumstances arising after the 2014 Hearing that 
directly related to whether W.N. was a “fit and p roper person” 
with a prima facie entitlem ent to custody of Child .  This court 
instructed the family court on remand to make a determination as 
to whether W.N. satisfies the elements of HRS § 571- 46(a)(2) for 
a de facto custody presumption ,12 and if so, to make a custody 
award in the best interests of Child.  A.A. v. B.B. , 139 Hawai i 
102, 116-17, 384 P.3d 878, 892-93 (2016).  B ased solely upon the 
2014 Hearing record, the family court held that W.N. did not 
satisfy the “fit and proper person” element of HRS § 571-
46(a)(2), and he was thus not entitled to a de facto custody 
presumption for an award of custody of Child
. 
  I t is well settled that in child custody cases the 
paramount concern is the best interests of the child.  Doe v. 
Doe, 98 Hawai i 144, 155, 44 P.3d 1085, 1096  (2002).  The 
criteria and procedures for the family court to award custody  
                     
 12 HRS § 571 -46(a)(2) (Supp. 2013 ) provides that a person other than 
the child’s father or mother may establish that he or she is entitled to a 
prima facie award of custody if that person “has had de facto custody of the 
child in a stable and wholesome home and is a fit and proper person.”   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
17 and determine the best interests  of the child are set forth in 
HRS § 571-46.  HRS § 571-46 (Supp. 2016).  We thus construe HRS 
§ 571-46 to determine the legislature’s intent as to the 
timeliness of information to be considered in determinations 
implicating the best interests of the child.  When construing a 
statute, “our foremost obligation is to ascertain and give 
effect to the intention of the legislature which is to be 
obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute 
itself.”  Kauai Springs, Inc. v. Planning Comm’n of C ty. of
 
Kauai, 133 Hawai i 141, 163, 324 P.3d 951, 973 (2014) (quoting 
Franks v. City & Cty. of Honolulu , 74 Haw. 328, 334, 843 P.2d  
668, 671 (1993)).   
  Accordingly, we look first to the plain language of  
HRS § 571-46, which indicates that current, relevant evidence is 
required for a court to make an informed decision regarding 
applicability of a de facto custody presumption.  The 
presumption’s pivotal requirement that a person “ is
 [] fit and 
proper,” HRS § 571 -46(a)(2) (emphasis added), requires the court 
to consider if the person is fit and proper to care for the 
minor child at the time of the contemplated custody award .  Such 
a determination by its nature cannot be based solely on 
circumstances as they existed years before custody would be 
granted.  The plain language of HRS § 571-46(a)(2) requires the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
18 court to consider relevant, probative evidence of the  person’s 
present fitness for custody.    
  
Many of the same contemporary considerations relevant 
to whether a person is presently fit and proper are also 
critical in evaluating whether a custody award is in the best 
interests of the child.  HRS § 571 -46(b) requir es the family 
court to consider multiple factors to determine the best 
interests of the child, such as “ [a]ny history of sexual or 
physical abuse of a child by a parent” ; “[a]ny evidence of past 
or current drug or alcohol abuse” ; “[t]he overall quality of the 
parent-child relationship” ; the physical, emotional, safety, and 
educational needs of the child; “ [t]he mental health of each 
parent”; and “ [t]he areas and levels of conflict present within 
the family.”  HRS § 571 -46(b).  These factors are not time-
restricted.  For example, the family court must consider “ [a]ny 
history” of abuse, encompassing all possible instances of abuse, 
regardless of when the abuse occurred; the family court is also 
required to consider “[a]ny evidence of past or current  drug or 
alcohol abuse.”  HRS § 571- 46(b)(1)-(2), (13) ( emphasis added).  
Determinations of t he child’s physical, emotional, safety and 
educational needs are set forth in the present tense, requiring 
the court to consider the child’s needs as of the time of the 
custody proceeding.  HRS § 571 -46(b)(6) -(9).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
19   The best interests of the child factors must also be 
read in conjunction with other provisions of HRS § 571- 46.  
Kauai Springs, 133 Hawai i at 163, 324 P.3d at 973 
(“It is 
fundamental in statutory construction that each part or section 
of a statute should be construed in connection with every other 
part or section so as to produce a harmonious whole.”  (quoting 
State v. Davis, 63 Haw. 191, 196, 624 P.2d 376, 380 (1981))).  
Subsection (a) of HRS § 571 -46 empowers family courts  to make 
and modify custody awards guided by the best interests of the 
child at any time as “necessary or proper” during the minority 
of the child.  HRS § 571- 46(a).  Subsection (a)(6) of HRS § 571 -
46 provides that existing custody awards “shall be subject to 
modification or change whenever the best interests of the child 
require or justify 
the modification or change .”  HRS § 571-
46(a)(6).  We have construed this provision to require courts to 
consider changed circumstances and make a custody modification 
in alignment with the best interests
 of the child after an 
initial custody award.   Waldecker v. O’Scanlon , 137 Hawai i 460, 
470, 375 P.3d 239, 249 (2016).  Read in pari materia, the se 
provision s evince the legislature’s intent  that the 
determination of the best intere sts of the child  take into 
consideration both past and present circumstances.   
  Our precedents further reflect that 
HRS § 571- 46 calls 
for a determination based on all probative evidence.  In  Doe, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
20 this court held that the family court erroneously denied the 
mother a re-hearing in a custody proceeding when she was unable 
to present evidence of the father’s  alleged  abusive behavior at 
the initial custody hearing because the hearing time had 
expired.  98 Hawai i at 147-48, 156, 44 P.3d at  1088-89, 1097.  
The court erred, we stated, because the denial of the re-hearing  
“resulted in the exclusion of testimony of witnesses bearing 
upon the issue of family violence and, inferentially, the best 
interest of [the c]hild.”  Id. at 155, 44 P.3d at 1096.   
  In a more recent case,  Tumaneng v. Tumaneng, the 
family court precluded a mother seeking modification of a 
custody decree, in light of father’s relocation and mother’s 
planned relocation, from introducing evidence of alleged 
domestic violence that had occurred prior to the original 
custody decree but was not proffered by mother in the original 
proceedings.  138 Hawai i 468, 471-72, 382 P.3d 280, 283-84 
(2016).  We held that the family court erred in excluding this 
evidence because the information was relevant to making a 
custody determination in the best interests of the child 
regardless of when it occurred.  Id. at 474, 382 P.3d at 286.  
  As  in Tumaneng  and Doe, the family court’s failure to 
hold a further evidentiary hearing on remand resulted in the 
exclusion of information relevant to determining whether W.N.  is 
a fit and proper person, as well as information relevant to ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
21 ascertaining the best interests of Child.  See Tumaneng , 138 
Hawaii at 474, 382 P.3d at 286; Doe, 98 Hawai i at 155, 44 P.3d 
at 1096.  The family court did not consider any circumstances 
that arose over the course of more than two years after the 2014 
Hearing relating to whether W.N. was a “fit and proper person”  
under HRS § 571-46(a)(2).  Significantly, W.N. made an offer of 
proof that he would supplement the record with 
evidence that he 
had undergone a psychosexual evaluation and obtained a foster 
care license since the 2014 Hearing.  This evidence would have 
directly pertained
 to the court’s determination of whether W.N. 
was presently a fi
t and proper person. 
  
Other jurisdictions have also held that when
 custody 
of a child is at issue, a person ’s present fitness must be 
considered.  See, e.g. , Adoption of Mary , 610 N.E.2d 898, 902 
(Mass. 1993) (in issue is whether parent is “presently unfit”);  
Roeh v. Roeh, 746 P.2d 1016, 1018-19 (Idaho Ct. App. 1987) 
(lower court erred when  it granted custody to father on findings 
that were three to seven years old and ignored evidence of 
mother’s present fitness) ; In re O.J.R. , 769 S.E.2d 631, 638  
(N.C. Ct. App. 2015) (in termination of parental rights case, 
“parents’ fitness to care for their children should be 
determined as of the time of the hearing ” and the “trial court 
must consider evidence of changed conditions”  (quoting In re 
Ballard, 319 S.E.2d 227, 231 (N.C. 1984))); Larson v. Larson , 30 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
22 Wis. 2d 291, 299, 140 N.W.2d 230, 235 (1966) ( “Fitness should be 
determined as of the time of the hearing and as to its future 
probability.”).  Additionally, whe n a lower court  has failed to 
consider whether a parent is presently fit for custody, 
appellate courts in other jurisdictions have remanded the cases 
for further evidentiary hearings.  See, e.g.
, Roeh, 746 P.2d at 
1021 (“Upon remand, the magistrate is empowered to take 
additional evidence relating to the present fitness of the 
parents in determining the custody issue.”); Armistead v. 
Armistead , 322 S.E.2d 836, 838 (Va. 1984) ( where court excluded 
evidence relevant to best interests of child, on remand “the 
chancellor should consider all the evidence already in the 
record as well as any new evidence the parties may submit 
relevant to the determination of [child’ s] best interests” ).   
  B ased on a plain me aning reading of HRS § 571- 46, an 
in pari materia reading of its provisions, and precedent  from 
this and other jurisdictions, the family court must  consider 
admissible evidence probative of establishing the elements of 
HRS § 571-46(a)(2), including evidence as to whether a person is 
a fit and proper person at the time of the court’s 
determination.  If the statutory elements are satisfied, then 
consideration of such evidence is essential for the family court 
to make a custody award in the best interests of the child.  In 
this case, the passage of time since the 2014 Hearing and W.N.’s ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
23 offer of proof that he obtained a foster care license and 
underwent a psychosexual evaluation for the licensure indicates 
that there was new, material evidence bearing upon whether W.N. 
was a fit and proper person as of the time of the proceedings on 
remand.  In limiting review on remand to the 2014 Hearing 
record, the family court precluded  consideration of this  
evidence.  The family court  thus erred in  denying W.N.’s request 
to hold a further evidentiary hearing on remand.13   
 Evidentiary Objections  B.
  
In light of our disposition remanding  this case for 
further proceedings, we provide guidance as to other evidentiary 
matters that have been raised in this appeal.   
1. Exclusion of Visitation Reports on Hearsay Grounds 
  At the 2014 Hearing, t he family court sustained 
objections to the introduction of the Crosiers’ visitation 
reports because the reports contained hearsay statements of 
                     
 13 W.N. also contends that the family court erred in not concluding 
that there was sufficient evidence in the record to support that W.N. is a 
fit and proper person.  Although we noted in A.A. v. B.B. that the record was 
sufficient to support a finding that W.N. satisfied the elements of HRS § 
571-46(a)(2), as discussed above, it was necessary for the family court to 
make a determination as to whether W.N. was presently a fit and proper 
person.  Accordingly, we do not address whether the 2014  Hearing record  would 
have entitle d W.N. to a de facto custody presumption  when the hearing  
occurred.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
24 Child.14  Similarly, on remand, the  family court excluded the 
visitation reports on hearsay grounds and because the Crosiers 
testified at the 2014 Hearing .15   
  W.N.  argued both during the 2014 Hearing and on remand 
that Child’s statements in the visitation reports were not 
offered for the truth of the matter asserted and thus they were 
not hearsay.  W.N. alternatively asserted that if Child’s 
statements were hearsay,
 then the statements could be redacted 
or could fall under the excited utterance exception.  It appears 
that the family court concluded that Child’s statements were 
hearsay; that the statement s did not qualify under a hearsay 
exception; and that they could not have been redacted from the 
                     
 14 Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 801 provides in relevant part 
as follows:  
“Hearsay” is a statement, other than one made by the 
declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered 
in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.  
“Statement” is an oral assertion, an assertion in a 
writing, or nonverbal conduct of a person, if it is 
intended by the person as an assertion.  
HRE Rule 801 (2016).  HRE Rule 802 (2016) provides as follows: “ Hearsay is 
not admissible except as provided by these rules, or by other rules 
prescribed by the Hawaii supreme court, or by statute.”   
 15 The record is not clear as to the  reasoning underlying  the family 
court’s hearsay r uling on remand regarding the visitation reports.  Because 
S.M. did not file any new objections or a response to W.N.’s objections, we 
consider only the reason
ing S.M. articulated during the 2014 H earing and the 
basis given by the court in its  original ruling, i.e., that the reports  
contained hearsay statements made by Child.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
25 visitation reports in a manner that would have enable d the court 
to duly consider the remaining substance of the reports.   
  As stated previously, it is well settled that,  in 
child custody cases, the paramount concern is the best interests 
of the child.  Doe v. Doe , 98 Hawai i 144, 155 , 44 P.3d 1085, 
1096 (2002).  The visitation reports prepared by the Crosiers 
contemporaneously with supervised visits 
of W.N. and Child 
between June 23, 2014 and September 30, 2014 contain detailed 
descriptions of W.N. and Child’s interactions, as well as 
changes in Child’s behavior and eating over time.  The reports 
recount certain statements and exclamations made by Child during 
the course of the supervised visits.  Independent of their 
factual accuracy, these statements demonstrate how Child 
interacted with W.N.  
As such, Child’s statements were not 
offered for the truth of the matter asserted
 and are not 
hearsay.16   
  T he visitation reports contain information directly 
relevant to assessing whether W.N. is a fit and proper person 
and whether a custody award is in the best interests of C hild.  
Accordingly, on remand, the family court should reexamine its 
                     
 16 Additionally, the statements by Child appear to be relatively 
isolated, appearing to make redaction feasible  and not justifying  excluding 
the reports in their entirety if the remaining portions were otherwise 
admissible.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
26 evidentiary rulings related to the admission of the visitation 
reports.17  
2. Limitation of Dr. Wyss’s Testimony and Exclusion of Progress 
Notes on Remand 
  W.N. contends that the family court on remand erred 
and abused its discretion in its evidentiary rulings a
s to Dr. 
Wyss.  W.N. argues that, although this court held in A.A. v. 
B.B. that the limitation of Dr. Wyss’s testimony and  the 
exclusion of progress notes from counseling sessions with W.N. 
and S.M. were harmless, the limitation and exclusion on remand 
precluded the family court from considering relevant evidence as 
to whether W.N. was a fit and proper person.   
  Following remand, the family court excluded Dr. Wyss’s 
progress notes on the basis that they were cumulative.18  Hawaii 
                     
 17 On appeal, W.N. also argues that the visitation reports should 
have been considered by the family court on remand because the family  court 
in the 2014 Hearing did not allow the Crosiers to refresh their recollections 
with the reports.  A writing may be used to refresh a witness’s recollection 
when the witness’s memory has lapsed.  HRE Rule 612 (2016); State v. 
Espiritu , 117 Hawai i 127, 137, 176 P.3d 885, 895 (2008).  A review of the 
record indicates that  the family court did not err in ruling that W.N. did 
not establish a proper foundation for refreshing recollection because neither 
Janet Crosier nor Steve Crosier clearly indicated a lapse in memory prior to 
counsel’s attempt to provide the writing to the  Crosiers to refresh their 
recollections.  Nevertheless, the family court on remand may consider 
allowing further testimony from the Crosiers regarding the visitation reports 
in making an informed determination  of the matters before it .   
 18 It is noted that at the 2014 Hearing, the family court excluded 
Dr. Wyss’s progress notes on a different basis --as outside the scope of his 
clinical note.  However,  the progress notes appear to contain matters within 
the scope of the clinical note.  For example, the clinical note references 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
27 Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 403 provides that relevant evidence 
may be excluded if it is a “needless presentation of cumulative 
evidence.”  HRE Rule 403 (2016).19  This court has held that, 
“[i]n order for evidence to be considered ‘cumulative’ for HRE 
403 purposes, it must be substantially the same as other 
evidence that has already been received.”  State v. Pulse , 83 
Hawaii 229, 247, 925 P.2d 797, 815 (1996).   
  The record does not indicate that the family court on 
remand identified the other admitted evidence that rendered the 
progress notes cumulative.  Thus, it is unclear if the progress 
notes constitute a “needless presentation of cumulative 
evidence.”  See HRE Rule 403.
  A review of the progress notes 
indicates that they include  substantial information regarding 
W.N.’s anger management therapy, they reference the sexual abuse 
allegations against W.N.,  and they contain Dr. Wyss’s clinical 
opinion regarding such allegations.  Thus, the progress notes 
appear to bear upon issues about which Dr. Wyss did not testify
 
                                                                               
(. . . continued) 
 
W.N.’s anger management issue and the use of cognitive -behavioral therapy 
interventions to treat this challenge and indicates that W.N.’s behavior 
involves “no physical aggression.”   
 19 HRE Rule 403 provides as follows: “ Although relevant, evidence 
may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the 
danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, 
or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation  
of cumulative evidence.”   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
28 or about which Dr. Wyss’s  testimony  was limited  by court rulings 
during the 2014 Hearing.   Additionally, the family court on 
remand did not address the letter that Dr. Wyss had written to 
Child Welfare Services  regarding the sexual abuse allegations 
against W.N.20   
  Therefore, following this second remand, the family 
court should reexamine its ruling that the progress notes are 
cumulative of other evidence in the record and, if so, identify 
such evidence already in the record.  Provided they are 
otherwise admissible, any progress notes containing probative, 
non-cumulative evidence should be considered, along with 
proffered testimony related to the import of such progress 
notes.  Finally, the family court should address the 
                     
 20 In our decision in the first appeal, we concluded that although 
under the circumstances any error by the family court in restricting Dr. 
Wyss’s testimony or in not admitting the progress notes was harmless, we 
stated that “if further evidentiary proceedings are held on remand, the 
family court may revisit its ruling regarding the proffered evidence.”  A.A. 
v. B.B., 139 Hawai i 102, 116 n.23, 384 P.3d 878, 892 n.23 (2016).  Our 
determination that the exclusion of the progress notes and the limitation of 
Dr. Wyss’s testimony were harmless relied upon the evidentiary record as then 
presented and the legal issues considered in the first appeal.  As previously 
discussed, the family court’s custody determination will require 
consideration of probative evidence of present circumstances, and the 
relative impact of any evidentiary ruling may differ in this context .  Thus, 
the court should  reexamine prior rulings challenged on appeal regarding 
evidence that was excluded  at the initial hearing.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
29 admissibility of Dr. Wyss’s  letter to Child Welfare  Services in 
accordance with the principles set forth in this opinion.21   
 CONCLUSION V.
  Based on the foregoing,  the family court’s June 8, 
2017 Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Order is 
vacated, and the case is remanded to the family court 
for 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion to determine
 
whether W.N. presently meets the elements of HRS § 571- 46(a)(2), 
and if so, to make a custody award in the best interests of 
Child.

 21 As to the remaining evidentiary objections raised on appeal  by 
W.N., this court previously addressed substantively similar arguments in A.A. 
v. B.B.  See 139 Hawai i at 116 n.23, 384 P.3d at 892 n.23.  W.N. also argues 
that the family court  misstated the record in regard  to C.N.’s testimony that 
W.N. “had not changed.”  However, it appears from the transcript of the 2014 
Hearing that the family court did not misstate the record.
