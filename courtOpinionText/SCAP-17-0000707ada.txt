OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J. 
 
I.  Introduction 
 
 David M. Sheffield (“Sheffield”), a stranger to the 
complaining witness (“CW”), allegedly followed her while she 
walked along a street at night, stated that he wanted to beat 
her up and have sex with her, pulled a loop on her backpack as 
she tried to cross a street at a crosswalk, and dragged her 
backwards about five or ten steps before she broke free.

Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 707-720(1)(d) (2014),  a1
class A felony punishable with up to twenty years of 
2 3imprisonment,  and one count of third degree assault,  a
4misdemeanor punishable with up to one year of imprisonment.   At
the State’s request, the third degree assault count was 
dismissed before trial.  Sheffield was tried by a jury in the 
5Circuit Court of the Second Circuit  (“circuit court”) and found
guilty on the kidnapping count.  He now appeals, and this court 
accepted transfer of the appeal from the ICA.  
On appeal, Sheffield argues that, when kidnapping is the 
only count tried, the State must prove the defendant used a 
greater degree of “restraint” than that incidentally used to 
1HRS § 707- 720(1)(d) provides in relevant part, “A person commits the 
offense of kidnapping if the person intentionally or knowingly restrains 
another person with intent to . . . [i]nflict bodily injury upon that person 
or subject that person to a sexual offense. . . .”  
2HRS § 706-659 (2014) provides in relevant part, “[A] person w ho has 
been convicted of a class A felony . . . shall be sentenced to an 
indeterminate term of imprisonment of twenty years without the possibility of 
suspension of sentence or probation.  The minimum length of imprisonment 
shall be determined by the Hawai [ʻ]i paroling authority in accordance with 
section 706- 669. . . .”  
3HRS § 707- 712(1)(a) (2014) provides in relevant part, “A person commits 
the offense of assault in the third degree if the person . . . 
[i]ntentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes bodily injury to another
person. . . .”
4HRS § 706-663 (2014) provides in relevant part, “[T]he court may 
sentence a person who has been convicted of a misdemeanor . . . to 
imprisonment for a definite term to be fixed by the court and not to exceed 
one year. . . .”

 commit the underlying unprosecute
d assault in the third degree 
offense.  He also argues the jury should have been so 
instructed.  Sheffield asserts that the act of pulling the loop 
on CW’s backpack and dragging her backwards five to ten steps 
was insufficient evidence of “restraint” to su pport the 
kidnapping conviction.  He asks this court to reverse his 
conviction based upon insufficiency of the evidence, or, in the 
alternative, to vacate his conviction and remand this case to 
the circuit court for further proceedings. 
 We hold  that the “restraint” required to support a 
kidnapping conviction under HRS § 707- 720(1)(d)  is indeed 
restraint in excess of any restraint incidental to the 
infliction or intended infliction of bodily injury or subjection 
or intended subjection of a person to a sexual offense; 
therefore, the circuit court plainly erred in failing to so 
instruct the jury.  Hence, we vacate the circuit court’s 
judgment of conviction and sentence and remand this case to the 
circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion. 
II.  Background 
A.  Indictment 
 
 
On January 25, 2016, the State charged Sheffield by 
indictment with Count One:  kidnapping, under HRS § 707-
720(1)(d), and Count Two: assault in the third degree, under HRS ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 § 707-712(1)(a).  Prior to trial, the State fi
led a motion to 
dismiss Count Two without prejudice, which the circuit court 
granted. 
B.  Trial Testimony
 
 Sheffield’s conviction relies on CW’s testimony, which we 
summarize in the light most favorable to the prosecution.  CW 
was a 24-year- old University of Hawai ʻi Maui Colleg
e student on 
November 16, 2015.  That night, one of her classes had run long, 
so she left school later than usual, after 7:30 p.m.  When she 
arrived at the bus station, it appeared empty, so she believed 
she missed the last bus to upcountry Maui, where she lived.  She 
decided to walk through Kahului towards the highway to 
hitchhike.  As she walked down Alamaha Street, she heard male 
voices yelling at her to “come hang out,” but she kept going.   
She rolled a cigarette but realized she had no lighter, so she 
purchased a lighter at a store.  As she exited the store, she 
heard a male voice yelling at her to stop and wait.   
 A stranger (later identified as Sheffield) then approached 
CW.  She kept walking half a block before he started yelling to 
her again.  As CW entered a crosswalk, Sheffield again ran up to 
her and asked for a cigarette.   When CW refused, he followed her 
and kept asking her why she was avoiding him and stating that he 
wanted her to come to his house.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
 
5 
  CW testified that she thought Sheffield was “kind of like a 
crazy old guy” and did not initially feel threatened by him.  
She testified, however, that he started becoming more aggressive 
with her, running in front of her and putting his arms out to 
block her way, all the while questioning her.  Then, according 
to CW, the stranger told her, “I want to fuck you.”  He then 
said he “was going to knock [her] out” and put his hands up near 
his face before taking a swing at CW.  CW stated Sheffield 
missed her face because he was not a skilled fighter.  
  As CW turned to run away, Sheffield grabbed a loop on the 
back of her backpack and pulled her backwards towards the 
bushes, again repeating “more of the fucking kind of stuff” and 
that “he was going to beat [her] up.”  CW testified that 
Sheffield’s voice became “low, mean, and aggressive.”  She 
struggled to break free because her backpack was strapped 
together in the front and she could not undo the buckle.  
Sheffield pulled CW back “five or maybe ten steps,” and ev ery 
now and then, he would yank on the backpack and “force [her] 
back . . . another step.”  When he had pulled her all the way to 
the curb, he could not pull her any farther.    
 Sheffield then gave CW a very hard tug, and she spun 
around, causing him to lose his grip on her backpack loop.  She 
spun around again and ran into the street to escape him.   
Sheffield pursued her, but both became caught among moving ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 traffic.  CW was able to run up the street towards a hardware 
store.  Having eluded Sheffield, CW th
en called her boyfriend to 
explain what had happened and asked for a ride home. 
C.  Jury Instructions    
 After the evidentiary portion of the trial, the circuit 
court instructed the jury on kidnapping as follows: 
 The defendant, DAVID MICHAEL SHEFFIELD, is charged 
with the offense of Kidnapping. 
 A person commits the offense of Kidnapping if he 
intentionally or knowingly restrains another person with 
intent to inflict bodily injury upon that person or subject 
that person to a sexual offense.  
 There are three material elements of the offense of 
Kidnapping, each of which the prosecution must prove beyond 
a reasonable doubt.  These three elements are:  
 1.  That,
 on or about the 16th day of November, 2015, 
in the County of Maui, State of Hawai ʻi, the Defendant 
restrained another person; and  
 2.  That the Defendant did so intentionally or 
knowingly; and  
 3.  That the Defendant did so with the intent to 
inflict bodily injury upon that person or subject that 
person to a sexual offense.  
 
 As to the term “restrain,” the circuit court instructed the 
jury that the term “means to restrict a person’s movement in 
such a manner as to interfere substantially with her liberty by 
means of force,” adapting the instruction from Hawai ʻi Pattern 
Jury Instructions – Criminal 9.00 (2014) to the evidence adduced 
at trial.6   
                     
6  The pattern jury instruction defines “restrain” as follows:  
 
“Restrain” means to restrict a person’s movement in such a 
manner as to interfere substantially with the per son’s 
liberty: 
(1) by means  of force, threat, or deception; or  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
 
7 (continued. . .)  
  The circuit court also instructed the jury as to sexual 
assault in the first and second degree, as suggested by Hawai ʻi 
Pattern Jury Instructions — Criminal 9.34 (1996).7   The court 
                                                                  
(continued. . .)  
(2) if the person is under the age of eighteen or 
incompetent, without the consent of the relative, person, 
or institution having lawful custody of the person.  
 
Hawaiʻi Pattern Jury Instructions – Criminal 9.00.   
 
7  Hawaiʻi Pattern Jury Instructions — Criminal 9.34 provides as follows:  
 
[In Count (count number) of the Indictment/Complaint, the] 
[The] Defendant,  (defendant’s name), is charged with the 
offense of  Kidnapping. 
  
A person commits the offense of  Kidnapping if he/she 
intentionally or knowingly restrains another person with 
intent to [inflict bodily injury upon that person] [subject 
that person to a sexual offense].  
  
There are three material elements of the offense 
of Kidnapping , each of which the prosecution must prove 
beyond a reasonable doubt.  
 
These three elements are:  
 
1. That, on or about  (date) in the [City and] County 
of (name of county), the Defendant restrained another 
person; and  
2. That the Defendant did so intentionally or 
knowingly; and  
3. That the  Defendant did so with the intent to 
[inflict bodily injury upon that person] [subject that 
person to (name of sexual offense or included sexual 
offense)*].

 also instructed the jury that “bodily injury” means “physical 
pain, illness, or any impairment of physical condition.”   The 
circuit court also instructed the jury on the lesser included 
misdemeanor offense of unlawful imprisonment in the second 
degree.8 
D.  Verdict, Conviction, Sentence, and Appeal    
 The jury unanimously found Sheffield guilty as charged of 
kidnapping.  
The circuit court then sentenced Sheffield to 20 
years of imprisonment.9  Sheffield timely appealed, and we 
accepted transfer of this case.  
III.  Standard s of Review 
A.  Sufficiency of the Evidence 
 We have long held that evidence adduced in the trial 
court must be considered in the strongest light for the 
prosecution when the appellate court passes on the legal 
sufficiency of such evidence  to support a conviction; the 
same standard applies whether the case was before a judge 
or a jury.  The test on appeal is not whether guilt is 
established beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there 
was substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the 
trier of fact.  Indeed, even if it could be said in a bench 
                                                                  
(continued. . .)  
defense that vitiate[s] intent), unless such sexual 
offenses are otherwise charged.  
 
8  HRS § 707-722 (2014), “Unlawful imprisonment in the second degree,” 
provides in relevant part that “(1) [a] person commits the offense of 
unlawful imprisonment in the second degree if the person knowingly restrains 
another person.”  
 
9  The jury found that  the State had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that 
Sheffield did not release CW voluntarily prior to trial.   Therefore, he was 
convicted of kidnapping as a Class A felony.  See  HRS § 707- 720 (2) & (3) 
(2014) (stating that kidnapping is a Class A felony that can be reduced to a 
Class B felony if the defendant proves that he “voluntarily released the 
victim, alive and not suffering from serious or substantial bodily injury, in 
a safe place prior to trial .”).  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
 
9 
 trial that the conviction is against the weight of the 
evidence, as long as there is substantial evidence to 
support the requisite findings for conviction, the trial 
court will be affirmed .
 
 Substantial evidence as to every material element of 
the offense charged is credible evidence which is of 
sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person 
of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.  And as 
trier of fact, the trial judge is free to make all 
reasonable and rational inferences under the facts in 
evidence, including circumstantial evidence.

i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330 -31 
(2007) (citation, quotation marks, and brackets omitted).   
B.  Jury Instructions:  Plain Error 
As a general rule, jury instructions to which no objection 
has been made at trial will be reviewed only for plain 
error.  An error will be deemed plain error if the 
substantial rights of the defendant have been affected 
adversely.  Additionally, this court will apply the plain 
error standard of review to correct errors which seriously 
affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of 
judicial proceedings, to serve the ends of justice, and to 
prevent the denial of fundamental  rights.

(citations omitted).  
IV.  The Parties’ Arguments on Appeal  
A.  Sheffield’s Opening Brief  
 In his Opening Brief, Sheffield asserts two points of 
error:  (1) that insufficient evidence supported the kidnapping 
conviction, because the restraint Sheffield used against CW was 
only the restraint necessary to commit the “incidental” and 
unprosecuted offense, assault in the third degree; and (2) that 
the circuit court plainly erred in failing to instruct the jury 
on assault in the third degree (the dismissed and unprosecuted ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
 
10 
 charge), because the jury should have been instructed that the 
restraint necessary for a kidnapping conviction must be 
restraint in excess of the restraint necessary to co
mmit assault 
in the third degree.  
 Sheffield first argues that the evidence adduced at trial 
was insufficient to support his kidnapping conviction because 
the “restraint” necessary to support a kidnapping conviction 
must be restraint in excess of that necessary to commit assault 
in the third degree, the dismissed and unprosecuted “incidental” 
offense in this case.  Sheffield states that the evidence, 
viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was that 
Sheffield “grab[bed] CW’s backpack and pull[ ed] her 5 -10 steps 
backward before she [broke] free,” which lasted about 15 
seconds, after having stated that he “want[ed] to ‘fuck’ [CW] 
and ‘beat’ her up.”  Sheffield argues that Hawai ʻi’
s kidnapping 
statute was drawn from the Model Penal Code (“MPC”), w hose 
Commentary states that the offense should apply only to “the 
most severe conduct, given the drastic penalties that attached 
to such a conviction,” and should not be a “companion charge for 
every robbery, assault, and/or sexual assault,” which also 
involve elements of force and restraint.    
 To support his position, Sheffield extensively quotes the 
Commentary to the MPC’s kidnapping offense.  He notes that the 
Commentators criticized the states’ expansive interpretation of ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
 
11 
 the offense of kidnapping to prosecute the movement of victims 
that was only incidental to the commission, or attempted 
commission, of other crimes like robbery or rape.  The 
Commentators warned against abusive prosecution under the 
kidnapping statute of conduct that is wrongful but should more 
appropriately be prosecuted as some other crime.  The 
Commentators theorized that the expansion of kidnapping in this 
manner occurred due to the inadequacies of the law of attempt.   
Notably, Sheffield quoted the Commentary as stating, “Where the 
underlying crime is not completed, prosecution for kidnapping 
instead of attempt may amount to an end run around the special 
doctrinal protections designed for uncompleted crimes.”   
 Sheffield then summarizes case law from other jurisdictions 
purportedly holding that there was insufficient evidence to 
support a kidnapping conviction because the “restraint” used by 
the defendant was incidental to the commission of another 
offense, even an uncharged offense.  See  State v. Curreri, 213 
P.3d 1084 (Kan. Ct. App. 2009); Hines v. State, 40 S.W.3d 705 
(Tex. Ct. App. 2001); Alam v. State , 776 P.2d 345 (Alaska Ct. 
App. 1989); People v. Rappuhn, 260 N.W.2d 90 (Mich. Ct. App. 
1977); State v. Rich, 305 N.W.2d 739 (Iowa 1981); State v. 
Salamon, 949 A.2d 1092 (Conn. 2008); U.S. v. Sanchez , 782 F. 
Supp. 94 (C.D. Cal. 1992).    ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
 
12 
  She ffield then notes that there have been no Hawai ʻi cases 
exploring the level of restraint necessary to support a 
kidnapping conviction where there is an incidental but 
unprosecuted crime.  He does note, however, that this court in 
State v. Deguair, 139 Hawai ʻi 117, 128, 384 P.3d 893, 904 (2016), 
held that a kidnapping conviction merges into a robbery 
conviction where the kidnapping is part of a continuous course 
of conduct in committing robbery.  He also cites to the 
following Hawaiʻ i appellate cases to show that a defendant can be 
convicted of kidnapping and another crime, where the restraint 
necessary to support the kidnapping conviction was in excess of 
any restraint necessary to support a conviction for a 
contemporaneously committed crime:  State v. Hernandez , 61 Haw. 
475, 605 P.2d 75 (1980) (per curiam); State v. Halemanu, 3 Haw. 
App. 300, 650 P.2d 587 (1982); and State v. Yamamoto, 98 Hawaiʻi 
208, 46 P.3d 1092 (App. 2002).   
 Sheffield argues that the evidence at trial did not show 
restraint in excess of what would have been used in committing 
assault in the third degree.  Sheffield argues that his 
kidnapping conviction should therefore be reversed, as it is not 
supported by substantial evidence.  
 Sheffield next addresses his second point of error on 
appeal:  whether the circuit court plainly erred in failing to ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
 
13 
 instruct the jury on assault in the third degree, and that the 
restraint necessary to support a kidnapping conviction had to 
exceed any restraint used to commit assault in the third degree.  
Again, he cites to cases from other jurisdictions, in which 
courts instructed juries that restraint, for purposes of 
kidnapping, must be greater than the restraint used in 
committing the other crime for which the defendant was charged 
(e.g., rape or robbery).  See  Alam, 776 P.2d 345; Rappuhn, 260 
N.W.2d 90; Salamon, 949 A.2d 1092 ; People v. Bell, 102 Cal. 
Rptr. 3d 300 (Cal. Ct. App. 2009); and State v. White , 362 
S.W.3d 559 (Tenn. 2012)).  Therefore, Sheffield argues, the 
circuit court plainly erred in failing to advise the jury of a 
heightened restraint requirement for kidnapping.  Sheffield thus 
asks this court to “vacate the conviction” for kidnapping.  
 In concluding his Opening Brief, Sheffield asks this court 
to reverse the circuit court’s judgment due to insufficiency of 
the evidence supporting the conviction, or, alternatively, to 
vacate the judgment and remand this case to the circuit court 
for further proceedings.       
B.  The State’s Answering  Brief 
 As to Sheffield’s first point of error (that insufficient 
evidence supported his kidnapping conviction), the State 
counter-argues that Sheffield’s acts of restraining CW by the 
loop on her backpack so that she could not free herself, and ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
 
14 
 pulling her back five to ten steps, while repeatedly telling her 
he was going to “fuck [her]” and “beat [her] up,” constituted 
restraint that substantially interfered with CW’s liberty.  
Therefore, the State argues, Sheffield’s kidnapping conviction 
was supported by substantial evidence.  The State analogizes 
this case to State v. Valdivia, 95 Hawai ʻi 465, 24 P.3d 661 
(2001), in which this court held that the defendant- appellant’s 
acts of pinning a police officer’s left arm against the steering 
wheel of a moving car and driving forward, so that the officer 
was dragged 30 yards, constituted sufficient evidence of 
restraint to support the kidnapping conviction.  95 Hawaiʻi at 
470, 473, 24 P.3d at 660, 669.      
 The State next addresses Sheffield’s second point of error  
(that the jury should have been instructed that it had to find 
restraint greater than that necessary to commit the underlying 
crime in order to convict him for kidnapping).  The State 
counter-argues that the HRS and the Commentary to the Hawai ʻi 
Penal Cod
e “make no distinction between restraint to commit an 
underlying offense and the restraint in excess of that.”  
Therefore, to the State, the cases cited by Sheffield from other 
jurisdictions are inapplicable.  The State therefore asks this 
court to affirm Sheffield’s judgment of conviction.

 V.  Discussion    
 
A.   The Language, History, and Structure of MPC Section 212.1 
 (Kidnapping) and Hawai ʻi’s Kidnapping and Related Offenses  
 
Statutes, HRS §§ 707- 720 to -722   
 
 
Sheffield argues that the restraint necessary for a 
kidnapping conviction must be restraint in excess of the 
restraint necessary to commit assault in the third degree.  His 
argument is supported by the language, history, and structure of 
MPC section 212.1 (Kidnapping) and Hawai ʻi’s Kidnappin g and 
Related Offenses statutes, HRS §§ 707- 720 to -722.   
Sheffield was convicted of kidnapping under HRS § 707-
720(1)(d), which states, “A person commits the offense of 
kidnapping if the person intentionally or knowingly restrains 
another person with intent to . . . [i]nflict bodily injury upon 
that person or subject that person to a sexual offense. . . .”  
HRS § 707-700 (2014) defines “restrain” as follows:   
to restrict a person’s movement in such a manner as to 
interfere substantially with the person’s  liberty:  (1)  By 
means of force, threat, or deception; or (2) If the person 
is under the age of eighteen or incompetent, without the 
consent of the relative, person, or institution having 
lawful custody of the person.  
 
Based on the evidence in this case,
 the circuit court instructed 
the jury that “[r]estrain means to restrict a person’s movement 
in such a manner as to interfere substantially with her liberty 
by means of force.”  Although the circuit court gave this 
instruction, no instruction was given regarding whether or not 
the substantial interference necessary for a kidnapping ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
 
16 
 conviction was required to be in excess of the substantial 
interference with liberty that would be incidental to the 
infliction or intended infliction of bodily injury or the 
subjection or intended subjection of a person to a sexual 
offense. 
 
The Commentary to HRS § 707- 720 to - 722 notes that 
“restraint” is the conduct applicable to kidnapping (HRS § 707 -
720) as well as unlawful imprisonment in the first and second 
degrees (HRS §§ 707-721 and -722, respectively).  The Commentary 
states restraint is measured by reasonableness, explaining that 
the “duration of restraint necessary for conviction depends upon 
the intent and attendant circumstances.  In this regard, 
something like a r easonable standard applies.”  The Commentary 
gives the following example of a substantial interference with 
liberty for purposes of kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment in 
the first and second degrees:  “[A] short restraint in an area 
where the victim might suffocate or come to other bodily harm 
would constitute a substantial interference with liberty under 
these sections.”   
 Sheffield’s position is supported by the MPC’s Commentary 
to Kidnapping, § 212.1.  Hawai ʻi g
enerally follows the MPC.  See 
State v. Aiwohi, 109 Hawaiʻi 115, 126, 123 P.3d 1210, 1221 (2005) 
(“The Hawaiʻi Penal Code is substantially derived from the [MPC].  
Accordingly, it is appropriate to look to the [MPC] and its ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
 
17 
 commentary for guidance.” (footnote omitted)).  Further, this 
court has looked to the [MPC]’s Commentary to Section 212.1 
(kidnapping) for guidance in the past, although not directly in 
the context of the kidnapping offense.  See  State v. Flores, 131 
Hawaiʻi 43, 54 -55, 314 P.3d 120, 131-32 (2013) (looking to MPC 
Commentary to Section 212.1 and noting that the Hawai ʻi Penal 
Code makes distinctions between “unlawful imprisonment” and 
“kidnapping” in a manner similar to the MPC’s distinctions 
between “unlawful restraint” and “kidnapping”).  Thus, the MPC 
Commentary is a useful aid in analyzing the issues raised in 
this appeal.    
 In 1962, the American Law Institute adopted the MPC and 
Commentaries.  In crafting section 212.1 on kidnapping, the 
Commentators highlighted several problems with the existing 
state laws on kidnapping.  T
hey noted that state kidnapping laws 
had drifted away from the “ancient requirement of asportation 
out of the country . . . [as] the crux of the common- law offense 
as placing the victim beyond the protection of the law.”  
Commentary on Section 212.1 at 211.  The Commentators criticized 
state laws requiring only “movement” of the victim or 
eliminating the asportation requirement altogether.  Commentary 
on Section 212.1 at 212.  Another problem they noted was the 
tendency to charge a kidnapping offense due to the inadequacy of 
attempt laws to reach conduct preparatory to robbery, rape, or ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 some other crime.  Commentary on Section 212.1 at 213.  The 
Commentators also observed that states had dramatically 
increased the penalty for kidnapping convictions to life 
imprisonment or death following high-profile kidnappings like 
the one involving the Lindbergh baby.  Commentary on Section 
212.1 at 214-15.  These drastically increased penalties, coupled 
with the expansive definitions of kidnapping, led some states to 
grade kidnapping offenses by severity, a move the Commentators 
supported; on the other hand, the Commentators noted that not 
all states had graded the offense.  Commentary on Section 212.1 
at 216-17.  This state of the law prompted the American Law 
Institute t
o undertake a “major restructuring” of the offense of 
kidnapping.  Commentary on Section 212.1 at 220.  To that end, 
the MPC introduced three related offenses which were, in order 
of most to least severe, kidnapping, felonious restraint, and 
false imprisonment.  Id.  With respect to the kidnapping 
offense, the MPC requires “substantial removal or confinement,” 
as follows, with the conduct element emphasized: 
A person is guilty of kidnapping if he unlawfully removes 
another from his place of residence or business, or a 
substantial distance from the vicinity where he is found, 
or if he unlawfully confines another for a substantial 
period in a place of isolation  with any of the following 
purposes: 
(a) to hold for ransom or reward, or as a shield or 
hostage; or  
(b) to facilitate commission of any felony or flight 
thereafter; or  
(c) to inflict bodily injury on or to terrorize the victim 
or another; or  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
 
19 
 (d)
 to interfere with the performance of any governmental 
or political function.  
Kidnapping is a felony of the first degree unless the actor 
voluntarily releases the victim alive and in a safe place 
prior to trial, in which case it is a felony of the second 
degree.  A removal or confinement is unlawful within the 
meaning of this Section if it is accomplished by force, 
threat or deception, or, in the case of a person who is 
under the age of 14 or incompetent, if it is accomplished 
without the consent of a parent, guardian or other person 
responsible  for general supervision of his welfare.  
 
MPC and Commentaries, § 212.1 at 201 (emphasis added).  
  
 By contrast, the 
Hawaiʻi Penal Code requires only the act of 
“restraint ,” defined to mean “to restrict a person’s movement in 
such a manner as to interfere substantially with the person’s 
liberty” by various means or circumstances.  Although Hawaiʻi law 
requires a substantial interference with a person’s liberty, it 
does not require substantial removal or confinement for a 
kidnapping conviction.  HRS § 707-720.10  Thus, the M PC and 
Hawaiʻi Penal Code differ significantly in setting forth the 
conduct necessary for kidnapping.  Unfortunately, there is no 
legislative history expla ining why Hawaiʻi’s version of the 
kidnapping offense was adopted, as opposed to the MPC ’s version.  
1972 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 9, at 32-142; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No.

10  HRS § 707- 720 (Kidnapping) makes it a crime t o “intentionally or 
knowingly restrain[] another person with the intent” to perform further 
specified acts.  (Emphasis added.)  The offenses of unlawful imprisonment in 
the first and second degrees also require “restraint.”  HRS § 707- 721 
(Unlawful imprisonment in the first degree) makes it a crime to “ knowingly 
restrain[] another person under circumstances which expose the person to the 
risk of serious bodily injury.”  (Emphasis added.)  HRS § 707 -722 (Unlawful 
imprisonment in the second degree) makes it a  crime to “knowingly restrain[] 
another person.” (Emphasis added.)   ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

89, 746.    
 
Even though the MPC and Hawai ʻi Pe
nal Code kidnapping 
offenses require different conduct, both codes have graded their 
kidnapping and related offenses, with each considering 
kidnapping to be the highest grade offense.  Although the Hawai ʻi 
Penal Code uses “restrain,” instead of substantial removal and 
confinement, as the conduct element in its kidnapping offense, 
the Commentary nevertheless states that kidnapping and unlawful 
imprisonment in the first and second degree “are gradations 
based upon the underlying conduct of interference with a 
person’s liberty,” and that the gradations “are based upon the 
seriousness of the circumstances or purpose attending this 
interference.”  Commentary to HRS § 707 -720 to -722.  The 
Commentary to HRS § 707
-720 to -722 notes that “the most severe 
sanctions” apply to kidnapping.  Thus, the MPC Commentary is 
still instructive for its views on the conduct necessary for the 
most severe offense: kidnapping. 
 
The MPC Commentators explained that the heightened 
“substantial removal or confinement” conduct required for 
kidnapping is supported by a dual rationale:  “first, to punish ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
 
21 (continued. . .)  
 conduct that effects substantial isolation of the victim from 
the protection of the law; but, second, to confine the offense 
to instances where the degree of removal or the duration of 
confinement coupled with the purpose of the kidnapper render the 
conduct especially terrifying and dangerous.”  Commentary to    
§ 212.1 at 223.  The Commentators noted that the “substantiality 
requirement” is intended to “preclude kidnapping liability for 
detentions merely incidental to rape and other crimes of 
violence.”  Commentary to § 212.1 at 224.  The Commentators 
provided the following example of conduct that should not be 
punished as kidnapping where prosecution for other crimes is 
more appropriate:  “[T]he rapist who forces his victim unto a 
parked car or dark alley may be punished quite severely for the 
crime of rape, but he does not thereby also become liable for 
kidnapping.”  Commentary to § 212.1 at  223-24.  This Commentary 
is highly relevant to this case, where CW testified that 
Sheffield dragged her backwards towards the bushes in order to 
“beat [her] up” or “fuck [her].”  Instead of being prosecuted 
for attempted assault in the third degree and/or a sexual 
offense, Sheffield was tried and punished solely for 
kidnapping.11 
                     
11  There was no evidence at trial regarding actual bodily injury or a 
sexual offense.  Where the defendant does not complete the underlying offense 
(whether it be assault or sexual assault or some other offense), however, the 
MPC Commentators characterized prosecution solely for kidnapping as ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
 
22 
 B.   The “Restraint” Required by Kidnapping, HRS § 707 -
720(1)(d), is Restraint in Excess of Any Restraint 
Incidental to Inflicting, or Intending to Inflict, Bodily 
Injury or Subjec
ting, or Intending to Subject, Another 
Person to a Sexual Offense 
 
 Sheffield asks this court to rule that the restraint 
necessary to support a kidnapping conviction must be restraint 
in excess of that necessary to commit an underlying un prosecuted 
crime.  As HRS § 707-720(1)(d) now stands, it is unclear whether 
the “restrain[t]” referenced in subsection (1) of the statute is 
required to be in excess of any restraint incidental to the 
infliction or intended infliction of bodily injury or subjection 
or intended subjection of a person to a sexual offense: 
(1)
  A person commits the offense of kidnapping if the 
person intentionally or knowingly restrains another person 
with intent to:  
. . . . 
(d)
  Inflict bodily injury upon that person or subject that 
person to a sexual offense. 
 
Consider two examples in which restraint could be employed 
by a defendant with the intent to inflict bodily injury or 
subject another to a sexual offense.  First, a person might grab 
another person’s arm and pull the other person a few f eet to 
land a punch, but fail to do so.  Second, a person might lead 
another by knifepoint through an alley and into a deserted 
                                                                  
(continued. . .)  
“abusive”:  “Where the underlying crime is not completed, prosecution for 
kidnapping instead of attempt may amount to an end run around the special 
doctrinal protections designed for uncompleted crimes.”  Commentary to       
§ 212.1 at 221. Hawaiʻi law, however, allows prosecution for kidnapping 
without a completed offense.     ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 warehouse, for the purpose of committing a sexual offense, but 
eventually fail.  In both instances, if the factfinder finds the 
person restricted the other person’s movement in such a manner 
as to interfere substantially with the other person’s liberty by 
means of force, the restraining conduct would come under the 
purview of HRS § 707- 720(1)(d), because restraint was used with 
the intent to inflict bodily injury or subject another person to 
a sexual offense.  The restraint exercised in the first example, 
however, is clearly incidental to the intended inflict ion of 
bodily injury,  whereas in the second example, the restraint 
exercised is much more than incidental to the intended 
subjection of a person to a sexual offense.  Nevertheless, both 
defendants may be convicted of kidnapping, which carries a 
twenty-year prison sentence.  This risk warrants the adoption of 
the rule Sheffield advocates.  
 The cases cited by Sheffield point to what has become a 
majority rule among the states:  “kidnapping statutes do not 
apply to unlawful confinements or movements ‘incidental’ to the 
commission of other felonies.”  Frank J. Wozniak, Ann otation, 
Seizure or Detention for Purpose of Committing Rape, Robbery, or 
Other Offense as Constituting Separate Crime of Kidnapping, 39 
A.L.R.5th  283, § 2[a] (1996)).  The Court of Appeals of New 
Mexico comprehensively examined this majority rule before ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
 
24 
 adopting it in State v. Trujillo, 289 P.3d 238, 240 (N.M. Ct. 
App. 2012). 
 In that case, the defendant and another man broke into a 
home.  289 P.3d at 240.  The defendant began striking one of the 
home’s occupants with a metal bar.  Id.  The victim was able to 
get on top of the defendant and hit him.  Id.  The defendant 
then held the victim and called out to the other assailant for 
help.  Id.  The other assailant struck the victim, so the 
defendant was able to break free and continue beating the 
victim.  Id.  The assault lasted approximately two to four 
minutes before both assailants left.  Id.    
 The defendant was tried and convicted of kidnapping and 
aggravated battery, among other offenses.  289 P.3d at 240.  He 
appealed his kidnapping conviction, arguing that the New Mexico 
legislature “did not intend to punish restraint incidental to an 
aggravated battery as kidnapping,” or, alternatively, that 
insufficient evidence supported his kidnapping conviction 
because “it failed to establish a restraint beyond that 
incidental to the aggravated battery.”  Id.  The Court of 
Appeals of New Mexico was persuaded by the defendant’s 
arguments.  
 The Trujillo  court examined the legislative intent, 
history, and purpose of the New Mexico kidnapping statute and 
concluded that “applying  the plain language would be ‘absurd, ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
 
25 
 unreasonable, or unjust.’”  Id.  The court concluded that the 
New Mexico legislature “could not have intended to increase 
Defendant’s punishment three - or six-fold (from three years to 
nine or eighteen years) for conduct that was merely incidental 
to another crime.”  Id.  The Trujillo court also observed that 
crimes of restraint were graded by the severity of punishment, 
from false imprisonment (the least severe), to criminal use of 
ransom (of intermediate severity), to kidnapping (the most 
severe).  289 P.3d at 247.  It reasoned that the “gradated 
system of penalties indicates that the [New Mexico] Legislature 
recognized the special harm caused by movement or isolation of a 
victim with the specified intent and sought to distinguish it 
from restraint without that intent.”  Id.   
 The Trujillo  court noted that the majority rule among other 
jurisdictions is that restraint or movement merely incidental to 
some other crime will not support a conviction for kidnapping.  
289 P.3d at 248.  In these other jurisdictions, three 
formulations of the majority rule have emerged for determining 
whether a restraint or movement is “incidental” to another 
crime.  Id.  In summary, the three tests for incidental movement 
or restraint are 
(1)  whether the confinement, movement, or detention was 
merely incidental to the accompanying crime or whether it 
was significant enough, in and of itself, to warrant 
independent prosecution.  
 ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
 
26 
 (2)
  whether the detention or movement substantially 
increased the risk of harm over and above that necessarily 
present in the accompanying crime.  
 
(3)  when the restraint or movement was done to facilitate 
the commission of another crime, the restraint or movement 
must not be slight, inconsequential, and merely incidental 
to the other crime, or be the kind of restraint or movement 
inherent in the nature of the other crime.  Under this 
test, the restraint or movement must have some significance 
independent of the other crime, in that it makes the other 
crime substantially easier to commit or substantially 
lessens the risk of detection.  
 
Id.  The Trujillo court concluded, “The basic question to which 
each of these tests is directed is whether the restraint or 
movement increases the culpability of the defendant over and 
above his culpability for the other crime.”  289 P.3d at 250 
(citations omitted).  The court noted that “facts matter” in 
kidnapping cases; therefore, whether restraint or movement is 
incidental depends upon the totality of the circumstances.  289 
P.3d at 251, 252.  Ultimately, the Trujillo court declined to 
select a specific test among the three tests,12 holding instead 
that the defendant’s momentary restraint of the victim in the  
course of a fight failed to constitute kidnapping under any of 
the tests.  289 P.3d at 250.   
 We hereby follow the majority rule outlined in Trujillo, 
and hold that the restraint necessary to support a kidnapping 
conviction under HRS § 707 -720(1)(d)  must be restraint that is 
                     
12  As a result, in New Mexico, courts analyze the defendant’s acts of 
restraint under all three tests.  See, e.g., State v. Tapia, 347 P.3d 738, 
748-49 (N.M. Ct. App. 2015).  
 ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
 
27 
 in excess of any restraint incidental to the infliction or 
intended infliction of bodily injury or subjection or intended
subjection of a person to a sexual offense.    13 
C.   Jury Instructions  
 
 Sheffield next argues that the circuit court plainly erred 
in failing to instruct the jury that the restraint necessary to 
support a conviction for kidnapping must be restraint that is 
more than merely incidental to an accompanying (but here, 
unprosecuted) crime.  For the reasons stated in the previous 
section, we agree.  Such instructional error cannot be said to 
be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where, as here, there was 
a reasonable possibility that the failure to give the 
instruction contributed to Sheffield’s kidnapping conviction.     
                     
13  As the issues are not before us, we do not address the restraint 
necessary to support a conviction for “kidnapping” based on the other 
subsections of HRS 707 -720(1): 
 
(1) . . . intentionally or knowingly restrain[ing] another 
person with intent to (a) Hold that person for ransom or 
reward; (b) Use that person as a shield or hostage;  (c) 
Facilitate the commission of a felony or flight thereafter;  
. . . (e) Terrorize that person or a third person;  (f) 
Interfere with the performance of any governmental or 
political function; or  (g) Unlawfully obtain the labor or 
services of that person, regardless of whether related to 
the collection of a debt.   
 
We also do not address the restraint necessary to support a conviction for 
“unlawful imprisonment in the first degree” under HRS § 707 -721 (“A person 
commits the offense of unlawful imprisonment in the first degree if the 
person knowingly restrains another person under circumstances which expose 
the person to the risk of serious bodily injury ”) or “unlawful imprisonment 
in the second degree”  under HRS § 707- 722 (“A person commits the offense of 
unlawful imprisonment in the second degree if the person knowingly restrains 
another person.”). 
 ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
 
28 
  In examining kidnapping jury instructions from other 
states, we note that New Mexico’s kidnapping statute is 
substantially similar to ours, in that it defines kidnapping, in 
pertinent part, as “the unlawful . . . res training . . . of a 
person, by force, . . . with intent . . . to inflict . . . 
physical injury or a sexual offense on the victim.”14  N.M. Stat. 
Ann. § 30-4-1 (A)(4) (West 1978).15   
  After adopting the majority rule concerning incidental 
restraint in Trujillo, New Mexico amended its pattern jury 
instruction on kidnapping to require the State “to prove that 
the ‘taking or restraint . . . of [the victim] was not slight, 
inconsequential, or merely incidental to the commission of 
another crime[.]’”  State v. Sen a, 419 P.3d 1240, 1248 (N.M. Ct. 
                     
14  Again, HRS § 707 -720(1)(d) defines “kidnapping” as “intentionally or 
knowingly restrain[ing] another person with intent to . . . [i]nflict bodily 
injury upon that person or subject that person to a sexual offense.”  
 
15  The full kidnapping statute provides the following:  
A. Kidnapping is the unlawful taking, restraining, 
transporting or confining of a person, by force, 
intimidation or deception, with intent:  
(1) that the victim be held for ransom;  
(2) that the victim be held as a hostage or shield and 
confined against his will;  
(3) that the victim be hel d to service against the victim’ s 
will; or 
(4) to inflict death, physical injury or a sexual offense 
on the victim.  
B. Whoever commits kidnapping is guilty of a first degree 
felony, except that he is guilty of a second degree felony 
when he voluntarily frees the victim in a safe place and 
does not inflict physical injury or a sexual offense upon 
the victim.

16  The full New Mexico Uniform Jury Instruction on Kidnapping reads as 
follows, with footnotes omitted : 
 
For you to find the defendant guilty of [first degree] 
kidnapping [as charged in Count 
__________ ], the state 
must prove to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt

30 
  The wisdom of adopting a similar pattern jury 
instruction is clear to us.17  We hold that the circuit 
court in this case plainly erred in not instructing the 
jury that Sheffield’s restraint of CW had to be restraint 
in excess of restraint incidental to any intended 
infliction of bodily injury or a sexual offense  upon CW.  
D.   Substantial Evidence Supports Sheffield’s Kidnapping  
 Conviction   
 
 We must now address Sheffield’s first point of error on 
appeal, in which he alleges insufficient evidence supported the 
kidnapping conviction, because the restraint Sheffield used 
against CW was only the restraint necessary to commit the 
incidental and unprosecuted offense, assault in the third 
degree.  The double jeopardy clause of article I, section 10 of 
the Hawai ʻi Constitution requires a reviewing appellate court to 
address a defendant’s express claim of insufficiency of the 
evidence prior to remanding for a new trial based on trial 
error.  State v. Davis
, 133 Hawaiʻ i 102, 118, 324 P.3d 912, 928 
(2014).  Under our precedent, substantial evidence supports 
Sheffield’s conviction.  
 Generally speaking, Hawai ʻi appellate kidnapping cases have 
affirmed kidnapping convictions based on acts of restraint by 
                     
17  We suggest that the Standing Committee on Pattern Jury Instructions — 
Criminal craft an instruction for Hawai ʻi consistent with this opinion.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 force that were longer in duration and more severe than the 
restraint used by Sheffield.  See , e.g., Halemanu , 3 Haw. App. 
300, 650 P.2d 587 (affirming kidnapping conviction after 
concluding that appellant restrained the victim when he entered 
the victim’s car and directed the victim to drive wherever the 
appellant directed him, which ended up being from Honolulu to 
Waianae and back); Yamamoto , 98 Hawai ʻi 208, 46 P.3
d 1092 
(affirming kidnapping conviction after concluding that appellant 
restrained the victim by forcing her into a car at knifepoint, 
driving to his apartment complex, then forcing her through a 
parking lot at knifepoint); Valdivia , 95 Hawaiʻi 465, 24 P.3d 661 
(affirming kidnapping conviction after concluding that appellant 
restrained a police officer by pinning the police officer’s arm 
against the steering wheel of a moving vehicle, then dragging 
the officer 30 yards); State v. Veikoso, 126 Hawaiʻ i 267, 270 
P.3d 997 (2011) (affirming kidnapping conviction after 
concluding that the defendant restrained CW by force by grabbing 
her phone, striking her in the face and the back of the head 
several times, grabbing her hair, and pulling her down to the 
center console of his car, causing her to bleed and black out, 
grabbing her hair again, and hitting her on the back of the 
head). 
 In Hernandez , 61 Haw. 475, 605 P.2d 75, however, this court 
affirmed a co-defendant’s kidnapping conviction based on a ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     *** 
 
 
32 
 fleeting moment of restraint.  In that case, Hernandez and a co-
defendant, Miller, had driven a woman up to a deserted area on 
Waialae Iki Ridge.  61 Haw. at 476, 605 P.2d at 76.  Miller 
sexually assaulted the woman multiple times on the mountain 
ridge while Hernandez waited in the car.  Id.   When the woman 
ran up to the car, Hernandez grabbed her and pushed her to the 
ground, and at that point, Miller reached the woman and resumed 
his attack.  61 Haw. at 477, 605 P.2d at 77.  This court held, 
“Even though of short duration, under such circumstances the 
actions of [Hernandez] constituted a substantial interference 
with the victim’s liberty and, accordingly, a prohibited 
restraint.”  61 Haw. at 479, 605 P.2d at 78.  The Hernandez 
court quoted the Commentary to HRS § 702 -720 to -722 to note 
that “a short restraint in an area where the victim might 
suffocate or come to other bodily harm would constitute a 
substantial interference with liberty. . . .”  61 Haw. at 478 -
79, 605 P.2d at 77.  It is clear in the Hernandez  case that 
Hernandez’s restraint of the woman occurred in an area where she 
might come to other bodily harm, as the woman was in the process 
of being sexually assaulted by Miller in a deserted area of 
Waialae Iki Ridge.  Thus, the kidnapping conviction was 
affirmed.  61 Haw. at 480, 605 P.2d at 78.   
In evaluating sufficiency, we view the evidence adduced in 
the trial court in the strongest light for the prosecution.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 Applying this standard, substantial or “credible evidence of 
sufficient quality and probative va lue” exists to “enable a 
person of reasonable caution” to conclude that Sheffield’s 
restraint of CW was more than merely incidental to his attempt 
to assault CW.  Matavale, 115 Hawai i at 1
57-58, 166 P.3d at 330-
31.  A reasonable juror could conclude that Sheffield’s act of 
grabbing onto the loop of CW’s backp ack and dragging her 
backwards five to ten steps was an intentional or knowing act 
that restricted CW’s movement so as to substantially interfere 
with her liberty by use of force, and that this restraint was in
excess of any restraint incidental to any intended infliction of
bodily injury or to any intended subjection of CW to a sexual 
offense;  Sheffield’s statements that he was going to “beat [CW]
up” or “fuck [her]” allowed the jury to make a reasonable 
inference that Sheffield intentionally or knowingly restrained 
CW in this way with an intent to inflict bodily injury or 
subject CW to a sexual offense.    
 
 
Sheffield’s sufficiency of the evidence point of error 
therefore lacks merit.
