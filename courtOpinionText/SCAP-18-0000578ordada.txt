APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CAAP-18-0000578; CIVIL NO. 13-1-0848(2))
ORDER (1) DENYING MOTION TO STRIKE PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS,
AND (2) DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of (1) petitioners’ petition for
writ of mandamus, filed on August 10, 2018, (2) respondents’
motion to strike petition for writ of mandamus, filed on August
20, 2018, (3) petitioners’ memorandum in opposition to motion to
strike petition for writ of mandamus, filed on August 27, 2018,
the respective supporting documents, and the record, it appears
that petitioners are currently seeking appellate relief in CAAP-
18-0000578 and, based on the posture of the underlying case,
petitioners fail to demonstrate that they are entitled to the
requested extraordinary writ.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# iElectronically Filed

18-SEP-2018
04:16 PM200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is
an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack
of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
obtain the requested action; such a writ is not intended to
supersede the legal discretionary authority of the lower court,
nor is it intended to serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal
appellate procedures).  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion to strike is
denied.
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for writ
of mandamus is denied.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, September 18, 2018.
