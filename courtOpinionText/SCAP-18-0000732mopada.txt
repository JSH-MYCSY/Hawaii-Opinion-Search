  2  rulings of the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit
 (“circuit 
court”)
 in appeals from decisions of the 
Hawaiʻi La bor Relations 
Board (“HLRB”).  UPW first appeals the circuit court’s2 December 
3, 2008 interlocutory decision and order vacating the  June 8, 
2007 HLRB order granting UP W’s motion for summary judgment.   
The HLRB’s June 8, 2007 order had concluded James Ah Sing 
(“Ah Sing”), who had been a custodian at Connections Public 
Charter School (“Connections”)  from 2000 to 2003, was covered by 
the terms of a March 15, 2004 stipulation signed by parties that 
included UPW and the Department of Education of the State of 
Hawaiʻi (“DOE” ) in another HLRB case concerning 
civil service 
employees at public charter schools.  The HLRB had ordered Ah 
Sing be reinstated to his position.   
The circuit court’s December 3, 2008 order vacated  the 
HLRB’s June 8, 2007 interlocutory summary judgment order on the 
bases that there were genuine issues of material fact as to (1) 
whether Ah Sing was a member of bargaining Unit 1 at the time of 
his termination; and (2)
 whether Ah Sing was intended to be in 
the class of workers covered by the stipulation in the other 
HLRB matter.   
On remand, the HLRB ruled in favor of the DOE, and on 
appeal, the circuit court affirmed.  UPW therefore also appeals 
                     
2  The Honorable Glenn S. Hara presided.  ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
  
  3  the circuit court’s affirmance of the HLRB’s  rulings on remand.   
UPW raises four points of error on appeal.  UPW ’s first 
point of error maintains that,  in the first appeal, the circuit 
court erred in failing to recognize the violation of merit 
principles and the public policy favoring civil service when it 
vacated the HLR B’s interlocutory ruling that Ah Sing was a civil 
service member of UPW bargaining Unit 1, who was included in the 
stipulation in the
 other HL RB matter.   
We agree  with UPW on its first point of error on appeal 
that the circuit court erred in vacating the HLRB’s June 8, 2007 
interlocutory 
summary judgment order.   We therefore need not and 
do not address UPW’s remaining issues on appeal, and we remand 
this matter to the HLRB for further proceedings consistent with 
this memorandum opinion.3   
II.  Background  
 
A. Ah Sing ’s employment at Connections  
Ah Sing was initially appointed on September 5, 2000,  to a 
nineteen-hours-per- week part-time custodia l position at 
Connections at its Mountain View campus.  All Connections 
                     
3  In summary, UPW’s second through fourth points of error arising out of 
the second appeal to the circuit court allege the circuit court erred in: 
failing to address UPW ’s argument that if Ah Sing was in fact not a civil 
service employee, Connections and  the DOE were required to bargain with UPW 
prior to contracting out his position; affirming HLRB ’s application of the 
exhaustion doctrine to Ah Sing ’s claim; and affirming the denial of UPW ’s 
motion to amend its complaint to include a violation of the stipulation 
between UPW and the DOE. ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
  
 4  employees were appointed by the local school board on a year
-to-
year basis with a not to exceed ( “NTE”) date of June 30th of 
each school year.  Ah Sing ’s initial appointment was classified 
“exempt,” with a NTE date of June 30, 2001.  
Effective February 8, 2001, after Connections moved from 
the Mountain View campus to downtown Hilo, Ah Sing ’s employment 
was increased to full- time (40 hours per week) .  At that time, 
Ah Sing became a member of UPW bargaining Unit 1.  An employee 
personnel action report dated July 23, 2001, stated that, as of 
that date, Ah Sing was in a temporary, exempt, at-will position 
(“Position No. 111418 ”), and that the employment could “be 
terminated at any time within 24 hours notice. ”  
On January 2, 2001, however, the then-DOE Personnel 
Director had memorialized a directive that, beginning with the 
2001-02 school year, all charter schools ’ employees would be in 
“temporary civil service positions” that would be filled 
applying normal civil service rules.  On July 23, 2001, Ah Sing 
therefore submitted an application for a “Custodian II ” civil 
service position, and  on the next day, Connections recommended 
Ah Sing to a limited term appointment ( “LTA”) as a temporary 
“School Custodian II, ” with a NTE date of June 30, 2002.4  Ah 
                     
4 This is consistent with the January 2, 2001 DOE memorialized  directive 
that, beginning with the 2001 -02 school year, all public charter school 
positions would be “temporary civil service positions ” and filled in 
accordance with normal civil service procedures.  ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
  
  5  Sing completed the civil service application paperwork
, and on 
August 1, 2001, Ah Sing submitted a separation notice for his 
custodian Position No. 111418 to accept DOE civil service 
Position No. 56376 .  Ah Sing was informed that his job had 
changed to a civil service position, and an August 22, 2001 
employee personnel action report indicates : (1) Ah Sing  was 
rehired as a School Custodian II in Position No. 56376 effective 
August 2, 2001;  (2) his appointment was for a limited term, with 
a NTE date of June 30, 2002; and (3) he was a member of 
bargaining Unit 1.   
An employee personnel action report for Ah Sing dated 
October 17, 2002
, for the 2002- 03 school year reflected that Ah 
Sing was appointed to the School Custodian II Position No. 56376 
with a NTE date of June 30, 2003,  and that effective July 2, 
2002, his position was “[c]onver[ted] ” to a civil service member 
from a probationary appointment.   This report also states  that 
“[t]he personnel actions shown above have been taken in 
compliance with the provisions of Chapter[] 76 [], HRS, as 
amended.”  H awaiʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”)  Chapter 76 is the 
“Civil Service Law.”     
As noted, from the 2001 -02 school year, the DOE had 
officially been treating public charter school employees as 
civil service employees.  On June 9, 2003, however, the then-
Director of the State of Hawai ʻi D
epartment of Human Resources ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
  
  6   Development (“ DHRD”) wrote to the then -Superintendent of the DOE 
stating the DHRD’s position was that employees of public charter 
schools did not have civil service status and that the DHRD had 
been unaware until a few days before that its lists of eligible 
employees were being used to fill public charter school 
positions. 
  
In the meantime, a 
May 6, 2003 Connections letter addressed 
to Ah Sing indicated the school board had taken action the day 
before “to decline to renew your 89 d ay contract as of June 30, 
2003.”  No reason was stated in the letter.  A DOE “Separation 
Notice” for “Classified Personnel” was signed by Ah Sing on June 
27, 2003, and it indicated a separation date effective June 30, 
2003, from the School Custodian II Position No. 56376.  The 
notice was signed by a  Connections representative on June 30, 
2003, and by the DOE Assistant or Complex Area Superintendent on 
July 8, 2003.  
 A July 17, 2003 letter from the Connections “CEO” to Ah 
Sing stated the school board had decided to eliminate Ah Sing ’s 
position “given the limited funds we will be receiving for the 
coming school year.”  After Ah Sing’s position was eliminated, 
custodial work was performed at Connections by non- bargaining 
unit employees, an independent contractor paid for by the 
school’s landlord, and non- profit entities.  ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

  B. UPW =s HLRB complaints  
 1. UPW’s complaint on behalf of Ah Sing  
On August 18, 2003, UPW filed a prohibited practices 
complaint with the HLRB, challenging the non- renewal of Ah 
Sing’s custodian position at Connections.5  In the complaint, UPW 
alleged that DOE and Connections ( collectively, “Employer ”) 
violated the collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) with UPW,  
and HRS Chapter 89, by terminating Ah Sing.  Specifically, the 
complaint alleged
 the non-renewal of Ah Sing ’s position (1) 
willfully violated various terms of the bargaining Unit 1 CBA in 
violation of HRS § 89-13(a)(8) (1993); and (2) constituted a 
willful refusal and failure to comply with the duty to bargain 
in good faith over mid- term changes in wages, hours of work, 
other terms and conditions of employment under HRS §§  89-3 
(Supp. 2000) and 89-9(a) (Supp. 2000),6 and the duty to recognize

§ 89-8(a) (1993).7  
UPW’s complaint also alleged Employer’s “willful refusal and 
failure to comply with the provisions of [HRS] chapter 89 ” 
constituted prohibited practices under HRS §§  89-13(a)(1), (5), 
and (7).8  Ah Sing’s September 23, 2003 amended complaint added a

Prohibited practices; evidence of bad faith.  (a) It shall 
be a prohibited practice for a public employer or its 
designated representative wilfully to:  
 
(1)   Interfere, restrain, or coerce any employee in

violation of layoff rights under section 12 of 
the CBA.   
2. The UPW complaint against the DOE and the UPW/DOE 
stipulation   
 
 At the time 
Ah Sing’s HLRB complaint was filed, the status 
and rights of employees at public charter schools w ere the 
subject of various additional UPW filings before the  HLRB.9  
Before filing Ah Sing ’s complaint, on July 3, 2003, UPW and the 
Hawaiʻi Government Employees Association ( “HGEA”) filed a 
prohibited practice complaint with the HLRB on behalf of all 
employees in bargaining Units 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, against the 
then-Director of the DHRD and then -Governor  of the State of 
Hawaiʻi, regarding the civil service status of public employees 
at charter schools (“UPW complaint ”).  The UPW complaint , which 
was later amended to add the DOE and the Board of Education 
(“BOE”), alleged that the DHRD ’s position  that charter school 
employees were not civil service employees and the DOE ’s 
subsequent implementation of the DHRD directive violated the 
collective bargaining rights of affected charter school 
                                                                 
(continued. . .)  
 
. . . . 
 
(7)  Refuse or fail to comply with any provision of 
this chapter; [or]  
(8) Violate the terms of a collective bargaining  
agreement[.]  
 
9 HLRB Case Nos. CE -01-537a, CE -02-537b, CE- 03-537c, and CE -04-537d. ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
  
  10 employees.  
 
 On July 3, 2003, UPW had obtained from the DOE’s Hawai ʻi 
Regional Office’s Personnel Regional Officer  in Hilo a list of 
Big Island public charter school employees who might be impacted 
by the DHRD ’s June 9, 2003 directive that public charter school 
employees were not civil service employees.  The list provided 
to UPW by the DOE included Ah Sing.   
 On March 15, 2004, UPW, 
the HGEA, the DOE, and the BOE 
entered into a stipulation and order in the UPW complaint 
(“UPW/DOE stipulation ”).  The UPW/DOE stipulation provided in 
relevant part as follows:  
1. The UPW is an employee organization and the exclusive  
representative, as provided under HRS § 89 -2, of 
employees in bargain unit 01, non- supervisory 
employees in blue collar positions.  
 
 . . . . 
 
4. The UPW
 [] and the State  of Hawaii are at all times 
relevant herein part[y] to the collective bargaining 
agreement[] covering employees in bargaining unit  01 
. . . . 
 
5. Class
ified employees of the [DOE] covered by these 
collective bargaining agreements have historically 
and customarily been part of the “merit” or “civil 
service” system of the State of Hawaii.  There are 
approximately 150 classified positions of DOE which 
are in public charter schools and covered by such 
civil service system.  
 
6. The collective bargaining agreements contain 
provisions for the maintenance of prior rights of 
employees pursuant to civil service statutes and 
rules, and require negotiations before changes in 
conditions of work may be implemented.  
 
7. On or about June 9, 2003 the Department of Human 
Resources Development (DHRD) informed Employer of its 
position (and policy) that employees of public 
charter schools in the DOE “do not have civil service ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
  
  11 status
” and are no longer part of the merit system.  
 
      8. On or about June 12, 2003 DHRD requeste
d Employer to 
“convert all public charter school positions to 
reflect the fact that these positions do not have 
civil service status ” by June 30, 2003, and 
thereafter informed Employer that DHRD would not 
provide “ certified lists of eligible applicants ” and 
“civil service appointments may not be made to fill 
public charter school positions. ” 
 
      9. On and after July 8, 2003 the aforementioned DHRD 
position, policy, and actions were communicated to 
public charter school administrators and employees.  
 
      10. As a direct consequence various public charter school 
employees (in order to preserve and maintain their 
civil service status, rights and benefits), initiated 
transfers and other changes in their terms and 
conditions of work.  
 
      11. As a further consequence on or about July 1, 2003 and 
thereafter, DOE failed to process for hiring 
approximately fifteen (15) or more public charter 
school employees in classified positions through the 
statewide merit system for compliance with civil 
service requirements, and as a result these employees 
are currently exempt from civil service coverage.  
 
 . . . . 
 
      14.  Employer hereby stipulates and agrees to cease and 
desist from implementing the aforementioned DHRD 
position or policy regarding loss of civil service 
status for public charter school positions and 
employees, and to make whole all adversely  [affected]  
employees (including but not limited to the 
restoration or return of said employees to their 
former public charter school positions without loss 
of rights, privileges, and benefits).  
 
      15.  Within 30 days from the date of this Stipulation and 
Order Employer shall process all currently exempt 
public charter school employees in classified 
positions through the statewide merit system and 
restore them to civil service status.  All classified 
positions in public charter school s shall be restored 
to the merit system within thirty days.  
 
          3 . HLRB order g ranting UPW ’s motion for summary judgment 
in Ah Sing ’s case  
 
     On March 16, 2004, UPW filed a motion for summary  
judgment in Ah Sing’s c ase before the HLRB, con tending it was ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
  
  12 entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on the UPW/DOE 
stipulation because Ah Sing fell within the affected class of 
the UPW/DOE stipulat
ion.  In support of its motion, UPW 
attached: (1) a 
copy of the UPW/DOE stipulation; (2) Ah Sing ’s 
declaration stating he was notified on June 27, 2003, that his 
civil service position was not being renewed; (3) a copy of Ah 
Sing’s separation notice from the DOE; and (4) the July 17, 2003 
letter from Connections to Ah Sing stating Ah Sing ’s position 
was being eliminated due to limited funding.  
In their memorandum in opposition,  Employer argued that UPW 
failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that Ah Sing was 
adversely affected by the DHRD ’s position that public charter 
school employees were not entitled to civil service status and 
were thus covered by the UPW/DOE stipulation.  Employer  
contended UPW could not meet this burden because the school 
board decided on May 5, 2003, to not renew Ah Sing ’s temporary 
appointment, which was before the DHRD announced its policy.  In 
support of its memorandum, Employer attached a declaration from 
a DOE personnel specialist stating that “it is [her] 
understanding that the decision not to renew Mr. Ah Sing =s 
temporary appointment was based upon cost or funding concerns -  
not civil service status[]  . . . [and] that the decision . . . 
was made on or about May 5, 2003. ”   
The HLRB held a hearing on UPW ’s motion on March 29, 2004, ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
  
  13 where the parties presented their arguments.  
On June 8, 2007, 
the HLRB entered an order granting UPW’ s motion for summary 
judgment.  In its order, the HLRB stated  Ah Sing’s employment 
status and treatment by the DOE and Connections were “hopelessly 
muddled[]” and that “[t]he record reflects at least six 
alternative representations[ ,]” but that i t was unnecessary to 
sort through the “minutia of [Ah Sing ’s] particular 
circumstance”  because “Ah Sing was in all probability the victim 
of the confusion surrounding the employment rights and status of 
public charter school workers[.] ”  The HLRB concluded Ah Sing 
fell within the terms of the UPW/DOE stipulation and ordered his 
reinstatement.   
C. First appeal to the circuit court   
 1. Parties’ briefs   
Employer  filed a notice of appeal to the circuit court on 
July 27, 2007.   In its opening brief, Employer claimed the 
HLRB’s grant of summary judgment was improper because there were 
genuine issues
 of material fact.  Employer  argued the HLRB ’s 
order itself acknowledged factual disputes.  Employer  also 
asserted Connections could not be found to have will fully 
engaged in a prohibited practice based on the entry of the 
UPW/DOE stipulation because Connections was not a party to the 
stipulation.  
Employer  also claimed the HLRB exceeded its 
authority and jurisdiction by ordering Ah Sing ’s reinstatement ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
  
  14 to a position that no longer existed.    
The HLRB’s answering brief noted that, after hearing 
arguments, it had concluded there were no issues of material 
fact and that UPW was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  
Based on the circumstances surrounding Ah Sing ’s termination, 
the HLRB maintained that “Ah Sing should have been reinstated to 
his position or a similar position as were other classified 
charter school employees by the [UPW/DOE stipulation] ” and 
viewed Employer’s  failure to do so as both violating the UPW/DOE 
stipulation and breaching the CBA.  With respect to Respondent’s 
argument that the HLRB had exceeded its jurisdiction by ordering 
Ah Sing’s reinstatement, the HLRB noted its broad authority to 
fashion remedies for unfair or prohibited practices.  The HLRB 
cited this court ’s opinion  in Del Monte Fresh Produce (Hawaii), 
Inc. v. Int ernational Longshore and  Warehouse Union, Local 142, 
AFL-CIO, 112 Hawai ʻi 489, 508
-10, 146 P.3d 1066, 1085- 87 (2006), 
which held that the HLRB had not abused its discretion in 
fashioning a substantive remedy for laid- off employees.   In Del 
Monte, this court noted that because the “legislature empowered 
the HLRB with discretion in ordering affirmative remedies ” and 
because discretion is a flexible concept, only an arbitrary or 
capricious decision by the HLRB would be an abuse of discretion.  
112 Hawaiʻ i at 508- 09, 146 P.3d at 1085- 86.  The HLRB requested 
that, absent a showing it had abused its discretion, the circuit ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
  
  15 court affirm its remedial order. 
 
2. Circuit court order vacating the HLRB ’s order g ranting 
UPW’s motion for summary judgment   
 
After oral arguments, on December 3, 2008, the circuit 
court entered its decision and order vacating the HLRB's order 
granting UPW's motion for summary judgment in Civil No.  07-1-
314.  The circuit court found the HLRB erroneously granted UPW ’s 
motion for summary judgment because there were genuine issues of 
material fact as to: (1) whether Ah Sing was a member of 
bargaining Unit 1 at the time of his termination; and 
(2) whether Ah Sing was intended to be in the class of workers 
covered by the UPW/DOE stipulation.  The circuit court thus 
vacated the HLRB ’s order g ranting UPW ’s motion for summary 
judgment.  
D. HLRB proceedings  on remand 
 On remand, in summary, in its July 9 , 2014 Order No. 3005, 
the HLRB denied Employer ’s motion to dismiss for lack of subject 
matter jurisdiction, denied Employer ’s alternative motion for 
summary judgment because the circuit court had overturned the 
HLRB’s grant of summary judgment in favor of UPW based on 
alleged genuine issues of material fact
, and denied UPW’s motion 
to amend the Ah Sing complaint to add a claim for breach of the ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
  
16 (continued. . .)  
  UPW/DOE stipulation.10  The HLRB reasoned that, if Ah Sing was 
covered by the UPW/DOE stipulation, there was already an amended 
UPW/HGEA complaint against the DOE in Case No. CE- 01-537a 
alleging a violation of the UPW/DOE stipulation and that, 
therefore, amending the Ah Sing complaint to add a claim against 
the DOE would result in two complaints for the same controversy, 
in violation of Hawai ʻi Administrative Rules ( “HAR
”) § 12-42-
42(f) (1981).11 
The HLRB then conducted a hearing on the prohibited 
practices complaint on October 22,  and 23, 2014, December 11, 
2014, and May 21, 2015.  On August 16, 2017, the HLRB  entered 
Decision No. 491 with its findings of fact, conclusions of law, 
and an order dismissing Ah Sing’s complaint.  The HLRB made 
numerous findings of facts  and concluded: (1) Ah Sing was a 
bargaining Unit 1 member at the time that he was terminated and 
was required to exhaust his contractual remedies before filing 
the complaint;12 (2) Ah Sing was not covered by the UPW/DOE 
                     
10 The HLRB also denied UPW ’s motion to amend to add claims for: (1) 
breach of the ninety -day layoff notice provision in the CBA; (2) breach of 
the HLRB’ s oral ruling in Ah Sing’ s case; and (3) attorney ’s fees and costs; 
these denials were not appealed.  
11  HAR § 12-42-42(f) states: “ Only one complaint shall issue against a 
party with respect to a single controversy. ” 
12 The HLRB noted in Decision No. 491  that it had declined to dismiss the 
complaint based on Ah Sing =s alleged failure to exhaust remedies twice before:

  stipulation because (a) he was not employed by the DOE in March 
2004 when the stipulation became effective; (
b) Ah Sing ’s 
limited term position was eliminated due to lack of funding and 
not the DHRD’s directive; and (c) the law of the case did not 
constrain the HLRB ’s conclusion because its initial decision was 
vacated by the circuit court; (3) UPW failed to carry its burden 
of showing that the DOE contravened the duty to bargain in good 
faith in violation of HRS §§  89-13(a)(1), (5), and (7); and 
(4) Connections willfully retaliated against Ah Sing by 
cancelling his rubbish hauling contract in violation of HRS 
§ 89-13(a)(4), but that UPW failed to show that the retaliatory 
conduct violated HRS §  89-13(a)(1) by interfering with Ah Sing ’s 
right to bargain collectively.13

The Board concludes that the evidence on remand was 
“substantially different ” on this issue because unlike the 
record at the time of the first and second motions to 
dismiss, the record on remand is undisputed that Ah Sing 
was a Unit 1 member.  For this reason, the Board, in its 
discretion, reconsiders the exhaustion issue and agrees 
with [Employer] based on the record that because Ah Sing 
was a Unit 1 member at the time of his termination, he was 
required  to file a grievance and exhaust[] his contractual 
remedies[.] ”

III.  Standards of review 
A. Secondary a ppeals 
Review of a decision made by the circuit court upon 
its review of an agency ’s decision is a secondary appeal.  
The standard of review is one in which [the appellate] 
court must determine whether the circuit court was right or 
wrong in its decision, applying the standards set forth in 
HRS § 91-14(g) [(1993)] to the agency’ s decision.  
 
HRS § 91-14, entitled “Judicial review of contested 
cases,” provides in relevant part:  
 
 (g) Upon review of the record the court may affirm 
 the decision of the agency or remand the case with 
 instructions for further proceedings ; or it may 
 reverse or modify the decision and order if the 
 substantial rights of the petitioners may have been 
 prejudiced because the administrative findings, 
 conclusions, decisions, or orders are:  
 
 (1)  In violation of constitutional or 
 statutory provisions; or    
 
 
 (2)  In excess of the statutory authority or 
 jurisdiction of the agency; or   
  
 (3)  Made upon unlawful procedure; or

B. Summary judgment  
 An appellate court reviews a grant of summary judgment de 
novo: 
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions,  answers to interrogatories, and admissions on 
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there 
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the 
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.   A 
fact is material if proof of that fact would have the 
effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential 
elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the 
parties.   The evidence must be viewed in the light most 
favorable to the non -moving party.  In other words, we must 
view all of the evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in 
the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.

  20 IV.  D
iscussion  
In its opening brief, UPW raises the following points of 
error: 
1.  The circuit court erroneously failed to recognize the clear 
violation  of the merit principles and public policy 
favoring civil service when it vacated the [HLRB ’s] prior 
grant of summary judgment and then affirmed the [HLRB ’s] 
later conclusion that the [UPW/DOE stipulation] and order 
did not extend to Ah Sing and his civil service position at 
Connections.  
 
2.  The circuit court erroneously failed to recognize 
[Employer’s]  duty to negotiate over the elimination of 
Connections ’ only unit 1 employee and their duty to bargain 
over the decision of privatizing the work if Ah Sing was in 
fact not a civil service employee.  
 
3.  The circuit court erred in affirming the [HLRB ’s] 
abrogation of its exclusive original jurisdiction as 
delegated by the legislature when HLRB misapplied the 
exhaustion doctrine to refuse to decide [UPW ’s] claims for 
violations of the [CBA] under [HRS § 89-13(a)(8)].  
 
4.  The circuit court erroneously determined that the [HLRB] 
did not err in denying [UP W’s] motion to amend the original 
complaint to include the violation of the [UPW/DOE 
stipulation].  
 
 As noted  earlier, we agree with UPW’s first point of error 
on appeal.  For the reasons explained below, the circuit court 
erred in vacating the HLRB’s June 8, 2007 order granting summary 
judgment in favor of UPW on the grounds that there were genuine 
issues of material fact as to: (1) whether Ah Sing was a member 
of bargaining Unit 1 at the time of his termination; and 
(2) whether Ah Sing was intended to be in the class of workers 
covered by the UPW/DOE stipulation.  
Based upon our de novo 
review, the circuit court erred because there were no such 
genuine issues of 
material fact.  We therefore need not and do ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
  
  21 not address UPW’s remaining issues on appeal, and we remand this 
matter to the HLRB for further proceedings consistent with this 
memorandum opinion.  
 First,  there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding 
whether Ah Sing was a member of  bargaining Unit 1 at the time of 
his termination.  When Ah Sing accepted DOE civil service  
Position No. 56376 in August 2001, the August 22, 2001 employee 
personnel action report clearly indicated he was a member of 
bargaining Unit 1.  His employee personnel action report of 
October 17, 2002,  for the school year ending June 30, 2003,  also 
clearly indicated he was a member of bargaining Unit 1.  Thus, 
the circuit court erred by ruling in its December 3, 2008 
decision and order that the HLRB erred in granting UPW’s motion 
for summary judgment on the grounds that there was a genuine 
issue of material fact as to whether Ah Sing was a member of 
bargaining Unit 1 at the time of his termination on June 30, 
2003.   
 The circuit court also based its vacatur of the HLRB’s June 
8, 2007 summary judgment order, however,  based on its conclusion 
that there was also a genuine issue of material fact as to 
whether Ah Sing was intended to be covered by the UPW/DOE 
stipulation.  The HLRB’s June 8, 2007 decision did state that 
“[t]he record reflects at least six alternative representations 
of [Ah Sing’ s] employment status and consequent reasons for ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
  
  22 termination[,] ” and that  “Ah Sing was in all probability the 
victim of the confusion surrounding the employment rights and 
status of public charter school workers[.] ”  These observations, 
however, do not raise genuine issues of material fact as to 
whether or not Ah Sing was covered by the UPW/DOE stipulation.   
 Ah Sing’s employee personnel action report of October 17, 
2002, for the school year ending June 30, 2003,  indicates he was 
hired effective July 2, 2002, in DOE civil service Position No. 
56376 for a one- year period with a NTE date of June 30, 2003, 
and that he was a member of bargaining Unit 1.  Also, the DOE 
itself included Ah Sing in the July 3, 2003 list of Big Island 
public charter school employees impacted by the DHRD ’s June 9, 
2003 directive that public charter school employees were not 
civil service employees .   
 The plain language of the UPW/DOE stipulation states it 
applied to “approximately 150 classified posit ions of DOE [] in 
public charter schools [] covered by [ the] civil service system”  
(paragraph 5), which included bargaining Unit 1 employees 
(paragraphs 1 and 4), for whom DOE was informed that “[o]n or 
about June 9, 2003 . . .  that employees of public charter 
schools in the DOE ‘do not have civil service status’ ” 
(paragraph 7). 
 In paragraph 14 of the stipulation, Employer agreed to 
“cease and desist from implementing the aforementioned DHRD ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
  
  23 position or policy regarding loss of civil service status for 
public charter school positions and employees[.]”  The 
“aforementioned” DHRD position or policy included  the DHRD’s 
statement that “[o]n or about June 9, 2003 . . . that employees 
of public charter schools in the DOE ‘do not have civil service 
status’” (paragraph 7), which included Ah Sing, who was still a 
civil service public charter school employee as of that date.  
Then, as stated in paragraph 6 of the UPW/DOE stipulation, 
“[t]he collective bargaining agreements contain provisions for 
the maintenance of prior rights of employees pursuant to civil 
service statutes and rules, and require negotiations before 
changes in condition s of work may be implemented.”  Ah Sing had 
such civil service rights as a bargaining Unit 1 civil service 
employee.  
 Employer argu es that despite including Ah Sing’s name in 
the list of employees affected by the DHRD’s June 9, 2003 
directive in its July 3, 2003 letter to UPW, Ah Sing was not 
included in the stipulation because he had been notified in May 
6, 2003, that Connections would not be renewing his contract due 
to budget limitations.  This, however, is not a  genuine issue of 
material fact as to whether Ah Sing was covered by the UPW/DOE ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
  
  24 stipulation.16  The stipulation included  civil service bargaining 
Unit 1 public charter school employees  as of June 9, 2003, when 
the DHRD stated he did not enjoy civil service rights.  Ah Sing 
was denied rights as a civil service employee, which existed 
whether or not Connections had reduced funding.  Therefore, he 
is included in the UPW/DOE  stipulation, and the circuit court 
also erred in vacating  the HLRB’s June 8, 2007 summary judgment 
order based on its conclusion that there was a genuine issue of 
material fact as to whether Ah Sing was intended to be covered 
by the UPW/DOE stipulation. 
 Accordingly, we need not address UPW’s additional points of 
error arising out of the HLRB’s decisions after remand.  
V.  Conclusion 
 Based on the reasons explained above, we remand this matter 
to the HLRB for further proceedings consistent with this 
memorandum opinion.  If the remedy ordered by the HLRB in its 
June 8, 2007 order is no longer available or appropriate, as 
stated in Del Monte, the “legislature empowered the HLRB with  
 
                     
16  Accordingly, we disagree with  the dissent.  Also, Connections’ 
purported May 6, 2003 non -renewal of Ah Sing and the DOE employee’s 
attestation that Ah Sing’s non -renewal was not related to DHRD ’s position 
regarding civil service status of the various employees does not create a 
genuine issue of material fact because Ah Sing was still a civil service 
employee as of June 9, 2003; the DOE itself included Ah Sing in the July 3, 
2003 list of Big Island public charter school employees impacted by the 
DHRD’s June 9, 2003 directive that public  charter school employees were not 
civil service employees.   ***  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
