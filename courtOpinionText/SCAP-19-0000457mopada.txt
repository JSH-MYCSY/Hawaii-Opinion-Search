APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CAAP-19-0000457; CIV. NO. 12-1 -0488)  
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson And Eddins, JJ. ) 
 
I. INTRODUCTION  
This case arises from a dispute over ownership  of 
property in Lahaina, Maui .  On May 14, 2012, Plaintiff -Appellee 
Makila Land Co., LLC (Makila) filed a Complaint for Ejectment 
and Injunctive Relief in the Circuit Court of the Second 
Circuit (circuit court).  Makila subsequently filed a motion 
for summary judgment on its ejectment claim on January 29, 
2015, which the circ uit court granted.  In addition, on 
November 29, 2018, Makila filed a “Motion for Summary Judgment Electronically Filed

2 for Defendants’ Trespassing,” which the circuit court granted 
in part.   Defendants -Appellants John Paul Kapu and Jonah 
Keʻeaumoku Kapu (the Kapus) filed a notice of appeal and an 
application for transfer, which this court granted.  The Kapus 
contend that the circuit court erroneously granted both of 
Makila’s motions for summary judgment.  
We conclude that the circuit court properly granted 
Makila’s motion for  summary judgment on the ejectment claim  
because the record at the time of summary judgment established 
that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact .  
However, the circuit court erroneously granted Makila’s motion 
for summary judgment for trespa ssing damages  because the Kapus  
disputed the damages amount and  demanded and had a right to a 
jury trial.  
II. BACKGROUND  
A. Circuit Court Proceedings1 
1. Makila’s Complaint for Ejectment and Injunctive Relief  
On May 14, 2012, Makila filed a “Complaint for 
Ejectment and Injunctive Relief”  against the Kapus and Does 1 
through 100.  Makila alleged , inter alia , that Makila owned 
property located in Land Commission Award (LCA) Number 581, 
ʻĀpana 3 of Land Patent Number 8399 within  Tax Map Key  (TMK) (2) 
                     
1  The Honorable  Joseph E. Cardoza presided.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
3 4-6-21-4 (the Prop erty).  Makila requested as relief “a Writ of 
Ejectment and/or Possession” requiring the Kapus “and their 
possessions and improvements be removed from the Prop erty” and 
“[t]hat possession of the Property be returned to [Makila].”  
Makila also sought to “rec over damages from [the Kapus] for 
trespassing in amounts to be proven at trial.”  
In their answer, the Kapus contended that they owned 
the Property as heirs of the original awardee and by adverse 
possession.  The Kapus also demanded a jury trial on “all iss ues 
so triable.”  
2. Makila’s Ejectment MSJ  
Nearly three years later,  on January 29, 2015,  Makila 
filed a motion for summary judgment on its ejectment cla im 
(Ejectment MSJ ).  Makila attached, inter alia , a declaration by 
Colleen H. Uahinui (Uahinui Declaration ) to the Ejectment MSJ .  
As discussed in greater detail below, the Uahinui Declaration 
stated that “there is a good and complete chain of title from 
the source to the present titleholder, MAKILA LAND CO., LLC, a 
Hawaii limited liability company.”  
The Kapus  filed an opposition to Makila’s Ejectment 
MSJ on February 24, 2015.2  The Kapus contended that the 
documents submit ted by Makila in support of the Ejectment MSJ 
                     
2  Attached to the Kapus’ opposition was a Declaration of Jonah Keʻeaumoku 
Kapu and Exhibits A -C. *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
4 demonstrate that Makila’s chain of title to the Property was 
broken.  Makila filed a reply to the Kapus’ opposition on 
February 26, 2015.  
  On March 4, 2015, the circuit court conducted a 
hearing on and orally granted Makila’s Ejectment MSJ.  The 
circuit court issued its corresponding order on May 6, 2015,  
concluding  that “[t]he pleadings and evidence show that no issue 
exists as to any material fact about [Makila]’s paper title to 
the Property, and that paper title to the Property is vested in 
[Makila].”3  That same day, the circuit court issued a writ of 
ejectment , which ordered the Kapus to vacate the Property and 
return possession of the Property to Makila . 
3. Makila’s Damages MSJ  
  On November 29, 2018, Makila filed a “Motion for 
Summary Judgment for Damages for Defendants’ Trespassing” 
(Damages MSJ).4  Makila contended, inter alia , that it was 
“entitled to damages equal to the fair rental value and/or the 
reasonable value of the use of the Property for the period of 
trespass”  (use damages)  and was “also entitled to damages 
                     
3  The circuit court also concluded that “[t]he pleadings and evidence 
show that no issue exists as to any material fact about the Kapu Defendants’ 
paper title and title by adve rse possession counterclaims to the Property, 
and that neither paper title nor title by adverse possession to the Property 
is vested in the Kapu Defendants.”  
 
4  Attached to Makila’s Damages MSJ were a Declaration of Michael W. 
Gibson, a Declaration of Keo ni Gomes, a Declaration of Ted Yamamura, and 
Exhibits A, B, and C.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
5 relating to the removal of unpermitted structures erected on the 
property during the trespass”  (removal damages).5  Based on the 
Declaration of Ted Yamamura, Makila alleged the use damages 
amounted to $1,405.00 per year, and contended that Jonah 
Keʻeaumoku Kapu had been on the Property since 1997.  
  The Kapus filed a “Memor andum in Opposition to 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment on Damages” (Opposition 
to Damage s MSJ)6 and attached a Declaration of Jonah Keʻeaumoku 
Kapu.7  The Kapus argued, inter alia , that Makila could not seek 
“damages for a term beginning prior to t he filing of the 
complaint on May 14, 2012,” Makila’s claim of entitlement to 
damages was precluded by laches, and the Declaration of Ted 
Yamamura did not consider  a water line and burials on the 
Property.  In addition, the Kapus contended that they were 
entitled to a jury trial to determine how the water line and 
burials impacted the Property’s value.  Makila filed a reply to 
                     
5  On May 1, 2019, Makila and the Kapus agreed to dismiss without 
prejudice Makila’s claim for removal damages.  Thus, only use damages are 
presently at issue.  
 
6  In addition, after Makila  filed the Damages MSJ, the Kapus filed three 
motions: (1)  a motion to dismiss or partially dismiss the complaint; (2)  a 
motion to stay the proceeding or, in the alternative, order the parties to 
alternate dispute resolution; and (3)  a motion for reconside ration of the 
order granting ejectment and the writ of ejectment.  The circuit court denied 
all three motions.  
 
7  The Declaration of Jonah Keʻeaumoku Kapu provided an alternate 
calculation of removal damages but did not provide an alternate calculation 
of use damages.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
6 the Kapus’ Opposition to Damages MSJ and attached a declaration 
and exhibit.  
  On January 30, 2019, the circuit court conducted a 
hearing on Makila’s Damages MSJ.  The circuit court orally 
granted Makila’s Damages MSJ with respect to use damages.  The 
circuit court issued its corresponding order on February 13, 
2019.8 
4. The Related Appeal  
  The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) issued a 
decision in  Makila Land Co., LLC v. Kapu , 144 Hawaiʻi 67, 435 
P.3d 1081 ( App. 2019), vacated, 152 Hawaiʻi 112, 522 P.3d 259 
(2022) (the related appeal) on February 28, 2019, whic h involved 
the same parties and a nearby parcel of land.  In the related 
appeal, the ICA reviewed the circuit court’s decision after a 
remand to the circuit court by the ICA to address a gap in 
Makila’s chain of title, which arose because the deed from 
Makila’s immediate predecessor -in-interest, Pioneer Mill 
Company, identified th e subject parcel by TMK number but not the 
original LCA number.  On remand, Makila submitted a surveyor’s 
declaration confirming that the TMK number identified in the 
                     
8  The circuit court granted Makila’s Damages MSJ “with respect to 
[Makila]’s claim for damages for the fair market value for rent during the 
period of 1997 to 2017.”  Thus, the circuit court determined that Makila was 
“entitled to summary ju dgment in its favor against [the Kapus] in the total 
amount of $25,290.00, which is based on the reasonable and undisputed annual 
fair market rental valuation of $1,405.00.”  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
7 Pioneer Mill Comp any deed included the LCA from which Makila 
traced its original title.  The circuit court entered judgment 
in Makila’s favor, which the ICA affirmed.  
5. Makila’s Motion to Supplement  
  On March 15, 2019, a fter the ICA’s decision in the 
related appeal, Makila filed a “Motion to Supplement Record” 
(Motion to Supplement)  in the inst ant case  with a surveyor’s 
declaration to establish that the deed from Pioneer Mill Company 
to Makila included LCA 581 and ʻĀpana 3.  Makila attached, inter 
alia, a declaration from Reed M. Ariyoshi (Ariyoshi Declaration) 
to its Motion to Supplement.  As discussed in greater detail 
below, the Ariyoshi Declaration noted that Ariyoshi  “plotted the 
boundaries of Apana 3 of Land Commission Award 581  . . . using 
standard engineering and surveying practices” and “conclude[d] 
that the Pioneer Mill Deed’s descripti on of TMK (2)4 -6-21:4 
includes Apana 3 of Land Commission Award No. 581.”   
  On May 22, 2019, t he circuit court  orally granted 
Makila’s Motion to Supplement at a hearing on the motion:  
In light of the history of this case as well as the -
- what I’ll call the related case [related appeal], I am of 
the view that for purposes of judicial economy, it makes 
sense to grant this motion.  . . . 
 So I think it -- it -- for purposes of judicial 
economy, it just creates a better circumstance for all 
concerned in the s ense that if it’s appropriately -- if 
it’s appropriate to consider that, then it can be 
considered by the appellate court.  If it’s inappropriate, 
the appellate court can simply choose not to consider it.  
 And so I’m going to grant the motion.  . . . *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
8 On June 10, 2019, the circuit court issued a written order 
granting Makila’s Motion to Supplement the record with a 
surveyor’s declaration.  
That same day, the circuit court issued its Final 
Judgment, which provided:  
1. Pursuant to the Writ and Ejectment Order, i t is 
ordered that Defendants and their possessions and 
improvements be removed from the Property, and possession 
of Apana 3 of Land Commission Award 581 situate within TMK 
(2) 4-6-21:04 (“Property”) be returned to Plaintiff.  
  
2. Pursuant to the Writ of Ej ectment and Order, it 
is ordered that the Defendants and their assigns, heirs, 
agents, servants, employees, guests, invitees, and others 
acting under their direction and authority, are enjoined 
and restrained from entering the Property, from using the 
same for any purpose, from interfering with Plaintiff’s 
access to the Property, and from interfering in any other 
way with Plaintiff’s possession, use and enjoyment of the 
Property.  
  
3. Pursuant to the Damages Order, judgment is 
entered in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendants, 
jointly and severally, in the total amount of $25,290.00 . 
  
4. This Final Judgment disposes of all the claims 
and prayers for relief raised by any and all parties in 
this action, there are no remaining claims or parties other 
than those set forth herein, and all other claims are 
hereby dismissed.  
B. The Kapus’ Appeal and Application for Transfer  
  The Kapus filed a notice of appeal on June 23, 2019.  
The Kapus filed an opening brief on September 29, 2019, arguing 
that the circuit court  erred by granting (1)  “summary judgment 
to [Makila] on May 6, 2015 where genuine issues of material fact 
existed as to [Makila]’s entitlement to the writ of ejectment, 
[the Kapus]’ adverse possession of the parcel, and other 
errors;” (2)  “summary judgment  to [Makila] and thereby bypassing *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
9 quiet title requirements and imposing improper burdens on [the 
Kapus], where the action was styled as seeking a writ of 
ejectment and injunctive relief;” (3)  “injunctive relief to 
[Makila] because the circuit court lacked  jurisdiction to issue 
such injunctive relief where a writ of ejectment was present;”9 
(4) “an award of damages to [Makila] where facts material to 
genuine issues were disputed and [the Kapus] had filed a demand 
for jury;” (5)  “an award of damages to [Maki la] where [Makila] 
failed to diligently prosecute its claims and prejudiced [the 
Kapus]’ rights of appeal;” and (6)  [Makila]’s motion to 
supplement the record.”  
  On January 6, 2020, the Kapus filed an application for 
transfer, which this court granted on February 7, 2020.  
III.  DISCUSSION  
A. The circuit court properly granted Makila’s Ejectment MSJ  
based on the record at the time of summary judgment.  
As an initial matter, the circuit court properly 
granted Makila’s Ejectment MSJ.  T he circuit court properly 
considered the Ariyoshi Declaration attached to Makila’s Motion 
                     
9  Although the Kapus raise a point of error with respect to the circuit 
court gra nting injunctive relief, the record appears to show that the circuit 
court did not issue an injunction .  The writ of ejectment could be 
interpreted as an injunction because it ordered the Kapus to vacate the 
Property and return possession of the Property to Makila.  However, the 
parties appear to reference a separate injunction other than the writ of 
ejectment, but no suc h injunction appears in the record.  Thus, this 
memorandum opinion does not discuss the injunction issue raised by the Kapus 
any further.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
10 to Supplement.10  Even if the circuit court improperly granted 
Makila’s Motion to Supplement and considered the Ariyoshi 
Declaration, the evidence before the circuit c ourt at the time 
of summary judgment establish that the circuit court correctly 
granted the Ejectment MSJ . 
Makila attached a declaration to the Ejectment MSJ  and 
the Motion to Supplement.  Notably, both declarations standing 
alone demonstrate  that TMK No. (2) 4-6-21-4 includes LCA 581 and 
ʻĀpana 3.  Makila attached, inter alia , the Uahinui Declaration 
to its Ejectment M SJ.  The Uahinui Declaration provided  in 
relevant part : 
 3. Under Title Guaranty’s Order No. 201051639, a 
search of title was conducted on a ll of that certain parcel 
of land, being all of the land described in and covered by 
Apana 3 of Land Patent Number 8399, Land Commission Award 
                     
10  The circuit court properly considered the Ariyoshi Declaration, which 
was attached to Makila’s Motion to Supplement .  The Motion to Supplement was 
filed pursuant to Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 7 and Rules of 
the Circuit Court s of the State of Hawaiʻi (RCCH) Rule 7, 7.1, and 7.2.  HRCP 
Rule 7 and RCCH Rules 7, 7.1, and 7.2 are the rules governing filing  motions 
before the circuit court.  It appears that Makila complied with those rules 
when it filed the Motion to Supplement.  Thus, it was within the circuit 
court’s discretion to grant the Motion to Supplement.  
 Furthermore, Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS)  § 603.9(1) and (6), which 
codifies the inherent powers doctrine, appear to allow for Makila’s Motion to 
Supplement.  See Bank of Hawaii v. Kunimoto , 91 Hawaiʻi 372, 393, 984 P.2d 
1198, 1219 (1999).  As Makila pointed out in its answering brief,  
 
Here, the  requested relief sought to bring finality to this 
case and promote judicial economy, which serves the ends of 
justice - it would have been a great injustice, and waste 
of resources, for this case to go up on appeal, only to 
come back down simply to addres s the very limited issue 
addressed by the Ariyoshi Declaration (as was the case in 
the Related Appeal).  
Thus, it was within the circuit court’s discretion to exercise its inherent 
power to grant Makila’s Motion to Supplement in the interest of justice and 
to promote judicial economy.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
11  Number 581 to S. Laahili, situate, lying and being at 
Puehuehuiki, District of Lahaina, Island and County of 
Maui, State of Hawaii, bearing Tax Key designation (2)4 -6-
021-004 and hatched on map attached hereto and marked as 
EXHIBIT “1” (the “subject land”).  
  
4. I examined or supervised the examination of the 
indices at the Bureau of Conveyances of the State of 
Hawaii, the land records at the Department of Land and 
Natural Resources, records at the State Archives, records 
at the Real Property Tax Assessor’s Office for the 
Department of Finance of the County of Maui, the records at 
the Supreme Court and Circuit Court o f the Second Circuit, 
State of Hawaii.  
 
 5. Based on my research or under my supervision, a 
Statute Title Report was issued under Title Guaranty’s 
Order No. 201051639 covering the subject land.  
 
 6. The chain of title for the subject land is as 
follows:  
 
 A. Land Commission Award Number 581 was issued to 
S. LAAHILI on March 8, 1855, comprising of 4 apana.  The 
subject land of this declaration is Apana 3, containing an 
area of 6 eka and 2 ruda at Puehuehuiki, Ahupuaa of 
Lahaina, Island of Maui.  A certified copy of same is 
attached hereto and marked as EXHIBIT “2”.  A copy of the 
translation from Hawaiian to English by Doris Moana Rowland 
is attached hereto as EXHIBIT “2T”.  
 
 B. Land Patent Number 8399 was issued thereon on 
May 11, 1928.  A certified copy of same is attached hereto 
and marked as EXHIBIT “3”.  A copy of the translation from 
Hawaiian to English by Doris Moana Rowland is attached 
hereto and marked as EXHIBIT “3T”.  
 
 C. No conveyances appear of record by S. LAAHILI 
dealing with the subject land an d died on December 24, 1854 
at Lahaina.  His estate was probated in the Supreme Court 
as Probate Number 569.  Proceedings therein show he was 
survived by his widow, KELIIOKAHEKILI (w) and two sons, 
PAUKEA (k) and ISAAKA (k); and he left land at Puehuehuiki , 
besides other lands.  The decedent’s Last Will and 
Testament dated September 27, 1854 does not devise the land 
at Puehuehuiki, and was admitted to probate on September 
26, 1855.  By the laws of intestacy in operation at the 
time of the decedent’s death, the land at Puehuehuiki 
passed to the decedent’s children.  Settlement of the 
Administrator’s Accounts by Kaumaea filed on February 23, 
1859 shows the sole surviving child was PAUKEA (k).  A 
certified copy of the probate proceedings is attached 
hereto and marked as EXHIBIT “4”.  A certified copy of the 
translation from Hawaiian to English by Doris Moana Rowland 
is attached hereto and marked as EXHIBIT “4T”.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
12  D. By deed dated May 2, 1871, recorded in Liber 36 
at Page 428, S. Kapaukea  (k) conveyed to AND. J. LAWRENCE 
“all of my farmland situate at P uehuehuiki, Lahaina as 
described in Land Commission Award Number 581 excepting 
what I previously conveyed being seven acres”.  A copy of 
same is attached hereto and marked as EXHIBIT “5”.  A  copy 
of the translation of this document from Hawaiian to 
English by Doris Moana Rowland is attached hereto and 
marked as EXHIBIT “5T”.  
 
Prior to the execution of the foregoing deed, S. KAPAUKEA 
executed the following deeds:  
 
 (1) Deed dated September 23,  1859, recorded in 
Liber 26 at Page 34, conveying to HONOLII a 44 -1/2 rod 
(approximately 12,115 square feet or 0.278 acre)

designation (2)4 -6-013-portion 001 and is not the 
subject land of this action;  
 
 (2) Deed dated November 19, 1868, recorded in Liber 
26 at Page 426, conveying to JAMES CAMPBELL and HENRY 
TURTON two pieces of land, one at Puehuehuiki (area 
undetermined, however, the described parcel appears to 
be bounded on all sides by roads and appears to be

which contains an area of 4 acres, 2 ruda and 32 roda, 
approximately 4.7 acres) and the other at Puehuehunui 
(containing an area of 3 roods and 25 links, being 
approximately 32,681 square feet or 0.75  acre).  The 
former currently bears Tax Key designation (2)4 -6-004-
015, 028, 029 and 030 and the latter currently bears 
Tax Key designation (2)4 -6-004-011, portion 005, 
portion 012, portion 026, portion 023 and portion 022.  
Both these parcels are not the subject land of this 
action; and  
 
 (3) Warranty Deed dated February 24, 1869, recorded 
in Liber 28 at Page 42, conveying to JAMES CAMPBELL 
and HENRY TUR TON a 1-1/2 acre parcel at Puehuehuiki, 
which currently bears Tax Key designation (2)4 -6-013-
portion 001 .  This parcel is not the subject land of 
this action.  
 
The total area conveyed by the preceding three deeds equals 
approximately 7.228 acres, more or less.  
 
 E. By Warranty Deed dated May 2, 1871, recorded in 
Liber 36 at Page 428, ANDREW J. LAWRENCE conve yed to

13  
 G. By Deed dated October 15, 1855, recorded in 
Liber 93 at Page 4 30, HENRY TURTON (and wife, A. H. Turton) 
conveyed the subject land, besides other lands, to J. F. 
HACKFELD.  A certified copy of same is atta ched hereto and 
marked as EXHIBIT “8”.  
 
 H. By Deed dated October 15, 1885, recorded in 
Liber 93 at Page 444, J. F. HACKFELD conveyed the subject 
land, besides other lands, to JAMES CAMPBELL and PAUL 
ISENBERG.  A certified copy of same is attached hereto a nd 
marked as EXHIBIT “9”.  
 
 I. By Deed dated June 29, 1889, recorded in Liber 
118 at Page 104, JAMES CAMPBELL (and wife, Abigail 
Campbell) conveyed his undivided ½ interest in the subject 
land, besides other lands, to C. F. HORNER.  A certified 
copy of sam e is attached hereto and marked as EXHIBIT “10”.  
 
 J. By Deed dated June 29, 1895, recorded in Liber 
154 at Page 222, C. F. HORNER (and wife, Sarah L. Horner) 
and PAUL ISENBERG (by his attorney -in-fact, J.F. Hackfeld) 
conveyed the subject land, besides oth er lands, to PIONEER 
MILL COMPANY, LIMITED, a Hawaiian corporation.  A certified 
copy of same is attached hereto and marked as EXHIBIT “11”.  
 
 K. By Deed and Reservation of Rights dated January 
16, 2001, recorded as Document No. 2001 -006059, PIONEER 
MILL COMPANY, LIMITED, a Hawaii corporation, conveyed the 
subject land, besides other lands, to MAKILA LAND CO., LLC, 
a Hawaii limited liability company.  A certified copy of 
same is attached hereto and marked as EXHIBIT “12”.  
 
 7. Based on the foregoing and my research of same, 
I believe there is a good and complete chain of title from 
the source to the present titleholder, MAKILA LAND CO., 
LLC, a Hawaii limited liability company.  
 
 8. Based on my research, I find no record of any 
judicial action that either JOH N PAUL KAPU and/or JONAH 
KEEAUMOKU KAPU have been determined as heirs of LAAHILI, 
the awardee of Land Commission Award Number 581.  
  Makila attached, inter alia , the Ariyoshi Declaration 
to its Motion to Supplement.  The Ariyoshi  Declaration provided 
in relevant part:  
 3.  I have reviewed the following:  
 
 a.  Land Commission Award 581 and an English 
translation of the same, which are attached to 
Plaintiff’s Summary Judgment Motion  filed on *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
14 January 29, 2015 (“Motion”)  as Exhibit 2  and 
Exhibit 2T , respectively.  
 
 b.  The annotated tax map that is attached to the 
Motion as Exhibit 1  (“Annotated Map”) ; and 
 
 c.  The Deed and Reservation of Rights  dated 
January 16, 2001, recorded as Document No. 2001 -
006059 from Pioneer Mill Company, Li mited as 
grantor, to Makila Land Co., LLC as grantee 
(“Pioneer Mill Deed”) , which is attached to the 
Motion as Exhibit 12 . 
 
 4.  Additionally, I plotted the boundaries of Apana 3 
of Land Commission Award 581 (as described therein) using 
standard engineerin g and surveying practices.  
 
 5.  Based on the foregoing, I conclude that the 
Pioneer Mill Deed’s description of TMK (2)4 -6-21:4 includes 
Apana 3 of Land Commission Award No. 581.  
  The Uahinui Declaration, which was attached to 
Makila’s Ejectment MSJ , establishes that TMK No. (2)  4-6-21-4 
includes LCA 581 and ʻĀpana 3 for three reasons.  First, the 
plain language of the Uahinui Declaration states that TMK No. 
(2) 4-6-21-4 includes LCA 581 and ʻĀpana 3.  The Uahinui 
Declaration provides that  
a search of titl e was conducted on all that certain parcel 
of land, being all of the land described in and covered by 
Apana 3 of Land Patent Number 8399, Land Commission Award 
Number 581 to S. Laahili , situate, lying and being at 
Puehuehuiki, District of Lahaina, Island a nd County of 
Maui, State of Hawaii, bearing Tax Key designation (2)4 -6-
021-004 and hatched on map attached hereto and marked as 
Exhibit “1” (the “subject land”).  
(Emphasis added.)  In other words, the subject of the Uahinui 
Declaration was “land described in and covered by Apana 3 of 
Land Patent Number 8399, Land Commission Award Number 
581 . . . , bearing Tax Key designation (2)4 -6-021-004 . . . .”  
With respect to ownership of the Property , the Uahinui *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
15 Declaration states that “there is a good and complete  chain of 
title from the source to the present titleholder, MAKILA LAND 
CO., LLC, a Hawaii limited liability company.”  Thus, the 
Uahinui Declaration asserts that Makila was the titleholder of 
the parcel of land bearing TMK No. (2)  4-6-21-4, which included  
LCA 581 and ʻĀpana 3. 
  Second, the exhibits attached to the Uahinui 
Declaration demonstrate that TMK No. (2)  4-6-21-4 includes LCA 
581.11  For example, attached to the Uahinui Declaration was 
Exhibit 1, a map which shows that TMK No. (2)  4-6-21-4 includes  
LCA 581.12  In addition, the other exhibits attached to the 
Uahinui Declaration establish a chain of title from the original 
grantor of the Property  to Makila .  These other exhibits mention 
LCA 581 when describing the Property . 
  Third, the Ariyoshi Declar ation, which was attached to 
Makila’s Motion to Supplement and concludes that TMK No. (2)  4-
6-21-4 includes LCA 581 and ʻĀpana 3, largely reviewed exhibits 
attached to Makila’s Ejectment MSJ  to support the conclusion 
that TMK No. (2)  4-6-21-4 includes LCA 581 and ʻĀpana 3.  
Specifically, the Ariyoshi Declaration references Exhibit 1, 
                     
11  The exhibits attached to the Ejectment MSJ  do not appear to mention 
ʻĀpana 3.  However, the Uahinui Declaration specifically stated that TMK No. 
(2) 4-6-21-4 includes LCA 581 and ʻĀpana 3. 
 
12  Although Exhibit 1 is difficult  to read, the shaded portion of the map 
appears to include LCA 581.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
16 Exhibit 2, Exhibit 2T, and Exhibit 12, which were all attached 
to the Uahinui Declaration.  In addition, the Ariyoshi 
Declaration stated:  
 4.  Additionally, I plotted the bound aries of Apana 3 
of Land Commission Award 581 (as described therein) using 
standard engineering and surveying practices.  
  
5.  Based on the foregoing, I conclude that the 
Pioneer Mill Deed’s description of TMK (2)4 -6-21:4 includes 
Apana 3 of Land Commissio n Award No. 581.  
The Ariyoshi Declaration’s conclusion that “TMK (2)4 -6-21:4 
includes Apana 3 of Land Commission Award No. 581” was thus 
based in part on Ariyoshi’s review of the exhibits already 
before the circuit court when Makila filed the Ejectment MSJ . 
  Thus, Makila established that TMK No. (2) 4 -6-21-4 
includes LCA 581 and ʻĀpana 3 at the time its Ejectment MSJ was 
granted.  Although the Uahinui Declaration did not expressly 
state that “TMK (2)4 -6-21:4 includes Apana 3 of Land Commission 
Award No. 58 1” like the Ariyoshi Declaration, the Uahinui 
Declaration provides the same information.  
B. Makila presented  a prima facie case for its ejectment  
claim. 
Makila satisfied its  summary judgment  burden on its 
ejectment claim.   This court has stated that  
 In order to maintain an ejectment action, the 
plaintiff “must necessarily prove that [he or she] owns the 
parcel[] in issue,” State v. Magoon , 75 Haw. 164, 175, 858 
P.2d 712, 718 -19 (1993); see State v. Midkiff , 49 Haw. 456, 
460, 421 P.2d 550, 554 (1966), meaning that he or she must 
have “the title to and right of possession of” such parcel, 
Carter v. Kaikainahaole , 14 Haw. 515, 516 (Haw. Terr. 
1902).  Additionally, the plaintiff must establish that 
“possession is unlawfully withheld by another.”  Id. *** NO

17 Kondaur Capital Corp. v. Matsuyoshi , 136 Hawaiʻi 227, 241, 361 
P.3d 454, 468 (2014)  (brackets in original) .  As discussed 
below, Makila established that (1)  Makila had “the title to and 
right of possession of” the Property; and (2)  possession of the 
Property wa s “unlawfully withheld by another.”  See id. 
1. Makila had “the title to and right of possession of” 
the Property.  
In an ejectment action, the plaintiff is required to 
prove that it owns the parcel at issue.  Id. (citing Magoon, 75 
Haw. at 175, 858 P.2d at 718-19).  In other words, the plaintiff 
“must have ‘title to and right of possession of’ such parcel.”  
Id. (quoting Carter, 14 Haw. at 516).  A  “plaintiff’s prima 
facie case can be made in various ways, but is usually done by 
bringing forward evidence of th e initial land grant award and 
tracing ownership forward to the plaintiff through ‘mesne 
conveyances, devise, or descent’ or through evidence of adverse 
possession, as provided in the quiet title statute.”  Alexander 
& Baldwin, Inc. v. Silva , 124 Hawaiʻi 476, 482, 248 P.3d 1207, 
1213 (App. 2011).13 
                     
13  Although Alexander & Baldwin  involved a quiet title action , the 
plaintiff in a quiet title action “has the initial burden to prove a title in 
or to the land in dispute.”  124 Hawaiʻi at 482, 248 P.3d at 1213.  This is 
similar to an ejectment action, where a plaintiff “must necessarily prove 
that [he or she] owns the parcel[] in issue,” which means the plaintiff “must 
have ‘the title to and right of possession of’ such parcel.”  Kondaur C apital 
Corp. v. Matsuyoshi , 136 Hawaiʻi 227, 241, 361 P.3d 454, 468 (2015).  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
18 Here, Makila has made its prima facie  case by 
producing evidence of the initial land grant award and tracing 
ownership forward to Makila at the time Makila filed the 
Ejectment MSJ.   The Uahinui Declaration and the exhibits 
attached to the Uahinui Declaration trace ownership of the 
Property  from the initial land grant award to Makila.  Thus, 
Makila made a prima facie  showing that it has “title to and 
right of possession of” the land at issue.  See Kondaur Capital 
Corp., 136 Hawaiʻi at 241, 361 P.3d at 468 (quoting Carter, 14 
Haw. at 516).  
2. Makila established that “possession is unlawfully 
withheld by another.”  
The plaintiff in an ejectment action must also 
demonstrate that “possession is unlawfully withheld by another.”  
Id.  Here,14 Makila demonstrated that possession was unlawfully 
withheld by the Kapus based on the documentary evidence Makila 
presented at the time of summary judgment, including the Uahinui 
                     
14  In its answering brief before the ICA, Makila contended that  
 
 Makila’s burden of production on the second element 
of ejectment (unlawful possession of defendant) was 
supported by [the Kapus] own admissions of record that they 
were in possession of the Property  . . . . Makila further 
supported the se cond [sic] element by pointing to the 
absence of any evidence making such possession lawful 
(e.g., title by paper title or adverse 
possession).  . . . Makila also presented evidence of sworn 
statements from [the Kapus] in which [the Kapus] claimed 
title to nearby lands, but not the Property  . . . . *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
19 Declaration and exhibits att ached thereto ,15 which demonstrated 
that Makila had title to and right of possession  of the 
Property.  In contrast, the Kapus presented no documentary 
evidence that the Kapus held title to the Property.  Instead, 
the Kapus contended that Makila’s chain of t itle was broken and 
asserted  in their pleadings  that the Kapus owned the Property 
through inheritance as heirs of the original owner or by adverse 
possession.  In addition, t he Kapus did not deny occupying the 
Property.  Thus, Makila demonstrated that it had title to and 
right of possession  of the Property, and that possession of the 
Property was unlawfully withheld by the Kapus.  
C. The circuit court erroneously granted Makila’s Damages MSJ 
with respect to use damages because the Kapus  disputed the 
damages amo unt and demanded and had a right to a jury 
trial. 
Although the circuit court properly granted Makila’s 
Ejectment MSJ, the Kapus correctly assert that “[t]he circuit 
court reversibly erred by granting an award of damages to 
[Makila]  where facts material to genuine issues were disputed 
and [the Kapus]  had filed a demand for jury.”  
The Hawaiʻi Constitution states that “[i]n suits at 
common law where the value in controversy shall exceed five 
thousand dollars, the right of trial by jury  shall be preserved .  
                     
15  As discussed above, Makila presented documentary evidence tracing title 
of the Proper ty from the original land grant to Makila.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
20 The legislature may provide for a verdict by not less than 
three-fourths of the members of the jury.”  Haw. Const. art. I, 
§ 13; see also  Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure  Rule 38(a) (“The 
right of trial by jury as given by the Constit ution or a statute 
of the State or the United States shall be preserved to the 
parties inviolate.”).  
This court has stated : 
 As the Hawaiʻi Constitution notes, the right to a jury 
trial is preserved for suits at common law.  “The test to 
determine whether a suit is at common law is  . . . whether 
the cause of action seeks legal or equitable relief.”  Lee 
v. Aiu, 85 Hawaiʻi 19, 29, 936 P.2d 655 (1997) (internal 
quotation marks omitted).  Thus, “courts look to the nature 
of the remedy to determine whether a ju ry trial is 
warranted.”  Id. 
In re Marn Family , 141 Hawaiʻi 1, 8, 403 P.3d 621, 628 (2016) .  
This court has also stated that  monetary damages are a form of 
legal relief:  
Traditional forms of “legal” relief include compensatory 
and punitive damages.  See [Mehau v. Reed , 76 Hawaiʻi 101, 
110, 869 P.2d 1320, 1329 (1994)]  (noting that plaintiff who 
sought monetary damages based upon invasion of privacy 
sought legal, rather than equitable, relief); Ross v. 
Stouffer Hotel Co. ( Hawaiʻi) Ltd., Inc ., 76 Hawaiʻi 454, 
463, 879 P.2d 1037, 1046 (1994) (noting that compensatory 
and punitive damages are traditional legal remedies).  
SCI Mgmt. Corp. v. Sims , 101 Hawaiʻi 438, 446, 71 P.3d 389, 397 
(2003). 
  Here, the Kapus had a right to a jury trial on 
Makila’s claim for mon etary damages because the Kapus demanded a 
jury trial and disputed the  damages amount.   In the Damages MSJ, 
Makila sought monetary damages for the Kapus’ wrongful *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
21 possession of and trespass on the Property.  In addition, 
Makila’s Complaint for Ejectment an d Injunctive Relief sought to 
“recover damages from [the Kapus] for trespassing in amounts to 
be proven at trial.”  Thus, Makila’s Damages MSJ sought legal 
relief in the form of monetary damages for trespassing.  See id. 
  Furthermore, the Kapus demanded a  jury trial in their 
answer to Makila’s Complaint for Ejectment and Injunctive Relief 
on “all issues so triable.”  The record does not appear to 
indicate that the Kapus ever rescinded or waived their demand 
for a jury trial.   Furthermore, in the Opposition  to Damages 
MSJ, the Kapus contended that burials on the Property decreased 
the Property’s value.  The Kapus also argued that heavy 
machinery cannot be used on much of the Property due to a water 
line on the Property.  The Kapus maintained that Makila did not 
consider the burials and water line on the Property when 
calculating use damages and that they were entitled to a jury 
trial on use damages.  Thus, because Makila sought legal relief 
in the form of monetary damages, the Kapus disputed the  damages 
amount, and the Kapus demanded and had a right to a jury trial 
on Makila’s claim for monetary damages, the circuit court 
erroneously granted Makila’s Damages MSJ with respect to use 
damages.16  Instead of granting in part Makila’s Damages MSJ, the 
                     
16  Makila cited to Krog v. Koahou , 133 Hawaiʻi 186, 324 P.3d 996 (2014), an 
unpublished memorandum opinion, in support of the Damages MSJ.  Although the *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
22 circuit court should have conducted a jury trial on Makila’s 
claim for monetary damages.  
IV. CONCLUSION  
  The circuit court properly granted Makila’s Ejectment 
MSJ because Makila established that TMK No. (2)  4-6-21-4 
includes LCA 581 and ʻĀpana 3 at the time of summary judgment.  
However, the circuit court mistakenly granted Makila’s Damages 
MSJ with respect to use damages because the Kapus disputed the 
damages amount and demanded and had a right to a jury trial.  We 
therefore affirm  in part and vacate in part the circuit court’s 
Final Judgment.   The case is remanded to the circuit court for 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.  
  DATED:  Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, February 14, 2023.  
                     
Krog court affirmed the circuit court’s award of damages to Respondent for 
Petitioners trespass and wrongful possession of property, there was no demand 
for a jury trial.  See Krog, 133 Hawaiʻi 186, 324 P.3d 996.  Thus, Krog is 
distinguishable from the instant  case. Lance D. Collins and
