 In a petition for a declaratory order (Petition) filed

 2 admitted to the United States,” including foreign nonimmigrant 
crewmembers on longline fishing vessels.  Specifically, Chun 
argued that Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 189-5 (2011) 
prohibits 
the DLNR from issuing commercial marine licenses 
(CMLs) to persons not lawfully admitted to the United States.   
The limitation in HRS § 189-5 applies only to persons 
“engage[d] in taking marine life for commercial purposes in the 
waters of the State.”  HRS § 189-5 (emphasis added).  The BLNR 
denied Chun’s Petition, concluding, among other things, that 
longline fishing vessels do not fish within state waters.  The 
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (circuit court) affirmed.  
We granted Chun’s application for transfer and conclude that the 
DLNR is not prohibited from issuing CMLs to foreign nonimmigrant 
crewmembers on longline fishing vessels who fish for highly 
migratory species outside of state waters.  Because the longline 
fishing vessels at issue here do not fish within state waters, we affirm the circuit court’s order denying Chun’s Petition.   
II.  BACKGROUND 
Hawai‘i’s longline fishing industry consists of 
approximately 140 boats that dock in Honolulu Harbor.  These boats fish exclusively for “highly migratory species,” defined 
by the Magnuson-Stevens Conservation and Management Act 
(Magnuson-Stevens Act) as “tuna species, marlin (Tetrapturus    ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 3 spp. and Makaira spp.), oceanic sharks, sailfishes (Istiophorus 
spp.), and swordfish (Xiphias gladius).”  16 U.S.C. § 1802.   
Federal regulations prohibit longline boats from 
fishing in specific areas around 
Hawai‘i.  For example, longline 
boats cannot fish closer than approximately fifty miles to the north and east of the main Hawaiian Islands, and one hundred 
miles to the south and west of the main Hawaiian Islands.  Longline fishing is also prohibited in the Exclusive Economic 
Zone
2 (EEZ) around the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, which 
extends two hundred nautical miles seaward.               
A. BLNR Proceedings   
   
Chun filed his Petition on April 12, 2017, requesting 
the BLNR to issue a “declaratory ruling regarding the authority 
of the [DLNR] to issue [CMLs3] to persons not lawfully admitted 
to the United States.”  Chun contended he was an interested 
person under HRS § 91-8 (2012)4 and thus permitted to “petition 
[the BLNR] for a declaratory order as to the applicability of 
any statutory provision.”  HRS § 91-8.   
                     
2  An Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is a region of the ocean where a 
coastal country claims exclusive rights to natural resources.   
 
3  HRS § 187A- 1 (2011) defines CMLs as “a license issued to take 
marine life within or outside the State for commercial purpose.” 
 
4  HRS § 91- 8 (2012) states in relevant part: “Any interested person 
may petition an agency for a declaratory order as to the applicability of any 
statutory provision or of any rule or order of the agency.”  
    ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 4  Chun also argued that HRS §§ 189-2 (2011)5 and 189-5 
“prohibit the [DLNR] from issuing [CMLs] to any person who has 
not been lawfully admitted to the United States” including 
foreign nonimmigrant crewmembers on longline fishing vessels.  
Additionally, Chun contended that issuing CMLs to foreign crewmembers who are subject to “unfair and illegal labor 
practices” contradicts “the Kānāwai Māmalahoe, or law of the 
Splintered Paddle, which [was] adopted at [a]rticle IX, 
[s]ection 10 of the Hawai‘ i State Constitution.”
6   
The BLNR denied Chun’s Petition on July 14, 2017, 
concluding: (1) Chun is not an “interested person” entitled to a 
declaratory order under HRS § 91-8; (2) the issue of whether 
commercial fishing companies’ employment of non-citizen fishers 
violates article IX, section 10 of the  Constitution is 
outside the jurisdiction of the BLNR; and (3) labor practices 
are also outside the jurisdiction of the BLNR.  However, the Hawai‘i
                     
5  HRS § 189-2(a) (2011) states, in relevant part: “No person shall 
take marine life for commercial purposes whether the marine life is caught or 
taken within or outside of the State, without first obtaining a commercial 
marine license as provided in this section.”   
 
6  Article IX, s ection 10 of the Hawai‘ i Constitution states: 
 The law of the splintered paddle, [kānāwai māmalahoe], decreed by Kamehameha I--
Let every elderly person, woman 
and child lie by the roadside in safety--shall be a unique and living symbol of the State's concern for public safety. 
 
The State shall have the power to provide for the safety of the people from crimes against persons and property.     ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
5 On remand, Hawai ‘i Longline Association (HLA ) 
intervened and filed a brief in opposition to Chun’s Petition 
contending, among other things, that “[t]he areas in which the 
Hawai‘i longline fishery operates are regulated by [f]ederal 
law,” and “[f]ederal law explicitly allows the use of foreign 
crews on U.S. vessels fishing for highly migratory 
species . . . . ”  Moreover, HLA argued that the plain language 
of HRS §  189-5 limits fishing for commercial purposes in the 
waters of the state and has no application to commercial fishing 
that takes place exclusively outside of state waters.  HLA 
contended that federal law “expressly permits” foreign 
nonimmigrant crewmembers to fish for highly migratory species, 
and the Magnuson-Stevens Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1801–1891d, reserves 
“exclusive fishery management authority over all fish” in the 
EEZ to the federal government.    HLA argued that “because the 8
Hawai ‘i-based 
7The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided.  
8Specifically, 16 U.S.C. § 1811(a) states that “[e]xcept as 
provided in section 1812 of this title, the United States claims, and will 
exercise in the manner provided for in this chapter, sovereign rights and 
exclusive fishery management authority over all fish, and all Continental 
(continued . . .) circuit court  reversed, concluding that “Chun made a prima facie 
showing that he is an interested person under HRS § 91-8” and is thus 
“entitled to a hearing” if the BLNR contested his prima facie s
howing 
that he is an interested person.  7   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 6 longline fishing fleet fishes only in the EEZ and beyond, and 
not in state waters, [f]ederal law applies, and precludes state 
regulation that is inconsistent with [f]ederal fishing laws and 
regulations.”  
 
The BLNR issued its findings of fact, conclusions of 
law, and order denying Chun’s Petition on February 27, 2019.  The BLNR first noted that Chun’s Petition “ultimately turns on 
the meaning of two phrases: ‘in the waters of the State[,]’ and 
‘lawfully admitted.’”
9  In its findings of fact, the BLNR found, 
as relevant here:  
5.  There is no evidence in the record that the 
presence of the crewmembers in Honolulu Harbor . . . is 
illegal in the eyes of the federal government . . . .  
 
                     
(. . . continued) 
Shelf fishery resources, within the exclusive economic zone.”  (Emphasis 
added.)  
 
9  The BLNR held that foreign crewmembers of longline fishing 
vessels were “lawfully admitted” for the purposes of HRS § 189-5.  The BLNR 
acknowledged that “lawfully admitted” does not always mean “lawfully admitted 
to permanent residency[,]” citing Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm’n, 334 U.S. 
410 (1948) and Dandamudi v. Tisch, 686 F.3d 66 (2d Cir. 2012) as examples of 
cases where foreign individuals were lawfully present in the United States 
without being “lawfully admitted to permanent residency.”   
The BLNR also found that the legislature merely intended to 
differentiate “[a]liens not admitted to the United States, as distinguished from aliens who are legally in the United States[.]”  (Emphasis omitted.)  
Further, the BLNR noted that various federal statutes and regulations establish the procedure for foreign crewmembers to obtain landing privileges; however, nothing in these statutes or regulations suggests that foreign 
crewmembers are illegall y present if their landing privileges are not granted 
and they remain detained on the vessel.  
Despite the BLNR’s conclusions of law on this issue, we decline 
to determine whether foreign crewmembers are “legally admitted” for purposes 
of HRS § 189- 5 as we hold that longline fishing vessels do not in fact fish 
within the state marine waters.  See discussion infra Section IV(B).      ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 7  6.  The longline vessels based in Honolulu Harbor 
fish exclusively for 
“highly migratory species” as that 
term is defined in the Magnuson- Stevens Act . . . . 
 
7.  Because of [f]ederal regulations, the longline 
boats do not fish closer than fifty miles to the north and 
east of the main Hawaiian Islands, and one hundred miles to 
the south and west of the main Hawaiian Islands.  
 
. . . .  
 
9.
  Most fish caught by the longliners are taken 
beyond the Hawai‘ i EEZ, from the “ high seas”  or 
international waters.   
 
(Citations omitted.)   
 
The BLNR explained that “[e]ven if [foreign 
nonimmigrant] crewmembers . . . were not ‘lawfully admitted[,]’ 
HRS § 189-5 does not prohibit them from receiving a CML.”  It 
additionally noted that the statute only prohibits foreign 
nonimmigrant crewmembers from taking marine life within state waters and “does not prohibit [foreign nonimmigrant crewmembers] 
from taking marine life outside the waters of the State and 
bringing it into the State for sale.”  The BLNR concluded, as relevant here:  
3.  [HRS § 189- 5] limits the prohibition on taking 
marine life for commercial purposes by [foreign 
nonimmigrant crewmembers] to marine life taken “in the 
waters of the S tate.” 
 
. . . . 
 
 
5.  This language, combined with HRS § 189
-2(a) 
regarding the requirement of getting a CML, means that in 
addition to someone who actually takes marine life for 
commercial purposes, someone who takes marine life outside 
the waters of the State, but brings it into the State for 
sale, must get a CML.  It does not, however, change the 
fact that the HRS § 189- 5 ban only refers to marine life 
actually caught in the waters of the State.      ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 8  . . . . 
 
7.  HRS § 189- 5 does not prohibit non- admitted aliens 
from working on boats that take marine life outside the waters of the State and bring it into the State for sale.  
 
8.  Petitioner makes an argument based on a provision 
in HRS § 189- 2(a) that a CML is required if one takes 
marine life for commercial purposes “whether the marine 
life is caught or taken within or outside of the State[.]”  
The short answer to this is that HRS § 189- 5 prohibits non-
admitted alien commercial fishing only “in the waters of the State.”  
 
9.  Petitioner may have been led astray, however, by 
inartful drafting of HRS § 189- 2(a) . . . .  
 
10.  Read literally, HRS § 189- 2(a) asserts that 
anyone taking marine life for commercial purposes anywhere 
on Earth must get a Hawai‘ i CML, because everywhere on Earth 
is either “within or outside of the State.”  This is an absurd reading.  Hawai‘ i
 cannot make people taking marine 
life in the Atlantic Ocean get a CML, absent some nexus to 
Hawai‘i[.] 
 
. . . .  
 
13.  In any case, [ ] whatever the territorial rea
ch 
of HRS § 189- 2(a) may be, HRS § 189- 5 applies only “in the 
waters of the State.”  
 
  The BLNR next concluded that the longline fishing 
vessels do not fish within the waters of the state.  The BLNR 
explained that when HRS § 189-5 was first enacted by Act 211, 
SLH 1949, the words “waters of the Territory of Hawai‘ i” meant a 
band around the islands extending three nautical miles from the 
shore.10  After statehood, HRS § 189-5 was amended so that 
                     
10  To support this proposition, the BLNR cited The King v. Parish, 1 
Haw. 36, 58 (Haw. Kingdom 1849); Carter v. Territory of Haw., 14 Haw. 465, 
468-69 (Haw. Terr. 1902); In re Bishop, 35 Haw. 608, 643- 44 (Haw. Terr. 
1940); Civ. Aeronautics Bd. v. Island Airlines, Inc., 235 F. Supp. 990, 1007 
(D. Haw. 1964), aff’d, 352 F.2d 735 (9th Cir. 1965); and Dettling v. United 
States, 983 F. Supp. 2d 1184, 1201 (D. Haw. 2013).   
(continued . . .)    ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 9 “waters of the Territory” became “waters of the State.”  The 
BL
NR then “consider[ed] whether ‘waters of the State’ now means 
something different.”  The BLNR recognized that its declaratory 
order could not be a definitive determination of Hawai‘ i’s 
current oceanic boundaries.  However, it held that “for the 
purposes of this declaratory order it is enough to demonstrate 
that the longline fishing boats do not fish within Hawai‘ i’s 
oceanic boundaries, even given the most expansive possible 
interpretation of those boundaries.”  The BLNR then considered several alternative interpretations of “waters of the State” and 
concluded that longline fishing vessels do not fish within the 
ambit of any interpretation.   
 
 In relevant part, the BLNR considered whether “waters 
of the State” includes archipelagic waters.  The BLNR conclude
d 
that: 
31.  The 1978 Constitutional Convention proposed an 
amendment to [a rticle XV, §1 of the state constitution] to 
add “and archipelagic” to the first sentence of this 
provision, which now reads “The State of Hawai‘ i shall 
consist of all the islands, together with their appurtenant 
reefs and territorial and archipelagic
 waters[.]”   
 
32.  The Proceedings of the 1978 Constitutional 
Convention do not fully explain what was meant by “archipelagic waters” . . . .  
                     
(. . . continued) 
The BLNR noted that it is not clear whether the “ 1949 Legislature 
considered the channels to be within the boundaries of the Territory.”  However, the BLNR held that the inclusion or exclusion of the channels “does not matter” because “longline boats do not fish in the channels.”   
      ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 
. . . . 
 
 10  34.  Art. 46
-47 of the . . . United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982) (“UNCLOS”) define circumstances under which an island nation (not an American 
state) may claim “archipelagic waters”, and the extent of 
such waters.  Essentially, the boundary lines are drawn 
from points on the outer islands, but cannot be more than 125 nautical miles long.  Drawing such lines from various 
points on the main Hawaiian Islands does not enclose any 
areas more than fifty miles to the north o r
 east of the 
islands, or more than one hundred miles to the west or 
south.  Thus, even assuming Hawai‘i’s oceanic boundaries now 
encompass “archipelagic waters” as so defined in 
international law . . . these longline boats do not fish 
within them. 
 
(First emphasis in original.) 
 
The BLNR also interpreted “waters of the State” to 
mean the “state marine waters,” which was defined in 1990 Haw. 
Sess. Laws Act 126, §1 at 232 to include the “territorial sea.”11  
Regarding Act 126, the BLNR concluded that: 
36.  Hawai‘ i’s statutes now apparently claim a twelve 
nautical mile wide territorial sea.  Act 126, SLH 1990, 
amended several sections of the Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes by 
adding a definition of “state marine waters”, including one 
section currently codified as HRS §189- 1.5:
 
 
State marine waters.  As used in this chapter, 
state marine waters shall be defined as extending 
from the upper reaches of the wash of the waves on 
shore seaward to the limit of the State’s police 
power and management authority, including the U.S. 
territorial sea, notwithstanding any law to the 
contrary. 
 
                     
11  The BLNR defined “territorial sea” or “marginal sea” as the 
oceanic boundaries of a state or nation, where the state or nation exercises sovereignty, except for certain rights of passage under international law.  
Presidential Proclamation 5928, dated December 27, 1988, extended the “territorial sea” from the former three- mile area to then encompass twelve 
nautical miles from the “baseline. ”      ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 11 37.  According to Conf. Com. Rep. 6 on H.B. 2233, 
which became Act 126:   
 
The purpose of this bill is to define the 
boundaries of the state marine waters as extending 
twelve nautical miles seaward from the upper reaches 
of the wash of the waves on shore and the 
archipelagic waters.  It also defines the territorial 
sea as the waters and seabed extending seaward to twelve nautical miles from the baseline as determined 
in accordance with international law and as 
established by Presidential Proclamation 5928, dated 
December 27, 1988. 
 
(Emphasis added.)  The BLNR ultimately held that “longline boats 
do not fish in this twelve-mile belt.”  (Emphasis added.)  
  The BLNR also clarified that article XI, section 11 of 
the Hawai‘ i Constitution does not determine, claim, or amend 
Hawai‘i’s boundar
ies.12   
                     
12  Article XI, section 11 of the Hawai‘ i Constitution provides that: 
 
The State of Hawai‘i  asserts and reserves its rights and 
interest in its exclusive economic zone for the purpose of 
exploring, exploiting, conserving and managing natural 
resources, both living and nonliving, of the seabed and 
subs
oil, and super adjacent waters. 
 
Article XI, section
 11 merely asserts the State’s rights to 
regulate and exploit within the EEZ. The BLNR also identified the State’s 
reserved authority within and outside “the territorial sea”: 
 
41.  When the Legislature dealt with the 
controversies over longline fishing near the Hawaiian 
Islands, it banned it in “the territorial sea.”  HRS §189-
2.5(b).  Outside the territorial sea, it asserted only that 
Hawai‘i could jointly enforce, with the federal government, 
regulation
s established under the federal regulatory system 
referred to above.  HRS §189- 2.5(c); HRS §189- 3.5.    ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 12   The BLNR then rejected Chun’s argument that “issuing 
CML to the alien crewmembers would authorize the crewmembers to
 
fish illegally.”  The BLNR explained that: 
43.  HRS §189- 5 does apply within Hawai‘ i’s  
territorial boundaries.  The CML would not authorize the 
holder, if he or she were an alien “not lawfully admitted,” 
to fish within Hawai‘ i’s territorial seas, which are “waters 
of the State.”  The fact that a person holds a CML does not 
authorize the person to ignore other laws regarding the 
taking of marine life. . . . The fact that a CML holder may possibly violate state laws in the future does not justify 
denying them a CML. 
 
44.  That these alien crewmembers— even if not 
“lawfully admitted” as the term is
 used in HRS §189-5— can 
lawfully fish somewhere without violating that statute, for example, on the high seas, is enough to deny this Petition, 
because it asks the Board to categorically deny that they can be issued CML’s [sic].  Because they can fish on the 
high seas and/or the EEZ without violating Hawai‘ i
 law, it 
makes sense to issue them a CML when they bring the catch to port.  This is not prohibited by HRS §189- 5 or any other 
law. 
 
45.  [Chun] conceded that HRS §189- 5 was 
“unenforceable” in the EEZ.
  
 
B. Circuit Court Proceedings  
Chun appealed to the circuit court, and filed a motion 
for summary judgment.  On July 1, 2019, the circuit court filed 
an order affirming the BLNR’s decision and denied Chun’s motion for summary judgment.  The circuit court ruled, inter alia, that 
“[HRS §] 189-2 applies in general to the issuance of [CMLs] and does not contain a limitation relative to the issuance of a 
license concerning being lawfully permitted to be in the United 
States.”  The circuit court additionally concluded: 
[HRS §] 189- 5 makes it unlawful for any person who is not 
lawfully admitted to the United States to engage in the    ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 13 taking of marine life for commercial purposes in the waters 
of the [S]tate of Hawai‘ i.  And here, the fishermen in 
question are not eng
aged in the taking of marine life for 
commercial purposes in the waters of the State of Hawai‘ i. 
 
And that specific provision here, in the Court’s view 
respectfully, is controlling.   
 
C.  Proceedings on Appeal  
  On appeal, Chun argues that the circuit court erred in 
affirming the BLNR’s order that (1) foreign nonimmigrant 
crewmembers were “lawfully admitted” to the United States; (2) 
CMLs can be issued to persons not “lawfully admitted” to the 
United States; and (3) “a factual record of alien fishers 
holding commercial fishing licenses and conducting commercial 
fishing within state waters, was a required element of relief 
sought by the Petition.”   
  The State’s answering brief argues that the 
legislative history of HRS § 189-5 reveals the legislature’s 
intent to ban “[a]liens not admitted to the United States” – as opposed to aliens who are legally in the United States – from 
commercial fishing in state waters.  Therefore, foreign 
nonimmigrant crewmembers on longline fishing vessels are 
“lawfully admitted” to the United States.  Moreover, the State 
contended that Chun does not dispute the fact that most longline 
vessels fish in waters beyond the EEZ.   
  HLA reiterates its arguments raised below in its 
answering brief.      ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 14 III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW  
A.  Administrative Agency Decisions – Secondary Appeals 
 
Review of a decision made by the circuit court upon 
its review of an agency’ s decision is a secondary appeal.  
The standard of review is one in which this court must 
determine whether the circuit court was right or wrong in 
its decision, applying the standards set forth in HRS § 91-
14(g) [1993] to the agency’ s decision. 
 
Flores v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res., 143 Hawai‘ i 114, 120, 424 P.3d 
469, 475 (2018) (alteration in original) (quoting Paul’s Elec. 
Serv., Inc. v. Befitel, 104 Hawai‘ i 412, 416, 91 P.3d 494, 498 
(2004)). 
HRS § 91-14(g) (Supp. 2017) states: 
 
Upon review of the record, the court may affirm the 
decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions 
for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the 
decision and order if the substantial rights of the 
petitioners may have been prejudiced because the 
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders 
are: 
 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory 
provisions; 
 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or 
jurisdiction of the agency; 
 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; 
 
(4) Affected by other error of law; 
 
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, 
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole 
record; or 
 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by 
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise 
of discretion.  
 
“[U]nder HRS § 91-14(g), conclusions of law are 
reviewable under subsections (1), (2), and (4); questions    ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 15 regarding procedural defects under subsection (3); findings of 
fact under subsection (5); and an agency’s exercise of 
discretion under subsection (6).”  Flores, 143 Hawai‘i at 121, 
424 P.3d at 476 (alteration in original) (internal quotation 
marks omitted) (quoting Paul’s Elec. Serv., Inc., 104 Hawai‘ i at 
416, 91 P.3d at 498). 
B.  Statutory Interpretation  
 
“Statutory interpretation is a question of law 
reviewable de novo.”  State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai‘ i 383, 390, 219 
P.3d 1170, 1177 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
  This court’s construction of statutes is shaped by the 
following rules: 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.  
Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its 
plain and obvious meaning.  Third, implicit in the 
task of statutory construction is our foremost 
obligation to ascertain and give effect to the 
intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained 
primarily from the language contained in the statute 
itself.  Fourth, when there is doubt, doubleness of 
meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an 
expression used in a statute, an ambiguity exists. 
 
When there is ambiguity in a statute, “the meaning of the

history, or the reason and spirit of the law.

 16 IV. DISCUSSION    
A.  HRS § 189-5 Does Not Prohibit the DLNR From Issuing CMLs to  Foreign Nonimmigrant Crewmembers on Longline Fishing 
 Vessels Under HRS § 189-2    
  This case requires us to consider the provisions of 
two statutes, which provide, in relevant part, as follows:   
No person shall take marine life for commercial purposes 
whether the marine life is caught or taken within or 
outside of the State, without first obtaining a commercial 
marine license as provided in this section. 
 
HRS § 189-2(a). 
 
It is unlawful for any person who has not been lawfully 
admitted to the United States to engage in taking marine 
life for commercial purposes in the waters of the State. 
 
HRS § 189-5. 
 
Chun contends that the DLNR violates HRS § 189-5 by 
issuing CMLs under HRS § 189-2 to foreign nonimmigrant 
crewmembers on longline fishing vessels.  We disagree.  Rather, 
as the BLNR found, “HRS § 189-5 . . . prohibits non-admitted 
aliens from the commercial taking of marine life ‘in the waters 
of the State.’  It does not prohibit them from taking marine 
life outside the waters of the State and bringing it into the 
State for sale.”  (Emphasis in original.) 
1.  HRS § 189-2 permits the DLNR to issue CMLs to foreign 
nonimmigrant crewmembers on longline fishing vessels   
  
  “[T]he fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.”  Wheeler, 
121 Hawai‘ i at 390, 219 P.3d at 1177 (quoting Citizens Against    ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 17 Reckless Dev., 114 Hawai‘i at 193–94, 159 P.3d at 152–53).  HRS § 
189-2(a) states, “No person shall take marine life for 
commercial purposes whether the marine life is caught or taken 
within or outside of the State, without first obtaining a [CML] 
as provided in this section.”  (Emphasis added.)  Our court has 
long established that “where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and 
obvious meaning.”  Wheeler, 121 Hawai‘ i at 390, 219 P.3d at 1177 
(citations omitted).  However, “where a statute is susceptible 
of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful 
constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such 
questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter.”  In re 
Doe, 96 Hawai‘ i 73, 81, 26 P.3d 562, 570 (2001) (quoting U.S. ex 
rel Att'y Gen. v. Del. & Hudson Co., 213 U.S. 366, 408 (1909)); 
cf. Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 381 (2005).   
  Were we to adopt Chun’s interpretation, HRS § 189-2 
would require any person taking any marine life anywhere in the 
world for commercial purposes to first obtain a CML from the 
DLNR.  A literal reading of the statute would thus result in an 
absurdity; the legislature does not have the power to regulate    ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
18 The BLNR instead concluded that HRS § 189-2 requires 
CMLs in two scenarios  that give rise to a Hawai ‘i nexus: (1) when 
taking marine life within state waters for commercial purposes, 
and (2) when bringing marine life taken from outside state 
waters for commercial purposes in the state.  This 
interpretation avoids absurd and unintended results; we thus 
conclude that the BLNR’s interpretation of HRS § 189 -2 to 
require CMLs in the two  aforementioned scenarios is correct.  
13Indeed, we note that such a construction would likely violate the 
dormant commerce clause. See Healy v. Beer Inst., Inc., 491 U.S. 324, 336 
(1989) (“[A] statute that directly controls commerce occurring wholly outside 
the boundaries of a State exceeds the inherent limits of the enacting State’s 
authority and is invalid regardless of whether the statute’s extraterritorial 
reach was intended by the legislature.”); State v. Alangcas, 134 Hawai‘ i 515, 
536, 345 P.3d 181, 202 (2015) (“The doctrine of the dormant commerce clause 
is a result implied from the federal government’s exclusive authority to 
control interstate commerce and may require a court to invalidate a state law 
that interferes with that authority.” (footnote and citation omitted)); but 
see Oral Argument at 13:03, Chun v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res., -- Hawai‘i --, -- 
P.3d -–, 2022 WL --, (August 11, 2022) (mem.),
http://oaoa.hawaii.gov/jud/oa/20/SCOA_091820_SCAP_19_501.mp3.conduct that lacks a cognizable connection to the state.   
Therefore, we must construe the statute to require a CML only when 
the taking of marine life has some nexus to the state.  See State 
v. McKnight, 131 Hawai‘i 379, 389, 319. P.3d 298, 308
(2013) (“Even where a statute appears unambiguous, the court may 
deviate from a literal application of the language in order to
 
avoid absurdity and give effect to the legislature’s intended 
purpose.” (citation omitted)).13   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 19 Cf. State v. Park, 55 Haw. 610, 614, 525 P.2d 586, 589-90 (1974) 
(“It is well settled and established in this jurisdiction that 
courts are required to construe and interpret a statute where it 
is ambiguous, or, absent such ambiguity, where the literal 
application of the statute causes an absurd or unjust result[.]”).   
2.  HRS § 189-5 prohibits the issuance of CMLs to persons 
not “lawfully admitted” to the United States for 
purposes of taking fishing only within state waters  
 
  In turn, HRS § 189-5 provides, “It is unlawful for any 
person who has not been lawfully admitted to the United States 
to engage in taking marine life for commercial purposes in the 
waters of the State.”  (Emphasis added.)  Unlike HRS § 189-2, 
this statute is unambiguous.  See, e.g., Park, 55 Haw. at 614, 
525 P.2d at 590 (“[W]here there is no ambiguity in the language of a statute, and the literal application of the language would 
not produce an absurd or unjust result . . . there is no room 
for judicial construction and interpretation, and the statute 
must be given effect according to its plain and obvious meaning.”).  The statute precludes persons not lawfully admitted 
to the United States from taking marine life within state waters 
for commercial purposes.  Moreover, the statute makes no mention of the taking of marine life outside of state waters.      ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 20   If the legislature intended HRS § 189-5 to prohibit 
those not lawfully admitted to the United States from taking 
marine life outside of the state for commercial purposes within 
the state, we presume it would have said so.  See State v. 
Demello, 136 Hawai‘i 193, 195, 361 P.3d 420, 422 (2015) (“[T]his 
court must presume that the legislature meant what it said and is further barred from rejecting otherwise unambiguous statutory 
language.” (citation omitted)); cf. State v. Haugen, 104 Hawai‘ i 
71, 76, 85 P.3d 178, 183 (2004).  In contrast, the legislature 
provided in HRS §189-2 that a CML is required before any person 
“take[s] marine life for commercial purposes whether the marine 
life is caught or taken within or outside of the State.”  
(Emphasis added).  The express inclusion of “outside of the State” in HRS § 189-2 suggests that the legislature 
“intentionally and purposely” excluded similar language from HRS 
§ 189-5 that would prohibit those not lawfully admitted to the 
United States from taking marine life outside of the state for 
commercial purposes within the state.  See In re Water Use 
Permit Applications, 94 Hawai‘ i 97, 151, 9 P.3d 409, 463 (2000) 
(quoting Gozlon–Peretz v. United States, 498 U.S. 395, 404 
(1991)) (“[W]here [the legislature] includes particular language 
in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of 
the same Act, it is generally presumed that [the legislature]    ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 21 acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or 
exclusion.” (Brackets in original.))  
  Chun argues that the “DLNR’s issuance of a [CML] to non-citizen commercial fishers pursuant to HRS § 189-2, without 
qualification or limit to the use of those licenses,” violates HRS § 189-5.  He further argues that issuing such a CML 
“provide[s] no restrictions on the license-holder and leaves it 
entirely to the licensee to determine what restrictions are 
placed upon the license by law.”  In support of this contention, 
Chun cites Alaloa v. Plan. Comm’n of Maui Cnty., 68 Haw. 135, 
705 P.2d 1042 (1985), and argues that this court has rejected the “self-regulation” of licenses.   
  Chun’s reliance on Alaloa is misplaced.  In Alaloa, 
this court rejected the Maui Planning Commission’s grant of a conditional permit to the developer of a large condominium 
construction project in a special management area that was 
governed by the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA).  
Specifically, the permit was “conditioned upon retention of a 
qualified archaeologist to conduct a further survey and 
excavation of the area . . . [and] to determine the significance 
of [the] various archaeological sites” located near the development.  Alaloa, 68 Haw. at 136-37, 705 P.2d at 1044.  This 
court, concluding that the commission erred in granting the    ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 22 conditional permit, explained that “the CZMA mandates that 
[findings regarding the archaeological significance and 
preservation of those sites] must first be made before a 
[permit] can be issued.”  Id. at 137, 705 P.2d at 1044 (emphases 
in original).  By granting the permit, the commission created “self-serving conditions” wherein the developer was allowed to 
determine whether it “complie[d] with the policies and 
objectives of the CZMA regarding historical and archaeological 
significance.”  Id.  We thus concluded that the commission 
violated its duties under the CZMA to ensure that “the proposed development project[] [was] consistent with the[] [state’s] 
policies and objectives” under the CZMA.  Id. at 136, 705 P.2d 
at 1044.   
The Alaloa holding is distinguishable.  The DLNR does 
not violate HRS § 189-5 by issuing CMLs under HRS § 189-2 to 
foreign nonimmigrant crewmembers on longline fishing vessels, 
nor does it consign any of its duties under HRS § 189-5 to the 
licensee.  Certainly, issuing a CML to a foreign nonimmigrant 
crewmember on a longline fishing vessel for marine life caught 
outside of state waters is permissible under HRS § 189-2 and 
additionally complies with HRS § 189-5.  These foreign 
crewmembers are not left “to determine what restrictions are 
placed upon” them as Chun contends; rather, HRS § 189-5    ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 23 expressly prohibits them from “engag[ing] in taking marine life 
for commercial purposes in the waters of the State.”  Alaloa is 
thus inapposite.   
3.  HRS §§ 189-2 and 189-5 are not in conflict with one 
another  
 
  That HRS § 189-2 makes no reference to HRS § 189-5 is 
immaterial.  Both statutes relate to the issuance of CMLs, and 
“[l]aws in pari materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall 
be construed with reference to each other.”  Richardson v. City 
& Cnty. of Honolulu, 76 Hawai‘ i 46, 55, 868 P.2d 1193, 1202 
(1994) (alteration in original) (quoting HRS § 1-16 (1985)).  
Moreover, “where the statutes simply overlap in their 
application, effect will be given to both if possible, as repeal 
by implication is disfavored.”  Id. (quoting Mahiai v. Suwa, 69 
Haw. 349, 356-57, 742 P.2d 359, 366 (1987)).  HRS § 189-2 mandates who must have a CML, whereas HRS § 189-5 limits where 
persons not lawfully admitted to the United States may engage in 
the taking of marine life for commercial purposes.  The statutes 
are not in conflict with one another as each serves separate and 
distinct purposes regarding the same subject matter.  See 
Richardson, 76 Hawai‘ i at 55, 868 P.2d at 1202 (holding that HRS 
§§ 46-1.5(6) (Supp. 1992), 46-61 (1985), 46-62 (1985), and 101-2 
(1985) do not conflict but rather complement each other because, 
read in pari materia, HRS §§ 46-1.5(6) and 101-2 provide    ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 24 counties with the power of eminent domain, HRS § 46-61 
establishes the public uses for which the counties may use the 
power, and HRS § 46-62 establishes the procedures counties must use “in exercising the power”).   
Indeed, a person not lawfully admitted to the United 
States may receive a CML pursuant to HRS § 189-2 and would not violate HRS § 189-5 so long as that individual does not take 
marine life within state waters.  Construing the statutes in 
pari materia: (1) under HRS § 189-2, any person who intends to 
take marine life from waters within or outside the state for 
commercial purposes within the state must first obtain a CML; 
(2) as HRS § 189-2 makes no mention of citizenship status, individuals not lawfully admitted to the United States are 
permitted to received CMLs pursuant to HRS § 189-2; (3) under 
HRS § 189-5, individuals not lawfully admitted to the United 
States may not engage in taking marine life for commercial 
purposes in the waters of the state; and (4) even if individuals 
not lawfully admitted to the United States have valid CMLs 
pursuant to HRS § 189-2, they are still prohibited by HRS § 189-
5 from “taking marine life for commercial purposes in the waters 
of the State.”    ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 25 (continued . . .) 
 B.  Longline Fishing Vessels Do Not Take Marine Life Within 
 the “Waters of the State” or Hawai‘ i’s Territorial Sea 
 
 Chun further contends that the “waters of the State” 
– under HRS § 189-5 and for purposes of the state’s regulatory 
authority – extend 200 miles from Hawai‘ i’s shores, to include 
the area of the federal EEZ.14  Thus, Chun argues that HRS § 189-
5 prohibits the foreign longline crewmembers at issue from 
“taking marine life for commercial purposes” within 200 miles 
off Hawai‘ i’s shores.  Chun also argues that the state’s 
regulatory authority extends no further than the same 200-mile 
boundary, meaning that the privileges granted by a CML can only 
be exercised within the 200-mile boundary.  Taken together, Chun 
contends that because the foreign longline crewmembers cannot 
fish within the 200-mile boundary, but the privileges of a CML 
can only be exercised within the 200-mile boundary, there is no 
way for a foreign longline crewmember to lawfully exercise the privileges of a CML.
15   
                     
14  Proclamation No. 5030, 48 Fed. Reg. 10605 (Mar. 10, 1983) 
proclaimed that the EEZ “extends to a distance 200 nautical miles from the 
baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.” 
 
15  At oral argument, counsel for Chun argued:  
 
The issue basically boils down to the State cannot 
issue licenses to individuals that can basically never 
exercise the privileges granted under that license. . . . 
Our position is that there is no place within the s tate’s 
jurisdiction under the statute that these individuals can 
take [CMLs]. . . . In this instance, there’ s no . . . where    ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 26 We reject Chun’s premise that under the relevant 
statutory framework, “waters of the State” extend 200 miles from 
Hawai
‘i’s shoreline to include the entire area of the federal 
EEZ.  Further, we conclude that the BLNR’s findings that th
e 
longline vessels at issue in this case do not fish within the 
“waters of the State,” the state marine waters, or the channels 
between the islands, is not clearly erroneous.   
1. The state’s statutory authority to regulate longline 
fishing extends from 
Hawai‘i’s shores to the 
territorial sea and the archipelagic waters 
 
Chun’s arguments on appeal focus solely on the 
intersection of HRS §§ 189-2 and 189-5.  HRS §§ 189-2 and 189-5 are general laws in that they address fishing generally and do 
not explicitly address longline fishing.  As HLA notes, HRS §§ 
189-2 and 189-5 are not the only statutes applicable to the 
longline vessels at issue in this case.  HRS § 189-2.5 (2011) 
provides specific guidance on longline fishing: 
(b) It is unlawful to engage in longline fishing or to sell 
or offer for sale, any marine life taken with longline fishing 
gear within the boundaries of the State's territorial sea. 
 . . . .  
                     
(. . . continued) 
an individual with this license anywhere within the state’s 
jurisdiction or management . . . can legally fish.

 27 (d) The State shall have authority to enforce this section 
and the rules adopted by the Western Pacific Regional Fishery 
Management Council through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration and incorporated by reference into state law within: 
 (1) The State’ s marine waters as defined in section 189-
1.5[.]
 
 
It is a well-accepted “canon of construction that 
statutes that are in pari materia may be construed together,” 
State v. Kamana‘ o, 118 Hawai‘ i 210 , 218, 188 P.3d 724, 732 
(2008), so that “[w]hat is clear in one statute may be called 
upon in aid to explain what is doubtful in another,”  HRS § 1-16 
(2009).  Therefore, because HRS § 189-2.5 is a prohibition on 
longline fishing, it is relevant to this court’s analysis. 
To summarize these pertinent parts of HRS § 189-2.5:  
(1) longline fishing is prohibited within the state’s territorial sea, and (2) the state’s authority to regulate 
longline fishing extends to the boundaries of the state’s marine 
waters.   
The state’s marine waters are defined by HRS § 189-1.5 
(2011) as ”extending from the upper reaches of the wash of the 
waves on shore seaward to the limit of the State’s police power and management authority, including the United States 
territorial sea, notwithstanding any law to the contrary.”  The 
legislative history of HRS § 189-1.5 states:  
The purpose of this bill is to define the boundaries of the 
state marine waters as extending twelve nautical miles 
seaward from the upper reaches of the wash of the waves on    ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 28 shore and the archipelagic waters.  It also defines the 
territorial sea as the waters and seabed extending seaward 
to twelve nautical miles from the baseline of the United 
States as determined in accordance with international law 
and as established by Presidential Proclamation 5928, dated December 27, 198 8.
16    
 
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 6, in 1990 House Journal, at 756, 1990 
Senate Journal, at 759 (emphasis added).  Thus, the legislature 
intended that “State marine waters” encompassed both the United 
States territorial sea, as described in Presidential 
Proclamation 5928, and the “archipelagic waters” of the state.  
Presidential Proclamation 5928 provides that “[t]he 
territorial sea of the United States henceforth extends to 12 
nautical miles from the baselines of the United States 
determined in accordance with international law.”  Proclamation No. 5928, 54 Fed. Reg. 777 (Dec. 27, 1988) (emphasis added).  
Thus, we conclude that the territorial sea contemplated in HRS 
§§ 189-1.5 and 189-2.5 extend twelve nautical miles from 
Hawai‘i’s baseline.    
                     
16  President Ronald Reagan issued Presidential Proclamation 5928, 
entitled “Territorial Sea of the United States of America,” on December 27, 
1988.  Proclamation No. 5928, 54 Fed. Reg. 777 (Dec. 27, 1988).  In 
Proclamation 5928, President Reagan extended the United States’ territorial sea to “12 nautical miles from the baselines of the United States,” reasoning 
that “[e]xten[ding] the territorial sea . . . to the limits permitted by 
international law will advance the national security and other significant 
interests of the United States.”  Id.  Proclamation 5928 explicitly states, 
“Nothing in this Proclamation . . . extends or otherwise alters existing 
Federal or State law or any jurisdiction, rights, legal interests, or 
obligations derived therefrom[.]”  Id.    ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 29 The legislature also employed the term “archipelagic 
waters” in the conference committee report for HRS § 189-1.5 but 
did not provide a definition.  See Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 6, in 
1990 House Journal, at 756, 1990 Senate Journal, at 759.  The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) defined the extent of “archipelagic waters” as “the waters 
enclosed by the archipelagic baselines drawn in accordance with 
article 47 . . . regardless of their depth or distance from the 
coast.”  UNCLOS art. 49, ¶ 1, Dec. 10, 1982, 1833 U.N.T.S. 397.  
Under UNCLOS art. 47, ¶ 1, archipelagic baselines are determined 
by drawing straight lines “joining the outermost points of the 
outermost islands and drying reefs of the archipelago” to create an area enclosing the main islands.  Id. at art. 47, ¶ 1.  
Although the United States has not ratified UNCLOS, the UNCLOS definition of “archipelagic waters” is widely accepted in 
international law.  See, e.g., Restatement (Third) of Foreign 
Relations Law § 11 cmt. (referencing the UNCLOS definition).  As 
the BLNR found, the archipelagic waters of Hawai‘i do not extend 
“more than fifty miles to the north or east of the islands, or 
more than one hundred miles to the west or south.”  Importantly, 
it is undisputed that longline fishing vessels do not fish 
within the archipelagic waters.      ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
30 In summary, neither the territorial sea nor the “State 
marine waters” encompass the 200-mile area of the federal EEZ.  
By prohibiting longline fishing in 
Hawai‘i’s territorial sea in 
HRS § 189-2.5, the legislature intended to prohibit longline 
fishing within a 12-mile area.  Further, the “State marine 
waters,” which the legislature intended to include the 
territorial sea and the archipelagic waters, do not encompass the 200-mile area of the federal EEZ.  Therefore, under HRS §§ 
189-2.5 and 189-1.5, the state’s current statutory authority to
regulate longline fishing does not extend to the outer limits of
the federal EEZ.
2. The longline fishing vessels at issue in this case do
not fish within the “waters of the State,” the state 
marine waters, or the channels between the islands
The BLNR’s findings of fact note that “longline boats
do not fish closer than fifty miles to the north and east of the 
main Hawaiian Islands, and [not closer than] one hundred miles 
to the south and west of the main Hawaiian Islands.”  On appeal 
to this court, an agency’s finding of fact will be reversed only 
where the finding of fact is “[c]learly erroneous in view of the 
reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole 
record.”  HRS § 91-14(g); see Flores, 143 Hawai ‘i at 121, 424 
P.3d at 476.  Chun does not contest this finding of fact, nor   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***__ 
 
 
 31 does he point to any contrary evidence.   Thus, the BLNR’s 
finding of fact was not clearly erroneous. 17
As to the state’s marine waters, the BLNR explicitly 
found that “[t]he longline boats do not fish in this twelve-mile 
belt
.”  Another BLNR conclusion of law specifically addressed 
waters between the islands, finding that “[t]he longline boats 
do not fish in the channels.”  On appeal, Chun does not 
challenge these conclusions of law.  We thus accept the BLNR’s 
conclusions that the longline fishing vessels at issue in this 
case do not fish within the 12-mile area of the state marine 
waters, including the channels between the islands.   
Under the current statutory framework, the legislature 
delegated to the DLNR the authority to issue CMLs to persons that take marine life within or outside the State for commercial 
purposes.  Notwithstanding the undisputed fact that longline 
fishing vessels at issue do not fish within the “waters of the 
State” under HRS § 189-5, the statute nonetheless allows CMLs to 
be issued to a foreign nonimmigrant crewmember on a longline 
fishing vessel for marine life caught outside state waters.   
                     
17  Chun argues in his Opening Brief that the BLNR’s conclusions of 
law were premised on “clear factual errors.”  Specifically, Chun argues that 
the “BLNR incorrectly concluded the ‘waters of the State’ . . . do not 
include waters of the EEZ,” citing to the BLNR’s conclusions of law within 
the BLNR’s broader conclusion that “[t]he [l]ongline [b]oats do not [f]ish 
‘in the [w]aters of the State.’”  In its Answering Brief, the BLNR pointed out that Chun’s Opening Brief did not dispute the findings of fact that
