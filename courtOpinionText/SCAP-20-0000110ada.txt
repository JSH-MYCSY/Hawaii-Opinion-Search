OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J. 
 
In July 2019, construction of an astronomical observatory 
(the Thirty Meter Telescope or TMT) near the Mauna Kea summit 
loomed.  That month, law enforcement officers arrested over 
thirty protesters on Mauna Kea’s slopes.  Hoping to thwart the Thirty Meter Telescope’s construction, the protesters had 
blocked the road leading to the TMT’s planned site.  Later, the 
State charged these protesters with obstructing a highway or 
public passage. Electronically Filed

  The arrests and charges followed a lengthy legal and 
political battle over Mauna Kea’s future.  KAHEA: The Hawaiian 
Environmental Alliance, is an outspoken anti-TMT partisan in 
that scrap.  One way KAHEA opposed development on Mauna Kea was 
through its Aloha ʻ Āina Support Fund.  According to KAHEA’s 
website, the Aloha 
ʻĀina Support Fund “prioritizes frontline 
logistical support for non-violent direct actions taken to 
protect Mauna Kea from further industrial development.”  
In November 2019, the State of Hawai‘ i Attorney General (the 
State AG or Attorney General) issued a subpoena duces tecum to 
First Hawaiian Bank (the Subpoena).  The Subpoena commanded the 
bank to produce eighteen categories of records from KAHEA’s 
accounts.  KAHEA moved to quash the Subpoena.  It claimed the 
Subpoena was retaliatory harassment.  KAHEA said the State AG 
wanted to punish it for its anti-TMT advocacy.  
 The State AG maintained that the Subpoena was not 
retaliatory.  The Attorney General said an ongoing investigation 
justified the Subpoena.  The State wondered whether the 
Aloha ʻĀina Support Fund’s (the Fund) financial support for 
“direct action” on Mauna Kea meant KAHEA had an “illegal 
purpose” that made it ineligible for an income taxation 
exemption under Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(3). 
The circuit court did not quash the entire Subpoena.  But 
it disallowed fifty percent of the Subpoena’s requests.  And *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
3 
  though the Subpoena sought documents connected to “all financial 
records of KAHEA,” the court trimmed the Subpoena’s scope to 
“any account that holds assets belonging to the Aloha ʻ Āina 
Support Fund.” 
On appeal, KAHEA argues that the whole Subpoena should have 
been quashed because it: (1) exceeds the Attorney General’s statutory authority under Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 28-2.5 
(2009); (2) is unreasonable, oppressive, and subject to quashing 
under HRS § 28-2.5(e); and (3) violates KAHEA’s First Amendment 
rights. 
 Each of these arguments in some way flows from KAHEA’s 
underlying contention that the Subpoena is retaliatory. 
The State AG portrays the Subpoena as a legitimate and 
reasonable exercise of its investigatory powers.  The Attorney General rejects KAHEA’s retaliation claim as unsupported by the 
record.  It asserts the Subpoena’s constitutionality.  
We agree with the State AG that its investigatory powers 
validated the Subpoena.  But we conclude that two Subpoena 
requests seeking information about monies going into rather than 
coming out of KAHEA’s bank accounts are unreasonable. 
We also conclude that KAHEA’s argument about the Subpoena 
curtailing its First Amendment freedom of speech rights fails: 
the Subpoena neither punishes nor forbids KAHEA’s speech.  And – though KAHEA’s contention that the State AG had some retaliatory *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
4 
  animus towards KAHEA is not entirely unpersuasive — we further 
conclude that KAHEA’s First Amendment retaliation claim also 
fails; the record lacks a showing that retaliatory motive was a 
substantial or motivating factor in the Subpoena’s issuance. 
I. BACKGROUND 
A. KAHEA and its opposition to development on Mauna Kea 
KAHEA is a community-based charitable organization in 
Hawai‘i; it describes itself as promoting “cultural understanding 
and environmental justice.”  
KAHEA opposes development on Mauna Kea.  One way it does 
this is by operating the Aloha ʻ Āina Support Fund.  KAHEA touts 
the Fund as “prioritiz[ing] frontline logistical support for non-violent direct actions taken to protect Mauna Kea from 
further industrial development.”  Its website announces that the “logistical support” the Fund provides includes the “provision 
of bail where appropriate.” 
KAHEA has also pursued legal challenges to the TMT’s 
construction.  In two appeals before this court, KAHEA was 
adverse to the State of Hawaiʻ i Board of Land and Natural 
Resources (the BLNR).  Both appeals stemmed from contested cases 
before the BLNR concerning a conservation district use permit 
issued for the TMT’s construction.  In these appeals, attorneys 
from the Attorney General’s office represented the BLNR.  See 
Mauna Kea Anaina Hou v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res., 136 Hawaiʻ i 376, *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

  363 P.3d 224 (2015); Matter of Conservation Dist. Use 
Application HA-3568, 143 Hawaiʻ i 379, 431 P.3d 752 (2018). 
B. The Subpoena 
On November 14, 2019, the Attorney General served First 
Hawaiian Bank with the Subpoena.  The Subpoena covered bank records generated between January 1, 2017, and November 12, 
2019.  It sought eighteen categories of records relating to 
KAHEA: 
1. Monthly Statements; 
2. Signature/Account cards; 
3. All Debit card assignments and numbers from the dates 
you need; 
4. Power of attorneys; 
5. Deposit tickets with offset items; 
6. Cancelled checks; 
7. Debit memos; 
8. Credit memos; 
9. Applications of loans; 
10. All notice of adverse action against account holders; 
11. Other subpoenas requesting records from the account; 
12. Request for money/wire transfers; 
13. Application for cashier’s checks with the cancelled 
cashier’s checks; 
14. Tax returns submitted with application for loans; 
15. All delinquency notices of account sent to account 
holders. 
16. Photo of debit card issued; 
17. Directory that translate [sic] the numerical bank code 
information to an address of the branch; 
18. Bank surveillance photos to include those from ATM machines. 
 
The Subpoena declared that it was issued “in accordance 
with [HRS §] 28-2.5.”  HRS § 28-2.5(a) provides that “[t]he 
attorney general shall investigate alleged violations of the law when directed to do so by the governor, or when the attorney 
general determines that an investigation would be in the public 
interest.”  Under HRS § 28-2.5(b), “[t]he attorney general, when *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
6 conducting a civil, administrative, or criminal 
investigation . . . may . . . require the production of any 
books, papers, documents, or other objects designated therein or 
any other record however maintained, including those 
electronically stored, which are relevant or material to the 
investigation.” 
C. Circuit court proceedings
KAHEA moved to quash the Subpoena in a special proceeding  
before the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.   It argued that 
the State AG’s investigation was not “in the public interest” 
because it was retaliatory harassment for KAHEA’s opposition to 
development on Mauna Kea.  KAHEA also argued that the Subpoena 
was unreasonable, overly broad and oppressive. 1
The State AG opposed KAHEA’s motion to quash.   It 
maintained that the Subpoena advanced two ongoing investigations 
into KAHEA’s “alleged violations of the law”: (1) an 
investigation into KAHEA’s “continued failure to file required 
financial reports” and related allegedly improper solicitation 
of donations;  and (2) an investigation into whether the Fund’s 
support of putatively illegal anti-TMT actions gave KAHEA an 2

2Under HRS § 467B-9(h) (2013 ), charitable organizations that have not 
complied with the financial reporting requirements of Chapter 467B may not 
“solicit contributions from persons in the State or otherwise operate in the 
State as a charitable organization . . . .” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
7 
  illegal purpose such that it could not properly claim Internal 
Revenue Code § 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.   The State AG 
highlighted its affirmative duty to oversee Hawai‘ i’s charitable
organizations.  See HRS § 28-5.2(a) (“The attorney general shall
represent the public interest in the protection of charitable 
assets . . . .”).  It argued that both of its investigations 
into KAHEA were good faith efforts to fulfill that duty. 3
 
 
The circuit court rejected the State AG’s arguments 
concerning the need to investigate KAHEA’s noncompliance with 
state financial reporting requirements.4  But the court accepted 
the State AG’s argument that it had a responsibility to investigate whether KAHEA had an illegal purpose and was therefore improperly claiming tax-exempt status under 
§ 501(c)(3).  The court ruled that the Attorney General could 
subpoena KAHEA’s financial records on those grounds.  
But the circuit court had concerns about several of the 
Subpoena’s document requests.  After providing the parties an 
opportunity to resolve their differences over specific document 
requests (they did not), the court exercised its discretion.  It disallowed nine of the eighteen requests, specifically Subpoena 
                         
3 Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code allows a federal tax 
exemption for nonprofit organizations.   
 
4 The court stated: “I’m not going to be approving a subpoena based on 
the [financial reports] issue.  I thought I made that clear.  Just so you 
know . . . that ship’s not going to sail.” 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

  request numbers two, three, four, ten, eleven, fifteen, sixteen,
seventeen, and eighteen.   Further, though the Subpoena sought 
documents relating to “all financial records of KAHEA,” the court narrowed the Subpoena’s reach to “any account that holds 
assets belonging to the Aloha ʻ Āina Support Fund.” 5 
D. Proceedings on appeal 
On appeal,6 KAHEA attacks the Subpoena on three fronts.   
First, KAHEA argues that despite HRS § 28-2.5’s broad 
language, the State AG lacked statutory authority to issue the 
Subpoena because the State AG’s putative “investigation”: (1) 
does not involve KAHEA’s alleged violations of law; (2) was not 
directed by the governor; and (3) is not in the public interest.  The State AG rejects KAHEA’s claim.  The Subpoena, it asserts, 
was justified by an ongoing investigation into whether KAHEA 
financially supported illegal activities while claiming tax 
benefits reserved for charitable organizations.  
In explaining the need for its investigation, the State AG
discussed a 1975 IRS revenue ruling concerning an antiwar  
                         
5 These requests sought: two (Signature/Account cards); three (All Debit 
card assignments and numbers from the dates you need); four (Power of 
attorneys ); ten (All notice of adverse action against account holders); 
eleven (Other subpoenas requesting records from the account); fifteen (All 
delinquency notice of account sent to account holders) ; sixteen (Photo of 
debit card issued); seventeen (Directory that translate [sic] the numerical 
bank code information to an address of the branch); and eighteen (Bank 
surveillance photos to include those from ATM machines). 
 
6 KAHEA  appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals.  It then applied 
for, and received, direct transfer of the case to this court. 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

  protest organization that planned and sponsored acts of civil 
disobedience.  In its ruling, the IRS determined that the 
organization had an “illegal purpose.”   As a result, the 
organization did not “qualify for exemption from Federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Code” because it was “not 
operated exclusively for charitable purposes . . . .”  See Rev. 
Rul. 75-384, 1975-2 C.B. 204. 7
Second, KAHEA argues that the Subpoena should be quashed 
because it is unreasonable or oppressive under HRS § 28-2.5(e), under which the court, “on motion promptly made, may quash or 
modify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or 
oppressive or violate any privilege the witness may be entitled 
to exercise in a court proceeding.”   
KAHEA generally brands the Subpoena as an overbroad 
“fishing expedition.”  KAHEA does not pointedly explain why any 
particular Subpoena request is unreasonable or oppressive
8 given 
the nature of the Attorney General’s investigation.  In its 
answering brief, the State AG says KAHEA “simply cannot show” 
that the Subpoena was a “fishing expedition.”  The State AG also 
                         
7 In reaching this determination, the IRS considered that the 
organization sponsored antiwar demonstrations where participants violated 
local ordinances and “breache[d] public order” by “deliberately block[ing] 
vehicular or pedestrian traffic, disrupt[ing] the work of government, and 
prevent[ing] the movement of supplies.”  Rev. Rul. 75- 384, 1975- 2 C.B. 204. 
 
8 KAHEA’s arguments about the Subpoena’s oppressiveness are largely 
coextens
ive with its claims that the Subpoena is overbroad and 
unconstitutional. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
10 
  argues that because the circuit court significantly narrowed the 
Subpoena’s scope during litigation, KAHEA has no basis for 
claiming that the circuit court’s decision not to quash the 
entire Subpoena was arbitrary.  
Third, KAHEA argues that the Subpoena is unconstitutional.  
KAHEA advances two distinct theories regarding the Subpoena’s 
unconstitutionality.  First, KAHEA describes the Subpoena as a 
“significant encroachment upon the constitutional rights of KAHEA and its members.”  It suggests the Subpoena is only valid 
if it survives strict scrutiny, the standard of review used in 
evaluating content-based speech restrictions.  Second, KAHEA 
asserts that the Subpoena - even if otherwise lawful - is still 
unconstitutional because it was motivated by the State AG’s 
retaliatory animus towards KAHEA.
9  KAHEA identifies three 
circumstances it says show that retaliatory intent motivated the Attorney General’s issuance of the Subpoena. 
                         
9 Various other constitutional arguments are either cursorily gestured 
towards in KAHEA’s briefing or advanced exclusively by amici curiae.  KAHEA 
has not articulated any cognizable legal arguments about its members’ First 
Amendment associational rights or about it or its members’ rights under article I, sections 4 , 6, or 7 of our state constitution.  We therefore limit 
our constitutional analysis to KAHEA’s First Amendment retaliation claim.  
See Kahoʻohanohano  v. Dep’ t of Hum. Servs., State of Haw., 117 Hawaiʻ i 262, 
297 n.37, 178 P.3d 538, 573 n.37 (2008) (cleaned up) (stating that this c ourt 
will “disregard a particular contention if the appellant makes no discernible 
argument in support of that position”).   See also Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(7) (2007) (“Points not argued may be deemed 
waived.”); Zango, Inc. v. Kaspersky Lab, Inc., 568 F.3d 1169, 1177 n.8 (9th 
Cir. 2009) (“An amicus curiae generally cannot raise new arguments on appeal 
and arguments not raised by a party in an opening brief are waived.” 
(citation omitted)).    
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
11 
  First, KAHEA points to its adversarial relationship with 
the State.  It says it has engaged in sustained advocacy in 
opposition to “the State’s facilitation of a foreign 
corporation’s development of the Thirty Meter Telescope on 
Public Lands on Mauna Kea.”  It also states it was adverse to a 
party represented by the Attorney General in two appeals before 
this court. 
Second, KAHEA mentions that the State AG issued 
investigative subpoenas to Hawaiian Airlines and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs.  KAHEA says these subpoenas sought documents 
about support for, or supporters of, the protests on Mauna Kea.  
It suggests that the Hawaiian Airlines and OHA subpoenas show 
the Subpoena comprises part of a larger harassment campaign 
targeting those who oppose development on Mauna Kea. 
Third, KAHEA implies that the Subpoena’s overbreadth 
signals that the State AG retaliated against KAHEA for its 
advocacy.  The circuit court disallowed half of the Subpoena’s initial requests.  It then narrowed the Subpoena’s sweep to 
accounts related to the Aloha ʻ Āina Fund.  The court also 
rejected the Attorney General’s claim that it needed to 
investigate KAHEA’s failure to satisfy state financial reporting 
requirements.  KAHEA’s briefing insinuates that the Subpoena’s 
wide-ranging demands show it was not issued to further a 
legitimate investigation. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
12 
  KAHEA also claims that the Subpoena will “chill” it and its 
members’ protected speech. 
The State AG contests each element of KAHEA’s First 
Amendment retaliation claim.  Responding to KAHEA’s position 
that the group’s advocacy is constitutionally protected, the 
Attorney General proclaims that “[a] blockade of a public road, 
no matter for what purpose, is not a constitutionally protected 
activity.”  The State AG also rejects the premise that a single subpoena could chill expressive rights.  Finally, the State AG 
contends that the record contains “no evidence” whatsoever that 
the State AG has retaliated against KAHEA for its anti-TMT 
advocacy.   
II. DISCUSSION 
A. The Attorney General had authority to issue the Subpoena
under HRS § 28-2.5  
 
HRS § 28-2.5(a) provides that the Attorney General “shall 
investigate alleged violations of the law . . . when the 
attorney general determines that an investigation would be in 
the public interest.”  Under subsection (b) of the same statute, 
the Attorney General may, when conducting an administrative 
investigation, subpoena witnesses and require the production of books, papers, documents or other records which are “relevant or 
material to the investigation.”
10   
                         
10 For the reasons discussed in section II(B), the documents sought by 
Subpoena requests numbers five and eight are likely neither relevant nor 13 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The Attorney General’s subpoena power under this statute is 
broad.  But it is not unbounded.  It is hemmed by the 
constitution and the safeguards of the statute itself.   HRS 
§ 28-2.5(a), however, does not check the Attorney General’s  
discretion to determine when an investigation is “in the public  
interest.”  Nor does it require that an “allegation” of unlawful  
conduct be sufficiently serious or credible before it may be  
investigated.  A subpoena may always be challenged on state or  
federal constitutional grounds.  And parties who feel compliance  
with a subpoena would be unreasonable or oppressive may move to  
quash or modify it under HRS § 28-2.5(e).  But they cannot  
second-guess the Attorney General’s discretion under HRS § 28-
2.5(a).11
KAHEA’s claims that the State AG’s investigation is “not in 
the public interest” are unconvincing.  The Attorney General has 
a duty to “represent the public interest in the protection of 
charitable assets . . . .”  See HRS § 28-5.2(a).  The 
material to the State AG’s investigation.  Because KAHEA does not make a 
discrete statutory argument under HRS § 28-2.5(b), and because we hold that 
compliance with Subpoena request numbers five and eight would be unreasonable 
under HRS § 28-2.5(e), we decline to consider whether the State AG exceeded 
its statutory authority under HRS § 28-2.5(b) by seeking documents which were 
neither relevant nor material to its investigation. 
11In addition to HRS § 28-2.5(e), which authorizes the court to quash or 
modify a subpoena if compliance with it would be “unreasonable or oppressive 
or violate any privilege the witness may be entitled to exercise in a court 
proceeding,” the
 statute contains procedural safeguards.  For example, 
subpoenas issued under HRS § 28-2.5 must “contain a short, plain statement of 
the recipient’s rights and the procedure for enforcing and contesting the subpoena.”  HRS § 28-2.5(c)(4). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
14 
  legislature has expressly authorized the State AG to use HRS 
§ 28-2.5’s subpoena power to advance this goal.  See HRS § 28-
5.2(b).  The determination of whether an investigation is “in 
the public interest” rests squarely with the Attorney General.  
Not with KAHEA.  And not with this court.12   
We conclude that the Attorney General did not exceed its 
authority under HRS § 28-2.5 in issuing the Subpoena. B. The Subpoena’s requests seeking information concerning 
monies going into the Fund are unreasonable  
 
The Attorney General’s discretion under HRS § 28-2.5(a) is 
counterbalanced by courts’ powers under HRS § 28-2.5(e).  This 
subsection gives trial courts leeway to hew unreasonable or 
oppressive subpoenas - with a battle ax, scalpel, or butter 
knife - as justice so requires.  The circuit court in this case was an effective first line of defense against governmental 
overreach: it disallowed nine of the Subpoena’s eighteen 
requests and limited its scope to accounts related to the Aloha 
ʻĀina Fund. 
                         
12 The decision to launch an investigation, or issue a subpoena buoying an 
investigation, is, like a prosecutor’s decision to prosecute or not prosecute 
a charge, ill- suited to judicial review.  See Wayte v. United States, 470 
U.S. 598, 607 (1985) (observing that “[s]uch factors as the strength of the 
case, the prosecution’s general deterrence value, the Government’s 
enforcement priorities, and the case’s relationship to the Government’ s 
overall enforcement plan are not readily susceptible to the kind of analysis 
the courts are competent to undertake”).   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
15 
  KAHEA argues the circuit court should have gone further and 
fully quashed the Subpoena because compliance with it would be 
unreasonable and oppressive. 
There is nothing intrinsically unreasonable or oppressive 
about the Subpoena.  Charitable organizations in our state are 
regulated, see HRS Chapter 467B, and the Attorney General has a 
duty to “represent the public interest in the protection of charitable assets.”  See HRS 
§ 28-5.2(a).  The contours of that 
duty are partly contingent on federal law: Hawai‘ i’s definition 
of a “charitable organization” expressly relies on the 
501(c)(3)-eligibility determination.  See HRS § 467B-1(1) 
(defining “charitable organization” as “[a] ny person determined 
by the Internal Revenue Service to be a tax-exempt organization 
pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the [IRC]”).   
KAHEA’s eligibility for 501(c)(3) status falls within the 
State AG’s purview.  So the AG’s call to investigate the 
potential effects of KAHEA’s support for anti-TMT “direct 
action” on that eligibility is entitled to deference.   
Still, Subpoena request numbers five and eight are 
unreasonable.  These requests are for deposit tickets and credit memos.  They concern monies going into, rather than coming out 
of the Fund.  But the Attorney General’s investigation concerns 
money going out of the Aloha ʻ Āina fund, not into it.  These 
requests are therefore unreasonable.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
16 
  At a hearing on KAHEA’s motion to quash, the deputy 
attorney general said that reviewing deposit tickets associated 
with KAHEA’s bank accounts would allow the State AG to 
distinguish charitable donations to KAHEA from other income 
going into KAHEA’s accounts.  This differentiation mattered, the 
deputy attorney general represented, because the government’s 
investigation was focused on the misuse of charitable donations.  
This explanation doesn’t make sense. 
The State AG’s investigation is not about the “misuse” of 
charitable funds per se but rather about whether KAHEA is improperly claiming 501(c)(3) tax exempt status while advancing 
an illegal purpose.
13  Where KAHEA gets its money does not matter 
when the inquiry involves whether KAHEA has used the Fund to advance an illegal purpose.  And knowing who gave how much to 
the Aloha ʻ Āina Fund will not help the State AG determine whether 
KAHEA has an “illegal purpose.”  Money is fungible: even if none 
of the Fund’s assets came from charitable donations, the State 
AG could still claim that KAHEA’s purpose was not exclusively 
charitable if KAHEA used any of its assets to advance “illegal” aims. 
                         
13 Since the circuit court did not issue the Subpoena on the basis of the 
Attorney General’s investigation into KAHEA’s delinquency in filing its 
financial reports and concomitant alleged improper solicitation of donations, 
our analysis focuses on the Attorney General’s investigation into whether 
KAHEA has an illegal purpose and is, by extension, improperly claiming 
501(c)(3) status. 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
17 
  Because the source of KAHEA’s funds is irrelevant to the 
State AG’s investigation, the circuit court’s denial of KAHEA’s 
motion to quash regarding request numbers five and eight was 
plainly arbitrary and unsupported by the record.  
But the record does not support KAHEA’s contention that 
request numbers one, six, seven, nine, twelve, thirteen, and 
fourteen are unreasonable.  Each of these requests seeks records 
which are, or could be, relevant and material to the State AG’s investigation.  Therefore, the circuit court’s decision to allow 
these requests was not plainly arbitrary or unsupported by the 
record.  See Powers v. Shaw, 1 Haw. App. 374, 376, 619 P.2d 
1098, 1101 (1980) (“On review, the action of a trial court in enforcing or quashing the subpoena will be disturbed only if 
plainly arbitrary and without support in the record.”). 
C. KAHEA’s constitutional arguments 
 
1. The Subpoena does not unconstitutionally burden 
KAHEA’s First Amendment rights 
 KAHEA’s position that the Subpoena unconstitutionally 
encroaches on its First Amendment free speech rights lacks 
merit.  
KAHEA’s First Amendment argument incorrectly treats the 
Subpoena – which was issued as part of an investigation launchedin response to KAHEA’s advocacy – as legally equivalent to a law
proscribing or punishing KAHEA’s advocacy.  KAHEA argues that  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
18 
  the Subpoena is unconstitutional because the government could 
not constitutionally ban KAHEA from, or punish it for, 
supporting non-violent direct actions on Mauna Kea.   But the 
Subpoena is not a law censoring or forbidding KAHEA’s advocacy.And here, through the Subpoena, the State AG is not seeking to 
hold KAHEA criminally liable because it supports direct action 
on Mauna Kea.  This is why KAHEA’s reliance on NAACP v. Button,14
  
 
                         
14 Much of KAHEA’s First Amendment argumentation is best understood as a 
preview of constitutional arguments KAHEA could advance if the State were to 
try and punish KAHEA for bankrolling civil disobedience on Mauna Kea.  But 
KAHEA is wrong to suggest that the existence of potential constitutional 
defenses to any charges or claims that may arise from the State AG’s 
investigation make the investigation unconstitutional (or illegitimate or 
unreasonable). 
KAHEA’s reasoning implicitly asks us to adopt something akin to a 
“likelihood of success on the merits” requirement whereby administrative 
subpoenas are only constitutional (or legitimate under HRS § 28-2.5(a) or 
“reasonable” under HRS § 28-2.5(e)) when they are issued during 
investigations that the court believes will give rise to charges or claims 
for which the defendant will not have a valid constitutional defense.  This 
approach is unsupported by the law and would represent a significant and 
inappropriate encroachment on the Attorney General’s powers of inquisition.

  371 U.S. 415 (1963), is misplaced.,1615 
In Button, the Supreme Court considered the 
                         
15 KAHEA’s reliance on NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886 
(1982), is also misplaced.  In Claiborne, the Court considered whether the 
NAACP could be held civilly liable for damages suffered by merchants as a 
result of a boycott that, though largely nonviolent, had included some acts 
of violence.  The court held that the NAACP could not be held liable for damage caused by boycotters’ acts of violence because there was “no evidence 
that the NAACP ratifieds [sic] or even had specific knowledge of— any of the 
acts of violence or threats of discipline associated with the boycott.”  Id. 
at 930-31.  In a footnote, the Court observed that the NAACP “had posted bond 
and provided legal representation for arrested boycott violators.”   Id. at 
931 n.78.  But this conduct, the Court said, did not “support a determination 
that the national organization was aware of, and ratified, unauthorized 
violent conduct” because the NAACP “regularly provides such assistance to 
indigent black persons throughout the country.”  Id. 
KAHEA argues that because the NAACP’s posting of bail for arrested 
boycotters could not support a finding that the NAACP ratified violent 
boycotters’ conduct, KAHEA’s “posting of bond” and “providing of legal representation for those arrested [on Mauna Kea] could not be a basis for the 
circuit court to allow for the production of bank and financial records of 
KAHEA’s Aloha ʻ Aina account held at the First Hawaiian Bank.” 
As a preliminary matter, Claiborne is inapplicable because the State AG 
doesn’t seek to hold KAHEA liable for damages arising out of the arrests on 
Mauna Kea.  The limits on exposure to civil liability for the acts of another 
discussed in Claiborne are irrelevant to the questions this case presents 
about the scope of the State AG’s investigatory powers and the legality of 
their exercise. 
Claiborne is also distinguishable from this case because the record 
here provides ample evidence that KAHEA knew about, financially supported, 
and ratified “direct action” on Mauna Kea.  Whereas the NAACP “supplied no 
financial aid to the boycott,” KAHEA established the Fund with the express 
purpose of financially supporting “direct action” on Mauna Kea.  Moreover, 
the Supreme Court says that the NAACP’s support for arrested boycotters was 
not evidence of its support for, or ratification of, boycotters’ violent acts 
because the NAACP “regularly provides [bond and legal] assistance to indigent black persons throughout the country.”  The record here does not suggest 
KAHEA regularly provides bail support to indigent persons throughout the 
country or state.  To the contrary, the record suggests that KAHEA provided bail support for arrested protestors as part of a targeted campaign 
supporting “direct action” on Mauna Kea. 
  
16 NAACP v. State of Ala. ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449 (1958), is also 
distinguishable.  That case – like the Supreme Court’s recently decided 
Americans for Prosperity Found. v. Bonta, ___ U.S. ___, 141 S. Ct. 2373 
(2021) — concerned First Amendment association rights.  Since KAHEA failed to 
adequately advance any First Amendment freedom of association claims on 
behalf of its members, see supra n.9 , Patterson and Americans for Prosperity  
are inapplicable.   We express no opinion about the viability of any First 
Amendment freedom of association claims KAHEA could have asserted on behalf 
of its members.

  constitutionality of a Virginia law that made it a crime for the 
plaintiff, the NAACP, to hold meetings where it invited 
prospective litigants to sign documents authorizing NAACP 
lawyers to represent them.  The Supreme Court held that 
Virginia’s law was an unconstitional imposition on the NAACP’s 
First Amendment rights as absorbed by the Fourteenth Amendment. 
Unlike the Virginia statute at issue in Button, the 
Subpoena is not a law.  It does not forbid or proscribe KAHEA from doing, saying, funding, or supporting anything.  KAHEA’s 
arguments miss the critical point that a governmental 
investigation triggered in response to constitutionally-
protected speech is not the same thing as a law criminalizing 
that speech.  Any burden on KAHEA’s speech here is purely 
incidental. 
We conclude that the Subpoena is not an inherently 
unconstitutional imposition on KAHEA’s First Amendment freedom 
of speech rights. 
2. The record does not support KAHEA’s First Amendment
retaliation claim  
 
Even an otherwise lawful governmental action may be 
unconstitutional if it is initiated in retaliation for speech or 
conduct covered by the First Amendment.  See Hartman v. Moore, 
547 U.S. 250, 256 (2006) (“[T]he law is settled that as a 
general matter the First Amendment prohibits government *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
21 officials from subjecting an individual to retaliatory 
actions . . . for speaking out.”).  
A plaintiff bringing a First Amendment retaliation claim 
must show that: “(1) [they were] engaged in a constitutionally 
protected activity, (2) the defendant’s actions would chill a 
person of ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in the 
protected activity and (3) the protected activity was a 
substantial or motivating factor in the defendant’s conduct.”  O’Brien v. Welty, 818 F.3d 920, 932 (9th Cir. 2016).
17  If this 
showing is made, the burden shifts to the government to “show by a preponderance of the evidence” that it would have taken the 
same action “even in the absence of the protected conduct.”  See  
Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 
287 (1977). 
KAHEA’s opposition to development on Mauna Kea falls 
squarely within the heartland of the First Amendment’s 
protections.   
We also agree with KAHEA that the prospect of an 
administrative subpoena seeking extensive banking records is an  
17O’Brien concerns a First Amendment retaliation action under 42 U.S.C. 
§1983, not a motion to quash an administrative subpoena on constitutional
grounds.  Both parties agree that O’Brien states the constitutional standard
that controls the analysis of KAHEA’s First Amendment claim.*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
22 adverse action that would chill a person of ordinary firmness 
from exercising First Amendment rights.  18
But KAHEA’s First Amendment retaliation claim nonetheless 
fails because KAHEA has not shown that retaliatory animus was a 
substantial or motivating factor in the Subpoena’s issuance. 
We recognize that, in some cases, the government’s 
explanation for an action may be so at odds with controlling law that it is, itself, evidence of pretext and retaliatory animus.  But that is not the case here.  The State AG’s investigation is 
premised on the notion that KAHEA’s financial support for direct 
action opposing development on Mauna Kea may disqualify it from 
501(c)(3) status.  Nothing about this premise contradicts or 
runs counter to First Amendment principles. 
The federal tax exemption for charitable organizations is 
effectively a taxpayer-funded subsidy for organizations that 
serve some public benefit.  As the Supreme Court explained in 
18The State AG’s argument that the Subpoena would not “chill a person of 
reasonable firmness” relies on the distinguishable Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1 
(1972), case.  There, the Supreme Court considered whether the Army’s 
surveillance of public meetings and publications that were thought to have 
some connection to civil disorder infringed on the constitutional rights of 
those surveilled.  The Supreme Court concluded that no “chilling effect” 
arose from “knowledge that a governmental agency was engaged in certain activities or from the individual’s concomitant fear that, armed with the 
fruits of those activities, the agency might in the future take some other 
and additionl [sic] action detrimental to that individual.”  Id. at 11.  
Significantly, the C ourt in Laird distinguished the exercise of government 
power at issue in that case from those that were “compulsory” in nature.  Id.  
Administrative subpoenas like the one the State AG issued First Hawaiian Bank 
are “compulsory” in nature because they leverage state power to compel the 
production of documents or testimony. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
23 
  Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 574 (1983): 
When the Government grants exemptions or allows deductions 
all taxpayers are affected; the very fact of the exemption or deduction for the donor means that other taxpayers can 
be said to be indirect and vicarious “donors.”  Charitable 
exemptions are justified on the basis that the exempt entity confers a public benefit . . . . 
 
Id. at 591.  One corollary of the “public benefit principle” is 
that to qualify for the exemption, an organization must have a 
charitable purpose “‘consistent with local laws and public 
policy’.” Id. (quoting Perin v. Carey, 65 U.S. 465, 501 
(1861)).  See also id. at 592 (“[T]o warrant exemption under 
§ 501(c)(3), an institution . . . must demonstrably serve and be in harmony with the public interest.”). 
 The State AG’s characterization of its investigation as probing whether KAHEA has “an illegal purpose” is thus 
misleading because its use of the word “illegal” suggests as a 
necessary premise some unlawfulness on KAHEA’s part.  To the 
contrary, KAHEA’s advocacy could be totally legal and still 
jeopardize its eligibility for 501(c)(3) status. 
The State AG has represented that it is not investigating 
whether KAHEA has done anything illegal; it is investigating whether KAHEA serves a public benefit such that all U.S. 
taxpayers – a group that may include supporters of development 
on Mauna Kea – ought to be KAHEA’s “vicarious donors.”  KAHEA 
could have an “illegal purpose” without having done anything 
illegal.  As such – and given IRS Revenue Ruling 75-384 and the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
24 
  record here – the notion that KAHEA’s support for “direct 
action” on Mauna Kea might impact its eligibility for § 
501(c)(3) status is not so unsound that it betrays retaliatory
animus.19 
 
KAHEA’s arguments concerning its adversarial relationship 
with the State AG are slightly more persuasive: KAHEA’s anti-TMT 
advocacy and opposition to the State AG’s client in appeals 
before this court show that the State AG may have had a motive for targeting KAHEA.  But that is very different from showing 
that retaliatory animus – rather than legitimate nonretaliatory 
reasons – motivated the Subpoena’s issuance. 
The strongest “evidence” linking the Subpoena to the 
retaliatory intent KAHEA alleges is the Subpoena’s overbreadth.  
Many of the eighteen categories of requested records the 
Subpoena initially sought have no apparent connection to the 
Attorney General’s investigation.  The “delta” between what 
would be reasonable given the investigation’s stated aims and what was actually sought by the Subpoena may hint that 
                         
19 Though Revenue Ruling 75- 384 is more than forty years old, the IRS 
continues to rely on it in private letter rulings.  For example, in 2019, the 
IRS cited Revenue Ruling 75- 384 in a private letter ruling concerning an 
organization formed to aid financially disadvantaged patients affected by the 
costs of THC and CBD (cannabidiol) treatment.  The organization assisted 
these patients “by providing financial support to cover costs of living and 
other expenses . . . . ”  I.R.S. P.L.R. 201917008 (Apr. 26, 2019).  The IRS 
concluded that because cannabis was illegal under federal law, and because 
the organization was formed to provide financial assistance to cannabis users, the organization had an “illegal purpose” and could not be recognized 
as exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Id. 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
25 
  retaliatory animus animated the Subpoena’s issuance.  But 
overbroad subpoenas are unremarkable.  And while the 
unreasonableness of the Subpoena may “tend to” show that 
retaliation motivated the Subpoena, it is not dispositive on 
this point. 
While KAHEA’s briefing provides some fodder for speculation 
about the Attorney General’s motives in issuing the Subpoena, 
KAHEA has not demonstrated that retaliation was a substantial or motivating factor behind the Subpoena.  The Subpoena is 
justified on nonretaliatory grounds.  
See supra section II(A).  
And the State AG’s stated rationale for investigating KAHEA is consistent with the Attorney General’s obligation to “represent 
the public interest in the protection of charitable 
assets . . . .”  See HRS § 28-5.2(a).  Given these facts and the 
record before us, KAHEA has not shown that retaliatory animus was a substantial or motivating factor in the Subpoena’s 
issuance.  KAHEA’s First Amendment retaliation claim thus fails.
20 
3. KAHEA has not preserved any arguments under article I, 
section 4 of the Hawai‘ i Constitution 
 
Article I, section 4 of the Hawai‘ i Constitution reads: “No 
law shall be enacted respecting an establishment of religion, or 
                         
20 Like the Supreme Court in Laird, we reach this conclusion without 
intimating any “view with respect to the propriety or desirability, from a 
policy standpoint, of the challenged activities of the [State AG].”  See 408 
U.S. at 15. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
26 
  prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom 
of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably 
to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of 
grievances.”   
This court generously interprets the civil rights bestowed 
by the Hawaiʻ i Constitution.  We have held that article I, 
section 4 provides free speech rights “at least as expansive as 
those provided by the United States Constitution.”  State v. 
Russo, 141 Hawai‘ i 181, 190, 407 P.3d 137, 146 (2017) (emphasis 
added).  See also id. (recognizing that the Hawai‘ i Constitution 
affords “greater free speech protection than its federal counterpart”) (quoting Crosby v. State Dep’t of Budget & Fin., 
76 Hawai‘ i 332, 339 n.9, 876 P.2d 1300, 1307 n.9 (1994)); Oahu 
Publ’ns Inc. v. Ahn, 133 Hawai‘i 482, 494, 331 P.3d 460, 472 
(2014). 
Though KAHEA’s opening brief recognizes that article I, 
section 4 provides free speech rights “at least as expansive as those provided by the United States Constitution,” KAHEA has not 
advanced any precise arguments concerning it or its donors’ 
article I, section 4 rights.  The State AG, in turn, did not 
address article I, section 4 at all in its answering brief.  
Likewise, though KAHEA name checked article I, section 4 at the 
February 7, 2020 hearing before the circuit court, it did not 
make any discrete legal arguments concerning article I, section *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
27 4 before the circuit court.  
Hence, KAHEA has not made any discernible arguments under 
article I, section 4.  Any arguments it could have made under 
this provision are waived.  See Kahoʻ ohanohano, 117 Hawaiʻ i at 
297 n.37, 178 P.3d at 573 n.37.   
III. CONCLUSION
The circuit court’s February 26, 2020 order granting in 
part and denying in part KAHEA’s motion to quash the Subpoena is 
reversed with respect to Subpoena request numbers five and 
eight.  It is affirmed in all other respects.  The case is 
remanded to the circuit court for proceedings consistent with 
this opinion.
