OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J.  
Ordinarily police officers must get a warrant before 
entering a home without permission.  But when exigent 
circumstances arise, and the police have probable cause to 
arrest or search, our state and federal constitutions allow 
warrantless home entries.   Electronically Filed

Dkt. 11 OP*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 2 The State invokes this “exigent circumstances” exception to 
justify a warrantless home entry into Erik Willis’s residence.  
It advances an expansive view on what creates an “exigency”: it 
argues a crime’s random and violent nature alone can pose 
exigent circumstances validating a warrantless home intrusion.     
We hold that the gravity of the crime, by itself, does not 
establish an exigency empowering law enforcement officers to 
bypass the warrant requirement.  To support a warrantless home intrusion under the exigency exception, the State must 
articulate objective facts showing an immediate law enforcement 
need for the entry.  Those facts must be independent of the 
underlying offense’s grave nature.  And they must be present 
when the police enter the home.               
I. 
Honolulu Police Department officers entered Willis’s home 
to arrest him.  They did not have permission or a warrant.  The police had probable cause to believe that three days earlier, Willis had repeatedly stabbed a teenager without provocation at 
a Kahala area beach.  The evidence supporting probable cause 
included several security videos showing a person of interest.  
One HPD officer identified Willis as the person in the videos.  
This officer knew Willis and where he lived; the officer had 
previously interacted with him as a “mentor.”
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 3  After surveilling Willis for a day and a half, the police 
made a warrantless entry into his home.
  Inside the home, the 
police happened to see shoes and a shirt that matched the suspect’s footwear and upper garment.  The police arrested 
Willis.  While detained at home, Willis asked the officers about 
getting his shirt from his family’s washing machine.  About two 
hours later, still without a warrant, the police recovered the 
shoes and shirt.  A grand jury indicted Willis for attempted murder in the 
second degree.  
Willis moved to suppress the shoes, the shirt, and the 
statements he made when he was arrested.  
Circuit Court of the First Circuit Judge Kevin A. Souza 
granted the motion.  The court found that the police lacked 
exigent circumstances to enter Willis’s residence without a 
warrant.  It reasoned that Willis had been under surveillance 
for a day and a half before his arrest.  The court underscored that there was “no evidence [that Willis] was armed, or that he 
was actively attempting to flee the jurisdiction.”  
Because the police unlawfully entered Willis’s home, the 
court rejected the State’s argument that the police validly 
seized the shoes and shirt under the plain view doctrine.  As 
fruits of the illegal entry, the court suppressed the shoes, 
shirt, and statements.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 4 The State appealed.  We accepted its application for 
transfer.  
The State does not contest the court’s factual 
findings.  It also does not challenge the court’s determination 
that no one consented to the home entry.  Instead, the State 
limits its appeal to the court’s legal conclusions regarding the 
exigency exception, the plain view seizure, the fruit of the 
poisonous tree doctrine, and the resulting suppression of the 
evidence.  
The State focuses on rebutting the court’s finding of no 
exigency.  Willis’s “random, unprovoked stabbing of a woman lying on the beach,” the State argues, yielded an exigent 
circumstance that validated the home entry.  The State 
highlights the “stranger-danger” nature of the attack.  It 
credits an HPD detective’s testimony that Willis presented “a 
different risk” because he had randomly and violently attacked a 
person without apparent motive.  Because the police feared 
Willis “might attack again randomly,” the State claims, they couldn’t devote the six or more hours they said they needed to 
write an affidavit and then get a warrant.  
The State also alludes to three facts related to Willis’s 
purported danger.  It mentions a “past instance[] of 
biting . . . a paramedic who was trying to help him.”  It also 
says that some surveillance videos showed Willis “trespassing,” 
“suspiciously looking into somebody else’s garage,” and “looking *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 5 around, prowling around.”  The State further notes that the 
knife used in the attack was never recovered; so, it claims, the 
police had a reason to believe Willis was armed.  
Willis defends the court’s order granting his motion to 
suppress.  He argues the State cannot justify a warrantless home 
entry solely on the basis that a suspect “attacked and injured 
an unknown victim for unknown reasons.”
  Willis concedes that 
the police had probable cause to arrest him.  
We agree with Willis and affirm the court’s ruling.   
II. 
 There’s no place like home when it comes to the Fourth 
Amendment and article I, section 7 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution.  
The Fourth Amendment guarantees that “[t]he right of the people 
to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, 
against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be 
violated[.]”  U.S. Const. amend. IV (emphasis added).  This 
clause matches article I, section 7, except for our 
constitution’s added protection against unreasonable “invasions 
of privacy.”  Haw. Const. art. I, § 7.   
“House” is the only location mentioned in both 
constitutional provisions.  In the context of searches and 
seizures, “the home is first among equals.”  Florida v. 
Jardines, 569 U.S. 1, 6 (2013); see also Payton v. New York, 445 
U.S. 573, 585 (1980) (observing that the “physical entry of the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 6 home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth 
Amendment is directed” (citation omitted)); Cf. State v. Line, 
121 Hawaiʻi 74, 85, 214 P.3d 613, 624 (2009) (recognizing “the 
special privacy interest in the home”).   
If the government has probable cause, it can ordinarily 
arrest someone without a warrant in a public place for a felony 
or misdemeanor crime.  See generally Atwater v. City of Lago 
Vista, 532 U.S. 318, 340, n.11, 354 (2001); United States v. 
Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 423-24 (1976).   
But going into a person’s home to make an arrest is 
different.  Police officers must get a warrant before entering a 
dwelling unless an exception applies.  Lange v. California, __ 
U.S. __, 141 S. Ct. 2011, 2017 (2021); Line, 121 Hawaiʻ i at 86, 
214 P.3d at 625.  A warrantless entry into a home is “presumptively unreasonable.”  Payton, 445 U.S. at 586; State v. 
Pulse, 83 Hawaiʻ i 229, 245, 925 P.2d 797, 813 (1996).  
The only way to validate a warrantless and nonconsensual 
home entry is to show “exigent circumstances.”  See Line, 121 
Hawaiʻi at 77, 85, 214 P.3d at 616, 624 (recognizing in a case 
where the police entered a home without consent or a warrant that “any warrantless entrance of a private dwelling by the 
police can only be justified under the exigent circumstances 
exceptions to the warrant requirement” (cleaned up)); State v. 
Lloyd, 61 Haw. 505, 510–11, 606 P.2d 913, 917 (1980) (per *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 7 curiam) (holding that “under both Federal and Hawaii 
Constitutions, law enforcement officers may not enter the home 
of a suspect to effect his arrest, without his consent or 
without prior judicial authorization, in the absence of exigent 
circumstances”).  
The police must have probable cause to arrest or search.  
See Pulse, 83 
Hawaiʻi at 245, 925 P.2d at 813 (explaining that 
one “well-recognized and narrowly-defined exception to the warrant requirement occurs when the government has probable 
cause to search and exigent circumstances exist necessitating 
immediate police action” (emphasis added) (cleaned up)).  But, “no amount of probable cause can justify a warrantless search or seizure absent exigent circumstances or some other recognized 
exception to the warrant requirement.”  State v. Bonnell, 75 
Haw. 124, 137–38, 856 P.2d 1265, 1273 (1993) (cleaned up).   
Immediacy shapes exigency.  Exigent circumstances exist 
“when the demands of the occasion reasonably call for an 
immediate police response.”  State v. Jenkins, 93 Hawaiʻ i 87, 
102, 997 P.2d 13, 28 (2000) (citations omitted).  The exigency 
exception thus permits law enforcement officers to respond to 
“now or never” situations with “no time to secure a warrant.”  
Lange, __ U.S. at __, 141 S. Ct. at 2018 (citations omitted).   
Exigent circumstances emerge “where there is an imminent 
threat of harm to a person, where there is a danger of serious *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 8 property damage, where a suspect is likely to escape, or where 
evidence is likely to be removed or destroyed.”  State v. 
Naeole, 148 Hawaiʻi 243, 250, 470 P.3d 1120, 1127 (2020).  
An exigency is determined based on the totality of the 
circumstances.  Lange, __ U.S. at __, 141 S. Ct. at 2018; 
Jenkins, 93 Hawaiʻ i at 102, 997 P.2d at 28.  It must have existed 
at the time of the warrantless search or seizure.  See State v. 
Dorson, 62 Haw. 377, 385, 615 P.2d 740, 746 (1980) (explaining 
that “an exigency must be shown by the State to have existed at 
the time of the entry” (emphasis added)).   
The State must prove exigency; it must identify “specific 
and articulable facts” showing why the police had to act without 
delay.  Pulse, 83 Hawaiʻ i at 245, 925 P.2d at 813 (citation 
omitted).   
Here, the State insists that exigent circumstances existed 
because Willis posed an “imminent danger to the public.”  
Willis’s “random, unprovoked stabbing of a woman lying on the 
beach,” the State argues, made him dangerous.  The State says that given the “stranger-danger” nature of the crime, the police 
couldn’t wait for a warrant.  The State also mentions that: 
Willis had previously bit a paramedic who tried to help him; 
some surveillance videos showed Willis suspiciously looking 
around on the day of the stabbing; and the police hadn’t 
recovered the knife used in the attack.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 9 That’s it.  The State does not point to any other facts 
demanding an immediate police intervention.  What it articulates 
does not validate the HPD officers’ warrantless entry into 
Willis’s home.   
First, the State’s reliance on the stabbing’s violent and 
random nature fails.  The State does not identify any case that 
held the grave or violent nature of the underlying offense alone 
can justify a warrantless search or seizure within one’s home.  And we are unaware of any case supporting that proposition.   
Rather, the gravity of the crime standing alone cannot 
establish exigent circumstances.  See, e.g., Welsh v. Wisconsin, 
466 U.S. 740, 752 (1984) (recognizing that “courts have permitted warrantless home arrests for major felonies if 
identifiable exigencies, independent of the gravity of the 
offense, existed at the time of the arrest” (emphasis added)); 
Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 394 (1978) (declining “to hold 
that the seriousness of the offense under investigation itself 
creates exigent circumstances of the kind that under the Fourth 
Amendment justify a warrantless search”).  
This approach makes sense.  If the underlying offense’s 
troubling nature alone can create exigent circumstances as the 
State suggests, all “stranger-danger” and violent assault cases 
would meet the exigency exception.  The expansive reach of the 
State’s position dooms it.  Caniglia v. Strom, __ U.S. __, 141 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 10 S. Ct. 1596, 1600 (2021) (emphasizing that the Court “has 
repeatedly declined to expand the scope of exceptions to the 
warrant requirement to permit warrantless entry into the home”
 
(cleaned up)).   
We hold that the gravity of the underlying crime, by 
itself, cannot supply exigent circumstances validating warrantless home intrusions.     
Second, beyond the stabbing’s “stranger-danger” nature, the 
record doesn’t show anything more about the threat Willis posed to the public at the time of his arrest.  It in fact undercuts 
the State’s claim that an immediate police action was necessary.   
The police had been watching Willis for a day and a half 
before deciding to make a warrantless arrest.  This surveillance 
seemingly did not reveal any information indicating that Willis 
would attack someone again.  The officers knew Willis’s identity 
and where he lived.  They had no evidence that Willis was armed.    
They also didn’t have any evidence that Willis was attempting to flee.  
The State’s secondary points – the past biting incident, 
the video footage of Willis “looking around,” and the 
unrecovered knife used in the stabbing - do not show an 
immediate need to arrest Willis without a warrant either.  The 
record also belies the State’s reliance on these facts.  One 
officer conceded that the crime’s gravity was the sole reason *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 11 for the warrantless arrest.  The officer said the circumstances 
of the stabbing in and of themselves rendered Willis dangerous.  
  
He testified “[t]here [were] no additional facts” suggesting that Willis was “armed and dangerous.”  
The record only shows the officers’ subjective inkling that 
Willis might randomly attack someone because he was accused of 
randomly attacking someone.  The officers’ subjective reasoning 
alone cannot empower them to bypass the constitutional warrant requirement for home intrusions.  See State v. Dias, 62 Haw. 52, 
56–57, 609 P.2d 637, 640 (1980) (explaining that “the justification for the warrantless entry must rest on more than 
[police officers’] subjective belief . . .”); see also McDonald 
v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 460 (1948) (Jackson, J., 
concurring) (“When an officer undertakes to act as his own 
magistrate, he ought to be in a position to justify it by 
pointing to some real immediate and serious consequence if [the 
officer] postponed action to get a warrant.” (Emphasis added)).   
To support a warrantless home entry under the exigency 
exception, the State must point to specific and articulable 
facts objectively showing the immediate necessity of its action.  
Dias, 62 Haw. at 56-57, 609 P.2d at 640-41.  Those facts must be 
independent of the gravity of the underlying crime; and they must be present at the time of the entry.  Welsh, 466 U.S. at 
752.  The State failed to meet its burden.    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 12 We conclude that the police did not face a now or never 
situation permitting them to enter Willis’s home without a 
warrant.  The officers should have secured a warrant before 
intruding into his residence.  See Mitchell v. Wisconsin, __ 
U.S. __, 139 S. Ct. 2525, 2541 (2019) (Sotomayor, J. dissenting) 
(“If there is time, get a warrant.”).  
III. 
Inside Willis’s home, the police saw the footwear and shirt 
that they believed the stabbing suspect wore.  This sighting 
might have been inadvertent.  But it didn’t stem from a lawful 
police presence.  So the plain view doctrine does not validate 
the seizure of the shoes and shirt.  See State v. Meyer, 78 
Hawaiʻi 308, 317, 893 P.2d 159, 168 (1995) (requiring “a lawful 
intrusion” for the State to successfully invoke the plain view 
doctrine).  
The exclusionary rule then bars the use of the shoes and 
shirt (and any derivative evidence) at trial.  See State v. 
Weldon, 144 Hawaiʻ i 522, 534, 445 P.3d 103, 115 (2019) 
(recognizing that courts “prohibit the use of evidence at trial 
that comes to light as a result of the exploitation of a 
previous illegal act of the police”).  This rule also operates 
to exclude the statements Willis made while detained at home; 
those statements resulted from the unlawful home intrusion.     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 13 IV. 
Because the police entered Willis’s home without exigent 
circumstances, permission, or a warrant, the circuit court 
correctly suppressed the evidence and precluded its use at 
trial.  We affirm the court’s findings of fact, conclusions of 
law and order granting Willis’s motion to suppress.
