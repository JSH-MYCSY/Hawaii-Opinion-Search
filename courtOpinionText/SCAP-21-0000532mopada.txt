Circuit Judge Browning, in p lace of Eddins, J., r ecused,

This case calls upon the court to address when a 
defendant who is sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment 
is entitled to presentence detention credit .  As this court 
previously established in State v. Tauiliili , 96 Hawaiʻi 195, 29 
P.3d 914 (2001), Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) §§  706-671 and 
706-668.5 must be read together when a sentencing court imposes 
consecutive sentences upon a defendant.  In such cases , 
HRS § 706-671 does not entitle a defendant to presentence Electronically Filed

2 detention credit for each sentence  imposed.  Rather, a defendant 
is entitled to pr esentence credit only once against the 
aggregate of his consecutive sentences.   See Tauiliili , 96 
Hawaiʻi at 200, 29 P.3d at 919.  
Additionally , as this court held in State v. Vaden , 
SCWC-20-0000481 (Haw. Mar. 15,  2023), the denial of presentence 
credit for each sentence does not violate the double jeopardy 
clause so long as the sum of the presentence detention and 
sentence imposed does not exceed  the statutory maximum penalty.  
I. BACKGROUND  
On May 3, 1999, a jury convicted W ebster for  crimes 
related to firing a semi -automatic weapon into an occupied 
apartment on the night of July 1, 1997.  In particular, the jury 
convicted Webster of  one count of attempted assault in the first 
degree, in violation of HRS §§  705-5001 and 707-710;2 one count 
                     
1  HRS § 705-500 (1993) provides in relevant part:   
 
(1) A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime 
if the person:  
 
(a) Intentionally engages in conduct which would 
constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances 
were as the person believes them to be; or  
(b) Intentionally engages in conduct which, under the 
circumstances as the person believes them to be, 
constitutes a substantial step in a course of 
conduct intended to culminate in the person’s 
commission of the crime.  
2  HRS § 707-710 (1993) provides:  
 
(1) A person commits the offense of assault in the first

commission of a separate felony  (assault in the second degree ), 
in violation of HRS §§  134-6(a), (e)3 and 707-711(1)(a);4 one 
                     
(2) Assault in the first degree is a class B felony.  
3  HRS § 134-6 (1993) provides in relevant part:  
 
(a) It shall be unlawful for a person to knowingly carry 
on the person o r have within the person’s immediate control

(c) Except as provided in sections 134 -5 and 134 -9, all 
firearms and ammunition shall be confined to the 
possessor’s place of business, residence, or sojourn; 
provided that it shall be lawful to carry unloaded firearms 
or ammunition or both in an enclosed container from the 
place of purchase to the purchaser’s place of business, 
residence, or sojourn, or between these places upon change 
of place of business, residence, or sojourn, or between 
these places and the following:  a place of repair ; a target 
range; a licensed dealer’s place of business; an organized, 
scheduled firearms show or exhibit; a place of formal 
hunter or firearm use training or instruction; or a police 
station.  . . .  
 
. . . . 
 
(e) Any person violating sub section (a) or (b) shall be 
guilty of a class A felony .  Any person violating this 
section by carrying or possessing a loaded firearm or by 
carrying or possessing a loaded or unloaded pistol or 
revolver without a license issued as provided in section 
134-9 shall be guilty of a class B felony.  Any person 
violating this section by carrying or possessing an 
unloaded firearm, other than a pistol or revolver, shall be 
guilty of a class C felony.  
4  HRS § 707-711(1)(a) (1993) provides:  
 
(1)  A person commits the  offense of assault in the 
second degree if:  
 
(a)  The person intentionally or knowingly causes 
substantial bodily injury to another [.] *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
4  count of place to keep pistol or revolver, in violation of HRS 
§ 134-6(c), (e); and three counts of reckless endangering in the 
first degree, in violation of HRS §§  706-660.1(3)5 and 707-713.6    
The charges in this case are collectively referred to as the 
assault counts .7 
On September 22, 1999, Webster entered a plea 
agreement in a separate case pertaining to the August 16, 1997  
                     
5  HRS § 706-660.1(3) (1993) provides  in relevant part : 
 
(3) A person convicted of a felony, where the person had 
a semiauto matic firearm or automatic firearm in the 
person’s possession or used or threatened its use while 
engaged in the commission of the felony, whether the 
semiautomatic firearm or automatic firearm was loaded or 
not, and whether operable or not, shall in addit ion to the 
indeterminate term of imprisonment provided for the grade 
of offense be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of 
imprisonment without possibility of parole or probation the 
length of which shall be as follows:  
 
. . . . 
 
(b) For a class A felony —fifteen years;  
(c) For a class B felony —ten years; and  
(d) For a class C felony —five years.  
6  HRS § 707-713 (1993) provides:  
 
(1) A person commits the offense of reckless endangering 
in the first degree if the person employs widely dangerous 
means in a manner which recklessly places another person in 
danger of death or serious bodily injury or intentionally 
fires a firearm in a manner which recklessly places another 
person in danger of death or serious bodily injury.  
(2) Reckless endangering in the first degree is a clas s 
C felony.  
7  This court subsequently vacated Webster’s conviction and sentence for 
carrying, using, or threatening to use a firearm in the commission of a 
separate felony .  State v. Webster , 94 Hawaiʻi 241, 243, 249, 11 P.3d 466, 
468, 474 (2000).  This c ourt affirmed Webster’s convictions on all other 
counts.  Id. *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
5 death of Chih Kai Pan.  Under the terms of the agreement, 
Webster pled guilty to one count of manslaughter, in violation 
of HRS §  707-702;8 and one count of place to keep pistol or 
revolver, in violation of HRS §  134-6(c), (e) .  The charges in 
this case are collectively referred to as the homicide counts.9 
Webster also agreed for his sentencing proceedings for 
the assault and homicide counts to be heard by Judge Victoria 
Marks (the sentencing court).  
The sentencing court  conducted Webster’s sentencing 
hearing on November 18, 1999 .  The sentencing court  sentenced 
Webster for the assault counts as follows:  
Attempted assault in the first 
degree 10 years with a 10 -
year mandatory 
minimum 
Carrying, using, or 
threatening to use a firearm 
in the commission of a 
separate felony  20 years  
Place to keep pistol or 
revolver  10 years  
                     
8  HRS § 707-702 (1993 & Supp. 199 7) provides in relevant part:  
 
(1) A person commits the offense of manslaughter if:  
 
(a) He recklessly causes the death of another person; or  
(b) He intentionally causes a nother person to commit 
suicide.  
 
. . . . 
 
(3) Manslaughter is a class A felony.  
9  In exchange for Webster’s guilty plea, the State agreed to reduce one 
of the homicide counts from murder in the second degree to manslaughter and 
to nolle prosequi charges in a third case.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

first degree  5 years with a 5 -
year mandatory 
minimum 
Reckless endangering in the 
first degree  5 years with a 5 -

Reckless endangering in the 
first degree  5 years with a 5 -

The sentencing court  added that Webster’s “[t]erms  of 
incarceration imposed in this case shall run concurrently with 
each other and with credit for time served.  This sentence shall 
be served CONSECUTIVE  to the sentence imposed [for the homicide  
counts] and [Webster] shall not receive ‘double’ credit for one 
(1) period of time served.”10 
The sentencing court  sentenced Webster for the 
homicide  counts as follows:  
Manslaughter  20 years with a 5 -
year mandatory 
minimum 
Place to keep pistol or 
revolver  10 years  
 
As with the assault counts, the sentencing court  explained that 
Webster’s “[t]erms of [i]ncarceration imposed in this case shall 
run concurrently with each other and with credit for time 
                     
10  Following this court’s vacatur of Webster’s conviction for carrying, 
using, or threatening to use a firearm in the commission of a separate 
felony, the sentencing court re-sentenced Webster to the same terms for the 
affirmed assault counts.  Webster v. State , 134 Hawaiʻi 306, *1, 339 P.3d 1107 
(App. 2014).  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
7 served.  This sentence shall be served CONSECUTIVE  to the 
sentence imposed [for the assault counts] and [Webster]  shall 
not receive ‘double’ credit for one (1) period of time served.”  
Webster filed the present Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP)  Rule 40 petition (Petition)  on September 30, 
2020.11  Webster contended that his sentence was unlawful for two 
reasons.  First, citing State v. Abihai , 146 Hawaiʻi 398, 463 
P.3d 1055 (2020) , Webster argued that HRS §  706-671(1)12 entitles 
a defendant to pre sentence credit whenever  five criteria are 
met: “(1)  The person is a defendant, (2)  Sentenced to 
imprisonment, (3)  Who had previously been detained in a State 
institution, (4)  Following the person[’]s arrest, (5)  For the 
crime for which Sentence was imposed.”  According to Webste r, 
Webster met the criteria in both proceedings for which he was 
                     
11  Webster has filed at least two other HRPP Rule 40 petitions.  
  
12  HRS § 706-671(1) ( 1993) provides:  
 
When a defendant who is sentenced to imprisonment has 
previously been detained in any State or local 
correctional or other institution following the 
defendant's arrest for the crime for which sentence is 
imposed, such period of detention following the 
defendant's arrest shall be deducted from the minimum 
and maximum terms of such sen tence.  The officer having 
custody of the defendant shall furnish a certificate to 
the court at the time of sentence, showing the length of 
such detention of the defendant prior to sentence in any 
State or local correctional or other institution, and 
the certificate shall be annexed to the official records 
of the defendant's commitment.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
8 sentenced, and t herefore he was entitled to pre sentence credit 
for each sentence.  
Second, quoting North Carolina v. Pearce , 395 U.S. 
711, 717 (1969), Webster asserted that  his sentence violat ed the 
double jeopardy clause of both the Hawaiʻi and the United States 
constitutions because “the guarantee against double jeopardy is 
violated when imprisonment already exacted for an offense is not 
fully credited .” 
On August 23, 2021,  the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit13 (circuit court) rejected Webster’s claims in  its 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Dismissing and 
Denying Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to 
Release Petitioner from Custody (Order).  The circuit cou rt 
“found and concluded that [Webster’s] claim for relief under 
HRPP Rule 40 is (1)  patently frivolous, (2)  has already been 
previously raised by [Webster] and ruled upon by the Court, and 
(3) has no merit.”  The circuit court accordingly dismissed and 
denied Webster’s Petition pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(g)(2).14  
                     
13  The Honorable Kevin A. Souza presided.  
 
14  Citing HRPP Rule 40(f), the circuit court noted in one instance that 
Webster’s claim “is without trace support either in the record or from other 
evidence submitted.”  Insofar as the circuit court specified only HRPP Rule 
40(g)(2) as the basis for  the Orde r, this court does not consider whether the 
circuit court could have dismissed Webster’s Petition pursuant to HRPP Rule 
40(f). *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
9 In particular , the circuit court rejected Webster’s 
Abihai argument because “the Abihai Court was clear that HRS 
706-671(1) properly applied presentence detention credit to both 
of Abihai’s  sentences primarily because they were being served 
concurrently , not consecutively .”  The circuit court added that 
this court “has already heard and ruled on a similar claim being 
put forward by [Webster] ” in Tauiliili , 96 Hawaiʻi at 199, 29 
P.3d at 918 , where this court explained:    
[W]hen concurrent sentences are imposed, presentence credit 
is applied once.  The credit applied once, in effect, is 
applied against each concurrent sentence.  This is done 
because the longest term of the concurrent sentences 
determines the total length of  the imprisonment.  However, 
when consecutive sentences are imposed, credit for 
presentence imprisonment is properly granted against only 
the aggregate of the consecutive sentence terms . 
(Emphasis in Order.)   Thus, the circuit court concluded that 
Webster’ s claim that he was entitled to pre sentence credit for 
each sentence was patently frivolous.  
The circuit court did not address Webster’s double 
jeopardy clause argument.  
On September 2 1, 2021, Webster timely appealed the 
circuit court’s Order to the Interm ediate Court of Appeals  
(ICA).  On May 3, 2022,  the same day Webster filed a reply brief 
before the ICA, Webster timely filed an application for transfer 
to this court. 
On June 6, 2022, this court granted Webster’s 
application for transfer.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
10 II. STANDARD S OF REVIEW  
A. Statutory Interpretation  
The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
which this court reviews de novo.   Keep the N. Shore Country v. 
Bd. of Land & Nat. Res. , 150 Hawaiʻi 486, 503, 506 P.3d 150 , 167 
(2022) ( citing State v. Ruggiero , 114 Hawai‘i 227, 231, 160 P.3d 
703, 707 (2007)).  
B. Constitutional Law  
This court reviews questions of constitutional law de 
novo under the right/wrong standard.  State v. Yamashita , 151 
Hawaiʻi 390, 397, 515 P.3d 207, 214 (2022). 
III.  DISCUSSION  
A. Webster did not waive  his illegal sentence claim.  
As a preliminary matter, t he State argues that 
Webster’s  Abihai claim is  waived because “his sole claim 
concerns application of credit for time spent in custody before 
sentence.”  The State asserts, without explanation, that th is is 
not a claim of illegal sentence  and Webster therefore should 
have raised the claim in prior proceedings .15   
                     
15  The State contends that “the Circuit Court properly found that Webster 
waived the one claim in his Petition.”  However, the ci rcuit court did not 
conclude that Webster waived his current claim.  The circuit court determined 
that Webster was not entitled to relief pursuant to HRPP Rule 40 because 
Webster’s claim, inter alia , “has already been previously raised by 
Petitioner and ru led upon by the Court.”  Contra HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) (“ [A]n 
issue is waived if the petitioner knowingly and understandingly failed to 
raise it ”) (emphasis added).  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
11 However, Webster could not have waived his  Abihai 
claim for two reasons.  First, Webster could not have knowingly 
and understandingly failed t o raise a claim before the claim’s 
underlying basis came into being.  The text of HRPP Rule 
40(a)(3)  (2006) provides :  
[A]n issue is waived if the petitioner knowingly and 
understandingly failed to raise it and it could have been 
raised before the trial, a t the trial, on appeal, in a 
habeas corpus proceeding or any other proceeding actually 
conducted, or in a prior proceeding actually initiated 
under this rule, and the petitioner is unable to prove the 
existence of extraordinary circumstances to justify the  
petitioner’s failure to raise the issue.  
Webster presently relies upon this court’s holding in Abihai, to 
assert that he is entitled to pre sentence credit for both of his 
sentences under HRS §  706-671(1).  Insofar as this court decided 
Abihai after Webste r’s trial, appeal, and prior Rule 40 
petitions concluded, Webster could not have raised or waived the 
claim during the previous proceedings.  Cf. HRPP Rule 40(a)(3).  
Second, Webster’s claim could not be waived because it 
implicates the legality of his sent ence.  As the State 
acknowledges, HRPP Rule 40(a)(3) includes an exception to its 
definition of waived claims: “claim[s] of illegal sentence.”  If 
Webster is correct that HRS §  706-671(1) mandates that the  
sentencing court apply his pre sentence credit to b oth sentences, 
then the sentencing court’s failure to do so would mean that 
Webster’s sentences were rendered in violation of HRS §  706-
671(1), and are illegal.  See State v. Kahalewai , 71 Haw. 624, *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
12 625, 801 P.2d 558, 560 (1990) (explaining an illegal sent ence is 
“a sentence which the court is not authorized to impose”).  
B. The circuit court correctly determined that  Webster’s 
HRS § 706-671(1) claim lacked merit.  
Turning to the merits of Webster’s claims, Webster 
first argues that  HRS § 706-671(1) obligates a sentencing court 
to apply presentence detention credit to each of a defendant’s 
sentence s so long as the defendant  satisfies five criteria.  
Specifically, Webster quotes Abihai, 146 Hawaiʻi at 408, 463 P.3d 
at 1065,  for the pro position that “a person is entitled to 
presentence detention credit if (1)  the person is a defendant 
(2) sentence d to imprisonment (3)  who had previously been 
detained in a State institution (4)  following the person’s 
arrest (5)  for the crime for which sen tence was imposed.”  
However,  Webster’s reliance on Abihai is misplaced.  
In Abihai, defendant  Allan H. Abihai  challenged a circuit 
court’s failure to apply presentence detention credits to a 
later-imposed concurrent  sentence.   Id. at 400, 463 P.3d at 
1057.  Abihai’s explanation of when a person is entitled to 
presentence detention credit under HRS §  706-671(1) consequently 
did not contemplate what would occur when , as here,  a defendant 
is sentenced to consecutive  sentences.  See, e.g. , id. at 410, 
463 P.3d at 1067 (“ Tauiliili  held that a defendant is entitled 
to presentence detention credit on each of the cases for which a *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
13 defendant is sentenced to concurrent  sentences.”) (cit ing 
Tauiliili , 96 Hawaiʻi at 199, 29 P.3d at 918 ) (emphasis added ). 
In contrast, Tauiliili  squarely addressed the issue of 
whether a defendant is entitled to presentence detention credit 
under HRS §  706-671(1) when  the defendant  is sentence d to 
consecutive sentences.  There, defendant Ropati Tauiliili 
challenged a circu it court’s failure to apply a presentence 
detention credit to a consecutive  sentence.  96 Hawaiʻi at 197, 
29 P.3d at 916.  This court concluded that “when consecutive  
sentences are imposed, credit for presentence imprisonment is 
properly granted against on ly the aggregate of the consecutive 
sentence terms.”  Id. at 199, 29 P.3d at 918  (emphasis added) . 
The Tauiliili  court explained :  
The commentary to HRS §  706-671 states in relevant 
part that “[t]his section provides for a result which the 
Code deems fair”  and “provides for some equalization .  . . 
between those defendants who obtain pre -sentence release 
and those who do not.”  Statutes giving credit for 
presentence confinement were designed to ensure equal 
treatment of all defendants whether or not they are  
incarcerated prior to conviction.  In re Atiles , 662 P.2d 
910, 911 (Cal. 1983).  [G]ranting presentence credit, 
therefore, seeks to place an in -custody criminal defendant 
who cannot afford to post bail in the same position as his 
counterpart with bail mon ey.  Nissel v. Pearce , 764 P.2d 
224, 226 (Or. 1988).  
Once credit has been granted, no additional purpose 
is served by granting a second or “double credit” against a 
later consecutive sentence.  State v. Cuen , 761 P.2d 160, 
162 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1988).  
Id. at 199, 29 P.3d at 918.  The court further elaborated that 
“allow[ing] multiple credit for consecutive sentences would *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
14 defeat the legislative purpose underlying consecutive 
sentences.”  Id.  Specifically,  
HRS § 706-668.5 (1993) permits consecutive sentencin g 
if multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a criminal 
defendant at the same time.  The legislative purpose of the 
statute is to give the sentencing court discretion to 
sentence a defendant to a term of imprisonment to run 
either concurrently or con secutively.  State v. Gaylord , 78 
Hawaiʻi 127, 146, 890 P.2d 1167, 1186 -1187 (1995).  
Discretionary use of consecutive sentences is properly 
imposed in order to deter future criminal behavior of the 
defendant, to insure  [sic] public safety, and to assure 
just punishment for the crimes committed.  Id. 
Tauiliili , 96 Hawaiʻi at 199, 29 P.3d at 918  (footnote omitted) .  
Thus, 
Tauiliili’s interpretation of HRS §  706-671 would undermine 
the sentencing court’s decision to impose conse cutive 
imprisonment terms.  We do not believe that the legislature 
intended to allow a “double credit ” for presentence 
confinement without expressly saying so.  Accordingly, we 
hold that the circuit court correctly interpreted HRS 
§ 706-671 by applying Tau iliili’s 853 days of presentence 
credit only once against the aggregate of his consecutive 
sentences.  
Id. at 200, 29 P.3d at 919.  
Although Tauiliili  is squarely on point, Webster 
insisted below that Tauiliili  is inapplicable because 
Tauiliili’s sentences a rose from a single case, while Webster 
“was sentenced in two seperate [sic] Criminal numbers, with two 
seperate [sic] Grand Jury Indictments, and two seprate [sic] 
settings of bail.”   
This is a distinction without a difference.  At the 
time of Webster’s s entencing, HRS § 706-668.5(1) (1993) read: 
If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a 
defendant at the same time, or if a term of imprisonment is 
imposed on a defendant who is already subject to an *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
15 unexpired term of imprisonment, the terms may run 
concurrently or consecutively.  Multiple terms of 
imprisonment imposed at the same time run concurrently 
unless the court orders or the statute mandates that the 
terms run consecutively.  Multiple terms of imprisonment 
imposed at different times run consec utively unless the 
court orders that the terms run concurrently.[16] 
The statute’s references to “[m]ultiple terms of imprisonment 
imposed at different times ” indicate that the legislature’s 
intent behind HRS §  706-668.5 applies regardless of whether the 
sentences were imposed for charges arising from a single case or 
from multiple cases.  
Under these circumstances, the circuit court correctly 
concluded that Tauiliili is controlling and Abihai is not 
directly applicable.  As in Tauiliili , the sentencing court 
“correctly interpreted HRS §  706-661 [and HRS §  706-668.5] by 
applying [Webster’s] presentence credit only once against the 
aggregate of his consecutive sen tences.”  96 Hawaiʻi at 200, 29 
P.3d at 919.  In turn, t he circuit court did not err in 
determining that Webster’s statutory claim is patently frivolous 
and without merit.17   
                     
16  HRS § 706-668.5(1) (Supp. 2015)  presently provides:  
 
If multiple terms of imprisonment are i mposed on a 
defendant, whether at the same time or at different times, 
or if a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who 
is already subject to an unexpired term of imprisonment, 
the terms may run concurrently or consecutively.  Multiple 
terms of i mprisonment run concurrently unless the court 
orders or the statute mandates that the terms run 
consecutively.

finding the petition is patently frivolous, the issues have been previously *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
16 C. Webster’s double jeopardy clause argument also lack s merit. 
Citing North Carolina  v. Pearce , Webster next argues 
that “[t]he constitutional guarantee against multiple 
punishments for the same offense absolutely requires that 
punishment already exacted must be fully ‘credited.’”  This 
argument is unavailing.   
As the United States Court  of Appeals for the Seventh 
Circuit has explained : 
Courts, however, have only taken the teaching of 
Pearce so far as to hold that a failure to credit violates 
the guarantee against double jeopardy when the pre -sentence 
time together with the sentence imposed is greater than the 
statutory maximum penalty for the offense.  Only in such a 
situation is there “doubl e punishment” for one offense.  
Where the pre -sentence time and the sentence imposed 
together are less than the statutory maximum penalty, no 
grounds exist for finding “double punishment,” because the 
total time of incarceration will fall within the single  
maximum period of punishment set by the legislature.  
Faye v. Gray , 541 F.2d 665, 667 (7th Cir. 1976)  (citation 
omitted) ; see also  Vaden, SCWC-20-0000481 at 2 (“[W]hen 
detention or prison time is accrued before sentencing . . . the 
double jeopardy clause’s  prohibition on multiple punishment is 
not violated so long as the defendant’s total period of 
detention and imprisonment does not exceed the statutory maximum 
term for the offenses at issue.”).  Webster does not provide any 
                     
raised and ruled upon, or the issues were waived,” and may deny an HRPP Rule 
40 petition “upon determining the  allegations and arguments have no merit,” 
we do not consider the merits of the circuit court’s finding that Webster’s 
“claim for relief under HRPP Rule 40 has already been previously raised by 
[Webster] and ruled upon by the Court.”  HRPP Rule 40  (emphasi s added) .   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
17  reason why we should deviate fr om the path trodden by other 
courts.   
Applying the test articulated in Faye, Webster’s 
sentences do not run afoul of the double jeopardy clause.  The 
statutory maximum term of imprisonment the sentencing court 
could impose based upon Webster’s conviction s is 65 years.18  
Webster’s current sentences total approximately thirty years.  
Insofar as Webster’s total time of incarceration plus the 
demanded 550 days of presentence detention credit is less than 
the maximum period of punishment, “no grounds exist for finding 
‘double punishment,’ because the total time of incarceration 
. . . fall[s] within the single maximum period of punishment set 
by the legislature.”  Faye, 541 F.2d at 667.  
                     
18  The maximum sentences for  the counts on  which Webster is convicted are:  
 
Count Term of 
Imprisonment  
Attempted Assault in the First 
Degree 10 years  
Place to Keep Pistol or Revolver  10 years  
Reckless Endangering in the First

IV. CONCLUSION  
In light of the foregoing, the sentencing court 
correctly did not apply presentence detention credit to 
Webster’s latter, consecutive sentence.  In turn, the circuit 
court properly concluded that Webster’s Petition lacked merit.  
Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court’s August 23, 
2021 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of L aw, and Order Dismissing 
and Denying Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment 
or to Release Petitioner from Custody.
