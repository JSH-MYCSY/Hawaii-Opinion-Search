David John Michaeledes was charged with several counts 
arising from an alleged hit and run.  The Circuit Court of the 
Fifth Circuit dismissed the charging document as insufficient.  
The State appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”)

 Information and Non-Felony Complaint,” which attempted to 
correct the inadequacies in the first charging document 
identified by the circuit court.  The circuit court dismissed 
the second charging document for lack of jurisdiction while the 
first charging document remained pending on appeal before the 
ICA.  We hold that the filing of the notice of appeal in the 
first case did not divest the circuit court of jurisdiction over 
the second case recharging Michaeledes for the same criminal conduct. 
II. 
BACKGROUND 
On December 28, 2020, Michaeledes was charged in Case 
No. 5CPC-20-0000283 via “Felony Information and Non-Felony Complaint” with three criminal counts for Reckless Driving of 
in the Second Degree, HRS § 707-711(1)(a) and/or (d) (2014); and 
Accidents Involving Substantial Bodily Injury, HRS § 291C-12.5 
(2020).  Michaeledes moved to dismiss the charges, arguing the 
charging language was fatally insufficient.  The State 
subsequently moved to amend its original “Felony Information and Non-Felony Complaint” and Michaeledes opposed that motion, 
arguing that a felony information may not be amended over a 
defendant’s objection under Hawai
ʻi Rules of Penal Procedure Vehicle, Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 291-2 (2020); Assault  
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
3 
 (HRPP) Rule 7(f)(1) (2018)  and HRS § 806-9 (2014).   The circuit 
court agreed with Michaeledes and, on August 10, 2021, entered 
written orders denying the State leave to amend and granting 
Michaeledes’s motion to dismiss without prejudice.2 1
  On August 
17, 2021, the State appealed the circuit court’s August 10 orders.3
4   
Shortly thereafter, on August 31, 2021, the State 
recharged Michaeledes in Case No. 5CPC-21-0000174 by way of a second “Felony Information and Non-Felony Complaint,” this time 
alleging statutory definitions and elements omitted in the first 
“Felony Information and Non-Felony Complaint.”  The counts in 
 
1  HRPP Rule 7(f)(1) provides: “T he court may permit a charge other 
than an indictment to be amended at any time before trial commences if 
substantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced.” 
 
2  HRS § 806- 9 provides: 
 
All provisions of law applying to prosecutions upon 
indictments, to writs and process therein, and the issuing 
and service thereof, to motions, pleadings, trials, and 
punishments, or the passing or execution of any sentence, 
and to all proceedings in cases of indictment, whether in the court of original or appellate jurisdiction, shall in 
the same manner and to the same extent as near as may be, 
apply to information and all prosecutions and proceedings 
thereon.  
 
3  The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided. 
 
4  In its appeal of the dismissal of the first “Felony Information 
and Non- Felony Complaint,” the State raises three arguments: (1) the Reckless 
Driving charge was not defective for failing to allege Michaeledes operated a 
vehicle on a public highway; (2) as a matter of law, a felony information may 
be amended to allege statutory definitions or essential elements; and (3) the 
circuit court abused its discretion by dismissing the case.  This appeal, 
which arises from the first “Felony Information and Non- Felony Complaint,” 
was docketed as CAAP- 21-0000466.  This appeal is not currently before this 
court, and therefore we do not address the merits.

 (continued . . .) the first “Felony Information and Non-Felony Complaint” 
(hereinafter, the “first charging document”) are the same as 
those alleged in the second “Felony Information and Non-Felony 
Complaint” (hereinafter, the “second charging document”).
  
Michaeledes moved to dismiss the second charging 
document for lack of jurisdiction under State v. Ontiveros, 82 
Hawai‘i 446, 923 P.2d 388 (1996), since the appeal of the first 
charging document was pending before the ICA.  On September 20, 
2021, the circuit court agreed with Michaeledes and orally 
dismissed the second charging document, this time for lack of 
jurisdiction.5  The State moved to reopen the hearing to clarify 
whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice.  On 
September 30, 2021, the circuit court held a hearing on the 
State’s Motion to Reopen Hearing at which Michaeledes was not 
present.   
On October 1, 2021, the circuit court entered a 
written order reopening the September 20, 2021 hearing on 
Michaeledes’s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction and 
clarified that its dismissal of the second charging document was without prejudice.
6  On October 7, 2021, the circuit court then 
 
5  The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided. 
 
6  In its October 1 order, the circuit court explained it “intended 
that said dismissal would b e WITHOUT prejudice” and “clarifie[d] that the 
Felony Information and Non- Felony Complaint filed in the above- captioned case 
is dismissed without prejudice.”    
 
*** FOR PUB

 entered a written order dismissing the second charging document.  
Michaeledes appealed the October 1 order, arguing the complaint 
should be dismissed with prejudice.  The State appealed the 
October 7 order, arguing Ontiveros did not divest the circuit 
court of jurisdiction to proceed against Michaeledes on the 
second charging document.  The appeals of the October 1 and 
October 7 orders, both arising from the second charging 
document, were subsequently consolidated and are now before this court.

III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Jurisdiction 
Whether the circuit court had jurisdiction is reviewed 
under the right/wrong standard.  Ontiveros, 82 Hawai‘ i at 448, 
923 P.2d at 390. B.  Questions of Law 
“We review questions of law under the right/wrong 
standard.”  State v. Hernandez, 143 Hawai‘ i 
 501, 507, 431 P.3d 
 
(continued . . .) 
 
7  In its October 7 order, the circuit court explained in a footnote 
that during the September 30 hearing, it had orally granted the Stateʻs 
Motion to Reopen Hearing and “clarified the order of dismissal was without 
prejudice.” 
 
8  Michaeledes’s appeal arising from the October 1 order was 
docketed as CAAP- 21-0000562.  The State’s appeal arising from the October 7 
order was docketed as CAAP- 21-0000569.  The consolidated appeals were 
docketed as CAAP- 21-0000562.

C. Interpretation of Court Rules 
“‘When interpreting rules promulgated by the court, 
principles of statutory construction apply.’”  State v. 
Thompson, 150 Hawai‘ i 262, 266, 500 P.3d 447, 451 (2021) (quoting 
State v. Baron, 80 Hawai‘ i 107, 113, 905 P.2d 613, 619 (1995)).  
“The interpretation of a statute is a question of law which this 
court reviews de novo.”  Id. (citing State v. Ruggiero, 114 
Hawai‘i 227, 231, 160 P.3d 703, 707 (2007)). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
In its appeal of the October 7 order, the State argues 
that the notice of appeal arising from the first charging document did not divest the circuit court of jurisdiction over 
the second case that was based on the second charging document.   
In his appeal of the October 1 order, Michaeledes 
argues: (1) the circuit court erred when it granted the State’s 
Motion to Reopen Hearing because the rule of lenity requires 
otherwise; (2) even if the circuit court could reopen the 
hearing, the circuit court failed to articulate its reasoning for dismissing the case without prejudice; and (3) the circuit 
court violated Michaeledes’s rights under HRPP Rule 43 (2018) by 
hearing and ruling on the State’s Motion to Reopen Hearing 
despite him not being present.    
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 We address each argument in turn. 
A. 
The Notice of Appeal Divested the Circuit Court Only of 
Jurisdiction over the Appealed Case 
 
We first turn to the single point of error raised on 
appeal raised by the State.  At issue is whether the State is 
barred from prosecuting Michaeledes under a second charging 
document alleging identical counts, while the State’s appeal of 
the dismissal of the first charging document is pending before 
the ICA.  Michaeledes argues that, under Ontiveros, the circuit 
court properly dismissed the second charging document for lack of jurisdiction.  The State counters that Ontiveros does not 
apply because a “notice of appeal divests the trial court of jurisdiction over the appealed case,” and thus a pending appeal 
does not bar the State from re-charging Michaeledes in a second, 
separate case.  82 Hawaiʻ i at 448-49, 923 P.2d at 390-91 
(emphasis added) (quoting Richardson v. Sport Shinko (Waikiki 
Corp.), 76 Hawaiʻ i 494, 500, 880 P.2d 169, 175 (1994)).  We 
agree. 
We take this opportunity to clarify that the notice of 
appeal divested the circuit court only of jurisdiction over the 
appealed case and not the subsequent case, which was based on a 
distinct charging document.  
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 1. 
The State’s appeal in the first case did not divest 
the circuit court of jurisdiction over the second case 
recharging Michaeledes with the same criminal conduct 
Our decisions in Ontiveros and Kalani inform our 
reasoning here.  In Ontiveros, we explained “[t]he general rule 
is that the filing of a notice of appeal divests the trial court 
of jurisdiction over the appealed case.”  Id. (emphasis added).  
Michaeledes argues the general rule in Ontiveros should govern 
here, and that we should hold the circuit court was divested of 
jurisdiction over the refiled case.  We disagree.  Because 
recharging the defendant does not revive the original case, but 
instead initiates a new case, the appeal of the first case does 
not divest the trial court of jurisdiction over the second case.  
See State v. Kalani, 87 Hawai‘ i 260, 262, 953 P.2d 1358, 1360 
(1998).  Ontiveros only “divests the trial court of jurisdiction 
over the appealed case.”  82 Hawai‘ i at 448-49, 923 P.2d at 390-
91 (emphasis added).   
In Ontiveros, the defendant was charged with multiple 
counts arising from his failure to stop at a red light while 
driving under the influence (DUI).  Id. at 447, 923 P.2d at 389.
The defendant moved to dismiss, alleging double jeopardy becausehe was already subject to an administrative driver’s license 
revocation as a result of his conduct, and the district court 
denied the motion.  Id.  During a recess immediately following 
the district court’s denial, the defendant filed a notice of   
  
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
9 
 appeal to this court of the ruling denying his motion to dismiss 
under HRS § 641-17 (1993),  arguing lack of jurisdiction.  Id. at 
447-48, 923 P.2d at 389-90.  When court reconvened and the defendant notified the district court of his appeal, the 
district court “concluded that the notice of appeal was a 
nullity” because the supreme court lacked jurisdiction over 
interlocutory appeals from district courts.  Id.  The district 
court subsequently convicted the defendant on the DUI charges.  Id. at 448, 923 P.2d at 390. 9
We held that because the denial of a motion to dismiss 
is not immediately appealable, the notice of appeal was 
jurisdictionally defective and therefore did not divest the 
trial court of jurisdiction.  Id. at 451-52, 923 P.2d at 393-94.  
Thus, the district court had jurisdiction when it entered 
 
9  HRS § 641- 17, which allowed direct appeals of criminal matters 
from the circuit court to the supreme court, provided in relevant part: 
 
Interlocutory appeals from circuit courts, criminal 
matters.  Upon application made within the time provided by 
the rules of the supreme court, an appeal in a criminal 
matter may be allowed to a defendant from the circuit court
 
to the supreme court, subject to chapter 602 , from a 
decision denying a motion to dismiss or from other interlocutory orders, decisions, or judgments, whenever the 
judge in the judge’s discretion may think the same 
advisable for a more speedy termination of the case.  The 
refusal of the judge to allow an interlocutory appeal to 
the appellate court shall not be reviewable by any other 
court. 
 
(Emphasis added).    
HRS § 641 -17 was amended in 2004 to 
direct appeals to the ICA in 
the first instance.  2004 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 202, § 71 at 945.  
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
10 
 judgment against the defendant and convicted him on the DUI 
charge.  Id. 
In Kalani, the defendants were charged with assault in 
the second degree for allegedly beating their child.  87 Hawai‘ i 
at 260, 953 P.2d at 1358.  When the circuit court granted the defendants’ oral motion to dismiss without prejudice, the State 
appealed the order to the ICA.  Id.  The ICA dismissed the 
State’s appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction “because an order of dismissal without prejudice is not a final appealable 
order.”  Id. 
We held that because an order granting a motion to 
dismiss terminates proceedings in the trial court, “an order granting a motion to dismiss is final.”  Id. at 262, 593 P.2d at 
1360.  Thus, the ICA improperly dismissed the appeal because it had appellate jurisdiction to review the order granting the 
motion to dismiss without prejudice.  Id.  We explained that 
regardless of whether a dismissal is with or without prejudice, it is a final order because refiling a new charging document 
does not “revive the original case,” instead it “initiates a new 
case.”  Id.  
Here, there is no dispute that the August 17, 2021 
notice of appeal divested the circuit court of jurisdiction over 
the first case arising from the first charging document.   
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
11 
 (continued . . .) Instead, Michaeledes contends our rule in Ontiveros also 
divested the circuit court of jurisdiction in the second case.    
We disagree because, as we explained in Kalani, 
“recharging [the defendant] does not revive the original case.  
Rather, recharging the defendant initiates a new case.”  87 
Hawai‘i at 262, 953 P.2d at 1360.  The circuit court’s order 
dismissing the first case without prejudice was a final order 
terminating only that case.  See id. (explaining that a 
“dismissal without prejudice is a final order” that “terminates 
the current case”). 
The second charging document alleging the same three 
counts initiated a second case, separate from the first case arising from the first charging document.  Because the notice of 
appeal only divested the circuit court of jurisdiction over the 
first case on appeal, and because the second case is a new case, 
separate and distinct from the first, the circuit court has 
jurisdiction to hear the second case while the first case is 
pending appeal before the ICA.
10 
 
10  Other jurisdictions that have considered whether the State may 
initiate a second case based on the same underlying facts while the first 
case is on appeal have likewise found no jurisdictional barrier to the trial court considering the second case.  In State v. Thayer, the Oregon Court of 
Appeals held: 
 
We agree with the state.  Certainly, filing the notice of appeal concerning the dismissal of the first information deprived the trial court  - subject to exceptions not 
pertinent to this case
 - of jurisdiction to proceed with 
the prosecution of that case.  State v. Stevens, 134 Or.  
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
12 
 2. 
Allowing the first case and second case to proceed simultaneously promotes judicial efficiency without 
risk of confusion 
As we explained in TSA Int’l Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 
the general rule identified in Ontiveros “is designed to avoid 
the confusion and inefficiency that might flow from placing the 
same issue before two courts at the same time.”  92 Hawai‘ i 243, 
265, 990 P.2d 713, 735 (1999) (citing 9 J. Moore, Moore’s 
Federal Practice ¶ 203.11 at 5-50 (2d ed. 1996)).   
Here, allowing the appeal of the first case to proceed 
concurrently with the second case is unlikely to result in 
confusion because the two cases raise distinct legal issues.  
 
(continued . . .) 
App. 1, 894 P.2d 1217 (1995).  Nothing precluded the state 
from initiating a separate action by filing a second 
information, however.  Defendant cites no authority for his 
contention that the state is precluded from doing just 
that; he merely complains that it presents the practical 
problem of requiring him to defend the dismissal of the 
case against him on two fronts.  That may be so but such 
practical difficulties do not amount to a jurisdictional 
impediment. 
 
974 P.2d 699, 701 (Or. Ct. App. 1999). 
 
Similarly, in Brown v. State, the Georgia Court of Appeals also 
addressed whether the trial court could hear a case arising from a second 
indictment when the first was on appeal as procedurally defective.  745 S.E.2d 699, 702 (Ga. Ct. App. 2013).  The Georgia Court of Appeals concluded 
the trial court could, explaining: 
 
The Second Indictment initiated a completely separate 
prosecution on the same charges, and no contention is raised that the Second Indictment suffered from the same 
infirmity as the First Indictment.  Thus, the trial court’s 
acceptance of the Second Indictment had no effect on the 
issue of whether the First Indictment was valid, and the 
trial court thus had jurisdiction to consider the Second Indictment.  
 
Id.
 (footnotes omitted).  
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
13 
 (continued . . .) The appeal arising from the first charging document concerns the 
narrower issue of whether the State may amend a felony 
information and whether a Reckless Driving of Vehicle charge is 
defective for failing to allege a defendant operated a vehicle 
on a public highway.  The second case arising from the second 
charging document more broadly concerns Michaeledes’s criminal 
liability.  Because the appeal of the first case does not 
concern the merits of the underlying charged offenses, simultaneous or subsequent rulings in one of these cases are 
unlikely to invalidate or supersede the other. 
Similarly, allowing both cases to proceed will not 
result in undue inefficiency.  Rather, requiring the appeal of 
the first case either be adjudicated or withdrawn prior to 
allowing the State to pursue its prosecution of Michaeledes 
would be less efficient than allowing the cases to proceed 
concurrently, especially since doing so does not “plac[e] the 
same issue before two courts at the same time.”  Id.  Allowing 
both cases to proceed simultaneously most efficiently provides a 
speedy determination of Michaeledes’s criminal liability while 
also allowing the State to pursue the legal issues presented in 
its appeal of the first case.11 
 
11  We note, as the State argues, that jeopardy has not yet attached 
to either case and as such, Michaeledes would not be subject to double 
jeopardy by allowing both cases to proceed simultaneously.   See State v. 
Moriwake, 65 Haw. 47, 51, 647 P.2d 705, 709 (1982 ) (determining that the

  B. 
Michaeledes’s Points of Error Lack Merit 
On appeal, Michaeledes argues: (1) the circuit court 
erred when it granted the State’s Motion to Reopen Hearing 
because the rule of lenity requires otherwise; (2) even if the 
circuit court could reopen the hearing, the circuit court failed 
to articulate a basis for dismissing the case without prejudice; 
and (3) the circuit court violated Michaeledes’s rights under 
HRPP Rule 43 by hearing and ruling on the State’s Motion to Reopen Hearing despite him not being present.  We address each 
argument in turn.  
First, Michaeledes argues that because the dismissal 
of the second case for lack of jurisdiction did not specify it 
was without prejudice, the rule of lenity requires it be 
construed as a dismissal with prejudice.  This argument is 
without merit.  The rule of lenity does not apply because the 
dismissal was for lack of jurisdiction and does not involve a 
question of statutory interpretation.  See State v. Guyton, 135 
Hawaiʻi 372, 380, 351 P.3d 1138, 1146 (2015) (“This longstanding 
 
(continued . . .) 
“prohibition against double jeopardy is not implicated until jeopardy has 
‘attached’” (quoting Serfass v. United States, 420 U.S. 377, 388 (1975))).  
As we explained in State v. Quitog, “‘it is generally accepted that in jury 
trials, jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn[.]’”   85 
Hawai‘i 128, 141, 938 P.2d 559, 572 (1997) (alteration in original) (quoting 
State v. Baranco, 77 
Hawaii‘ 351, 355, 884 P.2d 729, 733 (1994)).  Both in the 
first case arising from the first charging document and the second case 
arising from the second charging document, a jury has not been impaneled or sworn in. 
   
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
15 
 precept of statutory interpretation states that ‘[w]here a 
criminal statute is ambiguous . . . the statute must be strictly 
construed against the government and in favor of the accused.’” 
(emphasis added) (ellipses in original) (quoting State v. 
Shimabukuro, 100 
Hawaiʻi 324, 327, 60 P.3d 274, 277 (2002)).   
Second, Michaeledes argues that the circuit court 
failed to articulate a basis for its order to dismiss without 
prejudice.  Michaeledes relies on State v. Estencion, which 
requires trial courts to consider various factors and articulate written reasoning for dismissing a case with or without 
prejudice in the speedy trial context under HRPP Rule 48 (2018).  
63 Haw. 264, 268-69, 625 P.2d 1040, 1043-44 (1981).  Estencion 
and its progeny are irrelevant because Michaeledes moved to 
dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under HRPP Rule 12(b)(1) 
(2018),12 not under HRPP Rule 48 for a speedy trial violation.  
Michaeledes cites no applicable authority for his contention that trial courts must provide a basis for dismissing a case 
without prejudice when that dismissal is for lack of 
jurisdiction.  Even were Michaeledes to point to such an 
 
12  HRPP Rule 12(b)(1) provides: 
 
(b) Pretrial Motions. Any defense, objection, or 
request which is capable of determination without the trial 
of the general issue may be raised before trial by motion.  
Motions may be written or oral at the discretion of the 
judge.  The following must be raised prior to trial:  
(1) defenses and objections based on defects in the 
institution of the prosecution[.] 
  
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
16 
 authority, it does not appear that a dismissal with prejudice 
would be appropriate given the circumstances of this case 
because the jurisdictional defect was curable.  Put another way, 
since the basis for the jurisdictional defect would be 
eliminated once the first appeal is resolved, it would make no 
sense to preclude the State from returning to court once that 
condition had been satisfied. 
Third, Michaeledes argues the circuit court violated 
his rights under HRPP Rule 4313 by hearing and ruling on the 
State’s Motion to Reopen Hearing despite Michaeledes’s absence.  
While HRPP Rule 43 requires the defendant “at pretrial 
evidentiary hearings” and “at every stage of the trial,” the 
 
13  HRPP Rule 43 provides in relevant part: 
 
Rule 43.  Presence of the Defendant. 
(a) Presence required.  The defendant shall be 
present at the arraignment, at the time of the plea, at 
evidentiary pretrial hearings, at every stage of the trial 
including the impaneling of the jury and the return of the 
verdict, and at the imposition of sentence, except as 
otherwise provided by this R ule. 
 
. . . 
 
(c) Presence not required.   A defendant need not be 
present either physically or by video conference if: 
(1) the defendant is a corporation and appears by 
counsel; or 
(2) the proceeding is a conference or argument upon a 
question of law; or 
(3) the proceeding is a reductio n of sentence under 
Rule 35. 
 
(Emphase s added). 
  
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
17 
 defendant’s presence is not required if “the proceeding is a 
conference or argument upon a question of law,” as it was here. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, the circuit court erred in 
dismissing Case No. 5CPC-21-0000174 for lack of jurisdiction.  Accordingly, we reverse: (1) the circuit court’s October 1, 2021 
order to the extent it dismissed the case for lack of 
jurisdiction; and (2) the circuit court’s October 7, 2021 order dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction.  The case is 
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Rebecca Vogt Like
