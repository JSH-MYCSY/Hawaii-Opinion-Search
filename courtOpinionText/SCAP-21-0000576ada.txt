Dkt. 20 OP2 
 No person shall be subject to be tried and sentenced to be 
punished in any court, for an alleged offense, unless upon 
indictment or information, except for offenses within the 
jurisdiction of a district court or in summary proceedings 
for contempt. 
 
HRS § 801-1. 
 Defendant-Appellant Richard Obrero argues the State violated HRS § 801-1 by using the complaint and preliminary 
hearing process to prosecute him for second-degree murder, 
attempted murder in the first and second degree, and use of 
firearm in the commission of a separate felony. 
 We agree.  Obrero isn’t charged with contempt.  And the 
felonies he’s charged with are neither within the jurisdiction 
of the district court nor chargeable by information, see HRS 
§§ 806-82 (2014), 806-83 (Supp. 2021).  So Obrero is a person who shall not “be subject to be tried and sentenced . . . in any court, for an alleged offense, unless upon indictment.”  HRS 
§ 801-1.   
We hold that HRS § 801-1 means what it plainly says: 
criminal defendants cannot be “subject to be tried and sentenced 
to be punished in any court, for an alleged offense” without an 
indictment or information unless the charged offense is either 
contempt or within the jurisdiction of the district court.   
We also hold that defendants are “subject to be tried and 
sentenced to be punished” at arraignment, when they must either plead guilty, and be subject to sentencing, or plead not guilty, 3 
 and be subject to trial and possibly also sentencing. 
II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 
 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings 
 
On November 12, 2019, the State filed six separate 
complaints against Obrero, alleging, among other things,1 that he 
had committed second-degree murder in violation of HRS §§ 707-
701.5 (Supp. 2021) and 706-656.  
Two days later, on the morning of November 14, 2019, the 
State presented its case against Obrero to an Oʻ ahu Grand Jury.2  
The grand jury returned a no bill.  It did not think there was 
probable cause to believe Obrero committed any of the charged 
crimes.  And it voted against allowing the State to subject 
Obrero to the indignity, expense, and stigma of a criminal 
prosecution. 
The State was undeterred.  On the afternoon of November 14, 
2019 – just a few hours after the grand jury returned a no bill 
– the State made its case again,3 this time at a preliminary 
                                                 
1  The State also alleged Obrero had violated HRS §  134-21 (2011) by using 
a firearm to commit second-degree murder.  And that he’d committed one count 
of attempted murder in the first degree in violation of HRS §§ 705-500 
(2014), 707- 701(1)(a) ( 2014 & Supp. 2021) , and 706- 656 and three counts of 
attempted murder in the s econd degree in violation of HRS §§ 705-500, 707-
701.5, and 706- 656 (2014). 
 
2  The proposed indictment included the six offenses in the complaint as 
well as three counts of c arrying or u se of firearm in the c ommission of a 
separate felony in violation of HRS § 134-21. 
 
3  The State argued that there was probable cause to charge Obrero for the 
six offenses alleged in the complaint. 
 4 
 hearing before the district court.  The hearing was continued to 
the next day; when it concluded, the district court — unlike the 
grand jury — found there was probable cause to charge Obrero.  
It committed Obrero’s case to the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit.4 
Obrero pled not guilty at his November 2019 arraignment.   Later, in July 2021, Obrero moved for dismissal of the 
charges.  He argued the State’s prosecution of him was unlawful 
because there was no indictment.  He pointed to the plain 
language of HRS § 801-1: 
No person shall be subject to be tried and sentenced to be 
punished in any court, for an alleged offense, unless upon 
indictment or information, except for offenses within the 
jurisdiction of a district court or in summary proceedings 
for contempt. 
 
HRS § 801-1. 
 Obrero argued that his charges weren’t for contempt and 
didn’t fall “within the jurisdiction of a district court.”  He 
reasoned that since the charges against him can’t be charged by 
information (which is only available for certain Class B and C 
felonies, see HRS §§ 806-82, 806-83), he is a person who shall 
not “be subject to be tried and sentenced to be punished in any court, for an alleged offense, unless upon indictment.”  See HRS 
§ 801-1. 
                                                 
4  The State consolidated its six previously- filed complaints into a 
single complaint in the circuit court.  5 
  The State opposed Obrero’s motion.  It urged the court to 
look beyond the plain text of HRS § 801-1 and interpret the 
statute through reference to article I, section 10 of the Hawai‘ i 
Constitution. 
Before 1982, the Hawai‘ i Constitution mirrored the federal 
constitution in requiring grand jury presentments or indictments 
for felony prosecutions.  In 1982, a constitutional amendment rolled back the 
constitutional grand jury indictment requirement 
for felony prosecutions.  Now, article I, section 10 begins: “No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise 
infamous crime,
5 unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand 
jury or upon a finding of probable cause after a preliminary 
hearing held as provided by law or upon information6 in writing 
signed by a legal prosecuting officer . . . .” (emphasis added). 
The State argued that the 1982 amendment didn’t just make 
it constitutional for it to initiate felony prosecutions through 
the complaint and preliminary hearing process, it also 
                                                 
5  Article I, section 10 refers to “infamous crimes,” rather than 
felonies.  We have never considered the meaning of the term “infamous crimes” 
as used in article I, section 10.  But in Mackin v. United States, 117 U.S. 
348, 354 (1886), the United States Supreme Court held that an “infamous 
crime” in the context of the Fifth Amendment right to a grand jury indictment 
excluded “misdemeanors not punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary.”  
And United States v. J. Lindsay Wells Co., 186 F. 248, 250 (W.D. Tenn. 1910) 
held that an “infamous crime” was one that may lead to the punishment of imprisonment for more than one year, a definition that encompasses all felonies. 
 
6  Article I, section 10 was amended again in 2004 to allow for 
information charging.  See 2004 Haw. Sess. L., at 1085.
 6 
 effectively nullified HRS § 801-1’s grand jury protections by 
authorizing the State to use complaints and preliminary hearings 
to initiate felony prosecutions. 
The State supported this position with a discussion of 
Hawai‘i Rules of Penal Procedure Rules (HRPP) 5(c) and 7(b).  The 
former 
explicitly contemplates preliminary hearings as 
proceedings that may follow the arrest of defendants charged 
with felonies.  The latter — in direct conflict with HRS § 801-1 
— states that a felony may be prosecuted by complaint “if with 
respect to that felony the district judge has found probable 
cause at a preliminary hearing and has committed the defendant 
to answer in the circuit court . . .” (or if the defendant has properly waived the right to an indictment or preliminary 
hearing).  See HRPP Rule 7(b).  The State notes that under HRS 
§ 602-11 the HRPP have the force and effect of law. 
The trial court denied Obrero’s motion to dismiss.  It 
relied on the in pari materia canon of statutory construction, which provides that laws on the same subject matter should be 
“construed with reference to each other” so that “[w]hat is clear in one statute may be called upon in aid to explain what 
is doubtful in another.”  Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Omiya, 142 
Hawai‘i 439, 450, 420 P.3d 370, 381 (2018).  The court recognized 
that HRS § 801-1 “standing alone . . . could lend itself to the 
interpretation that Mr. Obrero in this case should have been 7 
 indicted by a grand jury in order for the State to proceed.”  
But, it said, HRS § 801-1 does not stand alone; the statue must 
be read “in pari materia to other statutes, which the State has 
pointed out, and other constitutional provisions and other rules 
that are promulgated by our Supreme Court, which, pursuant to 
HRS [§] 602-11, do have the force and effect of law.”  The court 
concluded that when HRS § 801-1 was read in pari materia with 
the authorities identified by the State, it did not preclude the State from using the complaint and preliminary hearing process 
to prosecute Obrero. 
B. Proceedings on Appeal  
 
Obrero took an interlocutory appeal to the ICA.  He then 
applied for, and received, transfer to this court. 
On appeal, Obrero contends that the circuit court erred by 
applying the in pari materia canon of statutory interpretation.7   
That canon, he contends, applies only where there is something 
doubtful or ambiguous about a statute.  Since HRS § 801-1 is clear on its face, the application of the in pari materia canon 
in this case doesn’t resolve ambiguity, it creates it. 
                                                 
7  On appeal, Obrero also argues that the charges against him should be 
dismissed 
with prejudice in order to prevent the possibility of a future 
putative due process injury.  Obrero does not claim that his due process 
rights have been violated and has not shown an imminent “distinct and 
palpable” possibility that they will be violated.  See Kaho‘ohanohano v. 
State, 114 Hawai‘ i 302, 318, 162 P.3d 696, 712 (2007).  For these reasons, we 
decline to address Obrero’s due process contentions. 8 
  The State counters that it is a “fundamental tenet” of 
statutory interpretation that “laws in pari materia, or upon the 
same subject matter, shall be construed with reference to each 
other.  What is clear in one statute may be called in aid to 
explain what is doubtful in another.”  The State observes that 
article I, section 10, HRS §§ 805-7 and 806-8, as well as HRPP 
Rules 5 and 7, all relate to the same topic as HRS § 801-1: the 
methods by which a criminal prosecution may be initiated.  So, it reasons, HRS § 801-1’s meaning should be triangulated through 
reference to those other authorities. 
The State points out that in 1991 the legislature amended 
HRS §§ 806-6, -7, and -8 to add “complaint” to the disjunctive 
series “information, complaint, or an indictment” and said the 
amendment’s purpose was “to include complaints as a means of 
commencing a criminal prosecution.”  See
 HRS §§ 806-6 (2014), -7 
(2014), and -8 (2014).  The legislature described the amendment as a “‘housekeeping measure’ to conform certain provisions of the [HRS] to what is currently practiced under the [HRPP].”  
House Standing Committee Report Number 1652, in 1991 House 
Journal, at 1437.  The State says we should interpret HRS § 801-
1 in light of this legislative history. 9 
  On appeal, the State also argues that HRS § 801-1 was 
repealed by implication.  It points to HRS §§ 602-11,8 805-7,9 
and 806-8,10 and HRPP Rules 5 and 7 and argues they “cover the 
field regulating the process, practices, and procedure that 
authorize a person to be held to answer for felony offenses upon 
a finding of probable cause after a preliminary hearing” and 
that HRS § 801-1, therefore, “seems to have been, in part, 
impliedly repealed or amended” such that it cannot be interpreted as Obrero contends.  
Obrero rejects the State’s repeal-by-implication argument.  
   21, 305 P.3d 437 Citing State v. Casugay-Badiang, 130 Hawai 
‘i
                                                 
8  See HRS § 602- 11 (2016) (“The supreme court shall have power to 
promulgate rules in all civil and criminal cases for all courts relating to 
process, practices, procedure and appeals, which shall have the force and 
effect of law.  Such rules shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify the substantive rights of any litigant, nor the jurisdiction of any of the 
courts, nor affect any statute of limitations.”). 
 
9  See HRS § 805- 7 (“In all cases of arrest for offenses that must be 
tried in the first instance before a jury, or that can be tried only on 
indictment by a grand jury, the judge in whose jurisdiction or on whose 
warrant the accused was arrested, upon the appearance of the accused, shall 
proceed to consider whether there is probable cause to believe that the 
accused is guilty of the offense with which the accused is charged.”). 
 
10  HRS § 806- 8 says: 
 
In criminal cases brought in the first instance in a court of record, but in which the accused may be held to answer 
without an indictment by a grand jury, the legal prosecutor may arraign and prosecute the accused upon an information, 
complaint, or an indictment at the prosecutor’s election; 
and in all criminal cases brought in the first instance in 
a court of record the prosecutor may arraign and prosecute 
the accused by information, complaint, or indictment, as the case may be, whether there has been a previous 
examination, or commitment for trial by a judge, or not. 
 
HRS § 806- 8. 10 
 (2013), he argues that for a statute to be repealed by 
implication it must be “‘plainly irreconcilable’ with some other 
statute or constitutional provision.”  Id. at 29, 305 P.3d at 
445.  Obrero says the State has not shown that “effect can[not] 
reasonably be given” to both HRS § 801-1 and the constitutional 
and statutory provisions the State contends implicitly repeal 
HRS § 801-1. 
III. DISCUSSION  
 
HRS § 801-1 plainly states that the State must secure an 
indictment to subject Obrero to trial and sentencing.11  We agree 
with Obrero that we cannot undo this unambiguous statutory requirement with an in pari materia analysis: the in pari 
materia canon is used to resolve statutory ambiguity, not create 
it. 
The only ambiguity in HRS § 801-1 is found in the phrase 
“subject to trial and sentencing.”  At what point does a criminal defendant become subject to trial and sentencing?  We 
hold that a defendant is subject to trial and sentencing at 
arraignment, when they must either plead guilty (and face 
                                                 
11  We review the court’s interpretation of HRS § 801- 1 de novo.  See Gray 
v. Admin. Dir. of the Court, 84 Hawai‘ i 138, 144, 931 P.2d 580, 586 (1997) 
(“The interpretation of a statute is a question of law reviewable de novo.” 
(Cleaned up.)).  However, had Obrero challenged the State’s failure to comply 
with HRS § 801- 1 for the first time on appeal, we would presume the validity 
of the complaint against him and would not reverse his conviction absent a showing that the complaint prejudiced him or could not be construed to charge 
a crime.  See State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai‘ i 383, 399, 219 P.
 3d 1170, 1186 
(2009). 11 
 sentencing) or plead not guilty (and face trial and potentially 
also sentencing). 
In addition to holding that HRS § 801-1 means what it 
plainly says, we also hold that the statute has not been 
implicitly repealed.  HRS § 801-1 is still good law.  And the 
State’s prosecution of Obrero is unlawful because it has not 
complied with the statute’s indictment requirement.12 
                                                 
12  The unlawfulness of the State’s prosecution did not deprive the circuit 
court of subject- matter jurisdiction.  Article VI, section 1 of Hawai‘ i’s  
constitution gives the courts “original and appellate jurisdiction as 
provided by law.”  And under HRS § 603- 21.5(a)(1), the circuit courts have 
jurisdiction over “[c]riminal offenses cognizable under the laws of the 
State, committed within their respective circuits or transferred to them for 
trial by change of venue from some other circuit court.”  HRS § 603-
21.5(a)(1) (2016 & Supp. 2021).   “Cognizable means ‘capable of being known or 
recognized,’ or ‘ capable of being judicially tried or examined before a 
designated tribunal; within the court’ s jurisdiction.’”  Schwartz v. State, 
136 Hawai‘ i 258, 264 , 361 P.3d 1161, 1167 (2015) (cleaned up) (quoting Black’s 
Law Dictionary 316 (10th ed. 2014)).  
 
In Schwartz, we held that a complaint properly invoked the subject-
matter jurisdiction of the District Court of the Second Circuit even though 
it failed to allege an element of the crime it charged.  We explained that 
the statutory requirements for the district court’s jurisdiction (found in 
HRS §§ 604–8 (2016 & Supp. 2021) and 604–11.5 (2016)) were met because the 
charging document alleged the defendant committed a “‘known’ and recognized” 
statutory offense “punishable by a fine and by imprisonment not exceeding one 
year,” “in Lāhainā, which is within the Second Circuit.”  Id.  at 264, 361 
P.3d at 1167.  Here, a similar analysis informs our conclusion that the 
State’s complaint properly invoked the circuit court’s subject- matter 
jurisdiction.  The complaint alleged Obrero violated HRS §§ 705- 500, 707-
701(1)(a), 706- 656, 707-701.5, and 134- 21, all of which are recognized 
offenses under the laws of our State.   It also alleged Obrero committed the se 
offenses “in the City and County of Honolulu,” which is in the First Circuit.  
By charging Obrero with committing “ [c]riminal offenses cognizable under the 
laws of the State, committed within [the First Circuit],” the complaint 
satisfied HRS § 603- 21.5(a)(1)’s requirements for invoking the Circuit Court 
of the First Circuit’s subject- matter jurisdiction. 12 
 A. The in pari materia canon is inapplicable because HRS 
§ 801-1 is plain on its face: the State needs an indictment 
to subject Obrero to trial and sentencing  
 
The plain language of HRS § 801-1 leaves little room for 
confusion or doubt about what the State must do if it wants to 
subject Obrero to trial and sentencing: the statute says that if 
the State wants to subject a criminal defendant to trial and 
sentencing for alleged offenses other than contempt or those in 
the jurisdiction of the district court, it must have an indictment or information. 
The State has not advanced any “reasonable, competing 
interpretations” of what’s required by the statute.  There is 
therefore no ambiguity about what HRS § 801-1 requires the State 
to do before it may “subject Obrero to trial and sentencing.”  
See United States v. Acosta, 363 F.3d 1141, 1155 (11th Cir. 
2004) (“[T]he existence of two reasonable, competing 
interpretations is the very definition of ambiguity.” (internal 
quotation marks omitted)). 
The in pari materia canon of statutory interpretation is a 
useful tool for interpreting ambiguous or doubtful statutes.  
But it should not be used to muddle the meaning of unequivocal, 
but inconvenient, black letter law.  Our rule is “What is clear 
in one statute may be called upon in aid to explain what is 
doubtful in another.”  Wells Fargo Bank, 142  at 450, 420 Hawai‘i
P.3d at 381 (emphasis added).  It is not: “What is clear in one 13 
 statute may be called upon to create doubt in another.”  As the 
Supreme Court explained in Barnes v. Philadelphia & R.R. Co., 84 
U.S. 294 (1872):  
Where a section or clause of a statute is ambiguous, much 
aid, it is admitted, may be derived in ascertaining its meaning by comparing the section or clause in question with 
prior statutes in pari materiâ, but it cannot be admitted 
that such a resort is a proper one where the language 
employed by the legislature is plain and free of all 
uncertainty, as the true rule in such a case is to hold that the statute speaks its own construction.
 
 
Id. at 302.  See also United States v. Broncheau, 645 F.3d 676, 
685 (4th Cir. 2011) (“The principle of in pari materia is 
applicable . . . only where the meaning of a statute is 
ambiguous or doubtful.” (cleaned up)); State ex rel. Clay v. 
Cuyahoga Cty. Med. Exam’r’s Office, 94 N.E.3d 498, 503 (Ohio 
2017) (explaining that the in pari materia canon was not applicable where the court could not “after reading the statute 
and giving the words the legislature chose their plain and 
ordinary meanings, find that the words of the statute are 
ambiguous”). 
 HRS § 801-1 “speaks its own construction.”  And because it 
is unambiguous on its face about what the State must do before 
it may subject a defendant to trial and sentencing, we cannot 
use an in pari materia reading to nullify its plain meaning. 14 
 B. A defendant becomes subject to trial and sentencing at 
arraignment  
 
To the extent that there is any ambiguity to be found in 
HRS § 801-1, it is in the phrase “subject to trial and 
sentencing.”  “Subject to trial and sentencing” could mean the 
start of trial.  But it could also mean some earlier point in 
the criminal prosecution where the specters of adjudication and 
possibly punishment are concrete enough that the defendant is 
“subject to” them. 
 We hold that defendants are subject to “be tried and 
sentenced to be punished” at arraignment.  There is no way for a 
defendant to leave an arraignment without being “subject to be tried” (if the defendant has pled not guilty) or “subject to be 
sentenced to be punished” (if the defendant has pled guilty). 
   501, 513, 431 P.3d 1274, 1286 Cf. State v. Hernandez, 143 Hawai‘i
(2018) (recognizing that “a guilty plea in itself is a 
conviction” (cleaned up)).  By demanding a plea of either 
“guilty” or “not guilty,” the law subjects defendants to be 
either tried or sentenced at arraignment. So under HRS § 801-1, 
the State may initiate a felony prosecution via complaint, but 
it should secure an indictment or information (if applicable) 15 
 before arraignment. ,1413 
C. HRS § 801-1 has not been repealed by implication 
There are only two ways that a law may repeal an earlier 
statute “by implication.”  The first is if the two laws are plainly irreconcilable; the second is “if the later act covers 
the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as 
a substitute.”  See Gardens at W. Maui Vacation Club v. Cty. of 
Maui, 90 Hawai‘ i 334, 341, 978 P.2d 772, 779 (1999) (cleaned up); 
see also Fasi v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 50 Haw. 277, 285, 439 
P.2d 206, 211 (1968) (explaining that repeal by implication occurs when a latter act “is exclusive, that is, when it covers 
the whole subject to which it relates, and is manifestly 
designed by the legislature to embrace the entire law on the 
subject” (emphasis added)).  We have never recognized implicit 
repeal by implication absent direct conflict between statutes or 
                                                 
13  Federal cases concerning the use of informations to initiate federal 
felony prosecutions provide support for this approach.  Unlike article I, 
section 10, the Fifth Amendment prohibits holding defendants to answer 
without a grand jury indictment.  But several courts have held that the 
government may still initiate federal prosecutions —
 and satisfy statutes of 
limitations — with an information; the Fifth Amendment just means that there 
needs to be a grand jury indictment before the defendant can be required to 
plead or be subjected to trial.  See United States v. Burdix- Dana, 149 F.3d 
741, 742 (7th Cir. 1998) (recognizing that “ absence of a valid waiver of 
prosecution by indictment bars the acceptance of a guilty plea or a trial on 
the relevant charges” but also holding that filing of information satisfies 
statute of limitations even where indictment is necessary for further 
prosecution); United States v. Rothenberg, 554 F.Supp.3d 1039, 1041 (N.D. 
Cal. 2021) (concluding that information “tolled the statute of limitations” even though defendant had not waived right to grand jury indictment).  
 
14  HRS § 806- 7 also dictates that “[e]very indictment shall be duly found 
by a grand jury before the arraignment of the accused.”  HRS § 806- 7 
(emphasis added). 16 
 evidence that a statute is “manifestly designed” to “cover the 
field” and displace all other law on a subject.   
Repeal by implication is disfavored.  Gardens at W. Maui 
Vacation Club, 90 Hawaiʻ i at 340, 978 P.2d at 778.15  And “if 
effect can reasonably be given to two statutes, it is proper to presume that the earlier statute is intended to remain in force 
and that the later statute did not repeal it.”  State v. 
Pacariem, 67 Haw. 46, 47, 677 P.2d 463, 465 (1984). 
Here, the State has not shown that article I, section 10 or 
any of the other authorities it cites are either “plainly irreconcilable” with HRS § 801-1 or manifestly designed by the 
legislature to “cover the field” and embrace the entire law on the initiation of felony prosecutions. 
The State is right that HRPP Rules 5 and 7 — which 
authorize the use of the complaint-and-preliminary-hearing 
process to initiate felony prosecutions — flatly contradict HRS 
§ 801-1.  But these are rules made by the Supreme Court, not 
laws enacted by the legislature.  These rules may have the force 
of law, but they may never “abridge, enlarge, or modify the substantive rights of any litigant.”  HRS § 602-11.  As we 
explained in Cox v. Cox, “[w]here a court-made rule affecting

None of the constitutional or statutory authorities the 
State cites directly conflict with HRS § 801-1.  Not article I, 
                                                 
16  See also Hernandez, 143 Hawai‘i at 510 n.14, 431 P.3d at 1283 n.14 (“It 
is self- evident that while a court rule may provide an exception to another 
court rule, this exception would have no effect upon [a] statutory or 
constitutional right . . . .”). 
 
17  Caselaw interpreting HRS § 602- 11 makes clear that a right need not 
come from the constitution to be “substantive.”  S ee In re Doe Children, 94 
Hawai‘i 485, 487, 17 P.3d 217, 219 (2001) (holding that statute setting filing 
deadlines conferred substantive right); Cox v. Cox, 138 Hawai‘ i 476, 481, 382 
P.3d 288, 293 (2016) (holding that statute directing the family court to 
consider certain factors in awarding attorney fees conferred substantive 
right).  HRS § 801-1 confers a substantive right in being tried only upon a 
determination of probable cause from a group of ordinary citizens who are “at 
arm’s length” from the judiciary and can serve as a “buffer or referee 
between the Government and the people.”  See United States v. Williams, 504 
U.S. 36, 47 (1992).  18 
 section 10 as amended in 1982.   Not HRS § 805-7  (last amended 
in 1998).  Not HRS § 806-6 or -8 (last amended in 1991).   In 
fact, HRS §§ 805-7, and 806-8 refer to cases that “can be tried 2019 18
                                                 
18  Article I, section 10  places limits  on the government’s power to 
subject a criminal defendant to the stigma, uncertainty, and expense of 
criminal prosecution.  Cf. Monongahela Navigation Co. v. U.S. , 148 U.S. 312, 
325 (1893) (describing the Fifth Amendment as “a series of negations, denials 
of right or power in the government”).  Because of article I, section 10, the 
government could not, for example, force someone to plead “guilty” or “not 
guilty” to criminal charges based on the results of a social media poll.  But 
the section does not limit the legislature’s ability to place checks on the 
government’s power to prosecute beyond those imposed by the constitution.  
Cf. State v. Maldonado, 108 Hawai‘ i 436, 444, 121 P.3d  901, 909 (2005) 
(“[W]here the legislature has enacted a valid statute that provides greater 
protection than the constitution, conformance to the statutory mandate, and 
not the lower reasonableness standard set forth by the state or federal constitution, is required.”) .  HRS § 801- 1 places restrictions on the 
government’s power to prosecute beyond those found in the constitution.  But that does not mean it “conflicts” with the constitution.  The legislature is 
free to augment or duplicate the rights afforded by the constitution with 
statutory entitlements.  And it has done just that with HRS § 801- 1.  The 
statute reflects clear legislative intent that — in addition to whatever 
constitutional rights they may have under article I, section 10 — certain 
defendants also have a d iscrete statutory entitlement to face trial and 
sentencing only upon an indictment. 
 
19  HRS § 805- 7 identifies the circumstances in which a district court must 
hold probable cause hearings, but nothing in the statute suggests that the 
State may try and sentence a defendant based solely on a district court’s 
probable cause determination.  To the contrary, the statute explicitly 
recognizes that there are certain crimes that “can be tried only on indictment by a grand jury”: 
 
In all cases of arrest for offenses that must be tried in the first instance before a jury, or that can be tried only 
on indictment by a grand jury, the judge in whose 
jurisdiction or on whose warrant the accused was arrested, upon the appearance of the accused, shall proceed to 
consider whether there is probable cause to believe that the 
accused is guilty of the offense with which the accused is 
charged. 
 
HRS § 805- 7 
 (emphasis added). 
 
20  The HRPP recognize that felonies may be charged with complaints where 
the defendant has waived the right
 to an indictment.  See, e.g. HRPP Rule 
7(b)(3).  The references in HRS §§ 806- 6, -7, and - 8 to the charging of 
felonies by complaint do not conflict with HRS § 801- 1 when they are read as 
referring to felonies charged by complaint pursuant to HRPP Rule 7(b)(3). 
 19 
 only on indictment by a grand jury” (HRS § 805-7) or “in which 
the accused may be held to answer without an indictment by a 
grand jury” (HRS § 806-8).  HRS § 806-8 is even titled 
“[p]rosecution where indictment not essential.”  The State does 
not explain how a statute with a title that contemplates the 
possibility that indictments are, in some circumstances, 
essential for prosecution could directly conflict with a statute 
providing that indictments are, in some circumstances, essential for prosecution. 
 The State’s claim that article I, section 10, HRS § 805-7, 
or HRS § 806-6 or -8 implicitly repeal HRS § 801-1 by “covering 
the field” is similarly without merit. 
 Article I, section 10 cannot “cover the field” because it 
is manifestly not intended to embrace the entire law on the 
initiation of criminal prosecutions in our state.  It is a 
single sentence.  It establishes a constitutional floor for 
prosecutions, and “indicates” the general principle that defendants should not be prosecuted without a probable cause 
determination from an independent factfinder; but it does not 
“lay[] down rules by means of which those principles may be 
given the force of law.”  See DW Aina Le‘ a Dev., LLC v. State 
Land Use Comm’n, 148 Hawai‘ i 396, 403, 477 P.3d 836, 843 (2020). 
A single sentence is no substitute for the tangle of laws 
that came before it concerning the initiation of felony 20 
 prosecutions.  The 1982 amendment of article I, section 10, 
then, made the repeal of HRS § 801-1 possible, but did not 
effectuate that repeal by “covering the field” and providing a 
comprehensive new procedural framework for charging felonies 
through the complaint and preliminary hearing process. 
 None of the other one-off statutes the State cites as “implicitly repealing” HRS § 801-1 constitute such a framework 
either.  These are standalone statutes that deal with piecemeal 
aspects of prosecution.  They concern “Commitment; form of 
mittimus” (HRS § 805-7’s title) and oblige the State to furnish defendants with a copy of a complaint or indictment before 
arraignment (HRS § 806-6).  They do not embrace the entire law 
on the initiation of a felony prosecution. 
HRS § 801-1’s history can be traced to 1869, when the 
Kingdom of Hawai‘ i adopted a law requiring grand jury indictments 
for most prosecutions.
21  And America’s “[f]ounders thought the 
grand jury so essential to basic liberties that they provided in 
the Fifth Amendment that federal prosecution for serious crimes 
can only be instituted by a presentment or indictment of a Grand 
                                                 
21  The 1869 version of this law enacted in the Hawaiian Kingdom’s penal 
code was nearly identical to HRS § 801- 1: it exempted offenses within the 
jurisdiction of a “police court or district justice” from the indictment 
requirement whereas HRS § 801- 1 exempts offenses within the “jurisdiction of 
a district court.”  Haw. Kingdom Penal Code 1869, Chapter 2 § 2.

 Jury.”  United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 343 (1974) 
(cleaned up)).   
The grand jury “infuses our system of justice with a 
democratic ethos because ordinary citizens serve as grand 
jurors.”  State v. Vega-Larregui, 248 A.3d 1224, 1239 (N.J. 
2021) (cleaned up)).  It “functions as a barrier to reckless or unfounded charges.”  State v. Kahlbaun, 64 Haw. 197, 203, 638 
P.2d 309, 315 (1981).  And it serves as a “shield against 
arbitrary or oppressive action” by ensuring “that serious 
criminal accusations will be brought only upon the considered 
judgment of a representative body of citizens acting under oath 
and under judicial instruction and guidance.”  Id. (quoting 
United States v. Mandujano, 425 U.S. 564, 571 (1976)).  Put 
plainly, HRS § 801-1 guarantees that the State may only 
prosecute someone for one of Hawai‘ i’s most serious offenses if 
it has an indictment from “ordinary citizens” and not just a 
determination of probable cause from a single judge. 
If the Legislature wants to strip people of the grand jury 
protections afforded by HRS § 801-1, it is free to do so.  It may expressly repeal HRS § 801-1.  It may pass a law in direct 
conflict with HRS § 801-1.  It may develop a new comprehensive 
statutory framework controlling initiation of felony 
prosecutions and indicate that its framework applies “any law to 
the contrary notwithstanding.”  See Fasi, 50 Haw. at 285, 439 22 
 P.2d at 211 (holding that statute which used the introductory 
clause “[a]ny law to the contrary notwithstanding” was 
“manifest[ly]” designed to “cover the entire field” on its 
topic.)  But it cannot undo the substantive right to a grand 
jury indictment conferred by HRS § 801-1 with a “housekeeping 
measure” that sprinkles the word “complaint” throughout a few 
statutes.22 
D. The State’s prosecution of Obrero is unlawful under HRS 
§ 801-1 
 
The felonies Obrero is charged with are not within the 
jurisdiction of the district court and may not be charged by 
information.  So under HRS § 801-1, Obrero cannot be arraigned 
on the charges absent a grand jury indictment.  Because the 
State’s prosecution of Obrero proceeded beyond arraignment based on a complaint and probable cause hearing alone, it is unlawful 
under HRS § 801-1.  The charges against Obrero should be 
dismissed without prejudice.
23 
                                                 
22  Especially not where, as discussed above, those statutes explicitly 
contemplate that some cases may only be tried on an indictment.  See, e.g.
, 
HRS § 806- 8 (referring to cases “in which the accused may be held to answer 
without an indictment by a grand jury”). 
  
23  This conclusion is justified for the reasons set forth in this opinion.  
But it is hardly the only conclusion that a competent lawyer could arrive at 
after reading HRS § 801- 1 and considering other related authorities 
concerning the initiation of felony prosecutions.  Some of the sharpest legal 
minds disagree with our holding in this case.  See
 dissent.  So our 
conclusion that the plain language of HRS § 801- 1 obliged the State to secure 
an indictment before subjecting Obrero to trial and sentencing does not mean that a defense lawyer who declined to move for the dismissal of charges for failure to comply with HRS § 801- 1 fell below the “range of competence 
demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.”  See State v. Salavea, 147 Hawai‘ i 
564, 576, 465 P.3d 1011, 1023 (2020). 23 
 IV. CONCLUSION 
The State cannot subject Obrero to trial and sentencing 
without a grand jury indictment.  See HRS § 801-1. 
We reverse the circuit court’s denial of Obrero’s motion to 
dismiss and remand this case to the circuit court for 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
