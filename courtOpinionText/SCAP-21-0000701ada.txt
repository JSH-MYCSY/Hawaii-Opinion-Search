 2 Statutes (HRS) § 23-5 (2009 & Supp. 2014) and the attorney-
client privilege, codified in HRS Chapter 626.   
 The Office of the Auditor believes HRS § 23-5 empowers it 
to receive all records of an auditee, even attorney-client 
communications.  The Office of Hawaiian Affairs, the subject of 
an audit, sued.  It argues HRS § 626-1, Rule 503 (2016), the 
lawyer-client privilege, overcomes the auditor’s authority and 
preserves the confidentiality of attorney-client communications.  We hold that the Office of the Auditor lacks authority to 
pierce the attorney-client privilege and obtain an auditee’s 
confidential communications. 
 We also reject the Office of the Auditor’s jurisdiction and 
non-justiciability bars to the Office of Hawaiian Affairs’ suit.  
I. 
 In 2019 the Hawaiʻ i
 Legislature directed an audit of the 
Office of Hawaiian Affairs.  Act 37, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs Appropriations Act of 2019, conditioned the release of 
OHA’s 2020-2021 general funds upon the legislature’s receipt of 
an audit report “no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular session[] of 2020.”  2019 Haw. Sess. 
Laws Act 37, § 9 at 97.  
Per this legislative directive, Defendants Leslie H. Kondo, 
in his official capacity as State Auditor, and the State of 
Hawai
‘i Office of the Auditor, began an audit of Plaintiffs, the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 3 Office of Hawaiian Affairs and the Board of Trustees of the 
Office of Hawaiian Affairs (collectively, OHA). 
The Auditor asked OHA to hand over lots of records.  One 
tranche requested OHA’s unredacted executive sessions minutes 
from 2006-2019.  Because the executive session minutes contained 
privileged attorney-client communications, OHA proposed giving 
the Auditor redacted minutes.   
This dissatisfied the Auditor.  The Office of the Auditor 
has unlimited power to access all OHA records, he told OHA.  The Auditor’s authority extends to OHA’s privileged attorney-client 
communications.  In an email to OHA, Kondo outlined his stance: 
“It is our position that section 23-5, HRS, provides us with the 
authority to access all records maintained by an auditee, 
including attorney-client communication[s] and other records 
that are not accessible by the public, like minutes to executive 
sessions.”  
 OHA resisted.  Kondo repeated his position: per HRS § 23-5, “we have access to all records, with no exception[s].”  In turn, 
OHA recapped its position: the law lets the Auditor access 
records, but attorney-client communications are off-limits.  OHA 
gave the Auditor all requested executive session minutes with 
redactions for confidential attorney-client privileged 
information. 
A stalemate ensued.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 4 Then the Auditor packed up his audit, explaining in a late 
December 2020 letter to OHA that he could not finish the audit 
without OHA’s attorney-client communications.  Unless he had 
access to the unredacted executive session minutes, Kondo wrote, 
there was “an unreasonable risk” that the Office of the 
Auditors’ “findings, conclusions, and recommendations may be 
based on improper or incomplete information.” 
Before suspending the audit, Kondo told OHA that he had 
“the ability to if necessary to subpoena records, or subpoena people” but that “I don’t believe we ever need to pull that 
trigger for a State Agency.  I believe a State Agency must 
cooperate.”  Ultimately, Kondo chose not to use his subpoena 
power. 
No audit report was prepared.  So OHA did not receive its 
2020-2021 general funds.  Later though, in 2021, the legislature 
amended Act 37 to remove the audit precondition and released the 
previous year’s general funds allocation to OHA.  See 2021 Haw. 
Sess. Laws Act 29, § 8 at 50.   
 After the suspension of the audit, but before OHA received 
the funds, OHA sued Kondo and the Office of the Auditor.  In 
February 2020, OHA filed a two-count complaint for declaratory 
relief in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.
  
Count 1 sought a declaratory judgment that the Auditor 
violated Act 37 by failing to submit an audit report.  Later, by *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 5 stipulation, the circuit court dismissed this count in October 
2021. 
As to Count 2, OHA sought a declaratory judgment “that 
neither HRS Chapter 23 nor the Hawai‘ i State Constitution 
requires OHA to disclose to the State Auditor privileged attorney-client communications protected from disclosure.”
 
 OHA moved for summary judgment.  OHA argued that HRS § 23-5 does not allow the Auditor to look at its privileged attorney-
client communications.  
The Office of the Auditor moved for judgment on the 
pleadings.  It argued that HRS § 23-5 gave the Auditor authority 
to access 
all auditee records.  Kondo also moved to dismiss 
based on lack of jurisdiction and several non-justiciability 
doctrines: standing, mootness, no advisory opinions, and 
political question. 
 Before ruling on the motions, Circuit Court Judge Jeffrey 
Crabtree reviewed OHA’s redacted and unredacted executive 
sessions minutes in camera.  The court “saw the issue of in 
camera review as related to defendant’s motion to dismiss” for lack of jurisdiction, explaining that “by actually determining 
the factual and legal status of the redacted documents as 
attorney-client privileged material, the court has resolved an 
important issue and can move forward without risk of issuing a 
hypothetical ruling based on ‘if’ or ‘assuming’ the redacted *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 6 documents are protected by the attorney-client privilege.” 
Nearly all the redactions were attorney-client communications, 
the court found.  
The circuit court sided with OHA, granting its motion for 
summary judgment and denying the Auditor’s motion for judgment 
on the pleadings.  HRS § 626-1, Rule 503 controlled, not HRS 
§ 23-5, the court ruled:  
[T]he key legal issue here is whether HRS [§] 23- 5 or 
Chapter 626, and in particular Rule 503, wins if it’s an 
arm wrestle match between those two statutes. . . .  
[T]here’s good arguments on both sides, but I’m siding in favor of Rule 503 being more specific and more controlling 
than 23- 5 is . . . .  I think there’s true value in 
protecting the attorney- client privilege. 
 
 In September 2020, the circuit court issued a minute order 
and short-form orders that granted OHA’s motion and denied the 
Auditor’s motion.  The minute order detailed the court’s 
document review and explained its decision: 
 There is no question whatsoever that the vast 
majority of the redactions are attorney- client 
communications.  The un- redacted portions show Board 
members discussing all manner of legal issues with their 
counsel present.  This includes but is not limited to items 
on the Board’s public agenda, including updates from 
counsel about ongoing litigation, confidential personnel 
issues, legal authority necessary or helpful to guide Board 
decision- making, and much more.  The redacted information 
is confidential by law (e.g., OHA is entitled to move into 
Executive Session to discuss it), and clearly covered by 
the attorney- client privilege as well.   
 
The court entered a final judgment for OHA in November 2021. 
The Office of the Auditor appealed.  Then OHA applied for 
transfer to this court, and we accepted.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 7 Kondo argues there is no subject matter jurisdiction and 
offers his non-justiciability arguments.  
About the merits, Kondo says HRS § 23-5 empowers him to 
review all OHA records.  He acknowledges that OHA’s executive 
session minutes contain privileged attorney-client 
communications.  But all has no exceptions: “There is no carve-
out for privileged records.[]”  Kondo also maintains that 
disclosure to the Office of the Auditor does not waive the attorney-client privilege because it is “mandatory, not 
voluntary.”  Kondo asks us to reverse the circuit court’s orders 
and judgment. 
OHA counters that the circuit court got it right.  OHA may 
seek judicial relief and has the right to shield its attorney-
client communications from the Auditor’s prying eyes.  OHA 
rejects the Auditor’s waiver of privilege position.  Handing 
over its privileged communications without a court order 
constitutes a voluntary disclosure and waives the attorney-client privilege, asserts OHA. 
II. 
 First, we address the Office of the Auditors’ non-
justiciability arguments.  We hold that our courts have 
jurisdiction, and there are no justiciability barriers to OHA’s 
case. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 8  Hawaiʻi has a declaratory action framework that advances 
access to the justice system.  HRS Chapter 632’s purpose is to 
“afford relief from the uncertainty and insecurity attendant upon controversies over legal rights . . . with a view to making 
the courts more serviceable to the people.”  HRS § 632-6 (2016).  
Our declaratory action laws are “liberally interpreted and 
administered.”  Id.  
 In declaratory actions, HRS § 632-1(a) (2016) covers subject matter jurisdiction, and HRS § 632-1(b) covers standing.  
See Tax Found. of Hawaiʻ i v. State, 144 Hawaiʻ i 175, 186–88, 439 
P.3d 127, 138–40 (2019). 
Declaratory actions require an “actual controversy.”  HRS 
§ 632-1(a).  Otherwise, there is no subject matter jurisdiction.  
Tax Found., 144 Hawai‘ i at 19
2-94, 439 P.3d at 144-46.  A party 
cannot simulate a dispute or make-up a hypothetical.  Id. at 
196, 439 P.3d at 148. 
The Office of the Auditor asserts that OHA’s “real 
controversy” involves others.  “If the funds were not released, 
it was because of the way the Legislature wrote the provisos in 
Act 37, or because the executive branch exercised its authority 
on the release, non-release, or partial release of funds, and 
not due to the suspension of the audit.”  Also, because OHA just 
wanted the general funds, and ultimately got the money, there is 
no jurisdiction, the Auditor says.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 9 The Auditor overlooks count 2.  The parties stipulated to 
dismiss count 1.  The case no longer concerns the Auditor’s 
suspension of the audit and OHA’s general funds.   
Count 2 remains.  OHA and the Auditor’s quarrel concerns 
statutory interpretation, classic fare for declaratory actions. 
“Controversies involving the interpretation of . . . statutes” 
may be determined by the courts.  HRS § 632-1(a).  Hawaiʻ i’s 
declaratory action law also broadly allows declaratory relief 
“in other situations involving other antagonistic assertions or 
denial of rights.”  See Tax Found., 144 Hawaiʻ i at 193, 439 P.3d 
at 145.   
OHA’s suit involves the Office of the Auditor’s statutory 
power under HRS § 23-5 and Hawaiʻ i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 
503, the lawyer-client privilege, codified in HRS Chapter 626.  
The dispute is real, not conjectural.  Count 2 presents a 
prototypical declaratory action.  There is an actual 
controversy.  Our courts have jurisdiction. 
Next, standing.  Standing is about the role of courts in a 
democratic society – a service to our tripartite system that 
favors the courtroom as a space to resolve controversy.  Life of 
the Land v. Land Use Comm’n, 63 Haw. 166, 172, 623 P.2d 431, 438 
(1981).  Standing has a prudential spirit.  Tax Found., 144 
Hawaiʻi at 196, 439 P.3d at 148.     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 10 HRS § 632-1(b) covers standing in declaratory actions.  Id.  
This court has detailed when a party has standing to bring an 
action for declaratory relief: 
(1) . . . antagonistic claims exist between the parties 
 
 (i) that indicate imminent and inevitable 
litigation, or 
 
 (ii) where the party seeking declaratory relief has 
a concrete interest in a legal relation, status, 
right, or privilege that is challenged or denied by 
the other party, who has or asserts a concrete 
interest in the same legal relation, status, right, 
or privilege; and  
 
(2) a declaratory judgment will serve to terminate the 
uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding. 
 
Id. at 201, 439 P.3d at 153.   
   OHA’s complaint satisfies both the “imminent and 
inevitable” and “concrete interest” paths to standing.  
 OHA has a concrete interest in safeguarding its attorney-
client communications.  And it has an interest to see if its 
privilege claim stands up against the Auditor’s interest that 
HRS § 23-5 requires disclosure.  The controversy is real.   
Turning to the law’s “imminent and inevitable” disjunctive, 
because he never issued a subpoena duces tecum, the Auditor argues that litigation was not inevitable.  Litigation is only 
imminent and inevitable, if he “pulls the trigger” and uses his 
subpoena power, Kondo claims.  And because he didn’t, OHA lacks 
standing.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 11  OHA’s complaint anticipates the Auditor’s argument:   
This action is justiciable because litigation is imminent 
and inevitable either because the State Auditor will attempt to exercise his subpoena power under HRS section 
23-5(c)and OHA will move to quash, or OHA will file an 
action to prospectively enjoin the State Auditor from exercising his subpoena power to obtain OHA’s attorney-
client privileged communications. 
 
OHA says that if the Auditor issues a subpoena duces tecum for 
its unredacted executive session minutes, then it will counter 
with a Hawaiʻ i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 45 motion to 
quash.  See HRS § 23-5(c) (“Upon application by the auditor” 
circuit court may enforce subpoena “in the same manner as a 
subpoena issued by the clerk of the circuit court.”).  OHA’s 
complaint also signals it will seek declaratory and injunctive relief.  OHA satisfies both HRS § 632-1(b)(1) disjunctives.   
The Auditor’s decision not to subpoena OHA’s records is 
odd.  The legislature has given the Auditor subpoena power.  See 
HRS § 23-5(c) (auditor may issue a subpoena duces tecum “compelling the production of accounts, books, records, files, 
papers, documents, or other evidence, which the auditor 
reasonably believes may relate to an audit or other 
investigation being conducted under this chapter.”).  If, as the Auditor asserts, the audit “may be based on improper or incomplete information” and cannot be prepared unless he views 
OHA’s privileged attorney-client communications, then there is 
no good reason for the Office of the Auditor to ditch the very *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 12 tool that might pry information from OHA.  The Auditor gives no 
explanation.   
 Ultimately, the Auditor’s choice left OHA with only one 
option.  OHA sued for declaratory relief.  A declaratory 
judgment will terminate the uncertainty underlying the legal 
issue.  OHA has standing.  
Turning to mootness, a case becomes moot when “it has lost 
its character as a present, live controversy of the kind that 
must exist if courts are to avoid advisory opinions on abstract 
propositions of law.”  Kaho‘ ohanoh ano v. State, 114 Hawai‘ i  302, 
332, 162 P.3d 696, 726 (2007).   
The Office of the Auditor argues that the case became moot 
once “OHA decided to withhold the unredacted minutes and the 
Auditor suspended the audit.”  We disagree. 
Because OHA’s requested relief focuses on its attorney-
client privilege - not the suspension of the audit or the 
appropriation and release of funds – the case is live, not moot.  
The Auditor packing up the audit, or the legislature reinstating 
the funds, has nothing to do with count 2.  Since OHA asks for a declaratory judgment about the confidentiality of its privileged 
communications, the effective remedy remains and has not been 
compromised.  Wong v. Bd. of Regents, Univ. of Hawaiʻ i, 62 Haw. 
391, 394, 616 P.2d 201, 203–04 (1980). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 13 The case is not moot.  But we address an exception to the 
mootness doctrine.  OHA satisfies each step of the “public 
interest exception.”  
The public interest exception applies when the issue 
“affects the public interest and an authoritative determination 
is desirable for the guidance of public officials.”  See 
Kaho‘ohanohano, 114 Hawai‘ i at 333, 162 P.3d at 727.  This court 
applies the public interest exception when (1) public, not private, interests are affected; (2) guidance for public 
officers is sensible; and (3) the issue is apt to repeat.  Id.  
Here, the exception applies.  First, this is a clash 
between two constitutionally created state government agencies.  
Article XII section 5 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution established the 
Office of Hawaiian Affairs, and article VII, section 10 
established the Office of the Auditor.  Not only does the public 
have an interest in resolving a dispute between these two state 
heavyweights, but the issue presented – interpretation of major 
statutes – also has public importance.  
 
 Second, this case offers a chance to guide public officers.  
It will clarify how the Office of the Auditor and an auditee 
tread when disclosure of privileged communications is at stake.     
Third, this issue is apt to resurface.  The Auditor 
regularly conducts audits of agencies and issues reports.  Because the Office of the Auditor maintains that it has *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 14 authority to review attorney-client communications, the 
Auditor’s authority will likely arise in future audits. 
OHA and the Office of the Auditor are themselves likely to 
tangle again.  At least every four years they interact.  “The 
auditor shall conduct an audit of [OHA] at least once every four 
years.”  HRS § 10-14.55 (2009).  There is no reason to think the 
stalemate will not repeat. 
Mootness and the no advisory opinion doctrine are closely 
related non-justiciability doctrines.  Here we conclude that there is no advisory opinion about an abstract proposition of 
law.  Kaho‘ ohanohano , 114 Hawaiʻ i at 332, 162 P.3d at 726.  
Next, we address the argument that the case concerns a 
political question.   A non-justiciable political question involves an issue that 
is more appropriate for the executive or legislative branch.  
Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 210 (1962) (“[t]he 
nonjusticiability of a political question is primarily a function of the separation of powers”).  The political question 
doctrine bars issues that are too political to embroil the judiciary.  Trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. 
Yamasaki, 69 Haw. 154, 172, 737 P.2d 446, 456-57 (1987).   
We reject Kondo’s argument that there are no “judicially 
discoverable and manageable standards” to evaluate the case.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 15 Baker, 369 U.S. at 217 (detailing this standard and five more 
criteria to govern the wisdom of judicial intervention.)    
OHA asks us to decide whether HRS § 23-5 allows the Auditor 
access to OHA’s privileged attorney-client communications.  
Statutory interpretation is the judiciary’s forte, central to 
its mission.  A legal ruling does not intrude on another 
governmental branch. 
Also, the legislature outlines a process (issue subpoenas 
duces tecum) to resolve disputes regarding materials withheld by an audit’s subject.  See HRS § 23-5(c).  The statute itself 
suggests there are judicially manageable standards to end the dispute.   
Lastly, the Office of the Auditor does not have sovereign 
immunity. 
“The State’s sovereign immunity does not bar actions 
seeking prospective declaratory or injunctive relief.”  Gold 
Coast Neighborhood Ass’n v. State, 140 Hawaiʻ i 437, 464, 403 P.3d 
214, 241 (2017)).  OHA’s relief is prospective.  OHA’s complaint 
asks for a ruling that Hawaiʻ i law protects the disclosure of its 
privileged communications during any
 state audit.  Also, because 
Count 2 asks for declaratory relief, not compensation, the 
Office of the Auditor has no sovereign immunity.  Pele Def. Fund 
v. Paty, 73 Haw. 578, 609-10, 837 P.2d 1247, 1266 (1992). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 16 III. 
We go to the merits. 
OHA seeks a declaratory judgment that HRS § 23-5 does not 
require it to “disclose to the State Auditor privileged 
attorney-client communications protected from disclosure 
pursuant to HRE 503 and common-law principles.” 
The Office of the Auditor opposes declaratory relief.  It 
points to HRS § 23-5, titled “Auditor; powers” and claims it has 
power to obtain an auditee’s privileged attorney-client 
communications.  The Auditor “may examine and inspect all 
accounts, books, records, files, papers, and documents and all 
financial affairs of every . . . agency.”  HRS § 23-5(a). 
 Kondo believes those words – primarily one word, all  –
confer “unlimited” power.  He says HRS § 23-5 allows him to review all auditee records in their entirety, even attorney-
client communications.  No exceptions, all means all.  Plus, the 
Auditor insists, he does not need to use his subpoena power to obtain the records.  See HRS § 23-5(c)(2) (auditor may “compel[] 
the production of accounts, books, records, files, papers, documents or other evidence, which the auditor reasonably 
believes may relate to an audit or other investigation being 
conducted under this chapter.”) *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 17 A. 
 The Auditor contends that HRS § 23-5 and HRE Rule 503 do 
not conflict.  And because there is no conflict, the Auditor’s 
superior powers snap the attorney-client privilege.  But “even 
if the two statutes did conflict,” the Auditor adds, HRS § 23-5 
is “more specific” and prevails over HRE Rule 503 that way too.  
 We reject the Office of the Auditor’s position.   
 We hold that unless an audit’s subject waives the attorney-client privilege, or a court orders disclosure, the Office of 
the Auditor may not access an auditee’s privileged attorney-
client communications.   
 Generally, two laws conflict when they “are explicitly 
contrary to, or inconsistent with, each other.”  Boyd v. Hawaii 
State Ethics Comm’n, 138 Hawaiʻ i 218, 227, 378 P.3d 934, 943 
(2016) (cleaned up) (charter school employee subject to two 
distinct statutory regimes as to standards involving conflicts 
of interest).  But if laws can be interpreted harmoniously, 
there is no conflict.  “Two statutes conflict where it is not 
possible to give effect to both.”  Carmichael v. Bd. of Land & 
Nat. Res., 150 Hawaiʻ i 547, 567, 506 P.3d 211, 231 (2022)  
(cleaned up).   
 The two laws in this case do not conflict.  The Auditor’s 
powers and the attorney-client privilege can coexist.  The laws are not explicitly contrary or inconsistent.  And courts (like *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 18 the circuit court here) can read HRE Rule 503 and HRS § 23-5 in 
harmony, giving effect to both statutes.  The laws do not need 
to incompatibly collide.  HRS § 23-5 says so.   
HRS § 23-5 has a buffer to address privileged 
communications.  HRS § 23-5(c) gives the Auditor subpoena duces 
tecum power and directs a circuit court to enforce it “in the 
same manner as a subpoena issued by the clerk of the circuit 
court.”  That is, per HRCP Rule 45, “the court, upon motion . . . may (1) quash or modify the subpoena if it is 
unreasonable and oppressive . . . .”    
HRS § 23-5 anticipates challenges to a subpoena’s validity.  
The law’s language foreshadows grounds - like privileges - that 
may curb the auditor’s power to access records.  The Auditor’s 
authority “is hemmed by the constitution and the safeguards of 
the statute itself.”  In re KAHEA, 150 Hawaiʻ i
 43, 51, 497 P.3d 
58, 66 (2021) (referring to the Attorney General’s subpoena 
power).  A subpoena that seeks an auditee’s privileged attorney-
client communications is an uncomplicated candidate for court 
quashing or modifying.  HRS § 23-5 and in the end, the court, limit the Auditor.   
 This check also springs from the attorney-client 
privilege’s centuries-long permanence.  It “is the oldest of the 
privileges for confidential communications known to the common 
law.”  Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981) *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 19 (citing 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 2290 (McNaughton rev. 1961)).  
HRE Rule 503, the “Lawyer-client privilege,” codifies the common 
law attorney-client privilege.  A client may invoke that 
privilege to prevent disclosure of “confidential communications 
made for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of 
professional legal services . . . .”  HRS § 626-1, Rule 503.  
 The privilege’s singular value means that only waiver, see 
HRE Rule 511 (2016), or a lawyer-client privilege exception, see 
HRE Rule 503(d) (2016), may allow a court to disclose privileged attorney-client communications.  For government lawyers and 
their agency clients, the Sunshine Law’s narrower attorney-
client exception may also result in disclosure.  See HRS § 92-
5(a)(4) (2012) (closed board meeting allowed “[t]o consult with the board’s attorney on questions and issues pertaining to the 
board’s powers, duties, privileges, immunities, and 
liabilities”); Civ. Beat L. Ctr. for the Pub. Int., Inc. v. City 
& Cnty. of Honolulu, 144 Hawaiʻ i 466, 489, 445 P.3d 47, 70 (2019) 
(closed meeting must strictly conform to an exception and 
“executive sessions must be purposeful and unclouded by pretext”). 
 The Auditor claims the court failed to consider whether 
OHA’s invocation of the attorney-client privilege also satisfied 
HRS § 92-5(a)(4).  He contends the circuit court “completely 
glossed over whether a member of the public making the same *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 20 request would have been allowed to see what the Auditor asked to 
see.”  Contrary to Kondo’s assertion, the parties submitted 
supplemental briefing that covered HRS § 92-5(a)(4).  Then, 
after reviewing the redacted materials, the court ruled that 
both § 92(5)(a)(4) and HRE 503 protected OHA’s executive session 
minutes: “The redacted information is confidential by law (e.g., 
OHA is entitled to move into Executive Session to discuss it), 
and clearly covered by the attorney-client privilege as well.”  Returning to the statutes’ interplay, HRS § 23-5 simply 
does not give the Auditor superpower to pop the attorney-client 
privilege.  The Auditor offers no case law to support his 
stance. 
 The Auditor also argues that HRS § 23-5 prevails because it 
is more specific.  But a specificity argument is mostly 
unhelpful when there is no conflict and the laws can be 
harmonized.  Mahiai v. Suwa, 69 Haw. 349, 356–57, 742 P.2d 359, 
366 (1987) (courts favor a specific law over a general law when 
there is an irreconcilable conflict, however, when the statutes 
“overlap in their application, effect will be given to both if 
possible”) (citing State v. Kuuku, 61 Haw. 79, 82, 595 P.2d 291, 
294 (1979)). 
Some laws are powerhouses.  Here, even if the laws are 
inconsistent, HRS § 626-3’s direct language supports the 
attorney-client privilege’s supremacy.  “If any other provision *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 21 of law, including any rule promulgated by the supreme court, is 
inconsistent with this chapter, this chapter shall govern unless 
this chapter or such inconsistent provision of law specifically 
provides otherwise.”  HRS § 626-3 (2016) (emphasis added).  
Nothing in chapter 626 allows the Auditor (or anyone) to 
bulldoze HRE Rule 503.  And nothing in HRS § 23-5 provides an 
express override of the lawyer-client privilege.  So, if the 
statutes conflict, HRS § 626 -1, Rule 503 pins HRS § 23-5.  
Kondo says that reliance on HRS § 626-3 is misplaced.  He 
argues the attorney-client privilege only applies to 
adjudicative proceedings.  The privilege, though, covers 
“confidential communications made for the purpose of 
facilitating the rendition of professional legal services,” HRE 
Rule 503(b).  Naturally, these communications may precede an 
adjudicative proceeding or court case: the lawyer-client 
privilege applies when an individual seeks legal advice “from a 
professional legal advisor in [their] capacity as such.”  Sapp 
v. Wong, 62 Haw. 34, 38, 609 P.2d 137, 140 (1980) (cleaned up)). 
B. 
We turn to the Auditor’s position that OHA does not waive 
its lawyer-client privilege if it discloses confidential 
communications during an audit. 
Society values the secrecy of attorney-client 
communications.  A compact guides these exchanges.  Business, 22 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
government, and the legal system operate within a trusty 
framework that shelters “confidential communications made for 
the purpose of facilitating the rendition of professional legal 
services” between lawyer and client.  HRE Rule 503(b).  Absent 
an understanding that words remain confidential, they may not be
spoken at all.  “The privilege recognizes that sound legal 
advice or advocacy serves public ends and that such advice or 
advocacy depends upon the lawyer’s being fully informed by the 
client.”  Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 389.    
   A public entity must be able to freely and fully consult 
legal counsel.  A government agency is a client worthy of the 
privilege’s protections.  See United States v. Jicarilla Apache 
Nation, 564 U.S. 162, 170 (2011) (quoting Restatement (Third) of 
the Law Governing Lawyers § 74 (2000)) (“[G]overnmental agencies 
and employees enjoy the same privilege as nongovernmental 
counterparts”).   
Like any holder of the privilege, a government client may 
waive the lawyer-client privilege.  “A person upon whom these 
rules confer a privilege against disclosure waives the privilege
if, while holder of the privilege, the person or the person’s 
predecessor voluntarily discloses or consents to disclosure of 
any significant part of the privileged matter.”  HRE Rule 511.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 23 OHA refuses to waive its privilege.  OHA maintains that if 
it caves to the Auditor without a court order, it waives the 
attorney-client privilege. 
 The Auditor insists that OHA does not waive the privilege 
if OHA gives him what he wants.  He points to HRS § 23-9.5 
(2009): “[t]he auditor shall not be required to disclose any 
working papers.”  If Kondo promises OHA he won’t tell anybody, 
his argument seems to run, then OHA hasn’t waived the privilege and should hand over its attorney-client communications.  The 
Auditor also claims that complying with his demands make OHA’s 
disclosure “involuntary,” and thus OHA does not waive its 
privilege. 
Not so.  Just because the auditor “shall not be required to 
disclose” records, does not mean the Auditor will not or cannot 
disclose records containing privileged communications, or will 
not mention privileged communications in an audit report.  Also, 
HRS § 23-5 gives no assurance that any “involuntary” disclosure will withstand challenge and remain confidential.  With no 
protection, OHA’s counsel made the right call – the only one 
consistent with a lawyer’s professional and ethical obligations.  
See Hawaiʻ i
 Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 1.6(a) (“A lawyer 
shall not reveal confidential information relating to the 
representation of a client unless the client consents after 
consultation.”). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
