1 I.
 INTRODUCTION 
   Petitioner Academic Labor United (“ALU”) represents 
graduate student employees of the University of Hawai‘ i who wish 
to engage in collective bargaining.2  ALU brought suit against 
the Board of Regents of the University of Hawai‘ i (“BOR”), the 
Hawai‘i
 Labor Relations Board (“HLRB”) and the State of Hawai‘ i 
(“State”) in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.  ALU 
contends that a pair of 1972 decisions from the Hawaiʻ i Public 
Employment Relations Board (HPERB, predecessor to HLRB) finally 
determined that graduate assistants are not “employees” under 
Hawaiʻi
 Revised Statutes (“HRS”) Chapter 89 - and that these 
decisions thus foreclose
d graduate assistants from exercising 
the collective bargaining rights provided to public employees 
under article XIII, section 2 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution and HRS 
Chapter 89, its implementing legislation.   
   ALU requested declaratory judgments stating that ALU’s members are “persons in public employment” under article XIII, 
section 2, that they are “public employees” under HRS Chapter 
89, and that HLRB’s rules lack any process by which persons in  
 
2  ALU is an “unincorporated association of graduate assistants at 
the University of Hawaiʻ i” that seeks to “organiz[e] graduate assistants for 
the purpose of collective bargaining.”   Petitioners Ashley Hi‘ ilani Sanchez, 
Kawena‘ulaokalā Kapahua, and Cameron Grimm are graduate assistants at the 
University of Hawai‘ i.  Named plaintiffs- appellants and Academic Labor United 
are designated collectively as “ALU.”
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
2 positions previously excluded from collective bargaining may 
seek relief.  The circuit court dismissed the case on 
jurisdictional grounds.  Under HRS § 632-1 (2016), in order to 
exercise jurisdiction over ALU’s action, the circuit court must 
be satisfied that ALU has exhausted its statutory and 
administrative remedies and that declaratory judgment would 
“terminate the uncertainty or controversy.”  The circuit court found that neither requirement had been met and dismissed the 
case without reaching the merits.   
 
  We affirm.  ALU has not exhausted its administrative 
remedies.  HPERB’s 1972 decisions are not final rulings on whether ALU and its members are excluded from HRS Chapter 89.  
Hawai‘i Administrative Rules (“HAR”) § 12-42-9 (effective Feb. 6, 
1981) permits an “interested . . . organization” such as ALU to 
seek a declaratory judgment from HLRB.  Because ALU has not yet 
invoked HAR § 12-42-9 to clarify whether its members are 
“employees” under HRS Chapter 89, it has not exhausted 
administrative remedies, and the circuit court did not have jurisdiction over ALUʻs action.  
II. BACKGROUND 
A.  The Constitutional Right to Collective Bargaining  
  In 1968, the Hawai‘ i Constitution was amended to 
include article XIII, section 2, which gives “[p]ersons in  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
3 public employment” the “right to organize for the purpose of 
collective bargaining as provided by law.”  (Emphasis added.)  
Pursuant to article XIII, section 2, the Hawai‘ i Legislature 
enacted statutes governing how public employees may organize and 
collectively bargain.  See HRS Chapter 89 (titled “Collective 
Bargaining in Public Employment”).     HRS Chapter 89 defined who qualifies as an “employee” 
or “public employee” for the purpose of collective bargaining, 
and required that all persons qualifying as “public employee[s]
” 
under the statute be placed in one of the statutorily defined 
bargaining units.  HRS § 89-2 (2012); HRS § 89-6(a) (Supp. 
2021).  Many of the rights in HRS Chapter 89 belong to the 
unions serving as certified exclusive representatives of the 
bargaining units, not to public employees as individuals.  See 
HRS § 89-8 (2012); HRS § 89-9 (Supp. 2021); HRS § 89-10 (2012) (setting out the rights of the exclusive representatives of the 
statutorily defined bargaining units).   
  To administer HRS Chapter 89, the legislature created the HPERB, which later became the HLRB.
3  HPERB was tasked with 
determining which positions belonged in each statutorily-defined  
 
 3  See 1985 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 251, § 4 at 476- 78 (changing HPERB 
to HLRB). 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
4 bargaining unit, and certifying exclusive representatives for 
all units.  See 1970 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 171, § 5 at 311—13.  
Two of the bargaining units in HRS § 89-6 included employees of 
the University of 
Hawaiʻi.  Unit 7 comprises “[f]aculty of the 
University of Hawai‘ i and the comm
unity college system,”  HRS    
§ 89-6(a)(7) (Supp. 1971), and Unit 8 comprises “[p]ersonnel of 
the University of Hawai‘ i and the community college system, other 
than faculty,”  HRS § 89-6(a)(8) (Supp. 1971).4   
B. HPERB’s 1972 Decisions Determining the Composition of 
Bargaining Units 7 and 8 
In 1972, HPERB initially considered which positions 
should be included in Units 7 and 8, and decided that graduate 
assistants should be excluded from both units.5  Haw. Fed’n of 
Coll. Tchrs., Case No. R-07-12 (HPERB Sept 15, 1972) (Order 
Affirming Hearings Officer’s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of 
Law and Recommendations and Direction of Election) (hereinafter “Decision No. 21: Order”); Haw. Fed’n of Coll. Tchrs., Case No. 
R-08-13 (HPERB Dec. 29, 1972) (Order Affirming Hearing Officer’s

21 and 25.  Compare HRS § 89- 2(7)-(8) (Supp. 1971) with HRS § 89- 2(7)-(8) 
Supp. 1976) and HRS § 89- 2(7)-(8) (Supp. 2021).

“[f]aculty of the University of Hawai‘ i and the community college system,” was 
numbered as Decision No. 21 by HPERB and is hereinafter referred to as 
Decision No. 21.  The decision excluding graduate assistants from Unit 8, 
“[p]ersonnel of the University of Hawai‘ i and the community college system, 
other than faculty,” was numbered as Decision No. 25 by HPERB and is 
hereinafter referred to as Decision No. 25.     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
5 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Recommendations and 
Direction of Election) (hereinafter “Decision No. 25: Order”).  
 
  HPERB Hearings Officer Stephen K. Yamashiro held a hearing on March 15, 1972 and issued his Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law and Recommendations on the positions that 
should be included in Bargaining Unit 7 on July 17, 1972.  
Decision No. 21: Order at 2.  Officer Yamashiro decided that graduate students should not be included in Unit 7.  Haw. Fed’n 
of Coll. Tchrs., Case No. R-07-12 (HPERB Sept 15, 1972) 
(Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendations) 
(hereinafter “Decision No. 21: FOF/COL”) at 23.  He reasoned 
that graduate students “are classified on a different 
compensation schedule,” “the nature of their appointments 
differs substantially from that of the faculty,” and “the nature of the work performed by the graduate assistants differs from 
that performed by the faculty.”  Id.  
  In reaching his decision, Officer Yamashiro found 
persuasive a determination from the Michigan Court of Appeals, 
in which the court had found that medical interns were not 
“public employees” because holding them to be employees would 
“impinge, to some degree, upon the constitutional authority of 
the Regents to control the educational affairs of the student.”   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
6 Decision No. 21, FOF/COL at 22, paraphrasing Regents of Univ. of
Mich. v. Mich. Emp. Rels. Comm’n, 195 N.W.2d 875, 879 (Mich. Ct. 
App. 1972), rev’d sub nom. Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Mich. 
Emp’t Rels. Comm’n, 204 N.W.2d 218 (Mich. 1973).  Officer 
Yamashiro reasoned that excluding graduate assistants from Unit 
7 “entails due regard to the possible infringement upon the 
constitutional authority of the Board of Regents” of the  
 University of 
words, including graduate assistants in Unit 7 would infringe 
upon BOR’s powers under article IX of the constitution (now 
article X), which empowers the BOR to govern the operation of 
 .  Id. at 22.  HPERB adopted Officer6.  Decision No. 21: FOF/COL at 23.  In other

6In 1972, article IX, section 5 of the Hawai‘i Constitution  
provided that: 
There shall be a board of regents of the University 
of Hawaiʻ i, the members of which shall be nominated and, by 
and with the advice and consent of the senate, appointed by 
the governor.  At least part of the membership of the board 
shall represent geographic subdivisions of the State.  The 
board shall have power, in accordance with law, to 
formulate policy, and to exercise control over the 
university through its executive officer, the president of 
the university, who shall be appointed by the board.   
Haw. Const. art IX, § 5 (1972) in Comm. Proposal No. 6 , in 1 
Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of Hawai‘ i of 1978, 
at 792 (1980
) (1 Proceedings) (emphasis added).   
Article IX was renumbered by the Constitutional Convention of 
1978 and appears in the current constitution as article X, section 6.  It now 
further provides that “[t]he board shall also have exclusive jurisdiction 
over the internal structure, management, and operation of the university.”  
Haw. Const. art. X, § 6. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
7 Yamashiro’s recommendation as to graduate assistants in full.  
Decision No. 21: Order at 4-10.
Officer Yamashiro presided over another hearing on 
August 23, 1972 in order to determine which positions should be 
included in Unit 8, “personnel of the University of Hawaiʻ i and 
the community college system, other than faculty.”  Decision No. 
25: Order at 2, 4.   In reaching the conclusion that graduate 
assistants should be excluded from Unit 8, he discussed graduate assistants’ duties, compensation, and benefits, compared graduate assistants’ compensation with that of other non-faculty 
staff, and decided that a graduate assistant’s “primary role [at 
the University] is that of a student.”  Haw. Fed’n of Coll. 
Tchrs., Case No. R-08-13 (HPERB December 29, 1972) (Findings of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law and Recommendations) (hereinafter 
“Decision No. 25: FOF/COL”) at 20-22.  He went on to state that 
graduate assistants are not “public employees” under HRS Chapter 
89 at all:  
Under the facts presented it is clearly shown that 
graduate assistants are not in the same occupational 
grouping nor are they paid on the same salary schedule as 
[other non
-faculty staff].  Graduate assistants do not have 
their compensation subjected to social security and federal income taxes nor are they members of the State retirement system.  The compensation given to graduate assistants is 
treated as a grant or form of financial aid.  These factors 
combined would justify a finding that graduate assistants 
are not employees within Chapter 89, and should be excluded 
from Unit 8.  
Decision No. 25: FOF/COL at 21 (emphasis added).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
8 Officer Yamashiro also based his decision to exclude 
graduate students from Unit 8 on his analysis of the 
Hawaiʻi 
Constitution.  Decision No. 25: FOF/COL at 22.  He reasoned that 
considering graduate assistants “public employees” under HRS 
Chapter 89 would infringe upon the BORʻs powers under article IX 
(now article X):   
 Students at the University are subject to the 
policies and standards of enrollment established by the 
Regents.  Should the terms and conditions of continued 
enrollment become subject to collective bargaining, the constitutional authority of the Regents would be interfered 
with. . . . To include graduate assistants into Unit 8 
would be to ignore their primary status as students and 
would unduly impinge upon the rights and authority of the 
Regents. 
 
 A constitutional provision must be construed in 
connection with other provisions of the instrument, the circumstances under which it was adopted and the history 
which preceded it. The natural consequences of a proposed 
construction must be considered in determining the intent 
of its framers.  Carter v. Gear, 16 Haw. 242, Affirmed 24 
S. ct. 491, 197, US 348 (1904).  Article XII, Section 2 of 
the Hawaiʻ i Constitution does not attempt to interfere with 
the authority granted the Regents by Article IX of the Constitution.  To find that graduate assistants are public 
employees under Chapter 89 would result in an infringment 
[sic] upon the power granted the Regents by the 
Constitution.  
 
Decision No. 25: FOF/COL at 22 (emphasis added).   
  HPERB adopted all of Officer Yamashiro’s conclusions 
of law with regard to graduate assistants.7  Decision No. 25: 
Order at 1-6.  The decisions were not appealed.   
 
7  The only amendment HPERB made to Officer Yamashiro’s 
recommendation that implicated graduate assistants was to reject one of his 
findings of fact.  Decision No. 25: Order at 2- 3.  HPERB agreed that “once a 
graduate assistant completes his academic work he must terminate his 
employment” but disagreed that “once a graduate assistant receives his degree 
he has no employment possibility with his department.”  Id. at 2.  HPERB

 Procedural History  
  In the instant case, ALU argues that HPERB’s 1972 
decisions functionally preclude graduate assistants from 
exercising the collective bargaining rights that they are due 
under article XIII, section 2 of the constitution as “persons in 
public employment.”  ALU sued the BOR, HLRB, and the State in 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit seeking a series of declaratory judgments falling into three categories.
8  ALU sought 
judgments to the effect that: (1) graduate assistants are “persons in public employment” within the meaning of article 
XIII, section 2; (2) that they are “employee[s]” or “public 
employee[s]” under HRS Chapter 89; (3) that HLRB’s rules lack 
any process by which persons in positions previously excluded 
from collective bargaining may seek relief.     HLRB filed a motion to dismiss or in the alternative
for summary judgment which the State joined, arguing that the 
circuit court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over 
ALU’s action.  HLRB argued that declaratory judgment was  
 
(continued . . .) 
noted that while graduate students have no possibility to continue working as 
graduate assistants, “the record is silent as to notable examples of graduate 
assistants who, once earning their degrees, have gone on to become professors in their departments.”  Id. at 2-3.  
 
8  The Honorable James H. Ashford presided.  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
10 improper under HRS § 632-1  because ALU had not exhausted its 
administrative remedies before HLRB, citing a number of rules 
that HLRB had promulgated to make remedies available as required 
by HRS § 91-8 (2012)  and HRS § 89-6(g) (2012).   HLRB further 
argued that granting ALU’s requested relief would not “terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding.”11 109
  
 
9  HRS § 632- 1(b) provides as follows:  
 
(b) Relief by declaratory judgment may be granted in 
civil cases where an actual controversy exists between 
contending parties, or where the court is satisfied that antagonistic claims are present between the parties 
involved which indicate imminent and inevitable litigation, 
or where in any such case the court is satisfied that a 
party asserts a legal relation, status, right, or privilege 
in which the party has a concrete interest and that there is a challenge or denial of the asserted relation, status, 
right, or privilege by an adversary party who also has or 
asserts a concrete interest therein, and the court is 
satisfied also that a declaratory judgment will serve to 
terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the 
proceeding.  Where, however, a statute provides a special 
form of remedy for a specific type of case, that statutory 
remedy shall be followed; but the mere fact that an actual 
or threatened controversy is susceptible of relief through 
a general common law remedy, a remedy equitable in nature, or an extraordinary legal remedy, whether such remedy is 
recognized or regulated by statute or not, shall not debar 
a party from the privilege of obtaining a declaratory 
judgment in any case where the other essentials to such 
relief are present. 
 
(Emphasis added. )
 
 
10  HRS § 91- 8 provides that “[a]ny interested person may petition an 
agency for a declaratory order as to the applicability of any statutory 
provision or of any rule or order of the agency.” 
 
11  HRS § 89- 6(g) provides that “[w]here any controversy arises under 
this section, the board shall, pursuant to chapter 91, make an investigation and, after a hearing upon due notice, make a final determination on the applicability of this section to specific individuals, employees, or 
positions.” 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
11 HRS § 632-1.  The circuit court agreed with both arguments and 
granted HLRB’s motion to dismiss.   
  BOR also filed a motion to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment.  The motion incorporated the 
jurisdictional arguments HLRB had made in its motion, and 
further argued that ALU’s claims were barred pursuant to HRS § 
304A-108(a) (2020).12  That statute provides that “all claims 
arising out of the acts or omissions of the university or the 
members of its board of regents . . . may be brought only 
pursuant to this section and only against the university.”  HRS 
§ 304A-108(a).  BOR also argued that there was no actual 
controversy between ALU and BOR.  The circuit court agreed with 
BOR’s argument under HRS § 304A-108(a), and granted the motion, 
dismissing BOR.   
  ALU appealed from the circuit court’s final judgment 
dismissing the case.  We accepted transfer from the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals. 
   
 
12  HRS § 304A- 108(a) provides in relevant part: 
 
 (a) The university may sue and be sued in its 
corporate name.  Notwithstanding any other law to the 
contrary, all claims arising out of the acts or omissions 
of the university or the members of its board of regents, 
its officers, or its employees, including claims permitted 
against the State under chapter 661, part I, and claims for 
torts permitted against the State under chapter 662, may be 
brought only pursuant to this section and only against the 
niversity. . . .  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
12 III. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
A.
 Subject Matter Jurisdiction 
  The existence of subject matter jurisdiction is 
reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard.  Kilakila ʻ O 
Haleakala v. Bd. Of Land & Nat. Res., 131 Hawaiʻ i 193, 199, 317 
P.3d 27, 33 (2013).  
B. Statutory Interpretation 
   Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law to be reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard.  Guth 
v. Freeland, 96 Hawaiʻ i 147, 149–50, 28 P.3d 982, 984–85 (2001). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
  The circuit court held that it did not have 
jurisdiction under HRS § 632-1 because ALU did not exhaust its 
statutory and administrative remedies.  We agree.  HPERB’s 1972 
rulings were not final determinations of whether graduate assistants are “employee[s]” under HRS Chapter 89.  There is an 
administrative remedy available to ALU under HAR § 12-42-9, 
which allows “interested . . . organization[s]” to petition for 
declaratory judgment from HLRB.  ALU has not shown that it has 
exhausted administrative remedies, that no remedies are *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
13 available to it, or that the available remedies would be
futile.13 
   
  We also note that the circuit court erred in dismissing BOR from this case on the basis of HRS § 304A-108(a).  
It should have dismissed BOR on the same basis as HLRB, that it 
lacked jurisdiction over the action.  However, we affirm the 
dismissal because the error was harmless.   
A. The Circuit Court Correctly Held That ALU Did Not Exhaust 
Administrative Remedies  
  ALU alleges that the circuit court erred in holding 
that it did not exhaust administrative remedies.  HRS § 632-1(b) 
requires that where “a statute provides a special form of remedy 
for a specific type of case, that statutory remedy shall be 
followed” before a court can exercise jurisdiction over a 
declaratory judgment action.  We first assess whether HPERB’s 1972 decisions are final and binding determinations that 
graduate assistants are not entitled to collective bargaining 
rights under Chapter 89.  We then address HLRB’s arguments that 
ALU has failed to exhaust the remedies available under HLRB’s 
 
13  Having determined that the circuit court lacks jurisdiction 
because ALU has not exhausted its administrative remedies, we do not reach 
the circuit court’s other ground for dismissal under HRS § 632-1  (that 
declaratory judgment would not “terminate the uncertainty or controversy”).  
We also do not reach ALU’s constitutional arguments on the merits, as the 
circuit court dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds and did not reach 
those issues.     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
14 regulations.  Third and finally, we address ALU’s argument that 
pursuit of a declaratory judgment before HLRB would be futile.   
1. HPERB’s 1972 rulings are not final, binding 
determinations that graduate assistants are not “public employees” under HRS Chapter 89 
  ALU argues that HPERB issued a final ruling that 
graduate assistants are not “employees” within the meaning of 
HRS Chapter 89 in 1972.  As a result, there is no administrative 
process by which HLRB can now consider graduate assistants’ 
inclusion in a bargaining unit.  According to ALU, because HPERB 
has held that graduate assistants are not “
public employees” and 
because ALU is not an exclusive representative, neither ALU nor 
its members may petition to be included in a bargaining unit, 
because only an employee or an exclusive representative may 
petition for inclusion under HLRB’s regulations.   
  In response, HLRB argues that Officer Yamashiro’s 
statements in the recommendations that HPERB adopted in 1972 are 
mere “dicta,” and maintains that it has never ruled on whether 
graduate assistants are “employees” under HRS Chapter 89.  HLRB further argues that graduate assistants might still be eligible 
for membership in Unit 13,
14 suggesting that exclusion from Units  
 
14  Unit 13 comprises “[p]rofessional and scientific employees, who 
cannot be included in any of the other bargaining units.”  HRS § 89- 6(a)(13) 
(Supp. 2021). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
15 7 and 8 does not necessarily exclude them from HRS Chapter 89 
altogether.   
 
 The threshold question is whether Officer Yamashiro’s 
statements in HPERB’s 1972 decisions can be considered final determinations that graduate assistants are not “employees” 
under HRS Chapter 89.  ALU’s argument that HPERB made a final 
determination finds support in several passages in the decisions.  In deciding to exclude graduate assistants from Unit 
7, Officer Yamashiro reasoned that excluding graduate assistants 
from Unit 7 “entails due regard to the possible infringement 
upon the constitutional authority of the Board of Regents” of 
the University of Hawaiʻ i, because graduate assistants’ 
employment was intertwined with their status as students.  
Decision No. 21: FOF/COL at 22-23.  This implies that graduate 
students are not only excluded from Unit 7, but that they are 
also not public employees under the constitution.  Decision No. 
21: FOF/COL at 23.  
 
  Officer Yamashiro expanded that point in Decision No. 
25.  In the course of giving his reasoning for excluding  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
16 graduate assistants from Unit 8, he opined that graduate 
assistants should not be under HRS Chapter 89 at all:   
Under the facts presented it is clearly shown that 
graduate assistants are not in the same occupational 
grouping nor are they paid on the same salary schedule as 
[other non- faculty staff].  Graduate assistants do not have 
their compensation subjected to social security and federal 
income taxes
 nor are they members of the State retirement 
system.  The compensation given to graduate assistants is treated as a grant or form of financial aid.  These factors 
combined would justify a finding that graduate assistants 
are not employees within Chapter 89, and should be excluded 
from Unit 8.   
Decision No. 25: FOF/COL at 21 (emphasis added). 
 Later, Officer Yamashiro stated that because graduate 
assistants are “primarily students,” “[t]o find that graduate 
assistants are public employees under Chapter 89 would result in 
an infringment [sic] upon the power granted the Regents by the 
Constitution.”   Decision No. 25: FOF/COL at 21-22.   
Though these passages in Decision Nos. 21 and 25 do 
provide support for ALU’s position, HLRB is correct that, when viewed in context, HPERB was not ruling on whether graduate 
assistants were “employee[s]” under HRS § 89-2.  Neither 
proceeding was held to answer that question.  The Decision No. 
21 hearing was held “to determine the composition of Unit 7,” 
and the Decision No. 25 hearing was conducted “to determine 
employee inclusions in and exclusions from Unit 8.”  Decision 
No. 21: FOF/COL at 1; Decision No. 25: Order at 2.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
17  
 Thus, the final effect of the orders in Decision Nos. 
21 and 25 was to exclude graduate assistants from Unit 7 
(“[f]aculty of the University of Hawaiʻ i and the community 
college system”) and Unit 8 (“[p]ersonnel of the University of Hawaiʻi and the c
ommunity college system,” other than faculty).  
See Decision No. 21: Order at 10; Decision No. 25: Order at 2; 
Decision No. 25: FOF/COL at 12.  Critically, neither HPERB nor 
HLRB has addressed whether graduate assistants belong in Unit 13 
(“[p]rofessional and scientific employees, who cannot be 
included in any of the other bargaining units”).  HRS § 89-
6(a)(13).  Graduate assistants’ exclusion from Units 7 and 8 is 
therefore not equivalent to holding that they are excluded from 
Chapter 89 altogether.  Since HLRB has not ruled that they should be excluded from Unit 13, the question of the status of 
graduate assistants as public employees remains open.   
   Furthermore, interpreting Officer Yamashiro’s statements in Decision Nos. 21 and 25 to have final, preclusive 
effect would be at odds with HLRB’s duty to administer HRS 
Chapter 89.  As HLRB has argued, its unit certification 
decisions are not “unmovable.”  HLRB is required to bring new positions within the definition of “public employee,” and adjust
the composition of bargaining units, as necessitated by changes  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
18 to the law or facts.   HRS § 89-2.  In Decision Nos. 21 and 25, 
HLRB made its bargaining unit composition determinations based 
on graduate assistants’ duties in 1972.  But ALU has alleged 
that the nature of graduate student employment has changed 
significantly since then.   ALU also contends that the 
authorities that Officer Yamashiro relied to support his decisions are no longer good law.  If HLRB is presented with a petition alleging that graduate assistants’ duties and other 
circumstances have substantially changed since it issued 
Decision Nos. 21 and 25, 1615
HLRB has a statutory duty to reexamine 
 
15  HLRB is required to adjudicate any controversy that arises under 
Chapter 89, and is specifically required to making determinations about the 
inclusion of particular positions in bargaining units.  HRS § 89- 5(i)(3) 
(Supp. 2021) provides that HLRB shall “resolve controversies under [Chapter 
89],” and HRS § 89- 6(g), which lays out the statutory bargaining units, 
provides that “[w]here any controversy arises under this section, the board shall, pursuant to chapter 91, make an investigation and, after a hearing 
upon due notice, make a final determination on the applicability of this 
section to specific individuals, employees, or positions.”  Since 1972, HLRB 
has adjudicated cases brought by unions and employers requesting 
clarification on particular positions’ status as “public employees,” or for 
particular positions to be included in, or excluded from, particular 
bargaining units.  See, e.g., HGEA v. Fasi, Consolidated Case Nos. RA-02-15, 
RA-03-16, RA-04-17, RA-13-18, DR-02-12, DR-03-13, DR-04-14, DR-13-15 (HPERB 
Nov. 1, 1977) (Decision No. 85) ( HAR § 12-49-9 petition to determine if 
employees of MTL, Inc., are “ public employees” of the City and County of 
Honolulu within the meaning of HRS § 89- 2); Bd. of Regents v. UHPA, Case Nos . 
RA-07-37, RA-08-37 (HLRB July 18, 1980)  (Decision No. 132) (BOR’s petition to 
transfer seven positions from Unit 7 to Unit 8).  As HLRB argued, the 
cumulative result of its decisions is that “the composition of the bargaining 
units has changed over time.”   
 
16  ALU alleges that there have been several important changes since 
1972.  In 1972, graduate student teaching was part of their education or 
training within their degree program, but present- day graduate students teach 
with the goal of receiving a salary, and they often teach courses far removed 
from their area of expertise that do not provide educational benefit.  Also, in contrast to HPERB’s findings in 1972, graduate students today teach with 
minimal or no faculty supervision.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
19 those decisions, and issue a ruling based on graduate 
assistants ’ current status.   
 
 We hold that HPERB’s 1972 statements are not a 
binding, final adjudication that graduate assistants are not 
“employee[s]” within the meaning of HRS § 89-2.  Since HPERB’s 
decisions do not finally resolve the issue, ALU should pursue 
further administrative remedies before HLRB to seek an answer to this question, provided such remedies are available.   
2. An administrative remedy is available to ALU under HAR 
§ 12-42-9 
  Though we find that HPERB’s 1972 rulings are not final 
and binding on ALU and its members, if there is no 
administrative remedy open to ALU to seek clarification of 
graduate assistants’ status under HRS Chapter 89, ALU may seek 
declaratory relief in the circuit court.  Hokama v. Univ. of 
Haw., 92 Hawaiʻ i 268, 273, 990 P.2d 1150, 1155 (1999) (“An 
aggrieved party need not exhaust administrative remedies where 
no effective remedies exist.”).  HLRB has proposed a number of 
administrative remedies that it argues are available to ALU, 
citing HAR §§ 12-42-9, -17, -18, -19, and -20 (effective Feb. 6, 
1981).  We analyze each rule that HLRB has raised in order to 
determine if it provides a remedy ALU should reasonably have 
been expected to exhaust.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
20  
 Notably, several statutes empower HLRB to adjudicate 
controversies relating to Chapter 89.  HRS § 89-5(i)(3) 
generally gives HLRB the power to “[r]esolve controversies under 
[Chapter 89].”  In HRS § 89-6, which governs bargaining unit 
determinations, section (g) provides that “[w]here any 
controversy arises under this section, the board shall, pursuant 
to Chapter 91, make an investigation and, after a hearing upon due notice, make a final determination on the applicability of 
this section to specific individuals, employees, or positions.”  
Moreover, HRS § 91-8 provides that
 “[a]ny interested person may 
petition an agency for a declaratory order as to the applicability of any statutory provision or of any rule or order 
of the agency.”  Read together, these statutes give HLRB broad 
authority to decide questions of the applicability of Chapter 89, and the applicability of its own regulations and orders.  
HLRB has promulgated rules to give effect to these 
statutes and has suggested that ALU pursue remedies provided by
those rules.  However, most of these procedures are not open to
ALU.  What HLRB calls the “established procedure” for adding a 
position to a bargaining unit, in HAR § 12-42-20, may only be 
used by an “exclusive bargaining representative or any public  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
21 employer[.]”   To use § 12-42-20, ALU would have to request that 
the exclusive representative of Unit 7, 8 or 13 petition HLRB to 
include the position of “graduate assistant” in its unit.  It 
would be unreasonable to require ALU to exhaust administrative 
procedures that require it to first secure representation by a 
third party.  HLRB also cites HAR §§ 12-42-17 and -18, but only 
an “employee organization or anyone authorized to act in its behalf” can invoke these procedures, and ALU has not been 
recognized as such.   HAR §§ 12-42-17, -18 and -20 are more 
properly considered administrative remedies belonging to employers and exclusive representatives, not to ALU.  1817
 HLRB also cites HAR § 12-42-19, a rule enabling a 
public employee to petition for the decertification of the 
 
17  HAR § 12- 42-20(a) provides that “[a] petition for clarification 
of an appropriate bargaining or optional appropriate bargaining unit or 
amendment of certification may be filed by the exclusive bargaining 
representative or any public employer at any time.”   HAR § 12- 42-20(a) 
(emphasis added). 
 
 18  HAR § 12- 42-17(b) provides that “ [a] petition to determine an 
optional appropriate bargaining unit may be filed by an employee organization 
or anyone authorized to act in its behalf.”  H AR § 12- 42-17(b) (e mphasis 
added).  The optional bargaining units include “[p]rofessional and scientific 
employees, other than registered professional nurses,” which appears to correspond with U nit 13 from HRS 89- 6, “[p]rofessional and scientific 
employees, who cannot be included in any of the other bargaining units.”  See 
HRS 89-6 (a)(13); HAR § 12-42-17.  
 
  HAR § 12 -42-18 provides that “[a]  petition to select an exclusive 
bargaining representative of an appropriate bargaining or optional 
appropriate bargaining unit may be filed by an employee organization or 
anyone authorized to act in its behalf.”  HAR § 12- 42-18(a) (emphasis added).    
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
22 exclusive representative of a bargaining unit.   It is unclear 
why HLRB suggests this regulation because decertifying the 
exclusive representatives in Unit 7 or 8 would not bring ALU 
relief.  In any event, HAR § 12-42-19 is designed to be invoked 
by a “public employee.”  ALU’s members have not been recognized 
as public employees - this is the controversy they seek to 
resolve.   19
 Finally, HLRB suggests a declaratory judgment action 
under § 12-42-9.  In contrast to §§ 12-42-17, -18, -19, and -20, § 12-42-9 is not limited to employee organizations or public 
employees.  HAR § 12-42-9 enables any “interested person or 
organization” to ask for a declaratory ruling to determine the 
applicability of HLRB’s rules or orders.  HAR § 12-42-9(a) (“Any 
public employee, employee organization, public employer, or interested person or organization may petition the board for a 
declaratory order as to the applicability of any statutory provision or of any rule or order of the board.”) (emphasis 
added).    
 
19  HAR § 12- 42-19(a) provides:  
 
A petition for decertification of an exclusive 
bargaining representative may be filed by any public 
employee, or representative authorized to act in the 
employee’s behalf, alleging that the certified exclusive 
bargaining representative is no longer the majority 
representative of the employees in the appropriate 
bargaining or optional appropriate bargaining unit. 
 
HAR § 12- 42-19
(a) (emphasis added). 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
23   Based on the plain text of HAR § 12-42-9, we see no 
reason that ALU would be foreclosed from petitioning HLRB for 
declaratory judgment directly under that provision
.  Allowing 
HLRB to speak first on whether today’s graduate assistants are “employees” has the advantage of mobilizing HLRB’s expertise in 
administering HRS Chapter 89 and making bargaining unit 
determinations.  ALU contends that the position of graduate assistants today is fundamentally different than in 1972.  It 
argues that many aspects of graduate assistant work are now 
“indistinguishable from that performed by university faculty and 
administrative, professional and technical staff.”  HLRB’s      
§ 12-42-9 procedure would allow HLRB to consider the application 
of the definition of “employee[s]” under HRS § 89-2 to present-
day graduate assistants, given their allegedly changed duties.  HLRB would then have the opportunity to clarify the scope and 
applicability of HPERB’s 1972 rulings.  And if HLRB’s 
determination is appealed, the courts will be able to review the 
record of proceedings before HLRB and its reasoning for its 
decision.  
3. Petitioning for declaratory judgment under HAR        
§ 12-42-9 would not be futile  
  ALU has not shown that a declaratory judgment petition 
under HAR § 12-42-9 would be futile.  See Poe v. Haw. Lab. Rels.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
24 ALU argues that petitioning for declaratory judgment 
under HAR § 12-42-9 would be futile because declaratory rulings 
may not be used to review already-made agency decisions.  
Citizens Against Reckless Dev. v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals of City 
& Cnty. of Honolulu (“CARD”), 114 Hawai‘ i 184, 196—97, 159 P.3d 
143, 155—56 (2007) (holding that declaratory rulings are “not 
intended to allow review of concrete agency decisions for which other means of review are available”).
20   
HLRB argues that ALU’s citation to CARD is inapposite.  
In CARD, petitioners sought a declaratory ruling under HRS       
20ALU does not specify which “other means of review are available” 
that would preclude the applicability of declaratory judgment in this case. 
CARD,
 114 Hawai‘ i at 197, 159 P.3d 
at 156.  By analogy to the facts of CARD, 
it appears that ALU is referring to an appeal of HPERB’s 1972 decisions under 
HRS § 91- 14.   Bd., 97 Hawaiʻi
 528, 536, 40 P.3d 930, 938 (2002) (“Whenever
exhaustion [of administrative remedies] will be futile it is not
required.” (quoting 4 Kenneth C. Davis, Administrative Law
Treatise § 26:11 (2d ed. 1983) (alteration in original)); In re
Doe, 96 Hawaiʻi 272, 287 n.20, 30 P.3d 878, 893 n.20 (2001)
(“[T]he burden of proving that any particular administrative
remedy is futile rests with the litigant seeking to bypass
it.”).*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
25 § 91-8 to challenge a specific, final agency ruling.  Id.  But 
here, there is no definitive ruling or order by HLRB on the 
issue of whether graduate assistants are “employee[s]” under HRS 
§ 89-2.  Therefore, ALU’s prospective petition for declaratory 
judgment before HLRB would not be a “second bite at the apple,” 
because no first bite was taken.   
  We agree with HLRB.  CARD does not preclude ALU from 
petitioning for declaratory judgment from HLRB.  In CARD, we 
distinguished between “a method of review of a determination already made,” and “a method of requesting an agency to make a 
determination.”  Id. at 199, 159 P.3d at 158 (quoting Wis. 
Fertilizer Ass’n v. Karns, 158 N.W.2d 294, 300 (Wis. 1968)).  
Declaratory judgment was not appropriate for “review of agency 
determinations that have already been made and which have not been timely appealed.”  Id. at 196, 159 P.3d at 155.  But 
declaratory judgment is appropriate when “requesting an agency to make a determination” on a question that has not yet been 
resolved. 
  Id. at 199, 159 P.3d at 158 (quoting Karns, 158 
N.W.2d at 300).  As we have explained, HLRB has not definitively ruled that graduate assistants are not “employee[s]” under HRS  
§ 89-2, so the declaratory judgment action here is not 
“review[ing] . . . a determination already made” within the  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
26 meaning of CARD.  Id.  ALU 
may therefore ask HLRB for a 
determination on the questions raised in this action: whether 
graduate assistants fall within the definition of “employee[s]” 
under HRS § 89-2, whether graduate students may be included in 
Unit 13 under HRS § 89-6, or whether HPERB’s 1972 decisions 
continue to exclude graduate assistants from Units 7 and 8 given 
that their duties have allegedly changed.     Counsel for HLRB represented at oral argument that if 
ALU were to bring a HAR § 12-42-9 petition, none of the members 
of HLRB’s current board would find that HPERB’s 1972 rulings 
preclude HLRB from considering whether ALU’s members are 
employees under HRS § 89-2.
21  Given that the import of Decision 
Nos. 21 and 25 is at best unclear, that HAR § 12-42-9 is open to “interested person[s] or organization[s]” like ALU, and that HLRB has indicated that ALU is not precluded from a declaratory  
 
21  Counsel for HLRB represented to the court that the three members 
of its board at the time of oral argument ( held January 19, 2023), all 
believe that Decision Nos. 21 and 25 do not have preclusive effect on the 
question of whether graduate assistants are “employee[s]” under HRS § 89- 2 
because HLRB has not ruled on that issue.  Oral Argument at 41:03, 
https://www.courts.state.hi.us/oral- argument- before-the -hawaii-supreme- court-
scap-22-0000029 [https://perma.cc/KBX5- 8J9L].   Counsel for HLRB  noted that 
one member of the board (the holdover board member) may change before a 
proceeding raising those issues, and that it could not make any 
representations as to the new board member’s position.  Id. at 41:03, 42:00. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
27 judgment action, we conclude that the § 12-42-9 procedure 
remains available to ALU.  Accordingly, the circuit court 
was 
correct to hold that it lacked jurisdiction to issue a declaratory judgment.  B. The Circuit Court Erred in Dismissing BOR on the Basis of 
HRS § 304A-108(a), but the Error was Harmless  
  The circuit court granted HLRB’s motion to dismiss on 
the ground that it had no jurisdiction over ALU’s action, then 
granted BOR’s motion to dismiss on the basis that BOR was not a 
proper party under HRS § 304A-108(a).
22  Having granted these two 
motions to dismiss, the circuit court issued a Final Judgment dismissing the case.  The circuit court erred in dismissing BOR 
on the basis of HRS § 304A-108(a) after it had determined it had 
no jurisdiction over the action.  Norris v. Six Flags Theme 
Parks, Inc., 102 Hawaiʻ i 203, 207, 74 P.3d 26, 30 (2003) (noting  
 
 22  HRS § 304A- 108(a) provides:  
  The university may sue and be sued in its corporate 
name. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, all 
claims arising out of the acts or omissions of the 
university or the members of its board of regents, its 
officers, or its employees, including claims permitted 
against the State under chapter 661, part I, and claims for 
torts permitted against the State under chapter 662, may be 
brought only pursuant to this section and only against the 
university. . . .

the merits of any claim or defense”);  HRCP Rule 12(h)(3) (2018, 
last amended January 1, 2000) (“Whenever it appears by 
suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks 
jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the 
action.”).   
  The circuit court’s error, however, was harmless.23  
Reyes v. Kuboyama, 76 Hawaiʻ i 137, 140, 870 P.2d 1281, 1284 
(1994) (“[W]here the circuit court’s decision is correct, its 
conclusion will not be disturbed on the ground that it gave the 
wrong reason for its ruling.” (citing Brooks v. Minn, 73 Haw.

V. CONCLUSION 
  Though we recognize that ALU spent several years in 
pursuit of collective bargaining rights for its members through 
this lawsuit, the circuit courts cannot entertain a declaratory 
judgment action until ALU has exhausted 
its administrative  
 
23  The circuit court also erred when it stated in its order granting 
BOR’s motion to dismiss that State had joined BOR’s motion to dismiss.  State 
joined HLRB’s motion to dismiss, not BOR’s.  This error was also harmless.  
The circuit court reached the correct result when it dismissed the suit in 
its entirety.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
