  I. Introduction  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
This case concerns the Mauna Kea Access Road (“MKAR”) ,  
which lies in part on Hawaiian home  lands.  
Plaintiffs Pualani Kanaka ‘ole Kanahele, Edward Halealoha 
Ayau, and 1 
Keali‘i “Skippy” Ioane, Jr. (collectively “Plaintiffs”)  
filed suit in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (“circuit 
court”) as Native Hawaiian  beneficiaries of the Hawaiian home 
lands trust who  engage in native Hawaiian traditional and 
cultural practices on Maunakea. Defendants are the State of 2
Hawai‘i (“State”)  and its  Department of Transportation (“DOT”) , 
Department of Land and Natural Resources (“DLNR”) , Department of 
Hawaiian Home Lands (“DHHL”) , and  Hawaiian Homes Commission 
1   The parties use both “Maunakea” and “Mauna Kea” in their filings. “The 
University of Hawai‘ i at Hilo College of Hawaiian Language, Ka Haka ‘Ula o 
Ke‘elikōlani, recommends one word, ‘Maunakea’ as the proper Hawaiian usage.” 
Meaning of Maunakea, University of Hawai ‘i at Hilo Center for Maunakea 
Stewardship, 
https://hilo.hawaii.edu/maunakea/culture/meaning#:~:text=Maunakea%20or%20Maun a%20Kea%3F,as%20the%20proper%20Hawaiian%20usage  [https://perma.cc/9P39 -QEZ4]. 
The Center  for Maunakea Stewardship , however, uses the “Mauna Kea” spelling 
where “Mauna Kea” is used in published or legal documents, such as the “Mauna 
Kea Science Reserve.” Id.   Therefore, when referencing the mountain, the 
spelling of “Maunakea” is used. When referencing the MKAR, the spelling of 
“Mauna Kea” is used.  
 
2   For purposes of this opinion, “Native Hawaiian” means “any descendant 
of not less than one- half part of the blood of the races inhabiting the 
Hawaiian Islands previous to 1778” as defined by the Hawaiian homes 
Commission Act (“HHCA”) § 201(a) (19 20). The use of “native Hawaiian” 
encompasses all “descendants of the indigenous peoples who inhabited the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778, regardless of blood quantum.” Flores-Case

(“HHC”), as well as officials of those entities3 (collectively 
“Defendants”). 
Plaintiffs allege Defendants breached their trust duties by 
allowing the State to use MKAR lands  without payment since the 
1970s. They  also assert  Defendants’ attempt to make MKAR a 
state highway in 2018 was  ineffective as a matter of law.   
The circuit court  granted summary judgment in Defendants’ 
favor  based on  Act 14 of 1995, which was to “[r]esolve all 
controversies relating to the Hawaiian home lands trust which 
arose between August 21, 1959 and July 1, 1988.”  1995 Haw. 
Sess. Laws Act 14, § 2  at 698.   To resolve such controversies, 
Act 14 proposed “compensation for all remaining confirmed 4

Suzanne Case, as Director of the DLNR; William Ail ā  Jr., as Director of 
DHHL and Chair of the HHC; and David B. Ka ʻapu as a member of the HHC. 
Hawai‘i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 25(d) (2000) ,  however, titled 
“Public officers; death or separation from office,” provides:  
When a public officer is a party to an action in an 
official capacity and during its pendency dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold office, the action does not abate 
and the officer’s successor is automatically substituted as 
a party. Proceedings following the substitution shall be 
in the name of the substituted party, but any misnomer not 
affecting the substantial rights of the parties shall be disregarded. An order of substitution may be entered at 
any time, but the omission to enter such an order shall not 
affect the substitution.  
The names of the current public officials have therefore been 
substituted for those who no longer hold office. Now named are Edward 
Sniffen  as Director of the DOT ;  Dawn N.S. Chang,  as Director of the 
DLNR; Kali Watson, as Director of the DHHL and Chair of the HHC; and 
Pauline N. Namu‘ o, Zachary Z. Helm, Dennis L. Neves, Michael L.

uncompensated public uses of Hawaiian home lands;  [and] the 
initiation of a land exchange to remedy uncompensated use of 
Hawaiian home lands for state roads claims and highways[.]” 
1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, § 6 at 700.  Defendants argue Act 14 
remedied the uncompensated use of the Hawaiian home lands underlying the MKAR and made enforcement of a  land exchange the 
exclusive remedy for Plaintiffs.    
Plaintiffs assert Act 14 of 1995 d oes not bar their claims 
because it only resolved claims that arose before July 1, 1988, 
and the State’s attempt to designate MKAR a state highway 
occurred in 2018. 
We granted Plaintiffs’ application for transfer . 
We hold (1) Act 14 of 1995 does not preclude Plaintiffs’ 
claims; (2) the portion of the MKAR going through DHHL lands is 
not a state highway because legal requirements for such a 
designation were not satisfied ; and (3) the State blatantly 
disregarded unambiguous requirements of the “Hawaiian Homes 
Commission Act , 1920” (“HHCA”) , and in doing so, breached its 
constitutional and fiduciary obligation to faithfully carry out 
the HHCA. Haw. Const. art. XII, § 2; Ahuna v. Dep’t of Hawaiian 
Home Lands , 64 Haw. 327, 338, 640 P.2d 1161, 116 8 (1982) . 
We therefore vacate th e circuit court’s March 16, 2022 final 
judgment and remand to the circuit court for further proceedings 
consistent with this opinion.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
II. Background 
A. Brief history of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act 
In 1921, Congress enacted the HHCA, which set aside about 
203,500 acres of public lands as Hawaiian home lands for Native 
Hawaiians. 1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, § 1 at 696. One of the 
principal purposes of the HHCA is to rehabilitate Native 
Hawaiians by establishing a permanent land base for their 
benefit and use. HHCA § 101(b)(1); Ahuna, 64 Haw. at 336, 640 
P.2d at 1167 (1982) . When Hawai‘i became a state in 1959, the 
State entered a compact with the United States to assume the 
management and disposition of the Hawaiian home lands and to 
adopt the HHCA as a provision of the state constitution. Haw. 
Const. art. XII, § 3; Ahuna, 64 Haw. at 337, 640 P.2d at 1168. 
The constitution reads: 
The State and its people do hereby accept, as a compact 
with the United States, or as conditions or trust 
provisions imposed by the United States, relating to the 
management and disposition of the Hawaiian home 
lands. . . . The State and its people do further agree and 
declare that the spirit of the Hawaiian Homes Commission 
Act looking to the continuance of the Hawaiian homes 
projects for the further rehabilitation of the Hawaiian 
race shall be faithfully carried out. 
Haw. Const. art. XII, § 2.  Hence, the State has a 
constitutional and fiduciary obligation to faithfully administer 
the HHCA for the benefit and rehabilitation of Native Hawaiians. 
Id.; HHCA § 101(c); Ahuna, 64 Haw. at 338, 640 P.2d at 1168. The DHHL is the state agency in charge of implementing the 
State’s fiduciary duty under the HHCA.  
5   
 
  In July of 1982, the United States Secretary of the 
Interior and the Governor of the State of Hawai ‘i established the 
Federal-State Task Force on the HHCA (“Federal -State Task 
Force”). In its August 1983 report, the Federal -State Task 
Force concluded the State had not met all of its fiduciary 
obligations and, furthermore, had “entered into conveyances a nd 
encumbrances of Hawaiian Home lands that have not been 
authorized by law.” The Federal -State Task Force determined 
that since the inception of the HHCA, “large amounts of Hawaiian 
Home lands continue to be used for purposes which directly 
benefit the general public rather than beneficiaries ”  of the 
HHCA with little or no compensation being paid to DHHL.  The 
Federal-State Task Force concluded the misuses to be breaches of 
trust “for which compensation is due and owing.”  
 
    
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The Federal -State Task Force additionally pointed out that 
some Hawaiian home lands had been “taken for use as schools and 
other public purposes.”5 It deemed these takings unlawful and 
recommended that the Department of Interior and Department of 
Justice get involved if the DHHL was unable to resolve all 
unlawful takings and transfers of Hawaiian home lands matters. 
This report did not mention the MKAR. 
As an example of an unlawful taking, 65 acres of Hawaiian home lands 
were used by the State Department of Education for N ānākuli High School. The 
record does not appear to explain whether or how this matter was resolved.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B. History of t he MKAR 
The HHCA stated the HHC would select suitable land from, 
among other places, the lands of Humu ‘ula Mauka in the district 
of North Hilo as available lands for the purposes of the HHCA. 
HHCA § 203(1). In 1929, 49,100 acres of land in North Hilo were 
selected and designated as Hawaiian home  lands. Humu‘ula Mauka 
is “the portion of Humuula [Humu ‘ula] above the Hilo Forest 
Reserve, a large area covering much of the saddle between Mauna 
Kea and Mauna Loa, reaching to the summit of the latter.”    6
In 1967, the legislature granted the University of Hawai ‘i 
$2,440,000 for, among other things, the “[p]lanning, 
construction and equipping” of a road for the Mauna Kea 
Observatory. 1967 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 217, § 1 at 292. In 
1970, the legislature appropriated an additional $2,123,000 to 
the DOT to construct “a two -lane highway from the Saddle Road in 
vicinity of Puu [Pu ‘u] Huluhulu to the summit by way of Hale 
Pohaku [Pōhaku].” 1970 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 187, § 1 at 413. 
The road, which became known as the MKAR, was partially built on 
65.142 acres of Humu ‘ula Mauka land designated as Hawaiian home 
lands.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
From 1907 to 1976, it appears the Humu ‘ula Mauka Hawaiian 
home lands were managed by the DLNR and leased to Parker Ranch. 
In April of 1976, the DLNR returned management of the land to 
DHHL. 
The County of Hawai‘i apparently took over maintenance of 
the MKAR in 1974. In 1983, the County adopted a resolution 
accepting maintenance obligations for the MKAR. 
C. Relevant legislation 
In 1988, the legislature enacted Act 395, later codified in 
part as HRS chapter 673  (1988). 1988 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 395.  
Act 395 provided a limited waiver of sovereign immunity for 
beneficiaries of the trust to bring suits, prospectively, 
for money damages relating to breaches of the State ’s trust 
responsibilities occurring after July 1, 1988. 1988 Haw. 
Sess. L. Act 395, § 3 at 945. In addition, section 5 of Act 
395 provided an unfettered right to sue for actual damages 
for past breaches of trust ( i.e., between August 21, 1959 
and June 30, 1988) and directed that all suits must be 
brought prior to June 30, 1993. 1988 Haw. Sess. L. Act 395, 
§ 5 at 945. 
Kalima v. State, 111 Hawaiʻi 84, 88, 137 P.3d 990, 994 (2006) . 
With respect to pre-1988  breaches, Act 395 also allowed the 
governor to present a proposal to the legislature before the 
1991 Regular Session to resolve Hawaiian home lands 
controversies that  arose between August 21, 1959 and July 1, 
1988. 1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, § 1 at 696. In 1991, the legislature accepted the governor’s “Action Plan to Address 
Controversies under the Hawaiian Home Lands Trust and the Public 
Land Trust” (“Action Plan”). 1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, § 1 
8   
 
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
at 696. The Action Plan included a recommendation to convene a 
task force of representatives from the DHHL, DLNR, Office of 
State Planning, and Department of the Attorney General (“AG”) to 
accelerate the review and decision-making process concerning 
DHHL’s land title and related compensation claims based on 
illegal, improper,  or unauthorized withdrawals, takings, or uses 
of Hawaiian home lands.  The task force was to  confirm title 
claims, determine  which illegal or improper withdrawals or 
transfers were still in existence and should be cancelled or 
withdrawn, determine  appropriate land exchanges, and determine  
appropriate compensation owed for past and continued uses of Hawaiian home lands.  
The resulting Hawaiian home lands task force (“task force”) 
was convened in 1991. 
In 1992, the legislature provided $12,000,000 as 
compensation “for the State’s uncompensated use of Hawaiian home 
lands since August 21, 1959.” 1992 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 316, § 4 
at 1011. The money was intended to “resolve public use 
controversies.” 1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, § 1 at 696. Act 
352 of 1993 extended the period within which to pay the 
compensation throughout fiscal year 1992 to 1993. 1993 Haw. 
Sess. Laws Act 352, § 4 at 996 -97. 
In accordance with HHCA § 204(a)(3), Act 352 of 1993 also 
authorized land exchanges to resolve controversies regarding 
9   
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Hawaiian home lands that had been alienated from the trust. 
1993 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 352, § 6 at 997. The legislature 
asserted “the State resolved all disputed set asides of Hawaiian 
home lands that remain in the control of the State.” 1995 Haw. 
Sess. Laws Act 14, § 1 at 697.  
The task force continued to verify and value certain 
unresolved claims. 1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, § 1 at 697. In 
both its 1995 final report and December 1, 1994 Memorandum of 
Understanding (“MOU”), the task force recommended compensat ion 
for all remaining confirmed uncompensated public uses of 
Hawaiian home lands, including a land exchange to remedy 
uncompensated use of DHHL lands for state roads and highways. 
Then,  in 1995, the state legislature enacted Act 14  (“the 
Act” or “Act 14”)  to resolve any claims remaining based on Act 
395 of 1988’s limited waiver of sovereign immunity . 1995 Haw. 
Sess. Laws Act 14. The Act established a trust fund (“trust” or 
“Hawaiian home lands trust”) to provide funding for the DHHL and 
further the purposes of the HHCA. 1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, 
§  2 at 698. Act 14 was to “resolve all controversies relating 
to the Hawaiian home lands trust which arose between August 21, 1959 and July 1, 1988.”  1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, § 2  at 
698. The Act declared:   
The passage of this Act is in full satisfaction and 
resolution of all controversies at law and in equity, known 
or unknown, now existing or hereafter arising, established 
or inchoate, arising out of or in any way connected with

the management, administration, supervision of the trust, 
or disposition by the State or any governmental agency of 
any lands or interests in land which are or were or are 
alleged to have been Hawaiian home lands, or to have been 
covered by the HHCA arisin g between August 21, 1959 and 
July 1, 1988. 
The passage of this Act shall have the effect of res 
judicata  as to all parties, claims, and issues which arise 
and defenses which have been at issue, or which could have 
been, or could in the future be, at issue, which arose 
between August 21, 1959 and July 1, 1988, whether brought 
against the State or its officials, directly or indirectly, by subrogation, derivative or third party action, tender, 
federal action, or by any other means whatsoever.    
1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, § 4 at 699. 
To resolve and satisfy all such controversies, Act 14 
proposed “compensation for all remaining confirmed uncompensated 
public uses of Hawaiian home lands; [and] the initiation of a 
land exchange to remedy uncompensated use of Hawaiian home lands 
for state roads claims and highways[.]” 1995 Haw. Sess. Laws 
Act 14, § 6 at 700.  
Regarding Act 395’s waiver of immunity, Act 14 provided: 
With respect to all controversies arising between August 
21, 1959 and July 1, 1988, excluding individual claims 
provided for pursuant to chapter 674, Hawaiʻi Revised 
Statutes, the State hereby affirms that the limited waiver 
of sovereign immunity permitted by Act 395, Session Laws of 
Hawaiʻi 1988, is now withdrawn and, to the extent the waiver 
was not previously withdrawn, it is now fully withdrawn.  
All claims arising between August 21, 1959 and July 1, 
1988, or under any other law enacted in furtherance of the 
purposes or objectives of Act 395, Session Laws of Hawai ʻi 
1988, except those permitted by chapter 674, Hawai ʻi Revised 
Statutes, are hereby forever barred.  
1995 Sess. Laws Act 14, § 1 at 697 (emphasis added).

Telescope (“TMT”) at the summit of Maunakea, a  hearing officer’s

decision on the TMT conservation district use application was  
issued on September 26, 2017, and the first appeal from this 
decision, in which we ordered a remand to the BLNR for a 
contested case hearing,  was filed on October 30, 2017.  Matter  
of  Conservation  Dist.  Use  Application  HA-3568, 143 Hawaiʻi  379, 
387, 431 P.3d 752, 760 (2018).  
In March 2018, Marshall Ando, then DOT Acting Highways 
Administrator, submitted a
n internal  memorandum to Jade T. 
Butay, then Director of the DOT, requesting and recommending 
that the MKAR be designated a state highway. Ando ’s letter  
referred to the portion of the MKAR that runs from the intersection with Daniel K. Inouye Highway (also known as 
“Saddle Road”) to 125 feet past the Visitor Information Center 
entrance (also known as “The Onizuka Center for International 
Astronomy Visitor  Information Station” or “V isitor Station ”). 
After the Visitor Station , the MKAR continues as the “Summit 
Access Road” to the summit of Maunakea. It is undisputed the 
Summit Access Road is located on land managed by DLNR.
    7
On March 27, 2018, Edwin Sniffin, Deputy Director of the 
DOT Highways Division, recommended acceptance of Ando’s recommendation and Butay signed off on the recommendation,  
It does not appear the Summit Access Road is located on Hawaiian home 
lands as the parties agree that the MKAR begins at the intersection with 
Saddle Road and goes 125 feet past the V isitor Station.

purportedly designat ing the entire MKAR as state highway Route

On October 30, 2018, this court affirmed the BLNR’s 
decision on remand of September 27, 2017, authorizing issuance 
of a conservation district use permit for the TMT. Matter of 
Conservation Dist. Use Application HA-3568, 143 Hawaiʻi at 409, 
431 P.3d at 782. 
Thereafter, for multiple days in July 2019, opponents of 
the TMT  gathered at the base of Maunakea and blocked access to 
the MKAR, thus preventing the construction of TMT on the summit 
of Maunakea.   On the third day of protests, police arrested 
thirty-four protestors, including two of the individual 
plaintiffs in this  case,  Pualani 8 
Kanaka‘ole Kanahele and Keli ‘i 
W. Ioane, Jr. Id.    
In apparent response to the protests and arrests, on August 
30, 2019, the Department of the Attorney General, DHHL, and DOT 
issued a “Joint Statement on the Jurisdiction of Mauna Kea 
Access Road”9 containing the following text:

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Transportation (DOT) issue this joint statement regarding 
Mauna Kea Access Road. 
Mauna Kea Access Road is under the control and jurisdiction 
of DOT.   Pursuant to HRS § 26- 19 and HRS Ch. 264, DOT has 
control and jurisdiction over all state highways and Mauna Kea Access Road is designated to DOT’s State Highway System as Route 210.   This includes any portions of the road that 
cross over DHHL land.  
“State DOT has controlled and maintained Mauna Kea Access 
Road since it became part of our highways system in 2018,” 
said DOT Deputy Director Ed Sniffen. 
. . . . 
Beneficiaries of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 
do not own Mauna Kea Access Road. Act 14 (1995) resolved 
all claims concerning the use of Hawaiian home lands for 
public roads and highways built before and after statehood. 
In response to concerns that some compensation rem ains 
outstanding, DHHL and the Department of Land and Natural 
Resources (DLNR) have been working together to evaluate the 
terms of compensation and to confirm that it has been made 
in full. This process, however, does not alter the fact 
that all claims regarding use of roads and highways 
crossing DHHL lands have been resolved. 
 . . . . 
At this time, DOT has restricted access on Mauna Kea Access 
Road to preserve public health and safety, and to carry out 
its responsibilities under HRS Ch. 264. 
E. Circuit court proceedings 
1. Complaint and answer 
On February 13, 2020, Plaintiffs filed suit in circuit 
court, followed by a first amended c omplaint (“complaint”) ,  
seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary  relief.  
Plaintiffs divide  Defendants into two groups:  (1) the “DHHL 
Defendants,” which include the DHHL, HHC, and the DHHL Director 
and Chair of HHC; and (2) the “State Defendants ,” which include 
the State, DOT, DOT Director, DLNR, and DLNR Chairperson. The

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
complaint contains two counts: (1) DHHL Defendants’ breach of 
trust; and (2) State Defendants’ breach of trust . 
Plaintiffs claim the DHHL Defendants breached their trust 
obligations by allowing the State Defendants to use the MKAR 
without payment. Plaintiffs allege the DHHL Defendants further 
breached their trust duty to make trust property productive (a) 
by failing to exercise such care and skill as a person of 
ordinary prudence would exercise in dealing with one’s own 
property , including by allowing the State Defendants to exercise 
control over the MKAR ; and (b) by failing to demand payment for 
the use of the lands under the MKAR after July 1, 1988. 
Plaintiffs also contend the MKAR is neither a state nor a 
public highway because it was not properly designated as such 
pursuant to HRS §§ 264 -1(a) (2022) and 264 -43 (2020) . 
Plaintiffs further allege the State Defendants breached their 
trust duties by designating the MKAR as part of the state 
highway system and using the trust lands without compensating 
the trust. Plaintiffs also assert the MKAR is still under the 
control of the DHHL Defendants as a matter of law . Plaintiffs 
claim the State Defendantsʻ acts and omissions deprived the 
trust of revenue, and “Act 14 [did] not apply to this claim of 
liability against the State Defendants.” Plaintiffs contend Act 
14 does not apply to claims arising after July 1, 1988 regarding 
the uncompensated use of trust lands. They also maintain that

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
since the pass age of Act 14 in 1995, the State ha s not 
compensated DHHL for the use of the MKAR nor ha s a land exchange 
been initiated. 
Plaintiffs asked the circuit court to declare , inter alia, 
that Defendants breached their trust obligations and that the 
MKAR is not a state highway . Plaintiffs also asked the circuit 
court to order the State Defendants to provide the DHHL 
Defendants fair compensation for their rent -free use of the MKAR 
and enjoin them from asserting authority over the MKAR. 
Defendants , including the DHHL Defendants, filed an answer 
asserting that Plaintiffs ’ claims were barred, in whole or in 
part, by Act 395 and Act 14 . Defendants also claimed Plaintiffs 
lacked standing to assert any claims raised pursuant to HRS 
chapters 264 and 673 and the HHCA. 
2. Motion to dismiss 
Defendants filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ complaint 
(“motion to dismiss”) argu ing (1) the claims were barred by the 
State’s sovereign immunity and Act 14 of 1995; and (2) 
Plaintiffs lacked a private cause of action to bring claims 
under HRS chapter 264. Defendants asserted Act 14 of 1995 made 
the “land exchange to remedy uncompensated use of Hawaiian home 
lands for state roads claims and highways” the exclusive remedy 
for such claims. 1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, § 6 at 700. 
Defendants argued Act 14 barred the breach of trust claims 
16   
 
  
  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
because Plaintiffs were not seeking to enforce the land 
exchange . 
On May 29, 2020, the circuit court filed an order denying 
this motion. 
3. Summary judgment 
Plaintiffs then filed a motion for partial summary judgment 
(“MPSJ”) on  their breach of trust claims.   On November 5, 2021, 
the circuit court filed an order  denying this motion.   On 
February 10, 2022, however, the circuit court filed an amended 
order and instead granted  summary judgment to Defendants. The 
circuit  court summarized the parties’ positions:  
Plaintiffs argue that they may assert claims against 
Defendants pursuant to HRS ch. 673 for breach of trust and 
are entitled to the requested declaratory relief because 
(a) no land exchange as contemplated by Act 14 has occurred for the Hawaiian home lands  underlying [the MKAR] and 
therefore, those lands remain in the Hawaiian home lands trust with the attendant trust obligations; and (b) Act 14 
resolved claims relating to the Hawaiian home lands trust 
that arose between August 21, 1959 –  July 1, 1988. . .,  but 
the present controversy arose in March 2018 when the State 
designated MKAR as a State Highway.  
Defendants argue, among other things, that the 
State’s sovereign immunity and Act 14 bar Plaintiffs’ 
claims. As related to Act 14, Defendants maintain that the Act fully and finally resolved all claims related to the 
Hawaiian home lands identified in the Act, including the 
“uncompensated use of Hawaiian home lands for state roads 
claims and highways” (Opp., Ex. L at 700), and as such, to 
the extent that Plaintiffs assert any claim related to MKAR, the claim is limited to seeking enforcement of the 
land exchange described in Act 14.  
17  The circuit court ruled Act 14 of 1995 was dispositive 
because it “fully and finally resolved” claims which arose 
between August 21, 1959 and July 1, 1988, involving the 
“uncompensated use of Hawaiian homelands for state roads claims   
 
  
   
 
    
 
     
 
 10 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and highways.” The circuit court quoted 1995 Haw. Sess. Laws 
Act 14, § 6 at 700. The circuit court reasoned that its 
conclusion was supported by language used throughout Act 14, but 
especially section 4,10 as well as sections 1, 2, and 6. 
The circuit court noted the legislature did not include a 
provision concerning the status of trust lands pending a  land 
exchange. The circuit court concluded, however,  that 
prohibiting suits against the State for claims and controversies 
related to Hawaiian home lands but allowing for “actions to 
enforce the provisions of this Act,” was consistent with the 
legislature’s intent to resolve all claims and controversies 
related to Hawaiian home lands upon the passage of Act 14. The 
circuit court quoted  1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, § 17 at 703.    
Section 4 provides in relevant part: 
The passage of this Act is in full satisfaction and 
resolution of all controversies at law and in equity , known 
or unknown, now existing or hereafter arising , established 
or inchoate, arising out of or in any way connected with 
the management, administration, supervision of the trust, 
or disposition by the State or any governmental agency of 
any lands or interests in land which are or were or are alleged to have been Hawaiian home lands, or to have been 
covered by the HHCA arising between August 21, 1959 and 
July 1, 1988.  
The passage of this Act shall have the effect of res 
judicata as to all parties, claims, and issues  which arise 
and defenses which have been at issue, or which could have 
been, or could in the future be, at issue, which arose 
between August 21, 1959 and July 1, 1988,  whether brought 
against the State or its officials, directly or indirectly, 
by subrogation, derivative or third party action, tender, 
federal action, or by any other means whatsoever.  
1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, § 4 at 699  (emphases in court’s order).  
18   
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The circuit court also concluded that claims and 
controversies related to the “management, administration, . . . 
or disposition” of the trust lands underlying the MKAR arose 
before July 1, 1988. The court noted that “[e]fforts to pave 
and improve MKAR began in the mid to late 1960s and continued 
through the early 1970s. When completed in 1974, pursuant to an 
agreement with DHHL, the County maintained MKAR, and the public 
has used the road for more than 50 years. ” The circuit court 
decided that because the trust had never been compensate d for 
the use of the trust lands underlying the MKAR, it was therefore 
included in the land exchange contemplated by Act 14 . The court 
held that the contemplated land exchange resolved all 
controversies or claims regarding the trust lands underlying the 
MKAR that arose between August 21, 1959 and July 1, 1988, as 
well as all future claims related to the land. The circuit 
court cited 1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, § 4 at 699 . 
The circuit court further concluded that the State’s 2018 
designation of the MKAR as a state highway did not give rise to 
any new claims , as any claims arose between August 21, 1959, and 
July 1, 1988. The circuit court cited 1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 
14, § 12 at 702 . 
19   
 
  On these grounds, the circuit court granted summary 
judgment in favor of Defendants.   Final judgment was entered on 
March 16, 2022.    11 
  
 
  
    
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
F. Appellate proceedin gs 
Plaintiffs timely appealed, and we accepted transfer of the 
appeal. On appeal, the parties generally reiterate their 
arguments in the circuit c ourt. 
Defendants additionally assert HRS § 264 -42 (2020)12 does 
not provide Plaintiffs with a private right of enforcement 
action, and even if it did, Plaintiffs lack standing to 
challenge the 2018 highway designation. 
Defendants also  assert Act 395 of 1988 preserves the 
State’s sovereign immunity for “existing projects, programs, or 
any other governmental activities which are continuing, and 
which were begun, completed, or established prior to July 1, 
1988.” Defendants cited  1988 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 395, § 4 at 
11 The circuit court can enter summary judgment in favor of a nonmoving 
party. Flint v. MacKenzie , 53 Haw. 672, 672, 501 P.2d 357, 357 (1972). 
Relief can be granted notwithstanding the fact that the party has not filed a 
demand for such relief. Id. Furthermore, our appellate courts are likewise 
so empowered. 53 Haw. at 673, 501 P.2d at 358. 
12 HRS § 264 -42 “Authority to include other public highways in the state 
highway system” provides: 
The director of transportation acting in cooperation with 
appropriate federal and county agencies, may designate for 
inclusion in the state highway system, such other public 
highways, including county highways, which are used 
primarily for through traffic and not for access to any 
specific property, whether residential business, or other 
abutting property. 
20   
 
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
945. Defendants argue that even if Plaintiffs’ claims did not 
arise before July 1, 1988, they relate to a government activity 
or project (the MKAR) that began before July 1, 1988 and 
continued thereafter. 
Plaintiffs ’ reply brief a sserts (1) Act 14 did not bar 
their claims that arose in 2018; (2) the ICA could rule on the 
State’s violation of HRS chapter 264; and (3) Plaintiffs’ claims 
are not precluded by sovereign immunity. 
Plaintiffs argue the ir claims arose on March 15, 2018 , when 
Defendants designated the MKAR a public highway and effectively 
removed the MKAR from the Hawaiian home lands trust. Plaintiffs 
claim the 2018 designation was a taking of trust lands because 
it removed maintenance and operation of the MKAR from the trust 
to the DOT, and therefore triggered new breaches of trust. They 
argue it was impossible for Act 14 to preclude claims that did 
not exist in 1988. Plaintiffs maintain their breach of trust 
claims are based on the taking of trust lands, which occurre d 
when Defendants designated the MKAR as a state highway pursuant 
to HRS chapter 264 . 
Plaintiffs contend  their claims are authorized by Act 395  
because the 2018 designation changed the status quo by 
purporting to give  Defendants jurisdiction over the MKAR; this 
new “activity” occurred after July 1, 1988, and therefore, 
sovereign immunity was waived.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Lastly, Plaintiffs argue that even if Act 395 did not waive 
sovereign immunity for damages, their remaining claims survive 
because the relief sought is  prospective in nature. Plaintiffs 
argue equity principles allow them to protect trust assets to prevent ongoing breaches of trust.  
III. Standard s of Review 
A. Summary judgment 
“On appeal, the grant or denial of summary judgment is 
reviewed de novo.” Furthermore, 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the 
pleadings, depositions, answers to 
interrogatories and admissions on file, 
together with the affidavits, if any, show that 
there is no genuine issue as to any material 
fact and that the moving party is entitled to 
judgment as a matter of law. A fact is 
material if proof of that fact would have the 
effect of establishing or refuting one of the 
essential elements of a cause of action or 
defense asserted by the parties. The evidence 
must be viewed in the light most fa vorable to 
the non-moving party. In other words, we must 
view all of the evidence and inferences drawn 
therefrom in the light most favorable to the 
party opposing the motion. 
Ralston v. Yim, 129 Hawai‘i 46, 55-56, 292 P.3d 1276, 1285-86 
(2013)  (quoting First Ins. Co. of Hawai ʻi v. A&B Props. Inc., 126 
Hawaiʻi 406, 413-14, 271 P.3d 1165, 1172-73 (2012)).  
B. Statutory interpretation 
Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law 
to be reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard. 
Our statutory construction is guided by the following well 
established principles: 
[O]ur foremost obligation is to ascertain and 
give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily 
from the language contained in the statute 
22   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
itself. And we must read statutory language in 
the context of the entire statute and construe 
it in a manner consistent with its purpose. 
When there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or 
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an 
expression used in a statute, an ambiguity 
exists. 
In construing an ambiguous statute, the meaning 
of the ambiguous words may be sought by 
examining the context, with which the ambiguous 
words, phrases, and sentences may be compared, 
in order to ascertain their true meaning. 
Moreover, the courts may resor t to extrinsic 
aids in determining legislative intent. One 
avenue is the use of legislative history as an 
interpretive tool. 
[The appellate] court may also consider the reason and 
spirit of the law, and the cause which induced the 
legislature to enact it to discover its true meaning. 
Lingle v. Hawai‘i Gov’t Emp. Ass’n, AFSCME, Local 152, AFL-CIO, 
107 Hawai‘ i 178, 183, 111 P.3d 587, 592 (2005) (internal 
quotation marks, brackets, and ellipses omitted) (quoting Guth 
v. Freeland, 96 Hawai ‘i 147, 149-50, 28 P.3d 982, 984-85 (2001)).  
IV. Discussion 
The circuit court did not address sovereign immunity other 
than the effect of Act 14 of 1995. The State, however, 
continues to raise sovereign immunity, standing, and exhaustion 
of administrative remedies as defenses. As any of them could 
bar Plaintiffs’ claims, we address them f irst.  
23   
 
   
 
 
  
 
   
 
 
  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
A. Plaintiffs’ claims are not barred by sovereign immunity, 
standing, and the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine 
1. Sovereign immunity 
“It is well established that the State as sovereign is 
immune from suit except as it consents to be sued.” Nelson, 130 
Hawai‘i at 168, 307 P.3d at 148 (quoting Figueroa v. State , 61 
Haw. 369, 381, 604 P.2d 1198, 1205 (1979)). Even if sovereign 
immunity applies, prospective relief against a state official, 
can be pursued even if there may be “a substantial ancillary 
effect on the state’s treasury”; if the relief sought is 
“tantamount to an award of damages for a past violation of law,” 
however, it is barred by sovereign immunity unless sovereign 
immunity is waived by the State. Pele Def. Fund v. Paty , 73 
Haw. 578, 609 -10, 837 P. 2d 1247, 1266 (1992) (citing Papasan v. 
Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 278 (1985)). 
Thus, Plaintiffs’ prospective claims against state 
officials are in any event not barred by sovereign immunity. 
In addressing Plaintiffs’ retrospective claims, we first 
address Act 395 of 1988, the Native Hawaiian Trusts Judicial 
Relief Act, codified in part as HRS chapter 673, which governs 
claims of mismanagement of Hawaiian home lands trust assets. 
Nelson, 130 Hawai‘i at 170, 307 P.3d at 150.  Plaintiffs ’ 
complaint asserts claims under HRS chapter 673. Compare Nelson, 
130 Hawai‘i at 171, 307 P.3d at 15 1 (holding the circuit court 
24   
 
  
  
 
 
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
would have lacked jurisdiction to hear claims alleging chapter 
673 violations because Plaintiffs’ claims were not brought under 
chapter 673 in their amended complaint).  
Chapter 673 provides a waiver of the State’s sovereign 
immunity from its effective date of July 1, 1988, as follows : 
(a)  The State waives its immunity for any breach of trust 
or fiduciary duty  resulting from the acts or omissions of 
its agents, officers and employees in the management and 
disposition of trust funds and resources of:  
(1)  The Hawaiian home lands trust under article XII, 
sections 1, 2, and 3 of the Constitution of the State 
of Hawaii [ Hawai‘i], implementing sections 4 and 5(f) 
of the Admission Act (Act of March 18, 1959, Public 
Law 86-3, 73 Stat. 4)[.]  
1988 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 395 at 943; HRS § 673 -1 (2016) 
(emphasis added). 
Section 3 of Act 395 of 1988 specified that  Act  395  did not 
apply to any cause of action which accrued, rights and duties 
that matured, penalties that were incurred, or proceedings that 
were begun, prior to July 1, 1988, its effective date. 1988 
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 395 at 945. Section 4 also indicated that 
sovereign immunity was not waived for  causes of actions, 
projects, or other governmental activities that  are continuing 
and were “begun, completed, or established prior to July 1, 
1988.” 1988 Haw. Sess . Laws Act 395 at 945.  
Defendants argue Act 395 preserved the State’s sovereign 
immunity for Plaintiffs’ claims because they accrued when the 
public began using the MKAR in the 1970s. Defendants assert 
25   
 
   
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
  
  
  
 
    
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Plaintiffs’ claims relate to a government activity (the MKAR) 
that began before July 1, 1988 and continue today.  
Defendants’ arguments lack merit because it was not until 
2018 that designation of the MKAR as a state highway removed the 
Hawaiian home lands underlying the MKAR from trust control. 
This triggered new claims unrelated to the public use and 
mismanagement claims that Act 14 of 1995 purported to settle , 
discussed below. In allowing the DOT to take the MKAR, the 
State breached its fiduciary duty to faithfully administer the 
HHCA for the benefit of Native Hawaiians. HHCA § 101(c); Ahuna, 
64 Haw. at 338, 640 P.2d at 1168. Defendants therefore waived 
sovereign immunity for the present suit. See 1988 Haw. Sess. 
Laws Act 395 at 943; HRS § 673 -1. 
Thus, even though the MKAR was constructed before July 1, 
1988, at minimum, Plaintiffs can seek prospective declaratory 
and injunctive relief for th e 2018 action. 
2. Standing 
HRS § 673-2 is titled “Right to sue,” and it provides: 
(a) Native Hawaiians as defined in section [201(a)] of the 
Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, native Hawaiian organizations, the 
office of Hawaiian affairs, Hawaiians defined as any person who 
is qualified to succeed to a homestead lease under section 209 of 
the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act 1920, as amended, shall ha ve 
the right to bring an action in the circuit courts of the State 
to resolve controversies relating to the Hawaiian home lands 
trust described in section 673 -1(a)(1). 
Plaintiffs have standing to bring this breach of trust 
action because all three individual plaintiffs are at least 
26   
 
   
 
 
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
fifty percent Native Hawaiian. 1988 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 395 at 
943; HRS § 673-2. As defined by the HHCA,  “Native Hawaiian” 
means “any descendant of not less than one -half part of the 
blood of the races inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands previous to 
1778.” HHCA § 201(a). Additionally, Plaintiffs Kanahele and 
Ayau are the current lessees of their respective homesteads 
while Plaintiff Ioane has been on the homestead waitlist since 
1980.  
3. Exhaustion of administrative remedies 
The exhaustion of administrative remedies defense also does 
not bar Plaintiffs ’ complaint. HRS § 673 -3 provides:  
Before an action may be filed in circuit court under this 
chapter, the party filing suit shall have exhausted all administrative remedies available, and shall have given not 
less than sixty days written notice prior to filing of the 
suit that unless appropriate remedial action is taken suit 
shall be filed.   All executive branch departments shall 
adopt in accordance with chapter 91, such rules as may be 
necessary to specify the procedures for exhausting any 
remedies available.   
1988 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 395 at 943 -44; HRS § 673 -3 (emphases 
added). “A plain reading of the statute indicates that 
administrative remedies must be exhausted and written 
notification of not less than sixty days must be given.” Office 
of Hawaiian Affairs v. State of Hawai‘i(“OHA”), 110 Hawai‘i 338, 
359, 133 P.3d 767, 788 (2006) (emphasis in the original) . If 
the two requirements are not fulfilled, the circuit and 
27   
 
  
 
   
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
appellate courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over the 
chapter 673 claims. Nelson, 130 Hawai‘i at 171, 307 P.3d at 151. 
In their memorandum in opposition to Plaintiffs’ MPSJ, 
Defendants argued the circuit court lacked subject matter 
jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims because Plaintiffs did not 
exhaust their administrative remedies by requesting a contested 
case hearing before the HHC. 
In response, Plaintiffs assert  they exhausted all 
administrative remedies because they “issued an intent to sue 
letter more than 60 days prior to the filing of the Complaint.” 
Additionally, Plaintiffs argued Hawaiʻi Administrative Rule 
(“HAR”)  §  10-5-31 (eff. 1981) does not require a contested case 
hearing.  
HAR § 10-5-31, titled “Contested case hearing requests,” 
provides: 
(a) Any person or agency including the commission and the 
department may request a contested case hearing and shall 
have the right and full opportunity to assert a claim 
provided that the claim is based on a law or rule over 
which the commission has jurisdiction. 
(emphases added). In the above rule, the word “may” precedes 
the word “shall.” See  Ling v. Yokoyama, 91 Hawai‘i 131, 133, 980 
P.2d 1005, 1007  (Haw. App. 1999).  
In such a context, the Hawai ‘i Supreme Court has advised 
that “[w]here both mandatory and directory verbs are used 
in the same statute, especially where ‘shall’ and ‘may’ are 
used in close juxtaposition, we infer that the legislature 
realized the difference in meaning and intended that the 
verbs used should carry with them their o rdinary meanings.”  
28   
 
  
  
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Id. (citation omitted ). As defined in Black’s Law Dictionary 
(11th ed. 2019), “shall” means “[h]as a duty to; more broadly, 
is required to . . . [t]his is the mandatory sense[.]” In 
contrast, “may” is defined as “[t]o be permitted to . . . [t]o 
be a possibility.” Id. 
Plaintiffs assert that they could have, but were not 
required to request a contested case hearing. Had Plaintiffs 
done so, they would have been guaranteed the opportunity to 
assert their claims. HAR § 10 -5-31. 
Plaintiffs alternatively argue that it would have been 
futile to seek a contested case hearing.   This court has held 
that “an aggrieved party need not exhaust administrative 
remedies where no effective remedies exist.” Kellberg  v. Yuen, 
131 Hawai‘ i 513,  531, 319 P.3d 432,  450  (2014)  (quoting Williams 
v. Aona, 121 Hawai ʻi 1, 11, 210 P.3d 501, 511 (2009)). Futility 
“refers to the inability of an administrative process to provide the appropriate relief.” Id.  (citing In re Doe Children, 96 
Hawai‘i 272, 287 n.20, 30 P.3d 878, 893 n.20 (2001)).  
Here, requesting a contested case hearing would have been 
futile given the “Joint Statement on the Jurisdiction of Mauna Kea Access Road” that was released on August 30, 2019.
   The 13
29 13   Joint Statement on the Jurisdiction of Mauna Kea Access Road, 
Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (Aug. 30, 2019),   
 
    
 
   
 
 
 
  
     
 
  
 
 
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
joint statement, which was issued by various agencies including 
the DHHL, stated the MKAR was under the control and jurisdiction 
of the DOT. Id. It is self-evident that Plaintiffs lacked an 
effective administrative remedy where the DHHL had already 
issued a public statement asserting the DOT now had jurisdiction 
over the MKAR. See Kellberg , 131 Hawai‘i at 531, 319 P.3d at 
450. 
Hence, w e need not decide whether Plaintiffs were required 
to request a contested case hearing because, as they correctly 
argue, such a request would have been futile. 
HRS § 673 -3 also contains a sixty-day-notice requirement. 
See OHA, 110 Hawai‘i at 359, 133 P.3d at 788.  Plaintiffs assert 
they served Defendants a notice to sue letter on or about

illegally taken from the trust for roads and highways .

We, Native Hawaiian beneficiaries, Kanahele, Ioane,

(Emphases added .) 
Plaintiffs’ letter unambiguously notified Defendants that 
suit would be filed in not less than sixty days “unless 
appropriate remedial action [was] taken.” HRS § 673 -3. 
Defendants admitted in their answer that Plaintiffs submitted 
the letter to them. Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on 
February 20, 2020 . 
Plaintiffs therefore also met the statutory prerequisites 
for filing suit.14 
B. Act 14 of 1995 also does not preclude Plaintiffs’ claims 
The core issue then is whether Act 14 of 1995 precludes 
Plaintiffs’ suit. We agree with Plaintiffs that , at minimum, 
the State’s transfer of the portion of the MKAR at issue from 
the DHHL to the DOT is a new claim outside the scope of Act 14 
of 1995. Additionally, we hold that the MKAR is not a state 
The two-year statute of limitations begins when the cause of action 
accrues. HRS § 673 -10. Plaintiffs’ suit is timely because the DOT’s taking 
of the MKAR occurred in March 2018 , and Plaintiffs filed their complaint in 
February 2020.

highway because the State did not follow the proper process for 
removing Hawaiian home lands from the trust. 
1. Act 14 of 1995 
As noted above, Act 395 of 1988 waived sovereign immunity 
only for new claims arising after its July 1, 1988 effective 
date. The primary purposes of Act 14 of 1995 were to address 
claims before Act 395’s effective date and to: 
(1)  Resolve all controversies relating to the Hawaiian 
home lands trust which arose between August 21, 1959 
and July 1, 1988 ;  
(2)  Prohibit any and all future claims against the State 
resulting out of any controversy relating to the 
Hawaiian home lands trust which arose between August 
21, 1959 and July 1, 1988 ;  
(3) Resolve all controversies after 1920 and prior to 
July 1, 1988 relating to the validity of patents 
issued and affecting any lands covered by or 
allegedly covered by HHCA and to all rights arising 
from or relating to such patents as issued; 
(4) Appropriate such funds and provide additional means 
as may be necessary to accomplish the intent and 
purpose of this Act; 
(5) Establish a trust fund to provide a substantial, 
secure, and predictable funding source for the 
department of Hawaiian home lands to use or to 
effectuate the purpose of the HHCA ; 
(6) Further the public interest by ensuring that claims 
which have arisen or may arise in the future with 
respect to the administration of the Hawaiian home 
lands trust and are brought pursuant to chapters 673 
and 674, [HRS], are resolved in a fair, complete, and 
timely manner. 
1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, § 2 at 698 (emphases added). The 
legislature found that resolving such claims against the State 
was in the best interests of the State and the beneficiaries 
“due to the difficulty, time, uncertainty, disruption of public 
purposes, impact on the public land trust and private 
32   
 
  
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
landowners, and expense of judicial resolution of remaining 
disputed claims.”   1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, § 1 at 697.  
Also, section 4 of Act 14 provides in relevant part:  
The passage of this Act is in full satisfaction and 
resolution of all controversies  at law and in equity, known 
or unknown, now existing or hereafter arising, established 
or inchoate, arising out of or in any way connected with 
the management, administration, supervision of the trust, or disposition by the State or any governmental agency of  
any lands or interests in land  which are or were or are 
alleged to have been Hawaiian home lands, or to have been 
covered by the HHCA arising between August 21, 1959 and 
July 1, 1988.  
The passage of this Act shall have the effect of res 
judicata  as to all parties, claims, and issues which arise 
and defenses which have been at issue, or which could have 
been, or could in the future, be at issue, which arose 
between August 21, 1959 and July 1, 1988,  whether brought 
against the State or its officials, directly or indirectly, 
by subrogation, derivative or third party action, tender, 
federal action, or by any other means whatsoever.  
1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, § 4 at 699 (emphases added).  
 Section 6 provides  Act 14 would resolve and satisfy all 
controversies and claims encompassed by the Act through:  
(2) The transfer of lands and resolution of claims in the Waimanalo, Anahola, Kamalomalo, and Moloaa areas; the compensation for all remaining confirmed uncompensated 
public uses of Hawaiian home lands; the initiation of a 
land exchange to remedy uncompensated use of Hawaiian home 
lands for state roads claims and highway.  
1995 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 14, § 6 at 700 (emphasis added). 
33  Subsection (2) of section 6 is salient. Plaintiffs assert 
Act 14 does not preclude their claims because it only addressed  
breaches of trust occurring  between August 21, 1959 and July 1, 
1988. Plaintiffs allege breaches of trust that occurred in 2018  
when the MKAR was designated a state highway, and the DOT 
assumed exclusive control and jurisdiction of the MKAR.    
 
   
 
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The parties agree the MKAR was built in 1964 and the public 
has used the road since construction was completed in the 1970s. 
It is further undisputed that the land exchange under Act 14 
that was to provide compensation for public  use of the MKAR 
until 1988 has not  been completed. According to Defendants, 
“[a]s of 2019, completion of parts of Act 14’s land transfer and 
exchange requirements remained outstanding, including 
compensation of approximately 346.203 acres to satisfy the 
[A]ct’s roads and highways  land exchange requirement.”    
Thus, Act 14 has not actually resolved the uncompensated 
public use of the MKAR from 1959 -1988. The State has failed to 
remedy issues concerning the MKAR.15 And even if Act 14’s land 
exchange could preclude claim s based on use of the MKAR until 
1988, Plaintiffs can still sue to enforce the provisions of Act 
14: 
Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the State 
and its officials, the members of the board, the members of 
the Commission and the independent representative shall not 
be subject to any suit by any party on any decision 
relating to the resolution of these claims, except for 
actions to enforce the provisions of this Act . 
1995 Sess. Laws Act 14, § 17 at 703 (emphasis added) . 
34 15   In 2021, the House passed a resolution which requested “the 
establishment of a working group to assess the status of Act 14.” H.R. 76, 
S.D. 2, 31st Leg., Reg. Sess. (2021).  The  resolution noted it was unknown 
whether all state land claims under the HHCA had been settled pursuant to Act 
14. Id.   The legislature also emphasized its concern about “[t]he 
outstanding status of certain elements such as the Mauna Kea Access Road.” 
Id.   The resolution requested the working group submit a report prior to the 
convening of the Regular Session of 2022. Id.   As of January  2024,  no report 
has been submitted.    
 
  
   
  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Plaintiffs have made it clear, however, that they are not 
seeking to enforce a land exchange. 
Although Plaintiffs appeared to have been asserting claims 
arising out of the uncompensated use of the MKAR before 1988, 
their recent filings clarify that their claims arise out of the 
2018 designation of the MKAR as a state highway. We agree with 
Plaintiffs that Act 14 is in any event inapplicable to their 
claims arising out of the 2018 transfer because they do not 
arise out of the “uncompensated use” of the MKAR that Act 14 
allegedly settled. Plaintiffs appropriately assert “Act 14 
could not have resolved [their] claims to fix the taking . . . 
and control over trust lands because that was not at issue in 
1988.” 
2. Failure to comply with the HHCA 
 In addition, Plaintiffs’ breach of trust claims arising out 
of the 2018 designation are not barred because of the State’s 
failure to comply with the HHCA.  
35  Pursuant to the HHCA, lands that are designated as Hawaiian 
home lands are under the control of the DHHL  and must be used 
and disposed of in accordance with the HHCA. HHCA § 204(a)  
(emphasis added). The DHHL is the only agency allowed to remove 
such land from the Hawaiian home lands trust via a land exchange 
or sale. See  HHCA §§ 204(a)(3) and 205. Lands designated as 
Hawaiian home lands may be “sold or leased . . . [i]n the manner   
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and for the purposes set out in” the HHCA. HHCA § 205. 
Alternatively, if a land exchange is initiated, the Secretary of 
the Interior must approve the transaction. HHCA § 204.   
§ 204. Control by department of “available lands,” return 
to board of land and natural resources, when; other lands, 
use of. (a) Upon the passage of this Act, all available 
lands shall immediately  assume the status of Hawaiian home 
lands and be under the control of the department  to be used 
and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of this Act[.]  
 . . . . 
(3)  The department, with the approval of the 
Secretary of the Interior,  in order to consolidate its 
holdings or to better effectuate the purposes of this Act, 
may exchange the title to available lands for land, 
privately or publicly owned, of an equal value.  
HHCA § 204(a) and (a)(3) (emphases added).  
A land exchange is  
any transaction, other than a sale, that transfers Hawaiian home lands from the Hawaiian Home Lands Trust to another 
entity and in which the Hawaiian Home Lands Trust receives 
the entity ’s land as Hawaiian home lands.   A land exchange 
can involve trading Hawaiian home lands for private land, 
but it can also involve trading land between the Hawaiian 
Home Lands Trust and State or Federal agencies.  
43 C.F.R.  § 47.10  (eff.  2016)  (emphasis  added). When an 
exchange is proposed, the Chair of the HHC must submit to the 
Secretary multiple documents, including a “summary of all consultations with beneficiaries.” 43 C.F.R. § 47.60.  
Consultation or consult  means representatives of the 
government engaging in an open discussion process that 
allows interested parties to address potential issues, 
changes, or actions. Consultation does not necessarily 
require formal face -to-face meetings.  The complexity of 
the matter along with the potential effects that the matter
may have on the Trust or beneficiaries will dictate the 
appropriate process for consultation.   Consultation 
requires dialogue (oral, electronic, or printed) or a good 
faith dialogue or documented effort to engage with the 
beneficiaries, consideration of their views, and, where  
36   
 
  
 
   
     
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
feasible, seek agreement with the beneficiaries when 
engaged in the land exchange process. 
43 C.F.R. § 47.10(emphases added). The Secretary will 
approve land exchanges that advance the interests of the 
beneficiaries. 43 C .F.R. § 47.20 (eff. 2016). 
From 1907 to 1976, it appears Humu‘ula Hawaiian home lands 
were under DLNR  management and leased to Parker Ranch. In April 
1976, the DLNR returned management of Humu ‘ula to DHHL.  The 
County of Hawai‘ i took over maintenance of the MKAR in 1974 and 
again in 1983. Pursuant to HHCA § 220(a), “roads through or 
over Hawaiian home lands, . . . shall be maintained by the 
county in which the particular road or roads to be maintained 
are located.” Until 2018, the DHHL maintained control and 
jurisdiction over the MKAR while the County of Hawai ‘i undertook 
maintenance responsibilities. See  HHCA § 220(a).  
However, the DHHL’s control and jurisdiction over the MKAR 
was abruptly ended in 2018 when the DOT designated the MKAR a state highway. The “Joint Statement on the Jurisdiction of 
Mauna Kea Access Road” issued in 2019 by the Department of the 
AG, DHHL, and DOT stated  the DOT, not the DHHL, controlled the 
MKAR:  
Mauna Kea Access Road is under the control and jurisdiction 
of DOT.   Pursuant to HRS § 26- 19 and HRS Ch. 264, DOT has 
control and jurisdiction over all state highways and Mauna Kea Access Road is designated to DOT’s State Highway System as Route 210.   This includes any portions of the road that 
cross over DHHL land.  
37   
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“State DOT has controlled and maintained Mauna Kea Access 
Road since it  became  part  of  our  highways  system  in  2018,” 
said DOT Deputy Director Ed Sniffen.   “Prior to that time, 
sections of the road situated on Hawaiian home lands were 
maintained by the County of Hawai‘i [Hawai ‘i] pursuant to 
a  Memorandum  of  Agreement  (MOA)  between DHHL and the County 
of Hawai‘i [Hawai ‘i].”  
Beneficiaries of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 
do not own Mauna Kea Access Road.   Act 14 (1995) resolved 
all claims concerning the use of Hawaiian home lands for 
public roads and highways built before and after statehood.  
In response to concerns that some compensation remains 
outstanding, DHHL and the [DLNR] have been working together 
to evaluate the terms of compensation and to confirm that 
it has been made in full. This process, however, does not 
alter the fact that all claims regarding use of roads and 
highways crossing DHHL lands has been resolved.  
“Act 14 was a historic piece of legislation,” said Hawaiian 
Homes Commission Chair William J. Aila [Ailā ]  Jr. “It 
resolved long -standing claims associated with the use of 
Hawaiian home lands. We remain committed to seeing the completion of the few remaining items under Act 14, 
including ensuring that compensation for the use of roads 
and highways crossing DHHL lands has been received in full.”  
“The State is reviewing the compensation issues related to 
the use of Hawaiian home lands for public roads and 
highways, and will ensure they have been addressed,” stated 
Attorney General Clare E. Connors.   “The public is reminded 
that Mauna Kea Access Road is a public road controlled by DOT and that the current blockade is unlawful.”   
At this time, DOT has restricted access on Mauna Kea Access 
Road to preserve public health and safety, and to carry out 
its responsibilities under HRS Ch. 264.[16] 
(Emphases added.)  
Defendants argue it is irrelevant which entity asserted 
jurisdiction and control over the MKAR “because Plaintiffs’

Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (Aug. 30, 2019),

breach of trust claims stem from the uncompensated use of MKAR 
as a public road, which indisputably started prior to July 1, 
1988 and continues to the present day.”  
Defendants are wrong. The 2018 designation of the MKAR as 
a state highway wrongfully transferred control over Hawaiian 
home lands from DHHL to DOT. The 2019 joint statement — 
carrying the authority of the Attorney General and DHHL — 
confirmed the illegal taking . The State’s failure to abide by 
proper procedures for disposing trust land constituted a new 
breach of trust not barred by Act 14 of 1995. 
Further, and critically , the land transfer protections of 
the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act attach when, as here, there is 
no transfer of legal title to the land. Based on counsel’s 
statements at oral argument, fee title to the MKAR was not 
transferred out of the trust. The only documents in the record 
that divulge what happened between the DHHL and the DOT are the 
internal memo requesting designation of the MKAR as a state 
highway, and the later joint statement on jurisdiction. The 
land does not appear to have been sold or leased, as there is no 
deed of conveyance, lease, or any other record of the alienation 
of fee title to the land. 
But the State’s actions created an effective taking of the 
MKAR  —   enough to implicate the purposes of the Hawaiian Home 
Lands trust and trigger the protections imposed by the HHCA.  
39   
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
As the joint statement curtly  and wrongly asserted, 
“[b]eneficiaries of the [HHCA] do not own Mauna Kea Access Road. 
Act 14 (1995) resolved all claims concerning the use of Hawaiian 
home lands for public roads and highways built before and after 
statehood.”  
The principal purposes of the HHCA include: 
(1) Establishing a permanent land base for the 
benefit and use of native Hawaiians, upon which they may 
live, farm, ranch, and otherwise engage in commercial or 
industrial or any other activities as authorized in this 
Act; 
(2) Placing native Hawaiians on the lands set aside 
under this Act in a prompt and efficient manner and 
assuring long -term tenancy to beneficiaries of this Act and 
their successors; 
(3) Preventing alienation of the fee title to the 
lands  set aside under this Act so that these lands will 
always be held in trust for continued use by native 
Hawaiians in perpetuity;  
(4) Providing adequate amounts of water and 
supporting infrastructure, so that homestead lands will 
always be usable and accessible; and 
(5) Providing financial support and technical 
assistance to native Hawaiian beneficiaries of this Act so 
that by pursuing strategies to enhance economic self -
sufficiency and promote community -based development, the 
traditions, culture and quality of life of native Hawaiians 
shall be forever self -sustaining. 
HHCA § 101 (emphasis added). 
Here, DOT’s unilateral designation of the MKAR as a public 
highway took almost all property rights from DHHL.   As the 
Plaintiffs point out in their reply brief,  
The 2018 designation unilaterally removed the “maintenance and operation” of the road from the home lands trust and 
placed it with DOT for the first time and in a way that was 
never done with any other agency previously. HRS § 26 -19. 
The designation allows  DOT to close and restrict use of the 
Access Road at its own discretion. It prohibits DHHL and 
beneficiaries from installing infrastructure on or near the 
road without obtaining a written permit. HRS § 264 -6. It 
prohibits DHHL and beneficiaries from connecting a new road 
40   
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
or access to the Access Road without a DOT permit. HRS § 
264-14. It allows DOT and the governor to further encumber 
or alienate the Access Road by granting “easements within” 
and “access rights along” the Access Road and adjoining 
trust lands. HRS § 264 -13. It gives DOT the ability to seek 
fines or imprisonment of “any person, including any public officer or employee” including DHHL and their beneficiaries who do not obtain required permits from DOT. HRS § 264 -12.  
And DOT can only designate a road as a state highway if it owns 
that road.  HRS § 264-1.  How could DOT designate the MKAR a 
state highway if it did not own it? Through the designation, DOT 
took from DHHL and the beneficiaries the right to control, the 
right to exclude, the right to encumber, and the right use the 
land for non-trust  purposes.   So, apart from retaining legal 
title, what other sticks in the property bundle did DHHL have 
left?  
 Granted, the HHCA provisions regarding selling, leasing, 
and exchanging land in the trust do not clearly account for when 
another entity takes rights to the land not including title —  as 
DOT did here.  Nonetheless, any transfer of land from DHHL to another entity ought to and must proceed “in the manner and for the purposes set out in [the HHCA].”  HHCA § 205.   To allow land 
to transfer without doing so would be to ignore the HHCA’s rehabilitative and trust purposes.  See  HHCA § 101. 
 
41  The result here is that both DOT and DHHL are at fault. DOT 
did not have the authority to unilaterally designate the MKAR as 
a state highway.   And although the record is unclear as to 
DHHL’s actions in 2018, it certainly should not have   
 
  
 
 
 
   
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
relinquished “control and jurisdiction” without consulting with 
the beneficiaries as required by 43 C.F.R. § 47.   Such 
acquiescence deprived Native Hawaiian beneficiaries of income 
from and use of the land —  an abandonment of m ālama ‘āina, or 
care for the land.   DHHL’s own Beneficiary Consultation Policy  
emphasizes the point here:  17
As an agency entrusted to administer, manage, and 
invest trust resources to accomplish a variety of goals and 
objectives that benefit native Hawaiians and their 
successors, the Hawaiian Homes Commission and Department of 
Hawaiian Home Lands recognizes that meaningful, timely and 
effective beneficiary consultation is essential to the 
successful implementation of Commission/Department 
policies, programs and projects. 
 To relinquish control of the road leading to Maunakea, a 
site of major spiritual significance to Native Hawaiians,  
without the type of “meaningful, timely, and effective 
beneficiary consultation” that is “essential to the successful 
implementation of Commission/Department policies, programs[,] 
and projects,” is to breach the fiduciary duty imparted by the 
HHCA.  Critical to the protections of the HHCA is transparency, 
an element that was sorely lacking here.  Before control of and 
jurisdiction over trust land leaves DHHL (even if legal title 18

does not) like it did here, DHHL must consult with the 
beneficiaries.19 
Thus, land designated as Hawaiian home lands must remain 
under the control of the DHHL  unless the land is sold or 
exchanged  consistent with the HHCA. See  HHCA §§  204 (a)(3),  
205. There is nothing in the record indicating  a land exchange 
or sale was completed pursuant to HHCA §§  204(a)(3) and 205 that 
legally removed the Hawaiian home lands underlying the MKAR from 
the trust.   Moreover, it appears beneficiaries were never 
consulted prior to the taking  as required by 43 C.F.R.  § 47.10. 
The DOT’s 2018 designation of the MKAR as a state highway and 
the joint statement’s assertion that the MKAR “is under the 
control and jurisdiction of DOT” clearly violate the HHCA.  
The State blatantly disregarded unambiguous requirements 
of the HHCA, and in doing so, breached its constitutional and 
fiduciary obligation to faithfully carry out the HHCA. Haw. 
Const. art. XII, § 2; Ahuna, 64 Haw. at 338, 640 P.2d at 1168 . 
The 2018 designation, which took away the DHHL’s control 
over the MKAR and transferred it to the DOT, therefore triggered 
new claims unrelated to the public use and mismanagement claims

that arose between August 21, 1959 and July 1, 1988. Act 14 
simply does not preclude Plaintiffs’ suit.  
Section 1 of Act 14 indicates  the legislature believed the 
final resolution of Hawaiian home lands claims against the State 
was “necessary and in the best interests of the State and 
beneficiaries of the trust” given the uncertainty and expense of 
judicial resolution of such claims. 1995 Haw. Sess. Laws  Act 14

represent[ed] an opportunity to effectuate the purposes of the

the principal purposes of the HHCA include:

benefit and use of native Hawaiians, upon which they may 
live, farm, ranch, and otherwise engage in commercial or 
industrial or any other activities as authorized in this

ignores the fundamental issue that the State took Hawaiian home 
lands in contravention of the HHCA. Beneficiaries cannot reap 
the benefits of the trust if they are prevented from enforcing 
the law that was created to contribute to their prosperity. Act 
14 was intended to efficiently resolve beneficiaries’ claims; it 
did not enable the State to take trust land and avoid legal 
consequences. The DOT’s act in 2018 of assuming control over 
the MKAR is beyond any controversy Act 14 purported to settle 
and violates the HHCA.  
3. HRS § 673-4 provides relief for Plaintiffs 
In their complaint, Plaintiffs request the circuit court, 
inter alia, “[a]ward land and/or money damages to restore the 
Hawaiian home lands trust[.]” HRS § 673 -4 (2016) provides the 
type of relief available for a suit brought under the chapter: 
[§673-4] Scope of relief.  (a) In an action under this 
chapter[,] the court may only award land or monetary 
damages to restore the trust which has been depleted as a 
result of any breach of trust duty  and no award shall be 
made directly to or for the individual benefit of any 
particular person not charged by law with the 
administration of the trust property; provided that actual damages may be awarded to a successful plaintiff.  
(Emphasis added.) Plaintiffs’  request matches the relief 
authorized under chapter 673. See  Nelson, 130 Hawai‘i at 171, 
307 P.3d at 151. Consequently,  Plaintiffs may receive land or 
money damages  for claims after 2018.

C. HRS chapter 264 
Plaintiffs also argue “Defendants violated its own 
authorizing statute when it designated the [MKAR] a State 
Highway without a deed of conveyance or order of condemnation.” 
Defendants do not dispute that HRS chapter 264 procedures were 
not followed . They instead argue that Plaintiffs are prohibited 
from challenging the 2018 designation of MKAR as a state highway 
under HRS § 264 -42 because the statute does not create a private 
right of enforcement action, and even if it did, Plaintiffs do 
not have standing. 
It is not necessary to analyze the merits of the parties’ 
arguments regarding HRS chapter 264 because, as explained in 
Section IV.B., the 2018 designation of the MKAR as a state 
highway constituted a breach of the State’s constitutional and 
fiduciary obligation to faithfully carry out the HHCA. Haw. 
Const. art. XII, § 2; Ahuna, 64 Haw. at 338, 640 P.2d at 1168 . 
Lands that are designated as Hawaiian home lands are under the 
control of the DHHL and must be used and disposed of in 
accordance with the HHCA. See HHCA § 204(a). The DHHL failed 
to prevent the DOT from illegally assuming control and 
jurisdiction over the MKAR in 2018. 
It is troubling that the DOT unilaterally designated the 
MKAR as a state highway via an internal memo. Instead of 
following the procedures for a land exchange or sale as

described in HHCA sections 204(a)(3) and 205 and 43 C .F.R. part 
47, the State -particularly the HHC members and DHHL -
blatantly breached their fiduciary duties by allowing the 
illegal taking and then failing to remedy the designation that 
violated the HHCA. Hence, the MKAR was not properly designated 
a state highway. 
V. Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, t he circuit court’s grant of 
summary judgment to Defendants was erroneous.   We therefore 
vacate the circuit court’s order granting summary judgment to 
Defendants and remand with instructions to enter an order 
granting summary judgment to Plaintiffs  and  for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
