APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

DECEMBER 29, 2023 
 RECKTENWALD, C.J., McKENNA, AND EDDINS, JJ., 
CIRCUIT JUDGE BROWNING, IN PLACE OF NAKAYAMA, J., RECUSED, AND CIRCUIT JUDGE KAWASHIMA, ASSIGNED BY REASON OF VACANCY 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
This case concerns the amount of just compensation the 
Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation (“HART”) must pay 
for approximately two acres worth of easements on property previously owned by Victoria Ward, Limited (“Victoria Ward”). 
That property is located in Victoria Ward’s multi-billion dollar 
Ward Village development in the Kaka‘ ako neighborhood of O‘ ahu. 
HART obtained the easements to construct portions of its fixed rail system and a proposed 
Kaka‘ako Station.   
5  
 
 
   
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Victoria Ward seeks just compensation from HART for 
the takings. Victoria Ward’s claimed damages are comprised of 
the fair market value of easements on Victoria Ward’s property, 
plus between $65 million and over $100 million for alleged 
severance damages. 
Severance damages compensate property owners for 
devaluation of non-taken portions of property. In addition to seeking damages for lost development opportunities, Victoria 
Ward claims that it was forced to modify, redesign, and/or 
relocate other building plans in a manner resulting in less 
efficient, less valuable, and less profitable projects relative 
to what the development could have been worth absent rail and 
the associated takings. 
The circuit court granted a dozen summary judgment 
motions, which are the subject of this interlocutory appeal.
1 
These summary judgment orders touch on a wide variety of 
disputes. Most importantly, the circuit court ruled that 
Victoria Ward is estopped from seeking severance damages, though 
the orders also address such issues as the appropriate valuation 
methodology for lost parking spaces, the extent to which a party 
may be entitled to just compensation for a speculative 
construction project, and the effect of pre-dispute 
1 The Honorable John M. Tonaki presided. 
2  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
communications and local ordinances on a condemnee’s ability to 
seek just compensation. In addition to appealing the partial 
summary judgment orders, the parties appeal an order pausing the 
accrual of blight of summons interest, and two orders denying or 
denying in part motions to strike. 
We acknowledge the factual and legal complexity of 
this case, and the circuit court’s legitimate concern with narrowing the issues for trial. However, we conclude that in 
several circumstances, the circuit court incorrectly used 
summary judgment to resolve disputed factual issues. Most 
notably, the question of whether Victoria Ward is estopped from 
seeking severance damages involves disputed questions of fact 
and should be presented to a jury. 
We affirm (1) the orders granting HART’s partial 
summary judgment motions 2 and 7, (2) the orders granting Victoria Ward’s partial summary judgment motions 1 and 3, and 
(3) the order pausing blight of summons damages accrual during 
pendency of this appeal. We affirm in part and vacate in part 
the order granting HART’s partial summary judgment motion 1. 
We vacate (1) the orders granting HART’s partial 
summary judgment motions 3, 5, 9, 10, and 11; and (2) the orders 
granting Victoria Ward’s partial summary judgment motions 2 and 
4. 
3  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
We dismiss (1) HART’s cross-appeal concerning the 
denial of their motion to strike J. Douglas Ing’s declaration 
and (2) HART’s appeal concerning the grant in part and denial in 
part of their motion to strike Brian Lee’s and Steven J. Scott’s 
respective declarations. 
We remand the case to the circuit court for further 
proceedings. 
 II. BACKGROUND 
A. Factual Overview 
1. The takings 
This appeal arises out of a condemnation action filed 
in 2018 by the City & County of Honolulu (“C&C”) acting by and through HART, against Victoria Ward to take multiple acres of 
Victoria Ward’s sixty-acre “master-planned and permitted, mixed-
use development community” located in 
Kaka‘ako (“Ward Village”).  
The purpose of the taking was to construct a segment of railway and the proposed Kakaʻ ako Station within Ward Village. 
In its current state, Ward Village is planned to 
comprise six distinct “land blocks.” 
All of the physical 
takings by HART occur on Land Block 1 and Land Block 5, and the Kaka‘ako Station is slated to be built on Land Block 1 in a 
manner that would sever the property. The location of the Kaka‘ako Station was central to two summary judgment orders on 
appeal, as Victoria Ward alleges that the Station prevents it 
4  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
from building a sixth condominium tower on Land Block 1 (the 
“Lost Tower”). 
A critical question before this court is whether 
Victoria Ward’s severance damages claims are legally 
compensable, or if Victoria Ward is precluded from seeking 
severance damages due in large part to: (1) the Master Plan 
Permit language requiring a future rail project to be “addressed and incorporated” by Victoria Ward; (2) Victoria Ward’s 
continued compliance with the Master Plan Permit, including 
physically modifying structures in order to accommodate rail; 
and (3) Victoria Ward’s enjoyment of benefits in the form of 
preferential development opportunities and the receipt of 
billions of dollars in revenue as a result of the Master Plan 
Permit. 
2. Ward Village planning and permitting 
The Hawaiʻi Community Development Authority (“HCDA”) is 
a key player in this dispute, though not a party to this appeal. HCDA is vested with rulemaking, planning, development, and 
financing authority with the mission of re-developing the 
Kakaʻako area. 
S
ee
 Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) §§ 206E-4, 
-
7, -31, -33 (2014). 
HCDA established rules and development 
plans for the Kakaʻako neighborhood, including the “Mauka Rules” 
first enacted in 1982 and subsequently amended numerous times. The Mauka Rules were promulgated in order to re-plan the Kakaʻ ako 
5  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
neighborhood to meet various community needs including 
affordable housing, public facilities and open spaces, and mixed 
pedestrian-oriented and mixed-use development. Hawai‘i 
Administrative Rules (“HAR”) § 15-22-1 (repealed 2011). 
In April 2008, Victoria Ward’s predecessor in 
interest, General Growth Properties, Incorporated (“GGP”), 
submitted a planned development application for Ward Village 
(“Master Plan Submittal” or “Submittal”).2 The HCDA reviewed the 
Master Plan Submittal because HCDA has planning jurisdiction 
over the Kaka‘ako district, where Ward Village is located. 
HCDA approved Victoria Ward’s Master Plan Submittal 
and issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and 
Decision and Order for a Master Plan Permit (“Master Plan Permit” or “Permit”) in 2009. 
In the Master Plan Permit, HCDA 
noted that it reviewed the Master Plan Submittal to ensure that it was “consistent with the provisions of the Mauka Area Plan 
and [Rules].” 
Planned developments like Ward Village benefit from 
greater planning flexibility in exchange for public benefits 
provided via the development project. See HAR §§ 15-22-110 to 
2 The 2005 Mauka Rules were in effect at the time the Ward Village 
Master Plan Permit was approved by HCDA. See Mauka Area Rules, 15 HAR 
Chapter 22 (repealed 2011). Thus, Ward Village was subject to the provisions 
of the 2005 Mauka Rules and their detailed development regulations. HAR 
§ 15-22-8 (repealed 2011). 
6  
 
 
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
-121.  HCDA, through the Mauka Rules, encouraged particular 
forms of development in an “incentive zoning system.” 
HAR § 15-22-110(c) (repealed 2011). The incentives available to 
developers under the 2005 Mauka Rules included benefits like 
preferential height limitations and greater density allowances. 
Id. Victoria Ward sought several modifications to development 
rules for their planned projects, and HCDA reviewed the requests on a project-by-project basis. 
The Master Plan Permit itself does not entitle 
Victoria Ward to develop individual projects, and Victoria Ward 
is required to obtain a project permit from HCDA for each 
individual building project. As of 2018, HCDA had allegedly 
granted Victoria Ward seven individual project permits for 
condominium projects, and numerous permits for commercial developments comprising one-half of the total development 
allowable under the Master Plan Permit. 
The Master Plan Submittal did not explicitly 
illustrate a Kakaʻ ako Station within Ward Village, and Victoria 
Ward asserts that the Submittal instead reflects plans to build 
the Kaka‘ ako Station “on or above Queen Street (rather than its 
currently planned location by HART on Victoria Ward’s 
property).” Further, the Master Plan Submittal reflects plans 
to build a 240-foot mixed residential/office mid-rise building 
7  
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
on Land Block 1 over the parcel that HART now proposes as the 
site of the Kaka‘ ako Station. 
The Master Plan Permit enumerated sixteen detailed 
conditions on Victoria Ward’s development of Ward Village, 
including requirements for open space, cultural preservation, 
and reserved housing. None of the conditions explicitly refers 
to a rail project. Instead, the rail project is referenced in 
Paragraph 85 of the Master Plan Permit’s Findings of Fact 
section which states in relevant part: 
High Capacity Transit Corridor and Station: The City 
and County of Honolulu’s (“C&C”) High Capacity Transit 
proposal could have a major impact on the proposed Master 
Plan. The C&C’s current preferred transit route is 
situated within the Mauka portion of the master plan area. The proposed location of the transit station will influence 
access to residential areas and places of employment. [Victoria Ward] and the C&C have been engaged in 
discussions regarding the precise alignment and exact 
location for the transit station within the Master Plan 
area, and will continue to do so. As part of individual 
project development permit applications for this area, a 
more detailed transit route and station location shall be 
addressed and incorporated. 
(Second emphasis added.) 
The “addressed and incorporated” language of Paragraph 
85 of the Master Plan Permit was central to many of the circuit 
court’s partial summary judgment orders, and it plays a key role 
in a number of the interlocutory appeals before this court. 
In December 2010, Victoria Ward and HCDA entered into 
the Master Plan Development Agreement for the Ward Neighborhood Master Plan (“Master Plan Development Agreement” or “Development 
8  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Agreement”), which granted Victoria Ward the right to develop 
Ward Village under the Master Plan Permit. The Development 
Agreement also stated that Victoria Ward would proceed in 
compliance with the Permit and that the Permit’s terms and 
conditions would “remain in full force and effect.” The 
Development Agreement specified that the Master Plan Permit 
would last for a term of fifteen years, and it is set to expire on January 14, 2024. 
In addition to the language in Paragraph 85 of the 
Master Plan Permit, requiring a future rail route and station 
location to be “addressed and incorporated,” Victoria Ward and 
its predecessor in interest, GGP, made numerous representations 
to public authorities stating that rail would be integrated into 
Ward Village. The Master Plan Submittal itself referred to “connections with a balanced set of transportation modes,” 
“[e]fficient and alternative transportation modes,” and 
“[t]ransportation oriented development connections.” A 
subsequent project application submitted by Victoria Ward five 
years later stated that “[t]he rail station is planned to the 
[s]outh of the site and will further enhance public 
transportation options.” HART asserts that Victoria Ward used 
similar statements to attract investment and sell units to the 
public, generating more than two billion dollars in revenue. 
9  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Based on the Master Plan Permit’s “addressed and 
incorporated” language and Victoria Ward’s subsequent conduct 
and representations, the circuit court granted HART’s motion for 
partial summary judgment (“MPSJ") No. 3, precluding Victoria 
Ward from seeking the vast majority of the severance damages 
allegedly resulting from HART’s taking. HART’S MPSJ No. 3 
itself was central to the court’s orders granting MPSJ Nos. 5, concluding that Victoria Ward’s claim relating to the “Lost 
Tower” — or a luxury condominium tower on the site of the 
Kaka‘ako Station — is too speculative, and 11, concluding that 
Victoria Ward’s claims for severance damages for modifications 
to buildings fail as a matter of law. 
Neither party disputes that Victoria Ward is entitled 
to some form of just compensation. Rather, a significant 
portion of the interlocutory appeals concern Victoria Ward’s 
ability to collect severance damages for impacts to non-taken 
properties. The alleged impacts to Ward Village properties 
include stairwell enclosure, increased screening, and noise mitigation, among other claimed damages. 
B. Procedural Background 
HART filed its Complaint in October 2018 seeking to 
condemn approximately two acres of Victoria Ward’s real property 
within the Ward Village master plan area. Victoria Ward filed 
an Answer and Inverse Condemnation Counterclaim (“Counterclaim”) 
10  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
in order to recover just compensation and severance damages for 
property interests taken or damaged. 
After HART filed its Complaint, HART obtained an Order 
of Possession before final judgment through an expedited 
procedure under HRS § 101-29 (2012). The Order of Possession 
specified that HART was thereby awarded all real property 
interests it sought, as well as the ability to “do such work in the Easements as may be required for the purposes for which 
condemnation of the Easements is sought.” Thus, HART already 
has possession of the properties in question, and this appeal 
solely concerns Victoria Ward’s right to just compensation due 
to HART’s takings. 
In August 2021, HART filed multiple motions for 
partial summary judgment directed at establishing, as a matter of law, that Victoria Ward was precluded from pursuing a variety 
of damages claims. The circuit court granted a significant 
portion of HART’s motions relating to severance damages, thereby 
limiting Victoria Ward’s ability to recover such damages as part 
of its inverse condemnation counterclaim against HART. 
Victoria Ward subsequently moved to file an 
interlocutory appeal of the circuit court orders granting or 
granting in part HART’s MPSJs. The circuit court granted 
Victoria Ward’s motion and also sua sponte allowed HART to appeal any adverse MPSJ orders. The circuit court additionally 
11  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
paused the accrual of “blight of summons” interest during the 
pendency of the interlocutory appeal. 
Victoria Ward filed nine notices of appeal: eight 
regarding summary judgment orders and one regarding the stay of 
“blight of summons” interest accrual. HART filed a single 
notice of appeal regarding five orders: four partial summary 
judgment orders and an order granting in part and denying in part HART’s motion to strike two exhibits. 
HART applied to transfer each interlocutory appeal to 
this court, which granted the application and consolidated the 
appeals. During the transfer application’s pendency, HART moved 
to dismiss all of Victoria Ward’s appeals for lack of subject 
matter jurisdiction. Unless otherwise noted, these motions are 
denied. 
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
“An appellate court reviews the circuit court’s grant 
of summary judgment de novo.” Hawaiian Dredging Constr. Co.,
Inc. v. Fujikawa Assocs., Inc.
, 142 Hawaiʻi 429, 434, 420 P.3d 
360, 365 (2018) (brackets and internal quotation marks 
omitted) (quoting 
Gillan v. Gov’t Emps. Ins. Co.
, 119 Hawai‘i 
109, 114, 194 P.3d 1071, 1076 (2008)). “Summary judgment is 
appropriate ‘if the pleadings, depositions, answers to 
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the 
affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to 
12  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a 
judgment as a matter of law.’” Id.
 (quoting Hawai‘i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (“HRCP”) Rule 56(c) (2000)). 
We view the evidence in the light most favorable to 
the non-movant. Winfrey v. GGP Ala Moana LLC
, 130 Hawai‘ i 262, 
271, 308 P.3d 891, 900 (2013). The movant bears the burden of 
showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that 
it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Kaneohe Bay
Cruises, Inc. v. Hirata, 75 Haw. 250, 258, 861 P.2d 1, 6 (1993). An opposing party may not counter a motion for summary judgment 
merely upon “allegations or denials of the adverse party’s 
pleading,” but instead “must set forth specific facts showing

IV. DISCUSSION 
A. Victoria Ward is Not Precluded from Seeking Severance 
Damages 
The central issue of this appeal concerns whether the 
Master Plan Permit and Victoria Ward’s conduct preclude Victoria 
Ward from collecting severance damages arising from HART’s 
takings — valued by the parties between $65 million and over 
$100 million. 
Victoria Ward claims damages for the loss of 
valuable development opportunities and for allegedly being 
forced to undergo costly modifications and re-designs which 
further reduced the efficiency and value of the Ward Village 
properties. 
We hold that, by entering into the Master Plan Permit 
and Development Agreement, Victoria Ward is obligated to address 
and incorporate rail. But it is the province of the jury to determine the contours of this obligation and to calculate the 
amount of severance damages, if any, to which Victoria Ward is 
entitled. 
The order granting HART’s MPSJ No. 1 is affirmed as to 
paragraphs 1(a), 1(c), 1(d), and 2, but vacated as to paragraph 
1(b). In light of the admissible evidence disputing HART’s 
theory that Victoria Ward is precluded from seeking severance 
damages, the order granting HART’s MPSJ No. 3 is vacated. The 
order granting HART’s MPSJ No. 11 is also vacated. Finally, the 
14  
 
 
  
  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
orders granting HART’s MPSJ No. 2 and Victoria Ward’s MPSJ No. 1 
are affirmed. 
1. There is a genuine dispute of material fact as to 
whether Ordinance 07-001 and the Locally Preferred Alternative “established” the rail route and location 
of the 
Kaka‘ako Station within Ward Village 
One important question is whether the rail route and 
Kaka‘ako Station location were known at the time of the Master 
Plan Submittal, Master Plan Permit, Development Agreement, or 
subsequent individual project applications. HART’s MPSJ No. 1 
concerned the legal effect of Ordinance 07-001, enacted by the 
Honolulu City Council in 2007. Crucially, Ordinance 07-001 
selected a “locally preferred alternative” (LPA) which generally 
defined a rail route and location for the Kaka‘ ako Station.3 The 
LPA was a route chosen out of several viable options provided to 
the City Council by the Honolulu Department of Transportation 
Services. Specifically, Section V of the LPA (labelled “Section 
V — Nimitz Highway/Halekauwila Street/Kapiolani Boulevard”) 
appears to show a route going through Ward Village along 
Halekauwila Street, through the location of the now-planned 
Kakaʻako Station, and finally continuing along Queen Street. 
The circuit court’s order granting in part and denying 
in part HART’s MPSJ No. 1 specified: 
3 In addition to selecting the LPA, Ordinance 07- 001 authorized the 
C&C to prepare an environmental impact statement for the LPA and established 
an excise tax to fund rail construction and operations.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
1. There being no genuine issues of material fact, 
the Motion is GRANTED as follows: 
a. Ordinance 07- 001 is a legally enforceable 
legislative action by the Honolulu City 
Council; 
b. The ordinance approved the locally- preferred 
alternative and established the alignment of 
rail and the Kaka͑ako station within Ward 
Village; and 
c. The [HCDA] as the permitting authority for 
Kaka͑ako, and the Ward Village area, was obligated to consider Ordinance 07- 001 in its 
planning and permitting; 
d. In its 2009 master plan permit for Ward 
Village, the HCDA, pursuant to Ordinance 07-
001, required that as a part of individual 
project development permit applications, the high-capacity transit route and station 
location be addressed and incorporated. 
2. There are genuine issues of material fact such 
that this Motion is DENIED as to Plaintiff’s request for a ruling that the Victoria Ward, Ltd. Defendants 
cannot recover severance damages with regard to the 
Lost Tower (defined in the Motion as the alleged abandonment of the development of a 400-foot tall 
luxury condominium purportedly planned for the Kaka͑ako Station site) or any other project directly 
in conflict with alignment of the rail line and station as defined in Ordinance 07- 001. The Court 
finds that at this point this is an issue that with 
consideration of the other factors must be submitted 
to the jury for its determination. 
(Emphases added.) 
As set forth below, the circuit court was correct that 
Ordinance 07-001 was legally enforceable, HCDA was obligated to 
consider it, the Master Plan Permit required the rail route and 
Kaka‘ako Station to be addressed and incorporated, and Victoria 
Ward was not precluded from recovering severance damages as a 
matter of law. However, the court erred in ruling that 
Ordinance 07-001 and the LPA “established” the rail alignment 
16  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and location of the Kaka‘ako Station within Ward Village as a 
matter of law. Accordingly, the circuit court’s order granting 
HART’s MPSJ No. 1 is affirmed as to paragraphs 1(a), 1(c), 1(d), 
and 2, but vacated as to paragraph 1(b). 
The parties dispute the extent to which the LPA 
“established” the location of the guideway and station, as 
opposed to simply expressing a preference. 
HART asserts that, 
although the rail alignment changed slightly since Ordinance 07-001 was enacted, the Ordinance and LPA made clear — at least two years prior to the grant of the Master Plan Permit in 
2009 — that the rail guideway and Kaka‘ ako Station would be 
constructed within Ward Village in a manner consistent with the 
LPA. Consequently, HART argues that HCDA was under a legal obligation to require any Ward Village structures to 
“accommodate, and not conflict with,” rail as set out in the 
LPA. As a result of HCDA’s alleged obligation to ensure that 
all structures were in accord with the LPA, HART asserts that 
HCDA could not legally approve any projects that conflicted with 
the LPA. Thus, under HART’s theory, Victoria Ward is precluded 
from recovering severance damages for any projects that would 
otherwise conflict with the rail line or Kaka‘ ako Station 
location, as defined by the LPA. 
We disagree with HART’s position. There is a dispute 
of fact as to whether the LPA established definite plans to 
17  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
build the Kaka‘ ako Station within Ward Village, or if the LPA 
instead contemplated a station near, but outside of, Ward 
Village. 
Ordinance 07-001’s text simply states that “[t]he city 
administration is authorized to proceed” with preparing an 
environmental impact statement for the LPA, and with “planning 
and preliminary engineering.” The Ordinance’s text does not 
reflect certainty as to a rail route or station location. At 
oral argument, HART’s attorneys indicated that the Master Plan Permit explicitly references the LPA as the rail route that 
Victoria Ward was obligated to address and incorporate. This is 
not entirely so. The Permit states that “[t]he C&C’s current 
preferred transit route is situated within the Mauka portion of 
the master plan area.” The text did not explicitly require 
Victoria Ward to incorporate the route as reflected in the LPA. 
Rather, the Permit’s use of the word “current” and subsequent 
phrasing, “a more detailed transit route and station location 
shall be addressed and incorporated,” indicate the tentative nature of the LPA and likelihood of future alterations, despite 
the existence of the LPA at the time of entry into the Master 
Plan Permit. 
Consistent with this interpretation, the HCDA Staff 
Findings report prepared in response to the Master Plan 
Submittal similarly states that a preferred route and station 
18  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
location had been identified, “but due to its tentative nature, 
the [Master Plan Submittal] does not identify the preferred 
route or exact station location for the proposed transit 
network,” and that “the C&C’s proposal for the alignment as well 
as [the] transit station within the Master Plan area still 
appears to be tentative and may change.” 
In sum, both parties present substantial evidence in 
support of their positions, and determination of the disputed question of whether Ordinance 07-001 and the LPA “established” 
the rail route must be presented to a jury. Accordingly, we 
affirm the circuit court order granting HART’s MPSJ No. 1 as to 
paragraphs 1(a), 1(c), 1(d) and 2, and vacate as to paragraph 
1(b). 
2. The Master Plan Permit does not preclude Victoria Ward 
from seeking severance damages as a matter of law 
The circuit court ruled that Victoria Ward complied 
with and benefitted from the Master Plan Permit such that 
Victoria Ward cannot recover severance damages arising out of 
its obligation to comply with the terms of the Master Plan 
Permit. The circuit court order granting HART’s MPSJ No. 3 
specifically stated: 
1. The Ward Neighborhood Master Plan, the HCDA’s Findings 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision and Order, and 
the Master Plan Development Agreement for the Ward 
Neighborhood (collectively, the “Master Plan Permit”) 
required all project development permit applications to address and incorporate rail and the Kaka͑ako station in the development of Ward Village. 
19  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
2. Neither General Growth Properties, the Victoria Ward, 
Ltd. Defendants’ predecessor in interest, nor any of the 
Victoria Ward, Ltd. Defendants ever challenged the Master 
Plan Permit. Instead, the Victoria Ward, Ltd. Defendants, 
by signing on to the Development Agreement for the Ward 
Neighborhood, affirmatively accepted and agreed to comply with the terms and conditions of the Master Plan Permit, 
including the requirement to address and incorporate Rail. 
3. Under this very same Development Agreement, the Victoria 
Ward, Ltd. Defendants’ development projects have thrived and derived tremendous profit from the HCDA's approval of 
numerous individual project developments. 
4. The Victoria Ward, Ltd. Defendants have complied with 
the Master Plan Permit requirement to address and incorporate Rail as to individual projects it has developed 
under the Master Plan Permit, in particular: Ke Kilohana, 
A‘ali‘i and Ae‘ o have incorporated design accommodations for 
the rail project. 
5. The Victoria Ward, Ltd. Defendants have also obtained a 
number of variances and modifications from their 
development permits through the HCDA in order to address 
Rail. 
6. Not only has this Master Plan requirement to address and 
incorporate Rail been known to the Victoria Ward, Ltd. 
Defendants from the outset of their development plans, but 
this requirement has been adopted and complied with in the 
planning of all of their projects to date. 
7. After entering the Master Plan Development Agreement 
with HCDA, and benefiting immensely from this agreement, 
and complying with the terms of this agreement for the 
entirety of its development activity in the Ward 
Neighborhood, as a matter of law, the Victoria Ward, Ltd. 
Defendants cannot now recover severance damages based on 
compliance with the terms and conditions of the agreement, 
which the Victoria Ward, Ltd. Defendants were legally 
obligated to do. 
8. The Victoria Ward, Ltd. Defendants are prohibited from 
recovering severance damages on the basis of the burden 
imposed by HCDA pursuant to the Master Plan Permit 
requiring the Victoria Ward, Ltd. Defendants to address and 
incorporate Rail. 
9. This ruling does not affect the Victoria Ward, Ltd. 
Defendants’ constitutional right to recover just 
compensation for the value of the property interests HART 
is taking in this eminent domain action. 
(Emphases added.) 
20  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
a. The meaning of the Master Plan Permit is disputed 
There is a genuine issue of material fact as to the 
meaning of the Master Plan Permit requirement that future rail 
plans be “addressed and incorporated,” and there is a dispute as 
to the contemporaneous intentions of the parties. A factfinder 
should have the opportunity to ascertain the parties’ 
understanding of the phrase “addressed and incorporated” in 
light of the parties’ representations and actions both at the 
time the Master Plan Permit was granted and after the fact. 
Given the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact, the 
circuit court erred in granting the MPSJ, thereby depriving Victoria Ward of the opportunity to have the matter of severance 
damages decided by a jury. 
Victoria Ward maintains that it never relinquished any 
rights to recover compensation, including for severance damages 
arising from the takings, and that no permitting document or 
ordinance mandated such. HART, in contrast, asserts that by 
agreeing to the Master Plan Permit with the provision that a future rail network shall be “addressed and incorporated,” 
Victoria Ward cannot subsequently seek severance damages for 
claimed impacts to Ward Village arising out of HART’s 
acquisitions of property related to rail. 
The record contains evidence indicating that key 
players within the HCDA, Victoria Ward, and HART disputed the 
21  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
meaning and effect of the Master Plan Permit at various times 
throughout the permitting and construction process. 
The HCDA’s decisionmaking authority is vested in the 
HCDA Board of Directors (“HCDA Board”). HRS § 206E-3(b)(3) 
(2014). The declarations of several HCDA Board members, in which 
they set forth their respective understandings of the Master 
Plan Permit, individual permitting procedures, and the HCDA’s general practices around permitting, raise a question of fact as 
to whether the Master Plan Permit required Victoria Ward to 
forgo compensation to which it would otherwise be entitled. 
C. Scott Bradley served on the HCDA Board from 
2006 — 2012, and as the Board Chairperson in 2011. Bradley 
noted that he did not understand the Master Plan Permit to have 
precluded Victoria Ward from collecting severance damages: “[t]he HCDA Board did not condition the master plan permit on 
any condition that Victoria Ward waive or agree to forego 
compensation to which it would otherwise be entitled due to 
construction of the rail project in and around Ward Village.” 
Steven J. Scott served on the HCDA Board from 
2015 — 2016, during which time he reviewed several individual 
Ward Village building projects. Although Scott did not serve on 
the HCDA Board at the time the Master Plan Permit was granted, 
he stated generally, in relation to the question of whether Victoria Ward waived its right to compensation: 
22  
 
 
     
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
I also do not think that HCDA expects or expected Victoria 
Ward . . . or any Howard Hughes company to waive 
compensation or damages owed because of the rail project. 
I do not recall any discussion at any time regarding such a 
waiver. 
 
Based on my experience, if HCDA wanted to impose a condition, like a dedication of land to the rail project, 
it would have stated it specifically and explicitly in the 
permits.   . . .
(Emphasis added.) 
Anthony J.H. Ching, the HCDA Executive Director from 
2008 — 2015, supplied a Disclosure Report to provide both 
factual information and expert opinions, and a Rebuttal Report 
to rebut the Callies Report supplied by Victoria Ward. When deposed, Ching noted that no HCDA permits or applications 
constituted an agreement by Victoria Ward to disclaim its right 
to sue for severance damages:  
Q. Mr. Ching, [the Master Plan Permit] does not say 
anywhere that Victoria Ward would be waiving its damages 
claims in a subsequent eminent domain action, correct? 
   . . . 
A.
 Again, without finding a legal opinion, it does — it 
would not appear so. 
    . . . 
Q.
 [O]ut of all of the documents that you reviewed in 
connection with your either disclosure report or rebuttal report concerning Victoria Ward’s individual plan 
development projects [including the permit applications, 
HCDA staff reports, and HCDA approval documents], none of 
those documents state that Victoria Ward waived or otherwise gave up any damages claims in this eminent domain action or in a future eminent domain action, correct? 
A. To the best of my recollection, yes. 
23  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Victoria Ward also contends that the Master Plan 
Permit was understood to mean that Victoria Ward would simply 
coordinate rail plans with HART and C&C officials. This 
alternative interpretation of the “addressed and incorporated” 
language is supported by Victoria Ward’s representations to HART 
prior to the litigation. For example, in a 2015 letter to HART 
Executive Director Daniel Grabauskas, Victoria Ward stated: “Accordingly, prior to HART seeking to acquire any of the 
Subject Parcels . . . we request for HART to review the 
modifications proposed by our traffic engineering firm and to 
incorporate the modifications to address the previously 
identified impacts.” (Emphases added.) Further, Deepak 
Neupane, the HCDA Executive Director from 2020 - 2022 and 
previous HCDA Director of Planning and Development from 2006 - 2019, clarified that the Master Plan Permit language 
simply meant “that the development will be coordinated with 
transit station locations and the route. . . . [T]he thinking 
was that the C&C and the developer would, you know, coordinate 
each other’s development plan.” 
Finally, neither the Master Plan Permit nor the 
Development Agreement explicitly states that Victoria Ward must 
forgo just compensation in the event of an eminent domain action 
by HART, nor do they explicitly require an exaction or dedication of property by Victoria Ward for a rail project. The 
24  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
absence of any such condition is striking, especially in light 
of the Master Plan Permit’s otherwise explicit conditions. For 
example, the Master Plan Permit includes the requirement that a 
designated park space be “dedicated through a perpetual easement 
for public use gathering areas” and that Victoria Ward allot 
245,638 of square feet for open space. Victoria Ward was also 
never required to make modifications to its Submittal to reflect a rail route and station within Ward Village. 
In contrast to the above evidence supporting Victoria 
Ward’s position that the Master Plan Permit does not preclude it 
from seeking severance damages, HART points to numerous 
statements in the Master Plan Permit Submittal and Development 
Agreement, as well as Victoria Ward’s individual building permit 
applications, to argue that Victoria Ward understood that it would voluntarily — and without additional compensation beyond 
the benefits of the Master Plan Permit — accommodate rail. On 
their face, these statements acknowledge the rail route and 
Kaka‘ako station location, the rail project’s impact on Ward 
Village, and Victoria Ward’s continued obligation to coordinate 
with HART. For example, the June 5, 2013 permit application for 
Ke Kilohana, located on Land Block 5, stated: 
This project will accommodate the Honolulu Rail Transit 
that cuts through a corner of the project site, and will 
address pedestrian flow from the rail transit station 
across Ward Avenue. 
25    . . .  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 The permit application for ‘ A‘ali‘i, on Land Block 
1, stated: This project is adjacent to the planned rapid transit 
guideway. Although the elevated transit rail does not 
necessarily produce more noise than the existing commercial 
activities, it elevates the noise contours higher by 
several floors. A higher platform will again provide 
needed buffer between the adjacent transit rail and the residential floors. 
The HART rail guideway is proposed through the north 
portion of the site, and subsequently 
ʻAʻaliʻi has been 
designed to accommodate the proposed HART guideway and 
required setbacks.  
 . . .  
 
The construction plans and related requirements for 
the HART elevated rail system have been incorporated into  
the Ward [Master Plan] and specifically into the design of 
ʻAʻaliʻi. As required by HART, the elevated guideway with 
three columns, impact the planning and use of ʻ Aʻaliʻi, along  
the mauka boundary and Queen Street frontage. The impact 
to the planning of Land Block 1 has been significant with a 
substantial amount of acreage being isolated or encumbered by HART use.  
 
The benefit of the planned transit station is that 
residents and visitors will have convenient access to rail.  .  .  .   All of the planned residential units within 
Land Block 1 are within a five- minute walk (1/4 mile) . . . 
of the Ward Station.  
  HART also points to the testimony of former HCDA 
Executive Director, Anthony Ching, who concluded: 
The Master Plan Permit’s requirements with respect to 
Rail obligated, and put the burden on, [Victoria Ward] to plan and design individual development projects within the 
Master Plan in a manner that accommodated and incorporated 
Rail. Indeed, the Master Plan provided [Victoria Ward] 
with great flexibility to do so. Conversely, it did not 
allow [Victoria Ward] to accommodate and incorporate Rail into its plans for Ward Village under the Master Plan and 
then, years later, seek damages from HART for doing 
so — that is not how a condition of approval for an 
entitlement works. 
. . . 
26  
 
 
   
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
It is my further opinion that, if [Victoria Ward] had 
advised the Authority on any given project permit 
application that [Victoria Ward] had not accommodated Rail 
or could only accommodate Rail at the cost of millions of 
dollars — which [Victoria Ward] would later seek from 
HART — that the Authority would have either rejected the 
permit application; or forced [Victoria Ward] to re- plan 
and/or redesign the project. 
The above evidence reflects a genuine issue of 
material fact as to the meaning of the Master Plan Permit and 
whether the Permit precluded Victoria Ward from collecting 
severance damages for impacts to non-taken properties. 
Accordingly, a jury should have the opportunity to ascertain the 
parties’ understanding of the Master Plan Permit. 
b. HART has not sufficiently established estoppel by 
acceptance 
In addition to the Master Plan Permit’s ambiguous 
meaning, there is a dispute of material fact as to whether 
Victoria Ward is precluded from seeking severance damages under 
an “estoppel by acceptance” theory. The principle of estoppel 
by acceptance is based in the notion that the acceptance of 
certain benefits may preclude a party from asserting — to 
another party’s disadvantage — a right inconsistent with a 
position previously taken. We hold that there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Victoria Ward adequately 
reserved the right to collect severance damages in exchange for 
the benefits arising from the Master Plan Permit and the 
accommodations of rail. Thus, Victoria Ward is not precluded as 
27  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
a matter of law from seeking severance damages under an estoppel 
by acceptance theory. 
HART is careful to specify that Victoria Ward did not 
waive its right to seek compensation, but that Victoria Ward 
“has no constitutional right to recover damages on the basis of 
having voluntarily complied with the terms of the 2009 Master 
Plan Permit, where [Victoria Ward] has reaped the benefits of doing so for over a decade.” 
HART repeatedly points to Victoria Ward’s 
representations voluntarily welcoming rail and promising to 
“embrace” transit. Noting the multitude of benefits derived 
from the Master Plan Permit — namely the greater building 
flexibility, preferential density allowances resulting from 
transit-oriented development, and the ability to collect billions of dollars in revenues through the sale of units made 
more valuable in part due to their proximity to rail — HART 
contends that Victoria Ward’s severance damages claims are 
barred as a matter of law. Under HART’s theory, Victoria Ward 
should have challenged the Master Plan Permit prior to accepting 
the benefits derived from it. Because Victoria Ward 
affirmatively accepted the benefits of the Permit, its 
subsequent claim for severance damages constitutes an 
inconsistent legal position. 
28  
 
 
      
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
However, Victoria Ward contests the notion that it 
voluntarily agreed to incorporate rail without seeking damages. 
Victoria Ward presents evidence showing that it protested the 
takings and reserved its right to seek compensation consistently 
over the course of a decade. 
In a 2009 letter to the Honolulu Department of 
Transportation Services regarding a draft environmental impact statement, Victoria Ward’s predecessor in interest, GGP, 
outlined a number of potential impacts from rail including the 
loss of parking, loss of buildings, and impacts to future 
development opportunities in Ward Village. The letter proposed 
alternate routes to reduce impacts on Ward Village and 
encourages the parties to work together “with respect to the 
methods of construction, the construction timeline, staging areas, utility relocation and related matters so that the impact 
upon our properties and the business conducted thereon is 
minimized to the greatest extent possible.” The letter to the 
Department of Transportation Services concludes: 
We have not attempted to outline all of the effects that 
the proposed project will or may have upon our properties, 
both current and future uses, such as those envisioned in 
the recently approved Master Plan for the Ward properties. . . . We reserve all of our rights and 
remedies, at law and in equity, in connection with the [HART] project and its effects upon our properties and the 
businesses conducted therein. 
(Emphasis added.) 
29  
 
 
   In a 2014 letter to the former HART Executive Director 
Daniel Grabauskas, Victoria Ward reiterated its intention of 
working with HART to “ensure that the Kakaʻ ako Rail Station and 
the Rail Transit Project are designed in a harmonious manner 
with the Master Plan,” and that: 
 
  In a March 2015 letter to Grabauskas, Victoria Ward 
expressed concern over design plans which would “eliminat[e] several ingress and egress passageways.” The letter proceeded 
to list the impacts on ingress and egress in greater detail, and 
concluded: 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Victoria Ward, Limited, . . . is the owner of several 
parcels, either in fee or as the owner of one hundred 
percent (100%) of the beneficial interest under a recorded 
trust agreement, . . . that have been the subject of 
notices and communications from HART  and its various 
contractors. [Victoria Ward]  understands that HART seeks 
to acquire, through negotiated sale or its condemnation powers, some or all of the Subject Parcels as part of the 
Honolulu Rail Transit Project . . . and further intends to 
place a rail station (the “Kakaʻ ako Rail Station”) on one of 
the Subject Parcels.  
 
As HART is no doubt aware, the Subject Parcels are subject 
to a Master Plan for high- density commercial and 
residential development and redevelopment. [Victoria Ward]  
will seek to be fully compensated for all property acquired or impaired as a result of this sale or condemnation, 
especially to the extent that a condemnation impacts 
[Victoria Ward]’s ability to develop and/or redevelop pursuant to the Master Plan. Independent of that concern, 
[Victoria Ward]  believes that it may be possible for 
[Victoria Ward]  and HART to mutually benefit from the 
cohesive integration of the Kakaʻ ako Rail Station and Rail 
Transit Project into the existing and planned developments pursuant to the Master Plan.  
Please allow this letter to serve as notice to HART that the above mentioned impacts are not acceptable to 
[Victoria 
Ward] and will cause significant damages to [Victoria 
Ward], including, but not limited to, damages related to or resulting from the reduced accessibility to the Subject 
Parcels for [Victoria Ward]’s current and future residents 
30  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
     
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and customers and for customers of [Victoria Ward]’s 
current and future tenants, and damages related to or resulting from HART’s taking of portions of Block M where 
improvements are planned to be located. Accordingly, prior 
to HART seeking to acquire any of the Subject Parcels from 
[Victoria Ward], we request for HART to make alterations 
and modifications to its design of the Rail Transit Project 
to address the above referenced impacts and to respond to 
this letter with such modifications. 
Victoria Ward consistently reserved its right to 
collect damages for impacts to its properties through letters to 
Grabauskas, all in response to various developments in HART’s 
project. In an April 2015 letter, Victoria Ward stated: 
For all these reasons, and as stated in my last 
letter, the above mentioned impacts are not acceptable to 
[Victoria Ward]  because they will cause significant 
problems to the general public traveling to and in Kakaʻ ako 
and to current and future residents in 
Kakaʻako. In 
addition, the impacts will cause significant damages to 
[Victoria Ward], including, but not limited to, damages related to or resulting from the reduced accessibility to 
the Subject Parcels for [Victoria Ward]’s current and 
future residents and customers and for customers of 
[Victoria Ward]’s current and future tenants, and damages 
related to or resulting from HART’s taking of portions of Block M where improvements are planned to be located. 
Accordingly, prior to HART seeking to acquire any of the 
Subject Parcels from [Victoria Ward], or any parcels in 
Kaka᷾ako, we request for HART to review the modifications 
proposed by our traffic engineering firm and to incorporate the modifications to address the previously identified 
impacts.  
(Emphases added.) 
In response to a Letter of Offer from HART to acquire 
portions of Ward Village property in November 2015, Victoria 
Ward contested HART’s estimate of just compensation and noted: 
Victoria Ward is entitled to compensation not only for the 
value of the property that may be taken by HART, but also 
for all damages caused by HART’s taking to the remaining 
property owned by Victoria Ward. . . . [ T]he identified 
“Total Just Compensation” figure does not include, any 
severance or other damages that Victoria Ward will suffer by HART’s taking and by the [HART rail project]. 
31  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In response to a later Letter of Offer from HART, 
Victoria Ward’s attorneys sent a letter in 2018 again 
reasserting Victoria Ward’s right to collect severance damages: 
As you know, Victoria Ward is also entitled to 
compensation not only for the value of the property taken,
but also for all damages caused by HART’s takings to the 
remaining property.   
The above-quoted statements are just a sample 
reflecting Victoria Ward’s consistent opposition to HART’s plans 
and are sufficient to raise a dispute of fact with regard to 
HART’s motion for partial summary judgment premised on an 
estoppel by acceptance theory. 
Because the meaning of the Master Plan Permit is in 
dispute and there is a dispute as to HART’s estoppel by 
acceptance theory, we vacate the order granting HART’s MPSJ No. 
3. 
3. There is a genuine dispute of material fact as to the 
“stairwell claim,” the “screening claim,” and the “setback claim” 
HART’s MPSJ No. 11 sought to preclude Victoria Ward 
from collecting damages in relation to structural modifications 
to buildings in Ward Village. 
In granting HART’s MPSJ No. 11, 
the circuit court stated that the motion was granted “on the same grounds previously stated” in its order granting HART’s 
MPSJ No. 3. In light of our holding vacating HART’s MPSJ No. 3, 
and due to the multitude of factual disputes relating to HART’s 
32  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
MPSJ No. 11, we also vacate the order granting HART’s MPSJ No. 
11. 
Of note, HART’s MPSJ No. 11 specifically related to 
three components of Victoria Ward’s severance damages claims: 
(1) the “stairwell claim,” or the allegation that HART’s actions 
forced Victoria Ward to enclose a stairwell in the Ke Kilohana 
tower resulting in a loss of approximately 10,000 square feet of developable floor area totaling $3 million in lost profits and 
$512,000.00 in direct costs to construct the enclosure itself; 
(2)
 the “screening claim,” in which Victoria Ward alleges that 
HART required it to screen parking structures for the Ke 
Kilohana, ‘A‘ali‘i, and Ae‘ o towers  totaling $382,483.00 in 
damages; and (3) the “setback claim,” which refers to Victoria Ward’s assertion that it was required to push back the Ae
‘o tower 
eighteen feet from Queen Street, as opposed to the ordinary 
fifteen-foot setback requirement, resulting in a loss of 1,181 
square feet of commercial space, totaling $484,000.00 in damages 
from lost development opportunities. 
For all three of these claims, HART argues that 
Victoria Ward failed to establish a causal link between the claimed damages and a demand by HART to make the modifications. 
HART claims that Victoria Ward made the specific modifications 
“for its own design reasons” and that because “[Victoria Ward] 
cannot prove that HART caused any of the alleged damages related 
33  
 
 
  
         
         
 
               
         
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to the Stairwell Claim, the Screening Claim, or the Setback 
Claim,” Victoria Ward failed to satisfy its burden of proof. 
The evidence presented by both parties is in large 
part ambiguous and circumstantial, requiring a factfinder to 
weigh credibility and evaluate many separate pieces of evidence. 
In sum, there is a genuine dispute of material fact that should 
be presented to a jury. 
In the “stairwell claim,” Victoria Ward and HART 
dispute the precise qualities of the stairwell enclosure that HART would have accepted in light of their safety concerns. 
HART asserts that an “open stairwell with mesh, screening, or 
something similar” would have accomplished the safety objectives 
without reducing developable space. HART cites to the 
deposition testimony of In-Tae Lee, an engineering director for HART, who implied that HART’s safety concerns could have been 
allayed through less costly means: 
Q. And HART suggested that that stairwell be enclosed 
instead of open to avoid that safety risk, correct? 
A. I’m not sure of that. I thought it -- as long as it 
prevented objects from being thrown off, that would satisfy 
HART. 
Instead of proving that Victoria Ward was obligated to 
build a solid, fully-encompassing enclosure, HART asserts that Victoria Ward’s evidence instead simply shows that HART 
expressed concern about objects being thrown from the stairs, but that a simpler mesh screen or fence would have sufficed in 
34  
 
 
   
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
both allaying HART’s concerns and preserving Victoria Ward’s 
plans for an exterior staircase that would prevent Victoria Ward 
from having to cut down on developable square footage space. 
Victoria Ward, in contrast, presents the statements of 
numerous architects and other witnesses with personal knowledge 
who attest that HART’s expressed concerns necessitated the 
design of a stairwell enclosure. Thus, the “stairwell claim” involves a disputed issue of material fact. 
As to the “screening claim,” Victoria Ward cites to 
more testimony, declarations, and HART communications 
establishing that parking structures were screened due to HART’s 
concern that objects would be thrown onto the rail guideway. In 
contrast, to support HART’s assertion that the screenings 
contribute to aesthetic or other functional purposes, HART presented evidence that all four sides of the parking structures 
are screened (rather than solely the rail-facing sides). 
Viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to Victoria 
Ward, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the 
impetus giving rise to the screening claim. 
Finally, with regard to the “setback claim,” Victoria 
Ward presented evidence that the additional setback along Queen 
Street was to allow additional room for “HART’s rail guideway 
and 10-foot safety and maintenance buffer, placement of utility 
infrastructure next to the Ae‘ o building, and associated road-
35  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
widening to accommodate HART’s placement of columns in Queen 
Street.” This evidence included communications by both Victoria 
Ward and HART referring to proposed building plans and concerns 
that rail could conflict with construction in Ward Village. 
This evidence is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material 
fact. 
In light of the admissible evidence, the circuit court 
erred in granting HART’s MPSJ No. 11. There is a dispute of fact as to whether the modifications and re-designs were 
undertaken due to requirements imposed by HART, or to satisfy 
Victoria Ward’s extraneous preferences. Accordingly, this court 
vacates the order granting HART’s MPSJ No. 11 and remands for 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
4. The circuit court did not err in granting HART’s MPSJ 
No. 2 or Victoria Ward’s MPSJ No. 1 
The circuit court order granting HART’s MPSJ No. 2 
specified that the Master Plan Permit required Victoria Ward to 
affirmatively accommodate and incorporate rail in the planning 
and design of its Ward Village projects. The order did not 
specify the contours of this obligation, nor did it explicitly 
preserve or deny Victoria Ward’s right to seek severance 
damages. 
In light of the above discussion and holdings, the 
order granting HART’s MPSJ No. 2 is affirmed. Victoria Ward was 
36  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
required to address and incorporate rail, but the nature of this 
obligation is to be determined by a jury. We also affirm the 
order granting Victoria Ward’s MPSJ No. 1, which simply held 
that Victoria Ward did not waive or forfeit its constitutional 
right to just compensation. 
B. The Circuit Court Erred in Granting HART’s MPSJ Nos. 5 and 
9 Relating to the Lost Tower 
Victoria Ward asserts that, in the absence of rail, it 
could have built a sixth tower on Land Block 1 (the “Lost Tower” 
claim). The circuit court ruled that Victoria Ward is 
prohibited from arguing in favor of an award of compensation for 
the loss of a supposed 400-foot luxury Lost Tower, and for the 
relocation of units from the Lost Tower to less valuable or less 
efficient locations around the parking podiums of existing 
buildings within Ward Village (the “podium units” claim). The Lost Tower claim and related podium units claim comprise a 
significant portion of Victoria Ward’s total damages sought. 
In its order granting HART’S MPSJ No. 5, the circuit 
court ruled that “ evidence of [the Lost Tower] would be 
speculative and unduly confusing” to a jury. The circuit court 
also noted that the ruling overlaps with its ruling on HART’s 
MPSJ No. 3 which prohibited Victoria Ward from recovering 
severance damages on the basis of the Master Plan Permit. 
37  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In its order granting HART’S MPSJ No. 9, the circuit 
court ruled that it would prohibit Victoria Ward from seeking 
severance damages for the relocation of “Lost Tower” units to 
less valuable and less efficient “podium units” — or residential 
real estate surrounding parking podiums — largely based on its 
rulings in relation to HART’s MPSJ Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 5. 
The circuit court erred in granting HART’s MPSJ Nos. 5 
and 9. The circuit court’s decisions were based on its conclusion that Victoria Ward’s claim for just compensation 
arising from the inability to develop a sixth tower on Land 
Block 1 would be “overly speculative” and confusing to a jury. 
However, Victoria Ward has presented sufficient evidence to 
withstand summary judgment. Accordingly, we vacate the circuit 
court orders granting HART’s MPSJ Nos. 5 and 9 and remand to the circuit court in order to allow Victoria Ward to present to a 
jury its claims for severance damages relating to the Lost Tower 
and podium units. 
1. The Lost Tower and HART’s MPSJ No. 5 
HART seeks to preclude Victoria Ward from arguing for 
including the “Lost Tower” — a 400-foot luxury condominium tower 
that Victoria Ward purportedly planned to build on the site of 
the Kaka‘ ako Station — in its appraisal of Land Block 1, on the 
grounds that the Lost Tower is too speculative and part of an 
“ex post facto development scheme, admittedly reverse engineered 
38  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
by [Victoria Ward] and its expert witnesses” to increase the 
overall damages figure. 
The Lost Tower claim centers on a dispute over how to 
calculate the “highest and best use” of Land Block 1. Eminent 
domain proceedings are intended to award landowners “an amount 
of just compensation which as nearly as possible approximates 
the value which a free market would attach to the taken property.” City & Cnty. of Honolulu v. Market Place, Ltd., 55 
Haw. 226, 242, 517 P.2d 7, 19 (1973). A standard valuation method in eminent domain cases calculates just compensation as 
the difference between the fair market value of condemned 
property immediately before the taking (i.e., the condition 
unaffected by the taking) and the fair market value of the 
remaining property after the taking. Territory v. Adelmeyer, 45 
Haw. 144, 149, 363 P.2d 979, 983 (1961). The fair market value 
of the property in both the “before” and “after” conditions is 
calculated by estimating the highest and best use, defined as 
the use of property “that will generate the most profit.” 
Highest and Best Use, Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). 
“The highest and best use of a property is the one that is 
physically possible, legally permissible, financially feasible, 
and maximally productive.” Menard Inc. v. Cnty. of Clay, 886 
N.W.2d 804, 811 (Minn. 2016); see also Twp. Of Manalapan v.
Gentile, 231 A.3d 631, 637 (N.J. 2020) (“To constitute the 
39  
 
 
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
‘highest and best use,’ a use must be ‘1) legally permissible, 
2) physically possible, 3) financially feasible, and 
4) maximally productive.’”).  
HART argues that there was never a realistic plan to 
build a sixth tower on Land Block 1, and that the Lost Tower 
claim is “reverse engineered.” Victoria Ward did not submit any 
applications, specific plans, or detailed designs of a 400-foot "Lost Tower" on Land Block 1. Even if a plan existed, HART 
claims, it would not have been legally permissible since it 
would conflict with the construction of the Kaka‘ ako Station and 
thus violate the Master Plan Permit obligation to address and 
incorporate rail. Because the highest and best use of property 
in both the “before” and “after” conditions must be legally 
permissible, and because the Lost Tower conflicts with the 
Master Plan Permit, HART concludes that Victoria Ward must be 
prohibited from seeking severance damages related to the “Lost 
Tower.” 
HART points to the 2008 Master Plan Submittal which 
only depicts a 240-foot tall residential mid-rise/office 
building on the site of the Kakaʻ ako Station, rather than a 400-
foot luxury residential tower. According to the Submittal, a 
majority of buildings surrounding the Lost Tower were planned to 
be residential mid-rise/office structures. Thus, not only did 
Victoria Ward’s sole relevant submission to the HCDA represent a 
40  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
building on Land Block 1 directly contradicting Victoria Ward’s 
description of the Lost Tower, but further, the pattern of 
development surrounding the site of the alleged Lost Tower 
conflicts with Victoria Ward’s alleged Lost Tower plans. 
Victoria Ward responds that, under the Master Plan 
Permit, it had the right to develop Land Block 1 with six 
condominium towers. Consequently, the highest and best use of Land Block 1 in the “before” condition consists of the five 
towers already slated to be built, plus the Lost Tower. Land 
Block 1 is less valuable in the “after” condition, because the 
Kakaʻako Station prevents construction of a sixth tower on Land 
Block 1. 
Victoria Ward notes that the Master Plan Submittal 
reflects a Ward Village building — though not a 400-foot tall 
luxury condominium tower — precisely on the spot where the 
Kaka
ʻako Station is now planned to be built. This preliminary 
plan indicates that Victoria Ward had planned to build some structure on the site of the 
Kaka‘ako Station. 
Victoria Ward presents additional evidence in favor of 
its Lost Tower claim. 
First, Howard Hughes’s then-Senior Vice 
President of Development, Race Randle, submitted sworn 
declarations stating that the highest and best use of the land 
without HART’s taking would be to construct a residential tower: 
41  
 
 
          
         
           
           
         
  
 
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
If Victoria Ward was not prevented from developing the 
planned tower at the Kakaʻako Station location and guideway 
because 
of HART’s taking [o]f this land, in its highest and 
best use it would be constructed as a “luxury” or “upper” 
tier condominium tower, similar to Aeʻ o, ʻAʻaliʻi, Koʻula, and 
Anaha towers. 
In another declaration, Randle asserted that the Lost 
Tower “could have been the same height as Aeʻ o and ʻAʻaliʻi or up 
to approximately 400 feet.” Randle separately testified that 
Land Block 1 is uniquely valuable because it rests in “the heart 
of the neighborhood,” surrounded by amenities. 
Victoria Ward also points to testimony from experts on 
both sides of this case stating that the highest and best use of 
the land without the taking would be to build a sixth tower on Land Block 1, and that the Lost Tower could exist but for the 
Kakaʻako Station.  Two of Victoria Ward’s expert appraisers 
concluded that the before condition entails six towers on Land 
Block 1. Even HART’s expert appraiser recognized that, in the 
“before” condition without rail, Victoria Ward could have built 
six towers on Land Block 1: 
Q.  [  ]  I’m  talking  before  condition  without  rail,  okay,  the  
without- rail  scenario.   Do  you  have  six  towers  on  Land  
Block  1?  
 
. . .  
 
A.  [  ]  If  you’re  asking  me  in  the  before  condition  was  
there  potential  to  build  six  towers  on  Land  Block  1  in  the  
before  condition,  the  answer  is  yes.   
 
Q.  [  ]  Okay.   And  does  your  before  condition  assume  that?  
 
A.  My  before  condition  assumes  that  the  developer  would  do  
what  [Victoria  Ward]  .  .  .  has  done  from  the  beginning,  
which  was  to  continue  to  scope  the  —  the  market,  adjust,  
42  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and  react  to  the  market  and  the  regulatory  environment  as  
they  moved  forward.   
 
. . .   
 Q.  Well,  do  you  have  a  before  condition  that  has  six  towers  
on  Land  Block  1  or  not?  
 . . .  
 
A.  I  have  a  before  condition  that  has  a  certain  amount  of  
square  footage  —  buildable  square  footage  available  on  Land  
Block  1,  recognizing  that  there  was  an  opportunity  to  have  
used  that  square  footage  in  a  variety  of  ways,  including  
six  towers,  if  desired
.  
 
(Emphasis added.) 
Another HART expert submitted a report reflecting 
scenarios with six towers on Land Block 1 without rail and 
confirmed the physical feasibility of this scenario as the 
“before” condition. Although the experts disagree as to the 
precise value of damages owed to Victoria Ward as a result, 
Victoria Ward correctly states that “[t]his is a classic battle 
of the experts for the jury to consider.” 
The circuit court agreed with HART and granted its 
motion for partial summary judgment. In its order, the circuit court specifically noted that Victoria Ward lacked any design 
plans or permits for the purported Lost Tower: 
3. Given the stakes, that the Victoria Ward, Ltd. 
Defendants are saying that the taking was of this parcel of 
land where they intended to build such a tower, it would 
seem that the first thing the Victoria Ward, Ltd. 
Defendants would have provided to the Court would have been 
plans, drawings, at least conceptual design, as to what 
type of development this would have been. The Victoria
Ward, Ltd. Defendants never took any material steps in the 
development of this alleged lost tower. Based on Race Randle’s [HRCP Rule] 30(b)(6) deposition testimony, it 
appears that the Victoria Ward, Ltd. Defendants believed 
43  
 
 
  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
such efforts would be futile in light of the Master Plan 
requirement to address and incorporate rail. As such, it would appear that the so- called “lost tower” was in fact a 
tower that never existed. 
(Emphasis added.) 
We review the circuit court’s order granting partial 
summary judgment de novo, contrary to HART’s suggestion that 
this appeal consists of an evidentiary matter that should be 
reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. 
a. There is a genuine dispute of fact as to whether 
Victoria Ward presents a reasonable argument for 
a probable future use 
A property’s highest and best use is often 
hypothetical, because even prospective uses of a property may 
affect its value on the open market. Thus, a party may — within 
certain limits — offer a proposed or hypothetical development 
plan to demonstrate the likelihood of market demand for the 
property and, accordingly, its value. Market Place, 55 Haw. at 
243, 517 P.2d at 19 — 20 (“[O]nce a reasonable argument is made 
for a probable use, . . . competent evidence tending to show the 
value of that use should be admitted.” (quotation, citation, and 
ellipsis omitted)); Adelmeyer, 45 Haw. at 147—48, 363 P.2d at 
982. 
This calculation method, and specifically the process 
of deriving a value for the hypothetical “before” condition, may involve some speculation and a “clash of rival experts.” 
Adelmeyer, 45 Haw. at 163, 363 P.2d at 989. This court has 
44  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
clarified that the highest and best use need not be “‘the use at 
the time of taking’” or even “‘the zoning at the time of 
taking[.]’” State v. Pioneer Mill Co., Ltd., 64 Haw. 168, 178, 
637 P.2d 1131, 1138 (1981) (quoting State v. Midkiff, 55 Haw. 190, 193, 516 P.2d 1250, 1253 (1973)). Rather, a condemnee like 
Victoria Ward is permitted to “advance any reasonable argument 
for a probable future use” when calculating just compensation for a taking. Id. at 178, 637 P.2d at 1138 — 39 (emphasis 
added); see Nichols, Eminent Domain, § 18.05[3] (“The owner may introduce evidence of the highest and best prospective use even 
though such owner has no plans to sell the property or utilize 
it for that use. The prospective use will not be admissible, 
however, if the asserted use 
. . . depends on a [zoning] variance which legally cannot be 
granted.”). 
In Adelmeyer, we set a relatively low threshold before 
a landowner can present evidence of a putative highest and best 
use to a jury: “[a]ny competent evidence of matters, not merely 
speculative, which would be considered by a prospective vendor 
or purchaser or which tend to enhance or depreciate the value of 
the property taken is admissible. . . . The only question, then, is one of competence of the witnesses and their 
testimony.” 45 Haw. at 147—48, 363 P.2d at 982 (emphasis 
added) (citation omitted). If there is then a conflict “as to 
45  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the highest and best use of the property, the question is 
properly one left to the jury.” State v. Dillingham Corp., 60 
Haw. 393, 408, 591 P.2d 1049, 1058 (1979) (quoting Alabama Power Co. v. Hamilton, 342 So.2d 8 (Ala. 1977). Thus, the proffered 
uses that should be excluded from jury consideration are those 
that are illegal, illogical, physically or financially 
unfeasible, or otherwise so remote or improbable as to not figure materially in the considerations of the hypothetical 
willing buyer and seller. 
Adelmeyer, Market Place, and subsequent cases 
establish that a use asserted by a condemnee may be presented to 
a jury even if the asserted use is hypothetical and disputed. 
Contrary to the circuit court’s reasoning, the existence of 
development plans is not a necessary condition, and the relevant question for the circuit court was whether a sixth tower on Land 
Block 1 was reasonably probable such that a hypothetical willing 
buyer would consider it when negotiating the sale of the 
property. See Market Place, 55 Haw. at 242—43, 517 P.2d at 19— 
20. In fact, concrete development plans are often irrelevant to 
establishing market value, since the inquiry into the highest 
and best use considers all feasible uses. Rather, the highest 
and best use may be established through expert testimony and 
studies regarding the feasibility of prospective future uses.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Taking the evidence, as set forth above, in the light 
most favorable to Victoria Ward, there is a genuine dispute of 
material fact as to whether Victoria Ward presented a 
“reasonable argument for a probable future use[.]” Pioneer
Mill, 64 Haw. at 178, 637 P.2d at 1139. Thus, the circuit court erred in depriving Victoria Ward of an opportunity to present 
this fact-intensive question to a jury. 
b. HART cannot limit damages to the difference in 
value of two “after” conditions 
It is critical in eminent domain disputes that courts 
accurately conceptualize the “before” condition without the 
government taking. This court has clarified that condemnors may 
not force condemnees to compare two “after” conditions: 
A major goal of the valuation process in eminent domain 
proceedings is to determine market conditions for the taken 
property as though no condemnation had ever been 
contemplated. . . . [ T]he condemnor may not bootstrap 
itself to a lower value for taken property by showing that 
the very act of taking itself and the preparations 
therefor[e] adversely affected market conditions, thereby 
lowering fair market value or eliminating a reasonably 
probable use. 
Market Place, 55 Haw. at 246—47, 517 P.2d at 22 (emphasis 
added) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). 
Hawai‘i caselaw g
oes to great lengths to clarify that 
property in the before condition must be completely detached 
from the government taking. See id.
 By presupposing that 
Victoria Ward could never build the “Lost Tower” pursuant to the 
47  
 
 
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Master Plan Permit, HART obscures the distinction between the 
before and after conditions. 
HART claims that both parties agree that the highest 
and best use of the property is to implement the Master Plan 
Permit. And because the Master Plan Permit contains the 
requirement to incorporate rail, HART concludes that the before 
condition cannot omit the inclusion of the rail guideway and 
Kaka‘ako Station.  However, this leads us back to a critical 
dispute of fact — the meaning of the Master Plan Permit. 
This dispute over Victoria Ward’s right, or lack 
thereof, to build the Lost Tower is one that depends in part on 
determining the significance of the Master Plan Permit’s 
provision that a future rail network would be “addressed and 
incorporated.” It is possible that a jury would find that the 
Permit definitively caused any Lost Tower plans to be legally 
impermissible. In other words, Victoria Ward was on notice that 
it could not develop Land Block 1 with six condominium towers. 
In that case, Victoria Ward would not be able to recover damages related to the Lost Tower, as the building would be a legal 
impossibility. However, it would be erroneous for the court to 
compare two after conditions (i.e., two conditions with rail) 
and Victoria Ward’s failure to produce detailed plans or 
renderings of a “Lost Tower” is not itself dispositive or a 
sufficient basis on which to grant partial summary judgment. 
48  
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the order 
granting HART’s MPSJ No. 5. 
2. Relocation to Podium Units 
Victoria Ward alleges that because it was prevented 
from building the Lost Tower, it was subsequently forced to 
relocate approximately 285,000 square feet of residential floor 
area from the Lost Tower to less efficient and less valuable 
parking podiums on Land Block 1 and Land Block 5.4 
HART contends that Victoria Ward was motivated to 
build mixed residential-parking podiums for reasons entirely 
separate from re-locating residential units from the alleged Lost Tower. Specifically, HART claims that Victoria Ward built 
the mixed-use podiums “to create a more active, inviting 
streetscape that is more pedestrian-oriented and aesthetically 
pleasing, and to respond to demonstrated market demand for such 
units — reasons that have nothing to do with Rail or any Lost 
4 Here, “parking podiums” refer to mixed- use structures that 
integrate parking, residential, and commercial units. Specifically, parking 
podiums are lined by commercial and/or residential units facing outward to 
the surrounding streets and which hide the parking structure. Podiums are 
typically shorter in height than towers, and podium roofs often house 
amenities like pools and recreational space. 
In the context of floor area, “efficiency” is a function of converting 
gross square footage to “saleable net square footage.” Victoria Ward’s 
appraiser concludes that towers are more than 70% efficient in generating net 
saleable area, compared to the 55-6 5% efficiency of podiums. Race Randle, 
Howard Hughes’s former Senior Vice President of Development, clarified that 
podiums are less efficient because, among other reasons, hallways serve homes 
on a single side of the hallway (i.e., units facing outward to the street) 
whereas tower hallways constitute “shared gross floor area” serving units on 
each side of the hallway. 
49

Tower.” HART also argues that Victoria Ward’s mixed-use concept 
for the parking podiums had existed from the initiation of the 
development of Ward Village, and that the use of podiums for 
housing was reflected in both the Master Plan Permit and 
Honolulu’s Complete Streets policy which encourages the 
development of accessible, multi-modal, and habitable streets 
that enhance community interaction, sustainability, and safety. 
Citing a lack of causal effect between HART planning 
the Kakaʻ ako Station on Land Block 1 and Victoria Ward building 
mixed residential-parking podiums, HART claims that the rail 
project had no impact on Victoria Ward’s decision to place 
residential units in the parking podiums of ‘ A‘ali‘i, Ko‘ula, and 
The Park, and that Victoria Ward’s decision was instead 
motivated by design and community planning reasons. 
HART points to numerous statements in the record in 
which several of Victoria Ward’s experts suggested that podiums 
may have been built for aesthetic and multi-functional purposes 
beyond simply housing units from the Lost Tower. HART also 
refers to Victoria Ward’s permit applications in which Victoria 
Ward refers to the potential of parking podiums to “move parking uses up and away from the street, thereby improving the street 
environment” and “provide additional open space, and create 
street-level retail space that will enhance the walkability of 
the neighborhood.” HART further presents statements by Victoria

Ward executives lauding the aesthetics of parking podiums 
relative to bare parking structures. 
Although HART presents evidence of alternative motives 
driving Victoria Ward’s decision to build residential units 
within parking podiums, Victoria Ward introduced sufficient 
evidence to create a factual dispute as to whether the rail 
project was the cause. 
Victoria Ward was not required to build residential 
units in podiums. Further, Race Randle’s testimony indicates that Victoria Ward built podium units to house residential units 
that could no longer be built on Land Block 1. Randle stated in 
a deposition: 
Q. [I]f [Victoria Ward] could have built all of that 7.6 
million square feet of residential [floor area] by adding a 
tower at the Kaka[ ‘]ako Station and guideway location 
without using podium residential [floor area], that’s how 
it would have proceeded; is that correct? 
A. That would have been our preference, yes. 
In response to a question by HART asking whether 
Victoria Ward had “lost the ability to transfer the ‘lost’ floor area off Land Block 1 and construct it on another, comparable parcel,” Randle responded: “[Victoria Ward] does not believe 
there is a comparable parcel.” (Emphasis omitted.) Randle 
further stated in a deposition that “[r]esidential development 
in the podiums is less efficient and less valuable, or less 
desirable . . . than residential space in the tower,” and that, 
51  
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
when compared to towers, “the cost per net square foot is much 
higher, because [podiums are] a lower efficiency product.” 
One of Victoria Ward’s expert appraisers, Michael 
Waldron, stated during his deposition: 
[Q:]  Did  you  reach  an  opinion  that  absent  the  project  
[Victoria  Ward]  would  have  built  zero  residential  units  in  
podiums  [within  Land  Block  1?]  
 
. . .  
 
[Waldron:]  Yes,  that  is  my  opinion.   Conceptually,  in  the  highest  
and  best  use  in  the  before  condition. 
 Contrary to HART’s assertion that the evidence here is 
“undisputed,” there is a clear dispute as to causality: Victoria 
Ward asserts that, in the “after” condition with rail, it had to 
re-locate units to parking podiums. HART counters that Victoria 
Ward cannot prove that the impetus for locating residential 
units within podiums was the loss of area on Land Block 1 for a 
supposed sixth tower. Drawing all reasonable inferences in 
favor of Victoria Ward, it has presented sufficient evidence to 
raise a question of fact as to whether it was forced to relocate 
units from the Lost Tower to less valuable podiums. This 
question should be presented to a jury, and we accordingly vacate the order granting HART’s MPSJ No. 9. 
3. Motion to strike J. Douglas Ing’s Declaration 
HART cross-appealed a circuit court order denying 
HART’s motion to strike J. Douglas Ing’s declaration. 
The 
declaration was submitted by Victoria Ward in its opposition to 
52  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HART’s MPSJ No. 9. This court lacks jurisdiction to review 
HART’s cross-appeal. 
As Victoria Ward points out, the circuit court’s order 
granting leave for the parties to file interlocutory appeals 
specified that (1) parties could appeal “the orders granting the 
Motions for Partial Summary Judgment,” and (2) HART could cross-
appeal “any of the adverse rulings on the Motions for Partial Summary Judgment,” which were “the orders granting the Victoria 
Ward Defendants’ Motions for Partial Summary Judgment Nos. 1, 2, 
3, and 4.” 
“We cannot disregard a jurisdictional defect in an 
appeal and are required to dismiss an appeal on our own motion 
when we conclude that we lack jurisdiction.” Wylly v. First
Hawaiian Bank, 57 Haw. 61, 62, 549 P.2d 477, 479 (1976) (per 
curiam). We therefore dismiss on our own motion HART’s cross-
appeal of the circuit court’s denial of its motion to strike. C. Victoria Ward Can Only Use the Replacement Cost or Cost to 
Cure Valuation Method if it Does Not Exceed the Diminution in Value from Lost Parking 
Victoria Ward seeks compensation for the cost of 
building a new parking structure to house parking spots that 
might be lost due to the rail construction, and to satisfy the 
increased parking demand from the presence of the rail station 
in Ward Village. Victoria Ward’s parking expert estimated that 
several hundred on-street and off-street parking spaces would be 
53  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
lost in the area surrounding the Kakaʻako Station, with a 
“reasonable probability of adverse effects and substantial 
impairment on the remaining parking supplies in the area.” 
In its MPSJ No. 7, HART sought to prevent Victoria 
Ward from pursuing its lost parking claim. 
Unlike some of the 
other summary judgment motions on appeal, the order granting HART’s MPSJ No. 7 did not outright prohibit Victoria Ward from 
seeking severance damages. Instead, the circuit court simply 
narrowed the breadth of available valuation methods, which is within the court’s authority in eminent domain cases. 
Victoria Ward’s preference would be to value its 
damages at the “replacement cost.” This valuation method is 
also referred to in this appeal as the “cost to cure.” Under 
this approach, Victoria Ward would be entitled to damages equal 
to the cost of ameliorating the effects of the taking (i.e., the 
cost of building replacement parking spots). 
In contrast, HART convinced the circuit court to 
impose a traditionally used methodology for calculating damages in partial takings cases like this one. The circuit court ruled 
that Victoria Ward’s damages may be valued at the replacement 
cost (or cost to cure) only if that value is less than the 
diminution in fair market value of the property between the 
“before” condition (no loss of parking) and the “after” 
condition. Thus, Victoria Ward may still recover the 
54  
 
 
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
replacement cost associated with parking, but only after making 
the requisite showing. 
The circuit court’s analysis was correct. In partial 
takings cases, if the cost to restore the untaken property to a 
pre-taking condition exceeds the difference in property value 
between the before and after conditions, then the condemnee is 
entitled only to the difference in value. See Territory v.
Honolulu Plantation Co., 34 Haw. 859, 867 (Haw. Terr. 1939). 
This methodology ensures that courts balance the goal of making 
landowners whole for a taking with the practicality of ensuring 
that a condemnee does not receive an undue windfall as a result 
of a taking. See City & Cnty. of Honolulu v. Bonded Inv. Co.,
Ltd., 54 Haw. 385, 394, 507 P.2d 1084, 1091 (1973) (“To award [the] condemnee less than the value of the property taken would be unjust to him; to award him more than its value would be 
unjust to the public.”) (parentheses omitted) (quoting Garrow v. 
United States, 131 F.2d 724, 726 (5th Cir. 1942)). This 
methodology also enforces condemnees’ duty to mitigate damages. 
We have previously restricted just compensation as the 
circuit court did here. See City & Cnty. of Honolulu v.
Collins, 42 Haw. 199, 217 (Haw. Terr. 1957) (“Just compensation includes all elements of value that inhere in the property, but 
it does not exceed market value fairly determined.”). While it is the province of the jury to assess damages, it is the 
55  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
province of the court to guide the jury as it does so. See
Silva v. Souza, 14 Haw. 46, 48 (Haw. Terr. 1902) (“It is the 
province of the jury to assess the damages according to the rule 
of law, which it is the province of the court to lay down for 
their guidance.”) (Emphasis added.) 
Evidence of the cost to cure “is admissible only when 
the cost to cure is no greater than the diminution in value of the remainder if the condition is left uncured.” 4A Nichols, 
Eminent Domain, § 14A.04[2][a]. The order did not absolutely 
preclude Victoria Ward’s favored valuation methodology — it only 
imposed a precondition on its use. That condition was intended 
to achieve a guiding purpose of eminent domain law: to ensure 
that landowners are “put in as good [a] position pecuniarily as 
[they] would have occupied if [their] property had not been taken.” United States v. Miller, 317 U.S. 369, 373 (1943). 
Here, the circuit court, in an effort to balance the need to make Victoria Ward whole with the risk of an undue windfall, 
applied a limiting principle restricting Victoria Ward’s favored 
methodology to instances in which its use would not result in 
unwarranted gain contrary to the guiding principles of eminent 
domain law. 
Victoria Ward’s claims for severance damages 
concerning lost parking presents a triable factual issue, and the circuit court explicitly preserved Victoria Ward’s right to 
56  
 
 
   
  
 
   
 
     
 
   
                             
 
 
        
 
       *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
seek such severance damages. The circuit court acted within its 
authority in imposing a precondition on Victoria Ward’s 
preferred methodology because this action was consistent with 
the applicable legal principles.. 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit 
court’s order granting HART’s MPSJ No. 7. As for Victoria 
Ward’s request to be given an opportunity to prepare another appraisal in response to this holding, Victoria Ward should 
direct this request to the circuit court on remand. D. Victoria Ward Can Collect Severance Damages for Alleged 
Damages to Land Block 3 
The order granting HART’s MPSJ No. 10 precluded 
Victoria Ward from seeking severance damages related to Land 
Block 3. This issue centers on the effect of the following 
phrase, found in parties’ 2020 Joint Stipulation : “[b]oth parties will appraise Land Block 3 as a distinct larger parcel.”
5 
5 The 7/23/2020 Joint Stipulation states, in relevant part: 
4. Exception as specifically provided below, the Parties 
will conduct their appraisals based on the following: 
. . . 
c. Victoria Ward contends that a compensable taking 
and/or compensable damages have occurred from Land Block 3; 
Plaintiff disputes that contention (as described in more 
detail in paragraph 5 below). 
. . . 
5. The parties do not agree about whether there is a 
compensable taking and/or compensable damages on Land Block 3. 
Both Parties will appraise Land Block 3 as a distinct larger 
parcel, including analyzing severance damages if any, and special 
benefits if any, subject to the following: 
a. Plaintiff reserves all arguments that there is no 
compensable taking and/or damages to Land Block 3 and/or that 
Victoria Ward is not otherwise entitled to compensation related 
57  
 
 
  
 
 
 
         
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The parties agree that HART’s partial physical taking extends to 
Land Blocks 1 and 5. 
Victoria Ward’s severance damages claims concerning 
Land Block 3 include parking loss, ingress and egress loss 
resulting from the loss of a left turn, and ten years of 
construction and noise. Because it is undisputed that HART did 
not execute any physical takings on Land Block 3, Victoria Ward’s just compensation claim as to Land Block 3 only concerns 
severance damages. 
HART argues that Victoria Ward cannot recover 
severance damages for impacts to Land Block 3, because (1) no 
physical takings were executed on Land Block 3 and (2) Land 
Block 3 is a distinct parcel to be appraised separately from the 
rest of Ward Village. In other words, Land Block 3 was not “taken or damaged,” because all the physical takings took place 
elsewhere, and any real-world impacts to the property are 
discounted because the parties stipulated that Land Block 3 is 
to be appraised as a distinct parcel. HART is careful not to 
to Land Block 3. Victoria Ward reserves all arguments to the 
contrary. 
b. If Plaintiff successfully establishes that Victoria 
Ward is entitled to compensation for Land Block 3 (or that the amount of compensable damages should be reduced), Plaintiff 
cannot offset any special benefits allegedly accruing on Land 
Block 3 against damages to other Land Blocks, including Land Block 1 or Land Block 5. 
(Emphases added.) 
58  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
characterize the Joint Stipulation as a waiver. Rather, HART 
emphasizes that there has been “no legally cognizable taking or 
compensable damaging as to Land Block 3.” 
The circuit court ruled in large part that because 
Land Block 3 constitutes a distinct larger parcel, and because 
HART did not take any property from Land Block 3, Victoria Ward 
could not recover “severance damages or under inverse condemnation” for damages related to Land Block 3. The circuit 
court relied both on a plain reading of the Joint Stipulation 
and the parties’ subsequent conduct — specifically, Victoria 
Ward’s statements in support of one of its motions for partial 
summary judgment. 
We vacate the order granting HART’s MPSJ No. 10. The 
circuit court erred in placing undue emphasis on an ambiguous phrase of the Joint Stipulation and misapplied Victoria Ward’s 
statements made in a separate context. 
In a partial taking, where the state condemns only a 
portion of the entire property, the state must pay the fair 
market value of taken property and severance damages for damage 
to the remainder. The right of property owners to recover 
severance damages for impacts to property is set forth in the 
state constitution and HRS §101-23.  Haw. Const. art. I, § 20 
(“Private property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation.” (emphasis added)); HRS § 101-23

(1990) (“[D]amages which will accrue to the portion not sought 
to be condemned by reason of its severance from the portion 
sought to be condemned, . . . shall also be assessed.”). 
The People of Hawai‘ i added the phrase “or damaged” to 
the Hawai
‘i Constitution in 1968 following the construction of 
the H-1 freeway to provide remedies for property owners whose property lost value or usefulness although no physical taking 
was executed. The Framers of the 1968 Constitution considered 
such effects as they relate to highway construction in adding 
the “or damaged” provision to the constitution. See 2 
Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of Hawai‘ i of 1968, 
at 27-31. 
Shortly after the 1968 constitutional amendment was 
adopted, this court emphasized the importance of severance 
damages, stating: 
It was not until a constitutional amendment in 1968 that 
the words “or damaged” were included in [Article I § 18 of 
the Hawaiʻ i Constitution].[6] 
. . . 
Prior to the [1968] amendment [adding the “or damaged” 
clause], only the owner of physically “taken” property was 
entitled to compensation in Hawaiʻ i, and those whose 
property was merely consequentially “damaged” by the 
primary taking were without recourse. . . . The chief 
purpose in adding the “or damaged” clause to the 
Constitution was to remedy this situation.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Although the Joint Stipulation states that Land Block 
3 constitutes a distinct larger parcel, and despite the fact 
that HART is not taking portions of Land Block 3, property 
owners are entitled to severance damages for impacts to non-
taken properties. Neither the Joint Stipulation’s text nor the 
parties’ subsequent conduct supports the circuit court’s 
conclusion that there was no genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Victoria Ward can recover severance damages related 
to Land Block 3. 
a. The Joint Stipulation’s text 
The circuit court indicated that the “distinct larger 
parcel” phrase was a significant factor in its decisionmaking. However, the Joint Stipulation text is ambiguous, and the 
accompanying text cuts in favor of Victoria Ward. 
The Stipulation language immediately following the 
“distinct larger parcel” phrase states, “[b]oth Parties will 
appraise Land Block 3 as a distinct larger parcel, including 
analyzing severance damages if any, and special benefits if any, subject to the following.” Both parties agree in the 
Stipulation that there were no physical takings within Land 
Block 3. This leaves open solely the possibility that Victoria 
Ward could recover severance damages on Land Block 3. It makes 
little sense (1) for the parties to agree that no takings took 
place on Land Block 3, (2) for the parties to intend to sever 
61  
 
 
         
        
        
 
          
        
    
 
         
          
         
           
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Land Block 3 from Ward Village in a manner that would preclude 
the collection of severance damages, and (3) for Victoria Ward 
to explicitly reserve the right to seek damages related to Land 
Block 3. In fact, the Joint Stipulation’s accompanying text 
would be rendered meaningless and absurd if its language were 
read to constitute a surrender of severance damages, only to 
then immediately refer to the appraisal of severance damages and offsetting special benefits. 
The accompanying Joint Stipulation language does not 
constitute an explicit disavowal, but rather seems to have the 
opposite intention: 
Victoria Ward contends that a compensable taking and/or 
compensable damages have occurred from Land Block 3; 
Plaintiff disputes that contention . . . . 
The Parties do not agree about whether there is a 
compensable taking and/or compensable damages on Land Block 
3. . . . 
[HART] reserves all arguments that there is no compensable taking and/or damages to Land Block 3 and/or that Victoria 
Ward is not otherwise entitled to compensation related to 
Land Block 3. Victoria Ward reserves all arguments to the 
contrary
. 
(Emphases added.) 
In light of the quoted passages, which preserve 
Victoria Ward’s ability to exercise its constitutional right to 
seek just compensation for impacts to Land Block 3, it was erroneous for the circuit court to treat one short and 
contradictory phrase in the Stipulation as dispositive of this 
question. 
62  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
b. The parties’ subsequent actions 
Stipulations bind the parties thereto, and courts use 
contract law principles to review them. See Provident Funding
Assocs., L.P. v. Gardner
, 149 Hawaiʻi 288, 297, 488 P.3d 1267, 
1276 (2021). “[I]n the face of an ambiguity, ‘the court’s 
objective is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the parties as manifested by the contract in its entirety.’” 
Id.
 at 
298, 488 P.3d at 1277 (emphasis and brackets omitted) (quoting 
Hawaiian Ass’n of Seventh-Day Adventists v. Wong
, 130 Hawai‘i 36, 
45, 305 P.3d 452, 461 (2013). Here, there are both textual 
ambiguities, noted above, and a genuine dispute as to the 
parties’ intentions and understandings of the Joint Stipulation. 
The circuit court correctly sought to interpret the 
“distinct larger parcel” language by reviewing the parties’ 
conduct. 
To do this, the court looked to Victoria Ward’s 
arguments in favor of Victoria Ward’s MPSJ No. 3 (“Victoria 
Ward]’s MPSJ No. 3”). Victoria Ward’s MPSJ No. 3 concerned special benefits, or beneficial impacts from a taking that can 
be used to offset severance damages. Victoria Ward’s MPSJ No. 3 
is not to be confused with HART’s MPSJ No. 3, which precluded 
Victoria Ward from seeking severance damages. 
In the memorandum in support of Victoria Ward’s MPSJ 
No. 3, Victoria Ward stated that “all claims as to Land Block 
3 — including severance damages and offsetting special benefits 
63  
 
 
            
       
         
        
        
        
           
         
        
           
           
         
       
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
-must be assessed separate and apart from all other claims 
related to any other land blocks of Ward Village.” (Internal 
quotation omitted.) Subsequently, in the order granting HART’S 
MPSJ No. 10, the circuit court cited this language as revealing 
Victoria Ward’s intentions and understanding of the Stipulation: 
When the Court refers to how the parties have treated the 
stipulation, the Victoria Ward, Ltd. Defendants’ argument 
in support of their Third Motion for Partial Summary 
Judgment: to Enforce the Parties’ 7/23/20 Joint Stipulation 
[Dkt. 1710], which dealt with special benefits, included 
the statement that “because the parties have stipulated 
that Land Block 3 is a separate larger parcel, all claims 
as to Land Block 3 including severance damages and 
offsetting special benefits must be assessed separate and 
apart from all other claims related to any land blocks in 
Ward Village.” Thus, the Court is looking at the wording of 
the stipulation and how the parties, including the Victoria 
Ward, Ltd. Defendants, have interpreted the stipulation. 
It was erroneous for the circuit court to rely so 
heavily on Victoria Ward’s statement in support of Victoria 
Ward’s MPSJ No. 3 to interpret the Joint Stipulation language at 
issue in HART’s MPSJ No. 10. The issues central to HART’S MPSJ 
No. 10 and Victoria Ward’s MPSJ No. 3 are different. Victoria 
Ward’s MPSJ No. 3 concerned whether future development rights 
could qualify as a special benefit. Paragraph 6 of the Joint 
Stipulation contains clear language indicating that future development rights do not count as a special benefit in relation 
to Land Block 3. Furthermore, HART’S MPSJ No. 10 and Victoria 
Ward’s MPSJ No. 3 concern different provisions of the Joint 
Stipulation. Victoria Ward’s statements in support of Victoria 
Ward’s MPSJ No. 3 do not clearly reflect a position in relation 
64  
 
 
  
        
           
        
        
         
        
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to HART’S MPSJ No. 10. HART’S MPSJ No. 10 concerns the 
application of Paragraph 5 of the Joint Stipulation. The 
statements made by Victoria Ward in favor of Victoria Ward’s 
MPSJ No. 3 have minimal value toward interpreting Paragraph 5 of 
the Joint Stipulation, because there is an explicit provision 
applicable to the dispute in Victoria Ward’s MPSJ No. 3 (i.e., 
whether special benefits to Land Block 3 could offset damages on other land blocks): 
If Plaintiff successfully establishes that Victoria Ward is 
not entitled to compensation for Land Block 3 (or that the 
amount of compensable damages should be reduced), Plaintiff 
cannot offset any special benefits allegedly accruing on 
Land Block 3 against damages to other Land Blocks, 
including Land Block 1 or Land Block 5. 
The Joint Stipulation language is silent on damages, 
but clear and specific to the question at the heart of Victoria 
Ward’s MPSJ No. 3: whether HART could apply special benefits from Land Block 3 (where there was no physical taking) to offset 
damages arising from takings on Land Blocks 1 and 5. The issue 
in Victoria Ward’s MPSJ No. 3 contrasts with the dispute in this 
appeal, where Victoria Ward seeks to preserve its right to seek 
severance damages to Land Block 3 from Land Blocks 1 and 5. The 
Joint Stipulation is not clear with regard to the latter issue. 
Accordingly, the circuit court erred in (1) relying on 
the Stipulation’s ambiguous text; then (2) buttressing its 
interpretation of the text by reference to Victoria Ward’s subsequent pleadings, which were specific to a separate question 
65  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that was addressed explicitly by a different passage of the 
Stipulation. 
c. The circuit court should review the factual 
questions on remand 
Rather than relying on an ambiguous phrase or Victoria 
Ward’s actions in relation to a separate provision of the Joint 
Stipulation, the circuit court should, on remand, allow a jury 
to determine whether Land Block 3 and the affected parcels of land are sufficiently united via application of the “three 
unities” test. See Cnty. of Kaua‘ i v. Hanalei River Holdings 
Ltd., 139 Hawaiʻ i 511, 520-23, 394 P.3d 741, 750-53 (2017). 
Hawaiʻi law is clear that a landowner does not 
necessarily need to have suffered a physical taking in order to 
claim severance damages to a parcel of land. Haw. Const. art. 
I, § 20; Market Place, 55 Haw. at 230—31, 517 P.2d at 12—13. 
Under the three unities test, a landowner like Victoria Ward may recover for damages to separate and independent tracts of land, 
like Land Block 3, provided that the landowner establishes the 
following factors shared between the condemned and remaining 
parcels of land: (1) unity of title, (2) physical unity, and 
(3) unity of use.

is dispositive of a condemnee’s claim for severance damages, and

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the Joint Stipulation designating Land Block 3 as a “distinct” 
or physically separate parcel does not preclude Victoria Ward 
from collecting severance damages on Land Block 3. 
The aforementioned analysis requires a factfinder to 
evaluate and weigh many separate pieces of evidence. 
Accordingly, this question is properly reserved for a jury. For 
the foregoing reasons, we vacate the order granting HART’s MPSJ No. 10 and remand for trial. 
E. Victoria Ward’s Damages May Be Offset by Special Benefits 
from the Transit-Oriented Development Overlay Plan 
Victoria Ward disputes HART’s ability to offset just 
compensation by the total sum of benefits arising out of the 
Kakaʻako Community Development District Transit-Oriented 
Development (“TOD”) Overlay Plan. 
The HCDA completed an initial draft of the TOD Overlay 
Plan in 2013 with the intent of fostering urbanized development 
and greater residential density in proximity to public transit. 
The TOD Overlay Plan final draft was published in 2016, and it 
highlights numerous forms of incentive-based zoning in which portions of Ward Village received a more generous maximum floor 
area ratio (“FAR”) compared to pre-existing standards in the 
Master Plan Permit in the absence of the TOD Overlay Plan. FAR 
refers to the ratio of a building’s gross floor area to the size 
of the piece of land on which it is built. Maximum-allowable 
67  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
FAR may be capped through zoning regulations, with lower maximum 
FAR values being associated with reduced allowable residential 
density. 
Most importantly for this appeal, the final draft TOD 
Overlay Plan specifies a maximum allowable FAR much greater than 
that allowed under the Master Plan Permit. This increase in FAR 
is a significant benefit to Victoria Ward, with HART alleging that the density increase would allow Victoria Ward to build 
millions of additional square feet of floor area. A final TOD 
Overlay Plan has not yet been adopted by the legislature despite 
HCDA support, and HART largely blames Victoria Ward for the 
delay. 
In support of its position, HART highlights 
representations anticipating a “density increase triggered by mass transit” in the Master Plan Submittal. HART also points to 
communications by Victoria Ward executives implying that they 
intentionally left portions of Ward Village underdeveloped in 
order to later exploit more generous development rules after the 
Master Plan Permit expires in 2024, but that these plans were 
scrapped due to the availability of greater development 
flexibility and affordances provided by the TOD Overlay Plan. 
Specifically, Victoria Ward appears to have anticipated the 
potential for eleven new towers totaling millions of additional square feet as a result of future TOD benefits. HART’s 
68  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
appraiser estimated that the potential future buildable floor 
area as a result of the TOD Overlay Plan would add a total $30 
million in value to Ward Village. HART seeks to treat this 
increase in value as a “special benefit” that can be used to 
offset total just compensation. 
The circuit court granted Victoria Ward’s MPSJ No. 2, 
reasoning that the question of special benefits arising from the TOD Overlay Plan was too speculative and would lead to jury 
confusion. We review the circuit court’s summary judgment 
decision de novo. See Gump v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
, 93 Hawaiʻi 
417, 420, 5 P.3d 407, 410 (2000). 
State v. Midkiff
 involved a similar special benefits 
claim. 55 Haw. at 194-97, 516 P.2d at 1254-56. There, the jury 
heard expert testimony claiming that the remaining parcels would 
“probably be rezoned to a higher industrial use[,]” based on 
their “irregular shape . . . and the unsuitability of the 
[remaining parcels] for any other use due to their position on 
the freeway.” Id. at 194, 516 P.2d at 1253 (emphasis added). 
This court upheld the condemnee’s right to present their 
probabilistic argument to a jury in a partial takings case. Id.
at 193, 516 P.2d at 1253 (”Since reasonable possibility of rezoning is a valid consideration in determining the market 
value of land actually taken, we see no reason why the same rule 
should not apply to establishing the market value of remnant 
69  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
parcels and thus the enhancement value attributable to the 
taking.”). Thus, the applicable standard here, where HART 
asserts the existence of future special offsetting benefits in a 
partial taking case, is a “reasonable probability” test. See
id. (“The state has urged that when a partial taking enhances the remainder lands by creating a reasonable probability of 
rezoning to a higher use, the remnant parcels may be specifically benefited by the taking. We agree.” (emphasis 
added)). This standard is consistent with that applied supra in 
the discussion of the Lost Tower and speculative damages. 
Once a “reasonable argument is made for . . . a 
probable use,” evidence relating to offsetting special benefits 
should be considered by a jury. Market Place, 55 Haw. at 243, 
517 P.2d at 19-20; see State v. Martin, 54 Haw. 167, 170, 504 
P.2d 1223, 1226 (Haw. 1973) (“This court has taken the position 
that in a condemnation case such as this one, ‘any evidence 
which will aid the jury in fixing the fair market value of the 
property should be considered by them.’”). 
As set forth below, there is sufficient evidence to 
establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the TOD 
Overlay Plan is reasonably probable. 
HART correctly notes that the Honolulu Department of 
Planning and Permitting has completed eight different TOD plans 
spanning 19 rail station areas outside of Kaka‘ako.  Further, the 
70  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
TOD Overlay Plan relevant to this appeal has the support of key 
stakeholders like HCDA. 
HART also points to the testimony of Anthony Ching, 
the HCDA Executive Director from 2008—2015, who attested that 
“[a] TOD Station Planning Area for Kaka᷾ako has already been 
identified, and substantial work has already been done toward 
the creation and adoption of the TOD Overlay Plan.” Additionally, a “final draft” TOD Overlay Plan already exists. 
On the other side of this dispute, Victoria Ward and 
its experts note the speculative nature of the TOD Overlay Plan 
and question the notion that Victoria Ward would be willing and 
able to build additional structures on Ward Village. 
The question of whether a future use or benefit is 
reasonably probable is a fact-intensive inquiry. A jury should discern whether the TOD Overlay Plan was reasonably probable, 
and if so, the likely value of any special benefits to Victoria 
Ward arising from the TOD Overlay Plan. 
Finally, HART is correct in asserting that the TOD 
Overlay Plan is a special offsetting benefit, as opposed to a 
general benefit. See City & Cnty. of Honolulu v. Collins, 42 
Haw. 199, 213 (Haw. Terr. 1957) (“[A] general benefit cannot be considered as an offset to the value of the owner’s property in 
condemnation. Only a special and direct benefit may be offset against value of property taken.”). 
71  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The TOD Overlay Plan has a “reasonable probability” of 
affording Victoria Ward specific upzoning opportunities that are 
peculiar to Victoria Ward’s relationship to the neighborhood as 
a developer of residential units in the vicinity of the Kakaʻ ako 
Station. Specifically, the TOD Overlay Plan, if enacted, would 
function similarly to a rezoning. 
Here, the TOD Overlay Plan would increase residential 
density, allowing Victoria Ward to expand Ward Village and sell 
a greater number of units. This opportunity for greater residential density is akin to upzoning, in that it constitutes 
an allowance for a denser or higher-value use. HART’s appraisal 
expert included the TOD Overlay Plan in his appraisal report for 
Ward Village, stating, “I concluded that there is a reasonable 
probability of a TOD plan of some kind to be adopted and, more 
specifically, a reasonable probability — frankly, a near 
certainty — that the potential for a TOD plan would have 
impacted the value of the remainder property in the after 
condition[.]” (Emphasis omitted). Because the TOD Overlay Plan results in an outcome similar to rezoning, the existence of a 
reasonable probability of a future TOD Overlay Plan could 
legitimately be used by a jury to offset Victoria Ward’s claimed 
damages. 
Victoria Ward characterizes the benefits as “general 
benefits” because they will be “shared among multiple landowners 
72  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
near the City Center [Kaka‘ ako] Station.”  However, this court 
has clarified that special benefits do not become relegated to 
general benefits merely because other properties may be 
benefitted. See Territory by Sylva v. Mendonca, 46 Haw. 83, 95-
96, 375 P.2d 6, 13 (1962) (“[S]pecial benefits resulting from the fact that land abuts on a proposed road do not become 
general benefits merely because other properties which also 
front on the road and receive these same benefits have not been 
required to contribute to the road in property” (emphasis added)). 
Because of the specific qualities associated with the 
benefits arising out of the TOD Overlay Plan, they are to be 
treated as special benefits for the purposes of offsetting any 
of Victoria Ward’s damages. 
Accordingly, we vacate the order granting Victoria 
Ward’s MPSJ No. 2. 
F. HART May Not Offset Victoria Ward’s Just Compensation by 
the Total Value of Special Benefits to Land Block 3 
In a related appeal, HART contests the circuit court 
order granting Victoria Ward’s MPSJ No. 3, which precludes HART 
from treating potential increases in density on Land Block 3 as 
special offsetting benefits to reduce the overall just 
compensation owed to Vicotria Ward. This dispute concerns both

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the same July 23, 2020 Joint Stipulation from Section IV(D) and 
the same TOD Overlay Plan from Section IV(E). 
In appraising Land Block 3, HART’s expert appraiser 
applied $15 million of “special benefits” arising on Land Block 
3 to offset damages arising on other blocks of land. The $15 
million of special benefits were related to increased 
development density allowable under the TOD Overlay Plan. The dispute here is whether these potential increases in density 
from the TOD Overlay can be treated as a special offsetting 
benefit, or if the July 23, 2020 Joint Stipulation language 
limits appraisers from only considering special benefits 
existent at the time of the 2009 Master Plan Permit. 
On appeal, Victoria Ward contests the HART appraiser’s 
treatment of future TOD-related benefits as a special offsetting benefit because the Joint Stipulation stated: 
6. In evaluating the Land Blocks defined in the Master 
Plan, the Parties will use the following assumptions: 
c. As of the valuation date, Land Block 3 is fully 
built out to its highest and best use (i.e., the 
amount of FAR utilized as of the date of value is the final FAR allocation for Land block 3), both in the 
before and the after condition, and that any 
remaining FAR associated with Land Block 3 will be 
deemed transferred off Land Block 3.”
[7]    . . . 
7 The Stipulation’s statement that Land Block 3 is built out to its 
highest and best use in both the before and after conditions does not 
necessarily preclude Victoria Ward’s severance damages claims on Land Block 3. This is the case because the Joint Stipulation is specific to “the amount 
of FAR utilized” whereas Victoria Ward’s severance damages claims for Land Block 3 concern loss of parking, loss of ingress and egress, and construction 
and noise. Because the Stipulation is specific to FAR, and because Victoria 
74  
 
 
  
 
           
           
          
         
          
           
           
        
           
 
 
          
         
         
         
       
         
           
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(Emphases added.) 
Victoria Ward argues the Joint Stipulation means that 
future development potential under the TOD Overlay Plan could 
not be counted as a special benefit, and that valuation of Land 
Block 3 must only account for special benefits existent at the 
time of the 2009 Master Plan Permit.  
The circuit court’s order granting Victoria Ward’s 
MPSJ No. 3 is brief, largely reiterating the Joint Stipulation language: 
1. As stated in paragraph 6 of the Joint Stipulation filed 
July 23, 2020, in evaluating the land blocks defined in the 
master plan, the parties will use the assumptions set forth 
in paragraph 6 of the Joint Stipulation, including the 
assumption set forth in paragraph 6(c) that, as of the 
valuation date, Land Block 3 is fully built out to its 
highest and best use, both in the before and the after 
condition, and any remaining floor area (“FAR”) associated with Land Block 3 will be deemed transferred off Land Block 
3. 
2. Although the Court does not understand there to be any 
dispute on this point, at the Victoria Ward Defendants’ (also referred to as Howard Hughes’) request, the Court 
also reaffirms paragraphs 5 and 5(b) of the Joint 
Stipulation, specifically that Plaintiff cannot offset any 
special benefits allegedly accruing on Land Block 3 against 
damages to any other land block, including Land Block 1 or 
Land Block 5. 
3. In granting summary judgment, the Court is reaffirming 
the language in the Joint Stipulation, which says what it 
says. 
Ward’s damages claims relating to Land Block 3 do not concern the loss of developable floor area, the Stipulation does not preclude Victoria Ward’s 
severance damages claims for Land Block 3. 
However, because the special offsetting benefits to Land Block 3 relate 
to the TOD Overlay Plan, and because the Joint Stipulation states that FAR in the before and after conditions are the same, this discussion concludes that 
HART may not use future increased density on Land Block 3 to offset Victoria 
Ward’s compensable damages. 
75  
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(Emphases added.) 
The parties dispute the meaning of not only the Joint 
Stipulation, but also the circuit court order granting Victoria 
Ward’s MPSJ No. 3. The order does not explicitly state that it precludes HART from arguing in favor of $15 million of special 
benefits arising from future development on Land Block 3 
pursuant to the TOD Overlay Plan, though Victoria Ward argues in 
favor of such a reading in this appeal. 
We affirm the circuit court’s order granting Victoria 
Ward’s MPSJ No. 3. The Joint Stipulation’s text is clear that 
“the amount of FAR utilized as of the date of value is the finalFAR allocation for Land Block 3.” (Emphases added.) This 
language indicates that HART is precluded from treating 
potential increases in density from the operation of the TOD 
Overlay Plan on Land Block 3 — which were non-actualized at the 
time of valuation — as special offsetting benefits. 
The Joint Stipulation clearly limits the parties: they 
must treat Land Block 3 as “fully built out to its highest and 
best use . . . both in the before and the after condition.” The 
terms “utilized” and “final” in the Joint Stipulation are particularly meaningful, and they indicate an agreement between 
the parties that for appraisal purposes, the parties were to 
assume that no further development would take place on Land 
Block 3. This interpretation is consistent with the surrounding 
76  
 
 
              
       
         
          
          
          
        
         
       
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
phrasing: “Land Block 3 is fully built out to its highest and 
best use.” Unrealized, tentative increases in development are 
not to be considered by appraisers. 
HART repeatedly suggests that Victoria Ward is flip-
flopping on issues related to Land Block 3. The circuit court 
even used Victoria Ward’s arguments in favor of Victoria Ward’s 
MPSJ No. 3 to help form its ruling against Victoria Ward in the order granting HART’S MPSJ No. 10 (at issue in SCAP-22-340): 
When the Court refers to how the parties have treated the 
stipulation, the Victoria Ward, Ltd. Defendants’ argument 
in support of their Third Motion for Partial Summary 
Judgment . . . included the statement that “because the 
parties have stipulated that Land Block 3 is a separate 
larger parcel, all claims as to Land Block 3 including 
severance damages and offsetting special benefits must be assessed separate and apart from all other claims related 
to any land blocks in Ward Village.” 
Again, the issues in HART’S MPSJ No. 10 are distinct 
from those in Victoria Ward’s MPSJ No. 3, and it therefore 
follows that Victoria Ward’s arguments regarding the latter do 
not necessarily reflect their position regarding the former. 
HART’S MPSJ No. 10 focused on the effect of Paragraph 5 of the 
Joint Stipulation, in which the parties agreed that Land Block 3 
is a “distinct larger parcel” for the purposes of analyzing 
severance damages or special benefits. But the operative section in Victoria Ward’s MPSJ No. 3 is Paragraph 6 — a 
provision that explicitly applies to the dispute at hand. 
Further, with regard to any arguments Victoria Ward made in 
77  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
support of treating Land Block 3 as a distinct parcel in its 
memorandum in support of Victoria Ward’s MPSJ No. 3, those 
arguments are not applicable to HART’S MPSJ No. 10 because the 
Joint Stipulation clearly explains how the parties should treat 
special benefits: “Plaintiff cannot offset any special benefits 
allegedly accruing on Land Block 3 against damages to other Land 
Blocks.” 
The Joint Stipulation language is silent on damages, 
but clear and specific to the question of applying special benefits from Land Block 3 (where no physical taking was 
executed) to Land Blocks 1 and 5 (where takings were executed). 
Because of the stark differences between HART’S MPSJ No. 10 and 
Victoria Ward’s MPSJ No. 3, Victoria Ward’s statements in 
support of Victoria Ward’s MPSJ No. 3 are not necessarily contradictory with its position against HART’S MPSJ No. 10. 
Finally, a stipulation binds parties unless there is a 
reason to set it aside. Gardner
, 149 Hawaiʻi at 300, 488 P.3d at 
1279. We discern no reason to set aside the Joint Stipulation here. 
See Tax Appeal of Subway Real Estate Corp. v. Director of
Taxation, State of Haw.
, 110 Hawai‘i 25, 38, 129 P.3d 528, 541 
(2006) (”[S]tipulations may be set aside in order to prevent 
manifest injustice.” (quotation omitted)). The Stipulation is 
clear, affecting the rights of the parties in a manner that is 
enforceable and consistent with sound public policy. See

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Provident Funding Assocs., 149 Hawaiʻ i at 296, 488 P.3d at 1275 
(“[A]ll such stipulations not unreasonable, not against good 
morals or sound public policy, have been and will be 
enforced[.]”) (quoting Okuhara v. Broida, 51 Haw. 253, 256—57, 
456 P.2d 228, 230—31 (1969)). There is no reason to set aside 
the Joint Stipulation here. 
Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court order 
granting Victoria Ward’s MPSJ No. 3. The Joint Stipulation 
prohibits HART from applying, on Land Block 3, the purported special benefits arising from the TOD Overlay Plan. 
G. HART Established a Genuine Dispute of Material Fact as to 
the Special Benefits Associated with Utility Grounding 
HART sought to offset just compensation owed to 
Victoria Ward by $2.7 million on the basis of HART’s 
undergrounding of electrical utilities along Halekauwila Street 
and Queen Street adjacent to Land Block 1 and Land Block 5. 
HART argues that this undergrounding work constituted a special 
offsetting benefit to Victoria Ward. HART clarifies that the 
special benefit to Victoria Ward was “direct cost savings” as opposed to aesthetic, safety, or efficiency benefits, which are 
more broadly shared with other landowners in the area and the 
general public. 
The key questions here are whether (1) Victoria Ward 
would have completed the work of undergrounding utilities at its 
79  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
own expense but for HART’s completion of the work and (2) the 
undergrounding work constitutes a general benefit or special 
benefit. 
The circuit court ruled that HART was required to 
underground the electrical utilities “for its own benefit and 
not the benefit of any of the surrounding landowners, . . . 
[t]he rail project cannot be constructed without this utility modification.” Second, the circuit court ruled that any 
downstream benefits were deemed “general benefits” that cannot 
offset Victoria Ward’s right to just compensation. 
HART should not be allowed to offset total just 
compensation owed to Victoria Ward by $2.7 million for 
undergrounding work that HART would have completed anyway. 
However, given the genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Victoria Ward or HART would have had to complete the 
undergrounding work, we vacate the order granting Victoria 
Ward’s MPSJ No. 4 and remand for trial. 
HART argues that Victoria Ward was required to bear 
the cost of the undergrounding work as part of the 2005 Mauka 
Rules and based on Victoria Ward’s representations to HCDA. 
This point is disputed. HART relies on the fact that the 2005 
Mauka Rules required undergrounding of utilities. However, the 
Mauka Rules do not specify which entity should bear the cost. See HAR § 15-22-76 (repealed 2011) (“Public utility companies 
80  
 
 
          
         
       
           
      
 shall place utility lines underground within the mauka area.”). 
Further, the Master Plan Permit contained no provision 
specifying that Victoria Ward would be responsible for 
undergrounding utilities. 
Victoria Ward’s individual building permit 
applications also are ambiguous and do not favor one party over 
the other. Building permit applications refer to “new underground utility lines” and state that “[a]ll utilities will 
be underground,” without specifying who would be responsible for 
the construction work. 
HART argues that the Master Plan Submittal implies 
that Victoria Ward or its predecessor in interest, GGP, would 
complete the undergrounding work. The Master Plan Submittal 
states: 
While no major additions to the utility infrastructure in 
the area are required for development of Ward Neighborhood, 
planned undergrounding of the electrical utilities will 
help create a community that is safer and more pleasing to 
the eye for residents and visitors. 
 
It 
is recommended that all overhead utilities be placed 
underground within the development boundaries. 
The  Master  Plan  is  guided  by  clearly  articulated  design  
standards.  .  .  .   These  standards  include:   
Undergrounding 
of utilities to remove visual 
clutter[.] 
(Emphasis added.)    . . . 
 
         
     
 
 
  . . . 
 
 
 
     
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
81  
 
 
   The references to underground utilities in the 
building permit applications and the Master Plan Submittal do 
not definitively place the burden of undergrounding on either 
party. Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of HART, the 
evidence is sufficient to establish a genuine dispute of 
material fact. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
As previously noted, a significant question in partial 
takings involving benefits to the remaining land is whether the benefits are “general benefits” or “special benefits.” 
Here, 
the record does not establish whether cost savings from the undergrounding work constitutes a general or special benefit. 
It is unclear whether other property owners elsewhere along the 
HART rail route were required to pay for the construction work. 
Similarly, there is a dispute as to the extent and types of benefits from undergrounding. HART argues that the benefits of 
undergrounding extend specifically to Ward Village, whereas 
Victoria Ward cites to an appraiser’s statement specifying that 
HART’s undergrounding work was conducted on utility lines “along 
public streets involv[ing] property owned by others, not just 
Victoria Ward.” 
HART argues that the benefit is “direct cost savings,” 
rather than aesthetic, safety, or efficiency benefits. In 
contrast, Victoria Ward asserts that the “aesthetic, safety, and efficiency benefits from the undergrounding” are enjoyed by all 
82  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
landowners in the area. The circuit court agreed with Victoria 
Ward, ruling that “[i]f there are benefits from HART’s 
undergrounding of the utilities . . . this is not peculiar or 
special to Ward Village. All landowners in the area enjoy 
aesthetic, safety, and efficiency benefits from the 
undergrounding. As such, as a matter of law, these benefits are 
general and not specific.” 
The circuit court erred in granting summary judgment 
on that issue. There are disputes of fact that must be resolved by a jury to determine whether undergrounding the utilities 
constitutes a general benefit or a special benefit in this 
specific context. For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the 
order granting Victoria Ward’s MPSJ No. 4. H. This Court Lacks Jurisdiction to Review Appeals of the 
Circuit Court Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part 
HART’s Motion to Strike 
In addition to appealing four partial summary judgment 
orders, HART appeals a circuit court order granting in part and 
denying in part HART’s motion to strike the declarations of former HCDA Board members Steven J. Scott and Brian Lee. The 
circuit court denied HART’s Motion to Strike in full as it 
relates to Scott’s declaration, and granted it in part as to 
paragraphs 14 and 16 of Lee’s declaration. 
HART moved to dismiss these interlocutory appeals for 
lack of jurisdiction because these appeals, they argue, do not

satisfy HRS § 641-1(b)’s requirement that interlocutory appeals 
from the circuit court’s civil docket be “advisable for the 
speedy termination of litigation[.]” HRS § 641-1 (2004). 
We may grant a dismissal motion “on any or all 
appropriate grounds disclosed by any or all the papers of record 
in the case.” Waterhouse, 44 Haw. at 238, 353 P.2d at 1011 
(quotation omitted). 
This court lacks jurisdiction to review the circuit 
court’s order granting in part and denying in part HART’s Motion 
to Strike. The circuit court’s order granting leave to file 
interlocutory appeals only provided that HART could “cross-
appeal . . . any of the adverse rulings on the Motions for 
Partial Summary Judgment[,]” clarifying in a footnote that 
“[t]he adverse rulings on the Motions for Partial Summary Judgment as to HART are the orders granting the Victoria Ward 
Defendants’ Motions for Partial Summary Judgment Nos. 1, 2, 3, 
and 4[.]” (Emphasis added.) We accordingly dismiss HART’s 
appeal. I. The Circuit Court Did Not Err in Pausing the Accrual of 
Blight of Summons Interest During the Length of This Appeal 
Victoria Ward appeals the circuit court’s order 
pausing the accrual of blight of summons interest during the 
pendency of the interlocutory appeals. We review the circuit

court decision to stay the accrual of interest for abuse of

Under Hawaiʻi law, a condemnor who uses the HRS § 101

29 “quick-take” procedure is required to estimate the amount of 
just compensation and damages and deposit that sum with the 
court. HRS §§ 101-25, -32, -33 (2012). If the jury awards the 
condemnee an amount greater than the deposit, the condemnee is 
also awarded interest on the difference, as accrued from the 
date of the taking. Id.; Hanalei River Holdings Ltd., 139 
Hawaiʻi at 523-24, 394 P.3d at 753-54 (2017).  This interest is 
referred to as blight of summons damages, and blight of summons 
damages constitute an element of a landowner’s constitutional 
right to just compensation. See Pioneer Mill, 64 Haw. at 184, 
637 P.2d at 1142. 
In addition to compensating condemnees, an award of 
blight of summons damages incentivizes condemnors to avoid delay 
and to more accurately estimate just compensation to be 
deposited with the court, so as to reduce the award of blight of 
summons damages. See Market Place, Ltd., 55 Haw. at 239—40, 517 
P.2d at 18; Mt. San Jacinto Cmty. Coll. Dist. v. Super. Ct., 151 
P.3d 1166, 1172 (Cal. 2007). 
Here, HART estimated Victoria Ward’s total just 
compensation at $13.67 million, and deposited that amount with 
the clerk of court. The question on appeal concerns the circuit 
85  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
court’s order to pause accrual of interest on that value over 
the duration of the interlocutory appeals — a request made by 
HART. 
We hold that the circuit court properly exercised its 
discretion to pause the accrual of statutory interest for the 
duration of the appeals. Just compensation requires a balancing 
between the landowner’s interest and the public’s interest in reducing costs associated with takings. See Bonded Inv. Co.,
Ltd., 54 Haw. at 394, 507 P.2d at 1091 (noting that to award condemnees “less than the value of the property taken would be 
unjust to [them]; to award [them] more than its value would be 
unjust to the public.” (quotation omitted)). 
Victoria Ward argues that the interlocutory appeals 
were requested by both parties in order to accelerate the ultimate termination of the litigation, thereby diminishing the 
equitable basis for pausing interest in HART’s favor. Victoria 
Ward is correct that HART appealed several circuit court orders, 
but the delay was initially triggered by Victoria Ward’s request 
for leave to file an interlocutory appeal, which HART opposed 
both in the circuit court and on appeal. Out of ten appeals and 
one cross-appeal before this court, nine were brought by 
Victoria Ward. HART opposed Victoria Ward’s request for an 
interlocutory appeal, arguing that an interlocutory appeal would not result in speedy termination of litigation because “an 
86  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
interlocutory appeal . . . is likely to result in the case 
‘oscillating between the original and appellate courts,’ 
including future appeals of other orders, resulting in further 
delay and needless waste of time, money, and judicial 
resources.” HART filed motions to dismiss every single one of 
Victoria Ward’s interlocutory appeals, and even notes that it 
filed its singular appeal “only to preserve its rights” and that HART would not have otherwise filed an interlocutory appeal. 
The circuit court chose to disallow the accrual of 
statutory interest for the period of the interlocutory appeals, 
the overwhelming majority of which were initiated by Victoria 
Ward and opposed by HART. Seeing no abuse of discretion, we 
affirm the circuit court’s order. 
V. CONCLUSION 
To summarize, we affirm the circuit court orders 
granting HART’s MPSJ Nos. 2 and 7, and the orders granting 
Victoria Ward’s MPSJ Nos. 1 and 3. We affirm the order granting 
HART’s MPSJ No. 1 as to paragraphs 1(a), 1(c), 1(d), and 2 but 
vacate with regard to paragraph 1(b). We also affirm the order 
pausing the accrual of blight of summons damages during the 
length of this interlocutory appeal. 
We vacate the orders granting HART’s MPSJ Nos. 3, 5, 
9, 10, and 11, and the orders granting Victoria Ward’s MPSJ Nos. 2 and 4.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
We dismiss HART’s cross-appeal regarding the circuit 
court order denying HART’s motion to strike the declaration of J. Douglas Ing and dismiss HART’s appeal of the court order 
granting in part and denying in part HART’s motion to strike the 
declarations of Brian Lee and Steven J. Scott. 
While we appreciate the circuit court’s efforts to 
narrow the issues for trial, genuine issues of material fact were raised, precluding summary judgment in the instances noted 
above. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion.
