 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
N.A. (Lender). After the mortgages entered default, the 
mortgaged properties were foreclosed upon and sold in 
nonjudicial foreclosure sales. Borrowers then sued Lender for wrongful foreclosure, alleging that Lender’s foreclosures did 
not comply with Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 667-5 
(2008) (since repealed). The circuit court granted summary 
judgment to Lender. For the reasons set forth below, we hold that outstanding debt may not be counted as damages in wrongful 
foreclosure cases. Because the circuit court correctly 
concluded that Borrowers did not prove the damages element of 
their wrongful foreclosure claims, it properly granted summary 
judgment to Lender. Accordingly, we affirm. 
I. BACKGROUND 
A. Factual Background 
According to Borrowers, “the parties do not 
substantially dispute the amounts expended by [Borrowers] on 
their properties.” In April 2019, Borrowers sued Lender for 
wrongfully foreclosing upon their properties. Borrowers also 
sued the subsequent purchasers of the properties and others for 
title and possession, but those claims are not before the Court 
on appeal. 
1. The Llanes property 
In February 2008, Ronnie and Sharon Llanes (Llanes) 
obtained a mortgage loan for $505,800.00 from Countrywide Bank, 
2  
 
 
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
FSB (Countrywide), which would merge with Lender in 2009, that 
included a provision allowing Countrywide to conduct a 
nonjudicial foreclosure sale in case of default. 
That same month, Llanes paid $562,067.00
 to purchase a 
property in Kailua-Kona, Hawai‘i. They financed the purchase 
with (1) the $
505,800.00 Countrywide loan, secured by the Llanes 
property, and (2) at least $56,200.00 in personal funds. They also paid $11,799.04 in closing costs. After closing, they 
spent at least $17,000.00 to improve their property, paid 
$26,169.51 in mortgage interest, and paid $3,500.00 for property 
taxes and insurance. Llanes claimed that they invested a total 
of $620,535.55 in the property. 
In December 2008, Llanes defaulted on their loan. 
Before defaulting, Llanes paid down the principal of the original loan by $4,623.48. The following year, Llanes modified 
their loan with a new payment schedule that increased their 
principal balance owed from $501,176.52 to $525,254.63, before 
defaulting on the modified loan. 
In May 2010, Lender’s nominee assigned the Llanes 
mortgage to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (BAC), a subsidiary 
that would merge with Lender in 2011. That same month, BAC 
notified Llanes of its intent to foreclose under the power of 
3  
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
sale included in their mortgage, which stated that an 
acceleration notice following a breach of the agreement  
shall specify: (a)  the default; (b)  the action required to 
cure the default; (c)  a date, not less than 30 days from 
the date the notice is given to Borrower, by which the 
default must be cured; and (d)  that failure to cure the 
default on or before the date  specified in the notice may 
result in acceleration of the sums secured by this [agreement] and sale of the [p]roperty.  
BAC then nonjudicially foreclosed under HRS 
§ 667-5, repealed by H.B. 1875, 26th Leg., Reg. Sess. 
(2012). 
BAC published notice of the Llanes property auction on 
August 16, 2010, but, according to its October 2010 foreclosure 
affidavit and related documents, postponed the auction to 
September 7, 2010, and then again to September 27, 2010, where 
it placed the highest bid of $
439,690.66. In October 2010, 
BAC’s nominee, Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie 
Mae), took title to the property and sold the same to a third 
party the following year. 
At the time of the September 2010 foreclosure auction, 
Llanes owed a total of $549,613.33. Llanes had paid $5,513.74 
in principal and $26,169.51 in interest. 
2. The Codie property 
In 2005, Michael Codie and Lauren Codie (Codie) 
purchased an unimproved lot in Waikoloa, Hawai‘i, for 
$
225,000.00, including a $191,250.00 mortgage loan and a 
4  
 
 
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
$33,750.00 down payment. In 2006, they obtained a construction 
loan for $464,000.00, used to satisfy the original mortgage and, 
along with other funds, build a dwelling on the lot. 
In June 2007, Codie refinanced the existing mortgage 
with a $548,000.00 mortgage loan with Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. That same month, they acquired a $68,500.00 home equity 
line of credit (HELOC) from Lender. They paid at least 
$14,000.00 in closing costs associated with the 2007 refinance 
and used the refinanced mortgage to pay off the construction 
loan and related debts. 
In September 2008, Codie defaulted on the refinanced 
mortgage. In March 2009, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. assigned the Codie mortgage to Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, L.P. 
(CHLS), which nonjudicially foreclosed upon the property. That 
same month, Countrywide notified Codie that it intended to 
foreclose under the power of sale contained in their mortgage, 
which was identical to the one in the Llanes mortgage. CHLS 
published notice of the initial May 21, 2009, foreclosure 
auction in a newspaper once in March 2009 and twice the following month. CHLS then postponed the auction seven times 
until December 15, 2009. 
5  
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
According to CHLS’s foreclosure affidavit, at a 
December 15, 2009 auction, CHLS — which by then changed its name 
to BAC — bought the property for $615,062.91. In April 2010, Fannie Mae took title to the Codie property and subsequently 
sold the same to a third party the following year.  
At the time of the December 2009 foreclosure auction, 
Codie owed $673,497.97: $609,710.71 on the refinanced mortgage 
and $63,787.26 on the HELOC. Lender claims it “discharged” the 
HELOC in September 2012, but Codie disputes this claim, as set 
forth below. Codie paid $42,878.94 on the loans in total. 
Borrowers alleged, among other things, that BAC did 
not publish the actual auction dates for the foreclosed properties by newspaper at least fourteen days in advance 
thereof, as required by HRS § 667-5(a)(1). B. Circuit Court Proceedings 
In April 2019, Borrowers sued Lender for wrongful 
foreclosure. Count I alleged that Borrowers “were unlawfully deprived of the title, possession, and use of their real 
property” by Lender, who from 2008 to 2011, “offer[ed] 
properties without warranties of any kind and without any 
description, and h[eld] auctions on dates that were unpublished 
in any newspaper” to “reduce[] interest and attendance at the 
6  
 
 
   
 
  
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
auctions and increase[] the likelihood that [Lender] would be 
able to acquire the [p]roperty and hold it for resale.” Count 
II alleged that Lender engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices (UDAP) under HRS § 480-2(a) (2002). 
As relevant here, Borrowers sought restitution and 
damages, including the foreclosed properties’ market values plus 
interest, lost rent, acquisition and improvement costs, and 
treble damages under HRS § 480-13 (1987). 
In March 2021, after removal to and remand from 
federal court, Lender moved for partial summary judgment, 
contending that Borrowers did not prove damages. In July 2021, 
the circuit court, the Honorable Wendy M. DeWeese presiding, denied the motions because, “[b]ased on the factual disputes 
raised and the lack of clarity in existing law, the [c]ourt 
cannot find that there is no genuine issue of material fact and 
that [Lender] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” 
(Emphasis omitted.) 
In September 2021, we issued our decision in Lima v. 
Deutsche Bank Nat’l Tr. Co.
, answering a question certified by a 
federal court as follows: “[u]nder Hawai‘i law, a borrower with 
no pre-foreclosure rights in property except as encumbered by a 
mortgage bears the burden of accounting for the effect of the 
7  
 
 
   In December 2021, Lender renewed its summary judgment 
motion, arguing that, under Lima, Borrowers’ “claims fail as a 
matter of law” because Borrowers “put forth no evidence of 
damages that account for their pre-foreclosure mortgage debts.” 
Borrowers opposed the motion, arguing as relevant here that (1) Lima did not affect this Court’s earlier decisions providing 
out-of-pocket damages in certain wrongful foreclosure cases, and 
(2) Borrowers’ “[t]otal [d]amages [e]xceed the [l]awfully 
[f]orgiven [d]ebt.” Specifically, Borrowers claimed that 
Llanes’ “gross damages” were $650,535.55, including, among other 
things, the $505,200.00 obtained through the mortgage loan, and 
at least $30,000 in loss of use damages for a 12-month period beginning when they were “ousted” from the property and ending 
six months after it was sold to third parties. Borrowers also 
claimed that Codie’s “gross damages” were either $654,878.94, if 
using what Codie claimed was spent on the property, or 
$779,878.94, if using what Codie claimed was the market value of 
the property. Those damages include at least $40,000 in loss of 
use damages for a 16-month period beginning when they were 
“ousted” from the property and continuing until six months after 
it was sold to third parties. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
mortgage in establishing the element of harm.” 149 Hawai‘ i 457, 
469, 494 P.3d 1190, 1202 (2021).

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In August 2022, after hearing the summary judgment 
motion and permitting Borrowers to submit a supplemental 
memorandum on the same, the circuit court granted summary judgment to Lender, concluding that, under Lima, Borrowers had 
not “come forward with evidence of compensatory damages in an 
amount that exceeds their respective debt” when debt amounts are 
counted as “debt owed,” rather than damages.  
The circuit court reasoned that “[t]he proceeds from 
the Llanes [l]oan constitute debt owed by the Llanes 
[p]laintiffs to [Lender], not damages to the Llanes 
[p]laintiffs. 
Therefore, the loan proceeds cannot be included 
as damages to the Llanes [p]laintiffs and cannot be used to 
account for their debt on the Llanes [l]oan.” The circuit court 
further reasoned that “[t]here is no basis for including the 
value of the [Codie property] at the time of the Codie [l]oan as 
damages to the Codie [p]laintiffs or for using that value to 
offset their debt” because “[a]llowing such a valuation as 
damages would put the Codie [p]laintiffs in a much better 
position than they were pre-foreclosure where the property was a distressed asset in a depressed housing market.” 
The circuit court concluded that 
[e]xcluding the financed portion of the purchase price for 
the [Llanes p]roperty — but even including the alleged lost 
rental income — the Llanes [p]laintiffs claim that they sustained 
total damages in the amount of $144,668.55. The Llanes 
[p]laintiffs’ remaining claimed damages of $144,668.55 does not 
exceed their debt on the Llanes [l]oan at the time of 
9  
 
 
  
 
 Excluding the purported value of the [Codie p]roperty at 
the time of the Codie [l]oan  —  but even including the alleged lost 
rental income  —  the Codie [p]laintiffs claim that they sustained 
total damages in the amount of $104,878.94. The Codie 
[p]laintiffs’ remaining claimed damages of $104,878.94 does not exceed their debt on the Codie [l]oan at the time of foreclosure, 
which was $609,710.71. 
 
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
foreclosure, which was $549,613.33. 
 . . . . 
(Footnote omitted.) 
In September 2022, the circuit court entered final 
judgment on all claims and parties, and Borrowers appealed. 
We subsequently granted Borrowers’ application to 
transfer the case to this Court. 
C. The Parties’ Arguments on Appeal 
  On appeal and as relevant here, Borrowers argue that 
the circuit court erred by concluding that they bore the burden 
of proving their damages and did not meet that burden. 
Specifically, Borrowers argue that the damages calculation 
undertaken by the circuit court (1) “precludes any plaintiff 
from recovering damages,” (2) “bears no relationship to any 
reality of the exchange of property for debt,” (3) “provides no 
disincentive or deterrent to wrongful foreclosure at all[,]” and 
(4) “treats a person who invested and lost $200,000 of their own savings the same as one who invested less than $10,000.”  
First, Borrowers argue that the circuit court erred by 
failing to “apply the out-of-pocket loss damages remedy that 
10  
 
 
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Hawai‘i law provi des for wrongful nonjudicial foreclosure.”  
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Specifically, the circuit 
court “mistakenly subtract[ed] forgiven debt from the out-of-
pocket losses rather than from the price paid, thereby 
subtracting or accounting for the debt twice, and thus 
eliminating the out-of-pocket losses entirely.” (Emphasis and 
internal quotation marks omitted.) Subtracting the debt twice, Borrowers argue, effects a “forfeiture” they claim our case law 
precludes. 
Second, Borrowers argue that the circuit court erred 
by concluding that the Codie HELOC debt “had been discharged and 
that discharge meant forgiveness” because (1) Lender “never 
showed or explained what it meant by discharge,” (2) “no 
discharge (or forgiveness or satisfaction) could have occurred by way of the tortious foreclosure sale since liability for a 
loan secured by a second mortgage loan is [not] 
forgiven . . . by a foreclosure performed under the first 
mortgage,” and (3) “the record showed that any claimed discharge 
occurred more than a year after the tort was complete and 
damages had already been sustained.” 
(Emphasis and internal 
quotation marks omitted.) 
Finally, Borrowers argue that the circuit court erred 
“because the evidence presented by [Lender] on both the original 
2021 (denied) summary judgment motion and on the Renewed Motion 
11  
 
 
  
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
did not meet the movant’s burden to establish a right to summary 
judgment.” 
While Borrowers acknowledge that Lima requires them to 
“account for” outstanding debt, they maintain that out-of-pocket damages should be calculated by “subtracting [forgiven] debt 
from the total of all sums invested, both savings and borrowed.” 
(Emphasis omitted.) 
For its part, Lender argues that the circuit court 
correctly determined that Lima requires Borrowers to subtract 
their debt from their damages. Specifically, Lender argues that 
Borrowers impermissibly “include[] the unpaid portion of [their] 
mortgage loans in their damages calculations.” Second, Lender argues that the circuit court did not err in holding that 
Borrowers must show damages to survive summary judgment because 
the burden at summary judgment lies with the party bearing the 
burden of proof at trial. 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
12  Summary judgments are reviewed de novo and are only 
appropriate where no genuine issue of material fact is established by admissible evidence, when the evidence and 
inferences drawn therefrom are viewed in the light most favoring 
the party opposing summary judgment. City and Cnty. of Honolulu
v. Victoria Ward, Ltd., 153 
Hawai‘i 462, 475-76, 541 P.3d 1225, 
1238-39 (2023). We may affirm summary judgments on any grounds  
 
 
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
in the record, including those upon which the circuit court did 
not rely. Reyes v. Kuboyama
, 76 Hawai‘i 137, 140, 870 P.2d 1281, 
1284 (1994). 
III.
 DISCUSSION 
Borrowers ask this Court to hold that defaulting 
borrowers may receive compensatory damages for wrongful 
foreclosures of encumbered properties by adopting a novel 
approach that includes outstanding mortgage debt as part of 
Borrowers’ damages under Lima. As set forth below, however, we 
conclude that outstanding mortgage debt may not be counted as 
damages. Without including debt as part of their damages, Borrowers cannot prove their damages after accounting for their 
debts under Lima. Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court’s 
grant of summary judgment to Lender. 
“[S]ummary judgment in favor of the movant is proper 
when the non-movant plaintiff [f]ails to make a showing 
sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to 
the plaintiff’s case, and on which the plaintiff will bear the burden of proof at trial” because, “[i]n such a situation, there 
can be no genuine issue as to any material fact, since a 
complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the 
plaintiff’s case necessarily renders all other facts 
immaterial.” Lima
, 149 Hawai‘i at 464, 494 P.3d at 1197 
(brackets omitted). 
13  
 
 
   
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“It is axiomatic that plaintiffs bear the burden of 
establishing all necessary elements for their claims.” Lima
, 
149 Hawai‘i at 464, 494 P.3d at 1197.  A borrower “may assert a 
claim of wrongful foreclosure by establishing the following 
elements: (1) a legal duty owed to the mortgagor by the 
foreclosing party; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a causal 
connection between the breach of that duty and the injury sustained; and (4) damages.” 
Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo
, 
143 Hawaiʻi 249, 264 n.12, 428 P.3d 761, 776 n.12 (2018). 
For their UDAP claims to survive summary judgment, 
Borrowers must show “(1) either that the defendant violated the UDAP statute (or that its actions are deemed to violate the UDAP 
statute by another statute), (2) that the consumer was injured 
as a result of the violation, and (3) the amount of damages 
sustained as a result of the UDAP violation.” Lima
, 149 Hawai‘i 
at 464-65, 494 P.3d at 1197-98. “[I]t is well-settled that all 
tort claims require that damages be proven with reasonable 
certainty.” Id.
 at 467, 494 P.3d at 1200. Thus, Borrowers 
“must adduce evidence that they have suffered damages.” Id. at 
465, 494 P.3d at 1198. 
“Hawai‘i law recognizes three categories of damages in 
tort actions: (1) compensatory damages, (2) punitive damages, and (3) nominal damages.” 
Id.
 at 465, 494 P.3d at 1198. 
14  
 
 
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Because (1) a wrongful foreclosure plaintiff “cannot rely on 
nominal damages to withstand a motion for summary judgment,” 
id., (2) “punitive damages generally must be supported by an award of nominal or compensatory damages,” id., and (3) the 
damages which may be trebled under HRS § 480-13 and for which 
Borrowers prayed are compensatory, see Leibert v. Fin. Factors,
Ltd., 71 Haw. 285, 293, 788 P.2d 833, 838 (1990) (holding that 
treble compensatory damages is maximum amount allowed under HRS 
§ 480-13); Zanakis-Pico v. Cutter Dodge, Inc., 98 Hawai‘ i 309, 
319, 47 P.3d 1222, 1232 (2002) (noting same), Borrowers must 
show compensatory damages, which are intended “to recompense a 
tort victim for the value of the loss sustained,” Lima, 149 
Hawai‘i at 467, 494 P.3d at 1200, to survive summary judgment. 
Because our decisions in Santiago v. Tanaka
, 137 
Hawai‘i 137, 366 P.3d 612 (2016), and 
Lima are central to 
Borrowers’ arguments, we recount them below. Other cases relied 
upon by Borrowers do not change our analysis and are not 
discussed. 
Santiago was a case where a property seller made 
fraudulent misrepresentations to a buyer and foreclosed upon the subject property without having any right to do so. Louis and 
Yong Hwan Santiago purchased a tavern from seller Ruth Tanaka, 
who misrepresented the tavern’s sewer service costs during their 
15  
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
negotiations. 137 Hawaiʻ i at 154, 366 P.3d at 629. The 
Santiagos purchased the tavern from Tanaka with an $800,000.00 
down payment and a $500,000.00 mortgage loan, the terms of which 
did not include a power of sale. Id. at 140, 156, 366 P.3d at 
616, 631. Upon discovery of the sewer fees, the Santiagos disputed the fees and initially withheld mortgage payments 
before curing the default. See id. at 157, 366 P.3d at 632. 
Some four months later Tanaka sold the tavern to herself in a 
nonjudicial foreclosure auction, and then resold it to a third 
party. Id. at 148, 157-58, 366 P.3d at 623, 632-33. 
  We held that Tanaka improperly foreclosed upon the 
Santiagos’ tavern because (1) her misrepresentations and non-
disclosures induced the Santiagos to purchase the tavern, 
(2) the mortgage altogether lacked a power of sale, and (3) the Santiagos cured their default. Id. at 152, 156-57, 366 P.3d at 
627, 631-32. Because the tavern could not be returned to the 
Santiagos, having been resold, we concluded that they were 
entitled to “out-of-pocket losses of $1,412,790.79 as a result 
of [the seller’s] wrongful foreclosure of the [m]ortgage and 
subsequent sale of the [t]avern.” Id. at 158-59, 366 P.3d at 
633-34. 
Five years later, we decided Lima, which directly 
addressed the issues at the center of this appeal.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Specifically, we addressed the following question, certified by 
a federal court: 
Is the effect of the mortgage considered only as a matter 
of setoff that a lender has the burden of proving after the 
borrower establishes the amount of the borrower's damages, 
or does a borrower with no preforeclosure rights in 
property except as encumbered by a mortgage bear the burden 
of accounting for the effect of the mortgage in establishing the element of harm in the liability case? 
Lima, 149 Hawai‘ i at 460, 494 P.3d at 1193. 
Lima arose from three putative class actions, 
initially filed in the Hawai‘ i courts but later removed to 
federal court and involving substantially similar facts: 
[e]ach [p]laintiff [b]orrower mortgaged real property to one of the [d]efendant [b]anks. However, [p]laintiff 
[b]orrowers defaulted on their mortgages. The relevant 
[d]efendant [b]ank conducted nonjudicial foreclosure sales of the mortgaged properties pursuant to [HRS] § 667-5.  
However, [d]efendant [b]anks did not strictly comply with 
the procedural requirements of HRS § 667-5.  For instance, 
[d]efendant [b]anks allegedly postponed some of the foreclosure auctions without publishing a notice. The 
properties were then either sold to third parties during 
the foreclosure sales or purchased by the mortgage- holding 
[d]efendant [b]ank and resold to third parties after the 
foreclosure sales. 
Id. at 460-61, 494 P.3d at 1193-94 (footnote omitted). 
After the Lima borrowers sued for wrongful 
foreclosure, the defendant banks moved for summary judgment, 
contend[ing] that [the borrowers] would not be able to show 
that they were harmed, or suffered any damages, because 
[the borrowers] did not show that (1) they could have made their loans current, (2) their properties could have sold at a higher price but for [d]efendant [b]anks’ alleged 
actions, or (3) their properties were worth more than their 
remaining mortgage debts. 
Id. at 462, 494 P.3d at 1195. 
17  
 
 
   
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The Lima borrowers “respond[ed] that it was sufficient 
for [them] to show that they lost title, possession, and any 
investments in their properties to establish their damages to survive a motion for summary judgment,” and that “they did not 
need to factor in their remaining mortgage debts because the 
debts were only relevant as a set off [d]efendant [b]anks must 
prove.” Id.The federal court then certified the question to 
this Court, which agreed to consider the question. Id.
As relevant here, we held that “[b]orrowers must 
account for their mortgage debts when establishing harm.” Id.
at 467, 494 P.3d at 1200. We reasoned that the “[b]orrowers 
bear the burden of establishing their damages,” and, “[i]n establishing damages, [the b]orrowers must account for the value 
of their mortgages.” Id.This, we wrote, was “confirm[ed]” by 
Santiago because, while factually distinct — the Santiagoplaintiffs “had effectively paid off their mortgage debt” and 
therefore “had no remaining mortgage debt to disregard” — “under 
the out-of-pocket rule, the damages are the difference between 
the actual value of the property received and the price paid for the property, along with any special damages naturally and 
proximately caused, including expenses incurred in mitigating 
the damages.” Id. at 468-69, 494 P.3d at 1201-02 (brackets,

ellipsis, and internal quotation marks omitted). And, 
“[n]otably, when determining out-of-pocket losses, the party 
seeking damages is precluded from any recovery if the value of the property that he or she received in exchange equals or 
exceeds the value of the property parted with by him or her,” 
meaning that “Santiago demonstrates that [the borrowers’] price 
paid must be set off by the actual value of the property 
received when calculating damages.” Id. at 469, 494 P.3d at 
1202 (internal quotation marks omitted). 
We therefore concluded that 
[b]orrowers must account for their remaining mortgage debts 
when they establish their damages. Although [the 
borrowers] did not receive any actual property, they 
nevertheless received significant value in the form of 
forgiven mortgage debts. This constitutes the “actual value of the property received” by [the borrowers]. 
Meanwhile, [the borrowers’] “price paid for the property” 
consists of whatever mortgage payments they had made before 
the nonjudicial foreclosures as well as any other special 
damages they can prove. Under these circumstances, 
Santiago  establishes that [the borrowers’] investments and 
special damages must be offset by their mortgage debts.  
Id. (footnote omitted). 
Borrowers argue that Hawai
‘i courts should not consider 
why a given foreclosure was wrongful when calculating damages. 
We disagree. Hawai‘i law distinguishes between unlawful 
foreclosures that were “merely procedurally defective” and those 
that were undertaken “without foreclosure authority” at all. 
Wong v. Ass’n of Apartment Owners of Harbor Square

  Santiago and Lima support the distinction between 
procedurally defective wrongful foreclosures and those that were 
altogether unauthorized. We clarified this distinction in Lima. There, we wrote that, “in contrast to [the Lima borrowers] who 
owed significant sums they could not repay on their mortgages, 
the Santiagos had effectively paid off their mortgage debt,” 
meaning “the Santiagos had no remaining mortgage debt to 
disregard.” Lima, 149 
Hawai‘i at 468-469, 494 P.3d at 1201-1202. 
Therefore, “Santiago does not support th[e] proposition” that 
“any remaining mortgage debt be disregarded, and the investment 
value in the property be returned to borrowers without setoff.” 
Id. at 468, 494 P.3d at 1201. 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
We recently had occasion to further clarify this 
distinction, noting that “not all plaintiffs are like the 
Santiagos. 
For damages purposes, they do not automatically slot 
into a pre-tort world where they never bought the property.” 
Wong
, 154 Hawai‘i at 65, 545 P.3d at 554. “First, no lender 
could foreclose” upon the Santiagos’ property. Id.Second, 
“[t]he Santiagos were current on their mortgage.” Id.
Here, Borrowers were in different pre-foreclosure 
positions than were the Santiagos for two reasons. 
First, 
Lender had the right to foreclose upon their properties under 
powers of sale. Thus, their “pre-tort position still includes a 
looming foreclosure.” Id. at 66, 545 P.3d at 555. Second, 
20  
 
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Borrowers were not current on their mortgages. Thus, to the 
extent that they were improper at all, the foreclosures at issue 
here appear from the record to have been “merely procedurally defective.” Indeed, the circuit court noted in its summary 
judgment order that Borrowers “claim that [Lender] conducted the 
foreclosures in a wrongful manner by not complying with the 
technical requirements of the nonjudicial foreclosure statute 
and power of sale,” instead of “claim[ing] that the foreclosures 
were wrongful because they should not have happened at all.” 
As we explained in Lima, Santiago does not support the 
proposition that mortgage debt may be disregarded for the 
purposes of proving damages. We wrote in Santiago that, “[u]nder the out-of-pocket rule, the damages are the difference 
between the actual value of the property received and the price 
paid for the property, along with any special damages naturally 
and proximately caused . . . , including expenses incurred in 
mitigating the damages.” 137 Hawai‘ i at 159, 366 P.3d at 634 
(internal quotation marks omitted). The actual value received 
here was, as in Lima, the “forgiven mortgage debts,” and this is 
the amount by which “Borrowers’ price paid must be set off.” 
149 Hawai‘ i at 469, 494 P.3d at 1202 (internal quotation marks 
omitted). 
21  
 
 
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
As Borrowers indicated at oral argument, they arrived 
at their damages figures by “taking everything that was invested 
in this property, removing the debt, and what was left in there was [Borrowers’] out-of-pocket loss.” Oral Argument at 
00:07:04, http://oaoa.hawaii.gov/jud/oa/24/SCOA-021524-SCAP-22-
0000547.mp3 [https://perma.cc/59FE-9SQ4]. However, Borrowers 
conceded in their briefing that under their damages 
calculations, “[d]ebt is in both the top line and bottom line, 
but in the top line it is the invested portion of the debt, and 
in the bottom line it is the forgiven portion of the debt.” 
(Emphases and internal quotation marks omitted.) The effect of 
this approach is to factor out — rather than to factor in – debt. 
Lima requires factoring in debt, which is the opposite 
of what Borrowers’ proposed damages calculations do. Because 
“invested . . . debt” remains debt, it cannot count as damages. 
As we wrote in Lima
, “[u]nder Hawai‘i law, a borrower with no 
pre-foreclosure rights in property except as encumbered by a 
mortgage bears the burden of accounting for the effect of the 
mortgage in establishing the element of harm.” 149 Hawai‘ i at 
469, 494 P.3d at 1202. This means that “[t]o prove compensatory 
damages, the [borrower] must factor in the mortgage’s value.” 
Wong
, 154 Hawai‘i at 64, 545 P.3d at 553. Borrowers’ formula 
22  
 
 
   
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
does not account for the mortgages that were encumbering their 
properties at the time of the foreclosures. We therefore 
decline to adopt Borrowers’ formula for the purposes of calculating damages under Lima. 
Borrowers argue that, to the extent that Lima 
addressed wrongful foreclosure damages calculations, it did so 
via dicta. Specifically, Borrowers assert that Lima “expressly 
declined to address the broader question of how damages are 
measured.” Thus, they argue, “comments in Lima that go beyond 
the certified question, and address the minuend of the 
subtraction, should be treated as dicta.” 
We conclude that the circuit court properly relied 
upon Lima and correctly applied its rationale. As the circuit court concluded, “[t]he proceeds from the Llanes [l]oan 
constitute debt owed by the Llanes [p]laintiffs to [Lender], not 
damages to the Llanes [p]laintiffs. Therefore, the loan 
proceeds cannot be included as damages to the Llanes 
[p]laintiffs and cannot be used to account for their debt on the 
Llanes [l]oan.” The circuit court also properly determined that “[t]here is no basis for including the value of the [Codie 
property] at the time of the Codie [l]oan as damages to the 
Codie [p]laintiffs or for using that value to offset their debt” 
23  
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
because “[a]llowing such a valuation as damages would put the 
Codie [p]laintiffs in a much better position than they were pre-
foreclosure where the property was a distressed asset in a depressed housing market.” 
“[A]ccounting for the effect of the mortgage in 
establishing the element of harm,” Lima
, 149 Hawai‘i at 469, 494 
P.3d at 1202, means, as noted above, “factor[ing] in the 
mortgage’s value,” 
Wong
, 154 Hawai‘i at 64, 545 P.3d at 553.  
This reading comports with “the general rule in measuring 
damages[, which] is to give a sum of money to the person wronged 
which as nearly as possible, will restore him or her to the 
position he or she would be in if the wrong had not been 
committed.” Lima
, 149 Hawai‘i at 467, 494 P.3d at 1200 (internal 
quotation marks and brackets in original omitted). Because we 
hold that debt may not be counted as damages in wrongful 
foreclosure actions, the circuit court properly concluded that 
Borrowers did not prove the damages element of their wrongful 
foreclosure claims under 
Lima. 
Moreover, under Borrowers’ own theory, they did not 
walk away empty-handed — their initial “invested debt” was returned to them on the backend when it was forgiven. The 
satisfaction of Borrowers’ mortgage debts, which they do not 
contest here, represents a return of their “investment” on their 
24  
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
own theory. If the “invested debt” was theirs on the front end, 
it was also theirs on the backend. Thus, contrary to Borrowers’ 
claims, they did not “forfeit[]” their investments. Indeed, the claimed out-of-pocket losses, less the outstanding mortgage 
debts, are exceeded by their “forgiven debt[s].” 
We conclude, however, that borrowers are entitled to 
consideration of loss of use in calculating their damages. 
Lost 
use damages appear to fall within Lima’s conception of “special 
damages.” 149 Hawai‘i at 466, 494 P.3d 1190 (citing 
Bynum v. 
Magno
, 106 Hawai‘i 81, 85, 101 P.3d 1149, 1153 (2004). We 
therefore conclude that, even in the type of foreclosure at 
issue here — that is, one in which the foreclosing lender (who 
had the power to foreclose) failed to conform to the technical 
requirements of the nonjudicial foreclosure statute — a borrower 
can claim lost-use damages. However, such amounts are a “mere 
component” of their compensatory damages, which must be “offset 
by their mortgage debts.” Lima
 at 466, 469, 494 P.3d at 1199, 
1202. 
Llanes and Codie prayed for $30,000.00 and $40,000.00, 
respectively, in lost rent, which the circuit court denied them 
because 
such an award ignores that [Borrowers] were in default on 
their respective loans and [Lender] had the right to 
foreclose on the properties such that [Borrowers] could not earn rental income. In other words, [Borrowers'] pre- tort 
position to which they must be restored was in default on 
their loans and facing imminent foreclosure. To award 
25  
 
 
   
 
 
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
[Borrowers] lost rental income post- foreclosure assumes 
that the foreclosures should not have happened at all, 
which is incorrect — there is no dispute that [Borrowers] 
were in default on their respective loans and that [Lender] 
had the right to foreclose on the properties. 
We disagree with the circuit court’s analysis on this 
point, to the extent it suggests that borrowers can never 
recover loss of use damages for a procedurally improper 
foreclosure if they are otherwise subject to “imminent 
foreclosure.” Lima clearly indicates that such damages are 
potentially recoverable. While the borrower’s pre-tort position 
may have included imminent foreclosure, the borrower may still 
be subjected to harm in the form of lost use. 
However, this analysis does not change the outcome 
here. Under Lima, borrowers must still account for their 
mortgage debt in determining their pre-foreclosure positions. 
As the circuit court noted, even assuming arguendo that the 
Llanes were entitled to $30,000 and the Codies $40,000 for loss 
of use damages, their total compensatory damages do not exceed 
their mortgage debt. 
Borrowers’ other arguments against our reading of Lima 
are unavailing. For example, Borrowers’ contention that Santiago, Lima, and related cases “make clear that calculating 
damages to avoid forfeiture of the plaintiff’s interest involves 
26  
 
 
   
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
calculating the difference between two values to arrive at out-
of-pocket loss” lacks merit. (Emphasis and internal quotation 
marks omitted.) “[A] key factor” in determining a plaintiff’s pre-tort interest in a wrongful foreclosure case is what debt 
was encumbering the foreclosed-upon asset. Lima, 149 Hawai‘ i at 
467, 494 P.3d at 1200. Without factoring in mortgage debt in 
calculating a defaulting plaintiff’s pre-tort interest in the asset, that interest would be over-valued. 
While “there is a remedy” under our law “for every 
wrong,” as Borrowers emphasize, that principle does not support 
overlooking other relevant principles governing damages awards. 
Kamau v. Cty. of Haw., 41 Haw. 527, 539 (1957). As we wrote in 
Lima
, the wrongful foreclosure remedy is compensatory damages 
“proven with reasonable certainty.” 149 Hawai‘i at 467, 494 P.3d 
at 1200. 
As set forth above, such proof requires consideration 
of the actual value of the property received by the borrower. 
Borrowers’ suggestion that the circuit court’s approach “provides no disincentive or deterrent to wrongful foreclosure 
at all” does not change this analysis. 
This case calls for a 
straightforward application of Lima’s holding that debt must 
27  
 
 
   
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
factor in to damages calculations. Lima forecloses the 
possibility that debt may be counted as damages. However, this 
does not mean that the law provides no remedy or deterrent. 
Hawai‘i’s wrongful foreclosure law provides compensatory damages  
for proven out-of-pocket losses, taking debt into account, and, 
where a subject property has not been sold to a subsequent 
purchaser, “the classic remedy for such a cause of action: 
return of title and possession.” Santiago
, 137 Hawai i ‘ at 154 
n.33, 366 P.3d at 629 n.33. 
Lastly, the argument that Codie did not bear the 
burden of showing that Lender never forgave the Codie HELOC 
lacks merit. 
As noted above, Codie bore the burden at summary 
judgment of proving the damages element of their wrongful foreclosure claim, which included establishing that the 
purportedly unforgiven Codie HELOC satisfied this element. 
For the foregoing reasons, we hold that outstanding 
debt may not be counted as damages in wrongful foreclosure 
cases. Because the circuit court correctly determined that Borrowers did not prove the damages element of their wrongful 
foreclosure claims, it properly granted summary judgment to 
Lender.
