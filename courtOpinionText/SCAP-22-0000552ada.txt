APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

ASSIGNED BY REASON OF VACANCIES 
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J.  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
I. 
This case is about calculating damages when a condominium 
association wrongfully forecloses on a unit owner. 
Stephen Wong bought a condominium in the Harbor Square 
complex. The Association of Apartment Owners (AOAO) of Harbor 
Square governs the development. Wong financed his purchase with 
a mortgage. Eventually the mortgage balance exceeded the 
condo’s value. 
Wong fell behind on his association assessments. Because 
Wong owed fees, the AOAO non-judicially foreclosed under Hawaiʻ i 
Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 667. Turns out, the foreclosure surpassed the AOAO’s statutory authority. 
Wong sued for wrongful foreclosure. The AOAO said he had 
no case, because he suffered no damages. The Circuit Court of the First Circuit agreed. It granted the AOAO’s motion for 
summary judgment. 
This case explains what a plaintiff who suffers a wrongful 
foreclosure by an AOAO that had no authority to foreclose at all 
must show to satisfy the damages element of the tort. We hold that damages are the plaintiff’s positive equity in the 
property, if any, (property’s market value minus outstanding 
mortgage debt), plus lost use arising from the wrongful 
foreclosure, minus assessments owed to the AOAO. This places 
2  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the plaintiff in their pre-tort position with a remedy tethered 
to the wrong. 
In many cases, the homeowner who suffers a wrongful AOAO 
foreclosure will be “underwater” – owing more on their mortgage 
than the home’s fair market value. This does not necessarily 
mean they forego a remedy where an AOAO lacked authority to 
foreclose. If an underwater plaintiff shows that the value of 
their wrongly taken use exceeds what they owe the AOAO in assessments, they may pursue their claim. 
Here, Wong made no such showing. He failed to establish 
lost use value. Thus, we affirm the circuit court’s grant of 
summary judgment to the AOAO. 
II. 
We lay out the factual background, the legal context for 
non-judicial foreclosures by an AOAO, and the parties’ appellate arguments. 
A. Factual Background The parties dispute several monetary amounts, including how 
much Wong paid for the condo. Because the AOAO moved for summary judgment, we view the facts in the light most favorable 
to Wong. See Stanford Carr Dev. Corp. v. Unity House, Inc.
, 111 
Hawaiʻi 286, 295, 141 P.3d 459, 468 (2006). Thus, we adopt 
Wong’s presented numbers for purposes of this appeal. Our 
3  
  
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
analysis though would not change even if we used the AOAO’s 
numbers. 
Wong purchased a Honolulu condominium in 2005. He says he 
paid roughly $500,000, financing the purchase in part with a 
$420,750 mortgage. 
In 2006, Wong refinanced, increasing his mortgage debt to 
$450,000. 
By August 2009, Wong stopped paying both his monthly 
mortgage and his AOAO fees. In 2010, mortgagee Wells Fargo assigned Wong’s mortgage to HSBC Bank. 
The AOAO initiated a non-judicial foreclosure on Wong’s 
property in July 2011. The AOAO believed that HRS chapter 667 
empowered it to conduct non-judicial foreclosures on properties 
whose owners were delinquent on their assessments. Not so. 
This court ruled that those non-judicial foreclosures were 
unlawful unless the AOAO had a power of sale. Malabe v. Ass’n
of Apartment Owners of Exec. Ctr.
, 147 Hawaiʻi 330, 339, 465 P.3d 
777, 786 (2020). 
By the time the AOAO initiated foreclosure, Wong owed 
$29,335 in unpaid association and maintenance fees. 
His 
mortgage debt totaled $481,298. 
The AOAO conducted the non-judicial foreclosure in October 
2011. It held a public auction. At $1, the AOAO was the 
4  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
highest bidder. It sold the condo to itself. Wong lost title. 
Soon the AOAO rented out the unit. 
Though Wong had long ago stopped paying his mortgage, 
mortgagee HSBC Bank waited until May 2016 to start foreclosure 
proceedings. The case took a while. The circuit court entered 
final judgment for HSBC in February 2020. At that time, HSBC 
discharged Wong’s mortgage debt, now $711,699. Then in October 
2021, HSBC sold the condo for $576,000. 
Hawaiʻi law instructs AOAOs to turn over excess rental 
income collected following a final foreclosure judgment. HRS 
§ 514B-146(n) (2018 & Supp. 2019). The AOAO certified that it 
had no excess rents. It gave HSBC nothing. And the AOAO kept all the pre-foreclosure excess rents. 
Though Wong had long lost his property, he did not sue the 
AOAO until December 2019. 
Wong alleged that the AOAO wrongfully foreclosed. He says 
it conducted a non-judicial foreclosure under Part I of HRS 
Chapter 667; yet those foreclosures are only available to 
mortgage creditors holding a power of sale. See HRS § 667-5 (Supp. 2011), repealed by 2012 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 182, § 50 at 
684. The AOAO had no power of sale. It acted unlawfully and 
owes him, Wong insists. 
In April 2021, the AOAO filed a third-party complaint 
against its prior legal counsel. The AOAO alleged that its 
5  
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
counsel orchestrated and directed the wrongful non-judicial 
foreclosure. So, the AOAO says, the lawyers are liable for 
Wong’s damages, if any. 
The AOAO moved for summary judgment in January 2022. Wong 
was underwater when the AOAO non-judicially foreclosed. Thus, 
he suffered no compensatory damages, the AOAO argued. Although 
Wong’s condo was worth $448,000 in 2011, $481,298 of mortgage 
debt encumbered it. Citing Lima, the AOAO said a mortgagor receives a substantial benefit from discharged mortgage debt. 
Lima v. Deutsche Bank Nat’l Tr. Co.
, 149 Hawaiʻi 457, 467, 494 
P.3d 1190, 1200 (2021). Therefore, per the AOAO, the forgiven 
debt offsets Wong’s out-of-pocket loss. 
The lawyers joined the AOAO’s MSJ. 
Wong countered. 
He says the AOAO lost nothing when his 
mortgage debt was discharged. It shouldn’t get a windfall because someone else forgave his debt. 
Wong maintains the AOAO owes him the property’s value. He 
says Lima entitles him to recover his out-of-pocket losses. A 
figure Wong calculates as his purchase price (roughly $500,000), offset only by the dollar the AOAO paid at the foreclosure sale. 
Wong also argued that the collateral source rule applies. 
The collateral source rule directs that benefits received post-
tort from an independent source do not diminish a wrongdoer’s 
6  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
liability. Bynum v. Magno , 106 Hawaiʻi 81, 86, 101 P.3d 1149, 
1154 (2004). 
The AOAO responded that the collateral source rule’s 
purpose is to prevent a wrongdoer from receiving a windfall. 
The AOAO explained that it receives no windfall from offsetting 
the discharged mortgage debt. 
True, its dollar purchased the 
property, but only as encumbered by HSBC’s mortgage. 
In contrast, the AOAO says, paying Wong un-offset out-of-
pocket losses - $500,000 for a property whose mortgage he could not pay - gives him an undeserved windfall. 
The AOAO’s former lawyers later chimed in. The collateral 
source rule does not apply to discharged mortgage debt. The lawyers cited the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 920A cmt c 
(1979). 
The circuit court granted the AOAO’s MSJ in March 2022. It 
dismissed the case with prejudice. 
The court applied Lima. It included Wong’s discharged 
mortgage debt in its compensatory damages calculations. Because 
the discharged debt, totaling $711,699, exceeded Wong’s out-of-pocket loss, Wong had no compensatory damages. And no suit. 
First Circuit Court Judge Jeffrey Crabtree understood that 
unlike Lima, the foreclosing party here (the AOAO) was not the 
party that discharged Wong’s mortgage debt. But the court did 
not find the distinction meaningful. The mortgage debt is 
7  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“completely intertwined” with the foreclosed-upon unit, 
regardless of who discharged the debt, the court reasoned. 
The circuit court considered special damages, like lost 
rent. But Wong “offered no evidence of [those] damages.” Thus, 
the court ruled that Wong’s damages do not include “lost rents 
or other harms from being unable to rent out or live in” the 
condo. At oral argument before us, appellate counsel conceded 
that Wong had waived any damages claim related to lost rent and use, or the AOAO’s receipt of the property’s rental income. 
Wong appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals. Then 
he applied for transfer to this court. The AOAO and the lawyers 
supported the request. We accepted transfer. 
B. Legal Background 
For backdrop, we discuss HRS chapter 667, titled 
Foreclosures, and HRS chapter 514B, titled Condominiums. 
In 2011, chapter 667 provided two ways to conduct non-
judicial foreclosures, Part I and Part II. See HRS §§ 667-5 to 
667-10 (Part I) repealed by 2012 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 182, § 50 at 684; HRS §§ 667-21 to 667-42 (Part II). 
Part I permitted mortgagees with a power of sale to conduct 
non-judicial foreclosures and property auctions. A power of 
sale mortgage clause permits the mortgagee to sell foreclosed 
properties to recover on a delinquent loan. Part I provided 
8  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
property owners few protections because it required a power of 
sale. 
Part II opens non-judicial foreclosures to parties not 
holding a power of sale. Part II provides property owners 
greater protections as compared to Part I because it has a lower 
barrier to entry. These protections include heightened notice 
and auction requirements. HRS §§ 667-25 to 667-29. 
HRS chapter 514B makes chapter 667 non-judicial 
foreclosures available to AOAOs. HRS § 514B-146(a). Unpaid common expenses “constitute a lien on the unit.” Id.That lien 
“may be foreclosed by action or by nonjudicial or power of sale foreclosure” procedures described in chapter 667. Id.Chapter 
514B did not specify whether associations could access Part I, Part II, or both. 
Following chapter 514B’s enactment, some apartment 
associations conducted Part I non-judicial foreclosures. 
The 
Hawaiʻi Legislature reacted.  In 2012, it repealed HRS § 667-5, 
and HRS § 667-5.7 to § 667-8. This shut down Part I 
foreclosures. 
In 
Malabe, we ruled that because the AOAO lacked a power of 
sale, and therefore the authority to conduct Part I non-judicial foreclosures, the AOAO’s foreclosure was improper. Malabe
, 147 
Hawaiʻi at 340, 465 P.3d at 787.  
9  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Here, Wong alleges that the AOAO wrongfully foreclosed on 
his property by conducting a Part I non-judicial foreclosure. 
He says Part I non-judicial foreclosures were only available to 
those holding a power of sale. And the AOAO lacked a power of 
sale. 
C. The Parties’ Arguments on Appeal 
On appeal, Wong challenges the circuit court’s case-ending 
conclusion that his extinguished mortgage debt offsets his 
available damages. He argues that the circuit court erred by 
ruling that he failed to show compensatory damages. Lima, he 
thinks, is materially different. There the defendants were mortgage-holders. Because the mortgage debt was forgiven as 
part of the foreclosure, that benefit offset those plaintiffs’ 
recovery. Moreover, the Lima mortgage included a power of sale, 
and therefore the foreclosure in that case, he says, was merely 
procedurally defective. 
In contrast, Wong maintains, the AOAO did not hold his 
mortgage and therefore could not foreclose upon his unit under his mortgage’s power of sale. His mortgage debt was 
extinguished nine years later, and not by the wrongful non-
judicial foreclosure. Thus, the only change between Wong’s pre-
and post-tort positions was the loss of his property. Post-
tort, he still owed the mortgage debt. 
10  
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The AOAO counters that Lima applies. Wong benefitted when 
HSBC forgave the mortgage loan. That perk offsets his recovery. 
The AOAO says this court should assess Wong’s current position 
against his pre-tort position. And in the present day, Wong 
received substantial mortgage forgiveness. 
III. 
A wrongful foreclosure plaintiff must show that they 
suffered compensatory damages. Compensatory damages return the 
plaintiff to their pre-tort position. We detail how a plaintiff 
establishes these damages when an AOAO wrongfully forecloses. 
We also consider the collateral source rule. It does not 
apply to mortgage debt. 
A. Wong Must Show Compensatory Damages 
To establish a wrongful foreclosure, a plaintiff must 
establish: “(1) a legal duty owed to the mortgagor by the foreclosing party; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a causal 
connection between the breach of that duty and the injury sustained; and (4) damages.” Bank of America, N.A. v. Reyes-
Toledo
, 143 Hawaiʻi 249, 264 n.12, 428 P.3d 761, 776 n.12 (2018). 
Wong alleges facts that satisfy the first three elements. 
The question is whether Wong - and similarly situated underwater mortgagors who suffered a wrongful AOAO foreclosure – can show 
damages. 
11  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Tort actions under Hawaiʻ i law have three categories of 
damages: compensatory, nominal, and punitive. Lima, 149 Hawaiʻ i 
at 465, 494 P.3d 1198. Nominal damages cannot prove a wrongful 
foreclosure action’s damages element. Id.And generally, 
punitive damages “must be supported by an award of nominal or compensatory damages.” Id.
Thus, to survive summary judgment, Wong must present 
evidence that establishes compensatory damages. 
Plaintiffs in a wrongful foreclosure case must show that 
the damages “will restore [them] to the position [they] would be in if the wrong had not been committed.” Id. at 467, 494 P.3d 
at 1200 (cleaned up). Otherwise, a plaintiff cannot satisfy the damages element. B. Compensatory Damages Put the Plaintiff in their Pre-Tort 
Position 
A plaintiff’s pre-tort position controls. But how does a 
court identify that position when it includes mortgage debt? 
The answer begins with Lima. A plaintiff mortgagor “may 
not establish the damages elements of their wrongful foreclosure 
or [unfair or deceptive acts or practices (UDAP)] claims without 
accounting for their remaining mortgage debts.” Lima, 149 
Hawaiʻi at 467, 494 P.3d at 1200.  To prove compensatory damages, 
the mortgagor must factor in the mortgage’s value. 
Before the 
non-judicial foreclosure, mortgages encumbered the Lima 
12  
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
plaintiffs’ property. And they could not repay their debts. 
“[T]he debts constitute a portion of their pre-tort positions.” 
Id. 
Lima repeats “the basic principle that the purpose and goal 
of compensatory damages is to restore injured parties to their 
position prior to the wrongful conduct.” In re Tirso, No. 11-
01873 (RJF), 2022 WL 567704, at *2 (Bankr. D. Haw. Feb. 23, 2022), aff’d, 642 B.R. 833 (D. Haw. 2022). But, Lima “did not discuss every issue about the calculation of compensatory 
damages because the district court’s certified question was 
narrower than that.” Id.
Lima answered a certified question. That question 
structured this court’s answer. The certifying court asked: 
Is the effect of the mortgage considered only as a matter 
of setoff that a lender has the burden of proving after the 
borrower establishes the amount of the borrower’ s damages, 
or does a borrower with no preforeclosure rights in property except as encumbered by a mortgage bear the burden of accounting for the effect of the mortgage in 
establishing the element of harm in the liability case? 
Lima, 149 Hawaiʻi at 464, 494 P.3d at 1197. 
Lima
’s question was procedural. Does the outstanding 
mortgage come into play as a setoff, or is it an element to the 
claim? This court was clear. “Plaintiff Borrowers may not 
establish the damages elements of their wrongful foreclosure or 
UDAP claims without accounting for their remaining mortgage debts.” Id. at 467, 494 P.3d at 1200. 
13  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Our decision though had limited scope. Id. at 466, 494 
P.3d at 1199 (“it would be inappropriate to resolve” plaintiff’s 
questions on what damages are recoverable and how damages are 
measured). 
We now address the questions Lima left untouched: when an 
AOAO wrongfully forecloses, what damages are recoverable and how 
are damages calculated? 
Before Lima, this court also addressed wrongful foreclosure 
damages in Santiago v. Tanaka
, 137 Hawaiʻi 137, 366 P.3d 612 
(2016). The plaintiffs in that case were entitled to “their proven out-of-pocket losses from Tanaka’s wrongful foreclosure 
of the Mortgage.” 
Id.
 at 158, 366 P.3d at 633. Out-of-pocket 
losses “are the difference between the actual value of the 
property received and the price paid for the property, along 
with any special damages . . . including expenses incurred in 
mitigating the damages.” Id. at 159, 366 P.3d at 634. 
Santiago’s “out-of-pocket losses” language described how to 
put the unusually-situated Santiagos in their pre-tort position. 
See id. Santiago did not depart from the basic principle that 
compensatory damages aim to return the plaintiff to their pre-
tort position. 
The Santiagos bought a tavern from Tanaka. Id. at 140, 366 
P.3d at 615. The Santiagos financed the purchase with a large 
down payment and a mortgage from Tanaka. Id.Tanaka 
14  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
misrepresented the cost of the tavern’s sewer service. Id. at 
151, 366 P.3d at 626. The parties tried to mediate the sewer 
fee issue. When mediation hit an impasse, Santiago withheld one 
mortgage payment and deposited it in an escrow account. Id. at 
144, 366 P.3d at 619. Tanaka sent the Santiagos a notice of default and intent to foreclose. The Santiagos cured their 
default and resumed paying their mortgage. Id.
Still, Tanaka non-judicially foreclosed. Id. at 145, 366 
P.3d at 620. She bought the tavern at the ensuing foreclosure sale, and resold it to a third party. Id. at 145, 158, 366 P.3d 
at 620, 633. This court held that Tanaka unlawfully foreclosed. Id. at 157, 366 P.3d at 632. The mortgage lacked a power of 
sale and the Santiagos had cured their default on the mortgage. 
Id. at 155, 157, 366 P.3d at 630, 632. 
The Santiagos should not have lost the tavern. But it was 
too late to get the property back. Tanaka had resold it to 
someone else. Id. at 158, 366 P.3d at 633. 
Still, the Santiagos had a remedy. This court awarded 
damages that put the Santiagos in the position they would have been in had they not bought the tavern. Id.Because the value 
the Santiagos received in the foreclosure was zero (they had made “virtually full payment” on the mortgage to Tanaka), the 
measure of their position before they bought the tavern was 
their “out-of-pocket losses.” Id.We awarded the Santiagos 
15  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“the price paid for the property”: their downpayment, mortgage 
payments, closing costs, property taxes, and attorney fees. Id.
at 158–59, 366 P.3d at 633–34. 
There are two reasons the Santiagos’ proper pre-tort 
position was their pre-purchase position. First, no lender could foreclose. The Santiagos were current on their mortgage. 
Second, the Santiagos relied on Tanaka’s falsehoods when they 
bought the tavern. So awarding the Santiagos what they spent in reliance on the misrepresentations was appropriate. Id. at 159, 
366 P.3d at 634. 
But not all plaintiffs are like the Santiagos. For damages 
purposes, they do not automatically slot into a pre-tort world where they never bought the property. 
The United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of 
Hawaiʻi delivers a useful example. Consider a homeowner who 
defaults on the mortgage, but the mortgagee’s foreclosure is procedurally defective. There, the mortgagee is entitled to 
foreclose; the wrong is how the sale takes place. Tirso, 2022 
WL 567704, at *3. Thus, the appropriate measure of damages is 
“the difference between the price that the property would have 
brought in a proper foreclosure sale and the price paid at the 
defective foreclosure sale.” Id. at *4. 
This measure of damages is “tethered to the wrong.” In re
Simon, No. 11-02788, 2023 WL 1971587, at *5 (Bankr. D. Haw. Feb. 
16  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
11, 2023). It restores the plaintiff “to the position [they] 
would be in if the wrong had not been committed.” Lima
, 149 
Hawaiʻi at 467, 494 P.3d at 1200. 
Santiago
’s “out-of-pocket losses” method does not make 
defendants cough up every dollar a plaintiff spends acquiring and maintaining the property. None of this court’s cases 
applying Santiago’s “out-of-pocket losses” language awarded the 
plaintiffs every item of damages the Santiagos won. 
 Lima built on Santiago’s foundation. Lima noted that 
Santiago’s “out-of-pocket losses” calculation accounted for the 
Santiago’s mortgage debt. 149 Hawaiʻi 468-69, 494 P.3d at 1201-
02. Because there was no mortgage debt, there was nothing to 
account for. Id.  
Lima
 recognized that although foreclosed mortgagors with 
outstanding debt don’t “receive any actual property, they nevertheless received significant value in the form of forgiven 
mortgage debts.” Id. at 469, 494 P.3d at 1202. Each dollar no 
longer owed is a dollar gained. Thus, a plaintiff’s outstanding mortgage debt must be accounted for. That is, it offsets the 
property’s market value at the time of the wrongful foreclosure. 
Id. 
Wong believes Lima aids his cause. Lima involved a 
wrongful non-judicial foreclosure by a mortgagee bank. Wong distinguishes his case. It involves a non-judicial foreclosure 
17  
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
by a non-mortgagee AOAO for unpaid association fees. Wong says 
he received no benefit from the AOAO’s foreclosure because his 
mortgagee did not concurrently discharge his debt. He was still 
liable on the mortgage. Yet he lost title to the property. 
Wong calculates his out-of-pocket losses as: the condo’s 
roughly $500,000 purchase price, offset only by the dollar the 
AOAO paid for it. But this calculation improperly restores Wong 
to a Santiago-like pre-condo-purchase position. 
Two differences separate Wong’s pre-purchase position and 
his position had the AOAO not wrongfully foreclosed (his proper pre-tort position). 
First, without the AOAO’s wrongful foreclosure, Wong still 
owed a mortgage he was seemingly unable to repay. Therefore, 
his pre-tort position still includes a looming foreclosure by 
HSBC. 
Second, Wong had no equity in his condo during the non-
judicial foreclosure. If he tried to sell his property in 2011, he would not have pocketed the condo’s full market value because 
of the debt encumbering the property. We therefore decline to 
award him the property’s un-offset value (minus one dollar). 
Further, we believe it’s unjust to make the AOAO pay Wong 
the condo’s full value. Mortgage foreclosures are equitable 
proceedings governed by equity rules. Santiago, 137 Hawaiʻ i at 
157, 366 P.3d at 632. When the AOAO bought the unit for a 
18  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
dollar at the foreclosure sale, it didn’t buy an unencumbered 
interest. It purchased the property subject to the mortgage. 
The AOAO owned the property for only the time it took HSBC to 
foreclose. Unwinding the wrongful foreclosure – redressing the 
wrong to Wong - should not cost the AOAO the full unencumbered 
value of the condo. 
Wong warns that offsetting debt when there is a non-debt-
holder wrongful taking will lead to doomsday. He says this approach incentivizes predatory behavior and immunizes 
wrongdoers who take advantage of underwater debtors. Debt-
financed new cars, for example, may attract car thieves. Wong 
forecasts that a car thief, if sued, would pay no damages if the 
car’s loan exceeds its value. 
Wong’s fears are misplaced. (Notwithstanding the rarity of 
lawsuits against car thieves.) Our decision and Lima only apply 
to wrongful foreclosures of real property. For Wong’s dire 
scenarios, the remedy is conversion. Conversion applies only to chattels. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 222A (1965) 
(“Conversion is an intentional exercise of dominion or control over a chattel.”). A conversion plaintiff receives the item’s 
full value. Id.Our decision and Lima leave conversion law 
undisturbed.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
C. How a Plaintiff May Show Damages for Wrongful Foreclosure 
by an AOAO 
To establish the damages element of a claim for wrongful 
foreclosure by an AOAO lacking foreclosure authority, plaintiffs 
must account for their remaining mortgage debts. The mortgage offsets the property’s market value at the time of the wrongful 
foreclosure. Lima, 149 Hawaiʻ i at 469, 494 P.3d at 1202. But 
negative equity does not thwart every path to relief. 
The 
plaintiff’s pre-tort position includes use of the property until 
the mortgagee’s foreclosure. Though behind on loan obligations, 
the plaintiff still has title. Plaintiffs may seek compensation 
for use even if they’re underwater on their mortgage. But this 
lost use is offset by what the plaintiff owes the AOAO for 
assessments until the mortgagee forecloses. 
A plaintiff’s pre-tort position also includes their 
equitable right to redeem the property before a final foreclosure judgment. See Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp. v.
Transamerica Ins. Co.
, 89 Hawaiʻi 157, 164, 969 P.2d 1275, 1282 
(1998) (recognizing equitable redemption). If a plaintiff can clearly show that they would have redeemed their property absent the AOAO’s wrongful foreclosure, they may assert damages from 
losing their equitable right. (Wong did not.) 
In 
Lima, the mortgage debt discharge was contemporaneous 
with the non-judicial foreclosure. So Lima did not anticipate

time elapsing between the wrongful foreclosure and the mortgage 
discharge. It doesn’t account for plaintiff’s lost use of the 
property between the wrongful foreclosure and the mortgagee’s 
valid foreclosure. Part of plaintiff’s pre-tort position in a 
wrongful AOAO foreclosure is the continued use and enjoyment of 
the property until the mortgagee’s ultimate foreclosure. 
Once a mortgagee validly forecloses, that foreclosure cuts 
off the plaintiff’s use right. Here, for example, had Wong established lost use damages, he would be owed them through 
February 2020, when HSBC concluded foreclosure proceedings.

Lani Condos.
, 152 Hawaiʻi 406, 413, 526 P.3d 383, 390 (2023) 
(“[T]he foreclosure judgment . . . cut off AOAO’s right to 
possession.”). 
So we add to 
Lima. Lima’s holding still applies. The 
property value must be offset by the mortgage debt. But Lima
did not obstruct other methods of showing compensatory damages. 
We lay out how a plaintiff who suffers a wrongful AOAO 
foreclosure may establish damages. A plaintiff shows damages if the following exceeds $0: 
21  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Positive equity in the property when wrongfully 
foreclosed, if any 
+ Lost rents or use from the time between the wrongful 
foreclosure and a valid foreclosure 
- Unpaid association fees and assessments up until the 
valid foreclosure. 
To recap: when an AOAO wrongfully forecloses without 
foreclosure authority, mortgage debt offsets the property’s 
market value, but does not count against the plaintiff’s lost 
22  For this calculation, a valid foreclosure occurs when a 
final foreclosure judgment is entered. See Nationstar, 152 
Hawaiʻi at 413, 526 P.3d at 390 (final foreclosure judgment ends 
AOAO’s right to possession). If a plaintiff sues an AOAO before 
a valid foreclosure occurs, the plaintiff calculates lost use 
and unpaid assessments when they file their complaint. 
 Also, for this calculation, the AOAO may only recoup 
assessments for common expenses and fees resulting from the 
plaintiff’s failure to timely pay. Attorney fees and any other 
costs for processing the wrongful foreclosure are excluded. 
Those costs do not count against the plaintiff. Picking up the 
tab for attorneys who wrongfully foreclose flips equity 
principles.   A plaintiff’s equity is the property’s fair market value 
when wrongfully foreclosed, less outstanding mortgage debt owed then.

use, net of assessments and fees owed to the AOAO. The debt 
doesn’t foil every path to relief. 
Yet under this framework, Wong still fails to establish 
compensatory damages. When the AOAO conducted its non-judicial 
foreclosure, Wong owed more on his now-discharged mortgage than 
the property was worth. He offered no evidence that he lost 
rents or use from the wrongful foreclosure. 
We therefore conclude that Wong did not satisfy his burden 
to show compensatory damages. The circuit court properly dismissed his claim. 
D. The Collateral Source Rule Does Not Apply 
Wong also argues that the collateral source rule saves him. 
The collateral source rule states “that benefits or 
payments received on behalf of a plaintiff, from an independent source, will not diminish recovery from the wrongdoer.” Bynum
, 
106 Hawaiʻi at 86, 101 P.3d at 1154. 
Wong says the benefit of the discharged debt should go to 
him, the wronged party, and not to the tortfeasor. 
Wong cites 
Bynum, which in turn quoted the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 920(A): “[B]enefits conferred on the injured party from other 
sources are not credited against the tortfeasor’s liability.” 
Id. Thus, Wong argues that when HSBC discharged his mortgage 
balance, it independently conferred a benefit to him. The AOAO 
23  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
lost nothing from HSBC’s discharge, Wong says. So, the 
discharged debt shouldn’t count against his recovery. 
We hold that the collateral source rule does not apply to 
mortgage debt. Sure, Bynum adopted the collateral source rule 
from the Restatement (Second) of Torts. 106 Hawaiʻ i at 86, 101 
P.3d at 1154. But the Restatement (Second) of Torts is plain: 
the collateral source rule applies to insurance policies, 
employment benefits, gratuities, and social legislation. 
Restatement (Second) of Torts § 920A, cmt. c. Not mortgage 
debt. Section 920A doesn’t mention mortgages. (Bynum applied 
comment c to hold that Medicare and Medicaid payments fall under 
the rule as social legislation benefits. 106 Hawaiʻ i at 89, 101 
P.3d 1157.) 
The collateral source rule does not apply to forgiven 
mortgage debt. 
IV. 
 Wong has not demonstrated damages. We affirm the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit’s orders.
