IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻ I

STATE OF HAWAIʻ I,  
Plaintiff-Appellant, 
 
vs. 
 
CHRISTOPHER L. WILSON, 
Defendant-Appellee. 
SCAP-22-0000561 
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CAAP-22-0000561; CASE NO. 2CPC-17-0000964) 
 
FEBRUARY 7, 2024 
 
RECKTENWALD, C.J., McKENNA, EDDINS, JJ., CIRCUIT JUDGE MORIKAWA 
AND CIRCUIT JUDGE TOʻ OTOʻO
, ASSIGNED BY REASON OF VACANCIES 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J. 
I. 
Article I, section 17 of the Hawaiʻi Constitution mirrors 
the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. We read 
those words differently than the current United States Supreme  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Court. We hold that in Hawaiʻ i there is no state constitutional 
right to carry a firearm in public. 
The State appeals an order dismissing two “place to keep” 
offenses, Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 134-25 (2011) (pistol 
or revolver) and § 134-27 (2011) (ammunition) filed against 
Christopher Wilson. Citing 
New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n,
Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U.S. 1 (2022), the Circuit Court of the 
Second Circuit dismissed the charges. 
The State challenges Wilson’s standing. 
The State says 
Wilson did not bother to apply for a carry license and thereby 
satisfy HRS § 134-9 (2011), Hawaiʻi’s license to carry law. So 
he can’t bring a 
Bruen-based constitutional challenge to HRS 
§ 134-25 and § 134-27. 
Wilson believes otherwise. 
He says HRS § 134-25(a) and 
§ 134-27(a) subvert his new constitutional right to protect 
himself in public by carrying a lethal weapon. Hawaiʻi’s place 
to keep laws violate the Second Amendment to the United States 
Constitution and its counterpart, article I, section 17 of the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution.   
Because the State charged Wilson with place to keep 
offenses, we conclude that Wilson has standing to challenge the constitutionality of those laws. 
A criminal defendant has 
standing to level a constitutional attack against the charged 
2  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
crime. See State v. Armitage, 132 Hawaiʻ i 36, 55, 319 P.3d 1044, 
1063 (2014). 
Wilson though lacks standing to confront HRS § 134-9 
(licenses to carry). The State does not charge him with 
violating HRS § 134-9 (it’s not a crime), and Wilson made no 
attempt to obtain a carry license. 
We reject Wilson’s constitutional challenges. Conventional 
interpretive modalities and Hawaiʻ i’s historical tradition of 
firearm regulation rule out an individual right to keep and bear 
arms under the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution.  In Hawaiʻ i, there is no 
state constitutional right to carry a firearm in public. 
Bruen snubs federalism principles. 
Still, the United 
States Supreme Court does not strip states of all sovereignty to 
pass traditional police power laws designed to protect people. 
Wilson has standing to challenge HRS § 134-25(a) and § 134-
27(a). But those laws do not violate his federal constitutional 
rights. 
 II. 
A. Charges and Alleged Facts 
In December 2017, the County of Maui Department of the 
Prosecuting Attorney charged Christopher Wilson by felony information. He allegedly violated: (1) HRS § 134-25(a) place 
to keep firearm, (2) HRS § 134-27(a) place to keep ammunition, 
(3) HRS § 134-2 (2011 & Supp. 2017) permit to acquire ownership 
3  
   
  
 
  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
of a firearm, and (4) HRS § 708-813(1)(b) (2014 & Supp. 2015), 
first degree criminal trespass. 
The facts are slim. Declarations and police reports 
submitted to support the parties’ position for the motion to 
dismiss comprise the factual record. 
In December 2017, at about 11:00 p.m., Flyin Hawaiian 
Zipline owner Duane Ting saw men on his fenced-in property via 
video surveillance. Ting reported the matter to the Maui Police Department. Officers headed to Ting’s property. Meanwhile 
Ting, driving an all-terrain vehicle, corralled Wilson and his 
three companions. Armed with an AR-15 assault rifle, he 
detained them until the police arrived. Then Wilson volunteered 
to the officers: “I have a weapon in my front waist band.”  The 
police lifted his shirt. Wilson had a Phoenix Arms .22 LR 
caliber pistol, loaded with ten rounds of .22 caliber 
ammunition. A records check reported that the pistol was 
unregistered in Hawaiʻ i, and Wilson had not obtained or applied 
for a permit to own a handgun. 
Wilson told the police that he 
legally bought the gun in Florida in 2013. 
B. Wilson’s Motions to Dismiss 
In May 2021, Wilson moved to dismiss counts 1 and 2. 
Citing District of Columbia v. Heller
, 554 U.S. 570 (2008) and 
McDonald v. City of Chicago, Ill., 561 U.S. 742 (2010), Wilson argued that prosecuting him for possessing a firearm for self-
4  
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
defense purposes outside his home violated his right to bear 
arms under the Second Amendment to the United States 
Constitution and article I, section 17 of the Hawaiʻi 
Constitution. 
The State opposed the motion. It presented records from 
Florida and the Department of Justice Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to refute Wilson’s remark 
about when and where he had purchased the gun. The records 
showed: (1) Wilson had not applied for or been issued a 
concealed weapon or firearm license pursuant to Florida law, and 
(2) in April 2011 someone not named Christopher Wilson purchased 
the pistol from a licensed firearms dealer in Florida. 
The circuit court denied Wilson’s motion to dismiss in July 
2021. 
It relied on 
Young v. Hawaiʻi
. There, the Ninth Circuit 
Court of Appeals held that the Second Amendment does not provide 
a right to openly carry a firearm for self-defense. Young v. 
Hawaiʻi
, 992 F.3d 765, 821 (9th Cir. 2021), cert. granted, 
judgment vacated, 142 S. Ct. 2895 (2022), and abrogated by New 
York State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n, Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U.S. 1 
(2022). 
In July 2022, Wilson filed a second motion to dismiss 
counts 1 and 2. Bruen had just come out. 
Wilson again challenged the constitutionality of HRS § 134-
25(a) and HRS § 134-27(a). His motion declares he carried the 
5  
   
  
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
gun solely for “self-defense purposes.” He says the place to 
keep laws violate his right to carry a handgun for self-defense 
outside his home. Both the United States and Hawaiʻ i 
Constitutions confer that right. Wilson maintains that HRS 
§ 134-25 and HRS § 134-27 - which confine firearms and 
ammunition to the “possessor’s place of business, residence, or 
sojourn” - had “no exceptions” for carrying firearms outside the 
home. Wilson describes these “absolute restrictions” as “out of 
step” with the “Nation’s historical tradition of firearm 
regulation.” 
The Maui Department of the Prosecuting Attorney (State) 
countered. 
First, the Second Amendment allows for some restrictions 
per Heller and Bruen. For instance, registration and permitting are constitutional. Second, unlike the Bruen
 plaintiffs, Wilson 
illegally possessed a handgun because he never tried to follow 
Hawaiʻi’s firearm registration and license to carry law. Because 
he didn’t apply for a permit, he lacks standing to raise a Second Amendment challenge. 
Circuit Court Judge Kirstin Hamman granted Wilson’s second 
motion to dismiss in August 2022. 
HRS § 134-25(a) and § 134-
27(a) infringed Wilson’s constitutional right to keep and bear a firearm for self-defense. 
6  
   
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The court ruled that Wilson had standing to challenge HRS 
§ 134-25(a) and § 134-27(a). Then it concluded that per Bruen, 
a right to keep and bear firearms for self-defense under the 
Hawaiʻi and United States Constitutions extends “outside the 
home.” The State had failed to meet its burden to show how HRS 
§ 134-25(a) and § 134-27(a) are “consistent with the Nation’s 
historical tradition of firearm regulation.” The circuit court 
also found that HRS § 134-25(a) and § 134-27(a) made “no 
exceptions for carrying firearms outside the home for self-
defense purposes.” [There are exceptions in those laws -
“[e]xcept as provided in sections 134-5 and 134-9.” This 
mistake though is immaterial to our decision.] 
The court dismissed counts 1 and 2 with prejudice. 
The State moved to reconsider. Then the Department of the 
Attorney General got involved. The court granted its request to file an amicus brief in support of the Maui Prosecuting 
Attorney’s motion. The Attorney General argued that Bruen does 
not stop states from requiring a license before bringing a 
firearm to a public place. The circuit court denied the motion to reconsider. 
The State appealed. Then it filed an application for 
transfer. We granted the transfer.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
III. 
We hold that the text and purpose of the Hawaiʻ i 
Constitution, and 
Hawaiʻi’s historical tradition of firearm 
regulation, do not support a constitutional right to carry 
deadly weapons in public. 
We conclude that HRS § 134-25 and § 134-27 do not violate 
Wilson’s right to keep and bear arms under article I, section 17 
of the Hawaiʻi Constitution and the Second Amendment to the 
United States Constitution. Since Wilson lacks standing to 
challenge HRS § 134-9, we do not take up his Second Amendment 
challenge to that law. 
A. Standing 
Wilson has standing. 
His standing though, is confined to 
challenging HRS § 134-25 and § 134-27, not HRS § 134-9. 
1. Wilson has standing to challenge HRS § 134-25 and 
§ 134-27 
The State argues Wilson has no standing to challenge 
Hawaiʻi’s place to keep crimes, HRS § 134-25 (pistol or revolver) 
and § 134-27 (ammunition). He didn’t bother to apply for a 
carry license and satisfy HRS § 134-9. So he can’t attack the 
licensing law. 
The State relies on California and New York cases where 
courts denied standing to criminal defendants who did not try to 
get a license to carry. 
They could not bring Bruen-based 
8  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
constitutional challenges. See, e.g., People v. Rodriguez, 171 
N.Y.S.3d 802, 806 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2022) (“Failing to seek a 
license before roaming the streets with a loaded firearm is not 
abiding by the law, and nothing in the Second Amendment requires 
that it be tolerated.”); People v. Velez, 302 Cal. Rptr. 3d 88, 
106 (Cal. Ct. App. 2022) (“[U]nlike the petitioners in Bruen, 
the record does not show, nor does [defendant] claim, that he 
applied for and was denied a license to possess the gun in question.”). 
Hawaiʻi law offers criminal defendants broad standing to 
challenge the constitutionality of criminal laws they are charged with violating. State v. Grahovac, 52 Haw. 527, 532, 
480 P.2d 148, 152 (1971). It allows challenges “[w]here 
restraints imposed act directly on an individual or entity and a 
claim of specific present objective harm is presented.” State
v. Bloss, 64 Haw. 148, 151, 637 P.2d 1117, 1121 (1981). 
Here, the State charges place to keep crimes. Because 
Wilson faces serious consequences, he has a claim of specific present objective harm. And this gives him standing to challenge the constitutionality of HRS § 134-25 and § 134-27. 
See Armitage
, 132 Hawaiʻi at 55, 319 P.3d at 1063 (defendants 
subject to penal liability under a regulation have “a claim of 
specific present objective harm,” and therefore standing to 
9  
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
challenge the constitutionality of that regulation) (citation 
omitted). 
2. Wilson lacks standing to challenge HRS § 134-9 
Unlike his challenges to HRS § 134-25 and § 134-27, Wilson 
does not have standing to challenge HRS § 134-9’s constitutionality. 
Wilson says HRS § 134-9 “may be unconstitutional” and that 
it is unreasonable to “[r]equire[] defendants to apply for licenses pursuant [to] a potentially unconstitutional statute as 
a prerequisite to challenging other statutes[.]” HRS § 134-9 is 
unconstitutional, Wilson’s argument goes, so he should not have 
to apply for a license to challenge the law. 
We disagree. Wilson has no standing to challenge HRS 
§ 134-9 without applying for a license. 
First, the State has not charged Wilson with violating HRS 
§ 134-9. Since “a criminal defendant cannot challenge the 
constitutionality of one subsection of a statute where he was charged under a different subsection,” a criminal defendant 
cannot challenge the constitutionality of an entirely different 
statute. Armitage
, 132 Hawaiʻi at 55, 319 P.3d at 1063; 
see also Grahovac
, 52 Haw. at 532, 480 P.3d at 152 (“a 
criminally accused has ‘standing’ to constitutionally challenge 
only the specific penal sanctions” charged (emphasis added)). 
10  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Next, HRS § 134-9 – Licenses to Carry - is not a criminal 
offense. It reads, in part: “No person shall carry concealed or 
unconcealed on the person a pistol or revolver without being 
licensed to do so under this section or in compliance with 
sections 134-5(c) or 134-25.” Nowhere does HRS chapter 134 
identify a criminal penalty for HRS § 134-9. And the reference to HRS § 134-25, the B felony place to keep handgun offense, 
signals that crime covers it. 
Last, Wilson did not bother to follow HRS § 134-9’s 
procedure to obtain a license to carry. Because Wilson made no attempt to get a license, he cannot claim the law’s application 
procedures are unconstitutional as applied to him. Armitage, 
132 Hawaiʻ i at 55–56, 319 P.3d at 1063–64 (defendants lacked 
standing because they did not follow a permit application 
procedure, and therefore could not “claim that the specifics of 
the application procedures . . . [were] unconstitutional as 
applied to them”). 
Wilson cannot show a specific present objective harm based 
on HRS § 134-9. Thus, his constitutional challenges are confined to HRS § 134-25 and § 134-27. Had Wilson followed the 
HRS § 134-9 application process, and been denied, then he might 
have standing to challenge that law’s constitutionality in his 
criminal case. But those are not his facts. So Wilson’s 
challenge is limited to HRS § 134-25 and § 134-27. 
11  
  
 
 B. HRS § 134-25(a) and § 134-27(a) do not violate Wilson’s 
right to keep and bear arms under article I, section 17 
1. Our Sequence of State Constitutional Interpretation 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Wilson invokes both the Hawaiʻ i and United States 
Constitutions. 
This court has yet to explain how we interpret matching 
state and federal constitutional provisions when both are in 
play. Do we look at the state constitution first? 
The federal 
constitution first? Both? If we interpret our constitution to provide more protection, do we even take up the federal 
constitution? 
We believe that the proper sequence to consider matching 
constitutional text is to interpret the Hawaiʻ i Constitution 
before its federal counterpart. 
Only if the Hawaiʻ i Constitution 
does not reach the minimum protection provided by a parallel 
federal constitutional right should this court construe the 
federal analogue. 
Thus, we interpret the Hawaiʻi Constitution first.  And may 
not get to the United States Constitution. See State v. Kono
, 
152 A.3d 1, 29 n.29 (Conn. 2016) (“If we address the state constitutional claim first and decide it in favor of the defendant, there is no reason to address the federal 
constitutional claim; for purposes of that case, the defendant 
is entitled to prevail under the state constitution, and it 
12  
    
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
simply does not matter which way the claim would have been 
decided under the federal constitution.”); State v. Moylett, 836 
P.2d 1329, 1332 (Or. 1992) (“if no state law, including the 
state constitution, resolves the issues, courts then should turn 
for assistance to the Constitution of the United States”). 
The Hawaiʻ i Constitution often offers “greater protections” 
than the federal constitution. State v. Santiago, 53 Haw. 254, 
265, 492 P.2d 657, 664 (1971). When the two contain look-alike 
provisions, Hawaiʻ i has chosen not to lockstep with the Supreme 
Court’s interpretation of the federal constitution. 
Rather, this court frequently walks another way. Long ago, 
the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court announced that an “opinion of the 
United States Supreme Court . . . is merely another source of 
authority, admittedly to be afforded respectful consideration, 
but which we are free to accept or reject in establishing the 
outer limits of protection afforded by . . . the Hawai
ʻi 
Constitution.” State v. Kaluna, 55 Haw. 361, 369 n.6, 520 P.2d 
51, 58 n.6 (1974). Further, “this court has not hesitated to 
adopt the dissents in U.S. Supreme Court cases when it was 
believed the dissent was better reasoned than the majority 
opinion.” State v. Mundon
, 129 Hawaiʻ i 1, 18 n.25, 292 P.3d 205, 
222 n.25 (2012). 
Interpreting the Hawaiʻ i Constitution is this court’s #1 
responsibility. 
So we reason independently, untethered from the 
13  
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Supreme Court’s analysis of the United States Constitution. 
State v. Texeira, 50 Haw. 138, 142 n.2, 433 P.2d 593, 597 n.2 
(1967). Hawaiʻi’s people “are entitled to an independent 
interpretation of State constitutional guarantees.” See State
v. Ball, 471 A.2d 347, 350 (N.H. 1983). That means this court, 
not the U.S. Supreme Court, drives interpretation of the Hawaiʻ i 
Constitution. 
“If we ignore this duty, we fail to live up to 
our oath” to defend Hawaiʻ i’s Constitution.  Id.
State constitutions have a distinct role under our nation’s 
system of federalism. 
Deciding a case first on state 
constitutional grounds respects state sovereignty and aligns 
with a key constitutional design feature – subnational 
governance. As the Oregon Supreme Court put it: 
The proper sequence is to analyze the state’s law, 
including its constitutional law, before reaching a federal 
constitutional claim. This is required, not for the sake 
either of parochialism or of style, but because the state does not deny any right claimed under the federal 
Constitution when the claim before the court in fact is 
fully met by state law. 
Sterling v. Cupp, 625 P.2d 123, 126 (Or. 1981) (en banc). 
The state-constitution-first approach recognizes the states 
as the cradle of rights.  State constitutions predated the 
Constitution as the original sources of constitutional rights. 
Hans A. Linde, First Things First: Rediscovering the States’ 
Bills of Rights, 9 U. Balt. L. Rev. 379, 380 (1980) (“State 
bills of rights are first in two senses: first in time and first 
14  
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
in logic.”). The Bill of Rights cut and pasted rights first 
ensconced in pre-1789 state constitutions. Id. at 381. And for 
more than a century, state constitutional rights were the only rights enforceable against state governments. See Gitlow v. New
York, 268 U.S. 652, 666 (1925) (incorporating the Bill of Rights against subnational actors). 
State constitutions provide a “double security” for the 
people’s liberty. The Federalist No. 51, at 321 (James Madison) (Isaac Kramnick ed., 1987). Per the Constitution’s design, the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution supplies an additional guarantee of 
individual rights. See, e.g., State v. Tanaka
, 67 Haw. 658, 
661, 701 P.2d 1274, 1276 (1985) (“We have not hesitated in the 
past to extend the protections of the Hawaiʻi Bill of Rights 
beyond those of textually parallel provisions in the Federal 
Bill of Rights when logic and a sound regard for the purposes of 
those protections have so warranted.”). 
But federalism is about more than just the relationship 
between state and federal governments. 
“[W]e must not forget 
that the virtue of federalism lies not in the means of permitting state experimentation but in the ends of expanded 
liberty, equality, and human dignity.” State v. Short, 851 
N.W.2d 474, 507 (Iowa 2014) (Cady, C.J., concurring specially). 
We honor the Hawaiʻi Constitution’s freestanding vitality.  
We interpret the Hawaiʻ i Constitution first.   
15  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
2. Wilson’s Constitutional Claims 
Wilson argues that HRS § 134-25(a) and § 134-27(a) violate 
his putative right to keep and bear arms under article I, 
section 17 of the Hawaiʻi Constitution and the Second Amendment’s 
brand-new right to bear arms in public for self-defense. 
HRS § 134-25(a) and § 134-27(a) criminalize the carrying of 
“a loaded . . . 
pistol or revolver” and “ammunition” “[e]xcept 
as provided in sections 134-5 and 134-9[.]” HRS § 134-9 permits 
the licensed carry of firearms outside the home. Thus, HRS § 134-25(a) and § 134-27(a) regulate firearm use by restricting 
the right to publicly carry a handgun and ammunition for self-
defense purposes to those who apply for and receive a carry 
license. 
Wilson possessed an unlicensed, concealed, and loaded 
handgun to, he says, protect himself. 
Only certain factual 
circumstances justify shooting another human in Hawaiʻi. Per HRS 
§ 703-304(2), “[t]he use of deadly force is justifiable . . . if 
the actor believes that deadly force is necessary to protect 
[themself] against death, serious bodily injury, kidnapping, 
rape, or forcible sodomy.” HRS § 703-304(2) (2014). 
The State argues Wilson’s handgun-toting conduct is not 
saved by the right to bear arms. 
He trespassed, a crime. He’s 
not “law abiding.” The State’s position makes sense in the 
abstract. Neither Bruen, nor any case, protect a right to 
16  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
commit a crime while armed. See People v. Gonzalez, 291 Cal. 
Rptr. 3d 127, 130 (Cal. Ct. App. 2022) (“We are aware of no 
court decision holding that the United States Constitution 
protects a right to carry a gun while simultaneously engaging in 
criminal conduct.”); United States v. Perez-Garcia, No. 22-CR-
1581-GPC, 2022 WL 17477918, at *3 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 6, 2022) (“[A] 
reasonable interpretation of Bruen is that it does not obfuscate 
the requirement that, as a threshold matter, to receive Second Amendment protection, one must first and foremost be law 
abiding.”). 
The State’s argument about Wilson’s alleged criminal 
conduct does not apply. 
Wilson’s criminal trespass charge 
(count 4) is not before this court. And it’s a trial matter. The parties dispute the facts in declarations attached to their 
motion to dismiss briefing. These declarations are fair game 
for now. They comply with 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 
47(a) (“If a motion requires the consideration of facts not 
appearing of record, it shall be supported by affidavit or 
declaration.”). 
Wilson denies trespassing. 
Wilson says that he and his 
friends “were hiking that night to look at the moon and Native Hawaiian plants.” They did not see any “No Trespassing” signs. 
For purposes of the motion to dismiss, Wilson’s alleged criminal 
17  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
conduct does not prevent him from challenging the charges under 
the Second Amendment and article I, section 17. 
So we go to Wilson’s article I, section 17 constitutional 
challenge. 
This court eyed article I, section 17 before. See State v.
Mendoza
, 82 Hawaiʻi 143, 920 P.2d 357 (1996). But 
Mendoza
 dodged 
the key question: Does Hawaiʻi’s Constitution afford a personal 
right or a collective right to keep and bear arms? 
Mendoza appealed from his conviction for unlawful firearm 
possession (then an HRS § 134–4(b) (1993) place to keep charge). 
The law violated his right to bear arms under the state and 
federal constitutions, he argued. Id.
 at 144, 920 P.2d at 358. 
After some textual and historical analysis, this court chose not to decide: “it is unnecessary for us to decide whether the framers intended to establish an individual or collective right 
to bear arms under article I, section 17.” Id. at 153, 920 P.2d 
at 367. The Mendoza court upheld the firearms regulation, even “[a]ssuming, without deciding, that article I, section 17 
established an individual right to bear arms.” Id.
Justice Levinson concurred. He concluded that there was no 
individual right. Article I, section 17 covers conduct with a 
“reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a 
well regulated militia.” Id. at 155, 920 P.2d at 369 (Levinson, 
18  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
J., concurring) (cleaned up). Here, we decide the 
constitutional question previously sidestepped. 
Because the text of article I, section 17, its purpose, and 
Hawaiʻi’s historical tradition of weapons regulation support a 
collective, militia meaning, we hold that the Hawaiʻ i 
Constitution does not afford a right to carry firearms in public places for self-defense. 
3. Article I, section 17’s text 
Article I, section 17 reads: 
A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of 
a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. 
Haw. Const. art. I, § 17. 
The Second Amendment is nearly identical. Only two commas 
and three capital letters separate the two. The Second 
Amendment reads: 
A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security 
of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. 
U.S. Const. amend II. 
Since article I, section 17 imitates the Second Amendment, 
it is helpful to look at what the Second Amendment’s words mean. 
A textual approach to constitutional interpretation 
appreciates that words appear (or do not) for a reason. 
Both clauses of article I, section 17 and the Second 
Amendment use military-tinged language – “well regulated 
19  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
militia” and “bear arms” - to limit the use of deadly weapons to 
a military purpose. 
In contrast, there are no words that mention a personal 
right to possess lethal weapons in public places for possible 
self-defense. 
First, we examine the prefatory clause to article I, 
section 17 and the Second Amendment. The opening words carry a 
military meaning. The “well regulated militia” clause warms up the rest, defining the text. It “sets forth the object of the 
Amendment and informs the meaning of the remainder of its text.” 
Heller, 554 U.S. at 643 (Stevens, J., dissenting). 
Article I, section 17’s first clause offers context and 
clarity, like preambles do. “It cannot be presumed that any 
clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect.” 
See Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 174 (1803). 
The federal constitution deploys “militia” to mean an 
irregular state military force that may be called up by the federal government to combat outside invasions or internal 
insurrections. See Silveira v. Lockyer, 312 F.3d 1052, 1070 
(9th Cir. 2002); Paul Finkelman, “A Well Regulated Militia”: The Second Amendment in Historical Perspective, 76 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 
195, 209 (2000). Article I, section 8 gives Congress power to 
“provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of 
the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions,” and to 
20  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia.” 
U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 15-16. Article II makes the 
President of the United States the “Commander in Chief of the 
Army and Navy” and “of the Militia of the several States, when 
called into the actual Service of the United States.” Id. art. 
II, § 2, cl. 1. 
Founding era dictionaries agree. See Thomas Dyche & 
William Pardon, A New General English Dictionary (1765) 
(“Militia: the civil defence of a kingdom, who are cantoned into 
companies, regiments, &c. that are casually raised out of the 
inhabitants upon extraordinary occasions of riots, tumults, 
invasions &c. who, as soon as the disturbance is over, return to 
their respective habitations and employments”); John Ash, The 
New and Complete Dictionary of the English Language (1775) 
(“Militia: the train bands, the standing military force of a 
nation.”). 
To English speakers – in 1791, 1868, and now - the first 
clause narrows the right that the second clause confers. It is “the people” who make up the militia that need to “keep and bear 
arms” to protect “the free state.” 
Centuries ago, the right to keep and bear arms was not 
universal. It wasn’t for all. “The people” who had the right 
to “keep and bear arms” included a discrete subset, one that 
excluded people based on gender and race. Only able-bodied free 
21  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
men could join a militia. See, e.g., Militia Act of 1792, ch. 
33, 1 Stat. 271, 271 (1792) (repealed 1903) (limiting enrollment 
in the militia to every “free able-bodied white male citizen” 
that is over “the age of eighteen years, and under the age of 
forty-five years”). 
Article I, section 17’s second clause also carries an 
“obvious purpose.” United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 178 
(1939). “The term ‘bear arms’ is a familiar idiom; when used 
unadorned by any additional words, its meaning is ‘to serve as a 
soldier, do military service, fight.’” Heller, 554 U.S. at 646 
(Stevens, J., dissenting) (citing 1 Oxford English Dictionary 634 (2d ed. 1989). “Bear arms” is “to serve as a soldier.” 
Webster’s New International Dictionary (2d ed. 1960). 
Before article I, section 17, bear arms had the same 
meaning, going way back. Some textualists champion corpus 
linguistics, “an analysis of how particular combinations of 
words are used in a vast database of English prose.” Facebook,
Inc. v. Duguid, 592 U.S. 395, 412 (2021) (Alito, J., 
concurring). They see it as “an important tool . . . in 
figuring out the meaning of a term.” Wilson v. Safelite Grp.,
Inc., 930 F.3d 429, 442 (6th Cir. 2019) (Thapar, J., concurring). 
Like the first clause’s “well regulated militia,” the 
second clause’s “bear arms” has a collective, military meaning. 
22  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Linguistic experts have churned through historical materials, 
like the Corpus of Founding Era American English and the Corpus 
of Early Modern English, to get to the bottom of the Second 
Amendment’s key words. “Founding-era sources almost always use 
bear arms in an unambiguously military sense.” See Dennis 
Baron, Corpus Evidence Illuminates the Meaning of Bear Arms, 46 Hastings Const. L.Q. 509, 510 (2019). “Non-military uses of 
bear arms in reference to hunting or personal self-defense are not just rare, they are almost nonexistent.” Id. at 510-11; see
also James C. Phillips & Josh Blackman, Corpus Linguistics andHeller, 56 Wake Forest L. Rev. 609, 674, (2021) (“The 
overwhelming majority of bear arms was the ‘collective/militia’ 
sense.”) 
Judges interpret words as part of the job. But judges are 
not language and speech specialists. Before Bruen, linguists 
informed the Supreme Court about their research: “[C]orpus 
linguistics researchers have unearthed a wealth of new evidence over the past decade showing that the phrase ‘keep and bear 
arms’ overwhelmingly had a collective, militaristic meaning at 
the Founding.” See Brief for Corpus Linguistics Professors and 
Experts as Amici Curiae Supporting Respondents at 4, N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n, Inc. v. City of New York, 590 U.S. ____, 
140 S. Ct. 1525 (2020) (No. 18-280). 
23  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
No words in article I, section 17 and the Second Amendment 
describe an individual right. No words mention self-defense. 
“Bear arms” reads the text. “The unmodified use of ‘bear 
arms,’ . . . refers most naturally to a military purpose, as 
evidenced by its use in literally dozens of contemporary texts. 
The absence of any reference to civilian uses of weapons tailors 
the text of the Amendment to the purpose identified in its 
preamble.” Heller, 554 U.S. at 647-48 (Stevens, J., dissenting) 
(footnote omitted). 
The Hawaiʻ i Constitution leaves out an individual right to 
bear arms. Our framers had options. They could have worded the constitution to plainly secure an individual right to possess deadly weapons for self-defense. But they didn’t. The 
Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 did: “the people have a right 
to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state.” Pa. 
Const. of 1776, article XIII (emphasis added). The Vermont 
Constitution, too: “the people have a right to bear arms for the 
defence of themselves and the State.” Vt. Const. ch. 1, art. 16 
(enacted 1777, ch. 1, art. 15). 
The Hawaiʻi Constitution and 44 state constitutions identify 
a right to bear arms. See Mendoza
, 82 Hawaiʻi at 146 n.5, 920 
P.2d at 360 n.5. (counting forty-two other states’ “bear arms” provisions). Two states amended their constitutions post-1996. 
See
 Wis. Const. art. I, § 25 enacted in 1998; Iowa Const. art. 
24  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
I, § 1A, enacted in 2022. 5 states – California, Maryland, 
Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York - do not have a Second 
Amendment counterpart in their constitutions. And besides 
Hawaiʻi, only four state constitutions (Alaska, North Carolina, 
South Carolina, and Virginia) still say “well regulated 
militia.” 
Unlike article I, section 17, nearly all state 
constitutions that recognize a right to keep and bear arms, 
expressly identify it as a civilian right for personal self-
defense. Overwhelmingly, state constitutions use individual-
centric language. They recognize a right to bear arms for “any 
person” or “every citizen.” For instance (1) Maine’s Constitution: “Every citizen has a right to keep and bear arms 
and this right shall never be questioned.” Me. Const. art. I, 
§ 16 (enacted 1987, after a collective rights interpretation of 
the original provision, State v. Friel, 508 A.2d 123 (Me. 
1986)); (2) Connecticut’s Constitution: “Every citizen has a 
right to bear arms in defense of himself and the state.” Conn. 
Const. art. I, § 15 (enacted 1818, art. I, § 17); and (3) Illinois’ Constitution: “Subject only to the police power, the 
right of the individual citizen to keep and bear arms shall not 
be infringed.” Ill. Const. art I, § 22 (enacted 1970). 
25  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
We believe that if article I, section 17 meant to provide 
an individual right to carry deadly weapons in public for self-
defense, then it would say so. 
Until Heller, the Supreme Court had never ruled that the 
Second Amendment afforded an individual right to keep and bear 
arms. Because the Second Amendment provided a collective right, 
most states conferred an individual right through their 
constitutions. Federalism principles allow states to provide broader constitutional protection to their people than the 
federal constitution. See, e.g., Texeira, 50 Haw. at 142 n.2, 
433 P.2d at 597 n.2. 
Hawaiʻi
 chose to 
use civic-minded language. Article I, 
section 17 textually cements the right to bear arms to a well regulated militia. Its words confer a right to “keep and bear 
arms” only in the context of a “well regulated militia.” 
Article I, section 17 traces the language of the Second 
Amendment. 
Those words do not support a right to possess lethal 
weapons in public for possible self-defense. 
4. Article I, section 17’s purpose 
The original public purpose of article I, section 17 (and 
the Second Amendment) also supports a collective, military interpretation. 
This court construes the Hawaiʻi Constitution “with due 
regard to the intent of the framers and the people adopting it, 
26  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and the fundamental principle in interpreting a constitutional 
provision is to give effect to that intent.” Hanabusa v.
Lingle, 105 Hawaiʻ i 28, 31, 93 P.3d 670, 673 (2004).  
We conclude that the authors and ratifiers of the Hawaiʻ i 
Constitution imagined a collective right. Our understanding 
aligns with what the Second Amendment meant in 1950 when Hawaiʻ i 
copied the federal constitution’s language. 
And in 1968 and 
1978 when Hawaiʻ i’s people kept those words.    
Article I, section 17 originated as Proposal Number 3, 
section 15 (Section 15) as introduced in the Constitutional 
Convention of Hawaiʻi of 1950. Debates in Comm. of the Whole on 
Bill of Rights (Article I), 2 
Proceedings of the Constitutional 
Convention of Hawaiʻi of 1950
, at 10 (1961). Legislative history 
shows that the first framers of the Hawaiʻi Constitution had 
concerns about the potential impact that a bear arms provision 
would have on existing firearms registration laws, and the 
state’s ability to pass reasonable laws. The committee reports 
disclose the framer’s intent to allow sensible firearms 
legislation. 
Section 15 incorporates the 2nd Amendment of the Federal 
Constitution. In adopting this language, it was the 
intention of the committee that the language should not be 
construed as to prevent the state legislature from passing 
legislation imposing reasonable restrictions upon the right of the people to keep and bear arms.

Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 20, in 1 Proceedings of the Constitutional 
Convention of Hawaiʻ i of 1950, at 164 (1960). 
The 1950 Constitutional Convention delegates expressed an 
intent to preserve the Territory’s firearms regulations. They 
had foresight, too, reserving the right to later pass laws to 
ban “modern and excessively lethal weapons . . . .” 
This section incorporates the 2nd Amendment to the Federal 
Constitution. Your Committee wishes to make it clear that 
this section will not render invalid the existing laws of the Territory, which will be continued in effect by the 
State Constitution, relating to the registration, 
possession and carrying of firearms, nor will it prevent 
the legislature from passing other reasonable restrictions 
on the right to acquire, keep or bear firearms or other weapons, including the power of the legislature to entirely 
prohibit the possession of such modern and excessively 
lethal weapons as machine guns, silencers, bombs, atomic 
weapons, etc. Upon this understanding, your Committee 
recommends the adoption of this section.  
Comm. of the Whole Rep. No. 5, in 1 Proceedings of the 
Constitutional Convention of Hawaiʻi of 1950
, at 303 (emphases 
added). 
The 1968 Constitutional Convention endorsed the Hawaiʻi 
Constitution’s text and original purpose. The introduction to a 
series of Legislative Reference Bureau studies prepared to aid 
the Convention’s delegates explains that article I, section 17 
was based on the conventional and traditional interpretation of 
the Second Amendment. “The historical background of the Second 
Amendment indicates that the central concern in the right to 
bear arms was the right of the states to maintain a militia.”

Article Summaries (Vol. I), at 7 (1968). The report adds: “The 
right to bear arms refers explicitly to the militia and is 
subject to lawful regulation.” Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 55 in 1 
Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of Hawaiʻi of 1968
, 
at 235 (1973). 
The 1968 Constitutional Convention’s Standing Committee 
recommended retaining then-Section 15. The Committee’s report 
clarified: 
The Committee feels that reference must be made to the 
report of the 1950 Constitutional Convention in order that 
the people of this State not misconstrue the intent of this 
section. The right to bear arms refers explicitly to the 
militia and is subject to lawful regulation. 
Id. 
Ten years later, the 1978 Constitutional Convention Studies 
similarly advised the delegates: “[T]he right to keep and bear 
arms is one enjoyed collectively by members of a state militia” 
rather than an individual right. Hawaiʻi Constitut
ional 
Convention Studies 1978: Introduction and Article Summaries
, at 
6 (1978). The study recounts that the “1968 Constitutional 
Convention, to clear up any confusion left by its predecessor, 
stressed that section 15 referred only to the collective right 
to bear arms as a member of the state militia, but did not amend 
section 15.” Id.
The Hawaiʻ i Constitution’s first framers knew about the 
United States Supreme Court’s decision in Miller, 307 U.S. at 
29  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
183. In 1950, at the prepare-for-statehood Constitutional 
Convention, only 11 years had passed since the unanimous 
decision in Miller. There the Supreme Court concluded that the 
Second Amendment’s purpose was to preserve an effective state 
militia: 
[i]n the absence of any evidence tending to show that 
possession or use of a “shotgun having a barrel of less 
than eighteen inches in length” at this time has some 
reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second 
Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an 
instrument. 
Id. at 178. 
When the Hawaiʻ i Constitution was first ratified, courts 
throughout the nation’s history had always interpreted and 
applied the Second Amendment with the militia-centric view 
expressed in Miller. See, e.g., Cases v. United States, 131 
F.2d 916, 921 (1st Cir. 1942) (“The right to keep and bear arms 
is not a right conferred upon the people by the federal 
constitution.”); United States v. Tot, 131 F.2d 261, 266 (3d 
Cir. 1942) (finding it “abundantly clear” that the Second 
Amendment, unlike freedom of speech and freedom of religion, 
“was not adopted with individual rights in mind, but as a 
protection for the States in the maintenance of their militia 
organizations against possible encroachments by the federal 
power”). 
30  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
This was what everyone thought. A 1969 law dictionary 
explained: the “right to bear arms” refers to the militia, 
“[n]ot a constitutional right to carry weapons on one’s person 
as a civilian.” Right to bear arms, Ballentine’s Law Dictionary 
(3d ed. 1969). 
State and federal courts had also, with few exceptions, 
upheld laws regulating firearms use and possession. 
Article I, section 17 traces the Second Amendment’s 
language. The introductory militia language reveals article I, 
section 17’s purpose - preserve the militia to safeguard the 
security of Hawaiʻ i as a free state.  See Heller, 554 U.S. at 640 
(Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting that the prefatory phrase 
“identifies the preservation of the militia as the Amendment’s 
purpose”). 
Like article I, section 17, the Second Amendment’s original 
purpose protects a state’s right to have a militia. The framers 
included the right to keep and bear arms in the federal 
constitution “in response to their fear that [the] government 
might disarm the militia, not restrict the common law right of self-defense.” Saul Cornell & Nathan DeDino, A Well Regulated
Right: The Early American Origins of Gun Control, 73 Fordham L. 
Rev. 487, 499 (2004). Madison’s writings suggest that the 
Second Amendment originated from fear of a federal government 
power grab. The Second Amendment quelled alarm that the 
31  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
national government might disarm and disband state militias. 
Those militias could “oppose” a federal army, Madison wrote, and 
“would be able to repel the danger” of the federal government. 
The Federalist No. 46, at 301 (James Madison) (Isaac Kramnick 
ed., 1987). 
That’s what they were thinking about long ago. Not someone 
packing a musket to the wigmaker just in case. 
Until recently, the Second Amendment conferred a collective 
right to bear arms in service to the militia. See Miller, 307 
U.S. at 178; Robertson v. Baldwin, 165 U.S. 275, 281-82 (1897). 
There was no individual federal constitutional right to carry 
deadly weapons in public places for self-defense. There were 
only statutory, common law, or state constitutional rights. 
Around Miller’s time, the state militia was evolving into 
the National Guard. A 1903 Act created the National Guard. 
“[T]he regularly enlisted, organized, and uniformed active 
militia in the several States and Territories . . . whether known and designated as National Guard, militia, or otherwise, 
shall constitute the organized militia.” Act of January 21, 
1903, 32 Stat. 775.  Then the National Defense Act of 1916 
federalized the National Guard. Act of June 3, 1916, 39 Stat. 
166.  A 1933 amendment to that act established state National 
Guard units that would simultaneously enlist in the federal 
National Guard.  Act of June 15, 1933, 48 Stat. 153, 159.  While 
32  
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
each state can call upon their unit for emergencies, the federal 
government also retains power to utilize them for national 
defense. See Perpich v. Dep’t of Def., 496 U.S. 334, 351 
(1990). 
The authors of the Hawaiʻi Constitution understood the 
meaning of militia. “Militia” meant “a body of citizens enrolled as a regular military force for periodical instruction, 
discipline, and drill, but not called into active service except 
in emergencies.” 
Webster’s New International Dictionary
 (2d ed. 
1960). By then it included the state National Guard. At the 1968 constitutional convention, delegate Leland Larson 
explained, “Section 15, the so-called ‘right to bear arms’ provision, does not refer to the individual’s right, it refers 
to the militia, to the national guard.” Debates in Comm. of the 
Whole on Bill of Rights (Article I), 2 
Proceedings of the 
Constitutional Convention of Hawaiʻi of 1968
, at 24 (1972); see 
also William L. Shaw, The Interrelationship of the United States
Army and the National Guard, 31 Mil. L. Rev. 39, 44 (1966) 
(noting that “modern-day sense” of term “militia” includes 
“National Guard units”). 
Soon interest groups advanced an individual rights 
interpretation of the Second Amendment. See Carl T. Bogus, The 
History and Politics of Second Amendment Scholarship: A Primer, 
76 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 3 (2000).

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Former Chief Justice Burger called out that movement. It 
was: 
one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word 
‘fraud,’ on the American public by special interest groups 
that I’ve ever seen in my lifetime. The real purpose of 
the Second Amendment was to ensure that state armies  —  the 
militia  —  would be maintained for the defense of the state. 
The very language of the Second Amendment refutes any 
argument that it was intended to guarantee every citizen an 
unfettered right to any kind of weapon he or she desires.  
Silveira v. Lockyer, 312 F.3d 1052, 1063 (9th Cir. 2002) 
(quoting Warren E. Burger, The Right to Bear Arms, PARADE 
MAGAZINE, Jan. 14, 1990, at 4). 
Circuit courts agreed. There was no individual right. 
Same as it ever was. See Love v. Pepersack, 47 F.3d 120, 124 
(4th Cir. 1995) (“Since [Miller], the lower federal courts have uniformly held that the Second Amendment preserves a collective, rather than individual, right.”); Gillespie v. City of 
Indianapolis, 185 F.3d 693, 710 (7th Cir. 1999). In 2001 
though, the Fifth Circuit took a new tact.  See United States v.
Emerson, 270 F.3d 203, 260 (5th Cir. 2001) (finding that the 
Second Amendment “protects individual Americans in their right 
to keep and bear arms whether or not they are a member of a 
select militia”). 
Then, the Supreme Court granted cert in Heller. Heller
flipped the nation’s textual and historical understanding of the Second Amendment. The majority insisted there was “no doubt, on 
the basis of both text and history, that the Second Amendment 
34  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms.” 554 U.S. 
at 595. 
History by historians quickly debunked Heller’s history. 
“If history, and history alone, is what matters, why would the 
Court not now reconsider Heller in light of these more recently 
published historical views?” McDonald, 561 U.S. at 916 (Breyer, 
J., dissenting); United States v. Bullock, ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, 2023 WL 4232309, at *4-*5 (S.D. Miss. 2023) (Reeves, J.) (“[A]n overwhelming majority of historians reject the Supreme Court’s 
most fundamental Second Amendment holding – its 2008 conclusion 
that the Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms, 
rather than a collective, Militia-based right.”) (cleaned up). 
History is prone to misuse. In the Second Amendment cases, 
the Court distorts and cherry-picks historical evidence. It 
shrinks, alters, and discards historical facts that don’t fit. 
See Heller, 554 U.S. at 639 (Stevens, J., dissenting); Bruen, 
597 U.S. at 112 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (“the numerous justifications that the Court finds for rejecting historical 
evidence give judges ample tools to pick their friends out of 
history’s crowd”). 
Bruen unravels durable law. No longer are there the levels 
of scrutiny and public safety balancing tests long-used by our 
nation’s courts to evaluate firearms laws. Instead, the Court 
ad-libs a “history-only” standard. See id. at 84. 
35  
  The Supreme Court makes state and federal courts use a 
fuzzy “history and traditions” test to evaluate laws designed to 
promote public safety. It scraps the traditional techniques 
used by federal and state courts to review laws passed by the 
People to protect people. And by turning the test into history 
and nothing else, it dismantles workable methods to interpret 
firearms laws. All to advance a chosen interpretive modality. 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Yet only a few years before, the Court had constrained 
originalism’s liberty-reducing tendencies. 
The history and 
tradition of the very old days did not control contemporary 
American life. “History and tradition guide and discipline this 
inquiry but do not set its outer boundaries.” Obergefell v.
Hodges, 576 U.S. 644, 664 (2015). 
Judges are not historians. Excavating 18th and 19th 
century experiences to figure out how old times control 21st century life is not a judge’s forte. “Judges are not 
historians. We were not trained as historians. We practiced law, not history.” Bullock, 2023 WL 4232309, at *4. Worse, 
judges may use history to fit their preferred narratives. “[I]n addition to the risk that [judges] will not understand the 
materials they are charged to consult, there is the additional 
risk that they will not conduct a dispassionate examination of 
the historical evidence and will simply marshal historical 
anecdotes to achieve what they have already decided is the 
36  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
preferred outcome.” Darrell A.H. Miller, Text, History, and
Tradition: What the Seventh Amendment Can Teach Us About the 
Second, 122 Yale L.J. 852, 935 (2013). 
History is messy. It’s not straightforward or fair. It’s 
not made by most. See Melissa Murray, Children of Men: The
Roberts Court’s Jurisprudence of Masculinity, 60 Hous. L. Rev. 799, 800 (2023) (the current Court “frequently relies [on] 
moments in which women and people of color were expressly excluded from political participation and deliberation”). 
Bruen, McDonald, Heller, and other cases show how the Court 
handpicks history to make its own rules. See Allegheny Reprod.
Health Ctr. v. Pennsylvania Dep’t of Hum. Servs., ___ A.3d ___, 2024 WL 318389, at *135 (Pa. 2024) (Wecht, J., concurring) (“At

Bruen’s command to find an old-days “analogue” undercuts 
the other branches’ responsibility – at the federal, state, and 
local levels - to preserve public order and solve today’s 
problems. And it downplays human beings’ aptitude for 
technological advancement. 
Time-traveling to 1791 or 1868 to collar how a state 
regulates lethal weapons – per the Constitution’s democratic 
design - is a dangerous way to look at the federal constitution. The Constitution is not a “suicide pact.” Terminiello v.
Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 37 (1949) (Jackson, J., dissenting). 
We believe it is a misplaced view to think that today’s 
public safety laws must look like laws passed long ago. Smoothbore, muzzle-loaded, and powder-and-ramrod muskets were 
not exactly useful to colonial era mass murderers. And life is 
a bit different now, in a nation with a lot more people, 
stretching to islands in the Pacific Ocean. 
Regulations like storing powder safely, reporting with guns 
for militia “musters” (weapons inspection), and loyalty oaths are hardly helpful to address contemporary gun violence. Yet 
those odd laws have historical and traditional roots. 
Democratically-vetted laws, though – measures taken by today’s 
citizens to save lives - are mostly out of bounds. 
Lethal weapons share little resemblance to weaponry used 
centuries ago. A well-trained Revolutionary War soldier could 
38  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
fire his Brown Bess musket three times a minute. See, e.g., 
David S. Lux, Brown Bess, Guns in American Society: A-L 84, 86 
(Gregg Lee Carter ed., 2002) (“An effectively trained soldier 
equipped with [a] smooth-bore musket[] could fire at least three 
rounds per minute on command.”). The Civil War’s muzzle-loading 
rifled muskets in the Civil War were an improvement on 
Revolutionary War weapons, but were still plenty slow and 
difficult to reload. Earl J. Hess, The Rifle Musket in CivilWar Combat: Reality and Myth 4-7 (Univ. of Kansas 2008). 
Presently, a semi-automatic rifle can fire at least 45 rounds a 
minute (and up to 300). See Bevis v. City of Naperville, Ill., 
85 F.4th 1175, 1197 (7th Cir. 2023); Id. at 1224 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Weapons to maximize death differ from those in the 
eras Bruen tells us to review. 
Gun use has changed, too. A backward-looking approach 
ignores today’s realities. “In 2019 for every justifiable 
homicide in the United States involving a gun, guns were used in 30 criminal homicides.” (316 justifiable homicides and 9,610 
criminal homicides.)  This ratio does not take into account 
suicides and fatal unintentional shootings.  See Firearm

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The United States Supreme Court disables the states’ 
responsibility to protect public safety, reduce gun violence, 
and safeguard peaceful public movement. A government by the 
people works. Hawaiʻi’s legislative branch has passed sensible 
firearms laws. And 
Hawaiʻi’s executive branch has enforced those 
laws. The most recent available data from the Centers for Disease Control shows that Hawaiʻ i has the nation’s second-lowest 
rate of gun deaths per year. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics, Firearm Mortality by State (March 1, 2022) (displaying 2021 data)

arm.htm [https://perma.cc/J7HT-7NXH]. 
As the world turns, it makes no sense for contemporary 
society to pledge allegiance to the founding era’s culture, 
realities, laws, and understanding of the Constitution.

5. History and Tradition in Hawaiʻ i 
To be clear, history, though not the end all, is useful. 
See Hawaiʻi State AFL-CIO v. Yoshina
, 84 Hawaiʻi 374, 376, 935 
P.2d 89, 91 (1997) (“[A] constitutional provision must be 
construed in connection with other provisions of the instrument, 
and also in the light of the circumstances under which it was 
40  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
adopted and the history which preceded it.”) (cleaned up). The 
Hawaiʻi Supreme Court values history and tradition to aid 
statutory and constitutional interpretation. Id.But unlike 
the United States Supreme Court, we do not subscribe to an 
interpretive theory that nothing else matters. 
Here, we discuss Hawaiʻ i’s historical tradition of 
regulating weapons. We try our best. Judges are not 
historians. 
(Except the rare case of John Papa ʻ Īʻī, historian 
and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi from 1848-1864.)  Throughout its history as a sovereign 
nation and as a Territory, Hawaiʻ i regulated deadly weapons. 
History bares article I, section 17’s purpose. Never have 
Hawaiʻi’s people felt that carrying deadly weapons during daily 
life is an acceptable or constitutionally protected activity. 
In Hawaiʻ i, a state constitutional right to keep and bear 
arms does not extend to non-militia purposes. 
a. The Kingdom of Hawaiʻ i’s First Law: Ke Kānāwai 
Māmalahoe and the 
promotion of public safety 
“[A] unified monarchial government of the Hawaiian Islands 
was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, the first King of 
Hawaiʻi.” S.J. Res. 19, 103d Cong., 107 Stat. 1510 (1993).  King 
Kamehameha I enacted Hawaiʻ i’s first law: Ke Kānāwai Māmalahoe, 
or “law of the splintered paddle.” See
 Carol Chang, The Law of
the 
Splintered Paddle: Kānāwai Māmalahoe
 14 (1994). 
41  
  
  
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The law reflects Kamehameha’s personal experience: 
Kamehameha and Ka-ha kuʻi paddled to Papaʻi and on to Kea ʻau 
in Puna where some men and women were fishing, and a little 
child sat on the back of one of the men. Seeing them about 
to go away, Kamehameha leaped from his canoe intending to 
catch and kill the men, but they all escaped with the women 
except two men who stayed to protect the man with the child. During the struggle Kamehameha caught his foot in a 
crevice of the rock and was stuck fast; and the fishermen 
beat him over the head with a paddle. Had it not been that 
one of the men was hampered with the child and their 
ignorance that this was Kamehameha with whom they were struggling, Kamehameha would have been killed that day. 
This quarrel was named Ka- lele-iki, and from the striking 
of Kamehameha’s head with a paddle came the law of Mamala-hoe (Broken paddle) for Kamehameha. 
Samuel M. Kamakau, Ruling Chiefs of Hawaiʻ i 125-26 (1961): 
The law of the splintered paddle promotes public safety: 
E nā kānaka,  
E mālama ʻ oukou i ke akua 
A e mālama ho
ʻi i kānaka nui  
a me kānaka iki;  
E hele ka ʻ elemakule, 
ka luahine, a me ke kama 
A moe i ke ala 
ʻaʻohe mea nāna e hoʻ opilikia. 
Hewa nō, make.  
 
O my people, 
Honor thy god; Respect alike (the rights of) men great and humble; 
See to it that our aged, 
our women, and our children Lie down to sleep by the roadside 
Without fear of harm. 
Disobey, and die. 
Chang, The Law of the Splintered Paddle at 16. 
Kamehameha I’s law protects all people, “great and humble.” 
Especially the vulnerable - children and the elderly. The law 
42  
  
 
    
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
imagines free movement without fear. Living without need to 
carry a deadly weapon for self-defense. 
Article IX, section 10 of the 1978 Hawaiʻi Constitution 
codifies Ke Kānāwai Māmalahoe: 
The law of the splintered paddle, [kānāwai māmalahoe], 
decreed by Kamehameha I -- Let every elderly person, woman 
and child lie by the roadside in safety -- shall be a 
unique and living symbol of the State’s concern for public 
safety. 
The State shall have the power to provide for the safety of 
the people from crimes against persons and property. 
Haw. Const. art. IX, § 10. 
Article IX, section 10 provides the people of Hawaiʻ i a 
constitutional right to freely and safely travel in peace and 
tranquility. To animate this constitutional right, the Hawaiʻ i 
Constitution empowers the State to provide for the “safety of 
the people from crimes against persons and property.” 
b. 1833-1893: Weapons were heavily regulated under 
Hawaiian Kingdom Law 
By the time Kamehameha III became King, foreign nations and 
their citizens increasingly exposed the islands to deadly 
weapons. Kamehameha III enacted laws to protect his people from 
crime. In 1833, the King promulgated a law prohibiting “any 
person or persons” on shore from possessing a weapon, including 
any “knife, sword-cane, or any other dangerous weapon.” 
Violators were subject to arrest and punishment by fine or 
lashings. Translation of the Constitution and Laws of the
43  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Hawaiian Islands, Established in the Rein of Kamehameha III 98 
(Lahainaluna, 1842). 
Kamehameha III’s laws severely punished those who committed 
crimes with deadly weapons. Chapter XXXVII outlawed burglary. 
It had a harsh sentencing enhancement: ordinary burglary was 
punished by exile for a period of 3-10 years, but if a burglar 
had a deadly weapon, then it was “a great crime, and the man 
committing it shall be condemned to reside on another land till death.” Id. at 93. Chapter XXXVIII, too. Any murder committed 
by use of a weapon was punishable by death. Id. at 94. 
Kamehameha III enacted Hawaiʻi’s first constitution in 1840. 
Kamakau, 
Ruling Chiefs of Hawaiʻi at 370. 
Kamehameha III and his 
advisors, including the American William Richards, spent years 
deliberating what the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi’s Constitution would 
say. Ralph S. Kuykendall, 
The Hawaiian Kingdom, 1778-1854 159, 
167 (1938). The 1840 Constitution included the United States 
Constitution’s right to freedom of religion. Translation of the
Constitution and Laws at 10 (1842). But it left out its “right 
to bear arms” provision, signaling there was no desire to allow 
the King’s subjects to freely arm themselves. See id. at 9-16. 
Kamehameha III’s government revised the Constitution twelve 
years later. The 1852 Constitution was in many ways modeled on 
the United States Constitution and the Declaration of 
Independence. Article I declared inalienable rights: life, 
44  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
liberty, property, and pursuing safety and happiness. 
Constitution and Laws of His Majesty Kamehameha III, King of the 
Hawaiian Islands, Passed by the Nobles and Representatives at 
Their Session, 1852 3 (1852). Article II enshrined freedom of 
religion. Article III established freedom of the press. And 
article IV decreed, “[a]ll men shall have the right, in an 
orderly and peaceable manner to assemble, without arms, to 
consult upon the common good; give instructions to their Representatives; and to petition the King or the Legislature for 
a redress of grievances.” Id. (emphasis added). The 1852 
Constitution contained no right to keep and bear arms. See id.
And it explicitly conditioned the right of assembly on being 
unarmed. There was no right to carry weapons in public. 
Hawaiʻi has a tradition of updating its weapons laws to 
match changing technology. The Kingdom’s 1852 law, “An Act to 
Prevent the Carrying of Deadly Weapons,” expanded the definition 
of “deadly weapon” to prohibit anyone not authorized by law from 
carrying “any bowie-knife, sword-cane, pistol, air-gun, slung-
shot or other deadly weapon.” Id. at 19. The only people 
allowed to carry arms were Kingdom officials and military 
officers, but only “when worn for legitimate purposes.” Id. 
Kamehameha V adopted a new constitution in 1864. Again, 
the Kingdom of Hawaiʻ i’s Constitution left out a right to bear 
arms. See Haw. Const. of 1864. And again, it protected the 
45  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
right to assemble only “without arms.” Haw. Const. of 1864, 
art. 4. 
A shift in deadly weapons regulation occurred in 1870. 
Concerned that hunters were destroying Oʻ ahu’s bird population, 
the Kingdom enacted a firearm licensing law. Laws of His
Majesty Kamehameha V., King of the Hawaiian Islands, Passed by 
the Legislative Assembly, at its Session, 1870 26 (1870) (“An 
Act to License the Carrying of Fowling Pieces and Other Fire-
arms”). The Minister of Interior could issue hunting licenses 
for the southern part of Oʻ ahu. Without a license, the “use or 
carry” of hunting guns resulted in fines or imprisonment at hard 
labor. Id.
The Kingdom of Hawaiʻi Constitution of 1864 remained in 
effect until 1887. Then, a subversive group forced King 
Kalākaua to sign a new constitution. Queen Liliʻ uokalani 
recalled that they would have executed her brother, King 
Kalākaua, had he not signed the “Bayonet Constitution,” the 
Constitution of 1887. Liliʻuokalani, Hawaiʻi’s Sto
ry by Hawaiʻ i’s 
Queen
 181 (1898). The schemers, mostly American men, omitted a 
right to bear arms. See
 Haw. Const. of 1887; Liliʻuokalani ,

 at 355.  
46  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
c. 1893-1898: The Provisional Government continued 
to heavily regulate weapons 
In 1893, another armed group forcibly deposed Queen 
Liliʻuokalani, who was crowned after King Kalākaua’s death in 
1891. Liliʻ uokalani, Hawaiʻ i’s Story at 209-10, 387. 
“A so-called Committee of Safety, a group of professionals 
and businessmen, with the active assistance of John Stevens, the 
United States Minister to Hawaiʻ i, acting with the United States 
Armed Forces, replaced the monarchy with a provisional 
government.” Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495, 504–05 (2000). 
(100 years later, in 1993, “Congress enacted a joint resolution ‘to acknowledge the historic significance of the illegal 
overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻ i’” and apologize to Native 
Hawaiians. Hawaiʻi v. Office of Hawaiian Affairs, 556 U.S. 163, 
168-69 (2009)). 
After the unlawful overthrow, one of the first things the 
Provisional Government did was end the importation of firearms, 
ammunitions, or explosives. See Laws of the Provisional
Government of the Hawaiian Islands Passed by the Executive and Advisory Councils Acts 1 to 42 13 (Act 9) (1893). 
The next year, the Provisional Government formed the 
“Republic of Hawaiʻ i.” Liliʻ uokalani, Hawaiʻ i’s Story at 258. 
Then, on July 4, 1894, they unveiled a new Constitution. Id.
Again, the right to assemble was only “without arms.” Haw. 
47  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Const. of 1894, art. IV. Again, there was no analogue to the 
Second Amendment. See Haw. Const. of 1894. 
In 1896, the Republic passed a law that prohibited anyone 
from carrying or using a firearm in Hawaiʻ i without a license. 
Laws of the Republic of Hawaiʻ i Passed by the Legislature at its 
Session, 1896 224 (1896). The law also required registration for every firearm in the islands, even those belonging to police or military members. Id. at 224-25. Anyone possessing an 
unlicensed firearm was subject to a fine and forfeiting the gun. Id. at 226. 
d. 1898-1959: The Territorial Government continued 
to heavily regulate weapons 
In 1898, the United States, by joint resolution of 
Congress, annexed the Republic of Hawaiʻ i, creating the Territory 
of Hawaiʻ i. Newlands Resolution, H.R.J. Res. 259, 55th Cong. 
(1898), 30 Stat. 750. 
Though the Hawaiian Islands were now ruled by a subjugating 
nation, Hawaiʻ i continued its historic tradition of strict 
weapons regulation. 
The year before Bruen, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals 
upheld Hawaiʻ i’s regulatory framework for firearms, HRS chapter 
134. Young v. Hawaiʻ i, 992 F.3d 765, 773–75 (9th Cir. 2021).  
Young recounts the history of weapons regulation in Hawaiʻ i 
through much of the 20th century: 
48  
    
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Hawaiʻi’s regulation of dangerous weapons remained in effect 
after Hawaiʻ i consented to annexation as a U.S. territory in 
1898. Under the Newlands Resolution, “[t]he municipal 
legislation of the Hawaiian Islands . . . not inconsistent 
with this joint resolution nor contrary to the Constitution 
of the United States nor to any existing treaty of the 
United States, shall remain in force until the Congress of 
the United States shall otherwise determine.” Resolution 
of July 7, 1898, 30 Stat. 750. See Territory of Hawaiʻ i v. 
Mankichi, 190 U.S. 197, 209, 23 S. Ct. 787, 47 L.Ed. 1016 (1903). Hawaiʻ i’s territorial legislature renewed its 1852 
limitations on the carrying of dangerous weapons in a 1905 
Act, as amended in 1913. Haw. Rev. Laws, ch. 209, § 3089 
(1905), as amended 1913 Haw. Sess. Laws 25, act 22, § 1. 
Like its predecessors, the 1913 statute made it unlawful to 
carry deadly weapons unless “authorized by law.” Id. The 
statute imposed civil and criminal penalties on anyone who carried a “deadly weapon” without prior authorization 
“unless good cause be shown for having such dangerous weapon.” Id. 
In 1927, Hawaiʻ i implemented its first restriction on 
firearms specifically, as opposed to restrictions on the broader class of “deadly weapons.” In a section entitled 
“Carrying or keeping small arms by unlicensed person,” the 
law provided: 
Except as otherwise provided in Sections 7 and 11 hereof in respect of certain licensees, no person 
shall carry, keep, possess or have under his control 
a pistol or revolver; provided, however, that any 
person who shall have lawfully acquired the ownership 
or possession of a pistol or revolver may, for purposes of protection and with or without a license, 
keep the same in the dwelling house or business 
office personally occupied by [them], and, in the 
case of an unlawful attack upon any person or 
property in said house or office, said pistol or revolver may be carried in any lawful, hot pursuit of 
the assailant. 
Act 206, § 5, 1927 Haw. Sess. Laws 209, 209– 211.  The 1927 
Act, which was modeled in part on the Uniform Firearms Act, 
required a person to obtain a license to carry a “pistol or 
revolver concealed upon [their] person or to carry one 
elsewhere than in [their] home or office.” Id. § 7. Carry 
licenses could be issued by the sheriff or a sitting judge after either had determined that applicant was “suitable . . . to be so licensed.” Id. An applicant was 
deemed “suitable” to carry a firearm upon meeting a citizenship and age requirement and showing a “good reason 
to fear an injury to [their] person or property, or . . . 
other proper reason for carrying a pistol or revolver.” 
Id. 
49  
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
     
 
 No doubt. Hawaiʻ i’s historical tradition excludes an 
individual right to possess weapons. Hawaiʻ i prohibited the 
public carry of lethal weapons – with no exceptions for licensed 
weapons – from 1833-1896. Unlicensed public carry of firearms 
has been illegal from 1896 to the present. Hawaiʻ i has never 
recognized a right to carry deadly weapons in public; not as a 
Kingdom, Republic, Territory, or State. 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In 1933, the Hawaiʻ i legislature further refined its 
concealed- carry licensing scheme.  Act 26, § 8, 1933– 1934 
Haw. Sess. Laws Spec. Sess. 35, 39. To carry a concealed 
weapon, the applicant had to demonstrate an “exceptional 
case” and a “good reason to fear injury to [their] person or property.” Id. 
The “exceptional case” and “good reason to fear injury” 
requirements included in the 1933 Act became staples of 
Hawaiʻi’s future firearm regulations. The Hawaiʻ i 
legislature included those requirements in its 1961 Act 
“Relating to Permits to Carry Firearms.” Act 163, 1961 
Haw. Sess. Laws 215. The 1961 regulations mirrored those 
in the 1933 statute and required an applicant to demonstrate an “exceptional case” and a “good reason [for 
the applicant] to fear injury to [their] person or 
property” before publicly carrying a firearm. Id. § 1. 
Whereas the 1933 Act only applied to concealed carry, 
however, the 1961 Act announced a new regulatory scheme for open carry. An individual seeking to carry a firearm 
openly in public was required to demonstrate “the urgency of the need” to carry and must be “engaged in the 
protection of life and property.” Id. If the applicant 
made such a showing and was not otherwise prohibited from 
possessing a firearm, the chief of police had discretion to 
grant the carry application. Id. (“[T]he respective 
chiefs of police may grant a license . . . .”). 
Id. at 774-75. 
e. The Aloha Spirit 
In Hawaiʻ i, the Aloha Spirit inspires constitutional 
interpretation. See Sunoco, 153 Hawaiʻ i at 363, 537 P.3d at 1210 
(Eddins, J., concurring). When this court exercises “power on 
50  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
behalf of the people and in fulfillment of [our] 
responsibilities, obligations, and service to the people” we 
“may contemplate and reside with the life force and give 
consideration to the ‘Aloha Spirit.’” HRS § 5-7.5(b) (2009). 
The spirit of Aloha clashes with a federally-mandated 
lifestyle that lets citizens walk around with deadly weapons 
during day-to-day activities. 
The history of the Hawaiian Islands does not include a 
society where armed people move about the community to possibly combat the deadly aims of others. See Haw. Const. art. IX, § 10 
(“The law of the splintered paddle . . . shall be a unique and living symbol of the State’s concern for public safety.”). 
The government’s interest in reducing firearms violence 
through reasonable weapons regulations has preserved peace and 
tranquility in Hawaiʻ i. A free-wheeling right to carry guns in 
public degrades other constitutional rights. 
The right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, 
encompasses a right to freely and safely move in peace and 
tranquility. See Haw. Const. art. I, § 2; Haw. Const. art. IX, 
§ 10. Laws regulating firearms in public preserve ordered 
liberty and advance these rights. 
There is no individual right to keep and bear arms under 
article I, section 17. So there is no constitutional right to 
carry a firearm in public for possible self-defense. 
51  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
We hold that HRS § 134-25(a) and § 134-27(a) do not violate 
Wilson’s rights under the Hawaiʻ i Constitution. 
C. HRS § 134-25(a) and § 134-27(a) do not violate Wilson’s 
right to bear arms under the Second Amendment 
We also hold that HRS § 134-25(a) and § 134-27(a) do not 
violate the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. 
“[T]he right secured by the Second Amendment is not 
unlimited. . . . [T]he right [is] not a right to keep and carry 
any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.” Bruen, 597 U.S. at 21. States retain the authority 
to require that individuals have a license before carrying firearms in public. Id. at 79-80 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) 
(“[T]he Court’s decision does not prohibit States from imposing licensing requirements for carrying a handgun for self-
defense.”); Antonyuk v. Chiumento, 89 F.4th 271, 312 (2d Cir. 
2023) (“Licensing that includes discretion that is bounded by defined standards, we conclude, is part of this nation’s history 
and tradition of firearm regulation and therefore in compliance 
with the Second Amendment.”). 
HRS § 134-25(a) and § 134-27(a) allow a person to carry a 
handgun for self-defense outside the home if they have a license 
issued per HRS § 134-9. See HRS § 134-25(a) (“Except as
provided in sections 134-5 and 134-9, all firearms shall be confined to the possessor’s place of business, residence, or 
52  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
sojourn” (emphasis added)); HRS § 134-27(a) (restricting the 
possession of ammunition based on HRS § 134-5 and § 134-9). 
HRS § 134-25(a) and § 134-27(a) do not graze Wilson’s 
Second Amendment right. Because he has no standing, Wilson’s 
constitutional challenge to HRS § 134-9, Hawaiʻ i’s licensing law, 
fails. See supra section III.A.2. 
The circuit court erred by dismissing the place to keep 
offenses, HRS § 134-25 and § 134-27. Those laws do not violate 
Wilson’s constitutional rights under article I, section 17 or 
the Second Amendment. 
IV. 
We vacate the circuit court’s Order Granting Defendant’s 
Motion to Dismiss Counts 1 & 2 and remand to the Circuit Court 
of the Second Circuit.
