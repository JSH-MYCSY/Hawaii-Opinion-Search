consortium is cognizable when the parent has not died but has 
entered a persistent vegetative state and will not recover. 
The defendants (GEO Care, Inc.; GEO Care, LLC; Correct 
Care, LLC; and Correct Care Solutions, LLC, dba The Columbia 
Regional Care Center; collectively “GEO Care”) point out that in 
Halberg v. Young, 41 Haw. 634, 642 (Haw. Terr. 1957), this court 
held “no action exists in favor of a child for injuries 
sustained by the parent not resulting in the parent’s 
death.” Consistent with U.S. common law doctrine at that time, 
Halberg held that three minor children’s claims for damages 
arising out of their mother’s injury for “loss of acts of 
kindness, care, attention and other incidents of the parent and 
child relationship” failed to state a claim upon which relief 
could be granted. 41 Haw. at 634, 635, 642. 
The plaintiffs (including Hoku Gec, the adult child of 
Curtis Panoke, the individual now in a persistent vegetative 
state, collectively “plaintiffs” ), however, point out that 
in Masaki v. General Motors Co., 71 Haw. 1, 22, 780 P.2d 566, 
578 (1989), we held that “a parent may recover damages for the 
loss of filial consortium of an injured adult child.” In 
Masaki, an adult was rendered a quadriplegic, and this court 
affirmed his parents’ damage award for loss of filial 
consortium, noting that “severe injury may have just as 
deleterious an impact on filial consortium as death.” Masaki,

71  Haw.  at  4,  19-20,  566  P.2d  at  569,  577.   Masaki  also  
contained  the  following  footnote,  which  left  open  the  issues  we  
address  today:  
In Halberg v. Young, 41 Haw. 634 (1957), we followed the 
traditional common-law rule and held that no cause of 
action exists in favor of a child for injuries sustained by 
his parents. Appellants claim that our decision 
in Halberg is dispositive of the instant case because a 
parent’s claim for the lost consortium of a child is merely 
the reciprocal of a child’s claim for the lost consortium 
of his parents. While we recognize that the two actions 
are analogous in many respects, the issue of parental 
consortium is not before us today. 
Masaki, 71 Haw. at 19 n.8, 566 P.2d at 576 n.8. 
3  The  plaintiffs  also  note  that  the  United  States  District  
Court  for  the  District  of  Hawaiʻi  (“federal  district  court”)  
interpreted  Masaki  to  have  implicitly  overruled  Halberg.   The  
federal  district  court  anticipated  that  this  court  would  
recognize  an  adult  child’s  claim  for  loss  of  parental  consortium  
in  a  case  of  parental  injury.   Marquardt  v.  United  Airlines,  781  
F.  Supp.  1487,  1492  (D.  Haw.  1992)  (“It  is  this  court’s  
considered  judgment  that  if  presented  with  the  facts  present  
here  the  Supreme  Court  of  Hawaii  would  expressly  overrule  
Halberg.   This  court  thus  finds  that  a  cause  of  action  for  loss  
of  parental  consortium  now  exists  under  Hawaii  Law  and  that  [the  
adult  child]  may  maintain  an  action  for  the  loss  of  consortium  
of  her  [injured]  mother.”);  see  also  Mettias  v.  United  States,  
Civ.  No.  12-00527  ACK-KSC,  2015  WL  1931082,  at  *35  (D.  Haw.  Apr.

Based on the reasons discussed below, we now recognize a 
child’s loss of parental consortium claim when a parent is 
severely injured, whether the child is a minor or an adult. 
II. Background 
On February 28, 2019, HELG Administrative Services, LLC (as 
conservator for Curtis Panoke) and Kat ja Gec (as limited 
conservator for Panoke’s minor daughter, K.H.P.G.1) filed a post -
Medical Inquiry and Conciliation Panel (“MICP”) complaint2 
against GEO Care and the State of Hawaiʻi Department of Health; 
Mark A. Fridovich, Ph .D; William P. Sheehan, M.D.; Chiyome L. 
Fukino, M.D.; Linda Rosen, M.D.; and Virginia Pressler, M.D.3 
The complaint alleged as follows: The Columbia Regional Care 
Center is “a 374 -bed private detention healthcare facility for 
individuals not competent to stand trial and found not guilty by 
reason of insanity.” The State of Hawaiʻi Department of Health 
1 During the pendency of the circuit court proceedings, Panoke’s minor 
daughter K.H.P.G. (Katarina Hokulani Panoke Gec, or “Hoku”) reached the age 
of majority and was substituted in as a plaintiff in lieu of Kat ja Gec. 
2 The plaintiffs explained that the y submitted an inquiry to the MICP on 
May 21, 2018 regarding the medical torts alleged in the complaint. They then 
filed what they call their “pre -MICP complaint” in case number 1CC181000825 
on May 24, 2018. The MICP held a proceeding regarding the inquiry on 
November 29, 2018. On January 8, 2019, the MICP issued a written notice of 
termination of the inquiry. Therefore, the plaintiffs filed what they refer 
to as their “post-MICP complaint ” on February 28, 2019 in case number 
1CC191000332. 
The circuit court consolidated the pre -MICP proceedings (1CC18100825) 
and post -MICP proceedings (1CC191000332). 
3 The parties later stipulated to dismiss Fridovich, Sheehan, Fukino, 
Rosen, and Pressler.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(“DOH”) contracted4 with GEO Care to provide care to Panoke 
because Panoke “posed a significant danger to HSH [Hawaiʻi State 
Hospital] patients and HSH staff.” 
Panoke had been charged in 2005 with assault in the second 
degree after attacking an individual at an Aiea homeless 
shelter. Upon his arrest, Panoke was committed to the Kekela 
unit at Queen’s Medical Center for seven weeks, but when his 
level of violence, aggression, and assaultive behavior became 
unmanageable, he was committed to HSH. At a stipulated facts 
trial, the circuit court judge acquitted Panoke of assault in 
the second degree on the ground of physical or mental disease, 
disorder , or defect excluding responsibility. Panoke was 
committed to DOH to be placed in an appropriate institution. 
In 2007, while in DOH custody at HSH, Panoke attacked a 
nurse, fracturing her facial bones. The nurse required 26 
stitches around her left eye. Panoke was then charged with 
assault in the second degree. This time, the circuit court 
found him fit for trial, Panoke pled no contest to the charge, 
The DOH and GEO Care entered into a contract on May 1, 2010 to purchase 
health and human services for Panoke. Under sub -section 7.4 of the “General 
Conditions for Health & Human Services Contracts,” the “rights and duties of 
the parties to this Contract[] shall be governed by the laws of the State of 
Hawaiʻi.” For this reason, we apply Hawaiʻi law to this case. 
We also note that, even absent this provision, under this court’s 
modern choice -of-law jurisprudence, we would “look[] to the state with the 
most significant relationship to the parties and subject matter” to decide 
whether Hawaiʻi law would apply. Mikelson v. United Servs. Auto. Ass’n , 107 
Hawaiʻi 192, 198, 111 P.3d 601, 607 (2005). Due to the choice of law 
provision in the contract, we need not address this determination.

and the circuit court sentenced him to five years of 
incarceration. In 2010, GEO Care accepted Panoke for mental 
health treatment. DOH extended its contract with GEO Care 
multiple times through 2016. 
In March 2016, Panoke expressed a desire to return to 
Hawaiʻi, but the DOH had not planned for him to return. During 
the ensuing months, Panoke and his roommates were involved in 
violent altercations. Panoke’s request to be placed in a single 
room was ignored. On June 8 or 9, 2016, Panoke was attacked by 
his roommates while he slept. The attack left him in a 
persistent vegetative state. 
Count One of the complaint alleged negligence or gross 
negligence as to GEO Care and DOH; Count Two alleged negligent 
infliction of emotional distress ; Count Three alleged negligent 
or grossly negligent hiring, training, supervision, selection, 
and/or retention of defendants’ employees; Count Four alleged 
breach of fiduciary duty. For each count, plaintiffs alleged 
that, as a direct and proximate cause of defendants’ wrongful 
conduct, they “suffered and will continue to suffer pain and 
suffering, mental a nguish, emotional distress, loss of quality 
of life, loss of enjoyment of life, temporary and/or partial 
impairment and/or disability, emotional disfigurement and/or 
scarring, loss of income, economic loss, medical expenses, and 
6    
 
 
   
  
  
  
 
 
 
   
  
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
other expenses. . . .”5 The complaint prayed for general, 
special, and /or punitive damages. 
GEO Care filed its answer on July 17, 2019 and its first 
amended answer on August 1, 2019. Among the affirmative 
defenses set forth in its answer and first amended answer, G EO 
Care included “lack of standing” and that the complaint “fails 
to state a claim against Defendants upon which relief can be 
granted.” 
 On April 13, 2022, GEO Care filed a  motion for summary 
judgment (“MSJ”) as to all of Hoku’s claims for relief.   GEO 
Care first noted that it did not concede that Panoke was, in 
fact, Hoku’s father, and  therefore, alleged Hoku had no standing 
to bring claims relating to Panoke’s  injury.   Moreover, GEO Care 
argued,  “Hawaiʻi does not recognize a cause of action by a child 
for damages arising from a non-fatal personal injury to a parent,” citing Halberg, 41 Haw. 634.   GEO Care quotes Halberg  
as stating that “no action exists in favor of a child for injuries sustained by the parent not resulting in the parent’s 
death.” Halberg, 41 Haw. at 642.  
As such, the loss of parental consortium claims are derivative claims 
stemming from the negligence causes of action asserted by Panoke’s 
conservator against G EO Care and the DOH . The loss of consortium claims are 
not independent causes of action in and of themselves. See, e.g., Mist v. 
Westin Hotels, Inc. , 69 Haw. 192, 199, 738 P.2d 85 , 91 (1987) (“In view of 
the basis upon which the loss of consortium claim arises and the significant 
number of jurisdictions that continue to treat it as derivative, we . . . 
refuse to recognize the loss of consortium claim as a separate and 
independent cause of action and continue to treat it as derivative.”).

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Plaintiffs filed their memorandum in opposition to G EO 
Care’s MSJ on June 29, 2022. Preliminar ily, they submitted two 
exhibits demonstrating that Hoku was Panoke’s biological child. 
They went on to argue that Halberg does not take into account 
the current case’s circumstances, in which a child plaintiff has 
lost all manner of consortium with her father, who has been in a 
persistent vegetative state for six years and will not recover. 
Plaintiffs cited Masaki’s observation that “no meaningful 
distinction can be drawn between death and severe injury where 
the effect on [filial] consortium is concerned.” 71 Haw. at 20, 
780 P.2d at 577. To further support their position, plaintiffs 
pointed to Marquardt , 781 F. Supp. at 1492, in which the federal 
district court interpreted Masaki as having implicitly overruled 
Halberg and predicting that th is court would recognize a child’s 
claim for loss of parental consortium where the parent has been 
injured but not killed. 
In GEO Care’s reply, it counter -argued that Masaki ruled 
narrowly on the parents’ claim for loss of filial consortium and 
did not “directly state, or even suggest” that its ruling 
applied to a child’s claim for loss of parental consortium. GEO 
Care pointed to footnote 8 in Masaki, stating that “the issue of 
parental consortium is not before us today.” 71 Haw. at 19 n.8, 
780 P.2d at 576 n.8.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
On July 7, 2022, the circuit court held a hearing on G EO 
Care’s MSJ. The court indicated it was “going to go out on a 
limb” in denying G EO Care’s MSJ by declining the follow the 
Halberg case. The court’s reasoning was as follows: 
[T]he Court finds persuasive the Hawaii Supreme 
Court’s ruling in Masaki v. General Motors . 
Now, prior to Masaki, similar to this situation, 
neither the legislature nor the Hawaii courts recognized a 
cause of action for loss of filial consortium resulting 
from injury short of death caused by the wrongful conduct 
of another. Masaki recognized, however, that severe injury 
may have just as deleterious an impact on filial consortium 
as death. 
The Supreme Court further held that the cause of 
action was in part based upon intangible elements of love, 
comfort, companionship, and society between child and 
parent rather than the outdated concepts of a child being a 
servant and economic asset to the parent. And that’s 
important because there was a lot of language in Halberg 
regarding this type of child being a servant, economic 
asset, etc. And the Hawaii Supreme Court viewed loss of 
consortium more in these what they call intangible elements 
of love, comfort, companionship, and society. 
Conversely, the reasoning of Masaki, this Court would 
hold, would apply to the loss of parental consortium 
presented in this case. There’s a genuine issue of 
material fact as to Ms. Panoke Gec’s loss of love, comfort, 
companionship, and society as a result of Curtis Panoke’s 
injury and inc apacity. 
While not controlling authority, this recognition of 
a cause of action for parental consortium based upon Masaki 
was the holding of the court in Marquardt v. United 
Airlines . Again, the Court is considering that federal 
court decision as, while not controlling, persuasive 
authority. 
Finally, the Court finds that the Halberg case is 
distinguishable factually from the instant case. While 
Halberg was not explicit about the type of injury suffered 
by the mother in the auto accident, the instant case is a 
case involving catastrophic injury where Mr. Panoke is in a 
vegetative state. Halberg was partly predicated on the 
premise that where a parent has been injured by the 
negligent act of another, the parent will recover from the 
other full damage which he has sustained, including 
inability , if any, to properly care for his children. 
Here Mr. Panoke’s condition and the legalities of the 
conservatorship does not enable him to fully recover 
damages for loss of consortium with regard to the daughter. 
So his cause of action here does not cover what Ms. Panoke 
--Panoke Gec is claiming. 
9    
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
So therefore, the Court will deny the motion for 
summary judgment. 
The circuit court denied G EO Care’s MSJ in an order dated 
September 9, 2022. The circuit court granted G EO Care’s 
application for an interlocutory appeal, G EO Care appealed to 
the ICA, and this appeal was transferred from the ICA to this 
court. 
III. Standard of Review: Summary Judgment 
 On appeal, the grant or denial of  summary judgment is 
reviewed  de novo.   Summary judgment is appropriate if there is 
no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is 
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.   See  Villaver  v.  Sylva,  
145  Hawaiʻi  29,  3 4,  445  P.3d  701,  706  (2019).   
IV. Discussion 
A. The parties’ arguments on appeal 
1. GEO Care’s opening brief 
10  GEO Care’s sole point of error on appeal is that the 
circuit court erred in denying its MSJ.   In its opening brief on 
appeal, GEO Care argues that the circuit court disregarded 
established controlling precedent (Halberg), having not been 
overturned since 1957, and unjustifiably departed from the 
doctrine of stare decisis.   GEO Care argues that any change to 
Hawaiʻi’s laws on consortium ought to be made by the legislature, 
and the legislature has made no changes to Hawaiʻi Revised    
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
  
 
  
  
  
 
 
   6 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Statutes (“HRS”)  § 663-1 (2016) since Halberg.   GEO Care also 
asserts the federal district court misinterpreted Masaki  in 
Marquardt  to predict that this court  would recognize loss of 
parental consortium claims where a parent is injured but still 
alive, because Masaki’s holding should have been limited to 
filial consortium claims.  6 
 Lastly, GEO Care states that a “significant number of 
states refuse to provide children with a cause of action for the loss of parental consortium or parental care resulting from non-
GEO Care cites to HRS § 663 -1, titled “Torts, who may sue and for 
what.” That statute provides the following: 
Except as otherwise provided, all persons residing or being 
in the State shall be personally responsible in damages, 
for trespass or injury, whether direct or consequential, to 
the person or property of others, or to their spouses or 
reciprocal beneficiaries, children under majority, or 
wards, by such offending party, o r the offending party’s 
child under majority, or by the offending party’s command, 
or by the offending party’s animals, domestic or wild; and 
the party aggrieved may prosecute therefore in the proper 
courts. 
HRS § 663 -1 is not the basis of Hoku’s loss of parental consortium claim 
against GEO Care; Hoku brings a common law claim , although HRS § 663 -1 does 
specifically provide for “consequential” damages . See HRS § 1-1 
(2009)(“ Common law of the State; exceptions. The common law of England, as 
ascertained by English and American decisions, is declared to be the common 
law of the State of Hawaii in all cases, except as otherwise expressly 
provided by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or by the laws of 
the State, or fixed by Hawaiian judicial precedent, or esta blished by 
Hawaiian usage [.]”) 
In this case, an adult child’s loss of parental consortium claim arises 
out of “Hawaiian judicial precedent,” similar to our court’s common law 
recognition of a filial consortium cause of action in Masaki, extrapolating 
from HRS § 663 -3 (2016), titled “Death by wrongful act .” See Masaki, 71 Haw. 
at 19, 780 P.2d at 576 (“Loss of filial consortium is a recognized cause of 
action in Hawaii under our wrongful death statute. . . .”). Likewise, loss 
of parental consortium or care is a recognized cause of action under HRS § 
663-3(b)(5)(“Loss of parental care, training, guidance, or education”). 
Thus, contrary to GEO Care’s contention, the expansion of law in this 
area can happen through this court’s development of common law, not primarily 
through legislative action. 
11    
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
fatal injury caused by the alleged wrongful conduct of another,” 
citing 18 cases from other jurisdictions.   GEO Care relies 
heavily upon one such case,  Kershner  v. Beloit Corp., 611 F. 
Supp. 943, 947  (D. Me. 1985), for the following policy reasons 
courts in other jurisdictions have refused to recognize a 
child’s claim of loss of parental consortium where the parent is 
injured but alive:  
(1) the lack of precedent for such a cause of action; (2) 
the uncertainty and remoteness of the damages which would 
flow from such a cause of action; (3) the danger of 
duplication of recovery between the child and parents; (4) 
the unsettling effect that th e creation of such a cause of 
action would have upon a parent’ s settlement negotiations 
with tortfeasors; (5) the increased risk of falsification 
in order to recover under such a cause of action; (6) the 
potential for increased insurance costs; (7) the pot ential 
harm to the integrity and sanctity of the family unit; (8) 
the lack of statutory authority for the creation of such a 
cause of action; and (9) the legal basis of a child’s claim 
to the services of the parent under the substantive law of 
the state in question. 
GEO Care asks this court to vacate or reverse the circuit 
court’s order denying its motion for summary judgment.  
2. Hoku’s answering brief 
In her answering brief, Hoku argues that G EO Care’s 
reliance on Halberg is misplaced because (1) cases since Halberg 
have left open the possibility of recognizing a loss of parental 
consortium claim when a parent is injured but not killed, citing 
Masaki, 71 Haw. 1, 780 P.2d 566, and Marquardt , 781 F. Supp. 
1487; and (2) this court interprets HRS § 663 -3 liberally to 
grant broad remedial relief, citing Lealaimatafao v. Woodward -
Clyde Consultants , 75 Haw. 544, 867 P.2d 220 (1994), and Castro 
12    
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
v. Melchor, 142 Hawaiʻi 1, 414 P.3d 53 (2018)  (plurality).   
Further, Hoku argues that GEO Care’s use of out-of-state cases 
is “irrelevant” to determining the nature and scope of a  loss of 
consortium claim arising under Hawai ʻi  law.   Nevertheless, she 
cites Ueland v. Reynolds Metals Co., 103 Wash. 2d 131, 140, 691 
P.2d 190, 195  (Wash. 1984),  for the proposition that “a child 
has an independent cause of action for loss of the love, care, 
companionship and guidance of a parent tortiously injured by a 
third party.” In Ueland, while acknowledging that some other 
jurisdictions do not recognize such a claim, the Washington 
Supreme Court stated, “We find more persuasive the reasoning 
found in these decisions recognizing the cause of action. . . . 
When justice requires, this court does not hesitate to expand 
the common law and recognize a cause of action.”  Ueland, 103 
Wash. at 135-36, 691 P.2d at 193.  
3. GEO Care’s reply brief 
In its reply brief, G EO Care notes that Hoku does not 
address its argument that the legislature should be the one to 
create a loss of parental consortium claim where a parent is 
injured but still alive. G EO Care also states that Ueland, a 
Washington state case Hoku relies on, is unpersuasive because it 
relies on Washington law regarding consortium.

B. Our precedent 
1. Halberg 
Halberg held that “no action exists in favor of a child for 
injuries sustained by the parent not resulting in the parent’s 
death.” 41 Haw. at 642. In Halberg, a mother was injured in a 
car accident and suit was brought by her husband and minor 
children, for the loss of the mother’s “kindness, care, 
attention and other incidents of the parent and child 
relationship. . . .” 41 Haw. at 634 -35. Although the extent of 
her injuries was unclear, she survived the accident and, unlike 
Panoke, would apparently recover. 41 Haw. at 635, 6 39-40. The 
Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawai‘i held that her children 
could not maintain an action against those who negligently 
injured her because “[t]here is no decision of a Hawaiian court, 
supreme or nisi prius, that holds a minor child has a cause of 
action for injury to his parent and the overwhelming weight of 
authority is against such action.” 41 Haw. at 638 -39. 
The Halberg court acknowledged that the United States Court 
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had, in fact, recognized such a 
claim in Scruggs v. Meredith , 134 F. Supp. 868, 869 -70 (D. Haw . 
1955) (holding that a child whose mother was negligently 
injured, but not killed, had a claim against the wrongdoer for 
loss of consortium because reciprocal rights and duties attached

to the relations of parent and minor child) (citing Gabriel v. 
Margah, 37 Haw. 571, 577 (Haw. Terr. 1947) ). 
In insisting that a child’s loss of parental consortium 
claim would only lie where the parent was killed (not just 
injured), however, the Halberg court stated the following: 
[W]here a parent has been injured by the negligent act of 
another the parent will recover from the other full damage 
which he has sustained, including such inability, if any, 
to properly care for his children, and thus the parent’s 
ability to carry out his duty to support and maintain the 
child has not, in a legal sense, been destroyed or impaired 
by the inj ury to him. On the other hand, if the parent 
were killed, the parent’s ability to support and educate 
the child ceases and the child has been deprived of this 
right and the child would be permitted to recover for such 
loss. 
41 Haw. at 640. In addition to the injured parent’s ability to 
recover “full damage[s]” from the tortfeasor, t he fact of 
eventual physical recovery was also critical to Halberg’s 
holding. The Halberg court rejected the argument “that it is 
merely a difference in degree whether the action is for the 
death of the parent, which deprives the child permanently of 
parental care and support, or whether it is an injury which 
would deprive the child temporarily of such care and support. . 
. .” 41 Haw. at 639 -40 (emphase s added). In other words, the 
Halberg court assumed injury short of death would not 
permanently deprive a child of parental care and support, which 
is not true in all circumstances. The Halberg court concluded 
that if the claim were to be recognized, it should be done by 
the legislature. 41 Haw. at 646.

2. Masaki 
Thirty years later, this court held that “a parent may 
recover damages for the loss of filial consortium of an injured 
adult child.” Masaki, 71 Haw. at 22, 780 P.2d at 578.7 In 
Masaki, 28-year-old Steven Masaki was rendered a quadriplegic 
after the van he was jump -starting shifted into gear and ran him 
over. 71 Haw. at 4, 780 P.2d at 569. His parents sued in 
negligence and included claims for loss of filial consortium. 
Id. A jury returned a verdict in their favor. Id. On appeal, 
the defendants challenged, among other things, the loss of 
filial consortium award where Steven had been injured but not 
killed. 71 Haw. at 19, 780 P.2d at 576. 
The court in Masaki acknowledged that neither the 
legislature nor this court had previously recognized such a 
claim; however, the court held there was little distinction 
between death and severe injury, so the purposes of HRS § 663 -3 
would be served by recognizing the cause of action. 71 Haw. at 
19-20, 780 P.2d at 576 -77. The Masaki court stated that “severe 
injury may have just as deleterious an impact on filial 
consortium as death.” 71 Haw. at 19 -20, 780 P.2d at 577. 
We note that the question on certiorari was framed as “whether there is 
a cause of action available to parents for the loss of consortium of an adult 
child who had been severely and permanently injured due to the defendant’s 
negligence.” Masaki, 71 Haw. at 19, 780 P.2d at 576 (emphases added) . We 
think it is clear from the discussion on loss of filial consortium in Masaki 
that the holding covers “severe” injury. See Masaki, 71 Haw. at 19 -21, 780 
P.2d at 576-78 (using the adjective “severe” to modify “injury” seven times). 
16 7      
 
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Quoting a sister jurisdiction recognizing the claim, this court 
stated, “Often death is separated from severe injury by mere 
fortuity.” 71 Haw. at 20, 780 P.2d at 577 (quoting Frank v. 
Sup. Court, 150 Ariz. 228, 230, 722 P.2d 955, 957-78 (1986)). 
The Frank  court went on to explain  
Perhaps the loss of companionship and society experienced 
by the parents of a child permanently and severely injured 
. . . is in some ways even greater than that suffered by 
parents of a deceased child. Not only has the normal 
family relationship been destr oyed, as when a child dies, 
but the parent also is confronted with his loss each time 
he is with his child and experiences again the child’s 
diminished capacity to give comfort, society, and 
companionship. 
Masaki, 71 Haw. at 20, 780 P.2d at 577 (quoting Frank, 150 Ariz. at 231, 722 P.2d at 958).  
 This court went even further in Masaki  to hold that loss of 
filial consortium should not be limited to parents of severely 
injured minor  children. 71 Haw. at 21, 780 P.2d at 577. The  
limitation  was historically  
premised on the rationale that upon emancipation, parents 
are no longer entitled to the services and earnings of 
their children. We find such reasoning outmoded and 
illogical. At common law, the child, like the wife, was 
relegated to the role of a servan t and considered an 
economic asset to the family. In the modern family, 
however, children have become less of an economic asset and 
more of a financial burden to their parents. Today 
children are valued for their society and companionship. 
Thus, service s have become only one element of the 
consortium action while the intangible elements of love, 
comfort, companionship, and society have emerged as the 
predominant focus of consortium actions. 
Id.  (citations omitted). Thus, the claim for loss of filial 
consortium is cognizable even where the severely injured person 
is an adult  child. Id.   The Masaki  court recognized the 
17    
 
 
   
  
  
  
 
  
    
  
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
changing nature of consortium between parents and children as 
one “arising from the very bonds of the family relationship.” 
Id. (citation omitted). 
GEO Care clings to footnote 8 in Masaki to argue that the 
law on parental consortium has not change d. Masaki, 71 Haw. at 
19 n.8, 780 P.2d at 576 n.8 ( “[T]he issue of parental consortium 
is not before us today.” ). This language , however, neither 
expressly overrules nor affirms Halberg. Id. Rather, it leaves 
the door open for future courts , such as this one, to revisit 
parental consortium claims in non -fatal injury cases. That day 
has come. 
We now expressly overrule Halberg to the extent it held 
that a child cannot claim loss of parental consortium where a 
parent is severely injured but not killed. This court does not 
lightly overrule precedent. Th e doctrine of stare decisis is a 
“principle of self -restraint on courts with respect to the 
overruling of prior decisions.” Robinson v. Ariyoshi , 65 Haw. 
641, 653 n.10, 658 P.2d 287, 297 n.10 (1982) (citation omitted). 
We apply this doctrine with a view toward 
the desirability that the law furnish a clear guide for the 
conduct of individuals, to enable them to plan their 
affairs with assurance against untoward surprise; the 
importance of furthering fair and expeditious adjudication 
by elminating the need to relitigate every relevant 
proposition in every case; and the n ecessity of maintaining 
public faith in the judiciary as a source of impersonal and 
reasoned judgments.

Id. A court should “not depart from the doctrine of stare 
decisis without some compelling justification.” Ahn v. Liberty 
Mut. Fire Ins. Co. , 126 Hawaiʻi 1, 10, 265 P.3d 470, 479 (2011). 
Stated differently, a court “should not overrule its earlier 
decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable logic 
require it.” Id. (citation omitted). 
C. The modern trend 
In this case, the law on parental consortium nationwide has 
undergone dramatic change since Halberg was decided almost sixty 
years ago. S ignificantly more states now recognize the claim 
that Halberg stated did not exist . The Restatement (Third) of 
Torts: Concluding Provisions (AM L. INST., Tentative Draft No. 1, 
20228) contains a new claim, albeit limited to minor children, in 
section 48C titled “Loss of Parental Consortium”: 
A minor child of a parent who suffers physical or emotional 
harm, factually caused by the tortious conduct of an actor 
and within the actor’s scope of liability, may recover for 
the loss of society resulting from the parent’s injury. 
Loss of society inclu des loss of affection, comfort, 
companionship, love, and support, and the loss of services. 
The precursor to this section, the Restatement (Second) of 
Torts § 707A, completely denied recovery for loss of parental 
consortium when it was approved in 1977. Restatement (Third) of 
Torts: Concluding Provisions § 48C cmt. a. The Restatement

(Third) of Torts commentators explained, however, that since 
1977, “there has been a clear and substantial trend toward 
recognizing parental consortium.” Id.   According to the 
commentators, “Today, at least 19 states have case law and two have statutes permitting parental consortium claims. With three 
states that have not decided the issue, a bare majority of 
states does not recognize parental consortium claims.” 
Restatement (Third) of Torts: Concluding Provisions § 48C cmt. 
b.   The commentators noted that 
Hawaiʻi was not counted among 
those states permitting parental consortium claims, although it 
acknowledged the federal district court’s Marquardt  decision. 
Restatement (Third) of Torts: Concluding Provisions  § 48C cmt. 
b, Reporters’ Note.  
We now expressly add our state to those permitting parental 
consortium claims and hold that loss of parental consortium is 
cognizable for a child, whether a minor or an adult, when a 
parent is severely injured. 
Masaki characterized as “outmoded and illogical” the idea 
that children’s (particularly minor children’s) value lay solely 
in their role as servants to their parents: 
We realize that a number of courts which recognize the 
parents’ cause of action for loss of consortium of their 
injured children restrict the action to minor children. 
This rule is generally premised on the rationale that upon 
emancipation, parents are no longer entitled to the 
services and earnings of their children. We find such 
reasoning outmoded and illogical. At common law, the 
child, like the wife, was relegated to the role of a 
servant and considered an economic asset to the family. In 
20    
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the modern family, however, children have become less of an 
economic asset and more of a financial burden to their 
parents. Today children are valued for their society and 
companionship. Thus, services have become only one element 
of the consortium actio n while the intangible elements of 
love, comfort, companionship, and society have emerged as 
the predominant focus of consortium actions. 
71 Haw. at 21, 780 P.2d at 577.   Stare decisis does not require 
courts to cling stubbornly to the past. See  Ahn, 126 Hawaiʻi at 
10, 265 P.3d at 469 (“There is no necessity or sound legal 
reason to perpetuate an error under the doctrine of stare 
decisis.”) (cleaned up). Masaki’s footnote 8, reserving for 
another day the “reciprocal” issue of loss of parental 
consortium, must be read in concert with this passage, signaling 
that Halberg’s days were numbered.  
The passage above from Masaki also signaled this court’s 
view that children in general, whether minor or adult, are 
valued by their parents --for their love, comfort, 
companionship, and society --and the reciprocal could be true 
as well. Thus, we now hold that a child, whether a minor or an 
adult, may bring a loss of parental consortium claim for severe 
injury to a parent. The Restatement (Third) of Torts : 
Concluding Provisions § 48C recognizes a “split on whether an 
adult child [versus a minor child] can pursue a parental 
consortium claim.” Restatement (Third) of Torts : Concluding 
Provisions § 48C cmt. g. We find it persuasive, however, that 
multiple states recognize an adult child’s claim for loss of 
21

parental consortium where a parent is tortiously injured by a 
third party. See  N.  Pac. Ins. Co. v. Stucky, 338 P.3d 56, 57-58  
(2014) (“Montana law recognizes a claim for loss of consortium 
by the adult child of an injured parent” where the plaintiff 
shows that “a third party tortiously caused the parent to suffer 
a serious, permanent and disabling mental or physical injury 
compensable under Montana law” and “the impairment is so 
overwhelming and severe that it has caused the parent-child 
relationship to be  destroyed or nearly destroyed”); Rolf v. Tri-
State Motor Trans. Co., 745 N.E.2d 424, 428  (Ohio 2001) (holding 
that “adult emancipated children may recover for loss of 
parental consortium” where father “suffered a traumatic brain 
injury, is physically and mentally impaired, and will require 
custodial care for the remainder of his life”); Sebastien v. 
McKay, 649 So.2d 711 (La. Ct. App. 1994) (allowing loss of 
parental consortium claims made by adult children when their 
father required constant care due to his temporarily but significantly weakened condition due to father’s doctor’s 
negligence in  failing to remove a broken tube in father’s back 
post-surgery); Reagan v. Vaughan, 804 S.W.2d 463, 466, 467  (Tex. 
1990) (“We hold that children may recover for loss of consortium 
when a third party causes serious, permanent, and disabling 
injuries to their parent,” and “decline to limit the right of 
recovery under this cause of action to minor children”);

Audubon-Exira Ready Mix, Inc. v. Ill.  Cent. Gulf R.R.  Co., 335 
N.W.2d 148 (Iowa 1983) (holding that adult and married children 
may raise loss of parental consortium claims when a parent is 
injured); see  also  Nelson v. Four Seasons Nursing Ctr., 934 P.2d 
1104, 1105  (Okla. Civ.  App. 1996) (holding, in a case in which 
plaintiff’s father disappeared while under defendant nursing 
home’s care, “In cases where the parent-child relationship is 
destroyed or nearly destroyed by the tort of the defendant, the 
affected  children, both minors and adults alike, should be 
allowed to maintain a cause of action for loss of parental consortium.”). We now join those jurisdictions in recognizing a 
child’s claim for loss of parental consortium where a third 
party has severely injured a parent, whether the child is a 
minor or an adult.  
V. Conclusion 
Hence, we recognize Hoku’s claim for loss of parental 
consortium. Therefore, the circuit court’s order denying GEO 
Care’s motion for summary judgment is affirmed. This case is
