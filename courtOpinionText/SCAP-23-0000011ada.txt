OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J.  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
I. 
This case concerns Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) Rule 4(a)(3). 
We address appellate jurisdiction when a court does not 
enter an order on a post-judgment motion within 90 days and the 
court’s clerk does not provide notice “within 5 days after the 
90th day” that the motion has been denied by operation of the 
rule. 
Per HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) an order entered after 90 days “shall 
be a nullity.” 
We hold that if the court clerk does not timely 
notify the parties that a post-judgment motion has been automatically denied, the start-time to appeal begins when the clerk provides notice to the parties or the court enters a 
nullified order. 
II. 
In May 2015, Schuyler and Marilyn Cole filed a notice of 
appeal to the Tax Appeal Court (TAC). The Coles contested the City and County of Honolulu’s (City) classification of several 
investment properties they owned. That classification resulted in property tax assessments they disliked. The City opposed 
their challenge. 
In July 2016, the Tax Appeal Court approved a stipulation 
to consolidate the Coles’ appeal with 40 similar appeals. Those 
2  
 
 
 
   
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
appeals also contested the City’s classification.   The court 
designated the Coles’ appeal as the lead case (collectively, we 
call the plaintiffs “the Taxpayers”). 
On July 17, 2017, Tax Appeal Court Judge Gary W.B. Chang 
entered an order granting summary judgment to the City. That 
day the court also entered final judgment. On July 26, 2017, 
the Taxpayers timely moved for reconsideration. The City 
opposed the motion; the Taxpayers replied. 
The court did not rule on the Taxpayer’s motion for 
reconsideration within 90 days of its filing. Neither an order disposing of the motion, nor a clerk’s notice that the motion 
had been automatically denied per HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) were filed. 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) (2016) reads: 
(3) TIME TO APPEAL AFFECTED BY POST- JUDGMENT MOTIONS.  If 
any party files a timely motion for judgment as a matter of 
law, to amend findings or make additional findings, for a 
new trial, to reconsider, alter or amend the judgment or 
order, or for attorney’s fees or costs, and court or agency rules specify the time by which the motion shall be filed, 
then the time for filing the notice of appeal is extended 
for all parties until 30 days after entry of an order 
disposing of the motion. The presiding court or agency in 
which the motion was filed shall dispose of any such post-judgment motion by entering an order upon the record within 
90 days after the date the motion was filed. If the court 
or agency fails to enter an order on the record, then, 
within 5 days after the 90th day, the clerk of the relevant 
court or agency shall notify the parties that, by operation of this Rule, the post- judgment motion is denied and that 
any orders entered thereafter shall be a nullity. The time of appeal shall run from the date of entry of the court or 
agency’s order disposing of the post- judgment motion, if 
the order is entered within the 90 days, or from the filing 
date of the clerk’s notice to the parties that the post-
judgment motion is denied pursuant to the operation of the 
Rule.

Time passed. 
In December 2022, the court received a letter from the 
Taxpayers. They wanted the court to rule on their motion for reconsideration. The Taxpayers explained: “(i) the Court had 
not entered an order disposing of the Motion for 
Reconsideration; and (ii) that the Clerk of Courts had not 
otherwise disposed of the Motion for Reconsideration as required 
by Rule 4(a)(3) of the [HRAP].” 
Three days later, the court entered an order denying the 
Taxpayers’ 2017 motion for reconsideration. 
Within 30 days, the Coles and 13 taxpayers appealed the 
2017 order granting the City’s motion for summary judgment. 
The City applied for transfer. We accepted the transfer to 
address one issue - appellate jurisdiction. 
III. 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) controls the time frame to appeal when a 
party files a post-judgment motion. 
The rule’s current version dates to 2016. Sakuma prompted 
that year’s revision. See Ass’n of Condo. Homeowners of Tropics
at Waikele v. Sakuma
, 131 Hawaiʻi 254, 318 P.3d 94 (2013). 
There, the circuit court entered a default judgment and foreclosure decree. 
Id.
 at 255, 318 P.3d at 95. Sakuma timely 
moved for reconsideration. Id.The circuit court failed to 
4  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
rule on her post-judgment motion within 90 days. Id.Almost 
five months after filing the motion, she appealed. The 
Intermediate Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal. It was too 
late. The appellate courts lacked jurisdiction. Sakuma applied 
for cert, and we accepted. 
At the time, HRAP Rule 4(a) (2012) read in part: 
(1) TIME AND PLACE OF FILING. When a civil appeal is 
permitted by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed 
within 30 days after entry of the judgment or appealable 
order. 
  . . .. 
(3)
 TIME TO APPEAL AFFECTED BY POST- JUDGMENT MOTIONS.  If 
any party files a timely motion for judgment as a matter of 
law, to amend findings or make additional findings, for a new trial, to reconsider, alter or amend the judgment or 
order, or for attorney’s fees or costs, the time for filing 
the notice of appeal is extended until 30 days after entry 
of an order disposing of the motion; provided, that the failure to dispose of any motion by order entered upon the record within 90 days after the date the motion was filed 
shall constitute a denial of the motion. 
(Emphasis added.) 
This court sided with Sakuma. We held that after 90 days, 
the clock did not start for HRAP Rule 4(a)(1)’s “within 30 days 
after entry of the judgment” appeal deadline. Id. at 256, 318 
P.3d at 96. Why? Rule 4(a)(3)’s clear language. It tolled the 
appeal deadline until the “entry of an order” that disposes of 
the motion for reconsideration. Id. Thus, the thirty-day clock 
for filing a notice of appeal starts with the court’s order, not 
when the post-judgment motion is deemed denied. Id.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Before long, HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) was revised. Here it is in 
Ramseyer format (compared to the 2012 version): 
If any party files a timely motion for judgment as a matter 
of law, to amend findings or make additional findings, for 
a new trial, to reconsider, alter or amend the judgment or order, or for attorney’s fees or costs, and court or agency 
rules specify the time by which the motion shall be filed, 
then the time for filing the notice of appeal is extended 
for all parties until 30 days after entry of an order 
disposing of the motion. [; provided, that the failure] The 
presiding court or agency in which the motion was filed shall [to] dispose of any such post- judgment motion by 
entering an order [entered] upon the record within 90 days 
after the date the motion was filed [shall constitute a 
denial of the motion]. 
 
The 2016 amendment altered the part stating “provided, that 
the failure to dispose of any motion by order entered upon the 
record within 90 days after the date the motion was filed shall 
constitute a denial of the motion.” Now it read: “The presiding 
court or agency in which the motion was filed shall dispose of any such post-judgment motion by entering an order upon the 
record within 90 days after the date the motion was filed.” 
The revision also added two lengthy sentences to Rule 
4(a)(3): 
If the court or agency fails to enter an order on the 
record, then, within 5 days after the 90th day, the clerk 
of the relevant court or agency shall notify the parties 
that, by operation of this Rule, the post- judgment motion 
is denied and that any orders entered thereafter shall be a 
nullity. The time of appeal shall run from the date of 
entry of the court or agency’s order disposing of the post-
judgment motion, if the order is entered within the 90 
days, or from the filing date of the clerk’s notice to the parties that the post- judgment motion is denied pursuant to 
the operation of the Rule. 
We again assess HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). 
6  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
To start, Rule 4(a)(3)’s first two clauses are plain. The 
first clause describes the general rule that a party must file a 
notice of appeal within 30 days after entry of an order on a 
post-judgment motion. The second clause requires the court to 
enter that post-judgment order within 90 days after the party 
files the motion. 
The third clause addresses the situation where the court 
fails to enter an order by the 90th day. After the 90th day the Rule instructs the court’s clerk to do something about the 
court’s inaction: notify the parties before the 95th day that “by 
operation of this Rule, the post-judgment motion is denied and 
that any orders entered thereafter shall be a nullity.” 
The Rule’s “shall” directive imposes a duty on the clerk. 
The clerk should notify the parties, within 5 days, about the 
denial of the post-judgment motion. 
The fourth clauses specifically address the two start times 
to file a notice of appeal. First, “if the order is entered within the 90 days,” then the start time to appeal runs from the 
date of entry of the court or agency’s order [e.g., if the court 
enters an order regarding a post-judgment motion on the 70th 
day, then the appeal is due in 30 days, 100th day from final 
judgment]. 
7  
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The second start time occurs when the court fails to enter 
an order disposing of the post-judgment motion within 90 days. 
Rule 4(a)(3) presumes that the clerk will provide notice to the 
parties within 5 days informing them that the post-judgment 
motion is automatically denied. This “filing date of the 
clerk’s notice” then sets the start time for appeal [e.g., if 
the clerk files notice on the 93rd day, then the appeal is due 
in 30 days, 123 days from final judgment]. 
Here, the court entered no order. And the court’s clerk 
gave no notice. 
Rule 4(a)(3) does not contemplate what happens when there’s 
no order and no notice by day 95. A situation, we believe, that is apt to repeat. If the court overlooks a deadline to rule on 
a post-judgment motion, then the clerk may overlook it too. 
When both the court and the court’s clerk overlook the 90-day 
post-judgment order deadline, the clerk may not generate a 
deemed denied notice “within 5 days after the 90th day.” (A clerk who knows about a looming deadline would presumably alert 
the court before the 90 days are up – and later not forget to 
file a notice within five days should the court not enter an 
order.) The reality of court and clerk connectivity and day-to-
day judicial administration may very well be that if the court 
8  
 
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
forgets, the court’s clerk forgets. And if the clerk forgets, 
the court forgets. Either way, there’s no order and no notice. 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(3)’s words are clear. To protect the right 
to appeal, we conclude that the appeal deadline tolls until the 
“entry of an order disposing of the motion.” We said it before. 
“[W]hen a timely post-judgment tolling motion is deemed denied, 
it does not trigger the thirty-day deadline for filing a notice 
of appeal until entry of the judgment or appealable order 
pursuant to HRAP Rules 4(a)(1) and 4(a)(3).” Sakuma, 131 Hawaiʻ i 
at 256, 318 P.3d at 96. 
The 2016 revision to Rule 4(a)(3) added a clerk’s notice 
requirement. The Taxpayers did not receive that notice. 
Notice is a core feature of due process. See LaChance v.
Erickson, 522 U.S. 262, 266 (1998). So is the right to appeal. See, e.g., State v. Uchima
, 147 Hawaiʻi 64, 69, 464 P.3d 852, 857 
(2020). 
We conclude that a court’s failure to comply with HRAP Rule 
4(a)(3) does not undercut a party’s right to appeal. 
Judicial 
inaction cannot operate to foreclose a right to appeal. 
Here, the court issued an order on the Taxpayers’ motion 
for reconsideration. Five years too late. Under Rule 4(a)(3)’s 
third clause, that order is a nullity. Courts have no power to 
rule on a post-judgment motion after the 90-day period. 
9  
 
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The court’s belated action, though, provides notice 
regarding the time to appeal. Per Rule 4(a)(3), the Taxpayers’ 
appeal clock finally started ticking. And they appealed within 
30 days. So the ICA has jurisdiction. 
IV. 
Post-
Sakuma, the Standing Committee to Review the Hawaiʻ i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure proposed an amended rule, and this court adopted it. HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) reveals an objective to 
impose finality and a definite appellate deadline. The rule 
nullifies an order entered 90 days after a post-judgment motion. 
And it tells the clerk to provide notice to the parties that the 
motion has been deemed denied. 
But as this case shows, a blind spot exists. One that 
impedes finality and unbounds the time frame for appellate jurisdiction. Without an order or notice, the appeal deadline 
extends indefinitely. 
Sure, the litigants share fault by not alerting the court 
about an outstanding matter. But HRAP Rule 4(a)(3)’s design 
ignores judicial inaction. The Taxpayers followed the rule’s language to file an appeal. They get their day in appellate 
court. 
We believe that a sound rule does not permit an appellant 
to revive a case decided (final judgment-wise) years before. An

ideal rule promotes finality and sets an easy-to-understand 
notice of appeal deadline. The Standing Committee to Review the 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure may wish to consider 
proposing an amendment to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). 
V. 
We hold that the Intermediate Court of Appeals has 
jurisdiction over the Taxpayers’ appeal. We remand to the ICA 
for further proceedings.
