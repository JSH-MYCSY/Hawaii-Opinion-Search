vs. 
 
MICHAEL ELEFANTE, 
Defendant-Appellee. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CAAP-23-0000053; CASE NO. 2CPC-22-0000261) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, and Eddins, JJ., Circuit Judge Tonaki 
and Circuit Judge Morikawa, assigned by reason of vacancies)  
On May 12, 2020, Michael Elefante checked himself into the 
hospital. A nurse inventoried his belongings. Inside his 
backpack, she found a loaded pistol. The hospital called the 
police. 
Elefante lacked a license to carry a weapon pursuant to 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 134-9 (2011).  
On April 12, 2022, the County of Maui Department of the 
Prosecuting Attorney charged Elefante with one “place to keep”  
 
   
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
offense in violation of HRS § 134-25 (2011). 
In September 2022, Elefante moved to dismiss. He 
maintained that the Second Amendment to the United States 
Constitution, as newly imagined by New York State Rifle & Pistol 
Ass’n v. Bruen, 597 U.S. 1 (2022), provided a right to bear arms 
in public for possible self-defense. Article I, section 17 of 
the Hawaiʻ i Constitution, too, he claimed. 
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit Judge Kelsey T. Kawano 
agreed with Elefante, dismissing his case. 
The State appealed. It said Elefante lacked standing to 
challenge the constitutionality of HRS § 134-9 – Hawaiʻ i’s 
license to carry law - because he didn’t bother to ask for a 
license. 
In October 2023, Elefante applied for transfer to this 
court. He said the case raises “essentially the same issues” as State v. Wilson, then pending before us. Now decided. State v.
Wilson, ___ P.3d ___, 2024 WL 466105 (Haw. 2024). 
We granted transfer. 
We resolve this case the same way as Wilson. There, the 
defendant chose not to seek a license to carry, so he lacked 
standing to challenge Hawaiʻi’s license-to-carry law, HRS § 134-
9. Id. at *4. Like Wilson, Elefante did not try to get a 
license. Therefore, he lacks standing to challenge HRS § 134-9. 
Elefante has standing to challenge the law he was charged

with violating, HRS § 134-25. See id. at *3. Wilson examined 
whether HRS § 134-25 conforms to article I, section 17 of the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution.  This court concluded that article I, 
section 17 confers a collective, militia-based right to bear 
arms. Id. at *7. Not an individual right to carry weapons in 
public for possible self-defense. Id.Thus, HRS § 134-25 does 
not violate the Hawaiʻ i Constitution. 
Wilson also held that HRS § 134-25 does not violate the 
Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. Id. at *20. 
Under Bruen, “[s]tates retain the authority to require that individuals have a license before carrying firearms in public.” 
Id.; Bruen, 597 U.S. at 79-80 (Kavanaugh, J. concurring). 
That’s what HRS § 134-25 does. 
Accordingly, we conclude that HRS § 134-25 does not violate 
Elefante’s rights under the Hawaiʻ i or U.S. Constitutions. We 
hold that the circuit court erred by granting Elefante’s motion to dismiss. We vacate the circuit court’s order and remand the 
case for further proceedings. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, March 8, 2024.
