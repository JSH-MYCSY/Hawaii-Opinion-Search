OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J. 1
This case centers on whether the statute regarding 
continuous sexual assault of a minor under the age of fourteen 
years, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-733.6 (2014), and a 
1 Circuit Judge Jeffrey P. Crabtree, who was a member of the Court, 
assigned by reason of vacancy, retired from the bench on January 31, 2024.  
 
 
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
related provision of the Hawai‘ i Constitution, article I, 
section 25, comport with the U.S. Constitution. For the reasons 
stated below, we conclude that they do. We further conclude 
that the indictment against defendant Alvin Tran, charging a 
violation of HRS § 707-733.6, was sufficiently specific when 
construed under the liberal construction standard announced in State v. Motta
, 66 Haw. 89, 657 P.2d 1019 (1983), and modified 
by State v. Wells, 78 
Hawai‘i 373, 894 P.2d 70 (1995). 
  Accordingly, we (1) vacate the circuit court’s order 
granting in part and denying in part Tran’s motion to dismiss; (2) affirm the circuit court’s denial of Tran’s supplemented new 
trial motion; and (3) remand the case to the circuit court for 
further proceedings. 
I. BACKGROUND 
In July 2020, a grand jury returned a single-count 
indictment against Tran as follows: 
On or about January 1, 2015 to and including January 
31, 2020, in the City and County of Honolulu, State of 
Hawai‘i, ALVIN TRAN, a person who either resided in the same 
home with [minor child], a minor under the age of fourteen 
years, or had recurring access to [minor child], with intent or knowledge that [minor child] was such a person, 
did intentionally or knowingly engage in three or more acts 
of sexual penetration and/or sexual contact with [minor 
child] over a period of time, while [minor child] was under 
the age of fourteen years, and was not married to [minor child], and knew he was not married to [minor child], 
thereby committing the offense of Continuous Sexual Assault

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
of a Minor Under the Age of Fourteen Years, in violation of 
Section 707- 733.6 of the [HRS].[2] 
Pursuant to Section 707- 700 of the [HRS (2014)], 
“married” includes persons legally married, and a male and 
female living together as husband and wife, but does not 
include spouses living apart. 
Pursuant to Section 707- 700 of the [HRS], “sexual 
penetration” means: 
(1) Vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, 
fellatio, deviate sexual intercourse, or any intrusion of any part of a person’s body or of 
any object into the genital or anal opening of 
another person’s body; it occurs upon any 
penetration, however slight, but emission is 
not required. As used in this definition, 
2 HRS § 707-733.6 (2014) states: 
(1) A person commits the offense of continuous sexual 
assault of a minor under the age of fourteen years if the person: 
(a) Either resides in the same home with a minor under the age of fourteen years or has recurring access to the minor; and 
(b) Engages in three or more acts of sexual 
penetration or sexual contact with the minor over 
a period of time, while the minor is under the age of fourteen years. 
(2) To convict under this section, the trier of fact, if a 
jury, need unanimously agree only that the requisite number of acts have occurred; the jury need not agree on which acts constitute the requisite number. 
(3) No other felony sex offense involving the same victim 
may be charged in the same proceeding with a charge under 
this section, unless the other charged offense occurred outside the period of the offense charged under this 
section, or the other offense is charged in the 
alternative. A defendant may be charged with only one count 
under this section, unless more than one victim is 
involved, in which case a separate count may be charged for each victim. 
(4) Continuous sexual assault of a minor under the age of 
fourteen years is a class A felony. 
(Emphasis added.) 
3  
 
 
  
 
   
        
 
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“genital opening” includes the anterior surface 
of the vulva or labia majora; or 
(2) Cunnilingus or anilingus, whether or not actual 
penetration has occurred. 
Pursuant to Section 707- 700 of the [HRS], “deviate 
sexual intercourse” means any act of sexual gratification 
between a person and an animal or a corpse, involving the 
sex organs of one and the mouth, anus or sex organs of the other. 
 
Pursuant to Section 707- 700 of the [HRS], “sexual 
contact” means any touching, other than acts of “sexual penetration”, of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person not married to the actor, or of the sexual or other 
intimate parts of the actor by the person, whether directly 
or through the clothing or other material intended to cover 
the sexual or other intimate parts.  
  During trial in April 2022, the State presented 
testimony from (1) minor child, (2) minor child’s mother, 
(3) minor child’s father, (4) a pediatrician who interviewed 
minor child, (5) a clinical psychologist, (6) a Honolulu Police Department (HPD) evidence specialist, (7) a homeland security 
special agent, and (8) an HPD detective with the sex crimes 
detail. Tran presented testimony from (1) a sex assault nurse 
examiner, (2) Tran’s brother, and (3) Tran’s sister, but did not 
testify himself. 
Minor child testified at trial that Tran was her 
father’s best friend and that she had known Tran “[s]ince I was 
born.” 
According to minor child, Tran lived with her father at 
times, and she would see Tran at her father’s house when she was 
staying with her father. Minor child testified further that 
from ages eight to twelve, Tran, among other things, “rub[bed] 
4  
 
 
   
   
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
my lower private areas,” “touch[ed] my breasts” with “[h]is hand 
and his mouth,” “put his lips on my lips and . . . swirl[ed] his tongue in my mouth,” and “suck[ed] . . . and lick[ed] . . . and 
touch[ed] . . . with his hand” minor child’s lower private area. 
Tran argued in closing, among other things, that an 
inexperienced detective had “rush[ed] to judgment” and was “not 
focused on a fair investigation.” He also contended that minor 
child was “not credible,” was “seeking out attention,” and came 
from “a broken home.” 
At the close of the evidence, the circuit court
3 
instructed the jury on continuous sexual assault of a minor under the age of fourteen, under HRS § 707-733.6. The circuit 
court stated the offense’s material elements: (1) “[t]hat, on or 
about January 1, 2015, to and including January 31, 2020, in the 
City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawai‘ i, the defendant, 
[Tran], intentionally or knowingly engaged in three or more acts 
of sexual penetration or sexual contact with [minor child]”; 
(2) “[t]hat [Tran] intentionally or knowingly resided in the 
same house with [minor child] or had recurring access to [minor 
child] at that time”; (3) “[t]hat [Tran] knew he was not married 
to [minor child] at that time”; and (4) “[t]hat [minor child] 
was less than fourteen years old at that time.” 
3 The Honorable Catherine H. Remigio presided. 
5  
 
 
   
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The circuit court then instructed the jury that, “[a]s 
to Element No. 1, you need to unanimously agree only that the 
requisite number of acts have occurred; you need not agree on 
which acts constitute the requisite number.” This instruction 
tracked HRS § 707-733.6(2)’s language, which states that “the 
trier of fact, if a jury, need unanimously agree only that the 
requisite number of acts have occurred; the jury need not agree 
on which acts constitute the requisite number.” 
Finally, the circuit court provided the statutory 
definitions of “sexual penetration,” “sexual contact,” “deviate 
sexual intercourse,” and “married.” See HRS § 707-700. 
All members of the jury agreed to a guilty verdict. 
The circuit court asked the jury foreperson, “has the jury reached a unanimous verdict in this case?” The foreperson 
replied “Yes, ma’am.” At Tran’s request, the circuit court 
polled the jury, noting that “the purpose of a jury poll is to 
ensure that the verdict just announced is unanimous and 
represents the true verdict of the jury.” The circuit court then instructed the jurors to “answer yes if you agree with the 
verdict, answer no if you do not agree with the verdict.” Each 
juror, when asked individually, answered “Yes.” The circuit 
court concluded that “[t]he verdict is unanimous. And 
consistent with the jury’s verdict, which has been 
received, . . . the [c]ourt adjudges Mr. Tran guilty of the 
6  
 
 
   
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
offense of Continuous Sexual Assault of a Minor Under the Age of 
Fourteen Years.” 
In May 2022, after the verdict but before sentencing, 
Tran moved for a new trial, alleging several errors, including improperly excluded evidence and prosecutorial misconduct. 
Later that month, the circuit court allowed Tran to supplement 
his new trial motion over the State’s opposition. 
Specifically, Tran added an argument to his new trial 
motion based on the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Ramos v. 
Louisiana, which held that the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution requires verdicts from unanimous juries to support convictions. See 140 S. Ct. 1390, 1397 (2020). Tran argued 
that “the federal constitution, by way of its Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, does not allow a state to alter the 
verdict unanimity that the Sixth Amendment’s jury trial clause 
requires to convict on a criminal offense.” 
Tran argued first that article I, section 25(2) of the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution, providing that, “[i]n continuous sexual 
assault crimes against minors younger than fourteen years of age, the legislature may define . . . [w]hat constitutes the 
jury unanimity that is required for a conviction,” is 
unconstitutional under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. 
Second, without the benefit of this 
constitutional provision, HRS § 707-733.6 is unconstitutional 
7  
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
under the Hawaiʻ i Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to 
the U.S. Constitution. Third, without HRS § 707-733.6, Hawai‘ i 
law requires unanimous jury agreement on each of the three acts 
required by HRS § 707-733.6(1)(b) (2014). Fourth, the circuit 
court’s jury instruction on HRS § 707-733.6(2) (2014)’s 
unanimity rule, requiring jury unanimity only as to whether a 
minimum of three acts occurred and not requiring unanimity as to 
which three acts occurred, permitted the jury to convict Tran on an invalid and unconstitutional legal theory. Fifth, the jury’s 
guilty verdict must be vacated because it might rest upon the 
aforementioned theory. Finally, Tran argued he was entitled to 
a new trial where the jury would be instructed that all jurors 
must agree on at least three specific acts to return a guilty 
verdict under HRS § 707-733.6. 
In April 2022, one week after Tran was convicted, we 
issued our decision in State v. Jardine
, which clarified the 
specificity required in criminal charges. 151 Hawai‘i 96, 508 
P.3d 1182 (2022). Specifically, we held that, because 
“‘substantial bodily injury’ is a generic term for which the State must include the statutory definition by stating the 
species of injury allegedly inflicted, and/or a ‘to wit’ clause 
specifying the alleged injury,” the “felony information against 
[the defendant] was insufficient because it did not state the 
species of [the victim’s] substantial bodily injuries or descend 
8  
 
 
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to the particulars of [the victim’s] injuries.” Id. at 99, 102, 
508 P.3d at 1185, 1188. 
In May 2022, Tran moved to dismiss based on Jardine, 
arguing that the July 2020 indictment “did not provide the 
details that Jardine requires, beyond identifying who [Tran] was 
accused of sexually assaulting.” “Instead,” Tran argued, the 
“indictment used [HRS § 707-]733.6(1)’s generic language to 
accuse Tran of violating the statute and set forth the full 
statutory definitions of the terms” used in the relevant 
statutes. The indictment should have stated which of the 
“various forms of sexual intercourse, intrusions, and lingus” included in the definition of “sexual penetration” and which 
specific kinds of touching or other contact included in the 
definition of “sexual contact” Tran allegedly committed. The 
indictment, in Tran’s view, should therefore have been dismissed 
with prejudice because the State’s interest in prosecuting HRS 
§ 707-733.6 cases “is outweighed by the constellation of 
constitutional and statutory rights that the State’s prosecution of Tran, on a defective [HRS § 707-]733.6 indictment, has 
violated.” Tran argued that the error was “structural and 
systemic,” and that “doing anything less [than dismissing with 
prejudice] will compound and perpetuate that systemic structural 
error.” 
The State opposed Tran’s motions. 
9  
 
 
  
 The circuit court denied the new trial motion and 
continued sentencing, concluding that article I, section 25 of 
the Hawai i ‘ Const itution, “on its face, does not permit a [jury] 
vote other than 12-0 to secure a conviction.”   The circuit court 
reasoned that “[u]nanimity, or the state of being unanimous, 
requires the agreement and consent of all involved,” and, “[i]n the context of a jury trial, it means all 12 jurors must agree. 
It does not mean anything less than 12 (such as 10-2 or 9-3).” 
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Finally, “[a] 10-2 jury 
vote,” for example, “by definition, is NOT unanimous.” The 
court therefore “decline[d] to read [article I,] section [25,] 
subsection (2) to authorize the legislature to declare jury 
unanimity to be anything but 12-0. There is no other reasonable definition of unanimity.” 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Next, the circuit court addressed Tran’s 
constitutional challenge to HRS § 707-733.6, beginning with the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) decision in State v. Young , 
150 Hawaiʻi 365, 502 P.3d 45 (App. 2021), an HRS § 707-733.6 case 
decided after 
Ramos. The circuit court noted that the ICA 
concluded in Young that “Ramos did not address the issue presented by [the defendant] in this appeal: whether the juror 
unanimity requirement extends to deciding which of several 
possible means the defendant used to commit an element of the 
crime.” Id. at 370, 502 P.3d at 50. The circuit court then 
10  
 
 
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
concluded that “HRS § 707-733.6(2) does not violate [Tran’s] 
constitutional right to an impartial jury (unanimous verdict) or 
due process under either the U.S. or Hawaiʻ i Constitutions” and 
accordingly denied Tran’s new trial motion. 
The circuit court granted in part and denied in part 
Tran’s dismissal motion, dismissing the case because, “[f]irst, 
the indictment does not narrowly tailor generic statutory 
terms,” and “[t]he terms ‘sexual contact’ and ‘sexual 
penetration’ are generic terms because they are statutorily 
defined to mean more than one type of sexual act.” “Second, the 
indictment against Tran also fails to set forth factual details 
circumscribing the core of criminality in which he allegedly 
engaged.” While “[t]he indictment identifies the who,” it does not identify “what specific sexual acts occurred, where they 
occurred, and how they occurred,” the court wrote. Thus, the 
court concluded, “the indictment fails to ensure that the trial 
jury did not convict Tran on the basis of a factual theory of 
guilt that the State did not present to the grand jury or that 
the grand jury rejected.” However, the court dismissed the case 
without prejudice, instead of with prejudice, “in light of the 
evidence adduced at trial, the jury’s verdict, the seriousness 
of the offense, and the lack of any statute of limitations.” 
The State appealed from the circuit court’s dismissal 
order, arguing that the circuit court erred by (1) declining to 
11  
 
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
apply the Motta/Wells liberal construction standard to Tran’s 
postconviction challenge to the sufficiency of the charge, (2) concluding that “sexual penetration” and “sexual contact” 
are generic terms as used in HRS § 707-733.6, and (3) requiring 
that the indictment specify the predicate acts of the charged 
continuing offense. 
  Tran cross-appealed, arguing that the circuit court 
should have dismissed the case with prejudice, rather than without prejudice. Tran also challenged the denial of his new 
trial motion, raising five points of error: (1) article I, 
section 25(2) of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution is unconstitutional 
under the U.S. Constitution in light of Ramos; (2) HRS § 707-
733.6(2) is unconstitutional without the safe harbor granted by the aforementioned constitutional provision; (3) because the 
aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions are both 
unconstitutional, the rule requiring juror unanimity as to which 
specific acts constituted the three acts required, which those 
provisions overturned, applies to HRS § 707-733.6 cases; 
(4) Tran’s guilty verdict must be set aside; and (5) if Tran is 
retried, the circuit court must instruct jurors in accordance 
with the rule requiring unanimity as to the specific acts 
required to convict under HRS § 707-733.6. 
We transferred the case. 
12  
 
 
   
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Constitutional Law 
  “Questions of constitutional law are reviewed 
de[]novo, under the right/wrong standard.” In re Gas Co., 147 
Hawaiʻi 186, 198, 465 P.3d 633, 645 (2020). 
B. Charge Sufficiency 
“The question of whether a charge sets forth all the 
essential elements of a charged offense is a question of law 
that this court reviews 
de novo under the right/wrong standard.” 
Jardine, 151 Hawai
‘i at 99, 508 P.3d at 1185. 
III. DISCUSSION 
The main issue in this case is whether article I, 
section 25(2) of the Hawai‘i Constitution authorizes nonunanimous 
jury verdicts for HRS § 707-733.6 cases in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as explained in 
Ramos. 
Tran argues that jurors in HRS § 707-733.6 cases must 
unanimously agree about three specific acts prohibited by the 
statute. 
The State argues that Ramos did not disturb laws 
permitting juries to return guilty verdicts where all jurors agree with the verdict but do not necessarily agree on specific 
predicate acts. 
While Ramos proscribes laws allowing nonunanimous 
juries to return guilty verdicts, article I, section 25(2) of 
13  
 
 
   
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the Hawai‘ i Constitution plainly does not empower the legislature 
to enact such laws, and HRS § 707-733.6(2) plainly does not 
permit nonunanimous juries to return guilty verdicts. We 
therefore conclude that these provisions do not violate the 
Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
Regarding Tran’s equal protection claims, because both 
article I, section 25(2) and HRS § 707-733.6(2) are rationally related to the legitimate legislative end of enhancing public 
safety, neither provision violates the Equal Protection Clause 
of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
We also clarify when courts must liberally construe 
charge challenges and what our recent decision in Jardine 
requires of indictments charging HRS § 707-733.6 violations when so construed. Under our precedents, we must liberally construe 
an indictment challenged after a jury verdict, as was the case 
here. When so construed, the indictment against Tran stated an 
offense because it included all essential elements of the 
charged crime and relevant statutory definitions, and he did not 
show he was prejudiced by the charge. We accordingly conclude 
that the circuit court incorrectly dismissed the charge against 
Tran. 
We therefore (1) vacate the circuit court’s grant in 
part and denial in part of Tran’s dismissal motion, (2) affirm the circuit court’s denial of Tran’s supplemented new trial 
14  
 
 
  
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
motion, and (3) remand the case to the circuit court for further 
proceedings. 
A. Article I, Section 25 of the Hawai‘ i Constitution Does Not 
Violate Tran’s Right to a Jury Trial Under the Sixth 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution 
Tran argues that, under Ramos
, both article I, 
section 25 of the Hawaiʻi Constitution and HRS § 707-733.6 
violate the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as 
incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment to 
the U.S. Constitution. According to Tran, 
Ramos “unequivocally 
held that states may not experiment with unanimity among trial jurors as to the truth of every accusation required to convict in a criminal case.” Tran further argues that the plain 
language of article I, section 25(2) “expressly authorizes 
experimentation that Ramos expressly precludes.” We disagree. 
Ramos does not reach the issues that Tran claims it 
does. Ramos held that the Sixth Amendment proscribes laws 
allowing nonunanimous juries to return guilty verdicts. See 140 
S. Ct. at 1397. Thus, Ramos requires all jurors to agree with a 
given guilty verdict. However, Ramos is silent regarding what 
Tran calls “experimentation with . . . unanimity.” Nothing in Ramos suggests that the U.S. Supreme Court sought to prohibit 
the people of a state from empowering juries to return guilty 
verdicts where all jurors agree as to guilt but do not 
necessarily agree on which specific acts that guilt is 
15  
 
 
  
 
    
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
predicated on. As a result, Ramos does not support the 
proposition that the Sixth Amendment invalidates either article I, section 25(2) or HRS § 707-733.6(2). Further, article I, 
section 25(2) comports with the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments 
because it does not authorize nonunanimous jury verdicts. 
Because article I, section 25 does not authorize the legislature 
to empower nonunanimous juries to return guilty verdicts, we 
need not address Tran’s argument that HRS § 707-733.6 violates 
the Hawai‘ i Constitution without article I, section 25’s 
authorization. 
1. The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Ramos does not 
proscribe unanimous juries from returning guilty verdicts notwithstanding potential juror disagreement 
on which specific acts satisfy elements of an offense 
The U.S. Supreme Court determined in Ramos that the 
right to a jury trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the 
U.S. Constitution, as incorporated against the states by the 
Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, requires juries to return unanimous guilty verdicts to convict defendants of 
serious crimes. In so holding, that Court overruled its 
companion decisions in Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404 (1972), 
and Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U.S. 356 (1972), which upheld laws 
allowing nonunanimous juries to return guilty verdicts in Oregon 
and Louisiana, respectively. 
16  
 
 
   
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
When Ramos was decided, article I, section 11 of the 
Oregon Constitution expressly permitted convictions by a 
nonunanimous jury verdict of 10-2, providing in relevant part 
that “ten members of the jury may render a verdict of guilty or 
not guilty, save and except a verdict of guilty of first degree 
murder, which shall be found only by a unanimous verdict, and 
not otherwise.” Or. Const. art. I, § 11. 
Similarly, article I, section 17 of the Louisiana 
Constitution expressly permitted convictions by nonunanimous 
juries, stating in relevant part: “[a] case for an offense 
committed prior to January 1, 2019, in which the punishment is necessarily confinement at hard labor shall be tried before a 
jury of twelve persons, ten of whom must concur to render a 
verdict.” La. Const. art. I, § 17.(A). 
Ramos clarified that “the Sixth Amendment's unanimity 
requirement applies to state and federal criminal trials 
equally.” 140 S. Ct. at 1397. Contrary to Tran’s claims, 
however, Ramos contains no language or analysis concerning any Sixth Amendment issue regarding the longstanding practice of 
permitting a unanimous jury to return a guilty verdict even 
where jurors might disagree about the specific acts satisfying 
an element of a crime. See id. 
17  
 
 
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The U.S. Supreme Court has long recognized this 
practice. In Richardson v. United States, the Court explained 
the rule as follows: 
The question before us arises because a federal jury 
need not always decide unanimously which of several 
possible sets of underlying brute facts make up a 
particular element, say, which of several possible means 
the defendant used to commit an element of the 
crime  .  .  .  .   Where, for example, an element of robbery is 
force or the threat of force, some jurors might conclude 
that the defendant used a knife to create the threat; 
others might conclude he used a gun. But that 
disagreement  —  a disagreement about means  —  would not 
matter as long as all 12 jurors unanimously concluded that the Government had proved the necessary related element, 
namely, that the defendant had threatened force.  
526 U.S. 813, 817 (1999) (citations omitted). 
  The growing body of post-Ramos state and federal case 
law confirms that Ramos did not disturb the well-established 
doctrine that the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not require jury unanimity as to specific underlying facts or 
“means” to convict a defendant of a continuing course of conduct 
offense, such as that which is at issue here. 
18  
 Notably, the ICA recently addressed this issue in 
Young. The defendant in that case argued that HRS § 707-
733.6(2) violated the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the 
U.S. Constitution under Ramos. 150 Hawai‘i at 368, 502 P.3d at 
48. With reference to article I, section 25’s history, HRS 
§ 707-733.6’s history, this court’s precedent, and U.S. Supreme 
Court precedent, the ICA concluded that “Ramos  did not address 
the issue presented by [the defendant] in this appeal: whether

the juror unanimity requirement extends to deciding which of 
several possible means the defendant used to commit an element 
of the crime.” Young, 150 Hawaiʻ i at 370, 502 P.3d at 50. That 
the Young defendant did not advance Tran’s argument regarding 
whether article I, section 25 comports with the U.S. 
Constitution does not change this analysis because of the two provisions’ interrelated histories, discussed infra, Section 
III(B). 
Moreover, as the Young court pointed out, pre-Ramos
“courts in other jurisdictions have held that their respective 
continuous sexual assault statutes do not require jury unanimity 
on the specific predicate acts.” Id. at 376, 502 P.3d at 56. 
These include courts in Arizona, California, Texas, and 
Wisconsin. See, e.g., State v. Ramsey, 124 P.3d 756, 764 (Ariz. 
Ct. App. 2005) (concluding that, under Arizona continuous sexual assault of minor statute, “the specific, individual acts that 
constitute the requisite number of predicate acts . . . clearly 
constitute the underlying brute facts or means rather than 
elements of the crime on which the jury must agree unanimously 
and separately” (brackets, citation, and quotation omitted)); 
People v. Gear, 19 Cal. App. 4th 86, 92 (Cal. Ct. App. 
1993) (noting that “[t]he crime of continuous sexual abuse of a child . . . is a continuous-course-of-conduct crime and 
therefore falls within the exception to the rule that jurors 
19  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
must agree on the particular criminal acts committed by the 
defendant before convicting him,” in upholding California continuous sexual assault of minor statute against jury 
unanimity challenge (citation omitted)); Jacobsen v. State, 325 
S.W.3d 733, 737 (Tex. App. 2010) (concluding that, under Texas 
continuous sexual assault of minor statute, “it is the 
commission of two or more acts of sexual abuse over the 
specified time period – that is, the pattern of behavior or the 
series of acts – that is the actus reus element of the offense 
as to which the jurors must be unanimous in order to convict.”); 
State v. Johnson, 627 N.W.2d 455, 460 (Wis. 2001) (concluding that, under Wisconsin continuous sexual assault of minor 
statute, “the predicate acts of sexual assault are not 
themselves elements of the offense, about which the jury must be 
unanimous before convicting the defendant. Rather, to convict 
under this statute, the jury need only unanimously agree that 
the defendant committed at least three acts of sexual assault of 
the same child within the specified time period.”). Nothing in Ramos changes these holdings. 
[t]he [U.S.] Supreme Court has recently held that in 
state court proceedings for serious crimes, there is a 
right to have all twelve jurors agree that a defendant is guilty, so that one single vote to acquit renders a guilty 
verdict unconstitutional. Ramos v. Louisiana, 140 S. Ct. 
1390, 1397 (2020). However, the Court has never held that 
20   Federal courts have interpreted Ramos similarly. One 
federal magistrate judge wrote that  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the jury must also be unanimous as to the means by which a defendant committed the crime, in a case where alternative 
means are argued to the jury. Indeed, the Court has 
distinguished between unanimity that [a] defendant 
committed the crime of conviction (required by Ramos) and 
unanimity as to how [a] defendant committed the crime (not 
required by Ramos).

Other federal courts have likewise interpreted Ramos.

WL 16753872 at *8 (E.D. Tex. July 13, 2022) (noting that, 
notwithstanding Ramos, “[a] disagreement about which of several possible sets of underlying brute facts make up a particular

report and recommendation adopted by No. 4:19-CV-00713-RWS, 2022 
WL 16748597 (E.D. Tex. Nov. 7, 2022), Hernandez v. Lumpkin, No. 
22-40782, 2023 WL 8371953 (5th Cir. July 6, 2023) (per curiam). 
Tran’s contention that Ramos addresses potential juror 
disagreements regarding predicate acts turns on Ramos’s use of the phrase “the truth of every accusation.” 140 S. Ct. at 1395 
(quotation omitted). However, the full quotation makes clear 
that the phrase “the truth of every accusation” referred to 
agreement with a given guilty verdict: 
[t]he requirement of juror unanimity emerged in 14th 
century England and was soon accepted as a vital right 
protected by the common law. As Blackstone explained, no 
person could be found guilty of a serious crime unless the truth of every accusation should be confirmed by the 
unanimous suffrage of twelve of his equals and neighbors, 
indifferently chosen, and superior to all suspicion. A 
verdict, taken from eleven, was no verdict at all. 
Id. (quotations, footnotes, and ellipses omitted). 
Thus, the phrase “the truth of every accusation” 
underscores that the Sixth Amendment requires a guilty verdict 
on which all twelve jurors — rather than fewer than twelve 
22  
 
 
   
  
  
  
  
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
jurors — agree and says nothing about potential juror 
disagreement as to specific predicate acts. 
For the above reasons, we conclude that Ramos does not 
address guilty verdicts returned by all jurors, notwithstanding potential disagreement as to the means by which a defendant 
committed an element of a charged continuing offense. 
2. Because article I, section 25(2) of the Hawai‘ i 
Constitution does not authorize nonunanimous jury 
verdicts, it comports with the Sixth and Fourteenth 
Amendments to the U.S. Constitution 
Tran argues that article I, section 25 of the Hawai‘ i 
Constitution authorizes the legislature to empower nonunanimous 
juries to return guilty verdicts and that it is therefore 
invalid under the U.S. Constitution. For the reasons set forth 
below, we disagree. Tran further argues that without the “safe 
harbor” provided by article I, section 25, HRS § 707-733.6 
violates the Hawai‘ i Constitution.  Since we conclude that 
article I, section 25 does not authorize the legislature to so 
empower nonunanimous juries and that provision therefore 
comports with the U.S. Constitution, we need not address Tran’s 
argument that HRS § 707-733 violates the Hawai‘ i Constitution 
without article I, section 25’s authorization. 
Because Tran concedes that article I, section 25 is 
unambiguous, we construe this provision according to its plain 
meaning. 
23  
 
 
  
 “[W]e have long recognized that the Hawai‘ i 
Constitution must be construed with due regard to the intent of 
the framers and the people adopting it, and the fundamental 
principle in interpreting a constitutional provision is to give 
effect to that intent,” and “[t]his intent is to be found in the 
instrument itself.” Hawai
‘i State AFL-CIO v. Yoshina, 84 Hawai‘ i 
374, 376, 935 P.2d 89, 91 (1997) (quotations omitted). 
Moreover, “the general rule is that, if the words used in a constitutional provision are clear and unambiguous, they are to 
be construed as they are written.” Id. (brackets, ellipsis, and 
quotation omitted)). “[T]he words of the [Hawai‘ i] constitution 
are presumed to be used in their natural sense unless the 
context furnishes some ground to control, qualify or enlarge 
them.” Malahoff v. Saito, 111 Hawai‘ i 168, 181, 140 P.3d 401, 
414 (ellipsis and quotation omitted). As with statutes, we “may 
resort to legal or other well accepted dictionaries as one way 
to determine the ordinary meaning[s] of certain terms” not 
otherwise defined. State v. Pacquing, 139 Hawai‘ i 302, 312, 389 
P.3d 897, 907 (2016) (quotation omitted). 
  Article I, section 25 of the Hawai‘i Constitution 
provides: 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In continuous sexual assault crimes against minors 
younger than fourteen years of age, the legislature may 
define: 
24  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
1. What behavior constitutes a continuing 
course of conduct; and 
2. What constitutes the jury unanimity that is 
required for a conviction. 
(Emphasis added.) 
  Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary defines “unanimity” as 
“the quality or state of being unanimous,” and, in turn, defines “unanimous” as "having the agreement and consent of all.” 
Unanimity, Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/unanimity 
[https://perma.cc/8LDV-7Z4V]; Unanimous, Merriam-Webster Online 
Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/unanimous 
[https://perma.cc/4LP9-QGCV]. 
Thus, for a twelve-member jury to 
unanimously return a guilty verdict, all twelve members must agree with the verdict, just as the jury did here. As the 
circuit court noted in its order denying Tran’s supplemented new trial motion, “[i]n the context of a jury trial, [unanimity] 
means all 12 jurors must agree.” Because “unanimity” means the 
agreement of all, article I, section 25 of the Hawai‘ i 
Constitution is in no way incongruous with Ramos. 
Article I, section 25 cannot be read to empower the 
legislature to authorize juries to return nonunanimous guilty 
verdicts. Indeed, the provision forecloses this possibility by 
using the term “unanimity.” 
In contrast, article I, section 11 
of the Oregon Constitution and article I, section 17 of the 
25  
 
 
   
  
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Louisiana Constitution expressly permitted nonunanimous jury 
verdicts of 10-2. See Or. Const. art. I, § 11. (“[T]en members 
of the jury may render a verdict of guilty or not guilty, save 
and except a verdict of guilty of first degree murder, which 
shall be found only by a unanimous verdict.”); La. Const. art. 
I, § 17.(A) (“A case for an offense committed prior to January 
1, 2019, in which the punishment is necessarily confinement at 
hard labor shall be tried before a jury of twelve persons, ten 
of whom must concur to render a verdict.”). 
Because this “constitutional provision is not 
ambiguous, the court, in construing it, is not at liberty to search for its meaning beyond the instrument.” Malahoff, 111 
Hawai‘i at 181, 140 P.3d at 414 (quotation omitted).  Our inquiry 
therefore begins and ends with article I, section 25’s text, 
which we may not construe to mean anything other than what it 
says. 
B. Neither Article I, Section 25 nor HRS § 707-733.6 Violates 
the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to 
the U.S. Constitution 
Tran argues that article I, section 25 of the Hawaiʻ i 
Constitution and HRS § 707-733.6 violate the Equal Protection 
Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Tran argues that those 
prosecuted under HRS § 707-733.6 are treated differently than 
those prosecuted under other criminal statutes, and that the 
difference in treatment is not rationally based. Specifically, 
26  
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Tran contends that defendants prosecuted under HRS § 707-733.6 
are denied equal access to the rule announced in our decision in 
State v. Arceo, 84 Hawai‘ i 1, 928 P.2d 843 (1996), and that 
because this denial is based on a presumption of guilt, article 
I, section 25 of the 
Hawai‘i Constitution and HRS § 707-733.6 
lack a rational basis. Because both provisions are rationally 
based on the legitimate legislative end of enhancing public 
safety, we disagree. 
“The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth 
Amendment [to the U.S. Constitution] commands that no State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal 
protection of the laws, which is essentially a direction that 
all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.” City
of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985) (quotation omitted). 
However, “[t]he Equal Protection 
Clause does not prohibit the State from passing laws which treat classes of people differently, but only from treating classes differently when the basis of the discrimination does not bear a 
rational relationship to a legitimate statutory objective.” 
State v. Bloss, 62 Haw. 147, 153, 613 P.2d 354, 358 (1980). 
Because Tran does not claim protected class membership, we 
review for rational basis. See Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 
F.3d 668, 687 (9th Cir. 2001) (noting that policy treating classes of people differently “need only be rationally related 
27  
 
 
   In Arceo, a case involving a two-count indictment of 
child sexual assault, we held that 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to legitimate legislative goals to pass constitutional muster” 
(quotation omitted)). Doing so here, we hold that both provisions comport with the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal 
Protection Clause. 
when separate and distinct culpable acts are subsumed 
within a single count charging a sexual assault — any one 
of which could support a conviction thereunder — and the 
defendant is ultimately convicted by a jury of the charged offense, the defendant’ s constitutional right to a 
unanimous verdict is violated unless one or both of the following occurs: (1) at or before the close of its case-
in-chief, the prosecution is required to elect the specific 
act upon which it is relying to establish the “conduct” 
element of the charged offense; or (2) the trial court 
gives the jury a specific unanimity instruction, i.e., an 
instruction that advises the jury that all twelve of its 
members must agree that the same underlying criminal act 
has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Arceo, 84 Hawaiʻ i at 32–33, 928 P.2d at 874–75. 
Under Arceo
’s rule, jurors had to unanimously agree on 
the specific criminal acts proven at trial when returning guilty 
verdicts. However, the people of Hawai‘i narrowed the 
Arceo 
decision when they incorporated article I, section 25 into the 
Hawai‘i Constitution.  Because their reasons for doing so are 
rationally related to a legitimate legislative end, this 
provision and its companion legislation, HRS § 707-733.6, 
comport with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
28  
 
 
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In arguing that article I, section 25 and HRS § 707-
733.6 discriminate against defendants prosecuted under HRS 
§ 707-733.6 by denying them the protection of Arceo’s rule, Tran 
cites legislative materials indicating that the provisions would 
“make it easier to prosecute those who repeatedly sexually 
assault a child.” See, e.g., S.B. 2246, 23rd Leg., Reg. Sess. 
(2006) (proposing amendment to article I of Hawai‘ i Constitution 
relating to sexual assault and noting “[t]his would make it 
easier to prosecute those who repeatedly sexually assault a 
child”), 
https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/slh/AllIndex/All_Acts_SLH2006.pdf 
[https://perma.cc/J7SF-3JSX]; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 3010, in 
2006 Senate Journal, at 1458 (noting that proposed legislation would “mak[e] it easier to prosecute those who repeatedly 
sexually assault children”), 
https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/journal/senate/2006/Senate_Journa 
l_2006_Committee_Reports.pdf [https://perma.cc/6TLH-7VYL]. 
While these provisions are not ambiguous, we turn to 
the relevant legislative history because “an examination of the 
debates, proceedings and committee reports is useful” in 
addressing Tran’s arguments here. Nelson v. Hawaiian Homes
Comm’n
, 127 Hawaiʻi 185, 198, 277 P.3d 279, 292 (2012) (quotation 
omitted). 
29  
 
 
   
  
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Article I, section 25 was enacted “to provide that the 
legislature may define what behavior constitutes a continuing 
course of conduct in continuous sexual assault crimes against 
minors younger than fourteen years of age and what constitutes 
the jury unanimity that is required for a conviction.” S.B. 
2246, 23rd Leg., Reg. Sess. (2006). 
A 2006 Senate Standing Committee report regarding the 
legislation that would become HRS § 707-733.6 noted that, 
[u]nder the current law, it is difficult to prosecute those 
who repeatedly sexually assault young children, because of 
the difficulty young children have in remembering the 
individual dates on which they were sexually assaulted. 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 3010, in 2006 Senate Journal, at 1458. 
Enhancing public health, safety, and welfare are 
recognized as rationally-based legislative ends. State v.
Mallan
, 86 Hawai‘i 440, 452, 950 P.2d 178, 190 (1998) (“[T]he 
police power issue is subsumed within the rational basis test. 
In other words, under minimum rationality due process analysis, 
a statute must be rationally related to the public health, 
safety, or welfare.”). 
This legislative history makes clear that these 
provisions were intended to protect children from repeated 
sexual assault, given the unique challenges that child victims might face under these circumstances. 
Together, these 
provisions aim to enhance public safety by permitting unanimous juries to return guilty verdicts in HRS § 707-733.6 cases 
30  
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
without requiring agreement on which specific acts were proven 
beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. As noted above, one specific reason for permitting juries to return verdicts in this 
manner was that children have a difficult time “remembering the 
individual dates on which they were sexually assaulted.” S. 
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 3010, in 2006 Senate Journal, at 1458. 
These provisions neither authorize nonunanimous juries 
to return guilty verdicts nor implicate the presumption of 
innocence, as demonstrated by the record here. The relevant 
legislative history reveals an intent to allow unanimous juries 
to return guilty verdicts in HRS § 707-733.6 cases without necessarily agreeing on which three acts were proven at trial. 
For example, a Senate Standing Committee report regarding the 
bill that would become HRS § 707-733.6 stated that the measure 
would permit juries to return guilty verdicts “if each member of 
the jury was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
defendant had sexually assaulted the child the required minimum 
number of times, even if there were no unanimity as to the individual assaults.” Id.The bill was not intended to permit 
nonunanimous jury verdicts or to alter the presumption of innocence. Here, Tran was presumed innocent and convicted only 
after a seven-day trial which concluded with all twelve jurors, 
who were individually polled at Tran’s request, and all answered 
31  
 
 
   
  
  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“Yes” when the circuit court asked “if [they] agree[d] with the 
verdict.” 
Because article I, section 25 of the Hawai‘ i Constitution 
and HRS § 707-733.6 are rationally related to the legitimate 
legislative end of enhancing public safety, neither provision 
violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
C. The Indictment was Sufficient 
The Motta/Wells liberal construction rule applies to 
Tran’s indictment challenge because he raised this claim after 
the jury’s verdict. The indictment was sufficient because it 
charged a crime and Tran was not prejudiced by the allegedly 
defective charge. We therefore vacate the circuit court’s 
dismissal order. 
1. Tran’s defective charge challenge was untimely 
and the Motta/Wells liberal construction rule applies 
After trial, Tran challenged the charge’s sufficiency 
on the grounds that it did not define the specific acts alleged 
against him. To comply with Jardine, Tran contends that 
statutory terms included in indictments “must be narrowed down 
to the pertinent species from [their] (often capacious) 
statutory definition[s].” He argues that his indictment defined 
only the generic terms “sexual penetration” and “sexual contact,” but did not state what types of acts he allegedly 
32  
 
 
   
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
engaged in. Thus, Tran contends, the indictment was so 
generalized that it did not state an offense. 
Under article I, section 14 of the Hawaiʻ i 
Constitution, those accused of crimes have the right “to be 
informed of the nature and cause of the accusation” against 
them. Defendants may challenge indictments for failure to charge an offense “at any time during the pendency of the 
proceeding” because of “the significant consequences associated 
with omitting an essential and material element in an oral 
charge” or indictment. State v. Sprattling, 99 Hawai‘ i 312, 318, 
55 P.3d 276, 282 (2002) (quotation omitted). 
While indictments can be challenged at any point 
during the proceeding, different standards apply to “post-
conviction challenges.” Motta, 66 Haw. at 91, 657 P.2d at 1020. 
Under the Motta/Wells framework, “we will not reverse a conviction based upon a defective indictment unless the 
defendant can show prejudice or that the indictment cannot within reason be construed to charge a crime.” Id.The liberal 
construction standard “essentially prescribes a presumption of validity on indictments that are challenged subsequent to a 
conviction.” Sprattling
, 99 Hawai‘i at 318, 55 P.3d at 282. 
Tran argues that the 
Motta/Wells liberal construction 
standard does not apply here because he challenged the 
indictment before sentencing. According to Tran, the liberal 
33  
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
construction standard applies only when the challenge is raised 
even later in the process, i.e., on appeal or in a Hawai‘ i Rules 
of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 proceeding. In support of 
that argument, he cites cases in which we have referred to the 
Motta/Wells rule as applying when an indictment is challenged 
for the first time on appeal. See, e.g., State v. Kauhane, 145 
Hawai‘i 362, 370, 452 P.3d 359, 367 (2019) (“[W]hen a defendant 
challenges the sufficiency of a charge for the first time on appeal, an appellate court will apply a more liberal standard of 
review, called the Motta/Wells rule.”). 
The State argues that the Motta/Wells rule should 
apply once there is a finding of guilt. It points out that this 
court has consistently applied the Motta/Wells liberal 
construction rule when charge challenges are raised “for the 
first time on appeal.” State v. Walker
, 126 Hawai‘i 475, 491, 
273 P.3d 1161, 1177 (2012) (quotation omitted), 
overruled on 
other grounds by Schwartz v. State
, 136 Hawai‘i 258, 361 P.3d 
1161 (2015). The State highlights that this court in 
Motta
adopted the liberal construction rule for indictment challenges 
raised “after trial.” Motta, 66 Haw. at 94, 657 P.2d at 1022 
(emphasis omitted). Because Tran first challenged the indictment a month after the jury’s verdict and the end of 
trial, the State argues the Motta/Wells rule applies. 
34  
 
 
   
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
While we have occasionally described the Motta/Wells
rule as applying to challenges raised for the first time on 
appeal, we have never held that it applies only to challenges 
raised on appeal. See, e.g., Sprattling
, 99 Hawai‘i at 318, 55 
P.3d at 282 (recognizing 
Motta/Wells rule “essentially 
prescribes a presumption of validity on indictments that are 
challenged subsequent to a conviction”). 
Motta itself is a good example. The defendant there 
was convicted of burglary, and subsequently claimed that the 
indictment was deficient for failing to allege the specific 
crime that he intended to commit when entering the building. 
Motta, 66 Haw. at 90, 657 P.2d at 1019. The defendant objected 
to the indictment by moving to dismiss more than two months after a jury returned a guilty verdict against him. Id. at 90 
n.1, 657 P.2d at 1019 n.1. Drawing on federal cases, we adopted a “liberal construction standard for post-conviction challenges 
to indictments,” under which “we will not reverse a conviction 
based upon a defective indictment unless the defendant can show 
prejudice or that the indictment cannot within reason be 
construed to charge a crime.” Id. at 91, 657 P.2d at 1020. 
Applying those principles to the Motta defendant, we rejected his challenge. We wrote that 
[b]y adopting this liberal standard for post- trial 
challenges, we do not mean to condone or encourage the 
prosecutors in failing to take greater care expressly to 
35  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
include all the elements of the offense being charged. 
Fifteen minutes to an hour more thought and effort spent on 
the drafting of indictments, would save the prosecutor, as 
well as our crowded courts, hours of time having to deal 
with these vexatious challenges to carelessly drawn indictments. 
Our adoption of this liberal standard should also put 
an end to what appears to be a pattern and practice on the part of the criminal defense bar, of waiting until after conviction before raising any objections to indictments. 
Id. at 94 n.3, 657 P.2d at 1022 n.3 (emphases omitted). 
The circumstances in Motta are analogous to those 
here, that is, a motion to dismiss made “after trial.” Id. at 
90, 657 P.2d at 1019. Moreover, the rationale set forth in 
Motta - disincentivizing the “pattern and practice” of 
defendants deliberately waiting until after the jury’s verdict 
before moving to dismiss - applies equally here. Id. at 94 n.3, 
657 P.2d at 1022 n.3. 
Tran argues that the liberal construction rule does 
not apply until after a defendant has been sentenced and a court has entered a final judgment. See, e.g., State v. Wheeler
, 121 
Hawai‘i 383, 400, 219 P.3d 1170, 1187 (2009) (observing that 
Motta
/Wells rule applies when defendants challenge charges 
“subsequent to a conviction”). However, these cases have not 
excluded the possibility of applying the rule to challenges 
raised post-verdict, but prior to sentencing. As we noted in 
State v. Akana, “[t]he meaning of the term ‘convicted’ or 
‘conviction’ varies according to the context in which it appears 
and the purpose to which it relates.” 68 Haw. 164, 166, 706 
36  
 
 
   
  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
P.2d 1300, 1303 (1985). While the “technical definition [of 
‘conviction’] includes the judgment or sentence rendered pursuant to an ascertainment of guilt,” the term is “more 
commonly used and understood to mean a verdict of guilty or a 
plea of guilty.” Id.Tran was convicted when the circuit court 
“adjudge[d] Mr. Tran guilty” immediately after receiving the jury’s unanimous verdict. 
Further, the rationale we cited in Motta applies with 
equal force whether the motion is made after a guilty verdict or 
after a final judgment of conviction is entered. Cf. State v.
Bautista
, 153 Hawai‘i 284, 289, 535 P.3d 1029, 1034 
(2023) (“[D]efendants awaiting sentencing, or those challenging 
a charging instrument’s validity for the first time on appeal . . . or even later per HRPP Rule 40, are foreclosed from 
having their pleas nullified or their trial convictions 
overturned per HRS § 801-1 [2014].”). 
We therefore hold that where, as here, a charge 
challenge is raised after a guilty verdict has been returned (or 
after a court has adjudicated a defendant guilty in a bench 
trial), the 
Motta/Wells rule applies. 
2. Under the Motta/Wells rule, the indictment was 
not defective because Tran was not prejudiced and 
the charge stated a crime 
Applying the liberal construction rule, we conclude 
that the circuit court incorrectly dismissed the indictment.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Tran argues that his case is similar to Jardine , in 
which this court held that the indictment against the defendant 
in that case was insufficient because it tracked the generic 
statutory language of second-degree assault, but did not include 
the specific details about the type of assault that the 
defendant allegedly committed. 
151 Hawai‘i at 97-98 , 508 P.3d at 
1183-84. In 
Jardine, we stated that when strictly construing an 
indictment containing generic language, a charge should “descend 
to the particulars” because including “such information would 
apprise a defendant of what the defendant must be prepared to 
meet.” Id. at 101-02, 508 P.3d at 1187-88. But in Jardine the 
defendant filed a motion to dismiss before trial, and the Motta/Wells liberal construction rule therefore did not apply. Id. at 98, 508 P.3d at 1184. 
Here, Tran has not established that he was prejudiced 
by the indictment. There is nothing in the record to suggest 
that he was misled or would have defended the case differently 
if the indictment contained the additional detail he proposes. 
Thus, we are not convinced that he was prejudiced by the 
indictment at hand. Cf. Motta, 66 Haw. at 94, 657 P.2d at 
1022 (upholding defendant’s conviction of burglary even where indictment failed to include crime that was allegedly committed when defendant entered building because he had “shown no 
38  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
prejudice in the outcome of his trial from the failure of the 
indictment to specify the underlying offense”). 
Second, when liberally construed, the indictment was 
sufficiently detailed to charge a crime. The indictment alleged in relevant part that 
[o]n or about January 1, 2015 to and including 
January 31, 2020, in the City and County of Honolulu, State 
of Hawai‘i, ALVIN TRAN, a person who either resided in the 
same home with [minor child], a minor under the age of 
fourteen years, or had recurring access to [minor child], 
with intent or knowledge that [minor child] was such a 
person, did intentionally or knowingly engage in three or more acts of sexual penetration and/or sexual contact with 
[minor child] over a period of time, while [minor child] 
was under the age of fourteen years, and was not married to 
[minor child], and knew he was not married to 
[minor child], thereby committing the offense of Continuous Sexual Assault of a Minor Under the Age of Fourteen Years, 
in violation of Section 707- 733.6 of [HRS]. 
The indictment included all material elements outlined 
in HRS § 707-733.6, citing that statute specifically. It also 
provided the statutory definitions of “sexual penetration,” 
“sexual contact,” and related terms. 
Generally, “[w]here [a] statute sets forth with 
reasonable clarity all essential elements of the crime intended 
to be punished, and fully defines the offense in unmistakable 
terms readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding, 
a charge drawn in the language of the statute is sufficient.” State v. Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 279, 282, 567 P.2d 1242, 1245 
(1977). Tran argues that because the indictment only included 
the statutory language of HRS §§ 707-733.6 (Continuous Sexual 
39  
 
 
    
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Assault of a Minor Under the Age of Fourteen Years) and 707-700 
(“sexual penetration,” “deviate sexual intercourse,” and “sexual contact”), it was too generic to state a crime. 
We do not agree that the indictment cannot, “within 
reason,” be construed to state an offense. See Motta, 66 Haw. 
at 91, 657 P.2d at 1020. As the State points out, when reviewing “whether an offense has been sufficiently pleaded,” 
this court “interpret[s] a charge as a whole, employing 
practical considerations and common sense.” Sprattling
, 99 
Hawai‘i at 318-19, 55 P.3d at 282-83.   
Here, the indictment included the material elements of 
the offense and all the relevant statutory definitions. 
A 
person of common understanding would know from reading the indictment against Tran that he was accused of violating HRS 
§ 707-733.6 by intentionally or knowingly engaging in (1) three 
or more acts of sexual penetration and/or sexual contact 
(2) with minor child, to whom he was not married (3) between 
2015-2020 (4) in the City and County of Honolulu. The 
indictment outlined the requisite mens rea and properly defined 
sexual penetration and sexual contact according to their 
statutory definitions. See Wheeler
, 121 Hawai‘i at 393, 219 P.3d 
at 1180 (“[W]here the statute sets forth with reasonable clarity 
all essential elements of the crime intended to be punished, and 
fully defines the offense in unmistakable terms readily 
40  
 
 
    
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
comprehensible to persons of common understanding, a charge 
drawn in the language of the statute [will be] sufficient.”). Therefore, the indictment charged a crime when liberally 
construed. See id. 
Tran argues further that “[e]lisions of necessary 
information to establish the crime of conviction precludes 
reasonably construing the charge to state an offense.” He 
asserts that the indictment should have included the specific 
types of sexual penetration or contact that he allegedly engaged 
in. Again, he analogizes to Jardine
, where we upheld the 
dismissal of a second-degree assault indictment that neither 
defined “substantial bodily injury” nor specified the type of 
injury that the defendant allegedly inflicted. 151 Hawai‘i at 
98, 508 P.3d at 1184. But, again, 
Jardine involved a pretrial 
motion to dismiss, and we did not consider the adequacy of the 
charge in light of the liberal construction standard. Id. at 
101-02, 508 P.3d at 1187-88. 
A more apt analogy would be to Motta, where the 
defendant challenged a burglary indictment on the grounds that it did not specify the crime that the defendant intended to 
commit when he entered the building. 66 Haw. at 92, 657 P.2d at 
1021. We noted there that, while the “general rule” in certain other jurisdictions was that such an indictment would be 
defective, under the liberal construction standard, we were, 
41  
 
 
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“within reason,” able to construe the charge as stating the 
offense of burglary. Id. at 93-94, 657 P.2d at 1021-22. In 
Motta, the defendant did not show that the indictment against 
him was “so obviously defective that by no reasonable 
construction can it be said to charge the offense for which 
conviction was had.” Id. at 94, 657 P.2d at 1022 (quotation 
marks omitted). 
Similarly, the charge here can be construed as 
alleging the offense charged “within reason.” See Motta, 66 
Haw. at 91, 657 P.2d at 1020. All of HRS § 707-733.6’s 
essential elements and relevant statutory definitions were included in the indictment. The indictment therefore 
“sufficiently apprise[d]” Tran of what he needed to “be prepared 
to meet,” Wells, 78 Hawai‘ i at 379 -80, 894 P.2d at 76-77, and 
“provided [him] with fair notice of the offense’s essential elements,” Kauhane, 145 Hawai‘ i at 370, 452 P.3d at 367 (brackets 
and quotation omitted). 
Because the indictment must be liberally construed, 
and, when so construed, was sufficient to apprise Tran of what 
he had to prepare to meet at trial, the circuit court 
incorrectly dismissed the indictment. The circuit court’s 
dismissal order is therefore vacated. Because we conclude that 
the circuit court incorrectly dismissed the indictment, we do 
42  
 
 
  
   
 
  
 
     
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
not address whether it should have been dismissed with 
prejudice.
