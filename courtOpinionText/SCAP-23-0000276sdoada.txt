Supreme Court SCAP-23-0000276 09-NOV-2023 08:35 AM Dkt. 23 SO 
SCAP-23-0000276 
 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI‘I 
STATE OF HAWAI‘I,  
Plaintiff-Appellant, 
 
vs. 
 
RYAN ROMAN-PETER, 
Defendant-Appellee. 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CAAP-23-0000276; CASE NO. 1CPC-20-0001111) 
On May 5, 2022, a jury found Ryan Roman-Peter guilty of two 
counts of attempted assault in the first degree, two counts of 
carrying or use of a firearm in commission of a separate felony, 
terroristic threatening in the first degree, and place to keep 
pistol or revolver. 
Roman-Peter had been charged via a 
complaint and preliminary hearing.  
 
 
  
 
  
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
After Roman-Peter’s conviction, but before his sentencing, 
this court decided State v. Obrero
, 151 Hawaiʻi 472, 517 P.3d 755 
(2022). Obrero
 held that charging a defendant with a felony by 
complaint, rather than through an indictment or information, 
violates HRS § 801-1. Id.
Roman-Peter moved to dismiss based on Obrero. The circuit 
court granted Roman-Peter’s motion. The State appealed. On 
appeal, the State argues that Obrero does not apply 
retroactively to defendants who were convicted after a trial. 
The State applied for transfer, and we granted its request. 
In State v. Bautista
, 153 Hawaiʻi 284, 535 P.3d 1029 (2023), 
this court recently resolved issues surrounding 
Obrero’s 
retroactive impact. “Obrero applies to cases that were pending 
trial before the decision. Obrero does not apply retroactively 
to defendants who pled out or to defendants convicted after a 
trial.” Id. at 289, 535 P.3d at 1034. We further clarified 
that “defendants awaiting sentencing . . . are foreclosed from having their pleas nullified or their trial convictions 
overturned per HRS § 801-1.” Id. Because Roman-Peter was 
convicted after a trial, Obrero does not impact his conviction.

Accordingly, we hold that the circuit court erred in 
granting Roman-Peter’s motion to dismiss. We vacate the circuit 
court’s order and remand the case for sentencing.
