OPINION   OF  THE  COURT  BY  DEVENS,  J.   
This appeal comes to this court as a transfer case from the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA). Defendants-Appellants 
Cathlen Zarko, et al. (Zarko Defendants) appeal from the 
April 18, 2023 Final Judgment and related orders of the Circuit 
Court of the Second Circuit (circuit court) partitioning a 
family-owned oceanside home lot in West Maui. The other parties

to the underlying partition action are Plaintiffs-Appellees 
Gordon Robinson, et al. and James Robinson, et al. 
(collectively, Plaintiffs), Defendants-Appellees William 
Robinson, et al. (hereinafter, Robinson Defendants), and 
Defendants-Appellees Shanin Sado, Kyle Forsythe, and Arnette 
Forsythe, et al. (collectively, Forsythe Defendants). 
The
 circuit court’s Final Judgment ordered the subject 
parcel, a lot in Mailepai, Lāhainā , Maui (the Property) and its 
four existing free-standing residential structures, be 
partitioned as a four-unit Condominium Property Regime (CPR). 
On appeal, the Zarko Defendants raise a novel question of law: 
can a circuit court exercising its equitable powers in a Hawaiʻi 
Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 668 partition action order a 
partition by condominiumization under HRS Chapter 514B, the 
Condominium Property Act? For the reasons discussed herein, we 
hold that partition by CPR is not a lawful form of partition in 
kind pursuant to HRS Chapter 668. Accordingly, we vacate the 
circuit court’s April 18, 2023 Final Judgment and related orders 
and remand this case to the circuit court to undo the CPR that 
was created on the Property, partition the Property by sale, and 
hold further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

I. Background 
A. Factual Background 
 The  Property  at  issue  is  located  in  Lāhainā,  Maui.   The  
Property  is  a  portion  of  the  lands  described  and  conveyed  by  
Royal  Patent  Number  1663,  Land  Commission  Award  Number  5524  to  
L.  Konia,  being  all  of  Allotment  14a  of  “Hui  Aina  o  Mailepai”  in  
the  ahupuaʻa  of  Mailepai.   The  Property  is  a  2.35  acre  parcel  
encompassing  an  entire  point  of  land  with  nearly  1,200  feet  of  
ocean  frontage.  
The
 Property was conveyed to Elizabeth Cockett Robinson 
(Elizabeth) and eventually placed into her trust. During her 
life, Elizabeth conveyed undivided percentage interests in the 
Property to her children and grandchildren. After her passing, 
the remaining undivided percentage interest in Elizabeth’s trust 
went to her five children: Gordon, James, Arnette, Cathlen, and 
William. 
The parties to this suit are the ʻohana groups of the five 
siblings who have held the following respective ownership 
interests in the Property: Forsythe Defendants--24.8% undivided 
interest; Zarko Defendants--21.8% undivided interest; James 
Robinson Plaintiffs--21.8% undivided interest; Gordon Robinson 
Plaintiffs--15.8% undivided interest; and William Robinson 
Defendants--15.8% undivided interest. There are four separate

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
dwelling structures on the Property, three of which were built 
by Gordon, James, and William Robinson, whose families live on 
the Property, while the families of Arnette Forsythe and Cathlen 
Zarko do not reside there. One of the dwellings is 
uninhabitable. 
For decades, the families repeatedly tried to divide the 
Property into severalty between the five siblings’ ʻohana groups, 
but without success. In 2003, Gordon Robinson proposed a three-
lot subdivision, which was not pursued by the co-owners, and in 
2004, the Successor Trustee for the Elizabeth Cockett Robinson 
Trust, Giles Forsythe, proposed the Property be subdivided into 
four lots. The co-owners apparently signed a four-lot 
subdivision agreement; however, the Property was never 
subdivided. The parties also attempted to sell the Property in 
its entirety from 2005 through 2008. Offers were received, but 
the parties never sold. 
B. Circuit Court Proceedings 
After the failed attempts to subdivide and sell, a 
partition action was initiated in the Circuit Court of the 
Second Circuit over fourteen years ago on August 26, 2010.1 The 
Plaintiffs’ suit sought a partition in kind of the Property into

five parcels or, in the alternative, partition by sale.2 The 
Forsythe, Robinson, and Zarko Defendants filed answers and 
counterclaims seeking partition by sale. 
In 2012, the parties agreed to list the Property for sale 
in February and again in October. The Property was not sold. 
On August 1, 2012, the Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended 
Complaint, which amended their request from a five-parcel 
subdivision to a three-parcel subdivision of the Property, or, 
in the alternative, partition by sale.3 Plaintiffs later filed a 
Third Amended Complaint clarifying party names. The Forsythe, 
Zarko, and Robinson Defendants filed answers, and the Forsythe 
and Robinson Defendants filed counter- and cross-claims asking 
that the Property be sold.4 
Over a year later, the circuit court appointed a partition 
commissioner to prepare a report determining if and how the 
Property could be divided in kind for allotment to the parties, 
2 Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint which corrected the names of 
the defendants in the action. 
3 Plaintiffs added a third claim, seeking damages for the loss of a 
homeowner’s tax exemption allegedly due to the Zarko Defendants’ failure to 
pay their proportionate share of the property taxes. Issues related to the 
amounts of property taxes paid or owed are not before this court, as the 
circuit court’s proceedings have not reached matters relating to the 
equitable division of the Property and adjudication of claimed credits and 
offsets. 
4 The Robinson Defendants’ counterclaim also sought, as an alternative to 
partition by sale, a partition in kind of the Property into three lots.

or if the Property required a sale. On January 24, 2014, the 
commissioner submitted his report concluding that the Property 
should be sold on the market because partition of the Property 
in kind would greatly prejudice the owners. This recommendation 
was based on the commissioner’s assessment of six appraisals of 
the Property’s value, three for the Property as a whole, and 
three with a three-parcel subdivision, factoring in the many 
costs and financial burdens and regulatory compliance issues 
with the County of Maui (County) codes. 
The commissioner also addressed the possibility of a 
partition by CPR. He concluded that the value of the Property 
would likely diminish because of the nature of a CPR’s common 
ownership and the possibility that the Property’s structures 
were not “in code compliance,” problematizing further 
development or improvement of individual units. Thus a CPR 
would reduce the value of the Property for the owners, 
especially for the two, non-resident ‘ohana groups. The 
commissioner concluded that after considering the diminution in 
value that would result with any division of the Property, and 
the equities--including the connections the five ʻohana groups 
had with the land and the costs of subdividing--partition in 
kind would likely greatly prejudice the owners; therefore, his 
recommendation was partition of the Property by sale.

    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Plaintiffs objected to the commissioner’s report and again 
asked the court to order partition in kind by dividing the 
Property into three separate lots or to investigate a three-unit 
CPR. The Forsythe Defendants maintained their position seeking 
partition by sale and asked the court to confirm and adopt the 
commissioner’s report. 
On
 July 14, 2014, the circuit court rejected the 
commissioner’s recommendation to partition the Property by sale 
and ordered a partition in kind by three-lot subdivision with 
costs to be advanced by the Plaintiffs. In its findings of 
fact, the court rejected the commissioner’s overall assessment 
that a partition in kind would result in a diminution in value 
of the Property as a whole. And in its conclusions of law, the 
court noted that Hawaiʻi partition law expressed a preference for 
partition in kind as well as a preference to allot to a co-
tenant the portion of the Property that was occupied and 
improved by that tenant. 
A
 year after the court issued its three-lot subdivision 
order, Plaintiffs returned to court and asked that the 
commissioner be allowed to list the Property for private sale, 
which the court granted without opposition. However, the 
Property did not sell.

           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Almost three years after issuance of the three-lot 
partition order, noting the unlikelihood that the County would 
grant needed code variances, the commissioner filed a motion 
asking the court to instruct on a two-lot subdivision instead. 
With no opposition from the parties, the court granted the 
commissioner’s motion to proceed, amending the July 14, 2014 
order to create a two-lot subdivision. 
Nearly four years after the two-lot subdivision order was 
entered, on January 2, 2021, the Robinson Defendants joined the 
Plaintiffs in filing a motion to amend the July 14, 2014 
partition order from a subdivision of the Property to the 
creation of a four-unit CPR. These parties further requested 
that Gordon, James, and William Robinson’s ʻohana groups each be 
awarded one of the new condominium units, which were residential 
structures these ʻohana had lived in for decades, and that the 
fourth unit be assigned collectively to the Zarko and Forsythe 
Defendants. The Zarko and Forsythe Defendants opposed this 
request, with the Zarkos arguing that HRS Chapter 668 did not 
allow partitions by CPR. 
The commissioner filed a statement relating to the 
Plaintiffs and Robinson Defendants’ motion, asking the court for 
specific guidance on the request for partition by CPR. While 
agreeing that a CPR would be “simpler” and “alleviate many of

             *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the costs and challenges” impeding subdivision, the commissioner 
noted “significant challenges” that he asked the court to give 
detailed instructions on. These challenges included his 
concerns that structures on the Property may not be able to pass 
County inspections necessary to condominiumize “without 
significant expenses and upgrades,” and since the CPR would not 
be a subdivision, careful delineation of rights that applied to 
the property as a whole versus rights enjoyed by separate units 
needed to be determined. He noted that the “ultimate solution 
must be in the best interest of all parties.” 
The circuit court held a hearing on the motion to partition 
by four-unit CPR. The Zarko Defendants again argued that 
HRS Chapter 668 did not empower the court to partition by CPR. 
And the Forsythe Defendants asserted: 
The problem here is that [HRS Chapter 668] refers to equitable 
distribution. And the key word here is distribution. When you 
do a condominium, you are continuing to be hinged at the hips 
with everybody else in the project. It’s not a situation where 
you walk away with your own separate piece of property which you 
can do with as you see fit. You are subject to the association, 
the rules of the association and the condominium. 
And, therefore, this is not the same animal as a 
subdivision. And, therefore, we don’t believe that condominiums 
are allowed in situations where a partition action has been 
brought forth. 
On May 25, 2021, the circuit court granted Plaintiffs and 
the Robinson Defendants’ motion. The court ordered partition by

court’s discussion of the equities in the hearing only touched 
on the “feasibility of the request” and “the equitable interest 
of the parties: namely, that they are parties in this case who 
wish to remain living on the property and oppose any sale of 
their interest[.]” 
After completing the four-unit CPR, on October 12, 2022, 
the commissioner filed a motion requesting, inter alia, that the 
court determine which ʻohana group would take title to each CPR 
unit. The attached CPR Declaration indicated that the 
commissioner had apportioned to each of the four units an 
undivided 25% interest in all common profits and expenses and 
common elements of the CPR. 
Plaintiffs responded to the commissioner’s motion for 
property disposition by asking that the court find, pursuant to 
HRS § 668-7(5), that the James Robinson Plaintiffs were 
equitably entitled to Unit A because they built that structure 
and installed the Property’s only water meter near that unit at 
their expense. And they asked that the court assign Unit B to 
Gordon’s children, Kelly and Keola Robinson, for equitable 
reasons, since their father built that family home, and Kelly 
continued to reside there. Plaintiffs had previously requested 
that the Robinson Defendants receive Unit D, with the

uninhabitable Unit C to be distributed to the Zarko Defendants 
and Forsythe Defendants collectively. 
The Zarko Defendants opposed the commissioner’s motion, 
challenging both the legality of the partition by CPR and the 
proposed assignment of the CPR units as being inequitable. They 
further asserted, inter alia, that the court’s partition order 
did not vest the commissioner with the power to act as a CPR 
developer. They argued that it was likely that two or more CPR 
units would need to be sold to compensate the Zarko and Forsythe 
Defendants’ almost 50% undivided interest in the Property. The 
Zarko Defendants also submitted documentation allegedly showing 
that Unit C was unsafe and unlivable. These records indicated 
that County building inspectors had only designated the 
structures on the Property as safety code-compliant once the 
electricity was shut off to Unit C. 
The circuit court granted the commissioner’s motion for 
property disposition, confirming the commissioner’s intent to 
determine if the parties agreed to assign the CPR units to 
different ʻohana groups, or, if they could not agree, the 
commissioner would assign the parties their current co-tenancy 
percentage interest in the disputed units.5 Once again, 
Following the retirement of Judge Loo, the Honorable Kirstin M. Hamman

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Plaintiffs and the Robinson Defendants asked that the court 
order Unit C be assigned to the Zarko and Forsythe Defendants, 
while the Forsythe Defendants asked the court to assign all co-
tenants their undivided percentage interests in the entirety, 
pending a new appraisal of the CPR units. The Forsythe 
Defendants also objected to any future assignment of Unit C to 
themselves and the Zarko Defendants as being inequitable given 
their actual ownership percentages. 
On April 18, 2023, the court entered Final Judgment on the 
commissioner’s October 12, 2022 motion for order of property 
disposition, directing that the judgment was “immediately 
appealable” under Hawaiʻi  Rules of  Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
Rule 54(b).6 Two months later, the circuit court ordered the 
conveyance of ownership interests in the CPR such that “each 
6 HRCP Rule 54(b) (eff. 2000) provides: 
When more than one claim for relief is presented in an action, 
whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party 
claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the court may 
direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer 
than all of the claims or parties only upon an express 
determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an 
express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence of 
such determination and direction, any order or other form of 
decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all 
the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the 
parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or

Unit shall be owned by all of the parties as tenants in 
common[,]” preserving the original percentage interests for each 
of the parties’ ʻohana groups. The court further ordered the 
appraisal of the condominiumized Property but then immediately 
stayed its order pending appeal. 
C. ICA Proceedings 
The Zarko Defendants timely appealed the circuit court’s 
April 18, 2023 Final Judgment; the January 17, 2023 order, 
granting the commissioner’s October 12, 2022 motion, inter alia, 
for an order of property disposition; and the May 25, 2021 order 
granting Plaintiffs’ motion to amend the court’s July 14, 2014 
partition order to a four-unit CPR. 
The Zarko Defendants assert three points of error: (1) that 
the circuit court erred when it ordered the creation of a CPR as 
a partition in kind pursuant to HRS Chapter 668; (2) that the 
court erred in imposing the CPR on the parties in the partition 
action; and (3) that the circuit court erred by not ordering the 
sale of the Property since condominiumization of the Property is 
greatly prejudicial to the owners. 
The Zarko Defendants argue on their first point that the 
general rule of centuries of partition decisions is that the 
purpose of partition is to sever unwanted ties, resulting in 
severalty, and not to create new ties to co-owners. Condominium

         *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
ownership, they assert, is characterized by compliance with 
binding contracts, like a declaration and bylaws, that our 
condominium law requires; in this way, a CPR does not fulfill 
the separating purpose of a partition action. They contend it 
is a misinterpretation of HRS Chapter 668’s grant of equity 
powers to a partition court, and an overstepping of its 
authority absent clear legislative intent, for a circuit court 
to bring the two statutory chapters together; thus creation of a 
CPR is not the “usual practice of courts of equity in cases of 
partition.” HRS § 668-1. 
To their second point, the Zarko Defendants assert that a 
court-ordered CPR forces unwilling parties to contractually 
entangle their relationships with their adversaries. And in 
this case, they argue that the requirements in HRS Chapter 514B 
that obligate fee owners to agree to the creation of a CPR, and 
sign necessary documents, were not met because the partition 
commissioner, not the parties, signed those documents. Further, 
they argue that a CPR declaration and bylaws dictate owners’ 
obligations, restrictions on property uses, and procedures for 
future group decision-making (voting behaviors) with other CPR 
owners; these contracts impose a new system of co-ownership on 
unwilling owners, which conflicts with a partition’s 
relationship-severing objectives as set forth in case law.

    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Asserting that the court’s partition of the Property by CPR was 
unlawful, and the parties and commissioner had been unable to 
timely subdivide the Property, the Zarko Defendants contend they 
were greatly prejudiced by this partition in kind, and that the 
circuit court erred when it did not order partition by sale. 
The Plaintiffs counter that the partition by CPR should be 
affirmed and the case be remanded to the circuit court for 
further proceedings relating to the distribution of the CPR 
units. On the matter of the lawfulness of the circuit court’s 
power to partition by CPR, Plaintiffs argue that the legislature 
intended to authorize a partition by CPR pursuant to 
HRS § 668-7(7). They assert that when HRS § 668-7 is read in 
pari materia with HRS Chapter 514B, HRS § 668-7(7) authorizes 
the partition court to exercise any remedy available to a 
circuit court in a civil action, and that the statute did not 
expressly exclude the creation of a CPR to partition a property. 
In support of their contention, Plaintiffs cite Kimura v. 
Kamalo
, in which this court affirmed the trial court’s order 
placing multiple defendants into a continuing co-tenancy in a 
partitioned parcel. 106 Hawaiʻi 501, 507-08, 107 P.3d 430, 436
-
37 (2005). This, Plaintiffs argue, is not different from the 
co-ownership in a CPR.

         *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
If  the  appellate  court  were  to  find  the  circuit  court’s  
partition  by  CPR  unlawful,  Plaintiffs  further  argue  that  the  
Zarko  Defendants  failed  to  establish  that  a  partition  in  kind  
was  impracticable  and  greatly  prejudicial  to  the  owners.  
The  Zarko  Defendants  subsequently  filed  an  application  for  
transfer,  which  this  court  granted.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
This court’s construction of statutes is shaped by the 
following rules of interpretation: 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself. Second, 
where the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, our sole 
duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning. Third, 
implicit in the task of statutory construction is our foremost 
obligation to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the language 
contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when there is doubt, 
doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an 
expression used in a statute, an ambiguity exists. 
When there is ambiguity in a statute, the meaning of the 
ambiguous  words   may  be  sought  by  examining  the  context,  with  
which  the  ambiguous  words,  phrases,  and  sentences  may  be  
compared,  in  order  to  ascertain  their  true  meaning.   Moreover,  
the  courts  may  resort  to  extrinsic  aids  in  determining  
legislative  intent,  such  as  legislative  history,  or  the  reason  
and  spirit  of  the  law.

III. Discussion  
A.
 The purpose of a partition action pursuant to HRS Chapter 
668 is to divide and separate co-tenancies to allow the 
owners to go their own ways. 
The  Zarko   Defendants  challenge  the  circuit  court’s  
authority  to  lawfully  partition  a  property  by  CPR  under  the  
applicable  partition  statutes.    They  assert  that  HRS  §§  668-1  7
7 In their answer to the Zarko Defendants’ opening brief, the Plaintiffs 
claim that the appellate court should dismiss their appeal for lack of 
appellate jurisdiction. Upon review, the court’s Final Judgment of April 18, 
2023, confirming the commissioner’s court-ordered partition of the Property 
into a four-unit CPR and the commissioner’s request to dispose of the units

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and  668-7  do  not  empower  a  circuit  court  to  order  a  partition  by  
CPR  pursuant  to  HRS  Chapter  514B  because  the  purpose  of  a  
partition  is  to  sever  ties,  which  partition  by  CPR  does  not  
accomplish.   Plaintiffs  argue  that  the  circuit  court  made  no  
error,  as  it  was  authorized  by  statute  and  case  law  to  partition   
the  Property  into  a  CPR;  that  there  was  nothing  unlawful  about  
the  creation  of  the  CPR  pursuant  to  HRS  Chapters  514B  and  668;  
and  that  the  Zarko  Defendants  did  not  suffer  great  prejudice  to  
their  interests  with  the  CPR  order.    
We  disagree  with  the  Plaintiffs.   Our  partition  statutes  
and  body  of  case  law  do  not  authorize  partition  by  CPR  as  a  
lawful  form  of  partition  pursuant  to  HRS  Chapter  668.  
At
 the time this partition action was filed, HRS § 668-1 
(1993) stated: 
When two or more persons hold or are in possession of real 
property as joint tenants or as tenants in common, in which one 
or more of them have an estate in fee, or a life estate in 
possession, any one or more of such persons may bring an action 
(October 12, 2022 motion), complied with the requirements of the applicable 
rules, including HRCP Rule 54(b). The appeal was filed pursuant to 
HRS § 641-1 and HRCP Rules 54(b) and 58. Therefore, this court has appellate 
jurisdiction over this matter. See Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & 
Wright,
 76 Hawaiʻi 115, 117-19, 869 P.2d 1334, 1336-39 (1994). 
Ad
ditionally, Plaintiffs claim that the Zarko Defendants’ appeal should 
be dismissed because laches and judicial estoppel bar their appeal. Both 
arguments are without merit. We note that the Zarko Defendants acted timely 
and expeditiously when they appealed the circuit court’s Final Judgment a day 
after its entry. And the partition commissioner requested the authority to 
assign all co-tenants their undivided interest in the entirety of the 
Property under the new CPR that the Zarko Defendants objected to. To suggest 
the Zarko Defendants adopted inconsistent legal positions on the CPR creation 
and assignment is to misrepresent the record. Even if properly raised, 
Plaintiffs’ claims fail for lack of merit.

part thereof is situated, for a partition of the property, 
according to the respective rights of the parties interested 
therein, and for a sale of the same or a part thereof if it 
appears that a partition cannot be made without great prejudice 
to the owners. The several circuit courts shall have power, in 
any action for partition, to proceed according to the usual 
practice of courts of equity in cases of partition, and according 
to this chapter in enlargement thereof. 
HRS § 668-1. 
HRS § 668-7 (1993) sets forth the court’s powers in 
partition actions, providing in relevant part: 
The court shall have power . . . : 
   .. . 
(4)
 To cause the property to be equitably divided between the 
parties according to their respective proportionate interests 
therein, as the parties agree, or by the drawing of lots; 
(5) To set apart any particular portion or portions of land to 
any particular party or parties who by prior occupation or 
improvement or otherwise may be equitably entitled thereto, and 
make any proper adjustment or equalization thereof by the sale of 
other portions and the application of the proceeds for such 
purpose, or as a condition of any such particular allotment to 
require payment by the parties of any value of the portion set 
apart to them in excess of their proportionate interest in the 
value of the whole property; 
(6) To divide and allot portions of the premises to some or all 
of the parties and order a sale of the remainder, or to sell the 
whole, where for any reason partition in kind would be 
impracticable in whole or in part or be greatly prejudicial to 
the parties interested, and by judgment or judgments to invest 
the purchaser or purchasers with title to any property sold, and 
use the proceeds to equalize the general partition; [and] 
(7) To exercise any other power pertaining to a circuit court in 
a civil action. 
When partition of two or more separate tracts or parcels of 
land  is  sought,  the  whole  share  of  any  party  in  all  of  them  may  
be  set  apart  to  the  party  in  any  one  or  more  of  the  tracts  or  
parcels.   Any  plan  for  a  subdivision  shall,  before  approval  of  
the  court,  be  subject  to  approval  by  the  planning  department  of  
any  county  having  laws  and  regulations  covering  subdivisions,  
applicable  thereto.   If  action  by  the  planning  department  on  the

HRS § 668-7 (emphases added). 
The statutes provide for partition in kind or partition by 
sale, with a partition by sale occurring if a partition in kind 
is “impracticable” or “greatly prejudicial” to the owners. 
HRS § 668-7(6); see Pioneer Mill Co. v. Ward, 37 Haw. 74, 87 
(Haw. Terr. 1945) (“At common law and in equity partition was 
always in kind, regardless of the difficulty or inconvenience of 
doing so, unless the parties agreed to a sale and a division of 
the proceeds.”); see also Lalakea v. Laupahoehoe Sugar Co., 35 
Haw. 262, 291 (Haw. Terr. 1939) (“[T]he circuit judge at 
chambers has jurisdiction to partition property either in kind 
or sale for division[.]”). 
1. The terms “partition” and “partition in kind” in 
HRS §§ 668-1 and 668-7 instruct our courts to seek 
division of co-ownership into severalty. 
When interpreting a statute, a court’s “foremost obligation 
is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the language 
contained in the statute itself.” Gillan v. Gov’t Emps. Ins. 
Co., 119 Hawaiʻi 109, 115, 194 P.3d 1071, 1077 (2008) (cleaned

explicitly provides for only two types of partitions: “partition 
in kind” and partition by sale. HRS § 668-7. As to a partition 
in kind, the chapter further alludes to the severalty component 
of partitions in kind with references to “set apart,” “separate 
tracts or parcels of land,” and “subdivision.”8 HRS § 668-7. 
When a term is not statutorily defined, “this court may 
resort  to  legal  or  other   well  accepted  dictionaries  as  one  way  
to  determine  [its]  ordinary  meaning.”   Gillan,  119  Hawaiʻi  at  
115,  194  P.3d
  at  1077  (cleaned  up).    
Black’s  Law  Dictiona ry  defines  “partition”  as  “[t]he  act  of  
dividing;  esp.,  the  division  of  real  property  held  jointly  or  in  
common  by  two  or  more  persons  into  individually  owned  interests.    
Also  termed  ‘partition  in  kind.’”   Black’s  Law  Dictionary  1347  
(11th  ed.  2019)  (emphasis  added).   The  dictionary  entry  further  
illustrates  the  term’s  meaning  by  quoting  from  James  W.  Eaton’s  
Handbook  of  Equity  Jurisprudence:  
Partition is the segregation of property owned in undivided 
shares, so as to vest in each co-owner exclusive title to a 
specific portion in lieu of his undivided interest in the whole. 
The term ‘partition’ is generally, but not exclusively, applied 
to real estate. All kinds of property may be partitioned by the 
voluntary acts of the owners. In the case of real estate, this 
is usually accomplished by a conveyance or release, to each co-
tenant by the others, of the portion which he is entitled to hold 
in severalty. 
Although HRS Chapter 668A (2016) (eff. 2017) applies to partition 
actions filed after January 1, 2017, under that chapter, HRS § 668A-2 defines 
“partition in kind” as “the division of heirs property into physically 
distinct and separately titled parcels.” HRS § 668A-2.

After the 1840s Mahele, which created and registered 
Western-style real property in the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, a 
partition statute empowering Hawaiʻi’s courts to divide and 
separate co-ownership interests in real property was created. 
HRS § 668-1 descends from the Kingdom’s statutes. As an 
example, the English language partition statute from 1884 
empowering this court to hear these suits in equity read: 
Said justices shall severally have power at chambers, to 
admeasure dower and partition real estate. . . . When the 
partition of real estate cannot be made without great prejudice 
to the parties, the judge may order a sale of the premises and 
divide the proceeds. 
1884 Compiled Laws of the Hawaiian Kingdom § 852, at 243. The 
Hawaiian language publication of the same statute read: 
He  mana  ko  kela  ko  keia  o  na  Lunakanawai  o  ka  Aha  Kiekie  ma  ke  
keena,  e  hookaawale  i  ka  waiwai  hapakolu  o  na  wahine  kanemake,  a

The  Pukui  and  Elbert  Hawaiian  Dictionary  defines  “mahele,”  
inter  alia,  as  a  verb  meaning  “to  divide,  apportion,  cut  into  
parts.”   Mary  Kawena  Pukui  and  Samuel  H.  Elbert,  Hawaiian  
Dictionary  219  (6th  ed.  1986).   As  this  court  noted  in  McBryde  
Sugar  Co.  v.  Robinson,  “[w]hen  used  in  the  context  of  land  
titles,  reference  [for  the  term  ‘mahele’]  is  usually  to  the  
Great  Mahele  of  1848,  which  accomplished  the  division  of  the  
undivided  interest  in  land  between  the  King  on  one  hand  and  the  
chief  and  konohikis  on  the  other.”   54  Haw.  174,  182  n.5,  504  
P.2d  1330,  1336  n.5  (1973).   In  our  land  law,  “mahele”  can  also  
be  the  noun  meaning  “separate  parcels”  of  land.   See  Miller  v.  
Heirs  of  Hiwauli,  68  Haw.  401,  402,  716  P.2d  161,  161  (1986)  
(“[T]he  crucial  finding  was  that  Keaka  conveyed  to  each  of  his  
nine  children  his  1/2  interest  in  one  of  nine  separate  parcels  
called  ‘maheles[.]’”).  
In
 a mid-nineteenth-century case, this court provided 
historical context for land law in our jurisdiction: 
[I]t  becomes  necessary  to  examine  the  nature  of  the  land  tenures  
in  this  Kingdom,  and  particularly  the  great  Mahele  of  1848.  .  .  .  
[I]t  was  finally  settled  and  fully  established  that  there  were  
but  three  classes  of  persons  having  vested  rights  in  the  lands  of  
this  Kingdom.   First,  the  King;  second,  the  landlords,  comprising  
the  chiefs  and  Konohikis;  third,  tenants,  who  afterwards  became  
“Kuleana-men.”   But  as  each  of  these  classes  had  rights  in  most  
of  the  lands,  in  a  descending  scale,  as  it  were,  it  became  
necessary  to  separate  and  define  the  rights  of  each--or,  rather,  
to  partition  in  severalty  to  each  one  his  proper  share  of  the  
whole.

overruled  by  Galt  v.  Waianuhea,  16  Haw.  652  (Haw.  Terr.  1905)  
(emphases  added).   Prior  to  the  Mahele,  “each  of  these  classes  
had  rights  in  most  of  the  lands,  in  a  descending  scale.”   Id.  at  
198.   These  acts  were  undertaken  starting  in  1848  to  separate  
and  distinguish  the  land  rights  of  the  King  from  the  rights  of  
the  chiefs  and  konohiki  from  the  rights  of  the  makaʻāinana,10  so  
that  Western-style  ownership  and  private  property  could  be  
established.    This  dividing  of  co-mingled  relationships  into  
severalty  is  what  mahele  accomplished.    
Interpreting “mahele” or “partition” benefits from 
consideration of the law within this historical framework. The 
purpose of mahele/partition was to disentangle parties’ property 
interests into severalty. It follows that “partition” in 
HRS Chapter 668, including “partition in kind,” aims to separate 
and divide co-ownership of property into distinct interests such 
that owners may, without restrictions, go their separate ways. 
2. The “usual practice of courts of equity in cases of 
partition” upholds the purpose of partition to 
separate co-ownership, not intensify or create co-
ownerships in new forms. 
The Zarko Defendants argue that the “usual practice of 
courts of equity in cases of partition” (HRS § 668-1) cannot be

interpreted  as  authorizing  a  court  to  order  a  “partition  in  
kind”  by  creating  and  imposing  a  CPR.   Plaintiffs  argue  that  
this  court’s  decision  in  Kimura  affirms  that  the  usual  practice  
of  partition  courts  includes  the  ability  to  partition  by  CPR.  
In Sugarman v. Kapu, this court noted: 
It is evident from HRS § 668-1 that the legislature intended that 
the provisions of HRS chapter 668 supplement the court’s 
equitable power. The statute recognizes the power of the courts 
to act according to the usual practice of courts in equity, and 
according to this chapter in enlargement thereof. Traditionally, 
courts of equity exist for the purpose of doing equity by 
ensuring that no injustice is done to either party involved. 
Inherent in the power to do equity is, of necessity, discretion 
to accomplish a just result under the circumstances. As 
indicated by HRS § 668-1, the legislature did not mean to 
restrict the powers granted to the circuit courts to only those 
enumerated in the specific provisions of HRS chapter 668.

Whether  a   relatively  new  form  of  property  organization  and  
holding,  i.e.,  a  CPR,  is  included  in  our  courts’  “usual  
practice”  of  equitable  remedy-fashioning  in  partition  suits  is  
at  the  center  of  the  parties’  contention.   The  phrase  “the  usual  
practice  of  courts  of  equity”  is  expansive,  not  limited  by  the  
statute,  which  states  clearly  that  it  is  “in  enlargement  
thereof,”  i.e.,  that  the  statute  enhances  a  court’s  traditional  
equity  powers  in  partition  actions.   HRS  §  668-1.  
Generally, the
 power of courts in equity to partition real 
property is longstanding, traceable to English historical roots

in  the  judicial  division  of  female  co-parceners’  ownership  
rights  to  inherited  lands  and  the  statutory  actions  to  divide  
co-tenancies  seen  in  England  during  King  Henry  VIII’s  rule.11   
The  general   rule  of  the  usual  practice  of  equity  courts  in  
partition   actions   was  summarized   by  this  court  in  Brown  v.  
Holmes:   
“A writ of partition lies at common law for one or more parceners 
against the other or others,” Freeman on Cotenancy and Partition, 
Sec. 420, the reason being “that as tenancy in coparcenary arose 
by operation of law, it was only proper that the law should 
afford the means of severance.” 3 Pomeroy’s Equity 
Jurisprudence , 2 ed. Sec. 1386, n.5. . . . “As early as the reign 
of Elizabeth, partition became a matter of equitable cognizance; 
and now the jurisdiction is established as of right in England 
and in the United States.” Pomeroy, Sec. 1387. It is clear that 
partition either of the estate or of the proceeds of its sale is 
a matter of right. 
By statute[,] a sale may be ordered and the proceeds 
divided  if  pa rtition  in  kind  cannot  be  made  “without  great  
prejudice  to  the  parties.”   [Revised  Laws  of  Hawaiʻi  (“RLH”)  §   
1648  (1905)]  
19 Haw. 268, 276 (Haw. Terr. 1909) (final citation omitted) 
(emphases added). 
In Campbell v. DePonte, we affirmed the circuit court’s 
order  pursuant   to  HRS  §  668-7(4)  that  divided  a  property  into  
smaller  lots,  holding:  
We have said that, under the provisions of HRS § 668-1, the 
circuit judge had jurisdiction to partition the property subject 
to suit by partition in kind or sale for division in whole or in 
part. . . . There is no doubt that the usual practice of courts 
of equity, to which HRS § 668-1 refers, includes the partition in 
kind of the common property, where that is practicable, and 
favors a partition in kind over partition by sale.

This  “usual   practice”  of  a  partition  court  to  divide  a  
property  “in  kind,”  i.e.,  into  smaller  lots,  was  also  
acknowledged  in  a  dissenting  opinion  in  a  partition  suit  in  
which  the  majority  held  that  the  subject  property  should  be  sold  
because  partition  in  kind  was  impracticable.   Chief  Justice  
Richardson,  in  dissent,  maintained:  
At common law the action for partition of land was designed to 
allow co-tenants to divide land held jointly . The then existing 
law only allowed a division in kind, i.e., an actual division of 
the property. 4A Powell, Real Property, § 612 at 650. More 
recently statutes have been enacted in almost every jurisdiction 
to comprehensively deal with the partition remedy. These 
statutes established the power and jurisdiction of a court to 
effect partition by a sale of the property with a division of the 
proceeds where circumstances are such that a division in kind 
would be injurious or impractical. However, even given the 
various modifications of the original remedy, the purpose of 
partition has remained the same, that is: 
[T]o provide a means by which people, finding 
themselves in an unwanted common ownership, can free 
themselves from the relationships incidental to such 
common ownership.

subject property is . . . susceptible of partition in kind.”12 
Id. at 178, 532 P.2d at 661. 
B. Under HRS Chapter 668, a court may not partition by CPR 
because our existing partition laws do not permit a court 
to replace co-tenancies in the entirety with increased co-
ownership entanglements and new contractual obligations 
imposed by a court on the parties. 
Partition by CPR undercuts HRS Chapter 668’s objectives and 
purpose. Our partition statutes and case law clearly set forth 
that a court may either partition a subject property in kind or 
sell all or part of the property and divide the resulting 
proceeds (and, if applicable, parcels) equitably between the 
parties. We have held that HRS § 668-1 empowers a partition 
court to partition in kind or sale for division in whole or in 
part. Lalakea, 35 Haw. at 293. And our partition law favors a 
partition in kind where practicable over partition by sale. 
Campbell, 57 Haw. at 514, 559 P.2d at 742 (citing 2 American Law 
of Property § 6.26 (1952); 4A Powell on Real Property, § 612 
(Rohan Rev. 1976)). But the particular nature of the legal 
entanglements between owners of CPR units subverts the 
fundamental purpose of partition while maintaining an illusion 
of an “in kind” division of land. 
12 The court ascertained whether the subject property could be divided 
into two “separate” parcels or nine “individual” parcels. Id. Gomes, 56 Haw.

The Zarko Defendants argue that a CPR is not provided for 
in  our  laws  as   an  equitable  remedy  under  HRS  §  668-7  because  not  
only  are  the  lingering  and  binding  co-ownerships  of  a  CPR  
contrary  to  the  histories  of  partition  into  severalty,  but  also  
because  Kimura  affirmed  severalty  as  the  general  rule  of  
partition.   Plaintiffs  argue  the  opposite,  contending  that  
Kimura,  which  affirmed  the  trial  court’s  order  placing  multiple  
defendants  into  a  continuing  co-tenancy  on  a  single,  subdivided  
parcel,  implicitly  approved  a  circuit  court’s  power  to  partition   
by  CPR.  
In  Kimura,  the   majority  co-owner  sought  partition  of  
multiple parcels on
 the island of Hawaiʻi held in  co-tenancy with 
multiple defendants, some of whom were non-responsive to the 
lawsuit. The trial court initially found plaintiffs held an 
undivided 88% interest in the subject property, with defendants 
holding a 12% undivided interest. Kimura, 106
 Hawaiʻi at 504,  
107 P.3d at 433. The court then ordered the commissioner to 
compare the costs between a two-lot and a three-lot subdivision 
of the property. Id. at 505,
 107 P.3d at 434. 
Responsive defendants requested that the court subdivide 
the property into three lots, with one for the plaintiffs, one 
for their family group of defendants, and the third lot to be 
sold at a later date. Id. The commissioner told the court that 
31            
 
 
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
both  a  two-lot  and  three-lot  subdivision  were  possible,  but  that  
the  three-lot  subdivision  would  cost  significantly  more  than  
creating  a  two-lot  subdivision.   Id.   The  trial  court  ordered  
the  creation  of  the  two-lot  subdivision,  assigning  the  larger  
parcel  to  the  plaintiffs  and  the  smaller  parcel  in  undivided  co-
tenancies  to  all  of  the  defendants,  including  the  non-responsive   
parties.   Id.   This  court  affirmed  the  trial  court’s  order  
creating  the  two-lot  subdivision  and  its  disposition  of  the  
smaller  parcel  to  the  responsive  and  non-responsive  defendants  
in  undivided  co-tenancy,  noting  that  defendants  were  free  to  
pursue  further  partition  and  recovery  of  costs  from  their  non-
responsive  co-tenants.   Id.  at  510-11,  107  P.3d  at  439-40.  
The instant case is clearly distinguishable from Kimura
. 
The  circuit  court  in  Kimura  did  not  order  the  creation  of  a  CPR  
but  instead  ordered  all  defendants  into  a  continued  co-tenancy  
on  a  subdivided  parcel.   Id.  at  505,  107  P.3d  at  433.   This  
preserved  the  equitable  interests  of  the  non-responsive  
defendants  by  assigning  that  parcel  to  all  defendants  in  the  
suit,  while  allowing  the  majority  owner  to  take  its  interest  in  
severalty.   In  contrast  to  the  instant  case,  Kimura’s  parties  
were  not  forced  into  new  forms  of  co-ownership.   Nor  were  the  
Kimura  defendants  bound  closer  together  in  contracts  that  
dictated  procedures  and  voting  required  to  make  changes  on  their

land as the Zarko Defendants are subjected to with the court-
ordered CPR. Instead, the Kimura defendants were free to pursue 
further disentangling of their unwanted co-tenancies because 
they retained the right to partition, and they “were not 
prohibited from filing a future partition action as between them 
and the [non-responsive party.]” Id. at 510, 107 P.3d at 439. 
Here, the Zarko Defendants are co-owners of the CPR with 
their relatives, and they have been bound unwillingly by the 
court to CPR declarations and bylaws that shape the rights, 
responsibilities, and future actions of the Property’s co-
owners. See HRS Chapter 514B. This exceeds Kimura. The 
instant Property’s CPR documents create a decision-making 
association, common interests, and common elements that all 
owners must abide by. And HRS Chapter 514B’s requirements 
restrict the Zarko Defendants and the other parties from the 
relief of partition unless they vote according to their 
governing documents to remove parts of the Property from the 
CPR. This binds rather than frees the parties from the 
relationships incidental to common ownership, thus thwarting the 
objectives of a partition action. 
Kimura does not authorize a court to fashion a partition 
remedy pursuant to HRS § 668-7 that undermines the purpose and 
objectives of our partition or “mahele” statutes. A CPR is not

the  same  as  co-tenancy  in  the  entirety.   A  CPR  further  
entrenches,  complicates,  and  joins  parties  instead  of  relieving  
them  of  the  obligations  and  interactions  that  come  with  co-
ownership  of  a  property,  and  foils  the  fundamental  severing  
objectives  of  a  partition  action.    
The
 Connecticut Supreme Court’s reasoning in Wilcox v. 
Willard Shopping Center Associates, cited by the Zarko 
Defendants, is persuasive. 544 A.2d 1207, 1208 (Conn. 1988). 
Wilcox is instructive in its observations on the excessive 
entanglements that a partition by CPR, if lawful, would impose 
upon contentious parties seeking partition relief from their co-
ownership of a property. Wilcox involved a partition action in 
which a majority co-owner of a shopping center sought severance 
of his co-tenancy by sale. Id. at 1209. Defendants urged the 
trial court to order a CPR of the commercial property instead of 
attempting to divide the shopping center in kind, as it was 
clear from the layout of the structures and their shared 
utilities that a partition in kind was impracticable. Id. The 
trial court determined that it was impracticable to partition 
the shopping center in kind and that a partition of the property 
could not be effected by application of Connecticut’s CPR 
statute, the Common Interest Ownership Act (CIOA). Id. at 1210 
(citing General Statutes §§ 47-200 through 47-293).

On  appeal,  the  Wilcox  court  affirmed  the  trial  court’s  
ruling  and  held  that  the  Connecticut  legislature  did  not  enact  
its  CPR  statute  “as  an  additional  vehicle  to  effect  partition  in  
kind.”   Id.  at  1211.   Noting  that  Connecticut’s  partition  
statutes  and  its  CIOA  did  not  expressly  rule  out  such  a  
partition  remedy,  the  Wilcox  court  stated  its  examination  of  the  
statutes  and  policies  revealed  an  incongruity.   The  court  
explained:  
A plaintiff in an action for partition seeks to sever or dissolve 
involuntary joint ownership in real property. In furtherance of 
that objective, a court is limited to rendering a judgment of 
either partition in kind or by sale of the real property[,] thus 
terminating the ownership relationship between the parties. 
On the other hand, [the] CIOA affords the purchaser of a 
condominium fee simple ownership of his unit while sharing with 
other unit owners the burdens and benefits of the community’s 
common elements. [The] CIOA is a detailed statutory scheme 
governing the creation, organization and management of common 
interest communities and contemplates the voluntary participation 
of the owners. It entails the drafting and filing of a 
declaration describing the location and configuration of the real 
property, development rights, and restrictions on its use, 
occupancy and alienation; the enactment of bylaws; and the 
establishment of a unit owners’ association; and an executive 
board to act on its behalf. It anticipates group decision-making 
relating to the development of a budget, the maintenance and 
repair of the common elements, the placement of insurance, and 
the provision for common expenses and common liabilities. The 
Condominium Act imposes additional requirements pertaining, for 
example, to the amendment of the declaration and bylaws; and to 
the allocation of profits and expenses. Further, a unit owner 
seeking to sell his interest to a third party would require the 
involvement of the unit owners’ association in order to provide 
certain information required by [the CIOA] to be disclosed to the 
purchaser. 
In sum, were the court to superimpose a condominium on the 
shopping center, relations between [defendants and plaintiff] 
would be further complicated. Clearly, this is not the goal to 
be achieved by an action for partition of real property, and 
would run counter to the policy sought to be advanced by the 
statutes governing partition. Rather than dissolving the co-

tenancy between the parties, it would compel [plaintiff] to 
remain a joint owner with [defendants] at least until such time 
as the condominium is established. We can discern no legislative 
intent to delay the severance of joint ownership by creation of a 
condominium out of the property to be partitioned. We would 
overstep the bounds of our authority if, in the absence of clear 
legislative intent, we were to engraft the provisions of [the] 
CIOA onto the partition statutes to achieve the result sought by 
[defendants]. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court 
correctly concluded that imposition of a condominium is not 
legally possible. 
Id. at 1211-12 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). 
Pursuant to our laws in HRS Chapter 514B, a CPR binds 
owners to certain obligations and demands, in contrast to the 
limited obligations of tenants-in-common owning a non-CPR 
parcel. Under HRS Chapter 514B, parties are forced into 
tighter, more intertwined relationships than existed pre-CPR. 
The circuit court in this case exceeded its equitable authority 
in the absence of clear legislative intent, instead 
impermissibly “engrafting” HRS Chapter 514B into HRS §§ 668-1 
and 668-7(7) with its partition by CPR. See Wilcox, 544 A.2d at 
1212. For example, the Declaration filed for the CPR in the 
present case sets forth “common elements” for which the “right 
to partition or divide any part of the common elements shall not 
exist,” except as provided for by HRS Chapter 514B. Further, 
the Declaration indicated that each condominium unit, of which 
there were four, comes with a 25% common interest. Plaintiffs 
argued that the ʻohana groups of Gordon, James, and William 
should each get one CPR unit--the units they built on the 
36            
 
 
         
      
        
          
        
           
          *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Property--while the ʻohana groups of Cathlen and Arnette, 
collectively, should get the fourth unit. 
As
 the Property’s CPR Declaration allocates 25% common 
interest  per  unit,  this  sets  up  the  family  members,  who  have  
been  struggling  for  nearly  fifteen  years  to  sever  their  co-
ownership  interests,  for  future  and  continuing  adversarial  
struggles.   In  the  Bylaws,  a  quorum  of  owners  for  the  purposes  
of  owner  association  meetings  requires  “a  majority  of  the  
Owners,”  defined  as  “the  Owners  of  Units  to  which  are  
appurtenant  more  than  fifty  percent  (50%)  of  the  common  
interests  as  established  in  the  Declaration.”   When  determining  
decision-making  by  voting,  the  Bylaws  further  state:  “The  vote  
of  a  majority  of  the  Owners,  as  defined  [above],  shall  be  
binding  on  all  Unit  Owners  for  all  purposes,  except  as  otherwise   
provided  in  the  Declaration  or  in  these  Bylaws.”   With  this  
percentage  required  for  a  quorum  that  then  has  binding  decision-
making  powers,  under  Plaintiffs’  proposed  disposition  of  the  CPR  
units,  Plaintiffs  alone  would  be  able  to  carry  and  control  
association  meetings  and  decision-making  votes.  
It
 is difficult to imagine how these family groups, like 
the adversarial co-tenants in Wilcox, can avoid increasing 
conflicts between them when bound to act according to the CPR 
Declaration and Bylaws for the simple use and maintenance of 
37

their Property. This kind of embroilment of adversaries is 
excessive and would continue deeply contentious relationships 
between unwilling parties rather than free them. The argument 
that a later sale of a unit would accomplish such relief for an 
owner does little to acknowledge the requirements of HRS §§ 
668-1 and 668-7, especially the requirement that a partition 
remedy not greatly prejudice the owners. Here, a CPR at its 
creation is an imposition upon unwilling parties and greatly 
prejudices the owners with greater restrictions on their 
property rights, dictation of future acts, and tightening of 
unwanted relationships. 
Our case law and history of land rights confirms that the 
fundamental purpose of partition or mahele is to divide and 
separate mingled co-ownership interests. It is also the case 
that our courts should retain the flexibility in equity to order 
continuing co-tenancies when a partition in kind results in 
subdivided parcels involving non-responsive parties, as in 
Kimura.13 But it is not lawful for a circuit court to order a 
Regarding the role partition suits have played in the histories of land 
dispossession, especially in Native Hawaiian families, Chief Justice 
Richardson’s dissent in Gomes references these historical stakes, even as it 
reaffirms the general rule of partition determinations: 
Undoubtedly there will be circumstances which justify the 
invocation of partition by judicial sale under HRS §§ 668-1 and 
668-7(6). In the situation where the statutory grounds are met 
the preference for actual division of property must yield to

partition  by  CPR.   Such  a  partition,  in  full  compliance  with  
HRS  Chapter  514B,  would  further  bind  parties  and  limit  their  
respective  rights  in  a  way  that  is  excessive  and  greatly  
prejudicial  to  the  owners.   HRS  §  668-1.   The  circuit  court  
abused  its  discretion  by  ordering  a  partition  of  the  Property  by  
CPR.    
C. The circuit court abused its discretion in not ordering 
partition by sale because partition in kind was 
impracticable and greatly prejudicial to the owners. 
The Zarko Defendants argue that the circuit court erred 
when  it   did  not  find  that  partition  in  kind  was  impracticable  
and  greatly  prejudicial  to  the  owners,  and  when  the  court  did  
not  order  partition  by  sale.   We  agree.   We  review  a  circuit  14 
partition by judicial sale. But let us recognize that such 
preference for partition in kind should not be so easily 
disregarded. “Mindful of our Hawaiian heritage,” we must not 
lose sight of the cultural traditions which attach fundamental 
importance to keeping ancestral land in a particular family line. 
56 Haw. at 180, 532 P.2d at 662. A court following Kimura and other cases 
can balance co-tenants’ historical, familial, and practical relationships to 
their lands in its determinations of the equities, which could include 
maintaining co-tenancies in a subdivided parcel so as not to completely 
remove the possibility of future amicable settlements or buy-outs of co-
tenants who want to sell. 
14 Plaintiffs assert the Zarko Defendants’ request for relief through sale 
of the Property should be denied because the Zarkos failed to pay back taxes 
when the circuit court ordered the parties to pay what was required to keep 
the subdivision process moving forward. We note that the circuit court then 
ordered Plaintiffs to pay the back taxes and seek a lien against the Zarko 
Defendants’ interests if they so desired. The matter of back taxes allegedly 
owed by the parties is not properly before us; and on remand, it is a matter 
for the circuit court to address and determine equitable disposition, 
including the allocation of offsets, costs, and fees.

court’s decision to order a partition in kind instead of a 
partition by sale under the abuse of discretion standard. 
In  a  partition  action,  division  of  a  property  by  physical  
partition  is  always  favored  in  this  jurisdiction  both  legally  
and  equitably  under  HRS  Chapter  668.   Campbell,  57  Haw.  at  514,  
559  P.2d  at  742.   However,  when  a  partition  in  kind  is  
impracticable  or  cannot  be  accomplished  without  great  prejudice  
to  the  owners,  a  court  has  the  power  to  order  the  sale  of  all  or  
part  of  the  subject  property.   HRS  §  668-1.    
In
 Pioneer Mill, this court noted, “[t]he generally 
accepted test of whether a partition in kind would result in 
great prejudice to the owners is whether the value of the share 
of each in case of a partition would be materially less than the 
share of the money equivalent that could probably be obtained 
for the whole.” 37 Haw. at 87-88 “Great prejudice” can be 
demonstrated in diminution of value due to division, excessive 
cost of division, or where division would render substantial 
portions of the property unusable due to physical features 
and/or regulatory compliance. Holmes, 19 Haw. at 276. Brown 
further set out a non-exclusive list of factors to be considered 
in balancing the equities and determining great prejudice: 
The varied conditions of the property, the variety of uses to 
which different portions can be put, the absence of profitable 
use to which much of it is susceptible without large expenditure 
of time and money, and taking water from non-agricultural to

agricultural land,--all this presents a complicated problem, the 
solution of which, without sacrifice of, or injustice to, the 
interests of some one or more of the co-tenants, is extremely 
difficult. Considerable discretion must be allowed in 
determining whether or not under all the circumstances partition 
would greatly prejudice the common interests. On the other hand, 
the uncertainty of the tenure and the chances of its early 
termination might prevent a sale for a sum of money which, when 
divided among the co-tenants, would equal the profit which each 
of them can make out of the property during the balance of the 
term of the lease. 
Id. at 276. 
Here, in reviewing the circuit court’s orders to partition 
the Property in kind through subdivision and then by CPR, we 
recognize that Plaintiffs and the Robinson Defendants have 
expressed a strong desire to remain on the Property, and that 
the equities include considering what a sale of the Property to 
a party outside the current family co-owners could do to their 
ability to stay in their homes, where their ʻohana groups have 
lived for several generations. But the Zarko Defendants and 
Forsythe Defendants’ experiences of mounting costs and taxes 
owed are burdens they would not have to bear if they had an 
earlier opportunity to separate and free their interests in the 
Property from their siblings and cousins’ interests. 
In the commissioner’s report filed in the circuit court 
eleven years ago, prior to the CPR creation, the partition 
commissioner concluded that the Property could not be physically 
divided without great prejudice to the owners who did not wish 
to retain an interest in the Property, and therefore, he

recommended sale of the Property as a whole.15 After the court 
rejected this recommendation, the commissioner proceeded as the 
court ordered, but never submitted a subsequent report altering 
this opinion. 
The  commissioner   stated  that  while  he  was  “painfully  
mindful”  of  the  fact  that  the  Property  was  “family  land  and  all  
involved  had  a  deep,  multi-generational  connection  with  it[,]”  
he  determined  that  it  was  not  reasonable  “to  require  a  majority

when  that  division  will  have  a  severe  negative  impact  on  the

 its discretion, the court should act in the 
interest of fairness and prudence, and with a just regard to the 
rights of all concerned[.]” Sugarman, 104 Hawaiʻi  at 124,  85 
P.3d at 649 (quotation omitted). We review the proceedings and 
record in this case to determine whether the circuit court 
appropriately weighed the equities in not ordering partition by 
sale. 
The commissioner then recommended that the Property not be auctioned, 
“as may otherwise be allowed by HRS Chapter 668” because “[i]n fairness to 
all, an auction sale in a situation such as this stands little chance of 
maximizing potential value.” The commissioner instead recommended that the 
Property be listed and sold “in the normal course” with a qualified realtor 
chosen by the commissioner or clerk vested by the court.

In this case, the impracticalities and barriers to 
subdivision of the Property have been multiple despite the 
parties’ attempts over many years to subdivide. They include: 
aged, faulty or errant electrical wiring or other structures and 
property features that would be non-compliant with county code 
were it not for grandfathering the structures as they are; the 
associated problems of that grandfathering, as any improvements 
or rebuilding of structures would require the Property’s 
residences and infrastructure be brought up to modern code; the 
requirement that property taxes be current before subdivision 
was approved, which not all co-owners--especially the non-
resident owners--could afford; and the costs of making property 
improvements required by the County or seeking variances 
necessary for permission to subdivide. 
The commissioner considered that the parties had “intra-
family issues among family groups living on the Property,” which 
“play[ed] into a desire to sell to achieve physical separation.” 
Further, the time and cost of subdividing the Property “would be 
significant,” and no party at the time was willing or able to 
underwrite the costs. The estimated two-and-a-half to five-year 
time frame for completing a subdivision, according to the 
commissioner, weighed against division, “as that would be 
additional time during which the non-occupant parties would

continue to receive no beneficial use of the Property.” “This 
would be in addition to time post-subdivision that would be 
required to market and sell portions of the Property for those 
who do not wish to retain an interest.” 
The commissioner also observed the “unique” quality of the 
Property “in that it occupies its own point of land and is 
without oceanside neighbors. This level of privacy and location 
will increase value well beyond a similarly sized property that 
is bounded by neighbors.” Therefore, he opined that “[a]ny 
division of the land would, in my estimation, negatively impact 
the monetary value of the Property. I am mindful of the fact 
that the value of the Property is not merely monetary, but as 
holders of 63% of the Property” had, at that time, “expressed a 
clear desire to sell, monetary value takes on a greater weight 
and importance.” 
We agree that despite the significant and substantive 
efforts that these families have engaged in over decades to 
divide their family property into smaller parcels to meet the 
needs of the ʻohana groups that want to stay and those who are 
not residing there, division of the Property in kind has been 
impracticable and is greatly prejudicial to the owners.

impracticable or greatly prejudicial to the owners, a court has

the authority to order a sale of the property which this court 
has recognized to be an “absolute right.” As this court noted 
in Pioneer Mill, 
[t]he manifest hardship arising from the division of property of 
an impartible nature has been almost universally avoided by 
statutory provisions which give to a person entitled to a 
partition the right to have the premises sold, if they are so 
situated that partition cannot be made, or that it would be 
manifestly to the prejudice of the parties if the property were 
not sold rather than partitioned. . . . A sale and division of 
the proceeds among the cotenants is a substitute for partition in 
kind. However, partition by sale is an absolute right when the 
conditions which authorize a sale are found to exist. 
37 Haw. at 87 (emphasis added). 
All the parties to this partition action have at least once 
requested partition of the Property by sale, including the 
Plaintiffs, whose initial lawsuit sought a partition by sale in 
the alternative to partition in kind. All the parties have 
likewise agreed multiple times before and during the partition 
proceedings to put the Property up for market sale. 
As a partition in kind of the Property is impracticable and 
greatly prejudicial to the owners, the conditions which 
authorize a sale under HRS § 668-7 are present here. 
IV. Conclusion 
Accordingly, we vacate the circuit court’s April 18, 2023 
Final Judgment and related orders. We remand this case to the
