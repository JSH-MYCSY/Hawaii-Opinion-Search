MAHLON C. EZEOHA and LEAH DANSBY, fka Leah Ezeoha, 
Plaintiffs-Appellants, 
 
vs. 
 
ASSOCIATION OF APARTMENT OWNERS OF NIHILANI AT PRINCEVILLE

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT 
(CAAP-22-0000361; CASE NO. 5CCV-21-0000152) 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, and Eddins, JJ., Circuit Judge 
DeWeese and Circuit Judge Park, assigned by reason of vacancies) 
 This case mirrors Wong v. Ass’n of Apartment Owners of 
Harbor Square, ___ P.3d ___, 2024 WL 857152 (2024).  Because the 
two cases present the same issue, we vacate the Circuit Court of 
the Fifth Circuit’s grant of summary judgment and remand for 
further proceedings consistent with Wong.   
 In November 2006, plaintiffs Mahlon Ezeoha and Leah Dansby bought a condominium governed by the Association of Apartment Electronically Filed

 Owners of Nihilani at Princeville Resort (AOAO).  Ezeoha and 
Dansby financed the purchase with two mortgage loans. 
By 2010, Ezeoha and Dansby had fallen behind on their 
mortgage payments and association fees.  On February 23, 2010, 
the AOAO initiated a Part I non-judicial foreclosure.  
On March 29, 2010, the AOAO held a foreclosure sale.  It 
sold the unit to itself for one dollar, subject to the mortgages 
on the property. 
Years later, the mortgagee, Nationstar Mortgage, 
foreclosed.  On April 4, 2014 and March 5, 2015, Nationstar obtained foreclosure judgments on its two loans.  It took title 
to the unit.  
 On December 29, 2021, Ezeoha and Dansby sued the AOAO for 
wrongful foreclosure.  
 In January 2023, the AOAO moved for summary judgment.  It 
said that because Ezeoha and Dansby owed more on their mortgage 
than the unit was worth, they could not establish compensatory damages.  Ezeoha and Dansby disagreed.  They claimed their 
damages are the unit’s market value minus fees owed to the AOAO. 
 Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit Judge Randal G.B. 
Valenciano sided with the AOAO.  Citing Lima v. Deutsche Bank 
Nat’l Tr. Co., 149 Hawaiʻ i 457, 494 P.3d 1190 (2021), the court 
concluded that the outstanding mortgage debt offset and *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 eliminated the plaintiffs’ compensatory damages.  The court 
granted summary judgment and entered judgment for the AOAO.  
 Ezeoha and Dansby appealed.  Then, on September 13, 2023, 
they requested transfer to this court.  Plaintiffs’ transfer 
application recognized that this case presents similar facts and 
legal questions to Wong. 
We accepted transfer on October 13, 2023.  We decided Wong 
on February 29, 2024.  Then entered judgment in Wong on April 2, 
2024. 
The circuit court granted summary judgment on the damages 
issue before we decided Wong.  Wong clarifies how a plaintiff 
may calculate damages when they sue a condominium association for wrongful foreclosure.   
Accordingly, we vacate the circuit court’s judgment and 
remand for further proceedings.
