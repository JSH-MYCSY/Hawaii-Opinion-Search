OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.  
I. Introduction 
This is an appeal from an order dissolving a temporary 
restraining order (“TRO”) against harassment . Angelica Joy 
Daoang ( “Daoang”) lived in a house with her aunt Carolina 
1   
 
 
  
 
   
  
  
   
  
         
 
      
        
 
      
  
  
 
       
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
Balanza (“Balanza”) . The house was co -owned by Balanza and 
Balanza’s ex -boyfriend, Nicholas Perry (“Perry”). 
In September 2022, Perry and Balanza had obtained one-year 
family court restraining orders against each other . Perry did 
not return to the house. 
On February 16, 2024, Daoang obtained a district court TRO 
against Perry for a February 14, 2024 incident . Daoang’s 
district court TRO petition was brought pursuant to Hawaiʻi 
Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 604 -10.5 (2016) , relevant portions of 
which read as follows : 
§604-10.5 Power to enjoin and temporarily restrain 
harassment. 
(a)   For the purposes of this section:  
     “Course of conduct ”  means a pattern of conduct 
composed  of a series of acts over any period of time 
evidencing a continuity of purpose .  
“Harassment ” means: 
(1) Physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or the 
threat of imminent physical harm, bodily injury, or 
assault; or 
 (2)   An intentional or knowing course of conduct 
directed at an individual that seriously alarms or disturbs 
consistently or continually bothers the individual and 
serves no legitimate purpose; provided that such course of 
conduct would cause a reasonable person to suffer emotional distress.  
(b) The district courts shall have the power to 
enjoin, prohibit, or temporarily restrain harassment. 
 . . . . 
(f) Upon petition to a district court under this 
section, the court may temporarily restrain the person or 
persons named in the petition from harassing the petitioner 
upon a determination that there is probable cause to 
believe that a past act or acts of harassment have occurred 
or that a threat or threats of harassment may be 
imminent. The court may issue an ex parte temporary 
restraining order either in writing or orally; provided 
that oral orders shall be reduced to writing by the close 
of the next court day following oral issuance. 
(g) A temporary restraining order that is granted 
under this section shall remain in effect at the discretion 
of the court for a period not to exceed ninety days from 
the date the order is granted . . . . A hearing on the 
2   
 
 
    
     
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
   
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
petition to enjoin harassment shall be held within fifteen 
days after the temporary restraining order is 
granted . . . . 
The parties named in the petition may file or give 
oral responses explaining, excusing, justifying, or denying 
the alleged act or acts of harassment. The court shall 
receive all evidence that is relevant at the hearing and 
may make independent inquiry. 
     If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence  
that harassment as defined  in  paragraph (1) of that 
definition exists, it may enjoin for no more than three 
years further harassment of the petitioner, or that 
harassment as defined  in paragraph (2) of that definition 
exists, it shall enjoin for no more than three years further harassment of the petitioner  . . . .  
HRS § 604 -10.5 (emphas es added). 
Daoang’s ex parte petition for a TRO was granted on 
February 16, 2024 . After a February 26, 2024 hearing, the 
District Court of the Second Circuit (“district court”)1 
dissolved the TRO , determining there was a lack of clear and 
convincing evidence of “harassment” as defined by the statute . 
On appeal, Daoang asserts the district court erred by (1)  
concluding she was a guest and not a tenant in the house, and 
(2) applying the wrong reasonableness standard as to emotional 
distress.   Daoang basically asserts the district court applied a 
more stringent “reasonable person” standard based on Daoang’s status as a guest rather than a tenant.  
We need not decide the first issue on appeal, regarding 
whether the district court erred by concluding Daoang was a 
guest and not a tenant, which is a predicate for the second 
issue, whether the district court then applied a different 
The Honorable Blaine J. Kobayashi presided. 
3 1   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
“reasonable person” standard based on its erroneous 
characterization of her status.  This is because we disagree 
with the premise of Daoang’s issues on appeal, that the district court dissolved the TRO based on a  mistaken characterization of 
Daoang’s status as a guest, which allegedly led to it ruling that a reasonable person in Daoang’s shoes (as a guest rather 
than as a tenant) would not suffer emotional distress.  
The district court’s ruling dissolving the TRO was not 
based on its application of an erroneous emotional distress 
standard. Rather, HRS § 604 -10.5 contains two alternative 
definitions of “harassment,” and the district court found clear 
and convincing evidence lacking for a finding of harassment 
under either alternative. 
There was no evidence of “harassment” under the first 
definition , which basically requires physical abuse or the 
threat thereof. There was no evidence of physical abuse and the 
district court did not clearly err in finding a lack of such 
threats. 
With respect to the second definition of harassment, the 
question of whether a “reasonable person” would “suffer 
emotional distress” under the second definition (requiring a 
“course of conduct”) is not reached if there is a lack of clear 
and convincing evidence of a “course of conduct” constituting 
“harassment.” By finding a lack of “past acts” of harassment, 
4   
 
 
    
   
 
   
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
   
 
  
   ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
the district court implicitly found lacking the requisite 
“course of conduct .” Hence, the district court did not even 
reach the issue of whether a “reasonable person” would “suffer 
emotional distress” under the second definition. 
Therefore, t he district court did not clearly err by 
dissolving the TRO. 
Although we affirm the district court, we provide some 
guidance in cases related to domestic violence situations.2 This 
case arises out of the exclusion of Perry from a house he co -
owns with Balanza , which oc curred after incidents of domestic 
violence between them that led to protective orders . The 
protective orders had expired five months before the incident 
leading to the district court TRO , but Balanza’s ouster of Perry 
had apparently continued. 
Under real property law, Perry was also entitled to posses s 
the house as a co -owner. But Perry had not been there since 
2022 and Balanza had apparently changed the keys, so Perry 
entered the house through a window. Although Perry understood 
Balanza to be out of town, he did not know whether others w ould 
be present in the house . 
Based on the in -court proceedings here, Perry might have 
inferred that the district court condone d his efforts at self-
HRS § 602 -4 (2016) provides, “ The supreme court shall have the general 
superintendence of all courts of inferior jurisdiction to prevent and correct 
errors and abuses therein where no other remedy is expressly provided by 
law.”

 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
help. In situations related to domestic violence cases, courts 
should proactively consider possible steps to reduce the risk of 
future conflict . To avoid situations that could lead to 
unnecessary physical confrontations in cases related to domestic 
violence, courts should consider providing information to 
parties regarding other legal avenues and alternative resources 
through which they may be able to assert their rights and 
resolve their differences . 
In terms of the legal issues raised in this appeal, however, 
based on the record , the district court did not clearly err by 
determining there was a lack of clear and convincing evidence of 
harassment. We therefore affirm the district court’s February 
26, 2024 order dissolving and dismissing Daoang’s TRO with 
prejudice. 
II. Background 
A. Factual background 
1. Previous cases between Balanza and Perry 
Daoang’s February 15, 2024 petition for TRO discusses a 
family court order of protection that Balanza had obtained 
against Perry in 2022 and mentions that Balanza and Perry were 
litigating child custody in a separate case. Daoang indicate d 
that Balanza had been awarded sole physical custody of her 
children with Perry , that Perry had visitation, and that a court 
6   
 
 
    
  
 
  
  
  
    
 
  
   
  
  
 
   
 
  
  
 
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
order required them to have no contact except to exchange their 
children (Daoang’s cousins) at the Wailuku Police Station. 
Perry and Balanza had actually obtained family court 
domestic abuse TROs against each other on September 8, 2022, 
each alleging physical abuse by the other.3 At a September 19, 
2022 hearing on both petitions, the family court issued orders 
of protection in both petitions for one year, until September 19, 
2023. Both restraining orders indicate there had been abuse 
committed by Perry and Balanza.4 In both orders, t he family 
court ordered Perry to stay away from the house he co -owns with 
Balanza. The family court a lso ordered visitation for Perry 
from Friday at 6 :00 p.m. until Sunday at 6 :00 p.m. with 
exchanges of the children to occur at the Wailuku Police Station 
parking lot. 
On August 29, 2023, Balanza filed a motion to extend her 
protective order. She alleged Perry had violated her existing 
order for protection on April 10, 2023 and May 19, 2023, and 
that there were police reports regarding both incidents. This 
motion was heard by the family court on September 18, 2023 . 
Balanza appeared pro se . Perry’s counsel requested that the 
3 2FDA-22-0000724 & 2FDA -22-0000726. This court can take judicial notice 
of these cases, whether requested or not. Hawai ʻi Rules of Evidence Rule 201. 
4 Each restraining order contains a provision stating that the respondent 
is to be restrained “from committing further acts of abuse or threats of 
abuse.” 
7   
 
 
    
  
 
  
 
 
 
   
  
  
   
    
 
 
     
   
  
     
     ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
family court allow both restraining orders to expire, without 
extension, and the family court agreed. 
Thus, Balanza ’s and Perry’s restraining orders against 
each other expired on September 19, 2023, and were no longer in 
effect as of the February 14, 2024 incident alleged in Dao ang’s 
petition. 
2. Daoang’s allegations regarding February 14, 2024 
incident 
Daoang’s written explanation in support of her district 
court TRO petition said she had begun living at Balanza’s house 
in Wailuku since June 2023. On February 14, 2024, Balanza 
texted her and told her to make sure all the doors and windows 
at the house were locked because Perry was “acting stupid ” and 
might try to come to the house while she was out of town. 
Daoang did so, then went to her grandmother's house for dinner. 
When she returned, all the lights in the house were on and a car 
she didn’t recognize was parked in the driveway. 
Daoang called Balanza, who told Daoang to take a p hoto and 
send it to her , and that she would call the police. Daoang 
waited at a nearby park until police and family members arrived 
at the house. When the police arrived, they went inside and 
spoke with Perry. The police came out and said the y would not 
do anything because Perry co-owned the house. 
8   
 
 
     
   
 
    
     
  
    
  
  
   
    
   
  
 
     
    
  
  ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
Perry then began taunting Daoang and her family members. 
The police discouraged her from entering the house because it 
would escalate the situation. When she indicated she lived in 
the house , the police said she could enter to grab some 
necessary items for a short stay away from the house. Daoang 
entered with her uncle. Perry was laughing and recording the m. 
When Daoang went to the bathroom , she noticed that the window 
was open, and it appeared someone had crawled through it to get 
inside. Daoang exited the house with some of her things. 
Balanza then asked her to go back inside to video record 
the contents in the house. As Perry had not been in possession 
of the house for years and had no personal items there, Balanza 
was concerned that he might take things. Over Perry’s objection, 
the police allowed Daoang to reenter. As she took pictures and 
videos, Perry ma de snide remarks and alleged Daoang was not 
properly living at the house and was engaging in illegal 
activity. The police intervened to stop him. 
Daoang s tarted crying and tried to leave the house . The 
police had to physically put space between her and Perry because 
he was following her throughout the house. As Daoang headed 
downstairs, she noticed that the door to her room was unlocked. 
She told th e police and Perry she hadn’t given Perry permission 
to unlock or enter her room.

  ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
The police indicated she could take whatever she needed 
immediately. But she couldn’t easily take all of her computer 
equipment , which she used for work. She lived at the house and 
worked mostly from home. 
Frustrated, Daoang decided to just leave and come back 
later. Her aunt had instructed her to take all the mail before 
she left. As she collected the mail, Perry insisted that she go 
through each item to en sure she didn’t take any mail addressed 
to him even though he ha dn’t lived at the house for over two 
years and no mail for him was being delivered there. She also 
removed her aunt’s mail, purse , and jewelry from the house . 
The police indicated to Daoang that she should get a TRO. 
In her petition, Daoang maintained that Perry lived 
elsewhere, had not re-established possession of the house after 
the family court protective order, and that Balanza was working 
on buying out Perry’s interest in the house. Daoang believed 
that Perry’s entrance into the house through the window because 
he did not have the keys , his conduct toward her as she was in 
the house , and following her around, constituted harassment. 
She expressed fear for her safety as well as for the potential 
of further harassment. She reiterated that she was her aunt’s 
tenant, indicated that she was having to find places to sleep 
day to day , expressed concern that Perry may have interfered 
with her work equipment or papers , and that she was unable to do

  ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
most of her work while effectively being excluded from the home. 
She indicated Perry’s actions had continue d to cause serious 
emotional distress and stress . 
3. District court TRO and hearing 
Based on Daoang’s petition, a district court TRO was issued 
the next day, on February 16, 2024. A hearing was held on 
February 26, 2024 to determine whether an injunction should 
issue. 
At the hearing, the district court first confirmed that 
Daoang stood by the truthfulness of all the statements in her 
petition and that she had nothing to add . 
The district court then invited Perry to testify. Perry 
testified he had not been to the house from the September 2022 
TRO until February 14, 2024. He indicated he had stayed away 
because Balanza rebuffed his efforts to enter and that every 
time he’d gone previous ly, there had been abuse from Balanza. 
He said he decided to show up when he knew she was out of town 
to collect the remainder of his things, such as documents . 
When Perry entered the house, he found mail from two other 
occupants that had been living there unbeknownst to him , who he 
referred to as “tenants .” Upon entering what had been his 
downstairs office, he saw a bed, desk, computers, and posters , 
stating in court, “And mind you, I am a 50 percent owner of this 
house. I know none of that.” He indicated that his mother, who 
11   
 
 
   
  
 
   
 
     
  
  
   ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
was with him in the house heard a car door slam outside . She 
went into his son’s room to avoid a confrontation. The next 
thing he knew, there was a police officer standing in his 
bedroom door asking what was going on , and he explained the 
situation . 
The district court then asked Perry about the family court 
order of protection . Perry explained it was no longer in effect. 
Perry expressed frustration that he had not been allowed back 
into his house and that Balanza was treating the house as hers 
alone. He indicated he wanted to check out the house because 
the restraining order had expired and he’d been asking Balanza 
to sell the house since February 2023. He also expressed 
frustration that Balanza now had tenants living in the house 
without his knowledge and that she was making money from his 
property. 
12  Perry also expressed his belief that Balanza had 
manipulated Daoang into believing he was not allowed into the 
house despite him having half ownership.   He denied harassing or 
intimidating Daoang  and said he had told her to go grab her 
things and that he had no problem with her.   He asserted 
Daoang’s cousin was actually trying to call him out as if he 
wanted to fight.   He expressed his belief that Daoang had become 
intimidated and panicked because “it’s been a thing to keep it secret from me that she’s being living in my house.”      
 
 
   
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
   
  
 
  
  
  
 
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
The hearing then proceeded as follows: 
THE COURT : How --how is it that you --ah, do you have 
some kind of rental agreement with your auntie? 
MS. DAOANG: Ah, not on paper, but she allowed me to come 
into the house, um, after I moved back from Washington, ah, 
last year. 
THE COURT : And is your auntie charging rent to stay at the 
house? 
MS. DAOANG : Ah, no, I just help out when --whenever I can. 
THE COURT : Do you disagree that the respondent is, ah --
you don’t disagree that he co -owns the house; right? 
MS. DAOANG : No, I (inaudible). 
THE COURT : Okay. So and you don’t disagree that the Family 
Court order of protection that you reference in your 
petition is dissolved at this time? 
MS. DAOANG : Yes, (inaudible). 
THE COURT : Okay. So can you tell the Court what is, I 
guess, your legal right to prohibit an owner, a co-owner of 
the home, from coming into his home? I’m a little bit 
confused about that. 
MS. DAOANG : Yes. Ah, well, the definition of harassment, 
um, is intentional --intentional or knowing course of 
conduct directed on an individual that seriously alarms or 
disturbs consistently or continually that others --
THE COURT : No, I --I know what the definition of 
harassment is. I’m trying to find out what legal right do 
you have to prevent an owner of the property from coming to 
the property? 
MS. DAOANG : Well, when I went to the  property I was being 
harassed.  I was being followed  around the home.  And I 
believe that as a tenant I have rights to decline 
(inaudible) of my tenancy .  
THE COURT : Okay.  But you’re not paying rent.  You don’t 
have any rental agreement or anything with your auntie; right?  
MS. DAOANG : Ah, she allows me to be in the  house.  
THE COURT : I mean you’re -- you’re basically  a guest there. 
You’re not actually a tenant as is defined  under the law; 
right?  
MS. DAOANG : I believe I -- I’m a tenant .  
THE COURT : Okay.  How do you believe you’re  a tenant  -- 
MS. DAOANG : Because I -- 
THE COURT : -- if you’re not paying rent,  there’s no rental 
agreement? You’re just being allowed to  stay there.  
MS. DAOANG : I live in the home and I’ve been  living in the 
home and she told me I can be there .  
THE COURT : Okay.   Well, let’s accept that  for now that 
you’re --  you’re allowed to be there .   So it kind of goes 
back to the question that  I asked earlier is how can you 
prevent somebody who owns  the house from coming to his 
house?  
MS. DAOANG : I wasn’t preventing him in the  beginning, but 
because when I came to the house I was  being harassed -- 
THE COURT : Okay.  When you say you were  being harassed, 
what exactly was he doing?  
13   
 
 
   
   
   
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
   
  
   
   
  
   
 
  
 
  
  
  
 
  
  
   
   
  
  
     
   
  
  
  
  
  
   
   
 
  
 
   
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
   ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
MS. DAOANG : He was making comments to me. Told me I was 
there illegally. He was following me around the house. He 
was just making comments to me. Laughing at me. Recording 
me. 
THE COURT : What --what kind of comments was he making to 
you? 
MS. DAOANG : He told me I was there illegally and I 
shouldn’t be there. And he --I shouldn’t be able to go 
into my room because it used to be his office. 
MR. PERRY : All of this was with the police presence by the 
way. They --they saw me and talked to me for half an hour 
before any of this interaction that she claims (inaudible). 
THE COURT : Ah, ah, oh and okay. Let’s, um, Ms. Daoang, 
let’s --let’s try and fit the script here. Um, what if 
you were --you were faced with the situation that he was 
faced with. In other words, you own a home. You go to 
your home and you find out that somebody’s living there 
that you had no knowledge about. What would your reaction 
be? 
MS. DAOANG : I understand that. But I wouldn’t go to the 
extent to taunt and laugh, antagonize that person. 
THE COURT : You have anything else you wanted to say? 
MR. PERRY : Um, she claims that Carolina called her earlier 
in the day and said that Nick had been acting stupid. To 
lock all the doors and windows. So they were well aware 
that I was coming. She’s acting stupid. I have the text 
messages between me and Ms. Balanza. I said, hey there, is 
there --I said, hey, is there an extra key or anything? 
I’ll be coming by the house later on today. And did your 
sister find [one of the children] yesterday? She never 
responded. That’s what I said. Did your sister find [one 
of the children] . She never responded. Her answer to that 
was, you are not allowed in my house. Three exclamation 
points. And if you need to retrieve something you can wait 
till I get back. And my response was, excuse me? And all 
of our interaction. If anything, I was acting stupid or 
crazy or whatever they want to say, that is --I have 
screenshots of the text messages. They knew and tried to 
lock the house up and everything before I got there. She 
had called, per her statement, Carolina, so they knew I was 
the one that was in the house. They know I’m allowed in 
the house because the TRO’s been dissolved and they still 
went and called the cops. Called her family to come. They 
did the harassing me and intimidating me through this whole 
ordeal. But I haven’t gone to my house in a very long time 
because I’m afraid of coming back to court again because 
she’s hair triggered to call the courts and keep me away 
from my house. 
The district court then ruled as follows: 
THE COURT : Okay. Okay, the Court has listened to the 
testimony of the petitioner and the respondent. And the 
Court has, again, also reviewed the, ah, petition for 
temporary restraining order that had been initially granted 
in this case. Ah, the law requires that there be clear and 
14   
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
   
  
    
 
  
 
 
   
 
   
  
   
 
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
convincing evidence that the past acts of harassment have 
occurred and that the threats of future acts of harassment 
requires the Court to grant an injunction. Um, based on 
the facts and circumstances of this case the Court does not 
believe that the petitioner has met her burden to justify 
the Court granting an injunction in this case. So the 
temporary restraining order that was issued in this case is 
dissolved effective immediately and the matter is, at this 
time, dismissed with prejudice. 
The district court’s order dissolving and dismissing 
the TRO with prejudice was filed on February 26, 2024. 
B. Appellate proceedings 
Daoang filed a pro se notice of appeal on February 28, 
2024. She filed her opening brief on April 18, 2024. On 
appeal, Daoang asserts the district court erred (1) in 
concluding that Daoang was a guest and not a tenant of the 
house, and (2) by using the wrong reasonableness standard 
as to emotional distress. Daoang asserts that the district 
court applied a different “reasonable person ” standard 
based on Daoang’s status as a guest of her aunt rather than 
as a tenant. 
Perry did not file an answering brief, and the I ntermediate 
Court of Appeals entered his default on June 5, 2024. Counsel 
appeared for Daoang on June 17, 2024 and filed a transfer 
application the next day . We granted transfer of the appeal to 
this court on July 8, 2024. 
III. Standard of Review 
We review a [trial] court ’s findings of fact under 
the clearly erroneous standard. A finding of fact is 
clearly erroneous when either the record lacks substantial

support the finding, but we are left with the definite and 
firm conviction in reviewing the entire evidence that a 
mistake has been committed. We review a [trial] court ’s 
conclusions of law de novo under the right/wrong standard. 
Where a conclusion of law presents a mixed question of law 
and fact, we review this conclusion under the clearly 
erroneous standard. A mixed question of law and fact is a 
conclusion dependent upon the facts and circumstances of 
the particular case.

IV. Discussion 
A. We need not decide whether the district court err ed by 
concluding Daoang was not a “tenant” because it did not 
dissolve the TRO based on a mistaken classification of her 
status 
On appeal, Daoang alleges the district court erred by (1)  
concluding she was a guest and not a tenant in the house, and 
(2) applying the wrong reasonableness standard as to emotional 
distress.   The two questions are interrelated;  Daoang asserts 
the district court applied a different reasonable person 
standard based on Daoang’s status as a guest of her  aunt, rather 
than as a tenant,  and thereby applied an erroneous emotional 
distress standard.   Daoang asserts that application of the 
incorrect standard resulted in an erroneous dissolution of the TRO.  
Daoang’s question s relate to the second definition of 
“harassment” in HRS § 604-10.5(a): 
§604-10.5 Power to enjoin and temporarily restrain 
harassment. (a) For the purposes of this section: 
16      “Course of conduct ”  means a pattern of conduct 
composed of a series of acts over any period of time 
evidencing a continuity of purpose .    
 
 
    
         
 
         
 
 
  
   
    
  
   
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
  ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
“Harassment ” means: 
(1) Physical harm, bodily injury, assault, or the 
threat of imminent physical harm, bodily injury, or 
assault; or 
(2) An intentional or knowing course of conduct 
directed at an individual that seriously alarms or disturbs 
consistently or continually bothers the individual and 
serves no legitimate purpose; provided that such course of 
conduct would cause a reasonable person to suffer emotional 
distress . 
HRS § 604-10.5 (emphases added).   In other words, Daoang asserts 
that the district court categorized her as a guest, rather than 
as a tenant, and determined that Perry’s conduct would not have 
caused a reasonable person who was a guest, and not a tenant, to 
suffer emotional distress.    
Daoang’s assertion that t he district court determined her 
to be a guest and not a tenant has merit. The district court ’s 
questions and comments to Daoang, quoted above, clearly indicate 
it concluded Daoang was not a “tenant.” The district court 
apparently based its conclusion on the lack of a written rental 
agreement and a lack of regular rental payments . Although 
neither is required by Hawaiʻi law to create a tenancy,5 we need 
5HRS § 521 -8 (2018) includes the following definitions: 
 . . . . 
“Dwelling unit ” means a structure, or part of a structure, which 
is used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by one person or 
by two or more persons maintaining a common household, to the 
exclusion of all others. 
“Landlord ” means the owner, lessor, sublessor, assigns or 
successors in interest of the dwelling unit or the building of 
which it is a part and in addition means any agent of the 
landlord. 
“Rental agreement ” means all agreements, written or oral, which 
establish or modify the terms, conditions, rules, regulations, or

 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
not decide whether the district court erred by ruling that 
Daoang was a guest and not a tenant . This is because the 
district court ’s categorization of her status is immaterial . 
Contrary to Daoang’s assertion, the dis trict court did not 
dissolve the TRO because it determined Perry’s conduct would not 
have caused a reasonable person who was a guest, and not a 
tenant, to suffer emotional distress. Rather, as explained in 
the next section, the district court dissolved the TRO because 
there was a lack of clear and convincing evidence of acts 
constituting “harassment.” 
B. The district court dissolved the TRO based on a lack of 
acts constituting “harassment” 
HRS § 604 -10.5 contains two alternative definitions of 
“harassment.” The first definition requir es “[p]hysical harm, 
bodily injury, assault, or the threat of imminent physical harm, 
bodily injury, or assault. ” HRS § 604 -10(a)(1). The record 
reflects no evidence of any physical abuse and the district 
court also specifically found no evidence of threats of such 
any other provisions concerning the use and occupancy of a 
dwelling unit and premises. 
. . . . 
“Tenant” means any person who occupies a dwelling unit for 
dwelling purposes under a rental agreement. 
. . . . 
Also, according to HRS § 521 -21(a) (2018), a landlord and tenant may 
agree to any consideration (not otherwise prohibited by law), as rent. 
Daoang indicated that although she did not have a written rental agreement 
with Balanza . Balanza had orally told her she could stay at the house and 
that she helped out as she could. 
18   
 
 
   
 
 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
harm; this was not clearly erroneous, as there was no evidence 
of any threats of physical violence by Perry against Daoang.   
The second definition defines “harassment” as: 
[a]n intentional or knowing course of conduct directed at 
an individual that seriously alarms or disturbs 
consistently or continually bothers the individual and 
serves no legitimate purpose; provided that such course of 
conduct would cause a reasonable person to suffer emotional 
distress. 
HRS § 604-10.5(a)(2).   Under this definition, the question of 
whether a “reasonable person” would “suffer emotional distress” is not reached if there is a lack of clear and convincing 
evidence of a “course of conduct” constituting “harassment.”   
  
“Course of conduct ”  is defined as “a  pattern of conduct 
composed of a series of acts over any period of time evidencing 
a continuity of purpose. ”   HRS § 604-10.5.   Here, by finding a 
lack of “past acts” of harassment, the district court implicitly 
found lacking the requisite “course of conduct.”   As held by the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals in Duarte  v.  Young, a  single  act  
does  not  constitute  a  “course  of  conduct”  so  as  to  meet  the  
definition  of  harassment  under  HRS  §  604–10.5(a)(2).   134 Hawaiʻi  
459, 463, 342 P.3d 878, 882 (App. 2014).   Daoang testified that 
Perry followed her around and engaged in taunting actions 
several times that evening.   But even if we accept as true the 
entirety of Daoang’s testimony, we agree with the district court that this would not constitute clear and convincing evidence of

 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
the “course of conduct” required by HRS § 604 -10.5(a)(2) to 
constitute “harassment.” 
In any event, because there was no clear and convincing 
evidence of a “course of conduct,” the district court did not 
reach the issue of whether a reasonable person in Daoang’s shoes , 
whether as a tenant or guest, would suffer emotional distress 
based on the second definition of harassment . Rather, the 
district court correctly noted that “past acts of harassment” 
were a necessary prerequisite finding to establish a course of 
conduct. Therefore, Daoang’s questions on appeal lack merit. 
C. Whether or not Daoang was a tenant, in cases arising out of 
domestic violence situations, courts should prioritize 
safety 
Although Daoang’s issues on appeal lack merit, we provide 
some guidance in cases related to circumstances involving 
domestic violence.6 
This case arises out of Perry’s exclusion from a house he 
co-owns with Balanza, which occurred after incidents of domestic 
violence between them that led to protective orders. The 
protective orders had expired five months before the incident 
leading to the district court TRO, but Balanza’s ouster of Perry 
from the house had apparently continued. 
HRS § 602 -4 (2016) provides, “ The supreme court shall have the general 
superintendence of all courts of inferior jurisdiction to prevent and correct 
errors and abuses therein where no other remedy is expressly provided by 
law.”

 ** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ** 
In matters arising out of domestic violence situations , 
which impl icate safety concerns, best practices call for judges 
to be aware of other cases relating to the pending case.7 
Daoang’s TRO petition referenced a family court restraining 
order, and the district court appropriately asked about the 
status of that order. 
Under real property law principles, Perry was entitled to 
possession of the house as a co -owner. The record, however, 
indicated Perry had not been at the house since 2022 and that 
Balanza had excluded him from the house. She had apparently 
changed the keys, so Perry entered the house through a window. 
There had been previous domestic violence between Perry and 
Balanza. Although Perry understood Balanza to be out of town, 
he did not know whether others would be present in the house. 
The district court asked Daoang questions such as “I’m 
trying to find out what legal right do you have to prevent an 
owner of the property from coming to the property? ” and “How can 
you prevent somebody who owns the house from coming to his 
house?” The court’s questions might have led Perry to assume 
that his self -help was appropriate. Given the circumstances

here – which suggest a potential for future conflict, including 
between Perry and Balanza – the court could have appropriately 
suggested other legal avenues through which the parties might be 
able to assert their rights. This could include information 
regarding neighborhood mediation centers or lawyer referral 
services. 
V. Conclusion 
For the reasons explained above, however, w e affirm the 
district court’s February 26, 2024 order dissolving and 
dismissing the TRO with prejudice.
