SCAP-24-0000393 
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CAAP-24-0000393; CASE NO. 2CCV-23-0000325) 
 
DECEMBER 30, 2025 
 
McKENNA, ACTING C.J., EDDINS, GINOZA, AND DEVENS, JJ., AND 
CIRCUIT JUDGE KAWASHIMA, ASSIGNED BY REASON OF VACANCY 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J. 
Class representative plaintiffs Christopher Piezko and 
Janel Lee Piezko (Piezkos) own real property in Kīhei, Maui.
 
They use the property as a “vacation home for personal use.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
 In 2021 the County of Maui (County) reclassified the 
Piezkos’ property 
as a “short-term rental” based on zoning 
rather than actual use. The Piezkos paid the resulting higher 
real property taxes. But they did not appeal their tax 
assessments through the administrative process established by 
the County, that is to the Maui County Board of Review (BOR). 
Instead, the Piezkos filed a class action suit in the 
Circuit Court of the Second Circuit.  As the class plaintiffs’ 
representatives, the Piezkos sought a refund of the additional 
taxes they paid. Plaintiffs alleged that the County unjustly 
enriched itself by retaining unconstitutionally-collected taxes 
and violated their due process rights. 
The County moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of 
subject matter jurisdiction. The County argued that Plaintiffs 
should have “avail[ed] themselves” of Maui County’s administrative appeals process by first appealing to the BOR, 
and then, if necessary, to the Tax Appeal Court (TAC). 
We hold that the 
circuit court correctly dismissed the case 
for lack of jurisdiction.  Under Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) 
chapter 232 and Maui County Code (MCC) chapter 3.48, the TAC has 
exclusive jurisdiction over real property tax assessment 
appeals, including those raising constitutional challenges. Because Plaintiffs failed to follow the proper appeals 
2  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
 
   procedure, and their potential appeal is now time-barred, we 
affirm the circuit court dismissal. 
I. 
On December 4, 2020, the Maui County Council passed 
Ordinance 5160. SeeMaui, Hawaiʻi, Ordinance No. 5160 (Dec. 5, 
2020). The next day, the mayor signed the ordinance into law. 
Ordinance 5160 amended MCC § 3.48.305.C.2 by expanding the “short-term rental” condominium classification to include vacant 
units and those “occupied by transient tenants for periods of 
less than six consecutive months.”  Those units would be 
classified as short-term rentals if they were located in an area permitting transient vacation rentals.  Critically, the new law 
included “units occupied by the owner for personal use” — 
vacation homes like the Piezkos’. 
The County Director of Finance projected that Ordinance 
5160 would result in the reclassification of 1,428 properties 
and increase tax revenue by $9,127,582. See Letter from Michael 
P. Victorino, Maui Mayor, to Keani Rawlins-Fernandez, Economic Development and Budget Committee Chair, Maui County Council 
(Nov. 2, 2020), 
https://mauicounty.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=8891167&GUID=A
2 
E983BD-3CC5-4180-91F5-1F442E715EB2 [https://perma.cc/GX69-MV48]. 
The new law was only applicable for one tax year. SeeMaui, 
Hawaiʻi, Ordinance No. 5159 (Jan. 1, 2022).  Effective January 1, 
3  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
 
  
   
 
  
 2022, Ordinance 5159 repealed the short-term rental 
classification. See id. Consequently, Ordinance 5160 applied 
only to the 2021 tax assessment year (July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022). 
The Piezkos paid their 2021 real property tax bills at the 
higher short-term rental rates. However, they did not appeal 
their tax assessments to the BOR or TAC within the time periods 
prescribed by law. 
On October 18, 2023, the Piezkos filed a class action 
complaint in circuit court against the County of Maui seeking damages for the 2021 real property taxes collected under 
Ordinance 5160. (Because the Piezkos are class representatives, 
this opinion uses “Piezkos” and “Plaintiffs” interchangeably.) 
Relying on the outcome of an unrelated tax appeal (filed by a property’s trust, which, like the Piezkos, was taxed under the 
ordinance), Plaintiffs claimed that Ordinance 5160 was 
unconstitutional. Plaintiffs though did not directly challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance. 
Instead, Plaintiffs maintained that the constitutional 
issue had already been decided in the other tax appeal. 
Plaintiffs’ complaint alleged that the County failed to provide 
adequate pre-deprivation and post-deprivation remedies in violation of their due process rights, and that the County 
wrongfully collected and retained real property taxes, which 
4  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 constituted unjust enrichment. They sought compensatory 
damages, prejudgment interest, and attorney fees. 
The County moved to dismiss  on jurisdictional grounds. The 
County  argued that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction because  
(1) HRS § 632-1 precluded the circuit court’s jurisdiction, and 
(2) the case belonged in the TAC per HRS chapter 232 and MCC 
chapter 3.48. The circuit court granted the County’s motion and 
dismissed Plaintiffs’ case with prejudice.  
Plaintiffs 
appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals. 
The County applied for transfer to this court. We accepted 
transfer. 
II. 
Plaintiffs present two questions: (1) whether the circuit 
court erred in ruling that it lacked jurisdiction, and (2) 
whether, under the issue preclusion doctrine, the TAC’s prior decision in the unrelated tax appeal binds Maui County. A. HRS § 632-1 does not apply because Plaintiffs did not seek 
declaratory relief 
We start with jurisdiction. 
Both parties invoke HRS § 632-1 (2016). That statute 
governs declaratory judgments.  It reads: 
In cases of actual controversy, courts of record, 
within the scope of their respective jurisdictions, shall 
have power to make binding adjudications of right, whether 
or not consequential relief is, or at the time could be, 
claimed, and no action or proceeding shall be open to objection on the ground that a judgment or order merely 
declaratory of right is prayed for; provided that 
5  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 declaratory relief may not be obtained in any district 
court, or in any controversy with respect to taxes, or in 
any case where a divorce or annulment of marriage is 
sought. 
HRS § 632-1(a) (emphases added). 
HRS § 632-1 expressly prohibits declaratory relief in tax 
controversies. Per the statute, plaintiffs may not obtain 
declaratory relief “in any controversy with respect to taxes.” 
Id. 
Plaintiffs maintain that HRS § 632-1 doesn’t bar circuit 
court jurisdiction because they didn’t seek declaratory relief. 
Plaintiffs rely on 
Tax Foundation of Hawaiʻi v. State
, 144 
Hawaiʻi 175, 439 P.3d 127 (2019). There, this court held that 
declaratory relief may be obtained in tax matters under HRS 
§ 632-1 when such relief does not interfere with tax assessment 
or collection. Id
. at 188, 439 P.3d at 140. Because their 
complaint does not seek preemptive declaratory relief against tax assessment or collection, Plaintiffs claim that HRS § 632-1 
does not bar jurisdiction. And even if they had sought 
declaratory relief, the circuit court would still have 
jurisdiction, they insist, because the relief they seek now does 
not interfere with the assessment or collection of taxes. 
The County counters that this case involves a tax 
controversy that blocks the circuit court’s jurisdiction under 
HRS § 632-1. The County points to Ocean Resort Villas Vacation 
Owners Ass’n v. Cnty. of Maui
, 147 Hawaiʻi 544, 465 P.3d 991 
6  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
   
 
 
   
 (2020). The Ocean Resort plaintiffs sought declaratory relief 
to void Maui’s real property timeshare tax.  Id. at 556, 465 
P.3d at 1003. Because that action would “interfere with the assessment or collection of taxes,” this court determined there 
was a tax controversy. Id.And because the case involved both 
a tax controversy and a declaratory judgment action, we held that HRS § 632-1 divested the circuit court of jurisdiction, 
leaving the TAC with exclusive jurisdiction. Id. Per HRS 
§ 632-1, declaratory judgment action plus tax controversy equals 
no circuit court jurisdiction. 
Significantly, both Ocean Resort and Tax Foundation  
involved declaratory judgment actions. See Ocean Resort, 147 
Hawaiʻi 544, 465 P.3d 991; Tax Foundation, 144 Hawaiʻi 175, 439 
P.3d 127. So did another similar case,  Hawaii Insurers Council  
v. Lingle, 120 Hawaiʻ i 51, 201 P.3d 564 (2008).  Assessing 
jurisdiction under HRS § 632-1 made sense in those cases because 
the plaintiffs expressly sought declaratory relief.  
But h
ere, Plaintiffs did not file a declaratory judgment 
action. And Plaintiffs consistently stress that they do not 
seek declaratory relief. Without a request for declaratory 
judgment, Plaintiffs believe, HRS § 632-1 is not dispositive of 
the jurisdictional question. 
The County protests that Plaintiffs’ choice not to seek a 
declaratory judgment is just strategy – a stab to avoid the 
7  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
  proper appeals process. The County suggests that Plaintiffs’ 
claims inherently require declaratory relief, even though they 
did not request it. 
We acknowledge that under Hawaiʻ i Rules of Civil Procedure 
Rule 54(c), every final judgment shall grant the relief to whic
h 
the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the party has not demanded such relief in the party pleadings. See 
10 Mary Kay Kane & Adam N. Steinman,
 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. 
§ 2664 (4th ed. Sep. 2025 update); 10B Mary Kay Kane & Adam N. 
Steinman, Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 2768 (4th ed. Sep. 2025 
update); Chambrella v. Rutledge, 69 Haw. 271, 285, 740 P.2d 
1008, 1016 (1987). However, this rule says nothing about whether a court should grant relief that plaintiffs explicitly 
disavow. In any event, this question does not ultimately affect 
our jurisdictional analysis. If a court has jurisdiction, it 
may grant equitable relief, including declaratory judgments. 
See Ching v. Case, 145 Hawaiʻ i 148, 165, 449 P.3d 1146, 1163 
(2019). But the court must first have jurisdiction. 
 
We decline to construe 
Plaintiffs’ suit as a declaratory 
judgment action. Because Plaintiffs do not seek declaratory 
relief, HRS § 632-1 does not apply. 
8  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
 B. The TAC has jurisdiction over real property tax assessment 
appeals and related constitutional challenges 
We hold that the TAC has exclusive jurisdiction over this 
real property tax assessment appeal. The circuit court 
correctly ruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. 
“[A]s a general matter, subject matter jurisdiction rests 
in the tax appeal court to hear taxpayer ‘appeals’ from assessments [under HRS chapter 232]; challenges to taxes paid 
under protest [under HRS § 40-35]; and adverse rulings by the 
[Director].” Grace Bus. Dev. Corp. v. Kamikawa
, 92 Hawaiʻi 608, 
612, 994 P.2d 540, 544 (2000) (citations omitted). HRS § 232-11 
(2017) provides that the TAC “shall . . . have jurisdiction 
throughout the State with respect to matters within its 
jurisdiction.”  Matters within the TAC’s jurisdiction include 
appeals of real property tax assessments on grounds of (1) certain over-valuations of property, (2) lack of uniformity or 
inequality, (3) denial of exemptions a taxpayer is entitled to 
or qualified for, and (4) illegality, including unconstitutionality. HRS § 232-3 (2017). 
To effectuate this appeals process, taxpayers “may appeal 
directly to the tax appeal court,” but only if the taxpayers 
“first obtain a decision from an administrative body establishe
d 
by county ordinance[] . . . if [the] county ordinance requires a taxpayer to do so.” See HRS § 232-16 (2017 & Supp. 2021). The 
9  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
 
 MCC requires this intermediate step: “In the case of a real 
property tax appeal, a taxpayer shall first appeal to the County 
board of review, pursuant to section 232-16, Hawaiʻ i Revised 
Statutes.”  MCC § 
3.48.595 (emphasis added). Thus, both the MCC 
and HRS § 232-16 require taxpayers to appeal to the County BOR 
first. Later, if the taxpayer disagrees with the BOR’s 
decision, they may appeal to the TAC. HRS § 232-17 (Supp. 
2021). 
Similar to appeals to the TAC, real property taxes may be 
appealed to the BOR for (1) certain over-valuations of property, (2) lack of uniformity or inequality, (3) denial of exemptions  
or certain tax credits a taxpayer is entitled to or qualified 
for, and (4) illegality, including unconstitutionality. See MCC 
§ 3.48.605. The BOR may decide all questions of fact and law, 
except those involving the Constitution or laws of the United 
States. MCC § 3.48.625. The taxpayer must raise any 
constitutional objections in their appeal to the BOR to preserve 
them for argument on any subsequent appeal to the TAC. MCC 
§ 3.48.655; HRS § 232-15 (Supp. 2021)  (“If any objection 
involving the Constitution or laws of the United States is 
included by the taxpayer in the notice of appeal, the objection  
may be heard and determined by the tax appeal court on appeal from a decision of the taxation board of review[.]”).  
10  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
 
 The TAC’s jurisdiction is “limited to the amount of 
valuation or taxes[.]” HRS § 232-13 (Supp. 2021). Still, the 
TAC “shall have the power and authority . . . to decide all 
questions of fact and all questions of law, including 
constitutional questions, involved [in the appeal].” HRS § 232-
11. 
The circuit court is “without authority to exercise general 
jurisdiction . . . where doing so [is] precluded by HRS chapter 
232 and MCC chapter 3.48.” Ocean Resort
, 147 Hawaiʻi at 559, 465 
P.3d at 1006. 
Ocean Resort specifically addressed challenges to real 
property tax assessments premised on illegality and 
unconstitutionality. Because “HRS chapter 232 and MCC chapter 
3.48 provided the process by which Taxpayers could bring their 
challenges to the legality and constitutionality of the real 
property . . . tax classification and rates,” the circuit court 
lacked subject matter jurisdiction over challenges to real 
property tax assessments  brought  on these grounds.  Id. 
Here, HRS chapter 232 and MCC chapter 3.48 
both preclude 
the circuit court’s exercise of jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims. 
Plaintiffs try to dodge the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
TAC by arguing that they do not plead illegality or 
unconstitutionality of the underlying tax ordinance, and do not 
11  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
  
 
  seek a declaratory action subject to HRS § 632-1. Yet in their 
own words, Plaintiffs seek a “refund or adjustment” of real 
estate property taxes they paid due to the “unconstitutional 
Ordinance 5160.” This is, definitionally, an appeal of a real 
property tax assessment premised on grounds that the underlying ordinance is unconstitutional, and therefore illegal. See HRS 
§ 232-3. Such appeals fall within the TAC’s jurisdiction. 
Thus, we hold that the TAC has exclusive jurisdiction over 
Plaintiffs’ claims. To hold otherwise would elevate form over 
substance, a disfavored approach. See Rodriguez v. Mauna Kea 
Resort LLC, 156 Hawaiʻ i 289, 295, 574 P.3d 309, 315 (2025). 
Plaintiffs aspire to reframe a straightforward tax assessment appeal as a general civil action by styling their claims as 
challenging
 due process violations and unjust enrichment rather 
than as a direct challenge to the tax assessment. However, the 
substance of their claims — contesting and seeking remedies for 
the collection of higher taxes paid under an allegedly 
unconstitutional ordinance — places them squarely within the 
TAC’s jurisdiction. 
As Ocean Resort 
instructs, Plaintiffs should have followed 
the tax appeal procedures clearly described in HRS chapter 232 
and MCC chapter 3.48. 147 Hawaiʻi at 555, 465 P.3d at 1002. 
This process “require[s] an appeal of assessments to the County 
12  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
 
 
 
 
  BOR and TAC, even for questions involving the constitutionality 
or illegality of an assessment.” Id. 
We hold that the TAC has exclusive jurisdiction under HRS 
chapter 232 and MCC chapter 3.48. 
C. Plaintiffs’ claims are time-barred 
Even if Plaintiffs had filed their appeal in the proper 
place, their claims are untimely. The tax appeal procedures under HRS chapter 232 and MCC chapter 3.48 control. “HRS chapter 232 . . . reinforces the primacy of the tax appeal 
procedures set forth in [c]ounty codes like MCC chapter 3.48, 
titled ‘Real Property Tax.’” Ocean Resort
, 147 Hawaiʻi at 557, 
465 P.3d at 1004. 
Per MCC § 3.48.595, 
“[a]ppeals to the County board of 
review shall be filed on or before April 9 preceding the tax 
year.” Here, Ordinance 5160 only applied to the 2021 real 
property tax assessment year (July 1, 2021 - June 30, 2022). 
Thus, Plaintiffs’ real property tax assessment appeals deadline 
was April 9, 2021. See MCC § 3.48.595. 
The County issued the real property tax assessment for the 
Piezkos’ property in January 2021. Plaintiffs sued in circuit 
court in October 2023 – more than two and a half years after the 
deadline. So even if they had appealed to the right place (the 
BOR), their appeal would have been late. 
13  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 A remedy existed to give Plaintiffs the relief they wanted. 
But they failed to pursue it within the prescribed time. The 
appeal window has closed. 
Plaintiffs suggest that the window for filing an appeal was 
unreasonably short. Their position lacks merit. Plaintiffs’ 
briefing frequently cited to an unrelated TAC case, where a 
taxpayer trust successfully challenged Ordinance 5160 on 
constitutional grounds. Unlike Plaintiffs, that taxpayer 
complied with the statutory deadlines by timely filing with the 
BOR and subsequently appealing to the TAC, establishing that 
others subjected to the same timeframes navigated the procedural 
requirements. 
Further, the Maui County Council passed Ordinance 5160 in 
December 2020. It even created a “frequently asked questions” 
web page explaining the implications of the new ordinance. See 
Maui County, Frequently Asked Questions: Real Property Tax – Short-Term Rental Classification, https://www.mauicounty.gov/FAQ.aspx?TID=140 
[https://perma.cc/H2ST-KWG8]. Under these circumstances, 
Plaintiffs had adequate time to file an appeal with the BOR. 
The taxpayer trust in the unrelated case received a refund 
because it followed the proper procedures for appeal.  We 
decline to override the clearly delineated procedures 
established by Maui County for tax appeals. These procedures 
14  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
   
  
 have been tested and proven effective in other cases, including 
one premised on the same ordinance, with the same timeline for 
appeal, that Plaintiffs challenge here. 
Because Plaintiffs failed to follow the established 
administrative procedures and their claims are now time-barred, 
we need not address their second question regarding issue 
preclusion. 
We also hold that because Plaintiffs failed to follow the 
procedural process governing real property tax appeals, Plaintiffs’ contention that they were deprived of pre- and post-
deprivation relief in violation of their due process rights 
lacks merit. Appellants under our real property tax appeals procedures are entitled to refunds if the BOR or TAC lower over-
assessments on appeal, on grounds including illegality or 
constitutionality. See HRS §§ 232-3, 232-11; MCC §§ 3.48.605, 
3.48.625, 3.48.655. Given Plaintiffs’ access to post-deprivation relief, Plaintiffs’ argument that alleged unconstitutionality requires pre-deprivation and post-
deprivation relief untethered to the existing framework for tax 
appeals lacks merit.  See Matter of Hawaiian Flour Mills, Inc.
, 
76 Hawaiʻi 1, 5, 868 P.2d 419, 423 (1994) (evaluating due process 
remedies following valid appeal to the TAC). 
15  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
  
 
 
 III. 
We hold that the TAC has 
exclusive jurisdiction over 
Plaintiffs’ tax refund claims and related constitutional 
challenges, and therefore the circuit court correctly dismissed 
their case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 
The judgment of the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit is 
affirmed.
