STATE OF HAWAI ʻI,  
Plaintiff-Appellee,  
 
 
vs. 
 
 
FRANK O. LOHER,  
Defendant-Appellant.  
 
 
(ICA CASE NO. 24489; CR. NO. 99-1621)
 
This case arises from the nearly seventeen-year old 
conviction of Frank O. Loher for attempted sexual assault in the 
first degree. At trial, Loher sought to present an alibi 
defense based in large part on the testimony of his wife and his  
 
 
  
  
  
  
   
 
 
 
 
    
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
wife’s son. Although the trial was anticipated to last between 
five and six days, the State rested its case-in-chief in the 
early afternoon on the first day of the evidentiary portion of 
the trial. When the circuit court informed defense counsel that 
the defense’s witnesses would be required to testify that day, 
counsel sought a continuance to secure the witnesses’ presence 
so that they could testify first. The circuit court denied the 
requested continuance, and, over defense couns el’s objection, 
the court ordered Loher to either take the stand at that time or 
forfeit his right to testify entirely. As a result, Loher took 
the stand and testified before the other witnesses in the 
defense’s case. 
Following his conviction and his unsuccessful appeal, 
Loher sought relief in state and federal post-conviction 
proceedings. As a result of the post-conviction proceedings, 
the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ June 19, 2003 judgment on direct appeal was vacated so that Loher could raise a claim that 
his constitutional rights were violated when the circuit court 
ordered him to testify first or not at all. Loher’s case 
requires this court to consider whether the circuit court erred 
based on principles set forth in the United States Supreme 
Court’s decision in Brooks v. Tennessee , 406 U.S. 605 (1972), 
the Hawai
i Constitution, and Hawai i caselaw, and, if the court 
erred, whether the error is subject to harmless error review. 
2
  
 
 
   
  
  On August 19, 1999, Loher was indicted by a grand jury 
for attempted sexual assault in the first degree, in violation  
of HRS § 705-500 (1993) and HRS § 707-730(1)(a) (1993)  (count 
one), and attempted kidnapping , in violation of HRS § 707 -
720(1)(d) (1993)  (count two).  Loher v. State , 118 Hawai i 522,  
524, 193 P.3d 438, 
440 (App. 2008), overruled on other grounds 
by State v. Auld , 136 Hawai i  244, 361 P.3d 471 (2015).  The 
State filed a “Memorandum of Pretrial” on  December 9, 1999, 
stating that the trial was expected to take five to six days. 
Id.  On November 13, 2000, the State filed  its “Witness and 
Exhibit List”  identifying fourteen witnesses   for the State.  Id.

I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
A. Circuit Court Trial 
Loher and the State each filed motions in limine 
relating to the evidence to be presented at trial. Id. During 
the hearing on the parties’ motions, Loher stated that he intended to present an alibi defense 
and establish that he was 
not present during the attempted sexual assault and kidnapping. Id. Loher’s counsel represented to the court that Loher would 
testify at trial, but at various times he also expressed the possibility that Loher would choose not to take the stand.

2011) (mem.).

  The evidentiary portion of the jury trial commenced at 
1 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, November 14, 2000.   The State first called 
Honolulu Police Department (HPD) Officer Oryn Baum. Officer 
Baum testified that on July 29, 1999, at approximately 3:43  
a.m., she was dispatched to  an industrial area  at 2722 Kakoi  
Street. Once she arrived, she was flagged down by a female   
identified by Officer Baum as the complaining witness.  Officer 
Baum stated that the complaining witness ’s halter top was 
ripped, and the officer observed a   “kind of a scratch ”  on her 
back.   The complaining witness described her  assailant, the 
vehicle he was driving, and the vehicle’s  license plate number.   
The vehicle was subsequently identified by Officer Baum  as 
belonging to Frank and Andrea Loher.   Following Officer Baum’s 
testimony, the State called an HPD fingerprint identification  
technician who testified that five sets of fingerprints were  
recovered from Loher’s car  but that none were a match to the 
complaining witness.  
   The State then called the complaining witness.  
complainant testified that in the early morning hours of July  
29, 1999, she was walking along Kapi olani Boulevard  when she  
accepted an offer of a ride to the airport from an individual  
                                                        
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
1 The Honorable Dexter D. Del Rosario presided over the trial.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
with whom she was not acquainted who was driving a red car.  The 
witness made an in-court identification of Loher as the driver. 
The complaining witness related that after the driver 
got on the freeway, she fell asleep. When she woke up, the car 
was parked. The driver then demanded oral sex. As she tried to 
exit the vehicle, the complaining witness described that the 
driver ripped her shirt and scratched her back in an attempt to 
keep her inside of the car. She then ran out of the car to a 
nearby pay phone, which she used to call police.  The complainant identified pictures presented by the State of the 
alleged crime scene and Loher’s vehicle . 
Following the lunch recess, the defense began its 
cross-examination of the complaining witness. The complainant 
confirmed that earlier in the evening and prior to the incident, 
she fought with her boyfriend because he got into a car with 
three other girls, and she did not want to see him with the other girls. The complaining witness clarified that she was 
walking because she wanted to go to the airport; she believed 
that if she could get to the airport, she could obtain free 
airline tickets from her boyfriend’s uncle who worked for an 
airline. Following this testimony, at 1:39 p.m., HPD Detective 
Earl Takahashi was called by the State and testified that the 
complaining witness identified Loher as the driver in a 
photographic lineup. 
5
  
 
 
   After the conclusion of  Detective Takahashi’s 
testimony, the State rested its case  at approximately 2:15  p.m.   
The court recessed, and at 2:27 p.m., the court reconvened  
outside the presence of the jury. Loher’s counsel requested a 
continuance until the next trial day on Thursday morning  because 
he “had no idea that [the State] would finish  [its case] this  
early,”  given that the State had “quite a number  of people on 
the witness list. ”   Counsel stated that  he told  the defense 
witnesses to prepare to testify on Thursday;  he related that he  
tried to “make a couple calls ”  to secure the presence of defense  
witnesses that day, but they were not available.  Defense 
counsel apologized  but stated that “it’s too quick for us to 
have to present witne sses under the circumstances.”  
  
  
 
  
  
                                                        
   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The circuit court denied the 
continuance request, 
citing Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 611 (1993) and noting 
that there was more than enough time left in the day to proceed 
2with trial. The court stated that it would “allow the defense 
to call Mr. Loher to testify” at that time. Defense counsel 
2 HRE Rule 611(a) provides as follows: 
The court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode 
and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting 
evidence so as to (1) make the interrogat
ion and 
presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect 
witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.  
HRE Rule 611(a) (1993). 
6
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 So, in fact, now that we’ re being forced to call him 
as first witness in a sense is prejudicial to Mr. Loher 
because he’ s being forced to testify when he, in essence, 
we had not decided fully whether or not he would testify for sure.  
 
 
 Defense counsel was free to discuss with the State 
the witnesses called and when t
hey would anticipate 
finishing their case.  
 Defense counsel has hopefully prepared for this case, 
so should be aware at the present time what the witnesses 
that he intends to call will testify. And having prepared 
and having a knowledge as to what they will say, since they 
are the defense witnesses, then they should be in the 
position to know whether the defendant should testify.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
objected, noting that Loher had a right not to testify and that 
depending on the testimony of the other witnesses, Loher may  
choose not to take the stand.  Counsel further argued that the 
court was essentially forcing Loher to testify.  
[Defense counsel]: . . . the Court is actually forcing 
[Loher] to take the stand because now we have nobody to 
call, and you’re saying, Well, we can call Mr. Loher, but 
as a strategic manner in planning for our case, he was going to be the last witness I call, and depending how it 
went with the other witnesses, we may not need to call him 
because we can get everything that we need through the 
other witnesses. 
The court stated that it found defense counsel’s argument 
unpersuasive because it was counsel’s responsibility to prepare 
for trial.  
The Court: The Court does not find the argument persuasive.  
The Court believes that it was the responsibility or is the 
responsibility of counsel to determine when witnesses would 
be available. 
The court also stated that defense counsel had represented that 
Loher would testify concerning his alibi defense and suggested  
that defense counsel’s objection to Loher testifying that day 
was manipulative.  
7
  
 
 
  
 
 
 The Court would also note that during the pretrial 
conferences, as well as in the opening statement, the 
defendant has asserted an alibi that he was not present at 
the time, and that where the --  his location would be 
during certain times defense counsel has also represented 
to the Court that his client is going to  testify.  
 The Court is not persuaded by his argument and is 
concerned that this may be manipulative in order to obtain 
the relief that the Court had not granted.  
 
 
 
 So I’m going to take a recess, and before we do that, 
is your client going to testify or is he going to waive his 
right to testify?  
  The court reconvened at 2:43 p.m., and the defense 
called Loher to testify.  Loher stated that he was working on ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The Court: . . . So the Court believes it is not persuasive 
that defense counsel should now argue to this Court, after 
the Court had denied his request to delay the trial till 
Thursday by saying that he does not know what his own 
witnesses will say and depending what they say, he will 
then make the decision whether his client's going to 
testify. 
When defense counsel requested permission to respond to the 
court’s concerns, the court refused, stating that it was 
unpersuaded by counsel’s argument and direct ing counsel to call  
Loher to testify or waive his testimony.  
[Defense counsel]: Well, if I can respond. 
The Court: Excuse me, and the Court is unpersuaded by your 
argument. So we’re going to proceed. You may call your 
client to testify, or if you wish, not to testify or engage 
in Tachibana at this time, and he may waive his testimony. 
That is between you and your client. 
In response to the court’s question whether Loher would testify 
or waive his right to testify, defense counsel responded, “I’d 
like to discuss that matter with him.” The court then  recessed 
so that defense counsel could discuss with Loher whether he 
would testify.

the night in question. When his shift ended at approximately 
1:00 a.m. on the morning of July 29, he visited his wife, 
Andrea, at the hospital where she worked.  Loher left the 
hospital, went to his place of residence, and spoke with his 
wife on the phone, and he then slept from approximately 3:30 
a.m. until 4:00 a.m.   Loher testified that he left his residence  
at around 4:30 a.m.  to pick up Andrea’s son, Moses, visit with 
Andrea at the hospital, and drive Moses to work. Loher also 
testified that he had previously served in the United States 
3 Army. 
   On cross -examination, the State elicited testimony 
that Loher had been dishonorably discharged from the United  
States Army. Loher acknowledged that in a prior statement to 
Detective Takahashi, he did not say anything about  speaking with 
his wife on the phone after leaving the hospital.   Additionally, 
Loher confirmed that he told Detective Takahashi that he left 
his residence  to pick up Moses at 5:30 a.m., rather than at 4:30 
a.m. as he had testified on direct examination.  Loher also  
agreed that he told Detective Takahashi that no one  else had  
                                                        
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
3 After defense counsel finished his direct examination of Loher, 
the circuit court granted the State’s motion for the court to reconsider its 
ruling on a motion in limine excluding evidence of Loher’s dishonorable 
discharge from the United States Army. The court ruled that the State could establish that Loher was dishonorably discharged. 
9
  
 
 
    
 
  When trial resumed on  Thursday, November 16,  2000,  the 
defense called Moses and Andrea to the stand. Andrea testified 
that Loher arrived at the hospital to visit with her shortly 
before 2:00 a.m. and that he left at around 2:35 a.m.  Andrea 
stated that after Loher left the hospital and returned to his 
residence, she spoke with him on the phone twice, with the 
second call occurring at approximately 3:15 a.m. and lasting for  
fifteen to twenty minutes. Andrea called Loher again at around 
4:00 a.m. to wake him up so that he could take Moses to work. 
On cross-examination, Andrea admitted that some of her 
statements at trial were inconsistent with her prior statements 
to Detective Takahashi, and she further acknowledged that she 
had not told the detective that she called Loher at 4:00 a.m. to 
wake him up. 
   
 
 
  The State then called three rebuttal witnesses  who 
testified regarding Loher’s place of residence and appearance on the day of the incident  and Andrea’s prior statements to HPD . ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
access to his car the night that the incident occurred. After 
Loher finished testifying, the court recessed for the day. 
Moses testified that Loher arrived to pick him up at 
about 4:45 a.m. on the morning of July 29. Moses stated that 
Loher drove him to visit with Andrea at the hospital and then to 
work, where they arrived at about 6:00 a.m.

   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In closing arguments given that same day, both the State and the 
defense described the case as resting largely on credibility. 
The jury found Loher guilty of count one, attempted 
sexual assault in the first degree.4 On July 18, 2001, Loher was 
sentenced to an extended term of life imprisonment with the 
possibility of parole, subject to a repeat-offender mandatory 
minimum of thirteen years and four months. The court ordered 
Loher to serve his term of life imprisonment consecutively to 
sentences he was currently serving in unrelated matters.5 
B. Direct Appeal (No. 24489) 
Prior to sentencing, trial counsel withdrew as Loher’s 
counsel, and appellate counsel was appointed to represent Loher.6 
On appeal, Loher challenged the jury instructions, the 
sufficiency of the evidence, and his sentence; he also raised a 
claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  Appellate 
counsel did not raise the issue of Loher being forced to testify before the other defense witnesses. The ICA rejected Loher’s 
claims and affirmed his conviction and sentence.  See State v.  
4 The jury concluded that count two, attempted kidnapping, had 
merged with the offense charged in count one; thus, Loher was not convicted 
of count two. 
5 Loher has since fully served the prior sentences and is currently 
serving the sentence imposed in this case. See  Loher v. Thomas , 2016 WL 
4745164

Loher (Loher I ), No. 24489, 2003 WL 1950475 (App. Apr. 21, 2003) 
(mem.). Loher unsuccessfully sought certiorari review. 
C. Post-Conviction Proceedings 
Thereafter, Loher engaged in post-conviction 
litigation in both state and federal court on the following 
three claims: (1) the circuit court violated his constitutional 
rights by forcing him to testify before any of his witnesses or 
not at all, in violation of Brooks v. Tennessee , 406 U.S. 605 
(1972); (2) appellate counsel 
rendered ineffective assistance of 
counsel by failing to raise the Brooks forced testimony issue on 
direct appeal; and (3) the enhancement of his sentence based on 
facts found by the 
circuit court judge violated Apprendi v. New 
Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000). 
i. State Post-Conviction Proceedings 
In State v. Loher ( Loher II), No. 26000, 2005 WL 
335234 (App. Feb. 11, 2005) (mem.), the ICA rejected Loher’s 
Apprendi claim and affirmed the circuit court’s denial of 
Loher’s motion for correction of sentence under Hawai i Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 35 (1993). 
In Loher v. State (Loher III), 118 Hawai i 522, 539, 
193 P.3d 438, 455 (App. 2008), overruled on other grounds by  
State v. Auld, 136 Hawai i 244, 361 P.3d 471 (2015), the ICA 
affirmed in part and vacated in part the circuit court’s denial

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of an HRPP Rule 40 petition submitted by Loher.  Specifically, 
the ICA noted that Loher’s HRPP Rule 40 petition could be 
construed to raise a claim that appellate counsel was 
ineffective for failing to raise the Brooks forced testimony 
issue on direct appeal.  118 Hawai i at 532, 193 P.3d at 448. 
The ICA concluded that the circuit court erred in denying the 
HRPP Rule 40 petition without holding a hearing on the 
ineffective assistance of counsel issue, and it therefore 
remanded the case to the circuit court for an HRPP Rule 40 
hearing. Id. at 539, 193 P.3d at 455. 
In Loher v. State  (Loher IV), No. 29818, 2011 WL 
2132828 (App. May 31, 2011) (mem.), the ICA reviewed the circuit court’s denial of Loher’s HRPP Rule 40 petition following the 
hearing conducted on remand pursuant to Loher III . The ICA 
recounted various parts of the testimony that we 
re presented at 
the hearing on remand.7 The ICA determined that the circuit 
7 The ICA noted, inter alia, the following: (1) Loher testified 
that he “did not want to testify” at trial and “felt forced to testify when 
the judge threatened to ‘end the trial right there on the spot’”; (2) L oher 
further stated that he repeatedly told trial counsel that he did not want to 
testify; (3) trial counsel testified that it appeared that Loher “always 
wanted to testify,” that Loher would testify “no matter what,” and that 
although he preferred for Loh er to testify last, “the altered order of the 
testimony ‘[didn’t] change things that much’” because Loher needed to testify 
to a critical time period that his other witnesses, Andrea and Moses, could 
not account for; (4) and appellate counsel testified that he had not been 
aware of any legal precedent on the issue of forced testimony and that he did 
not raise the issue on direct appeal for this reason. Loher IV, 2011 WL 
2132828
, at *4 (alteration in original). 
13
  
 
 
court denied Loher’s HRPP Rule 40 petition because Loher had 
already decided to testify prior to trial and because trial 
counsel was at fault for not having defense witnesses ready to 
testify after the State rested its case. Id.  at *4-5.  The ICA 
concluded that its opinion in State v. Kido, 102 
Hawaii 369, 76  
P.3d 612 (App. 2003), had created several exceptions to the  rule 
set forth in the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in  Brooks v.  
Tennessee, 406 U.S. 605 (1972),  and that at least two of these 
exceptions applied in Loher’s case. Loher IV , 2011 WL 2132828 ,  
at *6-9.  The ICA therefore ruled that the circuit court 
correctly concluded  that appellate counsel’s failure to raise 
the Brooks  forced testimony issue  on appeal  did not amount to 
ineffective assistance of counsel.   Id. at *10.    The Loher IV  
court thus affirmed the circuit court’s denial of Loher’s HRPP 
8  Rule 40 petition. Id.
   
  
 
   
                                                        
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
ii. Federal Habeas Proceedings 
Following the ICA’s decision in Loher IV , Loher, 
represented by the federal public defender’s office, sought 
habeas relief in federal district court. 
In Loher v. Thomas (Loher V), Civ. No. 11-00731 LEK -
KSC, 2013 WL 8561780 (D. Haw. Oct. 2, 2013), United States 
8 Loher’s request for certiorari review of the ICA’s decision in 
Loher IV was denied by this court with two justices dissenting. See Loher v.  
State, No. SCWC- 29818, 2011 WL 5926184 (Haw. Nov. 22, 2011) (order).

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Magistrate Judge Kevin S.C. Chang entered findings and 
recommendations on Loher’s habeas petition to grant in part 
Loher’s Apprendi  claim but to deny in part his ineffect ive 
assistance of counsel claim  based on the  Brooks  forced testimony 
issue. 
In Loher v. Thomas (Loher VI), 23 F. S
upp. 3d 1182 (D. 
Haw. 2014), rev’ d in part by  Loher v. Thomas , 825 F.3d 1103 (9th 
Cir. 2016), District J
udge Leslie E. Kobayashi of the United 
States District Court for the District of Hawaii adopted in part and rejected in part the recommendations of the magistrate 
judge. The district court determined that the ICA’s application 
of Brooks in Loher IV was unreasonable, that a violation of 
Brooks occurred in this case, that the violation amounte
d to a 
structural error requiring automatic reversal of conviction, 
that the error was not harmless even if harmless error analysis 
applied, and that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the Brooks claim on direct appeal. Id. at 1193-1200. 
The district court therefore ordered that Loher be released within thirty days subject to appropriate release conditions, 
unless the State elected to retry him. Id.
 at 1200-01.  
The State appealed the district court’s ruling in 
Loher VI to the Nint
h Circuit Court of Appeals.  In Loher v. 
Thomas (Loher VII ), 825 F.3d 1103 (9th Cir. 2016), the Ninth 
Circuit vacated 
in part and affirmed in part the district

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
court’s ruling. Specifically, the Ninth Circuit concluded that 
the ICA’s rejection of Loher’s Brooks claim in Loher IV was not 
“objectively unreasonable.”9 Loher VII, 825 F.3d at 1115-17. 
Next, the Ninth Circuit addressed Loher’s claim 
regarding ineffective assistance of counsel. The court observed 
that while the ineffective assistance of counsel claim was 
independent of the Brooks claim, both claims related to the 
underlying merits of Loher’s Brooks forced testimony argument.  
Id. Although the Ninth Circuit concluded that the ICA’s 
“rejection of the Brooks claim in a post-conviction appeal , 
based on a  post
-conviction record , did not involve an 
objectively unreasonable application of Brooks,” this conclusion 
“simply does not answer whether a ‘reasonable probability 
exists’ that Loher would have prevailed in his 
based on the trial record , if his counsel had raised a Brooks 
claim.” Id. at 1120-21. 
The court concluded that the State had waived its 
challenge to the federal district court’s ruling that Loher was 
9 Federal courts may not grant a state prisoner’s petition for writ 
of habeas corpus unless: (1) the state court decision was “contrary to, or 
involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established” federal law, or 
(2) the state court decision was base d on an “unreasonable determination of 
the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.” 
Loher VII, 825 F.3d at 1111 (quoting 28 U.S.C.A. § 2254(d) (West 1996)). As 
noted by the Loher VII court, “[t]his is a ‘difficult to meet’ and ‘highly 
deferential standard for evaluating state -court rulings, which demands that 
state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.’” Id.  (quoting 
Cullen v. Pinholster , 563 U.S. 170, 181 (2011)).

  Upon the State’s motion , the ICA entered an order on 
October 25, 2016, vacating its judgments on appeal in Nos. 24489 and 29818. The ICA reinstated Loher’s thirteen-year old direct  
appeal in No. 24489 to “allow Loher to raise on direct appeal 
his claim that, in violation of his constitutional rights, Loher ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
entitled to relief on the ground of ineffective assistance of 
counsel, and it also concluded that Loher prevailed on his 
Apprendi claim. at 1121. Therefore, the court granted 
Loher’s petition for writ of habeas corpus with re spect to both 
his ineffective assistance of 
appellate counsel and Apprendi 
claims and remanded the case 
to the district court to determine 
the appropriate remedy. Id. at 1122-23. 
On remand, the federal district court in Loher v. 
Thomas (Loher VIII ), Civ. 11-00731 LEK-KSC, 2016 WL 4745164, at 
*3 (D. Haw. Sept. 12, 2016), issued a 
conditional writ directing 
the State to release Loher unless (1) the State moved to vacate the ICA’s decision in Loher IV and (2) Loher’s direct appeal in 
Loher I 
(No. 24489) was reinstated within ninety days.  The 
parties agreed, and the district court ordered, that Loher’s 
claim regarding ineffective assistance of counsel would be addressed first by reinstating his direct appeal; then, if Loher’s direct appeal was unsuccessful, he could seek relief 
based upon his Apprendi claim.

was ‘forced’ to testify when the trial court refused to grant 
Loher a continuance in order to testify after his other 
witnesses.” On December 19, 2016,  Loher’s appeal was 
transferred to this court.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
This court “answer[
s] questions of constitutional law 
by ‘exercising our own independent judgment based on the facts 
of the case.’” State v. Aplaca , 96 Hawai i 17, 22, 25 P.3d 792, 
797 (2001) (quoting State v. Jenkins , 93 Hawai i 87, 100, 997 
P.2d 13, 26 (2000)). Thus, “ questions of constitutional law are 
reviewed on appeal ‘under the “right/wrong” standard.’”  Id.  
(quoting Jenkins , 93 Hawai i at 100, 997 P.2d at 26).  
III. DISCUSSION 
On this renewed direct appeal, Loher contends that the 
circuit court’s denial of a continuance, thereby forcing him to 
testify before his other witnesses or not at all, violated his 
fundamental rights under the federal and Hawai i constitutions.  
Loher additionally argues that the circuit court’s action in 
this case amounts to “structural error” and is therefore not 
subject to harmless error review.10 The State submits that the 
10 Loher alternatively submits that if harmless error review does 
apply, the State cannot prove that the error in this case was harmless beyond 
a reasonable doubt.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
circuit court’s denial of the requested continuance did not 
constitute error.  Even assuming the existence of error, the 
State contends that harmless error review is applicable and that 
any error in this case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
A. Interference with Defendant’s Decision to Testify 
i. Relevant Caselaw 
In Brooks v. Tennessee , the United States Supreme 
Court was called 
upon to review the constitutionality of a 
Tennessee statute that required a defendant wishing to testify 
to take the stand before any other testimony for the defense was 
presented. 406 U.S. 605, 606 (1972). The Court stated that 
“the rule that a defendant must testify first” was based on a 
concern that defendants would observe the testimony of their 
witnesses, testify last, and tailor their testimony to match the 
prior witnesses’ accounts . Id. at 607. 
In its analysis, the Court first 
considered the 
uncertainties facing a defendant who must decide whether or not to testify. The Court noted that a defendant’s choice to take 
the stand “may pose serious dangers to the success of an 
accused’s defense” because it “carries with it serious risks of 
impeachment and cross-examination” and may also “open the door 
to otherwise inadmissible evidence which is damaging to his 
case.” Id. at 609 (quoting McGautha v. California , 402 U.S. 
183, 213 (1971)).  The Court also pointed out  that although a 
19  
 
 
defendant will usually have some idea of the strength of the 
defense’s  evidence, the defendant cannot be absolutely certain 
that the defense’s  “witnesses will testify as expected or that 
they will be effective on the stand.”  Id.   The Court elaborated 
that such witnesses “may collapse under skillful and persistent 
cross-examination
, and . . . fail to impress the jury as honest  
and reliable witnesses.”  Id.   Additionally, “the defendant is 
unlikely to know” whether testimony of other witnesses “will 
prove entirely favorable.” Id.  at 609-10.   
    
 
 
   
  
   
 
   
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The Court reasoned that due to these uncertainties, a 
defendant may not know at the close of the State’s case whether 
the defendant’s own testimony “
will be necessary or even 
helpful.” Id.  at 610.  Thus, the defendant might prefer to 
remain silent 
rather than risk the dangers of then taking the 
stand, putting off testifying “until its value can be 
realistically assessed.” Id. Under the Tennessee statute, 
however, defendants were denied the ability to realistically 
assess the value of their testimony before deciding whether to 
testify, as the statute required defendants to make the decision 
at the close of the State’s case -in-chief and before presenting 
any other defense witnesses.  Id. The Court determined that the 
statute “exacts a price for [the defendant’ s] silence ” by 
keeping the defendant off the stand entirely unless the defendant chooses to testify first, thereby “cast[ing] a heavy 
20
  
 
 
     
  The  Court concluded that although the statute 
reflected “a state interest in preventing testimonial 
influence,” this interest was insufficient to overcome the 
defendant’s constitutional right to remain silent .   Id. at 611 -
12.  The Court therefore held that th e statute “ violate[d] an  
accused’s constitutional right to remain silent insofar as it 
requires [the defendant]  to testify first for the defense or not 
at all.” Id.
  at 612.   
  
 
  
 
  
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
burden on a defendant’s otherwise unconditional right not to 
take the stand.” Id. at 610-11. 
In addition to concluding that the statute violated 
the defendant’s constituti onal right to remain silent, the Court 
also determined that the statute infringed on the defendant’s 
constitutional right to due process of law.  Id. The Court 
observed that “[w]hether the defendant is to testify is an 
important tactical decision as well 
as a matter of 
constitutional right,” and “[b]y requiring the accused and 
[defense counsel] to make that choice without an opportunity to 
evaluate the actual worth of their evidence, the statute 
restricts the defense--particularly counsel--in the planning of 
its case.” Id. Further, the penalty for the defendant’s 
decision to exercise his or her right to remain silent “is to keep the defendant off the stand entirely, ” even though counsel, 
as a matter of professional judgment, may want to call the 
21
  
 
 
defendant to testify later in the trial.   Id.   As a result, the 
statute operated to deprive the accused of “the ‘guiding hand of 
counsel’  in the timing of this critical element of the 
11  defense.”  Id.  at 612-13 (quoting  Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S 
45, 69 (1932)).  Although the Court noted that “nothing [it] 
say[s] here otherwise curtails in any way the ordinary power of a trial judge to set the order of proof, the accused and 
[defense] counsel may not be restricted in deciding whether, and 
when in the course of presenting [the]  defense, the accused 
should take the stand.” Id.  at 613.   
                                                         
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
11 The Court held in part that the statute violated the defendant’s 
constitutional due process rights as imposed on the states by the Fourteenth 
Amendment. 406 U.S. at 612. However, subsequent decisions of the United 
States Supreme Court have alternatively characterized the due process clause violation found in Brooks as a violation of the defendant’s right to the 
effective assistance of counsel. See, e.g., Herring v. New York, 422 U.S. 
853, 857 
-58 (1975) (identifying Brooks, 406 U.S. 605, as contributing to a 
“meaning [of the right to the assistance of counsel] that ensures to the defense in a criminal trial the opportunity to participate fully and fairly 
in the adversary factfinding process”); Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 344 
(1980) (stating that “court procedures that restrict a lawyer’s tactical 
decision to put the defendant on the stand uncons
titutionally abridge the 
right to counsel” and citing Brooks, 406 U.S. 605, as an example); United 
States v. Cronic , 466 U.S. 648, 659 n.25 (1984) (reasoning in context of the 
right to effective assistance of counsel that “a trial is unfair if the 
accused 
is denied counsel at a critical stage of [] trial” and citing Brooks, 
406 U.S. 605, as an example); Strickland v. Washington , 466 U.S. 668, 686 
(1984) (determining that “[g]overnment violates the right to effective 
assistance [of counsel] when it interfere
s in certain ways with the ability 
of counsel to make independent decisions about how to conduct the defense” 
and citing Brooks , 406 U.S. 605, as an example); Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 
695, 696 n.3 (2002) (describing situations implicating the Sixth Amen
dment 
right to counsel and citing Brooks, 406 U.S. 605, as an example of an actual 
or constructive complete denial of counsel at a critical stage in the 
proceedings).

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Hawaii appellate courts have considered the principles 
established by Brooks on several occasions. In State v. 
Grindles, 70 Haw. 528, 533, 777 P.2d 1187, 1191 (1989), this 
court first relied on Brooks to hold that a defendant was 
entitled to have the State present its entire case before 
deciding whether or not to take the stand.  In Grindles, the 
defendant was charged with driving under the influence of 
intoxicating liquor, and the relevant statute set forth one 
offense with alternative methods of proof.12 Id. at 530-31, 777 
P.2d at 1189. At trial, the court announced that it would bifurcate the proceedings based on the two alternative means of committing the offense. Id. at 529, 777 P.2d at 1189.  After 
the State presented its evidence with respect to the first means 
of committing the offense, the court ordered that the defendant 
should present his case on that issue before the court would 
proceed with the State’s cas e-in-chief on the second means.  Id. 
at 529-30, 777 P.2d at 1189.  
The defendant refused to present any testimony until 
the State had presented its entire case against him, arguing 
that the trial court’s proposed procedures violated his 
Commission of the offense at issue in Grindles  could be 
demonstrated if either (1) the 
defendant operated a vehicle while under the 
influence of intoxicating liquor, or (2) the defendant operated a vehicle 
with “0.10 percent or more, by weight of alcohol in the person’s blood.” 70 
Haw. at 530- 31, 777 P.2d at 1189 (quoting HRS § 291 -4(a) (repealed 2000)).

 Grindles
     
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
constitutional rights. Id.  This court agreed, reasoning that 
as applied to criminal trials, the “denial of due process is the 
failure to observe that fundamental fairness essential to the 
very concept of justice” and concluding that the trial court’s 
procedures violated the defend ant’s “
due process right to a fair 
trial” because the procedures were “fundamentally unfair .” 
at 532, 777 P.2d at 1190 (quoting Lisenba v. California , 314 
U.S. 219, 236 (1941)). 
The Grindles 
court also analyzed the Supreme Court’s 
decision in Brooks , 406 U.S. 605, and observed the significance 
of “a defendant’s constitutional interest in controlling the 
timing and sequence of evidence ” in the defense ’s case. 
Grindles, 70 Haw. at 532, 777 P.2d at 1190. The court concluded 
that based on Brooks, 406 U.S. 605, “the defendant has an 
absolute right to hear the State’s case” before deciding whether 
or not to testify. , 70 Haw. at 533, 777 P.2d at 1191  
(emphasis omitted).   As a result, the court determined that the  
procedures also improperly burdened the defendant’s  right 
against self-incrimination afforded by the Fifth Amendment to 
the United States Constitution and article I, section 10 of the 
Hawaii Constitution. Id.  at  532, 777 P.2d at 1190.  
In State v. Kido , 102 Hawai i 369, 378, 76 P.3d 612, 
621 (App. 2003), the ICA applied Brooks and Grindles to hold 
that an order requiring a defendant to testify prior to other 
24
  
 
 
  
  
   
  
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
defense witnesses violated the defendant’s state and federal 
constitutional rights to due process and against self-
incrimination. In Kido, the defense sought to begin its case at 
trial by calling to the stand a witness that was being held by the State on an unrelated matter; the witness was present at the 
courthouse, but was occupied in a different hearing.   102 Hawai i  
at 371-72, 76 P.3d at 614
-15.  Because the witness was not 
available, the trial court required the defense to call the 
defendant to the stand because he was the only other witness 
present and because of the court’s  concern that the parties were 
“wasting time.”  Id.  at 372, 76 P.3d at 615.   Following defense 
counsel’s overruled objection, the defendant testified  and was 
subsequently convicted. Id.  
On appeal, the ICA first reviewed the United States 
Supreme Court’s decision in Brooks, 406 U.S. 605
.  Kido, 102 
Hawaii at 374-76, 76 P.3d at 617-19.  The ICA noted that “some 
federal and state appellate courts, presented with averments of 
Brooks error, have declined to find constitutional error” in the 
following three categories of cases: (1) where “the trial court 
required that the defendant testify before only some of his 
witnesses”; (2) where “the defendant’s decision whether to 
testify congealed before the trial court’s action”; and (3) 
where “the defendant himself created the exigency for taking hi s 
testimony first.” Id. at 376, 76 P.3d at 619. The ICA 
25
  
 
 
    
  
 
 
  Id.  
  
  The ICA again considered the issue of forced testimony 
in State v. Sale , 110 Hawai i  386, 133 P.3d 815 (App. 2006).  In 
Sale, the defendant affirmed during trial that he would take the 
stand but sought to testify after his only other witness. 110 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
elaborated that “[i]n so holding, some of those courts have 
noted the distinction between the statutory directive in Brooks  
and the trial court directive before them, though none have 
explained why the distinction makes a constitutional 
difference.” Id. (footnote omitted). 
The ICA concluded, however, that “those cases [were] 
factually distinguishable” because “the choice foisted upon Kido 
was effectively the same choice the Tennessee statute forced 
upon Brooks”--i.e., testify first, before any other defense witnesses, or do not testify at all. Id.  The ICA noted that 
the record contained no indication that the defendant had already decided to testify, that 
the defendant “created an 
exigency that pushed him to the head of the witness list,” or 
that the inconvenience that would have resulted from delaying 
the proceedings to secure the presence of the other defense 
witness would have been anything more than “trifling.” at 
377, 76 P.3d at 620. The ICA therefore held that the trial  
court abused its discretion in “directing, over Kido’s objection, that he testify before his other defense witness. ”   
Id. at 378, 76 P.3d at 621. 
26

  
 
 
  
   
  
  
  
  
 
    
 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Hawaii at 390-91, 133 P.3d at 819-20.  However, when the other 
witness could not be located, the circuit court required the 
defense to proceed with its case “in t he interest of not wasting 
time.” Id. at 391, 133 P.3d at 820. As a result, the defendant 
took the stand and testified in his own defense.  Id. Although 
the other witness was later located, he stated his intent to 
invoke his right against self
-incrimination; when the defense 
sought to have the witness testify as to basic facts of his relationship with the defendant, the circuit court deemed such 
testimony inadmissible under HRE Rule 403 (1993).  Id. at 391 -
92, 133 P.3d at 820-21. 
The defendant 
in Sale subsequently appealed his 
conviction, arguing, inter alia, that the trial court erred in 
requiring him to testify before resolving whether his other 
witness would testify. Id. at 396, 133 P.3d at 825.  The ICA in 
its decision analyzed both Brooks, 406 U.S. 605, and Kido, 102 
Hawaii 369, 76 P.3d 612, and observed that “[n]otwithstanding 
the broad language in Brooks, courts have declined to find 
constitutional error in circumstances factually distinguishable 
from Brooks.” Sale, 110 Hawai i at 397, 133 P.3d at 826.  
However, the ICA determined that it “need not address whether 
the circuit court’s actions amounted to Brooks  error” because it 
“conclude[d] that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable 
27
  
 
 
    
 
 
  
  
 
  Caselaw of this jurisdiction and of the United States 
Supreme Court makes clear that  a defendant and defense counsel  
“may not be restricted in deciding whether, and when in the 
course of presenting his [or her] defense, the accused should 
take the stand.”   Brooks, 406  U.S. at 613.   Any such restriction  
violates Hawaii’s constitutional guarantee  against self -
incrimination provided by article I, section 10
, the right to  
due process of law under article I, section 5, and the right to 
                                                        
    
 
 
 
  
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
doubt.” Id.13 The ICA reasoned that the defendant “had already 
stated his decision to testify on the record” before the circuit 
court required him to testify first and the defendant “turned 
out to be the only witness for the defense.” Id. at 397-98, 133 
P.3d at 826-27. 
ii.	 A Court May Not Restrict a Defendant in Deciding Whether 
and When to Testify 
13 In its 2008 decision in Loher III, 118 Hawai i at 539, 193 P.3d at 
455, the ICA once again addressed Brooks and its progeny. Although the ICA 
in Loher III  addressed only whether appellate counsel was ineffective for 
failing to raise the Brooks forced testimony issue on direct appeal, it 
observed in a footnote that “in Kido, [the ICA] identified various situations 
where Brooks  error would not be found.” 118 Hawaii at 533 n.6, 193 P.3d at 
449 n.6. 
The ICA then listed the three categories of cases identified in 
Kido and briefly recounted its opinions in both Kido and Sale
. Id.  
Additionally, in its unpublished opinion of Loher IV, No. 29818, 
2011 WL 2132828, at *7-9, the ICA likewise stated that other courts “ha[d] 
held that no Brooks error exists” in the three categories of cases identified 
by Kido, and it applied two of the exceptions to determine that there was no 
Brooks  error in Loher’s case.  
28
  
 
 
   
 
 
  Although Brooks  addressed a statute that imposed 
restrictions on a defendant’s decision whether and when to take 
the stand
, the Court’s concerns that the restriction precluded 
the defendant from making the choice to testify or remain silent “in the unfettered exercise of [the defendant’s]  own will” and 
also deprived  the accused of “the ‘guiding hand of counsel’” 
apply with as much strength to a court’s directive at tri al as 
to a requirement imposed by statute. Id.  at 610, 612-13 (first  
quoting Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 8 (1964); then quoting   
Powell, 287 U.S. at 69); see also  Kido, 102 Hawai i at 376, 76

14 15the assistance of counsel under article I, section 14, as well 
as the analogous provisions of the United States Constitution.  See U.S. Const. amend. V; U.S. Const. amend. XIV; U.S. Const. 
amend. VI.  
14 Although courts of this jurisdiction have previously found such a 
requirement to violate the privilege against self -incrimination and the right 
to due process, we concur with the reasoning of multiple decisions issued by 
the United States Supreme Court, see  supra  note 11, that the reasoning 
underlying the Brooks court’s finding of a due process violation also 
implicates the constitutional guarantee to the effective assistance of counsel. See Brooks , 406 U.S. at 612 -13 (describing the relevant violation 
as based on the accused’s deprivation of “the ‘guiding hand of counsel’ in the timing of [a] critical element of [the] defense” and the fact that the 
statute “restricts the defense --particularly counsel--in the planning of its 
case” (quoting Powell , 287 U.S. at 69)). 
15 See Haw. Const. art. I, § 10 (“[N] or shall any person be 
compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against oneself .”); Haw. 
Const. art. I, § 5 (“ No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property 
without due process of law . . . .”); Haw. Const. art. I, § 14 (“ In all 
criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to . . . have the 
assistance of counsel for the accused’s defense .”).

Rather, the ICA in Kido  
observed that “ some federal and state appellate courts ” had 
adopted such exceptions. 102 Hawai i at 376, 76 P.3d at 619  
(emphasis added). The Kido  court identified three categories of 
cases in which other courts confronted with   a Brooks  error had  
declined to find constitutional error. Id.   Although the Kido  
court observed that the record was devoid of an indication that 
two of these exceptions were relevant to its disposition, it  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The State argues, however, that no Brooks violation 
occurred in this case 
because this jurisdiction has adopted 
exceptions to the principles recognized in Brooks and because at 
least two of these exceptions apply. In support of its argument 
on this issue, the State relies primarily on the ICA’s decision 
in Kido, 102 Hawai i 369, 76 P.3d 612. 
30
  
 
 
   Nor did the ICA adopt exceptions to the Brooks  ruling  
in Sale.   110 
Hawaii 386, 133   P.3d 815.   The ICA in Sale  again 
stated that some courts had “declined to find” a  Brooks  
violation in “factually distinguishable” circumstances.  Sale , 
110 Hawai i at 397, 133 P.3d at 826.   Although the  Sale  court did 
consider the legal relevance of one of the exceptions identified 
by Kido (namely, whether the  defendant’s  decision to testify had 
“congealed” )., it did so only within the context  of determining  
whether any alleged Brooks  error would be harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt, thereby confirming that it did not find that this consideration should be analyzed in determining whether a 
16 violation occurred. Sale, 110 Hawai i at 397, 133 P.3d at 826.    
    
  
 
  
                                                        
 16  While the ICA in Loher III  observed in a footnote that “[i]n 
Kido, [the ICA] identified various situations where Brooks  error would not be 
found,” 118 Hawai i at 533 n.6, 193 P.3d at 449 n.6, this appears to be based 
upon a misreading of its prior decision in Kido
.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
ultimately concluded that the defendant’s constitutional rights 
were violated because “the choice foisted upon Kido was effectively the same choice the Tennessee statute forced upon 
Brooks.” Id.  
Significantly, this court has not adopted “exceptions” 
to the constitutional protections first set forth by the Supreme Court in Brooks and subsequently 
affirmed in this jurisdiction.  
Rather, this court’s consideration of Brooks reflects our 
31
  
 
 
  
   
   
  One exception  involves a factual inquiry into  
whether the defendant previously decided to  testify and 
whether this decision had “congealed” prior to the trial 
court’s requirement that the defendant testify or waive the 
right. Kido, 102 Hawai i at 376, 76 P.3d at 619 .   This 
exception, however,  is in derogation of  the latitude given to 
a defendant to delay deciding  whether to take the stand until 
after the defense’s case has been presented and to be able to  
change one’s  mind following any preliminary decision  .  Brooks, 
406 U.S. at 609-10.  The Brooks   Court’s conclusion  that a 
defendant is constitutionally entitled to not decide whether 
to testify until after viewing the strength of the defendant’s 
case was based in large part on a concern that even though a 
defendant may make a preliminary decision whether to take the 
stand, such a decision may change after presentation of the  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
understanding of the grave importance of “a defendant’s 
constitutional interest in controlling the timing and sequence 
of evidence in his defense.” Grindles, 70 Haw. at 532, 777 P.2d 
at 1190. 
Further, the possible exceptions identified by the ICA 
in Kido are inconsistent with 
the protections afforded to 
defendants in this jurisdiction and with the concerns underlying the Supreme Court’s decision in Brooks. 406 U.S. at 612-13.

witnesses and other evidence in the defense’s case . See id. ; 
17 Grindles, 70 Haw.   at 532–33, 777 P.2d at 1190 –91.  An 
exception based on a defendant’s preliminary decision as to 
whether to take the stand would conflict with the ruling in  
Brooks because it would remove the defendant’s  power to choose 
whether, and when, to testify once a provisional decision had 
been made, thereby  eliminating  the defendant’s right  to change 
his or her mind as the defense’s case at trial proceeds.

1979) (Kennedy, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part) (“At the 
outset of the trial, a defendant in good faith may intend to testify, but it 
may be quite reasonable for him to change his mind after considering the course taken by the evidence. All of us know a defendant may tell a brave 
story to his counsel only to succumb to fear once the  full weight of the 
prosecution’s case becomes apparent. In these instances a defendant and his counsel often elect to invoke the self -incrimination privilege despite an 
earlier plan to testify.”), overruled on other grounds by  Luce v. United 
States, 469 U.S. 38 (1984).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Adopting an exception to Brooks that excuses a 
violation of a defendant’s constitutional right s based on the 
defendant’s prior assertion that he or s he would take the stand 
is also inconsistent with 
fundamental principles that underlie 
this court’s decision in Tachibana v. State , 79 Hawai i 226, 900 
P.2d 1293 (1995). In Tachibana , we held that trial courts must 
conduct an on-
the-record colloquy to advise defendants of their 
right to testify and to determine whether the defendant wishes 
to exercise or waive the right. Id. at 237-
38, 900 P.2d at 
1304-05.  We concluded that the “ideal time” to conduct the

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
colloquy is “immediately prior to the close of the defendant’s 
case,” based in large part on our observation that “ the 
defendant may not be in a position to decide whether to waive 
the right to testify until all other evidence has been 
presented.” Id. at 237, 900 P.2d at 1304. Implicit in our 
holding in Tachibana was our conclusion that a defendant must be afforded the opportunity to 
not decide whether to take the stand 
until the close of the defense’s case. An exception that 
effectively waives the defendant’s constitutional right to testify or not to testify based on a preliminary 
decision, made 
before the defense’s case was presented, would be inconsistent 
with the principles enunciated in Tachibana. 
An exception grounded in a defendant’s prior assertion 
regarding the decision to testify would also run counter to the 
emphasis placed by Tachibana and its progeny on the fundamental 
importance of ensuring that 
such a decision is made knowingly 
and intelligently.  Id. 
at 233-36, 900 P.2d at 1300-03; see also 
State v. Monteil , 134 Hawai i 361, 371, 341 P.3d 567, 577 (2014)

upon a defendant’s awareness of the ‘relevant circumstances and 
likely consequences’ of such a decision.” (quoting Brady v. 
United States, 397 U.S. 742, 748 (1970))). In the context of deciding whether to testify or not testify, a fully-informed 
determination requires the defendant to have knowledge of and

“intelligently weigh” “the advantages and disadvantages ” of 
testifying and being subject to cross-examination, which the 
defendant may be unable to assess until the close of the 
defense’s case. Grindles, 70 Haw. at 532-33, 777 P.2d at 1190 -
91 (quoting Brooks , 406 U.S. at 608). Requiring the defendant 
to choose whether or not to take the stand based on a prior, 
preliminary decision--made before being able to assess the state 
of the defense at trial--will often impair the defendant’s 
ability to make a knowing, fully-informed choice. 
The remaining exceptions identified by the ICA in Kido 
suffer from similar flaws. 102 Hawai i at 376, 76 P.3d at 619. 
The “exigency” exception is based on a defendant’s relative 
fault for “creat[ing] the exigency for taking his testimony 
first.” Id. This exception would result in the automatic 
forfeiture of a defendant’s constitutional rights if, for 
example, defense counsel 
inaccurately predicts the number of 
witnesses who are called to testify by the State, overestimates 
the duration of the witnesses’ testimony, misunderstands a 
communication by the State regarding the expected length of 
trial, or fails to anticipate that a defense witness will be 
tardy or not appear
.18 
18 See, e.g. , Kido, 102 Hawai i at 371- 72, 76 P.3d at 614 -15 
(defendant required to testify first b ased on State’s inability to produce 
(continued. . .) 
35
  
 
 
  An exigency  exception would therefore permit the 
errors of counsel to waive fundamental rights held exclusively  
by the defendant, despite our requirement that such  
relinquishment may be effectuat ed “only by the defendant.” 
Tachibana, 79 Hawai i at 232, 900 P.2d at 1299 (quoting  State v. 
Silva
, 78 Hawai i 115, 123, 890 P.2d 702, 710  (App. 1995), 
abrogated on other grounds by  Tachibana, 79 Hawai i 226, 900 P.2d

as a matter of trial strategy” (quoting United States v. Moody, 
977 F.2d 1425, 1431 (11th Cir. 1992))).   Predicating the 
deprivation of a defendant’s constitutional rights on 
inadvertent errors  of counsel or a late arrival of a witness is 
also a deficient  proxy for ensuring that a defendant makes a  
knowing, intelligent, and fully-informed decision  whether to  
testify. See  id.  at 232, 900 P.2d at 1299.

376, 76 P.3d at 619. However, compelling the defendant to 
testify or to give up that right after the first or second 
witness but prior to the remaining defense witnesses suffers 
from the same constitutional flaws as the two exceptions 
described above. Namely, such an exception would force the 
defendant to make the decision whether to testify before the 
value of the defense’s remaining evidence could be 
“realistically assessed,” Brooks, 406 U.S. at 610, and it would 
be an inadequate substitute for securing a defendant’s knowing 
and intelligent waiver of his or her constitutional rights, 
Tachibana, 79 Hawai i at 233-36, 900 P.2d at 1300-03. Further, 
there appears to be no reasonable basis for a rule that would 
prohibit the court from requiring a defendant to testify first, 
yet permit the court to order a defendant to testify or give up 
that right prior to the presentment of other witnesses in the 
defense’s case . 
Although it is true that under HRE Rule 611 (1993), 
the trial judge possesses the authority to “exercise reasonable 
control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and 
presenting evidence,” the rules of evidence “cannot override the 
constitutional rights of the accused.” State v. Calbero, 71 
Haw. 115, 124, 785 P.2d 157, 161 (1989); see also  State v. Tetu ,

the court’s power to protect constitutional rights). The trial 
court may not rely on its authority to set the order of proof in 
a manner that violates the constitutional rights of defendants, 
and, therefore, it may not invoke such authority to require the 
defendant to testify before the defense’s o ther witnesses or not 
at all. See Brooks , 406 U.S. at 613 (“While nothing we say here 
otherwise curtails in any way the ordinary power of a trial 
judge to set the order of proof, 
the accused and his counsel may 
not be restricted  in deciding whether, and w
hen in the course of

(emphases added)). Accordingly, while a trial court may control 
the mode and order of the presentation of evidence at trial to 
serve the interests of judicial economy, “[p]re ssuring the 
defendant to take the stand, by foreclosing later testimony if [the defendant] refuses, is not a constitutionally permissible 
means” of achieving this goal.

In sum, the United States Supreme Court established in

in deciding whether to waive the privilege against self-
incrimination or in determining when the defendant should take

   the stand in the defense ’s case. We adopted this principle in 
Grindles and concluded that the Hawai i Constitution likewise 
protects a defendant’s freedom to choose when and whether to 
  testify for the defense. 70 Haw. at 531-33, 777 P.2d at 1190-
  91.  The exceptions identified by the ICA in Kido, 102 Hawai i at 
376-77, 76 P.3d at 619-20, are inconsistent with this court’s 
  ruling in Grindles and contrary to the protections afforded to 
   defendants under the Hawai i Constitution, and, therefore, we 
20   decline to adopt them.
  
 
 
  In this case, the State identified up to fourteen 
witnesses that it would call in its case-in-chief, and the trial 
was expected by the parties and the court to last between five 
and six days. 
On the first day of the evidentiary portion of 
the trial on Tuesday, November 14, 2000, the State rested   its 
case at approximately 2:15 p.m.  The circuit court then 
announced that it would take a brief recess, after which it 
would “give the defense an opportunity to present any evidence.”

When the court reconvened outside the presence of the jury, 
defense counsel requested a continuance until the next trial day 
on Thursday, November 16, when the defense’s witnesses had been 
arranged to appear.  According to defense counsel, the 
unavailability of the two witnesses was due to counsel’ s 
approximation that the witnesses would not be needed until Thursday. Counsel informed the court that he “had no idea that 
[the State] would finish this early . . . because they have quite a number of people on the witness list.” 
Defense counsel further explained to the circuit court 
the reasons for requesting the continuance, stating that Loher “had not decided fully whether or not he would testify for 
sure.” Counsel i nformed the court that “as a strategic manner 
in planning for [ the defense’s ] case, [Loher] was going to be 
the last witness [he] call[ed],” and whether Loher testified or 
not would “depend[] how it went with the other witnesses.” In 
response to counsel’s objection, the circuit court stated that 
it was “the responsibility of counsel ” to secure the presence of 
his witnesses, that defense counsel “should be aware . . . what 
the witnesses that he intends to call will testify,” and that 
defense counsel had also “represented to the [circuit court] 
that his client [was] going to testify.” Invoking its authority 
to set the order of proof under HRE Rule 611 (1993), the circuit court denied the request for a continuance over defense

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
counsel’s objection. The court announced, “So we’re going to 
proceed. You may call your client to testify, or if you wish, 
not to testify . . . and he may waive his testimony. ”21 
The circuit court thus indisputably required Loher to 
either testify before his other witnesses or waive his right to 
testify entirely, thereby “restrict[ing]” Loher and his counsel 
“in deciding whether, and when in the course of presenting his 
defense, the accused should take the stand.” Brooks, 406 U.S. 
at 613; see also  Grindles, 70 Haw. at 532-33, 777 P.2d at 1190 -
91.  In imposing this requirement, the circuit court 
unreasonably burdened Loher’s privilege against self -
incrimination in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United 
States Constitution and article I, section 10 of the Hawai i 
Constitution, preventing Loher from making the choice whether 
and when to testify free of coercion from the court.  See  
Brooks, 406 U.S. at 610 (noting that under the Tennessee 
statute, the defendant could not make the choice whether to 
testify “in the unfettered exercise of his own will” (quoting 
Malloy, 378 U.S. at 8)). 
21 We observe that at the time the trial court ordered Loher to 
testify first or not at all, the ICA had not yet set forth its decisions in 
Kido, 102 Hawai i 369, 76 P.3d 612, and Sale, 110 Hawai i 386, 133 P.3d 815, 
observing the existence of “exceptions” in other jurisdictions to the rule 
set forth in Brooks , 406 U.S. 605. 
41
  
 
 
   The circuit court’s actions also  impaired  Loher’s  
constitutional right  to the assistance of counsel as provided by  
the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and 
article I, section 14 of the Hawai i Constitution.   Loher was   
deprived of an advisement by defense counsel on whether to take 
the stand that was fully-informed and made following counsel’s 
“evaluat[ion] [of] the actual worth” of the defense’ s evidence,  
see Brooks, 406 U.S. at 612, and the circuit court undermined counsel’s ability to present the defense of Loher’s choosing.    
  
 
  
   
  
 
      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Additionally, t he circuit court’s interference with 
counsel’s ability to mount Loher’s alibi defense burdened 
Loher’s right to “be accorded ‘a meaningful opportunity to 
present a complete defense,
’” State v. Matafeo , 71 Haw. 183, 
185, 787 P.2d 671, 672 (1990) (quoting California v. 
Trombetta,

that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept of justice,” Grindles, 70 Haw. at 532, 777 P.2d at 1190 (quoting 
Lisenba
, 314 U.S at 236). Therefore, the circuit court’s 
actions also violated Loher’s right to due process of law under 
the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and 
article I, section 5 of the Hawai i Constitution.

B.	 Applicability of Structural Error or Harmless Error 
Analysis 
Because we conclude that Loher’s constitutional rights 
were violated when the circuit court required him to testify 
before his other witnesses or forfeit his right to testify 
entirely, we must determine whether the violation is structural 
error or subject to harmless error analysis. See  State v. Reed, 
135 Hawai i 381, 386, 386 n.11, 351 P.3d 1147, 1152, 1152 n.11 
(2015) (characterizing structural errors and stating that such 
errors are not subject to harmless error analysis). 
i. Federal Constitution 
After concluding that the defendant was deprived of 
his constitutional rights in Brooks v. Tennessee , the United 
States Supreme Court did not explicitly address whether the 
violation was subject to harmless error analysis. 
406 U.S. 605, 
613 (1972).  Rather, the Court concluded that “[t]he State makes 
no claim that this was harmless error, and [the defendant] is 
entitled to a new trial.” Id. at 613 (citation omitted). 
Following its decision in Brooks, 
the Supreme Court 
has on several occasions characterized Brooks as exemplifying a 
violation of the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee of the assistance of counsel that requires no showing of prejudice. See United   
States v. Cronic , 466 U.S. 648, 659 n.25 (1984) (observing that 
in the context of the Sixth Amendment right to the effective 
43

  
 
 
                                                         
 22  See also  Strickland v. Washington , 466 U.S. 668, 692 (1984) 
(explaining that “[a]ctual or constructive denial of the assis tance of 
counsel altogether is legally presumed to result in prejudice,” as well as 
“various kinds of state interference with counsel’s assistance” and citing 
the examples identified by Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659 n.25 (including Brooks, 
406 U.S 605)); Bell v.  Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 696 n.3 (2002) (relating certain 
situations where the Supreme Court “found a Sixth Amendment error without 
requiring a showing of prejudice” because the defendant was actually or constructively denied counsel and citing Brooks, 406 U.S. 605, as an 
example); Wright v. Van Patten, 552 U.S. 120, 124 (2008) (affirming that Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, establishes that no showing of prejudice is required to 
find a Sixth Amendment violation when “counsel is either totally absent, or 
prevented from assisting the accused during a critical stage of the proceeding” (alteration omitted) (quoting Cronic, 466 U.S. at 659 n.25)).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
assistance of counsel,  Brooks, 406 U.S. 605, is an example where 
the Supreme Court “found constitutional error without any 
showing of prejudice when counsel was either totally absent, or 
prevented from assisting the accused during a critical stage of  
22 the proceeding”) .  The Supreme Court has reasoned that  no 
showing of prejudice is required in this situation  in part 
because the denial  of counsel is “so likely to prejudice the 
accused that the cost of litigating [its] effect in a particular 
case is unjustified,” Cronic, 466 U.S. at 658, and because these 
circumstances “involve impairments of the Sixth Amendment right

prevent,” Strickland , 466 U.S. at 692; see also  People v. 
Mitchell, 560  N.W.2d 600, 605 (Mich. 1997) (characterizing

  We recognize that while  some federal and state courts 
have considered Brooks violations to constitute structural  
error, other courts have applied harmless error analysis. 
However, this court has explicitly considered that the rights 
provided by the Hawai i Constitution regarding due process of 
law, the privilege against self-incrimination, and the 
assistance of counsel--each of which was violated in this case--
may in certain circumstances provide  greater  protections to 
24 defendants in the State of Hawai i.  Thus, we consider whether,

presumption of prejudice in such cases as a “prophylactic 
approach”).23 
ii. State Constitution 
23 Relying on the presumption of prejudice required by the Supreme 
Court’s decision in Cronic
, several state and federal courts have concluded 
that when a criminal defendant has been denied the right to counsel at a 
critical stage of the trial or when the ability of counsel to represent the defendant is subject to certain state interference, the harmless error rule 
does not apply. 
See, e.g.,  United States v. Roy , 855 F.3d 1133, 1144, 1149 
(11th Cir. 2017) (en banc) (describing Brooks
, 406 U.S. 605, as exemplifying 
a “statutory or court -ordered interference exception to the prejudice 
requirement”); see also Wayne R. LaFave et al.,  Criminal Procedure  1072 (6th 
ed. 2017) (describing Brooks
, 406 U.S. 605, as exemplifying the prohibition 
against “unconstitutional state imposed interference with counsel” which is 
“presumed prejudicial and therefore requires automatic reversal”). 
24 See, e.g., State v. Bowe , 77 Hawai i 51, 58-60, 881 P.2d 538, 545-
47 (1994) (collecting cases in which this court has “broadened the due process rights of the accused in criminal proceedings”); id. at 57- 58, 881 
P.2d at 544- 45 (“reject[ing]” the United States Supreme Court’s “narrow 
focus” regarding the concerns underlying the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and holding that the protections afforded by article I, 
section 10 of the Hawai i Constitution are “broader”); State v. Aplaca, 74 
Haw. 54, 67 n.2, 837 P.2d 1298, 1305 n.2 (1992) (observing that “under 
Hawaii’s [c]onstitution, defendants are clearly afforded greater protection 
of their right to effective assistance of counsel” than under the federal 
constitution).

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
given the nature and magnitude of the independent protections 
provided by the Hawai i Constitution, the circuit court’s 
restriction of Loher’s decision regarding whether and when to 
testify in his defense constitutes structural error not subject 
to harmless error review. See Reed, 135 Hawai i at 386, 351 P.3d 
at 1152. 
1. Characteristics of Structural Errors Under Hawai i Law 
Decisions of our courts show that two related 
characteristics of an error may render it structural and thus 
not subject to harmless error analysis. First, “certain rights 
protected by the Hawai i Constitution” are “so basic to a fair 
trial that [their] contravention can never be deemed harmless.” 
State v. Holbron , 80 Hawai i 27, 32 n.12, 904 P.2d 912, 917 n.12 
(1995) (alteration in original) (quoting State v. Suka , 79 
Hawai
i 293, 299, 901 P.2d 1272, 1278 (App. 1995), overruled on 
other grounds by Holbron
, 80 Hawai i 27, 904 P.2d 912); see also 
State v. Cramer , 129 Hawai i 296, 311, 299 P.3d 756, 771 (2013) 
(Acoba, J., concurring) (stating that this co urt “in determining 
whether to apply harmless error review to the violation of a 
particular right ” should look in part to the “nature of the 
right at issue ” (quoting Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 
291 (1991) (White, J., dissenting in part))); State v. Mundon , 
121 Hawai
i 339, 382, 219 P.3d 1126, 1169 (2009) (Acoba, J., 
46  
 
 
  
 
    
  Based on this principle, courts of our jurisdiction  
have relied on the inherent nature of the constitutional right 
at issue and its significance in affording the defendant a 
fundamentally fair trial to conclude  that certain errors are not  
subject to harmlessness review.   See, e.g., Mundon , 121 Hawai i  
at 358, 219 P.3d  at 1145 (  trial court’s failure to provide 
defendant with transcripts from prior proceedings  did not 
require a showing of prejudice to merit vacatur and remand for a 
new trial in part because there was “innate value” to a 
defendant in being able to utilize transcripts to prepare for 
trial); State v. Silva, 78 Hawai i 115, 121,   890 P.2d 702, 708  
(App. 1995) (holding that “when the court assumes the r ole of a 
prosecutor, it violates the fundamental due process requirement 
that the tribunal be impartial, and such an error, by 
definition, is inherently prejudicial and not harmless”),  
abrogated on other grounds by  Tachibana v. State  , 79 Hawai i 226, 
900 P.2d 1293 (1995); State v. Chow , 77 Hawai i 241, 249-51, 883 
P.2d 663, 671-73 (App.  1994) (“doubt[ing]” that the denial of an ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
concurring in part and dissenting in part) (observing that 
“Hawaii courts have recognized that the Hawai i Constitution 
protects certain rights ‘ so basic to a fair trial that [their] 
contravention can never be deemed harmless ’” (quoting Holbron, 
80 Hawai i at 31 n.12, 904 P.2d at 918 n.12)). 
47
  
 
 
   
  
 
 
  Second, this court has considered that an error may be 
properly considered structural when the impact of the error on 
conviction is impossible to reliably assess and when harmless 
error review would require the  appellate court to engage in pure 
speculation.   For instance, in  Cramer, 129 Hawai i at 303, 299   
P.3d at 763, this court suggested that denial of the right to 
privately retained counsel of choice under article I, section 14 
of the Hawai i  Constitution constituted structural error.  We 
concluded in Cramer  that  denial of the defendant’s counsel of 
choice at a sent  encing hearing constituted error and  quoted the 
Supreme Court’s reasoning that it is “impossible to know what 
different choices the rejected counsel would have made, and then 
to quantify the impact of those different choices on the outcome ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
opportunity to engage in presentence allocution “can ever be 
harmless error,” based in part on the status of allocution as a 
“significant aspect of the fair treatment which should be 
accorded a defendant in the se ntencing process” and its use as a 
tool to maximize the perceived equity of the criminal process); 
Reed, 135 Hawai i at 386, 351 P.3d at 1152 (stating that 
violation of the right to retained counsel of choice constitutes 
structural error in part because the right is “deemed of such 
importance” and because it is required to maintain “the 
integrity of our system of justice ”). 
48
  
 
 
   We again considered  the speculative nature of the 
impact of a right to counsel  violation in State v. Harter , where 
we suggested that  ineffective assistance of counsel due to a 
conflict of interest may require no showing of prejudice to 
require vacatur and remand for a new trial. 134 Hawai i 308,  
327-28, 340 P.3d 440, 459-60 (2014).  Significantly, we noted 
that “it would be impractical to require a defendant to prove 
‘adverse effect’ in such a case” because it would be impossible 
to know what choices a different lawyer would make in  
representing the defendant  and because  “appellate inquiry ‘into 
a claim of harmless error’ may require ‘unguided speculation.’” 
Id. (first quoting Cramer, 129 Hawai i at 303, 299 P.3d at 763;  
then quoting Holloway  v. Arkansas  , 435 U.S. 475, 491 (1978) 
(improper denial of motion to withdraw based on conflict of 
interest constituted error not subject to harmlessness 
analysis)). In support of this proposition, we also quoted the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of the proceedin gs.” Id.  (quoting United States v. Gonzalez-
Lopez, 548 U.S. 140, 150 (2006)).  Likewise, we concluded that 
requiring the defendant  in Cramer  “to argue that he was 
‘prejudiced’” by the violation would require this court to “speculate as to how [the counsel of choice] would have 
represented [the defendant] at the sentencing hearing.” Id.   We 
therefore vacated the defendant’s judgment and remanded for  
resentencing without conducting a harmless error analysis. Id.    
49

  
 
 
Supreme Court’s observations that “it would be difficult to 
judge intelligently the impact of a conflict on the attorney’s 
representation of a client” and that “to assess the impact of a 
conflict of interest on the attorney’s op tions, tactics, and 
25 decisions in plea negotiations would be virtually impossible.”   
Id. at 328 n.24, 340 P.3d at 460 n.24; see also  State v. Phua , 
135 Hawai i 504, 517, 353 P.3d 1046, 1059 (2015)  (vacating and 
remanding without engaging in harmless error analysis where no valid waiver of counsel was made by the defendant at sentencing, 
thereby depriv ing him of the  constitutional right to counsel at 
a critical stage of the proceeding  s); State v. Pitts, 131 Hawai i  
537, 319 P.3d 456  (2014) (vacating and remanding without 
engaging in harmless error analysis for deprivation  of the 
constitutional right to counsel during “critical stage[s]” of 
post-verdict motion  proceeding and sentencing).

2. Restricting a Defendant in Deciding Whether and When to 
Testify Amounts to Structural Error Under Hawai
i Law 
In this court’s adoption of Brooks, we did not analyze 
whether the error was harmless when we vacated the defendant’s 
conviction and remanded for a new trial. State v. Grindles , 70 
The Harter court ultimately concluded that it need not determine 
whether a finding of prejudice was required because the defendant did not 
voluntarily consent to the attorney -client relationship as required under our 
conflict of interest standard, which, standing alone, was sufficient to 
require vacatur. 134 Hawai i at 328, 340 P.3d at 460. 
50
 25  
 
 
   
 
  
   
  
  
   
 
 
 
 
   
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Haw. 528, 531-33, 777 P.2d 1187, 1190-91 (1989).  Rather, the 
Grindles  court vacated the conviction and remanded to the trial 
court without considering the effect of the constitutional 
violation on the underlying conviction. Id. Despite this 
court’s ruling in Grindles
, the ICA in State v. Kido  held that a 
constitutional violation stemming from a trial court’s 
requirement that the defendant testify before other defense 
witnesses is subject to harmless error review
.  102 Hawai i 369, 
378, 76 P.3d 612, 621 (App. 2003).  Underlying the ICA’s ruling 
were its conclusions that the Brooks 
court “implied[]” that such 
review was applicable and that the violation was not “of the 
kind and magnitude” that this court had intimated could never be 
deemed harmless. Id. 
(citing Holbron, 80 Hawai i at 32 n.12, 904 
P.2d at 917 n.12). 
However, the ICA in Kido analyzed neither the nature 
nor the “magnitude” of the vital constitutional rights that were 
unreasonably burdened.  A court’s interference with a 
defendant’s decision whether and when to testify results in the 
violation of the defendant’s constitutional privilege against 
self-incrimination, right to the effective assistance of 
counsel, and right to due process of law. The fundamental 
nature of these three constitutional protections establishes that Loher was deprived of rights “basic to a fair trial. ” 
51
  
 
 
   
   
  First, equally vital to our system of justice are 
“both the right to testify and the right not to testify.” State 
v. Monteil, 134 Hawai i 361, 369, 341 P.3d 567, 575 (2014)  
(observing that “ Hawaii  has historically protected” both 
rights).   Whether to take the stand is a  critical question that 
may pose substantial  dangers to the defense’ s case, particularly 
because it subjects the defendant  to cross-examination by the 
State. Grindles , 70 Haw. at 532, 777 P.2d at 1190 (quoting 
Brooks, 406 U.S. at 608); see also  Brooks, 406 U.S. at 609 
(“none would deny that the choice itself may pose serious 
dangers to the success of an accused’s defense”).  As observed 
by the Supreme Court in Brooks, a defendant’s choice to take the 
stand “carries with it serious risks of impeachment and cross -
examination” and may also “open the door to otherwise 
inadmissible evidence which is damaging to his case.” 406 U.S . 
at 609 (quoting McGautha v. California , 402 U.S. 183, 213 
(1971)). For this reason, our  jurisdiction has adopted 
significant safeguards  to ensure that a defendant’s 
constitutionally-protected decision to testify or not testify   is 
made knowingly, intelligently, and free of state coercion.   See, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Holbron, 80 Hawai i at 32 n.12, 904 P.2d at 917 n.12 (quoting 
Suka, 79 Hawai i at 299, 901 P.2d at 1278). 
52
  
 
 
  
 
  It is  also  “well-settled that ‘the right of one 
charged with a crime to counsel is deemed fundamental and 
essential to a fair trial.’” Mundon, 121 Hawai i at 366, 219 
P.3d at 1153 (alterations omitted) (quoting Gideon v. 
Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 344 (1963)). A de fendant may “lack[] 
both the skill and knowledge to adequately prepare” and present 
his or her defense, and for this reason,  it is crucial that the 
defendant is provided with the “guiding hand of counsel at every 
step in the proceedings against him.”  Id. (quoting  Geders v. 
United States, 425 U.S. 80, 89 (1976)).   In this regard, defense 
counsel’s advisement regarding the tactical advantages and 
disadvantages of taking the stand is crucially important to a defendant who must make the decision whether to waive the 
privilege against self-incrimination and testify in his or her 
defense. Tachibana , 79 Hawai i at 232, 900 P.2d at 1299.   By 
restricting the ability of the defendant to freely make this 
significant decision with the informed advice of counsel, the 
court “exceeds its judicial power and authority” by interfering 
with counsel’s ability to provide representation and “invad[ing]  
the province of the attorney- client relationship.” Silva, 78 
Hawaii at 125, 890 P.2d at 712.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
e.g., Tachibana , 79 Hawai i at 236, 900 P.2d at 1303; Monteil , 
134 Hawai i at 371, 341 P.3d at 577. 
53
  
 
 
  Finally, it is of paramount importance  that defendants 
in our jurisdiction are “accorded ‘a meaningful opportunit y to 
present a complete defense ’” in order to satisfy the guarantees  
that due process affords.  State v. Matafeo , 71 Haw. 183, 185, 
787 P.2d 671, 672 (1990) (quoting California v. Trombetta , 467 
U.S. 479, 485 (1984)). “A primary reason that a defendant is  
guaranteed effective assistance of counsel is to ensure that the 
defendant is not denied due process,”  State v. Tetu, 139 Hawai i 
207, 219, 386 P.3d 844, 856 (2016), because counsel helps ensure  
that the defendant is able to present the defense of his or her 
choosing and receives a fundamentally fair trial.  Requiring defense counsel to present the testimony of the defendant first, 
rather than following the presentation of the remainder of the 
case, undermines the ability of counsel to plan and present the  
defense’s case.   Where no other defense witnesses have 
testified, counsel may be bound to frame questioning differently 
or elicit a broader swathe of testimony, thereby increasing the 
“serious risks of impeachment and cross -examination.” Brooks, 
406 U.S. at 609.  A trial   court’s interference with the 
defendant’s ability to make an informed, unrestricted decision whether to waive a critical constitutional privilege undermine   s  
“that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept of justice.” Grindles , 70 Haw. at 532, 777 P.2d at 1190 (quoting 
Lisenba v. California , 314 U.S. 219, 236 (1941)).    
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
54

  
 
 
   Our caselaw is  thus  clear that each of the three 
constitutional rights that were violated by the circuit court is  
fundamentally important in guaranteeing to the accused a fair 
trial.   And, because of their complementary protections, these  
provisions may overlap to strengthen the constitutional rights afforded to criminal defendants in the adversarial process.  
  Additionally
 , an application of   harmless error review  
in this case would require appellate courts to engage in 
unguided speculation regarding the impact of the three constitutional violations on the subsequent conviction. See  
Cramer, 129 Hawai i at 303, 299 P.3d at 763.   By nature of the 
court’s error in restricting the defendant’s decision whether 
and when to take the stand, the defendant is compelled to either  
invoke the constitutional right to remain silent or  to waive  the 
privilege against self-incrimination and testify in his or her 
own defense. An assessment of the error’s impact on conviction  
presents several significant difficulties that would ultimately render it impossible to reliably determine whether there was a 
reasonable possibility that the error might have contributed to 
the defendant’s  conviction. See Holbron , 80 Hawai i at 32, 904  
P.2d at 917 (setting forth harmless error review standard).    
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
First, the harmlessness inquiry would require the 
court to speculate as to what choice the  defendant  may have made 
as to testifying if he or she were afforded the opportunity to 
55

  
 
 
not choose until after presentation of the defense’s case. 
Second, it would require the court to speculate as to what 
guidance defense counsel   would have given  after  counsel’s 
presentation of  the defense and assessment of   the actual  
strengths and weaknesses  of the case, as well as whether the 
26 defendant would in fact have heeded counsel’s advice.   Third, 
in cases where the defendant invoked the privilege to remain  
silent but may have testified absent the court’s erroneo us 
directive, the appellate court would be required to surmise  the  
entirety  of the defendant’s testimony  to assess how the 
conviction may have been impacted. Similarly, if the defendant  
took the stand following the court’s error,  it would be 
impossible to determine how the content of the testimony, 
including cross-examination and impeachment,  would have differed  
                                                         
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
26 Even when the remaining defense witnesses are subsequently unable 
to give testimony, the impact of the trial court’s error is similarly 
speculative. Defense counsel’s advice on whether to take the stand is often 
influenced by what counsel anticipates the defense witnesses may testify to 
and the relative strengths, weaknesses, and comprehensiveness of their 
testimony. In this situation, the appellate court would be required to 
speculate whether and how, had defense counsel known that the witnesses would 
be unable to testify, the advice would have differed.  The circumstances of 
State v. Sale, 110 Hawai i 386, 133 P.3d 815 (App. 2006), present an 
instructive example. In that case, the defendant was required by the court 
to decide whether he would testify prior to resolving the availability of his 
only other witness. Id. 
at 390-92, 133 P.3d at 819 -21.  The defendant 
elected to take the stand, and it was subsequently determined that his 
witness would be unable to testify because he would invoke his own privilege 
against self- incrimination that related to the charge against the defendant.  
Id. Assessing the impact of error on conviction would have required an 
appellate court to speculate as to what advice the defendant’s counsel would 
have given had counsel known that the witness would be deemed unavailable and unable to give testimony in the defendant’s cas e. 
56
  
 
 
had the defendant  been permitted to testify following 
presentation of the remainder of the defense’s case.   
Consequently, given the multitude of factors that influence the 
defendant’s personal decision to testify , defense  counsel’s 
professional advisement regarding the choice  to testify, and 
counsel’s presentment of the defense ’s  case, it would be 
27 “virtually impossible” to assess the impact of the violation.   
Harter, 134 Hawai i at 328 n.24, 340 P.3d at 4  60 n.24 (quoting   
Holloway, 435 U.S. at 490).  
   
 
  
 
   
 
 
  
  
                                                        
  
 
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The 
circuit court’s procedures in this case 
represented direct state interference with the exercise of three 
core, fundamental rights. The nature of these three 
constitutional rights, their importance in this jurisdiction in 
guaranteeing to the accused a fair trial, and the speculation 
that would be required were an appellate court to gauge the 
impact of their violation on conviction under harmless error 
review manifest that the error in this cas e can “never be deemed 
28 harmless”  under the Hawai i Constitution. Holbron, 80 Hawai i 
27 The ICA’s analysis in Kido, 102 Hawaii at 379, 76 P.3d at 622, is 
instructive. In Kido, harmless error analysis required the ICA to speculate 
whether the defendant would have testified absent the court’s error; the ICA 
guessed that had the court permitted the defendant to testify after his other 
witness, “perhaps [the defendant] would then have been well advised to leave 
well enough alone.” 102 Hawai i at 379, 76 P.3d at 622. 
28 We further observe that classification of the error at issue here 
as structural protects against a particular violation of three fundamental 
(continued. . .) 
57
  
 
 
   
 
 
  
  
 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                   
 
 
 
  
 
   
 30  Because we conclude that the error in this case is structural and 
therefore not subject to harmless error review, we do not address the State’s 
contention that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
at 32 n.12, 904 P.2d at 917 n.12 (quoting Suka, 79 Hawai i at 
299, 901 P.2d at 1278).29 Thus, consistent with our prior 
decision in Grindles , 70 Haw. at 534, 777 P.2d at 1192, the 
error in this case
--which consisted of a violation of three 
fundamental constitutional rights--is structural and therefore 
requires vacatur of the defendant’s convi ction and remand of the 
30case for a new trial.
IV. CONCLUSION 
The circuit court erred when it restricted Loher in 
deciding whether and when in the course of presenting his 
defense he should take the stand, thereby violating his 
constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, his 
constitutional right to the assistance of counsel, and his right 
(. . .continued) 
constitutional rights that is “easy to identify” and “easy for the government 
to prevent.” Strickland , 466 U.S. at 692 (reasoning that prejudice is 
presumed in actual or constructive d enials of counsel and “various kinds of 
state interference with counsel’s assistance” in part because such violations 
are “easy for the government to prevent”); see also  People v. Mitchell,
 560 
N.W.2d 600, 605 (Mich. 1997) (describing this presumption of prejudice as a 
“prophylactic approach”). 
29 Therefore, to the extent that the ICA in prior decisions has 
applied harmless error analysis to violations of the principles set forth in 
Grindles , 70 Haw. 528, 777 P.2d 1187, these decisions are overruled. See

error analysis does not apply to the circuit court’s error. 
Based on the foregoing, the circuit  court’s July 18, 2001 
Judgment is vacated, and the case  is remanded for a new trial.
