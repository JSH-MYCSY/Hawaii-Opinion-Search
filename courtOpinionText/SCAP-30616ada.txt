I. Introduction
 
Petitioner/Court-Appointed Counsel-Appellant David
 
Bettencourt (“Bettencourt”) appeals from the order of the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit’s administrative judge
 
summarily reducing 
excess court-appointed attorney’s fees

    Payment in excess of any maximum provided for under
paragraphs (1) to (6) may be made whenever the court in
which the representation was rendered certifies that the
amount of the excess payment is necessary to provide fair
compensation and the payment is approved by the
administrative judge of that court.

certified by the trial judge as necessary to provide fair
 
compensation. We have accepted Bettencourt’s appeal as a
 discretionary transfer under Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 
602-58(b)(1)(1993 & Supp. 2010), as this case presents a
 
question of first impression regarding the scope of the
 
administrative judge’s authority under HRS § 802-5(b)(1992 &
 
We hold that, under HRS § 802-5(b), both the trial judge
 
and the administrative judge independently review excess fee
 
requests to determine whether a fee award is “fair
 compensation.” Both the trial judge’s and administrative
 judge’s orders awarding fees under HRS § 802-5(b) are judicial
 acts subject to appellate review under the abuse of discretion
 
1 HRS § 802-5(b) states: 
The court shall determine the amount of reasonable
 
compensation to appointed counsel, based on the rate of $90
an hour; provided that the maximum allowable fee shall not
exceed the following schedule:
 
(1) Any felony case $6,000
 
(2) Misdemeanor case - jury trial 3,000
(3) Misdemeanor case - jury waived 1,500
(4) Appeals 5,000
(5) Petty misdemeanor case 900
 
(6) Any other type of administrative or judicial proceeding,
including cases arising under section 571-11(1),
571-14(a)(1), or 571-14(a)(2)

standard. In this case, because the administrative judge
 
summarily reduced Bettencourt’s attorney’s fees with no reasons
 given, we cannot determine whether the administrative judge
 abused his discretion in ordering reduced fees. Therefore, we
 vacate the administrative judge’s June 9, 2010 Order and remand
 
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
 
II.	 Background
 
A. 	The Underlying Criminal Case, State v. Gonda, Cr. No. 08­
1-1534
 
On October 10, 2008, the circuit court appointed
 
Bettencourt to represent Joshua Gonda in State v. Gonda, Cr.
 
No. 08-1-1534, nunc pro tunc to the date of the indictment
 charging Gonda with the following offenses:
 
Count I: Attempted Murder in the First Degree
Counts II and III: Attempted Murder in the Second Degree
Counts IV, V, VI: Carrying or Use of Firearm in the
Commission of a Separate Felony
Count VII: Place to Keep Pistol or Revolver
2
 
Gonda was accused of shooting a sixteen-year-old passenger in a
 
car on Moanalua Freeway. The sixteen-year-old survived but was
 
paralyzed from the chest down. Gonda faced a maximum penalty of
 
life imprisonment without the possibility of parole if
 
convicted.
 
Before trial commenced, the State filed a Motion for Nolle Prosequi without
Prejudice as to Count VII.
 
3
 2  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
Bettencourt represented Gonda before trial judge Michael
 
Town (“trial judge”) for the duration of the case, from his
 
appointment in early October 2008 through the end of trial in
 late January 2010 (approximately sixteen months). Jury
 selection and trial took place over the course of fourteen days
 in January 2010. After the jury deliberated for one day, it
 returned a not guilty verdict as to all counts, and a Judgment
 of Acquittal was subsequently entered.
 
B. Bettencourt’s Attorney’s Fees Requests
 
Bettencourt filed two requests for his own fees as
 
appointed counsel. First, on October 29, 2009, Bettencourt
 
requested excess attorney’s fees for the billing period from
 
September 30, 2008 through July 31, 2009, in the amount of
 $19,188.00, representing 213.2 hours, billed at the statutory
 rate of $90.00 per hour. The trial judge certified the entire
 amount; administrative judge Richard Perkins (“administrative
 judge”) approved the lesser amount of $18,567.00, representing
 206.3 hours, billed at the statutory rate of $90.00 per hour.
 The administrative judge crossed out entries on Bettencourt’s
 submitted time sheets indicating that he would not allow
 Bettencourt to bill attorney’s fees for making copies of
 documents, which is not legal work. This attorney’s fee request
 is not the subject of the instant appeal.
 
4
   
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
Second, on March 17, 2010 (after the trial), Bettencourt
 
submitted his Amended Request for Attorney’s Fees to the
 
circuit court, for the billing period covering August 1, 2009
 through January 28, 2010, requesting $38,529.00 in excess
 attorney’s fees for 428.1 hours of work, in addition to the
 
previously approved $18,567.00 for 206.3 hours of work. The
 
trial judge certified the total amount of fees requested on
 
March 22, 2010. The administrative judge approved only
 $26,640.00 of Bettencourt’s requested attorney’s fees on June
 
9, 2010, which amounts to a cut of $11,889 in fees. No
 
notations were made as to whether the administrative judge
 
reduced the fees by some percentage, reduced the fee rate for
 all hours claimed, or reduced the amount of hours of work
 billed. Viewed as a percentage, the reduction is an
 approximate 31% cut in the amount of fees requested. Viewed as
 a reduction to the hourly rate, 428.1 hours of work at
 
approximately $62 per hour, rather than at the statutory
 
maximum rate of $90 an hour, were approved. Viewed in terms of
 
hours, 296 hours at the statutory rate of $90, rather than
 428.1 hours at the statutory rate, were approved.
 
In addition to making no notations on Bettencourt’s time
 
worksheets as to which billed items he disallowed, the
 administrative judge provided no written explanation for the
 
5
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
reduction beyond what was documented by his clerk in an
 
internal court memorandum, which was eventually appended to
 Bettencourt’s second fee request. According to the internal
 memorandum, dated June 9, 2010, addressed to the Fiscal Office
 
from the 8th Division Law Clerk, the reason for the reduction
 
in fees was as follows:
 
The reason that the request for attorney fee totals do
not match the hourly worksheet totals is that [the
administrative judge] summarily reduced the amount.
Because the attorney requested an amount of compensation
over the $6,000 statutory limit, [the administrative
judge] was entitled per the Crim. Admin. Order to
summarily reduce the fees granted by the court to a
reasonable amount.
 
Therefore, there are no changes that I can make to the
hourly worksheet totals, since the changes were summarily
made by [the administrative judge] based on his
discretion and were not based on particular inaccuracies
or errors in the hourly worksheets.
 
Criminal Administrative Order (“CAO”) No. 1.1, part II
reads: “Court-appointed counsel are entitled to
reasonable compensation for necessary fees [HRS § 802-5].
The Court determines the amount of reasonable
 
compensation based upon statutory limits. If a request
appears unreasonable, the court may summarily reduce or
 
deny it.”
 
Likewise, CAO No. 1.1, Part II, 4 “Payment Exceeding
Maximum Fees” reads, in pertinent part: “Where the
presiding judge . . . determines that the excess payment
is not necessary to provide fair compensation, the amount
 
may be summarily reduced.”
 
(emphasis in original).
 
The 8th division law clerk’s memorandum referred to
 
Criminal Administrative Order (“C.A.O.”) 1.1, which read in
 
pertinent part: 
II. REQUESTS FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES
 
6
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
Court-appointed counsel are entitled to reasonable
compensation for necessary fees [HRS § 802-5]. The Court
 
determines the amount of reasonable compensation based
 
upon statutory limits. If a request appears
unreasonable, the court may summarily reduce or deny it. 
Reasonable compensation for fees is based upon the
following:
 
A. Fee Schedule
 
1. Maximum Fees [HRS § 802-5(b)]
 
a. Felony case $6,000
 
. . . .
 
2. Compensation Rate [HRS § 802-5(b)]
 
$90 per hour
 
. . . . 
4. 	Payment Exceeding Maximum Fees [HRS § 802-5(b)]
Payment in excess of the statutory maximum is
within the discretion of the Court. Such
 
payment may be made if 1) the presiding trial
judge certifies that the excess payment is
necessary for fair compensation and 2) the
Administrative Judge approves. Where the
 presiding judge or Administrative Judge
determines that the excess payment is not
necessary to provide fair compensation, the
amount may be summarily reduced.
 
(emphasis in original, footnote omitted).
 
Coincidentally, on the same day that the administrative
 
judge reduced Bettencourt’s court-appointed attorney’s fees,
 
Chief Justice Ronald T. Y. Moon issued a June 9, 2010 Order
 Rescinding Statewide Court Administrative Orders and Memoranda. 
The Order stated:
 
It appears that previously approved statewide court
administrative orders or memoranda include requirements
that are more appropriate for court rules than for
administrative orders and memoranda and that revised
 administrative orders and memoranda have not been
 submitted for my review, as instructed by my May 24, 2007
memorandum to the Chief Judges. Therefore,
 
7
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to Article VI, § 6
of the Hawai' i Constitution and effective immediately upon
filing of this order, that all previously approved
statewide circuit, family, and district courtadministrative orders or memoranda are hereby rescinded.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative
 
Director shall cause any such administrative orders or
memoranda published on the Judiciary’s web page(s) to be
removed therefrom and shall not permit posting of any
administrative order or memorandum unless approved by the
Chief Justice.
 
(emphasis added). The order was time-stamped filed at 9:57
 
a.m. on June 9, 2010. There is no time stamp accompanying the
 administrative judge’s approval of $26,640 in fees on June 9,
 2010.
 
C. The Instant Appeal
 
Bettencourt timely appealed to the ICA, and his timely
 
application for transfer to this court was accepted. An order
 granting or denying attorney’s fees under HRS § 802-5 is an
 appealable final order. See State v. Pzeradzki, 6 Haw. App. 20,
 
21, 709 P.2d 105, 107 (1985). Bettencourt argues that the
 
administrative judge, in reducing his fees, engaged in a
 
standardless independent review of the trial judge’s
 certification of his attorney’s fees, abused his discretion by
 leaving no reasons on the record for the fee reduction, did not
 afford Bettencourt notice and an opportunity to be heard before
 reducing his fees, erroneously relied on C.A.O. 1.1, and was
 most likely driven by impermissible financial and budgetary
 
motives. Bettencourt argues that the administrative judge’s
 
8
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
review of the trial court’s certification of “fair
 
compensation” should be deferential. He argues further that
 
arbitrary excess fee reductions pose a constitutional threat to
 
the indigent defendant’s right to competent legal
 representation and the court-appointed attorney’s right to due
 process and interest in fair compensation.
 
The State of Hawai' i (“State”), through the Attorney 
General, argues that HRS § 802-5 was not intended to fully compensate court-appointed attorneys, that HRS § 802-5(b) sets forth a standard of “fair compensation” that applies to the trial judge but not the administrative judge, that the administrative judge has unfettered discretion to grant or deny excess attorney’s fees, and that the administrative judge was not required to set forth reasons for reducing Bettencourt’s fees. 
As a threshold matter, both parties dispute whether C.A.O.
 
1.1 was in effect at the time of the administrative judge’s
 order reducing fees and whether C.A.O. 1.1 authorized the
 reduction in fees. We need not decide this issue. To the
 extent that C.A.O. 1.1 permitted a summary reduction of excess
 attorney’s fees, it conflicts with this court’s case law,
 
namely In re Attorney’s Fees of Reinhard Mohr, 97 Hawai' i 1, 32 
P.3d 647 (2001), which held that an order awarding attorney’s 
9
       3,000
 
       1,500
 
                              5,000
 
             
    900
 
     3,000.
   
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
fees under HRS § 802-5 is a judicial act subject to review
 
under the abuse of discretion standard. Were summary reduction
 permissible, potentially arbitrary and capricious reductions to
 
excess fee awards would be shielded from appellate review. The
 
summary reduction of attorney’s fees is not authorized under
 
HRS § 802-5(b) and Mohr.
 
III. Discussion
 
The statute at issue in this case is HRS § 802-5(b), which
 
states, in relevant part:
 
The court shall determine the amount of reasonable
 
compensation to appointed counsel, based on the rate of
$90 an hour; provided that the maximum allowable fee
shall not exceed the following schedule: 
$6,000
(1) Any felony case 
(2) Misdemeanor case - jury trial   
(3) Misdemeanor case - jury waived 
(4)
 Appeals 
(5) Petty misdemeanor case (6) Any other type of administrative or judicial
proceeding, including cases arising under section 571­11(1), 571-14(a)(1), or 571-14(a)(2) 
Payment in excess of any maximum provided for under
paragraphs (1) to (6) may be made whenever the court in
which the representation was rendered certifies that the
amount of the excess payment is necessary to provide fair
compensation and the payment is approved by the
administrative judge of that court.
 
(emphasis added). The statute appears to envision two levels
 
of review based on the legislature’s choice of two different
 
verbs for each level of review. First, the trial court
 
“certifies” the amount requested is necessary to provide fair
 
10
   3 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
compensation. Second, the administrative judge of the court
 
“approve[s]” the amount. The question is, what was the scope
 of review the legislature intended at the “certifying” and at
 the “approving” stages? The legislative history of the act and
 its many amendments is completely silent as to the meaning of
 these terms.
 
We could look to other statutes providing for excess
 
attorney’s fees for court-appointed attorneys representing
 indigent clients to seek guidance in construing the statute in
 pari materia. See HRS § 1-16 (2009). One such statute is HRS
 
§ 571-87 (2006 & Supp. 2010),3
 which authorizes fees for court-
HRS § 571-87(b) reads, in relevant part:
 
The court shall determine the amount of reasonable compensation
paid to appointed counsel and guardian ad litem, based on the
following rates:
 
(1) $90 an hour for in-court services provided by an attorney
licensed to practice law in the State; and
 
(2) $60 an hour for:
 (A) Out-of-court services provided by an attorney licensed to
practice law in the State; and
 
(B) All services provided by a person who is not an attorney
licensed to practice law in the State, whether performed in-court
or out-of-court.
 
(c) The maximum allowable fee shall not exceed the following
schedule:
 
(1) Cases arising under chapters [587A] and 346, part X:
 (A). Predisposition.......................... $3,000;
 (B). Postdisposition review hearing.......... $1,000;
 (2) Cases arising under chapters 560, 571, 580, and
 584.......................................... $3,000.
 Payments in excess of any maximum provided for under paragraphs
(1) and (2) may be made whenever the court in which the
representation was rendered certifies, based upon representations
of extraordinary circumstances, attested to by the applicant, that
the amount of the excess payment is necessary to provide fair
 
11
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
appointed counsel and guardians ad litem in family court cases
 
involving child protective services or adult protective
 
services. Like HRS § 802-5(b), HRS § 571-87(b) provides for
 
excess attorney’s or guardian ad litem fees when, in addition
 
to the applicant’s representation of extraordinary
 circumstances, the trial court “certifies” the amount as
 necessary to provide fair compensation and the administrative
 judge of the court “approve[s]” the amount. However, the
 legislative history to that statute and its many amendments is
 also silent as to the scope of each level of review.
 
We could also turn to the Criminal Justice Act, 18 U.S.C. §
 
3006A (2000 & Supp. 2011), which is the federal analog to HRS
 Chapter 802, as an interpretive aid. This court and the
 legislature have frequently looked to the federal statute for
 guidance. See Mohr, 97 Haw. at 32, 32 P.3d at 657 (Ramil, J.,
 
concurring); Stand. Comm. Rep. 234 in 1987 Senate Journal at 988
 (comparing state and federal statutes providing excess
 compensation for extended and complex cases). 18 U.S.C. §
 3006A(d)(3) states, in relevant part: 
Waiving maximum amounts. Payment in excess of any maximum
amount provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection may be
made for extended or complex representation whenever the
court in which the representation was rendered, or the
United States magistrate if the representation was furnished
exclusively before him, certifies that the amount of the
 
compensation in light of those circumstances, and the payment is
approved by the administrative judge of that court.
 
(emphasis added).
 
12
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
excess payment is necessary to provide fair compensation and
the payment is approved by the chief judge of the circuit.
The chief judge of the circuit may delegate such approval
authority to an active or senior circuit judge.
 
(emphasis added).
 
In interpreting the difference in roles between the district
 
judge, who “certifies” excess attorney’s fees and the chief
 
judge, who “approves” excess fee certifications, the federal
 chief judges of the district courts have explained that each
 exercises independent judgment in reviewing fees. See United
 
States v. Harper, 311 F.Supp. 1072, 1072-73 (D.D.C. 1970) (“The
 District Judge approved the voucher as submitted. On the basis
 of my independent examination of the voucher and the files and
 records in the case, I endorsed the application. . . .[I]t is my
 practice to endorse the [excess fee] application with a brief
 statement explaining my action.”); see also United States v.
 Sepulveda, 502 F.Supp.2d 1104, 1106 (D. Mont. 2007) (“The process
 [of approving excess fees] is not one involving a ‘rubber stamp.’ 
It is a meaningful congressionally mandated step that requires
 detailed justification not only by the lawyer, but also by the
 approving judge.”); see also United States v. D’Andrea, 612 F.2d
 1386, 1388 (7th Cir. 1980) (“We cannot conclude that this duty
 [approving excess fees] is solely ministerial[.]”). Thus, the
 federal courts envision two distinct levels of independent
 examination of attorney’s fee requests, each of which must be
 concluded with a justification for the award given. We are
 
13
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
persuaded that both the trial judge and the administrative judge 
exercise de novo review over attorney fee requests in excess of the statutory maximum set forth under HRS § 802-5(b), with any reduction in fee accounted for by a statement of reasons as to why the modified fee award constitutes “fair compensation.” 
In this case, the trial judge certified that the full amount 
of attorney’s fees was reasonable and necessary to provide fair compensation. 
The administrative judge, on the other hand, 
approved a lesser amount as reasonable and necessary to provide fair compensation, but no reasons were given as to why. Although we have not previously expressly held that the administrative 
judge must provide justification for a reduced attorney’s fee 
award, case law interpreting HRS § 802-5, as explained below, 
reasonably leads to that conclusion. 
The leading case interpreting HRS § 802-5 is  
In re 
Attorney’s Fees of Reinhard Mohr, 97 Hawai' i 1, 32 P.3d 647 
(2001). In that case, the ICA approved in part and denied in part a court-appointed appellate defense counsel’s (“Mohr”) request for attorney’s fees under HRS § 802-5. 97 Hawai' i at 3, 
32 P.3d at 649. Mohr requested fees in the amount of $1,412.00 for 35.3 hours of service, in support of which he appended worksheets detailing 2 hours of client contact, 21.3 hours of research, and 10.9 hours of reading and drafting court documents; 1.1 hours were unaccounted for in the worksheets. 97 Hawai' i at 
14
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
4, 6, 32 P.3d at 650, 652. The ICA approved only $292.00 in
 
fees, representing 7.3 hours of service, and Mohr appealed to
 
this court. 97 Hawai' i at 4, 32 P.2d at 650. 
We held that the ICA abused its discretion in reducing
 
Mohr’s fee award. 97 Hawai' i at 6, 32 P.3d at 652. While we 
agreed that Mohr’s fees should be reduced for various reasons, we 
concluded that the ICA abused its discretion in allowing only 2.2 
hours out of 21.3 hours documented for research. 97 Hawai' i at 
8, 32 P.3d at 654. We therefore ultimately ordered that Mohr be
 
compensated for 15.35 at the statutory hourly rate (then $40 for
 
out-of-court work), or $614.00. Id.
 
Notable in our treatment of Mohr’s appeal was our reliance
 
on the record created by Mohr:
 
[W]e also recognize that every review of a fee request
requires an analysis of evidence and an application of
statutory standards. Such analysis and application is a
judicial process like any other original proceeding in which
evidence is taken and law is applied. It is an adjudication
of the appointed attorney’s private, statutory right to be
compensated for the work the attorney has done, and the
attorney bears the burden of adducing evidence sufficient to
justify his or her claim.
 
97 Hawai' i at 5, 32 P.3d at 651. 
In this case, however, the analysis of attorney’s fees is
 
not as easy to perform for several reasons. First, Mohr’s
 
request was for a relatively low amount, generated by relatively
 few hours of work on an appeal. The nature of appellate work is
 subject to ready evaluation by this court, which reviews similar
 
15
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
 
attorney’s fees requests for work performed before it. Thus,
 
even though the ICA reduced Mohr’s fees without explanation, we
 were able to evaluate Mohr’s fee requests against the work
 performed to arrive at what was reasonable compensation for Mohr.
 
In the instant case, however, Bettencourt has requested
 
hundreds of hours’ worth of fees, six times the limit set forth
 
by statute for court-appointed representation in a felony case.
 
Mohr, on the other hand, requested fees well within the statutory
 
maximum. 97 Hawai' i at 3, 3 n.3, 32 P.3d at 649, 649 n.3. 
Bettencourt’s client faced a multi-count indictment (with counts 
including attempted first and second degree murder) with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The representation included a fourteen-day trial, culminating in an acquittal on all counts. The trial judge (in particular) and administrative judge are the ones most capable of
 
evaluating whether the compensation Bettencourt requested was
 
fair in light of the work he performed.
 
Second, in the instant case, the record does not indicate
 
whether the administrative judge performed an “analysis of
 
evidence and an application of statutory standards” before
 
summarily reducing Bettencourt’s fee award.  There is no
 
indication of which billable items were disallowed or reduced. 
As a result, we cannot ascertain whether the administrative judge
 
16
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
abused his discretion in deciding that $26,640 was reasonable and 
necessary to provide fair compensation to Bettencourt. 
IV. Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, we hold that (1) under HRS § 802­
5(b), both the trial judge and the administrative judge
 
independently review excess fee requests to determine whether a
 fee award is “fair compensation”; (2) both the trial judge’s and
 administrative judge’s orders awarding fees under HRS § 802-5(b)
 are judicial acts subject to appellate review under the abuse of
 discretion standard; and (3) to enable appellate review of
 excess fee awards, if a fee request is reduced, it is
 necessary for the judge reducing the request to set forth
 
reasons for the reduction. Accordingly, we vacate the
 administrative judge’s June 9, 2010 Order and remand for further
 proceedings consistent with this opinion.
