OPINION OF THE COURT BY MCKENNA, J.
 
I. Introduction
 
The United States District Court for the District of Hawaii1
 
2
(“District Court”) certified the following question  to this
court:
 
May food or beverage service employees of a hotel or
restaurant bring a claim against their employer based on an
alleged violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. § 481B-14 by invoking
Haw. Rev. Stat. §§ 388-6, 388-10, and 388-11 and without
invoking Haw. Rev. Stat. §§ 480-2 or 480-13?
 
The instant certified question picks up where our opinion on a
 
related certified question in Davis v. Four Seasons Hotel, Ltd.,
 
122 Hawai‘ i 423, 428 n.12, 228 P.3d 303, 308 n.12 (2010) left 
off: “Employees also contend that Employees can enforce HRS §
 
481B-14 through HRS §§ 388-6, 10, and 11. However, this argument
 will not be addressed because it is beyond the scope of the
 
1 The Honorable Leslie E. Kobayashi, United States District Judge,
presided.
 
2 The District Court had also certified the following two questions to
this court: 
2. If food or beverage service employees of a hotel or
restaurant are entitled to enforce Haw. Rev. Stat. [§] 481B­
14 through Haw. Rev. Stat. §§ 388-6, 388-10, and 388-11,
what statute of limitations applies?
3. May food and beverage service employees of a hotel or
restaurant bring a claim under Haw. Rev. Stat. § 480-2(e)
for an alleged violation of Haw. Rev. Stat. § 481B-14, where
those employees have alleged that their employer’s conduct
has caused them injury that resulted from an unfair method
of competition?
This court issued an Order on Certified Question, ordering, “without
conclusively determining whether this court will answer question #1,” (the
instant question) that only that question is amenable to answer pursuant to
Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 13 (2011), as it “concerns the law
of Hawai‘ i that is determinative of the plaintiffs’ cause and that there is no
clear controlling precedent in the Hawai‘ i judicial decisions.” Therefore,
questions 2 and 3 are not before this court.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
certified question.” The parties fully briefed their positions,
 
and we also granted leave to file amicus briefs to Four Seasons
 Hotel, Ltd. (“Four Seasons amicus”) and Raymond Gurrobat, Loretta
 Chong, Marti Smith, Jonalen Kelekoma, and Darren Miyasato
 (“Gurrobat amici”). The amici curiae have also fully briefed
 this court. 
We now answer the certified question in the affirmative and
 
hold that when a hotel or restaurant applying a service charge
 for the sale of food or beverage services allegedly violates HRS
 § 481B-14 (2008) (1) by not distributing the full service charge
 directly to its employees as “tip income” (in other words, as
 “wages and tips of employees”), and (2) by failing to disclose
 this practice to the purchaser of the services, the employees may
 bring an action under HRS §§ 388-6 (1993), -10 (1993 & Supp.
 1999), and -11 (1993 & Supp. 1999) to enforce the employees’
 rights and seek remedies. 
II. Background
 
The factual background relevant to a certified question 
proceeding “is based primarily upon the information certified to 
this court by the district court, as well as the allegations contained within [the plaintiffs’ complaint].” Davis, 122 
Hawai‘i at 425, 228 P.3d at 305 (citing TMJ Hawaii, Inc. v. 
Nippon Trust Bank, 113 Hawai‘ i 373, 374, 153 P.3d 444, 445 
3
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(2007)(relying upon the information certified to the court by the
 
district court and the facts set forth in the plaintiff’s amended
 complaint).
 
In its Certified Questions to the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court from 
the United States District Court for the District of Hawai‘ i in 
Civ. No. 08-00529 LEK-RLP and Civ. No. 09-0016 LEK-RLP
 (“Certified Questions”), the District Court stated that Bert
 Villon and Mark Apana’s (“Villon Plaintiffs”) Amended Class
 Action Complaint and Reneldo Rodriguez, Johnson Basler, on behalf
 of themselves and all others similarly situated’s (“Rodriguez
 Plaintiffs”) Second Amended Complaint were before it pursuant to
 diversity jurisdiction in accordance with the Class Action
 Fairness Act. In the Villon Plaintiffs’ Amended Class Action
 Complaint, they alleged the following facts:
 
6. For banquets, events, meetings and in other instances,
the defendant [Marriott Hotel Services, Inc., dba Wailea
Marriott Resort (“Marriott” or “Marriott Defendant”)] adds a
preset service charge to customers’ bills for food and
beverage provided at the hotel.
7. However, the defendant does not remit the total proceeds
of the service charge as tip income to the employees who
serve the food and beverages.
8. Instead, the defendant has a policy and practice of
retaining for itself a portion of these service charges (or
using it to pay managers or other non-tipped employees who
do not serve food and beverages).
9. The defendant does not disclose to the hotel’s customers
 
that the service charges are not remitted in full to the
employees who serve the food and beverages.
10. For this reason, customers are misled into believing
that the entire service charge imposed by defendant is being
distributed to the employees who served them food or
beverage when, in fact, a smaller percentage is being
remitted to the servers. As a result, customers who would
otherwise be inclined to leave an additional gratuity for
such servers frequently do not do so because they
 
4
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
erroneously believe that the servers are receiving the
entire service charge imposed by the hotel. 
Marriott does not dispute that Plaintiffs did not receive 100% of
 
service charges and that this fact was not disclosed to
 consumers. 
It appears that, at the time the District Court filed its
 
Certified Questions, the Rodriguez Plaintiffs had filed a 
Third
 
Amended Complaint, which alleged the following facts, similar to
 those alleged in the Villon Plaintiffs’ Amended Class Action
 Complaint:
 
6. For banquets, events, meetings, and in its restaurant
and in other instances, the defendant [Starwood Hotels &
Resorts Worldwide, Inc., dba Westin Maui Resort & Spa
(“Starwood” or “Starwood Defendant”)] adds a preset service
charge of approximately 20% to customers’ bills for food and
beverage provided at the hotel.
7. However, the defendant does not remit the total proceeds
of the service charge as tip income to the employees who
serve the food and beverages.
8. Instead, the defendant has a policy and practice of
retaining for itself a portion of these service charges (or
using it to pay managers or other non-tipped employees who
do not serve food and beverages).
9. The defendant does not adequately disclose to the hotel
and restaurant’s customers that the service charges are not
remitted in full to the employees who serve the food and
beverages.
10. 
For this reason, customers are misled into believing
that the entire service charge imposed by defendant is being
distributed to the employees who served them food or
beverage when, in fact, a smaller percentage is being
remitted to the servers. 
As a result, customers who would
otherwise be inclined to leave an additional gratuity for
such servers frequently do not do so because they
erroneously believe that the servers are receiving the
entire service charge imposed by the hotel, or they believe
that in light of the 20% service charge that no other
gratuity should be paid.
 
. . . . 
13. The defendant’s failure to remit the entire service
 
charge to its employees as tip income or to disclose to its
customers that the service charges [sic] is not remitted in
full to its employees as tip income has resulted in the
plaintiffs’ loss of tip income. 
Plaintiffs have lost tip
 
5
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
income both by not receiving the total proceeds of service
charges that are legally their tip income, as well as by not
receiving tip income that customers would otherwise likely
leave if they were not led to believe that the wait staff
was already receiving a generous gratuity (i.e.[,] the
service charge on the bills).
 
Starwood does not dispute that Plaintiffs did not receive 100% of
 
the service charges and that this fact was not disclosed to
 consumers. 
Both the Villon Plaintiffs’ Amended Class Action Complaint
 
and the Rodriguez Plaintiffs’ Third Amended Complaint allege the
 following as Count V: 
As a result of the defendant’s unlawful failure to remit the
 
entire proceeds of food and beverage service charges to the
food and beverage servers, the plaintiffs have been deprived
of income which constitutes wages, which is actionable under
Hawaii Revised Statutes Section[s] 388-6, 10, and 11.
Pursuant to those statutes, the plaintiffs hereby bring a
claim of unpaid wages, including liquidated damages,
interest, and attorneys’ fees. 
Procedurally, the certified questions arose upon the entry
 
of the following orders in the District Court: (1) Order
 
Administratively Terminating, Without Prejudice, Plaintiffs’
 Motion for Summary Judgment and Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss
 Amended Class Action Complaint, Filed June 28, 2010, filed
 September 8, 2010, in Civil No. 08-00529 LEK-RLP (Villon & Apana
 v. Marriott Hotel Services, Inc., DBA Wailea Marriott Hotel); and
 (2) Order Granting Defendant’s Motion to Certify Questions of
 
Hawai‘i State Law to the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court and 
Administratively Terminating, Without Prejudice, Plaintiffs’
 
Motion for Class Certification, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Partial
 
6
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Summary Judgment, and Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment,
 
filed September 8, 2010, in Civil No. 09-00016 LEK-RLP (Rodriguez
 & Basler v. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., DBA Westin
 Maui Resort & Spa). 
III. Standard of Review
 
A question of law presented by a certified question is 
reviewable de novo under the right/wrong standard of review. 
Francis v. Lee Enters., 89 Hawai‘ i 234, 236, 971 P.2d 707, 709 
(1999)(citation omitted). 
IV. Discussion
 
A. Plain Language
 
Plaintiffs argue that the language of the relevant statutes, 
Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) §§ 481B-14, 388-1 (1993), 388-6, 
388-10, and 388-11, is plain and unambiguous. “[T]he fundamental 
starting point for statutory interpretation is the language of the statute itself. . . . And where the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning.” Richardson v. City & County of 
Honolulu, 76 Hawai‘ i 46, 63, 868 P.2d 1193, 1210 (1994)(citation 
omitted). The plain language of HRS § 481B-14 supports the Plaintiffs’ contention that undisclosed and unpaid service charges are “tips,” “wages,” and “compensation.” HRS § 481B-14 provides: 
7
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Hotel or restaurant service charge; disposition. Any hotel
or restaurant that applies a service charge for the sale of
food or beverage services shall distribute the service
charge directly to its employees as tip income or clearly
disclose to the purchaser of the services that the service
charge is being used to pay for costs or expenses other than
wages and tips of employees. 
First, the statute provides that hotels and restaurants “shall
 
distribute the service charge directly to its employees as tip
 income.” (Emphasis added). In the alternative, HRS § 481B-14
 permits hotels and restaurants to use service charges to “pay for
 costs or expenses other than wages and tips of employees,”
 provided that hotels and restaurants “clearly disclose to the
 purchaser of the services” that this is being done. (Emphasis
 added). Thus, 100% of the service charge is considered to be
 “wages and tips of employees.” Therefore, when a hotel or
 restaurant distributes less than 100% of a service charge
 directly to its employees without disclosing this fact to the
 purchaser, the portion withheld constitutes “tip income,”
 synonymously phrased within HRS § 481B-14 as “wages and tips of
 employees.”
 
The plain language of Chapter 388 also supports the
 
Plaintiffs’ contention that HRS §481B-14 is enforceable through
 HRS §§ 388-6, -10, and -11. Moreover, the provisions of Chapter
 388 regarding withholding wages appear to apply, as HRS § 388-1
 defines “wages” as follows:
 
compensation for labor or services rendered by an employee,
whether the amount is determined on a time, task, piece,
 
8
  3 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
commission, or other basis of calculation. It shall include
 
the reasonable cost, as determined by the director under
chapter 387, to the employer of furnishing an employee with
board, lodging, or other facilities if such board, lodging,
or other facilities are customarily furnished by the
employer to the employer’s employee but shall not include
tips or gratuities of any kind, provided that for the
purposes of section 388-6, “wages” shall include tips or
gratuities of any kind.
 
(Emphasis added). Thus, for the purpose of enforcement under HRS
 
§ 388-6 in the instant proceeding, “wages” includes service
 
3
charges as “tips or gratuities of any kind,”  because HRS § 481B­
14 defines service charges as “tip income” and “wages and tips of
 employees.” HRS § 388-6 is entitled “Withholding of wages,” and
 prohibits an employer from “retain[ing] . . . any part or portion
 of any compensation earned by the employee except where required
 by federal or state statute or by court process or when such . .
 . retentions are authorized in writing by the employee. . . .” 
Service charges must be “compensation earned” by the employee,
 because they are levied upon the consumer based upon “labor or
 
The parties point out that this court has already addressed whether a
certain type of service charge (hotel porterage fees) could constitute
“gratuities of any kind” in Heatherly v. Hilton Hawaiian Village Joint
Venture, 78 Hawai‘ i 351, 893 P.2d 779 (1995). In Heatherly, plaintiffs (hotel
bellhops) challenged the circuit court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of
the hotel on the issue of whether porterage fees counted towards the
employer’s tip credit in determining the bellhops’ minimum wage. 78 Hawai‘ i 
at 352, 893 P.2d at 780. Heatherly, however, is not helpful in determining
whether service charges under HRS § 481B-14 are “gratuities of any kind” for
two reasons. First, the Heatherly case predates the enactment of HRS § 481B­14 and is thus not helpful in interpreting that statute. Second, theHeatherly case held only, “The trade meaning of ‘gratuities of any kind’ isclearly a ‘fact’ that is material to whether the Hotels are entitled tosummary judgment,” and remanded the case to the circuit court for adetermination of whether “porterage fees are a kind of gratuity or wages
within the meaning of HRS chapter 387.” 78 Hawai‘ i at 355, 359, 893 P.2d at
783, 787. 
9
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
services rendered by an employee,” usually in lieu of a
 
traditional tip. HRS § 388-1. 
Under HRS § 388-10, a violation of HRS § 388-6 subjects the
 
employer to a civil penalty of twice the unpaid wages, plus
 interest: 
Any employer who fails to pay wages in accordance with this
chapter without equitable justification shall be liable to
the employee, in addition to the wages legally proven to be
due, for a sum equal to the amount of unpaid wages and
interest at a rate of six per cent per year from the date
that the wages were due. 
HRS § 388-11(a) gives employees standing to recover unpaid
 
wages, and HRS § 388-11(c) further provides for an award of costs
 
and attorneys’ fees to prevailing employees:
 
(a) Action by an employee to recover unpaid wages may be
maintained in any court of competent jurisdiction by any one
or more employees for and in behalf of oneself or
themselves, or the employee or employees may designate an
agent or representative to maintain the action.
 
. . . .
 (c) The court in any action brought under this section
shall, in addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff
or plaintiffs, allow interest of six per cent per year from
the date the wages were due, costs of action, including
costs of fees of any nature, and reasonable attorney’s fees,
to be paid by the defendant. . . .
 
It is true that HRS § 387-1 (1993) defines “wages” to
 
exclude “tips or gratuities” of any kind, but that is solely for
 
the purpose of calculating the “tip credit” under HRS § 387-2
 (1993 & Supp. 2005), not for the purposes of allowing employers
 
10
    
4 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to withhold “service charges,” “wages and tips of employees,” and
 
“tip income,” from employees under HRS § 388-6.4
 
Hawai‘i Administrative Rules (“HAR”) Rule § 12-20-1 is the 
Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (“DLIR”) regulation
 implementing HRS § 387-1. It defines “tip” to exclude
 “[c]ompulsory or negotiated service charges,” again, for the
 purpose of calculating the “tip credit” under HRS § 387-2, as
 follows:
 
“Tip” means a sum of money determined solely by a customer
and given in recognition of service performed by an employee
who retains it as a gift or gratuity. It may be paid in
cash, bank check, or other negotiable instrument payable at
par as well as amounts transferred by employer to employee
by direction of the credit customer who designates amounts
to be added to the customer’s bill as tips. Compulsory or
negotiated service charges and special gifts in forms other
than described above are not counted as tips.
 
HAR § 12-20-1 is over 30 years old; it became effective on
 
October 2, 1981, nearly 20 years before HRS § 481B-14 was
 enacted. As such, it does not reflect the change HRS § 481B-14
 
HRS § 387-1 defines “wage” to mean, with emphasis added, the following:
legal tender of the United States or checks on banks
convertible into cash on demand at full face value thereof
 and in addition thereto the reasonable cost as determined by
the department, to the employer of furnishing an employee
with board, lodging, or other facilities if such board,
lodging, or other facilities are customarily furnished by
such employer to the employer’s employees. Except for the
purposes of the last sentence of section 387-2, “wage” shall
not include tips or gratuities of any kind.
In turn, the last sentence of HRS § 387-2 (a statutory section setting forth
Hawai
‘i’s “tip credit”) states:
The hourly wage of a tipped employee may be deemed to be
increased on account of tips if the employee is paid notless than 25 cents below the applicable minimum wage by theemployee’s employer and the combined amount the employeereceives from the employee’s employer and in tips is atleast 50 cents more than the applicable minimum wage. 
11
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
made to the definition of wages. Moreover, the plain language of 
HRS § 481B-14 expressly equates 100% of a “service charge” with “tip income” and “wages and tips of employees.” To the extent HRS § 481B-14 has redefined service charges, HAR 12-20-1’s exclusion of service charges under its definition of “tips” is “not entitled to deference if the interpretation is plainly erroneous and inconsistent with both the letter and intent of the 
statutory mandate.” Haole v. State, 111 Hawai‘ i 144, 150, 140 
P.3d 377, 383 (2006)(citations omitted). Further, the DLIR has 
never defined “gratuities of any kind,” which is a category broad enough to encompass service charges. Therefore, the DLIR’s regulations do not serve as a helpful aid in understanding HRS § 481B-14. 
Marriott argues that the undisclosed amount of a service
 
charge is not compensation earned but a “liquidated penalty,”
 which “bears no relation to actual damages, if any, incurred by
 the employees.” However, this argument speaks more to the remedy
 (HRS § 388-10, entitled “Penalties”) rather than the right; an
 undisclosed and unpaid portion of a service charge is still a
 withheld tip or wage, actionable under Chapter 388. In sum, the
 plain language of HRS § 481B-14 and Chapter 388 indicates that a
 service charge is “compensation earned” as “tip income” or “wages
 
12
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and tips of employees.” Therefore, an alleged violation of HRS §
 
481B-14 is enforceable through Chapter 388. 
B. Legislative History of HRS § 481B-14
 
Although resort to legislative history is not necessary
 
when the plain language of a statute is clear, the legislative
 history of HRS § 481B-14 has been put at issue in these
 proceedings, and an examination of that history reveals that
 enforcement of HRS § 481B-14 through Chapter 388 was not an
 “absurd result” that the legislature could not have intended. 
See Survivors of Medeiros v. Maui Land & Pineapple Co., 66 Haw.
 290, 297, 660 P.2d 1316, 1321 (1983)(observing that the plain
 language rule does not preclude this court from examining the
 legislative history to “adequately discern the underlying policy
 which the legislature seeks to promulgate and . . . to determine
 if a literal construction would produce an absurd or unjust
 result, inconsistent with the policies of the statute”). 
HRS § 481B-14 was enacted by Act 16 of the 2000 Legislative
 
Session. 2000 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 16, at 21-22. The
 legislature’s stated purpose in enacting the statute was as
 follows:
 
SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Hawaii’s hotel and
restaurant employees may not be receiving tips or gratuities
during the course of their employment from patrons because
patrons believe their tips or gratuities are being included
in the service charge and being passed on to the employees.
The purpose of this Act is to require hotels and
restaurants that apply a service charge for food or beverage
 
13
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
services, not distributed to employees as tip income, to
advise customers that the service charge is being used to
pay for costs or expenses other than wages and tips of
employees.
 
Id. The legislature’s express findings evince a twofold concern: 
first, that patrons may not know that service charges may be
 
“used to pay for costs or expenses other than wages and tips of
 employees”; and second, that employees “may not be receiving tips
 or gratuities” from these service charges. Id. This dual focus
 
reflects the legislative evolution of H.B. 2123, the bill that
 eventually became Act 16. 
When it was first introduced in the House, H.B. 2123, which
 
was entitled “A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO WAGES AND TIPS OF
 EMPLOYEES,” sought only to “protect employees who receive or may
 receive tips or gratuities during the course of their employment
 from having these amounts withheld or credited to their
 employers.” H.B. 2123, 20th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2000). H.B. 2123
 proposed to amend the definition of “tips” in HRS § 387-1 to mean
 “gratuities in the form of money paid by a customer or added to a
 customer’s charge either voluntarily or as a service charge by
 the employer.” Id. The bill also proposed deleting the tip
 
credit in HRS § 387-2. Id. It also proposed clarifying HRS §
 
388-1’s definition of “wages” to exclude tips for all purposes. 
Id. Lastly, H.B. 2123 proposed to amend HRS § 388-6 so that
 
14
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
employers would be prohibited from withholding tips and service
 
charges in addition to wages. Id. 
H.B. 2123 was first heard by the House Committee on Labor
 
and Employment. Although the Marriott and Starwood Defendants
 and the Four Seasons amicus focus on DLIR Director Lorraine
 Akiba’s testimony that H.B. 2123 would create confusion between
 federal and state law, she actually testified that only a portion
 of the bill (the deletion of the tip credit) would create an
 inconsistency between federal and state tip credit provisions. 
Akiba also testified that including service charges in the
 definition of tips would conflict with HAR § 12-20-1. As
 explained, supra, HRS § 481B-14 trumps HAR § 12-20-1. 
The ILWU’s position was that tips belong to employees. For
 
that reason only, they opposed the inclusion of service charges
 as “tips,” because they were aware of the hotels and restaurants’
 practice of keeping a portion of the service charges and did not
 want that portion attributed to employees for withholding and
 income tax purposes. The Marriott and Starwood Defendants view
 the ILWU’s testimony as supporting their argument that service
 charges should not be treated as tips, but a closer examination
 reveals that the ILWU did not want employees taxed on portions of
 service charges that employers kept. The ILWU also made the
 
15
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
contradictory point that “tips” should be considered “wages”
 
because union dues are based on wages. 
The House Committee on Labor and Employment was swayed
 
mostly by the testimony concerning confusion over the changes to
 the tip credit statute. Rather than persist in its attempts to
 change that provision, it changed its focus and concluded “that
 the problem lies with consumers who may not leave tips for the
 service employees, mistakenly thinking that the service charge
 they paid were tips so they did not leave additional tips for the
 service employees.” H. Stand. Comm. Rep. 479-00, in 2000 House
 Journal, at 1155. Thus, H.B. 2123’s original focus on employees
 was expanded to include concern for uninformed consumers. The
 House Committee on Labor and Employment then deleted the contents
 of the original H.B. 2123 and inserted the following, as H.B.
 2123 H.D. 1:
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO WAGES AND TIPS OF EMPLOYEES.
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 
SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Hawaii’s hotel
and restaurant employees may not be receiving tips or
gratuities during the course of their employment from
patrons because patrons believe their tips or gratuities are
being included in the service charge and being passed on to
the employees.
The purpose of this Act is to advise customers that
the service charge is being used to pay for costs or
expenses other than wages and tips of employees.
SECTION 2. Section 481B, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
amended by adding a new section to be appropriately
designated and to read as follows:
“§481B- Service charge. Any hotel or restaurant
applying a service charge for the sale of food or beverage
services shall distribute the service charge to its
employees or else clearly disclose to the purchaser of such
 
16
       *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
services that the service charge is being used to pay for
costs or expenses other than wages and tips of employees.”
SECTION 3. New statutory material is underscored.
SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect upon its approval.
 
H.B. 2123, H.D. 1, 20th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2000). The bill went
 
to its second and last House referral, the House Finance
 Committee, for hearing. Only Anthony Rutledge and other members
 of Local 5 submitted testimony, and each of them argued that
 service charges belong wholly to the employee; alternatively, if
 a portion of the service charge is retained by the employer, the
 employer must disclose that fact to consumers, who often
 mistakenly assume that the entire service charge goes to
 employees. 
The House Finance Committee drafted a brief Standing
 
Committee Report indicating that the purpose of the bill was to
 “prevent unfair and deceptive business practices by requiring
 hotels or restaurants that apply a service charge for the sale of
 food or beverage, to disclose to the purchaser that the service
 charge is being used to pay for costs or expenses other than
 wages and tips or employees, if the employer does not distribute
 the service charge to its employees.” H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No.
 854-00, in 2000 House Journal, at 1298. 
The House Finance Committee went on to make what it called
 
“technical, nonsubstantive amendments for purposes of clarity and
 style” to the bill, id., and drafted H.B. 2123 H.D. 2, which read
 
17
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
as follows, with the changes between H.B. 2123 H.D. 1 and H.D. 2
 
indicated in Ramseyer format:
 
A BILL FOR AN ACT RELATING TO WAGES AND TIPS OF EMPLOYEES.
 
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF HAWAII:
 
SECTION 1. The legislature finds that Hawaii’s hotel
and restaurant employees may not be receiving tips or
gratuities during the course of their employment from
patrons because patrons believe their tips or gratuities are
being included in the service charge and being passed on to
the employees.
The purpose of this Act is to require hotels and
restaurants that apply a service charge for food or beverage
services, not distributed to employees as tip income, to
advise customers that the service charge is being used for
pay for costs or expenses other than wages and tips of
employees.
SECTION 2. Section 481B, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is
amended by adding a new section to be appropriately
designated and to read as follows:
“§481B- . Service charge. Any hotel or restaurant
that applies a service charge for the sale of food or
beverage services shall distribute the service charge
directly to its employees as tip income or [else] clearly
disclose to the purchaser of the services that [such] the
service charge is being used to pay for costs or expenses
other than wages and tips of employees.”
SECTION 3. 
New statutory material is underscored.
SECTION 4. This Act shall take effect upon its
approval.
 
H.B. 2123, H.D. 2, 20th Leg., Reg. Sess. (2000). The legislature
 
considered the addition of the phrase “as tip income” to be
 “technical [and] nonsubstantive,” probably because, as discussed
 
supra, the phrase appears merely to serve as the equivalent to
 
“wages and tips of employees.” The phrase “as tip income” does
 not, as Marriott argues, render HRS § 481B-14 ambiguous. 
H.B. 2123 H.D.2 passed Third Reading in the House and was
 
transmitted to the Senate, which referred the bill to the Senate
Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection. 2000 Senate
  
18
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Journal, at 301. Local 5 testimony again emphasized that
 
consumers mistakenly assume the entire service charge is paid to
 employees. DLIR Director Akiba testified in support of the bill,
 pointing out, “[I]n reference to the term ‘tip income’ on page 1,
 line 17, the department would consider the distribution of
 service charges as ‘wages’, and not as ‘tips’ for tip credit
 purposes under Chapter 387, HRS, Hawaii Wage and Hour Law, and
 §12-20-1, Hawaii Administrative Rules.” 
The Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection’s
 
Committee Report reflected a truly dual purpose (employee wage
 protection and consumer protection) for H.B. 2123 H.D. 2 towards
 the end of its path through the legislature as follows:
 
The purpose of this measure is to enhance consumer
protection with respect to service charges imposed by hotels
and restaurants on the sale of food and beverages.
 . . . . 

Your Committee finds that it is generally understood
that service charges applied to the sale of food and
beverages by hotels and restaurants are levied in lieu of a
voluntary gratuity, and are distributed to the employees
providing the service. Therefore, most consumers do not tip
for services over and above the amounts they pay as a
service charge.
Your Committee further finds that, contrary to the
above understanding, moneys collected as service charges are
not always distributed to the employees as gratuities and
are sometimes used to pay the employer’s administrative
costs. Therefore, the employee does not receive the money
intended as a gratuity by the customer, and the customer is
misled into believing that the employee has been rewarded
for providing good service.
This measure is intended to prevent consumers from
being misled about the application of moneys they pay as
service charges by requiring under the Unfair and Deceptive
Practices Act that a hotel or restaurant distribute moneys
paid by customers as service charges directly to its
employees as tip income, or disclose to the consumer that
the service charge is being used to pay for the employer’s
costs or expenses, other than wages and tips. . . .

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 3077, in 2000 Senate Journal, at 1286­
87. The bill passed Second Reading. 2000 Senate Journal, at
 
390. H.B. 2123 H.D.2 passed Third Reading, 2000 Senate Journal,
 
at 410, and was later signed into law as Act 16. 2000 Haw. Sess.
 Laws Act 16, at 21-22. 
Throughout H.B. 2123’s journey through the legislature, the
 
concern for employees was never abandoned, even when H.B. 2123
 was gutted and replaced between H.B. 2123 and H.B. 2123 H.D.1. 
We have previously recognized that “the legislative history of
 H.B. 2123 indicates that the legislature was concerned that when a hotel or restaurant withholds a service charge without disclosing to consumers that it is doing so, both employees and 
consumers can be negatively impacted.” Davis, 122 Hawai‘ i at 
434, 228 P.3d at 314 (emphasis added). The dual focus can also 
be viewed as a cause-and-effect relationship: the cause (non­disclosure to consumers) has an effect (employees receiving a smaller gratuity than the customer intended). The legislature sought to prevent or mitigate the effect by removing the cause. 
Due to the legislature’s continued focus on employees’
 
receiving wages and tips, enforcement of a violation of HRS §
 481B-14 through Chapter 388 would not be an absurd result that
 the legislature could not have intended, as the Plaintiffs argue.
 
20
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
C. Reading HRS § 481B-14 and Chapter 388 in Pari Materia
 
Alternatively, HRS § 481B-14 and Chapter 388 can be read in
 
pari materia. “Laws in pari materia, or upon the same subject
 
matter, shall be construed with reference to each other. What is
 clear is one statute may be called in aid to explain what is
 doubtful in another.” HRS § 1-16 (2009). The subject matter of
 Chapter 388 is “Payment of Wages and Other Compensation.” The
 subject matter of HRS § 388-6 is “Withholding of wages,” the
 subject matter of HRS § 388-10 is “Penalties,” and the subject
 matter of HRS § 388-11 is “Employees[’] remedies.” Although the
 title of HRS § 481B-14 is “Hotel or restaurant service charge;
 disposition,” the text of the statute concerns the subject matter
 “tip income” and “wages and tips of employees.” Further, the
 subject matter of HRS § 481B-14, as it was advancing through the
 legislature as H.B. 2123, was reflected in its title, “RELATING
 TO WAGES AND TIPS OF EMPLOYEES.” 
The title of the bill during the legislative process is, as 
the Gurrobat amici argue, “constitutionally significant,” because 
according to the Hawai‘ i Constitution, Article 3, Section 14, 
“Each law shall embrace but one subject, which shall be expressed 
in its title.” Legislative compliance with this section of the 
Hawai‘i Constitution is “mandatory and a violation thereof would 
render an enactment nugatory.” Schwab v. Ariyoshi, 58 Haw. 25, 
21
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
31, 564 P.2d 135, 139 (1977). As the Gurrobat amici argue,
 
however, this court should strive to avoid invalidating statutes
 as unconstitutional whenever a constitutional reading is
 possible. Further, “[E]very enactment of the legislature is
 presumptively constitutional,” and “to nullify it on the grounds
 that it was enacted in violation of the subject-title
 requirements of the State Constitution, the infraction should be
 plain, clear, manifest, and unmistakable.” 58 Haw. at 31, 564
 P.2d at 139. An infraction rising to this level is one in which
 “the title tend[s] to mislead or deceive the people or the [law­making body] as to the purpose or effect of the legislation, or
 to conceal or obscure the same[.]” Territory v. Dondero, 21 Haw.
 
19, 25 (Haw. Terr. 1912). 
As discussed supra, Section IV.B, the title of H.B. 2123,
 
“RELATING TO WAGES AND TIPS OF EMPLOYEES,” reflected the
 legislature’s concern for employee compensation, even as the
 focus of the bill was expanded to provide for prevention of
 withholding of service charges through consumer disclosure. 
Thus, under Schwab and Dondero, the title of H.B. 2123 was
 sufficient to embrace the subject of the bill as it evolved in
 the legislature; it was not misleading, deceptive, or obscure in
 connection to the subject matter of H.B. 2123 in its final
 iteration. 
22
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The Marriott and Starwood Defendants downplay the
 
significance of the title. Marriott argues that the title of H.B.
 
2123 could not change during the legislative process but “does
 
refer to both consumers and employees” in any event. This
 
argument goes more toward whether the statute was validly enacted
 
(and no party argues that it was not), rather than whether the
 title of H.B. 2123 assists us in reading HRS § 481B-14 and
 Chapter 388 in pari materia. 
Starwood argues that the title of H.B. 2123 “is but a 
remnant of the original bill” and not “evidence that [HRS § 481B­14] may be enforced through Chapter 388.” Schwab makes clear, 
however, that the title of a bill cannot be considered just a “remnant” of the legislative process; as bills evolve, the title must continue to embrace the subject of the bill, or the bill is 
nugatory under the Hawai‘ i Constitution. Therefore, the 
legislature could not have validly deleted H.B. 2123’s original 
contents without the replacement content continuing to bear some relation to the title. 
Starwood also quotes Poe v. Haw. Labor Rels. Bd., 97 Hawai‘ i 
528, 540, 40 P.3d 930, 942 (2002) for the proposition  that “the 
title, policy declarations, and purpose sections of a statute are 
‘not substantive law,’ [and] cannot ‘limit or expand the express terms of the operative statutory provisions.’” This quotation is 
23
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
not found in Poe. Rather, Poe held, “[P]olicy declarations in 
statutes, while useful in gleaning the purpose of the statute, are not, of themselves a substantive part of the law which can limit or expand upon the operative terms of the operative 
statutory provisions.” 97 Hawai‘ i at 540, 40 P.3d at 942. Poe 
did not discuss titles of bills, and is therefore not applicable 
on that point. 
The Marriott and Starwood Defendants also argue that Davis
 
already held that the title of H.B. 2123 is “not dispositive.”
 
Davis made that point only as to whether the title of H.B. 2123
 was dispositive on the issue of employee standing under Chapter
 480. The full quote states: “[A]lthough we believe the title is 
instructive in that it appears to reflect the legislature’s concern that employees may not always be receiving the service charges imposed by their employers, we do not believe it is dispositive of the issue of whether the legislature intended to afford Employees standing to sue for HRS § 481B-14 violations.” 
122 Hawai‘ i at 433 n.17, 228 P.3d at 313 n.17. Moreover, this 
quotation supports the Plaintiffs’ point that the subject matter 
of HRS § 481B-14 is wages and tips of employees, in that this court has already considered the title of H.B. 2123 “to reflect the legislature’s concern that employees may not always be 
24
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
receiving the service charges imposed by their employers.” Id.
 
(emphasis added). 
Lastly, both the Marriott and Starwood Defendants argue
 
that, under State v. Mata, 71 Haw. 319, 782 P.2d 1122 (1990), HRS
 
§ 481B-14 and Chapter 388 cannot be read in pari materia. Mata,
 
however, is distinguishable. In that case, a defendant argued
 that the definition of “under the influence” found in the chapter
 regulating the sale of liquor and liquor establishments should be
 imported into the statutory offense of driving under the
 influence of alcohol under HRS § 291-4. 71 Haw. at 330, 789 P.2d
 at 1128. We disagreed, holding, “HRS Chapter 281 regulates the
 sale of liquor and liquor establishments. HRS Chapter 291
 regulates traffic violations. The chapters serve different
 purposes and are not in pari materia.” Id. In the instant
 
proceedings, however, HRS § 481B-14 and Chapter 388 are in pari
 materia, because both deal with the same subject matter: “tip
 income” and “wages and tips of employees” in HRS § 481B-14 and
 “Payment of Wages and Other Compensation” in Chapter 388.
 
Because HRS § 481B-14 can be read in pari materia with
 
Chapter 388, there exists a relationship among these statutory
 provisions supporting Plaintiffs’ contention that HRS § 481B-14
 violations can be enforced through Chapter 388.
 
25
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
D. Exclusivity of Remedies
 
In spite of the plain language, legislative history, and in 
pari materia reading, the Marriott and Starwood Defendants insist 
that the exclusive remedy for a violation of HRS § 481B-14 lies within the consumer protection chapters (HRS Chapters 480 and 481B). They cite Davis for the following proposition: “[T]he legislative history of H.B. 2123 indicates that the legislature was concerned that when a hotel or restaurant withholds a service charge without disclosing to consumers that it is doing so, both employees and consumers can be negatively impacted. The 
legislature chose to address that concern by requiring disclosure and by authorizing enforcement of that requirement under HRS 
chapter 480.” 122 Hawai‘ i at 434, 228 P.3d at 314 (emphasis 
added). However, Davis left unanswered the question of whether 
violations of HRS § 481B-14 are also enforceable through Chapter 
388. See 122 Hawai‘ i at 428 n.12, 228 P.3d at 308 n.12. 
(“Employees also contend that Employees can enforce HRS § 481B-14 
through HRS §§ 388-6, 10, and 11. However, this argument will not be addressed because it is beyond the scope of the certified question.”) 
The plain language of Chapters 480 and 481B does not
 
indicate that remedies therein are exclusive. The legislature
 knows how to craft an exclusivity provision. See, e.g., HRS §
 
26
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
103D-704 (2012)(“Exclusivity of remedies. The procedures and 
remedies provided for in this part, and the rules adopted by the 
policy board, shall be the exclusive means available for persons aggrieved in connection with the solicitation or award of a contract, a suspension or debarment proceeding, or in connection with a contract controversy, to resolve their claims or differences. . . .”). No such exclusivity provision appears in the relevant enforcement statutes in the consumer protection area. HRS § 481B-4 (2008) provides, “Remedies. Any person who violates this chapter shall be deemed to have engaged in an unfair method of competition and unfair or deceptive act or practice in the conduct of any trade or commerce within the meaning of section 480-2.” HRS § 480-2(e) (2008), in turn, allows “[a]ny person [to] bring an action based on unfair methods of competition declared unlawful by this section.” Contrary to the Marriott and Starwood Defendants and Four Seasons amicus’ argument, nothing in these statutes states that Chapter 480 remedies are exclusive. 
The Marriott and Starwood Defendants also argue that the
 
legislature’s decision to shift H.B. 2123’s focus from a bill
 proposing amendments to Chapters 387 and 388 to a bill proposing
 to add a new section within Chapter 481B indicates the
 legislature’s intent that the remedy under the consumer
 
27
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
protection chapters be exclusive. However, nothing in the
 
legislative history of H.B. 2123 limits or even discusses
 remedies. Further, the Marriott and Starwood Defendants have
 provided no case law or other authority holding that the mere
 placement of a law within one chapter of the HRS implies the
 exclusion of remedies found in other chapters. 
On the other hand, the Gurrobat amici have cited Zator v.
 
State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 69 Haw. 594, 597, 752 P.2d 1073,
 1075 (1988) for the proposition that this court “cannot presume
 that the legislature intended a discriminatory and illogical
 policy” that a statute located in one chapter of the HRS should
 not apply to a statute located in another chapter of the HRS. 
In that case, on a question certified to us by the United States
 Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, we applied the tolling
 provision from the chapter on statutes of limitations (Chapter
 657) to the no-fault limitations period set forth in the chapter
 governing motor vehicle accident reparations (then Chapter 294). 
69 Haw. at 595, 597, 752 P.2d at 1074, 1075. This was because
 HRS § 294-36 was “silent as to whether it is tolled if the person
 entitled to bring the suit is rendered insane on account of the
 accident,” but the “general tolling provisions for statutes of
 limitations set forth in HRS § 657-13 provides for tolling of the
 
28
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
statute in cases of insanity.” 69 Hawai‘ i at 597, 752 P.2d at 
1075. 
We considered there to be an ambiguity in the law, which we
 
resolved by construing the two statutes in pari materia,
 
ascertaining legislative intent, and looking to the policies
 
behind the statutes. Id. We concluded that the legislature
 
could not have intended “a discriminatory and illogical policy”
 
of allowing the tolling of the general statute of limitations for
 insane plaintiffs but disallowing the tolling of the no-fault
 statute of limitations. Id. We also favorably cited another
 
case, Hun v. Center Properties, 63 Haw. 273, 626 P.2d 182 (1982),
 in which we held that HRS § 657-13 tolled the wrongful death
 statute of limitations found in another chapter (Chapter 663)
 because “the two-year statute of limitations period merely
 affects the remedy and not the right of action.” Similarly in
 this case, allowing enforcement under Chapter 388 affects the
 remedy, not the right set forth in HRS § 481B-14. 
It bears noting that the Plaintiffs argue that HRS § 480­
13(d) (2008) provides that the remedies in Chapter 480 are
 “cumulative.” That statutory sub-section reads in whole,
 however, “The remedies provided in this section are cumulative
 and may be brought in one action.” (Emphasis added). “This
 section” refers to HRS § 480-13(d), not statutes outside of that
 
29
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
section, and is of no help to Plaintiffs. Further, the
 
Plaintiffs have cited E. Star Inc., S.A. v. Union Bldg. Materials
 Corp., 6 Haw. App. 125, 142, 712 P.2d 1148, 1159 (1985) to
 support their argument that Chapter 480 remedies are cumulative,
 but that case held only that Chapter 480 remedies “do not
 supersede common law fraud claims based on deception in the
 course of trade and commerce,” which are remedies very different
 from those under Chapter 388. Although Chapter 480’s remedies
 are not expressly “cumulative,” and although case law has yet to
 establish that they include Chapter 388 remedies, the bottom line
 is that Chapter 480 remedies are not “exclusive” either;
 therefore, nothing in the statutory plain language or legislative
 history of HRS § 481B-14 precludes enforcement of HRS § 481B-14
 violations through Chapter 388. 
V. Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, we answer the certified question
 
in the affirmative. When a hotel or restaurant applying a
 
service charge for the sale of food or beverage services
 allegedly violates HRS § 481B-14 by (1) not distributing the full
 service charge directly to its employees as “tip income” (in
 other words, as “wages and tips of employees”), and by (2)
 failing to disclose this practice to the purchaser of the
 services, the employees may bring an action under HRS §§ 388-6, 
30
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI' I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
-10, and -11 to enforce the employees’ rights and seek remedies.
