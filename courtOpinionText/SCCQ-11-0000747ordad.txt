ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER ON CERTIFIED QUESTION
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the October 11, 2011 order of the 
United States District Court for the District of Hawai
'i 
requesting the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i to answer 
certified questions identified as questions #1, #2 and #3, it 
appears that question #1 -- and only that question -- is amenable to answer by this court pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 13 inasmuch as the October 11, 2011 order certifies, as to question #1, but not as to questions #2 and #3, 
that the question concerns the law of Hawai' i that is 
determinative of the plaintiffs’ cause and that there is no clear controlling precedent in the Hawai' i judicial decisions. See 
HRAP Rule 13. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, without conclusively determining
 
whether this court will answer question #1, that:
 
1. Pursuant to HRAP Rule 28(e), plaintiffs Bert Villon
 
and Mark Apana and plaintiffs Reneldo Rodriguez and Johnson
 Basler are designated appellants for purposes of this proceeding
 and shall collectively pay the required filing fee for an
 original proceeding in this court.
 
2. Defendant Marriott Hotel Services, Inc. and
 
defendant Starwood Hotels & Resorts, Inc. are designated
 appellees for this proceeding.
 
3. Pursuant to HRAP Rule 13(c), the plaintiffs-
appellants shall make all necessary arrangements with the clerk of the United States District Court for the District of Hawai' i 
to transmit the original or certified copies of the pending federal court cases to this court. It shall be the responsibility of the plaintiffs-appellants to ensure that the record is received in this court within thirty days from the date of this order. 
4. After the record is filed in the supreme court,
 
plaintiffs-appellants Villon and Apana and plaintiffs-appellants
 Rodriguez and Basler shall each file an opening brief within the
 
2
 time provided by HRAP Rule 28(b). The opening briefs shall
 
conform to the format and content requirements of HRAP Rule 28,
 insofar as applicable. A statement of jurisdiction pursuant to
 HRAP Rule 12.1 is not necessary.
 
5. Thereafter, defendant-appellee Marriott shall file
 
an answering brief to plaintiffs-appellants Villon and Apana’s
 opening brief. Defendant-appellee Starwood shall file an
 answering brief to plaintiffs-appellants Rodriguez and Basler’s
 opening brief. The answering briefs shall be filed within the
 time provided by HRAP Rule 28(c) and shall conform to the format
 and content requirements of HRAP Rule 28, insofar as applicable.
 
6. The plaintiffs-appellants may file reply briefs in
 
accordance with HRAP Rule 28(d).
