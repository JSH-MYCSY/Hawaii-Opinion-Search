Defendant.

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the plaintiffs' motion for
 
reconsideration of the November 8, 2011 ruling on the certified
 
question, it appears that the motion for reconsideration -- filed
 on November 21, 2011 -- was not filed within 10 days after the
 filing of the November 8, 2011 ruling. See
 HRAP 40(a) ("A motion
 
for reconsideration may be filed by a party only within 10 days
 after the filing of the opinion, dispositional order, or ruling
 unless by special leave additional time is granted during such
 
period by a judge or justice of the appellate court involved."). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for
 
reconsideration is denied as untimely.
