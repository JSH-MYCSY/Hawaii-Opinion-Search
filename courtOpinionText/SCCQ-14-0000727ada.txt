 May an excess liability insurer bring a cause of action, 
under the doctrine of equitable subrogation to the rights 
of the insured, against a primary liability insurer for 
failure to settle a claim against the mutual insured within 
the limits of the primary liability policy, when the 
primary insurer has paid its policy limit toward 
settlement?  
 
We modify the certified question slightly  to hold that an excess 
liability insurer can bring  a cause of action, under the 
doctrine of equitable subrogation, against a primary liability 
insurer who in bad faith  fails to settle a claim within the 
limits of the primary liability policy, when the primary insurer 
has paid its policy limit toward settlement.2

 Insurance Company (Liberty Mutual) , the primary insurer, issued 
insurance policies to Pleasant Travel Service, Inc. dba Royal 
Kona Resort and Hawaiian Hotels and Resort (Pleasant Travel).  
Pleasant Travel was insured from January 1, 2010 through January 
1, 2011 by both St. Paul and Liberty Mutual.  A primary insurer 
provides insurance against liability risk from $0 up to the 
limits of the policy.  An excess insurer provides insurance 
beyond the limits of the primary insurance policy.  In this 
case, the  primary insurance policy covered up to $1 million. 
  In July 2010, Pleasant Travel was sued in the Circuit 
Court of the Third Circuit for the State of Hawai ‘i for damages 
resulting from an accidental death.3  As the primary insurer, 
Liberty Mutual appointed counsel to represent Pleasant Travel. 
As the excess insurer, St. Paul alleges that Liberty Mutual 
rejected multiple pretrial settlement offers within the $1 
million limit of its primary liability  policy.   
  The  subsequent  trial resulted in a finding of 
liability against Pleasant Travel and a verdict of $4.1 million.  
In 2012, after the verdict, the action was settled for a 
                         
 3  Pleasant Travel was named as a defendant in the case entitled  
Estate of Karen Celaya, et al. v. Pleasant Travel Service dba Royal Kona 
Resort and Hawaiian Hotels and Resorts, et al., Case No. 10 -01-265K. ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____

 confidential amount in excess of the Liberty Mutual p olicy 
limit.  St. Paul claims that it paid the amount in excess.   
  On June 10, 2013, St. Paul filed a Complaint against 
Liberty Mutual in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit for the 
State of Hawai ‘i (circuit court) .  St. Paul, the excess insurer, 
alleged that Liberty Mutual, the primary insurer, acted in bad 
faith by rejecting multiple settlement offers within the limit 
of its primary liability  policy.  On July 22, 2013, Liberty 
Mutual filed a Notice of Removal from the circuit court to the 
district court.   
  The certified question arose following the filing of 
Liberty Mutual’s  Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings on 
November 20, 2013, in which Liberty Mutual argued that St. Paul 
lacked standing to assert a claim for insurer bad faith and that 
St. Paul had no claim against Liberty Mutual for equitable 
subrogation.  On February 5, 2014, a hearing on the Motion for 
Judgment on the Pleadings was held.  The district court ordered 
the parties to meet and confer to frame a question for 
submission to this court.  Because the parties were unable to 
agree upon the question for submission, the  district  court 
drafted the certified question.

 II. Standard of Review 
  This c ourt has “ jurisdiction and powers . . . [t]o 
answer, in its discretion . . . any question or proposition of 
law certified to it by a federal district or appellate court if 
the supreme court shall so provide by rule[.]”  Hawai‘i Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 602–5(a)(2) (Supp. 2010). 
When a federal district or appellate court certifies to the 
Hawai‘i Supreme Court that there is involved in any 
proceeding before it a question concerning the law of 
Hawai‘i that is determinative of the cause and that there is 
no clear controlling precedent in the Hawai ‘i judicial 
decisions, the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court may answer the 
certified question by written opinion.   
 
Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 13(a) (2010).  
  A question of law presented by a certified question is 
reviewable de novo under the right/wrong standard of review.

III.  Discussion  
  We hold that St. Paul can bring a cause of action  as 
an excess insurer  against Liberty Mutual,  a primary insurer , 
under the doctrine of equitable subrogation.  Hawai‘i state 
courts broadly apply  the doctr ine of equitable subrogation and 
thus, allowing the excess insurer a cause of action here ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____

 comports with our prior jurisprudence.  Further, this broad 
application is in line with the majority o f jurisdictions , which 
have recognized equitable subrogation claims under similar 
circumstances.  Finally, permitting an excess insurer to 
subrogate to the rights of the insured , and assert a claim 
against a primary insurer  for a bad faith failure to settle a 
claim within the limits of the primary liability policy , 
protects the public interest in ensuring equity in insurance 
matters and encouraging settlement .   
A. Hawai‘i Case Law Supports a Broad Application of the 
Doctrine of Equitable Subrogation  
 
  Hawai ‘i has recognized the doctrine of equitable 
subrogation as an appropriate remedy when equity demands.  
Through subrogation, the subrogee “is put in all respects in the  
place of the party to whose rights he is subrogated.”  Peters v. 
Weatherwax, 69 Haw. 21, 27, 731 P.2d 157, 161 (1987) (quoting 
Kapena v. Kaleleonalani, 6 Haw. 579, 583 (Haw. Kingdom 1885)) 
(internal quotation mark omitted).  Subrogation is a “creature 
of equity jurisprudence, ” and is “so administered as to secure 
real and essential justice without regard to form[. ]”  Id. 
(alteration in original)  (citation omitted) (internal quotation 
marks omitted).   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
 
7 
 
   Equitable subrogation has a broad scope4 and we have 
defined the doctrine as “ broad enough to include every instance  
in which one party pays a debt for which another is primarily  
answerable, and which, in equity and good conscience,  should 
have been discharged  by the latter[.]”   Id. (alteration in 
original) (citation omitted) (internal quotation mark omitted) .  
In considering this broad application, the district court has 
previously explained that  “[s]ubrogation is proper between a 
primary and excess insurer.”  Reliance Ins. Co. v. Doctors Co. , 
299 F. Supp. 2d 1131, 1151 (D. Haw. 2003) , aff’d sub nom.  
Reliance Ins. Co. v. Doctors’  Co., 132 F. App’ x 730 (9th Cir. 
2005). 
  Notwithstanding the broad scope of equitable 
subrogation, Liberty Mutual  asserts that St. Paul’s claim should 
be dismissed because “St. Paul has not paid a debt or satisfied 
some liability for which another party  . . . is primarily 
responsible.”  Liberty Mutual explains  that it defended Pleasant 
                         
 4 Courts apply the doctrine of equitable subrogation in a “broad 
and expansive” manner to take account of the need for “j ustice and equity 
[in] particular situations.”  Seabright Ins. Co. v. Matson Terminals, Inc. , 
828 F. Supp. 2d 1177, 1194  (D. Haw. 2011)  (quoting Han v. United States , 944 
F.2d 526, 529 (9th Cir.  1991)).  In Seabright, for example, the district 
court permitted an insurer to seek recovery of attorneys’ fees from the 
defendant under the doctrine of equitable subrogation despite a lack of 
relevant case law because “[c]ommon sense dictates here that, to find 
otherwise, would result in grave inequity.”  Id. at 11 93.   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____

 Travel against the accidental death  claim and paid its liability 
up to the primary policy  limit.  According to Liberty Mutual, 
St. Paul did not pay for Liberty Mutual’s liability but “merely 
discharged its own contractual obligations” to Pleasant Travel.   
  While it is true that  St. Paul discharged its 
obligations to Pleasant Travel, Liberty Mutual, as the primary 
insurer, also had a n obligation to Pleasant Travel  to pursue 
settlement.  An insurer owes a duty of good faith and fair 
dealing to its insured.  See Best Place Inc. v. Penn Am. Ins. 
Co., 82 Hawai ‘i 120, 132, 920 P.2d 334, 346 (1996).5  A breach of 
this duty includes an insurer’s unreasonable refusal to settle a 
                         
 5  We have previously relied on contract law to establish an 
insurer’s duty of good faith and fair dealing to its insured.  See Best Place  
Inc., 82 Hawai‘ i at 123, 920 P.2d at 337  (explaining that the duty of good 
faith and fair dealing was “implied  in contracts”).  This court also declined  
to extend the duty of good faith and fair dealing to claimants not part of 
the subject insurance  contract.  Simmons  v. Puu, 105 Hawai‘i 112, 127, 94 
P.3d 667, 682 (2004).  Liberty Mutual argues that it owe s no duty of good 
faith and fair dealing to St. Paul because this duty is based on the 
contractual relationship between the insurer and insured.  St. Paul does not 
argue that Liberty Mutual owes it a direct duty, however, but rather seeks to 
apply the doctrine of equitable subrogation.  Through  equitable subrogation, 
St. Paul “ steps into the shoes” of Pleasant Travel to enforce Liberty 
Mutual’s duty to Pleasant Travel to act in good faith.  See State Farm Fire & 
Cas. Co. v. Pac. Rent -All, Inc., 90 Hawai ‘i 315, 329, 331, 978 P.2d 753, 767, 
769 (1999).  
 
  To apply the doctrine of equitable subrogation, St. Paul does not 
need a contract with Liberty Mutual.  The doctrine of equitable subrogation  
is a principle of equity that “arises out of a relationship that need not be 
contractually based.”  Id. at 328-29, 978 P.2d at 766 -67 (comparing equitable 
subrogation to conventional subrogation that arises out of a contract between 
parties).  As we have previously ex plained, equitable subrogation should be 
administered “to secure real and essential justice without regard to form, 
and is independent of any contractual relations  between the parties to be 
affected by it.”  Kapena, 6 Haw. at 583 (emphasis added) (citation omitted) . ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____

 claim on behalf of the insured.  Id. at 124, 920 P.2d at 338 .  
We have explained that “[e]ven if the ultimate judgment was in 
excess of the policy limits, the insurer may still be liable for 
the entire amount if its refusal to settle was unreasonable.”  
Delmonte v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. , 90 Hawai‘i 39, 52 n.9, 
975 P.2d 1159, 1172 n.9 (1999)  (citing Crisci v. Security Ins. 
Co., 426 P.2d 173 (Cal. 1967) (in bank) ).  Applying the doctrine 
of equitable subrogation  in this context  permits an excess 
insurer to hold a primary insurer to its obligation to the 
insured. 
  Upholding  Liberty Mutual’s  characterization of St. 
Paul’s actions , in contrast,  would permit primary insurers to 
chance litigation and choose to “‘gambl[e]’  with the excess 
carrier’s money when potential judgments appr oach the primary 
insurer’s policy limits ,” rather than settle .  Hartford Accident 
& Indem. Co. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. , 792 P.2d 749, 753 (Ariz. 
1990) (in banc) (quoting Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Med. 
Protective Co. , 393 N.W.2d 479, 483 (Mich. 1986)).   For example, 
suppose that in the instant case, the underlying plaintiff’s 
claim was for $3 million in damages, but the plaintiff agreed to 
settle for $1 million.  Liberty Mutual, however, determines that 
at trial, the plaintiff’s chance of prevailing is 50% .  In such ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
 
10 
 
 a situation, Liberty Mutual wou ld have no incentive to settle.  
If the plaintiff prevailed at trial, winning an amount in excess 
of $1 million, Liberty Mutual would be in the same position as 
if it settled, given that St. Paul would cover the excess 
amount.  However, if the plaintiff lost at trial, Liberty Mutual 
would be in a better position than if it settled , saving itself 
from payment of  $1 million .  Such a hypothetical demonstrates 
how allowing St. Paul’s claims to go forward can function to 
mitigate the “potential that a primary insurer will forgo fair 
and reasonable settlements and roll the dice with, what is in 
essence,  the excess insurer’s money.”   Nat’l Sur. Corp. v. 
Hartford Cas . Ins. Co. , 493 F.3d 752, 758 (6th Cir. 2007).6     
  Liberty Mutual  also argues that St. Paul cannot 
subrogate to the rights of Pleasant Travel because Pleasant 
Travel “never faced the prospect of direct liability for the 
amount of the [] verdict in excess of [Liberty Mutual’s] 
liability limit because that amount was within St . Paul’s 
                         
 6  The Sixth Circuit and Seventh Circuit provided similar 
hypotheticals in holding that an excess insurer could step into the shoes of 
the insured and sue a primary insurer under the doctrine of equitable 
subrogation.  See  Nat’l Sur. Corp., 493 F.3d at 757; Twin City Fire Ins. Co. 
v. Country Mut. Ins. Co., 23 F.3d 1175, 1179 (7th Cir. 1994).  The Sixth 
Circuit recognized that in evaluating such a hypothetical, the costs of 
litigation to the insurer must also be considered, but noted that “[a]lthough 
the presence of litigation costs diminishes the incentive an insurer has to 
go to trial, the underlying problem still remains.”  Nat’l Sur. Corp., 493 
F.3d at 758.   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____

 liability limit.”  Equitable subrogation may, however, be 
applied even “without any showing that the insured ha [s] 
suffered any loss.”  Seabright Ins. Co. v. Matson Terminals, 
Inc., 828 F. Supp. 2d 1177, 1194 (D. Haw. 2011) (quoting Nw. 
Mut. Ins. Co. v. Farmers’ Ins. Grp. , 143 Cal. Rptr. 415, 423 
(Cal. Ct. App. 1978)).  In Seabright , the district court 
explained that “[i]t is not a prerequisite to equitable 
subrogation that the subrogor suffered actual loss; it is 
required only that he would have s uffered loss had the subrogee 
not discharged the liability or paid the loss .”  Id. at 1193 
(emphasis added) (quoting Nw. Mut. Ins. Co. , 143 Cal. Rptr. at 
423).  In other words, because an insured can recover from a 
primary insurer that refused reasonable s ettlement offers, “the 
excess carrier, who discharged the insured’s liability as a 
result of this tort, stands in the shoes of the insured and 
should be permitted to assert all claims against the primary 
carrier which the insured himself could have asserte d.”  
Commercial Union Ins. Co. , 393 N.W.2d at 482 ( quoting Commercial 
Union Assurance Cos. v. Safeway Stores, Inc. , 610 P.2d 1038, 
1041 (Cal. 1980) ) (internal quotation mark omitted) .  St. Paul 
can thus bring a cause of action under the doctrine of equitable 
subrogation against Liberty Mutual if Pleasant Travel could ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
 
12 
 
 assert such a claim, even when Pleasant Travel suffers no actual 
loss.  This court’s line of cases advocating for a bro ad and 
equity-based application of subrogation supports such a finding.   
B. The Majority of Jurisdic tions Permit an Excess Insurer 
To File a Claim Against a Primary Insurer  Under the 
Doctrine of Equitable Subrogation  
 
  Hawaii’s broad application of the doctrine of 
equitable subrogation comports wit h the majority of 
jurisdictions, which have held that, under the state law 
applicable in those cases, an excess insurer can seek relief 
from a primary insurer under the doctrine.7  For example, t he 
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit allowed an 
excess insurer to bring a claim against a primary insurer under 
the doctrine of equitable subrogation for the primary insurer’s 
bad faith refusal to settle.  Valentine v.  Aetna Ins. Co., 564 
                         
 7 See, e.g. , Nat’l Sur. Corp ., 493 F.3d at 756 (concluding that “an 
excess insurer is permitted to step into the shoes of the insured and sue a 
primary insurer pursuant to the doctrine of equitable subrogation  to enforce 
the primary insurer’ s duty to avoid excessive judgments against an insured”); 
Certain Underwriters of Lloyd’s  v. Gen. Accident Ins. Co. , 909 F.2d 228, 233 
(7th Cir. 1990) (holding that “Indiana would allow an excess carrier to sue a 
primary carrier on the basis of equitable subrogation”); U.S. Fire Ins. Co. 
v. Royal Ins. Co. , 759 F.2d 306, 309  (3d Cir. 1985) (holding that “an excess 
insurer who has discharged an insured’s liability stands in the shoes of the 
insured and as subrogee may maintain an action for breach of the  primary 
carrier’s duty to act in good faith”); Commercial Union Assurance  Cos., 610 
P.2d at 1041 (explaining that “[i]t has been held in California and other 
jurisdictions that  the excess carrier may maintain an action against the 
primary carrier for [] [wrongful] refusal to settle within the latter’s 
policy limits” (alterations in original) ); Truck Ins. Exch. v. Century Indem.  
Co., 887 P.2d 455, 458 (Wash. Ct. App. 1995) (recognizing that “[a]n excess 
insurer is subrogated to the rights of its insured to recover on claims the 
insured has against the primary insurer”).  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
 
13 
 
 F.2d 292, 297 (9th Cir. 1977).  The court explained: “When there 
is no excess insurer, the insured becomes his own excess 
insurer, and his [] primary insurer owes him a duty of good 
faith in protecting him from an excess judgment and p ersonal 
liability.”   Id. (quoting Cont’l Cas. Co. v. Reserve Ins. Co. , 
238 N.W.2d 862, 864 (Minn. 1976) ).  If the insured purchases  
excess insurance , “he in effect substitutes  an excess insurer 
for himself.”   Id. (quoting Cont’l Cas. Co., 238 N.W.2d at 864).  
The Supreme Court of Michigan further explained that when an 
insured does not have excess insurance, the insured has “every 
incentive to enforce the primary insurer’ s contractual duty to 
defend or to attempt to settle within policy limits in good 
faith.”  Commercial Union Ins. Co. , 393 N.W.2d at 482.  But, if 
the insured does carry  excess coverage, “that incentive 
dissolves” and  “[t]he excess carrier, and not the insured, bears 
the injury res ulting from the primary insurer’ s breach , and is 
therefore the party with the greatest incentive  to enforce the 
primary insurer’ s duties .”  Id. 
  In a case similar to the one before this court, the 
Supreme Court of Arizona held that an excess insurer could 
assert a claim against a primary insurer,  under the doctrine of 
equitable subrogation, for a bad faith failure to settl e within ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
 
14 
 
 primary policy limits.   Hartford Accident & Indem. Co. v. Aetna 
Cas. & Sur. Co. , 792 P.2d 749, 757  (Ariz. 1990).8  The court 
noted that “[a] number of jurisdictions have expanded the duty 
of good faith by recognizing a duty to an excess [insurer] by 
the primary [insurer]”9 and adopted the doctrine of equitable 
subrogation.  Id. at 752-53.  The court explained that these  
jurisdictions adopted the doctrine of equitable subrogation in 
part because subrogation serves “to encourage fair and 
reasonable settlements of lawsuits.”  Id. at 753.  Based on this 
public policy analysis, t he court determined that “[a]n excess 
insurer should not have  to pay a judgment if the primary insurer 
caused the excess judgment by a bad faith failure to settle 
within primary limits” and held that the excess insurer could 
bring such a claim against the primary insurer.  Id. at 754. 
  The Supreme Court of Oregon also held that an excess 
insurer can bring a claim against the primary insurer under the 
                         
 8 Specificall y, the question  before the court was: “May an excess 
insurance carrier, under the doctrine of equitable subrogation, assert a 
claim against a primary insurance carrier for bad faith failure to settle 
within primary policy limits?”  Hartford Accident & Indem. Co. , 792 P.2d at 
751.   
 9 In Arizona, as in Hawai ‘i, a primary insurer owes its insured “a 
duty of good faith in deciding whether to accept or reject settlement 
offers.”  Hartford Accident & Indem. Co. , 792 P.2d at 752.  Through the 
doctrine of equitable subrogation, the duty of good faith has been expanded 
to allow an excess insurer to “step[] into the shoes” of the insured and 
assert a claim against the primary insurer .  Id. at 753.   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____

 doctrine of equitable subrogation.  In the case at issue , 
evidence suggested that the primary insurer “made little or no 
effort to attempt to  negotiate a settlement” and as a result, 
the excess insurer claimed that its “share of the settlement 
[was] higher than it otherwise would have been .”  Maine Bonding 
& Cas. Co. v. Centennial Ins. Co. , 693 P.2d 1296, 1298, 1302-03 
(Or. 1985).  The court explained that “[a] primary insurer owes 
an excess insurer essentially the same duty of due diligence in 
claims handling and settlement ne gotiating it owes to an 
insured— due care under all the circumstances. ”  Id. at 1302.  
The court further noted that a  primary insurer is responsible 
for considering the interests of all parties involved in a 
claim, including those of the  excess insurer.  Id.  
  The majority of c ourts faced with the issue before us 
have permitted excess insurers to bring a claim of bad fa ith 
against a primary insurer  under the doctrine of equitable 
subrogation.   As discussed further below, t he doctrine enables 
an excess insurer to seek relief from a primary insurer who can 
otherwise take advantage of a situation that leaves the excess 
insurer with no other remedy.

 C. Application of the Doctrine of Equitable Subrogation 
Protects  the Public Interest  
 
  T he doctrine of equitable subrogation is an equitable 
remedy that protects an insurer from paying a debt that should 
be discharged by another.  The Hawai ‘i Insurance Code, Chapter 
431 explains that “[t] he business of insurance is one affected 
by the public interest, requiring that all persons be actuated 
by good faith, abstain from deception and practice honesty and 
equity in all insurance matters. ”  HRS § 431:1 -102 (2005) 
(emphases added).  Allowing  excess insurers  to subrogate  to the 
rights of the insured  upholds the Hawai‘i Insurance Code by 
enabling excess insurers  to litigate bad faith claims against 
the primary  insurer and to seek equitable  relief.   
  In addition, subrogation promotes  the duty of insurers 
“to accept reasonable settlements.”  Best Place Inc., 82 Hawai‘i 
at 128, 920 P.2d at  342 (quoting Gruenberg v. Aetna Ins. Co., 
510 P.2d 1032, 1037 (Cal. 1973) (in bank))  (internal quotation 
mark omitted).  Settlement is a goal of proper process.  Young 
v. Allstate Ins. Co., 119 Hawai‘i 403, 414, 198 P.3d 666, 677 
(2008).  Subrogation enables an excess insurer to hold a primary 
insurer to its duty to pursue reasonable settlements and not to 
gamble on litigation.  Hartford Accident & Indem. Co., 792 P.2d 
at 753; see also W. Am. Ins. Co. v. RLI Ins. Co., 698 F.3d 1069, ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____

 1076 (8th Cir. 2012) (“ When the primary insurer has control of 
defending underlying claims, permitting subrogation claims by 
the excess insurer increases the likelihood of fair and 
efficient settlement of lawsuits  . . . .”); Nat’l Sur. Corp. , 
493 F.3d at 757 (“Absent a rule permitting excess insurers to 
recover against primary insurers, primary insurers could, in bad 
faith, fail to accept settleme nt offers at or near policy limits 
with impunity.”);  Valentine , 564 F.2d at 297 ( stating that 
subrogation allows enforcement of the primary insurer’s duty to 
settle, a breach of which would “imperil[] the public and 
judicial interests in  fair and reasonable settlement of 
lawsuits” (quoting Cont’l Cas. Co. , 238 N.W.2d at 864 -65)).   
  Liberty Mutual argues that subrogation is not 
necessary because St. Paul could have funded a settlement, and 
thereafter sought reimbursement  from Liberty Mutual.  If an 
excess insurer was  left with the  solution urged by Liberty 
Mutual, however, then “the excess insurer risks losing the 
policy-limit contributions of the primary insurer and being 
forced to pay the entire settlement itself, even though the 
settlement may have been in the overall best interests of the 
insured.”  Valentine , 564 F.2d at 297 ( quoting Cont’l Cas. Co. , 
238 N.W.2d at 865 ).  In addition, “[a]n excess carrier owes no ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____

 duty to the insured nor to the primary carrier either to defend 
the insured or to enter into settlement negotiations .”  Certain 
Underwriters of Lloyd’s v. Gen. Accident Ins. Co. , 699 F. Supp. 
732, 740 (S.D. Ind. 1988) , aff’d, 999 F.2d 228 (7th Cir. 1990) ; 
see also Cont’l Cas. Co. v. U.S. Fid. & Guaranty Co. , 516 F. 
Supp. 384, 39 2 (N.D. Cal. 1981)  (stating that where a primary 
insurer is “in control of the litigation . . . it would [be] 
improper for the . . . excess carrier to step in and try to 
settle it”) .  To force an excess insurer to settle would thus 
provide a “disincentive” for the primary insurer to seek 
settlement.  Valentine , 564 F.2d at 298.10  In sum, the public 
interest in encouraging reasonable settlement is best served by 
permitting an excess insurer to seek relief under the doctrine 
of equitable subroga tion. 
IV. Conclusion  
  For the foregoing reasons, we hold that an excess 
liability insurer can bring a cause of action, under the 
doctrine of equitable subrogation, against a primary liability 
                         
 10 The Ninth Circuit also explains that forcing an excess insurer to 
cover part of a primary liability insurance policy would “[distort] the 
coverages and rate structures of the two different types of insurance —primary 
and excess . . . .”  Valentine, 564 F.2d at 298 .  This would further violate 
the policy set forth in the Hawai ‘i Insurance Code to “promote the public 
welfare by regulating insurance rates to the end that they shall not be 
excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory . . . .”  HRS § 431:14 -101 
(2005).      ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____
