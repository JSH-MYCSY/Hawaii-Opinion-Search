OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.  
 
I. Introduction        
 
 
  
  
 
                     
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
prosecute or defend against claims that the Plaintiff doctors 
steered these patients away from treatment at Defendant Queens 
Medical Center. The patients are not parties to the underlying 
lawsuit, although 19 of them have been granted intervenor 
status. All of them have intervened solely to assert their 
right to privacy and seek a prohibition on the use and 
production of their medical records. 
The District Court1 certified the following questions to 
this court: 
1. May a third party who is in lawful possession of a 
patient’s confidential medical records use, or be compelled 
to produce, these records in litigation where the patient 
is not a party?  
2. If a third party may use and/or produce a patient’s 
confidential medical records in litigation, is a de -
identification process sufficient to protect the patient’s 
privacy interests where the third party already allowed its 
agents access to the patient’s records and its agents 
inadvertently made part of the patient’s medical 
information public?  
This court may “reformulate the relevant state law questions as 
it perceives them to be, in light of the contentions of the 
parties.” Allstate Ins. Co. v. Alamo Rent-A-Car, Inc.,  137 F.3d 
634, 637 (9th Cir. 1998) (citations and quotation marks 
omitted). To avoid confusion, we reformulate the certified 
questions to clarify that the term “party” refers to the parties 
to the litigation, not to the parties to the physician-patient 
relationship. We believe that the “parties” in this case are 
the plaintiffs and defendants, and the “third parties” in this

case are the patient intervenors. We also reformulate the 
question so that a negative answer to the first certified 
question will not preclude us from answering the second 
certified question to the extent we can. Therefore, the 
reformulated certified questions are:  
1. May a party who is in lawful possession of a patient’s 
confidential medical records use, or be compelled to 
produce, these records in litigation where the 
patient is 
not a party?  
2. Is a de -identification process sufficient to protect 
the patient’s privacy interests where the party already 
allowed its agents access to the patient’s records and its 
agents inadvertently made part of the patient’s medical 
information public?2  
  
 Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure (“HRAP”) Rule 13 (2000) 
governs certified questions. It provides, in relevant part, 
“When a federal district . . . court certifies to the Hawai i 
Supreme Court that there is involved in any proceeding before it 
a question concerning the law of Hawai i that is determinative of 
the cause and that there is no clear controlling precedent in 
the Hawai i judicial decisions, the Hawai i Supreme Court may 
answer the certified question by written opinion.” W e therefore 
confine our answer to the “law of Hawai i that is determinative 
3
 2   Defendant urges us to reformulate the certified questions to include 
the following “threshold question”: “Does [Hawai i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 
431:10C- ]308.7(c) apply to all self -referral involving insured services 
covered by H.R.S. Chapter 431 or only to those involving no -fault auto -
related services?” We decline to do so. We note that the District Court has 
already concluded that that statute does not apply to health care provider referrals and is “limited to the context of motor vehicle insurance” in an 
Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary 
Judgment on the Counterclaim. The present certified question is not the 
proper vehicle through which Defendant may challenge that order.         
 
 
  
  
   
 As to the second  certified question, we do not address 
whether sufficient de-identification is possible where one  party 
already allowed its agents access to the patient’s records and 
its agents inadvertently made part of the patient’s medical 
information public. The de-identification process and 
requirements are set forth under the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), Pub L. No. 
104-191, 110 Stat. 1936 (1996), and its corresponding regulations; therefore, the sufficiency of de-identification 
does not “concern[]  the law of Hawai i that is determinative of 
the cause.”   HRAP Rule 13. Whether the use and production of *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
of the cause,” namely article I, section 6 of the Hawai i 
Constitution. That constitutional provision states, in relevant 
part, “The right of the people to privacy is recognized a nd 
shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state 
interest.”  
We answer the first certified question in the negative. 
Article I, section 6 of the Hawai i Constitution protects the 
health information of patient intervenors to this case. Pursuant to that provision, and under the facts of this case, 
the parties cannot use, or be compelled to produce, confidential 
patient medical records in litigation where the patient is not a 
party, absent a compelling state interest
.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
de-identified medical records is “sufficient to protect the 
patient’s privacy interests,” however, is a question this court 
can address under article I, section 6. We hold that the use 
and production of de-identified medical information of patients 
who are not parties to the litigation violates those patients’ 
right to privacy under article I, section 6 of the Hawai i 
constitution, as no compelling state interest has been shown in 
this case.    
II. Background 
The Plaintiffs in this case are Pacific Radi
ation Oncology, 
LLC; PRO Associates, LLC; John Lederer, M.D.; Vincent Brown, 
M.D.; Paul DeMare, M.D.; Thanh Huynh, M.D.; Laeton Pang, M.D.; and Eva Bieniek, M.D. (collectively, “PRO”). The Plaintiffs 
filed an Amended Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Damages (“Amended Complaint”) against Defendants Queens 
Medical Center and Queens Development Corporation (collectively 
“QMC”).
3 The Amended Complaint alleged that the Plaintiffs “had 
a long-standing, 40-year relationship with QMC to provide professional radiation oncology therapy services to PRO patients at facilities owned by QMC, using equipment, technician support, 
and other services provided by QMC.” QMC is the only Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission-approved hospital at which radiation 
The Plaintiffs also named as defendants the individual members of the 
Queens Medical Center Board of Trustees.  The parties later stipulated to 
dismiss, without prejudice, these individuals.

    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
oncologists can operate on patients. Plaintiffs also 
acknowledged that they had “a one -third interest in The Cancer 
Centers of Hawai i [‘TCCH’],” a competitor of QMC. 
According to the Amended Complaint, QMC notified Plaintiffs 
that the QMC Board had d ecided to convert QMC to a “closed 
radiation therapy department,” meaning that only physicians 
employed by QMC could exercise clinical privileges to provide 
professional radiation oncology services at QMC. QMC explained 
that it arrived at its decision to terminate PRO’s privileges 
after determining that PRO had “transferr[ed] patients to other facilities for no medical reason or patient request. . . .” 
Plaintiffs alleged in their Amended Complaint that QMC’s action was intended to destroy their ability to treat patients at 
facilities competing with QMC. 
Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint raised ten claims for relief: 
a claim of denial of procedural and substantive due process; a 
claim of violation of QMC bylaws and governing regulations; 
three separate claims of intentional and tortious interference; 
four separate claims of unfair, deceptive, anti-competitive and illegal trade practices in violation of HRS Chapter 480; and a 
claim of breach of fiduciary duty and bad faith owed to a 
partner. 
QMC filed an Answer and Counterclaim. Relevant to this 
certified question, QMC counterclaimed that Plaintiffs Lederer, 
6
        
 
 
   During the course of the litigation, QMC’s law firm 
publicly filed a list naming 132 pat  ients PRO was alleged to 
have diverted to TCCH; also included were the patients’ QMC 
identification numbers and the PRO doctors who consulted and 
treated each patient.   The list was attached as an exhibit to 
(1) a subpoena to TCCH’s custodian of records an d (2) a 
discovery request to PRO.   The filing was subsequently sealed.  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Brown, DeMare, Huynh, and Pang “consulted with and/or began 
treatment of patients referred to them at QMC and then induced 
the patients to receive treatment at TCCH without making timely 
written disclosure of their ownership interests in TCCH,” which 
constituted unfair competition in violation of HRS § 480-2.   
Plaintiffs then moved for a temporary restraining order or 
preliminary injunction to prevent further violations of patient 
privacy. 
In their moving papers, they alleged that QMC had 
accessed the electronic medical records of 133 cancer patients, without consent, to determine if Plaintiffs were directing patients to TCCH, and, if so, how much revenue QMC lost as a 
result. Plaintiffs argued that cancer patient medical records 
would likely include “history and physicals” information 
regarding “the most confidential and sensitive inquiries, 
including prior pregnancies, abortions, sexual activities, 
potency, drug use, psychological issues, depression, AIDS info, 
family history, prior diseases, substance dependency, etc., 
7
        
 
 
  The District Court granted in part, and denied in part, the 
Plaintiffs’ motion. 
Construing the Plaintiffs’ pleading as a 
discovery motion, the District Court granted it, in part, and 
sanctioned defense counsel for publicly filing the list naming 
the 132 cancer patients, in willful  violation of the parties’ 
Amended Stipulated Protective Order.   The District Court denied 
the motion for a TRO and/or preliminary injunction, in part, 
because the Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint alleged no claims of 
4 improper review and use of confidential patient information.   As 
to whether the Plaintiffs could prevent Defendants from 
obtaining or using confidential patient information, the District Court concluded that “the parties must address these 
issues through the normal discovery process.”  
 
                     
4   The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the 
denial. Pacific Radiation Oncology, LLC v. Queen ’s Medical Center,  810 F.3d 
631 (9th Cir. 2015).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
etc.”   QMC’s alleged breach of patient privacy culminated in the 
disclosure of 132 of the patients’ names in the exhibits to the subpoena and discovery request.   Plaintiffs sought to enjoin 
“QMC, its attorneys, and its con sultants from reviewing and more 
importantly from publishing the highly confidential information 
including the names of these many, many cancer patients.”  
The Magistrate Judge, in turn, issued his Order Regarding 
Discovery Issues. H
e found the 132 cancer patients’ 
confidential medical records to be relevant to the parties’ 
8        
 
 
  Article I, section 6 of the Hawai i Constitution is entitled 
“Right to Privacy,” and it provides, “The right of the people to 
privacy is recognized and shall not be infringed without the 
showing of a compelling state interest. The legislature shall 
take affirmative steps to implement this right.” In the context of patient medical records, this court has issued three 
decisions construing article I, section 6 on petitions for writ 
of mandamus: 
Brende v. Hara , 113 Hawai i 424, 153 P.3d 1109 
(2007) (per curiam); Naipo v. Border, 125 Hawai i 31, 251 P.3d 
594 (2011) (per curiam); and Cohan v. Ayabe , 132 Hawai i 408, 322 
P.3d 948 (2014). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
claims and counterclaims.   He ordered the records discoverable 
as follows: 
Although the patient medical records contain protected 
health information (“PHI”), this does not preclude their 
discovery. As noted by Judge Kobayashi in the TRO Order, 
“[o]nce health information has been deidentified, it is no 
longer protected by HIPAA” or state law. TRO Order at 29. 
It reasonably follows that PHI is discoverable if de -
identified. Accordingly, the 132 patient medical records shall be de -identified.  Upon de- identification, the 
medical records will be discoverable and shall be produced.  
 
The Plaintiffs appealed the Magistrate Judge’s decision to the 
District Court. After granting 19 affected patients’ motion to 
intervene, the District Court reserved ruling on the Plaintiffs’ 
appeal and certified the instant questions to this court.  
III. Discussion 
9

        
 
 
  
  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Each of the mandamus petitioners in these cases sought to 
compel the respondent judges to issue orders limiting and/or 
prohibiting the use of patient medical records. The mandamus 
petitioners in Brende and Cohan were both plaintiffs in tort 
litigation in which their medical condition and treatment were at issue. The petitioner in Naipo, on the other hand, was not a 
party to the litigation. Rather, in Naipo, the parties to a 
dog-bite lawsuit sought discovery of a non-party’s patient medical records. This distinction is key in the instant 
proceedings, which involve patient intervenors who are not 
parties to the lawsuit between Plaintiffs and QMC. Each of 
these cases will be discussed in turn, below. 
Brende, Cohan, and Naipo all provide strong privacy 
protection over patient medical records. In Brende, this court 
held, “Petitioners’ health information is ‘highly personal and intimate’ information that is protected by the informational 
prong of article I, section 6. The constitutional provision protects the disclosure outside of the underlying litigation of 
petitioners’ health information produced in discovery.” 113 
Hawaii at 430, 153 P.3d at 1115 (footnote omitted). This 
holding was reaffirmed in Cohan. See 132 Hawai i at 410, 322 
P.3d at 950 (“[T]he privacy provision of the Hawai i 
Constitution, article I, section 6, protects [the petitioner’s] 
10
        
 
 
  
   
  
 
  
 
 
 
 So inviolable is this right that the framers sought to 
shield individuals from “possible abuses in the use of highly 
personal and intimate information in the hands of government or 
private parties. . . .” Comm. Whole R ep. No. 15, in *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
health information against disclosure outside the underlying 
litigation.”) 
The holding in Brende and Cohan applies to situations in 
which a party to litigation seeks to limit and/or prohibit the 
disclosure, outside of discovery, of his or her own patient 
medical records. While that is not the situation in the present 
case (where non-parties seek to prohibit the use and disclosure 
of their patient medical records), we turn to Brende and Cohan 
for their exploration of the constitutional history behind 
article I, section 6. 
Brende noted that the framers viewed the Hawai i 
constitutional right to privacy as follows:  
[T]he [article I, section 6] right of privacy encompasses 
the common law right of privacy or tort privacy. This is a 
recognition that the dissemination of private and personal 
matters, be it true, embarrassing or not, can cause mental 
pain and distress far greater than bodily injury.  For  
example, the right can be used to protect an individual from invasion of [the individual’s] private affairs, public disclosure of embarrassing facts, and publicity placing the 
individual in a false light.  In short, this right of 
privacy includes the right of an individual to tell the world to “mind your own business.”  
 
113 Hawai i at 430, 153 P.3d at 1115 (quoting Stand. Comm. Rep. 
No. 69, in Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of 
Hawaii of 1978 (“Proceedings”), Vol. 1, at 674). 
11
        
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Proceedings, at 1024 (emphasis added). In this way, article I, 
section 6 provides Hawaii’s people with powerful protection 
against any  infringement of their right to privacy, by state and  
private actors. In fact, we have previously noted that the 
framers “equated privacy in the informational sense” with the 
“common law right of privacy,” so that “[o]ne who gives 
publicity to a matter concerning the private life of another is 
subject to liability to the other for invasion of his [or her] 
privacy, if the matter publicized is of a kind that (a) would be 
regarded as highly offensive to a reasonable person, and (b) is 
not of legitimate concern to the public.” State of Hawai i 
Organization of Police Officers (“SHOPO”) v. Soc’y of Prof’l 
Journalists, 83 Hawai i 378, 398, 927 P.2d 386, 406 (1996) 
(citing Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 69, Proceedings, at 674; and  
Restatement (Second) of Torts § 652D, 383 (1977)). There is no 
requirement that the one invading another individual’s privacy 
be a state actor. See, e.g., SHOPO, 83 Hawai i 378, 927 P.2d 386 
(analyzing whether a non-state actor’s, e.g., an organization of 
journalists, access to police officer disciplinary records would 
violate the officers’ constitutional privacy rights).  
Article I, section 6 g
enerally provides greater privacy to 
Hawaii’s people than its federal analogs. The Hawai i 
constitutional right to privacy is a “fundamental right for 
12
        
 
 
  Article 1, section 6 also provides more stringent 
5 6  protection  over patient medical records than does HIPAA.  This 
conclusion was implicit in Cohan, where a provision in a 
Stipulated Qualified Protection Order that provided that the 
                     
   
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
purposes of constitutional analysis.” Cohan, 132 Hawai i at 415, 
322 P.3d at 955 (quoting Comm. Whole Rep. No. 15, in 
Proceedings, at 1024). We view article I, section 6 as “afford[ing] much greater privacy rights than the federal right 
to privacy. . . .” Janra Enters., Inc. v. City & Cty. of 
Honolulu, 107 Hawai i 314, 320, 113 P.3d 190, 196 (2005) 
(citation omitted).  
5 45 C.F.R. § 160.202(6) provides 
More stringent means, in the context of a comparison of a 
provision of State law and a  standard, requirement, or 
implementation specification adopted under subpart E of 
part 164 of this subchapter, a State law that meets one or 
more of the following criteria:  . . . .  
With respect to any other matter, provides greater privacy 
protection for the individual who is the subject of the 
individually identifiable health information.  
That regulation also defines “state law” to include a state’s constitution 
and common law. Id.  
6 We therefore are not persuaded by QMC’s contention that “Hawaii’s 
constitutional right of privacy is coextensive with HIPAA.”  In support of 
this argument, QMC points to HRS Chapter 323B, Hawaii’s Health Care Privacy 
Harmonization Act, specifically section 3(a) in that chapter, which states in 
relevant part that a covered en tity or business associate’s use or disclosure 
of individually identifiable health information that complies with HIPAA “shall be deemed to comply with all state laws relating to the use, 
disclosure, or confidentiality of such information.”   HRS § 323B- 4(6) (2010 & 
Supp. 2012), however, provides, “Nothing in this chapter shall be construed 
to . . . [l]imit or otherwise affect any evidentiary privilege, limitation on 
discovery, or confidentiality protection provided by any state law, decision, 
or order in relation to individually identifiable health information sought, 
used, or produced in any judicial or administrative proceeding.” Therefore, 
the intervenors’ constitutional right to privacy in their confidential 
medical records is unaffected by Chapter 323B.  In other words, honoring an 
individual’s right to privacy in his or her protected health information 
requires more than bare compliance with HIPAA. 
13
        
 
 
  The right to privacy is absolute where, as here, the 
individuals seeking to protect patient medical records, in 
discovery and beyond, are not parties to the litigation, have 
not consented to the use of their  patient medical records in 
relation to the present lawsuit, and no compelling state interest has been shown.  
Naipo  is a case “on all fours” with 
the instant case. In Naipo, plaintiff Eshell Mitchell sued the 
Yuen family in state court for multiple leg injuries she 
sustained when the Yuens’ dog, Braddah, bit her. 125 Hawai i at 
33, 251 P.3d at 596. As part of her negligence claim, Mitchell 
sought to establish that Braddah had previously bitten Jennifer 
Naipo. See id.    Mitchell issued a subpoena duces tecum to 
Wahiawa General Hospital for production of Naipo’s medical records. See id.    The respondent judge denied Naipo’s motion to 
quash the subpoena and ordered the hospital to turn over Naipo’s 
medical records for an in camera inspection. 125 Hawai i at 34, 
251 P.3d at 597. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
defendant hotel could use a tort plaintiff’s health information 
in its internal reviews was invalidated under article I, section 
6, yet we noted that “[a]n analysis under HIPAA arguably may 
lead to a different result.” 132 Hawai i at 419, 419 n.18, 322  
P.3d at 959, 959 n.18.  
14

        
 
 
  Naipo then petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus, 
arguing that her health information was protected by, inter 
alia, her right to privacy under article I, section 6 of the 
Hawaii constitution. Id.   We granted Naipo’s petit ion for 
mandamus relief and ultimately directed the respondent judge to quash the subpoena duces tecum. 125 Hawai i at 37, 251 P.3d at 
600. We unequivocally held, “Petitioner Jennifer Naipo is not a 
party to Eshell Mitchell’s lawsuit against the Yuens. Her 
health information in her medical records at Wahiawa General 
7   Hospital is protected by her constitutional right to privacy.”
125 Hawai i at 35, 251 P.3d at 598.  
 Naipo’s holding provides our answer to the first certified 
question, which is, “May a par ty who is in lawful possession of 
a patient’s confidential medical records use, or be compelled to 
produce, these records in litigation where the patient is not a 
party?”   We hold that, pursuant to article I, section 6 of the 
Hawaii Constitution,  and under the facts of this case, the 
parties cannot use, or be compelled to produce, confidential 
patient medical records in litigation where the patient is not a 
party, where no compelling state interest has been shown.   
                     
7   Our decision also rested on the twin holding that Naipo’s confidential 
medical records “deserve[d] t he protection of the physician -patient privilege 
of [Hawai i Rules of Evidence] Rule 504,” which Naipo had not waived. 125 
Hawaii at 35, 36, 251 P.3d at 598, 599. We therefore are not persuaded by 
QMC’s argument that Naipo  “held  that the medical records  were protected from 
disclosure to the trial judge on physician patient privilege grounds rather 
than privacy.”   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
15
        
 
 
  The second certified question is, “ Is a de-identification  
process sufficient to protect the patient’s privacy interests 
where the party already allowed its agents access to the 
patient’s records and its agents inadvertently made part of the 
patient’s medical information public? ”   We doubt, under the 
circumstances of this case where there has been an egregious breach of patient confidentiality by QMC both internally and 
publicly, that de-identification  is possible.  However, the 
question of the sufficiency of de-identification where one  party 
already allowed its agents access to the patient’s records and 
its agents inadvertently made part of the patient’s medical 
information public, is ultimately a matter of compliance with 
HIPAA, which is a federal question we need not answer.  We can 
address under Hawai i law, however, that part of the second 
certified question asking if de-identification could 
sufficiently protect the patients’ privacy rights. We answer 
that part of the second certified question in the negative.  
 In Cohan, we held, “To allow [a party’s medical] 
information to be used outside the litigation, regardless of whether it is de-identified or not, would reach beyond what the 
Hawaii Constitution permits in the absence of a showing of a 
compelling state interest.” 13 2 Hawai i at 419, 322 P.3d at 959.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
16

        
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In Cohan, we noted that the de-identification process under 
HIPAA is “extremely complex and problematic,” and that, “[a]part 
from these technical considerations, there is the very 
complicated issue as to whether a patient has a legitimate basis 
for being concerned about what happens to their personal health 
information once it is de-identified.” 132 Hawai i at 417, 418, 
322 P.3d at 957, 958 (footnote omitted). We quoted the 
following observation from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals 
with approval: “Even if there were no possibility that a 
patient’s identity might be learned from a redacted medical 
record, there would still be an invasion of privacy.” Cohan, 
132 Hawai i at 418, 322 P.3d at 958 (citing Nw. Mem’l Hosp . v.  
Ashcroft, 362 F.3d 923,  929 (7th Cir. 2004) ). Such an invasion 
could produce undesirable effects upon patient health care, 
including “social and psychological harm through embarrassment, 
economic harm through job discrimination and job loss, patient 
difficulty in obtaining health insurance, health care fraud, and 
patient reluctance to share sensitive information with their 
doctors or pharmacists.” 132 Hawai i at 418, 322 P.3d at 958

  Further, we observed that “the risk of re -identification 
remains, as there is ‘no national, uniform standard governing 
the level of identifier-stripping necessary to guarantee that 
de-identified data cannot be re-identified.” 132 Hawai i at 418 
n.16, 322 P.3d at 958 n.16 (quoting Smith, supra, at 935).  The 
risk of re-identification poses “subjective privacy concerns” 
for some patients, who object to the “dehumanization [in] having 
one’s most intimate information circulated by an indifferent and 
faceless infrastructure without any control over the process or 
content.” Id.  (quoting Will Thomas DeVries, Protecting Privacy 
in the Digital Age, 18 Berkeley Tech. L.J., 283, 298 (2003)).  
 We believe the same concerns underlying the use of de-
identified medical records beyond litigation for parties to a 
lawsuit exist for individuals who are not parties to litigation 
and who have therefore not put their medical condition and/or 
treatment at issue in the first instance. Just as article I, 
section 6 protects parties from the use and production of their 
de-identified information outside of litigation, we conclude 
that article I, section 6 protects individuals from the use and production of their de-identified information in litigation to 
which they are not parties. Thus, the use and production of 
even sufficiently de-identified medical records, under the 
circumstances of this case, will not adequately protect the 
patients from an invasion of their privacy.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 By contrast, our express holding in Cohan  was, “To allow [a 
party’s medical] information to be used outside the litigation, 
regardless of whether it is de-identified or not, would reach 
beyond what the Hawai i Constitution permits in the absence of a 
showing of a compelling state interest.” 132 Hawai i at 419, 322 
P.3d at 959. Extending Cohan  to cases in which parties seek to 
use and produce the medical records of non-parties, we hold that 
to allow an individual’s medical information, even if de -*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
We acknowledge that Cohan  also stated  the following:  
Once health information has been de -identified, it is no 
longer protected by HIPAA. Further, because HIPAA allows 
“more stringent” state law to preempt federal law only  when 
it relates to the privacy of “individually identifiable health information,” 45 C .F.R. § 160.203(b), this leads to 
the conclusion that state law also does not protect de -
identified information.   Nw. Mem’l Hosp.
 
132 Hawai i at 417, 322 P.3d at 957  (latter emphasis added).  We 
consider the last statement to be an accurate summary of the   
holding in Nw. Mem’l Hosp. , which was, more specifically, that 
Illinois’ medical-records privilege, while providing “more 
stringent” state law protection of “individually identifiable 
health information,” was no barrier to the discovery of de-
identified health information. See also   Zyprexa Prods. Liab. 
Litig., 254 F.R.D. 50, 52 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (similarly concluding, “the States’ [physician -patient] privilege laws pose no obstacle 
to the discovery of [patient] medical records, provided those records are de-identified.”).  , 362 F.3d at 926 .

identified, to be used in litigation to which that individual is 
not a party, would reach beyond what the Hawai i Constitution 
permits in the absence of a showing of a compelling state 
interest. In this case, QMC has made no such showing, and we do 
not believe that a compelling state interest exists in 
infringing upon the Hawai i state constitutional privacy rights 
of over 100 cancer patients in order to resolve what is 
essentially a contract dispute between competing cancer 
treatment providers.  
IV. Conclusion 
We answer both certified questions in the negative. 
Article I, section 6 of the Hawai i Constitution protects the 
health information of patient intervenors to this case. 
Pursuant to that provision, t
he parties cannot use, or be 
compelled to produce, confidential patient medical records, even 
if sufficiently de-identified, in litigation where the patient is not a party, as no compelling state interest has been shown.
