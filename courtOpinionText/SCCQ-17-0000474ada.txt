 In a federal court lawsuit, a grantor asserts  that an 
escrow company’s alleged deletion  of an easement from the Electronically Filed

 property description attached to 
a deed he executed renders the 
deed a “forged deed ” that is void ab initio.  The escrow company 
and the grantee, on the other hand, assert  that the grantor’s 
claim sounds in fraud and is subject to, and barred by, a 
statute of limitations.  They assert that the statute of 
limitations has run because the grantor is deemed to have ha d 
constructive notice of the allegedly modified deed upon its 
recordation.   
 The United States District Court for the District of Hawai ʻi 
(“district court”) certified the following questions to this 
court: 
1.  Whether a claim relating to a forged deed is subject to 
the statute of limitations for fraud?   
 
2.  Whether the recording of a deed provides constructive 
notice in an action for fraud?  
  
 As it is unclear whether, under Hawai ʻi law, the underlying 
case involves a claim relating to a deed that is void ab initio 
or a claim that is subject to a statute of limitations, we 
reframe1 the questions as follows: 
1.   Under Hawai ʻi law, when is a deed void ab initio for 
 fraud, such that a claim challenging the validity of 
 the deed is not subject to a statute of limitations?   
 
2.
   Under 
Hawaiʻi law, what statute of limitations 
 applies to a claim that a deed was procured by fraud 
 of the type that does not render it  void ab initio?  
                     
1  This court may “reformulate the relevant state law questions as it 
perceives them to be, in light of the contentions of the parties.”  Allstate

3.   Under Hawai ʻi law, when does the statute of 
 limitations begin to run on a grantor’s claim that a 
 deed was procured by fraud of the type that does not  
 render it void ab initio:  upon recordation of the 
 deed or at some other point in time?2 
 
 
To answer the first modified certified question, we hold 
that, under Hawai ʻi law, a deed is void ab initio for fraud,  
such that a claim challenging the validity of the deed is not 
subject to a statute of limitations, when (1) a deed is forged, 
meaning it has been falsely made, completed, endorsed, or 
altered with intent to defraud; or (2) a deed has been procured 
by “fraud in the factum,” such as when a person is fraudulently 
deceived about the nature of a document that has been signed, as 
when a document is surreptitiously substituted for signature.3  
Gonsalves v. Ikei, 47 Haw. 145, 384 P.2d 300 (1963); Adair v. 
Hustace, 64 Haw. 314, 640 P.2d 294 (1982) (abrogated on other 
grounds by Ass’n of Apartment Owners of Royal Aloha v. Certified 
Mgmt., 139 Hawaiʻi 229, 386 P.3d 866 (2016)).4  
                     
2  As the property at issue was not Land Court property, we also do not 
address the effect of Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes § 501 -106.   
 
3  Under Hawaiʻ i law, a party alleging fraud must prove fraud by “clear and 
convincing evidence.”  See, e.g., Iddings v. Mee -Lee, 82 Hawaiʻ i 1, 14, 919 
P.2d 263, 276 (1996) (“[T]he clear and convincing standard is typically used 
in civil cases involving allegations of fraud or some other quasi -criminal 
wrongdoing by the defendant.”) (citation omitted).  
 
4  We note that the courts are split as to whether a void deed can be 
ratified.  According to 26A C.J.S. Deeds § 68, “most courts hold that an 
instrument that is void by reason of defective execution may be ratified by 
the grantor, subject, however, to certain limitations as to the manner of 
ratification, as, for example, by a reacknowledgement, or the execution or a 
confirmation deed, or by a will, or by an authorization under seal to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
4 
  To answer the second modified certified question, we hold 
that, under Hawaiʻ i law, the six- year “catch -all” statute of 
limitations under Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 657 -1(4) 
(2016) applies to a claim that a deed was procured by fraud of 
the type that does not render it void ab initio, e.g., fraud in 
the inducement and constructive fraud. 
 To answer the third modified certified question, we hold 
that the statute of limitations begins to run on a grantor’s 
claim that a deed was procured by fraud of the type that does 
not render it void ab initio when the grantor discovers, or 
reasonably should have discovered, 
the existence of the claim  
or the identity of the person who is liable for the claim. 
                                                                  
(continued. . .)  
complete and deliver the instrument, where such as is performed.”  (footnotes 
omitted).  Another possible manner of ratifying an unauthorized modification 
of the deed is the acceptance of benefits under the deed with full knowledge 
of the unauthorized act.  See, e.g., Brock v. Yale Mortg. Corp., 287 Ga. 849, 
855 (2010) (explaining that a person whose name is forged on a deed may later 
ratify the unauthorized act where the person, with full knowledge of all the 
material facts, accepts the benefits of the unauthorized act; a person 
seeking to cancel a forged deed in equity must tender to the grantee any 
consideration received under the forged deed); Erler v. Creative Finance, 203 
P.3d 744 (Mont. 2009) (collecting cases from Florida, Georgia, and the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit permitting ratification of 
void deeds and holding that “ratification of a forged deed may properly be 
considered in equity”).  In this case, we need not and do not address 
whether, under Hawaiʻ i law, a void deed could be ratified.    
 26A C.J.S. Deeds § 68 goes on to state, however, “Some courts have held 
that a void deed, such as one that has been forged, cannot be ratified.”  
See, e.g., Beazley v. Turgeon, 772 S.W.2d 53 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1988) (affirming 
trial court’s decision voiding a deed procured by forgery and a falsified 
notary acknowledgement and holding there could be no ratification of the void 
deed because the grantor had not agreed to the exact terms set forth in the 
transaction involving the forged deed); Bellaire Kirkpatrick Joint Venture v. 
Loots, 826 S.W.2d 205, 210 (Tex. App. 1992) (“Because a forged deed is void 
ab initio, it is not subject to being revived by mere ratification.”).  
Again, we need not and do not address this issue.

 II.  Factual Background
 
A.  District Court Proceedings 
 This case involves a 2002 sale of real property from 
William R. Hancock (“Hancock”) to Kulana Partners, LLC (“KPL”).  
Hancock had allegedly agreed to include in the conveyance 
documents an easement in favor of his neighbors, Robert and 
Esther Grinpas (the “Grinpases”).  The recorded conveyance 
documents, however, did not include the easement.   
 In 2007, the Grinpases sued Hancock and KPL in the Circuit 
Court of the Fifth Circuit (“circuit court”).  The circuit court 
rendered judgment in favor of the Grinpases and against Hancock, 
and the appeal has been before the ICA twice.  Grinpas v. Kapaa 
382, CAAP-14-0000870.    
 In 2013, in the United States District Court for the 
District of Hawai ʻi (“
district court”), Hancock, individually and 
as trustee of the Hancock and Company, Inc. Profit Sharing 
Trust, sued KPL and the escrow company for the sale, Fidelity 
National Title & Escrow of Hawaiʻi, Inc. (“Fidelity”).   He 
alleged that, after he executed the deed, Fidelity fraudulently 
modified it to delete the Grinpases’ easement, then recorded the 
deed.   
 Hancock elaborated that, in August 2002, he reviewed two 
deeds at Fidelity’s Kapa ʻa office:
  a warranty deed conveying the 
property from Hancock, individually, to Hancock as trustee, and *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
6 
 a trustee’s deed conveying the property from Hancock as trustee 
to KPL (“Trustee Deed”).   Hancock alleged that he “identified a 
limitation in the ‘Subject To’ section of the Trustee Deed in 
Paragraph 12 that made the co nveyance subject to ‘Any rights of 
the parties in possession of a portion of, or all of, said land, 
which rights are not disclosed by the public record.’”   He 
alleged, “But for the existence of this in the ‘Subject To’ 
section,” he “would not have executed  the deed.”   Hancock went 
on to allege that Paragraph 16 of the Trustee Deed described an 
easement in the north corner of the property “at or near the 
location of the Grinpas Easement.”   Hancock further alleged that 
days later, the two deeds were transmitted from Fidelity to its 
attorney.    
 
About a week later, on August 26, 2002, an internal 
memorandum between Fidelity’s “Loretta” and “Jeannette” advised, 
“WE NEED TO REPLACE THE SUBJECT TO PAGE ON BOTH OF THE DEEDS . . 
. THE TOGETHER WITH PARAGRAPH (ON THE TOP) IS MISSING.  I 
BELIEVE THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE THE DEED AND I HAVE IT SET UP FOR 
RECORDING ON WEDNESDAY.”   To Hancock, this internal memorandum 
reflected Fidelity’s “fraudulent[]” “intent to alter [Hancock’s] 
executed and notarized Deeds” to “remove t he easement at 
paragraph 16 and paragraph 12 regarding unrecorded interests” 
“without the knowledge or consent of Mr. Hancock.”   According to 
Hancock, the altered trustee’s deed was recorded in the Bureau *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
7 
 of Conveyances5 on August 28, 2002.  Hancock alleged that 
“Fidelity is a fiduciary with a duty to disclose its own 
malfeasance.”  He also asserted that, as a result of “fraudulent 
concealment by Fidelity and KPL,” he “did not learn of the 
forged deed until 2013.”   Relevant to the certified questions 
before this court,  Count I of Hancock’s Complaint sought a 
declaration that the Trustee Deed was void as “an altered 
instrument and . . . a forgery,” and to have the order declaring 
the deed void recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances.      
 KPL then filed 
a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure (“FRCP”) 12(b)(1) and (6), and Fidelity 
filed its own motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to 
FRCP Rule 12(c).  Both KPL and Fidelity characterized Hancock’s 
Complaint as an end- run around the state court judgment against 
Hancock in the Grinpas case.  Both argued that the allegedly 
modified deed was publicly recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances 
in 2002; therefore, Hancock had constructive notice of any 
fraudulent conduct at that time.6  Both KPL and Fidelity further 
argued that the applicable statute of limitations was the six-
                     
5  According to Hancock, the deed was recorded only in the Bureau of 
Conveyances and not in Land Court.    
 
6 Fidelity also pointed out that Hancock had already testified in the 
Grinpas case that the omission of the easement in the deed was “a mistake.”  
In a later deposition (taken in 2013), Hancock testified that he realized in 
2007 that there was no express mention of the e asement in the Trustee’s Deed.  
Therefore, Fidelity argued, Hancock had actual knowledge of the facts giving 
rise to his claim for relief in 2007, if not earlier, or was at least on 
inquiry notice.     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
8 
 year statute of limitations found in HRS § 657
-1, which began to 
run in 2002 upon recordation of the deed; therefore, Hancock’s 
federal complaint, filed over eleven years after the statute of 
limitations had begun to run, was time- barred.    
 In his opposition to KPL’s and Fidelity’s motions, Hancock 
appended as exhibits the 2002 Trustee’s Deed that Hancock said 
he signed, which included paragraphs 12 and 16, as well as the 
2002 Trustee’s Deed that was actually recorded in the Bureau of 
Conveyances, which is missing paragraphs 12 and 16.  He also  
appended as an exhibit the internal memorandum between two 
Fidelity employees referencing a missing provision in the deed.    
 In both of Hancock’s memoranda in opposition, he made the 
same points.  First, as to the statute of limitations, Hancock 
argued that there is no statute of limitations on a claim that a 
forged deed is void.  Hancock quoted the following passage from 
Palau v. Helemano Land Co., 22 Haw. 357, 361 (Haw. Terr. 1914), 
to support his position:  “The complainant being out of 
possession is in position to, at any time, bring an action of 
ejectment and therein litigate the title to the land, including 
the question of the alleged forgery.  A forged deed is void and 
passes no title.”    
 Second, as to the argument that the recordation of the 
Trustee’s Deed provided Hancock with constructive notice of any 
fraud therein, Hancock counter- argued that “a forged instr ument *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
9 
 and its record are utterly void, and its record is not 
constructive notice,” citing to Mosley v. Magnolia Petroleum 
Co., 114 P.2d 740 (N.M. 1941).     
 Hancock also asked the district court to look to the Hawai ʻi 
Penal Code’s definitions of “[f]alsely alter,” “[f]orged 
instrument,” and “utter” to determine whether forgery occurred 
in this case.    
 KPL and Fidelity separately filed reply memoranda in 
support of each’s motions.   Both asserted that Hancock 
misconstrued the Palau decision.  Fidelity asserted that Palau  
was “decided long before the rise of modern pleading standards” 
(i.e., the merger of law and equity) and “dealt with the central 
question of whether a plaintiff challenging the validity of two 
deeds was required to proceed on an action at law or an action 
in equity.”  Fidelity argued that the Palau  court then held that 
the plaintiff did not have to bring an action in equity first in 
order to bring an action in law when it stated that the 
plaintiff “is in a position to, at any time, bring an action of 
ejectment,” which was an action at law.   Fidelity contended that 
“at any time” in Palau referred “not to a statute of limitations 
(or lack thereof), but rather the availability of a particular 
form of action.”  KPL interpreted Palau similarly.    
 Further, KPL argued that “ Palau demonstrates that claims of 
forged deeds sound in fraud,” as the complainant in that case *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
10 
 “requested that the deeds in question be declared ‘fraudulent 
and void.’”
  Therefore, KPL reiterated that the six- year statute 
of limitations for fraud (HRS § 657-1(4)) applied.    
 
KPL and Fidelity also argued that Hancock had constructive 
notice of any alleged fraud upon the recordation of the 
Trustee’s Deed with the Bureau of Conveyances in 2002.  KPL 
noted that there is no Hawai ʻi case holding that a recorded 
document serves as constructive notice regarding actions 
predicated on fraudulent conduct when the public record itself 
constitutes evidence of the fraud; instead, KPL referred the 
court again to cases from other jurisdictions for this point of 
law.  KPL and Fidelity did, however, distinguish Mosley, the 
sole case Hancock relied upon, as addressing “constructive 
notice for subsequent purchasers for value,” not constructive 
notice for purposes of determining whether the statute of 
limitations had begun to run.    
 The district court granted KPL’s motion to dismiss and 
Fidelity’s motion for judgment on the pleadings .  The district 
court first stated that Hancock’s claims “unmistakably sound in 
fraud”; therefore, HRS § 657 -1(4)’s si x-year statute of 
limitations applied.  The district court footnoted its agreement 
with KPL and Fidelity’s interpretation of the Palau decision, 
noting that the case “addressed the availability of an action in 
equity or at law, and did not speak to whether a limitations *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
11 
 period is applicable” to forged deed claims.   The district court 
also rejected Hancock’s argument that Hawai ʻi Penal Code 
definitions of forgery applied in this case.    
 
The district court then acknowledged that there were no 
Hawaiʻi cases add
ressing whether the recording of a deed serves 
as constructive notice for purposes of a fraud claim.  It went 
on, however, to note that Hawaiʻi appellate courts have 
“recognized that the recording of a document gives notice to the 
general public of the conveyance,” citing Markham v. Markham, 80 
Hawaiʻi 274, 281, 909 P.2d 602, 609 (App. 1996) (holding that the 
“central purpose of recording a conveyance of real property is 
to give notice to the general public of the conveyance and to 
preserve the recorded instrument as evidence”).   The district 
court therefore charged Hancock with constructive notice of the 
contents of the Trustee’s Deed upon the date it was recorded, 
August 28, 2002, and held that Hancock’s 2013 Complaint’s fraud 
claims were time-barred by the six -year statute of limitations.  
The district court also rejected Hancock’s assertion that he did 
not discover the fraudulent modification of the deed until 2013 
due to KPL and Fidelity’s fraudulent concealment.     
 
Judgment was entered in favor of KPL and Fidelity.  Hancock 
appealed the judgment to the Ninth Circuit.    
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
12 
 B.  Ninth Circuit Proceedings
 
 The Ninth Circuit issued a memorandum opinion stating that 
“a clarification of Hawaii law would resolve this case.”   The 
Ninth Circuit then vacated the district court’s judgment and 
remanded the case to the district court with instructions to 
certify two questions to this court.  The district court issued 
an order so doing, and this court agreed that the questions were 
amenable to answer.    
III.  Certified Questions 
 This court may “answer, in its discretion . . . any 
question or proposition of law certified to it by a federal 
district or appellate court if the supreme court shall so 
provide by rule.”  HRS § 602 -5 (2016).  Hawai ʻi Rul
es of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 13(a) (2000), on certified questions, 
provides the following: 
When a federal district or appellate court certifies to the 
Hawaiʻi Supreme Court that there is involved in any 
proceeding before it a question concerning the law of 
Hawaiʻi that is determinative of the case and that there is 
no clear controlling precedent in the Hawai ʻi judicial 
decisions, the Hawai ʻi Supreme Court may answer the 
certified question by written opinion.  
 
 
A question of law presented by a certified question is 
reviewable de novo under the right/wrong standard of review.

 IV.  Discussion  
 
 In their briefing of the issues before this court, the 
parties largely7 reassert the arguments made before the district 
court.  As there is no need to reiterate these arguments, we 
proceed directly to answering the modified certified questions. 
A.   A deed is void ab initio for fraud, such that a claim 
challenging the validity of the deed is not subject to a statute 
of limitations, when (1) a deed is forged; or (2) a deed has 
been procured by fraud in the factum. 
 
 The first modified certified question asks, “Under Hawai ʻi 
law, when is a deed void ab initio for fraud, such that a claim 
challenging the validity of the deed is not subject to a statute 
of limitations?”  A survey of our case law reveals that we have 
recognized void deed claims in two instances where fraud has 
been perpetrated upon a grantor:  (1) a deed is forged, meaning 
the deed has been falsely made, completed, endorsed, or altered 
with intent to defraud; and (2)  where the deed itself is 
procured due to fraud in the factum, such as when a person is 
                     
7 Hancock, however, newly raises the argument that HRS § 456 -6(b) (2013), 
governing notaries, contains no statute of limitations, as follows:  
 
For the official misconduct or neglect of a notary public 
or breach of any of the conditions of the notary’s official 
bond, the notary and the surety on the notary’s official 
bond shall be liable to the party injured thereby for all 
the damages sustained.  The party shall have a right of 
action in the party’s own name upon the bond and may 
prosecute the action to final judgment and execution.  
 
There is no allegation in Hancock’s complaint that a notary fraudulently 
modified the deed; therefore, this argument has been waived.   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
14 
 fraudulently deceived about the nature of the document that has 
been signed, as when a document is surreptitiously substituted 
for signature.  Under our case law, deeds executed as a result 
of this type of fraud are void ab initio.  Palau , 22 Haw. at 361 
(“A forged deed is void and passes no title.”); Iaea v. Iaea, 59 
Haw. 648, 650, 586 P.2d 1015, 1017 (1978) (per curiam) 
(affirming the circuit court’s judgment that decreed a forged 
deed to be “null and void”); Kapiolani v. Mahelona, 9 Haw. 676, 
678, 680-81 (Haw. Rep. 1895) (affirming the circuit court’s 
decree cancelling a deed containing the forged signature of King 
Kalakaua); Gonsalves , 47 Haw. at 147 (“The fraud perpetrated on 
[the grantor] went to the nature of the document and not mere 
details, and therefore, all of the documents were void. . . .”).  
 First, a deed is void where it is forged, meaning it has 
been falsely made, completed, endorsed, or altered with intent 
to defraud.8  See, e.g., Iaea, 59 Haw. at 650, 586 P.2d at 1017 
                     
8  This definition of forgery is drawn from HRS § 708 -850, which defines a 
“forged instrument” as “a written instrument which has been falsely made, 
completed, endorsed, or altered.”  HRS § 708 -852, titled “Forgery in the 
second degree,” makes forgery of a deed a class C fel ony.  This court has 
previously looked to the criminal definition of “forgery” in the civil 
context.  See Maui Fin. Co. v. Han , 34 Haw. 226 (Haw. Terr. 1937).  In that 
case, Sarah Hong, the wife of Hong Chang Sok, signed Sok’s  name as an 
endorser on a promissory note while Sok was not present.  34 Haw at 228.  Sok 
could not read or write English, but Sarah could.  Id.  She waited until he 
returned home for his approval, but Sok did not say anything.  34 Haw. at 
229.  The Territorial Supreme Court held that Sarah did not commit forgery 
because she was entirely lacking in the “specific intent to deceive another 
and prejudice him in some right.”  Id.  Furthermore, the Territorial Supreme 
Court held that Sok ratified his wife’s acti on when he remained silent after 
she sought his approval of her act.  Id.   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
15 (continued. . .)  
 (affirming the trial court’s finding that a deed was forged 
where the plaintiff’s husband signed he r name on it without her 
consent); Palau, 22 Haw. at 358 (remanding allegation that two 
different grantors’ signatures on deeds were fabricated); 
Kapiolani, 9 Haw. 676 (affirming the circuit court’s 
determination that a deed purportedly from King Kalakaua was not 
signed by him).     
 Second, a deed is void where it is procured  by fraud in the 
factum.  Gonsalves, 47 Haw. at 147, 384 P.2d at 302.  Fraud in 
the factum “goes to the nature of the document itself,” Adair, 
64 Haw. at 320 n.4, 640 P.2d at 300 n.4, where, for example, a 
grantor signs a deed fraudulently represented to be a lease.  
See also Gonsalves, 47 Haw. 145, 384 P.2d at 301 (affirming 
trial court’s order denying specific performance of a lease, 
bill of sale, and consent to mortgage, all of which were 
fraudulently procured by a real estate agent who did not 
disclose the nature of the documents to the grantor, who could 
not read English).  In these circumstances, deeds are void ab 
initio and not subject to any statute of limitations.9   
                     
9  We note, however, that this court previously left open the possibility 
that the defense of laches could bar a claim that a deed was procured through 
fraud in the factum.  Adair, 64 Haw. at 325 (“[W]e have no doubt that laches 
may preclude an action to cancel a deed for fraud [in the factum] under 
appropriate circumstances.”).   We more recently held that laches is a defense 
at law and at equity.  Association of Apartment Owners of Royal Aloha, 139 
Hawaiʻi at 231, 386 P.3d at 868.  As the issue is not before us, we also do 
not address whether or not adverse possession would also apply  in favor of a *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
16 
  Other juri sdictions have similarly held that a claim that a 
deed is void is not subject to a statute of limitations.   For 
example, the Court of Appeals of New York stated , “For over a 
century, . . . a forged deed has been treated in New York as 
void ab initio. . . [A] statute of limitations cannot validate 
what is void at its inception.  Therefore, a void deed is not

400, 407 (N.Y. 2015).  The Faison  court went on to observe that 
such a rule is “the prevailing approach in other jurisdictions,” 
32 N.E.3d at 405, citing, inter alia, Moore v. S mith-Snagg, 793 
So.2d 1000, 1001 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2015) (per curiam) 
(“[T]here is no statute of limitations in respect to the 
challenge of a forged deed, which is void ab initio .”); and 
Thompson v. Ebbert , 160 P.3d 754, 757 (Idaho 2007) (“Because the 
lease agreement was void ab initio, it could be challenged at 
any time. . . . [The plaintiff’s] action to declare the lease

 B.
   The six-year catch-all statute of limitations under HRS § 
657-1(4) applies to a claim that a deed was procured by fraud of 
the type that does not render it void ab initio, e.g., fraud in 
the inducement and constructive fraud. 
  
 The second modified certified question asks , “Under Hawai ʻi 
law, what statute of limitations applies to a claim that a deed 
was procured by fraud of the type that does not render it void 
ab initio?”    
 In Hawaiʻ i, there
 are three types of fraud recognized in the 
conveyance context:  (1) fraud in the factum, (2) fraud in the 
inducement, and (3) constructive fraud.  Aames Funding Corp. v. 
Mores, 107 Hawaiʻi 95, 103, 110 P.3d 1042, 1050 (2005).  First, 
fraud in the factum “is fraud which goes to the nature of the 
document itself.”  Id.  As stated, supra, Section IV.A., a deed 
procured through fraud in the factum is void ab initio, and a 
claim challenging the validity of such a deed is not subject to 
a statute of limitations.  Second, fraud in the inducement is 
“fraud which induces the transaction by misrepresentation of 
motivating factors.”  107 Hawaiʻi at 103-04, 110 P.3d at 1050- 51.  
Third, constructive fraud is “characterized by the breach of 
fiduciary or confidenti al relationship.”  107 Hawai ʻi at 104, 110 
P.3d at 1051.     
 
Under Hawai ʻi pre
cedent, the latter two fraud claims are 
governed by HRS § 657- 1(4).  That statute states, “The following 
actions shall be commenced within six years next after the cause *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
18 
 of action accrued, and not after: . . . Personal actions10 of any 
nature whatsoever not specifically covered by the laws of the 
State.” 
 This court has applied HRS § 657- 1(4) to claims involving 
fraud.  See, e.g., Au, 63 Haw. 210, 626 P.3d 173 (applying HRS § 
657-1(4) to plaintiffs’ claims that defendants fraudulently 
and/or negligently misrepresented to her that the home she 
bought from them did not have a water leak); Eastman v. McGowan, 
86 Hawai ʻi 21, 946 P.2d 1317 (1997) (applying HRS § 657- 1(4) to 
plaintiffs’ claims that defendant fraudulently misrepresented to 
them that she would reconvey real property to them); cf. Small 
v. Badenhop, 67 Haw. 626, 701 P.2d 647 (1985) (engaging in a 
laches analysis, based upon finding that the analogous statute 
of limitations would be the six- year statute of limitations 
found in HRS § 657- 1, to a claim involving constructive fraud). 
Therefore, we answer the second certified question, as modified, 
as follows:  HRS § 657-1(4)’s six-year statute of limitations 
applies to a claim that a deed has been procured through fraud 
                     
10  A “personal action” is  
an action brought for the recovery of personal property, 
for the enforcement of a contract or to recover for its 
breach, or for the recovery of damages for the commission 
of an injury to the person or property; an action for the 
recovery of a debt, or damages from the breach of contract, 
or for a specific personal chattel, or for the satisfaction 
in damages for injury to the person or property.  
Au, 63 Haw. at 217, 626 P.2d at 179 (citations omitted).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
19 
 of the kind that does not render it void ab initio, e.g., fraud 
in the inducement and constructive fraud.   
C.
   A plaintiff grantor’s claim for fraudulent modification of 
an executed deed accrues when the plaintiff grantor discovers, 
or reasonably should have discovered, the existence of the claim 
or the identity of the person who is liable for the claim. 
 
 The third modified certified question asks,
 “Under Hawai ʻi 
law, when does the statute of limitations begin to run on a 
grantor’s claim that a deed was procured by fraud of the type 
that does not render it void ab initio
:  upon recordation of the 
deed or at some other point in time?”   There are conflicting 
decisions from other states as to whether the recordation of a 
conveyance document charges a party to a conveyance with 
constructive notice of any alleged fraud.  
See, e.g., 152 A.L.R. 
461, “Public Records as constructive notice as regards actions 
predicated upon fraudulent misrepresentation or concealment, so 
as to start the running of the statute of limitations against 
the bringing of such action” (1944 & Cum. Supp.).  On one hand, 
some courts hold that, “since public records . . . of 
conveyances . . . are open to the public, everyone is bound by 
notice of their contents,” including parties to the conveyance 
themselves.  Id. (citing, e.g., Blum v. Elkins, 369 S.W.2d 810, 
813-14 (Tex. App. 1963) (charging grantor with constructive 
notice of the consideration paid for the sale of grantor’s  
property, once the deed was recorded)).   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
20 
  On the other hand, “[o]ther courts take the view that a 
public record of a conveyance of land being meant for the 
protection of possible subsequent purchasers or encumbrancers, 
only they –  and not the innocent party to a fraudulent 
transaction –  are bound thereby.”  152 A.L.R. 461.  These courts 
reason that once a grantor has made a conveyance, the grantor is 
under no duty to examine the property records to see if fraud 
has been committed.  See  152 A.L.R. 461 (citing , e.g., Gates v. 
Kansas Farmers’ Union Royalty Co. , 111 P.2d 1098, 1103-04 (Kan. 
1941) (“[N]either is the recording of a deed executed by the 
owner of a property constructive notice to the grantor of the 
fact that there had been fraudulently included in the deed a 
description of property other than that which the grantor had 
intended to convey so as to start the running of the statute of 
limitations. . . . Normally an owner of the property who 
executes a deed therefor has no occasion to examine the record 
after the deed is recorded, to ascertain if a fraud has been 
committed upon him.”)).   
 Some courts further consider whether the one perpetrating 
the fraud is in a fiduciary position with respect to the 
defrauded party.  152 A.L.R. 461.  In cases where a fiduciary 
relationship exists, there is a “relaxed” duty to search 
property records for fraud.  Id.  (citing, e.g., Hutto v. 
Knowlton, 108 P. 825, 825 (Kan. 1910) (“Where fiduciary *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
21 
 relations exist requiring the 
disclosure of the true state of 
facts, there is no reason to anticipate unfaithfulness, and the 
obligation to search the record is relaxed.”)).  
 Hawaiʻi’s appella
te courts have not yet decided whether the 
recordation of a conveyance document charges a party to the 
conveyance with constructive notice of fraud for statute of 
limitations purposes.  The Hawaiʻi appellate cases concerning the 
recordation of documents as providing constructive notice deal 
primarily with constructive notice to subsequent purchasers or 
encumbrancers.  See, e.g., Lathrop v. Sakatani, 111 Hawai ʻi 307, 
310, 141 P.3d 480, 483 (2006) (recordation of a lis pendens 
provides constructive notice of a lawsuit to third parties); 
Ass’n of Apartment Owners of Kukui Plaza v. City & Cty. of 
Honolulu, 7 Haw. App. 60, 70, 742 P.2d 974, 981 (1987) 
(recordation of leases placed buyers on notice that City had the 
right to acquire parking areas for municipal parking); Harada v. 
Ellis, 4 Haw. App. 439, 443, 667 P.2d 834, 838 (1983) 
(recordation of lis pendens provided constructive notice of 
counterclaim to prospective purchaser of the property). 
 In this case, we agree with Hancock that recordation of a 
deed does not, as a matter of law, provide constructive notice 
to the grantor that the deed was fraudulently modified after 
execution.  It is true that recordation of a deed provides 
constructive notice to subsequent purchasers and encumbrancers *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
22 
 of the contents of the deed.  See  Markham, 80 Hawai ʻi at 281, 909 
P.2d at 609 (holding that the “central purpose o f recording a 
conveyance of real property is to give notice to the general 
public of the conveyance and to preserve the recorded instrument 
as evidence”).  We have long held, however, that “the recording 
of a deed is notice, not, as it is sometimes inaccurately said 
to the whole world, but merely to those who are bound to search 
the record.”  In re Nelson, 26 Haw. 809, 820 (Haw. Terr. 1923).   
A grantor is ordinarily not duty bound to search the record of 
the completed conveyance to determine whether the documents 
filed were fraudulently modified. 
 Further, as Hancock points out, Fidelity occupied a 
fiduciary role with respect to the parties to the conveyance.  
See DeMello v. Home Escrow, Inc., 4 Haw. App. 41, 47, 659 P.2d 
759, 763 (1983) (“The general rule is that an escrow depository 
occupies a fiduciary relationship with the parties to the escrow 
agreement or instructions[.]”).  As such, Fidelity was required 
to “comply strictly with the provisions” of the parties’ escrow 
agreement or instructions.  Id.   Hancock correctly alleges he 
should have been able to rely on Fidelity to faithfully record 
the deed he executed.   
 The question then becomes at what point does a fraudulent 
modification claim accrue, for statute of limitations purposes?  
Hancock asserts that any statute of limitations applicable to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
23 
 his case would be tolled due to Fidelity’s alleged act of 
removing two paragraphs from the deed he executed without 
disclosing the change to him.  As such, Hancock claims 
fraudulent concealment of his cause of action.  See Au, 63 Haw. 
at 215-16, 626 P.2d at 178 (“Fraudulent concealment involves the 
actions taken by a liable party to conceal a known cause of 
action.”).   
 HRS § 657 -20 (2016), titled “Extension by fraudulent 
concealment,” provides a six -year statute of limitations for 
actions under HRS chapter 657, commencing when the plaintiff 
discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, the claim or 
the identity of the person who is liable for the claim:   
If any person who is liable to any of the actions mentioned 
in this part . . . fraudulently conceals the existence of a 
cause of action or the identity of any person who is liable 
for the claim from the knowledge of the person entitled to 
bring the action, the action may be commenced at any time 
within six years after the person who is entitled to bring 
the same discovers or reasonably should have discovered, 
the existence of the cause of action or the identity of the 
person who is liable for the claim, although the action 
would otherwise be barred by the period of limitations.  
  
The statute makes clear that the statute of limitations for 
bringing a fraudulent modification claim accrues when the 
plaintiff discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, the 
existence of the claim or the identity of the person who is 
liable for the claim.

 V.  Conclusion
 
 To reiterate, the three questions before this court, as 
reframed, are as follows: 
1.  Under Hawai ʻi law, when is a deed void ab initio for 
fraud, such that a claim challenging the validity of  the 
deed is not subject to a statute of limitations?  
 
 
2.  Under Hawai ʻi law, what statute of limitations applies 
to a claim that a deed was procured by fraud of the type 
that does not render it void ab initio?  
 
 
3.  Under Hawai ʻi
 law, when does the statute of limitations 
begin to run on a grantor’s claim that a deed was procured 
by fraud of the type that does not render it void ab 
initio:  upon recordation of the deed or at some other 
point in time?   
 
 To answer the first modified certified question, we hold 
that, under Hawai ʻi law, a deed is
 void ab initio for fraud, such 
that a claim challenging the validity of the deed is not subject 
to a statute of limitations, when (1)  a deed is forged, meaning 
it has been falsely made, completed, endorsed, or altered with 
intent to defraud; or (2)  a deed has been procured by fraud in 
the factum, such as when a person is fraudulently deceived about 
the nature of the document that has been signed, as when a 
document is surreptitiously substituted for signature.  To 
answer the second modified certified question, we hold that the 
six-year statute of limitations under HRS § 657-1(4) applies to 
claims that a deed was procured by fraud of the type that does 
not render it void ab initio, e.g., fraud in the inducement and 
constructive fraud.  To answer the third modified certified 
question, we hold that the statute of limitations begins to run *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
25 
 on a grantor’s claim that a deed was procured by fraud of the 
type that does not render it void ab initio when the grantor 
discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, the existence 
of the claim or the person liable for the claim, as discussed in 
this opinion.11
