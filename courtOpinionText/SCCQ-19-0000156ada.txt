Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 657-
1(4). 
II. BACKGROUND
On March 11, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals 
for the Ninth Circuit certified a question of Hawai‘ i law to this 
court pursuant to HRS § 602-5(a)(2) (Supp. 2016) and 
Hawai‘i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 13, asking us to 
resolve the following question: 
What is the applicable statute of limitations for a claim 
against the State of Hawai‘ i alleging an unlawful taking of 
“[p]rivate property . . . for public use without just 
compensation,” Haw. Const. art. 1, § 20?[1]  
Parties and amicus curiae advocate three different 
positions on this question: the State of Hawai ‘i Land Use 
Commission and other defendants (collectively LUC) argue that 
the limitations period is two years;  DW Aina Le ‘a Development ,2  
1In general, there are two types of takings claims: physical 
takings and regulatory takings.  The first arises “when an actual physical 
invasion of the landowner’s property has occurred.”  31 Am. Jur. Proof of 
Facts 3d 563 § 2 (2020).  Conversely, “[a] regulatory taking results when a 
governmental regulation places such a burdensome restriction on a landowner’s use of his property that the government has for all intents and purposes 
‘taken’ the landowner’s property.”  Id.  Because DW’s state constitutional 
claim is for a regulatory — rather than a physical — taking, we answer the 
certified question only as to the statute of limitations for a regulatory taking.  Allstate Ins. Co. v. Alamo Rent-A- Car, Inc., 137 F.3d 634, 637 (9th 
Cir. 1998) (“The court may reformulate the relevant state law questions as it perceives them to be, in light of the contentions of the parties.” (quotation 
marks omitted)). 
2HRS § 661-5 (2016) states, “Every claim against the State, 
cognizable under this part, shall be forever barred unless the action is 
commenced within two years after the claim first accrues[.]”

HRS § 661-1 (2016) provides: 
 
The several circuit courts of the State and, except 
as otherwise provided by statute or rule, the several 
state district courts, subject to appeal as provided 
by law, shall have original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters, and, unless 
otherwise provided by law, shall determine all 
questions of fact involved without the intervention 
of a jury: 
 
(1) All claims against the State founded upon 
any statute of the State; upon any rule of an 
executive department; or upon any contract, 
expressed or implied, with the State, and all 
claims which may be referred to any such court 
by the legislature; provided that no action shall be maintained, nor shall any process 
issue against the State, based on any contract 
or any act of any state officer that the 
officer is not authorized to make or do by the 
laws of the State, nor upon any other cause of action than as herein set forth; and 
 
(2) All counterclaims, whether liquidated or 
unliquidated, or other demands whatsoever on 
the part of the State against any person making 
claim against the State under this part. 
 
Alternatively, the statute of limitations could also be two years 
if a takings claim were held to be a personal injury action.  HRS § 657- 7 
(2016) states, “Actions for the recovery of compensation for damage or injury to persons or property shall be instituted within two years after the cause 
of action accrued, and not after[.]”  
 
3  HRS § 657-1 (2016) states in relevant part: 
 
The following actions shall be commenced within six years next after the cause of action accrued, and not after: 
 
. . . 
 
(4) Personal actions of any nature whatsoever not specifically covered by the laws of the 
State.  
4  HRS § 657-31 (2016) states, “No person shall commence an action 
to recover possession of any lands, or make any entry thereon, unless within twenty years after the right to bring the action first accrued.” ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
4The following facts are taken from the Ninth Circuit’s 
Order Certifying Question.  The underlying dispute arises from 
the LUC’s reclassification of 1,060 acres of land in South 
Kohala on 
Hawai‘i Island.  The LUC classified this land as 
“agricultural” until 1989, when it reclassified the land as 
“urban.”  In exchange for reclassification to allow for 
development, the LUC required that a percentage of the 
residential units constructed be “affordable,” along with other conditions.  In 2008, believing that the then-landowner, Bridge 
Aina Le‘ a LLC (Bridge), had failed “to perform according to the 
conditions imposed and to the representations and commitments 
made to the [LUC] in obtaining reclassification,” the LUC issued 
an order requiring Bridge to show cause why the land should not 
be reclassified back to agricultural use.  In February 2009, 
Bridge told the LUC that DW had agreed to purchase the property 
along with the right to develop it for residential use.  
Notwithstanding DW’s purchase and its representation 
that it had invested more than $28 million into the development, 
the LUC voted to reclassify the land as agricultural in April 2009 — finalized in a written order on April 25, 2011.  
This 
court eventually vacated that order because the LUC had not complied with HRS § 205-4 (2007) when it reclassified the land.  
DW Aina Le‘ a Dev., LLC v. Bridge Aina Le‘ a
 , LLC, 134 Hawai‘ i 187, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
5213, 339 P.3d 685, 711 (2014).  On February 23, 2017, DW filed 
the complaint currently at issue in the Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit.  DW alleged that the 2011 reclassification was an 
unconstitutional taking under the federal and state constitutions because the LUC failed to compensate DW for 
damages resulting from the land’s reclassification.  
Specifically, DW alleged that the LUC’s reclassification caused 
substantial delay in finalizing the purchase, resulting in an 
increased purchase price of a portion of the land compared to 
the original contract price.  In addition, DW alleged that the 
reclassification resulted in “interest costs, loss of business 
opportunities, substantial increases in land acquisition costs, 
inability to obtain financing as well as damages to its general business name and reputation.”  The takings claim is styled as 
an “inverse condemnation” action - an action that allows a 
landowner to enforce the Takings Clause against the government 
where a regulatory action eliminates or severely diminishes the 
land’s economic value.  Leone v. Cty. of Maui, 141 Hawai
‘i 68, 
81, 404 P.3d 1257, 1270 (2017) (citing Lucas v. S.C. Coastal 
Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1015 (1992); Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 
533 U.S. 606, 617 (2001)). 
A. Federal Court Proceedings
The LUC removed the case to the United States District  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
 
6 Court for the District of Hawai‘ i (district court)  and then 
filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the statute of5
 
limitations on DW’s takings claim had expired.  The district 
court agreed, applying the two-year statute of limitations found 
in HRS § 657-7 (1972). 
The district court determined the statute of 
limitations for the state constitutional claim by reference to 
the statute of limitations for the federal constitutional claim.  First, with respect to DW’s federal takings claim, the district 
court found that although DW did not bring its claim via 42 
U.S.C. § 1983 (1996), the two-year statute of limitations for 
such a claim should apply.
6  The court reasoned that “there is no 
substantive distinction between a federal regulatory takings claim brought . . . under § 1983 and a federal regulatory 
takings claim that might be brought . . . directly under the 
federal Constitution.”  DW Aina Le‘ a Dev., LLC v. State of 
Hawai‘i Land Use Comm’n, No. 17-00113 SOM-RLP, 2017 WL 2563226, 
at *7 (D. Haw. Jun. 13, 2017).  The district court further held that because HRS § 657-7 and the Takings Clause of the Hawai‘ i 
Constitution both use the term “compensation,” HRS § 657-7 ought 
                                                 
5  The Honorable Susan Oki Mollway presided. 
 
6 Federal courts use state personal injury statutes of limitations 
for claims brought under § 1983.  Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 275-7 6 
(1985).  Hawai‘i’s  statute of limitations for “ the recovery of compensation 
for damage or injury to persons or property” is found in HRS § 657-7.  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
 
7 to apply to the state constitutional claims.  Id. at *11.  
Second, the district court found that even if the 
limitation in HRS § 657-7 did not apply, the two-year limitation 
in HRS § 661-5 barred both state and federal takings claims.  Id. at *9.  HRS § 661-5 covers “[e]very claim against the State, 
cognizable under this part[.]”  “[T]his part” gives state courts jurisdiction over “[a]ll claims against the State founded upon 
any statute of the State; upon any rule of an executive 
department; or upon any contract, express or implied, with the 
State, and all claims which may be referred to any such court by 
the legislature[.]”  HRS § 661-1(1).  Although the text of the 
statute does not extend its application to cases arising under 
the Hawai‘ i Constitution, the district court relied on the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) decision in Maunalua Bay 
Beach Ohana 28 v. State, 122 Hawai‘ i 34, 222 P.3d 441 (App. 
2009), to conclude that the limitations period applies 
nonetheless to disputes arising under the state constitution.  
2017 WL 2563226, at *9.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals 
indicated, however, that this court’s decision in Kaho‘ ohanohano 
v. State, 114 Hawai‘ i 302, 162 P.3d 696 (2007), appeared to 
contradict the district court’s conclusion.  In Kaho‘ ohanohano, 
this court found that the limitations period in HRS § 661-5 did 
not apply to the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims because those  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
 
8 claims were not “cognizable under HRS chapter 661.”  114 
Hawai‘i 
at 338, 162 P.3d at 732 (alterations omitted). 
DW unsuccessfully urged the district court to rule 
that the “catch-all” six-year statute of limitations applied to 
the action.  It now raises the same argument on appeal to the 
Ninth Circuit.  Faced with this dispute on appeal, the Ninth 
Circuit Court of Appeals seeks this court’s determination of the 
statute of limitations for a takings claim under the Hawai‘ i 
Constitution.7 
B.  Supreme Court Proceedings 
 1.  DW’s Opening Brief 
DW first argues that HRS § 661-5 only applies to 
claims brought pursuant to Chapter 661.  It continues to argue 
that HRS § 657-1(4) is the appropriate statute of limitations, 
“since there are no other specific limitations periods that 
would be applicable.”   
In accordance with Kaho‘ ohanohano,  DW argues that no 
claim can fall under the two-year statute of limitations in HRS 
                                                 
7  In Bridge Aina Le‘ a, LLC v. State of Hawai‘ i Land Use Commission, 
950 F.3d 610 (9th Cir. 2020), the Ninth Circuit determined that Bridge’s 
takings claim under the Hawai‘ i Constitution - based on the same set of facts 
that underlie DW’s claim here, but brought by a separate plaintiff - was not 
viable because Bridge did not show that it had suffered damages.  Id. at 632.  
We do not address whether Bridge has preclusive effect on the merits of DW’s 
claim because it is beyond the scope of the certified question presented to 
us, which asks only what the statute of limitations is for such a claim. 
  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
 
9 § 661-5 unless it is a type of claim cognizable under that 
chapter.   In DW’s view, its claims are not founded upon a 
statute because “claims based on the constitution are not founded upon any statute of the State[.]”  It also contends the claims are also not based upon an implied contract between the 
State and DW because “the right to be compensated for a taking 
of property does not arise upon a contract, but rests primarily 
upon a vested constitutional right.”  (Citing Hiji v. City of 
Garnett, 804 P.2d 950 (Kan. 1991).) 8
Further, DW argues that its claims are not based on an 
executive department regulation, but instead, on an “improper 
reversion of land classifications, from urban to 
agricultural[.]”  Thus, according to DW, because “DW’s claims are not founded upon a statute, upon any regulation of an 
executive department or upon any contract and the claims were 
not referred to the court by the legislature, but brought 
pursuant to the [Hawai‘ i] Constitution itself,” the Chapter 661 
two-year statute of limitations does not apply.   
DW recognizes that the ICA applied the two-year 
statute of limitations in HRS § 661-5 to a takings claim under 
                                                 
 8  As stated supra, note 2, HRS § 661-1 (1) governs “[a]ll claims 
against the State founded upon any statute of the State; upon any rule of an 
executive department; or upon any contract, expressed or implied, with the 
State, and all claims which may be referred to any such court by the legislature[.]”

10 the 
Hawai‘i Constitution in Maunalua Bay, but argues that 
Kaho‘ohanohano  overruled Maunalua Bay by implication.   
DW further asserts that takings claims are not 
properly treated as personal injury actions, which would subject 
the claims to the two-year statute of limitations in HRS § 657-
7, because a takings cause of action arises from the text of the 
Hawai‘i Constitution.  Citing Au v. Au, 63 Haw. 210, 626 P.2d 173 
(1981), DW argues that this court “prioritizes the type of wrong 
over the end result” when determining which statute of 
limitations applies.  Thus, it maintains that because “the true 
nature of DW’s takings claims is not the damages incurred to its 
property interests, but rather the unconstitutional takings of 
its property interests without just compensation,” the personal 
injury statute of limitations does not apply.  DW argues that the federal district court was incorrect to apply the personal 
injury statute of limitations because the personal injury 
limitations period does not apply to all constitutional claims, 
only those federal constitutional claims brought pursuant to 41 U.S.C. § 1983.  It asserts state takings claims are distinct 
from § 1983 claims in that the state has “the power and the 
right to revert the land from urban to agricultural” zoning, so long as just compensation is provided.  Additionally, DW cites 
First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
 
11 of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304 (1987), to support the proposition 
that a claim based on the constitution itself is fundamentally 
different from a claim based on a statute; thus, the § 1983 
statute of limitations should not apply to a takings claim.   
2.  Defendants’ Answering Brief 
  The LUC asserts that, “[a]s a general principle, all cognizable claims for money damages against the State are 
subject to a statutory limitations period,” and that the period 
is two years.   
  The LUC first argues that inverse condemnation claims 
should be characterized as claims arising under an implied 
contract.  According to the LUC, Meyer v. Territory of Hawai‘ i, 
36 Haw. 75 (Haw. Terr. 1942), supports its interpretation.  In 
Meyer, the plaintiff brought suit for a taking pursuant to a 
statute that permitted suits based on implied contracts with the 
Territory of Hawai‘ i.  Id. at 76.  The LUC pointed out that North 
Dakota, Virginia, Ohio, Maryland, Kansas, and Alabama have also 
treated takings claims as arising from implied contracts, though 
it recognizes that Kansas has also applied the statute of limitations for adverse possession to such claims.  The LUC also 
contends that the United States Supreme Court decided similarly 
in Phelps v. United States, 274 U.S. 341, 343 (1927), with 
respect to takings claims brought under the U.S. Constitution.   
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
 
12 According to the LUC, if DW’s claim is construed as a claim 
against the State arising out of an implied contract, the claim 
would be subject to HRS § 661-5.  The LUC argues that this court 
should look to the “underlying realities” of the claim to determine which statute of limitations should apply.   
  The LUC distinguishes Kaho‘ ohanohano on the ground that 
the constitutional provision sought to be enforced in this case 
does not prohibit the government from taking private property; it merely requires that the government compensate the owner.  
According to the LUC, Kaho‘ ohanohano and related cases
9 do not 
prohibit the application of HRS § 661-5 to all constitutional 
claims, only to the claim at issue in that case – which was a 
claim under article XVI, section 2 (regarding membership in an 
employees’ retirement system) – not a takings claim.   
  The LUC argues that the catch-all statute of limitations in HRS § 657-1 does not apply because it is a 
statute of general application.  Quoting Big Island Small 
Ranchers Ass’n v. State, 60 Haw. 228, 236, 588 P.2d 430, 436 
(1978), the LUC asserts that “statutory laws of general application are not applicable to the State unless the 
                                                 
 9  The LUC also distinguishes Kaleikini v. Yoshioka, 129 Hawai‘ i 454, 
304 P.3d 252 (2013), and Nelson v. Hawaiian Homes Commission, 130 Hawai‘ i 162, 
307 P.3d 142 (2013), on the grounds that the plaintiffs in those cases sought 
declaratory and injunctive relief and the issue was whether the State had waived sovereign immunity for an award of attorneys’ fees.    
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
 
13 legislature in the enactment of such laws made them explicitly 
applicable to the State.”  In Big Island, this court held that 
HRS Chapter 480, which regulates intrastate commerce, did not apply to the State.  Similarly, the LUC cites Chun v. Board of 
Trustees of Employees’ Retirement System, 106 Hawai‘ i 416, 433, 
106 P.3d 339, 356 (2005), for the same principle; this court 
held in Chun that HRS § 478-3 (1986), which permits post-
judgment interest, did not apply to judgments against the State.   
  Finally, the LUC contends that even if we conclude that HRS § 661-5 does not apply to DW’s claim, we should 
conclude that HRS § 657-7 does.  HRS § 657-7 provides a two-year 
statute of limitations for “[a]ctions for the recovery of 
compensation for damage or injury to persons or property[.]”  
The LUC argues that the use of the terms “compensation” and 
“damage” in both the Takings Clause of the Constitution and the statute of limitations shows that the statute applies to takings 
claims.  The LUC disagrees with the proposition stated in Au 
that HRS § 657-7 only applies to physical injury to persons or tangible interests in property.  The LUC asserts that Higa v. 
Mirikitani, 55 Haw. 167, 169-70 n.5, 517 P.2d 1, 3 n.5 (1973), 
upon which the Au court relied, did not limit the applicability 
of HRS § 657-7 to physical injuries, but merely noted that physical injury was the context in which the statute had  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
 
14 previously been applied.    10
 3.  DW’s Reply Brief 
  DW points out that, of the states applying the 
limitations period for implied contracts to takings claims, all but Virginia have a limitations period of six years.   
  
With respect to the argument that a takings claim is 
based upon an implied contract, DW continues to argue that the 
language of Kaho‘ ohanohano is dispositive, stating that 
“constitutional claims” are “plainly not ‘founded upon any 
statute of the State; or upon any regulation of an executive 
department; or upon any contract,’” and therefore are not 
subject to HRS § 661-5.  (Quoting Kaho‘ ohanohano, 114 Hawai‘ i at 
338, 162 P.3d at 732.)  Similarly, DW argues that the Court’s 
holding in United States v. Dickinson, 331 U.S. 745, 748 (1947), 
that federal takings claims are “founded upon the Constitution of the United States” supports its position.  DW further argues 
that the Kansas Supreme Court has expressly rejected the 
contention that a takings claim arises out of an implied 
contract, citing Hiji.  Along with Kansas, DW argues that 
Nevada, Texas, Washington, and Michigan courts have taken the 
view that the statute of limitations for breach of an implied 
                                                 
 10  The LUC notes that DW’s claim alleges a regulatory taking rather 
than a physical taking but argues that the same statute of limitations should 
apply to both.   
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
 
15 contract does not apply to takings claims.   
  DW also contends that takings claims under the Hawai‘ i 
Constitution should be “subject to stricter protections, 
including a lengthier statute of limitations,” than personal 
injury actions.  Finally, DW responds that the State waived 
sovereign immunity when it removed this matter to federal court, 
so its arguments about generally-applicable statutes should be 
ignored.   
4.  OCA’s Amicus Curiae Brief 
As amicus curiae, OCA argues that the statute of 
limitations for inverse condemnation should be the same as the 
limitations period for adverse possession.11  
OCA begins with the premise that article I, section 20 
of the Hawai‘ i Constitution is self-executing.  Consequently, an 
inverse condemnation action does not seek damages for a taking; instead, such an action seeks to compel the government to 
recognize that there has been a taking.  Once the government 
recognizes that there has been a taking, just compensation for 
that taking is automatically warranted. 
OCA then analogizes inverse condemnation to adverse 
possession - an action in which “a non-owner asserts an interest 
                                                 
11 Although OCA does not cite to Hawai‘ i’s  statute of limitations for 
adverse possession in its a micus brief, the relevant limitations period is 
twenty years, set forth in HRS § 657-31.  
  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
 
16 in, or ownership of, the owner’s property.”  OCA argues that 
property owners are in the same position in inverse condemnation 
and adverse possession actions.  Recognizing when inverse 
condemnation has occurred and when land is being adversely possessed both take significant time.  A regulation’s impact on 
land’s economic value may not appear immediately.  Similarly, a 
landowner may not immediately realize that another person is 
adversely possessing their land.   
OCA then asserts that “the majority national rule is 
that when an inverse condemnation claim is not governed by a 
specific statute of limitations, the adverse possession 
limitation period applies, not the ‘catch all.’”  OCA cites 
several out-of-state cases in which state supreme courts adopted this rule.  In one of these cases, White Pine Lumber Co. v. City 
of Reno, 801 P.2d 1370, 1371 (Nev. 1990), the court noted that, 
“had the ‘taker’ in this case been a private party, the 
applicable limitations period would have been the one for 
acquiring title by adverse possession.”  The Nevada court used 
this comparison to conclude that the statutes of limitation 
ought to be the same for the two types of actions.  Id. at 1371–
72. 
Finally, OCA addresses the fundamental differences 
between torts and takings.  While the purpose of a plaintiff who  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
 
17 brings a tort claim is to establish that the defendant’s action 
was wrong, a takings claim requires that the government’s action 
was not wrong and instead simply warrants compensation.  OCA 
argues that this distinction renders tort law unsuitable for resolving inverse condemnation actions. 
 5.  Defendants’ Response to OCA’s Amicus Brief  
  The LUC first argues that this court should decline to 
adopt a position not taken by any party to the litigation.  Further, it asserts “[f]undamental differences between adverse 
possession claims and inverse condemnation claims make the 
application of the same statute of limitations inappropriate.”  
Citing Hart v. City of Detroit, 331 N.W.2d 438, 497 (Mich. 
1982), the LUC argues that in most cases, actions of the 
government that could constitute a regulatory taking would not 
constitute adverse possession.  Additionally, the LUC contends 
that adverse possession does not apply against the government.  
The LUC also notes that “in all the cases OCA cites in which 
courts adopted the adverse possession statutory period for 
inverse condemnation claims, the statutory period was shorter 
than the twenty years under Hawai‘ i law.”   
  Finally, the LUC argues that the policy considerations 
underlying the twenty-year statute of limitations for adverse 
possession do not apply to inverse condemnation claims.   
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
 
18 Specifically, the LUC contends that, unlike takings, the 
doctrine of adverse possession is meant to discourage landowners 
from leaving their land unused for long periods of time; a long 
statute of limitations facilitates this.   
III. DISCUSSION 
A.  The Two-Year Statute of Limitations in HRS § 661-5 for 
Claims Against the State Does Not Apply 
 
   The language of Hawai‘ i’s Takings Clause shows that it 
is self-executing.  Consequently, DW’s claim pursuant to the 
clause is properly construed as a direct constitutional claim 
rather than a claim based on an implied contract with the State.  
The claim is therefore beyond the scope of HRS § 661-1 and the accompanying statute of limitations for that chapter. 
 1.  The Takings Clause of the Hawai‘ i Constitution is self-
executing 
 
   Kaho‘ohanohano is clear that “constitutional claims are 
plainly not ‘founded upon any statute of the State; or upon any 
regulation of an executive department; or upon any contract’ and were not ‘referred to [the] court by the legislature[.]’”  114 
Hawai‘i at 338, 162 P.3d at 732.  Instead, the claims in 
Kaho‘ohanohano, like DW’s claim, were based on the language of 
the Hawai‘ i Constitution.12  With respect to takings, the Hawai‘ i 
                                                 
12  In Kaho‘ohanohano, t he Legislature had recently amended HRS  
          (continued . . .) 
  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
 
19 Constitution states, “Private property shall not be taken or 
damaged for public use without just compensation.”  Haw. Const. 
art. 1, § 20.  We conclude that the Takings Clause of the Hawai‘ i
Constitution contains self-executing language, enabling suits 
based on the provision itself without implementing legislation.  
   This court has stated: 
A constitutional provision may be said to be self- executing 
if it supplies a sufficient rule by means of which the 
right given may be enjoyed and protected, or the duty 
imposed may be enforced; and it is not self- executing when 
it merely indicates principles, without laying down rules 
by means of which those principles may be given the force of law. 
 
State v. Rodrigues, 63 Haw. 412, 414, 629 P.2d 1111, 1113 (1981) 
(quoting Davis v. Burke, 179 U.S. 399, 403 (1900)).   
   Article 16, section 16 of the Hawai‘ i Constitution 
states, “The provisions of this constitution shall be self-
executing to the fullest extent that their respective natures 
permit.”  In general, with respect to provisions where the 
constitution uses the phrase “as provided by law,” this court 
has held that the provision is not self-executing; rather, this 
phrase denotes that some additional legislation is necessary to implement it.  Rodrigues, 63 Haw. at 415, 629 P.2d at 1114.  The 
                                                 
§ 88-107 (Supp. 2006) in a way that allegedly retroactively divested the 
state Employees’ Retirement System of $346.9 million.  114 Hawai ‘i at 342, 162 
P.3d at 736.  S tate and county employees brought suit claiming, among other 
things,
 that the amendment violated article XVI, section 2 of the Hawai‘ i 
Constitution, which states: “Membership in any employees’ retirement system 
of the State or any political subdivision thereof shall be a contractual 
relationship, the accrued benefits of which shall not be diminished or impaired.”  Id. at 310 n.3, 315, 162 P.3d at 705 n.3, 709.  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
 
20 absence of the phrase “as provided by law” in the constitutional 
provision means that no further legislation is necessary to 
effectuate the right.  
   The Takings Clause thus satisfies the test set forth 
in Rodrigues.  The rule that the State may not take or damage 
private property without just compensation provides a triggering event (taking or damage to private property), a remedy 
(compensation), and a metric for the remedy.  “As provided by 
law” does not appear in article I, section 20.  The Takings 
Clause thus contains language that is self-executing and needs 
no further legislation to facilitate a private right of action.  
See Cty. of Hawai‘ i v. Ala Loop Homeowners, 123 Hawai‘ i 391, 413, 
235 P.3d 1103, 1125 (2010) (holding that the right of enforcement in article XI, section 9 of the Hawai‘ i Constitution 
is self-executing because the language “does not suggest that 
legislative action is needed before the right can be 
implemented”).  Indeed, other plaintiffs have brought complaints 
pursuant to the Takings Clause itself.  See, e.g., Leone v. Cty. 
of Maui, 141 Hawai‘ i 68, 72, 404 P.3d 1257, 1261 (2017) 
(landowners’ complaint raised a claim directly under the Takings 
Clause of the Hawai‘ i Constitution as Count 1); Carswell v. Dep’t 
of Land and Nat. Res., No. 28730, at 1 (App. May 22, 2009) (SDO) 
(noting that Count 3 of Plaintiffs’ complaint was a “reverse

21 condemnation” claim). 
 2.  Takings claims are not based on an implied contract 
with the State 
 
   The LUC urges us to adopt the view of those states 
that have found takings claims to arise out of an implied 
contract.  As DW’s takings claim is a direct constitutional 
claim, we decline to characterize it as based on an implied 
contract with the State.   Although, as the LUC asserts, some state supreme 
courts have taken the implied contract route, many others have 
not.  We find particularly persuasive the view of the Kansas 
Supreme Court, which specifically rejected the position the LUC 
urges us to take: 
 Although inverse condemnation actions have been 
described as being in the nature of implied contract 
actions, the right to just compensation for property taken 
is also a firmly grounded constitutional right.  While our 
earlier cases primarily discuss the implied contract theory of recovery, both the Fifth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution and [the Takings Clause] of the Kansas 
Constitution guarantee payment for private property 
appropriated to public use.  Thus, the right to recover 
damages for property taken does not rest solely upon a contract “expressed or implied but not in writing” under 
K.S.A. 60- 512(1), but rests primarily upon a vested 
constitutional right.  Regardless of how the cause of action is described or what theory of recovery is applied, 
the basic right to recover compensation for property taken for public purposes is a constitutional one.  
 
Hiji, 804 P.2d at 957-58.  
   The validity of the LUC’s assertion that the federal 
courts have held takings claims to arise out of an implied 
contract is also suspect.  Notably, the United States Supreme  
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
 
22 Court recently observed that “[a]lthough there is no express 
cause of action under the Takings Clause, aggrieved owners can 
sue through the Tucker Act under our case law.”  Me. Comm. 
Health Options v. United States, -- U.S. ---, 140 S. Ct. 1308, 1328 n.12 (2020).  The Tucker Act authorizes “claim[s] against 
the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any 
Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or 
upon any express or implied contract with the United States.”  
Id. at 1327 (alterations in original) (quoting 28 U.S.C. 
§ 1491(a)(1)).  The Tucker Act’s language is nearly identical to 
the language in HRS § 661-1, except for the addition of “the 
Constitution” to the list of bases for suit.  This indicates 
that claims pursuant to the federal Takings Clause are founded upon the U.S. Constitution, rather than on the breach of an 
implied contract.   In short, the federal case law on this topic 
does not appear to provide an endorsement of the State’s conclusion in the case before us.   
13
B.  The Two-Year Statute of Limitations in HRS § 657-7 for 
Injuries to Person or Property Does Not Apply 
 
   
HRS § 657-7 states, “Actions for the recovery of 
compensation for damage or injury to persons or property shall 
be instituted within two years after the cause of action 
                                                 
13  It appears that the statute of limitations under the Tucker Act 
for a takings claim is six years.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2501 ( 2004).   
 
 
***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
 
 
23 accrued, and not after[.]”  The LUC’s arguments that HRS § 657-7 
applies are unpersuasive.  Black’s Law Dictionary defines 
“injury” as “[t]he violation of another’s legal right, for which 
the law provides a remedy[.]”  Injury, Black’s Law Dictionary 
(11th ed. 2019).  A takings claim seeks compensation for 
something the government is entitled to do; a taking is not a 
legal injury, but rather an entitlement to just compensation.  
See 26 Am. Jur. 2d Eminent Domain § 21 (2020) (“Within its own 
jurisdiction, each state possesses the sovereign power of eminent domain.”); 29A C.J.S. Eminent Domain § 2 (2020) (“Unless 
restricted by the constitution, a sovereign’s eminent domain powers are absolute and total.  Such powers can be denied or 
restricted only by fundamental law.  It cannot be delegated or restricted by contract.  It is superior to all property rights, 
and every owner of property holds it subject to the right or 
power of eminent domain.” (footnotes omitted)).   
   In Au, Plaintiff/Appellant claimed that she had bought 
a house based on Defendants’ alleged fraudulent representations 
that the house had not been subject to leakage.  The house was 
subsequently damaged by water leaks, and Plaintiff/Appellant sued for fraud and other claims.  In determining the appropriate 
statute of limitations for the fraud claim, we noted: 
Although the end result of the fraudulent representation 
was physical injury to appellant’ s tangible interest in 
property, wherein HRS § 657-7 would seemingly apply, we ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
24believe that the instant case falls within the purview of 
HRS § 657- 1(4).  The nature of this claim is not the 
physical injury to property, rather it is the making of the 
fraudulent representations concerning the condition of the 
home which induced appellant to purchase it. Since 
fraudulent representations are not governed by a specific 
limitations period, the general limitations period set 
forth in HRS § 657-1(4) applies.   
Au, 63 Haw. at 216– 17, 626 P.2d at 179; see also Higa, 55 Haw. at 
170-73, 517 P.2d at 4-6 (applying a six-year statute of
limitations under HRS § 675-1 to a legal malpractice claiminvolving “a non-physical injury to an intangible interest.”).
Here, too, although DW’s claims allege diminution in 
the value of their property, the true nature of the claim is not 
that the LUC physically injured property, but that the property 
was taken without just compensation.   
Moreover, “[v]irtually all cases having occasion to 
construe [HRS § 657-7] have done so in the context of claims for 
damages resulting from physical injury to persons or physical 
injury to tangible interests in property.”  Higa, 55 Haw. at 170 
n.5, 517 P.2d at 3 n.5 (collecting cases).  Because no “physical
injury to tangible interests in property” is involved in DW’s
claim, HRS § 657-7 does not apply.  Au, 63 Haw. at 216, 626 P.2d
at 178 –79 (citing Higa, 55 Haw. at 170 n.5, 517 P.2d at 3 n.5).
C. The Twenty-Year Statute of Limitations for Adverse
Possession Claims Does Not Apply
Although OCA appears to be correct that states often 
use the adverse possession statute of limitations for inverse***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
25condemnation claims, upon closer inspection of the sources 
cited, that rule is limited to claims arising from a physical 
invasion of land.  For example, OCA cites White Pine for the 
proposition that “the majority national rule is that when an 
inverse condemnation claim is not governed by a specific statute
of limitations, the adverse possession limitation period 
applies, not the ‘catch all.’”  Indeed, White Pine cited  
Frustuck v. City of Fairfax, 212 Cal. App. 2d 345, 374 (Cal. 
Dist. App. 1963); Difronzo v. Village of Port Sanilac, 419 
N.W.2d 756, 759 (Mich. Ct. App. 1988);  Krambeck v. City of 
Gretna, 254 N.W.2d 691, 695 (Neb. 1977); Brazos River Authority 
v. City of Graham, 354 S.W.2d 99, 109-110 (Tex. 1961); and  
Ackerman v. Port of Seattle, 348 P.2d 664, 667 (Wash. 1960), in  
which courts applied the adverse possession statute of  
limitations rather than the catch-all.  White Pine, 801 P.2d at  
1371.  But the White Pine opinion further cited an A.L.R.  
article, which also stated:14 
Although quite possibly the term “ inverse condemnation” is 
applied even more frequently to actions for the recovery of 
consequential damages to land resulting from the action of 
a governmental unit or public utility not taking actual, direct, permanent possession of the land affected than it 
is to cases of recovery of compensation for a direct 
appropriation, the scope of the annotation is confined to 
the latter type of action.   
14It appears that Michigan now applies the catch- all statute of 
limitations to takings claims.  Hart, 331 N.W.2d 
at 444-45 (applying six- year 
catch-all statute of limitations to takings claim). ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
26Charles C. Marvel, Annotation, State Statute of Limitations 
Applicable to Inverse Condemnation or Similar Proceedings by 
Landowner to Obtain Compensation for Direct Appropriation of 
Land Without the Institution or Conclusion of Formal Proceedings 
Against Specific Owner, 26 A.L.R.4th 68 n.3 (1983) (emphasis 
added).
Thus, White Pine and the accompanying authority 
stating that the majority rule applies the adverse possession 
limitation period refers only to physical takings, not to 
regulatory takings.   Indeed, “[w]hile a statute of limitations 
for an action arising out of title to real property applies to 
inverse condemnation actions based on a physical taking, it does 
not apply to a regulatory takings claim based on enactment of a 
zoning ordinance[.]”  27 Am. Jur. 2d Eminent Domain § 733 (2020) 
(emphasis added); see also Reitsma v. Pascoag Reservoir & Dam, 
LLC, 774 A.2d 826, 838 (R.I. 2001) (noting that adverse 
possession statutes of limitation have been applied to physical 
takings claims).  We agree with the United States Supreme 
Court’s observation that the “longstanding distinction between 
acquisitions of property for public use, on the one hand, and 
regulations prohibiting private uses, on the other, makes it15
15The cases cited to support the court’s conclusion in White Pine 
similarly deal with physical, rather than regulatory, takings.  The exception 
is Ackerman, in which plaintiffs challenged the diminution in value of their 
property due to airplane noise.  Ackerman, 348 P.2d at 665- 66. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
27inappropriate to treat cases involving physical takings as 
controlling precedents for the evaluation of a claim that there 
has been a ‘regulatory taking[.]’”  Tahoe-Sierra Pres. Council, 
Inc. v. Tahoe Reg’l Planning Agency, 535 U.S. 302, 323 (2002) (footnote omitted).  For this reason, we find OCA’s position 
unpersuasive.   
 
D. The Catch-All Statute of Limitations of HRS § 657-1(4)
Applies to Regulatory Takings Claims 
As other statutes of limitations do not apply, the 
catch-all statute of limitations in HRS § 657-1 provides the 
correct limitation period to apply to DW’s regulatory takings 
claim.  HRS § 657-1(4) provides: 
The following actions shall be commenced within six 
years next after the cause of action accrued, and not 
after: 
. . . . 
(4) Personal actions of any nature whatsoevernot specifically covered by the laws of the
State.
The statute does not define “personal actions.”  
However, a “personal action,” also referred to as an “action in 
personam,” is “[a]n action in which the named defendant is a 
natural or legal person.”  Action in personam, Black’s Law  
Dictionary  (11th ed. 2019).  Furthermore, “[a]n action is in 
personam where the judgment will impose a personal liability or 
obligation and does not affect the nature of the parties’ 
interest in property.”  1 Am. Jur. 2d Actions  § 28 (2020). ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
28Although a takings claim necessarily involves property, the
 
action is personal because the Takings Clause “is designed to 
secure compensation, not to limit governmental interference with 
property rights.”  26 Am. Jur. 2d Eminent Domain § 3 (2020).  A takings claim brought against the State – a legal person – in 
order to impose a financial obligation is therefore a personal 
action within the meaning of HRS § 657-1(4).  See Hart, 331 
N.W.2d at 444-45 (conceptualizing inverse condemnation claims as 
personal actions).  
16  
In Au, we noted that a “personal action” has included: 
an action brought for the recovery of personal property, 
for the enforcement of a contract or to recover for its 
breach, or for the recovery of damages for the commission 
of an injury to the person or property; an action for the 
recovery of a debt, or damages from the breach of contract, 
or for a specific personal chattel, or for the satisfaction in damages for injury to the person or property. (Footnotes 
omitted.) 
63 Haw. at 217, 626 P.2d at 179 (citations omitted).
Although the list of causes of action set forth in Au 
does not include an action seeking compensation for a taking 
under the Hawai ‘i Constitution, Au’s list also does not purport
16When faced with determining the meaning of personal action under 
a similar general statute of limitations, the Supreme Court of Michigan 
concluded that “personal action” included inverse condemnation claims.  
Hart, 
331 N.W.2d at 444- 45.  The Hart court reasoned: “As the plaintiffs are not 
seeking recovery of their lands but compensation for a [regulatory] taking by the sovereign, this cause of action may be logically conceptualized as a 
personal action which arises in relation to a former interest in real property.”  Id.  The court therefore concluded that Michigan’s general six-
year statute of limitations statute applies to inverse condemnation claims.  
Id. at 445. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
29to be exhaustive.  Indeed, the claim at issue in Au was 
fraudulent representation; notwithstanding that the words 
“fraudulent representation” are absent from the definition of 
personal action, the Au court held that HRS § 657-1(4) applied.
Id.   17
The LUC’s argument that claims against it are exempt 
from HRS § 657-1 because it is a statute of general 
applicability is unavailing.  First, where a statute “does not 
create a novel claim for relief, but merely establishes the 
circumstances under which” a party can recover damages, the 
State is subject to the statute even absent an express waiver of 
sovereign immunity.  Fought & Co., Inc. v. Steel Eng’g & 
Erection, Inc., 87 Hawai ‘i 37, 56, 951 P.2d 487, 506 (1998) 
(holding that the State was subject to a statute allowing 
prevailing parties to recover costs of suit).  The principle 
that individuals generally cannot sue the sovereign for 
substantive legal violations does not mean that a statute of 
limitations – part of the process of litigation – does not apply 
when the State is subject to suit pursuant to some other 
statute.  To conclude that statutes of limitation that do not 
17The plain text of HRS § 657- 1(4), by extending to “[p] ersonal 
actions of any nature whatsoever,” evinces the legislature’s intent that the 
statute apply broadly.  (Emphasis added.)  Thus, we think reading Au as 
inclusive, rather than exclusive, is also consistent with the purpose and 
spirit of the statute. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
30explicitly apply to the State can never be invoked to govern a 
suit against the State could just as easily lead to the rule 
that there is no statute of limitations upon a regulatory 
takings claim at all.  HRS § 661-5 does not apply to 
constitutional claims, as set forth above, and there is no other 
statute of limitations that mentions the State.   
Second, HRS § 657-1.5 (1991) exempts claims brought by  
the State  from the statutes of limitation set forth in the 
chapter.   There is no parallel exemption for claims brought 
against the State.  This suggests that actions brought against 
the State can fall under the limitations periods set forth in 
the chapter if the action meets the relevant subject matter 
requirements.  We also note that Maryland, Michigan, 
Mississippi, Vermont, and Wyoming have held that catch-all 
statutes of limitation apply to regulatory takings claims.  See 
Harford Cty. v. Md. Reclamation Assocs., Inc., 213 A.3d 757, 778 
(Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2019); Hart, 331 N.W.2d at 444-45; City of  
Tupelo v. O’Callaghan, 208 So. 3d 556, 568 (Miss. 2017); Dep’t  
of Forests, Parks & Recreation v. Town of Ludlow Zoning Bd., 869 
A.2d 603, 607-08 (Vt. 2004); Smith v. Bd. of Cty. Comm’rs of18
18HRS § 657- 1.5 states, “No limitation of actions provided for 
under this or any other chapter shall apply to bar the institution or 
maintenance of any action by or on behalf of the State and its agencies[.]” 
(emphasis added).

IV. CONCLUSION 
  For the foregoing reasons, we respond to the certified 
question as follows: the statute of limitations for a takings 
claim under the Hawai‘ i Constitution is six years pursuant to HRS 
§ 657-1(4).
