2 CERTIFIED QUESTION FROM THE 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF HAWAIʻI 
 
SEPTEMBER 3, 2021 
 
RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, AND WILSON, JJ., 
AND CIRCUIT JUDGE TONAKI, ASSIGNED BY REASON OF VACANCY 
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAYAMA, J. 
 
The United States District Court for the District of 
Hawaiʻi (District Court) has asked this court to determine:  
When (a)  a borrower has indisputably defaulted on a 
mortgage for real property, (b)  a lender has conducted a 
nonjudicial foreclosure sale but has not strictly complied 
with the requirements governing such sales, and (c)  the 
borrower sues the lender over that noncompliance after the 
foreclosure sale and, if the property was purchased at 
foreclosure by the lender, afte r any subsequent sale to a 
third-party purchaser, may the borrower establish the 
requisite harm for liability purposes under the law of 
wrongful foreclosure and/or section 480 -2 of Hawaiʻi Revised 
Statutes by demonstrating the loss of title, possession , 
and/or investments in the property without regard to the 
effect of the mortgage on those i tems? 
Phrased differently, the District Court asks:  
Is the effect of the mortgage considered only as a matter 
of setoff that a lender has the burden of proving after th e 
borrower establishes the amount of the borrower’s damages, 
or does a borrower with no preforeclosure rights in 
property except as encumbered by a mortgage bear the burden 
of accounting for the effect of the mortgage in 
establishing the element of harm in  the liability case?  
We hold that a borrower bears the burden of accounting 
for the effect of a mortgage when establishing the element of 
harm in the liability case  for a wrongful foreclosure or unfair 
or deceptive acts or practices case . *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
3 I. BACKGROUND  
A. Factual Background  
This certified question arises from three putative 
class actions: Lionel Lima , Jr., et al. v. Deutsche Bank 
National Trust Company , Civ. No. 12 -00509 SOM -WRP (D. Haw. filed 
Sept. 10, 2012); Evelyn Jane Gibo, et al. v. U.S. Bank National 
Association, Civ. No. 12 -00514 SOM -WRP (D. Haw. filed Sept. 12, 
2012); and David Emory Bald, et al. v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. , 
Civ. No. 13 -00135 SOM -RT (D. Haw. filed Mar. 20, 2013).  This 
opinion collectively refers to the plaintiffs in all cases as 
“Plaintiff Borrowers,” and the defendants in all cases as 
“Defendant Banks.”  
Each case shares roughly the same facts.  Each 
Plaintiff Borrower mortgage d real property to one of the 
Defendant Banks.  However, Plaintiff Borrowers defaulted on 
their mortgages.  The rele vant Defendant Bank conducted 
nonjudicial foreclosure sales of the mortgage d properties 
pursuant to Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) §  667-5.1  However, 
                     
1  HRS § 667-5 (Supp. 2008) (repealed 2012) provided in relevant part:  
 
Foreclosure under power of sale; notice; affidavit 
after sale.   (a) When a power of sale is contained in a 
mortgage, and where the mortgagee .  . . desires to 
foreclose under power of sale upon breach of a condition of 
the mortgage, the mortgagee .  . . shall be represented by 
an attorney who is licensed to practice la w in the State 
and is physically located in the State.  The attorney 
shall: 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
4                      
(1)  Give notice of the mortgagee’s .  . . intention 
to foreclose the mortgage and of the sale of 
the mortgaged property, by publication of the 
notice once in each of three success ive weeks 
(three publications), the last publication to 
be not less than fourteen days before the day 
of sale, in a newspaper having a general 
circulation in the county in which the 
mortgaged property lies; and  
 
(2)  Give any notices and do all acts as are  
authorized or required by the power contained 
in the mortgage.  
 
(b) Copies of the notice required under subsection 
(a) shall be:  
 
(1)  Filed with the state director of taxation; and  
 
(2)  Posted on the premises not less than twenty -one 
days before the day  of sale.  
 
(c) Upon the request of any person entitled to notice 
pursuant to this section and sections 667 -5.5 and 667 -6, 
the attorney [or] the mortgagee .  . . shall disclose to the 
requestor the following information:  
 
(1)  The amount to cure the default,  together with 
the estimated amount of the foreclosing 
mortgagee’s attorneys’ fees and costs, and all 
other fees and costs estimated to be incurred 
by the foreclosing mortgagee related to the 
default prior to the auction within five 
business days of the re quest; and  
 
(2)  The sale price of the mortgaged property once 
auctioned.  
 
(d) Any sale, of which notice has been given as 
aforesaid, may be postponed from time to time by public 
announcement made by the mortgagee .  . . .  Upon request 
made by any person w ho is entitled to notice pursuant to 
section 667 -5.5 or 667 -6, or this section, the mortgagee 
. . . shall provide the date and time of a postponed 
auction, or if the auction is canceled, information that 
the auction was cancelled.  The mortgagee within thi rty 
days after selling the property in pursuance of the power, 
shall file a copy of the notice of sale and the mortgagee’s 
affidavit, setting forth the mortgagee’s acts in the 
premises fully and particularly, in the bureau of 
conveyances.  
 
(e) The affidavi t and copy of the notice shall be 
recorded and indexed by the registrar, in the manner 
provided in chapter 501 or 502, as the case may be.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
5 Defendant Banks did not strictly comply with the procedural 
requirements  of HRS §  667-5.  For instance, Defendant Banks 
allegedly postponed some of the foreclosure auctions without 
publishing a notice.  The properties were then either sold to 
third parties during the foreclosure sales or purchased by the 
mortgage -holding Defendant Bank and reso ld to third  parties 
after the foreclosure sales.   
B. Procedural Background  
1. Federal District Court Proceedings  
Defendant Banks removed Plaintiff Borrowers’ suits to 
federal court.  Plaintiff  Borrowers allege that Defendant Banks’ 
nonjudicial foreclosure sales  violated (1)  HRS § 667-5 and 
(2) HRS § 480-2.2  In particular, Plaintiff Borrowers complained 
that Defendant Banks  
                     
 
(f) This section is inapplicable if the mortgagee is 
foreclosing on personal property only.  
2  HRS § 480-2 (2008) pr ovides in relevant part:  
 
Unfair competition, practices, declared unlawful.   
(a) Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive 
acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce 
are unlawful.  
 
. . . . 
 
(d) No person other than a consumer, the attorney 
general or the director of the office of consumer 
protection may bring an action based upon unfair or 
deceptive acts or practices declared unlawful by this 
section.  
 
. . . . 
 Additionally, HRS §  480-13 (2008) provides in relevant part:  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
6 a. Record[ed] and publish[ed] Notices of Sale that did not 
include a “description of the mortgaged property” (a)  as 
required by HRS Section 667-7(a)(1) (2008) and (b)  which 
was “sufficient to inform the public of the nature of the 
property to be offered for sale” and “calculated to 
interest purchase rs,” as required by Ulrich v. Sec. Inv. 
Co., 35 Haw. 158, 172 -73 (1939);  
 
b. Publish[ed] and/or post[ed] the Notice of Sale for less 
time than required by statute;  
 
c. S[old] the property despite having failed to send the 
borrower a notice of acceleration that gave the notice that 
the standard form mortgage required about the unconditional 
right the borrower had to bring a separate suit to stop the 
sale[;] 
 
d. Issu[ed] notices of sale that lacked a description of 
the property that would interest prospective buyers and/or 
comply with statute;  
 
e. Advertis[ed] the auctions of properties by “quitclaim 
deed” and/or without any covenants or warranties of title 
whatsoever;  
 
f. Postpon[ed] auctions so frequently that the substantial 
majority of sale dates advertised in the Class’s published 
notices of sale were not the actual auction dates;  
 
g. Postpon[ed] au ctions without publishing notices of the 
rescheduled auctions’ new dates and times;  
 
                     
 
Suits by persons injured; amount of recovery, 
injunctions.   . . . . 
 
(b) Any consumer who is injured by any unfair or 
deceptive act or practice forbidden or declared unlawful by 
section 480 -2: 
 
(1)  May sue for damages sustained by the consumer, 
and, if the judg ment is for the plaintiff, the 
plaintiff shall be awarded a sum not less than 
$1,000 or threefold damages by the plaintiff 
sustained, whichever sum is the greater, and 
reasonable attorney’s fees together with the 
costs of suit .  . . ; and 
 
(2)  May bring p roceedings to enjoin the unlawful 
practices, and if the decree is for the 
plaintiff, the plaintiff shall be awarded 
reasonable attorney’s fees together with the 
costs of suit.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
7 h. Chang[ed] the location of the auction without publishing 
the new location; and  
 
i. Include[ed] as a term of sale that time was of the 
essence and that successful bidder s were expected to close 
their sales within thirty days of their auctions, when in 
fact such sales either never, or almost never, closed 
within the specific timeframe.  
In 2019, Defendant Banks moved for summary judgment on 
Plaintiff Borrowers’ claims, asse rting, inter alia , that 
Plaintiff Borrowers could not prevail because they could not 
prove the damages, or harm, element of either of their claims.  
In particular, Defendant Banks contended that Plaintiff 
Borrowers would not be able to show that they were harmed, or 
suffered any damages, because Plaintiff Borrowers did not show 
that (1)  they could have made their loans current, (2)  their 
properties could have sold at a higher price but for Defendant 
Banks’ alleged actions, or (3)  their properties were worth  more 
than their remaining mortgage debts.   
Plaintiff Borrowers opposed Defendant Banks’ motions, 
responding that it was sufficient for Plaintiff Borrowers to 
show that they lost title, possession, and any investments in 
their properties to establish thei r damages to survive a motion 
for summary judgment .  Plaintiff Borrowers asserted the y did not 
need to factor in their remaining mortgage  debts because the 
debts we re only relevant as a set off Defendant Banks must 
prove.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
8 On April 30, 2019, the District Court hear d argument 
on Defendant Banks’ motions for summary judgment.  Following the 
hearing, the District Court asked the parties to brief the 
question of whether the District Court should certify a question 
to this court regarding the damages issue.   
On May 16, 2019, the District Court issued an order 
certifying the a bove question to this court.   
2. Supreme Court Proceedings  
On June 13, 2019, this court accepted the certified 
question without determining whether it would answer the 
question.  Th is court simultaneously ordered briefing on the 
certified question from the parties.   
i. Defendant Banks’ Opening Briefs  
Defendant Banks point out that plaintiff s seeking 
relief under a wrongful foreclosure or unfair or deceptive acts 
or practices (UDAP) claim bears t he burden of proving their 
damages.  Defendant Banks argue that Plaintiff Borrowers must 
prove their net damages, as opposed to gross damages, in order 
to establish Defendant Banks’ liability.  Defendant Banks base 
this argument on the premise that the pur pose of damages for 
wrongful foreclosure and UDAP claims is to restore plaintiff s to 
the position they would have been in had they not been injured.  
Thus, Defendant Banks claim that Plaintiff Borrowers must factor 
in their remaining mortgage debts when proving  their damages.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
9 Defendant Banks additionally note that the remaining mortga ge 
debts are significant, ranging from $169,000 to $945,000.   
ii. Plaintiff Borrowers’ Answering Briefs  
Plaintiff Borrowers do not directly address the 
District Court’s certified question.  At best, Plaintiff 
Borrowers suggest that the extent of their harm is irrelevant.  
The represented3 Plaintiff Borrowers assert, in the alternative, 
that Defendant Banks b ear the burden of proof to demonstrate the 
impact of the remaining mortgage debt on Plaintiff Borrowers’ 
damages.  Plaintiff Borrowers additionally contend that even if 
they must prove their net damages and account for their 
remaining mortgage debt, their claims will survive summary 
judgment because they are entitled to nominal and punitive 
damages; as well as recovery of interest, loss of use  payments , 
and past payments.   
The represented Plaintiff Borrowers focus their 
attention instead on two different q uestions: “(1)  what items of 
damages are recoverable, either in restitution, tort, or under 
the consumer statute, for the unlawful disposition of real 
property using a power of sale, and (2)  how is each item 
                     
3  Plaintiff Borrowers Lionel Lima, Jr. and Barbara Ann Delizo -Lima 
(collectivel y, the Limas) terminated their counsel around November 2019.  
This court granted the Limas pro se status.   
Liberally construing the Limas’ separate answering brief, the Limas do 
not present any argument responsive to the certified question.  This opinion 
therefore focuses on the represented Plaintiff Borrowers’ arguments.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
10 measured?”  Using this framework, Plaintiff Borr owers argue that 
they are entitled to restitution based on Defendant Banks’ 
“unlawfully obtained benefits.”  In particular, Plaintiff 
Borrowers argue that the alleged wrongful foreclosures 
constituted intentional torts.  They consequently reason that 
the fact that they defaulted on their loans is irrelevant.  
Plaintiff Borrowers  instead aver that they are entitled to 
whatever benefits Defendant Banks received from wrongfully 
foreclosing on their properties.   
Plaintiff Borrowers further assert that their 
restitution damages should include (1)  the value for which 
Defendant Banks sold or resold the foreclosed properties, 
(2) interest for the loss of use of the foreclosed properties, 
and (3) any value Plaintiff Borrowers paid on the mortgages.  
Moreover, Plaint iff Borrowers argue that Defendant Banks cannot 
offset the restitution damages they owe Plaintiff Borrowers by 
the remaining mortgage debts because this would merely 
incentivize Defendant Banks to wrongfully foreclose other 
properties.    
iii.  Defendant Banks’ R eply Briefs  
Defendant Banks reply that this court should decline 
to address Plaintiff Borrowers’ alternative questions.  
Defendant Banks counter that, by raising the alternative 
questions, Plaintiff Borrowers ask this court to grant them an *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
11 unjustified and  unprecedented windfall.  As an example, 
Defendant Bank Wells Fargo, N.A. point s out that Plaintiff 
Borrowers Mike and Tham Myers  (collectively, the Myers)  owed 
Wells Fargo , N.A. over $100,000 more than their property was 
worth at the time of the nonjudici al foreclosure sale.  However, 
using Plaintiff Borrowers’ requested restitution formula  would 
grant the Myers over $1,771,000 in damages simply because Wells 
Fargo did not strictly comply with certain procedural 
requirements  when conducting the nonjudicial  foreclosure sales .   
Defendant Banks further respond that, in any event, 
they did not realize any unjustified benefit that would entitle 
Plaintiff Borrowers to restitution because (1)  Defendant Banks 
were entitled to foreclose on the properties and (2)  Defendant 
Banks suffered a loss when they sold or resold the properties 
for less than the relevant mortgage’s value.   
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW  
A. Certified Question  
“[T]he supreme court shall have jurisdiction and 
powers .  . . [t]o answer, in its discretion .  . . any question 
or proposition of law certified to it by a federal district or 
appellate court if the supreme court shall so provide by 
rule[.]”  HRS §  602-5(a)(2) (2016).  
When a federal district or appellate court certifies to the 
Hawaiʻi Supreme Court that th ere is involved in any 
proceeding before it a question concerning the law of 
Hawaiʻi that is determinative of the cause and that there is *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
12 no clear controlling precedent in the Hawaiʻi judicial 
decisions, the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court may answer the 
certified q uestion by written opinion.  
Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 13(a) (2000).  
“An issue of law presented by certified question is 
reviewed by this court de novo under the right/wrong standard of 
review.”  Miller v. Hartford Life Ins. Co. , 126 Hawaiʻi 165, 173, 
268 P.3d 418, 426 (2011) (citation omitted).  
III.  DISCUSSION  
A. The Certified Question  
As a preliminary matter, this court clarifies the 
issue this opinion shall address.  This court may answer a 
certified question (1)  that concerns the law of Hawaiʻi, (2) that 
is determinative of the cause, and (3)  for which there is no 
clear controlling Hawaiʻi precedent.  See HRAP Rule 13(a).  The 
parties do not dispute that the certified question concerns the 
law of Hawaiʻi or that there is no clear controll ing state 
precedent on the matter.  However, Plaintiff Borrowers make a 
perfunctory claim that the certified question is not 
determinative of the cause, implying that this court should not 
answer the certified question.  Nevertheless, Plaintiff 
Borrowers a sk this court to resolve two alternative questions.   
Thus, this court must first determine whether it may 
address either the District Court’s question or Plaintiff 
Borrowers’ questions.  See HRAP Rule 13(a).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
13 This court concludes it may answer the certifie d 
question because an answer will be determinative of the cause.  
The court respectfully declines Plaintiff Borrowers’ invitation 
to address additional, non-dispositive issues.  
1. It is appropriate for the court to resolve the 
question certified by the District Court. 
Again, the District Court asked this court to 
determine:  
Is the effect of the mortgage considered only as a matter 
of setoff that a lender has the burden of proving after the 
borrower establishes the amount of the borrower’s damages, 
or does a bo rrower with no preforeclosure rights in 
property except as encumbered by a mortgage bear the burden 
of accounting for the effect of the mortgage in 
establishing the element of harm in the liability case?  
The District Court reasoned that this question is “d eterminative 
of the cause” because it will likely grant summary judgment in 
favor of Defendant Banks if Plaintiff Borrowers must account for 
their mortgage debts.  The District Court explained that this is 
because “Plaintiff Borrowers’ only evidence of har m relates to 
the loss of title, possession, and investments in the properties 
without regard to any mortgage.”   
Plaintiff Borrowers disagree.  According to Plaintiff 
Borrowers, their claims will survive Defendant Banks’ motions 
for summary judgment because they are also entitled to nominal 
damages; punitive damages; and the recovery of interest, loss of 
use payments , and past payments.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
14 We agree with the District Court’s assessment.  
Plaintiff Borrowers must be able to establish a prima facie case 
for compensatory damages, factoring in their pre -nonjudicial 
foreclosure positions, to survive Defendant Banks’ motions for 
summary judgment.  Thus, the District Court’s question is 
determinative of the cause if Plaintiff Borrowers fail to make 
such a case.  
It is axiomatic that plaintiff s bear the burden of 
establishing all necessary elements for their claims.  Kelly v. 
1250 Oceanside Partners , 111 Hawaiʻi 205, 233, 140 P.3d 985, 1013 
(2006).  Where, as here, a defendant has moved for summary 
judgment,  
summary judgment [in favor of the movant] is proper when 
the [non -movant plaintiff]  
 
Fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the 
existence of an element essential to [the 
plaintiff’s] case, and on which [the plaintiff] will 
bear the burden of proof at t rial.  In such a 
situation, there can be no genuine issue as to any 
material fact, since a complete failure of proof 
concerning an essential element of the [plaintiff’s] 
case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.  
The [defendant] is entitled to j udgment as a matter 
of law because the [plaintiff] has failed to make a 
sufficient showing on an essential element of her 
case with respect to which she has the burden of 
proof. 
Exotics Hawaii -Kona, Inc. v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. , 116 
Hawaiʻi 277, 302, 172 P.3d 1021, 1046 (2007) (quoting Hall v. 
State, 7 Haw. App. 274, 284, 75 6 P.2d 1048, 1055 (1988))  
(emphasis omitted) . *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
15 Plaintiff Borrowers must establish an element of 
damages for each of their claims .  Here, Plaintiff Borrowers 
raised two claims in the underlying proceedings: a wrongful 
foreclosure claim and a UDAP claim.  In order to establish a 
prima facie case that Defendant Banks are liable for wrongful 
foreclosure, Plaintiff Borrowers must establish “(1)  a legal 
duty owed to the mortgagor by the  foreclosing party; (2)  a 
breach of that duty; (3)  a causal connection between the breach 
of that duty and the injury sustained; and (4)  damages.”  Bank 
of America, N.A. v. Reyes -Toledo, 143 Hawaiʻi 249, 264 n.12, 428 
P.3d 761, 776 n.12 (2018).  To establish a prima facie case for 
a UDAP claim, Plaintiff Borrowers must establish “(1)  either 
that the defendant violated the UDAP statute (or that its 
actions are deemed to violate the UDAP statute by an other 
statute), (2)  that the consumer was injured as a result of the 
violation, and (3)  the amount of damages sustained as a result 
of the UDAP violation.”  Kawakami v. Kahala Hotel Investors, 
LLC, 142 Hawaiʻi 507, 519, 421 P.3d 1277, 12 89 (2018) (citation s 
omitted).  Thus, in order to survive a motion for summary 
judgment on their claims, Plaintiff Borrowers must adduce 
evidence  that they have suffered damages.  See Exotics Hawaii -
Kona, 116 Hawaiʻi at 302, 172 P.3d at 1046.  
Plaintiff Borrowers must make a case for compensatory 
damages.   Plaintiff Borrowers acknowledge that their claims *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
16 arise in tort.  Hawaiʻi law recognizes three categories of 
damages in tort actions: (1)  compensatory damages, (2)  punitive 
damages, and (3)  nominal damages.  Zanakis-Pico v. Cutter Dodge, 
Inc., 98 Hawaiʻi 309, 327, 47 P.3d 1222, 1240 (2002) (Acoba, J., 
concurring).  “Compensatory damages seek to ‘compensate the 
injured party for the injury sustained,’ in hopes of 
‘restor[ing] a plaintiff to his or her position prior to the 
tortious act[.]”  Bynum v Magno , 106 Hawaiʻi 81, 85, 101 P.3d 
1149, 1153 (2004) (quoting Kuhnert v. Allison , 76 Hawaiʻi 39, 44, 
868 P.2d 457, 462 (1994); Zanakis-Pico, 98 Hawaiʻi at 327, 47 
P.3d at 1240 (Acoba, J., concurring)).   
In contrast to compensatory damages, nominal damages 
are “‘a small and trivial sum awarded for a technical injury due 
to a violation of some legal right and as a consequence of which 
some damages must be awarded to determine the right.”  Zanakis-
Pico, 98 Hawaiʻi at 327, 47 P.3d at 12 40 (Acoba, J., concurring) 
(quoting Van Poole v. Nippu Jiji Co. , 34 Haw. 354, 360 (1937)).  
Lastly, punitive damages are awarded “to punish the 
defendant, rather than to compensate the plaintiff.”  Id. at 
330, 47 P.3d at 1243  (Acoba, J., concurring) .  Howev er, punitive 
damages generally must be supported by an award of nominal or 
compensatory damages.  See id. (“nominal damages may be the 
basis for punitive damages in . . . tort actions ”) (emphasis *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
17 added); Masaki v. General Motors Corp. , 71 Haw. 1, 6, 780 P. 2d 
566, 570 (1989) (“Punitive or exemplary damages are generally 
defined as those damages assessed in addition to  compensatory 
damages for the purpose of punishing the defendant for 
aggravated or outrageous misconduct and to deter the defendant 
and others from similar conduct in the future.”) (emphasis 
added). 
Contrary to Plaintiff Borrowers’ assertion, Plaintiff 
Borrowers cannot rely on nominal damages to withstand a motion 
for summary judgment.  This court has noted that where a tort 
claim requires a plai ntiff to “separately establish damages,” 
the plaintiff cannot simply infer damages based upon the alleged 
tort –– i.e., nominal damages.  Weinberg v. Mauch , 78 Hawaiʻi 40, 
50, 890 P.2d 277, 287 (1995).  This is because a crucial 
component of such a claim i s that “the plaintiff suffer[ed] 
damages as a consequence of the defendant’s conduct [.]”  Id. 
(quoting Chemawa Country Golf, Inc. v. Wnuk , 402 N.E.2d 1069, 
1072-73 (Mass. App. 1980)).  As previously noted, Plaintiff 
Borrowers must establish damages as an element of both their 
wrongful foreclosure and UDAP claims.  See Reyes-Toledo, 143 
Hawaiʻi at 264 n.12, 428 P.3d at 776 n.12; Kawakami , 142 Hawaiʻi 
at 519, 421 P.3d at 12 89.  Given that the se claims require 
Plaintiff Borrowers to “suffer damages as a consequence of the 
[Defendant Banks’] conduct,” a claim for nominal damages is not *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
18 sufficient to preserve Plaintiff Borrowers’ claims.  See 
Weinberg , 78 Hawaiʻi at 50, 890 P.2d at 28 7.  Plaintiff Borrowers 
consequently must establish compensatory damages to salvage 
their claims.  See id. 
Nor does  Plaintiff Borrowers’ request that the 
District Court impose punitive damages alleviate  their burden to 
prove compensatory damages .  Given th at Plaintiff Borrowers may 
not rely on a claim for nominal damages to survive summary 
judgment, Plaintiff Borrowers must provide an alternative basis 
for a punitive damages award.  See Zanakis-Pico, 98 Hawaiʻi at 
330, 47 P.3d at 1243 (Acoba, J., concurring ); Masaki, 71 Haw. at 
6, 780 P.2d at 570.  In other words, Plaintiff Borrowers must 
show that they are entitled to compensatory damages –– the only 
other independent source of damages –– before they may receive 
punitive damages.4 
Finally, Plaintiff Borrowe rs’ identified items for 
recovery –– interest, loss of use  payments , and past payments –– 
are not sufficient to establish their damages.  Again, 
compensatory damages are intended to restore a plaintiff to the 
                     
4  This court notes that Plaintiff Borrowers are statutorily precluded 
from receiving punitive damages for their UDAP claim.  Zanakis-Pico, 98 
Hawaiʻi at 319, 47 P.3d at 1232 (“HRS §  480-13(b) enumerates the specific 
damages that a consumer may recover under this chapter .  . . and makes no 
provision for punitive damages.”).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
19 position they would have been in prior to the a lleged tortious 
act.  Bynum, 106 Hawaiʻi at 85, 101 P.3d at 1153.   
The law divides such “damages into two broad categories –
general and special.”   Ellis v. Crockett , 51 Haw. 45, 50, 
451 P.2d 814, 819 (1969).  General damages “encompass all 
the damages whic h naturally and necessarily result from a 
legal wrong done[,]” id., and include such items as “pain 
and suffering, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment which 
cannot be measured definit ively in monetary terms.”  Dunbar 
v. Thompson , 79 Hawaiʻi 306, 315, 901 P.2d 1285, 1294 (App. 
1995) (citation omitted).  Special damages are “the natural 
but not the necessary result of an alleged wrong[,]” Ellis, 
51 Haw. at 50, 451 P.2d at 819, and are “often considered 
to be synonymous with pecuniary loss and include such it ems 
as medical and hospital expenses, loss of earnings, and 
diminished capacity.”  Dunbar, 79 Hawaiʻi at 315, 901 P.2d 
at 1294.  
Id.  In light of the purpose of compensatory damages, Plaintiff 
Borrowers must make a prima facie case that their requested 
damages will restore them to their pre -tort position to survive 
summary judgment.  See id.; Exotics Hawaii -Kona, 116 Hawaiʻi at 
302, 172 P.3d at 1046.  In this context, the items that 
Plaintiff Borrowers identified  constitute , at best,  pecuniary 
losses that form a mere component of their compensatory damages.  
See Bynum, 106 Hawaiʻi at 85, 101 P.3d at 1153.  As discussed in 
greater detail  below, Plaintiff Borrowers consequently must 
still factor in their pre -nonjudicial foreclosure statuses to 
demonstrate their compensatory damages.  Infra at 22-24. 
An answer requiring Plaintiff Borrowers to account for 
their remaining mortgage debts would  be “dispositive of the 
cause.”  Given that Plaintiff Borrowers must establish 
compensatory damages that will restore them to their pre -tort *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
20 positions to survive summary judgment, Plaintiff Borrowers’ 
failure to account for their pre -tort positions preclud es the 
satisfaction of the damages elements of their claims.  See 
Bynum, 106 Hawaiʻi at 85, 101 P.3d at 1153.   Consequently, an 
answer to the question certified by the District Court would be 
“dispositive of the cause” when Plaintiff Borrowers have only 
provided evidence of a portion of their compensatory damages.  
Exotics Hawaii -Kona, 116 Hawaiʻi at 302, 172 P.3d at 1046; see 
also HRAP Rule 13(a).  
This court may therefore address the question 
certified by the District Court. 
2. This court declines to address Plaintiff Borrowers’ 
alternative questions.  
In contrast, this court notes that it would be 
inappropriate to resolve Plaintiff Borrowers’ alternative 
questions.  Plaintiff Borrowers ask this court to address 
“(1) what items of damages are recoverable, eithe r in 
restitution, tort, or under the consumer statute, for the 
unlawful disposition of real property using a power of sale, and 
(2) how is each item measured[.]”  However, Plaintiff Borrowers 
do not contend that a resolution to either of their alternative 
questions would be “determinative of the cause.”  See HRAP Rule 
13(a).  In fact, Plaintiff Borrowers’ second question 
acknowledges that any resolution this court could provide would *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
21 require further fact -finding.  Specifically, Plaintiff Borrowers 
would leave for the District Court the actual measurement of any 
recoverable damages.  Accordingly, this court declines to 
reformulate the certified question to conform to Plaintiff 
Borrowers’ request and to answer Plaintiff Borrowers’ 
alternative questions.  Matsuura v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & 
Co., 102 Hawaiʻi 149, 168, 73 P.3d 687, 706 (2003).  
B. Plaintiff Borrowers must account for their mortgage debts 
when establishing harm.  
Having determined that this court may address the 
question c ertified by the District Court, we turn to the 
question’s merits.  
For the following reasons, this court concludes that 
Plaintiff Borrowers may not establish the damages element s of 
their wrongful foreclosure or UDAP claims without accounting for 
their rema ining mortgage debts.  
1. Plaintiff Borrowers bear the burden of establishing 
their damages.  
Plaintiff s bear the burden of establishing all 
necessary elements for their claims.  Kelly, 111 Hawaiʻi at 233, 
140 P.3d at 1013.  This remains the case when a plaintiff 
opposes a motion for summary judgment.  Exotics Hawaii -Kona, 116 
Hawaiʻi at 302, 172 P.3d at 1046.  In these cases, the common 
element between Plaintiff Borrowers’ wrongful foreclosure and  
UDAP claims is compensatory damages.  Reyes Toledo , 143 Hawaiʻi *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
22 at 264 n.12, 428 P.3d at 776 n.12; Kawakami , 142 Hawaiʻi at 519, 
421 P.3d at 12 89.  Moreover, “[i]t is well -settled that all tort 
claims require that damages be proven with reasonable 
certainty.”  Exotics Hawaii -Kona, 116 Hawaiʻi at 292, 172 P.3d at 
1036.  Consequently, Plaintiff Borrowers –– not Defendant Banks 
–– bear the burden of establishing their damages with reasonable 
certainty.  See id. 
2. In establishing damages, Plaintiff Borrowers mus t 
account for the value of their mortgages.  
The fact that Plaintiff Borrowers must show 
compensatory damages places the onus on Plaintiff Borrowers to 
account for their mortgage debts.  As detailed above, Plaintiff 
Borrowers must establish compensatory dam ages to satisfy the 
damages elements of their wrongful foreclosure and UDAP claims.  
Supra at 14-18.  The purpose of compensatory damages is “‘to 
recompense a tort victim for the value of the loss 
sustained[.]’”  Zanakis-Pico, 98 Hawaiʻi at 327, 47 P.3d at  1240 
(Acoba, J., concurring) (quoting 1 Minzer, et al., Damages in 
Tort Actions , § 3.01 (Matthew Bender 1996)).  Therefore, “ ‘the 
general rule in measuring damages is to give a sum of money to 
the person wrong ed which as nearly as possible, will restore h im 
[or her] to the position he [or she] would be in if the wrong 
had not been committed. ’”  Tabieros v. Clark Equip . Co., 85 
Hawaiʻi 336, 389, 944 P.2d 1279, 1332 (1997) (quoting Nobriga v. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
23 Raybestos -Manhattan, Inc. , 67 Haw. 157, 162, 683 P.2d 389, 393 
(1984)) (alterations in Tabieros ).  In light of the purpose of 
compensatory damages, Plaintiff Borrowers must show that the 
damages they seek “will restore [them] to the position [they] 
would be in if the wrong had not  been committed.”  See id. 
In these cases, the tortious acts Plaintiff Borrowers 
challenge are Defendant Banks’ nonjudicial foreclosure sales of 
their properties.  Plaintiff Borrowers concede that, prior to 
the nonjudicial foreclosure sales, their property  interests were 
encumbered by “standard -form mortgages” that they “could not 
repay.”  Under such circumstances, Plaintiff Borrowers’ mortgage 
debts are a key factor in determining their damages because the 
debts constitute a portion of their pre -tort posit ions.  See 
Tabieros , 85 Hawaiʻi at 389, 944 P.2d at 1332.  
Moreover, Plaintiff Borrowers’ burden to prove their 
damages with “reasonable certainty” militates in favor of 
requiring Plaintiff Borrowers to account for their remaining 
mortgage debts.  Plaintiff  Borrowers do not dispute  that the 
mortgage debts at issue ranged from approximately $1 69,000 to 
nearly $1,000,000 at the time of the nonjudicial foreclosure 
sales.  These are not insignificant sums.  Plaintiff Borrowers’ 
failure to account for such sums m akes it impossible for the 
trier of fact to determine what damages would restore Plaintiff *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
24 Borrowers to their pre -foreclosure positions .  Contra Tabieros , 
85 Hawaiʻi at 389, 944 P.2d at 1332.  
Using the Myers as an example,  the Myers owed 
$944,759.00 on the ir mortgage at the time of the applicable 
nonjudicial foreclosure sale.  Wells Fargo then sold the Myers’ 
property for $815,000.00.  Thus, the Myers must at least 
subtract $815,000.00 from the total amount of damages they seek  
in order to account for their  mortgage debt .5 
Plaintiff Borrowers nevertheless assert that  Defendant 
Banks should  bear the burden of proving “deductions”  during the 
damages phase.   Specifically , Plaintiff Borrowers contend that 
they should be allowed to disregard their remaining mortg age 
debts, and that it is instead up to Defendant Banks to prove any 
amounts that should be “deducted” from Plaintiff Borrowers ’ 
damages.   Plaintiff Borrowers base th is “deductions” response on 
a restitution theory  that Defendant Banks should not be unjust ly 
enriched .  Plaintiff Borrowers additionally cite Beneficial 
Hawaii, Inc. v. Kida , 96 Hawaiʻi 289, 30 P.3d 895 (2001), as 
                     
5  This court uses the lesser amount based on the assumption that Wells 
Fargo sought a deficiency judgment.  In this scenario, the Myers would have 
received a value of $815,000.00 from the foreclosure sale in the form of 
forgiven mortgage debt.  However, the Myers would still owe Wells Fargo 
$129,759.00  through a deficiency judgment.  
 
 In the event that Wells Fargo did n ot seek a deficiency judgment, the 
Myers would have received the full value of their remaining mortgage debt in 
the form of forgiven debt.  In such a case, the Myers would be required to 
offset their requested costs by the ir full mortgage debt of $944,759. 00. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
25 evidence that Defendant Banks bear the burden for accounting for 
Plaintiff Borrowers’ mortgage debts.   
This contention is unavailing.  First , Plaintiff 
Borrowers concede that their claims arise in tort.  Plaintiff 
Borrowers’ reliance on restitution theory is therefore 
inapposite  when tort damages are generally intended to make 
plaintiffs whole .  See Zanakis-Pico, 98 Hawaiʻi at 327, 47 P.3d 
at 1240 (Acoba, J., concurring) (discussing the damages 
available in tort actions).  
Second, Kida arose in a distinguishable procedural 
posture.  In that case , plaintiff Beneficial Hawaii, Inc. sought 
to foreclose on property owned by defenda nt Donald Muneo Kida.  
96 Hawaiʻi at 295-96, 30 P.3d at 901 -02.  In addressing whether 
Beneficial Hawaii, Inc. could seek equitable remedies, t his 
court explained  that Beneficial Hawaii, Inc.  was not entitled to 
any relief when it failed to satisfy its bur den of proving that  
it could enforce the note and mortgage .  See Kida, 96 Hawaii at 
315-16, 30 P.3d at 921 -22.  Kida therefore reinforces the 
longstanding precedent that a plaintiff must provide sufficient 
evidence to establish all necessary elements of t heir claims.  
See Kelly, 111 Hawaiʻi at 233, 140 P.3d at 1013.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
26 3. Santiago  confirms that Plaintiff Borrowers must 
account for their mortgage debts when establishing 
their compensatory damages.  
This court’s holding in Santiago  v. Tanaka , 137 Hawaiʻi 
137, 366 P.3d 612 (2016),  does not change this analysis.  The 
District Court identifies its “conundrum” as “how, if at all, 
the ‘out -of-pocket losses’ restitution analysis bears on whether 
a borrower can prove the harm element in the liability portion 
of a wrongful  foreclosure claim.”  In particular, the District 
Court reasons that “ Santiago  may suggest tha t any remaining 
mortgage debt be disregarded, and the investment value in the 
property be returned to borrowers without setoff.”   
Santiago  does not support this proposition .  There, 
Louis Santiago and Yong Santiago (together, the Santiagos) 
purchased a tavern from Ruth Tanaka (Tanaka) for $1 .3 million .  
Id. at 140, 366 P.3d at 615.  The Santiagos paid $800,000 in 
cash, and executed a mortgage to Tanaka for the rem aining 
$500,000.  Id.  During a dispute over sewer maintenance fees, 
the Santiagos temporarily withheld a mortgage payment.  Id. at 
144, 366 P.3d at 619.  In response, Tanaka accelerated the 
mortgage and initiated nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings .  Id.  
The Santiagos subsequently resumed their mortgage payments and  
ultimately  paid Tanaka some $585,161.60 on the mortgage.  Id. at 
144, 146 n.22, 366 P.3d at 619, 621 n.22.  Nevertheless, Tanaka 
completed the foreclosure  sale, resold the tavern to a third *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
27 party, and kept the approximately $1.4 million in payments from 
the Santiagos.  Id. at 146, 366 P.3d at 621.  Thus, in contrast 
to Plaintiff Borrowers who owed significant sums they could not 
repay on their mortgages, the Santiagos had effectively paid off 
their mortgage debt.   See id. at 158, 366 P.3d at 634.  In other 
words, the Santiagos had no remaining mortgage debt to 
disregard.  See id. 
In fact, Santiago  makes clear that courts must apply a 
set off in determining Plaintiff Borrowers’ injuries and 
damages.  This court applied the out -of-pocket rule to calculate 
the Santiagos’ damages.  Id. at 158-59, 366 P.3d at 63 3-34.  In 
doing so, we explained that, “[u]nder the out -of-pocket rule, 
‘the damages are the difference between the actual value of the 
property received and the price paid for the property, along 
with any special damages naturally and proximately cause d . . . 
, including expenses incurred in mitigating the damages. ”  Id. 
at 159, 366 P.3d at 634  (quoting B.F. Goodrich Co. v. Mesabi 
Tire Co. , 430 N.W.2d 180, 182 (Minn. 1988); citing 37 Am. Jur. 
2d Fraud and Deceit  § 434 (2013)).  
Notably, when determining out -of-pocket losses, the 
party seeking damages “is precluded from any recovery if the 
value of the property that he or she received in exchange equals 
or exceeds the value of the property parted with by him or her.”  
37 Am. Jur. 2d Fraud and Deceit  § 434.  Courts have long *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
28 recognized that this is because the party does not sustain any 
injury in such an equivalent or beneficial exchange.  See, e.g. , 
Stratton’s Independence v. Dines , 135 F. 449, 460 (8th Cir. 
1905).  Thus, Santiago  demonstrates that Plaintiff Borrowers’ 
“price paid” must be set off by the “actual value of the 
property received” when calculating damages.  See 137 Hawaiʻi at 
159, 366 P.3d at 634.  
Applying these rules to the present circumstances 
shows that Plaintiff Borrowers must account for their remaining 
mortgage debts when they establish their damages.  Although 
Plaintiff Borrowers did not receive any actual property, they 
nevertheless received significant value in the form of forgiven 
mortgage debts.6  This consti tutes the “actual value of the 
property received” by Plaintiff Borrowers.  Meanwhile, Plaintiff 
Borrowers’ “price paid for the property” consists of whatever 
mortgage payments they had made before the nonjudicial 
foreclosures as well as any other special d amages they can 
prove.  Under these circumstances, Santiago  establishes that 
Plaintiff Borrowers’ investments and special damages must be 
                     
6  As previously noted, the actual value received depends on whether the 
relevant Defendant Bank sought a deficiency judgment.  Supra at n.5.  If so, 
the applicable offset is limited to the amount by which the Plaintiff 
Borrower’s mortgage debt is redu ced.  If not, the applicable offset would be 
equal to the full amount of the Plaintiff Borrower’s mortgage debt.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
29 
offset by their mortgage debts.  See 137 Hawaiʻi at 159, 366 P.3d 
at 634. 
IV. CONCLUSION  
For the foregoing reasons, we ans wer the District 
Court’s certified question as follows: Under Hawaiʻi law, a 
borrower with no pre -foreclosure rights in property except as 
encumbered by a mortgage bears the burden of accounting for the 
effect of the mortgage in establishing the element of  harm.
