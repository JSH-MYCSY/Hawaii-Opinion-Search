Dkt. 42 OP*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
2 Under Hawaiʻ
i law, is a permissive user of an insured 
vehicle, whose connection to the insured vehicle is 
permission to use the vehicle to run errands and drive to 
work, entitled to uninsured motorist (UM) benefits under 
the chain -of-events test because he was injured by an 
uninsured motorist?  
 
We answer the certified question in the affirmative.  
The proper inquiry under the chain of events test in this case 
is whether a permissive user,  such as Mizuno,  has retained a 
“sufficient connection” to the insured vehicle.  Un der the chain 
of events test, Mizuno is entitled to UM benefits because he was 
a permissive user of the insured vehicle during the chain of 
events resulting in his injury caused by an uninsured motor 
vehicle. 
II.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
  Michael Mizuno (“Mizuno”) received permission from his 
girlfriend, Daryl- Jean S. Wong (“Wong”) , to use her vehicle to 
deliver the couple’s bills to the post office and to drive to 
his place of employment.  Unable to use his own vehicle that was 
undergoing repairs , Mizuno drove Wong’s vehicle to the post 
office to mail the couple’s bills.  He parked the vehicle across 
the street from the post office, walked across the street, and 
deposited the bills in a mailbox.  As he was walking back across 
the street to Wong’s vehicle, Mizuno was struck by an *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
3 unidentified driver,  causing injuries to his left leg, left arm, 
left wrist, and left hand.  
 1
  Mizuno received compensation for his injuries pursuant 
to his own automobile insurance policy (UM coverage) and also 
sought benefits under the terms of Wong’s UM policy.   
Wong held an Automobile Insurance Policy with State 
Farm for her 2007 Toyota Camry, affording “UM limits of 
$100,000.00 per person and $300,000.00 per accident[.]”  The UM 
policy provides that State Farm “will pay dam ages for bodily 
injury an insured is legally entitled to recover from the owner 
or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle.”  Her UM policy defines 
“insured” to include the named insured(s), resident relatives, 
and “any other person while . . . occupying, wit h a reasonable 
belief that he or she is entitled to do so[,] . . . [the 
insured’s] car[.]”  Wong’s policy defines “occupying” to mean 
“in, on, entering, or exiting [a vehicle covered by the State 
Farm policy] .”  State Farm argues that the policy’s occupanc y 
restriction for uninsured users, limiting the meaning of 
“occupying” to situations where the “other person” is “in, on, 
                     
1  Under Hawai‘i’s UM laws, an unidentified driver or a hit and run 
driver, like the one that struck Mizuno, is considered an uninsured motorist 
for the purposes of UM coverage.  Dawes v. First Ins. Co. of Haw., Ltd., 77 
Hawaiʻi 117, 122 -23, 883 P.2d 38, 44 -45 (1994) (quoting 8C Appleman § 5067.45, 
at 41-46 (1981)) (noting that Hawai‘i’s UM laws , HRS §§ 431:10 -213 and 
431:10C-301(b)(3) , are remedial in nature , “provid[ing] a remedy to the 
innocent victims of irresponsible motorists who may have no resources to 
satisfy the damages they cause” and “cover the situation of a wrongful or 
tortious act of an uninsured motorist or a hit and run driver, or that of 
another unknown motorist.”).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
4 entering, or exiting” the vehicle, excludes coverage for Mizuno. 
Under this interpretation of “occupancy” Mizuno is excluded from 
coverage because he was not “in, on, entering, or exiting” the 
insured vehicle at the time he was struck by the unidentified 
motorist.    
  State Farm filed a complaint for declaratory judgment 
in the United States District Court for the District of Hawai‘i, 
and received summary judgment in its favor in response to the 
question of whether Mizuno was “occupying” Wong’s vehicle at the 
time of the accident.  Mizuno appealed to the Ninth Circuit.  On 
appeal, Mizuno contends that the district court erred by 
granting summary judgment in favor of State Farm because he was 
entitled to UM coverage provided by Wong’s UM policy.  
Specifically, Mizuno argues that he was using the insured 
vehicle to deliver mail and due to an uninterrupted “chain of 
events” involving the insured vehicle, was injured.  In so 
doing, Mizuno relies upon the “chain  of events test”  articulated 
by this c ourt in Dawes v. First Ins. Co. of Haw., Ltd., 77 
Hawaiʻi 117, 122-23, 883 P.2d 38, 43- 44 (1994).   
  Before the Ninth Circuit and this court, State Farm 
contends that Mizuno was not a covered person under Wong’s 
policy because his “connection to the insured vehicle consists 
of nothing more than the claimant having ridden in the vehicle 
to the vicinity of a later accident, or of being struck while *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
5 walking toward an insured vehicle.”  According to State Farm, 
“there is no connection between Mizuno’s use of Wong’s car and 
the accident.”  Although Sta
te Farm acknowledges that Mizuno was 
struck as he was returning to Wong’s vehicle, it argue s that 
“the accident could just as easily have happened if he were 
walking across the street to get to a bus stop, hail a cab or 
talk to a friend.  The presence of the insured vehicle at the 
scene was purely incidental to the accident and Mizuno’s 
injuries.”  State Farm argues that if this court finds UM 
coverage for Mizuno in the circumstances of this  case, the court 
would be mandating “virtually limitless” coverage .   
 
 The Ninth Circuit observed that requiring State Farm 
to provide uninsured motorist coverage unde r Wong’s policy to 
Mizuno “would extend the chain-of -events test [further than our 
prior precedent because in] this circumstance . . . (1) the 
vehicle was not disabled . . . and a covered family member of 
the named insured was not present, [and] (2) the driver was not 
an employee of the insured performing work duties . . . .”   
Consequently, the Ninth Circuit concluded that it “[could not]  
readily discern whether the Hawai‘i Supreme Court would extend 
the chain- of-events test to [Mizuno’s]  circumstance[s] . . . .”   
 
 We accepted the certified question to answer this 
inquiry and answer in the affirmative.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
6 III.  DISCUSSION 
Hawai‘i’s UM statute, Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”) 
§ 431:10C- 301(b)(3) (2013), requires “any motor vehicle 
registered or principally garaged in this State” to maintain 
“liability coverage . . . for the protection of persons insured 
thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from 
owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles because of 
bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death, resulting 
therefrom[.]”  HRS § 431:10C -301(b)(3).   The required UM  
coverage applies to “all damages arising out of accidental harm 
sustained as a result of any one accident and arising out of 32
                     
2  Hawai‘i’s UM statute was previously codified as HRS § 431 -448 
(1978).  
 
3  HRS § 431:10C -301(b) provides in relevant part:  
 
(b) A motor vehicle insurance policy shall include:  
 
(1) Liability coverage of not less than $20,000 per person, with 
an aggregate limit of $40,000 per accident, for all damages 
arising out of accidental harm sustained as a result of any one 
accident and arising out of ownership, maintenance, use, loading, 
or unloading of a motor vehicle;  
 
. . . .  
 
(3) With respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally 
garaged in this State, liability coverage provided therein or 
supplemental thereto, in limits for bodily injury or death set 
forth in paragraph (1), under provisions filed with and approved 
by the commissioner, for the protection of persons insured 
thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from 
owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles because of bodily 
injury, sickness, or disease, including death, resulting 
therefrom; provided that the coverage required under this 
paragraph shall not be applicable where any named insured in the 
policy shall reject the coverage in writing[.]  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
7 ownership, maintenance, use, loading, or unloading of a motor 
vehicle[.]”   HRS § 431:10C- 301(b)(1).   
Hawai‘i’s UM statutes have a broad
 ameliorative 
purpose.  See Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 27, in 1974 House Journal, at 
864, 866 (recognizing the purpose of Hawai ʻi’s UM statute is to 
provide “protection of users of motor vehicles from bodily 
injury, sickness, or disease, including death, resulting from 
motor vehicle accidents[,]” which includes “accidents resulting 
from activities prescribed ‘in the immedi ate proximity of the 
vehicle.’” ).  To reflect this ameliorative purpose, this  court 
has broadly interpreted Hawai‘i’s UM statute so that UM benefits 
apply even when an individual is not “in, on, entering, or 
exiting” the insured vehicle.  See National Union Fire Insurance 
Co. of Pittsburgh v. Olson, 69 Haw. 559, 563, 751 P.2d 666, 669 
(1988) (holding that UM coverage applied to an employee who was 
not physically occupying the insured vehicle); Dawes, 77 Hawaiʻi 
at 131-32 , 883 P.2d at 52- 53 (holding that UM coverage is based 
on the chain of events test where an individual is entitled to 
UM benefits when they maintain a sufficient connection to the 
insured vehicle).  More recently, the ICA expanded the extent of 
UM coverage to a permissive user who was not occupying the 
insured vehicle when he was injured by an uninsured motorist.  
Liki v. First Fire & Cas. Ins. of Haw. , Inc., 118 Hawai ʻi 123, 
131, 185 P.3d 871, 879 (App. 2008) (holding that under the chain *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
8 of events test, UM coverage existed for a driver w
ho was an 
employee of the insured, injured while performing work duties 
outside of the insured vehicle).  Hawai ʻi courts have broadly 
interpreted the coverage of UM benefits for claimants injured 
outside of the insured vehicle in Olson, Dawes, and Liki.  
In Olson , the claimant, Olson, was working as an 
emergency medical technician, driving an ambulance for his 
employer.  69 Haw. at 560, 751 P.2d at 667.  Olson was placing a 
flare in the center of the road while responding to the scene of 
an accident when he was struck by an uninsured motorist.  Id. at 
561, 751 P.2d at 667.  The insurer of the ambulance argued that 
Olson was not entitled to UM benefits because he was not 
“occupying” the vehicle at the time of his injury.  Id. at 563, 
751 P.2d at 668.  Olson held that the occupancy restriction was 
void and that, under Hawai ʻi law, an insured is entitled to 
coverage for accidents arising from the “operation, maintenance 
or use” of the vehicle, and thus, “accidents resulting from 
activities prescribed ‘in the im mediate proximity of the 
vehicle’” are compensable.  Id. at 563-64, 751 P.2d at 669.  
Accordingly, Olson  was entitled to UM coverage because:  (1) 
“Olson was using the ambulance with permission and was therefore 
an insured person”; (2) “Olson’s use [(light ing the flare)] was 
within the scope of permission granted”; (3) “Olson was lighting 
a flare to guide traffic and the flares were carried in the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
9 ambulance for exactly the purpose to which Olson put them.”  Id. 
at 564, 751 P.2d at 669.  
  Roughly six years later, this court revisited Hawai ‘i’s 
UM statute in Dawes “in order to clarify further the nature and 
scope of ( UM) insurance coverage under applicable Hawai‘i law” as 
it relates to claimants injured outside of the insured vehicle.  
77 Hawaiʻi at 119, 883 P.2d at 40.  In Dawes, Jeannette Dawes 
(“Dawes”) filed a declaratory judgment action against First 
Insurance Company of Hawaii (“FICH”) due to FICH’s failure to 
pay UM benefits for the death of Dawes’ daughter, Elizabeth 
Bockhorn (“Bockhorn”),  who was struck and killed by an uninsured 
motorist.  Id.  Bockhorn and two friends had been traveling in a 
car driven by Eric Shimp (“Shimp”),  when the car broke down.  
Id.  As the group was walking along the highway to locate repair 
assistance, approximately one mile from the insured vehicle, 
Bockhorn was struck and killed by an uninsured motorist.  Id. at 
119
-20, 883 P.2d at 40-41.  FICH denied Dawes’ claim, asserting 
that Bockhorn was not a “covered person” under the UM policy 
because she was not occupying the insured vehicle at the time of 
the accident.  Id.  at 120- 121, 883 P.2d at 41- 42.   4
  The Dawes court held that the occupancy restriction 
contained in the FICH policy was void.  See i d. at 129, 883 P.2d 
                     
4  The vehicle was owned and insured by Shimp’s father, and Shimp 
was an insured under the policy.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
10 at 50.  It found that passengers “need not be  ‘occupants’ of an 
insured vehicle . . . but must have ‘some connection with the 
insured vehicle ’ in order to be entitled to UM benefits .”  Id. 
at 129, 883 P.2d at 50. 
  In reviewing the holding in Olson, the Dawes court 
“believe[d] that the Olson analysis [wa] s both inaccurate and 
unduly restrictive ” because “ the purpose underlying the Hawai ‘i 
UM statutes is
 not limited to the protection of ‘users of motor 
vehicles[,] ’” and the purpose of Hawai‘i UM statutes does not 
limit coverage to accidents res ulting from activities “ in the 
immediate proximity of the vehicle .”  Id. at 132-33, 883 P.2d at 
52-53.  Rather, the Dawes court emphasized that “the critical 
element with respect to such claimants is a sufficient 
‘connection with the insured vehicle.’”  Id. at 132, 883 P.2d at 
53 (quoting 8C J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice § 
5092.35, at 381  (1981)). 
Thus, the court in Dawes  adopted the “chain of events 
test” defining coverage for  UM benefits:  
(1) if a person was a passenger in an insured vehicle being 
operated by a named insured or a named insured ’s family member, 
(2) during the chain of events resulting in injury to the person 
caused by an accident involving an uninsured motor vehicle, (3) 
then the person is a “covered person” at the time of his or her 
injury to the same extent as the named insured or the named 
insured’s family members would be entitled to receive UM benefits 
under the applicable UM policy .
 
 
Id. at 132-33, 883 P.2d at 53- 54.  Under this rule, the Dawes 
court held that Dawes was entitled to UM benefits, “a s a matter *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
11 of law . . . Bockhorn was a ‘covered person ’ within the meaning 
of the UM provisions of the FICH auto policy ” because:  
(1) Bockhorn was a passenger in the insured vehicle; (2) the 
insured vehicle was being operate d by Shimp, a “family member” of 
the named insured; (3) the insured vehicle broke down; (4) as a 
result of the breakdown, the occupants of the insured vehicle, 
including Bockhorn, exited and proceeded on foot to the Kona 
airport in order to obtain alternative transportation and repair 
assistance; and (5) en route to the group ’s destination, Bockhorn 
sustained fatal injuries as a result of the operation of an 
uninsured vehicle by an uninsured motorist.  
 
Id. at 121, 133, 883 P.2d at 42, 54.   
  More than a decade after Dawes, Hawai ʻi courts again 
considered the extent of UM coverage and whether it covered a 
permissive user who was an employee of the insured and was 
injured while performing work duties outside of the insured 
vehicle.  Liki, 118 Hawaiʻi at 126, 185 P.3d at 874.  In Liki, 
the employee of a repair service (“Liki”) drove his employer’s 
truck to a gas station, where he unloaded equipment from the 
truck and began cleaning a gas station sump.  Id.  at 125, 185 
P.3d at 873.  While working and kneeling in the sump, about ten 
or fifteen feet away from the work truck, Liki was struck by an 
uninsured motorist and injured.  Id. at 125, 130, 185 P.3d at 
873, 878.   
  The ICA  rejected the insurer ’s argument that because 
Liki was not “a passenger in an insured vehicle being operated 
by a named insured or a named insured’s family member,” he was 
not entitled to coverage under the Dawes chain of events test.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
12 Id. at 127, 185 P.3d at 875.  The ICA explained that it did “not 
read Dawes  as limiting coverage to only individuals who can 
satisfy those conditions.”  Id.  The ICA noted that according to 
Dawes, Hawai ‘i’s UM statute requir
es “auto policies extend UM 
coverage for the protection of all  insured ‘persons . . . who 
are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators 
of uninsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury[.]’”  Id. 
(quoting Dawes, 77 Hawaiʻi at 131, 883 P.2d at 52).  The ICA 
determined that Liki “was a permissive user of the vehicle [.]”  
Id. at 127-28, 185 P.3d at 875-76.  The ICA also held that Liki 
demonstrated “some connection with the insured vehicle” because 
he was an “employee of the named insured, who was using the 
truck during the course of his employment to get to and from the 
jobsite where he was injured, and to store and transport the 
equipment that he was using as part of his duties at the time he 
was injured.”  Id. at 128, 185 P.3d at 876.  Additionally, the 
ICA considered physical proximity to the insured vehicle “to the 
extent it tends to corroborate the connection between an injured 
employee of the named insured and the insured vehicle.”  Id. at 
130, 185 P.3d at 878.  Thus, the ICA concluded that under the 
chain of events test, the fact that “Liki was no more than 10–15 
feet from the truck” corroborated a connection between  Liki and 
the insured truck.  Id. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
13 By applying the chain of events test to Liki —a 
permissive user of an insured vehicle who was not physically 
occupying the vehicle —Hawaiʻi courts
 broadened part one of the 
chain of events test to apply to permissive users of an insured 
vehicle:  (1) if a claimant qualifies as a passenger or a 
permissive user, (2) during the chain of events resulting in 
injury to the claimant caused by an accident involving an 
uninsured motor vehicle, the claimant is a “covered person” at 
the time of his or her injury who is entitled to receive UM 
benefits under the applicable UM policy.  See Liki, 118 Hawaiʻi 
at 128, 130-31,  185 P.3d at 876, 878-79 .  Thus, under the chain 
of events test, the factual determination pivotal to determining 
UM coverage for a permissive user injured outside of the insured 
vehicle is whether the claimant “can demonstrate ‘some 
connection with the insured vehicle.’”  Id. at 127-28, 185 P.3d 
at 875-76.  
  Mizuno’s case falls squarely within the chain of 
events test that this court has consistently applied when a 
claimant, who is injured outside of the insured vehicle, seeks 
UM coverage.  Mizuno, qualifies for UM coverage because he has 
“some connection with the insured vehicle” and is a permissive 
user.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
14  Here, Mizuno is a permissive user because although he 
was not the named insured ( or a resident relative of the named 
insured), he had Wong’s permission to use her car.   
Mizuno also demonstrated some connection to the 
insured vehicle.  Mizuno had permission to use the vehicle to 
conduct an errand.  Mizuno traveled to the site of the accident 
for the express purpose of mailing bills, carrying the bills to 
the location of the post office in the insured vehicle.  Mizuno 
deposited the bills and was returning to the car at the time of 
the accident.  The record establishes that Mizuno was at the 
crosswalk between his car and the post office when the accident 
occurred.  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Mizuno, No. CV 16-
00059 KJM, 2017 WL 3000023, at *1 (D. Haw. Apr. 30, 2017).  
Mizuno’s close physical proximity with the vehicle corroborates 
that there was a connection between Mizuno, a permissive user, 
and the insured vehicle.  See Liki, 118 Haw
aiʻi at 130, 185 P.3d 
at 878 (holding that physical proximity to the insured vehicle 
can be considered “to the extent it tends to corroborate the 
connection between an injured employee of the named insured and 
the insured vehicle.”).  
  State Farm contends that this court would be mandating 
“virtually limitless” coverage if we find that Mizuno is 
entitled to UM benefit’s under Wong’s policy because coverage 
would apply whenever “ a UM . . . claimant used an insured *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
15 vehicle to get to a location where an accident later o ccurred.”  
Contrary to State Farm’s contention, virtually limitless 
coverage does not result from applying the chain of events test 
to the facts of this case.  State Farm fails to recognize that 
the chain of events test is a fact-driven analysis when it 
argues “the accident could just as easily have happened if he 
were walking across the street to get to a bus stop, hail a cab 
or talk to a friend[;] . . . [t]he presence of the insured 
vehicle at the scene was purely incidental to the accident and 
Mizuno’s injuries.”   
Here, Mizuno’s accident did not  occur when he was 
going to a bus stop, when he was hailing a cab,  or when he was 
talking to a friend.   Mizuno used the car to transport bills to 
deposit at the mailbox and was returning to the car.  The 
presence of the vehicle at the scene was not “purely incidental 
to the accident. ”  Mizuno was walking towards the car because it 
was the car that he drove to drop off the bills.  Thus, Mizuno 
has demonstrated that he has “some connection with the insured 
vehicle” because he was a permissive user, was using the insured 
vehicle to transport and drop off mail, and was returning to the 
vehicle when he was injured.  These facts are sufficiently 
similar to Dawes and Liki  to establish that the chain of events 
test is satisfied.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
16 IV.  CONCLUSION 
 For the reasons discussed above, we answer the Ninth 
Circuit’s certified question in the affirmative.  Under Hawai ʻi 
law, Mizuno is a permissive user of an insured vehicle and is 
entitled to UM benefits under the chain of events test.
