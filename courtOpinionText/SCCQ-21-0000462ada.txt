 court, which we have determined are amenable to answer.  Those 
questions are 
1.  Whether an action alleging a wrongful nonjudicial 
foreclosure of Land Court property that seeks only money 
damages against the foreclosing lender, and does not seek 
to avoid the foreclosure sale or affect title to the 
property, is an action that  “directly impeach[es] . . . any 
foreclosure proceedings affecting registered land” within 
the meaning of Haw. Rev. Stat. section 501 -118(c), and is 
time barred if filed after the issuance of a certificate of 
title to the buyer at a foreclosure sale.  
 
2.  Whether a putative class action asserting wrongful 
foreclosure claims extends the time during which a class 
member may commence an individual action under Haw. Rev. 
Stat. section 501 -118(c), where the putative class action 
was commenced before the issuance  of a certificate of title 
to the buyer at the foreclosure sale; and, if there is such 
an extension, how long does it last?  
 
The bankruptcy court explains that if we “answer[] the [first] 
question in the affirmative, the second question will become 
relevant.”  
We answer the first question in the negative.  
Although the bankruptcy court would then consider the second 
question irrelevant, we provide a brief answer to that question, 
to the extent the answer continues to bear on the timeliness of 
Plaintiff-Appellee1 Jasper Cesar Manuel’s (“Manuel”) wrongful 
foreclosure claims. 
 First, an action alleging a wrongful nonjudicial 
foreclosure of Land Court property that seeks only damages 
against the foreclosing lender is not an action that “directly 
impeaches” any foreclosure proceedings affecting registered land 
                                                           
1   Initially, Manuel’s ba nkruptcy trustee, Richard A. Yanagi, was the 
plaintiff- appellee in these proceedings.  By order dated August 8, 2022, this 
court granted the trustee’s motion to substitute Manuel as the plaintiff -
appellee. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 within the meaning of Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 501 -118 
(2018); therefore, the action is not barred by the entry of a 
transfer certificate of title (“TCT”) to the buyer at a 
foreclosure sale.  Second, our cases hold generally that the 
pendency of a putative class action tolls the time during which 
a class member may commence an individual action.  The time for 
commencing an individual action 
is tolled until a clear denial 
of class certification.   
II.  Background 
 
The following factual and procedural background is not 
reasonably undisputed.  Manuel owned a condominium unit 
registered in the Land Court of the State of Hawai ʻi.  The 
property was encumbered by a mortgage through BAC Home Loans 
Servicing, the predecessor- in-interest to Defendant- Appellant 
Bank of America, N.A. (“BANA”).   Manuel defaulted on his 
mortgage.     
 
On June 14, 2010, BAC Home Loans Servicing conducted a 
public foreclosure auction of the property and acquired the 
property itself.  It then conveyed the property to Federal 
National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) by Mortgagee’s 
Quitclaim Deed recorded in Land Court on July 28, 2010.  Fannie 
Mae then sold the property to Christopher Yukio Ichiki by a 
Limited Warranty Apartment Deed recorded in Land Court on April 
1, 2011.  The Land Court certified the new TCTs on November 10, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
4 
 2015 (certifying the TCT for the transfer from BAC Home Loans 
Servicing to Fannie Mae) and November 29, 2016 (certifying the 
TCT from Fannie Mae to Ichiki).     
 Manuel filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on October 12, 
2011.  Neither the property nor his wrongful foreclosure claim 
against BANA were listed in his original bankruptcy schedules.
  
Manuel was discharged in bankruptcy in January 2012 and his case 
closed.     
 In September 2012, a putative wrongful foreclosure class 
action, Degamo v. Bank of America, N.A., was filed in state 
court and removed to the United States District Court for the 
District of Hawai ʻi (“district court”) .  Manuel was a member of 
the plaintiff class.  On March 19, 2019, the district court 
dismissed the case on the basis that the class representatives 
lacked standing because their prior bankruptcy cases made their 
wrongful foreclosure claims property of their bankruptcy 
estates, not property of the class representatives themselves.  
On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals  for the Ninth 
Circuit (“Ninth Circuit”), the district court’s order was 
affirmed in all respects but one:  it was vacated and remanded 
for the district court to consider a motion to intervene filed 
by the trustees of the bankruptcy estates of the putative class 
representatives.  On remand, the district court denied the 
motion as moot on September 29, 2021.  Degamo v. Bank of ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
5 
 America, N.A., Civil No. 13-00141  (D. Haw. Sept. 29, 2021).  
This is because “the proposed intervenors’ counsel represented 
[to the district court at a status conference] that the 
intervenors are no longer inclined to intervene. . . .”  Degamo, 
Civil No. 13-00141 at 2.  Plaintiffs did not appeal.   
 In the meantime, in December 2020, Manuel reopened his 
bankruptcy case to amend his schedules to include the wrongful 
foreclosure claims against BANA.  The trustee of Manuel’s 
bankruptcy estate filed a complaint against BANA on January 14, 
2021 alleging wrongful foreclosure in violation of HRS § 667- 5 
(Supp. 2008) (Hawai ʻi’s former non
judicial foreclosure statute) 
and HRS Chapter 480 (2008) (specifically, Hawai ʻi’s unfair and 
deceptive acts and practices and unfair methods of competition 
statutes).  For example, one of the specific allegations was 
that the mortgagee postponed the foreclosure auction without 
publishing the change of date, as required under the power 
of 
sale and the nonjudicial foreclosure statute in effect at the 
time.  The complaint sought only money damages against BANA.  It 
did not seek return of 
title and possession of the property to 
Manuel.       
III.  Certified Questions
 
 Under HRS § 602- 5(2) (2016), this court “shall have the 
jurisdiction and power[]” to “answer, in its discretion, . . . 
any question or proposition of law certified to it by a federal ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
6 
 district[2] or appellate court if the supreme court shall so 
provide by rule. . . .”  Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(“HRAP”) Rule 13(a) (2000) provides the following:  
When a federal district or appellate court certifies to the 
Hawaiʻi
 Supreme Court that there is involved in any 
proceeding before it a question concerning the law of 
Hawaiʻi that is determinative of the cause and that there is 
no clear controlling precedent in the Hawai ʻi judicial 
decisions, the 
Hawaiʻi Supreme Court may answer the 
certified question by written opinion.  
 
Questions of law certified by the federal courts are reviewable 
de novo under the right/wrong standard of review.  Hancock v. 
Kulana Partners, LLC, 145 Hawai ʻi 374, 380, 452 P.3d 371, 377 
(2019) (citation omitted).    
IV.  Discussion 
 The first certified question centers upon the 
interpretation of HRS § 501 -118 (the “Foreclosure” section of 
our Land Court statutes found in HRS chapter 501).  HRS § 501-
118 states the following:  
In case of foreclosure by exercising the power of sale 
without a previous judgment, the affidavit required by 
chapter 667 shall be recorded with the assistant registrar.  
The purchaser or the purchaser’s assigns at the foreclosure 
sale may thereupon at any time present the deed under the 
power of sale to the assistant registrar for recording and 
obtain a new certificate.  Nothing in this chapter shall be 
construed to prevent the mortgagor or other person in 
interest from directly impeaching by action or otherwise, 
any foreclosure proceedings affecting registered land, 
prior to the entry of a new certificate of title.  
 
                                                           
2  The bankruptcy court “constitute[s] a unit of the district court” under 
28 U.S.C. § 151 (1984) (“In each judicial district, the bankruptcy judges in 
regular active service shall constitute a unit of the district court to be 
known as the bankruptcy court for that district.”).    ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
7 
 HRS § 501-118 (c) (emphas is added) .  The question is whether a 
wrongful nonjudicial foreclosure claim seeking only money 
damages from the foreclosing lender is an action “directly 
impeaching . . . any foreclosure proceedings affecting 
registered land,” and, if so, whether such a p roceeding must be 
initiated “prior to the entry of a new certificate of title.”  
A.  The parties’ arguments   
 1.  BANA’s opening brief  
In its opening brief, BANA first argues that the 
overarching purpose of the Land Court system in Hawai ʻi is to 
“conclusiv
ely establish title to land through the issuance of a 
certificate of title,” citing Wells Fargo v. Omiya, 142 Hawaiʻi 
439, 446, 420 P.3d 370,  377 (2018).  BANA states that the TCT 
notes any encumbrances or claims adverse to the title of the 
registered owner and that the holder of the TCT holds it free 
from all encumbrances except those noted on the TCT.  BANA 
asserts HRS § 501- 118 bars wrongful foreclosure claims after the 
Land Court certifies a new TCT, pointing to the plain language 
of the statute.   
BANA next explains that two Hawai ʻi appellate cases, Aames 
Funding Corp. v. Mores, 107 Hawaiʻ i 95, 110 P.3d 1042 (2005), and 
Omiya, 142 Hawai ʻi 439, 420 P.3d 370, both held that HRS § 501 -
118(c) bars a challenge to a foreclosure proceeding after the 
Land Court certifies a new TCT.
  BANA states  that Aames barred a ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
8 
 challenge to a foreclosure (based on alleged violation of the 
federal Truth in Lending Act) because the Land Court had already 
certified a new TCT.  BANA state s that Omiya  affirmed that “HRS 
§ 501-118 specifies ‘entry of a new certificate of title’ as the 
determinative point when foreclosure proceedings may no longer 
be impeached.”  
 
BANA argues that the remedy Manuel seeks (money damages 
against the foreclosing lender) does not change the result 
because claims for money damages still “directly impeach the 
foreclosure” under HRS § 501 -118(c).  To support its argument, 
BANA cites to cases from the Hawaiʻi district court
 and the Ninth 
Circuit:  Fergerstrom v. PNC Bank, N.A., 342 F. Supp. 3d 1029 
(D. Haw. 2018), aff’d , 802 F. App’x. 268 (9th Cir. 2020); and 
Seegers v. CIT Bank N.A., Civil 17 -00399 LEK -KSC, 2018 WL 
1558550 (D. Haw. Feb. 28, 2018), which barred similar claims for 
money damages from the foreclosing lenders in wrongful 
nonjudicial foreclosure and 
Hawaiʻi UDAP/UMOC actions brought 
after the entry of new TCTs for the properties.  BANA quotes the 
Fergerstrom cour t as holding that “because the action attacks 
(i.e., impeaches) the foreclosure proceeding, the particular 
form of remedy . . . does not remove these claims impeaching 
title from the proscription imposed by HRS § 501- 118 and Aames .”  
Fergerstrom, 342 F. Su pp. 3d at 1045.  The Fergerstrom court 
continued, “[I]t is the action itself that impeaches the prior ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
9 
 foreclosure proceeding, not the measure or type of damages 
sought.”  Id.     
BANA then notes  that the Fergerstrom court rejected the 
plaintiffs’ assertion  that tort claims are preserved under 
another section of the Land Court chapter, HRS § 501-212  (2018), 
notwithstanding HRS § 501- 118.  HRS § 501- 212 is titled “Actions 
for compensation for fraud, mistake, etc.,” and it provides the 
following: 
Any person wh o, without negligence on the person’s part, 
sustains loss or damage, or is deprived of land or of any 
estate or interest therein, after the original registration 
of land under this chapter, by the registration of any 
other person as owner of such land, or of any estate or 
interest therein, through fraud, or in consequence of any 
error, omission, mistake, or misdescription in any 
certificate of title or in any entry of memorandum in the 
registration book, may prosecute a contract claim in the 
circuit court for the recovery of compensation for such a 
loss or damage or for such land or estate, or interest 
therein; provided that when the person deprived of land or 
of any estate, or interest therein, in the manner above 
stated has a remedy for the recovery of the  land or of the 
estate, or interest therein, the person shall exhaust this 
remedy before resorting to the contract claim herein 
provided.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to 
deprive the plaintiff of any tort claim which the plaintiff 
may have against any person for loss or damage, or 
deprivation of land, or of any estate or interest therein.  
 
BANA quotes the Fergerstrom court as stating that HRS § 501- 212 
“on its face, does not touch HRS § 501 -118.”  Fergerstrom, 342 
F. Supp. 3d at 1044.  The Fergerstrom court reasoned, “Whereas 
[section 501-212] preserves pre- existing tort claims, [section 
501-118] does not deprive a plaintiff of any tort claim – it 
simply reinforces the conclusive and unimpeachable nature of 
Land Court certificates of title a fter entry.”  Id.     ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
10 
  BANA note s that the Ninth Circuit affirmed the Fergerstrom 
court’s order as follows:  “The district court correctly 
determined that section 501- 118’s time bar applied to 
[plaintiffs’] tort claim for money damages.  [Plaintiffs’] 
claims were based on defects in the non-judicial foreclosure 
sales of their properties and ‘directly impeach[ed] . . . the 
foreclosure proceedings.”  Fergerstrom
, 802 F.  App’x at 270.   
 BANA also quotes  the district court’s observation in 
Seegers that “[the] legislative intent [of HRS § 501-118] would 
be thwarted if the conclusive and unimpeachable character of 
certificates of title could be easily ‘sidestepped’ by suing the 
seller of registered land for money damages as a substitute for 
suing the current owner of registered land for title and 
possession.”  Seegers, Civil 17 -0399 LEK- KSC, 2018 WL 1558550 at 
*5. BANA ends  its opening brief by asking this court to answer 
the first certified question in the affirmative  to hold that HRS 
§ 501-118 bars wrongful nonjudicial foreclosure claims that seek 
only money damages against the foreclosing lender after the 
entry of a new TCT.  
2.  Manuel’s answering brief  
 In his answering brief, Manuel first points out that that 
Land Court chapter, HRS chapter 501, permits him to bring a 
wrongful foreclosure claim, which sounds in tort.  Specifically, 
HRS § 501-212 states, in relevant part , “Nothing in this chapter ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
11 
 shall be construed to deprive the plaintiff of any tort claim 
which the plaintiff may have against any person for loss or 
damage, or deprivation of land, or of any estate or interest 
therein.”   
 He then argues that HRS § 501-118 itself contains no 
express time limitation to bringing a wrongful foreclosure 
claim.  Rather, he states  that the “bar to ‘impeaching’ a 
foreclosure proceeding emanates from HRS § 501-88.”  That 
statute is titled “Certificate as evidence,” and it provides
 the 
following: 
The original certificate in the registration book, and any 
copy thereof duly certified under the signature of the 
registrar or assistant registrar, and the seal of the 
court, shall be received as evidence in all the courts of 
the State and shall be conclusive as to all matters 
contained therein, except as otherwise provided in this 
chapter. 
 
HRS § 501-88 (2018).  Manuel contends that the Aames court read 
HRS §§ 501-118 and 501- 88 together to conclude that a 
mortgagor’s claim directly impeaching a foreclosure proceeding 
must be brought before the TCT is given conclusive effect to all 
matters contained therein, which is upon the entry of a new TCT 
following the foreclosure sale.  To Manuel, this means that a 
claim challenging the contents of the new TCT (specifically, the 
identification of the registered owner) is barred by the entry 
of the new TCT.    
 Manuel reads Aames  and Omiya as supporting his 
interpretation of HRS § 501- 118 because the former mortgagors in ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
12 
 both cases challenged foreclosures and claimed title to their 
respective properties.  As such, Manuel continues, the former 
mortgagors in both Aames  and Omiya raised claims “dir ectly 
impeaching” the ownership interests listed on the new TCTs.   In 
Aames and Omiya, this court concluded that HRS § 501-118 barred 
challenges to title after the entry of the new TCT.  By 
contrast, Manuel argues that his wrongful foreclosure claim does 
not call into question the new owner’s title.   Specifically, 
Manuel points out that the new owner’s TCT will not reflect “how 
a foreclosure sale was performed or whether the foreclosure was 
wrongful”; therefore, his wrongful foreclosure claim does not 
“directly impeach” the TCT to the property.   Further, Manual 
emphasizes that the remedy he seeks is tort damages for the 
wrongful foreclosure, not return of title and possession.   
 Manuel supports his position with the plain language of the 
statute.  He asserts that the plain meaning of “directly 
impeach” in HRS § 501 -118 is to “exactly; completely,” 
“absolute[ly],” “or “unconditional[ly]” “dispute, disparage, 
deny, or contract” another’s title and right of possession of 
property lost in foreclosure, citing W EBSTER’S NEW WORLD DICTIONARY 
389 (3d college ed. 1988),  and BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY, 459, 753 (6th  
ed. 1990), respectively.  Looking to the rest of the Land Court 
chapter, Manuel notes that the legislature has included the term 
“impeach” without the modifier “directly,” for example, in HRS § ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
13 
 501-144 (2018), which is titled “New certificate after 
enforcement of lien; tax sale,” a nd which states, in relevant 
part, “At any time prior to the entry of a new certificate the 
registered owner may pursue all the registered owner’s remedies 
to impeach or annul proceedings under executions or to enforce 
liens of any description.”   (Emphasis added.)  Therefore, Manuel 
argues, the term “directly” must carry independent significance  
when it modifies the word “impeach .”  He interprets  “directly 
impeaching” a TCT to mean “an unqualified attack on or challenge 
to the title and right of possession lost to foreclosure.”   
  Manuel notes that the bankruptcy court questioned whether 
the last sentence of HRS § 501- 118 would bar a claim for money 
damages against a foreclosing lender.  That sentence states, 
“After a new certificate of title has been enter ed, no judgment 
recovered on the mortgage note for any balance due thereon shall 
operate to open the foreclosure or affect the title to 
registered land.”  The bankruptcy court reasoned that the 
phrases “directly impeaching . . . any foreclosure proceedings” 
and “open the foreclosure or affect the title to registered” 
land could not mean the same thing, otherwise the legislature 
would have used the same phrasing.  Manuel, however, argues that 
differently phrased portions of a statute could nevertheless 
mean the same thing.  Further, if the last sentence does mean 
something different from “directly impeaching any foreclosure ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
14 
 proceeding,” Manuel reads it as pertaining to an action for a 
deficiency judgment following a foreclosure sale, where the 
mortgagor raises foreclosure defects as a defense to deficiency 
liability; in such an instance, raising the defense does not re-
open the foreclosure or affect title, citing HawaiiUSA Fed. 
Credit Union v. Monalim, 147 Hawai ʻi 33, 464 P.3d 8
21 (2020).   
 Manuel next posits  that the federal courts in Fergerstrom 
and Seegers interpreted the term “directly impeach” to prohibit 
wrongful foreclosure claims seeking only money damages unless 
the plaintiff would also have been entitled to return of title 
and possession of the property.  Manuel argues this reading is 
contrary to our case law recognizing that a remedy for wrongful 
foreclosure could be damages alone, where the foreclosed- upon 
property has passed into the hands of an innocent purchaser for 
value, citing Delapinia v. Nationstar Mortg.  LLC, 150 Hawai ʻi 91, 
497 P.3d 106 (2021); Mount v. Apao , 139 Hawaiʻi 167, 384 P.3d 
1268 (2016); and Santiago v. Tanaka, 137 Hawaiʻ i 137, 366 P.3d 
612 (2016).     
 Manuel next opines  that an in pari materia reading of HRS § 
501-118 and other Land Court statutes also supports his position 
that HRS § 501-118 does not bar money damage claims against a 
foreclosing lender.   Manuel reiterates that Land Court property 
owners may sue in tort pursuant to HRS § 501- 212.  Manuel then ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
15 
 points to HRS § 501- 81 (2018), which is titled “Legal incidents 
of registered land” and states, in relevant part  
Registered land, and ownership therein, shall in all 
respects be subject to the same burdens and incidents which 
attach by law to unregistered land.  Nothing in this 
chapter shall in any way be construed to . . . change or 
affect in any way any other rights or liabilities created 
by law and applicable to unregistered land; except as 
otherwise expressly provided in this chapter.    
 
Manuel argues that nothing in HRS § 501- 118 expressly provides 
that Land Court property owners cannot recover money damages 
from foreclosing lenders, when that remedy is available to non-
Land Court property owners.   
 Next, Manuel contends  that BANA’s reading of HRS § 501 -118 
to preclude money damages claims after the entry of a new TCT 
improperly abrogates a wrongful foreclosure plaintiff’s common 
law right to sue for damages, where no express legislative 
intent to do so appears.  Manuel notes that the common law right 
to sue for wrongful foreclosure damages originated in Johnson v. 
Tisdale, 4 Haw. 605 (Haw. Kingdom 1883),  and continues to be 
recognized in our recent cases, such as Delapinia , 150 Hawai ʻi 
91, 497 P.3d 106; Mount , 139 Hawaiʻ i 167, 384 P.3d 1268; an d 
Santiago, 137 Hawai ʻi 137, 366 P.3d 612.   
 Manuel asserts that the legislative history of HRS § 501-
118 validates his reading of the statute.  He notes  that when 
the Land Court statute was enacted in 1903, HRS § 501- 118’s 
predecessor stated the following:  “Nothing contained  in this ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
16 
 Act shall be construed to prevent the mortgagor or other person 
in interest from directly impeaching, by bill in equity or 
otherwise, any foreclosure proceedings affecting registered 
land, prior to the entry of a new certificate of title.”   1903 
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 56, § 63 at 307.  Manuel explain s that, at 
the time, a bill in equity was the vehicle by which a wrongful 
foreclosure plaintiff would seek to set aside a sale and, 
therefore, “directly impeach” the foreclosure proceedings.  By 
contrast, at the time, money damages were a form of legal 
relief.  With the promulgation of the Hawai ʻi Rules
 of Civil 
Procedure, and the merger of law and equity in Hawaiʻi courts, 
the “bill in equity” language in HRS § 501 -118 was replaced with 
“action.”  Manuel a sserts that HRS § 501- 118 may reasonably be 
read today to time- bar those claims that would have been 
originally filed as bills in equity.   
 Manuel then argues that structural issues arise under 
BANA’s reading of HRS § 501 -118 as setting a time bar as “the  
entry of the new TCT. ”  Under BANA’s interpretation of the 
statute, the time a plaintiff has for bringing a wrongful 
foreclosure damages  claim depends upon how quickly the Land 
Court can certify and enter a new TCT.  Manuel points out that 
the Land Court was once able to certify TCTs on the same day 
they were presented, Hon. Gary W.B. Chang, Land Court:  
Demystifying an Enigma, HAWAII BAR JOURNAL 4, 10 (2017); within ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
17 
 months, see Aames, 107 Hawai ʻi at 
96 n.2, 97, 110 P.3d at 1043 
n.2, 1044; and currently, after years, see  Omiya, 142 Hawai ʻi at 
452, 420 P.3d at 383 (discussing the Land Court’s backlog).  In 
any event, Manuel argues that “foreclosed Land Court homeowners 
risk having their damages remedies further curtailed by the 
speed with which the Land Cour t enters new TCTs,” which could 
lead to severe and unjust results.      
 Lastly, Manuel asserts  that the fraud exception to HRS § 
501-118 applies to his case.  See  HRS § 501- 106 (2018) (“[I]n 
all cases of registration procured by fraud the owner may pursue 
all the owner’s remedies against the parties to the fraud, 
without prejudice however to the rights of any innocent holder 
for value of a certificate of title.”).   He argues that BANA 
committed constructive fraud upon Manuel due to the  
confidential relationship between a self- dealing mortgagee bank, 
who occupies a superior position in a nonjudicial foreclosure, 
and the mortgagor, citing Hungate  v. Law Off. of David B. Rosen , 
139 Hawaiʻ i 394, 409, 391 P.3d 1, 16 (2017) .  
 
Manuel urges this court to answer the first certified 
question in the negative to hold that an action alleging 
wrongful nonjudicial foreclosure of Land Court property that 
seeks only money damages is not time- barred by the entry of a 
new TCT because such an action does not “directly impeach” 
foreclosure proceedings under HRS § 501- 118.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

  3.  BANA’s reply brief  
 In its reply, BANA emphasizes that the plain language of 
HRS § 501-118 precludes a mortgagor from bringing a wrongful 
foreclosure claim, regardless of the remedy sought, after entry 
of a new TCT.  With respect to the Manuel’s argument that BANA’s 
reading of HRS § 501- 118 abrogates the common law right to sue 
for wrongful foreclosure, BANA counter -argues that HRS § 501- 118 
merely sets a time limit for bringing the claim.  With respect 
to Manuel’s reading of the legislative history of HRS § 501 -118, 
BANA counter-argues that the statute’s prohibition on bringing, 
past the entry of a new TCT, proceedings directly impeaching a 
foreclosure “by bill of equity or otherwise ” encompasses the 
money damages claim Manuel asserts, as that statute is phrased 
now (“any action or otherwise ”) and when the statute was 
originally enacted (“by bill of equity or otherwise .”).  In any 
event, BANA states that resort to legislative history is 
unnecessary where the plain language of the statute is clear.  
As to Manuel’s allegation that BANA committed constructive 
fraud, BANA counter- argues (1) that the argument is irrelevant 
to the certified question presented to this court; and (2) 
mortgagor and mortgagee are generally not in a confidential 
relationship that would give rise to a constructive fraud claim.

19 B. Analysis
The first certified question asks this court to engage in
statutory interpretation of the word “directly” in HRS § 501 -
118’s phrase “directly impeaching by action or otherwise, any 
foreclosure proceedings affecting registered land.”  Statutory 
interpretation is guided by established rules: 
First, the  fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.  
Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning.  Third, implicit in the task of 
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself.  Fourth, when 
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness 
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an 
ambiguity exists.  
Rees v. Carlisle, 113 Hawai ʻi 446, 452, 153 P.3d 1131, 1137 
(2007) (citations omitted).   
In construing an ambiguous statute, “the meaning of the 
ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, 
with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may 
be compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning.” HRS 
§ 1–15(1) (1993).  Moreover, the courts may resort to
extrinsic aids in determining legislative intent.  One
avenue is the use of legislative history as an interpretive
tool.
Gray v. Admin. Dir. of the Court, 84 Hawai ʻi 138, 148, 931 P.2d 
580, 590 (1997)  (cleaned up). 
1.HRS § 501 -118’s phrase “directly impeaching . . . any
foreclosure proceeding s” contains an ambiguity .
The plain meaning of “directly” in HRS § 501 -118 is not 
obvious.  We look to the rest of the Land Court chapter for 
guidance in construing the word.  We agree with Manuel that the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
20 term “directly” must have independent significance in modifying 
the word “impeach” because the only statute within Chapter 501 
concerning “impeaching” a TCT is HRS § 501 -144.  That statute is 
titled “New certificate after enf orcement of lien; tax sale,” 
and it states, in relevant part, “At any time prior to the entry 
of a new certificate the registered owner may pursue all the 
registered owner’s remedies to impeach or annul proceedings 
under executions or to enforce liens of a ny description.”   The 
phrase “directly impeach” in HRS § 501 -118 must have a meaning 
different from “impeach” in HRS § 501 -144.  We have held that 
where the legislature “uses different terms in different parts 
of a statute, we must presume this was intenti onal, and that the 
legislature means two different things.”  Peer News LLC v. City 
& Cnty. of Honolulu , 138 Hawai ʻi 53, 67 -68, 376 P.3d 1, 15 -16 
(2016) (citing Agustin v. Dan Ostrow Constr. Co. , 64 Haw. 80, 
83, 636 P.2d 1348, 1351 (1981). 
2.Legislative history provides no guidance on
interpreting the phrase “directly impeaching . . . any
foreclosure proceeding s.”
The legislative history of both HRS §§ 501 -118 and -144 is
silent as to the difference in meaning, however.  Further, the 
legislative history of HRS § 501 -118 itself provides no insight 
into the meaning of “directly impeach.”  We disagree with Manuel 
that there is meaning to be found in the evolution of the 
statutory language from 1903’s verbiage, “directly impeaching, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
21 by bill in equity  or otherwise, any foreclosure proceedings 
affecting registered land” to the current verbiage, “directly 
impeaching, by action  or otherwise, any foreclosure proceedings 
affecting registered land.”  Manuel argues that the 1903 
predecessor to HRS § 501-118 barred only actions in equity 
(i.e., those seeking to void title and return possession of the 
property) after the entry of a new TCT; therefore, the statute 
did not bar actions at law for money damages after the entry of 
a new TCT.  We agree with  BANA that the phrase “or otherwise” 
could have referred to actions at law.  
3.Our precedent interpreting HRS § 501 -118 has not yet
examined wrongful foreclosure complaints seeking only
money damages against foreclosing lenders.
Our state ap pellate court precedent interpreting HRS § 501 -
118 has also never dealt with the issue of whether the entry of 
a new TCT would bar a wrongful foreclosure claim seeking only 
money damages.  Our key cases, Aames, 107 Hawai ʻi 95, 110 P.3d 
1042; Bank of New York Mellon v. Onaga, Inc., 140 Hawai ʻi 358, 
400 P.3d 559 (2017);  and Omiya, 142 Hawai ʻi 439, 420 P.3d 370; 
have all held that HRS § 501 -118 bars wrongful foreclosure 
claims seeking to affect title to property after the entry of a 
new TCT.  
In Aames, a mortgagee bank foreclosed upon mortgagors, the 
Moreses.  Aames, 107 Hawai ʻi at 97, 110 P.3d at 1044.  After the 
Land Court issued the mortgagee a TCT to the property, the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
22 Moreses refused to surrender possession, and the mortgagee filed 
an action for ejectment against them.  Id.  The district court 
granted judgment for possession and writ of possession in favor 
of the mortgagee and against the Moreses.  Id.  
On appeal, the Moreses  argued that the district court did 
not have jurisdiction over the case because their case involved 
a dispute over title to real property, which, pursuant to HRS § 
604-5(d), the district courts do not hear.  Aames, 107 Hawai ʻi 
98, 110 P.3d 1045.  In additi on to holding that the Moreses did 
not sufficiently assert the source, nature, and extent of their 
title claims, this court applied HRS § 501 -118 to hold that 
“defenses to mortgages foreclosed upon by exercise of the 
mortgagee’s power of sale must be raise d ‘prior to the entry of 
a new certificate of title.’”  Aames, 107 Hawai ʻi at 102, 110 
P.3d at 1049.
In reaching this holding, we first explored the “sparse” 
legislative history of Chapter 501, noting that the Land Court 
system was intended to “provide [] an economic and convenient 
manner of recording land titles, which . . . will do away with 
the present cumbersome plan of records and largely reduce the 
expense of land transfers.”  Aames, 107 Hawai ʻi at 101, 110 P.3d 
at 1048.  The purpose of the Land Co urt system, we stated, was 
to “conclusively establish title to land through the issuance of 
a certificate of title.”  Id. (citation omitted).  We then held ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
23 that HRS § 501-118 directs that [a mortgagor’s right to 
challenge a foreclosure proceeding] is to be  exercised ‘prior to 
the entry of a new certificate of title.’”  Id.  We “buttressed” 
this holding with HRS § 501 -88, which “provides that the matters 
stated in the certificate are to be given conclusive effect in 
the courts.”  Id.   As the Moreses brought their title defense to 
the ejectment proceeding after the entry of the TCT listing the 
mortgagee as title holder, we held that the mortgagee’s title to 
the subject property became “conclusive and unimpeachable.”  
Aames, 107 Hawai ʻi at 102 -03, 110 P.3d 1049 -50.  Thus, Aames 
interpreted the “entry of a new TCT” limit in HRS § 501 -118 to 
protect a TCT’s conclusivity of title.   
Similarly, in Onaga, we did not allow a junior creditor to 
“undo” a judicial foreclosure once good faith purchasers had 
entered their TCT with the Land Court.  Onaga, 140 Hawai ʻi at 
368, 400 P.3d at 569.  In that case, the junior creditor 
appealed a judicial foreclosure proceeding but did not post a 
supersedeas bond.  Onaga, 140 Hawai ʻi at 362, 400 P.3d at 563.  
While the case was on appeal, the foreclosed upon property was 
sold to good faith purchasers, who moved to intervene in the 
appeal and dismiss it as moot, presenting as evidence the new 
TCT issued to them.  Onaga, 140 Hawai ʻi at 363, 400 P.3d at 564.  
We noted that “title to the Property has already passed to the 
[good faith purchasers]”; therefore, “[a]llowing [the junior ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
24 
 creditor] to undo or otherwise hinder the sale of the Property 
to the [good faith purchasers] would be incons istent with the 
purposes underlying our Land Court statute.”  Onaga, 140 Hawai ʻi 
at 368, 400 P.3d at 569.  In so ruling, we cited both HRS § 501 -
88 and the policy reasons explored in Aames, further 
underscoring that the time limit to bring claims under HRS  § 
501-118 is intended to protect the conclusivity of the new TCT.  
Onaga, 140 Hawai ʻi at 368 -69, 400 P.3d at 569 -70. 
 Lastly, in Omiya, this court held that a mortgagee was 
entitled to bring an action seeking to “restore title” to it, 
including “cancellat ion of a Transfer Certificate of Title,” 
where the action was brought prior to the entry of a TCT to a 
third-party purchaser.  Omiya, 142 Hawai ʻi at 443, 456, 420 P.3d 
374, 387.  In Omiya , Wells Fargo foreclosed on its mortgage lien 
in a nonjudicial forecl osure, then the Association of Apartment 
Owners of the Ilikai Apartment Building foreclosed on the 
property for nonpayment of maintenance fees.  Omiya, 142 Hawai ʻi 
at 443, 420 P.3d at 374.  The property was then sold to a third 
party.  Id.  The Land Court had recorded the quitclaim deed for 
the conveyance to the third party, but it had not yet certified 
a new TCT for the third party.  Id.  We held that Wells Fargo’s 
action was not barred by HRS § 501 -118, as its challenge to 
title was brought  prior to the entry (which we defined as 
“certification”) of the new TCT to the third party.  Omiya, 142 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
25 
 Hawaiʻi at 455, 420 P.3d at 386.  Thus, Wells Fargo could 
directly impeach and seek to undo the foreclosure proceedings 
because the certification of th e new TCT had not occurred at the 
time suit was brought.   
 In sum, the parties challenging foreclosures in Aames, 
Onaga, and Omiya  each sought to undo foreclosures, which does 
affect the conclusivity of the matters stated within an entered 
TCT (namely, the identification of the title owner).  Aames, 107 
Hawaiʻi 95, 110 P.3d 1042; Onaga, 140 Hawai ʻi 358, 400 P.3d 559; 
Omiya, 142 Hawai ʻi 439, 420 P.3d 370.  These parties did not seek 
money damages against a foreclosing mortgagee, which does not 
affect the co nclusivity of matters stated within an entered TCT.  
Aames, 107 Hawai ʻi 95, 110 P.3d 1042; Onaga, 140 Hawai ʻi 358, 400 
P.3d 559; Omiya, 142 Hawai ʻi 439, 420 P.3d 370.  These cases tend 
to support Manuel’s contention that to “directly impeach” 
foreclosure p roceedings, an action must threaten the 
conclusivity of a new TCT, entered after the foreclosure sale.   
 4.   The federal cases interpreting HRS § 501 -118 are not  
  persuasive.  
 
 BANA urges us to look to the district court and Ninth 
Circuit cases holding that HRS § 501 -118 bars wrongful 
foreclosure claims, seeking only money damages, brought after 
the entry of a new TCT.  See Seegers, Civil 17 -00399 LEK -KSC, 
2018 WL 1558550; Fergerstrom, 342 F.  Supp. 3d 1029; and ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
26 
 Fergerstrom, 802 F.  App’x. 268.  We are not bound by these 
courts’ interpretations of Hawai ʻi law, and we in fact disagree 
with them.  Each of these cases seem to read “directly” out of 
the phrase “directly impeach” in HRS § 501-118 and is, 
therefore, not useful to us in answering the first certified 
question. 
 First, in Seegers, the district court dismissed the 
Plaintiff’s quiet title and wrongful foreclosure damages claims 
by applying Aames  to hold that the claims were bar red by the 
entry of new TCTs following the foreclosure sale.  Seegers, 2018 
Civil 17-00399 LEK -KSC, WL 1558550 at *2.  As to the wrongful 
foreclosure money damages claim in particular, the district 
court stated, “Plaintiff’s claimed entitlement to money da mages 
for loss of title and possession impeaches  the foreclosure 
proceeding and contradicts the Land Court’s issuance of new 
certificates of title.”  Seegers, Civil 17 -00399 LEK -KSC, 2018 
WL 1558550 at *4 (emphasis added).  This statement, however, 
does not interpret the word “directly,” modifying the word 
“impeach” in HRS § 501 -118.  The district court went on to state 
that the plaintiff would be entitled to money damages for loss 
of title and possession “only if he was legally entitled to 
title and possession of the Property,” but because new TCTs had 
already been entered, he was not.  Id.  Finally, the district 
court stated that the legislative intent behind  the Land Court ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
27 
 chapter “would be thwarted if the conclusive and unimpeachable 
character of certificates of title would be easily ‘sidestepped’ 
by suing the seller of registered land for money damages as a 
substitute for suing the current owner of register ed land for 
title and possession.”  Seegers, Civil 17 -00399 LEK -KSC, 2018 WL 
1558550 at *5. 
 The Fergerstrom  court borrowed heavily from Seegers in 
holding, “As a matter of Hawai ʻi law, the Land Court’s entry of 
Certificates of Title is conclusive and unim peachable evidence 
of the subsequent owners’ title to the properties, and 
Plaintiff’s [wrongful foreclosure] claims, which seek to impeach 
the foreclosure proceedings, and demand damages to compensate 
for the loss of title and possession, are statutorily p recluded”  
Fergerstrom, 342 F.  Supp. 3d at 1032 (citing Aames, 107 Hawai ʻi 
at 101, 110 P.3d at 1048; HRS § 501 -118) (emphasis added).  Like 
the Seegers court, the Fergerstrom  court did not interpret the 
word “directly,” modifying the word “impeach” in HRS § 501-118.  
To the Fergerstrom  court, the plaintiffs’ wrongful foreclosure 
action “attacks (i.e., impeaches) the foreclosure proceeding” 
“regardless of how the remedy is styled.”  342 F.  Supp. 3d at 
1045 (omitting the modifier “directly” in interpreting HR S § 
501-118).  Moreover, the Fergerstrom  court viewed a wrongful 
foreclosure claim praying only for money damages as an attempt ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
28 
 to “plead around Aames by requesting equitable damages 
equivalent to restoring title.”  342 F.  Supp. 3d at 1042 -43.   
 The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s Fergerstrom  
order in a two- page memorandum opinion that stated only, “The 
district court correctly determined that section 501 -118’s time 
bar applied to Appellants’ tort claims for money damages.  
Appellants’ claims were based on defects in the non -judicial 
foreclosure sales of their properties and ‘directly impeach[ed] 
. . . the foreclosure proceedings.”  Fergerstrom , 802 F.  App’x. 
at 270 (citing Aames , 107 Hawai ʻi 95, 110 P.3d 1042).  No further 
reasoning is given.   
 None of the federal cases interpreted the term “directly” 
in HRS § 501- 118’s phrasing “directly impeaches any foreclosure 
proceeding.”  Further, the district court in both Seegers and 
Fergerstrom viewed wrongful foreclosure money damages claims as 
“equivalent” to claims for the return of title and possession, 
when our precedent has not explicitly stated that.  
 5.   Our recent precedent on the remedies available   
  following wrongful foreclosure do not foreclose the  
  possibility that a money d amages claim could be   
  brought following the entry of a new TCT to a third - 
  party purchaser.  
 
 In fact, our precedent contemplates wrongful foreclosure 
actions seeking only money damages where return of title is not 
practicable (or, in this case, req uested) and has not 
necessarily framed the remedies as equivalents.  First, in ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
29 
 Santiago , we held that a mortgagee’s nonjudicial foreclosure 
upon mortgagors’ property was unlawful because it did not 
proceed pursuant to a power of sale (the mortgage document  had 
omitted a power of sale clause, which was required by law).  137 
Hawaiʻi at 156, 366 P.3d at 631.  Return of title and possession 
of the property was not practicable, as the property had already 
been resold to an innocent purchaser for value after the 
foreclosure.  137 Hawai ʻi at 158, 366 P.3d at 633.  Therefore, we 
ruled that the mortgagors were “entitled to restitution of their 
proven out-of -pocket losses from [the mortgagee’s] wrongful 
foreclosure of the Mortgage and subsequent sale of the 
[property].”  Id.   We did not measure damages as the equivalent 
of title and possessio n. 
 Next, in Mount, we held that a mortgagor wrongfully 
foreclosed upon mortgagees’ property by failing to provide 
information on reinstating the mortgage loan within five days of 
a request.  139 Hawai ʻi at 169, 384 P.3d at 1270.  The property 
had already been sold to a third party, whose status as an 
innocent purchaser for value was not determined at the time of 
appeal and certiorari.  139 Hawai ʻi at 180, 384 P.3d at 1281.  
Therefore, the case was remanded to the circuit court to 
determine whether the thir d party was an innocent purchaser for 
value, in order to determine which remedy under Santiago  
applied:  rendering the foreclosure sale voidable and returning ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
30 
 title and possession to the mortgagors (where the third party 
was found not to be an innocent pur chaser for value) or damages 
only (where the third party was found to be an innocent 
purchaser for value).  Id.  
 In Hungate, we held that a mortgagee wrongfully foreclosed 
upon a mortgagee by failing to give proper notice of a 
foreclosure auction date and  postponements of that date pursuant 
to the mortgage’s power of sale and the non -judicial foreclosure 
statute in effect at the time.  139 Hawai ʻi at 402, 391 P.3d at 
9.  We noted that “the mortgagor can protect its interests 
through filing a claim against the mortgagee for wrongful 
foreclosure,” and reiterated that, “[w]hen voiding the 
foreclosure is not possible, the mortgagor is entitled to 
‘restitution of their proven out -of-pocket losses’ through a 
wrongful foreclosure claim.”  139 Hawai ʻi at 407, 391 P .3d at 14 
(quoting Santiago , 137 Hawai ʻi at 158 -59, 366 P.3d at 633 -34). 
 Lastly, in Delapinia , we summarized the state of our 
jurisprudence on remedies for wrongful foreclosure as follows:   
Hawaiʻi law has moved unmistakably towards the conclusion 
that sales pursuant to a wrongful foreclosure are voidable, 
regardless of whether the violation of statutory of 
contractual, substantial or a mere irregularity.  This 
policy protects the interests accrued by innocent 
purchasers and avoids forfeiture if possible,  while 
deterring the conduct of the party that wrongfully 
foreclosed through a damage remedy.  
  
150 Hawaiʻ i at 104, 497 P.3d at 119.  Thus, Delapinia  noted that 
Hawaiʻi’s wrongful foreclosure remedies are twofold and ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
31 
 alternative (and not necessarily equivalent) to each other:  (1) 
return of title and possession; or (2) money damages.  Id. 
 We acknowledge that t hese rules developed in the context of 
nonjudicial foreclosures of properties registered in the Bureau 
of Conveyances.  See Santiago , CAAP-11-0000697, ICA Dkt. 28:38; 
Mount, 139 Hawaiʻ i at 170, 384 P.3d at 1271; Hungate, 139 Hawai ʻi 
at 399, 391 P.3d at 6; Delapinia , CAAP-17-0000387, ICA Dkt. 
16:32.3  Although Santiago , Mount, Hungate, and Delapinia  all 
involved re gular system property, Land Court property is 
“subject to the same burdens and incidents which attach by law 
to unregistered land.”  HRS § 501 -81.   
 We next consider whether HRS 501 -118’s “entry of a new TCT” 
limitation bars each type of remedy in the specific context of 
foreclosures upon Land Court property.  A complaint, filed after 
the entry of a new TCT and seeking the first remedy (return of 
title and possession), does “directly impeach” foreclosure 
proceedings because it challenges the matters contained within a 
new TCT (i.e., the identification of the owner of the property).  
A complaint, filed after the entry of a new TCT and seeking the 
second remedy (money damages against a wrongfully foreclosing 
mortgagee), does not “directly impeach” foreclosure proceedings 
                                                           
3   We take judicial notice of the records filed in our appellate docket that 
the foreclosed properties at issue in Santiago  and Delapinia w ere registered 
in the regular system.  Hawai ʻi Rules of Evidence Rule 201.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
32 
 because it does not challenge the matters contained within the 
new TCT (i.e., the identification of the owner of the property).  
 6.   HRS § 501 -118 does not bar a wrongful foreclosure  
  complaint seeking only money damages from the   
  foreclosing mortgagee, even when the complaint is  
  brought after the entry of a TCT to a third -party  
  purchaser.  
 
 In short, reading HRS § 501 -118 in harmony with (1) our 
precedent and (2) the purpose and policy behind the Land Court 
chapter to protect the conclusivity of the matters contained 
within a TCT, we hold that a wrongful foreclosure claim, seeking 
only money damages against the foreclosing l ender, where the 
property has passed on to a third party, does not “directly 
impeach” a foreclosure proceeding because it does not affect  the 
matters contained within the new TCT.  Manuel’s case illustrates 
that point:  his wrongful foreclosure claim is ba sed upon 
alleged irregularities committed by the mortgagee in auctioning 
his property.  He seeks money damages caused by those 
irregularities.  He does not seek to affect any matter contained 
within the new TCT (namely, the identification of the third 
party owner of the property).   
B.   The Degamo putative class action tolled the limitations 
periods for bringing a wrongful foreclosure claim. 
 
 As the entry of the new TCTs in this case did not bar 
Manuel’s January 14, 2021 complaint for wrongful foreclosure  
money damages, the next question is whether the complaint was ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
33 
 timely.  Manuel states that his Complaint was timely filed4 only 
if the time for bringing it was tolled by the Degamo  putative 
class action.  Manuel was a putative member of the plaintiff 
class.   
 In Levi v. Univ. of Hawai ʻi, we ad
opted the United States 
Supreme Court’s holdings on “class -action tolling.”  67 Haw. 90, 
93, 679 P.2d 129, 132 (1984).  The United States Supreme Court 
held first that “the commencement of a class action suspends the 
applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of 
the class who would have been parties had the suit been 
permitted to continue as a class action.”  Am. Pipe & Constr. 
Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 554 (1974).  The Court next clarified 
that, “[o]nce the statute of limitations has been tolled, it 
remains tolled for all members of the putative class until class 
certification is denied.  At that point, class members may 
choose to file their own suits or to intervene as plaintiffs in 
the pending action.”  Crown, Cork & Seal Co. v. Parker, 462 U.S. 
345, 354 (1983).  We have also held that class action tolling 
ends upon entry of (1) “an order expressly denying a motion for 
class certification (or expressly denying the last such motion, 
if there is more than one motion)”; (2) where there is no such 
express order, upon entry of final judgment dismissing the class

 action, or (3) upon a putative class member’s decision to opt 
out of the class.  Patrickson v. Dole Food Co., 137 Hawai ʻi 217, 
230, 368 P.3d 959, 972 (2015) (ruling specifically on cross-
jurisdictional class action tolling). 
In its opening brief, BANA argues that the Degamo class 
action did not toll Manuel’s claims for two reasons.  First, 
BANA argues the plain language of HRS § 501- 118 does not extend 
the time to directly impeach foreclosure proceedings beyond the 
entry of a new TCT.  Second, BANA argues that HRS § 501- 118 is a 
statute of repose, whose outer time limit is the entry of a new 
TCT.  BANA states that, unlike statutes of limitations, statutes 
of repose are not subject to class
-action tolling, citing Cal. 
Pub. Emps’. Ret. Sys. v. ANZ Secs. Inc., 137 S.Ct. 2042, 2051- 52 
(2017).    
Manuel argues that HRS § 501- 118 is not a statute of 
repose, pointing out that Hawai ʻi 
appellate courts have held so 
far that only the following statutes are statutes of repose:  
HRS §§ 657-5, 657-8, 657 -7.3(a), and 514B- 94(b).  Further, 
Manuel points out that Hawai ʻi appellate courts have allowed 
challenges to title in cases of fraud even after a new TCT has 
been entered, citing Aames , 107 Hawaiʻi at 103, 110 P.3d at 1050, 
and Fukunaga v. Fukunaga, 8 Haw. App. 273, 280-81, 800 P.2d 618, 
622 (1990).    ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 BANA replies that if putative class actions are allowed to 
toll challenges to title beyond the entry date of the TCT, the 
purpose of the Land Court system, in general, and of HRS § 501-
118, in particular,  would be defeated.   
In answering the first certified question, we held that HRS 
§ 501-118 did not preclude Manuel from filing his wrongful 
foreclosure complaint after the entry of the new TCT to the 
third party.  Therefore, HRS § 501-118 is not the statute under 
which the complaint’s timeliness is measured.  Hence, whether 
HRS § 501- 118 is a statute of limitation or repose is not 
necessary to decide.  Rather, the statutes of limitations for 
wrongful foreclosure and Chapter 480 claims apply.  
In this case, the pendency of the Degamo  putative class 
action tolled the time for Manuel to file an individual action.  
Class action tolling began on September 12, 2007, with the 
filing of the Degamo putative class action complaint.  It 
clearly ended on September 29, 2021.  Although the district 
court had dismissed the putative class action on March 14, 2019, 
the dismissal was appealed to the Ninth Circuit.  Therefore, 
March 14, 2019 does not mark the date that denial of class 
certification became clear.  The Ninth Circuit remanded the case 
to the district court to consider the motion to intervene filed 
by the class representatives’ bankruptcy trustees.  At a status 
conference, the trustees informed the district court that they ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST ’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
36 
  no longer sought to intervene.  Degamo, Civil No. 13 -00141 at 2.  
Therefore, on September 29, 2021, the district court filed its 
order denying the motion to intervene as moot.  Id.   On that 
date, the denial of class certification became clear.      
V.  Conclusion 
 First, an action alleging a wrongful nonjudicial 
foreclosure of Land Court property that seeks only damages 
against the foreclosing lender is not an action that “directly 
impeaches” any foreclosure proceedings affecting registered land 
within the meaning of 
HRS § 501 -118(c); therefore, the action is 
not barred by the entry of a TCT to the buyer at a foreclosure 
sale.  Second, the pendency of 
a putative class action asserting 
wrongful foreclosure claims tolls  the time during which a class 
member may commence an individual action.  The time for 
commencing an individual action is tolled until a clear denial 
of class certification.  In this case, the filing of the 
putative class action on September 7, 2012 tolled the time for 
filing an individual wrongful foreclosure claim until September
