OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J.  
 
In response to two certified questions from the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, we examine the 
relationship between Hawaiʻ i’s general long-arm statute, Hawaiʻ i 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 634-35 (2016), and the personal Electronically Filed

 jurisdiction limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment’s due 
process clause. 
These certified questions arise from a product liability 
suit.  Matt Yamashita, a Hawaiʻ i resident, sued two out-of-state 
corporations in Hawaiʻ i state court over an exploding electronic 
cigarette. 
 The suit was removed to the United States District 
Court for the District of Hawaiʻ i.  There, Yamashita’s complaint 
was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.
  The District 
Court based its dismissal on a finding that the defendant’s 
activities in Hawaiʻ i were not the but-for cause of Yamashita’s 
injuries, meaning that his claims did not “arise out of” the 
defendants’ activities. 
On appeal, the Ninth Circuit determined that to exercise 
personal jurisdiction over the defendant corporations, both 
Hawaiʻi’s  long-arm statute and constitutional due process must be 
satisfied. 
 Finding Hawaiʻ i precedent on the reach of Hawaiʻ i’s  
long-arm statute unclear in light of a recent Supreme Court 
case, Ford Motor Co. v. Montana Eighth Judicial District Court, 
141 S.Ct. 1017 (2021), the Ninth Circuit panel certified the 
following questions to the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court:  
1.  May a Hawaii court assert personal jurisdiction over an 
out-of-state corporate defendant if the plaintiff’ s injury 
“relates to,” but does not “arise from,” the defendant’s 
in-state acts enumerated in Hawaii’s general long- arm 
statute?  Compare Ford Motor Co. v. Montana Eighth Judicial 
District Court, 141 S.Ct. 1017 (2021), with Haw. Rev. Stat. 
§ 634-35. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 2.
  In light of Ford Motor Co. v. Montana Eighth Judicial 
District Court, does Hawaii’s general long- arm statute, 
Haw. Rev. Stat. § 634- 35, permit a Hawaii court to assert 
personal jurisdiction to the full extent permitted by the 
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment? 
We accepted these questions under Hawaiʻ i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 13 and now answer “Yes” to both. 
In 1965, 
Hawaiʻi adopted a long- arm statute, 
HRS § 634-35.  
This law provides that: 
(a) Any person, whether or not a citizen or resident of 
this State, who in person or through an agent does any of 
the acts hereinafter enumerated, thereby submits such 
person, and, if an individual, the person’s personal 
representative, to the jurisdiction of the courts of this 
State as to any cause of action arising from the doing of 
any of the acts . . . .  (Emphasis added.) 
 
The legislature took its language directly from an Illinois 
statute, which had already been construed by that state’s 
highest court “as expanding Illinois’ jurisdiction over 
nonresident defendants to the extent permissible by the due 
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”  Cowan v. First 
Ins. Co. of Hawaii, Ltd., 61 Haw. 644, 649 n.4, 608 P.2d 394, 
399 n.4 (1980).  Thus, in Cowan we observed that “Hawaii’s long-
arm statute, HRS § 634-35, was adopted to expand the jurisdiction of the State’s courts to the extent permitted by 
the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”  Id. at 
649, 608 P.2d at 399.    
Because most serious personal jurisdiction disputes end up
in federal court, we have had few occasions to further consider
  long-arm statute and the due the relationship between 
Hawaiʻi’s  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 process clause.  When the question has arisen, we have treated 
Cowan as governing precedent.  See e.g., Shaw v. North Am. Title 
Co., 76 Hawaiʻ i 323, 327, 876 P.2d 1291, 1295 (1994) (following 
Cowan).  Hawai
ʻi’s District Court which has fielded the majority 
of these cases, has done the same.  See e.g., Greys Ave. 
Partners, LLC v. Theyers, 431 F.Supp.3d 1121, 1128 (D. Haw. 
2020) (citing to Cowan) (“Hawaii’s jurisdiction reaches the limits of due process set by the United States Constitution.”)  
The limits of due process, however, have not been static.  
Last year, the Supreme Court held that injuries that “relate to” 
but do not “arise from” (in the sense of strict causation) a 
defendant’s in-state acts open that defendant up to personal 
jurisdiction in that state.  See Ford Motor Co., 141 S.Ct. at 
1026.  That is, acts of the defendant within the state do not 
need to be the cause of the plaintiff’s injury, as long as there 
is a sufficient relationship between the defendant and the 
forum. 
 Id.  
Consistent with the legislative intent identified in Cowan, 
Hawaiʻi’s long-arm statute incorporates this more permissive 
interpretation of due process.  We hold that Hawaiʻ i’s long-arm 
statute allows Hawaiʻ i courts to invoke personal jurisdiction to 
the full extent permitted by the due process clause.
  As long as 
federal due process is satisfied, under the long-arm statute a 
Hawaiʻi court may assert personal jurisdiction over an injury *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 that “relates to,” but does not “arise from,” a defendant’s in-
state acts. 
 In certifying this question, the Ninth Circuit panel 
spotlighted the two-step inquiry applied in our precedent.  See 
Norris v. Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc., 102 Hawaiʻ i 203, 207, 74 
P.3d 26, 30 (2003) (“Personal jurisdiction exists when (1) the 
defendant’s activity falls under the State’s long-arm statute, 
and (2) the application of the statute complies with 
constitutional due process.”).  If Hawaiʻ i’s  long-arm statute 
incorporates the limits of due process, why does the long-arm 
statute occupy a separate place in the personal jurisdiction 
analysis?  
Indeed, the Hawaiʻ i District Court has more than once 
observed that “the personal jurisdiction analysis under the 
Hawaii long-arm statute collapses into a single due process 
inquiry.” 
 Hueter v. Kruse, 576 F.Supp.3d 743, 765-66 (D. Haw. 
2021).  See also Lānaʻ i Resorts, LLC v. Maris Collective, Inc., 
No. CV 21-00401 HG-KJM, 2022 WL 3084574, at *4 (D. Haw. July 13, 
2022) (“The personal jurisdiction analysis under the Hawaii 
long-arm statute thus becomes a due process inquiry.”).  
Functionally, the two-step inquiry may in fact be 
redundant.  For instance, in Kailieha v. Hayes, a non-resident 
 
 
negligent medical prescription that resulted in an automobile 
crash in Honolulu.  56 Haw. 306, 307, 536 P.2d 568, 569 (1975).court over an allegedly Virginia doctor was sued in Hawaiʻi

 We first found that jurisdiction was proper under the long-arm 
statute because a tortious act, which includes the consequences 
of that act, was committed in the state.  Id.  But we ultimately 
held that due process under the Fourteenth Amendment was not 
satisfied, since the non-resident defendant did not have 
sufficient contacts with Hawaiʻ i.  Id. at 312, 536 P.2d at 572. 
As the more restrictive requirement, the personal jurisdiction 
issue could have been resolved in Kailieha by skipping straight 
to an examination of federal due process.  
To the extent that this collapsed inquiry yields the same 
practical result as the two-step test, the method currently used 
by the District Court in Hawaiʻ i i s not improper.  But there is 
value in remembering that personal jurisdiction rests on both 
negative federal limits and positive state assertions of jurisdiction.  
That the legislature has chosen to align the 
inquiry into personal jurisdiction in Hawaiʻ i with an inquiry 
into constitutional due process limits does not mean this must always be the case.
