RECKTENWALD, C.J., McKENNA, AND EDDINS, JJ., 
CIRCUIT JUDGE TONAKI AND CIRCUIT JUDGE CATALDO, 
ASSIGNED BY REASON OF VACANCIES 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
I. 
The United States District Court for the District of Hawaiʻ i 
certified two questions to this court. 
We accepted those 
questions per Hawaiʻ i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 13.  
The federal court’s order frames the issue: “[W]hether the 
State of Hawaiʻ i authorizes the equitable reimbursement of 
defense fees and costs incurred by an insurer in litigating on 
behalf of its insured.” 
The court asks: 
(1) Under Hawaiʻ i law, may an insurer seek equitable 
reimbursement from an insured for defense fees and costs 
when the applicable insurance policy contains no express 
provision for such reimbursement, but the insurer agrees to 
defend the insured subject to a reservation of rights, including reimbursement of defense fees and costs? 
(2) If an insurer may seek equitable reimbursement of 
defense fees and costs under Hawaiʻ i law, (A) for what 
specific fees and costs may the insurer obtain 
reimbursement, (B) which party carries the burden of proof, 
and (C) what is the burden of proof? 
 We answer question 1 No. 
We do not answer question 2. 
 We hold that an insurer may not recover defense costs for 
defended claims unless the insurance policy contains an express reimbursement provision. A reservation of rights letter will 
not do. 
II. 
If there’s the possibility of coverage, there’s a duty to 
defend. See Dairy Rd. Partners v. Island Ins. Co., Ltd., 92 
Hawaiʻi 398, 412,
 992 P.2d 93, 107 (2000). The “possibility may 
2  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
be remote, but if it exists the [insurer] owes the insured a 
defense.” Standard Oil Co. of Cal. v. Hawaiian Ins. & Guaranty
Co., Ltd., 65 Haw. 521, 526, 654 P.2d 1345, 1349 (1982) (cleaned up). 
 As long as a complaint alleges one claim that the policy 
possibly covers, the duty to defend absorbs all claims. Finley
v. Home Ins. Co., 90 Hawaiʻ i 25, 29, 975 P.2d 1145, 1149 (1998).  
 Some jurisdictions allow insurers to recoup defense costs 
for defending uncovered claims. 
See, e.g., Buss v. Superior 
Court, 939 P.2d 766 (Cal. 1997). 
Other jurisdictions do not. See, e.g., Am. & Foreign Ins. 
Co. v. Jerry’s Sport Ctr., Inc., 2 A.3d 526, 543 (Pa. 2010). 
Neither this court, nor Hawaiʻi’s federal district court has 
decided the repayment issue. Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Sullivan
Properties, Inc. came close, predicting this court would find a 
right to reimbursement. No. 04-00550 HG-BMK, 2007 WL 2247795, 
at *3 (D. Haw. Aug. 2, 2007). Other cases from our federal 
district court have dampened that forecast. See Exec. Risk
Indem., Inc. v. Pac. Educ. Servs., Inc., 451 F. Supp. 2d 1147, 
1163 (D. Haw. 2006); Choy v. Cont’l Cas. Co., No. 15-00281 
SOM/KSC, 2015 WL 7588233, at *10 (D. Haw. Nov. 25, 2015); GGA, 
Inc. v. Kiewit Infrastructure W. Co., 611 F. Supp. 3d 1000, 1031 
(D. Haw. 2020).

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
We reject a putative right to reimbursement for defense 
fees and costs. Hawaiʻi’s stout duty to defend clashes with 
repayment. So we side with policyholders and hold that insurers 
do not have a right to reimbursement of defense costs. 
Three main reasons shape our decision. 
First, the initial 
contract governs. See Dairy Rd. Partners, 92 Hawaiʻ i at 411–12, 
992 P.2d at 106-07. Second, reimbursement erodes the duty to defend. See First Ins. Co. of Haw., Inc. v. State, by Minami
, 
66 Haw. 413, 416, 665 P.2d 648, 651 (1983). Third, the insured is not unjustly enriched. See Small v. Badenhop
, 67 Haw. 626, 
635-36, 701 P.2d 647, 654 (1985). 
A. 
The initial contract governs. Mutual understanding and consent animate a contract’s 
terms. See Moss v. Am. Int’l Adjustment Co., Inc., 86 Hawaiʻ i 
59, 63, 947 P.2d 371, 375 (1997). An insurance policy is a 
contract. 
“[I]nsurance policies are subject to the general 
rules of contract construction.” Dairy Rd. Partners
, 92 Hawaiʻi 
at 411, 992 P.2d at 106 (cleaned up). 
When a court interprets an insurance policy it reads the 
contract to the policyholder’s advantage. 
A while ago this 
court – talking about insurance policies - said it had “long 
subscribed to the principle that they must be construed 
liberally in favor of the insured and any ambiguities must be 
4  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
resolved against the insurer.” Tri-S Corp. v. W. World Ins.
Co., 110 Hawaiʻ i  473, 489, 135 P.3d 82, 98 (2006). 
The possibility of coverage typically depends on the 
policy’s language. 
The contract’s words. Or its missing words. 
See Hawaiian Holiday Macadamia Nut Co., Inc. v. Indus. Indem.Co.
, 76 Hawaiʻ i 166, 169, 872 P.2d 230, 233 (1994) (“Because the 
insurer’s duty to defend its insured is contractual in nature, 
we must look to the language of the policy involved to determine 
the scope of that duty.”). 
Here, the federal district court - in a declaratory 
judgment action - found a duty to defend. Like most standard 
insurance policies, the words called for defense. And no words 
called for pay back. 
A reservation of rights letter reinforces defenses and 
exclusions placed in the contract. “[A]ffording an insured a defense under a reservation of rights agreement merely retains 
any defenses the insurer has under its policy.” First Ins., 66 
Haw. at 422, 665 P.2d at 654. 
Insurers may reserve contractual rights, not create new 
ones. “[P]ermitting reimbursement by reservation of rights, absent an insurance policy provision authorizing the right in 
the first place, is tantamount to allowing the insurer to 
extract a unilateral amendment to the insurance contract.” Jerry’s Sport, 2 A.3d at 544. A reservation of rights letter 
5  
  
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
does not alter policy coverage or remake a contract. It “does not relieve the insurer of the costs incurred in defending its 
insured where the insurer was obligated, in the first instance, 
to provide such a defense.” First Ins., 66 Haw. at 422, 665 
P.2d at 654. 
Hawaiʻi statutory law favors the policyholder and supports 
the primacy of the contract. Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 431:10-220(a) reads: “No agreement in conflict with, 
modifying, or extending any contract of insurance shall be valid 
unless in writing and made a part of the policy.” And HRS 
§ 431:10-220(b) instructs: “No insurer or its representatives 
shall make any insurance contract or agreement relative thereto 
that is not plainly expressed in the policy.” 
Most policies call for a duty to defend. If an insurance 
contract has no express right to reimbursement, there’s no reimbursement. 
B. 
Reimbursement erodes the duty to defend. 
The duty to defend and the duty to indemnify differ. 
“[T]he obligation of an insurer to defend its insured is separate and distinct from an insurer’s obligation to pay a 
judgment entered against its insured.” First Ins., 66 Haw. at 
416, 665 P.2d at 651. 
6  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. 
Hawaiian Holiday, 76 Hawaiʻ i at 169, 872 P.2d at 233.  An insurer 
only indemnifies covered claims. Tri-S Corp., 110 Hawaiʻ i at 
488, 135 P.3d at 97. But an insurer must defend when there is 
possible coverage, even “groundless, false, or fraudulent” claims. First Ins.
, 66 Haw. at 417, 665 P.2d at 652. And the 
insurer has to defend mixed actions: some claims covered, others 
not. Finley
, 90 Hawaiʻ i at 29, 975 P.2d at 1149.  “[T]he insurer 
is obligated to provide a defense against the allegations of 
covered as well as the noncovered claims.” First Ins., 66 Haw. 
at 418, 665 P.2d at 652. 
Hawaiʻi’s duty to
 defend is determined up front, at the 
start. Not the end. See Nautilus Ins. Co. v. Lexington Ins.
Co.
, 132 Hawaiʻi 283, 303, 321 P.3d 634, 654 (2014). “Although 
an insurer’s duty to indemnify arises only after damages are 
fixed, the duty to defend arises as soon as damages are sought.” 
Gen. Agents Ins. Co. of Am., Inc. v. Midwest Sporting Goods Co.
, 
828 N.E.2d 1092, 1103 (Ill. 2005). When a claim may fit a contract’s confines, “the insurance company’s refusal to defend 
at the outset of the controversy is a decision it makes at its 
own peril.” Jerry’s Sport, 2 A.3d at 542. 
If insurers recover for defending uncovered claims, our law 
flips: the duty to defend may be determined after the insurer 
tenders a defense. Not only does this sequence narrow the broad 
7  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
duty to defend, it dilutes an insurer’s good faith duty to take 
on a defense; worse it may bring on bad faith. “[A]llowing an 
insurer to exercise an independent right to reimbursement . . . 
before it obtains a declaratory judgment would be wholly 
inconsistent with and likely constitute a breach of, its duty 
under established law to undertake the defense in good faith.” 
Burlington Ins. Co. v. Panacorp. Inc., 758 F. Supp. 2d 1121, 
1141 (D. Haw. 2010). 
Reimbursement for defense costs undercuts the duty to 
defend. “It would amount to a retroactive erosion of the broad 
duty to defend . . . by making the right and duty to defend contingent upon a court’s determination that a complaint alleged covered claims.” Jerry’s Sport, 2 A.3d at 544. Letting the 
insurer recoup costs “would effectively require that insurers only defend to the same extent that they must ultimately 
indemnify.” Gen. Star Indem. Co. v. Driven Sports, Inc., 80 F. 
Supp. 3d 442, 463 (E.D.N.Y. 2015). As far as an insured, rather 
than protection for all possible claims, they are only protected from repaying costs for claims eventually deemed covered. 
Insurers though are not out of luck. As part of doing 
business, insurers assess claims for potential coverage. If 
insurers are unsure, they can go to court. Jerry’s Sport, 2 
A.3d at 542.

C. 
 Last, the insurers say that when they defend uncovered 
claims, policyholders are unjustly enriched. We disagree. 
Defense is part of the deal. 
 By nature, contracts benefit both sides. Though it owes a 
duty to defend, the insurer benefits. It retains the premiums. It directs litigation. It runs the case, decision-making-wise. 
Why? Money. 
Since the insurer faces indemnity exposure, 
it deserves what it bargained for – near total control over a case. “Normally, an insurer’s duty to defend is coupled with 
the right to control the defense of the litigation. . . . 
Giving the insurer exclusive control over litigation against the 
insured safeguards the orderly and proper disbursement of the 
large sums of money involved in the insurance business.” 
Finley
, 90 Hawaiʻi at 34 n.11, 975 P.2d at 1154 n.11. 
An insurance company that tenders a defense protects 
itself, at least as much as it protects its insured. See
General Agents
, 828 N.E.2d at 1103. No scrubs, say the 
insurers. An insurer has the right to defend its own way to 
avoid the risks of “an inept or lackadaisical defense of the 
underlying action.” Terra Nova Ins. Co., Ltd. v. 900 Bar, Inc., 
887 F.2d 1213, 1219 (3d Cir. 1989). 
If we allowed reimbursement, the unjustly enriched party 
may very well be the insurer. When the insured pays back 
9  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
defense costs to the insurer, it pays for the insurer to protect 
itself. Id.If a court later determines that there is no duty 
to defend, then reimbursement protects the insurer from bad faith or breach of contract actions - without any responsibility 
for defense costs. See Nat’l Sur. Corp. v. Immunex Corp., 297 
P.3d 688, 694 (Wash. 2013). An “all reward, no risk” proposition creates a win-win situation for the insurer: 
buffered from bad faith, it defends all claims, yet has no obligation to pay for the whole defense. Meanwhile, the insured 
“receives no greater benefit than if its insurer had refused to 
defend outright.” Id.
What does the policyholder get for ceding control? 
Defense. The insured receives a benefit. But it’s not unjust. 
Both sides benefit. 
The insurance companies argue that the sky will fall and a 
world without a right to reimbursement is “rife with temptation 
to deny . . . costly and questionable claims.” But insurers are seasoned, skilled, and well positioned to evaluate whether they 
need to defend. And bad faith or breach actions motivate them 
to honor contractual obligations. See Best Place, Inc. v. Penn
Am. Ins. Co., 82 Hawaiʻ i 120, 131-32, 920 P.2d 334, 345-46 
(1996).

 III. 
 An insurer may not seek reimbursement from an insured for 
defending claims when an insurance policy contains no express 
provision for reimbursement.
