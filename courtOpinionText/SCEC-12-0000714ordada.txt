KHISTINA CALDWELL DEJEAN, Plaintiff,
 
vs.
 
SCOTT NAGO, Chief Election Officer, Office of Elections,
State of Hawai' i; and DAVID M. LOUIE, Attorney General,
State of Hawai' i, Defendants.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the document entitled “Appeal
 
Order” filed by plaintiff Khistina Caldwell DeJean on October 26,
 
2012, which we construe as a motion for reconsideration of the
 August 23, 2012 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and
 Judgment, and the record, it appears that the request for
 reconsideration is untimely. See HRAP 40(a) (“A motion for
 
reconsideration may be filed by a party only within 10 days after
 the filing of the opinion, dispositional order, or ruling unless
 by special leave additional time is granted during such period by
 a judge or justice of the appellate court involved.”). 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, November 1, 2012.
