ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of plaintiff Khistina Caldwell
 
DeJean’s motion for reconsideration, filed November 2, 2012, the
 
documents submitted in support thereof, and the record, it
 appears that the motion for reconsideration is untimely. See
 
HRAP 40(a) (“A motion for reconsideration may be filed by a party
 only within 10 days after the filing of the opinion,
 dispositional order, or ruling unless by special leave additional
 time is granted during such period by a judge or justice of the
 appellate court involved.”). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for
 
reconsideration is dismissed.
 IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk of the
 
appellate court shall not accept any further filings in this
 
closed case.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, November 13, 2012.
