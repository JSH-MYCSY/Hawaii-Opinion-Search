ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND JUDGMENT
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna and Pollack, JJ.)
 
We have considered the August 16, 2012 election
 
complaint filed by Plaintiff Martin Han and the declaration and
 
documents appended thereto, and the August 23, 2012 motion to
 dismiss filed by Defendant Scott Nago. Having heard this matter
 without oral argument and in accordance with HRS § 11-173.5(b)
 (2009) (requiring the supreme court to “give judgment fully
 stating all findings of fact and of law”), we set forth the
 following findings of fact and conclusions of law and enter the
 following judgment.
 FINDINGS OF FACT
 
1. Plaintiff Martin Han (“Han”) was one of three
 
candidates for the District 7 seat on the Honolulu City Council
 
in the August 11, 2012 first special election for the City and
 County of Honolulu, which was held on conjunction with the
 primary election.
 
2. The election results for the District 7 seat on the
 
Honolulu City Council were: (1) Joey Manahan: 7,123 votes
 (51.0%); (2) Martin Han: 3,469 votes (24.8%); and (3) Lillian
 Hong: 1,784 votes (12.8%).
 
3. On August 16, 2012, Han filed a complaint 
challenging the election results. Han named Joey Manahan (“Manahan”), his opponent in the election, Romy Cachola (“Cachola”), the current District 7 councilmember who was unable to run for a seat on the Honolulu City Council due to term limits but ran as a Democratic candidate for the District 30 seat in the State House of Representatives, and Scott Nago (“Nago”), the chief election officer for the State of Hawai
'i, as defendants. 
The record, however, is devoid of any evidence that the city clerk for the City and County of Honolulu was named a defendant. 
4. Han contends that Manahan received an increase in 
votes by violating Hawai
'i’s electioneering law (HRS § 11-132 
(2009)) and “work[ing] together for votes” with Cachola. 
5. Han alleges that: (a) Manahan violated HRS § 11­
-2­132 by displaying campaign posters less than two hundred feet
 
from two polling places on the day of the election; (b) Manahan
 violated HRS § 11-132 by “purposefully le[aving] his campaign
 signs within the 200 foot perimeter of two polling areas to
 influence the approximately 40% undecided voters;” and (c) the
 “unusually high amount of absentee ballots in Representative
 District Precinct 30-02 . . . may indicate voter fraud in
 District 7”.
 
6. Han seeks the following relief: (a) Judgment
 
ordering that Han’s name appear on the ballot for the November 6,
 2012 general election; (b) Judgment ordering the Office of
 Elections to review and compare the absentee voter names for the
 absentee votes that Manahan and Cachola received from
 Representative District Precinct 30-02; (c) Judgment ordering the
 Office of Elections to review the absentee ballots for the
 absentee votes that Manahan and Cachola received from
 Representative District Precinct 30-02 for actual signatures
 compared to an “X” marking; (d) Judgment ordering that the
 absentee voters from Representative District Precinct 30-02 who
 voted for Manahan and Cachola be interviewed “to determine if
 their ballots were handled correctly or if there was any coercion
 by any public official or persons acting on behalf of a public
 official;” (e) Judgment ordering that the absentee ballots from
 Representative Precinct 32-02 be reviewed and recounted; (f)
 
-3­  Judgment finding that Manahan and Nago violated HRS § 11-132; and
 
(g) “[O]ther judicial determinations and orders necessary to
 effectuate Defendant Manahan and Defendant Nago’s responsibility
 in the violation of HRS § 11-132.”
 
7. Defendant Nago moved to dismiss the complaint for
 
failure to name a necessary and indispensable party and failure
 to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. 
8. Defendants Manahan and Cachola were served with the
 
complaint and summons on August 24, 2012 and August 25, 2012,
 respectively. The time for them to respond has not yet expired
 but neither response is necessary to the resolution of the
 election complaint.
 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
1. HRS § 11-172 provides that a copy of the complaint
 
for an election contest “shall be delivered to the chief election
 officer or the clerk in the case of county elections.” 
2. HRCP Rule 19(a)(1) provides that “[a] person who is
 
subject to service of process shall be joined as a party in the
 action if [] in the person’s absence complete relief cannot be
 accorded among those already parties[.]”
 
3. An election for councilmember for the Honolulu City 
Council is a county election administered by the city clerk for
 the City and County of Honolulu. The city clerk for the City and
 County of Honolulu is, therefore, a necessary and indispensable
 
-4­party who should have been named as a defendant and served with a
 
copy of the complaint. The record, however, is devoid of any
 evidence that the city clerk for the City and County of Honolulu
 was named a defendant and served with a copy of the complaint and
 summons.
 
4. Even if the city clerk for the City and County
 
of Honolulu was named or joined as a defendant and served with a
 copy of the complaint, the complaint fails to state claims upon
 which relief can be granted.
 
5. When reviewing a motion to dismiss a complaint for 
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the court must accept plaintiff’s allegations as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff; dismissal is proper only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that would entitle him or her to relief. AFL Hotel & Restaurant Workers Health & 
Welfare Trust Fund v. Bosque, 110 Hawai
'i 318, 321, 132 P.3d 
1229, 1232 (2006). 
6. A complaint challenging the results of a primary 
election pursuant to HRS § 11-172 fails to state a claim unless the plaintiff demonstrates errors, mistakes or irregularities that would change the outcome of the election. Tataii v. Cronin, 
119 Hawai
'i 337, 339, 198 P.3d 124, 126 (2008); Akaka v. Yoshina, 
84 Hawai 'i 383, 387, 935 P.2d 98, 102 (1997); Funakoshi v. King, 
-5­65 Haw. 312, 317, 651 P.2d 912, 915 (1982); Elkins v. Ariyoshi,
 
56 Haw. 47, 48, 527 P.2d 236, 237 (1974).
 
7. A plaintiff challenging a primary election must 
show that he or she has actual information of mistakes or errors sufficient to change the result. Tataii v. Cronin, 119 Hawai
'i 
at 339, 198 P.3d at 126; Akaka v. Yoshina, 84 Hawai 'i at 388, 935 
P.2d at 103; Funakoshi v. King, 65 Haw. at 316-317, 651 P.2d at 915.
 
8. It is not sufficient for a plaintiff challenging an 
election to allege a poorly run and inadequately supervised election process that evinces room for abuse or possibilities of fraud. An election contest cannot be based upon mere belief or indefinite information. Tataii v. Cronin, 119 Hawai
'i at 339, 
198 P.3d at 126; Akaka v. Yoshina, 84 Hawai 'i at 387-388, 935 
P.2d at 102-103. 
9. Taking Han’s allegations as true and viewing them
 
in the light most favorable to him, it appears that Han can prove
 no set of facts that would entitle him to relief inasmuch as Han
 has failed to present specific acts or “actual information of
 mistakes or error sufficient to change the results of the
 election.” 
10. Possible electioneering at two polling places on
 
the day of the election, which Han admits were rectified by mid­morning, does not amount to actual information of mistakes or
 
-6­errors sufficient to change the primary election results for the
 
District 7 seat on the Honolulu City Council.
 
11. The possibility that Manahan’s campaign signs
 
within the 200 foot perimeter of two polling areas may have
 influenced approximately 40% of the undecided voters and the
 possibility that an unusually high amount of absentee ballots in
 Representative District Precinct 30-02 may indicate voter fraud
 do not demonstrate that the results of the primary election for
 the District 7 seat on the Honolulu City Council would have
 changed. 
12. According to HRS § 11-173.5(b), in a primary
 
election challenge, the supreme court has authority to decide
 which candidate was nominated or elected. Funakoshi v. King, 65
 
Haw. at 316, 651 P.2d at 914.
 
13. Under the circumstances of this case, Han is not
 
entitled to the remedies he seeks.
 
JUDGMENT
 
Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and
 
conclusions of law, judgment is entered dismissing the complaint. 
Joey Manahan received 51.0% of the votes for the District 7 seat
 on the Honolulu City Council in the August 11, 2012 election and
 is automatically deemed elected. 
The clerk of the supreme court shall forthwith serve a
 
certified copy of this judgment on the chief election officer and 
-7­city clerk in accordance with HRS § 11-173.5(b).
