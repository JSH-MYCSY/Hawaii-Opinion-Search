"HOPE FOR PUNA" HOPE LOUISE CERMELJ, Non-Partisan
Candidate for the State House of Rep. Dist. 4, Plaintiff,
 
vs.
 
County Clerk, JAMAE K.K. KAWAUCHI, and
SCOTT NAGO, Chief Election Officer for the

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND JUDGMENT
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna and Pollack, JJ.)
 
We have considered the August 20, 2012 election
 
complaint filed by Plaintiff Hope Louise Cermelj and the
 
documents appended thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
 the August 24, 2012 motion to dismiss filed by Defendant Scott
 Nago. Having heard this matter without oral argument and in
 accordance with HRS § 11-173.5(b) (2009) (requiring the supreme
 court to “give judgment fully stating all findings of fact and of
 law”), we set forth the following findings of fact and
 conclusions of law and enter the following judgment.
 FINDINGS OF FACT
 
1. Plaintiff Hope Louise Cermelj (“Cermelj”) was one
 
of three candidates (two nonpartisan candidates and one
 
democratic candidate; there was no republican candidate) running
 for the office of state representative, district 4 in the August
 11, 2012 primary election. 
2. The election results for the office of state
 
representative, district 4 were:
 
NonPartisan Candidates
 
Hope Louise Cermelj  35 
Moke Stephens  32 
Blank Votes  26 
Over Votes  0
 
Democratic Candidate
 Faye P. Hanohano 3,373
Blank Votes 1,358
Over Votes  0 
3. On August 20, 2012, Cermelj filed a complaint 
challenging the election results. 
Cermelj named Jamae K.K. 
Kawauchi (“Kawauchi”), the county clerk for the Island of 
Hawai'i, and Scott Nago (“Nago”), the chief election officer for 
the State of Hawai 'i, as defendants. 
4. Cermelj alleges that she “has been discriminated
 
against by freedom of speech and freedom of the press in [her]
 non[]partis[]an run for State House, District 4.” 
5. Cermelj seeks judgment from this court ordering a
 
recount of the votes received by Faye Hanahano, a recount of the
 blank votes received for the Democratic party, and a recount of
 the votes she and her opponent, Moke Stephens, received as the
 
2
 nonpartisan candidates.
 
6. Defendant Nago moved to dismiss the complaint for
 
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. 
7. Kawauchi did not file a response and there is no
 
indication in the record that she was served with the complaint
 
and summons. A response from Kawauchi, however, is not necessary
 to the resolution of Cermelj’s complaint. 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
1. When reviewing a motion to dismiss a complaint for 
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the court must accept plaintiff’s allegations as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff; dismissal is proper only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that would entitle him or her to relief. AFL Hotel & Restaurant Workers Health & 
Welfare Trust Fund v. Bosque, 110 Hawai
'i 318, 321, 132 P.3d 
1229, 1232 (2006). 
2. A complaint challenging the results of a primary 
election pursuant to HRS § 11-172 fails to state a claim unless the plaintiff demonstrates errors, mistakes or irregularities that would change the outcome of the election. Tataii v. Cronin, 
119 Hawai
'i 337, 339, 198 P.3d 124, 126 (2008); Akaka v. Yoshina, 
84 Hawai 'i 383, 387, 935 P.2d 98, 102 (1997); Funakoshi v. King, 
65 Haw. 312, 317, 651 P.2d 912, 915 (1982); Elkins v. Ariyoshi, 56 Haw. 47, 48, 527 P.2d 236, 237 (1974). 
3. A plaintiff challenging a primary election must
 
3
 show that he or she has actual information of mistakes or errors
 
sufficient to change the result. Tataii v. Cronin, 119 Hawai 'i 
at 339, 198 P.3d at 126; Akaka v. Yoshina, 84 Hawai 'i at 388, 935 
P.2d at 103; Funakoshi v. King, 65 Haw. at 316-317, 651 P.2d at 915.
 
4. An election contest cannot be based upon mere 
belief or indefinite information. Tataii v. Cronin, 119 Hawai
'i 
at 339, 198 P.3d at 126; Akaka v. Yoshina, 84 Hawai 'i at 387-388, 
935 P.2d at 102-103. 
5. Taking Cermelj’s allegations as true and viewing
 
them in the light most favorable to her, it appears that Cermelj
 can prove no set of facts that would entitle her to relief
 inasmuch as Cermelj has failed to present specific acts or actual
 information of mistakes, error or irregularities sufficient to
 change the results of the election. 
6. Alleged discrimination of freedom of speech and
 
freedom of the press does not amount to actual information of
 mistakes, errors or irregularities sufficient to change the
 primary election results for the office of state representative,
 district 4.
 
7. According to HRS § 11-173.5(b), in a primary
 
election challenge, the supreme court has authority to decide
 which candidate was nominated or elected. Funakoshi v. King, 65
 
Haw. at 316, 651 P.2d at 914.
 
8. Under the circumstances of this case, Cermelj is
 
not entitled to the remedy she seeks.
 
4
 JUDGMENT
 
Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and
 
conclusions of law, judgment is entered dismissing the complaint. 
Because neither Hope Louise Cermelj nor Moke Stephens received
 the minimum votes required under HRS § 12-41(b) (2009) for
 nonpartisan candidates to advance to the November 6, 2012 general
 election, and there was no republican candidate, Faye Hanahano,
 the democratic candidate for the office of state representative,
 district 4, is deemed elected. 
The clerk of the supreme court shall forthwith serve a
 
certified copy of this judgment on the chief election officer in
 accordance with HRS § 11-173.5(b).
