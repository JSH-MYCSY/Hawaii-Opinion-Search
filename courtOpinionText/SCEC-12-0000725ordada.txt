ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND JUDGMENT
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna and Pollack, JJ.)
 
We have considered (1) the August 21, 2012 election 
complaint filed by Plaintiff Kaleihikina “Kalei” Akaka, (2) the 
August 27, 2012 motion to dismiss filed by Defendants Scott Nago, Chief Election Officer, and Governor Neil Abercrombie, and the declaration and document appended thereto and submitted in support thereof, (3) the August 27, 2012 motion to dismiss filed by Defendants Jamae Kawauchi, County of Hawai
'i Clerk, and the 
Office of the Clerk, Hawai 'i County, and (4) the August 28, 2012 joinder filed by Defendant Nicole Lowen. Having considered this
 
matter without oral argument and in accordance with HRS § 11­173.5(b) (2009) (requiring the supreme court to “give judgment
 fully stating all findings of fact and of law”), we set forth the
 following findings of fact and conclusions of law and enter the
 following judgment.
 
FINDINGS OF FACT
 
1. Defendant Kaleihikina “Kalei” Akaka (“Akaka”) was
 
one of four Democratic Party candidates running for the office of
 state representative, district 6, in the August 11, 2012 primary
 election. 
2. The election results for the Democratic Party race
 
for the office of state representative, district 6 were:
 
Nicole Lowen 1,067 (30.2%)
Kalei Akaka 1,022 (29.0%)
Bucky Leslie  734 (20.8%)
Fred Housel  461 (13.1%)
Blank Votes  243 ( 6.9%)
Over Votes  2 ( 0.1%)
 
3. On August 11, 2012, Governor Neil Abercrombie 
(“Governor Abercrombie”) issued an Election Proclamation extending the polling hours for the County of Hawai
'i until 7:30 
p.m. pursuant to Hawai 'i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 128-10(6), 
instead of HRS § 128-9(6). 
4. Akaka challenged the election results by filing a
 
complaint in this court on August 21, 2012. Akaka named 
Fred Housel (“Housel”), Nicole Lowen (“Lowen”) and Bucky Leslie
 
-2­(“Leslie”), her Democratic Party opponents, as defendants. She 
also named Scott Nago (“Nago”), the Chief Election Officer for the State of Hawai
'i, Governor Abercrombie, Jamae Kawauchi 
(“Kawauchi”), the County Clerk for the County of Hawai 'i, and the 
Office of the Clerk, Hawai 'i County (“Hawai 'i County Clerk’s 
Office”), as defendants. 
5. The complaint alleges that (a) Governor 
Abercrombie lacked authority under HRS § 128-10(6) to extend the polling hours, (b) the ballots for district 6 were “miscounted . . . or otherwise mishandled” by the Office of Elections, the Chief Election Officer, the Hawai
'i County Clerk’s Office, and 
the Hawai 'i County Clerk, and (c) the late opening of the polls 
contributed to “massive voting conduct irregularities[,] which resulted in the wrongful extension of the statutory hours of voting which then caused invalid ballots and votes to be cast and inextricably intermingled with valid ballots and votes cast.” Akaka contends that the claimed events could cause or could have caused a difference in the election results. 
6. Akaka seeks judgment from this court (a) ordering
 
a new Democratic Party election for the office of state
 representative, district 6, (b) ordering a manual recount of the
 ballots for the office of state representative, district 6, and
 (c) ordering payment of her attorneys’ fees. 
7. Defendants Nago and Governor Abercrombie moved to
 
-3­dismiss the complaint as untimely and for failure to state a
 
claim upon which relief can be granted.
 
8. Defendants Kawauchi and the Hawai 'i County 
Clerk’s Office also moved to dismiss the complaint as untimely and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. 
9. Defendant Lowen joined in the motions filed by 
Nago, Governor Abercrombie, Kawauchi and the Hawai
'i County 
Clerk’s Office 
10. Neither Defendants Housel nor Leslie have filed
 
responses and there is no indication in the record demonstrating
 that they were served with the complaint and summons. Responses
 from Housel and Leslie, however, are not necessary to the
 resolution of Akaka’s complaint. 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
I. 
1. HRS § 11-173.5(a) (2009) provides that a complaint
 
challenging a primary election “shall be filed in the office of
 the clerk of the supreme court not later than 4:30 p.m. on the
 sixth day after a primary [] election[.]” 
2. “‘Where the language of a statute is plain and 
unambiguous that a specific time provision must be met, it is mandatory and not merely directory.’” Tataii v. Cronin, 119 
Hawai
'i 337, 339, 198 P.3d 124, 126 (2008) (quoting Coon v. City 
-4­and County of Honolulu, 98 Hawai 'i 233, 255, 47 P.3d 348, 370 
(2002)).
 
3. “‘In determining whether a statute is mandatory or
 
directory, the intent of the legislature must be ascertained.’” 
Tataii v. Cronin, 119 Hawai 'i at 339, 198 P.3d at 126 (quoting 
State v. Himuro, 70 Haw. 103, 105, 761 P.2d 1148, 1149 (1988)).
 
4. The “sixth day” provision of HRS § 11-173.5(a) is
 
mandatory and this construction is consistent with the
 legislature’s objective to enable the State of Hawai
'i Office of 
Elections to expeditiously administer elections. See Sen. Conf.
 
Comm. Rep. No. 17-74, 1974 Senate Journal at 770. 
5. HRS § 1-29, which governs the computation of time
 
for any acts prescribed by law, such as HRS § 11-173.5, provides: 
The time in which any act provided by law is to
be done is computed by excluding the first day and
including the last, unless the last day is a Sunday or
holiday and then it is also excluded. When so
 provided by the rules of court, the last day also
shall be excluded if it is a Saturday.
 
6. Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (“HRAP”) Rule 
26(a) provides: 
In computing any period of time prescribed by
these rules, an order of court, or any applicable
statute, the day of the act, event, or default from
which the designated period of time begins to run
shall not be included. The last day of the period
shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or
a legal holiday, in which event the period extends
until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday,
a Sunday, or a legal holiday. When the period of time
prescribed or allowed is less than 7 days, any
intervening Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday shall
be excluded in the computation.
 
7. Under HRS § 602-11 (1993), the court is
 
-5­empowered to promulgate court rules, but it does not have the
 
power to make rules that “abridge, enlarge, or modify [. . .] the
 jurisdiction of any of the courts, nor affect any statute of
 limitations.”
 
8. Therefore, HRAP Rule 26(a)’s “less than 7 days”
 
language does not extend the filing deadline under HRS § 11-173.5
 and the deadline for filing an election challenge was
 Monday, August 20, 2012. Akaka’s complaint is untimely.
 
II. 
9. Even if Akaka had timely filed her complaint, it 
fails to state claims upon which relief can be granted.
 
10. When reviewing a motion to dismiss a complaint for 
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the court must accept plaintiff’s allegations as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff; dismissal is proper only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that would entitle him or her to relief. AFL Hotel & Restaurant Workers Health & 
Welfare Trust Fund v. Bosque, 110 Hawai
'i 318, 321, 132 P.3d 
1229, 1232 (2006). 
11. A complaint challenging the results of a primary
 
election pursuant to HRS § 11-172 fails to state a claim unless
 the plaintiff demonstrates errors, mistakes or irregularities
 that would change the outcome of the election. Tataii v. Cronin,
 
-6­119 Hawai 'i at 339, 198 P.3d at 126; Akaka v. Yoshina, 84 Hawai 'i 
383, 387, 935 P.2d 98, 102 (1997); Funakoshi v. King, 65 Haw. 
312, 317, 651 P.2d 912, 915 (1982); Elkins v. Ariyoshi, 56 Haw. 47, 48, 527 P.2d 236, 237 (1974). 
12. A plaintiff challenging a primary election must 
show that he or she has actual information of mistakes or errors sufficient to change the result. Tataii v. Cronin, 119 Hawai
'i 
at 339, 198 P.3d at 126; Akaka v. Yoshina, 84 Hawai 'i at 388, 935 
P.2d at 103; Funakoshi v. King, 65 Haw. at 316-317, 651 P.2d at 915.
 
13. An election contest cannot be based upon mere 
belief or indefinite information. Tataii v. Cronin, 119 Hawai
'i 
at 339, 198 P.3d at 126; Akaka v. Yoshina, 84 Hawai 'i at 387-388, 
935 P.2d at 102-103. 
14. Taking Akaka’s allegations as true and viewing
 
them in the light most favorable to her, it appears that Akaka
 can prove no set of facts that would entitle her to relief
 because Akaka has failed to present specific acts or actual
 information of mistakes, error or irregularities sufficient to
 change the results of the election. 
15. The Election Proclamation’s typographical error in 
referring to HRS § 128-10(6) is harmless because the Governor has
 authority to extend voting hours in emergency situations pursuant
 to HRS § 128-9(6), and this does not amount to actual information
 
-7­of mistakes, errors or irregularities sufficient to change the
 
primary election results for the office of state representative,
 district 6.
 
16. Moreover, allegations that (a) miscounting
 
of votes due to a discrepancy in the number of ballots, and (b)
 the late opening of the polls, which resulted in the governor
 extending the voting hours and campaigns contacting supporters,
 many of whom were “likely supporters of [defendant] Lowen rather
 than [plaintiff] Akaka” and urging them to vote, all of which
 could have caused a difference in the election results, do not
 amount to actual information of mistakes, errors or
 irregularities sufficient to change the primary election results
 for the office of state representative, district 6.
 
17. According to HRS § 11-173.5(b), in a primary
 
election challenge, the supreme court has authority to decide
 which candidate was nominated or elected. Funakoshi v. King, 65
 
Haw. at 316, 651 P.2d at 914.
 
18. Under the circumstances of this case, Akaka is not
 
entitled to the remedy she seeks.
 
JUDGMENT
 
Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and
 
conclusions of law, judgment is entered dismissing the complaint. 
Nicole Lowen received the highest number of votes in the
 Democratic Party race for the office of state representative,
 
-8­district 6 in the primary election and shall advance to the
 
general election. 
The clerk of the supreme court shall forthwith serve a
 
certified copy of this judgment on the chief election officer and
 the county clerk in accordance with HRS § 11-173.5(b).
