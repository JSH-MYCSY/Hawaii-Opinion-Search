ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND JUDGMENT
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
We have considered the election complaint filed by 
plaintiff pro se Danielle Ululani Beirne (“Beirne”) on November 
26, 2012, the motions to dismiss filed by defendants Brigham Young University-Hawai' i (“BYU-Hawai' i”), Polynesian Cultural 
Center (“PCC”) and Hawai' i Reserves, Inc. (“HRI”) and Richard 
Fale (“Fale”) on December 7, 2012 and December 10, 2012, respectively, the December 5, 2012 letter from Deputy Attorney General Robyn B. Chun (“Chun”), the response memorandum filed by Beirne on December 18, 2012, and the reply memorandum filed by BYU-Hawai' i, PCC and HRI on December 18, 2012. Having heard this 
matter without oral argument and in accordance with HRS § 11­
174.5(b) (2009) (requiring the supreme court to “give judgment, stating all findings of fact and of law”), we set forth the following findings of fact and conclusions of law and enter the following judgment. 
FINDINGS OF FACT
 
1. Beirne was the Democratic party candidate for the 
office of state representative, district 47 in the November 6,
 2012 general election. 
2. The election results for the race for the office
 
of state representative, district 47 were:
 
Richard Fale 4,381 (54.0%)
D. Ululani Beirne 3,163 (39.0%)
Blank Votes  560 ( 6.9%)
Over Votes  4 ( 0.0%)
 
3. Beirne challenged the election results by filing a 
complaint in the supreme court on November 26, 2012, which was the twentieth day after the November 6, 2012 general election. Beirne named her opponent, Fale, BYU-Hawai
'i, PCC, HRI and 
Honolulu Star-Advertiser (“Star-Advertiser”) writer Derrick De Pledge as defendants. 
4. The complaint alleges that Fale received more 
votes because BYU-Hawai' i, PCC, HRI and the Star-Advertiser 
“conspired and coerced to throw the electoral process in order for . . . Fale to win” inasmuch as (a) BYU-Hawai' i allegedly 
2
 allowed Fale to register students on campus to vote, (b) BYU­
Hawai'i allegedly provided Fale several campus appearances but 
did not give Beirne the same opportunity, (c) BYU-Hawai' i 
allegedly transported students to the polls to vote using the school’s vans and buses, (d) BYU-Hawai' i, PCC and HRI allegedly 
encouraged their staff and employees to vote for Fale, (e) poll observers and poll watchers allegedly contacted members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, told them which members did not vote, and asked them to drive those members to the polls to vote, (f) Beirne was allegedly never offered access to rallies held in Laie, and (g) the Star-Advertiser allegedly published a letter one day before the election which stated that Mitt Romney has the same values as the Laie Community. The complaint also alleges that the purported actions of BYU-Hawai' i 
violate the school’s tax-exempt status. 
5. BYU-Hawai' i, PCC and HRI moved to dismiss the 
complaint for (a) failure to name Scott T. Nago (“Nago”), the chief election officer, as a necessary and indispensable party, and (b) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. 
6. Fale moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to
 
state a claim upon which relief can be granted. 
7. The Star-Advertiser did not file a response to the
 
complaint. 
3
 8. By letter dated December 5, 2012, Deputy Attorney 
General Chun informed the court that neither the Office of 
Elections nor the State of Hawai' i were named defendants and, 
therefore, they will not file a response unless ordered by the court. The letter further stated that the election challenge lacks merit because “[Beirne] has not presented any evidence or information of mistakes or errors sufficient to change the result.” 
9. In response to the motions to dismiss, Beirne
 
states that she did not name Nago or the Office of Elections
 because she “do[es] not know the details of the law and [has]
 followed it to the extent [she] could understand[.]” 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
I. 
1. HRS § 11-172 (2009) provides that a complaint
 
challenging an election “shall be delivered to the chief election
 officer or the clerk in the case of county elections.” 
2. HRCP Rule 19(a)(1) provides that “[a] person who
 
is subject to service of process shall be joined as a party in
 the action if [] in the person’s absence complete relief cannot
 be accorded among those already parties[.]”
 
3. The election for representative of the State House
 
of Representatives is a State election administered by the chief
 election officer. The chief election officer, therefore, is a
 
4
 necessary and indispensable party who should have been named as a
 
defendant and served with a copy of the complaint and summons.
 The record, however, is devoid of any evidence that the chief
 election officer was named a defendant or served with a copy of
 the complaint and summons.
 
4. Even if the chief election officer was named
 
or joined as a defendant and properly served, Beirne’s complaint
 fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
 
II. 
5. When reviewing a motion to dismiss a complaint for 
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the court must accept the plaintiff’s allegations as true and view them in the light most favorable to him or her; dismissal is proper only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that would entitle him or her to relief. AFL Hotel & Restaurant Workers 
Health & Welfare Trust Fund v. Bosque, 110 Hawai' i 318, 321, 132 
P.3d 1229, 1232 (2006). 
6. A complaint challenging the results of a general 
election pursuant to HRS § 11-172 fails to state a claim unless the plaintiff demonstrates errors, mistakes or irregularities that would change the outcome of the election. Tataii v. Cronin, 
119 Hawai' i 337, 339, 198 P.3d 124, 126 (2008); Akaka v. Yoshina, 
84 Hawai' i 383, 387, 935 P.2d 98, 102 (1997); Funakoshi v. King, 
5
 65 Haw. 312, 317, 651 P.2d 912, 915 (1982); Elkins v. Ariyoshi,
 
56 Haw. 47, 48, 527 P.2d 236, 237 (1974).
 
7. A plaintiff challenging a general election must 
show that he or she has actual information of mistakes or errors sufficient to change the result. Tataii, 119 Hawai' i at 339, 198 
P.3d at 126; Akaka, 84 Hawai' i at 388, 935 P.2d at 103; 
Funakoshi, 65 Haw. at 316-317, 651 P.2d at 915. 
8. Taking Beirne’s allegations as true and viewing
 
them in the light most favorable to her, it appears that Beirne
 can prove no set of facts that would entitle her to relief. 
Beirne has failed to present specific facts or actual information
 of mistakes, error or irregularities sufficient to change the
 results of the general election or exceed the reported margin of
 votes between her and Fale. 
9. Allegations of (a) registering students to vote,
 
(b) allowing candidates on school campus, (c) transporting
 students to polling places to vote, (d) encouraging employees to
 vote for a particular candidate, (e) publishing political
 articles, and (f) holding rallies for one candidate do not
 demonstrate that the general election results for Beirne’s race
 would have been different had these alleged events not occurred.
 
10. Moreover, an unsubstantiated statement about the
 
purported improper action of the district 47 poll observers and
 poll watchers does not demonstrate actual fraud or mistakes by
 
6
 precinct officials that made it impossible to correctly determine
 
the election result.
 
11. None of Beirne’s allegations related to her
 
perceived inequities in the campaign process satisfy her burden
 of demonstrating errors that would change the outcome of the
 election for house of representatives, district 47. 
JUDGMENT
 
Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and
 
conclusions of law, judgment is entered dismissing the complaint. 
The clerk of the supreme court shall forthwith serve a
 
certified copy of this judgment on the chief election officer in
 accordance with HRS § 11-174.5(b).
