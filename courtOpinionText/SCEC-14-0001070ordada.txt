ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND JUDGMENT
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
We have considered the election complaint filed by 
Plaintiff Hope L. Cermelj, on behalf of herself and Aiko Aiyama, 
Ina Campbell, Jon J. Morishita, Philip Heath, Beth Lederer, Martha Holman, Marilyn Martinez, John Armstrong, and “Numerous Others Filing Declarations Online”, and the motion to dismiss filed by Defendants Scott Nago, Chief Election Officer for the State of Hawai' i, and the Office of Elections. Having heard this 
matter without oral argument and in accordance with HRS § 11­173.5(b) (2009) (requiring the supreme court to “give judgment fully stating all findings of fact and of law”), we set forth the following findings of fact and conclusions of law and enter the following judgment.    FINDINGS OF FACT
 
1. In the late evening of Thursday, August 7, 2014
 
through the early morning hours of Friday, August 8, 2014,
 
Hurricane/Tropical Storm Iselle made landfall on the Big Island. 
2. On Friday, August 8, 2014, Chief Election Officer
 
Scott Nago (“Nago”) issued a Proclamation closing two polling
 places on the Big Island and postponing the elections for
 Precincts 04-01 and 04-02. The Proclamation indicated that the
 registered voters of Precincts 04-01 and 04-02 would vote by
 absentee ballot. No other polling place was closed.
 
3. On Saturday, August 9, 2014, the primary election
 
went forward as scheduled. All polling places were open for
 voting with the exception of the two polling places that were
 closed as announced by the Proclamation. 
4. On Monday, August 11, 2014, Nago issued a second
 
Proclamation that voters in Precincts 04-01 and 04-02 who had not
 already voted by absentee ballots would be able to vote on
 Friday, August 15, 2014, at Keonepoko Elementary School.
 
5. On Friday, August 15, 2014, the election proceeded
 
for Precincts 04-01 and 04-02 and was completed.
 
6. On August 21, 2014, Plaintiff Hope Cermelj
 
(“Cermelj”) filed an “Election Contest Complaint”. In addition
 to Cermelj, the complaint identifies the Plaintiffs as Aiko
 Aiyama, Ina Campbell, Jon J. Morishita, Philip Heath, Beth
 Lederer, Martha Holman, Marilyn Martinez, John Armstrong, and
 “Numerous Others Filing Declarations Online” (collectively,
 
2
 “Plaintiffs”). Cermelj identifies herself as a “registered
 
voter.” The other plaintiffs identify themselves as registered
 voters of precincts that were not closed on Saturday, August 9,
 2014. None of the Plaintiffs were candidates for elected office. 
Plaintiffs appear to be asking the court to fire Defendant Nago
 and to provide “justice” because voters were denied their right
 to vote.
 
7. Defendants Nago and the Office of Elections filed
 
a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction or, in
 the alternative, failure to state a claim for which relief can be
 granted. 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
1. “With respect to any election, any candidate, or
 
qualified political party directly interested, or any thirty
 voters of any election district, may file a complaint in the
 supreme court.” HRS § 11-172 (2009). 
2. An election complaint that is filed by a plaintiff
 
who is not within a category of plaintiffs specified by HRS § 11­172 is subject to dismissal for lack of standing. See Elkins v.
 
Ariyoshi, 56 Haw. 47, 48, 527 P.2d 236, 237 (1974).
 
3. Plaintiffs do not fall within a category of
 
plaintiffs specified by HRS § 11-172. Plaintiffs are not proper
 parties to the election contest and lack the requisite standing
 under HRS § 11-172.
 
4. Even if Plaintiffs fall within a category of
 
plaintiffs specified by HRS § 11-172, the complaint fails to set
 
3
 forth any allegations that would demonstrate errors, mistakes, or 
irregularities that would change the election result. See HRS § 
11-172 (an election contest complaint shall “set forth any cause or causes, such as but not limited to, provable fraud, overages, or underages, that could cause a difference in the election results”); Tataii v. Cronin, 119 Hawai' i 337, 339, 198 P.3d 124, 
126 (2008) (“A complaint challenging the results of [an] election pursuant to HRS § 11-172 fails to state a claim unless the plaintiffs demonstrate errors that would change the outcome of the election[.]”); Funakoshi v. King, 65 Haw. 312, 317, 651 P.2d 912, 915 (1982)(“‘Difference in the election results’ . . . mean[s] a difference sufficient to overturn the nomination of any particular candidate or candidates in the primary.”). 
JUDGMENT
 
Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and
 
conclusions of law, judgment is entered dismissing the election
 contest complaint. 
The clerk of the supreme court shall forthwith serve a
 
certified copy of this judgment on the chief election officer in
 accordance with HRS § 11-173.5(b).
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, August 28, 2014.
