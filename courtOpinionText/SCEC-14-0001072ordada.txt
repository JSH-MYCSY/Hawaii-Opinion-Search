SCOTT NAGO, Chief Election Officer, Defendant.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND JUDGMENT
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
We have considered the August 22, 2014 election 
complaint filed by Plaintiff Nelson N. Waikiki, Jr. and the 
August 26, 2014 motion to dismiss filed by Defendant Scott Nago, Chief Election Officer for the State of Hawai' i. Having heard 
this matter without oral argument and in accordance with HRS § 11-173.5(b) (2009) (requiring the supreme court to “give judgment fully stating all findings of fact and of law”), we set forth the following findings of fact and conclusions of law and enter the following judgment. 
FINDINGS OF FACT
 
1. Plaintiff Nelson N. Waikiki, Jr. (“Waikiki”) was
 
one of seven candidates for the Maui County Mayoral seat in the
    August 9, 2014 special primary election.
 
2. The election results for the Maui Mayoral seat
 
were: 
Alan M. Arakawa 17,980 (63.5%)
Tamara (Tam) Paltin  3,405 (12.0%)
Ala  n  a   K  a  y  1,398 (4.9%)
Nelson Nahinu Waikiki, Jr.  818 (2.9%)
Nelson E. (AZD) Mamuad 724 (2.6%)
Orion (Ori) Kopelman  709 (2.5%)
Beau E. Hawkes 380 (1.3%)
 
3. Alan Arakawa and Tamara Paltin are the two
 
candidates who received the highest number of votes.
 
4. On August 22, 2014, the court received a one-page
 
letter from Waikiki. 
5. Waikiki appears to be contesting the results of 
election for the Maui County mayoral race. The subject of the 
letter is titled “Re: Elections - Complainant Nelson N. Waikiki, Jr. Maui Mayoral Candidate.” In the letter, Waikiki states that there has been “non-compliance, possible conspiracy, and corruption by election officials” and that a “breakdown in the system has occurred.” He further states that he “believe[s] that the Governor’s office, the AG, the Maui Mayor’s office and the Elections Office conspired and corrupted the rights and trust of the people of Hawai' i.” He believes that the voters “have been 
taken advantaged [and] bullied” due to 800 “misplaced” votes. 
6. Waikiki requests a re-vote or a re-count. 
7. Defendant Nago moved to dismiss the complaint as
 
untimely and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can
 be granted.

 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
1. The complaint fails to state claims upon which
 
relief can be granted.
 
2. When reviewing a motion to dismiss a complaint for 
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the 
court must accept plaintiff’s allegations as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff; dismissal is proper only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that would entitle him or her to relief. AFL Hotel & Restaurant Workers Health & 
Welfare Trust Fund v. Bosque, 110 Hawai' i 318, 321, 132 P.3d 
1229, 1232 (2006). 
3. A complaint contesting the results of a special 
primary election fails to state a claim unless the plaintiff demonstrates errors, mistakes or irregularities that would change the outcome of the election. See HRS § 11-172 (2009); Tataii v. 
Cronin, 119 Hawai' i 337, 339, 198 P.3d 124, 126 (2008); Akaka v. 
Yoshina, 84 Hawai' i 383, 387, 935 P.2d 98, 102 (1997); Funakoshi 
v. King, 65 Haw. 312, 317, 651 P.2d 912, 915 (1982); Elkins v.
 Ariyoshi, 56 Haw. 47, 48, 527 P.2d 236, 237 (1974).
 
4. A plaintiff contesting a special primary election 
must show that he or she has actual information of mistakes or errors sufficient to change the result. Tataii, 119 Hawai' i at 
339, 198 P.3d at 126; Akaka, 84 Hawai' i at 388, 935 P.2d at 103; 
Funakoshi, 65 Haw. at 316-317, 651 P.2d at 915. 
5. An election contest cannot be based upon mere
 
3
 belief or indefinite information. Tataii, 119 Hawai' i at 339, 
198 P.3d at 126; Akaka, 84 Hawai' i at 387-388, 935 P.2d at 102­
103.
 
6. Taking Waikiki’s allegations as true and viewing
 
them in the light most favorable to him, it appears that Waikiki
 
can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief
 inasmuch as Waikiki fails to present specific acts or “actual
 information of mistakes or error sufficient to change the results
 of the election.” 
7. In a special primary election challenge, HRS § 11­
73.5(b) (2009) authorizes the supreme court to “decide what
 candidate was nominated or elected.” 
8. The remedy provided by HRS § 11-173.5(b) of having
 
the court decide which candidate was nominated or elected is the
 only remedy that can be given for primary election irregularities
 challenged pursuant to HRS § 11-173.5. Funakoshi v. King, 65
 
Haw. at 316, 651 P.2d at 914.
 
9. None of the remedies sought by Waikiki are
 
authorized by HRS § 11-173.5(b).
 
JUDGMENT
 
Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and
 
conclusions of law, judgment is entered dismissing the complaint. 
Alan M. Arakawa and Tamara (Tam) Paltin are the two candidates
 who received the highest number of votes and will appear on the
 ballot in the second special election pursuant to art. 7, § 7-2
 of the Maui County Charter. 
4
 The clerk of the supreme court shall process the
 
election contest without payment of the filing fee. 
The clerk of the supreme court shall also forthwith
 
serve a certified copy of this judgment on the chief election
 
officer in accordance with HRS § 11-173.5(b).
