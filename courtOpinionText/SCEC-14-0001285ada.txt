ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, AND JUDGMENT
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
On November 7, 2014, plaintiff Khistina Caldwell DeJean 
(“DeJean”) filed a document entitled “Election Challen[g]e 2014,” 
which we view as an election complaint to contest the November 2014 general election. On November 17, 2014, defendant Scott Nago (“Nago”), Chief Election Officer of the State of Hawai' i, 
the Office of Elections, and Aaron Schulaner (“Schulaner”) (collectively, “Defendants”) filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On November 21, 2014, DeJean filed a reply memorandum. Upon consideration of the election complaint, the motion to dismiss, and the reply memorandum, and having heard this matter without oral argument and in accordance with HRS § 11-174.5(b) (2009) (requiring the supreme court to “give judgment, stating all findings of fact and of law”), we set forth
 
the following findings of fact and conclusions of law and enter
 the following judgment.
 
FINDINGS OF FACT
 
1. DeJean was not listed on the November 4, 2014
 
general election ballot as a candidate for any office. 
2. DeJean contests the general election by filing
 
a complaint in the supreme court on November 7, 2014. DeJean
 names Nago, the Office of Elections, and Schulaner as defendants.
 
3. The complaint references a Pennsylvania statute,
 
cites several case law and HRS § 12-6, and includes a heading
 entitled “Jury Verdicts & Settlements.”
 
4. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for 
(a) lack of standing and, in the alternative, (b) failure to
 state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
 
5. In response to the motion to dismiss, DeJean 
requests, among other things, a special election and that
 Defendants Nago and Schulaner, together with Attorney General
 David Louie, be fired or jailed immediately. 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
I.
 
1. HRS § 11-172 (2009) requires an election contest
 
to be brought by “any candidate, or qualified political party
 directly interested, or any thirty voters of any election
 district.”
 
2. The record indicates that DeJean was not listed on
 
2
 the ballot as a candidate for any office in the November 4, 2014
 
general election, is not a qualified political party, and does
 not comprise thirty voters of an election district. 
3. DeJean, therefore, lacks standing to contest the
 
November 4, 2014 general election.
 
II. 
4. When reviewing a motion to dismiss a complaint for 
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the court must accept the plaintiff’s allegations as true and view them in the light most favorable to him or her; dismissal is proper only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that would entitle him or her to relief. AFL Hotel & Restaurant Workers 
Health & Welfare Trust Fund v. Bosque, 110 Hawai' i 318, 321, 132 
P.3d 1229, 1232 (2006). 
5. A complaint challenging the results of a general 
election pursuant to HRS § 11-172 fails to state a claim unless the plaintiff demonstrates errors, mistakes or irregularities that would change the outcome of the election. Tataii v. Cronin, 
119 Hawai' i 337, 339, 198 P.3d 124, 126 (2008); Akaka v. Yoshina, 
84 Hawai' i 383, 387, 935 P.2d 98, 102 (1997); Funakoshi v. King, 
65 Haw. 312, 317, 651 P.2d 912, 915 (1982); Elkins v. Ariyoshi, 56 Haw. 47, 48, 527 P.2d 236, 237 (1974). 
6. A plaintiff challenging a general election must 
show that he or she has actual information of mistakes or errors sufficient to change the result. Tataii, 119 Hawai' i at 339, 198 
3
      P.3d at 126; Akaka, 84 Hawai' i at 388, 935 P.2d at 103; 
Funakoshi, 65 Haw. at 316-317, 651 P.2d at 915. 
7. DeJean has failed to present specific facts or
 
actual information of mistakes, errors, or irregularities
 
sufficient to change the results of the general election. Taking
 DeJean’s allegations as true and viewing them in the light most
 favorable to her, DeJean can prove no set of facts that would
 entitle her to any type of relief from the results of the general
 election. 
8. Therefore, DeJean fails to state a claim upon
 
which relief can be granted.
 
JUDGMENT
 
Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and
 
conclusions of law, judgment is entered dismissing the complaint.
