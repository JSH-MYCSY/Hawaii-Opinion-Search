 Plaintiff Waters, and in accordance with HRS §§ 11-172 (2009) and 
11-174.5(b) (2009), we set forth the following findings of fact
 and conclusions of law and enter the following judgment.
 
FINDINGS OF FACT
 
The November 4, 2014 Second Special Election
for the District IV City Council Seat 
1. On November 4, 2014, in conjunction with the State 
of Hawai' i’s general election, the City and County of Honolulu 
held its nonpartisan second special election for city councilmember for District IV. 
2. Waters and Ozawa were the nonpartisan candidates
 
for the District IV councilmember seat.
 
3. On November 5, 2014, at 1:26 a.m., the Office of
 
Elections generated a “Final Summary Report” for the elections. 
According to Nago and the Office of Elections, the report
 reflected the results of the November 4, 2014 election subject to
 any audit of the poll books, record books, and the reconciliation
 
2
 reports compiled by the county clerks. At that time, the results
 
of the District IV race were reported as follows:
 
Trevor Ozawa: 16,371
 (44.1%)
Tommy Waters: 16,324 (43.9%)
Blank Votes:  4,451 (12.0%)
Over Votes:  16 (0.0%)
 
4. On November 18, 2014, at 5:11 p.m., following a
 
post-election audit and the reconciliation process, the Office of
 Elections generated a final “Final Summary Report.” 
The results
 
of the District IV race were reported as follows:
 
Trevor Ozawa: 16,374 (44.0%)
Tommy Waters: 16,333 (43.9%)
Blank Votes:  4,455 (12.0%)
Over Votes:  16 (0.0%)
 
5. The difference in the two reports was the addition
 
of 16 ballots to the final tally, which included 4 provisional
 ballots that were approved for counting, 10 absentee mail ballots
 for which the signatures on the return envelopes had been
 confirmed, and 2 federal write-in absentee ballots. 
6. The difference in the votes between Waters and
 
Ozawa was 41 votes. 
Post-Election Communications
 
7. On November 10, 2014, Waters’ counsel, James
 
Kawashima (“Kawashima”), sent a letter to the Office of Elections
 requesting information about the second special election. 
He
 
asked the Office of Elections for the margin of error of the
 voting system used. He also asked the Office of Elections to
 
3
 take the following action: (1) verify and investigate the
 
possible errors with the overages and underages; (2) investigate
 the 4,451 blank votes for accuracy and validity; and (3) review
 the 16 overvotes in accordance with operating procedure. 
Kawashima asked the Office of Elections to “apply every test or
 process available to you in making sure the result was accurate
 and valid.”
 
8. Three days later, on November 13, 2014, Kawashima
 
sent a follow up letter to the Office of Elections. He informed
 the Office of Elections of the upcoming deadline to take legal
 action to challenge the election and asked for a status regarding
 a response to the November 10, 2014 letter. He also informed the
 Office of Elections that he was ready and available to meet and
 discuss the issues.
 
9. On November 14, 2014, Nago sent Kawashima a letter
 
acknowledging the November 10 and 13, 2014 letters. Nago
 informed Kawashima that the Office of Elections was in the
 process of completing its post-election processes before it could
 finalize the election results and that it would forward a copy of
 the final summary report along with the overages and underages
 related to the districts/precincts associated with the District
 IV contest at the conclusion of the process.
 
4
 10.	 On November 19, 2014, Nago sent Kawashima a final
 
statewide summary and attached a matrix of the overages and
 
underages for each District IV district/precinct.
 
11. The following day, on November 20, 2014, the
 
Office of Elections sent Kawashima an updated version of the
 overages and underages for the District IV districts/precincts. 
12. 	The updated chart reflects an overage total of 11
and an underage total of 39. 
 
The Election Contest
 
13. On November 24, 2014, Waters timely filed a
 
complaint contesting the election results for the District IV
city council race. The following day, on November 25, 2014,
 Waters filed a first amended complaint. 
 
14. 	The first amended complaint asserts two counts for
 
relief:
 
• 	Count I 
- Waters alleges that Nago, the
Office of Elections, and Mau “miscounted 74
ballots cast as being totally blank in
regards to voting in the District 4 election,
when those 74 ballots had actually been
validly cast for either candidate Waters or
candidate Ozawa, with said miscounting being
a cause, within the meaning of HRS, § 11-172,
that could cause a difference in the outcome
 of the District 4 election.”
 
• 	Count II - Waters alleges that Nago, the
Office of Elections, and Mau mishandled the
overages and underages by intermingling 50
ballots (39 underages and 11 overages) with
valid ballots that had been voted and counted
 when they should not have been counted or
 
5
 issued and voted and not yet counted when
they were supposed to have been counted. 
15. Waters attached a copy of the “Report of the
 
Election Oversight Committee on the Audit of the 1998 General
 
Election” (the “1998 Audit”).
 
16. The 1998 Audit reviewed the electronic voting
 
system used in the 1998 election. The electronic voting system
 used to calculate the votes in the 1998 election was from
 Electronic Systems & Software (“ES&S”). 
17. In the first amended complaint, Waters asks the
 
court to order a manual recount of the 4,455 blank votes or, in
 the alternative, order a new special election for District IV by
 mail-in ballots only. 
He also asks the court to award him
 
attorneys’ fees and costs, order the Office of Elections to
 answer the questions he posed in previous correspondence, provide
 him access to the election results and the instruments used in
 tallying the final results, and permit minimal discovery.
 
18. On December 5, 2014, Mau filed an answer to the
 
first amended complaint and asks the court to dismiss the first
 amended complaint. 
Mau denies any wrongdoing, improper conduct,
 
or irregularities with respect to the second special election. 
Mau argues that Waters’ reliance on the 1998 Audit is misplaced
 because it was an audit of election results of a different
 election that used voting machines different from the ones used
 in the 2014 election.
 
6
 19. On December 5, 2014, Nago and the Office of
 
Elections moved to dismiss the first amended complaint or, in the
 
alternative, for summary judgment. They argue that Waters’
 conclusion that 74 of the blank ballots are valid is hypothetical
 and purely speculative because Waters is relying on an audit of a
 different election involving a different voting system. They
 also argue that the addition of the 16 ballots that were
 submitted to the Office of Elections by Mau were properly part of
 the post-election process. They further argue that the
 distribution of the overages and underages did not demonstrate
 fraud or mistakes by the precinct officials to establish that the
 election results were incorrect.
 
20. Attached to the motion to dismiss or, in the 
alternative, for summary judgment, are declarations from Nago and
 Rich Geppert (“Geppert”), one of the professional services
 managers for Hart Intercivic, Inc. (“Hart Intercivic”), the
 vendor of the electronic voting machines used in the 2014
 election. 
21. The voting system used in the 2014 election has
 
been used by the Office of Elections since 2008, when it replaced
 the ES&S voting system that was first used in the 1998 election
 when the Office of Elections implemented an electronic voting
 system. 
7
 22. Geppert explains that the Hart Intercivic system
 
uses three main components to record votes -- (1) eSlate - direct
 
recording electronic voting unit with disabled access unit to
 assist voters with disabilities; (2) eScan - digital ballot
 imaging precinct counter in which a voter inserts his or her
 ballot to be counted and deposited; and (3) Ballot Now - high
 speed scanners that scan absentee ballots for counting. In
 calculating absentee ballots, Ballot Now uses commercial full-
sheet scanning technology to record a full digital image of the
 voted ballot. After the scanner converts the paper ballot into
 an electronic image, Ballot Now analyzes marks at a resolution of
 200 dots per inch. The software counts the number of pixels
 inside each option box in the digital image. According to
 Geppert, the Ballot Now digital scanning system “has been used in
 hundreds, if not thousands, of elections and has accurately
 processed millions of votes.”
 
23. In his declaration, Nago explains that the
 
legislature vested authority in the Chief Election Officer to
 adopt a voting system and to define what marks will constitute a
 vote for purposes of utilizing the adopted system, which he notes
 has been done by administrative rule. Nago cites HRS §§ 16-1,
 16-2, 16-41, and 16-42, and HAR §§ 3-172-83 and 3-172-85 to
 support his explanation. Nago also states that the law requires
 that the system must be subject to inspection, audit, and testing
 by qualified observers before and after an election. Nago
 
8
  further declares that the voting system used during the 2014
 
primary and general election was from Hart Intercivic and that it
 was inspected and tested by official observers in preparation for
 use in the general election during absentee walk, polling place,
 and absentee mail voting. 
24. Nago states that “[n]o errors in the counting of
 
votes by the voting system were found for the 2014 general
 election.”
 
25. In his declaration, Nago further explains that
 
official observers were present at the State Capitol on the
 November 4, 2014 election day to observe the counting of ballots,
 and on November 18, 2014, to observe the counting of additional
 ballots at the conclusion of the post-election review process. 
He states that on the night of the general election, the official
 observers requested the manual audit team, which audits the
 computer generated results to ensure the accuracy and integrity
 of the ballot counting program, to supplement its audit with two
 of the District IV precincts (D/P 17-03 and 18-03) and that after
 conducting the audit, the manual audit team certified that the
 computer results of the audited precincts were accurate. 
26. Nago describes overages as follows:
 
An overage is defined as there being more
ballots counted than the poll book indicates.  HRS
 
§ 11-153.  Specifically, we determine overages by
counting the signatures in the poll book associated
with an issued ballot and comparing it to the amount
of ballots counted by the voting machines at the
polling place.  For purposes of absentee mail, if
there are more ballots counted than the number of
 
9
 returned ballot envelopes that were received and whose
signatures had been matched against the signatures on
file, then we consider this to be an overage.  In
 regard to absentee walk sites, if there are more
ballots counted than the amount of verified absentee
 ballot applications completed by the voters at the
site, then the difference is considered an overage.
 
27. Nago describes underages as follows: 
An underage is defined as there being less
ballots counted as cast than the poll book indicates. 
HRS § 11-153.  Likewise, for absentee mail and
absentee walk there are less ballots counted than the
 amount of validated absentee ballot applications at an
absentee walk site or the amount of returned ballot
 envelopes that were received and whose signatures had
been matched against the signatures on file.
 
28. Nago also provides examples of overages and
 
underages. For overages, Nago provides the following example:
 
26. For example, a poll book could have the
names of 200 voters, with 100 who have a signature by
their name in conjunction with the issuance of their
ballot, and 101 ballots that have been counted by the
voting machines.  In this situation, the overage can
result from the voter not having signed the poll book. 
In other words, 101 voters asked for and received a
ballot, while only 100 of them signed the poll book,
and then all 101 voters had their ballot counted by
the voting machine.  The end result is an overage of 1
ballot, with all ballots having been cast by qualified
voters.
 
For underages, Nago indicates that “[a]n underage may occur when
 
a voter is issued a ballot and subsequently decides to walk away
 without voting, due to a long line, or otherwise not wishing to
 wait to cast his or her ballot.” 
29. 
Nago states that the distribution of overages and
 
underages among the seventeen district/precincts for District IV
 “shows no pattern of fraud or mistake from which it could be
 concluded that the correct result of the election had not been
 ascertained.” 
10
 30. Nago declares that he is “not aware of any issues
 
or problems with the accuracy of the vote counting system, the
 
handling of ballots, or any other matters that would impact the
 integrity of the November 4, 2014 general election results of
 Council District IV.” 
31. Nago states that even if a recount was ordered,
 
the Office of Elections is required to follow the same set of
 rules in counting the ballots as used on the general election day
 and under no circumstances is a different set of rules or a
 different standard used after an election to count ballots.
 
32. On December 12, 2014, Waters filed an opposition
 
to the motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary
 judgment. He clarifies that, at this time, all he is seeking is
 for the court to order the Office of Elections to answer the 
questions he raised in a series of correspondence about the
 election process, which he alleges the Office of Elections
 ignored, in order for him to determine whether sufficient error
 exists to warrant further review or a new election.
 
33. Waters contends that the Office of Elections has
 
ignored his efforts to get information, that there is a question
 as to whether some of the blank ballots were correctly marked to
 count as a valid vote, and that if procedures were properly
 followed, there would not be any discrepancies between the poll
 book counts and the actual ballots cast at a precinct to create
 an overage or underage.
 
11
  34. Waters explains that his counsel attempted to
 
resolve this matter without going further and scheduled a meeting
 
to obtain the sought-after information. The meeting was
 scheduled for December 8, 2014, but was later cancelled. Shortly
 thereafter, Waters received a copy of the motion to dismiss or,
 in the alternative, motion for summary judgment.
 
35. Waters questions Nago and the Office of Elections’
 
failure to attest to the accuracy and reliability of the eSlate
 and eScan systems used on election day. 
36. Waters submits e-mail correspondence between
 
Kawashima and Valri Kunimoto (“Kunimoto”), counsel for Nago and
 the Office of Elections, which was dated after Nago and the
 Office of Elections filed the motion to dismiss or, in the
 alternative, for summary judgment in this election contest. 
37. In the e-mail, Kawashima informs Kunimoto that he
 
reviewed Nago’s declaration and asks Kunimoto if Nago would sign
 a declaration with the following statements:
 
•	 that the voting system is 100% accurate; 
•	 that nothing more can be done to assure that
there may be errors in the system that may
make a 41 vote difference in the final tally;
 
•	 that if the vote had resulted in a one vote
 difference, nothing more than was done would
have been done to confirm the accuracy of the
results; and
 
•	 that there is no human decision-making that
is part of the process as it may relate to
overages, underages, blank ballots, and
spoiled ballots. 
12
 38. Kunimoto responded that “Mr. Nago stands on his
 
declaration which has already been submitted to the Court and
 
will not submit a supplemental declaration with the statements
 you proposed. Thank you for your consideration.” 
39. On December 15, 2014, Ozawa, who was permitted to
 
intervene on December 10, 2014, filed an answer to the first
 amended complaint and also filed a joinder to the motion to
 dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. Ozawa
 argues that Waters’ reliance on the 1998 Audit is misplaced and
 has no bearing on the 2014 election. He also argues that Waters
 fails to demonstrate that the overages and underages would cause
 a difference in the election results and that, ordering a recount
 or new election based on overages and underages “would open the
 floodgates for future baseless election challenges because it
 would require [the Office of Elections] to recount every election
 where overages or underages occur, particularly in cases where
 those numbers come close to the margin of win.”
 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
1. An election contest is instituted by filing a
 
complaint in the supreme court “set[ting] forth any cause or
 causes, such as but not limited to, provable fraud, overages, or
 underages, that could cause a difference in the election
 results.” HRS § 11-172.
 
2. A complaint challenging the results of a special
 
13
 general election pursuant to HRS § 11-172 fails to state a claim 
unless the plaintiff demonstrates errors, mistakes or irregularities that would change the outcome of the election. Tataii v. Cronin, 119 Hawai' i 337, 339, 198 P.3d 124, 126 (2008); 
Akaka v. Yoshina, 84 Hawai' i 383, 387, 935 P.2d 98, 102 (1997); 
Funakoshi v. King, 65 Haw. 312, 317, 651 P.2d 912, 915 (1982); Elkins v. Ariyoshi, 56 Haw. 47, 48, 527 P.2d 236, 237 (1974). 
3. A plaintiff challenging a special general election 
must show that he or she has actual information of mistakes or errors sufficient to change the election result. Tataii, 119 
Hawai'i at 339, 198 P.3d at 126; Akaka, 84 Hawai' i at 388, 935 
P.2d at 103; Funakoshi, 65 Haw. at 316-317, 651 P.2d at 915. 
4. Sufficient evidence requires something more than a
 
“mere fishing expedition undertaken in the hope that in an
 examination of all the ballots enough might be discovered to
 change the result.” Brown v. Iaukea, 18 Haw. 131, 133 (1906). 
5. “In the absence of facts showing that 
irregularities exceed the reported margin between the candidates, the complaint is legally insufficient because, even if its truth were assumed, the result of the election would not be affected.” Tataii, 119 Hawai' i at 339-40, 198 P.3d at 126-27. 
6. “An election contest cannot be based upon mere
 
belief or indefinite information.” Id.
 
7. When reviewing a motion to dismiss a complaint for
 
14
 failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the 
court must accept the plaintiff’s allegations as true and view them in the light most favorable to him or her; dismissal is proper only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that would entitle him or her to relief. AFL Hotel & Restaurant Workers 
Health & Welfare Trust Fund v. Bosque, 110 Hawai' i 318, 321, 132 
P.3d 1229, 1232 (2006). 
8. Conclusory allegations and unwarranted inferences 
are not sufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss. Kealoha v. 
Machado, 131 Hawai' i 62, 74, 315 P.3d 213, 225 (2013). 
9. The court’s consideration of matters outside the 
pleadings converts a motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment. Buscher v. Boning, 114 Hawai' i 202, 212, 159 P.3d 814, 
824 (2007). 
10. Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no 
genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Silva v. City and 
County of Honolulu, 115 Hawai' i 1, 6, 165 P.2d 247, 252 (2007). 
11. In Count I, Waters alleges that 74 blank votes are
 
likely valid votes and may cause a difference in the vote
 distribution for his race. In reaching this conclusion, Waters
 relies upon the statements contained in the 1998 Audit and
 concludes that 0.2% of all blank votes are actually valid votes. 
The 1998 election, however, involved a different voting system
 
15
 with a different vendor. Consequently, the data contained in the
 
1998 Audit provides no actual information of mistakes or errors
 with regard to the November 4, 2014 second special election for
 the city council race that would change the election result. 
12. In Count II, Waters alleges that the overages and
 
underages were “mishandled.” However, Nago indicates that the
 existence of overages and underages occurs in the ordinary course
 of an election. After reviewing the distribution of overages and
 underages across the District IV precincts, and considering that
 a manual audit of two of the District IV precincts confirmed the
 accuracy of the computer results on the night of the general
 election, Nago and the Office of Elections conclude that “there
 is nothing in the distribution of the overages or underages that
 reflects any mistakes or pattern of fraud” to demonstrate
 irregularities in the election. Waters has not presented
 specific evidence or actual information of mistakes or errors to
 dispute this conclusion such that it would change the election
 result. 
13. In his opposition to the motion to dismiss or, in
 
the alternative, for summary judgment, Waters indicates that his
 basis for filing the election contest was to “satisfy himself”
 that there was no fraud, mistake, or irregularities. In
 accordance with seeking to obtain information to “satisfy
 himself” that the election was valid and accurate, Waters
 requests the court’s assistance to order the Office of Elections
 
16
  to cooperate with him in order to answer reasonable questions and
 
to view non-confidential elements of the process. 
14. Waters, however, does not explain how the sought-
after documents or information demonstrates fraud,
 irregularities, or mistakes sufficient to change the election
 results, instead premising his argument on the absence of
 information that he was provided. 
15. Therefore, Waters has not shown in his pleadings
 
submitted to this court actual information of errors, mistakes,
 or irregularities sufficient to change the outcome of the
 election. 
JUDGMENT
 
Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and
 
conclusions of law, judgment is entered in favor of Nago, the
 Office of Elections, and Mau and against Waters. Ozawa received
 the majority of the votes cast in the November 4, 2014 second
 special election and has been elected councilmember for District
 IV, City and County of Honolulu.
 
A copy of this judgment shall be served on Nago and Mau
 
who shall act in accordance with the requirements set forth in
 HRS § 11-174.5(b) (“If the court shall decide which candidate or
 candidates have been elected, a copy of that judgment shall be
 
17
 served on the chief election officer or county clerk, who shall
 
sign and deliver to the candidate or candidates certificates of
 election, and the same shall be conclusive of the right of the
 candidate or candidates to the offices.”).
