IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
RICHARD Y. KIM, Plaintiff,
 
vs.
 
DAVID IGE, Democratic Candidate for Governor, Defendant.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND JUDGMENT
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
We have considered the August 16, 2018 “Election
 
Objection” filed by Plaintiff Richard Y. Kim (“Plaintiff Kim”),
 
the August 21, 2018 motion to dismiss filed by Defendant David
 Ige (“Defendant Ige), and the August 22, 2018 memorandum in
 opposition to the motion to dismiss filed by Plaintiff Kim. 
Having heard this matter without oral argument and in accordance
 with HRS § 11-173.5(b) (2009) (requiring the supreme court to
 “give judgment fully stating all findings of fact and of law”),
 we set forth the following findings of fact and conclusions of
 law and enter the following judgment.
 
FINDINGS OF FACT
 
1. Plaintiff Kim was one of six Democratic Party
 
candidates for the Office of Governor in the August 11, 2018
                primary election.
 
2. The election result for the Democratic Party
 
candidate for the Office of Governor was as follows:
 
David Y. Ige  124,572 (50.2%)
Colleen Wakako Hanabusa  107,631 (43.4%)
Ernest Caravalho 5,662 (2.3%)
Wendell J. Ka' ehu'ae'a  2,298 (0.9%)
Richard Y. Kim 1,576 (0.6%)
Van (Tanaban) Tanabe  775 (0.3%)
Blank Votes  5,116 (2.1%)
Over Votes 304 (0.1%) 
3. Defendant Ige is the Democratic Party candidate
 
who received the highest number of votes.
 
4. On August 16, 2018, Plaintiff Kim filed an
 
“Election Objection” challenging the August 11, 2018 primary
 
election.
 
5. Plaintiff Kim alleges that Defendant Ige “bribed” 
the Korean community and “comforted Korean voters’ heart[s]” in March and April 2018 by visiting the United Korean Association of Hawaii, meeting with the Association’s president and the Korean community group, praising the Korean community, and donating $1 million to the Hawai' i Korean Cultural Center. Plaintiff Kim 
alleges that Defendant Ige and unnamed individuals conspired to “influence voters in [the] Korean community” and “sway . . . voters toward him” and, as a result, Plaintiff Kim “lost many of his votes from [the] Korean community.” Plaintiff Kim contends that Defendant Ige committed election offenses in violation of HRS §§ 19-3 (election fraud) and 19-6 (misdemeanors), the Federal Election Campaign Act, 42 U.S.C.S. § 1985, the Hatch Act, and other violations of federal law. 
2
 6. Plaintiff Kim asks this court to disqualify
 
Defendant Ige as the Democratic Party gubernatorial candidate and
 
order a new primary election without Defendant Ige’s name on the
 ballot. 
7. Defendant Ige filed a motion to dismiss the
 
election objection for lack of subject matter jurisdiction over
 the criminal allegations raised by Plaintiff Kim and for failure
 to present any evidence of errors, mistakes, irregularities or
 any other basis that could cause a difference in the election
 result. 
8. Plaintiff Kim filed an opposition to the motion to
 
dismiss.
 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
1. This court does not have original jurisdiction
 
over criminal prosecutions. See HRS § 602-5(a) (2016). As such,
 
this court lacks jurisdiction to prosecute the criminal offenses
 alleged by Plaintiff Kim. 
2. The election objection (e.g., complaint) fails to
 
state claims upon which relief can be granted.
 
3. A complaint challenging the results of a primary 
election fails to state a claim unless the plaintiff demonstrates errors, mistakes or irregularities that would change the outcome of the election. See HRS § 11-172 (2009); Tataii v. Cronin, 119 
Hawai'i 337, 339, 198 P.3d 124, 126 (2008); Akaka v. Yoshina, 84 
Hawai'i 383, 387, 935 P.2d 98, 102 (1997); Funakoshi v. King, 65 
Haw. 312, 317, 651 P.2d 912, 915 (1982); Elkins v. Ariyoshi, 56 
3
 Haw. 47, 48, 527 P.2d 236, 237 (1974).
 
4. A plaintiff challenging a primary election must 
show that he or she has actual information of mistakes or errors 
sufficient to change the election result. Tataii, 119 Hawai' i at 
339, 198 P.3d at 126; Akaka, 84 Hawai' i at 388, 935 P.2d at 103; 
Funakoshi, 65 Haw. at 316-317, 651 P.2d at 915. 
5. In order for a complaint to be legally sufficient,
 
it must “show[] that the specific acts and conduct . . .
 complained of would have had the effect of changing the results
 of the primary election.” Elkins, 56 Haw. at 49, 527 P.2d at
 
237.
 
6. An election contest cannot be based upon mere 
belief or indefinite information. Tataii, 119 Hawai' i at 339, 
198 P.3d at 126; Akaka, 84 Hawai' i at 387-388, 935 P.2d at 102­
103.
 
7. When reviewing a motion to dismiss a complaint for 
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the court must accept plaintiff’s allegations as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff; dismissal is proper only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that would entitle him or her to relief. AFL Hotel & Restaurant Workers Health & 
Welfare Trust Fund v. Bosque, 110 Hawai' i 318, 321, 132 P.3d 
1229, 1232 (2006). 
8. Taking Plaintiff Kim’s allegations as true and
 
viewing them in the light most favorable to him, it appears that
 
4
 Plaintiff Kim can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to
 
relief. Plaintiff Kim’s conclusory, speculative allegations of
 bribery and election fraud do not amount to “actual information
 of mistakes or errors sufficient to change the results of the
 election.” The difference between Defendant Ige’s vote count
 (124,572) and Plaintiff Kim’s vote count (1,576) is 122,996
 votes. Plaintiff Kim fails to present any evidence that the
 alleged wrongdoings would result in a change of 122,996 votes in
 his favor. 
9. In a primary election challenge, HRS § 11-173.5(b)
 
authorizes the supreme court to “decide what candidate was
 nominated or elected.” 
10. The remedy provided by HRS § 11-173.5(b) of having
 
the court decide which candidate was nominated or elected is the
 only remedy that can be given for primary election irregularities
 challenged pursuant to HRS § 11-173.5. Funakoshi, 65 Haw. at
 
316, 651 P.2d at 914.
 
11. Disqualifying Defendant Ige pursuant to HRS §§ 19­
3, 19-4, and 19-6, and ordering a new primary election without
 Defendant Ige’s name on the ballot are not remedies authorized by
 HRS § 11-173.5(b).
 
JUDGMENT
 
Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and
 
conclusions of law, judgment is entered in favor of Defendant
 Ige. Defendant David Y. Ige received the highest number of votes
 and his name shall be placed on the ballot as the Democratic
 
5
 Party candidate for the Office of Governor for the 2018 general
 
election. 
The clerk of the supreme court shall also forthwith
 
serve a certified copy of this judgment on the chief election
 officer in accordance with HRS § 11-173.5(b).
