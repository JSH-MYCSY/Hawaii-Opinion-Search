ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND JUDGMENT
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
We have considered the August 16, 2018 “Election 
Objection” filed by Plaintiff Richard Y. Kim (“Plaintiff Kim”), 
the August 21, 2018 motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment filed by Defendants State of Hawai' i, Attorney 
General Russell A. Suzuki, Office of Elections, and Chief Election Officer Scott T. Nago (“Chief Election Officer Nago”) (collectively, the “State Defendants”), and the August 22, 2018 memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss filed by Plaintiff Kim. Having heard this matter without oral argument                and in accordance with HRS § 11-173.5(b) (2009) (requiring the
 
supreme court to “give judgment fully stating all findings of
 fact and of law”), we set forth the following findings of fact
 and conclusions of law and enter the following judgment.
 
FINDINGS OF FACT
 
1. Plaintiff Kim was one of six Democratic Party
 
candidates for the Office of Governor in the August 11, 2018
 primary election.
 
2. The election result for the Democratic Party
 
candidate for the Office of Governor was as follows:
 
David Y. Ige  124,572 (50.2%)
Colleen Wakako Hanabusa  107,631 (43.4%)
Ernest Caravalho 5,662 (2.3%)
Wendell J. Ka' ehu'ae'a  2,298 (0.9%)
Richard Y. Kim 1,576 (0.6%)
Van (Tanaban) Tanabe  775 (0.3%)
Blank Votes  5,116 (2.1%)
Over Votes 304 (0.1%) 
3. David Y. Ige is the Democratic Party candidate who
 
received the highest number of votes.
 
4. On August 16, 2018, Plaintiff Kim filed an
 
“Election Objection” challenging the August 11, 2018 primary
 
election.
 
5. Plaintiff Kim’s election objection stems from the
 
first circuit court’s dismissal of his complaint in Civil No. 18­1-878-06. In Civil No. 18-1-878-06, Kim challenged Congresswoman
 Colleen Hanabusa’s (“Congresswoman Hanabusa”) qualifications to
 run for the Office of Governor. Kim alleged that Congresswoman
 Hanabusa’s candidacy for the Office of Governor violated the
 
2
 “resign to run” provision in art. II, sec. 7 of the Hawai' i State 
Constitution. At a hearing held on August 14, 2018, the circuit 
court dismissed the complaint. The circuit court’s rulings have not yet been reduced to a final judgment. 
6. Plaintiff Kim also alleges that Chief Election
 
Officer Nago has a conflict of interest with him and is guilty of
 election fraud under HRS § 19-3. Plaintiff Kim contends that the
 primary election was rigged and that Chief Election Officer Nago
 publicly ridiculed and insulted him by publishing the election
 results showing that he received only 1,576 votes (less than 1%
 of the votes for the Democratic Party race for governor). 
Plaintiff Kim states that he gave out 25,000 name cards to voters
 and had “heavy” facebook ads which reached 100,000 users. 
Plaintiff Kim alleges that he was publicly ridiculed and insulted
 by having a very low number of votes and claims that Chief
 Election Officer Nago and others conspired to “rig” the primary
 election in order to cause him public humiliation and emotional
 pain. 
7. Plaintiff Kim asks this court to correctly 
interpret and declare that art. II, sec. 7 of the Hawai' i State 
Constitution “resign to run” mandate applies to any State candidate and any elected officer, including federal officer, disqualify Congresswoman Hanabusa as a gubernatorial candidate, order a new primary election without Congresswoman Hanabusa’s name on the ballot, order a full investigation of Chief Election Officer Nago and the Office of Elections for fraud, temporarily 
3
 appoint an independent third party to serve as the Chief Election
 
Officer for the new primary election, and order a manual recount
 of the primary election ballots.
 
8. The State Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the
 
complaint for failure to name David Y. Ige as a necessary and
 indispensable party, lack of subject matter jurisdiction over
 Plaintiff Kim’s “appeal” of the circuit court’s dismissal of his
 civil action in Civil No. 18-1-0878-06, and failure to present
 any evidence of errors, mistakes, irregularities or any other
 basis that could cause a difference in the election result. The
 State Defendants further argue that the remedies requested by
 Plaintiff Kim are improper and cannot be awarded by this court in
 a primary election contest. In the alternative, the State
 Defendants seek summary judgment in their favor. 
9. Plaintiff Kim filed an opposition to the motion to
 
dismiss.
 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
1. HRCP Rule 19(a)(1) provides that “[a] person who
 
is subject to service of process shall be joined as a party in
 the action if [] in the person’s absence complete relief cannot
 be accorded among those already parties[.]”
 
2. Plaintiff Kim seeks a new primary election without
 
Congresswoman Hanabusa’s name on the ballot. Inasmuch as David
 Y. Ige received the highest votes and is the Democratic Party
 candidate for the Office of Governor for the general election, he
 is a necessary and indispensable party who should have been named
 
4
 as a defendant and served with a copy of the complaint. In
 
addition, it is likely that all successful candidates in the
 primary election should be named as necessary parties and receive
 notice of the election objection. The record, however, is devoid
 of any evidence that David Y. Ige (or any of the other successful
 candidates) was named a defendant or served with a copy of the
 election objection and summons.
 
3. A primary election contest under HRS §§ 11-172 and
 
11-173.5 is not the appropriate basis to seek appellate review of
 an underlying circuit court civil case.
 
4. The election objection (e.g., complaint) fails to
 
state claims upon which relief can be granted.
 
5. A complaint challenging the results of a primary 
election fails to state a claim unless the plaintiff demonstrates errors, mistakes or irregularities that would change the outcome of the election. See HRS § 11-172 (2009); Tataii v. Cronin, 119 
Hawai'i 337, 339, 198 P.3d 124, 126 (2008); Akaka v. Yoshina, 84 
Hawai'i 383, 387, 935 P.2d 98, 102 (1997); Funakoshi v. King, 65 
Haw. 312, 317, 651 P.2d 912, 915 (1982); Elkins v. Ariyoshi, 56 Haw. 47, 48, 527 P.2d 236, 237 (1974). 
6. A plaintiff challenging a primary election must 
show that he or she has actual information of mistakes or errors sufficient to change the election result. Tataii, 119 Hawai' i at 
339, 198 P.3d at 126; Akaka, 84 Hawai' i at 388, 935 P.2d at 103; 
Funakoshi, 65 Haw. at 316-317, 651 P.2d at 915. 
5
 7. In order for a complaint to be legally sufficient,
 
it must “show[] that the specific acts and conduct . . .
 
complained of would have had the effect of changing the results
 of the primary election.” Elkins, 56 Haw. at 49, 527 P.2d at
 
237.
 
8. An election contest cannot be based upon mere 
belief or indefinite information. Tataii, 119 Hawai' i at 339, 
198 P.3d at 126; Akaka, 84 Hawai' i at 387-388, 935 P.2d at 102­
103.
 
9. When reviewing a motion to dismiss a complaint for 
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the court must accept plaintiff’s allegations as true and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff; dismissal is proper only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that would entitle him or her to relief. AFL Hotel & Restaurant Workers Health & 
Welfare Trust Fund v. Bosque, 110 Hawai' i 318, 321, 132 P.3d 
1229, 1232 (2006). 
10. The court’s consideration of matters outside the 
pleadings converts a motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment. Foytik v. Chandler, 88 Hawai' i 307, 313, 966 P.2d 619, 
625 (1998). Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Estate of Doe v. Paul 
Revere Ins. Group, 86 Hawai' i 262, 269-270, 948 P.2d 1103, 1110­
1111 (1997). 
6
 11. Taking Plaintiff Kim’s allegations as true and
 
viewing them in the light most favorable to him, it appears that
 
Plaintiff Kim can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to
 relief. Plaintiff Kim’s conclusory, speculative allegations that 
Chief Election Officer Nago had a conflict of interest with him
 and engaged in conspiracy to embarrass him does not amount to
 “actual information of mistakes or errors sufficient to change
 the results of the election.” Plaintiff Kim further fails to
 provide any evidence demonstrating fraud or proving other errors
 or misconduct that could have caused a difference between David
 Y. Ige’s vote count (124,572) and his vote count (1,576) -- a
 difference of 122,996 votes. 
12. In a primary election challenge, HRS § 11-173.5(b)
 
authorizes the supreme court to “decide what candidate was
 nominated or elected.” 
13. The remedy provided by HRS § 11-173.5(b) of having
 
the court decide which candidate was nominated or elected is the
 only remedy that can be given for primary election irregularities
 challenged pursuant to HRS § 11-173.5. Funakoshi, 65 Haw. at
 
316, 651 P.2d at 914.
 
14. Interpreting art. II, sec. 7 of the Hawai' i State 
Constitution for purposes of Civil No. 18-1-0878-06, disqualifying Congresswoman Hanabusa as a gubernatorial candidate, ordering a new primary election without Congresswoman Hanabusa’s name on the ballot, ordering a full investigation of Chief Election Officer Nago and the Office of Elections for 
7
 fraud, temporarily appointing an independent third party to serve
 
as the Chief Election Officer for the new primary election, and
 ordering a manual recount of the primary election ballots are not
 remedies authorized by HRS § 11-173.5(b).
 
15. There is no genuine issue of material fact related
 
to Plaintiff Kim’s election contest.
 
JUDGMENT
 
Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and
 
conclusions of law, judgment is entered in favor of the State
 Defendants. David Y. Ige received the highest number of votes
 and his name shall be placed on the ballot as the Democratic
 Party candidate for the Office of Governor for the 2018 general
 election. 
The clerk of the supreme court shall also forthwith
 
serve a certified copy of this judgment on the chief election
 officer in accordance with HRS § 11-173.5(b).
