 2 ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
JANUARY 25, 2019  
 
RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, POLLACK, AND WILSON, JJ. 
 
PER CURIAM 
 
  T wo election contests were brought as original actions 
with this court challenging the result of the City and County of 
Honolulu second special election for councilmember for District 
IV held on November 6, 2018.  The critical issue in the se cases 
concerns  the collection of 350 absentee mail-in return envelopes 
by the City Clerk at the Honolulu Airport post office on 
election day of November 6, 2018.  Under our election law, these 
envelopes were required to be “received” by the City Clerk no 
later than the close of the polls on election d ay, which was set 
by statute at 6:00 p.m.   However, it is undisputed that the City 
Clerk did not take possession of these absentee mail- in return 
envelopes until after that deadline, retrieving them from the 
mail facility in pickups that occurred at approximately 6:30 
p.m. and 7:30 p.m.  The  ballots that were included in these 
envelopes were subsequently commingled with other ballots and 
then counted in determining the outcome of the election.  
  We conclude that the 350 absentee mail- in return 
envelopes were “received” by the City Clerk after the deadline 
established by state law, and accordingly, the ballots they 
contained should not have been counted.  These 350 ballots ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 3 exceed the 22-vote margin by which the election was decided and, 
because they have become commingled with other ballots that were 
validly cast, it is now impossible to exclude the late-received 
ballots and determine the correct election result.  
Therefore, 
the only alternative is to invalidate the result of the Honolulu 
City Council District IV special election.  
  T hus, having heard this matter with oral argument and 
in accordance with HRS § 11- 174.5(b) (2009) (requiring the 
supreme court to “give judgment, stating all findings of fact 
and of law”), we consolidate these original actions for 
disposition, set forth the following findings of fact and 
conclusions of law
, and enter  judgment. 
FINDINGS OF FACT  
Absentee Ballots in City and County of Honolulu  
Special Elections 
  1.  Pursuant to the Revised Charter of the City and 
County of Honolulu,  nonpartisan special elections for elective 
officers are held in conjunction with the State of Hawai‘i’s (the 
“State”) primary and general elections except as otherwise 
provided.  Revised Charter of the City and County of Honolulu § 
13-116 (2017) . 
 
 2. In these joint elections, the City and County of 
Honolulu (the “City”) administers the absentee walk- in 
locations, the mailing and receipt of absentee mail ballots, and ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 4 the resolution of provisional ballots.  The State of Hawai ʻi 
Office of Elections (“Office of Elections”) supervises
 the 
overall administration of the election, including managing the 
polling places, selecting the precinct officials, and counting 
the validly cast ballots. 
  
3. Twenty days prior to an election, the City Clerk 
mails an absentee ballot to each registered voter who has 
requested one, together with a yellow envelope to seal the 
completed ballot (the “secret ballot envelope”) and a larger 
blue business reply mail envelope
 in which to return the secret 
ballot envelope (the “absentee return envelope”).  A voter 
affirmation statement and a line for the voter’s signature are 
printed on the outside of the absentee return envelope. 
  
4. A voter may cast an absentee ballot at any time 
prior to the close of polls on election day by mail ing a sealed 
absentee return envelope to the City Clerk via the United States 
Postal Service (the “USPS”) or by hand delivering  a sealed 
absentee return envelope to an y polling place .  Polling places 
include absentee walk- in locations managed by the City Clerk 
that are open prior to election day and in- person election day 
polling places administered by the Office of Elections.  
5. Absentee return envelopes that are returned to in -
person polling places on election day are collected by Office of 
Elections polling officials, who transfer the sealed absentee ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 5 return envelopes to the City Clerk following  the closing of the 
polls.   
 
 6. The City Clerk “validates” the voter’s signature 
appearing on each absentee return envelope, which under Hawaii 
Administrative Rules (HAR) § 3-174 -11 is performed by comparing 
it to the signature on the voter’s absentee ballot request or 
voter registration.  The City Clerk does not open any  absentee 
return envelopes.   
  7 . The City Clerk marks those absentee return 
envelopes that a re not validated “invalid” and retains custody 
of them, to be disposed of in a manner prescribed by statute. 
  8 . The City Clerk transfers the validated absentee 
return envelopes to the Office of Elections for tabulation. 
The November 6, 2018 Second Special Election  
for the District IV City Council Seat 
  9 . On November 6, 2018, in conjunction with the 
State’s general election, the City held a nonpartisan second 
special election for the seat of the District IV city 
councilmember. 
 
 10. Thomas Waters (also known as Tommy Waters) and 
Trevor Ozawa were the nonpartisan candidates for the District IV 
councilmember seat. 
  1 1. Twenty days prior to the November 6, 2018 second 
special election, City Clerk Glen I. Takahashi (“City Clerk ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 6 Takahashi” or “City Clerk” ) mailed out absentee ballots, 
together with secret ballot envelope
s and absentee return 
envelopes,  to 172,526 registered voters who had requested 
absentee ballots .  
  12 . For the 2018 general election, the City Clerk 
deemed a total of 132,016 absentee return envelopes to be 
validly returned during the entirety of the absentee voting 
period, which ran from October 17, 2018 , to the close of polls 
on election day.1  The record does not indicate the total number 
of absentee return envelopes received from registered voters in 
District IV during the entirety of the absentee voting period.  
  1 3. Following the close of polls o n election day, the 
Office of Elections issued a total of four printouts detailing 
the ongoing tabulation of votes in various races. 
   a. The first printout was issued at 6:09 p.m. and 
reported the result of  the race for the office of councilmember 
for District IV as follows: 
OZAWA, Trevor   10,597 (46.4%)  
WATERS, Tommy   10,529 (46.1%)  
Blank Votes:  1,686 ( 7.4%) 
Over Votes:      10 ( 0.0%) 
                                                           
 1 There are approximately 734 absentee return envelopes that the 
City Clerk retrieved after November 6, 2018, of which the City Clerk retains 
possession. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 7    b. The second printout was issued at 8:08 p.m. 
and reported the result of  the race for the office of 
councilmember for District IV as follows: 
WATERS, Tommy   11,616 (46.0%)  
OZAWA, Trevor   11,609 (46.0%)  
Blank Votes:  2,009 ( 8.0%) 
Over Votes:      10 ( 0.0%) 
   c. The third printout was issued at 9:36 p.m. and 
reported the result of  the race for the office of councilmember 
for District IV as follows: 
WATERS, Tommy   17,795 (46.4%)  
OZAWA, Trevor   17,723 (46.2%)  
Blank Votes:  2,796 ( 7.3%) 
Over Votes:      10 ( 0.0%) 
   d. The fourth printout was issued at 11:23 p.m. 
and reported the result of  the race for the office of 
councilmember for District IV as follows: 
WATERS, Tommy   17,795 (46.4%)  
OZAWA, Trevor   17,723 (46.2%)  
Blank Votes:  2,796 ( 7.3%) 
Over Votes:      10 ( 0.0%) 
  1 4. The following day, on November 7, 2018, at 4:11 
a.m., the Office of Elections generated a fifth printout for the 
election.  The result of  the race for the office of 
councilmember for District IV was reported as follows: 
 
OZAWA, Trevor   18,357 (46.3%)  
WATERS, Tommy   18,335 (46.3%)  
Blank Votes:  2,908 ( 7.3%) 
Over Votes:      10 ( 0.0%) 
  1 5. Although the fifth printout was entitled “Final 
Summary Report,” a “post -election process” occurred over the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 8 next week that resulted in an additional three votes being added 
to the totals from the fifth printout: one vote each for Ozawa 
and Waters and one blank vote.  A second “Final Summary Report” 
was generated on November 15, 2018 and posted on the Office of 
Elections’ website.  The final result of the race for the office 
of councilmember for District IV was reported as follows: 
 
OZAWA, Trevor   18,358 (46.3%)  
WATERS, Tommy   18,336 (46.3%)  
Blank Votes:  2,909 ( 7.3%) 
Over Votes:      10 ( 0.0%) 
  16 . According to this Final Summary Report, the 
difference in the number of votes between Waters and Ozawa was 
22 votes.  The report thus indicated that Ozawa had received the 
highest number of votes. 
Post-Election Communications  
  1 7. On November 16, 2018, Waters sent an e- mail to 
Chief Election Officer Scott T. Nago (“Chief Election Officer 
Nago”) and City Clerk Takahashi requesting a range of 
information regarding, inter alia, the handling of absentee 
ballots and the manner in which ballots we re tabulated in the 
November 6, 2018 election.  Among the specific items of 
information Waters requested were an explanation of where and 
how the new ballots counted in the fifth printout were cast; the 
details of when and how mail- in absentee r eturn envelopes  were 
received, including the times at which mail-in absentee return 
envelopes were picked up or delivered on election day; an ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 9 accounting of the absentee ballots that were invalidated within 
District IV; the details of the process employed in validating 
signatures on absentee return  envelopes; a list of the devices 
used to cast and tabulate votes, along with the margin of error 
associated with each ; a list of “overages and underages” and the 
details of how such  discrepancies are addressed in a manner that 
does not impact the final election result; and an explanation of 
how voter intent is determined in a close election without 
resorting to hand counting the ballots.  Waters also offered to 
sit down with Chief Election Officer Nago or City Clerk 
Takahashi to discuss his questions.     
  1 8. On November 21, 2018, Waters received a response 
from Jaime Kataoka of the Office of Elections providing the 
final summary report of the November 6, 2018 election, the 
“Records of Ballots Cast,” the “AB -3: Walk and Mail Voted Ballot 
Summary” for the absentee mail and walk -in polling places, and a 
matrix of the overages and underages for the district/precincts 
associated with the District IV race. 
 
 19. On November 23, 2018, Waters received a letter 
from Rex Quidilla, Elections Administrator for the Office of the 
City Clerk, Elections Division, City and County of Honolulu, 
State of Hawai‘i, indicating that the City Clerk invalidated 616 
mail absentee return envelopes for the 2018 general election and 
providing a breakdown of the reasons for the invalidation.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 10   20 . The answers from Kataoka and Quidilla are the only 
information that Waters received in response to his inquiry.2 
  2 1. A November 19, 2018 article published in the 
Honolulu Star-Advertiser that was included as an exhibit in a 
filing by Waters included  relevant information that was not 
included in Kataoka’s or Quidilla’s answer to Waters’s inquiry.  
Specifically, the article described the transfer from Office of 
Elections personnel to the City Clerk of absentee return 
envelopes that were dropped off at in- person polling places, the 
verification process, and the subsequent transfer of ballots 
back to the Office of Elections for tallying.  The article  cites 
Quidilla as the source of the information. 
The Election Contest filed by Waters (SCEC- 18-0000909)  
  2 2. On November 26, 2018, Waters filed a complaint 
contesting the election results for the District IV 
councilmember race.  
  2 3. Waters asserts two counts for relief: 
                                                           
 2 In a complaint filed by thirty -nine registered voters residing in 
District IV, discussed infra, the voters allege that they also made inquiries 
with the Office of Elections regarding the handling of the ballots that were 
included in the fifth printout and were directed to the Office of the 
Attorney General.  The voters indicate that the deputy attorney general to 
whom the calls were referred initially stated that she had no information 
about the ballots included in the fifth printout, the procedures used, or any 
established rules governing the chain of custody of absentee return 
envelopes.  The voters allege that one week later, the deputy attorney 
general confirmed that the Office of the Attorney General had no knowledge of 
any written procedures or rules regarding the chain of custody, nor of how 
the ballots were actually transported on the night of the election.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 11    a.  Count I -- Waters alleges that the 1,2863 
absentee ballots in the District IV election
 that were counted 
between the fourth printout and the fifth printout were 
miscounted because they were transported to and received by the 
clerk in the State Capitol on November 6, 2018, nearly six hours 
after polls had already closed, in violation of HRS § 15- 9 
(2009).  The improper inclusion and counting of the 1,286 
invalid absentee ballots after 100 percent of the 
district/precincts in District IV reported their ballot 
tabulations “directly changed the proper result of the 
election.”  
 
  b.  Count II  -- Waters alleges that 39,603 ballots 
in the District IV election were miscounted because the 
difference of 22 votes is 0.00055 of 1%, which falls within  the 
margin of error for the vote- counting machines used in Hawai ‘i 
for the 2018 general election,  and that the failure to verify 
the accuracy of the count, including the 2,908 “blank” votes and 
                                                           
 3 In Waters’s complaint, Waters identifies the number of absentee 
ballots that were allegedly received after the close of polls as 1,286 
absentee votes, consisting of 1,173 counted ballots and 113 blank ballots.  
(At various points in the complaint, Waters also makes reference to 1,174 
counted ballots.)  These numbers roughly correspond with the difference 
between the number of votes reported by the Office of Elections in the fourth 
and fifth printout or the November 15, 2018 “Final Summary Report.”  Quidilla 
initially stated in a filing to this court that there were 1 ,286 absentee 
return envelopes for District IV received by the City Clerk on election day.  
In a January 14, 2019 declaration, Quidilla clarified that the actual number 
of absentee return envelopes received on election day was 1,201.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 12 the 10 ballots which indicated votes for both candidates, and 
the invalidated and spoiled ballots, “constituted an error, 
mistake or irregularity which would change the outcome of the 
election.”   
  2 4. Waters asks the court to (1) invalidate the 
inclusion of 1,174 invalid absentee ballots counted in the  fifth 
printout and declare him the prevailing candidate and winner of 
the election for Honolulu City Councilmember for District IV; 
(2) order a hand count and human inspection of the 39,603 
ballots cast in District IV and other invalidated ballots; or 
(3) invalidate the result of the general election for 
councilmember for District IV and require that a new election be 
held. 
The Election Contest Filed by 39 Voters Who Reside and are 
Registered to Vote in District IV (SCEC-18-000091 0) 
  2 5. On November 26, 2018, 39 voters who reside and are 
registered to vote in Council District IV filed a complaint 
contesting the election results for the District IV 
councilmember race.   
  2 6. The 39 voters assert three counts for relief: 
(1) the “Last Printout Procedure G ives Rise to a M istake” (Count 
I); (2) the “Margin of E rror Constitutes a M istake” (Count (II); 
and (3) “D iscrepancies C onstitute F raud and/or M istake” (Count 
III). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 13   2 7. The 39 voters allege that Chief Election Officer 
Nago, the Office of Elections, and City Clerk Takahashi 
“miscounted, misapplied, and mishandled more than 22 valid 
ballots cast in the District IV election ” and that if the 
ballots had been properly counted and handled as prescribed by 
law, Waters would have been deemed to have received the majority 
of validly cast votes.  They further allege that the difference 
of 22 votes out of more than 39,000 votes is within the margin 
of error for the utilized voting machines 
that was previously 
identified in a 1999 State of Hawai ʻi Legislative Auditor’s 
Report of an election oversight committee.
 
  2 8. The 39 voters ask the court to (1) exclude the 
fifth printout and declare that Waters received the majority of 
valid votes cast in the District IV election; (2) invalidate the 
results of the District IV election due to an inability to 
determine the winner; or (3) require a hand recount in order to 
ensure an accurate count of all votes cast.  
City Clerk Takahashi’s Answer to the Complaints  
  29 . On December 6, 2018, City Clerk Takahashi filed 
answers to the two complaints.   
  3 0. City Clerk Takahashi denies any improper conduct 
or that any irregularities transpired during the second special 
election.  City Clerk Takahashi contends that all of the 
absentee return envelopes that were received on election day, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 14 either by USPS mail or drop- off delivery at a polling place, 
were received and handled in compliance with HRS § 15- 9(a), and 
thus were correctly included in the vote count of the ballots 
for Council District IV.   
  3 1. With respect to the allegations in the complaints 
related to the alleged margin of error and discrepancies 
involved in the counting of votes, City Clerk Takahashi explains 
that he is not involved in any way in the tabulation of ballots 
or printouts and has no knowledge as to the truth or falsity of 
the allegations.  
  3 2. Attached to City Clerk Takahashi’s answers are 
declarations by Quidilla and himself setting forth additional 
details regarding the handling, collection, and receipt of 
absentee return en velopes on election day.   
 
 33. Consistent with past practice, representatives of 
the City Clerk met with representatives of the USPS ’s Oʻahu 
operations ( “USPS O‘ahu”) on September 28, 2018 in preparation 
for the 2018 general election.   
 
 34. During the meeting, the representatives of the 
City Clerk and USPS O‘ahu discuss ed the USPS’s collection and 
handling of the mail absentee return envelopes in the USPS 
mailing system on election day.  The following procedures were 
agreed to: ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 15    a. USPS personnel would conduct a “sweep” of its 
Honolulu Airport mail processing plant at 6:00 p.m. on election 
day to collect all mail -in absentee return envelopes within the 
facility .  
   b. In addition to the regularly scheduled 9:00 
a.m. mail pickup, the City Clerk would conduct two  additional 
pickups to retrieve the mail -in absentee return envelopes 
collected during the 6:00 p.m. “sweep” of the mail process ing 
plant.  The first additional pickup time was scheduled for 6:30 
p.m.  A second additional pickup time was scheduled to occur at 
7:30 p.m. if there were  any mail -in absentee return envelopes 
collected during the 6:00 p.m. “sweep” of the mail processing 
plant that were not included in the 6:30 p.m. pickup . 
  35. Neither City Clerk Takahashi ’s nor Quidilla ’s 
declaration  provided actual details of what occurred at the USPS 
Honolulu Airport mail processing plant on the day of the 
election , and there is no evide nce in the record regarding the  
procedure s actually employed by the USPS on election day . 
  36. Following the close of polls on  the day of the 
November 6, 2018 general election, Office of Elections personnel 
completed the transfer of the absentee return en velopes that 
were dropped off by hand at in-person polling places to the City 
Clerk at approximately 9:00 p.m.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 16   37. Upon receiving the absentee return envelopes from 
the Office of Elections, the City Clerk’s staff transported the 
envelopes to the City Clerk’s Elections Division facility 
located near the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport  for 
signature validation.   
  38. The City Clerk received a total of 8,120 absentee 
return envelopes on the day of the election , 1,201 of which were 
from registered voters in Council District IV.  
  39. The City Clerk validated 8,088  of the absentee 
return envelopes  received on electi on day, of which 1,189 were 
from registered voters in Council District IV.  
  40. The City Clerk  invalidated a total of 620  absentee 
return envelopes  received throughout  the absentee voting period, 
of which 91 were for Council District IV.  The ballots were  
invalidated for the following reasons:   
   a. 433 absentee return envelopes , of which 64 
were from voters registered in  Council District IV , were 
invalidated because the signature on the voter’s affirmation 
statement was deemed  not to correspond with the voter’s 
signature on the absentee ballot request or voter registration 
affidavit.  
   b. 140 absentee return envelopes , of which  17 
were from voters registered in Council District IV , were ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 17 invalidated because no signature appeared on the voter 
affirmation statement.  
   c. 43  absentee return envelopes,  of which  9 were 
from voters registered in Council District IV, were invalidated 
because the voter was found to have already voted or voted at 
the wrong precinct, to have cancelled the ballot, to be 
deceased, or to have relocated to the Mainland.  
   d. 4  absentee return envelopes, of which 1 was 
from a voter registered in Council District IV, were inv alidated 
because the voter had cast an electronic ballot without 
providing the required privacy waiver or affirmation documents. 
  41 . After the signatures on the absentee return 
envelopes were validated, the City Clerk contacted the Office of 
Elections to arrange for the pickup of the envelopes.  The 
Office of Elections picked up the sealed absentee return 
envelopes at approximately 12:30 a.m. on November 7, 2018, and 
transported the envelopes to the State Capitol for opening and 
ballot tabulation.   
The Motions to Dismiss or, in the Alternative,  
 Motions for Summary Judgment  
  42 . On December 6, 2018, Chief Election Officer Nago 
and the Office of Elections (collectively, the “State 
Defendants”) filed motions in both cases to dismiss the election 
complaints or, in the alternative, for summary judgment.  They ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 18 ask the court to declare that Ozawa was elected as councilmember 
for District IV. 
  43 . In the motions , the State Defendants contend that 
the complaints  lack any allegations that demonstrate errors, 
mistakes, or irregularities that would change the outcome of the 
election.   
  44 . The State Defendants contend that both the 
absentee return envelopes that were dropped off at polling 
places and the mail- in absentee return envelopes were received 
by the close of the polls, verified, and securely transported to 
the counting center at the State Capitol to be opened and 
counted with the remaining ballots.  This handling is in 
compliance with all applicable election laws, the State 
Defendants argue. 
  4 5. The State Defendants assert that, although the 
difference in the votes cast for Ozawa and Waters is small, 
there is no statutory provision for an automatic recount of the 
ballots.  They argue that the election challengers did not 
provide specific informa tion regarding any margin of error for 
the voting machines, and they thus failed to provide actual 
information of mistakes or errors sufficient to change the 
result of the election as required by law .  
  4 6. Lastly, the State Defendants contend that any 
suggestion that a “large shift towards Ozawa” in the fifth ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 19 printout indicates fraud or mistake is purely speculative and 
thus legally insufficient.  
  4 7. Attached to the motions to dismiss or, in the 
alternative, motions for summary judgment, are declarations from 
Chief Election Officer Nago and Rich Geppert, one of the 
professional services managers for Hart InterCivic, Inc. 
(“Hart”), the vendor of the electronic voting machines used in 
the 2018 elections.  The declarations provide details regarding 
the handling, tabulation,  and reporting of votes in the 2018 
general election. 
  4 8. The voting system that was used during the 2018 
general election was inspected and tested by official observers 
in preparation for use in  the general election, and official  
observers were present at the State Capitol to observe the 
counting of ballots.   
  49 . There are four  scheduled times on election night 
at which the Office of Elections releases reports of the 
election tallies as they then stand: (1) upon the close of 
polls, (2) at 8:30 p.m., (3) at 10:00 p.m., and (4) at 11:30 
p.m.  The Office of Elections then releases a final election 
night report once all ballots have been counted.  I t is not 
uncommon for the final report of the night to come in the early 
morning hours following the day of the election.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 20   5 0. In the November 6, 2018 race for councilmember for 
District IV, the 4:11 a.m. fifth printout that was released on 
November 7, 2018,  included the absentee ballots provided to the 
counting center by the City Clerk as well as so- called 
“defective ballots” that had been duplicated for counting .4   
 
 51. On the night of the general election, a  manual 
audit team audited the computer- generated tally of ballots voted 
at the polls as well as mail -in absentee ballots to confirm  the 
accuracy of the vote counting system.   
  5 2. The audit team did not request an expanded audit.  
  5 3. Should a recount be required, the Office of 
Elections states that it is required to follow the same set of 
rules in counting the ballots as was used on election day.    
  5 4. In sum, Chief Election Officer Nago was not aware 
of any issues or problems with the accuracy of the voting and 
vote counting system, the handling of ballots, or any other 
matters that would impact the integrity of the general election 
results in Council District IV.  
  5 5. On December 14, 2018, City Clerk Takahashi filed 
joinders to the motions to dismiss or, in the alternative, 
                                                           
 4 A “defective ballot” is “any ballot delivered to the counting 
center that cannot be processed and read by a central counter or precinct 
counter.”  When this occurs, a “duplicate ballot” is created, which is “a 
ballot used solely for the purpose of creating a facsimile of a defective 
ballot that is reproduced for counting and tabulation.”  HAR § 3 -172-1. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 21 motions for summary judgment with respect to claims and issues 
related to the collection, receipt, and handling of the mail- in 
absentee return envelopes and the functions of the City Clerk in 
the election process.   
Ozawa’s Answer s to the Complaints  
  5 6. On December 17, 2018, Ozawa, who had been granted 
permission to intervene in these election contests, filed 
answers to the respective election complaints.   
  5 7. Ozawa argues that City Clerk Takahashi and the 
Office of Elections have averred and explained that all  ballots 
that were counted as part of the fifth printout were received 
before the closing of the polls.  Ozawa further argues that 
there is no evidence of provable fraud and that simply  alleging 
that the purported margin of error exceeds the margin by which 
the vote was decided is legally insufficient because there is no 
evidence that any miscalculated votes were cast for Waters.  
Ozawa thus maintains that neither Waters nor the 39 voters have 
met their burden to prevail in their respective election 
challenges.   
 
 58. On December 17, 2018, Ozawa also filed substantive 
joinders to the State Defendants ’ motions to dismiss or, in the 
alternative, motions for summary judgment.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 22 The December 28, 2018 Order  
  59 . On December 28, 2018, this court issued an order 
directing Chief Election Officer Nago, the Office of Elections, 
and City Clerk Takahashi to provide information setting forth 
the margin of error for the electronic vote counting machines 
that were used in the November 6, 2018 election and information 
setting forth how the intent of the voter is ensured in a close 
election without a hand recount, which was previously requested 
by Waters shortly after the election and before he filed his 
complaint.   
  
60. On December 31, 2018, the State Defendants filed a 
response to the court’s December 28, 2018 order.5  Included with 
the response are declarations from Chief Election Officer Nago 
and from David Magedson, a program manager for Hart.  The 
declarations set forth information regarding the electronic 
voting systems used in the November 6, 2018 election. 
                                                           
 5 On December 31, 2018, City Clerk Takahashi filed his response to 
the court’s December 28, 2018 order.  City Clerk Takahashi explains that he 
is not involved in the tabulation of ballots or review of “marginal marks” on 
ballots and, therefore, he does not have any information to provide the court 
and the parties in response to the court’s request for information.  City 
Clerk Takahashi notes that he relies on Chief Election Officer Nago and the 
Office of Election’s response to the court’s request for inf ormation.  The 
same day, Ozawa also filed a response to the court’s December 28, 2018 order 
in which he reiterates his contention that the election challengers’ 
complaints fail to meet their burden of demonstrating fraud or mistake that 
would alter the result of the election or make it impossible to determine an 
accurate result. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 23   6 1. Since 2008 , Hawai ‘i has utiliz
ed the Hart voting 
system, which is composed of three main components:  (1) eSlate, 
an electronic voting unit on which a voter may directly cast a 
vote; (2) eScan, a digital ballot imaging precinct counter that 
allows a voter to cast a vote by inserting a paper ballot into 
the machine; and (3) Ballot Now, which is software that utilizes 
high-speed scanners to scan and tally absentee ballots.  
 
 62. The Hart voting system is certified to federal 
standards, which relate to the initial testing of the machines.  
See Federal Election Commission, I Voting System Standards: 
Performance Standards § 3.2.1 - Accuracy Requirements (2002).  
The error rate in the federal standards refers to a misreading 
of ballot positions that is not attributable to an error on the 
part of the voter, and it thus addresses only situations in 
which a ballot has been properly marked.  
 
  6 3. The Ballot Now system record s a digital im age of a 
voted ballot with a resolution of approximately 200 dots per 
inch, which is saved on the Ballot Now system and used for all 
subsequent election activities.  The software counts the number 
of marked pixels inside each option box in the digital image  to 
determine whether a vote has been cast for that option.   If more 
than 4.2% of the pixels are marked , the option box will 
generally be recorded as having been marked. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 24   6 4. Thus, when a voter makes a “marginal mark” or a 
mark that does not fully comply with ballot instructions, the 
vote will generally be counted if 4.2% or more of the pixels 
within the option box are mark ed. 
 
 65. When an option box is marked so that the number of 
pixels marked falls within approximately seven pixels of 4.2%, 
it is possible for an option box to be read as marked in one 
scan but read as unmarked in a second scan (or vice- versa).  
Studies of past election data have shown that around 0.046% of 
option boxes fall into the pixel range where this variance can 
occur. 6
  66 . On January 4, 2019, Waters filed a reply  to the 
State Defendants ’ response to the December 28, 2018 order.   
  67 . Waters argues that Chief Election Officer Nago and 
the Office of Elections’ responses are misleading  and reveal 
that the Hart system does not ensure the intent of the voter is 
honored in a close election without a hand count because it 
disregards ballots that are not “properly marked” regardless of 
                                                           
 6 Ballot Now can also apply an algorithm (the Ballot Now Overvote 
Reduction Algorithm, or “BNORA”) to decrease this variance rate by 
eliminating false overvotes caused by pen rests, dirt, or other small marks 
on the ballot.  The precinct counters used in polling places and at absentee 
walk-in locations do not use BNORA.  Instead, as the voter is present in 
those locations, the precinct counters are equipped to return the ballot to 
the voter if the precinct counter detects an overvote (i.e. , more voting 
positions have been marked in a contest than permitted ) or a blank vote for a 
contest (i.e., no voting position in the contest has been marked).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 25 the evidence of voter intent.  Waters states that the manner in 
which marginal marks are counted is problematic because the 
system’s cutoff of 4.2% of pixels marked is an arbitrary 
standard. 
  
68. In his reply , Waters also argues that absentee 
ballots that were not received by the City Clerk or the Office 
of Elections by the close of the polls at 6:00 p.m. were wrongly 
counted in the election results.  Waters contends that, pursuant 
to HRS § 15-9(a), absentee ballots must be received by the City 
Clerk by the close of the polls, which is 6:00 p.m.  He 
maintains that, contrary to statute, the ballots were received 
by the City Clerk 
during the 6:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. pickups at 
the airport.  Waters contends that these ballots must be 
invalidated, thereby altering the result of the election and 
making him the victor. 
The 39 Voters’ Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss or,   
in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment 
  69 . On January 4, 2019, the 39 voters filed a 
memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss or, in the 
alternative, motion for summary judgment.   
  7 0. The 39 voters argue that they have carried their 
burden of demonstrating fraud or mistake that could alter the 
election result.  They  contend that HRS § 15 -9 obligated the 
City Clerk to invalidate the absentee return envelopes that were ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 26 collected from the USPS after the closing of the polls.  The 39 
voters argue  that the invalidation of these ballots would 
ultimately change the outcome of the election in Council 
District IV. 
  7 1. The 39 voters also argue that the State 
Defendants’ response to this court’s December 28, 201 8 order 
raises questions about the actual margin of error because blind 
acceptance of the manufacturer ’s stated error  rate ignores 
documented instances in other states in which the Hart system 
has produced more inaccurate results.  The State Defendants have 
a duty to protect voter rights and ensure accurate results, the 
39 voters contend, and this includes investigating the accuracy 
of the manufacturer ’s assurances.   
  7 2. The 39 voters  further contend that the State 
Defendants’  response to this court’s December 28, 2018 order 
demonstrates that the State applies an inconsistent standard in 
determining voter intent.  In the absence of any explanation of 
how the cutoff of 4.2% of pixels was determined, the voters 
argue, the number must be regarded as an arbitrary figure.  The 
voters assert that this standard, in conjunction with the 
variance that occurs when a marginal marking falls within seven 
pixels of the threshold, demonstrates that no meaningful 
distinction exists between those marginal votes that are counted 
and those that are not. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 27 The January 8, 2019 Order  
  7 3. On January 8, 2019, this court issued  an order 
directing the State Defendants and City Clerk Takahashi to 
provide a detailed explanation of the factual circumstances and 
procedures that were actually followed by 
the USPS and the City 
Clerk regarding the handling and collection of the mail -in 
absentee return envelopes retrieved from the USPS on election 
day.  The order requested, among other information, the time(s) 
of the collection and pickup of the absentee ballots; a 
description of the procedures that were actually used to ensure 
that any mail-in absentee return envelopes received, collected, 
or “swept” by the 
USPS after 6:00 p.m. on election day were set 
aside and not counted; and an accounting of whether any mail -in 
absentee return envelopes received, collected, or “swept” by the 
USPS after 6:00 p.m. were included in the election results.  
  7 4. On January 10, 2019, the City Clerk filed a  
response to the court’s January 8, 2019 order.  
  75 . City Clerk Takahashi submits that the Office of 
the City Clerk complied with applicable statutes and 
administrative rules governing the collection of mail- in 
absentee return envelopes related to Council District IV and 
other contests that occurred on November 6, 2018.   
  76 . There were three scheduled pickup times on 
election day at which City Clerk personnel retrieved mail-in ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 28 absentee return envelopes from the USPS airport facility: (1) a 
9:00 a.m. pickup; (2) a 6:30 p.m. pickup; and (3) a 7:30 p.m. 
pickup.   
  77 . The 9:00 a.m. pickup time was a pre -established 
time for City Clerk personnel to pick up mail -in absentee return 
envelopes from the USPS airport facility.   City Clerk personnel 
picked up mail -in absentee return envelopes from the facility at 
this time on a daily basis (excluding Sundays) from October 17, 
2018 through November 6, 2018.   
  78 . The 6:30 p.m. pickup and 7:30 p.m. pickup were 
additional pickup times scheduled only for election day. 
  79 . On November 6, 2018, City Clerk personnel picked 
up mail-in absentee return envelopes at the USPS airport 
facility at approximately 9:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.   
  8 0. City Clerk personnel received a call from USPS 
personnel at approximately 7:00 p.m. on November 6, 2018, during 
which USPS personnel informed City Clerk personnel that 
additional mail- in absentee return envelopes were ready for 
pickup.  
  8 1. At approximately 7:30 p.m., City Clerk personnel 
picked up additional mail -in absentee return envelopes from the 
USPS airport facility.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 29   8 2. The following chart summar izes the number of mail-
in absentee return envelopes picked up by City Clerk personnel 
on election day at 6:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.: 
 Island-wide  District IV only  
USPS Airport 6:30 p.m. 
pickup   
1,093   
165 
USPS Airport 7:30 p.m. 
pickup   
1,247   
185 
Total  2,340  350 
 
  8 3. At approximately 12:00 a.m. on November 7, 2018, 
the City Clerk contacted the Office of Elections to arrange for 
the pickup of the mail -in absentee return envelopes that were 
picked up from the USPS at 6:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., as well as 
the absentee envelopes that were dropped off at polling places.   
  8 4. In his declaration, City Clerk Takahashi explains 
that he relies on the processes and procedures used by the USPS 
in implementing the agreement between the City Clerk and the 
USPS covering the USPS’s receipt, collection , and/or “sweeping” 
of its facilities and system as of 6:00 p.m. on November 6, 
2018.  He states that the practical administrative reality of 
the receipt, collection,  and pickup of mail -in absentee return 
envelopes in the election process requires the City Clerk to 
work cooperatively and in conjunction with the USPS , as occu rred 
in this election cycle  and past election cycles.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 30   85. Mail-in absentee return envelopes  that were not 
included in the 9:00 a.m., 6:30 p.m., or 7:30 p.m. pickups on 
November 6, 2018 , have been retrieved by City Clerk personnel 
and set aside by the City Clerk, but they have not been provided 
to the Office of Elections.  As of the filing of City Clerk 
Takahashi’s declaration , there were 734 mail-in absentee return 
envelopes  that the City Clerk retrieved after November 6, 2018 . 
  86. City Clerk Takahashi contacted the  USPS Honol ulu 
District to request that one of its officers submit a 
declaration to provide information relative to the USPS’s 
handling of mail -in absentee return envelopes for the November 
6, 2018 election.  He was informed that the USPS would not be 
able to submit a declaration in response to th e court’s January 
8, 2019 order  given the court’s timeframe and deadline .  The 
USPS did not give City Clerk Takahashi  any indication that such 
a declaration could be made.   There is thus no evidence in the 
record of what actu ally occurred at the USPS airport facility on 
November 6, 2018.  
  87. On January 9, 2019, the State Defendants filed 
their response to the court’s January 8, 2019 order.  The State 
Defendants explained that they are not involved in the handling 
and collect ion of the mail-in absentee ballots from the USPS on 
the day of the general election and have no information to 
provide this court and the parties in response to the January 8, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 31 2019 order.  They state that they rely on City Clerk Takahashi’s 
response. 
  88 . On January 9, 2019, Ozawa filed his response to 
the court’s January 8, 2019 order.  
  89 . Ozawa argues that he was duly elected as 
councilmember for District IV pursuant to the procedures set 
forth by statute and administrative rules.  Ozawa contends that, 
under HAR § 3-174-2(a), the City Clerk was authorized to 
designate the USPS as the City Clerk’s representative, thus 
allowing the USPS to legally receive absentee ballots on the 
City Clerk’s behalf .  Any ballots the USPS received prior to the 
close of polls were thus validly counted, Ozawa contends.  
  9 0. Ozawa maintains that there is no evidence that the 
USPS received any ballots after 6:00 p.m. and that City Clerk 
Takahashi has averred that the USPS collects only absentee 
ballots that are at the mail processing plant at 6:00 p.m. 
  9 1. Ozawa thus argues that there is no evidence that 
any absentee return envelopes that were not validly received 
within the time limit provided in HRS § 15- 9(a) were included in 
the election results. 
  9 2. On January 10, 2019, the 39 voters filed a reply  
to the respective responses filed by Chief Election Officer Nago 
and the Office of Elections, Ozawa, and City Clerk Takahashi 
with respect to the court’s January 8, 2019 order.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 32   93. The 39 voters contend that City Clerk Tak ahashi 
did not provide a detailed explanation as to what occurred at 
the USPS facility with respect to the 6:00 p.m. “sweep.”  They 
argue that City Clerk Takahashi admits that 350 mail -in absentee 
return envelopes were picked up from the USPS after 6:00 p.m. on 
election day, which does not satisfy a plain reading of HRS § 
15-9(a).  Thus, the 39 voters maintain that only those ballots 
that were re trieved by City Clerk Takahashi, the Office of 
Elections, or the polling places by 6:00 p.m. may be properly 
counted. 
  94. On January 11, 2019, Waters filed a reply to the 
responses that were filed with respect to the co urt’s January 8, 
2019 order.  
  95. Waters contend s that the City Clerk’s responses 
demonstrate mistakes on the part of election officials .  Waters 
specifically argues that  the responses fail to detail  the 
procedures actually followed on November 6, 2018 , to ensure that 
the USPS’s handling and collection of mail-in absentee return 
envelopes were in accordance with HRS § 15 -9(a) and the 
agreement between the City Clerk and the USPS.   
  96. Waters further argues that HRS § 15 -9(a)(1) does 
not permit the City Clerk to designate a representative to 
receive mail -in absentee return envelopes, as is pe rmitted under 
HRS § 15 -9(a)(2) and (3).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 33   97 . Waters thus argues that City Clerk Takahashi 
acknowledges that 350 ballots were received by the City Clerk 
after 6:00 p.m.  The counting of these ballots was in violation 
of HRS § 15-9(a)(1), Waters concludes.   
The January 11, 2019 Order  
  98 . On January 11, 2019, the court issued an order 
(a) consolidating SCEC-18 -0000909 and SCEC- 18-0000910 for oral 
argument, (b) scheduling oral argument for January 15, 2019, at 
2:00 p.m., and (c)
 providing the parties an opportunity to file 
any further declarations and/or memoranda no later than 4:30 
p.m. on January 14, 2019. 
  99 . City Clerk Takahashi filed a declaration on 
January 14, 2019, stating  that he has no reason to believe and 
has been presented with no evidence that the USPS did not comply 
with the arrangement agreed to at the September 28, 2018 
meeting.  Like his previous submission, City Clerk Takahashi 
does not provide details that the arrangement was actually 
followed on election day.  
  10 0. Ozawa also filed a response on January 14, 2019.  
Ozawa maintains that for the City Clerk to carry out his duties, 
it is reasonably necessary that he be able to delegate the duty 
to receive absentee ballots by the close of polls.   
Specifically, Ozawa argues that the City Clerk can delegate to 
the USPS his duty to receive by 6:00 p.m. on election day the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 34 mail-in absentee return envelopes.  Ozawa does not provide any 
evidence that such a delegation of duty occurred for the 
November 6, 2018 election.
  
Oral Argument  
  10 1. Oral argument was held on January 15, 2019.  See 
Oral Argument, Waters v. Nago et al. (SCEC-18-0000909) and Iwasa 
et al. v. Nago et al. (SCEC-18 -0000910), 
http://oaoa.hawaii.gov/jud/oa/19/SCEC_18_909_910.mp3. 
  10 2. Counsel for the City Clerk acknowledged that the 
City Clerk did not “actually have in [his] hands as of 6:00 
p.m.” the mail absentee envelopes that were purportedly in the 
USPS system at 6:00 p.m.  See  Oral Argument at 47:33-47:41. 
  10 3. When asked about the City Clerk’s delegation of 
authority under HAR § 3-174-2, counsel for the City Clerk stated 
that “there’s no administrative rule or statutory guidance in 
terms of actual delegation.”  See Oral Argument at 41:39-41:55.  
Counsel then explained that he “think[s] the designated 
representative is what the City characterizes the USPS as[.]”  
See Oral Argument at 42:07-42:13.   
  1 04. Counsel for the City Clerk indicated  that the 
absentee return envelopes provide the City Clerk’s post office 
box as the return address, which is located at the USPS airport 
facility.  See 
Oral Argument at 42:56-43:22.  Counsel then 
clarified that the absentee return 
envelopes are gathered by the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 35 USPS from throughout the airport facility for pickup by the City 
Clerk and are physically “probably in USPS bins”  prior to being 
collected.  See Oral Argument at 43:58- 44:07.   
  1 05. Later, counsel for the City Clerk stated that he 
is not making any suggestion that the USPS is the City Clerk’s 
agent and explained that, within the statutory scheme, the USPS 
is a designated representative.  
See Oral Argument at 47:57-
48:28.   
  1 06. When asked whether the USPS knew that they were 
the designee under HRS § 15- 9, counsel for the City Clerk stated 
that he “believed ” that that was the function of the meeting 
that was held between representatives of the City Clerk and USPS 
O‘ahu representatives.  See Oral Argument at 53:26-54:30.  
  1 07. Counsel for the City Clerk reiterated the 
arrangement with the USPS and explained that it was agreed that, 
at 6:00 p.m., the USPS would “sweep” its facility of all the 
“blue envelopes ” (i.e., mail -in absentee return envelopes) to 
ensure that, as of that time, the City had as many blue 
envelopes as possible.  See  Oral Argument at 55:48-56 :00.  When 
asked about the definition of “sweep ,” counsel stated that it is 
a characterization of the efforts of the USPS to make sure that 
their entire facility gathers up the blue envelopes in their 
system as of 6:00 p.m.  See Oral Argument at 56:02- 56:54. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 36   1 08. Counsel  for the City Clerk was asked about the 
difference in the number of envelopes between the 6:30 p.m. and 
the 7:30 p.m. picku p following the “sweep” by the USPS, the 
latter of which included a greater number of absentee return 
envelopes despite being intended to retrieve only those absentee 
return envelopes that were missed during the previous pickup.  
Counsel stated that “that is what the record reflects,” t hat he 
“ha[s] no explanation for it,” and that “that is just the 
universe of facts that we have to deal with.”  See Oral Argument 
at 57:57-59:22.    
  1 09. Counsel for the State Defendants explained that  
the Office of Elections relies on the City Clerk’s h andling of 
the absentee ballots.  Counsel noted the September 28, 2018 
meeting between representatives of the City Clerk and the USPS 
representatives and described their relationship as “at least an 
agency relationship. ”  Counsel  explained that she did not  know 
if the relationship was “a designated one” or whether the agency 
agreement had to be in writing.  See Oral Argument at 1:21:53-
1:24:07. 
  11 0. Counsel for the State Defendants explained that 
the 350 ballots that were picked up from the USPS at the 6:30 
p.m. pickup and the 7:30 p.m. pickup were “commingled  together, 
put through the scanner ” with the absentee ballots that were 
dropped off at the polling places as well as the facsimile ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 37 ballots that were created from the defective ballots and, 
therefore, cannot now be separated.  Counsel explained that the
Office of Elections would not be able to ascertain what the 
correct result would be if the 350 ballots were declared 
invalid.  See Oral Argument at 1:31:48-1:32:28.   
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  
  1. An election contest is instituted by filing a 
complaint in the supreme court “set[ting] forth any cause or 
causes, such as but not limited to, provable fraud, overages, or 
underages, that could cause a difference in the election 
results.”  HRS § 11 -172 (2009). 
  
2. A complaint challenging the results of an election 
pursuant to HRS § 11- 172 fails to state a claim unless the 
plaintiff alleges either 1) errors, mistakes or irregularities 
that could change the outcome of the election, see Tataii v. 
Cronin, 119 Hawai ‘i 337, 339, 198 P.3d 124, 126 (2008) (citing 
Akaka v. Yoshina, 84 Hawai‘i 383, 387, 935 P.2d 98, 102 (1997)); 
Funakoshi v. King, 65 Haw. 312, 317, 651 P.2d 912, 915 (1982), 
or 2) that the correct result cannot be ascertained because of a 
mistake or fraud on the part of the precinct officials.  HRS § 
11–174.5(b) (2009); Akaka, 84 Hawai ‘i at 387, 935 P.2d at 102.  
  3. In order for a complaint to be legally sufficient 
in the first circumstance, the complaint must include actual ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 38 information “show[ing] that the specif ic acts and conduct of 
which they complain would have had the effect of changing the 
results of the [] election.”  Elkins v. Ariyoshi, 56 Haw. 47, 
49, 527 P.2d 236, 237 (1974); Akaka, 84 Hawai ‘i at 
388, 935 P.2d 
at 103 (holding that,  in order for an election challenge to have 
merit, “the petitioner must ‘show that he [or she] ha[s] actual 
information of mistakes or errors sufficient to change the 
result’” (quoting Funakoshi , 65 Haw. at 316 –17, 651 P.2d at 
915)).  “An election contest cannot be based upon me re belief or 
indefinite information.”  Tataii, 119 Hawai‘i at 340, 198 P.3d at 
127.  Further, if the specific irregularities complained of do 
not “exceed the reported margin between the candidates, the 
complaint is legally insufficient because, even if its truth 
were assumed, the result of the election would not be affected.”  
Akaka, 84 Hawai ‘i at 388, 935 P.2d at 103 (citing Elkins, 56 Haw. 
at 49, 527 P.2d at 237). 
  4. Similarly, a complaint alleging that fraud or 
mistake by election officials has made it impossible to 
ascertain the correct result must include specific facts that if 
true would prevent an accurate determination of the election 
outcome.  Id.; Akizaki v. Fong , 51 Haw. 354, 461 P.2d 221 
(1969). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 39   5. Under either standard, “[i]t is not sufficient that 
the petitioner points to a ‘poorly run and inadeq uately 
supervised election process’ that evinces ‘room for abuse’ or 
‘possibilities of fraud.’”  Akaka, 84 Hawai ‘i at 388, 935 P.2d at 
103 (quoting Elkins
, 56 Haw. at 48, 527 P.2d at 237). 
  6. In Count I of his complaint, Waters alleges that 
the absentee ballots in the District IV election counted between 
the fourth printout and the fifth printout were miscounted 
because they were not delivered to the State Capitol for 
counting before the polls closed on election day.  Waters claims 
that as many as 1,2867 absentee return envelopes were not 
received by the City Clerk or the Office of Elections by the 
close of the polls at 6:00 p.m. on November 6, 2018.  Waters 
contends that the counting of these ballots violates HRS § 15-
9(a), and they therefore cannot be considered.   
 
 7. The 39 voters allege in Count I of their complaint 
that the City Clerk “miscounted, misapplied, and mishandled” the 
ballots included in the fifth printout by “failing to follow 
requirements set forth within the governing statutes and 
administrative rules.”  In subsequent filings, the voters 
clarified their argument, contending that the City Clerk had 
                                                           
 7 See supra, note 3.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 40 violated HRS § 15- 9(a) by collecting mail- in absentee return 
envelopes after the closing of the polls.  
  
8. Because Waters and the 39 voters allege a 
particular error that would invalidate a number of votes greater 
than the 22-vote margin by which the election was decided, they 
have alleged a specific mistake “sufficient to change the 
result,” as is required to state a claim for relief under ou r 
precedents.   Akaka, 84 
Hawai‘i at 388, 935 P.2d at 103 (quoting 
Funakoshi, 65 Haw. at 316 –17, 651 P.2d at 915).  8
  9. The court’s consideration of matters outside the 
pleadings converts a motion to dismiss into one for summary 
judgment.  Buscher v. Boning, 114 Hawai‘i 202, 212, 159 P.3d 814, 
824 (2007).   
                                                           
 8 The court notes that the response that Waters and the 39 voters 
received from the State Defendants and the City Clerk in answer to their 
inquiries shortly after the election put them at a disadvantage in meeting 
their burdens in this election contest.  Less than one day after the November 
15, 2018 “Final Summary Report” was generated, Waters sent questions to the 
Office of Elections and the City Clerk about the election.  Notwithstanding 
Waters’s status as a candidate with a clear interest in the outcome of the 
race, the Office of Elections and the City Clerk did not respond to all of 
the questions, particularly with respect to the pickup or delivery times of 
the mail- in absentee return envelopes on election day, the margin of error 
for the voting machines, and the manner in which a voter’s intent is ensured 
in a close election without a manual hand count.  Similarly, the 39 voters 
allege that their inquiries were directed to a deputy attorney general who 
was unable to provide any of their requested information.  Further, some of 
the information that Waters and the 39 voters sought and were not provided 
appears to have been readily available, as it appeared in a  newspaper article 
shortly thereafter.  We note that timely and complete responses to valid 
election day inquiries help to ensure a meaningful and transparent election 
process.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 41   10. Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no 
genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is 
entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  Silva v. City & Cty.  
of Honolulu, 115 Hawai‘i 1, 6, 165 P.3d 247, 252 (2007).  
  11. The fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.  Where the 
statutory language is plain and unambiguous, this court’s sole 
duty is to give effect to the statut e’s plain and obvious 
meaning, which is obtained primarily from the language contained 
in the statute itself.  Statutory language must be read in the 
context of the entire statute and construed in a manner 
consistent with its purpose.  See Castro v. Melchor, 142 Hawai ‘i 
1, 11, 414 P.3d 53, 63 (2018).   
  12. HRS § 15- 9, which governs the return and receipt 
of absentee return envelopes, provides as follows: 
(a)  The return envelope shall be:  
(1)  Mailed and must be received by the clerk  
issuing the absentee ballot not later 
than the closing of the polls on any 
election day; 
(2)  Delivered other than by mail to the clerk 
issuing the absentee ballot, or another 
election official designated by the clerk 
to act on the clerk ’s behalf, not later 
than the closing of polls on any election 
day; or 
(3)  Delivered other than by mail to any 
polling place within the county in which 
the voter is registered and deposited by 
a precinct official in the ballot box 
before the closing of the polls on any 
election day. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 42 (b)  Upon receipt of the return envelope from any person 
voting under this chapter, the clerk may prepare the 
ballots for counting pursuant to this section and 
section 15- 10.  
(c)  Prior to opening the return and ballot envelopes and 
counting the ballots, the return envelopes shall be 
checked for the following:  
(1)  Signature on the affirmation statement;  
(2)  Whether the signature corresponds with 
the absentee request or register as 
prescribed in the rules adopted by the 
chief election officer; and 
(3)  Whether the person is a registered voter 
and has complied with the requirements of 
sections 11- 15 and 11 -16.  
(d) If any of the above requirements is not met or 
if the return or ballot envelope appears to be 
tampered with, the clerk or the absentee ballot 
team official shall mark across the face of the 
envelope “invalid” and it shall be kept in the 
custody of the clerk and disposed of as 
prescribed for ballots in section 11 -154.  
(e) If an absentee polling place is established at 
the clerk’s office prior to election day, the 
officials of the absentee polling place shall 
check the return or ballot envelopes for the 
above requirements prior to depositing them in 
the correct absentee ballot box. 
(Emphases added); see also  HRS § 15-5(b) ( 2009 & Supp. 201 7) 
(addressing the delivery of absentee ballots by electronic 
transmission to voters and providing that “[t]he voter may 
return the voted ballots and executed forms by electronic 
transmission or mail; provided that they are received by the 
issuing clerk no later than the close of polls on election 
day”). 
  13. HRS § 15- 9 requires all absentee return envelopes 
to be returned no later than the closing of polls on any ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 43 election day.  By the closing of polls, all absentee return 
envelopes must be either (1) mailed and received by the clerk 
issuing the absentee ballot; (2) delivered other than by mail to 
the clerk issuing the absentee ballot or another election 
official designated by the clerk to act on the clerk’s behalf; 
or (3) delivered other than by mail to any polling place within 
the county in which the voter is registered.   
  14. Absentee ballots that are received before the 
closing of the polls on any election day in compliance with HRS 
§ 15-9(a) and that satisfy the affirmation and verification 
requirements will be counted in determining the result of the 
election.  HRS § 15- 10 (2009) ; see also, e.g. , HAR §§ 3 -174-11 
(procedure for validating signatures  on voter affirmation 
statements ); 3-174-12 (procedure for processing damaged, 
duplicate, or unidentifiable absentee return envelopes); 3-174-
13 (procedure for receiving absentee return envelopes at the 
precincts); 3-174-14 (procedures for processing absentee mail-in 
return envelopes after the polls close); 3 -174-15 (procedure for 
transfer of absentee return envelopes to counting center); 3-
174-16 (procedure upon receiving absentee ballots at the 
counting center); 3- 174-17 (procedure for processing absentee 
ballots at the counting center for electronic voting system 
ballots).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 44   15. For absentee return envelopes that are returned by 
mail on election day, HRS § 15-9(a)(1) re quires that the return 
envelope be “received by the clerk issuing the absentee ballot 
not later than the closing of the polls on any election day.”  
 
 16. HRS § 11- 131 (2009) provides that the closing time 
for the polls on election day is 6:00 p.m., subject to an 
exception for in- person voters who are in line at the close of 
voting.9  
 
 17. HAR § 3- 174-2(a), which was promulgated to 
implement HRS § 15- 9 and other election related statutes, 
provides that “[w]henever a duty is to be performed by the 
clerk, the clerk may delegate it to a designated representative 
or the election officials of the absentee polling place.”  
                                                           
 9 During oral argument, counsel for the City Clerk and the State 
Defendants argued that, because HRS § 11 -131 permits any voter who is waiting 
in line when the polls close to vote “irrespective of the closing hour of 
voting,” the actual closing of at least some polling places occurs after 6:00 
p.m.  Counsel for the City Clerk appeared to suggest that, under HRS § 15 -
9(a)(1), the City Clerk may validly receive mail -in absentee ballots after 
6:00 p.m. so long as in -person voting had not concluded at all polling 
places.  As an initial matter, the record contains no evidence by which this 
court could determine the actual closing of polls according to this argued 
interpretation.  And were we to adopt such a reading of the statute, it would 
follow that any voters whose absentee mail -in ballots were “received” after 
6:00 p.m. but before the conclusion of in -person voting would have been 
improperly disenfranchised if their votes were not included in the pick -ups 
following the 6:00 p.m. sweep.  In any event, we hold that HRS § 11 -131 
unambiguously establishes 6:00 p.m. as “the prescribed hour  for closing the 
polls” and it is this time that constitutes “the closing of the polls” for 
purposes of the HRS § 15 -9(a)(1) deadline.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 45   18. Thus, HRS § 15- 9(a) requires that all absentee 
mail-in return envelopes must be received by the City Clerk or 
an authorized representative by 6:00 p.m. on election day.10   
 
 19. There were 2,340 mail- in absentee return envelopes 
that were collected by USPS personnel at the Honolulu Airport 
mail processing plant on November 6, 2018, that were picked- up 
by the City Clerk’s representative at 6 :30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.  
350 of these were from voters registered in Council District IV.  
The City Clerk argues that these envelopes were the result of a 
“sweep” of the Honolulu Airport mail processing plant performed 
by USPS personnel at 6:00 p.m. in acco rdance with an “agreement” 
entered into at a September 28, 2018 meeting between 
representatives of the City Clerk and USPS O ‘ahu.
 
  
20. The record indicates that an agreement was made 
during the September 28, 2018 meeting between representatives of 
the City Clerk and USPS O‘ahu.  According to the agreement, USPS 
personnel would conduct a “sweep” of its Honolulu Airport mail 
                                                           
 10 Waters and the 39 voters point out that, unlike HRS § 15 -9(a)(2), 
HRS § 15- 9(a)(1) does not include language indicating mail -in absentee 
ballots may be received by “another election official designated by the clerk 
to act on the clerk’s behalf.”  Therefore, the election challengers argue, 
HAR § 3
-174-2(a) does not permit the City Clerk to delegate this duty to 
receive mail- in absentee return envelopes to anyone unaffiliated with the 
Office of the City Clerk.  Because we hold infra
 that no evidence was offered 
demonstrating that the City Clerk’s designated representative was present at 
the Honolulu Airport mail processing plant at 6:00 p.m. on November 6, 2018, 
we need not now decide the extent to which the City Clerk’s HRS § 15 -9(a)(1) 
duties are delegable to individuals other than City Clerk personnel.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 46 processing plant at 6:00 p.m. on election day.11  Despite 
requests by Waters and this court, no evidence was provided as 
to what actually occurred on November 6, 2018 at the USPS 
Airport mail processing plant at 6:00 p.m. (or any time 
thereafter) with respect to the mail- in absentee return 
envelopes.   
  
21. There is no dispute that at 6:00 p.m. the City 
Clerk’s office did not have physica l possession or control of 
the 350 mail-in absentee return envelopes for District IV that 
were purportedly “swept” by the USPS at its Airport facility and 
picked-
up by the City Clerk’s office at 6:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. 
on November 6, 2018.  While counsel for the City Clerk at oral 
argument indicated that the City Clerk has a post office box at 
the airport facility where mail
-in absentee return envelopes are 
sent, it was acknowledged that the envelopes were distributed 
throughout the facility, were not placed in an actual physical 
enclosure designated for the City Clerk’s exclusive use, and 
remained within the control of USPS personnel.  We thus hold 
that the facts of this case are legally insufficient to 
                                                           
  Neither the City Clerk nor the State Defendants provided an 
explanation in their filings as to what “sweep” means, the parameters of the 
“sweep,” or the length of time required to conduct a “sweep.”  As discussed 
supra, counsel for the City Clerk stated only during oral argument that a 
“sweep” is a characterization of the 
USPS’s efforts to gather up all absentee 
return envelopes in their facility as of 6:00 p.m.  11***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 47 establish the receipt of the challenged envelopes by the City 
Clerk at 6:00 p.m.  Cf. Stewarts’ Pharmacies, Ltd. v. Fase , 43 
Haw. 131, 145–46 (1959) (“When we apply the intended and correct 
meaning of the word ‘receipt’ as used in the act, it is 
conclusive to our minds that the tax of the retailer, referred 
to, is paid when the articles are in his possession and when the 
merchant has unlimited control and dominion over the [items].” 
(quoting Bacon & Sons v. Martin, 305 U.S. 380, 381 (1939)). 
  2 2. A pivotal question, therefore, is whether the City 
Clerk delegated his duty to “receive” the mail -in absentee 
return envelopes to a designated representative and, more 
specifically, whether such a duty was delegated to the USPS or 
another party present at the facility.12 
 
 23. Initially, it is noted that in the introduction to 
the “State and Local Election Mail -User’s Guide” published by 
the USPS and included with Ozawa’s Response to this court’s 
January 11, 2019 order, the USPS states that the guide contains 
“information election officials must consider before they” 
utilize the mail.13  Significantly, the Mail- User’s Guide 
                                                           
 12 This court makes no determination as to whether the USPS may be a 
designated representative for purposes of HRS § 15- 9(a)(1) and HAR § 3 -174-
2(a). 
 13 United States Postal Service, State and Local Election Mail -
User’s Guide 15 (March 2018), http://about.usps.com/publications/pub632.pdf  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 48 specifies that, if election officials wish to arrange to pick up 
mail-in absentee ballots at a postal service facility, they 
should “[l]et [their] Postal Service Election Mail coordinator 
know [their] cut-off time for receiving returned ballots” and 
“[a]rrange the latest time when an election official may pick up 
last-minute returns .”  (Emphasis added.)  The USPS thus appears 
to regard itself as neither an election official nor a 
representative thereof in the state and local elections in which 
the USPS provides assistance.  
  2 4. The September 28, 2018 meeting between 
representatives of the City Clerk14 and USPS O‘ ahu at which the 
USPS agreed to conduct a “sweep” of its Honolulu Airport mail 
processing plant at 6:00 p.m. on election day did not establish 
a delegation of the City Clerk’s duty to receive mail -in 
absentee return envelopes.15  No party has provided a declaration 
                                                           
 14 It is noted that the City Clerk’s declarations regarding the 
meeting do not indicate that any representative of the Chief Election Officer 
was in attendance, and the Chief Election Officer stated in response to this 
court’s January 8, 2019 order that he ha d no information to provide regarding 
the handling and collection of mail -in absentee ballots.  While the City 
Clerk is responsible for many aspects of a county -wide election, the ultimate 
responsibility to supervise a county election held in conjunction with a 
state election remains in the Chief Election Officer.  See  HRS § 11- 2(a) 
(2009) (tasking the Chief Election Officer with supervision of all state 
elections); HRS § 11 -91.5(e) (2009 & Supp. 2015) (“The chief election officer 
shall adopt rules pursuant  to chapter 91 to provide for uniformity in the 
conduct of federal, state, and county elections by mail.”).  
 15 As stated, HRS § 15 -9(a)(1) requires that absentee ballots 
delivered by mail must be received by the City Clerk by the close of polls on 
election day in order to be valid.  If the USPS as a whole had been 
designated as the City Clerk’s representative as argued by counsel for the 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 49 or document indicating that an individual, group, or entity had 
been designated as the City Clerk’s representative at the 
Honolulu Airport mail processing facility on election day.  
Prior to oral argument, neither the City Clerk nor the Chief 
Election Officer argued in any filing to this court that a 
designation had been made, nor did they identify any procedure 
by which such a designation would have occurred.16 
  2 5. The record is thus devoid of any evidence that the 
City Clerk effectively delegated his authority to receive mail-
in absentee return envelopes at 6:00 p.m. on election day to the 
USPS or any other designated representative.   
  2 6. What the record demonstrates instead is that, 
after the 9:00 a.m. mail pickup at the USPS Honolulu Airport 
location on November 6, 2018, City Clerk personnel conducted two 
                                                                        
(. . . continued)  
 
City Clerk, then arguably all ballots “received” by the USPS mail carriers or 
placed within USPS mail receptacles before 6:00 p.m. on election day should 
have been counted, effectively creating a “mail box rule” for mail -in 
absentee ballots.  At oral argument, counsel for the City Clerk contended 
that only those mail -in absentee return envelopes located within the USPS 
airport facility should be considered as timely received.  But it is self -
evident that the inanimate building cannot be designated as the City Clerk’s 
representative.  The law does not permit the City Clerk to enfranchise 
certain voters not meeting statutory requirements while disenfranchising 
others. 
16 During oral argument, counsel for the City Clerk stated that 
“there’s no administrative rule or statutory guidance in terms of actual 
delegation.”  Counsel then asserted, for the first time, that he “think[s] 
the designated representative is what the City characterizes the USPS as[.]”  
Counsel was unable to affirm whether the USPS knew of its purported status as 
the City Clerk’s designated representative under HRS § 15 -9(a)(1). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 50 additional pickups-- a 6:30 p.m. pickup and a 7:30 p.m. pickup.  
These additional pickups resulted in a total of 2,340 additional 
mail-in absentee return envelopes, including 350 from voters 
registered in Council District IV –-(a) 1,093 envelopes from the 
6:30 p.m. pickup, of which 165 were from voters registered in 
Council District IV; and (b) 1,247 envelopes from the 7:30 p.m. 
pickup, of which 185 were from voters registered in Council 
District IV.17  The 350 mail -in absentee return envelopes from 
voters registered in Council District IV were not received by 
the City Clerk or a designated representative prior to the close 
of polls. 
  2 7. While the City Clerk may have been trying to 
maximize the receipt of absentee votes by counting all mail -in 
absentee ballots that were in the USPS facility prior to the 
closing of polls, any implemented process was required to comply 
with HRS § 15- 9(a)(1).  Based on the record in this matter, it 
cannot be said that there was compliance with the requirement in 
                                                           
 17 In the declarations of the Elections Administrator for the City 
and County of Honolulu that were included with the City Clerk’s December 6, 
2018 answers to the complaints, it was stated that the 7:30 p.m. pickup was 
scheduled “if there were any mail absentee return envelopes collected dur ing 
the 6:00 p.m. sweep of the mail processing plant that were not picked up at 
the 6:30 p.m. pickup time.”  During oral argument, counsel for the City Clerk 
acknowledged that questions regarding the handling of mail -in absentee return 
envelopes were raised by the fact that more envelopes were picked up in the 
7:30 pickup than in the 6:30 p.m. pickup.  Counsel stated that there was no 
readily available explanation for the unexpectedly high number of envelopes 
that had ostensibly been missed in the 6:30 p.m.  pickup.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 51 HRS § 15-9(a)(1) that absentee return envelopes be received by 
the clerk not later than 
6:00 p.m.—the closing of the poll s. 
  28 . Additionally, under HRS § 15- 9(d), the Office of 
the City Clerk has a specific duty to mark and segregate any 
ballots that do not meet the requirements of HRS § 15- 9, which 
includes those absentee ballots that were not received prior to 
the closing of the polls.  Because the City Clerk was unable to 
make any direct representation regarding the procedures actually 
employed at the USPS Airport mail processing plant, the City 
Clerk is unable to provide adequate assurances that the 
requirements of HRS § 15- 9(d) were fulfilled. 
  29 . “The right of the people to shape the way in which 
they are governed through free and fair elections is the basis 
of our democratic society.”  See City & Cty. of Honolulu v. 
State, 143 Hawai‘i 455, 455, 431 P.3d 1228, 1230 (2018).  
“Implicit in that right is . . . the right to have as nearly 
perfect an election proceeding as can be provided,” which

(holding that the Hawai‘i Constitution provides for the “neutral 
and disinterested” resolution of election contests).  Based on 
the record in this matter and the applicable law, the inclusion ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 52 of the 350 mail- in absentee return envelopes that were 
considered for validation18 and the subsequent counting of the 
ballots from the validated envelopes in the vote tally for the 
election for District IV was improper.19   
  3 0. The counting of these 350 invalidly received 
absentee ballots potentially altered the election results for 
Council District IV and, inasmuch as they have been inseparably 
commingled with the other ballots, a recount that would exclude 
the invalid votes is not possible.20  Consequently, a correct 
                                                           
 18 During oral argument, counsel for the City Clerk was able to 
offer few specifics regarding the signature validation process conducted 
pursuant to HRS § 15 -9(c)(2) and HAR § 3 -174-11.  Counsel was not aware of 
any process by which voters are ever informed when their votes are 
invalidated because the signatures on their respective affirmation statements 
have been deemed not to correspond with those on their absentee ballot 
requests or voter registrations.  Further, counsel indicated that voter 
signatures from other sources are consulted for comparison, including 
drivers’ records from the “DMV” --a procedure that would appear to be 
unauthorized under the plain terms of HRS § 15 -9(c)(2) and HAR § 3 -174-11.  
We note that 64 votes from voters registered in Council District IV were 
invalidated on signature grounds in this race.  
 19 During oral argument, counsel for the State Defendants argued 
that the close- of-polls deadline for receiving mail -in absentee ballot set by 
HRS § 15- 9(a)(1) is directory rathe r than mandatory, relying on Lane v. Fern, 
20 Haw. 290, 299 –300 (Haw. Terr. 1910).  To the extent Lane, which 
interpreted a long -since repealed statute concerning the hours during which 
in-person polling places must remain open, stands for the proposition that 
this court should assume statutory time -limits on the casting of votes to be 
non-binding, we hold that it is fundamentally incompatible with our more 
recent precedent and must be regarded as overruled.  
See Akizaki, 51 Haw. at 
360, 461 P.2d at 225 (holding that mail -in absentee votes that were not 
postmarked by then -existing statutory deadline were not validly cast).  
 20 While an accurate recount could not have been conducted in this 
case in light of election officials’ inability to separate the comingl ed 
ballots, it is noted that there does not appear to be established procedures 
for conducting a recount in Hawai‘i’s  statutes or administrative rules.  Cf. 
Florida Admin. Code § 1S -2.031 (setting forth detailed recounting 
procedures). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 53 result without the inclusion of the 350 ballots cannot be 
ascertained. 
 
 31. Because the correct results of the November 6, 
2018 special election for the city councilmember seat for 
District IV cannot be determined, the special election must be 
invalidated.   See Akizaki, 51 Haw. at 360, 461 P.2d at 225 
(“Our judgment is . . . that the election was invalid for the 
reason that a correct result cannot be ascertained because of 
the mistake . . . on the part of the election officials in 
opening the late- post-marked envelopes and commingling those 
ballots with ballots validly cast.  Therefore . . . in order to 
protect the right of the people . . . to choose their 
representatives, we invalidate the election . . . .”); HRS § 11 -
174.5(b) (2009) (stating that this court is authorized to 21
                                                           
 21 In a previous case addressing a county clerk’s failure to allow 
the plaintiffs to view a minor change in the format of a ballot question made 
to assure the layout complied with a relevant county charter provision, this 
court stated that, “as a general rule , an election will not be invalidated 
for failure of the election officials to comply strictly with an election 
statute where there has been substantial compliance and there is no showing 
of fraud.”  Thirty Voters of Kauai Cty. v. Doi, 61 Haw. 179, 184, 599 P.2d 
286, 290 (1979).  In that case, we held the format change only modified the 
manner in which the voter would express approval or disapproval of the ballot 
question and could not “be deemed to have been substantive.”  Id.  By pointed 
contrast, this case involves the very question of whether the absentee votes 
were validly cast.  We hold that the counting of 350 mail -in absentee ballots 
that were not received by the C ity Clerk prior to the close of polls 
substantially complied with neither HRS § 15 -9(a)(1) nor HRS § 15 -9(d), which 
specifically provides that such ballots shall be marked “invalid” and 
disposed of in the manner prescribed by statute.  Cf.  Akizaki, 51 Haw. at 
360, 461 P.2d at 225.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 54 “invalidate the special . . . election on the grounds that a 
correct result cannot be ascertained”).  
  3 2. In light of the court’s decision, the court need 
not reach a decision on the merits of the election challengers’ 
remaining claims of mistake or fraud.  
JUDGMENT 
  Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and 
conclusions of law, the election complaints are granted in part 
in favor of Waters and the 39 voters and the motions to dismiss 
or, in the alternative, motions for summary judgment filed by 
Chief Election Officer Nago and the Office of Elections are 
denied.  Judgment is entered in favor of Waters and the 39 
voters as to Count I of their respective complaints and against 
Chief Election Officer Nago, the Office of Elections, and City 
Clerk Takahashi.  The second special election for councilmember 
for District IV, City and County of Honolulu is invalidated.  
Waters’s and the 39 voters’ complaints are denied in all other 
respects.
