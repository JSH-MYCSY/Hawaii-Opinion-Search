IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
ASHLEY (NOELLE) FAMERA-ROSENZWEIG, Plaintiff, 
vs. 
KAIALI# I (KAI) KAHELE, Defendant. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND JUDGMENT
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Wilson, JJ.,
and Circuit Judge Cataldo, assigned by reason of vacancy) 
Upon consideration of the August 11, 2020 election 
complaint filed by Plaintiff Ashley (Noelle) Famera-Rosenzweig, 
the September 25, 2020 motion to dismiss filed by Respondent Scott Nago, Chief Election Officer, and Plaintiff’s opposition to the motion to dismiss the complaint, and having heard this matter without oral argument, we set forth the following findings of fact and conclusions of law and enter the judgment in accordance with HRS § 11-173.5. 
FINDINGS OF FACT 
1.  Plaintiff Ashley (Noelle) Famera-Rosenzweig 
(Plaintiff) was one of four candidates in the democratic primary election for the office of U.S. Representative, District II in the August 8, 2020 primary election.    
   2.  According to the final primary election summary 
printout, the election results for the democratic primary 
election for U.S. Representative, District II were: 
Kahele, Kaiali# i (Kai)
Evans, Brian   
Lee, Brenda L. Machado Famera, Noelle Blank VotesOver Votes   100,841  (65.8%) 
    12,337  ( 8.1%)     10,694  ( 7.0%) 
7,992  ( 5.2%) 
    20,904  (13.6%)        381  ( 0.2%) 
3.  
Plaintiff contends Kahele’s voluntary assignment 
with the National Guard prior to the election was a tactical move 
on the part of Kahele and the Democratic Party to prevent all of the candidates from participating in appearances and debates with media networks.  Due to the failure to participate im media events, Plaintiff asks the court to: 
(a)  order the investigation of the Democratic Party    
     and Kahele; 
(b)  
strike Kahele’s name from the ballot; 
(c)  investigate Candidate Brenda Lee and strike her 
name from the ballot; and 
(d)  order a re-vote for the U.S. Representative,
District II democratic primary with only
candidates Famera-Rosenzweig and Brian Evans onthe ballot with the winner to move on to the November 2020 general election. 
4.  In the motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s election 
contest complaint, the Chief Election Officer contends the 
complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and the relevant election contest statutes limit the supreme court’s jurisdiction to deciding which candidate was nominated or elected, and thus, the court cannot grant the relief requested. 
2   CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
1.  HRS § 11-172 provides that a copy of the complaint 
for an election contest “shall be delivered to the chief election 
officer or the clerk in the case of county election ”  See Han v. Manahan, SCEC-12-0000716, 2012 WL 3667313, (Haw. Aug. 27, 2012) (concluding that in an election contest involving a county election, the City Clerk was a necessary and indispensable party who should have been named as a defendant and served with a copy of the complaint).   
2.  The democratic primary election for the office of 
the United States Representative, District II, is a state election administered by the State Office of Elections.  The Chief Election Officer, therefore, is a necessary and indispensable party who should have been named as a defendant. The record shows the attorney for the Chief Election Officer was served with a copy of the complaint, and this court issued an order directing the Chief Election Officer to appear in this matter to ensure the election contest is decided on the merits. 
3.  HRS § 11-172 provides in relevant part: 
The complaint shall set forth any cause or causes,
such as, but not limited to, provable fraud, overagesor  underages, that could cause a difference in theelection results. 
4.  A complaint challenging the results of an election 
pursuant to HRS § 11-172 fails to state a claim unless the 
plaintiff demonstrate errors that would change the outcome of the election.  Tataii v. Cronin, 119 Hawai# i 337, 339, 198 P.3d 124, 
3 126 (2008) (citing Akaka v. Yoshina, 84 Hawai# i 383, 387, 935 
P.2d 98, 102 (1997)).  See also Funakoshi v. King, 65 Haw. 312, 
317, 651 P.2d 912, 913 (1982) (Difference in the election results . . . mean[s] a difference sufficient to change the results of the election). 
5. 
[T]he [plaintiff] must show that he or she has
actual information of mistakes or errors 
sufficient to change the result.  The [plaintiff] has the burden of demonstrating thatthe specific acts and conduct of which [he orshe] complain[s] would have had the effect ofchanging the results.  In the absence of facts showing that irregularities exceed the reportedmargin between the candidates, the complaint islegally insufficient because, even if its truthwere assumed, the result of the election wouldnot be affected. 
. . . 
It is not sufficient that the [plaintiff] pointsto a poorly run and inadequately supervisedelection process that evinces room for abuse orpossibilities of fraud.  An election contest cannot be based upon mere belief or indefiniteinformation. 
Tataii, 119 Hawai# i at 339-40, 198 P.3d at 126-27 (citing Akana 
v. Yoshina, 84 Hawai# i at 387-388, 935 P.2d at 102-103 (internal 
quotation marks, brackets and citations omitted). 
6.  Upon considering a complaint contesting a primary 
election, a special primary election, or a county election, the 
supreme court, pursuant to HRS § 11-173.5, “shall give judgment fully stating all findings of fact and law” and “shall decide what candidate was nominated or elected.” 
7.  Unlike HRS § 11-174.5, which governs contests for 
general and special general elections and allows the court to 
4  invalidate an election, HRS § 11-173.5 does not provide for a 
judgment that would invalidate the primary election and allow a new election.  See Funakoshi v. King, 65 Haw. 312, 315, 651 P.2d at 912, 914. (the legislature only provided for the extraordinary remedy of invalidating an election and allowing a new election for general elections, special general elections, and special elections).  
8.  Taking Plaintiff’s allegations as true and viewing 
them in the light most favorable to her, it is evident she has presented no set of facts that would entitle her to the requested relief.  She does not present specific acts or actual information of mistake or error sufficient to change the election results. Even if her claims regarding Kahele’s failure to participate in media campaigns and debates are true, that alone is insufficient to change the results of the election.  See Tataii v. Cronin, 119 Hawai# i at 340, 198 P.3d at 127 (where the plaintiff makes no 
showing that the defendant was under any obligation to debate plaintiff, the refusal to debate was not an error, mistake or irregularity that would change the result of the election). 
9.  The remedies sought by Plaintiff -- strike Kahele’s 
name from the ballot; investigate Kahele and the democratic party; nullify the votes for candidate Brenda Lee; and a re-vote between Famera-Rosenzweig and Brian Evans -- are not authorized by HRS § 11-173.5(b) 
10.  The Chief Election Officer’s motion to dismiss is 
granted.      
5 JUDGMENT 
Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and 
conclusions of law, the judgment is entered dismissing the 
complaint.  Kaiali# i (Kai) Kahele is the candidate who received 
the highest number of votes in the democratic primary election for U.S. Representative, District II, and his name shall be placed on the ballot as the democratic candidate in the November 2020 general election.    
The clerk of the supreme court shall forthwith serve a 
certified copy of this judgment on the chief election officer in accordance with HRS § 11-173.5(b).
