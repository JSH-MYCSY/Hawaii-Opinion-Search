ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER DISMISSING COMPLAINT
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna and Wilson, JJ.,
and Circuit Judge Kawamura, assigned by reason by vacancy)
Upon consideration of Plaintiffs’ “Complaint” filed onElectronically Filed
Supreme Court
SCEC-20-0000525
03-SEP-2020
02:16 PMAugust 24, 2020; Defendant Chief Election Officer Scott T. Nago’s
motion to dismiss filed on August 28, 2020; Defendant Benjamin K.
Lindsey’s answer, filed on August 31, 2020, the respective
supporting documents, and the record, it appears that: (1)
Plaintiffs are challenging the residency of Defendant Lindsey and
his eligibility to run for the position of Trustee, Office of
Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) from the island of Hawai# i, and asking
this court to find that Defendant Benjamin K. Lindsey does not
satisfy the requirements to be a candidate for the Hawai# i Island
OHA seat; (2) a challenge to a candidate’s residency is governed
by HRS § 11-13, which provides in relevant part “[i]n case of
question, final determination of residence shall be made by the
clerk, subject to appeal to the board of registration under part
III of this chapter”; and (3) this court therefore lacks
jurisdiction to consider this election contest complaint. 
Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion to dismiss is
granted, and the complaint is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 
 DATED: Honolulu, 
Hawai#i, September 3, 2020.
