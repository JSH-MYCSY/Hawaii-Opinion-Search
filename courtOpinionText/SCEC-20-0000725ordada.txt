ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND JUDGMENT
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Wilson, JJ.,
and Circuit Judge Ayabe, assigned by reason of vacancy) 
Upon consideration of (1) the election complaint, filed 
by plaintiff Keoni Souza (“Souza”) on November 23, 2020, (2) the 
motion to dismiss complaint, filed by defendants David Y. Ige, in 
his official capacity as Governor of the State of Hawai# i, Chief 
Election Officer Scott Nago (“Chief Election Officer Nago”), and the State of 
Hawai# i Office of Elections (collectively, “the 
State Defendants”) on December 3, 2020, and Souza’s memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss, (3) the joinders filed by FINDINGS OF FACT 
  the County Clerks of each County (collectively, “the County 
Defendants”); (4) the respective supporting documents, and 
(5) the record in this matter, we set forth the following 
findings of fact and conclusions of law and enter judgment in 
accordance with HRS § 11-174.5(b). 
1. Souza was a candidate in the Office of Hawaiian 
Affairs (“OHA”) At-Large Trustee election in the November 3, 2020 General Election. 
2. The Summary Report printed on November 19, 2020 at 
10:21
 a.m. reported the results of the OHA At-Large Trustee 
election as follows: 
AKINA, Keli #i
SOUZA, Keoni 
Blank Votes: 
Over Votes: 197,829 
196,206 185,571 
 178 34.1% 
33.8% 32.0% 
0.0% 
3. Keli# i Akina (“Akina”) received the highest number 
of votes. 
4. The difference in the votes between Akina and 
Souza was 1,623 votes. 
5. On November 23, 2020, Souza timely filed a 
complaint challenging the results of the OHA At-Large Trustee 
election. 
6. Souza asserts five counts for relief, alleging 
that Act 135, as codified at HRS § 11-158, is arbitrary, that a 
recount is warranted by the fact that the number of blank votes 
exceeds the margin of victory in the OHA At-Large Trustee 
election, that the high number of blank votes resulted from a 
failure to educate the public regarding voter registration and 
2 information, and that a separate ballot for OHA elections was not 
provided. 
7. Souza asks this court to provide the following 
relief: 
(A) “[O]rder a hand recount to determine if he 
can overcome the margin of error of the voting machine(s) and to 
decipher voter intent in each blank ballot, overvote, and 
undervote;” 
(B) “[O]rder Scott Nago, Chief Elections Officer, 
to submit a reply to Candidate Souza’s inquiry letter so we have 
adequate information to understand how the voting process and 
voting machines could have affected the vote count for the OHA 
Trustee At-Large contest;” or, in the alternative, 
(C) “[I]nvalidate the OHA Trustee At-Large 
election results and hold a special election for the OHA Trustee 
At-Large seat if this Court deems the aforementioned errors too 
grave to overcome.” 
8. The State Defendants moved to dismiss the 
complaint on the ground that the complaint is not a typical 
election contest that falls within this court’s original 
jurisdiction to determine the results of an election and fails to 
state a claim upon which relief may be granted inasmuch as Souza 
has not demonstrated how any of his assertions would change the 
election results, and he cannot prove any set of facts that would 
entitle him to relief. 
9. Attached to the motion to dismiss are declarations 
from Chief Election Officer Nago and Kristen Uyeda, the Ballot 
Operations Election Section Head for the Office of Elections. 
3 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  10. The County Defendants filed joinders to the motion 
to dismiss. 
1. An election contest is instituted by filing a 
complaint in the supreme court “set[ting] forth any cause or 
causes, such as but not limited to, provable fraud, overages, or 
underages, that could cause a difference in the election 
results.” 
HRS § 11-172. 
2. “A complaint challenging the results of [a 
general] election pursuant to HRS § 11-172 fails to state a claim 
unless the plaintiff[] demonstrate[s] errors, mistakes or 
irregularities that would change the outcome of the election” –-
e.g., errors, mistakes, or irregularities that would change the 
outcome of the election. Tataii v. Cronin, 119 Hawai# i 337, 339, 
198 P.3d 124, 126 (2008) (citing Akaka v. Yoshina, 84 Hawai# i 
383, 387, 935 P.2d 98, 102 (1997)). See also Funakoshi v. King, 
65 Haw. 312, 317, 651 P.2d 912, 915 (1982) (“‘Difference in the election results’ . . . mean[s] a difference sufficient to 
overturn the nomination of any particular candidate[.]”). 
3. In order for a complaint to be legally sufficient, 
it must “show[] that the specific acts and conduct . . . 
complained of would have had the effect of changing the results 
of the . . . election.” Elkins v. Ariyoshi, 56 Hawai# i 47, 49, 
527 P.2d 236, 237 (1974); Akaka, 84 Hawai# i at 388, 935 P.2d at 
103 (in order for an election challenge to have merit, “the 
petitioner must ‘show that he [or she] ha[s] actual information 
of mistakes or errors sufficient to change the result[;]’” an 
election contest cannot be based upon mere belief or indefinite 
information). 
It is not sufficient that a plaintiff point to a 
4 “poorly run and inadequately supervised election process” that 
evinces “‘room for abuse’” or “‘possibilities of fraud.’” 
Elkins, 56 Haw. At 48, 527 P.2d at 237. 
4. “In the absence of facts showing that 
irregularities exceed the reported margin between the candidates, 
the complaint is legally insufficient because, even if its truth 
were assumed, the result of the election would not be affected.” 
Tataii, 119 Hawai# i at 339-40, 198 P.3d at 126-27. 
5. “An election contest cannot be based upon mere 
belief or indefinite information.” Id.
6. When reviewing a motion to dismiss a complaint for 
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the 
court must accept the plaintiff’s allegations as true and view 
them in the light most favorable to him or her; dismissal is 
proper only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can 
prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that would 
entitle him or her to relief. AFL Hotel & Restaurant Workers 
Health & Welfare Trust Fund v. Bosque, 110 Hawai# i 318, 321, 132 
P.3d 1229, 1232 (2006). 
7. Conclusory allegations and unwarranted inferences 
are not sufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss. Kealoha v. 
Machado, 131 Hawai# i 62, 74, 315 P.3d 213, 225 (2013). 
8. Souza does not provide “specific facts” or “actual 
information” of mistakes, errors, or irregularities sufficient to change the result of the OHA At-Large Trustee election or exceed 
the reported margin of votes between himself and Akina. Souza 
impliedly concedes that he does not have “specific facts” or 
“actual information” by acknowledging that a hand recount would 
allow for the determination as to whether “he can overcome the 
margin of error of the voting machine(s)” and that information 
5 from Chief Election Officer Nago regarding the voting process and 
voting machines “could have affected the vote count for the OHA 
Trustee At-Large contest.” In his declaration, Chief Election 
Officer Nago detailed the voting machines and voting systems that 
were used in the 2020 election, the procedures for counting the 
ballots, and the overages and underages. None of this 
information demonstrate that the voting systems were not accurate 
or reliable, or that they did not work properly in counting the 
votes on election day such as to demonstrate mistakes, errors, or 
irregularities sufficient to change the result of the OHA At-
Large Trustee election or exceed the reported margin of votes. 
Souza has not presented specific evidence to dispute this 
conclusion such that it would change the election result. 
9. Additionally, assertions that the large amount of 
blank votes suggest that Chief Election Officer Nago did not 
fulfill his statutory responsibilities for public education or 
that the OHA At-Large Trustee race was required to be on a 
separate ballot do not constitute “actual information” that, even 
taken as true, the election results for the OHA At-Large Trustee 
election would change. See Brown v. Iaukea, 18 Haw. 131, 133 
(1906) (sufficient evidence requires something more than a “mere fishing expedition undertaken in the hope that in an examination 
of all the ballots enough might be discovered to change the 
result”); Akaka, 84 Hawai# i at 388, 935 P.2d at 103 (an election 
challenge cannot be based on “mere belief or indefinite information”). See generally Kealoha, 131 Hawai# i at 74, 315 
P.3d at 225 (conclusory allegations and unwarranted inferences are not sufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss). 
6 JUDGMENT 10. Souza also fails to demonstrate beyond a 
reasonable doubt that Act 135 (as codified under HRS § 11-158) is 
arbitrary or flawed such that the results of the OHA At-Large 
Trustee election would be different. See Gaylord, 78 Hawai# i at 
137, 890 P.2d at 1177 (“[E]very enactment of the legislature is presumptively constitutional, and a party challenging the statute 
has the burden of showing unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable 
doubt.”). 
Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and 
conclusions of law, judgment is entered granting the motion to dismiss and dismissing the complaint.
