ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
ORDER DISMISSING COMPLAINT IN PART 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.)  
 
  On November 4, 2022, Plaintiffs filed an election complaint that appears to seek relief under the primary election 
contest statute, HRS § 11-173.5.  It is beyond the allowable 
time to seek relief under HRS § 11-173.5.  See HRS § 11-173.5(a) 
(“In a primary . . . election contest, . . . the complaint shall 
be filed in the office of the clerk of the supreme court no 
later than 4:30 p.m. on the thirteenth day after a primary . . . 
election[.]”).  To the extent Plaintiffs’ arguments seek relief under HRS § 11-173.5, these claims are untimely.  Accordingly,  Electronically Filed

It is ordered that the complaint is dismissed in part, 
or to the extent relief is sought under HRS § 11-173.5.  The 
court will instead construe the complaint as a general election 
contest.
