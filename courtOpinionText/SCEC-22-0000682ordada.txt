ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, AND JUDGMENT 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
 
  Upon consideration of the election complaint filed on November 4, 2022, the motion to dismiss filed on November 9, 
2022, and the record, we enter the following findings of fact, 
conclusions of law, and judgment dismissing the complaint. 
FINDINGS OF FACT 
1. The 2022 primary election was held on August 13, 
2022.   Electronically Filed
Supreme Court
SCEC-22-0000682
23-DEC-2022
11:26 AM
Dkt. 16 FFCL2 
 2. 
Plaintiff Karl O. Dicks (Dicks) was an 
unsuccessful Republican candidate for the office of State 
Senator, District 17. 
3. Plaintiff James Ryan Malish (Malish) was the only 
nonpartisan candidate in the primary election for the office of 
State Senator, District 9.   
4. Stanley Chang (Chang) and Michael L. Parrish 
(Parrish) were the only Democrat and Republican candidates, respectively, in the primary election for the office of State 
Senator, District 9. 
5. There were no other candidates in the primary 
election for the office of State Senator, District 9. 
6. There were a total 13,766 votes cast for the 
State Senator, District 9, primary election race, the results of 
which were: 
  Chang 
Parrish Malish       11,550  2,183     33    
 
7. 
Both Chang and Parrish were on the 2022 general 
election ballot, but Malish was not. 
8. Defendant Chief Election Officer Scott Nago 
(Nago) states Malish did not qualify to be a candidate for the 
2022 general election because Malish did not receive at least 
ten per cent of the total votes cast in the primary election for 
the office of State Senator, District 9, or 1,377 votes.  3 
 9. 
Nago also states Malish did not receive an amount 
of votes equal to the lowest amount of votes received by a 
partisan candidate who was nominated in the primary election for 
the same office.  
10. On November 4, 2022, or four days before the 
November 8 general election, Malish and Dicks (collectively, 
Plaintiffs), pro se, filed an election complaint asserting that 
the primary election ballot violates article II, section 4 of 
the Hawaiʻ i Constitution and Hawaiʻ i  Revised Statutes (HRS) § 12-
31 (2009) because the ballot requires selection of a political 
preference, and the manner in which the primary election ballot 
displays a nonpartisan candidate could also be construed to require declaration of a political preference when selecting a 
nonpartisan ballot.  Plaintiffs assert that the manner that 
nonpartisan candidates are displayed on the primary election 
ballot, which includes the designation (N), gives the appearance 
that nonpartisan candidates are a part of a political party 
because Democrat and Republican candidates are visually grouped 
together similarly as nonpartisan candidates and are designated as (D) and (R), respectively. 
11. Plaintiffs also assert that Malish should have 
been included in the 2022 general election ballot because he was 
unopposed as a nonpartisan candidate.  Because Malish was 
excluded from the general election ballot for the State Senator, 4 
 District 9 race, but Chang and Parrish were included, Plaintiffs 
assert that HRS § 12-41(b) (2009) should not apply and is 
otherwise discriminatory.  In support, Plaintiffs assert that 
HRS § 12-41(b) should be read in conjunction with HRS § 12-42(b) 
(2009) to discern the “spirit of statute” such that unopposed 
candidates in a primary election should all move forward to the 
general election, including nonpartisan candidates.   
12. 
Dicks contends he has an interest in this 
election contest because of his candidacy in the Republican primary election for the office of State Senator, District 17, 
and asserts that the primary election ballot is 
unconstitutional.  
13. Plaintiffs request that this court order a 
special election to be held with a constitutionally compliant 
ballot, without discrimination of any kind, and include all 
qualified candidates on the 2022 primary election ballot.  
Plaintiffs cite to Waters v. Nago, 148 Hawaiʻ i 46, 468 P.3d 60 
(2019), as support for the relief they seek.   
14. Plaintiffs also request a “Declaratory Judgment 
of Facts” pursuant to Hawaiʻ i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
Rule 57, judicial notice of adjudicative facts pursuant to 
Hawai
ʻi Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 201, questions for admission 
to be answered pursuant to HRCP Rule 36, and oral argument pursuant to Hawaiʻ i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 36(c). 5 
 15. 
In connection with their request for a 
declaratory judgment, Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the 
voting instructions on the 2022 primary election ballot violate 
article II, section 4 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution and HRS § 12-31 
(2009).  The disputed instruction says: “You MUST select ONE 
political preference from the box above for your votes to 
count.”   
16. On November 9, 2022, Defendants Nago, State of 
Hawaiʻi Office of Elections, and the Elections Commission 
(collectively, Defendants) filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, asserting:  (1) This court lacks jurisdiction over 
Plaintiffs’ primary election contest; (2) Dicks lacks standing 
to contest the results of Malish’s primary election; (3) the 
assertion that the primary election ballot design is unconstitutional should be dismissed; and (4) Malish was 
properly omitted from the 2022 general election ballot. 
17. 
Defendants assert that HRS § 11-172 (Supp. 2021) 
confers standing upon a candidate to timely contest the 
candidate’s own race - HRS § 11-172 does not confer standing on 
a candidate to contest all concurrent and future federal, State, 
and county races. 
18. On November 14, 2022, this court filed an order 
dismissing the election complaint in part, or to the extent that relief is sought under HRS § 11-173.5 (2009 & Supp. 2021).  The 6 
 order said that this court will instead construe the complaint 
as a general election contest. 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
1. An election contest is instituted by filing a 
complaint in the supreme court “set[ting] forth any cause or causes, such as but not limited to, provable fraud, overages, or 
underages, that could cause a difference in the election 
results.”  HRS § 11-172. 
  2. “With respect to any election, any candidate, or 
qualified political party directly interested, or any thirty 
voters of any election district,  may file a complaint in the 
supreme court.”  HRS § 11-172. 
  3. In Hawaiʻ i state courts, “standing is solely an 
issue of justiciability, arising out of prudential concerns of 
judicial self-governance[,]” and not an issue of subject matter 
jurisdiction.  Tax Found. of 
Hawaiʻi v. State, 144 Hawaiʻi 175, 
190-92, 439 P.3d 127, 142-44 (2019). 
 Our guideposts for the application of the rules 
of judicial self-governance founded in concern about 
the proper — and properly limited — role of courts in 
a democratic society reflect the precepts enunciated 
by the Supreme Court. . . .  [W]hen asked to decide 
whether a litigant is asserting legally recognized 
interests, personal and peculiar to him, we have 
spoken of standing[.] 
 
Id. at 190-91, 439 P.3d at 142-43 (quoting Trs. of Off. of 
Hawaiian Affairs v. Yamasaki, 69 Haw. 154, 171, 737 P.2d 446, 
456 (1987)) (emphases omitted). 7 
  
 4. In Thirty Voters of Kauai County v. Doi, this 
court held that “the electorate as a whole has sufficient 
interest in the outcome of these proceedings to confer standing 
upon it as a party plaintiff.”  61 Haw. 179, 181, 599 P.2d 286, 
288 (1979).  The plaintiffs in Doi sought to set aside the 
results of a specific question posed to voters in the ballot of the November 7, 1978 election.  Id. at 179-84, 599 P.2d at 287-
90.  The plaintiffs did not seek to set aside the results of an 
entire election.  See id. 
  5. In this election contest, Dicks does not have standing to contest Malish’s absence from the general election 
ballot.  See Doi, 61 Haw. at 181, 599 P.2d at 288. 
6. Dicks and Malish do not have standing to contest 
the results of all election races in the 2022 general election 
in order for a special election to be held.  See Doi, 61 Haw. at 
181, 599 P.2d at 288.   
7. We instead read the election complaint as 
requesting a special election be held with a satisfactory ballot 
and in connection with the office that Malish sought in the 2022 
primary election.  
8. In a general election contest, this court’s 
“judgment may invalidate the general . . . election on the 
grounds that a correct result cannot be ascertained because of a 
mistake or fraud on the part of the voter service center 8 
 officials; or decide that a certain candidate, or certain 
candidates, received a majority or plurality of votes cast and 
were elected.”  HRS § 11-174.5(b) (2009 & Supp. 2021). 
 
9. “A complaint challenging the results of [a 
general] election pursuant to HRS § 11-172 fails to state a 
claim unless the plaintiffs demonstrate errors that would change 
the outcome of the election” -- e.g., errors, mistakes, or 
irregularities that would change the outcome of the election.  
Tataii v. Cronin, 119 Hawaiʻ i 337, 339, 198 P.3d 124, 126 (2008) 
(brackets in original) (quoting Akaka v. Yoshina, 84 Hawaiʻ i 383, 
387, 935 P.2d 98, 102 (1997)). 
[T]he [plaintiff] must show that he or she has 
actual information of mistakes or errors sufficient 
to change the result.  The [plaintiff] has the burden 
of demonstrating that the specific acts and conduct 
of which [he or she] complain[s] would have had the 
effect of changing the results.  In the absence of 
facts showing that irregularities exceed the reported 
margin between the candidates, the complaint is 
legally insufficient because, even if its truth were 
assumed, the result of the election would not be 
affected. 
 
 . . . . 
 
It is not sufficient that the [plaintiff] 
points to a poorly run and inadequately supervised 
election process that evinces room for abuse or 
possibilities of fraud.  An election contest cannot 
be based upon mere belief or indefinite information. 
 
Tataii, 119 Hawaiʻ i at 339-40, 198 P.3d at 126-27 (quoting Akaka, 
84 Hawaiʻ i at 387-88, 935 P.2d at 102-03). 
10. In Waters, this court invalidated the results of 
a City and County of Honolulu second special election between 9 
 Thomas Waters and Trevor Ozawa for the District IV city 
councilmember seat.  Pursuant to HRS § 11-174.5(b), this court 
found and concluded there were 350 absentee ballots that were 
“invalidly received” and “potentially altered the election 
results” for this seat because “the difference in the number of 
votes between Waters and Ozawa was 22 votes,” and the City Clerk 
had counted 350 ballots for Council District IV that were 
received by the City Clerk after the 6:00 p.m. deadline 
 Waters, 148
  at 65-66, 468 P.3d at 79-80.  Because a 
recount excluding the invalid 350 votes was not possible, this court held that “a correct result without the inclusion of the 350 ballots cannot be ascertained” and, thus, the second special
election for this seat “must be invalidated.”  Id. at 65, 468 
P.3d at 79; see HRS § 11-174.5(b). Hawaiʻiestablished by the then-existing version of HRS § 15-9(a).
1  
11. Before reaching this result, this court said:   
6.  In Count I of his complaint, Waters alleges 
that the absentee ballots in the District IV election 
counted between the fourth printout and the fifth 
printout were miscounted because they were not 
delivered to the State Capitol for counting before 
the polls closed on election day.  Waters claims that 
as many as 1,286[] absentee return envelopes were not 
received by the City Clerk or the Office of Elections 
by the close of the polls at 6:00 p.m. on November 6, 
2018.  Waters contends that the counting of these 
ballots violates HRS § 15- 9(a), and they therefore 
cannot be considered. 
 
1  HRS § 15- 9 has since been amended, but at the time was 
interpreted by this court to require all absentee mail- in return envelopes to 
be “received by the City Clerk or an authorized representative by 6:00 p.m. 
on election day.”  Waters, 148 Hawaiʻi at 62, 468 P.3d at 76. 
 10 7.The 39 voters allege in Count I of their
complaint that the City Clerk “miscounted, 
misapplied, and mishandled” the ballots included in 
the fifth printout by “failing to follow requirements 
set forth within the governing statutes and 
administrative rules.”  In subsequent filings, the 
voters clarified their argument, contending that the 
City Clerk had violated HRS § 15- 9(a) by collecting 
mail-in absentee return envelopes after the closing 
of the polls. 
8.Because Waters and the 39 voters allege a
particular error that would invalidate a number of 
votes greater than the 22- vote margin by which the 
election was decided, they have alleged a specific 
mistake “sufficient to change the result,” as is 
required to state a claim for relief under our 
precedents.[]  Akaka, 84 Hawai ʻi at 388, 935 P.2d at 
103 (quoting Funakoshi, 65 Haw. at 316– 17, 651 P.2d 
at 915). 
Waters, 148 Hawaiʻ i at 60-61, 468 P.3d at 74-75. 
12. When reviewing a motion to dismiss a complaint,
the court must accept the plaintiff’s allegations as true and 
view them in a light most favorable to the plaintiff.  Bank of 
Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 143 Hawaiʻ i 249, 257, 428 P.3d 761, 
769 (2018).  Dismissal is proper only if it appears beyond doubt 
that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of their 
claim that would entitle them to relief.  Id. 
13. Conclusory assertions concerning the legal
effects of the events alleged will not be accepted.  Reyes-
Toledo, 143 Hawaiʻ i at 262, 428 P.3d at 774. 
14. Malish has not alleged specific facts, or actual
information of mistakes or errors, sufficient to change the result of the 2022 general election for the State Senator, 11 15.Nor does Malish assert that a certain candidate 
received a majority of the votes cast in the 2022 general 
election for the State Senator, District 9 office, and was 
elected.  See HRS § 11-174.5(b). 
16. Accordingly, it appears beyond doubt that Malish
can prove no set of facts in support of Malish’s claim that 
would entitle Malish to relief.  See Reyes-Toledo, 143 Hawaiʻ i at 
257, 428 P.3d at 769. 
17. In addition to Malish’s assertion, the election
complaint asserts that the 2022 primary election ballot is 
unconstitutional and violates HRS § 12-31 because the 
instructions on the 2022 primary election ballot states that the 
voter must select a political preference for the vote to count.  
Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment pursuant to HRCP Rule 57, District 9 office.  See Waters, 148 Hawaiʻi at 60-61, 468 P.3d at 
74-75.  In other words, even if Malish’s assertion that his name 
should have been on the 2022 general election ballot are taken as true 
and viewed in a light most favorable to Malish, Malish has not alleged 
a specific error “sufficient to change the result” of the 2022 general 
election for the office of State Senator, District 9.  See id.; 
Tataii, 119 Hawaiʻi at 340, 198 P.3d at 127 (“An election contest 
cannot be based upon mere belief or indefinite information.”  (Quoting 
Akaka, 84 Hawaiʻi at  387-88, 935 P.2d at 102-03)).12 
 and also cite to HRS § 602-5 (2016) as providing this court with 
jurisdiction “to rule on these matters of statutes, laws, 
constitutionality and compliance with thereof.” 
18. 
In Lewis v. Cayetano, 72 Haw. 499, 502, 823 P.2d 
738, 740 (1992), which concerned two unsuccessful County of 
Kauaʻi proposals, the plaintiffs asserted, among other things, 
that the County Clerk erred by including the overvotes in 
tallying the total number of votes cast on the question.  This 
court held that, even though the doctrine of laches did not bar 
this issue, we “nevertheless decline[d] to determine the merits 
of the issue” because “[e]ven if we accept plaintiffs’ 
contention, the election results would not have changed” and the plaintiffs “would not be entitled to relief.”  Id. at 503, 823 
P.2d at 741.   
19. Similarly, here, even if we were to accept 
Plaintiffs’ contention, Plaintiffs have not shown how the 2022 general election results would change nor the relief that 
Plaintiffs would be entitled to.  See Lewis, 72 Haw. at 503, 823 
P.2d at 741; see also Tataii, 119 Hawaiʻ i at 340, 198 P.3d at 127 
(“An election contest cannot be based upon mere belief or 
indefinite information.”  (Quoting Akaka, 84 Hawaiʻ i at 387-88, 
935 P.2d at 102-03)). 
20. Plaintiffs’ motion for a declaratory judgment 
addressing the constitutionality and validity of the voting 13    /s/ Sabrina S. McKenna 
/s/ Michael D. Wilson 
/s/ Todd W. Eddins      
 
 /s/ Mark E. Recktenwald  
   /s/ Paula A. Nakayama     instructions printed on the 2022 primary election ballot is thus 
denied because the motion does not state a claim on which relief 
can be granted in an election contest.  See Lewis, 72 Haw. at 
503, 823 P.2d at 741. 
21. Because we are dismissing the election complaint 
for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted, we 
deny Plaintiffs’ requests for oral argument, judicial notice of 
adjudicative facts, and questions for admission to be answered.  
JUDGMENT 
  Based on the above findings of fact and conclusions of law, judgment is entered granting the motion to dismiss and 
dismissing the complaint. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai i, December 23, 2022.
