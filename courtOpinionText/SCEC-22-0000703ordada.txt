 Election Officer, Office of Elections, State of .   
 
 November 28, 2022, Defendant Scott T. Nago in his official 
capacity as the Chief Election Officer for the Office of 
Elections, State of Hawaiʻ i (Office of Elections) filed a motion 
to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim or, in the
alternative, for summary judgment.  Subsequently, Plaintiffs and
the Office of Elections filed further briefing and documents on the motion. On Hawaiʻi
 Upon consideration of the complaint and the documents attached, the motion to dismiss, and having heard this matter without oral argument, we enter the following findings of fact, conclusions of law, and enter judgment dismissing the complaint. 
FINDINGS OF FACT 
1. Plaintiffs are over thirty voters who reside in the 
representative district number 17 on the island of Kauaʻ i. 
2. On November 22, 2022, Plaintiffs timely filed a 
complaint challenging the statewide elections results based on purported deficiencies in the audit practices of the Office of Elections. 
3. The relief requested by the complaint is two-fold.  
First, Plaintiffs request a declaratory judgment that interprets 
HRS § 16-42 (2009).  Second, in the alternative, Plaintiffs 
request the court invalidate the general election on the grounds that a correct result cannot be ascertained because of a mistake or fraud on the part of the precinct officials.  3 4. The complaint is devoid of any specific allegations as
to how the audit procedure advocated by Plaintiffs would make 
any difference in the outcome of the election. 
5. In addition to the claims outlined above, the
complaint includes a claim for declaratory judgment against Defendant Scott T. Nago in his personal capacity.   
6. On November 22, 2022, the return of service was filed
to establish proof of service of the complaint and summons on “Scott T. Nago, in his official capacity only.”  To date, the Plaintiffs have not filed any return of service as to Defendant Scott Nago in his personal capacity. 
7. The Office of Elections moved to dismiss the complaint
for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, in pertinent part, because the complaint lacks any specific allegations of errors, mistakes, or fraud that would change the outcome of the election result.   
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
1. Pursuant to Hawaiʻ i Rules of Evidence Rule 202(b)
(2016), the request for judicial notice of the Hawaiʻ i laws cited 
in the complaint is granted. 
2. The issuance of a declaratory judgment on the
interpretation of HRS § 16-42 is not within the original jurisdiction of the supreme court.  See HRS § 602-5 (2016).  
Therefore, this court is without original jurisdiction to consider the Plaintiffs’ claim for declaratory judgment. 4 3.An election contest is instituted by filing a complaint in the supreme
court setting forth “any cause or causes, such as  but not limited to,
provable fraud, overages, or underages, that could  cause a difference in
the election results.” HRS § 11-172 (Supp. 2021). “The complaint shall also
set forth any reason for reversing, correcting, or changing the decisions
of the voter service center officials or the officials at the counting
center in an election using the electronic  voting system.” Id.
4. This court has held that a complaint challenging the results of an
election pursuant to HRS § 11-172 fails to state a claim unless: (1) the
plaintiffs demonstrate errors that would change the outcome of the election
Tataii v. Cronin, 119 Hawaiʻi 337, 339, 198 P.3d 124, 126 (2008) (citing
Akaka v. Yoshina, 84 Hawaiʻi 383, 387, 935 P.2d 98, 102 (1997)), or (2) the
plaintiffs demonstrate that the correct result cannot be ascertained
because of a mistake or fraud on the part of the precinct officials. Akaka,
84 Hawaiʻi at 387, 935 P.2d at 102; see HRS § 11-174.5(b) (2009 & Supp.
2021)., 
5. “[A] complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim
unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of
facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.”
Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo, 143 Hawaiʻi 249, 258, 428 P.3d 761, 770
(2018)(citation omitted).
6. “Our review is strictly limited to the allegations of the complaint,
which we view in the light most favorable to the5 plaintiff and deem to be true.” Civ. Beat L. Ctr. for the Pub. 
Int., Inc. v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 144 Hawaiʻi 466, 474, 445 P.3d 47, 55 
(2019) (citation and internal quotations omitted). However, “the court is not 
required to accept conclusory allegations on the legal effect of the events 
alleged.” Id.(citation omitted).
7. Here, the complaint fails to allege any specific facts that the audit
procedures requested would change the outcome of the election. And,
Plaintiffs’ belief and indefinite assertions that the requested audit could
change the outcome of all statewide elections, by itself, is insufficient to
state a claim under HRS §§ 11-172 and 11-174.5(b). See Hawaiʻi Rules of
Civil Procedure Rule 9(b) (2000) (“In all averments of fraud or
mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall
be stated with particularity.”).
8. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claim that the general
election results statewide should be invalidated fails to state
a claim upon which relief can be granted. See Tataii, 119
Hawaiʻi at 339-40, 198 P.3d at 126-27 (“In the absence of facts
showing that irregularities exceed the reported margin between
the candidates, the complaint is legally insufficient because,
even if its truth were assumed, the result of the election would
not be affected.”).6 JUDGMENT 
Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and conclusions 
of law, judgment is entered granting the motion to dismiss and 
dismissing the complaint as to all claims and parties.
