ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND JUDGMENT  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Eddins, JJ.,
and Wilson, J., dissenting)  
Upon consideration of the “Complaint for Election Contest” 
filed by the Plaintiffs on November 25, 2022 (complaint), the 
parties’ submissions, and oral argument, we conclude that the Electronically Filed
Supreme Court
SCEC-22-0000707

Dkt. 81 FFCL2 
 Plaintiffs failed to establish a viable election challenge that 
would “cause a difference in the election results.”  See Hawaiʻ i 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 11-172 (Supp. 2021).  In accordance 
with HRS § 11-174.5 (Supp. 2021) we enter the following findings 
of fact, conclusions of law and judgment. 
FINDINGS OF FACT 
1. As of 2020 the elections in the State of Hawaiʻ i have 
been conducted primarily by mail, but in-person voting is still available at voter service centers.  See HRS §§ 11-101 (Supp. 
2021), 11-109 (Supp. 2021). 
2. On November 8, 2022, the County of Maui held a 
nonpartisan general election for the seat of the Wailuku-Waiheʻ e-
Waikapū councilmember (subject election contest).  The two 
candidates were Defendant Alice L. Lee and Plaintiff Noelani 
Ahia (also known as J. Noelani Ahia). 
3.
 For the subject election contest, Defendant Scott T. 
Nago, Chief Election Officer for the Office of Elections, State 
of  (Chief Election Officer) was responsible for the 
printing and counting of ballots.  See HRS § 11-110(b)(1)(B) 
(Supp. 2021).  Defendant Kathy L. Kaohu, in her official capacity as the County Clerk of Maui County (Clerk) was 
responsible for voter registration, mailing ballots, voter 
service centers, receipt of ballots, and reviewing the return 
identification envelope received from the voter to confirm it Hawaiʻi3 
 was signed.  HRS § 11-110(b)(1)(A); see HRS §§ 11-106, 11-108 
(Supp. 2021). 
4. HRS § 11-102 (Supp. 2021) sets forth the procedures 
for conducting elections by mail.  Under this process, on or 
about Friday, October 21, 2022, the Clerk began mailing out the 
ballot packages to the registered voters.  See HRS § 11-102(b).  
The ballot package to a voter includes: (1) An official ballot; 
(2) A return identification envelope with postage prepaid; (3) A secrecy envelope or secrecy sleeve; and (4) Instructions.  HRS 
§ 11-102(a). 
5. The Clerk from Saturday, October 22, 2022 until 
Wednesday, November 9, 2022 at approximately 5:30 a.m. (Dkt. 
49:4, ¶ 16) reviewed all of the return identification envelopes 
submitted by the voters, and the number of return identification 
envelopes reviewed each day follows:

See also HRS § 11-108(a) (establishing the earliest date ballot 
processing for tabulation may begin).  With respect to the 
15,516 return identification envelopes that were reviewed by the Clerk on Tuesday, November 8, 2022, some of these were reviewed 
into the early morning on November 9, 2022.  The Clerk completed 
the review of return identification envelopes by approximately 
5:30 a.m. on Wednesday, November 9, 2022.  See HRS § 11-108(b).
  
6. From all of the return identification envelopes 
received from voters, the Clerk determined 865 were deficient 
based on one of the grounds set forth in HRS § 11-106, including 
an unsigned affirmation, an affirmation signature that did not 
match a reference signature image, or another condition such as a tampered ballot.  For all 865 of these voters, the Clerk 
mailed a notice to each voter that informed the voter of the 
deficiency and provided information on how to cure the 
deficiency (“notice-to-cure”).  See HRS §§ 11-106, 11-108. 
7. The Clerk mailed the notice-to-cure to the 865 voters 
with deficient return identification envelopes as follows: 
October 26, 2022: 
October 27, 2022: 
October 28, 2022: 
October 31, 2022: November 1, 2022: November 3, 2022: 
November 4, 2022: 
November 5, 2022: 64 notices 67 notices 
32 notices 
60 notices 10 notices 149 notices

37 notices 5 
 November 7, 2022: 
November 8, 2022: 
November 10, 2022: 
November 12, 2022: 55 notices 89 notices 
27 notices 
215 notices 
 Total:   865 
 
8. Ultimately, of these 865 voters with deficient return 
identification envelopes 159 of the voters timely responded to 
the notice-to-cure and corrected the deficiency.  At the end of 
the review period on November 16, 2022 there remained 706 
uncured and deficient return identification envelopes.  For 
these 706 ballots, the Clerk was not able to establish their 
validity and, thus, none of them were counted.  See HRS § 11-
108(c). 
9. The crux of Plaintiffs’ complaint was the Clerk’s 
decision to delay mailing the notice-to-cure to some voters on 
Saturday, November 12, 2022.  At the time the complaint was 
filed it appears the Plaintiffs did not know exactly how many of 
the notice-to-cure were mailed on November 12, 2022.  Based on 
the evidence later submitted in this case, it is undisputed that 
only 215 voters were mailed the notice-to-cure by the Clerk on 
November 12, 2022.  For all 215 of these voters, the Clerk 
received the ballots by no later than Tuesday, November 8, 2022.  Yet the Clerk waited four calendar days, until Saturday, 
November 12, 2022, to mail the notice-to-cure.   6 
 10. Pursuant to HRS § 11-106, these 215 voters had until 
Wednesday, November 16, 2022 to correct the deficiency with the 
ballot or the vote would not be counted.  See HRS § 11-108(c)   
11. The Clerk gave at least three reasons to explain why 
the Clerk had to delay mailing the notice-to-cure to these 215 
voters by four calendar days.  First, on the election day 
(November 8, 2022) the Clerk’s election officials were providing 
assistance to voters at the voter service center.  Second, on November 9, 2022 and November 10, 2022 the Clerk’s election 
officials were “dismantling” the voter service center to return 
the facility to another department of the county, and were also 
returning rented equipment, dismantling cameras and storing 
election equipment.  Third, on November 11, 2022 the post office 
was closed because it was a federal holiday.  Thus, it was 
impossible to mail the 215 notices on November 11, 2022. 
12. The record establishes that at least some of these 215 
voters received the notice-to-cure in the mail on Tuesday, November 15, 2022.  Thus, one-day before the deadline to 
validate the ballot.  See HRS §§ 11-106, 11-108(c). 
13. In addition to this delayed-mailing issue, the 
Plaintiffs also challenge the decision by the Clerk to withhold 
the names of the voters with deficient return identification 
envelopes from Plaintiff Ahia.  Specifically, on Monday, 
November 14, 2022, Plaintiff Ahia made a verbal and written 7 
 request to the Clerk for “a copy of the list of voters whose 
ballots had not been counted because their return identification 
envelopes had been deemed deficient.”  Dkt. 2 at 2, ¶ 4.  The 
Clerk denied Plaintiff Ahia’s request “on the grounds that the 
information was not public but between the voters on the list 
and her office.”  Id., ¶ 7. 
14. On November 22, 2022, the final result for the office 
Office of Elections as follows: Defendant Lee had received 22,733 votes; and, Plaintiff Ahia had received 22,220 votes.  
Thus, the vote differential is 513 votes in favor of Defendant 
Lee (election result). of councilmember for Wailuku-Waiheʻ e-Waikapū was reported by the 
15. On November 25, 2022, Plaintiffs filed the election 
contest with this court and thereby challenged the election 
result.  The claims stated in the complaint are addressed below.  
The Plaintiffs include the candidate, Plaintiff Ahia, as well as 
thirty voters who reside within the subject election district. 
16. Subsequently, the Defendants moved to dismiss the 
complaint, or in the alternative for summary judgment.  Plaintiffs have also moved for summary judgment.  In accordance 
with HRS § 11-174.5, the parties also submitted evidence for the 
court to review, including declarations and records. 
17.
 On January 19, 2023, this court heard oral argument. 8 
 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
1. To prevail on an election complaint the plaintiff must 
establish a mistake by an election official that “could cause a 
difference in the election results.”  HRS § 11-172.  “We read 
the words ‘difference in the election results’” in HRS § 11-172 
“to mean a difference sufficient to overturn” the final election 
results reported by the Chief Election Officer.  See Elkins v. 
Ariyoshi, 56 Haw. 47, 49, 527 P.2d 236, 237 (1974).  But where 
the specific irregularities complained of do not “exceed the 
reported margin between the candidates, the complaint is legally 
insufficient because, even if its truth were assumed, the result 
of the election would not be affected.”  Akaka v. Yoshina, 84 
Hawaiʻi 383, 388, 935 P.2d 98, 103 (1997).  
2. At Count 1 the Plaintiffs allege it was an error or 
mistake by the Clerk to wait until Saturday, November 12, 2022 to mail notice to voters of “alleged deficiencies in their 
return identification envelopes and instructions on how to cure 
them.”  Dkt. 1 at 6, ¶ 29.
1  On this record, it is undisputed 
that 215 notice-to-cure were mailed on November 12, 2022. 
3. Under HRS § 11-108(c) “[t]he clerk shall make 
reasonable efforts to determine the validity of ballots within 
seven days following an election day.”  HRS § 11-108(c).   
 
1  The Plaintiffs’ complaint at Count 1 is not barred by HRS § 11-
106 because the claim goes to the reasonableness of the C lerk’s actions as 
set forth in HRS § 11- 108. 9 
 4. As it relates only to the 215 voters who were mailed 
the notice-to-cure on November 12, 2022, we conclude the Clerk 
did not make reasonable efforts to determine the validity of 
these ballots.  See HRS § 11-108(c).  It was a mistake for the 
Clerk to prioritize the breakdown of the voter service center to 
return the facility to another department of the county and the 
related activities of returning rented equipment or storing 
election equipment over providing the notice-to-cure to these 
215 voters.  Id. 
5. We are not persuaded by the Clerk that it was 
reasonable to prioritize this other work over contacting voters 
with deficient return identification envelopes.  As this court 
has stated, “The right to vote is perhaps the most basic and 
fundamental of all the rights guaranteed by our democratic form 
of government.”  Akizaki v. Fong, 51 Haw. 354, 356, 461 P.2d 
221, 222–23 (1969).  Accordingly, the Clerk should have 
prioritized completing the specific activities required to protect the voters’ fundamental right to vote.   
6.  Thus, we find that it was an error to delay mailing 
the 215 notice-to-cure to voters by four calendar days to 
November 12, 2022.  The notice-to-cure should have been mailed 
sooner.
2 
 
2  The Clerk also waited until November 14, 2022 to begin calling 
the voters with deficient return identification envelopes.  Yet the record is 
silent as to why the Clerk waited to call these voters when the vast majority 10 
 7. Based on the record, the court holds that the mistake 
by the Clerk to wait until November 12, 2022 to mail the notice-
to-cure to the 215 voters would not change the outcome of the 
election.  See HRS §§ 11-172, 11-174.5.  This is because the 
reported vote margin between the candidates is 513 votes in favor of Defendant Lee.  Accordingly, as to Count 1, the court 
rules in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiffs.  
8. At Count 2, Plaintiffs allege the Clerk failed to 
correctly follow Hawaiʻ i Administrative Rule (HAR) § 3-177-652 
during the review of the return identification envelopes. 
 
9. In an election contest the burden is on the petitioner 
to establish a mistake that would change the result.  See Akaka, 
84 Hawaiʻ i 383, 935 P.2d 98.  On this record, the Plaintiffs 
failed to carry this burden. 
10. Here, the record establishes that of the voters with 
return identification envelopes that the Clerk determined were 
deficient under HAR §§ 3-177-651 and 3-177-652, only 215 of 
these voters were mailed the notice-to-cure on November 12, 
2022.  All of the remaining 491 voters were provided with 
reasonable notice and the opportunity to correct the deficiency 
on the return identification envelope before the November 16, 
2022 deadline.  See HRS §§ 11-106, 11-108(c).
 
 
of the deficient return identification envelopes would have been identified 
before the November 8, 2022 election. 11 
 11. Based on the record, the court holds that any 
purported error by the Clerk in the review of the return 
identification envelopes would apply to, at most, the 215 voters 
who were not provided with a reasonable period of time to cure 
the deficiency.  HRS §§ 11-106, 11-108(c).  The reported vote 
margin between the candidates is 513 votes in favor of Defendant 
Lee.  Thus, Plaintiffs at Count 2 failed to establish a mistake 
that would change the outcome of the election.  See HRS §§ 11-172, 11-174.5.  Accordingly, as to Count 2, the court rules in 
favor of Defendants and against Plaintiffs. 
12. At Count 3, Plaintiffs assert it was an error for the 
Clerk to withhold the names of the voters with return 
identification envelopes that had been deemed deficient.  We 
disagree.
 
13. The court finds the Clerk did not commit an election 
mistake on November 14, 2022 in refusing to release the names of 
the voters with deficient return identification envelopes to Plaintiff Ahia.   
14. The specific information in question is the 
information on whether-a-person-voted as identified from a 
return identification envelope submitted by the voter.  We find 
this information is “voted materials” under HRS § 11-97(b) 
(2012) and it was not an error for the Clerk to withhold this 12 
 confidential information from Plaintiff Ahia on November 14, 
2022. 3
15. In support of Count 3 the Plaintiffs cited to Coray v. 
Ariyoshi, 54 Haw. 254, 506 P.2d 13 (1973).  But the holding in 
Coray is distinguishable from this case.  Coray did not address 
whether the election official (i.e., the government) was 
obligated to provide the poll watchers with the name of the 
persons who voted.  54 Haw. at 262, 506 P.2d at 17.  To the contrary, in Coray it was the poll watchers who witnessed the 
election process and gathered this information for their 
political party.  Id.  The poll watchers were not given this 
information (i.e., as to who voted) by the government.  Id.; see 
HRS § 11-77 (Supp. 2019). 
16. In sum, the Clerk was correct to not immediately 
disclose the confidential information.  And, a party seeking to 
compel the disclosure of the confidential voted materials must 
apply for an order from the court.  See HRS § 11-97(b). See 
e.g., Haw. Const. art. I, § 6, art. II, § 4.  Accordingly, the 
 
3  In this case, the Chief Election Officer explained that the term 
“voter status” refers to whether a voter is an “active voter” in terms of 
their voter registration record being in proper order to be able to vote.   
Dkt. 67:6, ¶ 5; see HRS § 11- 97(a).  In contrast, and as further explained by 
the Chief Election Officer, the term “voter status” does not include 
information on whether a person actually voted.  See Dkt. 67:6, ¶ 7.  See, 
e.g., HRS § 11-2 (a), (e) (2012) (“The chief election officer shall supervise 
all state elections” and “shall adopt rules governing elections[.]”). 13 court rules in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiffs on 
Count 3. 
17. At Count 4, Plaintiffs claim the lack of
administrative rules or unlawful rule making is a type of 
election error and, as a result, “a correct outcome” of the 
election contest “cannot be ascertained.”  Dkt. 1:8-9.  We 
disagree. 
18. The court finds that the Chief Election Officer has
promulgated rules.  See HAR § 3-177-650, et seq.  Plaintiffs’ 
claim as to Count 4 is without merit and is not supported by any 
evidence. 
19. Accordingly, the court holds, as a matter of law,
that Plaintiffs’ Count 4 fails to assert a viable cause to 
challenge the election contest under HRS §§ 11-172 and 11-174.5.  
The court rules in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiffs at 
Count 4. 
20. Plaintiffs’ claims at Count 5 and Count 6 are based on
the Clerk’s decision to delay by four-calendar days from November 8, 2022 until November 12, 2022 the mailing of the 
notice-to-cure to the 215 voters with return identification 
envelopes that the Clerk identified as deficient. 
21. Here, the indisputable evidence is only 215 ballots
were subject to the alleged unequal treatment (Count 5) or were 
not provided due process (Count 6).  The final result as 14 22.The court issues this decision based on the evidence
submitted by the parties and the record before the court.  See HRS § 
11-174.5(b) (providing “the court shall cause the evidence to be  
reduced to writing and shall give judgment, stating all findings of  
fact and of law.”).  Accordingly, the motions pending before the court  
are denied as moot.
JUDGMENT  
It is hereby ordered in accordance with HRS § 11-174.5 as follows: 
We find that Defendant Alice L. Lee received a majority of the 
votes cast and has been elected to the office of councilmember for the 
Wailuku-Waihe ʻe-Waikap ū seat on the Maui County Council.   
   reported by the Chief Election Officer is Defendant Lee with 22,733 
votes and Plaintiff Ahia with 22,220, representing a vote differential 
of 513 in favor of Defendant Lee.  Based on the record, the court 
holds that any purported mistake by the Clerk as alleged at Count 5 
and Count 6 would not change the outcome of the election.  See HRS §§ 
11-172, 11-174.5.  Accordingly, as to Count 5 and Count 6, the court
rules in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiffs.
The court enters judgment in favor of Defendants and 
against Plaintiffs as to all claims stated in the complaint.15 /s/ Mark E. Reckten
