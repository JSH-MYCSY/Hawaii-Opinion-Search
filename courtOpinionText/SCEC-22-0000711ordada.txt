ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
ORDER DISMISSING ELECTION COMPLAINT 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
 
  Upon consideration of the election complaint filed on November 28, 2022, the motion to dismiss or for summary judgment 
filed on December 2, 2022, and the record, this court’s original 
jurisdiction to hear election contests is derived from Hawaiʻ i 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 11-172 (Supp. 2021), which requires an 
election complaint to “set forth any causes or causes . . . that 
could cause a difference in the election results.” Electronically Filed

Dkt. 14 ORD2 
 Plaintiff’s complaint states it seeks only a 
“[d]eclaratory [j]udgment of [f]acts, Rule 57 HRCP without 
[r]elief.”  The complaint does not “set forth any cause or 
causes . . . that could cause a difference in the election 
results.”  See HRS § 11-172.  We thus decline to address the 
merits of the complaint because none of them amount to errors that could change the outcome of an election.  See Lewis v. 
Cayetano, 72 Haw. 499, 503, 823 P.2d 738, 741 (1992) (declining 
to address the merits of an issue because, even if the contention were accepted, the election results would not have 
changed and the plaintiffs would not be entitled to relief). 
It is ordered that the complaint is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai i, December 15, 2022.
