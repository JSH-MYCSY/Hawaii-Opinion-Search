Dkt. 25 ORD2 
 I. BACKGROUND 
On December 15, 2022, Cordery, pro se, submitted by 
electronic filing a document entitled “request for declaratory 
judgement without relief pursuant to HRCP Rule 57 . . .” 
(complaint) which was docketed as an “election contest” in the 
Hawaiʻi Supreme Court.1  Dkt. 1; see also Dkt. 2 (notice of 
electronic filing).  The complaint’s caption and allegations 
identify the plaintiffs as “Gary Arthur Cordery pro se, along 
with more than Thirty Voters pro se”.  Dkt. 1:1.  The complaint 
asserts this court has jurisdiction under Hawaiʻ i Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 11-172 (Supp. 2021), which is the election 
contest statute, and HRS § 602-5 (2016).  Dkt. 1:2.   
The complaint’s allegations take issue with the timing of 
the inaugurations,2 and do not challenge any election results.  
See Dkt. 1.  The prayer for relief requests a declaratory 
judgment related to the timing of the inaugurations.  See Dkt. 
1:14-18. 
 
1 The complaint refers to the parties as petitioner/respondent, but this 
is incorrect.  In an election contest the parties are referred to as 
plaintiff/defendant.  See Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 
81(b)(10) (establishing that the HRCP apply to election contests); see also 
HRCP Rule 17 (“Parties p laintiffs and d efendant”). 
 
2 C.f., Haw. Const. art. V, § 1 (providing that “[t]he term of office of 
the governor shall begin at noon on the first Monday in December next 
following the governor’s election and end at noon on the first Monday 
in December, four years thereafter.”). 3 
 The complaint was only signed by Cordery and included 
Cordery’s address and phone number.  Dkt. 1:1, 16.  The 
complaint does not include the signature, address or phone 
number for any of the other thirty plaintiffs.  See Dkt. 1; see 
also HRCP Rule 11(a) (requiring a pro se party to sign a 
pleading and to include the pro se party’s “address and 
telephone number, if any”). 
On December 16, 2022 - the day after the complaint was 
filed - Cordery submitted an electronic filing of a document titled “Exhibit 3 Request for Declaratory Judgement” that 
appears to identify the purported signatures of thirty voters.  
Dkt. 7; see Dkt. 8 (notice of electronic filing). 
On December 16, 2022, Cordery filed a motion to correct the 
record to identify a defendant (Motion #1).  Dkt. 9.  Motion #1 
is only signed by Cordery.  Dkt. 9:2.  There is no signature of 
the other thirty plaintiffs.  Id. 
On December 22, 2022, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss 
the complaint.  Dkt. 15.  Defendants’ arguments for dismissal are addressed below. 
On December 26, 2022, Cordery filed a memorandum in 
opposition to Defendants’ motion to dismiss.  Dkt. 17.  The 
memorandum in opposition is only signed by Cordery.  Dkt. 17:8.  
There is no signature of any of the other thirty plaintiffs.  4 Id.  The arguments asserted by Cordery in opposition to the 
Defendants’ motion to dismiss are addressed below.  Dkt. 17. 
On January 6, 2023, Cordery filed a motion for 
interrogatories.  Dkt. 19.  The document states, “I, Gary Arthur 
Cordery pro se, lead Petitioner, hereby bring this Motion for 
Interrogatories” (Motion #2).  Dkt. 19:1.  Motion #2 is only 
signed by Cordery.  Id. 
On January 12, 2023, Defendants filed a memorandum in 
opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion #2.  Dkt. 21. 
On January 16, 2023, Cordery filed a motion for additional 
interrogatories (Motion #3).  Dkt. 23.  Motion #3 is only signed by Cordery.  Dkt. 23:5. 
II. LEGAL STANDARD
Defendants move to dismiss the complaint pursuant to HRCP 
Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of jurisdiction.  Dkt. 15:6.  “Our review of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
is based on the contents of the complaint, the allegations of which we accept as true and construe in the light most 
81, 137 P.3d 980, 987 (2006) (cleaned up).  Dismissal of the 
complaint is appropriate if “it appears beyond doubt that the 
plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim 
which would entitle him to relief.”  Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-favorable” to the plaintiff.  Yamane v. Pohlson, 111
 Hawaiʻi 74, 5 
 Toledo, 143 Hawaiʻ i 249, 258, 428 P.3d 761, 770 (2018) (citation 
omitted); see Yamane, 111 Hawaiʻ i at 81, 428 P.3d at 987 (same). 
III. DISCUSSION 
A.  Non-attorney Cordery is the only Plaintiff  
While Defendants’ motion to dismiss did not raise any issue 
with Cordery, who is not an attorney, appearing to represent 
other natural persons in this case, the Court will sua sponte 
address the issue. 
 Under HRS § 605–2 (2016) and HRS § 605–14 (2016), persons 
who are not licensed to practice law in Hawaiʻ i “are not 
permitted to act as ‘attorneys’ and represent other natural 
persons” in a lawsuit.  Oahu Plumbing and Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. 
Kona Construction, Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 377, 590 P.2d 570, 573 
(1979) (citing HRS § 605-14 (“Unauthorized practice of law 
prohibited”)); see also HRS § 605-2 (providing, in pertinent 
part, that “no person shall be allowed to practice in any court 
of the State unless that person has been duly licensed . . . by 
the supreme court[.]”). 
 This court’s decision in Alexander & Baldwin, LLC v. 
Armitage, 151  37, 48-54, 508 P.3d 832, 843-849 (2022), is Hawaiʻi
instructive.  In Armitage the circuit court had allowed non-
attorneys to represent an unincorporated association known as 
the “Reinstated Hawaiian Nation” in court to defend on an 
ejectment claim.  Id., 151  at 42, 48, 508 P.3d at 837, Hawaiʻi6 843.
The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the
plaintiff Alexander & Baldwin, LLC and against the defendant
Reinstated Hawaiian Nation.  Id. at 45, 508 P.3d at 840.  On
appeal, this court held:
Because Noa and Armitage, as non -lawyers, were not 
authorized to represent the Reinstated Hawaiian Nation in 
court, the circuit court should have exercised its inherent 
power to prevent their unauthorized practice of law. “Our 
courts have inherent and statutory powers to deal with the 
unauthorized practice of law. . . .  Under those powers, 
our courts, sua sponte, may prevent an unauthorized person 
from practicing law in a case pending before [them].” . . . 
Courts have an active role in enforcing HRS §§ 605- 2 and 
605-14.  Thus, they not only may but should act sua
sponteto prevent non- attorneys from practicing law before 
them. 
Armitage, 151 Hawaiʻ i at 49, 508 P.3d at 844 (first citation 
omitted) (emphasis added). 
In so holding this court rejected a blanket “nullity rule” 
whereby actions of a non-attorney would “automatically result in 
a nullity.”  Id. at 50, 508 P.3d at 845; see id., at 51, 508 
P.3d at 846 (“[W]e do not view the nullity rule as necessary in
every case to promote the policies behind the ban on the
unauthorized practice of law.”).  Instead, the court explained:
[B]ecause the consequences of applying the nullity rule to
a case can be harsh, it should be invoked only where it
fulfills the purposes of protecting both the public and the
integrity of the court system from the actions of the
unlicensed, and where no other alternative remedy is
possible.
Armitage, 151  at 52, 508 P.3d at 847 (citation omitted). 
This court then went on to establish that “courts should address 
the effects of non-attorney representation on a case-by-case Hawaiʻi7 basis” and that the remedy imposed by the court should vindicate 
the “policy aims of HRS §§ 605-2 and 605-14, namely protecting 
the courts and the public, including the litigants, from the 
conduct of non-attorneys.”  Armitage, 151 Hawaiʻ i at 52-53, 508 
P.3d at 847-48.  The court held that in conducting this analysis
the courts should consider the following factors:
1.Whether the non- attorney’s conduct is done without
knowledge that the action was improper;
2.Whether the party acted diligently in correcting the
mistake by obtaining counsel;
3.Whether the non- attorney’s participation is minimal;
4.Whether the participation results in prejudice to the
opposing party; and
5.Any other relevant circumstances.
See Armitage, 151 Hawaiʻ i at 52–53, 508 P.3d at 847–48.  The 
court in Armitage then went on to apply these factors and 
vacated the summary judgment that had been entered by the 
circuit court.  Id. at 51-54, 508 P.3d at 846-49. 
Turning to the case before the court, the complaint asserts 
that the plaintiffs include “more than thirty voters pro se” (Dkt. 1:1) and that the signatures of these voters are attached 
at Exhibit 3.  Dkt. 1:16.  Yet there is no Exhibit 3 attached to 
the complaint, and the complaint itself does not include the names, signature, and phone numbers for any plaintiffs except 
for Cordery.  See Dkt. 1.  Even the caption of the complaint is 
silent as to the names of these other thirty voters.  Id. 
The day after the complaint was filed, on December 16, 
2022, Cordery submitted an electronic filing of the signatures 8 of the thirty voters on a document that is marked “Exhibit 3”.  
See Dkt. 7; see also Dkt. 8 (indicating on the notice of 
electronic filing that Cordery filed Docket No. 7). 
The issue before the court, therefore, is whether the 
Exhibit 3 document filed by non-attorney Cordery the day after 
the complaint was filed joins these other natural persons to 
this action. 
Applying the Armitage factors, we hold that the Exhibit 3 
filing (Dkt. 7) does not have the legal effect of joining other 
natural persons to this action and, therefore, the only 
plaintiff to this action is Cordery. 
As to the first factor - whether Cordery’s conduct was done 
without knowledge that the action was improper - this factor is 
neutral as the record is silent as to whether Cordery knows he 
is not authorized to represent other natural persons in this 
action.  See Armitage, 151 Hawaiʻ i at 52–53, 508 P.3d at 847–48. 
As to the second factor - whether these thirty voters acted 
diligently in correcting the mistake - the record indicates that 
none of these voters have filed a document in this case or have 
otherwise appeared on their own behalf in this action.  Id.  
Thus, as to the second factor it weighs in favor of finding the 
Exhibit 3 filing (Dkt. 7) has no legal effect. 
As to the third factor - whether non-attorney Cordery’s 
participation is minimal - this factor weighs in favor of a 9 finding that the Exhibit 3 filing has no legal effect.  See 
Armitage, 151 Hawaiʻ i at 52–53, 508 P.3d at 847–48. 
Cordery has submitted numerous filings on behalf of other 
natural persons.  Specifically, the complaint (Dkt. 1) and other 
documents were filed by Cordery on behalf of other natural 
persons.  See Dkts. 1, 9, 17, 19, 23.  In these filings Cordery 
purports to act as the “lead Petitioner” (see Dkts. 17:1, 19:1) 
and requests relief on behalf of “Petitioners” or “Plaintiffs.”  
See Dkt. 9:2 (stating “Petitioners reserve all rights[.]”); Dkt. 
17:5 (arguing jurisdiction and asserting that “Plaintiffs 
maintain”).  Yet none of these documents were signed by the 
other plaintiffs.  See Dkts. 1, 9, 17, 19, 23. 
As to the fourth factor - whether the participation results 
in prejudice to the opposing party - this factor is neutral as 
the record is silent as to any prejudice to the Defendants.  See 
Armitage, 151 Hawaiʻ i at 52–53, 508 P.3d at 847–48. 
As to the fifth factor - other relevant circumstances - 
this factor also weighs in favor of finding the Exhibit 3 filing 
(Dkt. 7) has no legal effect and that Cordery is the only 
48. This is because Cordery did not include any contact
information for any of the other “thirty voters” and, thus,
there is no way for the court to contact them without going
directly through Cordery.  See HRCP Rule 11(a) (requiring aplaintiff.  See Armitage, 151 Hawaiʻ i at 52–53, 508 P.3d at 847–10 self-represented natural person to sign every pleading, written 
motion, or other paper filed with the court).  
In sum, three of the five Armitage factors weigh in favor 
of a finding that Cordery is the only plaintiff before the court 
and Cordery’s Exhibit 3 filing (see Dkt. 7) did not join the 
other purported plaintiffs to this action.  As set forth in 
Armitage, before the court applies the nullity rule it must also 
consider policy considerations and alternative remedies:  
[B]ecause the consequences of applying the nullity rule to
a case can be harsh, it should be invoked only where it
fulfills the purposes of protecting both the public and the
integrity of the court system from the actions of the
unlicensed, and where no other alternative remedy is
possible.
Armitage, 151 Hawaiʻ i at 52, 508 P.3d at 847 (citation omitted).   
Here, to apply the nullity rule to Cordery’s Exhibit 3 
filing (Dkt. 7) serves to protect the public from the 
unauthorized practice of law.  See Armitage, 151 Hawaiʻ i at 52–
53, 508 P.3d at 847–48.  This is because Cordery, as a non-
attorney, is not authorized to represent the thirty voters and 
Cordery’s filing on December 16, 2022 of a document on behalf of 
the voters is a document filed in violation of HRS §§ 605-2 and 
605-14.
The application of the nullity rule to the Exhibit 3 filing
also protects the “integrity of the court system from the 
actions of the unlicensed” because it is consistent with other 11 court rules.  See Armitage, 151   
847–48. at 52–53, 508 P.3d at Hawaiʻi
In this case for other natural persons to join this lawsuit 
they were required to sign the complaint.  See HRCP Rule 11(a) 
(“Every pleading, written motion, and other paper . . . if the 
party is unrepresented, shall be signed by the party.”).  But 
only Cordery signed the complaint.  Dkt. 1:16.   
After the complaint was filed, in order for other self-
represented natural persons to join this lawsuit, these natural 
persons would need to file a motion and obtain leave of court.  
See HRCP Rule 24(c).  And to comply with HRCP Rule 11(a), any 
motion filed by a natural person would need to be signed by the 
party that seeks to join the case.  But no such motion was 
filed.   
Given the failure of Cordery to follow the court rules, the 
application of the nullity rule to Exhibit 3 (Dkt. 7) also 
protects the “integrity of the court system from the actions of 
the unlicensed”.  See Armitage, 151 Hawaiʻ i at 52, 508 P.3d at 
847. 
The final consideration is whether an “alternative remedy 
is possible.”  Id.  Here, one alternative remedy would be to 
construe the complaint liberally to include the next-day filed 
Exhibit 3 (Dkt. 7), and thereby allow Cordery to join thirty 
additional plaintiffs to this action.  The court finds this 12 alternative is inappropriate because it would countenance 
Cordery representing the other natural persons in this case in 
violation of HRS §§ 605-2 and 605-14. 
In addition, this alternative remedy is inconsistent with 
the policy considerations behind the fundamental tenant of 
Hawaiʻi law that a pleading prepared by a pro se litigant “should 
be interpreted liberally.”  See Waltrip v. TS Enterprises, Inc., 
140 Hawaiʻ i 226, 239, 398 P.3d 815, 828 (2016) (citation 
omitted).  “The underpinnings of this tenet rest on the 
promotion of equal access to justice — a pro se litigant should 
not be prevented from proceeding on a pleading or letter to an 
agency if a reasonable, liberal construction of the document 
would permit [them] to do so.”  Id.  But here the complaint will 
be dismissed as untimely and for lack of jurisdiction regardless 
of whether additional parties are joined.  Therefore, a liberal 
construction of the complaint to include the Exhibit 3 filing 
(Dkt. 7) would not serve to promote equal access to justice, and 
the court declines to construe the complaint liberally to 
include the Exhibit 3 filing. 
A second alternative remedy would be to notify the thirty 
voters of their failure to sign the complaint.  In the usual 
situation, the clerk would bring a party’s failure to sign a 
document to the attention of the party before the document is 
stricken.  See HRCP Rule 11(a) (providing that “[a]n unsigned 13 paper shall be stricken by the clerk unless omission of the 
signature is corrected promptly after being called to the 
attention of the attorney or party.”).   
But in this case, there is no way to notify the voters set 
forth on Exhibit 3 (Dkt. 7) of their failure to sign the 
original complaint without going through their purported 
representative, Cordery.  This is because the complaint and all 
subsequent documents filed by Cordery did not include the 
addresses and phone numbers for any of the other pro se voters.  
In this circumstance there is no reasonable alternative remedy 
available for this court to bring the omission of the failure to 
sign the complaint to the attention of the thirty pro se voters. 
Accordingly, we find Cordery is the only plaintiff in this 
case. 
B. The Election Contest is Time Barred
The complaint cites to HRS § 11-172 as the basis for this
court’s jurisdiction.  Dkt. 1:2.  And Cordery has maintained 
throughout his filings that this court has jurisdiction to 
consider this action as a contested election under article II, 14 
 section 10 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution,  HRS § 11-171 (2009),  
and HRS § 11-172.  See Dkt. 17:5-7.   4 3
 Defendants move to dismiss the complaint on the basis that 
Cordery failed to meet the statutory deadline to file an 
election contest as set forth in HRS § 11-174.5 (Supp. 2021). 
Dkt. 15:10. 
In response, Cordery argues that HRS § 11-174.5 is 
“irrelevant to this action” because Cordery made “no reference 
to this statute anywhere in this election complaint.”  See Dkt. 
17:3.  Cordery also cites to Watland v. Lingle, 104 Hawaiʻ i 128, 
133 n.8, 85 P.3d 1079, 1084 n.8 (2004), for the general 
proposition that this court “has jurisdiction to consider the 
election challenge[.]”  Dkt. 17:7.  Essentially Cordery argues 
there is no time limitation on an election contest under HRS § 11-172 when the party asserting the election contest does not 
rely on HRS § 11-174.5.  See Dkt. 17:3-7. 
Cordery’s reliance on Watland is misplaced.  Watland does 
not stand for the broad proposition that an election contest 
under HRS § 11-172 has no deadline.  To the contrary, in Watland 
the election contest challenging the ratification of the 
 
3 Article II, section 10 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution  provides, “Contested 
elections shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in such 
manner as shall be provided by law.”  
 
4  HRS § 11- 171 provides, “This part shall apply whenever a contested 
election is subject to determination by a court of competent jurisdiction in 
the manner provided by law.” 15 
 constitutional amendment by the electorate in the November 5, 
2002 general election was filed on November 22, 2002, seventeen 
days after the general election.  See Watland, 104 Hawai
ʻi at 
132-33, 85 P.3d at 1083-84.  In 2002, HRS § 11-174.5(a) was 
identical to the current version of the statute, which provides: 
(a) In general, special general, special, or runoff 
elections, the complaint shall be filed in the office of 
the clerk of the supreme court not later than 4:30 p.m. on 
the twentieth day following the general, special general, 
special, or runoff election and shall be accompanied by a 
deposit for costs of court as established by rules of the 
supreme court.  The clerk shall issue to the defendants 
named in the complaint a summons to appear before the 
supreme court not later than 4:30 p.m. on the tenth day 
after service thereof. 
 
HRS § 11-174.5 (emphasis added).  Cordery is incorrect that 
Watland allows for an exception to the statutory deadlines to 
file an election contest under HRS § 11-172.  To the extent 
Watland has any application to the instant case it would be the 
exact opposite of the proposition argued by Cordery because the 
election contest in Watland was filed within the 20-day deadline 
to file an election contest challenging a general election 
result as established by HRS § 11-174.5.  See Watland, 104 
Hawaiʻi at 132-33, 85 P.3d at 1083-84.      
Notably, the complaint’s core allegations - viewed in a 
light most favorable to Cordery and deemed to be true - are not 
a direct challenge to any election result, and rather they 
complain about the timing of certain inaugurations.  See Dkt. 1.  
Yet Cordery maintains throughout his pleading and filings that 16 this court has jurisdiction to consider the complaint as a 
contested election under HRS § 11-172.  To this end, we agree 
with Defendants that any election contest claim made in the 
complaint under HRS § 11-172 is time barred. 
HRS § 11-172 provides: 
With respect to any election, any candidate, or qualified 
political party directly interested, or any thirty voters 
of any election district, may file a complaint in the 
supreme court.  The complaint shall set forth any cause or 
causes, such as but not limited to, provable fraud, 
overages, or underages, that could cause a difference in 
the election results.  The complaint shall also set forth 
any reasons for reversing, correcting, or changing the 
decisions of the voter service center officials or the 
officials at a counting center in an election using the 
electronic voting system.  A copy of the complaint shall be 
delivered to the chief election officer or the clerk in the 
case of county elections.  
See HRS § 11-172.  Under HRS § 11-174.5(a), the deadline to file 
a contest for cause of the general election pursuant to HRS 
§ 11-172 is “not later than 4:30 p.m. on the twentieth day”
following the general election.  Id.; see also Tataii v. Cronin,
119 Hawaiʻ i 337, 339, 198 P.3d 124, 126 (2008) (holding in an
election contest challenging the result of a general election
“pursuant to HRS § 11-172” that the “twenty-day provision of HRS
§ 11–174.5(a) is mandatory”).
While the complaint does not allege the date of the general 
election, the Constitution of the State of Hawaiʻ i sets forth the 
date of the general election: 
General elections shall be held on the first Tuesday after 
the first Monday in November in all even- numbered 
years.  Special and primary elections may be held as 
provided by law; provided that in no case shall any primary 17 election precede a general election by less than forty- five 
days. 
Haw. Const. art. II, § 8 (emphasis added).  And in 2022 the date 
fell on Tuesday, November 8, 2022.  See Hawaiʻ i Rules of 
Evidence, Rule 201(c) (allowing the court to take judicial 
notice of a fact not subject to reasonable dispute because it is 
“capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to 
sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.”); A. 
Bowman, Hawaiʻ i Rules of Evidence Manual, § 201-5[2] (2020) 
(“Calendars can be used to ascertain the day on which a 
particular date fell” and collecting cases).5   
Here, the deadline for Cordery to file an election 
challenge based on HRS § 11-172 was on November 28, 2022.  See  
HRS § 11-174.5(a).  But the complaint was filed after this 
deadline on December 15, 2022.  See Dkt. 1.   
Accordingly, to the extent Cordery’s complaint asserts an 
election contest claim based on HRS § 11-172, we hold the claim 
is time barred by HRS § 11-174.5(a). 
C. The Declaratory Judgment Claim is Dismissed
Defendants also move to dismiss the complaint on the basis
that this court lacks original jurisdiction to resolve the complaint’s claim for declaratory judgment.  See Dkt. 15:14.  In 
5When considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(b)(1) the 
trial court is “not restricted to the face of the pleadings, but may review 
any evidence . . .  to resolve factual disputes concerning the existence of 
jurisdiction.”  Yamane, 111 Hawaiʻ i at 81, 137 P.3d at 987.  18 
 response, Cordery argues this court has jurisdiction to consider 
the claim for declaratory judgment pursuant to HRS § 602-5.  
Dkt. 17:6-7. 
We agree with Defendants.  Cordery’s claim for declaratory judgment is not a direct 
challenge to the election results, and instead takes issue with the timing of the inauguration of the certain elected officials.  
See Dkt. 1.  The particular relief requested by Cordery is akin 
to the relief available under Chapter 632, titled “Declaratory 
Judgments.”  Specifically, HRS § 632-1 (2016) provides that 
declaratory relief, including on the interpretation of a 
statute, may be granted in the specific circumstances enumerated 
therein.  HRS § 632-1(a), (b).   
Outside of a challenge to a constitutional amendment, this 
court is without original jurisdiction to consider a claim for 
declaratory judgment.  See HRS § 602-5; see also Blaisdell v. 
Dep’t of Pub. Safety, No. 30342, 2010 WL 708623, at *1 (Haw. 
Feb. 25, 2010) (dismissing a petition for writ of mandamus on 
the basis “that issuance of a declaratory judgment . . . is not 
within the original jurisdiction of the supreme court.” (citing 
HRS §§ 602–5 and 632–1); Blaisdell v. Trader, No. 29895, 2009 WL 
1944467, at *1 (Haw. July 7, 2009) (same); Blaisdell v. Dep’t of 
Pub. Safety, No. 29920, 2009 WL 2387371, at *1 (Haw. Aug. 3, 
2009) (same).  The only narrow exception to this jurisdictional 19 
 bar, is that this court has original jurisdiction to consider a 
claim for declaratory relief on the validity of a constitutional 
amendment.  See Taomae v. Lingle, 108 
Hawaiʻi 245, 250, 118 P.3d 
1188, 1193 (2005) (granting in an original proceeding before the 
court the plaintiffs’ requested relief for declaratory judgment 
that the bill proposing a constitutional amendment “was not 
validly passed”); see also Watland, 104 Hawai
ʻi at 134–35, 85 
P.3d at 1085–86 (considering in an original proceeding before 
the court the plaintiffs’ requested relief to invalidate the 
ratification of a constitutional amendment); Kahalekai v. Doi, 
60 Haw. 324, 331, 590 P.2d 543, 549 (1979) (similar). 
 Here, the narrow exception clearly does not apply because Cordery’s claim for declaratory judgment is not related to the 
passage of a constitutional amendment.  See Dkt. 1.  Rather, the 
jurisdiction to consider the merits of a claim for declaratory 
relief is with the circuit court.  See HRS § 632-1(b) (providing 
relief by declaratory judgment “may be granted in civil cases”) ; 
HRS § 603-21.5(a)(3) (2016 & Supp. 2021) (establishing the circuit court with jurisdiction of civil actions).  See e.g., 
Tax Found. of Hawaii v. State, 144 Hawaiʻ i 175, 189, 439 P.3d 
127, 141 (2019) (discussing the nature of standing requirements 
in declaratory judgment actions under HRS § 632-1).  Accordingly, the court grants Defendants’ motion to dismiss. 20 / Wendy M. DeWeese  /s

Pending Motions 
 Cordery’s complaint requests the court take judicial notice 
of the Hawaiʻ i laws cited therein.  Dkt. 1:3.  Defendants did not 
file any opposition to Cordery’s request.  Pursuant to Hawaiʻ i 
Rules of Evidence Rule 202(b) (2016), the request for judicial 
notice of the Hawaiʻ i laws cited in the complaint is granted. 
 Cordery’s motions are all denied as moot. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
 
Accordingly, it is ordered that the Defendants’ motion to 
dismiss is granted.  The complaint is dismissed as to all claims 
and parties.
