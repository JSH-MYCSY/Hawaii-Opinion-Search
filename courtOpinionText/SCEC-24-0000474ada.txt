ORIGINAL PROCEEDING

RECKTENWALD, C.J., McKENNA, EDDINS, GINOZA, AND DEVENS, JJ. 
 
PER CURIAM 
In this election contest, filed before the election results 
have even posted, a nonpartisan candidate alleges that the 
primary election ballots suffer from constitutional and 
statutory infirmities. We disagree. 
For the reasons discussed, we dismiss all election contest 
claims for failure to state a claim. 
We also liberally construe  
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the complaint as seeking a petition for a writ of mandamus 
directed to a public officer, and deny the petition. 
I. Background 
On July 11, 2024, Plaintiff Karl Orlando Dicks filed a 
complaint challenging the primary election ballot’s requirement 
that the voter select a political preference to vote. 
Plaintiff 
claims the primary ballot violates article II, section 4 of the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution and Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 12-21, 
12-31, and 12-42 (2009), and citing to HRS §§ 11-172 (Supp. 2021), 11-173.5 (2009 & Supp. 2023), 11-174.5 (2009 & Supp. 
2021), 91-14 (2012 & Supp. 2016) and 602-5 (2016), he seeks an 
order directing Defendants to design a ballot that conforms to the law and to declare the current ballot invalid. 
On July 16, 2024, Defendants State of Hawai
ʻi, Office of 
Elections and Scott Nago, in his official capacity as Chief 
Election Officer of the State of Hawaiʻi, moved to dismiss the 
complaint for failure to state a claim or lack of jurisdiction. 
II. Discussion 
A. Plaintiff’s claims under HRS §§ 11-173.5, 11-174.5 and 
91-14, are dismissed 
Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to 
state a claim. 
Dismissal of a claim is appropriate where the plaintiff can 
prove no set of facts in support of a claim to be entitled to 
2  
 
  
 
    
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
relief. See Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo , 143 Hawaiʻi 249, 
258, 428 P.3d 761, 770 (2018). 
HRS § 11-173.5 applies to primary election contests, and 
the relief available is for this court to enter a judgment that 
decides which candidate was nominated or elected. See
 HRS § 11-
173.5(b). Under HRS § 11-174.5, for a general election the remedies available are for this court to decide which candidate 
was elected, or to invalidate the election when the correct 
result cannot be ascertained. Thus, to state a claim to relief 
under HRS §§ 11-173.5 and 11-174.5, the complaint must plead 
that election results have posted. 
 Here, the complaint fails to state a claim under HRS §§ 11-
173.5 and 11-174.5 because no posted election results are 
challenged. In addition, Plaintiff’s reliance on HRS § 91-14 is 
misplaced as HRS § 91-14 applies to an appeal of a contested 
case, and has no application to election contests. 
Based on the foregoing, the complaint’s claims made under 
HRS §§ 11-173.5,
1 11-174.5, and 91-14 are dismissed for failure 
to state a claim. 
For a primary election contest, HRS § 11-173.5(b) requires the 
disposition be entered by “the fourth day after the return[.]” To fall under 
this deadline, the complaint must challenge the primary election results. See HRS § 11-173.5(b) (requiring the judgment to decide what candidate was 
nominated/elected). Accordingly, we find that the disposition deadline stated in HRS § 11- 173.5(b) has no application because, as detailed in the 
complaint and Defendants’ motion to dismiss, no election results have posted.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B. Plaintiff’s claims under HRS § 11-172 are dismissed 
Plaintiff’s complaint also challenged all primary election 
ballots statewide under HRS § 11-172. In opposition, citing to 
HRS § 11-172 and 
Tax Found. of Hawaiʻi v. State
, 144 Hawaiʻi 175, 
439 P.3d 127 (2019), Defendants argued that Plaintiff, as a 
nonpartisan candidate for the Mayor’s race in the City and 
County of Honolulu, has no standing to challenge all statewide 
ballots, and only has standing to bring an election contest in 
the race where he is a candidate. 
The question presented is thus whether a nonpartisan 
candidate for a county race has standing under HRS § 11-172 
to challenge all primary ballots statewide. 
In Hawaiʻi state courts, standing is solely an issue of 
justiciability, arising out of prudential concerns of judicial 
self-governance, and is based on concern about the properly 
limited role of courts in a democratic society. See Tax Found., 
144 Hawaiʻ i at 190-92, 439 P.3d at  142-44.  
The rules of statutory interpretation require us to apply a 
plain language analysis when statutory language is clear. SeeBarker v. Young, 153 
Hawaiʻi 144, 149, 528 P.3d 217, 222 (2023). 
HRS § 11-172 provides: 
§ 11-172. Contest for cause; generally 
With respect to any election, any candidate, or qualified 
political party directly interested, or any thirty voters 
of any election district, may file a complaint in the 
supreme court. The complaint shall set forth any cause or 
4  
 
  
 
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
causes, such as but not limited to, provable fraud, 
overages, or underages, that could cause a difference in 
the election results. The complaint shall also set forth 
any reasons for reversing, correcting, or changing the 
decisions of the voter service center officials or the 
officials at a counting center in an election using the electronic voting system. A copy of the complaint shall be 
delivered to the chief election officer or the clerk in the 
case of county elections. 
Construing HRS § 11-172, the plain language limits who may 
file an election contest to “any candidate, or qualified 
political party directly interested, or any thirty voters of any 
election district” based on grounds that could cause a 
difference in the election results. With this, the legislature 
expressed its intent to limit who may file election contests. 
It follows that a candidate for an elective public office only 
has standing to file a complaint under HRS § 11-172 to challenge the election results in the election where that candidate 
appears on the ballot. A construction of the statute in this 
manner would give effect to the language in HRS § 11-172 that 
requires a plaintiff to have a direct interest in the election 
to file an election contest in the supreme court. See State v.
Plichta
, 116 Hawaiʻi 200, 213, 172 P.3d 512, 525 (2007) (noting 
that for statutory interpretation “our sole duty is to give 
effect to the statute’s plain and obvious meaning”). 
Here, Defendants conceded that Plaintiff is a nonpartisan 
candidate for Mayor in Honolulu. 
Applying HRS § 11-172, we hold 
that Plaintiff has standing to file a complaint only as to this 
5  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
race — where he appears as a candidate — and may not challenge 
the primary ballots for all statewide races. 
We turn now to the question of whether Plaintiff’s 
complaint states a claim under HRS § 11-172 with respect to the 
City and County of Honolulu race for Mayor. 
To state a claim under HRS § 11-172, the election contest 
complaint, at the bare minimum, must plead that the conduct in 
question by the election official could cause a difference in the election results. 
Defendants argued that because Plaintiff is on the 
nonpartisan county ballot, that none of the provisions cited by 
Plaintiff as having been violated are applicable. In this way, 
Defendants argued that Plaintiff’s challenge to the instructions 
on the primary ballot, even if true, could not cause a 
difference in the nonpartisan race. 
We agree with Defendants. Here, the complaint fails to state a claim under HRS § 11-
172. The ballot attached to Plaintiff’s complaint plainly 
states that the voter is eligible to vote for all county 
contests. As such, even if the allegations in the complaint 
were true, the purported defect on the voter instructions would 
have no impact on Plaintiff’s nonpartisan race. 
Based on the foregoing, the complaint’s claims made under 
HRS § 11-172 are dismissed for failure to state a claim.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
C. Mandamus relief is not appropriate 
Plaintiff cited HRS § 602-5 to support his request for an 
order directing Defendants to design the ballots in accordance 
with Plaintiff’s belief as to how the law should apply. 
Plaintiff is self-represented. A fundamental tenet of 
Hawaiʻi law is that filings by self-represented parties are 
construed liberally. See Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawaiʻ i 368, 391, 
465 P.3d 815, 838 (2020). 
Under a liberal construction, 
Plaintiff’s claims could be construed as a petition for a writ of mandamus directed to a public officer. 
This court has discretion to entertain applications for 
“writs of mandamus directed to public officers to compel them to 
fulfill the duties of their offices[.]” HRS § 602-5(a)(3). 
“Writs are rare.” Rivera v. Cataldo
, 153 Hawaiʻi 320, 324, 537 
P.3d 1167, 1171 (2023). In the ordinary case, a writ will not 
issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and 
indisputable right to the relief requested and a lack of other 
means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or to obtain the requested action. 
See Womble Bond Dickinson (US) LLP v. Kim
, 
153 Hawaiʻi 307, 319, 537 P.3d 1154, 1166 (2023); 
see also
Barnett v. Broderick
, 84 Hawaiʻi 109, 111, 929 P.2d 1359, 1361 
(1996) (similar). 
Plaintiff’s complaint failed to meet this high standard.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
1. Plaintiff’s complaint failed to establish a clear 
and indisputable right to the relief requested 
To recap, Plaintiff’s complaint asserted that the primary 
election ballots conflict with the Hawaiʻ i Constitution, article 
II, section 4 because the instructions require a voter to select 
one political preference for the vote to count. 
Article II, section 4 of the Hawaiʻi Constitution, 
“Registration; Voting,” provides: 
The legislature shall provide for the registration of 
voters and for absentee voting and shall prescribe the 
method of voting at all elections. Secrecy of voting shall 
be preserved; provided that no person shall be required to declare a party preference or nonpartisanship as a 
condition of voting in any primary or special primary 
election. Secrecy of voting and choice of political party 
affiliation or nonpartisanship shall be preserved. 
Defendants countered that the ballot conforms to the law. 
Defendants focused their arguments on the statutes, and did not 
address, in detail, the constitutional issue presented. 
Upon review, we find that Plaintiff failed to establish a 
clear and indisputable right to the relief requested. 
The constitutional history for article II, section 4 of the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution,  as detailed in Democratic Party of Hawaii 
v. Nago, 982 F. Supp. 2d 1166, 1169-71 (D. Haw. 2013), aff’d,833 F.3d 1119 (9th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 581 U.S. 972 2
“In order to give effect to the intention of the framers and the people 
adopting a constitutional provision, an examination of the debates, 
proceedings and committee reports is useful.” State v. Kahlbaun, 64 Haw. 
197, 204, 638 P.2d 309, 316 (1981). 
8 2  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(2017), belies Plaintiff’s claim that the primary election 
ballot suffers from a constitutional infirmity. 
The prohibition on declaring a party preference in article 
II, section 4 of the Hawaiʻi Constitution was meant to change the 
elections in Hawaiʻ i from a closed primary system to an open 
primary. See Democratic Party
, 982 F. Supp. 2d at 1169-71. 
Under the closed primary system, a voter had to both 
register with the party and identify his registered party to the 
precinct official in order to vote, which information was also 
recorded with the county clerk. Id.In an open primary, a 
person may vote without having to register with a party beforehand or declare a party preference to the precinct 
official; provided, a voter may only vote for the party’s 
nominees for all offices in a single party. Id.In short, a 
voter in an open primary is required to vote only for candidates 
of one political persuasion. Id.
Likewise, Plaintiff’s claims grounded in HRS §§ 12-21, 12-
31, and 12-42 are without merit. First, it appears Plaintiff is 
claiming that the primary ballot fails to comply with the 
provision in HRS § 12-21 that states “[t]he name of each party 
and the nonpartisan designation shall be distinctly printed and 
sufficiently separate from each other.” Yet the ballot attached 
to Plaintiff’s complaint appears to do just that by identifying 
9  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and separating the candidates in the respective races by party 
and nonpartisan designations. 
Next, as to HRS § 12-31, it appears Plaintiff is claiming 
that the primary ballot violates that statute by requiring a 
person to identify a party preference before voting. 
As 
discussed above related to article II, section 4 of the Hawaiʻi 
Constitution, Plaintiff’s reading of the law is incorrect. See
also
 1979 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 139, §§ 1, 9 at 313, 317 (amending 
HRS § 12-31, in pertinent part, to implement article II, section 
4 of the Hawaiʻi Constitution, and eliminate the requirement that 
a voter “state his party preference or nonpartisanship to the 
precinct officials” in order to vote). Further, HRS § 12-31 
expressly provides that in a primary election “[a] voter shall 
be entitled to vote only for candidates of one party or only for nonpartisan candidates.” 
Finally, as to HRS § 12-42, the complaint claims that the 
ballot violates that statute because unopposed candidates should 
not be on primary ballots. 
Defendants countered that HRS § 12-
42 only applies to special elections and because the upcoming election is a primary election, HRS § 12-42 does not apply. 
Here, a review of the plain language of HRS § 12-42 confirms 
that it only applies to a special election; not the subject 
primary election.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
For the reasons stated, Plaintiff has failed to establish a 
clear and indisputable right to the relief requested. 
2. Plaintiff failed to establish a lack of other 
means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or 
to obtain the requested action 
Defendants’ motion to dismiss argued that laches should bar 
the complaint, and noted that Plaintiff had participated in, or 
was aware of litigation regarding the design of the primary 
election ballots in 2022. While the Defendants’ motion to dismiss is silent on the alternative means that may be available 
to Plaintiff to pursue a challenge to the design of the primary 
election ballots, the burden is on Plaintiff — not the 
Defendants — to establish a lack of other means to redress his 
grievance. 
Plaintiff failed to assert that he lacks alternative means 
to obtain the relief requested by his petition. Yet it appears 
the Plaintiff, in the first instance, could raise his grievance 
with the elections commission. The legislature established the elections commission, see HRS § 11-7(a) (2009), with duties, 
among other things, to “[i]nvestigate and hold hearings for 
receiving evidence of any violations and complaints.” HRS § 11-
7.5(2) (Supp. 2015). The administrative rules implementing this 
statute provide that an appropriate subject for a complaint to 
the elections commission concerning an administrative act of the 
11  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
office of elections might be that the act is contrary to law. 
See
 Hawaiʻi Administrative Rules § 3-170-6 (eff. 2008). 
Here, the burden was on Plaintiff to establish a lack of 
other means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or to obtain 
the requested action related to his ballot grievance. See
Womble
, 153 Hawaiʻi at 319, 537 P.3d at 1166.  We find that 
Plaintiff’s complaint failed to meet this burden. 
III. 
Conclusion Defendants’ motion to dismiss is granted in part. 
Plaintiff’s election contest claims are all dismissed for failure to state a claim. 
To the extent the court has liberally construed the 
complaint as a petition seeking a writ of mandamus directed to a 
public officer, the petition is denied. See
 Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Appellate Procedure, Rule 21(c) (“If the court is of the opinion 
that the writ should not be entertained, it shall deny the 
petition.”). 
Judgment is entered in favor of Defendants and against 
Plaintiff.
