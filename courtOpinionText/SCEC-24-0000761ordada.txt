IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻI 
KARL ORLANDO DICKS and EMIL SVRCINA, Plaintiffs, 
 
vs. 
 
STATE OF HAWAIʻI OFFICE OF ELECTIONS and SCOTT NAGO, Defendants. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
ORDER DISMISSING ELECTION COMPLAINT 
AND DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Eddins,  Ginoza, and Devens,  JJ.)  
On November 8, 2024, an Election Complaint (Complaint) was 
filed by Plaintiffs Karl Orlando Dicks and Emil Svrcina 
(collectively, Plaintiffs), which we construe as a general election contest and petition for writ of mandamus. As a general election contest, we find and conclude that Plaintiffs’ Complaint does not challenge the election results of any race in the 2024 general election. 
A general election complaint, at minimum, must plead that 
the conduct in question by an election official could cause a  
 
       
       
 difference in the election results of a race in the 2024 general 
election. SeeHawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 11-172 (Supp. 
2021).  Plaintiffs’ Complaint does not state a claim under HRS 
§ 11-172. The Complaint instead seeks a declaration that early 
voting, mail-in voting, and Act 136 of the 2019 Hawaiʻ i Session 
Laws are unconstitutional or illegal. 
Moreover, a petition for writ of mandamus is not intended 
to be used in lieu of normal court procedures, including normal 
appellate procedures, that could be (and could have been) used to address Plaintiffs’ questions of law concerning an Act that 
has been effective since 2019 and related election procedures. 
See Womble Bond Dickinson (US) LLP v. Kim, 153 Hawaiʻ i 307, 319, 
537 P.3d 1154, 1166 (2023); see also HRS § 632-1 (2016). 
It is ordered that the general election complaint is 
dismissed for failure to state a claim and the petition for writ 
of mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai i, December 2, 2024.
