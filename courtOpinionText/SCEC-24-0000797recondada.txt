ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Eddins, Ginoza, and Devens, JJ.) 
On December 29, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an “Opposition to 
Judgment Pursuant to Constitution of the State of Hawaii, 
Article I Section I” and a “Layman Executive Summary.” The deadline to timely file a motion for reconsideration from this court’s December 20, 2024 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, 
and Judgment was December 30, 2024. See
 Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40(a) (eff. 2000). We construe 
both documents filed on December 29, 2024, collectively as a motion for reconsideration.     
 
       
       
 Upon consideration of the motion for reconsideration filed 
on December 29, 2024, and the record, this court has not 
overlooked or misapprehended points of law or fact. See HRAP 
Rule 40(b). 
It is ordered that the motion is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, January 7, 2025.
