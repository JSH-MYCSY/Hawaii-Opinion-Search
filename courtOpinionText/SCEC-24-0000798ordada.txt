Defendants. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, AND JUDGMENT 
(By: Recktenwald, C.  J., McKenna, E  ddins, Ginoza, and Devens,  JJ.)  
Upon consideration of the election complaint filed on 
November 25, 2024, the motion to dismiss filed on December 10, 
2024, and the record, we rule in favor of Defendants and against 
Plaintiff as to all claims stated in the complaint. 
In accordance with Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 11-174.5 
(2009 & Supp. 2023), we enter the following findings of fact, 
conclusions of law, and judgment.   
 
  
    
    
 
 
  
 
 
  
 FINDINGS OF FACT 
The 2024 general election was held on November 5, 2024. 
Plaintiff Michael H. Jauch (Jauch) was an unsuccessful 
Republican candidate for State Representative, District 17. The 
general election result for this office shows that Jauch lost by 
3,812 votes: 
(D) MORIKAWA, Daynette (Dee) 
(R) JAUCH, Michael H. 
Blank Votes: 6,450 
2,638 
1,010 63.8% 
26.1% 
10.0% 
Over Votes: 5 0.0% 
On November 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed the election contest 
with this court and thereby challenged the election result for 
the office of State Representative, District 17. Plaintiff did 
not name the chief election officer as a defendant. 
On December 10, 2024, defendants Jade Tanigawa and Lyndon 
Yoshioka (together, County Clerk) filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint, or in the alternative, for summary 
judgment. 
Plaintiff did not file a response to Defendants’ motion. 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
An election contest is instituted by filing a complaint in 
the supreme court “set[ting] forth any cause or causes, such as but not limited to, provable fraud, overages, or underages, that 
could cause a difference in the election results.” HRS § 11-172 
(Supp. 2023).

 To prevail on an election complaint seeking to invalidate a 
general election, the plaintiff must establish “that a correct 
result cannot be ascertained because of a mistake or fraud on 
the part of the voter service center officials[.]” HRS § 11-
174.5; see also Waters v. Nago
, 148 Hawaiʻi 46, 65, 468 P.3d 60, 
79 (2019) (invalidating the special election where the correct 
result could not be determined because invalidly received 
ballots were commingled with the other ballots). 
At the outset, Plaintiff’s complaint is procedurally 
defective because it does not name and was not delivered to the 
chief election officer. See
 HRS § 11-172 (“A copy of the 
complaint shall be delivered to the chief election officer or 
the clerk in the case of county elections.”). 
Nonetheless, we review Plaintiff’s complaint on the merits 
and determine that Plaintiff failed to meet his burden to 
establish any irregularities such that the correct result of the 
election cannot be ascertained. HRS § 11-174.5. 
Plaintiff appears to present, in pertinent part, three 
claims. First, Plaintiff contends that the County Clerk does not maintain a complete count of marksense ballots. Second, 
Plaintiff claims that the County Clerk improperly reviewed 
return identification envelopes on several days without 
“Signature Verification Observ[ers].” Third, Plaintiff appears 
to claim that, according to an election commissioner who was 
3   present at a counting center on October 26, 2024, the number of 
ballots counted by the State was different from the number of 
ballots indicated in the Kauaʻi County’s chain-of-custody 
documentation. Plaintiff appears to contend that based on the foregoing, it is clear the Kauaʻ i County Clerk’s office is not 
acting in good faith to follow the laws required to safeguard 
the election process, and that willful and intentional maladministration, misadministration, and misfeasance occurred, 
rendering the election null and void. 
Plaintiff neither claims nor submits any evidence 
demonstrating that any of the foregoing alleged actions or 
irregularities would have had the effect of overcoming the 
margin by which the State House District 17 election was 
decided. 
On this record, Plaintiff failed to establish that the 
correct result of the election cannot be ascertained because of 
a mistake or fraud on the part of the County Clerk. See HRS 
§ 11-174.5. Accordingly, the court rules in favor of the County Clerk and against Plaintiff as to all claims in the complaint. 
The court issues this decision based on the record before 
the court. SeeHRS § 11-174.5(b) (providing “the court shall 
cause the evidence to be reduced to writing and shall give judgment, stating all findings of fact and of law”). 
Accordingly, the motion pending before the court is denied as moot.

 JUDGMENT 
Based on the above findings of fact and conclusions of law, 
judgment is entered in favor of the County Clerk, and against 
Plaintiff.
