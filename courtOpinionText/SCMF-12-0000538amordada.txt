BAR EXAM IN LIGHT OF COVID-19
 (By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, and McKenna, JJ., and
Intermediate Court of Appeals Chief Judge Ginoza, assigned
by reason of vacancy, with Wilson, J., 
concurring and dissenting separately) 
On July 22, 2020, this court entered an Order Regarding
the September 2020 Bar Exam in Light of COVID-19.  The order
afforded applicants who were granted permission to sit for the
Hawai#i Bar Exam, scheduled for September 9 and 10, 2020 at the
Hawai#i Convention Center, an opportunity to elect one of the
following options:
(1) sit for the bar exam as scheduled;
(2) defer sitting for the exam until a later date,
without being required to pay an additional application fee; or
(3) defer sitting for the exam while pursuing aprovisional license, subject to meeting certain requirements as
set forth in that order, without being required to pay an
additional application fee, and including an expiration of the
provisional license on July 1, 2022.
Applicants were ordered to inform the Board of
Examiners’ staff by July 28, 2020 of their option.  
NOW, THEREFORE, in light of the continuing increase in
COVID-19 cases on O #ahu, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that for those applicants who
chose to sit for the exam, the deadline to defer taking the exam
or to pursue a provisional license is extended to the end of the
first day of the September 2020 examination.  Applicants may
inform the Board of Examiners’ staff by electronic mail to
baradmissions@courts.hawaii.gov.
At present, the approximately 120 applicants who have
elected to take the written exam using their laptops will be
seated in a 59,000 square-foot exhibition hall.  Each applicant
will be seated alone at an eight-foot table, with at least ten
feet between each table.
2Numerous safety precautions are being taken as
reflected in the attached instructions (Attachment 1), which were
provided to all applicants no later than August 5, 2020.  As
indicated in the attachment, everyone will be required to wear a
face covering. Face masks with one-way valves, bandannas, and
neck fleeces such as balaclavas and neck gaiters are prohibited.
