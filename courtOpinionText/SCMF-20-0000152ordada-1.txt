IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI ʻI   
                                                                  
 
In the Matter of the Judiciary’s Response
to the COVID-19 Outbreak  
                                                                  
 
ORDER FURTHER EXTENDING JUNE 5, 2020 ORDER TEMPORARILY 
SUSPENDING IN PART HAWAI ʻI RULES OF PENAL PROCEDURE RULE 6(a) 
(CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT) 
(By:
 Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
 
  On March 4, 2020, Governor David Ige declared a state 
of emergency in 
Hawaiʻi in response to the public health threat 
posed by COVID-19.  In response to the declared state of 
emergency, the Chief Justice issued an Order on March 16, 2020,
 
which, among other things, postponed non-urgent court business 
in an effort to ensure the health and safety of court personnel 
and users, and minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19 in the 
courts.   
Pursuant to the Chief Justice’s May 22, 2020 Order 
Regarding Jury Trial and Grand Juries, beginning June 1, 2020, 
grand jury proceedings were allowed to commence as directed by Electronically Filed
Supreme Court

 the chief judge of the respective circuit.  At that time, based 
on recommended health and safety guidelines that physical 
distancing be maintained, and with limited resources, the First 
Circuit Court did not have the capacity in Ka ‘ahuma
nu Hale to 
place 16 grand jurors as required under Hawai ʻi Rules of Penal 
Procedure Rule 6(a), as well as the individuals required to be 
present while the grand jury is in session as set forth under 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 6(d), in the same space and 
allow for physical distancing.   
Therefore, to protect the health and safety of 
Judiciary personnel, jurors, and court users consistent with the 
recommendations of public health authorities, while maintaining 
court operations during the COVID-19 pandemic without 
unnecessary delay, on June 5, 2020, this court issued its “Order 
Temporarily Suspending in Part Hawai ‘i Rules of Penal Procedure 
Rule 6(a)”, which, as to the First Circuit, temporarily reduced 
the number of members of a grand jury from 16 members to 12 
members through July 31, 2020.  As the positivity rate of COVID-
19 cases increased, and the ongoing health concerns and the 
continued mandate for physical distancing remained in place, it 
was necessary to extend the June 5, 2020 order.  Currently, the 
June 5, 2020 order expires on June 30, 2021. 
The First Circuit Court has taken significant steps to 
be able to allow grand jury proceedings to resume with 12-member 3

 grand jury panels and in compliance with physical distancing 
measures.  Given the current emergency orders and health and 
safety guidelines in place, and the continued mandate for 
physical distancing, it is necessary for the 12-member grand 
jury panels to remain in effect to allow the First Circuit Court 
to continue to hold grand jury proceedings.    
Therefore, pursuant to Article VI, section 7 of the 
Hawaiʻi Constitut
ion and Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes §§ 602-5(a)(6) 
and 612-27, 
  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the June 5, 2020 “Order 
Temporarily Suspending in Part Hawai ‘i Rules of Penal Procedure 
Rule 6(a)” is further extended until December 31, 2021.  This 
order may be modified or extended as necessary.           
  Dated:  Honolulu, Hawai ʻi, June 24, 2021.
