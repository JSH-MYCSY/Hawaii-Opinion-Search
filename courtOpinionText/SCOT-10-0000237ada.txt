ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba and Duffy, JJ.
and Circuit Judge Chang, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon review of the complaints filed in the supreme 
court by complainant Janice K. M. Chung Keli
'ihananui, it appears 
that we lack jurisdiction to consider complainant’s claims of 
cruel and unusual punishment. See HRS § 602-5 (Supp. 2009). 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the complaints are dismissed.
 DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 10, 2011.
