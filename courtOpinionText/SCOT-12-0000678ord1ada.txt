ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
On September 10, 2012, plaintiff Arwin R. Echineque
 
filed a complaint in this court. This court, however, lacks
 
jurisdiction to consider the complaint. See HRS ยง 602-5 (Supp.
 
2011). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the complaint is dismissed. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate 
court shall not accept any further filings in this case. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, September 26, 2012.
