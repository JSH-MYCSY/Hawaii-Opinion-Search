Upon review of the document entitled “Complaint”, which
 
was mailed to the supreme court by William Oyadomari, and filed
 
on December 2, 2013, it appears that we lack jurisdiction to
 consider the complaint. See HRS § 602-5 (Supp. 2012). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the complaint is dismissed.
