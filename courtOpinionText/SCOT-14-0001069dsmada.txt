ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of (1) Plaintiffs’ Complaint, filed
 
on August 21, 2014, (2) Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint,
 
filed on August 22, 2014, (3) Defendants Governor Neil
 
Abercrombie, Attorney General David Louie, and Chief Election
 
Officer Scott Nago’s Motion to Dismiss, filed on August 25, 2014,
 
(4) Defendant County of Hawai' i County Clerk Stewart Maeda’s 
Motion to Dismiss, filed on August 25, 2014, (5) Plaintiffs’ Memorandum in Opposition to the Motions to Dismiss and Motion for 
Permanent Injunctive Relief, filed on August 25, 2014, and the 
record herein, we find as follows:      In the Complaint and First Amended Complaint,
 
Plaintiffs ask the court to: (1) issue a declaratory judgment
 
that HRS § 11-92.3 is unconstitutional; (2) issue a declaratory
 
judgment that Defendants’ actions in response to
 
Hurricane/Tropical Storm Iselle infringed upon Plaintiffs’ right
 
to vote; (3) require Defendants to allow Plaintiffs and any other
 
registered voter who did not cast a vote due to the storm to vote
 
no later than September 20, 2014, and to notify the voters in the
 
most effective methods of the new election date; (4) enjoin
 
Defendants from certifying the primary election results or, in
 
the alternative, rescind any certification of the primary
 
election results; and (5) award reasonable attorneys’ fees and
 
costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and other applicable laws. 
Plaintiffs concede that their complaint is “not a
 
typical ‘election contest’” within the meaning of HRS §§ 11-172
 
(2009) or 11-173.5 (2009) and that they do not meet the statutory
 
requirements for an election contest. Further, the court does
 
not have jurisdiction under the statutory and constitutional 
provisions cited in the Complaint and First Amended Complaint to
 
grant the relief requested. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motions to dismiss are
 
granted. The complaint and first amended complaint are
 
dismissed.
