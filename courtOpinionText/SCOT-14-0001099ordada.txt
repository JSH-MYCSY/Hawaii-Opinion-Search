Petitioners/Plaintiffs,

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV. NO. 12-1-0051(2))
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the documents submitted by Tom I.
 
Galinato and Merlee S. Galinato, which were filed as a complaint
 
on September 4, 2014, it appears that, based upon the information
 
provided in the documents, this court does not have jurisdiction
 
to provide Plaintiffs the relief they request. See HRS ยง 602-5
 
(Supp. 2013). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the complaint is dismissed.
