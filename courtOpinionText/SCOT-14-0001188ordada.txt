PHILIP L. THORP, Plaintiff,
 
vs.
 
STATE OF HAWAII, DEPARTMENT OF ACCOUNTING AND GENERAL
SERVICES, AUTOMOTIVE MANAGEMENT DIVISION, Defendant.
 
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV.
 NO. 1RC14-1-6843)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the document submitted by Philip L.
 
Thorp entitled, “Letter of Complaint,” which was filed as a
 
complaint letter on October 17, 2014, it appears that, under the
 facts and circumstances of this matter, this court does not have
 jurisdiction to provide relief sought by way of the instant
 complaint letter. See HRS § 602-5 (Supp. 2013). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the complaint letter without payment of the
 filing fee.
  IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the complaint letter
 
is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, November 3, 2014.
