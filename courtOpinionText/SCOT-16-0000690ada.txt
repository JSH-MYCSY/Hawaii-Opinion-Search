2 (continued . . .)    This is a  direct appeal3 from a special permit 
application proceeding before Appellee Leeward Planning 
Commission  (“LPC”) and Appellee Planning Director (“Planning 
Director”) of the County of Hawaiʻi (collectively, “Appellees”) 
by Appellant The Community Associations of Hualalai 
(“Hualalai”), a group of Hawaiʻi County community associations .  
See HRS §§ 205-19 (2017) and 91 -14 (2017).  The special permit 
application requested approval  to use an agricultural parcel of 
land as an equipment base yard and security dwelling, and for 
stockpiling and crushing natural materials for commercial use .  
We find Appellees wrongfully denied Hualalai a hearing  and 
decision on its petition to intervene  as a party to contest the 
special permit application , and remand to the LPC for 
proceedings consistent with this opinion .   
I. BACKGROUND 
A. Bolton’s Permit Application  and Appellant/Hualalai’s 
Petition to Intervene  
On February 4, 2000, the Hawaiʻi County Planning 
Commission4 issued Special Permit No. 1047 to Nani Kona Coffee 
                     
3  In 2016, the legislature adopted Act 48 “to provide for the 
expedited judicial review of certain contested case proceedings.”  Conf. 
Comm. Rep. No. 67 -16, in 2016 House Journal, at 136 3, 2016 Senate Journal, at 
789.  Under Act 48, aggrieved parties may appeal from a final decision or 
order in certain administrative proceedings directly to the supreme court.  
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (“HRS”) §  205-19 (2017 ). 
 
4 At the time, the County of Hawaiʻi had one planning commission for 
the whole county.  In 2008, the County Council passed, and the voter s

(continued . . .)  LLC granting construction of a “coffee visitor center” and 
related improvements on a parcel of approximately 7.33 acres of 
land “located on the southeast corner of the Hawaii  Belt Road 
and Hualalai Road intersection” within the state and county 
agricultural land use districts.   Approval was granted pursuant 
to the Planning Commission’s authority under HRS §  205-6 to 
issue special permits.   Approval of Special Permit No. 1047 w as 
subject to conditions :  Condition No. 4 required that the 
“coffee visitor center and all related improvements” be 
established within five years from the effective date of the 
permit, and Condition No. 9 required the applicant to submit a 
drainage study to the Department of Public Works and complete 
all improvements required to mitigate flooding before the 
issuance of any building permits .  Nani Kona Coffee LLC was 
subsequently granted two administrative time extension s to 
comply with Condition No. 4 :  one in September 2004  until 
February 2007, and one in 2007 until February 2010.     
  Some years later, i n 2015 and 2016, Bolton, Inc. 
(“Bolton”)5 applied for a grading permit (Permit No. 092524) and 
                     
(. . . continued)  
 
approved, an ordinance dividing the commission into the windward and leeward 
planning commissions, effective April 1, 2009.  Ord. No. 08 -01 (2008).  
 
5  The record indicates that Daniel B. Bolton of Kona Coffee & Tea 
Company was one of Nani Kona Coffee LLC’s points of contact regarding Special 
Permit 1047 and communicated wi th the Planning Department between July 1998

4  two stockpiling permits (Permit Nos. 092525 and 092529) to  
complete the “Kona Coffee & Tea Co. Flood Channel Project” on 
two parcels of land on “Hualalai R[oa]d [m]auka of Queen 
K[aʻahumanu Highway].”  The first parcel, identified by Tax Map 
Key (“TMK”) number 7 -5-17:31 (“Parcel 31”), is the parcel for 
which Spec ial Permit No. 1047 was issued in 2000;6 the second 
parcel, identified by TMK number 7 -5-17:44 (“Parcel 44”), is 
adjacent to and immediately east/mauka of Parcel 31.  The two 
parcels are owned by Daniel B. Bolton and Janet T. Bolton of 
Bolton, Inc.  Bolton ’s applications for grading and stockpiling 
on the two parcels were approved  in January 2016  by the Hawaiʻi 
County Planning Department and the Department of Public Works, 
with approval of the grading permit conditioned on compliance 
with Condition No. 9 of Special Permit No. 1047.   
  Approximately  one month  after approval of the  grading 
and stockpiling permi ts, on February 19, 2016, Appellee/ Planning 
                     
(. . . continued) 
 
and August 2004, both in his individual capacity and in an organizational 
capacity as Bolton, Inc.   
 
6 The record from 2000 identifies the parcel for which Special 
Permit No. 1047 was issued by TMK number “7 -5-17:33[.]”  However, the parcel 
is described as being at the location of the current Parcel 31, and elsewhere 
in the record, Special Permit No. 1047 is described as having been issued for 
Parcel 31.  This discrepancy is not explained in the record, althou gh there 
are indications that there was a “[c]orrection of TMK number” in 2001 and 
that “Parcel 44 was subdivided from [Parcel] 31” at some point in time.

quarry on the parcels and us ing the parcels as an equipment base 
yard without an applicable special permit.  A subsequent 
investigation revealed that Bolton appeared to  be operating a 
rock crusher for commercial purposes (i.e., operating a quarry) 
on Parcel 44, storing construction e quipment on the parcels 
(i.e., using the properties as a construction base yard), and 
maintaining  a junk yard on the parcels.  The letter warned 
Bolton that those activities potentially violated  the Zoning 
Code,8 and requested a response from Bolton by Apr il 30, 2016.  
The letter stated that if Bolton wanted to conduct a commercial 
quarry operation, it could “submit an application for a special 
permit that would allow for the creation of a (Quarry) and would

determine[s] appeals from final decisions of the planning director or the 
director of public works regarding matters within their respective 
jurisdictions.”  CCH §  6-9.2(a) (2018).  
 
8  Under state law and Chapter 25 of the HCC (“Zoning Code”), land 
within the state agricultural land use district is restr icted to certain 
permitted uses.  See HRS § 205-4.5(a) (2017); HCC §  25-5-72(a).

unauthorized activity.9   
  On March 1, 2016, Bolton submitted an application 
(“Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188”) to the Planning 
Department, requesting a special permit to use Parcel 44 for 
“[a] baseyard/staging yard for equipment, storage of materials, 
stockpiling and crushing of natural materials for commercial 
use” and a “[s]ecurity dwelling[.]”  Bolton stated that Special 
Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 was intended to  resolve the 
issues raised in the February 19 warning letter and to bring 
Parcel 44 into compliance with the Zoning Code.   
On April 12, 2016, Bolton sent a letter to the 
Planning Department disputing that it had violated the Zoning 
Code, as suggested in t he February 19 warning letter, but 
                     
9 Regarding rock crushing or quarrying activity, the Zoning Code 
provides:  
 
(c)  The following uses may be permitted in the [county

9 LPC’s May 19 meeting gave public notice that Special Permit 
Application No. SPP -16-188 would be considered as Agenda Item 
No. 4.  The agenda explained how a party could seek to 
intervene: 
Pursuant to Rule 4, Contested Case Procedure, of the County 
of Hawaiʻi Planning Commission Rules of Practice and 
Procedure, any person seeking to intervene as a party to a 
contested case hearing on the above Agenda Items Nos. 1 
through 4 is required to file a written request which must 
be received in the office of the Plan ning Department no 
later than seven (7) calendar days prior to the Planning 
Commission’s first public meeting on the matter.  Such 
written request shall be in conformity with Rule 4, in a 
form as provided by the Planning Department entitled 
“Petition for S tanding in a Contested Case Hearing.”  
The agenda referenced County of Hawaiʻi Planning Commission Rules 
of Practice and Procedure (“LPC Rules”)  Rule 4 (2017), which 
allows a person to request to formally intervene and be admitted 
as a party to the proceeding.  LPC Rule 4 -6 provides , in 
relevant part :

respective jurisdictions, other than those involving the 
general plan.  
 
CCH § 6-7.5 (2018).  The LPC has adopted and is subject to “[a] uniform body 
of rules of practice and procedure[.]”  CCH §  6-7.5(b).   
 
11  The LPC presides over special permit applications and proceedings 
because it has the authority to “ permit certain unu sual and reasonable uses 
within [the] agricultural  . . . district[] other than those for which the 
district is classified.”  HRS §  205-6(a) (2017).  A party wishing to engage 
in such use, such as Bolton, “may petition the planning commission  . . . for 
permission to use the person’s land in the manner desired” by applying for 
and obtaining a special permit from the planning commission pursuant to HRS 
§ 205-6 before engaging in the “unusual” use.  Id.; HCC § 25-5-72(c).  
Regarding the special permit applicati on process, the county planning 
commission must “establish by rule or regulation, the time within which the 
hearing and action on petition for special permit shall occur[,]” HRS §  205-
6(b), and may permit the desired use by a majority vote of the commissio n’s 
members, HRS §  205-6(c).   
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
10 (a)  In all proceedings where  the Commission’s action is 
directly appealable to Third Circuit Court, the applicant 
and the Planning Director will be designated parties to the 
action.  Any other person seeking to intervene as a party 
shall file a written request on a form approved by t he 
Planning Director and accompanied by a filing fee of $200 
no later than seven calendar days, prior to the 
Commission’s first meeting on the matter.  If the applicant 
files a request with the Commission for the deferral or 
continuance of the hearing prio r to the commencement of the 
hearing, the next regularly scheduled meeting of the 
Commission will then be considered the subsequent 
rescheduled hearing date.  If the request for intervention 
is withdrawn in writing before the commencement of the 
hearing, t he filing fee shall be refunded to the person 
seeking standing to intervene.   
 
(b)  Upon receipt of a written request to intervene, the 
Commission, at the first meeting on the matter, shall hold 
a hearing on the written request.  The petitioner shall be 
admitted as a party if it can demonstrate that:  
 
(1)  His or her interest is clearly distinguishable 
from that of the general public; or  
 
(2)  Government agencies whose jurisdiction includes 
the land involved in the subject request; or  
 
(3)  That they have some property interest in the 
land or lawfully reside on the land; or  
 
(4)  That even though they do not have an interest 
different than the public generally, that the 
proposed action will cause them actual or threatened 
injury in fact; or  
 
(5)  Persons who are descendants of native Hawaiians 
who inhabited the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778, who 
practice those rights which are customarily and 
traditionally exercised for subsistence, cultural or 
religious purposes.  
 
The Commission will grant or deny such written request 
prior to any further action on the matter.  
 
(c)  Appeal from Denial.  Any petitioner who has been 
denied standing as a party may appeal such denial to the 
Third Circuit Court pursuant to Section 91 -14, Hawaiʻi 
Revised Statutes.  
 
(d)  After establishing the parties to the proceeding, the 
Commission may either proceed with the hearing, or continue 
the matter to a more appropriate time and date.  
LPC Rule 4 -6.

11 (continued . . .)  On May 9, 2016 the Planning Department issued a 
background report on Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188, 
in which it noted  that Special Permit No. 1047 had been approved 
for Parcel 31 in 2000, that Bolton had received an extension 
until 2010 to comply with Condition No. 9, and that “[a]ny 
additional  time extensions to comply with conditions will need 
to be approved by the [LPC].”  Th at same day, the Planning 
Department also issued a recommendation to the LPC in which the 
Planning Director recommended that the LPC approve Bolton’s 
Special Permit Appli cation No. SPP -16-188, with the caveat  that 
“[s]ince this recommendation is made without the benefit of 
public testimony, the Director reserves the right to modify 
and/or alter this position based upon additional information 
presented at the public hearing .”12 
  On May 12, 2016, a week before the LPC’s scheduled 
public meeting on Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188, 
Appellant/ Hualalai  submitted a “Petition for Standing in a 
Contested Case Hearing”  (hereinafter “petition to intervene” or 
“petition”)13 and paid the associated $200 .00 filing fee.  
                     
12  Although the Planning Department’s background report and 
recommendation are not contiguous in the record, they appear to have been 
filed or published together as they are formatted identically and the first 
page of both doc uments are marked with “ RBolton-SPP16-188.jwd 05 -09-16” in 
the upper righthand corner.   
 
13  Hualalai submitted its petition alongside a LPC form titled, 
“Petition for Standing in a Contested Case Hearing.”   The form’s language  
  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
12 Hualalai  noted in it s petition  that it was “a non -profit 
association consisting of four community associations that 
represent [ed] and act[ed] for the interest of owners of 
residences and residential lots in four s ubdivisions” located 
near Hualalai Road in North Kona, Hawaiʻi County, as well as a  
limited liability company  (“LLC”) with “interest in the 
ownership and use of residential properties” in the same area.  
Hualalai “act [ed] in a representative capacity” for the four 
community associations and their members, and the L LC.  Hualalai 
was formally organized on May 11, 2016.  In its petition, 
Hualalai identified a number of ways in which its interests were 
“clearly distinguishable from that of the general public,” and 
would be affected if  the LPC granted  Special Permit Appl ication 
No. SPP-16-188.  Hualalai stated that it represented property 
owners who owned residential properties in the near vicinity of 
Parcel 44, enjoyed the protections of the County General Plan 
and the Kona Community Development Plan, and faced individua l 
injuries and threatened injuries to their properties from the 
noise, dust, negative aesthetic effects, negative effects on 
                     
(. . . continued) 
 
tracks LPC Rule 4 -6(b), wh ich outlines the criteria for establishing standing 
to intervene in a contested case.  To avoid confusion, Hualalai’s petition 
will be referred to as a “petition to intervene” rather than a “petition for 
standing.”   
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
13 nearby neighborhoods, diminished property values, and increased 
traffic from the proposed development.   
  On May 19, 2016, Bolton requested a continuance of the 
hearing scheduled for later that day.  During the LPC meeting  
that day , the LPC’s chair announced that, at Bolton’s request, 
the LPC would postpone the hearing on Special Permit Application 
No. SPP-16-188 until a future meeti ng.  The chair announced that 
“there would be no presentation by staff, the applicant, or the 
petitioner for a contested case hearing,” but that the LPC would 
permit oral testimony from members of the public.  The LPC heard 
testimony from members of the pu blic, including residents of the 
subdivisions whose community associations comprise Hualalai, an 
attorney representing Hualalai, and the president of Hualalai.  
These individuals testified that the noise, dust, traffic, and 
vibrations caused by Bolton’s pr oposed activity would negatively 
affect their health, quality of life, and property values.  The 
LPC received additional written testimony from individuals 
opposed to  Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 for the 
same reasons.  
  On May 23, 2016, Bolton  was notified that Special 
Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 had been rescheduled , per its 
request,  for a public hearing on June 16, 2016.  That same day, 
the Planning Director notified Hualalai that its petition to 
intervene had been received and would be  forwarded to the LPC  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
14 for their review.  The Planning Director informed Hualalai that 
its presence was required at the upcoming June 16 hearing to 
answer questions from the LPC on its petition.  
  On June 1, 2016, Bolton requested another postponement 
of the hearing for Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 
until further notice.  On June 7, 2016, the Planning Director 
notified Bolton that he would “defer the application” until 
Bolton requested that it be added back to the LPC agenda.  
Following the Planni ng Director’s June 7 letter, 
between June 17 and August 23, there was further communication 
between Bolton and the Planning Director regarding Bolton’s use 
of Parcels 31 and 44 and Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-
188.  Bolton sent at least three lett ers to the Planning 
Director, and Bolton and the Planning Director  scheduled an in-
person site inspection of Bolton’s property .  The correspondence 
between Bolton and the Planning Director reflect ed substantial 
fact-finding by the Planning Director.   On June 30, 2016, Bolton 
attended  an in-person meeting with the Planning Director, and 
sent a July 12 “follow up” letter that contained “specific 
information” the Planning Director had “requested” at the June 
30 meeting.  On July 27, 2016, the Planning Director  sent Bolton 
a letter stating that although Bolton’s July 12 letter 
“provide[d] some clarity, it d[id] not quite contain the 
specific information” the Planning Director requested at the  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
15 June 30 meeting , and made additional inquiries  of Bolton .  On 
August 2 3, the Planning Director sent another letter informing 
Bolton that a site inspection was required due to “apparent 
contradictions between the information provided in [Bolton’s] 
previous July 12, 2016 letter and [Bolton’s] latest submittal.”  
The Planning D irector asserted that the site inspection was 
“necessary in order for us to make a final determination on the 
parameters of [Bolton’s] Special Permit application.”  
The Planning Department’s Zoning Inspector and 
representatives  from the Department of Public  Works attended an 
in-person site  inspection .  After the inspection, on September 
21, 2016, the Planning Director sent Bolton an “Assessment of 
Conditions Relating to Warning Letter dated February 19, 
2016 . . . and Disposition of Special Permit Applicatio n No. 16 -
000188[.]”14  In the September 21 letter, the Planning Director 
described the communications between Bolton and himself as “a 
series of letters and confirmations requested of Bolton Inc. in 
an effort to determine whether or not a violation of the Z oning 
Code or State Land Use Law had occurred and if so, whether or 
not the Special Permit application filed by Bolton Inc. would 
continue to move forward.”  The September 21 letter stated that  
“[a]fter further consultation and field verification,” the 
                     
14  Hualalai was copied on this letter.   
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
16 Planning Director determined that the activity conducted on 
Parcel 44 fell under the grading permit and stockpiling permits 
previously granted to Bolton, and did not require a special 
permit under the Zoning Code.  
The letter noted that a special permit was required to 
run a quarry , which is the  “excavation or removal of natural 
building materials or minerals, for commercial use .”  However, 
the letter concluded  that “the evidence” indicated that Bolton’s 
“removal of natural building material from the subject pr operty 
is related to on -site and off -site drainage improvement 
purposes[,]” and not for commercial purposes.  The letter 
advised Bolton that, because a special permit was not required, 
“your Special Permit application will be withdrawn from further 
processing[.]” 
  In a September 28, 2016  letter, Bolton acknowledged 
receipt of the Planning Director’s September 21 letter and asked 
the Planning Director to “accept this letter as our formal 
request for the withdrawal of [Special Permit Application No. 
SPP-16-188].”  That same day, Hualalai sent a letter to the 
Planning Director objecting to his “purported ‘disposition’” of 
the February 19 warning letter and Special Permit Application 
No. SPP-16-188.  Hualalai noted that Special Permit Application 
No. SPP-16-188 and its intervention petition were currently 
pending before the LPC in a special permit proceeding, and  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
17 requested that the Planning Director forward Hualalai’s letter 
to the Chairperson and LPC “before [the Planning Director]  d[id] 
anything further on thi s matter.”  In its letter, Hualalai 
argued extensively against the issuance of Special Permit 
Application No. SPP -16-188.  Hualalai object ed to the Planning 
Director’s purported “disposition” of Special Permit Application 
No. SPP-16-188, and argued that “n o law gives the [LPC]’s staff 
the authority to ‘dispose’ of an accepted application or to 
allow an application to be ‘withdrawn’ after the [LPC] has taken 
jurisdiction of the application.”  
On October 4, 2016, the Planning Director notified 
Bolton that, “[b ased] on your request and our letter dated 
September 21, 2016, we will be withdrawing [Special Permit 
Application No. SPP -16-188].” 
On October 11, 2016, the Planning Director notified 
Hualalai that although the Planning Department had “previously 
acknowled ged receipt” of Hualalai’s petition to intervene , he 
had “recently received a request by the applicant to withdraw 
[Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188],” and notified 
Hualalai that the Planning Department would be refunding 
Hualalai’s $200 .00 filing fee. 
  On October 13, 2016, Hualalai filed a new petition 
with the LPC objecting to the Planning Director’s withdrawal  of 
Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188.  Hualalai argued that  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
18 only the LPC had jurisdiction over the application, and that the 
LPC could “dispose” of the application only after holding a 
public hearing.  Hualalai requested that the matter be placed on 
the LPC’s agenda for an immediate public hearing.  The LPC did 
not take any further action.    
B. Appeal to the Supreme Court  
As discussed  above, Bolton submitted Special Permit 
Application No. SPP -16-188 pursuant to HRS §  205-6 to resolve 
the potential Zoning Code violation s identified by the Planning 
Director , i.e., operating a quarry, and maintaining a 
construction base yard and a junk ya rd.  After the Planning 
Director withdrew Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188, 
Hualalai filed a direct appeal to this court , challenging the 
LPC’s failure to issue a decision on its petition to intervene 
and objecting to  the Planning Director’s withd rawal decision and 
the LPC’s  decision to treat the proceeding as a closed matter . 
Hualalai presents five points of error  to this court :  
(1) “The Appellee [LPC]  erred when it failed to rule on the 
Appellant’s Petition to Intervene in the Contested Case”; 
(2) “The Appellee [LPC]  erred when it failed to render a 
decision on [Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188] itself”; 
(3) “The Appellee Planning Director erred in exercising the 
Appellee [LPC]’s adjudicatory powers when he ‘withdrew’ the 
Application”; (4) “The Appellee [LPC] erred when it allowed the  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
19 Appellee Planning Director to act for the Commission”; and 
(5) “The Appellee Planning Director erred when he concluded that 
the county grading permit (issued in 2015 after Special Permit 
1047 had expired in 2010) ‘controlled’ and that the flood 
channelization project is a permitted use in the State 
Agriculture Land Use District.”  Hualalai requests the following 
relief:  
This court should vacate the Appellee Planning Director’s 
letters of September 21, 2016  . . . and October 4, 
2016 . . . to the extent that they constitute an agency 
order herein and should remand the contested case to the 
Appellee Leeward Planning Commission with instructions that 
(1) the Commission conduct a hearing on the Appellant’s 
Petition for Standing in a Contested Case, (2) that the 
Commission either grant or deny the petition and, 
thereafter and [ sic] (3) the Commission take action on the 
Appellee -Applicant Bolton, Inc.’s Application, including 
any request that the Appellee -Applicant m ight make to 
withdraw the Application, giving the Appellant the 
opportunity to participate in the agency proceeding on 
remand if the Appellee Leeward Planning Commission votes to 
admit the Appellant as a party in the contested case.  
 
  Hualalai contends th is court has jurisdiction to 
consider its appeal under HRS §  205-19, which governs appeals of 
contested cases arising before the land use commission and 
applies the  provisions in  HRS chapter 91 to such appeals.  
Appellees argue that this court lacks jurisd iction over the 
LPC’s “non -action,” that the issue became moot when Special 
Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 was withdrawn, and that 
Hualalai lacks standing.  Appellees argue that this court also 
lacks jurisdiction because Hualalai should appeal the Plann ing 
Director’s decision to the Board of Appeals.  Finally, Appellees  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
20 argue that the LPC did not abuse its discretion by ending 
proceedings on Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 once it 
was voluntarily withdrawn by Bolton.  Throughout its brief, 
Appellees emphasize that Hualalai “got exactly what it wanted 
from the LPC” because Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 
“was never approved.”    
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW  
Pursuant to HRS § 205-19, this court reviews agency 
decisions in contested cases under HRS § 91-14, which states, in 
relevant part : 
Upon review of the record, the court may affirm the 
decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions 
for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the 
decision and order if the substantial rights o f the 
petitioners may have been prejudiced because the 
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders 
are: 
 
(1)  In violation of constitutional or statutory 
provisions;  
 
(2)  In excess of the statutory authority or 
jurisdiction of the agency;  
 
(3)  Made upon unlawful procedure;  
 
(4)  Affected by other error of law;  
 
(5)  Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, 
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole 
record; or  
 
(6)  Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by 
abuse of discretion or  clearly unwarranted exercise 
of discretion.  
 
HRS § 91-14(g).  This court has further clarified that  
[c]onclusions of law are reviewed de novo, pursuant to 
subsections (1), (2) and (4); questions regarding 
procedural defects are reviewable under subsectio n (3); 
findings of fact (FOF) are reviewable under the clearly  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
21 erroneous standard, pursuant to subsection (5), and an 
agency’s exercise of discretion is reviewed under the 
arbitrary and capricious standard, pursuant to subsection 
(6). 
 
Lānaʻians for Sensib le Growth v. Land Use Comm ’n, 146 Hawaiʻi 
496, 502, 463 P.3d 1153, 1159 (2020)  (quoting Kauai Springs, 
Inc. v. Planning Comm’n of Kauaʻi, 133 Hawaiʻi 141, 164, 324 P.3d 
951, 974 (2014) ). 
When interpreting agency rules,  this court has stated 
that “[g]eneral  principles of statutory construction apply ,” 
which requires “ look[ing] first at an administrative rule’s 
language. ”  Liberty Dialysis -Haw., LLC v. Rainbow Dialysis, LLC , 
130 Hawaiʻi 95, 103, 306 P.3d 140, 148 (2013).   
If an administrative rule’s language is unambiguous, and 
its literal application is neither inconsistent with the 
policies of the statute the rule implements nor produces an 
absurd or unjust result, courts enforce the rule’s plain 
meaning. While an agency’s interpretation of its own rules 
is generally entitled to deference, this court does not 
defer to agency interpretations that are plainly erroneous 
or inconsistent with the underlying legislative purpose.

III.  DISCUSSION  
A. The Instant Appeal  is Not Moot ; This Court May Exercise 
Judicial Review of Hualalai’s Appeal  Pursuant to HRS 
§§ 205-19 and 91 -14 
 
1. Appellees’ withdrawal of Special Permit Application 
No. SPP-16-188 does not render  this case moot because 
Hualalai’s appeal presents a live controv ersy. 
Appellees contend that Hualalai’s appeal is moot 
because Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 has been 
withdrawn, thus ending Hualalai’s adverse interest in the case  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
22 and removing this court’s ability to order an effective remedy .  
“This court ha s stated that ‘[a] case is moot if it has lost its 
character as a present, live controversy of the kind that must 
exist if courts are to avoid advisory opinions on abstract 
propositions of law.’”  In re Marn Family , 141 Hawaiʻi 1, 7, 403 
P.3d 621, 627 (201 6) (quoting Ala Loop Homeowners , 123 Hawaiʻi at 
405, 235 P.3d at 1117).  In other words, “a ‘case is moot if the 
reviewing court can no longer grant effective relief.’”  Id. 
(quoting Ala Loop Homeowners , 123 Hawaiʻi at 405, 235 P.3d at 
1117). 
Appellees’ wi thdrawal of Special Permit Application 
No. SPP-16-188 does not render this case moot because , as in 
Kona Old  Haw. Trail Grp. v. Lyman , 69 Haw. 81, 734 P.2d 161 
(1987), Hualalai’s appeal presents a “live controversy” and this 
court is able to “grant effecti ve relief .”  In re Marn Family , 
141 Hawaiʻi at 7, 403 P.3d at 627  (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted) .  In Kona Old , an association of Kona 
residents  (“Kona Old”)  appealed  the Planning Director’s issuance 
of a special management area minor use permit to the circuit 
court under HRS §  91-14(a).15  69 Haw. at 84-89, 734 P.2d at 163 -
                     
15  HRS § 91-14(a) states, in relevant part, “ Any person aggrieved by 
a final decision and order in a contested case or by a preliminary ruling of 
the nature that deferral of review pending entry of a subsequent final 
decision would deprive appellant of adequ ate relief is entitled to judicial 
review thereof under this chapter [.]”  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
23  66.  The permit authorized the property owner to develop the 
property  by consolidating his two parcels, installing utility 
lines and roadways, and subdividing the property into 
residential lots .  Id. at 84, 734  P.2d at 163 -64.  The Planning 
Director moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing that there was no 
“contested case”16 and Kona Old  was not a “person aggrieved” 
within the meaning of HRS §  91-14.  Id. at 86, 734 P.2d at 165.  
The circuit court granted the dismis sal,17 and Kona Old  appealed  
to this court .  Id.  While Kona Old’s  appeal was pending, in 
anticipation of a sale, the landowner procured and completed 
work under a grubbing permit for the property.  Id.  The 
landowner  then argued that the appeal should be d ismissed as 
moot because the work under the grubbing permit had been 
completed .  Id.  The supreme  court declined to dismiss the 
appeal as moot , holding that the appeal  was a live controversy 
and “retain[ed] vitality” because, so long as the construction 
authorized under the original special management area minor use 
                     
16  In Kona Old , the Planning Director issued to the landowner a 
“special management area minor use permit” as opposed to a “ special 
management area use permit .”  Id. at 84, 734 P.2d a t 164.  On appeal, the 
supreme court noted that the rules governing the issuance of  special 
management area minor use permits did not mandate a hearing preceding the 
Planning Director’s issuance of such permits.  Id. at 90, 734 P.2d at 167.  
Thus, as a hea ring was not required by statute or agency rules, there was no 
contested case within the meaning of HRS §  91-14(a).  Id. 
 
17  Although the circuit court did not give a reason for dismissal, 
this court stated that the circuit court dismissed the appeal “obvi ously on 
jurisdictional grounds.”  Kona Old , 69 Haw. at 89, 734 P.2d at 166.   
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
24  permit was not complete, the appeal “present[ed] an adversity of 
interests and possibly afford[ed] [Kona Old]  an effective 
remedy.”  Id. at 87, 734 P.2d at 165.   This court found that 
even if al l work under the two permits was completed, “a basis 
for the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction remain [ed]” 
because the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine 
would apply.18  Id.   
In the present case, Appellees are correct that  
Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 was withdrawn .  
However, an adversity of interests continues to render the 
controversy “live” because either:  the original  conduct that 
prompted Bolton to submit  Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-
188 remains ongoing, or, if Bolton’s  development project is 
completed  without review , similar withdrawal of permit 
applications subsequent to unpermitted const ruction is capable 
of repetition .  There remains an adversity of interests here 
because the Planning Director made a “fina l determination” that 
“the evidence” showed Bolton’s construction activity  was covered 
by its existing permits , and Hualalai ha s an interest in arguing 
                     
18  The public interest exception applies “[w]hen the question 
involved affects the public interest, and it is likely  . . . that similar 
questions arising in the future would like wise become moot before a needed 
authoritative determination by an appellate court can be made[.]”  Id. 
(quoting Johnston v. Ing , 50 Haw. 379, 381, 441 P.2d 138, 140 (1968)).  This 
court reasoned that the questions in Kona Old  were of public concern and, i f 
they were to recur in the future, would likely become moot before a 
determination on appeal could be made.  Id. at 87-88, 734 P.2d at 165 –66.  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
25 that the evidence showed otherwise .  Namely, Hualalai has an 
interest in arguing  that Bolton’s construct ion activity exceeded 
the conditions of its existing grading and stockpiling permits  
(Permit No s. 092524 , 092525, and 092529) and, therefore , 
required an additional  special permit .19 
Analogous to the appeal in Kona Old , Hualalai’s appeal 
also “retains vital ity” because the appeal “possibly affords 
[it] an effective remed y[,]” that is, remand to the LPC for a 
hearing to determine whether Hualalai’s petition to intervene 
should be granted or denied.  Id.  Thus, under the facts of this 
case, Appellees ’ withdraw al of Special Permit Application No. 
SPP-16-188 does not render moot Hualalai’s  appeal to  this court . 
2. Pursuant to  HRS §§ 205-19 and 91 -14, this court may 
exercise judicial review because Hualalai is aggrieved 
by a final decision in a contested case , partic ipated 
in the contested case , followed LPC Rules,  and has 
established standing . 
Appellees argue that this court lacks jurisdiction 
over Hualalai’s appeal pursuant to HRS §§  205-19 and 91 -14 
because the LPC did not issue a final decision  in a contested 
case hearing and Hualalai was not injured by the LPC ’s failure 
to issue a decision on Hualalai’s petition or the LPC’s 
withdrawal of Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-18.  HRS 
                     
19  For example, evidence showing that Bolton’s excavation and 
removal of natural building material from the pro perty was, in fact, for 
commercial purposes, as prohibited by HCC §  25-5-72(c) without a special 
permit.

26 (continued . . .)  §§ 205-19 and 91 -14 provide the requirements for judicial review 
of direct appea ls of contested cases to this court ; HRS § 205-
19(a) applies the requirements of chapter 91 to contested cases 
before the LPC : 
Chapter 91 shall apply to every contested case arising 
under this chapter except where chapter 91 conflicts with 
this chapter, in  which case this chapter shall apply.  Any 
other law to the contrary notwithstanding, including 
chapter 91, any contested case under this chapter shall be 
appealed from a final decision and order or a preliminary 
ruling that is of the nature defined by sec tion 91-14(a) 
upon the record directly to the supreme court for final 
decision.  
HRS § 205-19(a).  This case arises under chapter 205 because it 
involves a special permit application to the LPC, an agency20 
that possesses authority to rule on such applicatio ns pursuant 
to HRS § 205-6.21  HRS § 91-14(a) further provides, “Any person 
                     
20  The LPC is an agency because it is a “county  . . . 
commission  . . . authorized by law to make rules or to adjudicate contested 
cases.”  HRS §  91-1 (2017). 
 
21  HRS § 205 -6 provides in relevant part:  
 
(a)  Subject to this section, the county planning 
commission may permit certain unusual and reasonable uses 
within agricultural and rural districts other than those 
for which the district is classified.   Any person who 
desires to use the person ’s land within an agricultural or 
rural district other than for an agricultural or rural use, 
as the case may be, may petition the planning commission of 
the county within which the person ’s land is located for 
permission to use the person ’s land in the manner 
desired.  . . . 
 
(b)  The planning commission, upon consultation with the 
central coordinating agency, except in counties where the 
planning commission is advisory only in which case the 
central coordinating agenc y, shall establish by rule or 
regulation, the time within which the hearing and action on 
petition for special permit shall occur.  The county 
planning commission shall notify the land use commission

27 aggrieved by a final decision and order in a contested case or 
by a preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of review 
pending entry of a subsequent final decision would depri ve 
appellant of adequate relief is entitled to judicial review 
thereof under this chapter[.]”22  In Pub. Access Shoreline Haw. 
v. Haw. C nty Planning Comm’n (PASH), this court identified  the 
“necessary  inquiry” to determine whether a court may review an 
agency appeal  under HRS § 91-14(a):  (1) there must have been a  
contested case hearing ; (2) “the agency’s action  must represent 
a final decision and order, or a preliminary ruling such that 
deferral of review would deprive the claimant of adequate 
relief;” (3) “the claimant  must have followed the applicable 
agency rules and , therefore,  have been involved in the contested 
case;” and (4)  “the claimant’s legal interests  must have been 
injured” such that the claimant  has “standing to appeal .”  79 
                     
(. . . continued) 
 
and such persons and agencies that may have an interes t in 
the subject matter of the time and place of the hearing.  
 
(c)  The county planning commission may, under such 
protective restrictions as may be deemed necessary, permit  
 
the desired use, but only when the use would promote the 
effectiveness and objec tives of this chapter; provided that 
a use proposed for designated important agricultural lands 
shall not conflict with any part of this chapter.   A 
decision in favor of the applicant shall require a majority 
vote of the total membership of the county plan ning 
commission.  
 
22  Hualalai is a “person,” as used in “person aggrieved,” because it 
is an association or organization as defined by HRS § 91 -1.  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
28 Hawaiʻi 425, 431, 903 P.2d 1246, 1252 (1995) (internal quotation 
marks omitted).   “In other words, there are four requirements 
for judicial review over an agency appeal:   a contested case 
hearing, finality, compliance with agency rule, and standing .”  
In re Maui Elec. Co., Ltd. (MECO), 141 Hawaiʻi 249, 258, 408 P.3d 
1, 10 (2017).  This court may exercise judicial review  of this 
appeal pursuant to  HRS §§ 205-19 and 91 -14 because Hualalai is 
aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case in which it 
has participated and followed agency rules, an d has establish ed 
standing .   
a. The proceeding for Special Permit Application No. 
SPP-16-188 was a “contested case.”  
The first requirement for judicial review  under HRS 
§ 91-14 is that the appeal be from a contested case proceeding .  
PASH, 79 Hawaiʻi at 431,  903 P.2d at 1252.   A “contested case” is 
“a proceeding in which  the legal rights, duties, or privileges 
of specific parties are required by law to be determined after 
an opportunity for agency hearing.”  HRS § 91 -1.  For an agency 
hearing to be “required by law” it must be required by agency 
rule, statute, or constitutional due process.  See MECO, 141 
Hawaiʻi at 258, 408 P.3d at 10.  This court has found that “a 
public hearing, conducted pursuant to published notice, was a 
‘contested case’ within the meaning of HRS [§]  91-1.”  In re 
Haw. Elec. Co. , 56 Haw. 260, 264, 535 P.2d 1102, 1105 (1975)   
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
29 (citing E. Diamond Head Ass’n v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals , 52 Haw. 
518, 524 479 P.2d 796, 799 (1971)).  A case in which no formal 
contested case hearing is held can be considered a “contested 
case” within the meaning of chapter 91 .  In Kilakila ʻO Haleakal ā 
v. Bd. of Land &  Nat. Res. , where administrative rules required 
a hearing by law but no contested case hearing was actually 
held, this court considered “whether a formal hearing would have  
determined --or whether the proceedings that did take place  
determined --the ‘rights, duties, or privileges of specific 
parties. ’”  131 Hawaiʻi 193, 202, 317 P.3d  27, 36 (2013) 
(emphasis added)  (finding a contested case where the proceedings 
that took place determined the agency’s rights, duties, and 
privileges, even though a formal hearing was never held).  Thus, 
absence of a formal contested case hearing does not preclude a 
finding that the proceeding was  a contested case.  
The proceeding for Special Permit Application No. SPP -
16-188 was a contested case because an agency hearing was 
required by the LPC rules and statutes relevant to the issuan ce 
of special permits , LPC Rule 4, 6; HRS §§  91-9, 205-6 
(referenced by HCC §  25-2-61(c)), and such a hearing would have 
determined the “legal rights, duties, or privileges of specific 
parties[,]” HRS § 91 -1.  Bolton submitted Special Permit 
Application No . SPP-16-188 pursuant to  LPC Rule 6, which 
requires that the LPC hold a public hearing as part of the   
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
30 (continued . . .)  special permit  application process .  LPC Rule 6 -6(a) (“Upon 
acceptance of a Special Permit application, the Commission, 
through the Department, shall fix a date for the public 
hearing.”).  Hualalai submitted its petition to intervene  
pursuant to LPC Rule 4 -6, which requires a hearing upon receipt 
of such petitions .23  LPC Rule 4 -6(b) (“Upon receipt of a written 
request to intervene, the Commission, at the fi rst meeting on 
the matter, shall hold a hearing on the written request.”).  
Neither LPC Rule 4 nor Rule 6 grant the LPC discretion to decide 
whether or not to hold a hearing ; a hearing is  mandatory under 
both Rules.  HRS §  91-9 also mandates that “in any c ontested 
case, all parties shall be afforded an opportunity for hearing 
after reasonable notice.”24  HRS § 91-9(a) (emphasis added) .   
                     
23  The LPC also expressly referenced LPC Rule 4 when it gave public 
notice of the hearing on Special Permit A pplication No. SPP -16-188.  The 
LPC’s public agenda for the hearing on Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-
188 stated:  
 
Pursuant to Rule 4, Contested Case Procedure, of the County 
of Hawaiʻi Planning Commission Rules of Practice and 
Procedure, any person seeking to intervene as a party to a 
contested case hearing on the above Agenda Items Nos. 1 
through 4 is required to file a written request which must 
be received in the office of the Plan ning Department no 
later than seven (7) calendar days prior to the Planning 
Commission’s first public meeting on the matter.  Such 
written request shall be in conformity with Rule 4, in a 
form as provided by the Planning Department entitled 
“Petition for S tanding in a Contested Case Hearing.”  
 
24  Additionally, HRS §  205-6, which governs the Land Use Commission 
and establishes criteria related to special permits, uses mandatory language 
in reference to scheduling and conducting special permit hearings, stati ng 
that the Land Use Commission “shall establish by rule or regulation, the time 
within which the hearing and action on petition for special permit shall

31 The proceedings following Bolton’s submission of 
Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 constituted  a 
contested case within the meaning of HRS §  91-14(a) and PASH 
because, although no agency hearing occurred,  a hearing was 
required  by LPC Rules 4 and 6 and HRS §  91-9 to determine 
Bolton’s and Hualalai ’s respective legal rights and duties . 
b. The Planning Director’s withdrawal  of Special 
Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 constituted a 
“final decision.”  
The second requirement for judicial review  under HRS 
§ 91-14 is that the appeal is from a final decision  made by the 
agency.  PASH, 79 Hawaiʻi at 431, 903 P.2d at 1252.  A final 
decision or order is one  that “end[s]  the proceedings, leaving 
nothing further to be accomplished.”  Gealon v. Keala , 60 Haw. 
513, 520, 591 P.2d 621, 626 (1979).  Such a decision can take 
the form of an agency’s formal  denial of a party’s request for a 
contested case hearing, see, e.g., Kaleikini v. Thielen , 124 
Hawaiʻi 1, 26, 237 P.3d 1067, 1092 (2010), or an agency’s denial 
of a party’s request to intervene in a contested case, see, 
e.g., PASH, 79 Hawaiʻi at 433–34, 903 P.2d at 1254–55.  An 
agency’s failure to deny or grant a party’s request for a 
                     
(. . . continued) 
 
occur[,]” and “shall notify the land use commission and such persons and 
agencies that may have an i nterest in the subject matter of the time and 
place of the hearing.”  §  205-6(b).  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
32 contested case hearing followed by agency action that 
effectively ends the proceeding  may also constitute a final 
decision .  See, e.g., Kilakila , 131 Hawaiʻi at 202–03, 317 P .3d 
at 36–37. 
The LPC rendered a final decision when it ended the 
contested case proceeding without first disposing of Hualalai’s 
petition to intervene .  When a party submits a petition to 
intervene, LPC Rule 4 -6(b) states, “The Commission will grant or 
deny such written request prior to  any further action on the 
matter.”   (emphasis added).   Appellees failed to follow this 
rule and as a consequence Hualalai did not receive  a grant or 
denial of its petition  to intervene.  This court has not yet 
considered a HRS § 91-14 appeal arising from an agency’s failure 
to deny or grant a party’s request to intervene.  However, the 
facts of Kilakila  and PASH compel the conclusion  that an 
agency’s failure to act on a party’s formal petition to 
intervene  constitutes a fina l decision within the meaning of HRS 
§ 91-14(a).   
A person may satisfy HRS § 91-14(a)’s “final decision” 
requirement and appeal an agency’s decision , even if the agency 
neither granted nor denied their request for a contested case 
hearing.  For example, i n Kilakila , this court reviewed the 
Board of Land and Natural Resources (“BLNR”) ’s decision to  grant 
a permit for the construction of a telescope on the summit of  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
33 Haleakalā  without granting or denying Kilakila ʻO Haleakalā  
(“KOH”)’s formal request for a co ntested case hearing .  131 
Hawaiʻi at 195–96, 317 P.3d at 29 –30.  The circuit court and ICA 
dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because a 
contested case hearing was not held.  Id. at 196, 317 P.3d at 
30.  This court , however,  held that “the absen ce of a formal 
denial is not dispositive of the issue[,]” and found that 
“failure to either grant or deny KOH’s requests for a contested 
case hearing became an effective denial  when BLNR proceeded to 
render a final decision by voting to grant the permit[.] ”  Id. 
at 203, 317 P.3d at 37  (emphasis added) .   
A person may satisfy  HRS § 91-14(a)’s “final decision” 
requirement and appeal an agency’s decision , even if their 
request to intervene was denied by the agency.  For example, i n 
PASH, this court reviewed  the Hawaiʻi County Planning Commission 
(“HCPC”)’s decision to grant a permit for the construction of a 
resort complex on the Big Island .  79 Hawaiʻi at 429–30, 903 P.2d 
at 1250–51.  PASH, a “public interest member ship organization, ” 
submitted a  request to the HCPC to participate  in the proceeding 
and to implement contested case procedures .  Id. at 429, 433, 
903 P.2d at 1250, 1254.  The HCPC denied PASH’s request on the 
basis that PASH did not have standing.  Id. at 429, 903 P.2d at 
1250.  Though PASH’s reques t to intervene in the permit 
proceeding was denied, the circuit court properly exercised  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
34 judicial review  of PASH’s appeal  under HRS §  91-14(a), and 
affirmed the ICA’s decision affirming the circuit court’s order 
remanding to the HCPC to hold a contested ca se hearing in which 
PASH would be allowed to participate.  Id. at 433, 903 P.2d at 
1254.   
In both Kilakila  and PASH, this court found there was 
a final decision within the meaning of HRS §  91-14(a), despite 
lack of party status before the agency by PASH (whose request to 
intervene was denie d) and KOH (who received no ruling on its 
request for a contested case hearing) .  Thus, in the present 
case, where the LPC failed to rule on Hualalai’s petition  to 
intervene  and the Planning Director withdrew Special Per mit 
Application No. SPP -16-188--action that effectively ended the 
contested case proceeding --it follows that there was a “final 
decision”  by the LPC within the meaning of HRS §  91-14(a).   
Appellees’ contend there was “non -action” in this case 
and that the re was no final decision because “the hearing  . . . 
never happened .”  However, Appellees concede that they “elected 
to let [Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188] lie as a 
closed matter.”   “Electing” to let a proceeding “lie as a closed 
matter” is reviewable agency action given that it had the 
consequence of effectively ending the proceeding for Special 
Permit Application No. SPP -16-188.  Appellees also argue that 
the LPC took no “affirmative action” that “stripp[ed]” any  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
35 aggrieved party of its rights b ecause “the determinative action 
on SP 16 -188 was taken by [Bolton], not the agency.”  However, 
the record --specifically, the Planning Director’s September 21, 
2016 letter to Bolton --indicates that Appellees, not Bolton, 
initiated the withdrawal of Special Permit Application No. SPP -
16-188.  Additionally, the Planning Director’s  August 23, 2016 
letter to Bolton stated that a site inspection was “necessary in 
order for us to make a final determination on the parameters of 
[Bolton’s] Special Permit applicatio n.”25  The Planning Director 
thus acknowledges that  his actions constituted a “final 
determination” on Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188.  
Even if Bolton, and not the Planning Director , had initiated the 
withdrawal process, the LPC still would have “elected” to let 
the proceeding for Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 
“lie as a closed matter,” an action that constitute s a final 
decision .  
The LPC’s  failure to deny or grant Hualalai’s petition 
to intervene in the contested case and the Planning  Director’s 
termination of the proceedings by withdrawing Special Permit 
Application No. SPP -16-188 constituted a final  decision  within 
the meaning of HRS §  91-14(a) and PASH. 
                     
25  A site inspection occurred pursuant to the Planning Director’s 
August 23, 2016 letter.

36 c. Hualalai followed LPC rules and participated  in 
the contested case.  
The third re quirement for judicial review  under HRS 
§ 91-14 is that the claimant follow agency rules and be involved 
in the contested case.  PASH, 79 Hawaiʻi at 431, 903 P.2d at 
1252.  This court has clarified that “[a]lthough an aggrieved 
person must have participate d in a contested case in order to 
invoke judicial intervention,” standing to appeal an agency 
decision is not “conditioned  . . . upon formal intervention in 
the agency proceeding.”  In re Haw . Elec. Light Co.  (HELCO), 145 
Hawaiʻi 1, 22, 445 P.3d 673, 6 94 (2019) (internal quotation marks 
omitted)  (quoting  Mahuiki v. Plan ning Comm’n of Kauaʻi, 65 Haw. 
506, 515, 654 P.2d 874,  880 (1982) .  In other words, “adversary 
participation need not be confined to formal proceedings before 
the agency.”  In re Haw. Elec. C o., 56 Haw. at 264, 535 P.2d at 
1105. 
Hualalai followed LPC Rule 4 -6(a) and participated in 
the proceeding by submitting a petition to intervene and paying 
the requisite filing fee.  Hualalai also participated before the 
LPC through oral testimony from res idents of the subdivisions 
whose community associations comprise Hualalai, an attorney 
representing Hualalai, and the president of Hualalai.  The LPC’s 
failure to grant Hualalai’s petition to intervene does not 
preclude this court from finding that Hualala i clearly  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
37 participated and followed LPC Rules in the contested case 
proceeding for Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188, as 
required by PASH for judicial review pursuant to  HRS § 91-14(a). 
d. Hualalai has established standing .  
The final requirement for judicial review  under HRS 
§ 91-14 is that the claimant show its legal interests were 
injured such that it has standing to appeal.   PASH, 79 Hawaiʻi at 
431, 903 P.2d at 1252 ; see also HELCO, 145 Hawaiʻi at 21, 445 
P.3d at 693 (the claimant must be “specially, personally, and 
adversely affected” by the final decision ).  This court 
“evaluate[s] standing using the ‘injury in fact’ test requiring:  
(1) an actual or threatened injury, which, (2) is traceable to 
the challenged action, and (3) is likely to be remedied by 
favorable judicial action.”  Kilakila , 131 Hawaiʻi at 204, 317 
P.3d at 38 (internal quotation marks omitted).  As we have 
noted, however, “where the interests at stake are in the realm 
of environmental concerns[,] we have not been inclined to 
foreclose challenges to administrative determinations through 
restrictive applications of standing requirements.”  Id. at 204-
05, 317 P.3d at 38 -39 (internal quotation marks omitted) 
(quoting Citizens for the Prot. of the N. Kohala Coastline v. 
County of Hawaiʻi, 91 Hawaiʻi 94, 100 –01, 979 P.2d 1120, 1126 –27 
(1999)).     
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
38 Hualalai alleges an injury in fact  to the property  and 
environmental and aesthetic interests  of area property owners 
who claim  that Bolton’s  development negatively affects their 
properties through noise, dust, negative aesthetic effects, 
diminished property values, and increased traffic.  These claims 
amount to  a legally cognizable injury .  Our decision in Life of 
the Land, Inc. v. Land Use Comm’n , 61 Haw. 3, 594 P.2d 1079  
(1979), is instructive.  In Life of the Lan d, an environmental 
nonprofit appealed  the Land Use Commission’s reclassification of 
property from agricultur al to urban.   Id. at 4, 594 P.2d  at 
1080.  To show that it was personally and adversely affected by 
the Commission’s reclassific ation, and, thus, had standing under 
HRS § 91-14, the nonprofit submitted statements from  its members 
who were residents in the vicinity of the reclassified lands, 
who used the lands for recreational activities such as swimming, 
hiking, and camping, as wel l as for “aesthetic, conservational, 
occupational, professional and academic pursuits [.]”  Id. at 8, 
594 P.2d  at 1082.   The nonprofit contended that “future 
urbanization w [ould] destroy beaches and open space now enjoyed 
by” these residents  such that “purs uits presently enjoyed 
[would] be irrevocably lost [,]” and that development of the land 
would “have an adverse effect on its members  and on the 
environment .”  Id.  This court found this to be a legally 
cognizable injury sufficient to establish the nonprofi t’s  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
39 standing under HRS §  91-14, recognizing “the importance  of 
aesthetic and environmental interests ” where a claimant’s 
interests are “‘ personal ’ and ‘special’, or where a property 
interest is also affected .”  Id.  In another appeal brought 
under HRS §  91-14, Pele Def. Fund v. Puna Geothermal Venture , 
residents challenged the Department of Health’s decision to 
issue permits for geothermal wells and power plants, arguing 
that they were injured by “potential harm including diminished 
property values, deterio ration of air quality, odor nuisance, 
and possible physical injury resulting from the permitted 
operations .”  77 Hawaiʻi 64, 70, 881 P.2d 1210, 1216 (1994) .  
This court, again, found that  the residents had “clearly 
demonstrated” an injury i n fact.  Id. 
Recognizing that the  injuries asserted by the Hualalai 
landowners to their property, environmental, and aesthetic 
interests in the present case are comparable to those recognized 
by this court in Life of the Land  and Pele Def. Fund , we hold 
that Hualalai has alleged a  legally cognizable  injury.  
Hualalai has also satisfied the causation and 
redressability prongs of standing,  as required by PASH and HRS 
§ 91-14(a).  Hualalai’s alleged injury is traceable to the 
challenged action:  Hualalai alleges that by failing to follow 
the contested case procedure set forth in the LPC Rules, 
Appellees have improperly enabled development by  Bolton that  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
40 resulted in the property, environmental, and aesthetic injuries 
Hualalai identified in its petition to intervene.  And finally, 
Hualalai’s injury is likely to be remedied by the favorable 
judicial action it seeks:  a hearing before the LPC .26  In light 
of this court’s  lenient threshold for standing in cases that are 
“in the realm of environmental concerns,” Kilakila , 131 Hawaiʻi 
at 204, 317 P.3d at 38, Hualalai has shown that it has standing, 
as required by PASH for judicial review pursuant to HRS §  91-
14(a). 
Accordingly, p ursuant to the requirements for judicial 
review of agency decisions under HRS §  91-14(a), we hold that 
the proceeding for Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 was 
a contested case  because a hearing --that would have determined 
the rights of both Bolto n (as a permit applicant) and Hualalai  
(as an adverse party) --was required by LPC rules and statute .  
We also hold that Appellees’ failure to act on Hualalai’s 
petition followed by its withdrawal of Bolton’s application 
constituted a final decision  within the meaning of HRS §  91-
14(a).  We also hold that Hualalai participated  and followed LPC 
                     
26  Appellees repeatedly contend that the court cannot fashion a 
remedy for Hualalai because Hualalai “got exactly what it wanted” as Special 
Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 was never approved.  While it is true that 
Hualalai initially sought the denial of Special Permit Application No. SPP -
16-188, Hualalai, in substance, objects to Bolt on’s actions and contends that 
Bolton exceeded the scope of the grading and stockpiling permits that it had 
previously been issued.  Moreover, Appellees’ withdrawal of the application 
had the same practical effect as if Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 
were granted.   
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
41 Rules in the proceeding for Special Permit Application No. SPP -
16-188 and has standing to allege its legally cognizable 
property, environmental,  and aesthetic injuries .  Therefore, 
pursuant to HRS §§ 205 -19 and 91-14, and PASH, 79 Hawaiʻi at 431, 
903 P.2d at 1252, this cour t may exercise judicial review  of 
Hualalai’s appeal.  
B. Appellees’ Decision s were Made Upon Unlawful Procedure and 
Constituted Abuse s of Discretion  
Under HRS §  91-14(g), upon reviewing the record, this 
court may “remand the case with instructions for further 
proceedings  . . . if the substantial rights of the petitioner[] 
may have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, 
conclusions, decisions, or orders are:  . . . [m]ade upon 
unlawful procedure;  . . . or [a]rbitrary, or capricious, or 
characterized  by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted 
exercise of discretion.”  HRS § 91-14(g)(3), (6).  
The Planning Director’s  decision to withdraw Special 
Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 and to end the contested case 
proceeding without the LPC first issuing a  decision  on 
Hualalai’s petition  to intervene  relied upon  “unlawful 
procedure ” and constituted an “abuse of discretion ,” which may 
have prejudiced Hualalai’s substantial rights.     
The LPC’s failure to grant or deny Hualalai’s petition 
to intervene and the Planning Director’s subsequent decision to  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
42 withdraw Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 was based 
upon unlawful procedure because, under LPC Rule 4 -6’s 
unambiguous language , Hualalai was entitled to a ruling on its 
petition to intervene before any other action was taken in the 
contested case.  General principles of statutory construction  
apply when  interpreting administrative rules .  See Liberty 
Dialysis -Haw., 130 Hawaiʻi at 103, 306 P.3d at 148.  If the 
agency rule is “unambiguous, and its literal application is 
neither inconsistent with the policies of the statute the rule 
implements nor produces an absurd or unjust result,” this court 
should “enforce the rule’s plain meaning.”  Id.  Although “an 
agency’s interpretation of its own rules is generally entitled 
to deference, this court does not defer to agency 
interpretations that are plainly erroneous or inconsistent with 
the underlying legislative purpose.”  Id. (interna l quotation 
marks omitted).  
LPC Rule 4 -6(b) states, “Upon receipt of a written 
request to intervene, the Commission, at the first meeting on 
the matter , shall hold a hearing on the written request.  . . . 
The Commission will grant or deny such written reque st prior to 
any further action on the matter .”  (emphas is added).  LPC 4 -
6(d) continues, “ [a]fter establishing the parties to the 
proceeding , the Commission may either proceed with the hearing, 
or continue the matter to a more appropriate time and date.”   
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
43  (emphasis added).  The language of LPC Rule 4 -6 is unambiguous:  
the LPC must issue a decision on a petition to intervene and 
establish the parties before taking further action in a 
contested case.  This interpretation of LPC Rule 4 -6 is 
consistent with HR S chapter 91, which contains provisions 
ensuring all parties are afforded a full and fair opportunity to 
be heard and to develop the record throughout the proceeding ; 
chapter 91 enumerates  the rights afforded parties in a contested 
case proceeding.27   
Once a person files a petition to intervene, LPC Rule 
4-6(b) clearly requires that the LPC hold a hearing “on the 
first meeting on the matter” to determine whether to grant or 
deny that petition before it may take any further action in the 
                     
27  For example, HRS §  91-9--which governs contested cases, notice, 
hearings, and records --states that “in any contested case, all parties  shall 
be afforded an opportunity for hearing after reasonable notice.”  HRS §  91-
9(a) (emphasis ad ded).  The statute continues, “ [o]pportunities shall be 
afforded all parties  to present evidence and argument on all issues  
involved.”  HRS §  91-9(c) (emphasis added).  HRS §  91-10(3) states, “ [e]very 
party shall have the right to conduct such cross -examination as may be 
required for a full and true disclosure of the facts , and shall have the 
right to submit rebuttal evidence [.]”  (emphasis added).  An agency is 
prohibited from considering “matters outside the record  . . . in making its 
decision.”  HRS §  91-9(g) (emphasis added).  HRS §  91-13 similarly precludes 
an “official of an agency who renders a decision in a contested case” from 
“consult[ing] any person on any issue of fact except upon notice and 
opportunity for all parties to participate , save to the  extent required for 
the disposition of ex parte matters authorized by law.”  (emphasis added).   
LPC Rules establish additional rights afforded to parties in a 
contested case proceeding.  See LPC Rule 4 -6 (requiring a hearing on a 
petition to intervene an d stating that “[t]he [LPC] will grant or deny such 
written request prior to any further action on the matter,” and all requiring  
one “good faith” mediation between all parties); Rule 4 -7 (allowing the 
parties to hold a conference with the presiding office r); Rule 4 -12 (giving 
each party the right to cross -examine witnesses and present rebuttal 
evidence); Rule 4 -13 (allowing parties to request issuance of a subpoena).

(continued . . .)  contested case.  In the present case, although the original 
hearing on Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 was 
continued at Bolton’s request, Special Permit Application No. 
SPP-16-188 remained a live agenda item on which the LPC received 
oral testimony at the LPC’s May 19, 2016 meeting.28  Under LPC 
Rule 4-6(b), the LPC’s May 19 meeting was the “first meeting” on 
Special Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 and Hualalai’s 
petition should have been resolved at that time.  It was 
“plainly erroneous ” for the LPC to disregard th e procedures in 
LPC Rule 4 -6 and continue with proceedings for Special Permit 
Application No. SPP -16-188 while leaving Hualalai’s petition 
pending.   Liberty Dialysis -Haw., 130 Hawaiʻi at 103, 306 P.3d at 
148.  By failing to follow LPC Rule 4 -6, Appellees m ay have 
prejudiced Hualalai’s substantial rights --the rights it would 
have had as a party to the proceeding.29  Thus, because the LPC 
                     
28  The LPC heard oral testimony from concerned members of the 
public, including from seve ral individuals associated with Hualalai.  
 
29  See supra note 27 and accompanying text.  Had Hualalai  been 
approved by the LPC as a party, it would have been privy to the rights 
afforded to parties by HRS chapter 91 and LPC Rules.   Moreover, HRS §  91-1 
and LPC Rule 1 -3(m) define “party” as any  person “named or admitted as a 
party, or properly seeking and entitled as of right to be admitted as a 
party” in any court or agency proceeding .  (emphasis added).  LPC Rule  4-6(b) 
establishes the criteria for an intervening party, which includes a person 
who can show “that the proposed action will cause them actual or threatened 
injury in fact.”  LPC Rule 4 -6(b)(4).  Here, Hualalai qualifies as a 
“person . . . properly seeki ng and entitled as of right to be admitted as a 
party” under HRS §  91-1 and LPC Rule 1 -3(m) because it followed the proper 
intervention procedures set forth in LPC Rule 4 -6(a) and has established it 
will suffer actual or threatened injury in fact, see supra section III.A.2.d, 
as required by LPC Rule 4 -6(b)(4).  Although it is not a necessary holding to   
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
45 used unlawful procedure here, remand is appropriate under HRS 
§ 91-14(g)(3).  
Remand is also appropriate under HRS §  91-14(g)(6) 
because the LPC and Planning Director made decisions that were 
“characterized by abuse of discretion.”  The Planning Director  
abused his discretion when he  withdrew Bolton’s Special Permit 
Application No. SPP -16-188 after extensive  nonpublic 
communica tion and fact -finding with only one party , Bolton,  in 
the contested case.   This court has held that such ex parte  
arguments in a contested case violate HRS chapter 91.   In Town 
v. Land Use Comm ’n, this court considered the Land Use 
Commission ’s approval of a landowner’s petition to change his 
district’s designation from agricultural to rural.  55 Haw. 538,  
539, 524 P.2d 84 , 85 (1974).  Town, an adjoining landowner, had 
appeared at a public hearing and opposed the petition.  Id., 524 
P.2d at 86.  Two meeting s--one of which Town attended --were 
scheduled to render a final decision on the petition , but both 
meetings were deferred at the petitioner’s request.  Id.  A 
third meeting was scheduled; Town did not attend the meeting, 
but wrote to the Commission and obj ected “to the taking of any 
testimony or further evidence from the petitioner .”  Id. at 540, 
                     
(. . . continued) 
 
the disposition of this appeal, Hualalai qualifies as a “party” within the 
meaning of HRS chapter 91 and was privy to the rights enumerated therein.

(continued . . .)  524 P.2d at 86.  At th is meeting, the petitioner, despite being 
told he was prohibited from introducing new evidence, submitted 
documents for the Commission’s cons ideration , argued in favor of 
his petition, and rebutted all statements made in opposition to 
his petition.  Id.  The Commission approved the petition, and 
Town appealed to the circuit court, which granted summary 
judgment in favor of the Commission .  Id.  We reversed the 
circuit court’s grant of summary judgment , and held that the 
Commission  committed “prejudicial error .”  Id. at 549, 524 P.2d 
at 92.  We reasoned that Town “was not given the opportunity to 
present argument or rebuttal evidence of his own t o counter the 
ex parte  arguments presented by [the] petitioner ,” nor did he 
have “the opportunity to cross -examine [the] petitioner[.] ”  Id. 
at 549, 524 P.2d at 91–92.  Town demonstrates a commitment to  a 
core principle of contested case proceedings :  ensuring that all 
parties have a full and fair opportunity to develop the record  
before the agency renders a decision on the petition .  See HRS 
§§ 91-9(a), (c), (g), 91 -10(3), 91 -13.30   
                     
30  HRS § 91-9 provides that “ in any contested case, all parties 
shall be afforded an opportunity for hearing after reasonable notice [,]” HRS 
§ 91-9(a), “[o] pportunities shall be afforded all parties to present evidence 
and argument on all issues involved [,]” HRS § 91-9(c), and “[n] o matters 
outside the record shall be considered by the agency in making its decision 
except as provided herein [,]” HRS §  91-9(g). 
HRS § 91-10(3) states, “ Every party shall have the right to 
conduct such cross -examination as may be req uired for a full and true 
disclosure of the facts, and shall have the right to submit rebuttal 
evidence .”

47 In the present case, the Planning Director’s actions --
his unilateral, nonp ublic communication with Bolton, without the 
knowledge or input of Hualalai, a party that he knew had already 
formally requested to intervene in the proceeding --did not 
facilitate a “full and true disclosure of the facts”  before a 
final decision was render ed on Special Permit Application No. 
SPP-16-188, as chapter 91 requires.  HRS § 91-10(3).  Although 
the Planning Director necessarily exercises  some discretion in  
performing his duties under the  general grant of authority by 
the Hawaiʻi County Charter,  the Zoning Code, and state law to 
“administer ” and “enforce” the zoning laws, ordinances, and 
regulations ,31 he exceeded the boundaries of this discretion  by 
precluding Hualalai from participating in a contested case 
proceeding  for Specia l Permit Application No. SPP -16-188.   
Appellees contend that  the LPC did not abuse its 
discretion when it “elected to let [the proceeding] lie as a 
closed matter ” because “[Bolton]  voluntarily abandoned its 
                     
(. . . continued) 
 
HRS § 91-13 prohibits an “official of an agency who renders a 
decision in a contested case” from “consult[ing] any person on any issue of 
fact except upon notice and opportunity for all parties to participate .” 
 
31  See CCH § 6-7.2(b)(5) (“The [planning] director shall  . . . 
[a]dminister the subdivision and zoning ordinances and regulations adopted 
thereunde r.”); HCC § 25 -2-1(b) (“The [planning] director shall enforce all 
other provisions of this chapter pertaining to land use .”).  The Planning  
Director is also responsible for “enforc[ing]  . . . the use classification 
districts adopted by the land use commission and the restriction on use and 
the condition relating to agricultural district s[.]”  HRS § 205 -12.

48 pursuit of a special use permit [.]”  This mis characterizes  the 
facts:  the Planning Director’s September 21, 2016 letter to 
Bolton advised, “your Special Permit application will be 
withdrawn from further processing[.]”  The Planning Director’s 
September 21 letter  is the first time withdrawal of Special 
Permit Application No. SPP -16-188 is mentioned.  Bolton did not 
initiate the withdrawal  by “voluntarily abandon[ing]” its 
application ; the Planning Director was the initiat or.  There is 
no LPC Rule specifying who can withdraw a special permit 
application, or when a withdrawal can occur.  However, LPC Rule 
4-6 sets forth a procedure that requires the LPC to 
“establish []” the parties and resolve any  petition s to intervene 
“prior to any further action ” in the contested case proceeding .  
Hualalai was  therefore  entitled to a decision on its petition 
before Appellees took any further action --such as withdrawing 
the application --in the proceeding .  LPC Rule 4 -6 unambiguously 
states that the LPC “will grant or deny [a] written request [to 
intervene] prior to any fur ther action on the matter .”  Thus, 
the LPC’s  failure to grant or deny Hualalai’s  petition  was 
arbitrary and capricious, and constituted  an abuse of 
discretion .   
IV. CONCLUSION  
Appellees ’ aforementioned actions in this case --the 
Planning Director’s extensive ex parte communication with Bolton  
 
 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
49  
 
 
 
 that culminated in his decision to withdraw Special Permit 
Application No. SPP -16-188, and the LPC’s failure to issue a 
decision on Hualalai’s petition and its decision to treat the 
proceeding for Special Permit Applicatio n No. SPP -16-188 as a 
closed matter --were made upon unlawful procedure in violation of 
HRS § 91-14(g)(3) and constitute d abuses of discretion in 
violation of HRS § 91-14(g)(3)(6).  Therefore, pursuant to HRS 
§ 91-14(g), remand is appropriate.   Accordingly , this case is 
remanded to the LPC for further proceedings  consistent with this 
opinion.
