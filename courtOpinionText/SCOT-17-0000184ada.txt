OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J.  
  When this court first considered this case over a 
decade ago, we vacated the issuance of two water use permits and 
remanded the matter to the State of Hawai i Commission on Water 
Resource Management (Commission)  for further proceedings.  On 
remand, parties indicating that they were the applicant’s 
successors  in interest submitted a letter to the Commission 
stating that they lacked the financial resources to continue to 
pursue the case.  When these same parties filed a new water use Electronically Filed

2 application years later, the Commission initially treated it as 
a continuation of the remanded case before 
concluding  that the 
letter had constituted a waiver of the applicants’ right to 
continue the original proceedings.  
The applicants now challenge 
this conclusion, arguing that the letter was at best ambiguous 
as to their intention to relinquish the rights at issue.  
Because we hold that the Commission did not err in finding that 
the letter was a clear and unambiguous waiver of the right to 
proceed on the contested case , we affirm. 
I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
A. In Re Kukui (Molokai), Inc. 
 On May 13, 1992,  the Commission designated Moloka i as 
a water management area.1  The designation took effect on July 
15, 1992, thereby triggering a one- year period during which all 
existing users of water from  the area’s aquifers were required 
to submit applications for existing water use permits, which if 
granted would entitle the permittee to continue utilizing the 
approved amount of water.  See HRS § 174C- 50(c) (1993).  
Approximately a year later, o n June 8, 1993, the Commission 
accepted a joint existing water use permit application submitted 
                                                           
 1 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 174C -41(a) (1987) provides  that 
the Commission shall designate areas “threatened by existing or proposed 
withdrawals” as water management areas “to ensure reasonable -beneficial use 
of the water resources in the public interest.”  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
3 by Molokai Irrigation System and Moloka i Ranch that sought to 
pump water from Well No. 0901- 01 (Well 17) .2  In 1993, however, 
ownership of the land overlying Well 17 was transferred to Kukui 
(Molokai), Inc. (Kukui).3 
 In light of this transfer, Kukui  submitted its own 
existing use application on December 15, 1993,  seeking to divert 
2 million gallons of water a day (gpd) from Well 17 .  Although 
the statutory one-year period for submitting existing use 
applications had expired, the Commission treated Kukui’s 
application as timely, considering it an amendment to the 
existing use application submitted by Moloka i Irrigation System 
and Moloka i Ranch rather than as a new application.    
  After several revisions, the Commission responded to 
Kukui’s application on March 14, 1995,  by authoriz ing an interim 
use permit of 871,420 gpd and deferring  final action until all 
existing uses could be established.  Approximately a year later, 
the Commission reviewed a staff recommendation to amend the 
interim permit to increase Kukui’s allowable withdrawal to 1.169 
million gpd.  Th e Commission rejected the recommendation and 
reaffirmed the March 14, 1995 interim existing use allocation of 
                                                           
 2 Well 17 draws water from  the Kualapu u Aquifer on the island of 
Molokai.  
 3 At the time, Kukui was the owner of Kaluako i Resort.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
4 871,420 gpd.  Kukui requested a contested case hearing 
challenging this decision.   
  Prior to commencement of the contested case  hearing, 
the Department of Hawaiian Home  Lands (DHHL), the Office of 
Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), and individuals Sarah Sykes, Judy 
Caparida, and Georgina Kuahuia were granted permission to 
intervene.   The hearing was held over the course of eight days 
beginning on November 23 , 1998.  The Commission issued its final 
“Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision and Order” 
on December 19, 2001  (2001 Order), awarding K ukui an existing 
use permit authorizing the withdrawal of 936,000 gpd  and a 
proposed new use permit authorizing the withdrawal of an 
additional 82,000 gpd.    
  DHHL, OHA, Caparida, and Kuahuia ( collectively, the 
Intervenors) appealed from the 2001 Order.  During the pendency 
of the appeal, Kaluakoi Land LLC (K aluakoi Land), a wholly -owned 
subsidiary of Molokai Properties Limited ( Molokai Properties ), 
acquired the assets of Kukui and was substituted as a party for 
Kukui.   
  On appeal, this court held that, because  Kukui’s 
request for an existing use  permit should have been treated a s a 
new existing use application rather than an amendment to the 
original application , it was untimely, thus rendering the 
existing use permit void .  In the Matter of the Contested Case ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
5 Hearing on the Water Use Permit Application Filed by Kukui 
(Molokai), Inc., 116 Hawai i 481, 501, 174 P.3d 320, 340 (2007) 
(hereafter In Re Kukui (Molokai), Inc.) .  Accordingly, the 
existing water uses at issue were “presumed abandoned ,” we 
concluded, and Kaluakoi Land was required to apply for a new use 
permit under HRS § 174C- 51 if it sought to “‘revive’ these 
expired uses.”4  Id.  This court further held  that the Commission 
had erred in granting  Kukui the additional proposed new use 
permit because the Commission had , inter alia, failed to apply 
the requisite level of scrutiny and impermissibly shifted the 
burden of demonstrating that the use would interfere with 
constitutional public trust purposes onto the intervenors.  Id. 
at 506-08 , 174 P.3d at 345- 47.  We therefore vacated the 
Commission’s 2001 Order and remanded the case for further 
proceedings consistent with the opinion. 
B. Remand Before the Commission 
  On remand, the Commission issued a “Minute Order 
Setting Status Conference” on February 25, 2008 , to which 
Kaluakoi Land did not respond.5  In its place, Molokai Properties 
                                                           
 4 This portion of the In Re Kukui (Molokai), Inc.  opinion makes 
reference to Kukui instead of its successor in interest, Kaluakoi Land .  See 
116 Hawai‘ i at 501, 174 P.3d at 340 . 
 
 5 Although the parties refer to the “Minute Order Setting Status 
Conference” numerous times in their subsequent filings, the February 25 
Minute Order itself is absent from the record.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
6 filed a joint Status Conference Statement with its wholly- owned 
subsidiaries Kaluakoi Water LLC (Kaluakoi Water)6 and Molokai 
Public Utilities, Inc. (MPU).7  The Intervenors also filed a 
Joint Status Conference Statement.  The Commission held the 
status conference on March 3, 2008, to discuss the hearing on 
remand.  On March 10, 2008
, the Commission direct ed the 
Intervenors to submit “memoranda regarding their respective 
position[s] on the scope of the hearing on remand ” by May 2, 
2008.  In addition, the Commission directed MPU, Molokai 
Properties, and Kaluakoi Water to (1) file a separate pleading 
identifying Kukui ’s successor -in-interest that w ould be the 
applicant on the amended permit application8 and (2) respond to 
the Intervenors’ memoranda regarding the scope of the hearing by 
June 16, 2008.   
 
 On March 24, 2008, however, Molokai Properties 
announced its intention to shut down operations via a press 
release and an internal memor andum circulated to its employees.  
When the Intervenors submitted a joint “Memorandum Regarding 
                                                           
 6 Kaluakoi Water is a wholly- owned subsidiary of Kaluakoi Land, 
which as stated is itself a wholly -owned subsidiary of Molokai Properties.   
 7 MPU is a licensed public utility and wholly owned subsidiary of 
Kaluakoi Water that provides water in the Kaluako i area of West Molokai.   
 8 Although the Commission refers to the “amended permit 
application,” this court expressly required the former applicant  to submit a 
new application on remand if it sought to revive expired uses.  In Re Kukui 
(Molokai), Inc., 116 Hawai i at 501, 174 P.3d at 340.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
7 Scope of Hearing on Remand” on May 2, 2008,  it was accompanied 
by a “Joint Motion to  Dismiss in Part Molokai Properties , 
Limited’s Application  for Water Use  Permit” (Motion to Dismiss)  
which sought  to dismiss the application based on Molokai 
Properties ’ upcoming cessation of operations.   Neither Molokai 
Properties , MPU, nor Kaluakoi Water  filed any response to the 
Intervenors’ memorandum  or to the Motion to Dismiss . 
  On May 27, 2008, Molokai Proper ties informed the 
Commission  by letter  that MPU “[did] not intend to continue to 
pursue this case on remand”  (May 27 l etter).  Molokai Properties  
disclosed that it had been operating MPU at a loss for years and 
was shutting down its operations due to insolvency.  The letter 
stated in relevant part as follows:  
This letter is to inform you that Molokai Public Utilities 
(MPU) does not intend to continue to pursue this case on 
remand.  As has been discussed with staff and the [Public 
Utilities Commission] , MPU has been operating at a 
significant loss for several years and is essentially 
insolvent.  
. . . . 
As a result of this insolvency, we do not have the 
resources to pursue this very expensive  remand proceeding . 
. . . We are actively seeking a new owner for MPU that will 
have the resources to continue operation and hopefully, 
they will be capable of resolving this matter.  However, as 
previously stated, we cannot actively pursue this matter 
before the Commission.  
  In a second letter dated May 30, 2008  (May 30 l etter), 
Molokai Properties  informed the Public Utilities Commission 
(PUC) that MPU would cease providing water utilities to West ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
8 Molokai by the end of August 2008.  MPU further stated that it 
did not have the funds to make a reapplication for a permit to 
operate Well 17 and that there would “probably” be an 
unavoidable termination of service to customers unless another 
entity was located to take over operations.  
 
  
In response, the PUC ordered a temporary rate increase 
to enable MPU to continue operating until it transferred its 
Certification of Public Convenience and Necessity to another 
entity.9  Additionally, the Director of Health issued an order on 
July 21, 2008, r equiring Molokai Properties and MPU to continue 
to provide drinking water and wastewater systems for ninety days 
to prevent “imminent peril to the public health and safety.”  
Molokai Properties and its subsidiaries continued to operate and 
utilize water from Well 17 without a water use permit for 
several years. 
C. MPU’s New Application  
  
In December 2012, MPU filed an application for a new 
ground water u se permit (MPU’s application)  seeking to withdraw 
1,026,518 gpd from Well 17.10  The Commission worked with MPU 
over the next few years to assist it in completing the 
                                                           
 9 The Certification of Public Convenience and Necessity essentially 
gave MPU an exclusive right to operate water utilities in specific regions on 
Molokai and charge rates approved by the PUC.  
 10 The application itself is absent from the record.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
9 application , formally accept ing the completed application on 
October 12, 2015.   The application  was not served upon the other 
parties to the 1997 contested case.  
  On October 20, 2015, the Commission informed DHHL by 
letter that it, MPU, and the Maui Department of Water Supply 
(MDWS) all had pending ground water use permit application s that 
were potentially competing for water access, and the Commission 
therefore intended to consolidate the applications  and 
incorporate them  into the original  contested case proceeding 
that had continued after this court’s remand in In Re Kukui 
(Molokai), Inc.   On October 23 and 30, 2015, the Commission 
published a notice inviting affected persons to object or 
comment on MPU’s application , stating that “[t]his case will 
continue as a contested case hearing, and parties previously 
involved in the contested case he aring culminati[ng] in the 
December 19, 2001 Decision & Order shall respond in writing of 
their intention to continue in the case or to withdraw.”   On 
October 30, 2015, the Commission issued a minute order in the 
original contested case docket setting a st atus conference for 
November 9, 2015 , which was served upon  MPU, Kaluakoi Land , the 
Intervenors, and MDWS.   
  Thereafter, at a hearing held on February 16, 2016, 
testimony was presented regarding the propriety of handling 
MPU’s application as part of the original contested case rather ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
10 than as a distinct new matter.  On March 7, 2016, the Commission 
issued a minute order stating that the parties w ould be 
permitted to submit briefs and present oral arguments to address 
whether,  pursuant to this court’s order remand ing the case for 
further proceedings and in light of  In Re Wai ola O Moloka i, 103 
Hawaii 401, 83 P.3d 664 (2004), the original contested case 
hearing should continue or be dismissed.  Briefs were filed by 
MPU, the Intervenors, and MDWS,  and the Commission heard oral 
argument on April 19, 2016.    
  Before the Commission, the Interven ors and MDWS argued  
that the Commission should formally deny the outstanding two -
decade-old Kukui application, officially dismiss the 1997 
contested case, and treat MPU’s 2014 application as a new, 
separate application.  The Intervenors  and MDWS contended that 
MPU waived any interest it had in the 1997 proceedings through 
its May 27 letter.11   
                                                           
 11 Though making substantially the same argument, DHHL and OHA 
characterize MPU’s letter as an abandonment rather than a waiver.  
Additionally, Caparida and K uahuia argued that, because Molokai Properties 
and its subsidiaries did not respond to the Commission’s directive to file 
pleadings identifying Kukui and Kaluakoi Land’s successor in interest, they 
were never formally substituted for the original applicant, and therefore MPU 
had no recognized interest in the 2007 proceeding to waive.  At oral argument 
in this case, however, Caparida and Kuahuia acknowledged that MPU had the 
“technical right” to seek review of the Commission’s dismissal order. Oral 
Argument at 47:08, In the Matter of the Contested Case Hearing on the Water 
Use Permit Application Originally Filed by Kukui (Molokai), Inc., Now Refiled 
as a New Ground Use by Molokai Public Utilities, LLC.  (No. SCOT- 17-0000184), 
http://oaoa.hawaii.gov/jud/oa/18/SCOA_053118_SCOT_17_184.mp3.  Therefore this 
issue will not be further addressed. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
11   The Interven ors and MDWS  also asserted that the facts 
and circumstances surrounding K ukui’s 1993 application ha d 
significantly changed , especially in light of the two competing 
water use applications that were n ow under consideration,  and 
the Commission’s findings in the case were accordingly  outdated 
and no longer  relevant to MPU’s  application .  Further, they 
contended, considering MPU’s application for the new ground use 
water permit within the context of the original contested case 
hearing would deprive the public and other interested parties of 
the opportunity to meaningful ly participate in the hearing,  and 
relying on the Commission’s 2001 Order would violate the basic 
elements of procedural due process by im properly and 
prejudicially binding the new parties to an old record  that they 
did not participate in developing.    
  They additionally argued that the holding in In Re 
Kukui (Molokai), Inc.  had settled all issues regarding Kukui’s 
1993 permit application a nd thus rendered the original contested 
case moot.  And, they concluded, the Commission ’s and MPU’s 
conduct in relation to the application --which included a failure 
to serve the application on the other parties to the 1997 
contested case hearing and an initial refusal to allow the other 
parties access to relevant filings upon request --indicated that 
MPU’s application was an entirely new and separate matter  from 
the 1997 contested case .   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
12   In response , MPU contended that it was a valid party 
to the case as the successor to Kaluakoi Land and that it had 
complied with th is court’s order directing that a new 
application be filed under HRS § 174C-51 on remand .  MPU further 
asserted that it did not abandon its right to participate i n the 
contested case  because the May 27 letter represented MPU’s hope 
to pursue the matter in the future when it had the funds.  MPU 
argued that the elapsed time since the commencement of the 
contested case was not unreasonable because it “was spent in 
administrative and judicial review of the requested water uses” 
and, in any event, the case could not  be dismissed on this 
ground alone.    
  MPU further argued that the Commission lacked the 
discretion to dismiss the contested case in light of the court’s 
order to vacate and remand in In Re Kukui (Molokai), Inc.   The 
supreme court stated that the case should continue, MPU argued, 
and the parties should not  have to re -prove findings o f fact 
that were not disturbed i n that appeal. 
  Finally, MPU emphasized that introducing new parties 
and evidence on remand for a contested case is not impractical 
or unworkable but rather quite common.  MPU claimed that this 
practice would not deprive any  party of the opportunity to 
participate in the matter and introduce new evidence because the 
Commission’s Public Notice expressly requested that “[n]ew ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
13 parties wishing to intervene should file their objections.”12  
Therefore, MPU stated, the parties’ participation would not be 
limited if the case were continued.  E ven if binding the new 
parties to the original record was problematic, MPU contended,  
the continuation of the contested case and the consolidation of 
the applications were separate issues, and the case could be 
continued without the addition of the other parties.    
D. The Commission’s Order Dismissing the Contested Case  
  O n February 17, 2017, the Commission issued an Order 
Dismissing the Contested Case.  The Commission fo und that “MPU 
waived its right to continue this contested case when it 
submitted the May 27, 2008 letter to the Commission that clearly 
stated that it did not intend to pursue the case on remand.”  
MPU’s subsequent communications supported this interpretat ion of 
the letter, the Commission stated,  citing as an example the May 
30 letter to the PUC that notified the State of Hawai i, County 
of Maui, and all MPU customers of Molokai Properties ’ intent to 
cease operating MPU in August 2008.  The Commission stated that 
it was “not reasonable for MPU to believe that it can undo its 
                                                           
 12 In its initial brief, MPU made three additional arguments arguing 
against dismissal.  MPU argued that dismissal would: (1) result in piecemeal 
appeals; (2) be inconsistent with the Commission’s actions, including 
notifying the parties and the public that the contested case hearing was 
continuing; and (3) be inconsistent with the Commission’s actions in other 
similar contested case hearings.  However, none of these arguments are 
presented on appeal and are therefore not furthered addressed.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
14 clear expression that it did not want to pursue the contested 
case by filing a new use water permit application four years 
later.”   Responding to MPU’s argument that the outstandin g 
applications involved issues that had either been resolved in 
the 1997 contested case or remanded in In Re Kukui (Molokai), 
Inc., the Commission encouraged the parties to stipulate to 
uncontroverted facts in future proceedings when  possible and 
stated that it would follow this court’s guidance in any future 
decision making. 
 MPU filed a timely appeal directly to this court 
pursuant to HRS § 174C- 60 (2011 ). 
II. ARGUMENTS ON APPEAL 
 On appeal, MPU challenges the Commission’s findings on 
the basis that, whether express or implied, a waiver of rights 
must be clear and unambiguous.  The May 27 letter was “at best” 
equivocal, MPU argues, and it thus cannot constitute a waiver.   
  MPU contends that the May 27 letter merely stated  
“that the current owner [of MPU] would not actively pursue the 
matter and [] the future owner may, ” which left an “‘opportunity 
for a reasonable inference’ that MPU did not intend to waive its 
right to continue with the contested case.”  Rather, MPU 
asserts,  the language of the May 27 let ter is best understood as 
a request for a stay of proceedings, which “is effectively what ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
15 happened.”13  This interpretation is supported by its  continued 
operations after the May 27 letter pursuant to the Department of 
Health order, MPU argues, as well as its  submission of a new 
water use permit application,  which together indicate that the 
letter was not expressing an intent to abandon the matters at 
issue in the contested case.  Similarly, MPU notes that after 
receiving the May 27 letter, the Commission did not dismiss the 
original contested case but rather kept the case on its docket 
and processed the new application under the same case number.  
MPU concludes that these acts, collectively, demonstrate that 
the May 27 letter was ambiguous and therefore did not constitute 
a waiver. 
  MPU  also contends that it will suffer prejudice as a 
result of the Commission’s dismissal of the contested case.  MPU 
argues that the record developed in the 2001 “Findings of Fact” 
was not disturbed i n the previous appeal becau se this court 
vacated the 2001 Decision and Order only “to the extent it 
grant[ed] [MPU] a permit for existing uses.”14  (Quoting In Re 
                                                           
 13 Although this argument appears to have been raised for the first 
time in MPU’s reply brief, we do not find it necessary to determine whether 
the issue of a stay was properly preserved given our disposition of the case.  
See Hawaii Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4).   
 14 In In Re Kukui (Molokai), Inc., this court expressly stated that 
“we [also] vacate the Commission’ s Decision and Order to the extent that it 
grants KMI a permit for proposed uses.”  116 Hawai ‘i at 506, 174 P.3d at 345 
(emphasis added). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
16 Kukui (Molokai), Inc. , 116 Hawai ‘i at 501, 174 P.3d at 340.)   
“MPU should not be forced to relitigate  facts and issues” that 
are essential to its new use application , it argues . 
  In response,  the Interveno rs and MDWS  reiterate their 
arguments before the Commission.  Additionally , Caparida and 
Kuahuia argue that, even assuming the Commission erred in 
finding a waiver, the Commission still acted within its 
discretion because, inter alia, the new use permit and the 
contested case should be adjudicated under different standards 
and the Commission’s findings under the contested case, 
including MPU’s water usage, are outdated.    
  MPU replies that this court’s order in In Re Kukui 
(Molokai), Inc.  clearly contemplated that the contested case 
would continue notwithstanding the need to evaluate the 
application under a different standard.  MPU further argues tha t 
the Commission ’s finding s remain relevant despite the passage of 
time and  points out  the Commission  did not state that it was 
exercising its  discretion to control its docket when it 
dismissed the contested case.  This alternative reasoning 
therefore cannot now justify affirming the decision on appeal , 
MPU concludes .  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
17 III.    STANDARDS OF REVIEW  
  The issue of whether a waiver exists i s “generally a 
question of fact.”15  Coon v. City & Cty.  of Honolulu , 98 Hawai i 
233, 261–62, 47 P.3d 348, 376 –77 (2002) (citing Hawaiian Homes 
Comm’n v. Bush, 43 Haw. 281, 286 (Haw. Terr. 1959)).  Findings 
of fact are reviewable under the clearly erroneous standard.  
Korean Buddhist Dae Won Sa Temple of Hawaii v. Sullivan, 87 
Hawaii 217, 229, 953 P.2d 1315, 1327 (1998) (citation omitted); 
Bragg v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,  81 Hawaii 302, 304 -05, 
916 P.2d 1203, 1205 -06 (1996).   The court will vacate  findings 
under the clearly erroneous standard “if [the] court is left 
with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been 
made.”  DeFries v. Ass’ n of Owners, 999 Wilder, 57 Haw. 296, 
302–03, 555 P.2d 855, 859 (1976) (citation omitted).  
  “[W]hen the facts [underlying a waiver] are undisputed 
it may become a question of law.” Coon, 98 Hawai‘i at 262, 47 
P.3d at 377 (quoting Bush , 43 Haw. at 286).  “Questions of law 
are reviewable de novo under the right/wrong standard of 
review.”  Bank of Hawaii v. DeYoung , 92 Hawai ‘i 347, 351, 992 
                                                           
 15 MPU contends that a waiver must be unambiguous and, relying on 
several cases concerning the interpretation of contracts, argues that whether 
a document like the May 27 letter is ambiguous is a question of law that is 
reviewable de novo.  (Citing, inter alia, Gustafson v. Fukino, Civil No. 09 -
00565 SOM/KSC, 2010 WL 2900434, at *2 (D. Haw. Jul. 20, 2010).)  Whether a 
contract between private parties is ambiguous is a different question than 
whether a party has waived a procedural right in an agency adjudication, 
however, and we find these cases inapposite.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
18 P.2d 42, 46 (2000) (quoting Ditto v. McCurdy, 90 Hawai ‘i 345, 
351, 978 P.2d 783, 789 (1999)).  
IV. DISCUSSION 
A. The Commission Did Not Err in Finding MPU Expressly Waived 
its Right to Proceed With the Contested Case By  its May 27 
Letter. 
  MPU challenges the Commission’s conclusion i n its 
Order Dismissing the Contested Case that “MPU waived its right 
to continue this contested case when it submitted the May 27, 
2008 letter to the Commission that clearly stated it did not 
intend to pursue this case on remand.”   As we have long held, a 
waiver is either “a  voluntary and intentional relinquishment of 
a known right[] or such conduct as warrants an inference of the 
relinquishment of such right.”   Hewahewa v. Lalakea, 35 Haw. 
213, 218 (Haw. Terr. 1939)  (internal quotations and alterations 
omitted).  This to say that, although a waiver must be knowing 
and intentional, it “may be expressed or implied, ” meaning “it 
may be established by express statement or agreement, or by acts 
and conduct from which an intention to waive may be reasonably 
inferred.”  Coon v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 98 Hawai i 233, 261, 
47 P.3d 348, 376 (2002) (citations and internal quotation marks 
omitted).   
  By stating in its order that MPU’s May 27 letter 
“clearly stated it did not intend to pursue this case on 
remand,” the Commission indicated that it had found an express ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
19 waiver of MPU’s right to continue the contested case.  We 
therefore consider whether MPU’s May 27 letter constituted a 
waiver through an “express statement or agreement.”  Id.  at 261, 
47 P.3d at 376 (citations omitted).  
  MPU ’s May 27 letter began by  stating, “This letter is 
to inform you that Molokai Public Utilities (MPU) does not 
intend to continue to pursue this case on remand .”  This 
statement clearly reflects MPU’s knowledge of its right to 
pursue the case on remand,  and it unambiguously indicates MPU’s  
intention to relinquish that  right, thus satisfying the key 
elements of a waiver.16  See Coon, 98 Hawai i at 261-62, 47 P.3d 
at 376-77 (“[W]aiver is defined as an intentional relinquishment 
of a known right . . . .  To constitute a waiver . . . the 
waiving party must have had knowledge, actual or constructive, 
of the existence of such a right at the time of the purported 
                                                           
 16 As discussed supra, note 15, MPU relies primarily on cases from 
other jurisdictions interpreting parties’ contractual obligations to argue 
that a waiver must be unambiguous and unequivocal.  (Citing, inter alia, 
Office of the Att’y Gen. v. Tennessee Regulatory Auth. , No. M2003 -01363-CAO-
R12-CV, 2005 WL 3193684, at *12 (Tenn. Ct. App. Nov. 29, 2005);  In re Nw. 
Liquor Indus., Inc., 107 B.R. 616, 619 (Bankr. W.D. Wis. 1988); Meyer v. Mack 
Motor Trucks, Inc., 141 So.2d 427, 429 (La. Ct. App. 1962).)  We have indeed 
often held that a party’s relinquishment of constitutional rights must be 
clear and unmistakable.  See, e.g., State v. Deming, 137 Hawai‘ i 18, 364 P.3d 
535 (2015) (right to counsel); Lii v. Sida of Hawaii, Inc., 53 Haw. 353, 355, 
493 P.2d 1032, 1034 (1972) (right to trial by jury).  Thus far, however, we 
have not applied the same high standard to the waiver of what appears to be a 
purely procedural right in an administrative adjudication.  Because we find 
that in any event MPU unambiguously and unequivocally communicated a waiver 
of its right to proceed with the contested case, we need not now decide 
whether the high standard we have articulated in other contexts would 
otherwise apply in this setting . ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
20 waiver.”).  This court need not speculate as to  MPU’s genuine 
intention because MPU expressed its intent by using the word 
“intend.”  Thus, MPU’s statement that it  did not intend to 
“continue  to pursue this case” is a clear represent ation that 
MPU would no longer continue  to pursue a new use permit to 
revive expired uses  through the remanded case.   
  Other statements made in the May 27 letter underscore  
MPU’s intent to relinquish its right to the contested case  
proceeding .  The letter stated that “we do not have the 
resources  to pursue this very expensive remand proceeding” and 
“we cannot  actively pursue this matter before the Commission.”   
The language “we do not have the resources” and “we cannot 
actively pursue” unequivocally expresses that MPU could not  and 
would not  pursue the case on remand.   
  MPU contends that its state ment that, “We are actively 
seeking a new owner for MPU that will have the resources to 
continue operation and hopefully, they will be c apable of 
resolving this matter,” indicates that although Molokai 
Properties , as the current owner , would not pursue the matter , a 
future owner m ight resume the contested case at a later date .  
While MPU points to  the stated efforts to find a new owner  that 
would have had the resources to  continue operations, even that 
speculation is couched as a “hope” that if a new  owner was 
found, that owner  would “be capable of resolving the matter.”   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
21 Moreover, the next sentence of the letter emphasizes that, 
“However, as previously stated,  we cannot actively pursue this 
matter before the Commission.”  Thus, the May 27 letter  
unequivocally stated that MPU did not intend  to go forward with 
the contested case , which constitutes an express waiver of MPU’s 
right to proceed with  the contested case.   
  Not surprisingly, t he Commission reached the same 
conclusio n in its Order Dismissing the Contested Case .  The 
Commission determined that “MPU waived its right to continue 
this contested case when it submitted the May 27, 2008 lette r to 
the Commission that clearly stated that it did not intend to 
pursue this case on remand.”   The Commission found that “the 
wording of the letter itself . . . supports the interpretation 
that MPU had no intent to continue to provide water service on 
Molokai and  . . . was waiving its request for a contested case 
on remand. ”  Further, the Commission found that MPU’s statement 
that it was looking for a new owner “does not indicate that the 
contested case would continue to be pursued ,” which was 
confirmed  by the May 27 letter’s reiteration  that “as previously 
stated, [MPU] cannot pursue this matter before the Commission.”  
  The Commission duly considered  the May 27 letter  that 
it had received regarding MPU’s intentions and determine d that 
MPU had expressly relinquished its right to continue with the 
contested case.   Therefore, t he Commission’s finding of a waiver ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
22 of MPU’s right to continue the contested case was not clearly 
erroneous or wrong as the  letter unequivocally stated that it 
did “not intend to continue to pursue this case on remand.”17  
B. The May 27 Letter Was Not a Request for a Stay. 
  MPU belatedly asserts in its reply brief to this court 
that the May 27 letter was an inartful request for a stay of 
proceedings.18  A “stay” is defined as “1. The postponement or 
halting of a proceeding . . . . [or] 2. An order to suspend all 
or part of a judicial proceeding . . . .”  Black’s Law 
Dictionary 1639 (10th ed. 2014).    
  Despite MPU’s contention, t he May 27 letter does not 
contain any indicia of a request for a stay.  As an initial 
matter, the May 27 letter does not contain a 
statement that 
                                                           
 17 Even if the statements in MPU’s May 27 letter had been 
insufficient to constitute a waiver in their own right, an implied waiver may 
be made “by acts and conduct from which an intention to waive may be 
reasonably inferred.”  Coon, 98 Hawai‘ i at 261, 47 P.3d at 376 (citations 
omitted).  At the time that MPU sent the May 27 letter, MPU was still under 
an obligation to reply to the Interven ors’ motion to dismiss by June 16, 
2008, and to comply with the Commission’s minute order directing it to file a 
separate pleading identifying Kukui’s successor -in-interest.  MPU never made 
either filing.  A reasonable inference stemming from this inaction is that 
after MPU notified the Commission that it “[did] not intend to continue to 
pursue this case on remand,” MPU no longer felt  obligated to participate in 
the proceedings by responding to the Intervenors’ memoranda or complying with 
the Commission’s Minute Order of March 10, 2008.  Thus, as a permit applicant 
that could choo se to reapply at any time, MPU’s intent to waive its rig ht to 
pursue the case on remand “may be reasonably inferred” by these cumulative 
actions, which would accordingly constitute  an implied waiver.  Id.    
 18 MPU also relied significantly on this characterization of the 
letter during oral argument before this court.  See Oral Argument at 13:10 -
14:40, In the Matter of the Contested Case Hearing on the Water Use Permit 
Application Originally Filed by Kukui (Molokai), Inc., Now Refiled as a New 
Ground Use by Molokai Public Utilities, LLC.  (No. SCOT- 17-0000184), 
http://oaoa.hawaii.gov/jud/oa/18/SCOA_053118_SCOT_17_184.mp3.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
23 could be understood as a “request .”  A “request” is  “[a] motion 
by which a member invokes a right, seeks permission for the 
exercise of a privilege, or asks a question.”   Black’s Law 
Dictionary  1497 (10th ed. 2014) .  The May 27 letter neither 
attempts to invoke a right, seek permission, nor ask a question.  
Rather the letter ’s purpose is  “to inform” the Commission of its 
intent not to pursue  the case on remand.   As discussed supra, 
this language is consistent with an express statement that MPU 
could not and would not proceed on remand.    
  Additionally , the May 27 letter does not satisfy the 
procedural requirements for motions set forth by the Commission 
under Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) § 13-167-58(a).  
Pursuant to HAR § 13-167-58(a), “All motions other than those 
made during a hearing shall be made in writing to the 
commission, shall state the relief sought, and shall be 
accompanied by an affidavit or memorandum setting forth the 
grounds upon which they are based.”   Here, the May 27 letter does 
not state the relief sought --which would presumably be a stay if 
it were intended as M PU now claims .  Similarly, the May 27 
letter is unaccompanied by, and fails to state, grounds for the 
purported  request for a stay.  And, merely disclosing financial 
difficulties and the “hope” that a successor in interest will be 
able resolve the matter is insufficient to constitute either a 
request for a stay or grounds in support thereof.  Furthermore, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
24 assuming without deciding that the Commission has the authority 
to grant an indefinite stay  of the type MPU appears to 
contemplate, the record does not demonstrate that the Commission 
treated the May 27 letter as a request for a stay or that it 
ruled on such a request.  Thus, we hold that the May 27 letter 
was not a request for a stay and that no stay was considered or 
granted in the contested case.  
V. CONCLUSION 
  Based on the foregoing, the Commission ’s finding that 
MPU waived its right to continue the contested case was not 
clearly erroneous or wrong and therefore we affirm the circuit 
court’s 
Order Dismissing the Contested Case.
