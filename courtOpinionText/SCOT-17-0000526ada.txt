2 of its administrative order issued almost thirty years earlier , 
it did not mean “potable” by any  common definition of the term.  
Instead, the Land U se Commission  found that the term was 
intended to carry a special meaning that the Commission does not 
define--other than to say it excludes brackish water that 
contains chlorides over 
an unspecified leve l.  Based upon this 
special interpretation of “potable,” the Land Use Commission 
determined that the resort had not violated the administrative 
order.  But neither the text of its administrative order nor the 
circumstances in which it was adopted offer any reason to depart 
from the plain meaning of the condition, which was intended to 
prohibit the resort from watering its golf course with water 
that is suitable for drinking under 
county water quality 
standards.  This plain meaning is consistent with the common 
meaning of “potable” that this court recognized in its previous 
ruling in this case
 and serves to fulfill the constitutional 
duties with which the Land Use Commission is presumed to have 
complied.   
  W e thus conclude that the Land Use Commission erred in 
its 2017 Order by interpreting a condition in its administrative 
order to mean that brackish water  is per se “non-potable.”  
Accordingly, we also consider whether the Commission erred in 
determining that the 
resort did not violate th is condition under 
its plain meaning, which prohibits the utiliz ation for golf ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
3 course irrigation water suitable for drinking under the county’s 
water quality standards. 
I. BACKGROUND 
A. The Initial Proceedings and the 1991 LUC Order 
  This case 
began in November 1989, when Lāna ʻi Resorts 
(the Resort) filed a Petition for Land Use District Boundary 
Amendment (Petition) 
with the Land Use Commission of the State 
of Hawaiʻi (LUC).1  The Petition sought “to effect district 
reclassification” of a large tract  of rural and agri cultural 
land so that the Resort could build an eighteen-hole golf course 
in Mānele
 on the island of Lāna ʻi.  The LUC permitted Lānaʻians 
for Sensible Growth (LSG) to intervene in the matter.2  In April 
1991, after six days of hearings, the LUC issued an order 
approving the Resort’s Petition  subject to several conditions 
(1991 LUC Order).  Among these conditions was Condition 10, 
which gave rise to the litigation now before this court.  
Condition 10 state
s that the Resort is not allowed to use 
potable water to irrigate the golf course:  
                    
 
 1 Several entities have owned the Resort since the original 
boundary amendment proceedings in 1989.  For clarity, these entities are 
collectively referred to as “the Resort.”   
 2 LSG is “an unincorporated association of Lanai residents” who 
“used the subject property for hiking, subsistence and recreational fishing, 
and for the enjoyment and appreciation of the ancient Hawaiian archaeological 
sites located there.”  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
4  10. [The Resort] shall not utilize the potable water 
from the high -level groundwater aquifer for golf course 
irrigation use, and shall instead develop and utilize only 
alternative non -potable sources of water (e.g., brackish 
water, reclaimed sewage effluent) for golf course 
irrigation requirements . 
 In addition, [the Resort] shall comply with the 
requirements imposed upon [it] by the State Commission on 
Water Resource Management  as outlined in the State 
Commission on Water Resource Management’s Resubmittal - 
Petition for Designating the Island of Lanai as a Water 
Management Area, dated March 29, 1990.  
(Emphasis added.)  The “Resubmittal” referred  to in the second 
paragraph of Condition 10 refers to the State Commission on 
Water Resource Management’s (CWRM)  March 1990 recommendation 
against designating the island of Lāna ʻi as a water management 
area.3   
B. The 1996 LUC Order 
  In October 1993, the LUC issued an Order to Show Cause 
(OSC) to the Resort, directing it to show why certain portions 
of its golf course should not revert to 
their former land use 
classification or otherwise be changed to a more appropriate 
classification.  The OSC stated that the LUC had reason to 
believe the Resort had failed to comply with Condition 10 ’s 
requirement that it develop and utilize alternative sources of 
non-potable water for golf course irrigation. 
                     
 3 In May 1989, the CWRM received a “petition to designate the 
Island of Lanai as a Water Management Area for the purpose of regulating the 
use of ground- water resources” because the “resort development on Lanai in 
the future would cause water demand to exceed the available water supply.”  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
5   Following twelve days of hearings regarding the OSC,  
the LUC issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and 
Decision and Order (1996 LUC Order) .  The LUC found that the 
Resort was irrigating the golf course primarily with  non-
potable, brackish water from two wells located within the high 
level aquifer: Well 1 and Well 9.4  The LUC concluded  that this 
use did not comply with Condition 10 and accordingly ordered the 
Resort to “immediately cease and desist any use of water from 
the high level aquifer for golf course irrigation requirements.”  
 
 The Resort appealed the LUC’s decision  to the Circuit 
Court of the Second Circuit, which reversed the 1996 LUC Order.  
See Lanai Co. v. Land Use Comm’n , 105 Hawai ʻi 296, 306, 97 P.3d 
372, 382 (2004).  We affirmed on review, ho lding that “the LUC 
erred in interpreting Condition No. 10 as precluding the use of 
‘any’ or all water from the high level aquifer.”  Id. at 319, 97 
P.3d at 395.  This court explained that Condition 10 bars the 
use of only potable water from the high-level aquifer, and it 
allows the Resort to use non -potable water for golf course 
irrigation.  Id. at 310, 97 P.3d at 386.  We stated that 
“potable” is ordinarily defined as “suitable for drinking” but 
                     
 4 Section 20.24.020 of the Maui County Code, the LUC noted, 
“define[d] potable water as water containing less than 250 milligram per 
liter of chlorides.”  Nonetheless, the LUC found that “[t]he potability of 
any water source does not depend on any particular level of chloride 
concentration.” ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
6 noted that the parties disagreed as to the meaning the 1991 LUC 
intended when it used the term in Condition 10.  Id.  at 299 n.8, 
97 P.3d at 375 n.8 (2004) (quoting We bster’s Seventh New 
Collegiate Dictionary 664 (1965)).   The evidence did not 
conclusively establish that the aquifer contained only potable 
water, we held, and, indeed, the LUC’s findings of fact 
“suggest
[ed] that the use of [Wells 1 and 9], and their brackish 
water supply, was permissible. ”  Id. at 313, 97 P.3d at 389.  
Because the 1996 LUC Order was ambiguous, we remanded the case 
to the LUC “for clarification of its findings  . . . as to 
whether [the Resort] used potable water from the high level 
aquifer, in violation of Condition No. 10.”  Id. at 319, 97 P.3d 
at 395. 
C. The 2010 LUC Order 
  O n remand in 2010, the LUC vacated its  1996 Order and 
granted the Resort’s Motion for Modification of Condition 10  
(2010 LUC Order).  The newly-modified Condition 10 provided, in 
relevant part, the following:
 
a. [The Resort] shall not use ground water to irrigate the 
Mānele Golf Course, driving range and other associated 
landscaping if the chloride concentration measured at the 
well head is 250 milligrams per liter (250 mg/l) or less.  
b. In the event the chloride concentration measurement of 
ground water to irrigate the Māne le Golf Course, driving 
range and associated landscaping falls below 250 mg/l, [the 
Resort] shall cease use of the affected well(s) producing 
such ground water for irrigation purposes until such time 
as the chloride concentration measurement of the water 
drawn from such wells rises above 250 mg/l.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
7 The case was again appealed,  and on review the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals (ICA) held that  the 2010 LUC Order was invalid 
because LSG was not given a “full and fair opportunity to have 
its evidence heard and considered post- remand.”  Lanaians for 
Sensible Growth v. Lanai Resorts, LLC, Nos. CAAP -13-0000314, 
CAAP-12-0001065, 2016 WL 1123383 (App. Mar. 21, 2016) (mem.) . 
D. The 2017 LUC Order 
  The LUC held further hearings following  the second 
remand and on June 1, 2017, issued the Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law and Decision and Order that are the subject 
of this appeal (2017 LUC Order).  In determining whether the 
Resort had violated Condition 10 when it used brackish water 
from Wells 1 and 9 
for golf course irrigation, the LUC explained 
that the “common sense definition ” of potable  is “drinkable, ” 
and that the word “brackish” means “somewhat salty” and  
“distasteful.”5  (Quoting Lanai Co. , 105 Hawaii at 299 n.10, 97 
P.3d at 375 n.10.)  Based on testimony from the hearings, the 
LUC determined that “[w]ater with chloride concentrations above 
                     
 5 The LUC noted  that the Hawai‘ i Department of Health defines 
“potable water” as “water free from impurities in amounts sufficient to cause 
disease or harmful physiological effects.”  The terms potable and non -potable 
“do not exist in State or federal primary drinking water regulations,” the 
LUC stated. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
8 250 ppm or mg/L is considered ‘brackish,’” but water above this 
threshold “may also be considered ‘potable.’”6   
  T he LUC noted that the United States Environmental 
Protection Agency’s (EPA) “secondary standards” define “brackish 
water” as “water having chlorides of 250 mg/L or above.”  When 
chloride levels exceed 250 mg/L, the LUC stated, customers begin 
to complain of “taste issues” and problems arise “with the water 
system itself such as corrosion and deposits in the pipelines.”  
The LUC also explained that “in practice, county water 
departments generally limit chloride levels of water within 
their municipal system to less than 160mg/L, or at most, under 
the EPA’s secondary standard of 250 mg/L.”   
  T he LUC found,  however, that chlorides are considered 
to be a “secondary contaminant ” because they affect only the 
“aesthetic qualities” of drinking water.  In other words, 
chloride levels are not regulated by standards designed to 
protect public health.  The Hawai ‘i Department of Health (DOH) 
would allow public water systems to provide drinking water with 
chloride levels in excess of 250 
mg/L, the LUC found, and some 
public water systems have done so in the past.  I t is also 
“typical,” the LUC stated, “for county water supplies to use 
                     
 6 One milligram (mg) per liter (l) is equal to one part per million 
(ppm), and the LUC appears to have used the terms interchangeably.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
9 water pumped at or above 250 ppm in their domestic water 
systems, blended into other water. ”  There are currently potable 
wells on Oʻ ahu that produce water with over 250 mg/L chlorides, 
the LUC found, and Maui wells have likely also done so in the 
past.  Thus, the LUC reasoned that “it is possible for water 
with chloride concentrations of greater than 250 ppm to be used 
as potable water . . . either directly or blended with other 
potable sources . . . so long as other drinking water standards 
are met.”7   
  Turning to the wells used to irrigate the golf course, 
the LUC explained that “[f]rom 1948 to present, the documented 
chloride levels of water from Well 1 have always been greater 
than 250 mg/L.”  The LUC found that Well 9 was “connected to the 
brackish water system” in 1992, and “[f]rom 1993 to present, the 
documented chloride levels of the water from [the well] have 
always been greater than 250 mg/L.”  “No party,” the LUC found, 
“presented any evidence that the chloride levels of either Well 
1 or 9 ha
s ever dropped below 250 mg/L.”  Wells 1 and 9 “draw 
the only known high- level ground water in the state that is 
brackish, as opposed to fresh,” the LUC stated.  And, although 
                     
 7 The LUC also concluded that “the record contains inconclusive 
evidence as to the degree to which the pumping of water from Wells 1 and 9 in 
the Pālāwai Basin may cause the leakage of water from other areas of the high 
level aquifer that are currently used for potable drinking water.”  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
10 Wells 1 and 9 had been tested for potability and found to be 
free of primary contaminants, the LUC determined that they would 
“not be accepted by the County[  of Maui]  as potable wells”  due 
to their chloride levels.    
  T he LUC found that “it was reasonable to conclude that 
the water from Wells 1 and 9 may be considered ‘potable’” unde r 
the term’s “common sense meaning .”  The LUC reasoned , however, 
that when it was used in Condition 10, “potable” had “a special 
interpretation other than its common or general meaning, ” as 
evidenced by the inclusion of “the category of ‘brackish’ water 
as a specific example . . .  [of] an ‘alternate source’ of 
water.”  Due to the “unique existence of br ackish high- level 
water” in Wells 1 and 9, those  involved in the original hearing 
may have incorrectly assumed that the high level aquifer 
contained only freshwater, the LUC explained.  Thus, “in the 
specific context of this Docket and Condition 10, ‘brackish’ 
water was considered not to be potable, ” the LUC found,  “but 
rather a source of water ‘alternate’ to the ‘potable’ water 
supplies” found in the high level aquifer.    
  T he LUC therefore concluded that the specific language 
of Condition 10 indicated that the term “potable” was not used 
in accordance with its common sense meaning,  and the condition 
“specifically excluded from ‘potability’ brackish water of a 
kind that is used elsewhere in these islands for drinking.”   The ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
11 LUC stated that the Resort presented “substantial credible 
evidence” that the water used to irrigate the golf course “was 
and is brackish under the specific meaning of the language in 
Condition 10 in the 1991 [LUC] Order, and therefore an allowable 
alternate source of water .” 
  The LUC also addressed the p ublic trust doctrine 
explaining that “[u]nder the public trust, the state has both 
the authority and duty to preserve the rights of present and 
future generations in the waters of the state.”   (Quoting In re 
Water Use Permit Applications (Waiāhole I ), 94 Hawai ʻi 97, 141, 9 
P.3d 409, 443 (2000). )  Additionally, the LUC noted that it was 
required to “consider whether [the Resort’s ] use negatively 
affects past, current or future uses of potable water from the 
high-level aquifer.”   Although the evidence regarding “the 
potential long-term effect of withdrawals from Wells 1 and 9 on 
drinking water wells” on Lānaʻi wa
s “ambiguous,” the L UC found, 
“no party [] raised a reasonable allegation of harm against that 
or any other public trust use of water.”  Therefore, the LUC 
concluded that the Resort “made an affirmative showing that its 
use of Wells 1 and 9 to irrigate Mānele Golf Course does  not 
conflict and is consistent with public trust principles and 
purposes.”  The 1996 LUC O rder was vacated by the 2017 LUC 
because of its determination that the Resort “proved its ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
12 compliance with Condition No. 10 by a preponderance of the 
evidence.” 
  LS G filed a direct appeal from the 2017 LUC Order  to 
this court. 
II. STANDARD S OF REVIEW 
  Pursuant to Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS ) § 205- 19 
(Supp. 2016), this court reviews LUC decisions under the 
standards set forth in the judicial review provision of the 
Hawai‘i
 Administrative Procedures Act, HRS § 91- 14(g).  HRS § 91-
14(g) (Supp. 2016) provides as follows: 
Upon review of the record, the court may affir
m the 
decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions 
for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the 
decision and order if the substantial rights of the 
petitioners may have been prejudiced because the 
administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders 
are:
 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory 
provisions;  
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or 
jurisdiction of the agency;  
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure;  
(4) Affected by other error of law;  
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, 
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole 
record; or  
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by 
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise 
of discretion.  
This court has further clarified that 
[c]onclusions of  law are reviewed de novo, pursuant to 
subsections (1), (2) and (4); questions regarding 
procedural defects are reviewable under subsection (3); 
findings of fact (FOF) are reviewable under the clearly ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
13 erroneous standard, pursuant to subsection (5), and an 
agency’s exercise of discretion is reviewed under the 
arbitrary and capricious standard, pursuant to subsection 
(6).

III. DISCUSSION 
  The 2017 LUC  determined  that brackish water is per se 
“non-potable” within the meaning of Condition 10, 
notwithstanding that this meaning is contrary  to the “common 
sense” definition of the term.   However, given the text of 
Condition 10, the presumption that the 1991 LUC complied with 
its constitutional public trust duties, and the circumstances in 
which the condition was adopted, it is apparent that the 1991 
LUC intended to use the term “potable” in accordance with its 
common sense meaning rather than a special interpretation under 
which water with chloride levels higher than an unspecified 
number is inherently non -potable.  This is to say that Condition 
10 prohibits the Resort from irrigating its golf course with 
water suitable for drinking under the county’s water quality 
standards.   
A. The 2017 LUC’s  Interpretation of Condition 10 Is Contrary to 
Its Plain Meaning, Which Prohibits  Golf Course Irrigation with 
Water that Is Suitable for Drinking under County Water Quality 
Standards.  
  T he 2017 LUC concluded that the plain language of 
Condition 10 indicates that , counter to the common sense meaning ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
14 of its terms, brackish water is necessarily “non -potable” within 
the meaning of the condition.  In interpreting the  text of 
Condition 10, the general principles of statutory construction 
apply.  See Boswell v. Brazos Elec. Power Co- op., Inc., 910 
S.W.2d 593, 599 (Tex. App. 1995 ) (“Rules of statutory 
construction apply equally to the construction of an 
administrative order.” ) (citing Trapp v. Shell Oil Co., 198 
S.W.2d 424, 439 (Tex. 1946))) ; State v. Guyton, 135 Hawai ‘i 372, 
378, 351 P.3d 1138, 1144 (2015) (applying canons of statutory 
construction to a court order); Int’l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 
Local 1357 v. Hawaiian Tel. Co., 68 Haw. 316, 323, 713 P.2d 943, 
950 (1986) (applying canons of statutory construction to an 
administrative rule)
.  If the language of the order is 
unambiguous and applying it in its literal sense would not 
produce a result that is absurd, unjust, or at odds with 
governing law, we  are bound to enforce the plain meaning of the 
administrative order.  See  Guyton, 135 Hawai ‘i at 378, 351 P.3d 
at 1144.  We are only free to depart from this plain meaning if 
there is some indication that a term was intended to  be “given a 
special interpretation other than its common and general 
meaning.”  Singleton v. Liquor Comm ’n, 111 Hawai‘i 234, 244, 140 
P.3d 1014, 1024 (2006). 
  The 2017 LUC f ound such an indication in the language 
of Condition 10, which includes brackish water as a possible ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
15 example of non-potable water.  The 2017 LUC expressly 
acknowledged that 
the water from Wells 1 and 9 could be 
considered “potable” under the common sense meaning of the word.   
It however reasoned that, by  stating that the Resort was 
required to “develop and utilize only alternative non-potable 
sources of water (e.g., brackish water
, reclaimed sewage 
effluent),” Condition 10 clearly indicated that brackish water 
was considered 
“non-potable ” for purposes of the condition, and 
the term must therefore carry a “special interpretation” other 
than its common sense meaning.   (Emphasis added.)   
  But “e.g.” , an abbreviation for the Latin phrase 
exempli gratia,  simply means “f or example. ”  Black’s Law 
Dictionary 717 (11th ed. 201 9).  The inclusion of brackish water 
following the abbreviation indicates only that brackish water is 
an example of water that could  be “non-potable” if the water 
qualifies as such under the word’s ordinary meaning .  In 
contrast, the term “i.e.”, an abbreviation  for the Latin phrase 
id est, means “that is.”   Black’s Law Dictionary  895 (11th ed. 
2019).  Thus, when a term  is meant to be interchangeable with or 
definitional of an affected term, rather than just a possible 
example, “i.e.” is used.   See DePierre v. United States, 564 
U.S. 70, 80 (2011) (using “i.e.” to demonstrate that cocaine 
hydrochloride and powder cocaine are the same substance); 
Droplets, Inc. v. eBay, Inc.
, No. 2:11-CV-401-JRG-RSP, 2014 WL ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
16 4217376 at *7 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 22, 2014) (finding that “i.e.” is 
a definitional expression while “e.g.” is merely an explanatory 
expression); Interval Licensing LLC v. AOL, Inc., 766 F.3d 1364, 
1373 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (noting that “i.e.” serves as a 
definitional phrase that  provides clarity compare d to “e.g.” 
which serves to provide an example); Hoseman v. Weinschnei der 
(In re Weinschneider), 42 Collier Bankr.Cas.2d 1860, 1999 WL 
676519, at *3 n.3 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. Aug. 30, 1999)  (using “i.e.” 
to demonstrate that a name is interchangeable with an acronym) .  
The 2017 LUC altered  the established meaning of “e.g.” by 
finding that brackish water is per se non -potable because the 
term “e.g.” was used.   This nullifies the distinction between 
“i.e.” and “e.g.” as it converts  “e.g.” into a definitional 
phrase, rendering brackish water as an  interchangeable term for 
non-potable.   
  Th us, the 2017 LUC’s interpretation  divorces the term 
“brackish” from Condition 10’s overarching requirement that the 
water utilized by the Resort be non-potable in the first 
instance.  (“ [The Resort] shall not utilize the potable water 
from the high-level groundwater aquifer for golf course 
irrigation use[. ]”)  Simply being brackish, however,  does not 
make water non-potable within the meaning of Condition 10.   The 
key inquiry is instead whether the water at issue fulfills the 
common meaning of the term “potable,” which this court has ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
17 stated to be “suitable for drinking.”   Lanai Co. v. Land Use 
Comm’n, 105 Hawai‘ i 296, 299 n.8, 97 P.3d 372,  375 n.8 (2004) 
(quoting Webster’s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary  664 
(1965)).  Brackish water is therefore “ potable” if it is 
suitable for drinking under county water quality standards and 
“non-potable” if it is not.   
  Tellingly, neither the 2017 LUC  nor the Chief 
Justice’s opinion concurring in the judgment and dissenting 
(minority ), which accepts the specialized  meaning adopted by the 
2017 LUC, has offered an alterna tive definition of “non -
potable. ”  Because they eschew the common definition of the 
terms of Condition 10 in favor of a “special interpretation ,” 
their analysis is untethered to any specific test that can be 
applied in the future.  It is thus wholly unclear what water 
would qualify as non-potable other than the brackish water and 
reclaimed sewage effluent that are expressly mentioned in 
Condition 10.   8
                     
 8 In support of its revamping of the definition of “potable,” the 
minority points to the second paragraph of Condition 10 that requires the 
Resort to comply with the requirements imposed by the CWRM Resubmittal, which 
appears to include an authorization for the CWRM chairperson to reinstitute a 
water-management- area designation proceeding if certain indications of an 
impending water shortage exist.  Minority Op. at 19-20 ; see infra note 9.  
But this authorization cannot change the meanings of the terms used in 
Condition 10, which are fixed based on the LUC’s intention at the time the 
condition was imposed.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
18   Conversely, applying the plain language of Condition 
10 in accordance with its common meaning does not produce an 
absurd or unjust result.  Instead, it effectuates the purpose of 
Condition 10: to protect Lāna ʻi’s drinking water supply for use 
by the general public.  Th e provision does not expressly 
identify all brackish water as a permissible source of water for 
golf course irrigation, nor d oes it present any other reason to 
deviate from the plain meaning of its terms.  T his court is 
therefore not at liberty to do so, and we thus reject  the 2017 
LUC’s “special interpretation .” 
B. The LUC Is Presumed To Have Complied with I ts Constitutional 
Public Trust Duties, Including the Preservation of Water for 
Domestic Use.  
  The plain reading of Condition 10 is reinforced by the 
presumption that the LUC complied with its public trust 
obligations.  
Waiāhole I , 94 Hawai‘i 97, 135, 9 P.3d 409, 447 
(2000) (“The public trust is a dual concept of sovereign right 
and responsibility.”) .  Under our precedent, “agency decisions 
affecting public trust resources carry a presumption of 
validity.”  Id. at 143, 9 P.3d at 455.  Thus, logically, if an 
administrative order is reasonably susceptible to an 
interpretation that would not meet  the agency’s public trust 
obligations and one that would properly fulfill those duties, we 
are obligated to adopt the latter.  Cf. Morita v. Gorak, 145 
Hawai‘i 385, 391, 453 P.3d 205, 211  (2019); In re Doe , 96 Hawaiʻi ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
19 73, 81, 26 P.3d 562, 570 (2001)  (“[W]here a statute is 
susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and 
doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of 
which such questions are avoided, our duty is [to] adopt the 
latter.” (quoting Jones v. United States, 529 U.S. 848, 857 
(2000))).  In other words, the 1991 LUC is presumed to have 
reviewed and granted the Resort ’s Petition in a manner that was 
consistent with its constitutional public trust duties, and this 
court must interpret Condition 10 in light of this commitment.  
  As the 2017 LUC recognized, these duties include an 
obligation to protect and preserve water for domestic use by the 
public with a particular focus on “protecting an adequate supply  
of drinking water.”  Kauai Springs, Inc. v. Planning Comm ‘n of 
Kaua‘i, 133 Hawai ‘i 141, 172, 324 P.3d 951, 982 (2014) (citing 
Waiāhole I, 94 Hawai‘i at 136–37, 9 P.3d at 449–50) .  Further, 
the LUC possesses a continuing constitutional obligation to 
ensure that the measures it imposes to protect public trust 
resources are implemented and complied with
.  See Kelly v. 1250 
Oceanside Partners, 111 Hawai‘ i 205, 231, 140 P.3d 985, 1011 
(2006) (holding that an agency has a continuing public trust 
duty “not only [to] issue permits after prescribed measures 
appear to be in compliance with state regulation, but also to 
ensure that the prescribed measures are actually being 
implemented”).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
20   From this perspective, it is apparent that Condition 
10 serves to protect and preserve the waters of Lānaʻi for 
domestic use by prohibiting the Resort from irrigating its golf 
course with water that would otherwise be used as drinking 
water.  Thus, whether the water in Wells 1 and 9 is “potable” 
for purposes of Condition 10 would
 not turn on whether the 
chloride concentration exceeds a given level--for which there is 
no evidence that the 1991 LUC contemplated when it first imposed 
the condition.   
  Indeed, the 1991 LUC would have violated its public 
trust duties if it had intended “potable” water to convey the 
special, non-common sense interpretation adopted by the 2017 LUC 
and endorsed by the minority.  Permitting the Resort an 
indefinite license to irrigate its golf course using any water 
with chloride levels in ex cess of a given level would not 
adequately preserve and protect Lāna ʻi’s drinking water supply in 
the long term because, as technology develops and climate change 
likely fundamentally alters the availability of fresh water
, 
“brackish” water may become needed for domestic use.  
It would 
assuredly be counter to the State’s public trust obligation s to 
permit a private commercial resort to irrigate its golf course 
with water that the public needs for daily living, and the 2017 
LUC’s special interpretation does little to prevent this 
outcome.  See Waiāhole I , 94 Hawai‘i at 138, 9 P.3d at 450 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
21  
(continued . . .)  (“[A]lthough its purpose has evolved over time, the public trust 
has never been understood to safeguard rights of exclusive use 
for private commercial gain.”).  
  The minority would hav e this court instead rely  on the 
CWRM’s review of the monthly monitoring reports that Condition 
10 requires the Resort to submit to hold that the LUC’s public 
trust obligations have been satisfied.9  Minority  Op. at 19-20.  
                     
 9 Condition 10 states that the Resort shall comply with the 
conditions set forth in the CWRM Resubmittal, which recommended the following 
actions to protect Lāna ‘i’s water supply:  
1. Require [the Resort] to immediately commence monthly 
reporting of water use to the [CWRM], under the authority 
of Chapter 174 C-83, HRS, which would include pumpage, water 
level, temperature, and chloride measurements from all 
wells and shafts;  
2. In addition to monthly water use reporting and pursuant 
to Secs. 174C -43 & 44, HRS, require [the Resort] to monitor 
the hydrologic situation so that if and when ground -water 
withdrawals reach the 80 -percent-of-sustainable- yield rate, 
the [Resort]  can expeditiously institute public 
informational meetings in collaboration with the [CWRM] to 
discuss mitigative measures; 
3. Require [the Resort] to formulate a water shortage plan 
that would outline actions to be taken by the [Resort]  in 
the event a water shortage situation occurs.  This plan 
shall be approved by the [CWRM] and shall be used in 
regulating water use on Lanai if the [CWRM] should exercise 
its declaratory powers of a water emergency pursuant to 
Section 174C -62(g) of the State Water Code.  A draft of 
this plan should be available for public and [CWRM] review 
no later than the beginning of October 1990  and shall be 
approved by the [CWRM] no later than January 1991;  
4. That the [CWRM] hold annual public informational 
meetings on Lanai during the month of October to furnish 
and receive information regarding the island’s water 
conditions.  The public shall  be duly notified of such 
meetings;  
5. Authorize the Chairperson to re -institute water-
management -area designation proceedings and, hence, re -***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
22 While these reports are relevant to the State’s continuing 
public trust duty to monitor the Resort’s compliance with 
Condition 10, the submission of monthly water reports prepared 
by the Resort would not by itself assure the required level of 
protection and preservation of Lāna ‘i’s water resou
rces.  Ching 
v. Case, 145 Hawai ‘i 148, 170, 449 P.3d 1146, 1168 (2019) (“The 
most basic aspect of the State’s trust duties is the obligation

property,” to ensure that “ a trustee fulfills the mandate of 
‘elementary trust law’ that trust property not be permitted to 
‘fall into ruin on the [the trustee’s ] watch’” (alteration in

  The CWRM’s powers are intended to be used to respond 
to and mitigate a water shortage once it has begun.  See HRS

c. Items 1, 2, and 3 are not fulfilled by [the Resort] . 
d. If source water uses exceeds 4.3 [million gallons per

23 § 174C-62.10  By contrast, Condition 10’s prohibition on the use 
of potable water serves to help prevent such a shortage from 
arising in the first place.  If the “potable” distinction in 
Condition 10 is properly interpreted to vary based on whether 
                     
 10 HRS § 174C -62 (2011) provides as follows:  
(a) The commission shall formulate a plan for 
implementation during periods of water shortage. As a part 
of the plan, the commission shall adopt a reasonable system 
of permit classification according to source of water 
supply, method of extraction or diversion, use of water, or 
a combination thereof.  
(b) The commission, by rule, may declare that a water 
shortage exists within all or part of an area when 
insufficient water is available to meet the requirements of 
the permit system or when conditions are such as to require 
a temporary reduction in total water use within the area to 
protect water resources from serious harm.  The commission 
shall publish a set of criteria for determining when a 
water shortage exists.  
(c) In accordance with the plan adopted under subsection 
(a), the commission may impose such restrictions on one or 
more classes of permits as may be necessary to protect the 
water resources of the area from serious harm and to 
restore them to their previous condition.  
. . . . 
(g) If an emergency condition arises due to a water 
shortage within any area, whether within or outside of a 
water management area,  and if the commission finds that the 
restrictions imposed under subsection (c) are not 
sufficient to protect the public health, safety, or 
welfare, or the health of animals, fish, or aquatic life, 
or a public water supply, or recreational, municipal, 
agricultural, or other reasonable uses, the commission may 
issue orders reciting the existence of such an emergency 
and requiring that such actions as the commission deems 
necessary to meet the emergency be taken, including but not 
limited to apportioning, rotating, limiting, or prohibiting 
the use of the water resources of the area.  Any party to 
whom an emergency order is directed may challenge such an 
order but shall immediately comply with the order, pending

other pending matters.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
24 the water is of a quality that the county water agency would, at 
that time, deem suitable for domestic use, the provision 
fulfills the LUC’s  public trust duty to ensure that the public’s 
use of the limited natural resource is always  prioritized over 
the irrigation of a private commercial golf course, regardless 
of whether Lānaʻ i’s water supply  is actively threatened.11  See 
Kauai Springs, Inc., 133 Hawai‘i at 174, 324 P.3d at 984 (noting 
that the public trust doctrine obligates an agency to consider 
“whether the proposed use is consistent with,” inter alia,  “the 
protection of domestic water use” and to subject commercial uses 
to “a high level of  scrutiny”).  The position asserted by the 
minority clearly would not protect and preserve the public trust 
as it concludes that all brackish water is non- potable, th us 
allowing perpetual commercial use of a public water resource to 
irrigate the Resort’s g olf course unless the CWRM determines 
that there exists a water shortage on Lāna‘ i of sufficient 
                     
 11 County water quality standards necessarily take into 
consideration the DOH and the EPA’s safety regulations.  See Hawai‘i 
Administrative Rules §§ 11 -20-2, 11-20-4 to 11-20-7, 11-21-2; 40 C.F.R. §§ 
141.2, 141.61- .66 (2020).  However, more than just safety considerations 
inform a county water agency’s evaluation of the suitability of water for 
domestic use.  A host of secondary considerations such as taste, appearance, 
odor, the cost and feasibility of purification or other processing, and the 
availability of alternative sources may affect whether a county water agency 
views a water source as suited for domestic use.  See EPA, Secondary Drinking 
Water Standards: Guidance for Nuisance Chemicals  (2017) (listing various 
chemicals that do not threaten water safety but may negatively affect the 
desirability of water for drinking),

standards- guidance- nuisance -chemicals [https://perma.cc/NT4B -6MAE].   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
25 severity to require mitigation measures.12  The 2017 LUC ’s 
interpretation therefore renders Condition 10 ineffectual in 
preserving Lāna‘ i’s public water resource for future generations
 
in derogation of the public trust.  Waiāhole I , 94 Hawai ‘i at 
139, 9 P.3d at 451 (“ The second clause of article XI, section 1 
[of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution] provides that the state ‘ shall 
promote the development and utilization of [ water] resources in 
a manner consistent with their conservation and in furtherance 
of the self-sufficiency of the State. ’” (second alteration in 
original)).  
  Further, the interpretation advocated by the minority  
would rely on the Resort to self -report the composition of the 
water in Wells 1 and 9.  As we have held, “an agency of the 
State must perform its statutory function in a manner that 
fulfills the State’s affirmative constitutional obligations.”  
Mauna Kea Anaina Hou v. BLNR, 13 6 Hawai ‘i 376, 414, 363 P.3d 224, 
262 (2015) (opinion of the court as to Part IV by Pollack, J.).  
                     
 12 The minority claims to agree that the Resort is not allowed 
perpetual use of the water in Wells 1 and 9.  Minority Op. at 11.  Yet its 
reading of Condition 10 specifically provides for this outcome.  As the 
minority itself states, “if Wells 1 and 9 were made part of Lāna ‘i’s potable 
water system –  in other words, if they no longer were ‘brackish’,” then the 
Resort “[o]f course” could not use the water.  Minority Op. at 11.  This 
reading of Condition 10 means that water would have to be no longer brackish 
for it to be made part of Lāna ‘i’s potable water system, ignoring the 
scientific reality that brackish water can be potable.  Consequently, the 
minority allows the perpe
tual use of potable water.   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
26 The State’s affirmative duty  to protect and preserve 
constitutional rights is by its very nature not  delegable to a 
private entity.  See Ka Pa‘ akai O Ka‘Aina v. Land Use Comm’n , 94 
Hawai‘i 31, 50–51, 7 P.3d 1068, 1087 –88 (2000 ).  And, manifest ly, 
it is not reasonable for a trustee to delegate the supervision 
of a third party’s compliance with an agreement that is designed 
to protect trust property to the third party itself.  Ching, 145 
Hawai‘i at 181, 449 P.3d at  1179 (“It is self- evident that, as a 
general matter, it is not reasonable for a trustee to delegate 
the supervision of a lessee’s compliance with the terms of a 
lease of trust property to the lessee .”); see also In re Estate 
of Dwight, 67 Haw. 139, 146, 681 P.2d 563, 568 (1984) (“A 
trustee is under a duty to use the care and skill of a [person] 
of ordinary prudence to preserve the trust property.” (citing 
Bishop v. Pittman, 33 Haw. 647, 654 (Haw. Terr. 1935))); cf. 
Halderman v. Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp., 526 F.Supp. 428, 433 
(E.D. Pa. 1981) (“The Commonwealth defendants appear to take the 
position that they should be able to monitor their own 
compliance with the Court’s Orders.   This would be somewhat akin 
to requesting the fox to guard the henhouse. ”).   
  T he Hawai ʻi Constitution requires the State to engage 
in evaluative monitoring of the wells with regard to the 
county’s standards for domestic water usage to protect against 
the conflict of interest inherent in self- reporting.  Ching, 145 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
27  
(continued . . .)  Hawai‘i at 178, 449 P.3d at 1176  (holding that the State has  a 
“constitutional trust obligation ” to reasonably monitor the 
lessee to ensure that the lessee actually complies with the 
conditions of the lease) ; Kelly, 111 Hawai‘i at 231, 140 P.3d at  
1011 (concluding that the State had a continuing public trust 
duty to reasonably monitor the developer to ensure that the 
permit conditions are being followed) .  By engaging in 
reasonable monitoring, the State  can thus determine on an 
ongoing basis whether the Resort has violated Condition 10 by 
irrigating its golf course with water that the county water  
agency would at that time deem suitable for domestic use.   The 
1991 LUC would have fulfilled its public trust duties by 
crafting such a standard that can evolve with time and 
contemporary conditions, including the changing environment and 
developing technologies.  Waiāhole I, 94 Hawaiʻi at 137, 9 P.3d 
at 449 (“[W]e recognize d omestic water use as a purpose of the 
state water resources trust. ”).  This court therefore presumes  
that the common sense meaning of potable water is in deed what 
the LUC intended in Condition 10.13 
                     
 13 As noted, the appeal in this case was taken following our remand 
to the LUC to determine whether the Resort “was using potable water from the 
high level aquifer” in violation of Condition 10.  Lanai Co., 105 Hawai ʻi at 
306, 316, 97 P.3d at 382, 392.  Accordingly, this opinion reviews the 2017 
LUC’s decision on remand and does not consider whether the Resort’s 
prospective use of the water in Wells 1 and 9 complies with the LUC’s 
constitutional public trust obligations  to “preserve the rights of present ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
28   The  minority also contends that there is nothing in 
Condition 10 that expressly provides the Resort with “fair 
notice” that its authorization to use 
water from Wells 1 and 9 
was subject to changing circumstances.  Minority Op. at 4-5.  
This contention assumes that the Resort was given permanent 
authorization to use all brackish water in Wells 1 and 9 because 
all such water is non- potable.  It is far more logical to 
conclude that the Resort would have been on notice that its 
usage of Wells 1 and 9 for golf course irrigation would no 
longer be permitted when the water was potable, i.e., suitable 
for drinking under county water quality standards.  As 
this 
court has emphasized, “The public trust, by its very nature, 
does not remain fixed for all time, but must conform to changing 
needs and circumstances.”  Waiāhole
 I, 94 Hawaiʻ i at 135, 9 P.3d 
at 447. 
  In concluding that Condition 10 of the P ermit was 
intended to prohibit the R esort from watering its golf course 
with a public water resource suitable for drinking under county 
water quality standards, this court is following a long line of

omitted) (quoting Nat’l Audubon Soc’y v. Superior Ct. , 658 P.2d 
709, 728 (Cal. 1983)) ).  Such rulings were made without 
consideration of whether the landowners or impacted parties had 
notice of the existence of those rights prio r to the court’s ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
30 disposition.  See, e.g., Sotomura , 55 Haw. at 180, 517 P.2d at

the same burdens and incidents as unregistered land[ .]”  (citing 
HRS § 501-81)); Oahu Ry. & Land Co., 11 Haw. at  736 (observing 
that “it is doubtful if the State as  a trustee for the public

426-458 (Melody Kapilialoha MacKenzie ed. 2015) (discussing the 
historical and current development of public trust doctrine and 
water law in Hawai ʻi).   
  In  none of these cases did we suppose that the 
constitutional mandates of the public trust doctrine were 
inoperable or unrecognizable because the parties did not have 
express notice of the existence of the rights protected under 
the doctrine.  Instead, our cases indicate that State action 
with regard to trust resources is inherently limited by and 
subject to the State’s public trust duties.  See Waiāhole I, 94 
Hawaiʻi at 131, 9 P.3d at 443 (“ This court has held that the 
[public trust] doctrine would invalidate such measures, 
sanctioned by statute but violative of the public trust, as: the 
use of delegated eminent domain powers by a private party to 
condemn a public harbor;  the land court ’s registration of 
tidelands below the high water mark; and a sale of lava 
extensions that did not promote a ‘valid public purpose.’”  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

at 776 (land court registration below high water mark); Zimring, 
58 Haw. at 121, 566 P.2d at  735 (lava extensions) .  As this 
court has unequivocally stated, “if the public trust is to 
retain any meaning and effect, it must recognize enduring public 
rights in trust resources separate from, and superior to, the 
prevailing private interests in the resources at any given 
time.”  Wai
āhole I, 94 Hawaiʻ i at 138, 9 P.3d at 45 0.  The LUC’s 
duty to protect and preserve Lāna‘i’s drinking water in trust for 
future generations therefore inherently limits the Resort from 
utilizing water in Wells 1 and 9 that is suitable for drinking 
under county water quality standards.  See id. at 131, 9 P.3d at 
443; Kauai Springs, Inc., 133 Hawaiʻ i at 172, 324 P.3d at 982

the state over its water resources precludes any grant or 
assertion of vested rights to use water to the detriment of

1168 (“The most basic aspect of the State’s trust duties is the 
obligation ‘to protect and maintain the trust property and

that the Resort does not violate Condition 10 by using water for ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

quality standards, regardless of the chloride level of the 
water.14    
C. The 1991 Hearing and Findings of Fact Do Not Indicate the 
1991 LUC Considered Brackish Water 
To Be Per Se  Non-potable. 
  The 1991 LUC’s findings of fact are consistent with an 
interpretation of potability that is based on whether water 
meets the county’s water quality standards for drinking water 
rather than whether water contains enough chlorides to qualify 
as “brackish.”15  For instance, finding of fact 73 of the 1991 
LUC Order stated that the “[g]roundwater underlying the proposed 
                     
 14 The minority relies on this court’s decision in DW Aina to 
contend that this opinion fails to give the Resort the “ascertainable 
certainty” required in an administrative order.  Minority Op. at 4-6 (citing 
DW Aina Leʻ a Dev., LLC v. Bridge Aina Le ʻa, LLC , 134 Hawaiʻ i 187, 215 -16, 339 
P.3d 685, 713- 14 (2014)).  The court in DW Aina  was presented with a 
contractual dispute over whether the LUC had adequately defined the term 
“completed” as it related to affordable housing.  DW Aina Leʻ a Dev., LLC , 134 
Hawaiʻi at 215 -16, 339 P.3d at 713 -14.  Whether and when housing was 
“completed” in that case did not concern the State’s public trust duties.  In 
pointed contrast, in this case, “potable” is imbedded with constitutional 
implications under the public trust doctrine that extend beyond a permit  
condition or administrative rule.  See
 Ching, 145 Hawaiʻ i at 178, 449 P.3d at 
1176 (“[T]he State’s constitutional public trust obligations exist 
independent of any statutory mandate and must be fulfilled regardless of 
whether they coincide with any other legal duty.”); In re Conservation Dist. 
Use Application HA- 3568 (In re TMT ), 143 Hawai ʻi 379, 415, 431 P.3d 752, 788  
(2018) (Pollack, J., concurring) (“This court has indicated that an agency’s 
public trust obligations may overlap with the agency’s statuto ry duties, and 
it would follow that they may similarly overlap with duties imposed by an 
administrative rule.”).   
  The minority further asserts that county water quality standards 
fail to provide fair and predictable elements.  Minority Op. at 3 -4.  As 
stated, county water quality standards are those standards that the county 
water agency would use in its domestic water system.  
 15 As noted, the term “brackish” is commonly defined as “somewhat 
salty, distasteful.”  Lanai Co., 105 Hawaiʻ i at 299 n.10, 97 P.3d at 375 n.10.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
34 golf course at Manele is too brackish for drinking water .”  
(Emphasis added.)  By stating that some water is too brackish 
for domestic use, the LUC indicated that there is water that is 
brackish, but not so brackish as to render it non- potable under 
then-existing standards for domestic use.  The 1991 LUC thus 
does not appear to have considered brackishness to be a binary, 
yes-or-no trait that necessarily makes water non- potable, but 
rather as one factor that is evaluated in determining 
potability.   
  But this does not mean that the LUC intended that the 
water in Wells 1 and 9 would always be considered non-potable 
regardless of surrounding circumstances, nor that the LUC 
intended that the designation would change only if the chloride 
levels were to drop below the threshold of 250 ppm.  Indeed, 
there is no indication that the LUC contemplated the proposed 
250 ppm threshold prior to imposing Condition 10, and it is 
therefore significantly more likely that it considered “non -
potable” only in terms of county water quality standards rather 
than any specific numerical value.  Accordingly, the 
circumstances in which the 1991 LUC Order was adopted also do 
not present any reason to depart from the plain meaning of its 
terms.   
  T he minority and the Resort argue , however,  that 
various references in the L UC’s 1991 Findings of Fact and the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
35 testimony and questions posed at the original LUC hearings 
suggest that the LUC viewed Wells 1 and 9 as permissible sources 
of non-potable water for irrigation.  Minority Op . at 13-17.  A 
court “must read the language of an administrative order in the 
context of the entire order. ”  Lanai Co., 105 Hawai ‘i at 310, 97 
P.3d at 386 (emphasis added).  Instead, the minority rejects the 
common sense meaning of potable in favor of reliance on 
disparate references in the testimony of selected witnesses in a 
record exceeding 17,000 pages
, including hundreds of pages of 
hearing transcripts,  to determine the 1991 LUC’s intent  in 
imposing Condition 10.   See Minority Op. at 15-17.  Equally 
problematic is the minority’s  reliance on the phrasing of 
questions posed by counsel during the hearing to interpret the 
meaning of a term in Condition 10.  Minority Op . at 16.  The 
minority infers that because  LSG’s lawyer , in referencing a 
witness’s prior response during cross-examination, asked about 
“a nonpotable or brackish water source” for the golf course , the 
lawyer believed brackish was synonymous with non- potable.  
Minority Op. at 16.  The manner in which the question was posed 
to the witness does not mean that the lawyer considered brackish 
water and non-potable water to be the same; instead, it 
highlights the analytical flaws of extrapolating from an ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
36 interpretation of a lawyer’s question to determine the meaning 
of a term in the 1991 LUC Order.16   
  It is plainly contrary to principles of statutory 
construction in interpreting an administrative order to rely on 
selected witness testimony and the phrasing of attorney 
questions.  See Guyton, 135 Hawai ‘i at 378, 351 P.3d at 1144.  
Instead, the plain meaning of the term “potable,” as made clear 
by the entirety of the 1991 LUC Order, must prevail.   
  T he language of Condition 10 and the circumstances in 
which it was adopted indicate that the 1991 LUC did not intend 
that all brackish water would be considered inherently non-
potable.  By the 2017 LUC’s own admission, such a holding would 
require this court to interpret the terms “potable” and “non -
potable” in a manner that is contrary to their “common sense” 
meanings.  We reject an interpretation of a term that is 
contrary to its common sense meaning, especially in the absence 
of far stronger indications that this is what was intended.  
Further, such an interpretation would be contrary to public 
                     
 16 Additionally, some of the testimony cited by the minority appears 
to implicitly acknowledge that potability is an evolving concept that may 
change with time.  Minority Op. at 1 6.  For example, James Kumagai, the 
Resort’s expert witness on civil, sanitary, and environmental engineering, 
testified that “Well 9 has proved to have higher chlorides than what we had 
anticipated . . . .  It’s brackish and we consider that right now  nonpotable, 
but suitable for land scape irrigation.”  (Emphasis added.)  If potability was 
a static concept based only on whether chloride levels exceed a specific 
threshold, there would be no reason for Kumagai to clarify that, as of that 
moment, the Resort considered the brackish water in Well 9 to be non -potable.   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
37 trust principles with which the LUC is presumed to have 
complied.  The 1991 LUC fulfilled its constitutional public 
trust duties with respect to Condition 10 by crafting a standard 
that turns on county water quality standards for drinking water 
as they develop.   
D. A Proper Interpretation of Condition 10 Permits a Correct 
Analysis of the Effects of 
Leakage from the High Level Aquifer
. 
  In Lanai Co., this court noted that the LUC had not 
determined whether the Resort’s actions were the cause of 
potable water leaking into Wells 1 and 9, and assuming that they 
were, the LUC had not indicated whether the effect of such 
actions would mean that potable water was being utilized under 
Condition 10:  
LUC makes no specific finding or conclusion as to whether [the 
Resort] was using  potable water.  Additionally, it is not clear 
from finding No. 30, whether the potable water leaking into Wells 
No. 1 and 9 is a direct result of [the Resort ’s] actions, or if 
such leakage  would occur irrespective of [the Resort’s]  water 
usage.  Similarly, assuming [the Resort’s] use is affecting 
potable water in the high level aquifer, the LUC did not indicate 
whether such an effect would qualify as “utiliz[ing] the potable 
water” under Condition No. 10 . 
 
Lanai Co., 105 Hawai ʻi at 316, 97 P.3d at 392 (emphases added) 
(alteration in original).  On remand, the 2017 LUC found that
the record was inconclusive a s to the degree to which the 
pumping of water from Wells 1 and 9 may cause the leakage of 
water from other areas of the high level aquifer that are 
currently used for potable drinking water.  It further found 
that there was no indication that any leakage has harmed  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
38 existing or planned uses of water for domestic purposes.  
Finally, the 2017 LUC concluded that the leakage “theory” is 
inconsistent with the language of Condition 10 “in which 
brackish water was described as non-potable, and in which 
brackish water from Wells 1 and 9 [ was] proposed for irrigation 
of the Mānele Golf Course.”  
 
 Properly interpreting  Condition 10 to prohibit the 
Resort from utilizing water that meets county water quality 
standards for domestic use resolves the issue of leakage.  
Leakage would result in a violation of Condition 10 if the 
commingling of freshwater with brackish water changes the 
composition of the water in Wells 1 and 9 such that it becomes 
suitable for domestic use under 
county water standards and the 
Resort thereafter uses the water for irrigation.  However, the 
2017 LUC’s interpretation would permit utilization of the water 
in Wells 1 or 9 regardless of whether leakage from the high 
level aquifer renders the water suitable for domestic use under 
county water quality standards, further evincing the flawed 
nature of such an interpretation.   
 
 In addressing the issue of freshwater leakage, the 
minority concludes that the 2017 LUC did not err in holding 
that, “By drawing only from brackish Wells 1 and 9 in the high
-
level aquifer, the Resort did not ‘utilize’ any other sources 
per Condition 10.”  Minority  Op. at 17.  As stated, under the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
39 2017 LUC interpretation , regardless of whether the Resort’s 
pumping of water from Wells 1 and 9 causes leakage of potable 
water from the high level aquifer into those wells, such leakage 
does not constitute “utilization” of potable water from the high 
level aquifer so as to violate Condition 10.  This is because 
the 2017 LUC would find that the commingling of freshwater with 
brackish water renders such  mixed water in Wells 1 and 9 as  non-
potable and thus usable for golf course irrigation .  This flawed 
proposition highlights the illogical and non -common sense 
interpretation that the 2017 LUC applies  to Condition 10 in 
equating non-potable water with brackish water.17   
E. The 2017 LUC Did Not Clearly Err in Concluding  That the Water 
in Wells 1 and 9  Was Non-potable Under County Water Quality 
Standards.  
 
  The 2017 LUC found that the water from Wells 1 and 9 
would not currently be accepted as potable by the County of Maui 
                     
 17 Indeed, the analysis applied by the 2017 LUC would allow the 
Resort to pump water from Wells 1 and 9 with the full knowledge that potable 
water was leaking from the high level aquifer as a result of its pumpage.  
But even assuming that the Resort was unaware that its actions were causing 
leakage, the language of Condition 10 makes no distinction as to whether the 
Resort’s utilization of potable water is intentional or not; it is not 
permitted.  The minority would require “ conclusive  evidence of leakage, and 
that leakage caused the designation of Wells 1 and 9 to change from 
‘brackish’ to ‘potable’” in order to prove that the Resort was utilizing 
water from a potable well.  Minority Op. at 1 7 n.4 (emphasis added).  Such a 
reading clearly violates the public trust doctrine.  If there is evidence of 
potable water leaking from the high level aquifer into Wells 1 and 9, the 
Resort will be in violation of Condition 10, regardless of whether the water 
in Wells 1 and 9 remain non -potable.  See Kauai Springs, Inc., 133 Hawai ʻi at 
174, 324 P.3d at 984.  Alternatively, the minority would require conclusive 
evidence that the water utilized by the Resort “originated in the potable 
wells.”  Minority Op. at 1 7 n.4.  It is unclear how the source of commingled 
water can be shown by “conclusive evidence.”  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
40 because of its chloride levels, and it  cannot be said that this 
finding was clearly erroneous given the evidence in the record.  
The 2017 LUC therefore did not err in determin ing that the 
Resort was in compliance with Condition 10.  However,  the State 
has a continuing public trust duty to ensure the R esort’s 
compliance with Condition 10 by evaluative monitoring of the 
quality of water that the Resort uses for irrigation in relation 
to the county water quality standards for drinking water.  
Condition 10 would be violated if the Resort were to use water 
for irrigation that was considered  suitable for drinking under 
county water quality standards , regardless of the chloride level 
of the water.   
  The contention in Justice Wilson’s  opinion, dissenting  
as to Parts III(E) and IV,  that the record does not establish 
whether the water in Wells 1 and 9 contained potable water under 
county water quality standards during the relevant time period 
is unpersuasive.  Wilson, J., Dissenting as to Parts III(E) and  
IV at 21-23.  The 2017 LUC found, and the record does not 
indicate otherwise, that the County of Maui would not have 
accepted the water in Wells 1 and 9 
as potable.  T hat finding is 
not clearly erroneous, and the Resort accordingly did not 
violate Condition 10 of the LUC’s administrative order.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
41 IV. CONCLUSION  
For the foregoing reasons, the 2017 LUC Order is 
affirmed to the extent that it is consistent with this opinion.
