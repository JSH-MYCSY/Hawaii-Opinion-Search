ORDER OF CORRECTION  
(By: McKenna, J.)  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, pursuant to the Order 
Granting in Part and Denying in Part Motion for Reconsideration, 
filed by this Court on November 29, 2018,  the Opinion of the 
Court, filed October 30, 2018, is corrected as follows  , in an 
Amended Opinion to be filed concurrently with this Order of 
Correction:  
The Kihoi Appellants allege in Point of Error B(2) that the 
BLNR erred by stating that Article XII, Section 7 does not 
protect contemporary Native Hawaiian cultural practices. 
The record reflects, however, that the BLNR appropriately 
took into account contemporary (as well as customary and 
traditional)  Native Hawaiian cultural practices, finding 
and concluding that none were taking place within the TMT 
Project site or its immediate vicinity, aside from the 
recent construction of ahu to protest the TMT Project 
itself, which was not found to be a reasonable exercise of 
cultural rights. Further, although the BLNR defined the  
  
  3. On page 72, the name of one of the attorneys for 
appellee the University of Hawai ʻi at Hilo is corrected to 
“Lindsay N. McAneeley.”  
  
  
  
   
 
        
          “relevant area” in its Ka Paʻakai  analysis as the TMT 
Observatory site and Access Way, the Board’s findings also 
identified and considered the effect of the project upon 
cultural pract ices in the vicinity of the “relevant area” 
and in other areas of Mauna Kea, including the summit 
region, as Ka Paʻ akai  requires. See  94 Hawaiʻ i at 49, 7 
P.3d at 1086 (faulting the agency for failing to address 
“possible native Hawaiian rights or cultural  resources 
outside [the area at issue]”).  
4.  
Other technical, non-substantive changes have been 
made to the Amended Opinion. 
The Clerk of the Court is directed to take all 
necessary steps to notify the publishing agencies of these 
changes. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai ʻi, November 30, 2018.
