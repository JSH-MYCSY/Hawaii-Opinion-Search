APPEAL FROM THE BOARD OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES
 
(BLNR-CC-16-002 (Agency Appeal)
 
ORDER OF CORRECTION
 
(By: Wilson, J.)
 
It is hereby ordered that the Dissenting Opinion by
 
Wilson, J., filed on November 9, 2018, is corrected as follows:
 
1. On page 13, footnote 7, numbers (2), (3) and (4) of
 
the block quote are deleted and replaced with:
 
(2) mitigation measures of restoring the abandoned Poli 'ahu 
Road and decommissioning the five telescopes will be
adopted, and (3) other measures to lessen the impacts of theTMT will be adopted, the BLNR did not clearly err inconcluding that the TMT will not have a substantial adverseimpact to existing natural resources within the surroundingarea, community, or region, as prohibited by HAR § 13-5­30(c)(4). 
2. On page 15, footnote 8, the sentence starting on
 
line 7 that reads, “However, HAR § 13-5-30(c)(4) prohibits land
 
use in the conservation district where the land use will cause a
 substantial adverse impact.” is amended to read “However,
 
contrary to the assumption of the Majority that TMT can proceed
 conditioned on significant, long-term mitigation measures, HAR §
 13-5-30(c)(4) prohibits land use in the conservation district
 where the land use will cause a substantial adverse impact.” 
3. On page 17, line 8, the word “international” is
 
deleted and replaced with “widely accepted principles of”, and
 the word “protects” is deleted and replaced with “protect”. 
4. On page 30, line 6, the words “of Trinidad and
 
Tobago” are inserted between the words “Policy” and “which”.
 
5. On page 31, footnote 18, the citation to “Clean
 
Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1362 (2014)” is corrected to “Federal
 Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251-1387 (2012).”
 
6. The first five sentences of the paragraph beginning
 
on page 34, line 4, are deleted and replaced with a separate
 paragraph reading: 
The  degradation  principle  peels  away  this  protection.   It
 
allows  further  degradation  based  on  damage  cumulatively  caused
by  prior  impacts.   The  BLNR’s  analysis  regresses  to  a  former
stage  of  the  law—prior  to  the  passage  of  HAR  §  13-5-30(c)(4)  in
1994—when  the  conservation  district  was  not  protected  by  the
proscription  codified  in  HAR  §  13-5-30(c)(4)  barring  land  use
that  causes  a  “substantial,  significant  and  adverse”  impact  on
 
cultural  resources.   Per  the  degradation  principle,  protection
of  cultural  resources  at  the  summit  of  Mauna  Kea  regresses  to  a
time  prior  to  1994,  when  the  purpose  of  regulating  land  use  in
the  conservation  district  had  not  yet  been  specifically  defined
by  regulation  as  “conserving,  protecting,  and  preserving  the
important  natural  and  cultural  resources  of  the  State[.]”   HAR
 
§  13-5-1  (1994).
   
7. Other technical corrections have been made
 
throughout the dissenting opinion.

   An Amended Dissenting Opinion will be filed
 
concurrently with this order. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, November 30, 2018.
