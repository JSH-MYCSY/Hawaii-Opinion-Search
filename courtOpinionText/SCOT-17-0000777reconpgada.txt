2 protect contemporary Native Hawaiian cultural practices.  
The record reflects, however, that the BLNR appropriately 
took into account contemporary (as well as customary and 
traditional ) Native Hawaiian cultural practices, finding 
and concluding that none were taking place within the TMT 
Project site or its immediate vicinity, aside from the 
recent construction of ahu  to protest the TMT Project 
itself, which was not found to be a reasonable exercise of 
cultural rights.  Further, although the BLNR defined the 
“relevant area” in its Ka Paʻakai analysis as the TMT 
Observatory site and Access Way, the Board’s findings also  
identified and considered the effect of the project upon 
cultural practices in the vicinity of the “relevant area” 
and in other areas of Mauna Kea, including the summit 
region, as Ka Paʻakai requires.  See 94 Hawaiʻ i at 49, 7 
P.3d at 1086 (faulting the agency for failing to address 
“possible native Hawaiian rights or cultural resources 
outside [the area at issue]”).  
 
This court will issue an Order of Correction and Amended Opinion 
incorporating these changes. 
  IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that, in all other 
respects, the motion for reconsideration is denied.
