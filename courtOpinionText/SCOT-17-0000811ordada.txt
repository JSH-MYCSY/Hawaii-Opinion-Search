thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it

filing fees, which was received by the appellate clerks’ office
on January 11, 2018.  Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is granted.  The
January 4, 2018 order dismissing the appeal for non-payment of
the filing fees is set aside, and the appeal is reinstated.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, January 12, 2018.
