ORIGINAL PROCEEDING

ORDER DENYING “SUPREME COURT APPEAL AND MOTION FOR INJUNCTIVE 
RELIEF SUPPLEMENT AND ADDENDUM WITH EXHIBITS 1-20” 
(By:  Recktenwald,  C.J.,  Nakayama,  McKenna,  Pollack,  and  Wilson,  JJ.) 
Upon consideration of petitioner Luke J. Warner’s 
document entitled, “Supreme Court Appeal and Motion for 
Injunctive Relief Supplement and Addendum with Exhibits 1-20,” 
filed on March 12, 2019, the documents attached thereto and 
submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that 
petitioner has alternative means to seek the requested relief and 
fails to demonstrate that this court is the appropriate forum for 
which to seek such relief. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the “Supreme Court Appeal and 
Motion for Injunctive Relief Supplement and Addendum with 
Exhibits 1-20” is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 3, 2019.
