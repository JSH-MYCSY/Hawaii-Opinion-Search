ORDER
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon review of the document received by the appellate
clerk’s office from Nicholas L. Abel, which was filed as a
complaint on February 6, 2020, it appears that we lack
jurisdiction to consider the complaint.  See HRS § 602-5. 
Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the complaint is dismissed.
