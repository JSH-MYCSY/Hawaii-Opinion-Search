ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Upon review of the document received by the appellate 
clerk’s office from plaintiff Nicholas L. Abel, which was filed 
as a complaint on February 24, 2020, it appears that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the complaint.  See HRS § 602-5. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the complaint is dismissed. 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that all pending motions 
are dismissed. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 23, 2020.
