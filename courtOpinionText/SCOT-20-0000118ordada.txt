TRUMAN LEE KETCHMARK, Plaintiff,
vs.
COUNTY OF HAWAI#I ET. AL., Defendants.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon review of the document received by the appellate
clerk’s office from Truman Lee Ketchmark, which was filed as a
complaint on March 3, 2020, it appears that this court lacks
jurisdiction to consider the complaint and provide the requested
relief.  See HRS § 602-5.  Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the complaint is dismissed.
