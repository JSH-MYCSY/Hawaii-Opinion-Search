 37306 spring from a misreading of the holding in Matter of 
Hawai‘i Elec. Light Co., Inc., 145 Hawai‘ i 1, 445 P.3d 673 (2019) 
(“HELCO I”), we vacate them and remand this case to the PUC for 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion and the court’s 
instructions in HELCO I. 
I. BACKGROUND 
The PUC oversees and regulates public utilities in 
Hawai‘i.  Under the PUC’s Competitive Bidding Framework, HELCO’s 
acquisition of new renewable energy generation sources typically 
occurs through competitive bidding; normally, only contracts 
identified through the competitive bidding process are presented 
to the PUC for approval.  In 2017, however, the PUC granted 
HELCO a waiver from competitive bidding (the “2017 waiver”) for 
a proposed power purchase agreement HELCO wanted to enter with 
Hu Honua (the “Amended PPA”).  Because of the 2017 waiver, the 
PUC considered the merits of the Amended PPA even though it had 
not been selected through competitive bidding.  The 2017 waiver 
was then issued alongside the PUC’s approval of the Amended PPA 
in a single decision and order (the “2017 D&O”).   
The community and environmental group Life of the Land 
(“LOL”) directly appealed the PUC’s 2017 D&O to this court.  It 
argued that the PUC’s consideration of the Amended PPA failed to 
consider greenhouse gas emissions as required by Hawaiʻ i Revised 
Statutes (“HRS”) § 269-6(b).  It also argued that the procedures *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 the PUC used and the participation status it afforded LOL denied 
LOL the due process necessary to protect its constitutional 
right to a clean and healthful environment. 
In HELCO I, we agreed with LOL.  We vacated the 2017 
D&O and remanded the case.  We instructed: “On remand, the PUC 
shall give explicit consideration to the reduction of 
[greenhouse gas] emissions in determining whether to approve the 
Amended PPA, and make the findings necessary for this court to 
determine whether the PUC satisfied its obligations under HRS § 
269-6(b).”  HELCO I,  145 Hawai‘ i at 25, 445 P.3d at 697.  The 
last line of our opinion read: “The PUC’s 2017 D&O is therefore 
vacated and this case is remanded to the PUC for proceedings 
consistent with this opinion.”  Id. at 28, 445 P.3d at 700. 
  On remand, the PUC reopened the 2017 docket.  
Operating under the belief that HELCO I nullified the 2017 
waiver by vacating “the 2017 D&O,” the PUC solicited testimony, evidence, and briefing from the parties on several issues 
including whether it should reissue HELCO a competitive bidding 
waiver.  
Eventually, the PUC issued Order No. 37205, denying 
HELCO’s request for a waiver.  Because it denied HELCO a waiver from the competitive bidding framework, the PUC declined to hold an evidentiary hearing or consider the merits of the Amended 
PPA.  Hu Honua moved for reconsideration.  The PUC rejected that 
motion in Order No. 37306. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 
 
4 
   In Order No. 37306, the PUC explained that its re-
evaluation of HELCO’s waiver request was unavoidable because 
HELCO I had vacated the 2017 waiver:  
In light of the Court’ s ruling vacating the 2017 D&O in its 
entirety, on remand, the Commission was required to “ redo” 
the proceeding to ensure that LOL was provided meaningful 
opportunity to be heard on the Project’ s impacts on its 
members’ constitutional rights under HRS Chapter 269. 
 
The compulsory “redo,” the PUC stated, covered the waiver 
determination since “[t] he issue of the waiver, along with all 
the other findings and conclusions in the 2017 D&O, were vacated 
by the Court’s decision [in HELCO I].”1 
  On appeal, Hu Honua contests the PUC’s understanding 
of HELCO I’s effect on the 2017 waiver.  It asserts that HELCO I  
vacated only the PUC’s 2017 approval of the Amended PPA.  
Because HELCO I left the 2017 waiver intact, Hu Honua argues, 
the HELCO I  remand did not require the PUC to re-open the waiver 
issue.  For the reasons outlined below, we agree with Hu Honua: 
HELCO I  did not vacate the 2017 waiver and, by extension, did not 
require the PUC to revisit the threshold waiver issue. 
                         
1 In its briefing before this court, the PUC similarly stressed that because 
HELCO I “nullified” the 2017 waiver “along with the rest of the 2017 D&O,” 
the Commission was required to “start again on remand, as if the 2017 D&O had 
never been rendered, including with respect to HELCO’s request for a waiver.”  And again, during oral argument, the PUC advanced the same explanation of why 
it had to revisit the waiver issue on remand: 
 
[S]o this Court’s HELCO I opinion specifically said that 
the Commission . . . was to conduct proceedings in 
accordance with this Court’s opinion and because this Court 
completely vacated the Commission’s decision, in its 
entirety, with respect, there was no waiver left on the 
record. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 II. DISCUSSION 
On remand, a trial court must closely adhere to the 
true intent and meaning of the appellate court’s mandate.  See 
State v. Lincoln, 72 Haw. 480, 485, 825 P.2d 64, 68 (1992) 
(quoting 5 Am.Jur.2d Appeal and Error § 991 (1962 & Supp.1991) 
(footnote omitted)).  Likewise, administrative agencies are 
bound by reviewing courts’ remand orders.  See Fed. Power Comm’n 
v. Pac. Power & Light Co., 307 U.S. 156, 160 (1939). 
The “true intent and meaning” of a reviewing court’s 
mandate is not to be found in a solitary word or 
decontextualized phrase, but rather in the opinion, as a whole, 
read in conjunction with the judgment and interpreted in light 
of the case’s procedural history and context.  See Frost v. 
Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 813 S.W.2d 302, 305 (Mo. 1991)( “It is 
well settled that the mandate is not to be read and applied in a 
vacuum.  The opinion is part of the mandate and must be used to 
interpret the mandate . . . .”) (cleaned up).2 
The first sentence of our opinion in HELCO I describes 
the case as arising from “the [PUC’s] approval of an [Amended 
PPA] between [HELCO] and Hu Honua Bioenergy, LLC.”  And all of 
                         
2 The “cleaned up” parenthetical signals that extraneous material such as 
internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations have been excised from a 
quote, and that these removals have not changed the meaning of the quoted 
text.   See, e.g., Brownback v. King, 141 S.Ct. 740, 748 (2021) (using 
“(cleaned up)”); Andrade v. Cty. of Hawaiʻi, 145 Hawai ʻi 265, 269, 451 P.3d 1, 
5 (App. 2019) (same); United States v. Reyes, 866 F.3d 316, 321 (5th Cir. 
2017) (same).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
6 the analysis and discussion that follow reflect our exclusive 
concern with the PUC’s consideration of the Amended PPA and 
LOL’s due process rights.  No party in HELCO I made an argument 
about the 2017 waiver.  There was no mention of the 2017 waiver 
in HELCO I.  Likewise, our judgment in HELCO I made clear that 
this court was concerned with the 2017 D&O only to the extent it 
addressed the Amended PPA.  The judgment read: 
Pursuant to the opinion of the Supreme Court of the State 
of Hawai‘ i entered on May 10, 2019, the Public Utilities 
Commission’s (PUC) Decision and Order No. 34726 filed on 
July 28, 2017, approving the Amended Power Purchase 
Agreement, is vacated and this case is remanded to the PUC 
for proceedings consistent with the opinion .
(Emphasis added.) 
The PUC’s interpretation of HELCO I’s implications for 
the 2017 waiver rests on a single phrase in the opinion’s last 
sentence: “[t]he PUC’s 2017 D&O is therefore vacated  . . . .”  
The PUC reads these seven words as vacating the 2017 waiver, 
which was issued as part of the 2017 D&O.  But this 
interpretation only works if everything else in the HELCO I 
opinion and the language of the judgment is ignored.  This 
blinkered approach is unreasonable given that the scope of 
remand is determined “ not by formula, but by inference from the 
opinion as a whole.”  United States v. Parker, 101 F.3d 527, 528 
(7th Cir. 1996).   
HELCO I focused on ensuring that the PUC complied with 
its statutory and constitutional obligations and respected LOL’s *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
7 due process rights in connection with the PUC’s consideration of
the Amended PPA.  So, it was unreasonable for the PUC to view 
HELCO I  as requiring that the PUC potentially thwart the need for
that consideration by revisiting the threshold waiver issue.  
This is particularly true given that within the body of the 
opinion, the court explicitly delimited the purpose of the 
remand.  “On remand,” the court stated, “the PUC shall give 
explicit consideration to the reduction of GHG emissions in 
determining whether to approve the Amended PPA, and make the 
findings necessary for this court to determine whether the PUC 
satisfied its obligations under HRS § 269-6(b).”  HELCO I at 25, 
445 P.3d at 697.  These remand instructions circumscribed the scope of the attendant vacatur.  
The PUC should have examined HELCO I’s final line “in 
conjunction with the opinion of the appellate tribunal and the 
particular facts, circumstances, and procedural history of the 
case . . . ” SugarHouse HSP Gaming, L.P. v. Pennsylvania Gaming 
Control Bd., 162 A.3d 353, 371 (Pa. 2017).  Had it done so, it 
would have understood that HELCO I did not disturb, modify, or 
vacate the 2017 waiver.  The court used the “2017 D&O” in the 
final sentence of the opinion as a synecdoche for those parts of 
the D&O that were implicated by the court’s discussion of the 
case on appeal. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 Because HELCO I had no impact on the 2017 waiver, the 
waiver was still in effect when the PUC re-opened Docket No. 
2017-0122.  It was still in effect when the PUC issued Order No. 
37205.  And it was still in effect when the PUC denied Hu 
Honua’s motion for reconsideration.3 
The PUC’s Order Nos. 37205 and 37306 are predicated, 
both logically and legally, on the PUC’s misreading of HELCO I.  
They flow from the faulty premise that HELCO I nullified the 
2017 waiver when, in fact, the HELCO I opinion presumed the 
existence of that very same waiver.  The PUC’s wrong conclusion 
of law concerning HELCO I’s true intent and meaning is the 
antecedent of the two orders.  It is the orders’ but-for cause 
and as it falls, so must they too. 
III. CONCLUSION 
We vacate PUC Order Nos. 37205 and 37306.  
As a result, the parties are fixed in the same 
position they were in following HELCO I: the PUC’s 2017 approval 
of the Amended PPA remains vacated, the 2017 waiver remains 
valid and in force, and the PUC, in considering the Amended PPA, remains obligated to follow the instructions we provided in 
HELCO I.  We thus remand this case to the PUC for a hearing on 
the Amended PPA that “complies with procedural due process” as 
                         
3 We express no opinion as to the PUC’s discretion, if any, to address the 
2017 waiver; we merely hold that HELCO I and its remand instructions did not 
affect the waiver. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 well as the requirements of HRS Chapter 269.  The PUC’s post-
remand hearing: 
must afford LOL an opportunity to meaningfully address the 
impacts of approving the Amended PPA on LOL’ s members’ 
right to a clean and healthful environment, as defined by HRS Chapter 269. The hearing must also include express 
consideration of GHG emissions that would result from 
approving the Amended PPA, whether the cost of energy under the Amended PPA is reasonable in light of the potential for 
GHG emissions, and whether the terms of the Amended PPA are 
prudent and in the public interest, in light of its 
potential hidden and long- term consequences. 
 
HELCO I at 26, 445 P.3d at 698. 
The PUC shall re-open Docket No. 2017-0122 for 
proceedings consistent with this opinion and HELCO I forthwith.
