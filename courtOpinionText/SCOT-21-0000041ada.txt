LLC (Paeahu).  Electronically Filed

 The PPA followed competitive bidding that MECO and other 
electric utility companies collectively conducted in 2018.  
Paeahu was one of eight projects selected through this 
competitive procurement process.  Under the PPA, MECO would 
purchase renewable energy from Paeahu’s solar-plus-battery plant 
located within Ulupalakua Ranch on Maui (the Project).   
Appellant Pono Power Coalition (Pono Power), a Maui 
community group, asks this court to vacate the PUC’s approval of 
the PPA for two reasons.1   
First, Pono Power points to the winning bidders’ post-
selection use of the same counsel to negotiate non-price PPA 
terms.  It argues the PUC failed to evaluate the common 
counsel’s involvement under the “rule of reason,” a burden-
shifting standard created for Sherman Antitrust Act cases.      
Second, Pono Power asserts that the PUC failed to fulfill 
its public trust duties.  It claims the PUC merely catalogued 
the Project’s anticipated permits and left decision-making about 
trust resources to the agencies with jurisdiction over those 
permits.  Instead, Pono Power contends, the PUC should have made 
                         
1  As a third point of error, Pono Power contests the PUC’s conclusion 
that Paeahu satisfied its community outreach obligations.  This argument 
lacks merit.  The PUC reviewed evidence about Paeahu’s community engagement 
activities.  And it credited Paeahu’s responses to community concerns; Paeahu 
made design changes and explored an alternative location.  The PUC then found 
that Paeahu fulfilled its community outreach requirements.  We do not find 
clear error in the PUC’s findings.          *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 explicit findings that identified the affected trust resources 
and how they would be protected.           
We reject both arguments.    
We decline to inject antitrust standards into PPA approval 
proceedings.  Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes (HRS)2 chapter 269 already 
requires the PUC to examine potential anticompetitive practices.  
And those statutes equip the PUC with a framework for that 
analysis: they prescribe “the public interest” as the 
controlling principle.   
We hold that the PUC appropriately evaluated the 
allegations of anticompetitive conduct.  The PUC considered the 
circumstances relating to the winning bidders’ shared counsel, 
balanced other statutory factors, and found the PPA terms 
reasonable and in the public interest.  The PUC was not required 
to apply antitrust standards in this analysis.          
Next, we hold that the statutes governing the PUC’s PPA 
review – HRS §§ 269-6(b) and 269-145.5(b) - reflect the core 
public trust principles: the State and its agencies must protect 
and promote the justified use of Hawaiʻ i’s natural beauty and 
natural resources.  Thus, when there is no reasonable threat to 
a trust resource, satisfying those statutory provisions fulfills 
the PUC’s obligations as trustee.  But when a project poses a

as of the PUC’s Decision and Order 37340 approving the PPA.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 reasonable threat, the public trust principles require more from 
the PUC: the commission must assess that threat and make 
specific findings about the affected trust resource.  
Here, the record shows that the PUC conducted the statutory 
balancing.  Under HRS § 269-6(b), the PUC considered the need to 
mitigate the risks associated with fossil fuel-based energy; it 
also weighed other “technical, economic, environmental, and 
cultural considerations” under HRS § 269-145.5(b).  The PUC then 
found the PPA “in the public interest.”  Because the record 
lacks a reasonable threat to a trust resource, this public 
interest-minded balancing satisfied the PUC’s public trust 
duties.   
We affirm the PUC’s approval of the PPA.        
I.  
The Hawai‘i legislature has committed to protect the climate 
and mitigate climate change by reducing reliance on fossil fuels 
and converting to renewable energy sources.   
In 2015, the legislature took a decisive step: it set a 
goal to reach 100% renewable energy by 2045.  2015 Haw. Sess. 
Laws Act 97, § 2 at 245-46; HRS § 269-92(a)(6).     
To meet this target, the Hawaiian Electric Companies - 
MECO, Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc., and Hawaii Electric Light 
Company, Inc. – developed a plan to competitively procure grid-*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
5 
 scale renewable power supplies.  The PUC accepted this plan in 
2017.  
The first phase of competitive bidding began in early 2018.    
The Hawaiian Electric Companies issued requests for proposals 
(RFPs) for O‘ahu, Maui, and Hawai‘ i Island.  The RFPs reflected 
comments from interested stakeholders.  They also incorporated 
guidance from the PUC and PUC-appointed Independent Observers. 
The Hawaiian Electric Companies conducted multi-step bid 
evaluations.  The bidders’ pricing terms were set during this 
process.  The utility companies ultimately selected eight 
projects: four on Oʻahu, two on Maui, and two on Hawai‘ i Island.3    
Paeahu was one of the Maui projects.  
The Hawaiian Electric Companies negotiated PPAs for the 
winning projects.  Only non-price terms were discussed since the 
projects’ prices had already been fixed.  During this PPA 
negotiation phase, one law firm represented the developers for 
the selected projects (the Finalists).  
MECO and Paeahu agreed on the PPA terms.  The Independent 
Observer overseeing MECO’s RFP process (the IO) concluded that 
MECO conducted bid evaluations and PPA negotiations on a “fair 
and consistent basis.”  
                         
3  Four developers submitted these eight projects. 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
6 
 MECO submitted the PPA for the PUC’s approval.4  Besides 
MECO, the Division of Consumer Advocacy (Consumer Advocate or 
CA) became a party to the PPA approval proceeding.5 
Pono Power then moved to intervene or participate in the 
PPA approval proceeding.  Recognizing Pono Power members’ right 
to a clean and healthful environment, the PUC granted Pono Power 
participant status.  After considering Paeahu’s motion, the PUC 
also made it a participant. 
The PUC held a two-day evidentiary hearing in December 
2019.  Witnesses testified and were cross-examined; they 
discussed the RFP process, PPA negotiations, pricing, greenhouse 
gas (GHG) analysis, community outreach, and Paeahu’s studies 
relating to the Project’s impact on cultural and natural 
resources.  Both before and after the hearing, the parties and 
participants submitted and responded to information requests 
related to these issues.  
In October 2020, the PUC approved the PPA.  It issued 
Decision and Order No. 37340 (the Approval Order).  After 
                         
4  MECO asked the PUC to review its requests in two stages: (1) addressing 
its PPA- related requests (including the recovery of costs associated with the 
PPA) first and (2) considering its request to construct an above- ground line 
extension later.  The PUC granted the request.  This appeal concerns the 
first stage.      
5  The CA participated as an ex officio party per HRS § 269-51 and Hawaiʻ i 
Administrative Rules (HAR) § 16
-601-62(a).  HRS § 269-51(a) requires the CA 
to “represent, protect, and advance the interests of all consumers . . . of 
utility services.”   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
7 
 investigating concerns about the Finalists’ common counsel and 
weighing environmental and other statutory considerations, the 
PUC found the PPA “in the public interest.”  
Pono Power moved for reconsideration of the approval.  The 
PUC denied that motion in Order No. 37553 (the Recon Order). 
 Pono Power appeals both the Approval and Recon Orders.    
It asks this court to vacate the PPA approval, alleging two 
primary deficiencies in the PUC’s findings: (1) the PUC did not apply the rule of reason to evaluate the Finalists’ post-
selection choice of counsel; and (2) the PUC did not make 
affirmative findings about trust resources affected by the 
Project.   
Both arguments fail.     
II.  
Pono Power’s first argument targets the Finalists’ use of 
the same counsel to negotiate non-price PPA terms.  Pono Power 
invokes the Sherman Act.  It contends the PUC failed to apply 
the “rule of reason” - a burden-shifting standard for assessing 
antitrust claims - to evaluate anticompetitive concerns 
surrounding the Finalists’ common counsel.  
The rule of reason involves “a fact-specific assessment of 
market power and market structure . . . to assess the 
[challenged conduct’s] actual effect on competition.”  Ohio v. 
Am. Express Co., __ U.S. __, 138 S. Ct. 2274, 2284 (2018) *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
8 
 (emphasis added) (citation and internal quotation marks 
omitted).   
Under this rule, the plaintiff has the initial burden to 
show the challenged activity’s “substantial anticompetitive 
effect.”  NCAA v. Alston, __ U.S. __, 141 S. Ct. 2141, 2160 
(2021) (citation omitted).  If the plaintiff does this, the 
burden shifts to the defendant to show a “procompetitive 
rationale” for the activity.6  Id. (citation omitted).   
Pono Power says it produced evidence showing “how bidders’ 
collusion . . . harmed competition.”  It highlights two facts to 
support this accusation: (1) after the bid selection, all 
Finalists hired the same legal counsel to negotiate non-price 
PPA terms; and (2) some of those terms were similar or identical 
across the projects.  So, Pono Power claims, the PUC should have 
shifted the burden to the PPA proponents and required them to 
prove that the sharing of counsel was “not a restraint of 
trade.”  The PUC did not engage in this burden shifting.  This 
failure to apply the rule of reason, Pono Power argues, was 
reversible error.7  
                         
6  If the defendant satisfies this second step, the plaintiff must then 
show “less anticompetitive means” to achieve the “procompetitive 
efficiencies.”  Alston, __ U.S. at __, 141 S. Ct. at 2160 (citation omitted).   
7  Pono Power also invokes the Sherman Act’s “per se” and “quick look” 
standards.  Courts use these analytical shortcuts in limited circumstances 
where the challenged activities’ anticompetitive effects are immediately 
apparent.  See Alston, __ U.S. at __, 141 S. Ct. at 2156 (“[S] ome agreements 
among competitors so obviously threaten to reduce output and raise prices 
that they might be condemned as unlawful per se or rejected after only a *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
9 
 We reject Pono Power’s attempt to inject antitrust 
standards into PPA approval proceedings.  
First, Pono Power cites no authority for that position.  It 
fails to provide, and we have not found, any cases that applied 
antitrust standards in public utility PPA approval proceedings.   
 Second, the PUC has no power to adjudicate alleged 
violations of federal or state antitrust laws.  The PUC is not 
the right forum to litigate antitrust claims; courts are.  See 
15 U.S.C. § 4 (granting jurisdiction to “prevent and restrain” 
violations of the Sherman Act (§§ 1-7) to federal district 
courts); HRS § 480-21 (designating appropriate courts where 
actions or proceedings authorized by HRS chapter 480’s antitrust 
statutes are to be initiated).     
 Third, the PUC’s governing laws already require the 
commission to assess allegations of collusion or anticompetitive 
practices; they also provide the framework for that assessment.   
The PUC must always act in the public interest.  This 
principle is incorporated throughout HRS chapter 269.  See, 
                         
quick look.”).  Pono Power fails to meaningfully explain why these tests are 
applicable here.   
Further, in its reply briefs, Pono Power raises new arguments alleging 
violations of HRS § 480-2 (prohibiting unfair or deceptive trade practices ) 
and HRS § 480-4 (forbidding restraints of trade).  Pono Power waived these 
arguments.  See Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule  28(b)(4) 
(requiring “[a] concise statement of the points of error” in opening briefs); 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(7)(“Points not argued [in opening briefs] may be deemed waived.”).      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
10           
 e.g., HRS § 269-16.22 (disallowing a utility’s recovery of power 
purchase costs if the PUC finds them to have been incurred “in 
bad faith” or “in violation of law”); HRS § 269-27.2(c) 
(providing the PUC authority to determine as appropriate “the 
just and reasonable rate” for non-fossil fuel-generated 
electricity supplied to a utility company); HRS § 269-145.5(b) (“In advancing the public interest, the commission shall balance 
technical, economic, environmental, and cultural considerations 
associated with modernization of the electric grid . . . .”).     
This “public interest” analysis will be incomplete unless 
the PUC examines potentially anticompetitive conduct.  Cf. Cent. 
Iowa Power Coop. v. FERC, 606 F.2d 1156, 1162 (D.C. Cir. 1979) 
(“Although the [Federal Power Commission] lacks authority to 
adjudicate violations of the antitrust laws, it must consider 
competitive factors when acting under the public interest 
mandate of the [Federal Power Act].”).  The PUC’s 2006 adoption 
of the Framework for Competitive Bidding reflects this view; this framework generally requires electric utilities to use a 
competitive bidding process to acquire “a future generation 
resource or block of generation resources.”  
Thus, when anticompetitive concerns arise, the PUC must 
assess them within the statutory “public interest” analysis.  
But the PUC is not required to use antitrust standards to do 
that.     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
11 
 A question remains: did the PUC properly discharge its duty 
to assess potential anticompetitive issues in approving the PPA? 
It did.      
The PUC did not dodge the concerns about the Finalists’ 
shared counsel.  It investigated; it made specific findings.  
The Approval Order reflects that the PUC considered the vetting 
mechanisms built into the procurement process; they included the 
IO’s oversight throughout the bidding and PPA negotiation phases.  The PUC then concluded it had sufficient assurance that 
the PPA was negotiated “in good faith and without collusion.”    
It determined that Paeahu’s choice of counsel did not have “any 
adverse impact on the pricing and terms of the PPA.”  The PUC in 
the end found the PPA terms “prudent and in the public 
interest.”  
The record supports the PUC’s findings.  The Independent 
Observer and the State Consumer Advocate found no evidence of 
collusion.  As the IO reported to the PUC, the RFP and PPA negotiation processes were “performed on a fair and consistent 
basis.”  
Further, the IO and the CA did not find any adverse impact 
caused by the Finalists’ post-selection sharing of counsel.  The 
IO concluded the negotiated PPA terms were “not unfair” to 
losing bidders; it also determined that those terms “[did] not 
materially alter the risk balance” between MECO and Paeahu as *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
12 
 originally contemplated.  The CA similarly did not believe the 
Finalists’ sharing of counsel resulted in direct harm to 
customers.8  
Pono Power does not question the IO and the CA’s neutrality 
or credibility.  It instead raises cryptic concerns about the 
common counsel’s involvement in the PPA negotiations.  Pono 
Power claims that shared representation was “a red flag” and 
“inherently suspect.”  Beyond that, it points to some similarities in the negotiated terms across the Finalists’ PPAs.  
Yet, Pono Power doesn’t identify the problematic terms.  It 
provides no concrete explanation as to how any PPA term reflects 
collusion, anticompetitive injury, or harm to ratepayers in 
general.
9  Pono Power’s own antitrust expert belies its claim of 
anticompetitive harm; the expert testified that shared representation and contract standardization can have pro-
competitive benefits.  Pono Power’s vague, conclusory 
allegations do not undermine the PUC’s contrary findings.   
                         
8  The PUC also relied on the nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) signed by 
the Finalists.  As Pono Power’s antitrust expert acknowledged, NDAs are 
“certainly a step in the right direction.”  But we share Pono Power’s concern 
about NDAs’ effectiveness in preventing improper information sharing or 
collusion through common counsel.  This concern, however, is mitigated by the 
PUC’s duty to examine potentially anticompetitive actions.   
9  Pono Power also relies on the PPA’s unit price (which is slightly 
higher than the other selected projects’ prices ) as evidence of adverse 
impact flowing from the Finalists’ use of the same counsel.  This claim 
astounds.  The P roject’s price was a done deal before the alleged collusion 
happened; Pono Power should know it cannot be the basis for proving the 
challenged conduct’s anticompetitive harm.    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
13 
 Besides the anticompetitive issue, the PUC considered the 
undisputed evidence that the Project would reduce GHG emissions, 
mitigate risks associated with fossil fuel, and contribute to 
the State’s 100% renewable energy goal.  After examining these 
factors, the Project’s price, and other statutory 
considerations, see infra section III.B., the PUC found the PPA 
“in the public interest.”   
We do not find clear error in these findings.   
III. 
Pono Power next invokes Hawai‘ i’s public trust doctrine 
expressed in article XI, section 1 of our constitution.10   
Pono Power maintains the PUC should have made explicit 
findings identifying the affected trust resources and assessing 
how they would be protected.  Instead, Pono Power asserts, the 
PUC abandoned its trust responsibilities by concluding that 
other permitting agencies would review Paeahu’s studies relating 
to cultural and natural resources before they approve or deny 
the requested permits.  
                         
10  Article XI, section 1 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution reads:  
For the benefit of present and future generations, the 
State and its political subdivisions shall conserve and 
protect Hawaii’ s natural beauty and all natural resources, 
including land, water, air, minerals and energy sources, 
and shall promote the development and utilization of these 
resources in a manner consistent with their conservation and in furtherance of the self
-sufficiency of the State. 
All public natural resources are held in trust by the State for the benefit of the people. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
14 
 The PUC and the PPA proponents believe that the PUC 
fulfilled its trustee duties by carrying out its statutory 
mandates; namely, to consider fossil fuel-related harms under 
HRS § 269-6(b)11 and to balance “technical, economic, 
environmental and cultural” factors in advancing the public interest under HRS § 269-145.5(b).
12  
The PUC has public trust obligations.  See In re Gas Co., 
147 Hawaiʻ i 186, 207, 465 P.3d 633, 654 (2020) (directing the PUC 
                         
11  HRS § 269-6(b) requires the PUC to weigh several fossil fuel- related 
factors:  
(b) The public utilities commission shall consider the need 
to reduce the State’s reliance on fossil fuels through 
energy efficiency and increased renewable energy generation 
in exercising its authority and duties under this chapter. In making determinations of the reasonableness of the costs 
of utility system capital improvements and operations, the 
commission shall explicitly consider, quantitatively or 
qualitatively, the effect of the State’s reliance on fossil 
fuels on price volatility, export of funds for fuel 
imports, fuel supply reliability risk, and greenhouse gas 
emissions. . . .  
(Emphase s added.)  
12  HRS § 269-145.5(b) commands:  
(b) In advancing the public interest, the commission shall 
balance technical, economic, environmental, and cultural 
considerations associated with modernization of the 
electric grid, based on principles that include but are not 
limited to: 
(1) Enabling a diverse portfolio of renewable energy 
resources; 
(2) Expanding options for customers to manage their 
energy use; 
(3) Maximizing interconnection of distributed 
generation to the State’s electric grids on a cost-
effective basis at non- discriminatory terms and at 
just and reasonable rates, while maintaining the 
reliability of the State’s electric grids, and 
allowing such access and rates through applicable *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
15 
 to consider its constitutional trust obligations on remand).  
Though we signaled in In re Gas Co. that the PUC must hew to 
public trust principles, we have not explored the dimensions of its trustee duties.   
Pono Power’s second argument asks us to determine what 
public trust duties are occasioned by the PUC’s PPA approval 
process.  We first examine the contours of those duties.  We 
then consider whether the PUC’s approval of the PPA complied with those constitutional obligations.  We hold it did.  
A. 
The Hawaiʻ i Constitution offers vast and versatile public 
trust protections.  Article XI, section 1 of our constitution declares: “[a]ll public natural resources are held in trust by 
the State for the benefit of the people.”  Haw. Const. art. XI, 
§ 1.  Article XI, section 1 protections apply to present and 
future generations.  Id.  “[T]he State and its political 
subdivisions” must “conserve and protect Hawaii’s natural beauty 
                         
rules, orders, and tariffs as reviewed and approved 
by the commission; 
(4) Determining fair compensation for electric grid 
services and other benefits provided to customers and 
for electric grid services and other benefits 
provided by distributed generation customers and 
other non- utility service providers; and 
(5) Maintaining or enhancing grid reliability and 
safety through modernization of the State’ s electric 
grids.  
(Emphasis added.)  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
16 
 and natural resources.”  Id. (emphasis added).  In parallel, the 
State and its agencies must “promote the development and 
utilization of these resources in a manner consistent with their 
conservation and in furtherance of the self-sufficiency of the 
State.”  Id. (emphasis added).   
In essence, article XI, section 1 directs the State and its 
agencies to assess and balance “protection” and “utilization” of 
public trust resources.  In re Conservation Dist. Use 
Application (CDUA) HA-3568, 143 Hawai‘ i 379, 400, 431 P.3d 752, 
773 (2018) (Mauna Kea II).   
Beyond these core principles, the public trust doctrine’s 
dimensions adapt to the circumstances.  See Lānaʻ ia ns  for 
Sensible Growth v. Land Use Comm’n, 146 Hawaiʻ i 496, 507, 463 
P.3d 1153, 1164 (2020) (“The public trust, by its very nature, 
does not remain fixed for all time, but must conform to changing 
needs and circumstances.” (Citation omitted.)); Mauna Kea II, 
143 Hawaiʻ i at 401 n.24, 431 P.3d at 774 n.24 (declining to 
“wholesale adopt” our water trust precedent in the land trust 
context because different constitutional and statutory 
provisions may “play a part” in defining the trust principles governing the land at issue).  
Here, the PUC’s PPA review implicates unique policy goals 
and practical considerations.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
17 The PUC’s regulatory mission is broad.  The PUC must ensure 
the reliability of Hawaiʻ i’s electric system.  HRS chapter 269, 
Part IX.  It must also safeguard energy affordability; all rates 
charged by electric utilities must be “just and reasonable.”  
HRS § 269-16(a).  Alongside these technical and economic duties, 
the PUC must consider the State’s dependence on fossil fuels and 
the fast-approaching 100% renewable energy goal.  HRS §§ 269-6, 
269-92.  These considerations are intended to mitigate the
unhealthy effects of climate change.  See infra n.15.
Given the PUC’s distinctive mission to fortify the State’s 
power system while focusing on climate change mitigation, we 
decline to superimpose the water or land trust jurisprudence into the PPA approval context.   
Rather, the core public trust principles articulated in 
article XI, section 1 should guide the PUC: it must assess and 
balance “protect[ion]” and “utilization” of public trust 
resources when it reviews a PPA.  Haw. Const. art. XI, § 1.  
This duty heightens when the proposed project poses a 
reasonable
 threat to a trust resource.  In that situation, the 
PUC as a trustee must further assess that threat; and to approve
the project’s PPA, it must affirmatively find that there is no 
harm to the trust resource or that potential harm is justified. 
141, 173, 324 P.3d 951, 983 (2014) (“If there is a reasonable See Kauai Springs, Inc. v. Planning Comm’n of Kauaʻ i, 133 Hawai‘ i 
 
 18 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
allegation of harm to one of the uses protected by the public   
trust, then the [permit] applicant must demonstrate that there 
is no harm in fact or that any potential harm does not preclude
a finding that the requested use is nevertheless reasonable and
beneficial.” (Emphases added.)); cf. Ching v. Case, 145 Hawai ‘i 
148, 177, 449 P.3d 1146, 1175 (2019) (recognizing “a duty to 
investigate upon being made aware of evidence of possible 
damage” to trust property as “a necessary component of [a 
trustee’s] general duty”).  13 
 
A “reasonable” threat does not mean that there must be 
conclusive evidence of harm.  But it means something more than 
vague and tenuous concerns about a project’s surrounding 
environment; there must be tangible evidence that reasonably 
connects the threatened harm to the proposed project.   
B. 
We now examine whether the PUC satisfied its public trust 
obligations.  
13The dissent relies on Ching to assert that the PUC must independently 
investigate evidence of “possible” damage to specific public trust resources 
when it reviews a PPA.  We are unpersuaded by this argument.  Ching 
recognized an agency’s duty to investigate potential harm in the context of 
examining that agency’s continuing duty to monitor the relevant trust 
property after it authorized the use of that property.  Ching, 145 Hawaiʻ i at 
152, 176- 78, 449 P.3d at 1150, 1174- 76.  In such “monitoring” situations, 
where a party has permission to use trust resources and may even already be 
using them, the risk of “impending damage” is concrete.   Id. at 152, 449 P.3d 
at 1150.  Evidence of “possible” harm can quickly turn into real, irreparable 
damage.  But in the PPA review context, the range of “possible” harm is more 
open-ended; to require the PUC to pursue every hint of “possible” harm would 
cause goose chases that we cannot endorse.  We conclude Kauai Spring’s 
“reasonable[ness]” standard is more appropriate here.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
19 
 We hold that the PUC’s PPA review aligned with its public 
trust duties.  The PUC balanced various statutory factors to 
support its “public interest” findings.  Because the record 
lacks credible evidence that the Project posed a reasonable 
threat to a trust resource, the PUC’s weighing of environmental 
and other public interest factors within its statutory framework 
satisfied its trustee obligations.  
An agency’s constitutional public trust obligations are 
independent of its statutory mandates.  Kauai Springs, 133 
Hawai‘i at 172, 324 P.3d at 982.   
But they operate in tandem.  An agency “must perform its 
statutory function in a manner that fulfills the State’s 
affirmative constitutional obligations.”  Lānaʻ ians for Sensible 
Growth, 146 Hawai‘ i at 506, 463 P.3d at 1163 (citation omitted).  
At the same time, an agency’s governing statutes and regulatory 
provisions provide “the context for applying the broad 
principles of the public trust doctrine to the specific task 
faced by the agency.”  Kauai Springs, 133 Hawai‘ i at 184, 324 
P.3d at 994 (Recktenwald, C.J., concurring and dissenting).  
That is because an agency “can only wield powers expressly or implicitly granted to it by statute.”  Morgan v. Planning Dep’t, 
Cnty. of Kauai, 104 Hawai‘ i 173, 184, 86 P.3d 982, 993 (2004) 
(citation omitted).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
20 
 An agency’s public trust and statutory mandates can be co-
extensive.  See In re Water Use Permit Applications, 94 Hawaiʻ i 
97, 145, 9 P.3d 409, 457 (2000) (acknowledging that the State 
Water Code’s policy provisions “mirror[] the public trust 
principles”).  They were here.    
In approving the PPA, the PUC followed HRS §§ 269-6 and 
269-145.5.    
Under HRS § 269-6(b), the PUC must consider “the need to 
reduce the State’s reliance on fossil fuels through energy 
efficiency and increased renewable energy generation.”  It must 
explicitly assess “the effect of the State’s reliance on fossil 
fuels on price volatility, export of funds for fuel imports, 
fuel supply reliability risk, and greenhouse gas emissions.”  
HRS § 269-6(b) (emphasis added).   
A primary purpose of this provision is to combat “air 
pollution” and “potentially harmful climate change” stemming 
from “the release of harmful greenhouse gases.”  In re Maui 
Elec. Co., 141 Hawaiʻ i 249, 263, 408 P.3d 1, 15 (2017) (In re 
MECO) (emphases added) (quoting H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1004, 
in 2011 House Journal, at 1332).    
So public trust considerations – namely, those related to 
protection of air and other trust resources affected by climate change - are built into HRS § 269-6(b).     
Further, under HRS § 269-145.5(a), the PUC must consider *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
21 
 the value of improving the State’s electrical system by using 
“advanced grid modernization technology.”  HRS § 269-145.5(b) 
provides further guidance: “In advancing the public interest, 
the commission shall balance technical, economic, environmental, 
and cultural considerations associated with modernization of the 
electric grid . . . .”  (Emphasis added.)  These “environmental” 
and “cultural” considerations implicate public trust resources.  
The PUC must balance those considerations against other technical and economic factors to promote “the public 
interest.”14   
We hold that the “public interest”-minded balancing 
requirement under HRS §§ 269-6(b) and 269-145.5(b) aligns withthe core public trust principles weighing protection and 
utilization.            
15 
                         
14  HRS § 269-145.5(b) provides five principles that the PUC should use 
when conducting this public interest balancing.  They include “[e]nabling a 
diverse portfolio of renewable energy resources. ”  HRS § 269-145.5(b)(1).  
This subsection complements HRS § 269-6(b)’s focus on moving away from fossil 
fuel-generated power and curbing climate change, while requiring the PUC to 
assess other statutory factors.   
15  HRS chapter 269 also intersects with article XI, section 9 of the 
Hawai‘i Constitution .  In Hawaiʻ i, a person enjoys a substantive right to “a 
clean and healthful environment.”
  Haw. Const. art. XI, § 9 ; In re MECO, 141 
Hawai ‘i at 260 -61, 408 P.3d at 12-13.  Though this right is constitutionally 
vested, its parameters are defined by “laws relating to environmental quality.”  Haw. Const. art. XI, § 9 .  “HRS Chapter 269 is a law relating to 
environmental quality that defines the right to a clean and healthful 
environment.”  In re MECO, 141 Hawai‘ i
 at 264 , 408 P.3d at 16.  Recognizing 
Pono Power members’ right to a clean and healthful environment, the PUC 
granted Pono Power participant status.    
Article XI, section 9’s “ clean and healthful environment” right as 
defined by HRS chapter 269 subsumes a right to a life- sustaining climate 
system.  The need to mitigate the catastrophic effects of anthropogenic *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
22 
                          
climate change underlies HRS chapter 269; it in turn shapes and defines the 
right to a clean and healthful environment.    
HRS chapter 269 imposes an obligation on the PUC to consider fossil 
fuel-related harms and promote climate change mitigation.  HRS § 269-6(b) 
reflects this overarching mission.  This statute applies to “all of the 
[PUC’s] duties”; it requires the commission “to reduce reliance on fossil 
fuels and to consider [GHG] emissions.”  In re MECO, 141 Hawai ‘i at 263, 408 
P.3d at 15.  The legislative history reveals an intent to require the PUC to 
consider “the hidden and long- term costs of reliance on fossil fuels.”  Id.  
The legislature believed those costs included “potentially harmful climate 
change due to the release of harmful [GHG].”  Id. (quoting H. Stand. Comm. 
Rep. No. 1004, in 2011 House Journal, at 1332).  Besides HRS § 269-6(b), HRS 
chapter 269 contains additional provisions reflecting the legislature’s 
concerns about climate change and the resulting push toward renewable energy.  
See, e.g., HRS § 269-27.2 (providing guidance on utilization of non- fossil 
fuel-generated power supply); HRS § 269-92(a) (imposing renewable portfolio 
standards).    
In 2020, the Hawai ‘i legislature passed a law preventing the PUC from 
approving any new or renewed coal power- based PPAs.  2020 Haw. Sess. Law Act 
23, § 2 at 287; HRS § 269-48.  The legislature recognized that coal- powered 
electricity poses a “clear threat . . . to health and the climate.”  2020 
Haw. Sess. Law Act 23, § 1 at 287.  It referenced the United Nations 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 2018 “Special Report on 
1.5 Degrees Celsius.”  Id.  The legislature explained the special report 
found that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius to “avoid 
devastating climate change” would mean “ a complete phase- out” of coal-
generated electricity.  Id. (emphasis added).    
There is scientific consensus: a nthropogenic global warming threatens 
the world’s climate system.  It raises the seas; it sickens the planet.  It 
harms present and future generations.  See generally Summary for Policymakers 
in Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis, IPCC (Valérie Masson-

Hawaiʻi’s space  on Earth makes us vulnerable to the ecological damage 
caused by an unhealthy climate system.  R ecognizing this threat, the Hawaiʻ i 
legislature recently declared “a climate emergency.”  S.C.R. 44, S.D. 1, H.D. 
1, 31st Leg., Reg. Sess. (2021).  It warned that “Hawaii remains particularly 
vulnerable to the dangers of disaster occurrences as a result of the effects 
of global warming.”  Id.  The resolution calls for “statewide collaboration 
toward an immediate just transition and emergency mobilization effort to 
restore a safe climate.”  Id.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
23 
 Here, the record shows that the PUC complied with HRS 
§§ 269-6(b) and 269-145.5(b).  In the Approval Order, the PUC 
made detailed findings to satisfy these provisions.       
First, the PUC reviewed MECO’s GHG analysis, methodology, 
and data.  The PUC found that the Project would result in “a 
significant reduction in Lifecycle and Operational GHG emissions 
relative to the baseline of no Project.”  This finding implies 
that the Project would help protect air and other trust resources affected by anthropogenic global warming.               
Second, the PUC evaluated Hawai‘ i’s energy policy and the 
Project’s anticipated bill savings.  It found that the PPA represented “a significant step not only towards Hawaii’s renewable energy goals . . . but also towards lower energy 
prices.”  
Third, the PUC considered the benefits of having 
dispatchable renewable energy, including the increased 
flexibility and reliability of 
Hawai‘i’s electric grids.   
Fourth, the PUC identified (1) the permits that Paeahu 
would have to obtain to construct and operate its solar plant; 
(2) the impact studies16 related to those permits; (3) which 
                         
These legislative actions reflect the urgent need to curb greenhouse 
gas emissions and protect the right to a life- sustaining climate system.  
16  In the Approval Order, the PUC explained that Paeahu filed several 
studies covering topics including: “traffic, noise, land uses (soils, 
topography, geology, vegetation), water quality, archaeological impacts, 
cultural impacts, wildlife, electric and magnetic fields (‘EMF’), ‘heat 
island’ effects, and glint and glare issues.”  For each topic, the PUC *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
24 
 agency would review them; and (4) under what statutes, 
regulations, or ordinances.  
The PUC referred to Paeahu’s explanation that the studies’ 
intended audience was the permit-issuing agencies with the 
relevant subject matter expertise.  The PUC concluded that those 
agencies with jurisdiction over the necessary permits would 
review the impact studies and make permitting decisions.  
Contrary to Pono Power’s claim, the PUC did not merely “catalog[ue]” the requisite permits.  
 Fifth, the PUC considered Paeahu’s efforts to explore an 
alternative site.  Relocating the Project to this alternative 
site, the PUC found, was not feasible due to archaeological, 
cultural, and topographical concerns.  It “conclude[d] that 
Paeahu ha[d] made a good-faith effort to minimize the 
environmental, cultural, and archeological impacts of the 
Project”; the PUC qualified its conclusion by noting that other 
permitting agencies would “further review” the Project.   “[U]pon balance of the technical, economic, environmental,
and cultural considerations,” the PUC found the PPA “in the 
public interest.”   
                         
identified record- citations where the topic was discussed.  Though the PUC 
omitted the words, “public trust resources ,” its findings evince meaningful 
and diligent efforts to appraise the range of trust resources potentially 
affected by the Project.  By doing so, the PUC implicitly identified the 
scope of the affected public trust resources.  The PUC’s efforts are 
consistent with its trustee duties given that the record lacks a reasonable threat to a trust resource.        *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
25 
  The PUC did not make explicit findings about its public
trust duties in the Approval Order.  But its Recon Order 
concluded that it had fulfilled its public trust duties by 
satisfying its obligations under HRS §§ 269-6(b) and 269-
145.5(b).   17 
 Pono Power challenges this conclusion.  It claims the 
public trust doctrine required more: it says the PUC needed to 
make specific findings about each affected public trust resource.  We disagree.        
In the Recon Order, the PUC concluded that Pono Power’s 
allegations about the Project’s adverse impact on various trust 
resources were “speculative or unsupported.”  This determination 
was not clearly erroneous.  
Pono Power participated in the PPA proceedings.  It raised 
concerns about the Project’s impacts on the surrounding 
environment.  Those concerns included potential water runoff and 
damages to native flora.  
Pono Power had the chance to boost its claims of harm to 
trust resources.  Yet, Pono Power’s support for its position is scant.  Pono Power backs up its water runoff allegation with its 
president’s testimony: she saw surface runoff near the Project 
                         
17  We read the Approval and Recon Orders together.  Cf. Alaska Dep’ t of 
Env’t Conservation v. EPA, 540 U.S. 461, 497 (2004) (recognizing that an 
agency’s “skeletal” orders could be “properly read together with accompanying 
explanatory correspondence” from that agency).    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
26 
 area during moderate storms.  She submitted two after-rain 
photographs and one dry-day photograph of a nearby gulch.  
The testimony and photographs showed that water runoff 
happens in the neighborhood, not whether and how the Project 
would exacerbate any water runoff issue.  Pono Power does not 
meaningfully explain the connection between the Project and the 
alleged harm to water resources.  
Regarding the potential impact to native flora, Pono Power 
submitted a four-sentence “Anonymous Note”: the note mentioned that wiliwili trees and other native plants grow in unidentified 
gulches near the Project.
18  It also submitted a general article 
about wiliwili forest habitat in the nearby area.19  The 
Anonymous Note and the article do not reasonably establish a 
link between the Project and the alleged harm to those trees and 
plants.20       
                         
18  Our discussion of Pono Power’s president’s testimony and the A nonymous 
Note is not meant to “discredit” or “devalue” testimony based on personal 
observation.  Rather, it is to point out that the personal observations 
relied on by Pono Power (the observations that water runoff happens and 
native vegetation exists in or near the Project area) do not adequately explain how the P roject would harm the relevant resources.         
19  The dissent refers to this article as the “Altenberg report.”  T his 
report was drafted in 2007 for an unrelated project known as “Wailea 670.”    
That project is “adjacent” to the Paeahu site.  So it appears that the report 
doesn’t cover Paeahu’s location.   Further, even within the Wailea 670 area, 
the report observed, “the northern 5/6 of [the land was] devoid of endemic 
Hawaiian plants.”  This suggests that native flora can vary significantly 
throughout the Wailea region; and that the existence of wiliwili trees in 
some areas within the proposed project boundaries doesn’t necessarily mean 
they would be harmed.   
20  Beyond its limited support for the purported harm to trust resources, 
Pono Power generally questioned Paeahu’s impact assessments and best *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
27 
 Pono Power responded to the PUC’s conclusion that its 
allegations were “speculative or unsupported” with an 
unsupported, conclusory statement: “[t]he harm is presumed 
because the resources are part of a public trust.”  This 
sweeping assertion flops.  
We conclude that the PUC properly evaluated Pono Power’s 
allegations of harm.  It did not clearly err.  Hand-waving 
without meaningful support cannot establish a “reasonable” threat.  The heightened duty to assess and make specific 
findings about the affected trust resources was not triggered 
here.  And the PUC’s statutory balancing sufficiently satisfied 
its public trust duties.   
Pono Power also questions the PUC’s recognition of other 
permitting agencies’ “overlapping jurisdiction” regarding the 
Project.  It challenges the PUC’s conclusion that those agencies 
would review Paeahu’s impact studies and make permitting 
decisions based on their expertise and respective statutory and 
constitutional mandates.  By taking this position, Pono Power 
says, the PUC improperly delegated its public trust obligations.  
We disagree.21  
                         
management practices.  Pono Power’s sk epticism does not defeat the PUC’s 
factual finding that its allegations of harm were unsupported or speculative.  
21  Pono Power further claims that the PUC improperly delegated its public 
trust duties by
 “accept[ing] Paeahu’s representations regarding government 
approvals.”  Pono Power is correct that an agency cannot delegate its trust 
duty to a private party.  Lānaʻ ians for Sensible Growth, 146 Hawaiʻ i  at 507, 
463 P.3d at 1164.  But that did not happen here.  Though the PUC “accept[ ed]” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
28 
 An agency can recognize other agencies’ overlapping 
jurisdiction and their expertise in specific subject matters.  
See Alaloa v. Planning Comm’n of Maui, 68 Haw. 135, 137, 705 
P.2d 1042, 1044 (1985) (opining that the planning commission’s 
permit conditions requiring the applicant to obtain approvals 
from other agencies (including the State Department of Health) 
were not an unlawful delegation of duty partly because those 
agencies “have the expertise and objective criteria” for 
granting or denying approvals needed for the project’s 
construction).       
Further, the PUC’s acknowledgement of other agencies’ 
jurisdiction and expertise does not equate to abandoning its own 
duties.  Here the PUC fulfilled its public trust obligations by 
complying with its statutory duties.  Its comment about further 
oversight mechanisms over the Project’s construction and 
operation was “outside and in addition to” its public trust 
responsibilities; it does not amount to an improper delegation.  
Mauna Kea II, 143 Hawai‘ i at 397-98, 431 P.3d at 770-71.  
                         
Paeahu’s representations about the requisite governmental approvals, it did 
not take Paeahu’s words at face value.  The PUC exercised its due diligence 
by (1) directing Paeahu to file additional studies and (2) reviewed the 
statutes and other governing laws under which the relevant permitting 
agencies would examine those studies.  The record does not show that the PUC 
put the ultimate responsibility to protect trust resources on Paeahu.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
