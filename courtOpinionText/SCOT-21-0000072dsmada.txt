Reconsideration Filed October 22, 2020” in Case No. 1DA201002043.
A notice of appeal filed in the Intermediate Court of Appeals is
the appropriate means to seek such appellate review.  See HRS §

including an order on a motion for reconsideration, may appeal to
the intermediate appellate court upon the same terms and
conditions as in other cases in the circuit court, and review
shall be governed by chapter 602); HRS § 602-57(a) (the ICA has
jurisdiction “[t]o hear and determine appeals from any court or
agency when appeals are allowed by law”).  Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this original proceeding is
dismissed.  The clerk of the appellate court shall file the
documents in this original proceeding in the Intermediate Court
of Appeals.  The date of receipt of the document shall be deemed
the filing date.
