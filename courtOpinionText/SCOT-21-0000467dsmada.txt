SCOT-21-0000467 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI‘I 
IN THE PETITION OF 
 
ASSOCIATION OF UNIT OWNERS OF 988 HALEKAUWILA FOR DECLARATORY 
R
ELIEF AND FOR HEARING 
APPEAL FROM THE HAWAI# I COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
Upon review of appellant Association of Unit Owners of 
988 Halekauwila’s (“AOUO”) appeal from the Hawai‘i Community 
Development Authority’s (“HCDA”) July 7, 2021 “Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law, and Decision and Order Denying Petition for Declaratory Relief and For Hearing,” and the record, it appears that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over the appeal. 
HRS § 206E-5.6 governs appeals of contested cases of 
the HCDA regarding the acceptance of a developer’s proposal to develop lands under the authority’s control. HRS § 206E-5.6(h) specifically provides for an appeal from a contested case directly to the supreme court from a HCDA final decision and order or a preliminary ruling: 
Any party aggrieved by a final decision of the
authority regarding the acceptance of a developer’s
proposal to develop lands under the authority’scontrol may seek judicial review of the decisionwithin thirty days. Chapter 91 shall apply to thejudicial review except where chapter 91 conflicts withthis chapter, in which case this chapter shall apply.Any other law to the contrary notwithstanding,
including chapter 91, any contested case under this
chapter shall be appealed from a final decision and
order or a preliminary ruling that is of the naturedefined by section 91-14(a) upon the record directlyto the supreme court for final decision . Only a
person aggrieved in a contested case proceeding
provided for in this chapter may appeal from the finaldecision and order or preliminary ruling. 
For the 
purposes of this section, the term “person aggrieved”includes an agency that is a party to a contested caseproceeding before that agency or another agency. 
(Emphasis added.) 
Here, the HCDA’s July 7, 2021 decision and order 
denying the AOUO’s petition for declaratory relief was not issued 
as a result of a contested case proceeding or in a proceeding in which a hearing was required. See HRS § 91-1 (a contested case proceeding is “a proceeding in which the legal rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties are required by law to be determined after an opportunity for agency hearing”); HAR §§ 15-
219-84 and 15-219-85; Bush v. Hawaiian Homes Comm’n, 76 Hawai# i 
128, 134, 870 P.2d 1272, 1278 (1994) (“If the statute or rule 
governing the activity in question does not mandate a hearing prior to the administrative agency’s decision-making, the actions of the administrative agency are not ‘required by law’ and do not amount to ‘a final decision or order in a contested case.’”). Although HRS § 206E-5.6(h) provides authorization for a direct 
2 appeal to this court from a final decision and order of a 
contested case proceeding or a preliminary ruling that is of the nature defined by HRS § 91-14(a), neither apply here. Thus, HRS § 206E-5.6 does not provide the AOUO with the basis from which to appeal the HCDA’s July 7, 2021 decision and order directly to this court. See, e.g., In the Petition of Tawhiri Power LLC, 126 
Hawai#i 242, 269 P.3d 777 (App. 2012). This court lacks 
appellate jurisdiction over the appeal. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number 
SCOT-21-0000467 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 1, 2022.
