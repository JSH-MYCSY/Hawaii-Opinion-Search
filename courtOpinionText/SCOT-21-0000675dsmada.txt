Upon consideration of the document filed by Dianne K.
Hoapili, entitled, “Declaration of Divine Lovelore/Law Truth
Affidavit,” which was filed as a complaint on November 29, 2021,
this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the complaint and
provide the requested relief.  See HRS § 602-5.  Therefore,
It is ordered that the complaint is dismissed.
