IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI‘I 
 
 
In the Matter of the Application of 
 
HAWAI‘I ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY, INC. 
 
For Approval of a Power Purchase Agreement for Renewable 
Dispatchable Firm Energy and Capacity. 
 
 
APPEAL FROM THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION 
(Docket No. 2017-0122) 
 
ORDER GRANTING APPELLEE LIFE OF THE LAND’S MOTION TO DISMISS 
APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
 
 This court has jurisdiction over appeals from the Public 
Utilities Commission’s (PUC) “final decision” in a contested 
case.  See Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 91-14(a) (2012 & 
Supp. 2019), 269-15.51 (2020).  It also has jurisdiction over 
appeals from preliminary PUC rulings in contested cases if 
forcing the appellant to wait until the entry of a final decision would “deprive appellant of adequate relief.”  HRS 
§ 91-14(a). 
 Hu Honua Bioenergy, LLC (Hu Honua) appeals two PUC orders: Electronically Filed
Supreme Court
SCOT-22-0000024
04-FEB-2022

Dkt. 37 OGMD2 
 (1) Order No. 38169, “Denying Hu Honua Bioenergy, LLC’s 
Motion to Continue Hearing” (dated January 6, 2022); and 
(2) Order No. 38183, “Addressing Hu Honua Bioenergy, LLC’s Motion Regarding Applicability of HRS § 269-6” (dated 
January 13, 2022). 
These orders concern a contested case hearing.  But, as Hu 
Honua concedes, they are not “final decisions” of the PUC for 
the purposes of HRS §§ 91-14(a) or 269-15.51(a). 
Nor do they come within any of the recognized exceptions to 
the finality requirement.   
They aren’t collateral orders.  See Abrams v. Cades, 
Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai‘i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 
(1998) (stating requirements for appealability under the 
collateral order doctrine). 
They aren’t interlocutory orders.  See HRS § 641-1(b) 
(2016) (outlining requirements for an appeal from an 
interlocutory order). 
And they’re definitely not judgments for execution upon 
property.   See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai‘i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 
702, 704 (1995) (describing exception to the finality requirement for appeals from judgment for execution upon 
property). 
These are standard-issue preliminary orders.   3 
 The first is a denial of Hu Honua’s motion to continue an 
evidentiary hearing scheduled to start on January 31, 2022. 
An appeal taken from the denial of a motion to continue 
would be remarkable in any circumstance.  But this appeal is 
particularly outlandish because for months Hu Honua assented to 
and complied with the PUC’s procedural schedule.  Hu Honua said 
nothing when, in June 2021, the PUC said it expected to schedule 
the evidentiary hearing for “the week of January 10, 20211 
[sic].”  And in December 2021, when the Consumer Advocate moved 
to push the evidentiary hearing from the week of January 10th to 
the week of January 24th, Hu Honua responded by saying it “has 
confirmed that all of its witnesses are available during the 
week of January 24, 2022 and, therefore, has no objection to the 
Consumer Advocate’s Motion for Enlargement of Time.”  Then, for 
weeks after the PUC’s December 7, 2021 order (Order No. 38104), 
setting a virtual evidentiary hearing for the week of January 
31, 2022,2 Hu Honua continued adhering to the PUC’s procedural 
schedule.  It filed its prehearing statement of position and 
                                                           
1  The “2021” was a typographical error; the PUC’s procedural schedule on 
remand came out in June 2021 and set the “prehearing conference” for January 
4, 2022, so Hu Honua knew from context that the evidentiary hearing was set 
for the week of January 10, 2022. 
 
2  Hu Honua did not move to reconsider Order No. 38104.  See Hawai‘i 
Administrative Rules § 16-601-137 (requiring that a motion for 
reconsideration of a PUC order be filed within ten days after the order is served on the party). 4 
 witness list, for instance, without voicing any objections to 
the hearing’s date or its virtual format. 
Only in early January 2022 did Hu Honua move to continue 
the evidentiary hearing.  When it didn’t get its way, see Order 
No. 38169, Hu Honua decided to appeal the PUC’s denial of its scheduling motion to this court.   
Hu Honua also appeals the PUC’s Order No. 38183.  In that 
order, the PUC clarified its interpretation of its statutory obligations under HRS Section 269(b), as amended by Act 82.  
In Matter of Hawai‘ i Electric Light Co., Inc., 149 Hawai‘ i
  
239, 487 P.3d 708 (2021), we told the PUC to “re-open Docket No. 2017-0122 for proceedings consistent with this opinion . . . forthwith.”  Id. at 242, 487 P.3d at 711 (emphasis added).  The 
PUC was doing just that until Hu Honua decided to appeal two non-final, non-appealable preliminary orders. 
If Hu Honua disagrees with a “final decision” in Docket No. 
2017-0122 - for example because it thinks the PUC relied on a 
misreading of a relevant statute in reaching that final decision 
- it may appeal the PUC’s decision to this court.  See HRS 
§§ 91-14(a), 269-15.51(a).  And we will judiciously and fairly 
consider the merits of its arguments in due course. 
But until the PUC issues a final decision - or some other 
decision immediately appealable under HRS § 91-14(a) – in Docket 5 
 No. 2017-0122, any appeal by Hu Honua (including this one) 
merely creates unnecessary delay. 
Life of the Land’s January 26, 2022 motion to dismiss is 
granted. 
This case, SCOT-22-0000024, is dismissed for lack of 
appellate jurisdiction; all pending motions in SCOT-22-0000024 
are dismissed as moot.
