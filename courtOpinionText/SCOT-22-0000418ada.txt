OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J. 
 
 Over ten years ago, energy company Hu Honua had a 
brainwave: it could produce renewable energy by burning trees.  
The company sought regulatory approval to supply energy to 
Hawaiʻi Island using a biomass power plant.  Last summer, 
approval for that energy deal was denied.  Hu Honua appeals the Electronically Filed

 denial, arguing that the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) 
misunderstood its mandate and held Hu Honua to an unfair 
standard.  
 We disagree.  The PUC understood its public interest-minded 
mission.  It faithfully followed our remand instructions to 
consider the reasonableness of the proposed project’s costs in 
light of its greenhouse gas emissions and the project’s impact 
on intervenor Life of the Land’s members’ right to a clean and healthful environment.  It stayed true to the language of its 
governing statute HRS § 269-6(b) (Supp. 2021) by measuring the 
project’s cost and system impact.  And it acted properly within 
its role as fact-finder when it evaluated Hu Honua by its own 
statements and promises and, ultimately, found them 
unconvincing. 
 Finding no error, we affirm the PUC’s decision rejecting 
the power purchase agreement between Hu Honua and the Hawaiʻ i 
Electric Light Company, Inc. 
I. 
In 2012,  
 Electric Light Company, Inc. (HELCO) Hawaiʻi
approached its regulator, the Public Utilities Commission, about
entering into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with private 
company Hu Honua Bioenergy, LLC (Hu Honua).  Under the 
agreement, Hu Honua would convert an abandoned power plant in 
Pepeʻekeo, Hawaiʻ i.  The plant would produce energy by burning  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
3 
 woody biomass — mainly locally-grown eucalyptus trees.  HELCO 
would purchase this energy to service Hawaiʻ i Island’s power 
grid. 
In 2017, the PUC granted HELCO a waiver from the 
competitive bidding process and held a contested case hearing over the PPA.  Life of the Land (LOL), a Hawaiʻ i
-based community 
action group dedicated to protecting and preserving the 
ʻāina, 
sought to intervene in the hearing.  They were given limited, 
rather than full participant, status.  The PUC ultimately approved an Amended PPA between Hu Honua and HELCO for a thirty-
year term.  LOL appealed the decision. 
In Matter of Hawaiʻ i Elec. Light Co., Inc., 145 Hawaiʻ i
 1, 
445 P.3d 673 (2019) (HELCO I), this court vacated the PUC’s 
decision.  We told the commission to hold a new hearing.  Our 
remand instructed the PUC to give “LOL an opportunity to 
meaningfully address the impacts of approving the Amended PPA on 
LOL’s members’ right to a clean and healthful environment, as 
defined by HRS Chapter 269.”  Id. at 26, 445 P.3d at 698.  We 
also told the PUC to give “express consideration of GHG emissions that would result from approving the Amended PPA, whether the cost of energy under the Amended PPA is reasonable 
in light of the potential for GHG emissions, and whether the 
terms of the Amended PPA are prudent and in the public interest, *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
4 
 in light of its potential hidden and long-term consequences.”  
Id. 
On remand, the PUC devoted its attention to a threshold 
issue - whether it should “reissue” to HELCO a waiver from the 
competitive bidding process.  Matter of Hawaiʻ i Ele c. Light Co., 
Inc., 149 Hawaiʻ i 239, 240, 487 P.3d 708, 709 (2021) (HELCO II).  
It decided to deny the waiver.  Id.  Since HELCO now had no 
waiver, the PUC declined to consider the merits of the Amended 
PPA.  Id. 
This time, Hu Honua appealed.  Because the competitive 
waiver issue was outside the scope of HELCO I’s remand, we 
returned the case.  We repeated our remand order from HELCO I.  
Id. at 242, 487 P.3d at 711. 
The PUC held a new contested case hearing on the Amended 
PPA in early March 2022.  Before the evidentiary hearings began, Hu Honua brought several motions centered on Act 82, which had 
amended HRS § 269-6(b) in 2021.  HRS § 269-6(b) is the primary 
statute governing the PUC’s evaluation of energy projects like 
the Amended PPA.  It requires the PUC to engage in “public 
interest-minded balancing.”  Matter of Maui Elec. Co., Ltd., 150 
Hawaiʻi 528, 532, 506 P.3d 192, 196 (2022) (Paeahu).  
Hu Honua argued that Act 82 changed things.  It said the 
PUC could now only consider GHG emissions from fossil fuels.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
5
  Emissions from other sources, such as biomass burned to produce 
renewable energy, had to be kept out of the equation. 
The commission rejected this approach. It concluded that 
Act 82 did not materially alter its statutory obligations under 
HRS § 269-6(b). 
At the hearings, Hu Honua and HELCO maintained that the 
Amended PPA served the public interest.  Yet they admitted that 
by their own numbers, the proposed project would produce massive carbon emissions - 8,035,804 metric tons over its 30-year term.
  
The vast majority of these emissions would come from the plant’s routine operations.  Trucking trees to the plant would emit 
carbon.  And when the trees burned, “stack emissions” would rise 
into the atmosphere. 
But Hu Honua made a promise: the project would ultimately 
be carbon neutral.  Hu Honua intended to offset its emissions by 
planting trees.  These trees would sequester, by Hu Honua’s 
count, 8,066,309 metric tons of carbon.  That would zero out the project’s projected eight million metric ton carbon price tag.  
If everything went right, it would even make the project carbon 
negative. 
Hu Honua hoped to source all of its “feedstock,” that is, 
the organic matter it hoped to burn for fuel, from locally-grown
eucalyptus.  Its tree supplier, a sister company to Hu Honua, 
 , , and would initially source eucalyptus from Pā
ʻauhau Pāhala *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
6 
 Hāmākua plantations on Hawaiʻ i Island.  According to Hu Honua, 
those lands have enough trees to fuel the project for nine 
years.  Hu Honua suggested it could help the State by 
eradicating “invasive species” on 
Hawaiʻi Island and burning them
as an additional fuel source.  Hu Honua also claimed that 
sourcing feedstock outside of the island would only occur in an 
emergency.  
To meet its sequestration goals, Hu Honua would have to 
plant a lot
 of trees.  The company maintained that the bulk of 
this tree-planting — expected to sequester 5,882,322 metric tons 
of carbon — would occur on leased Hawaiʻ i Island la nd.  
In Hu 
Honua’s sequestration analysis, it included the three 
plantations it expected to source feedstock from.  The 
sequestration analysis assumed that no trees would be cut down 
at these plantations between 2017 and 2021.  But in testimony, 
Hu Honua indicated that harvesting had taken place at the Pāhala 
location during this period.  The company did not demonstrate 
that it was currently replanting trees on this plantation.  In fact, it stated that it does not plan to regrow the Pāhala and 
Hāmākua plantations at all. 
Hu Honua provided the PUC with a “carbon calculator” that 
indicated its estimated emissions and sequestration numbers.  
The calculator showed significant increases in sequestration 
between 2021 and 2029.  This implied an expansion in Hu Honua’s *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
7 
 current leasing regime.  All those extra trees would have to be 
planted somewhere.  
But Hu Honua did not present evidence that it had leases 
secured that extended through the PPA’s 30-year term.  Rather, 
Hu Honua indicated that it had non-binding “good faith” lease 
negotiations that would not be finalized until the PUC approved 
the Amended PPA. 
Hu Honua promised that if its sequestration performance 
fell short of its estimates, it would buy carbon offsets to make up for the deficit.  It pledged up to $450,000 for this effort, 
believing that it could buy carbon offsets at the price of $15 
per ton.  Hu Honua did not identify the sources of the offsets, 
only saying that “reputable sources” would sell them.  And Hu 
Honua did not explain how the PUC would verify the sequestration 
produced through these sales. 
To supplement Hu Honua’s carbon calculator, HELCO submitted 
its own analysis.  This analysis measured GHG emissions from Hu Honua’s project against a baseline without the project.  HELCO 
estimated that Hu Honua’s project would prevent 1,464,742 metric 
tons of emissions from entering the atmosphere.  HELCO’s 
consultant reached this number by combining an estimate of GHG 
emissions that would be avoided because of the project relative 
to the baseline, and the project’s estimated lifetime emissions.  
HELCO’s analysis took the carbon negative lifetime emissions *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
8 
 estimate from Hu Honua’s analysis and plugged it into its own.  
Though HELCO labeled its analysis independent, it in fact relied 
on Hu Honua’s. 
On May 23, 2022, the PUC issued Decision and Order No. 
38395.  It declined to approve the Amended PPA.  
In the order, the PUC found that the project would produce 
massive GHG emissions, and that Hu Honua’s promise of carbon 
neutrality rested on speculative, uncertain assumptions.  The commission expressed serious doubts that Hu Honua could actually 
live up to its sequestration estimates.  It pointed out that Hu 
Honua had no firm plans for leasing land to plant trees.  Using 
the carbon calculator provided by Hu Honua, the commission found 
that even changes as small as one-percent in Hu Honua’s 
emissions and sequestration estimates would make the project a 
net carbon emitter.  The commission calculated that the back-up 
money Hu Honua pledged, even if carbon offsets were available at 
the rate it expected, would only buy 30,000 metric tons of carbon offsets — less than one sixth of the carbon the project 
(per Hu Honua’s own estimates) would emit annually. 
The PUC was particularly troubled by the frontloading of 
GHG emissions in the project.  While Hu Honua pledged to be 
carbon neutral on an annual basis by the end of 2035, the 
commission determined (again based on Hu Honua’s numbers) that 
the overall impact of the project would not be carbon neutral *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
9 
 until 2047, two years after Hawaiʻ i’s 2045 zero emissions target 
came and went.  For the first 25 years of the project, Hu Honua 
would be a significant net emitter.  If Hu Honua did not meet its sequestration commitments, the PUC feared that the damage to
the atmosphere could not be easily undone.  
The PUC also found that the Amended PPA would significantly 
increase costs for rate-payers.  Six years into the project, the 
fuel price was set to spike 15%, for no discernable reason.  
That spike - in combination with other pricing terms and 
adjustments for inflation - meant that the cost would 
continually rise.  Overall, the PUC found that the project would 
increase the typical consumer bill by an average of $10.97 a month throughout the full 30-year term.  The PUC deemed this a 
significant bill impact.  HELCO stated that there were no 
realistic modeling assumptions under which the project “could 
produce a net savings to the system or customer.”  Based on the 
project’s high GHG emissions, the PUC did not consider these 
higher costs to consumers reasonable.
 
The PUC had another big time concern.  The commission found 
that not only would the project fail to accelerate the retirement of fossil-fuel, it would displace other, more 
environmentally friendly renewable resources.  Hu Honua said 
that its plant would only displace the fossil fuel-based Keāhole 
power plant.  However, HELCO, which actually controls energy *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
10 
 dispatch, testified that this claim was “unrealistic” and 
“contrary to [HELCO’s] practices” and “actual operational 
conditions.”  HELCO said that it would be “impossible” for the 
project to avoid displacing other renewable resources.  The 
Consumer Advocate, a statutorily-mandated party to the 
proceedings, estimated that almost 60% of Hu Honua’s generation 
would replace renewable energy generation.  Here, the commission 
credited the testimony of HELCO and the Consumer Advocate over Hu Honua’s.  The PUC also credited HELCO’s testimony that the Hu 
Honua project filled no pressing need in its power grid. 
Summing up, the PUC found that the proposed project would 
emit substantially more carbon than it sequestered for at least 
the first 25 years of operation and raise ratepayer prices for 
the full term.  And the PUC found Hu Honua’s promise of eventual 
carbon neutrality speculative at best.  Based on these findings, 
the PUC concluded that the Amended PPA was not in the public 
interest.  It rejected the agreement. 
Hu Honua moved the PUC to reconsider its Decision and 
Order.  The PUC denied the motion in Decision and Order No. 38443. 
Hu Honua appealed.  It argues that (1) the PUC’s order 
exceeded the scope of the HELCO I remand by considering energy 
prices, (2) the PUC improperly applied HRS § 269-6(b) by not limiting its comparison of the project to only fossil fuel *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
11 
 alternatives, and (3) violated Hu Honua’s due process rights by 
finding facts not in the record, applying a wrong evidentiary 
standard, and subjecting Hu Honua to a carbon neutrality 
requirement. 
II. 
A. 
We begin with the scope of remand.  Hu Honua characterizes 
the HELCO I remand as confining the PUC to the “one discrete 
issue” of GHG emissions.  Considerations of other key issues 
were “off-limits.” 
Where, exactly, Hu Honua locates this limitation remains a 
mystery.  In HELCO I, we vacated the PUC’s order and remanded 
for a new hearing.  The PUC had to give “LOL an opportunity to meaningfully address the impacts of approving the Amended PPA on 
LOL’s members’ right to a clean and healthful environment, as 
defined by HRS Chapter 269.”  HELCO I, 145 Hawaiʻ i at 26, 445 
P.3d at 698.  We said the hearing must include “express 
consideration of GHG emissions that would result from approving 
the Amended PPA, whether the cost of energy under the Amended PPA is reasonable in light of the potential for GHG emissions, 
and whether the terms of the Amended PPA are prudent and in the 
public interest, in light of its potential hidden and long-term 
consequences.”  Id.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
12 
 Then, in HELCO II, this court explicitly considered the 
scope of the HELCO I remand.  We reminded the parties that they 
were “fixed in the same position they were in following HELCO I” 
and repeated our remand instructions verbatim.  HELCO II, 149 
Hawaiʻi at 242, 487 P.3d at 711.  
Hu Honua seems to feel that the PUC’s consideration of 
pricing is unfair because back in its 2017 Decision & Order the 
PUC found the pricing reasonable.  But that 2017 Decision & 
Order was precisely what HELCO I vacated.  HELCO I, 145 Hawaiʻ i 
at 28, 445 P.3d at 700.  Based on the straightforward language 
of the remand order, the PUC was not only at liberty to consider 
pricing, it was required to consider the reasonability of the 
project’s pricing in light of its GHG emissions.  Hu Honua’s 
insistence that no specific language directs further consideration of energy costs is difficult to understand.  Our 
roadmap was a simple one, and we gave it twice.  
Even setting the remand language aside, the PUC has a duty 
to act in the public interest.  See Haw. Const. art. XI, § 1; 
HRS § 269-145.5(b) (2020) (“In advancing the public interest, the commission shall balance technical, economic, environmental, 
and cultural considerations . . .”); Paeahu, 150 Hawaiʻ i at 534, 
506 P.3d at 198 (principle that PUC must act in the public 
interest is “incorporated throughout HRS chapter 269”).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
13 
 Protecting rate-payers by considering pricing impacts follows 
from that public interest obligation.  
B. 
Hu Honua’s interpretation of HRS § 269-6(b) is equally 
strained.  “HRS Chapter 269 is a law relating to environmental quality that defines the right to a clean and healthful 
environment under article XI, section 9 by providing that 
express consideration be given to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the decision-making of the Commission.”  In re 
Application of Maui Elec. Co., Ltd., 141 Hawaiʻ i 249, 264, 408 
P.3d 1, 16 (2017) (MECO).   
HRS § 269-6(b) sets out specific factors the PUC must 
consider to determine whether the costs of a proposed energy 
project are reasonable.  These include (1) price volatility; (2) 
export of funds for fuel imports; (3) fuel supply reliability 
risk; and (4) greenhouse gas emissions.  The PUC then subjects 
these factors to “public interest-minded balancing.”  Paeahu, 
150 Hawaiʻ i at 532, 506 P.3d at 196. 
Hu Honua maintains that when applying these factors to a 
renewable energy project, the “only permissible” comparison for the PUC to draw is with fossil-fuel plants.  Considering a 
proposed renewable energy project’s relative impacts or the 
displacement of other renewable energy projects is, apparently, *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
14 
 out-of-bounds.  If Hu Honua is right, the only relevant question 
before the PUC was: is burning trees better than burning coal? 
Neither the language of HRS § 269-6(b) nor the legislative 
intent behind it supports this blinkered approach.  By drawing a 
hard line between fossil fuel and renewable energy, Hu Honua 
elides a crucial fact — producing biofuel, unlike producing 
other kinds of renewable energy such as solar or wind, emits 
high quantities of GHG emissions.  If the PUC couldn’t consider Hu Honua’s relative impacts and the likelihood that it would 
supplant other renewable projects, it would be forced to treat a 
project expected to emit millions of metric tons of carbon as no 
different from a project expected to emit almost no carbon, 
merely because both draw on renewable energy sources.  
But the legislature intended the PUC to consider 
“potentially harmful climate change due to the release of 
harmful greenhouse gases.”  MECO, 141 Hawaiʻ i at 26
 3, 408 P.3d at 
15.  We do not lightly assume that the legislature would 
sabotage its climate goals by limiting the PUC to artificial and 
unhelpful analyses.  
Further, HRS § 269-6 cannot be read in isolation from HRS 
§ 225P-5 (Supp. 2021), another law relating to environmental quality, which sets a state policy of achieving carbon 
neutrality “as quickly as practicable, but no later than 2045.”  
HRS § 225P-5 mandates that we reduce emissions now, before the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
15 
 damage done to the environment is irreversible — before action 
becomes impossible for future generations.  Hu Honua’s 
constrained reading of HRS § 269-6(b) does not reflect the 
legislature’s urgency. 
Still, Hu Honua insists that Act 82, which recently amended 
HRS § 269-6(b), alters this analysis.  It does not.  
Act 82’s primary purpose was to exempt minor actions from 
the HRS § 269-6(b) analysis and to give the PUC discretion to determine on a case-by-case basis whether proceedings involving 
water, wastewater, and telecommunications projects require the 
HRS § 269-6(b) analysis.  The amendment also made a number of 
small, non-substantive changes.  Most relevantly, it arranged 
the four factors, previously stated in a sentence, into a 
numbered list.  We don’t see how this typographical change in 
any way touches the substance of the statute. 
Hu Honua also invokes the act’s legislative history.  
During the law-making process, language explicitly including biomass was added and then removed from the amendment.  Hu Honua 
takes this as evincing a legislative intent to entirely exempt 
biomass emissions from consideration.  But, taken in context, 
the legislature’s actions indicate its desire to preserve the 
statute’s original language and interpretation.  The legislature 
was acting after MECO and HELCO I, cases that made clear HRS *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
16 
 § 269-6(b) applied to emissions from biomass plants.  Adding 
language to that effect would have been superfluous.  
Also, Act 82’s main purpose was to exempt certain projects 
from the PUC’s involved GHG analysis.  Had the legislature truly 
intended to exempt biomass emissions, it would have listed them 
with the other exemptions. 
HRS Chapter 269 defines the Hawaiʻ i Constitution’s article 
XI, section 9 right to a clean and healthful environment, which 
encompasses the right to a life-sustaining climate system. 
Paeahu, 150 Hawaiʻ i at 538 n.15, 5 06 P.3d at 202 n.15.  
Commanding a public agency charged with protecting the right to 
a life-sustaining climate system to disregard GHG emissions from 
a particular type of fuel source would undermine HRS Chapter 
269.  We don’t think the legislature intended to go there, much less through a minor amendment bill. 
C. 
Lastly, Hu Honua asserts that the PUC violated its due 
process rights by finding its own facts, applying a higher evidentiary standard, and creating a carbon neutrality 
requirement. 
First, the PUC’s findings do not indicate that it tried to 
become its own “expert.”  Compiling data provided by Hu Honua’s 
expert into a table does not produce new facts, nor does weighing competing evidence and finding, for example, that *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
17 
 HELCO’s projections were more credible than Hu Honua’s.  Under 
HRS § 269-92 (2020), electric companies must reach full carbon 
neutrality by 2045.  By calculating that Hu Honua’s project 
would reach cumulative carbon neutrality in 2047, as opposed to 
annual carbon neutrality in 2035, the PUC hewed to its statutory 
mandate.  
Nor does the PUC’s critical evaluation of the evidence Hu 
Honua presented equate to applying a higher evidentiary standard.  Rather, it demonstrates a more mundane phenomenon: a 
fact-finder finding one side’s facts unpersuasive.  
Hu Honua stresses that it and HELCO were the only ones to 
introduce expert evidence at the proceeding.  If only one side 
employs an expert, the argument seems to run, that expert must 
be believed.  But Hu Honua misunderstands its evidentiary 
burden.  Hu Honua had to persuade the PUC, not the other way 
around.  
Further, treating one side’s ability to retain an expert as 
decisive in proceedings would unacceptably interfere with the due process rights of parties who, while not able to field 
competing expert witnesses, may have valid attacks to make on 
the credibility or persuasive force of expert evidence. 
 Third, Hu Honua argues that the PUC applied a novel and 
inappropriate standard: whether the project would achieve carbon 
neutrality.  But it was Hu Honua, not the PUC, who introduced *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
18 
 the idea of carbon neutrality into the proceedings.  In fact, Hu 
Honua went further – it pledged to be carbon negative.  Carbon 
neutrality was key to Hu Honua’s pitch, going directly to the 
reasonability of its costs in light of its GHG emissions.  
As HRS § 269-9 (2020) recognizes, higher energy costs may 
be justified when the energy source avoids the harmful impacts 
of fossil fuels.  But biomass and fossil fuel sources share one 
important defect — high GHG emissions.  Hu Honua appears to have recognized that its project would not be found reasonable by the 
PUC if it offered both high costs and high emissions.  So it 
argued that its emissions, once offset by tree planting, would 
amount to zero.  How convincing the PUC found this carbon claim 
is an issue of fact, not the creation of a new legal rule. 
 Even if the PUC adopted carbon neutrality as a standard, it 
is not so clear that the agency would have erred.  
We have said that an agency “must perform its statutory 
function in a manner that fulfills the State’s affirmative 
constitutional obligations,” Paeahu, 150 Hawaiʻ i at
  538, 506 P.3d 
at 202, and that “[a]rticle XI, section 9’s ‘clean and healthful 
environment’ right as defined by HRS chapter 269 subsumes a 
right to a life-sustaining climate system,” id. at 538 n.15, 506 
P.3d at 202 n.15.  The right to a life-sustaining climate system is not just affirmative; it is constantly evolving.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
19 
 The people of Hawaiʻ i have declared “a climate emergency.”  
S.C.R. 44, S.D. 1, H.D. 1, 31st Leg., Reg. Sess. (2021).  Hawaiʻ i 
faces immediate threats to our cultural and economic survival: 
sea level rise, eroding the coast and flooding the land; ocean 
warming and acidification, bleaching coral reefs and devastating 
marine life; more frequent and more extreme droughts and storms.  
Id.  For the human race as a whole, the threat is no less 
existential.  
With each year, the impacts of climate change amplify and 
the chances to mitigate dwindle.  “The Closing Window: Climate 
crisis calls for rapid transformation of societies,” Emissions 
Gap Report 2022, https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-
report-2022 [https://perma.cc/6JAR-RFZE].  “A stepwise approach 
is no longer an option.”  Id. at page xv. 
The reality is that yesterday’s good enough has become 
today’s unacceptable.  The PUC was under no obligation to evaluate an energy project conceived of in 2012 the same way in 
2022.  Indeed, doing so would have betrayed its constitutional 
duty.  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

  Because the PUC’s actions aligned with its statutory and 
constitutional obligations, we affirm PUC Order Nos. 38395 and
