BOARD OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES, State of Hawaiʻ i,

APPEAL FROM THE BOARD OF LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES 
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.)  
 
Upon review of Appellant’s appeal from Appellee Board 
of Land and Natural Resources’ (BLNR’s) approval of the “Mauna 
Kea Comprehensive Management Plan 2022 Supplement” (2022 Supplement) under “Item K-2 of its agenda” at the July 22, 2022 “hearing,” and (2) the “implicit denial” of Appellant’s request for a contested case hearing, and the record, it appears this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over the appeal.  
Based on this record, what occurred before the BLNR on 
July 22, 2022, in relation to the 2022 Supplement, did not result from a contested case or the denial of a contested case request because the discussion on July 22, 2022, did not prevent 
Appellant from filing a petition for a contested case hearing. 
Appellant filed a petition and that petition remains pending in Electronically Filed
Supreme Court

 the BLNR.  What occurred on July 22, 2022, was thus not a 
proceeding that determined Appellant’s legal rights, duties, or 
privileges.  See Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91-1 (Supp. 
2021) (defining a “contested case” as “a proceeding in which the 
legal rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties are required by law to be determined after an opportunity for agency 
hearing”).  Because what occurred on July 22, 2022, in relation 
to the 2022 Supplement was not a contested case, or a denial of a request for a contested case, this court does not have jurisdiction over this direct appeal under HRS §§ 183C-9 (Supp. 2021) and 91-14(a) (2012 & Supp. 2021).

  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, February 15, 2023.

1 HRS § 91- 7 (2012 & Supp. 2021) does not authorize a direct appeal 
to this court, or for a declaratory judgment action to originate in this 
court.  See Lingle v. Hawaii Gov’t Employees Ass’n, AFSCME, Local 152, AFL-
CIO, 107 Hawaiʻ i 178, 184, 111 P.3d 587, 593 (2005) (“The right to appeal is 
purely statutory and exists only when jurisdiction is given by some 
constitutional or statutory provision.”).
