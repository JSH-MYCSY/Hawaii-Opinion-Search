Donahue submitted to the appellate clerk’s office documents for  
filing, along with a motion for permission to proceed in forma pauperis.  We construe the submission as a petition for a writ 
of mandamus for a declaratory judgment, confirming the identity 
of the individual, directed at an unnamed public official.  Upon review of the document, we conclude that it fails to demonstrate 
a clear and indisputable right to relief from this court.   See  
State ex rel. Kaneshiro v. Huddy, 82 
Hawaiʼi 188, 193, 921 P.2d 
108, 113 (1996).   We further conclude that the information ________________________________________________________________

 provided in the motion to proceed in forma pauperis, submitted

Therefore,

matter. 
It is further ordered that the petition for a writ of 
mandamus is denied.
