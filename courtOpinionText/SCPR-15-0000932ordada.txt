IN RE CURTIS EVANS ALDENDIFER, Petitioner.
  
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
  
ORDER GRANTING PETITION TO RESIGN AND SURRENDER LICENSE
 
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Curtis E. Aldendifer’s
 
petition to resign and surrender his license to practice law in
 
the State of Hawai' i, filed pursuant to Rule 1.10 of the Rules of 
the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i (RSCH), and of the 
affidavits and exhibits in support thereof, we note the affidavit
 from the Hawai' i State Bar Association mis-states Petitioner’s 
current voluntary inactive status as active, but we nevertheless
 determine the error does not justify requiring Petitioner to
 resubmit the petition. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition is granted. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, pursuant to RSCH Rule 1.10(g), 
that Petitioner shall comply with the notice, affidavit, and
 record requirements of RSCH Rule 2.16(a), (b), (d), and (g).
 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that the Clerk shall remove the
   name of Petitioner Curtis E. Aldendifer, attorney number 5630, 
from the roll of attorneys of the State of Hawai' i, effective 
with the filing of this order. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, December 28, 2015.
