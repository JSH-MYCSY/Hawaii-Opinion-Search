'I 
DISCIPLINARY BOARD OF THE HAWAI' I SUPREME COURT,
Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
JEFFREY M. TAYLOR,
Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC Case Nos. 13-024-9094 and 14-011-9154)
 
ORDER ALLOWING RESIGNATION IN LIEU OF DISCIPLINE
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the petition submitted by the
 
Disciplinary Board of the Hawai' i Supreme Court for an order 
granting the request of attorney Jeffrey M. Taylor to resign from
 
the practice of law in lieu of discipline, and the affidavits and
 
exhibits attached in support thereof, we note the petition is
 
supported by Respondent Taylor’s affidavit, which meets the
 
requirements of Rule 2.14(a) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of
 
the State of Hawai' i (RSCH), and in which Respondent Taylor avers 
and admits to misconduct that represents multiple violations of
 Rules 1.1, 1.2(a), 1.3, 1.4(a), 1.4(b), 1.6(a), 1.8(e),
 
1.15(f)(3), 1.15(g), 1.16(d), 3.2, 3.4(e), 4.2 and 8.4(c) of the
 
Hawai'i Rules of Professional Conduct (1994), and which constitutes misconduct sufficient to justify granting the
 
petition. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition to resign in
 
lieu of discipline is granted.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Taylor’s
 
resignation shall become effective 30 days after the date of this
 
order, as provided by RSCH Rules 2.14(d) and 2.16(c).
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of this court
 
shall remove Jeffrey M. Taylor’s name from the role of attorneys
 
licensed to practice law in this jurisdiction and, within thirty
 
days after entry of this order, Respondent Taylor shall submit to
 
the Clerk the original certificate evidencing his license to
 
practice law in this jurisdiction or an affidavit establishing
 
good cause for his failure to do so. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Taylor shall 
comply with the requirements of RSCH Rule 2.16 governing 
disbarred attorneys and the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme 
Court of the State of Hawai' i shall provide notice of the 
disbarment as required by RSCH Rules 2.16(e) and 2.16(f). 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that Respondent Taylor shall 
bear the costs of these proceedings upon the timely submission by
 ODC of a verified bill of costs, as authorized by RSCH Rule
 
2.3(c).
