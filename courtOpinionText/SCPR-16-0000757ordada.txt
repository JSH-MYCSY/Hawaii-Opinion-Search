ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ODC Case No. 15-027-9246)
 
ORDER ALLOWING RESIGNATION IN LIEU OF DISCIPLINE
 
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the petition submitted by the
 
Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i 
for an order granting the request of attorney Melodie R. Williams
 
Aduja to resign from the practice of law in lieu of discipline
 
and the affidavit attached in support thereof, we note the
 
petition meets the requirements of Rule 2.14(a) of the Rules of
 
the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i (RSCH) and that 
Respondent Aduja avers and admits misconduct sufficient to
 justify granting the petition. Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition to resign in
 
lieu of discipline is granted.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Aduja’s
 
resignation shall become effective 30 days after the date of this
 
order, as provided by RSCH Rules 2.14(d) and 2.16(c).
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of this court
 
shall remove Respondent Aduja’s name from the role of attorneys
 
licensed to practice law in this jurisdiction and, within thirty
 
days after entry of this order, Respondent Aduja shall submit to
 
the Clerk the original certificate evidencing her license to
 
practice law in this jurisdiction or an affidavit establishing
 
good cause for her failure to do so. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Aduja shall
 
comply with the requirements of RSCH Rule 2.16 governing
 
disbarred attorneys and the Disciplinary Board shall provide
 
notice of the disbarment as required by RSCH Rules 2.16(e) and
 
2.16(f).
 
IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that Respondent Aduja shall bear
 
the costs of these proceedings upon the timely submission by ODC
 
of a verified bill of costs, as authorized by RSCH Rule 2.3(c).
