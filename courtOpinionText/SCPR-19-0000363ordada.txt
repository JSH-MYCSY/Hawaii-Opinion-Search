IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL,
Petitioner, 
vs. 
MICHAEL O. YAMAMOTO,
Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(ODC 19-0062) 
ORDER ALLOWING RESIGNATION IN LIEU OF DISCIPLINE 
(By:  Recktenwald,  C.J.,  Nakayama,  McKenna,  Pollack,  and  Wilson,  JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the petition submitted by the 
Office of Disciplinary Counsel, with the approval of the 
Disciplinary Board of the Hawai# i Supreme Court, for an order 
granting the request of attorney Michael O. Yamamoto to resign from the practice of law in lieu of discipline, and the affidavit attached in support thereof, we find Respondent Yamamoto’s affidavit meets the requirements of Rule 2.14(a) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai# i (RSCH), and find 
Respondent Yamamoto avers and admits to misconduct that we conclude represents serious violations of Rules 1.15(a) and 8.4(c) (2014). We conclude this misconduct justifies granting 
the petition. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition to resign in 
lieu of discipline is granted. The resignation shall become effective 30 days after the date of this order, pursuant to RSCH Rules 2.14(d) and 2.16(c). 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of this court 
shall remove Michael O. Yamamoto’s name from the role of attorneys licensed to practice law in this jurisdiction and, within thirty days after entry of this order, Respondent Yamamoto shall submit to the Clerk the original certificate evidencing his license to practice law in this jurisdiction or an affidavit establishing good cause for his failure to do so. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Yamamoto shall 
comply with the requirements of RSCH Rule 2.16 governing disbarred attorneys, the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai# i shall provide notice of the disbarment as 
required by RSCH Rule 2.16(e), and the Clerk shall provide notice to all state judges, pursuant to RSCH Rule 2.16(f). 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent Yamamoto shall 
pay the costs of ODC’s investigation and any preliminary disciplinary proceedings upon the timely submission by ODC of a verified bill of costs, as authorized by RSCH Rule 2.3(c). 
2 IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that this court reserves 
jurisdiction to determine, based upon subsequent submission of 
documentary evidence from the parties, the final amount due in restitution, which shall be paid in full as a precondition for any future petition for reinstatement from Respondent Yamamoto. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, May 6, 2019.
