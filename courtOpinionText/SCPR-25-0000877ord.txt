IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI ʻI  
IN RE ELEANORDAWN R. HUGHES, Petitioner.  
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING  
ORDER GRANTING PETITION TO RESIGN IN GOOD STANDING  
(By: McKenna, Acting C.J., Eddins, Ginoza, and Devens, JJ., and 
Intermediate Court of Appeals Chief Judge Nakasone, 
assigned by reason of vacancy) 
Upon consideration of the petition to resign from the 
practice of law in the State of Hawaiʻi, filed by attorney 
Eleanordawn R. Hughes (Petitioner), pursuant to Rule 1.10 of the 
Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawaiʻi (RSCH), which 
the court construes as also seeking to retain the paper license 
as a memento, as authorized by RSCH Rule 1.10(b), and the 
declarations submitted in support thereof, we conclude that 
Petitioner has complied with the requirements of RSCH Rule 1.10.1 
1 Although Hawaiʻi State Bar Association (HSBA) executive director 
Catherine Ann Betts’ declaration, attached in support of the petition, 
misidentifies Petitioner’s bar number, Ms. Betts’ representation of 
Petitioner’s license status as “ INACTIVE VOLUNTARY ” comports with 
Petitioner’s status information on HSBA’s website. It thus appears that the   
 
  
  
  
 
   
       
       
       
       
       
 
 
 Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition to 
resign is granted. Petitioner may retain the paper license as a 
memento. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED pursuant to RSCH Rule 1.10(g) 
that Petitioner shall comply with the notice, declaration, and 
record requirements of RSCH Rule 2.16(a), (b), (d) and (g). 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk shall remove the 
name of Petitioner, attorney number 9842, from the roll of 
attorneys of the State of Hawai ʻi, effective with the filing of 
this order. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, December 19, 2025.

substantive information as to Petitioner’s status is correct, and Ms. Betts’ 
declaration is sufficient. See  RSCH Rule 1.10(c)(ii) (requiring declaration 
of the HSBA executive director attesting to the petitioner’s current status).
