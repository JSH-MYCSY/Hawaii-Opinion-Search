IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
PATRICK W. O'BRIEN, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 THE HONORABLE R. MARK BROWNING, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT
OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT; ISLAND MOVERS, INC.; DUSTIN ZAMORA;
HENDERSON GALLAGHER & KANE; JOHN R. WIENOLD; DEPARTMENT OF
VETERAN'S AFFAIRS; and TRIPLER ARMY MEDICAL CENTER,
Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-1740-08)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and Duffy, JJ.
and Circuit Judge Alm, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Patrick W. O'Brien's 
"Complaint of Crimes, Misconduct, Discrimination, and Toleration 
of Wrongdoings," which is deemed a petition for a writ of prohibition, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and disputable right to relief. Therefore, petitioner is not entitled to extraordinary relief. See HRS ยง 602-5(3) (Supp. 
2009) ("The supreme court shall have jurisdiction and power . . . to exercise original jurisdiction in all questions arising under writs directed to courts of inferior jurisdiction and returnable before the supreme court."); Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 
982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of prohibition is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner  demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack
 
of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
 obtain the requested action.). Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of prohibition
 without payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
prohibition is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, November 9, 2010.
