STATE OF HAWAI
'I, Petitioner, 
vs.
 THE HONORABLE KAREN S.S. AHN, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI' I and
 
ROYNES JOSEPH DURAL, II, Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(S.P.P. No. 09-1-0015 (CR. NO. 02-1-2791))
 
ORDER
 
(By: Nakayama, Acting C.J., Acoba, and Duffy, JJ., and Circuit
Judge Crandall, in place of Recktenwald, C.J., recused, and
Circuit Judge Lee, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner State of Hawaii's 
petition for a writ of mandamus, it appears that petitioner fails 
to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief. Therefore, petitioner is not entitled to extraordinary relief. See HRS ยง 602-5(3) (Supp. 2009) ("The supreme court shall have jurisdiction and power . . . to exercise original jurisdiction in all questions arising under writs directed to courts of inferior jurisdiction and returnable before the supreme court."); Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of 
mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to  relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the
 
alleged wrong or obtain the requested action. Such writs are not
 intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the
 lower courts, nor are they intended to serve as legal remedies in
 lieu of normal appellate procedures.). Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, November 17, 2010.
