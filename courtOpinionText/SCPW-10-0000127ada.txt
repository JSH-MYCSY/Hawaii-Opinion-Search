IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
RAYMOND GONSALVES, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 CLAYTON FRANK, DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF
PUBLIC SAFETY, STATE OF HAWAI
'I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and Duffy, JJ., and
Circuit Judge Trader, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Raymond Gonsalves' 
petition for a writ of mandamus and the papers in support, it 
appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief. Therefore, petitioner is not entitled to extraordinary relief. See HRS § 602-5(3) (2009) 
("The supreme court shall have jurisdiction and power . . . [t]o exercise original jurisdiction in all questions . . . arising under writs of mandamus directed to public officers to compel them to fulfill the duties of their offices[.]”); Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus 
is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief  
 and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged
 
wrong or obtain the requested action.). Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied. The request to submit additional exhibits is
 also denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, November 17, 2010.
