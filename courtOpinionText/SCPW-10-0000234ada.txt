DANIEL JAMES OUREN, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
EARLE PARTINGTON, HALAWA CORRECTIONAL FACILITY, and
 HAWAII PAROLING AUTHORITY, Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba and Duffy, JJ.
and Circuit Judge Del Rosario, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon review of the December 21, 2010 papers filed in
 
the supreme court by Daniel James Ouren, which are deemed a
 
complaint against Earle Partington, prison administrators, and
 the paroling authority, it appears we lack jurisdiction to
 consider the complaint. See HRS ยง 602-5 (Supp. 2009). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the complaint is dismissed.
 DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 12, 2011.
