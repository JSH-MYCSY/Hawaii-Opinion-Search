MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
GOVERNOR NEIL ABERCROMBIE, Respondent.
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and Duffy, JJ.
and Circuit Judge Ayabe, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael C. Tierney’s 
petition for a writ of mandamus, it appears that petitioner fails 
to demonstrate that he is entitled to mandamus relief. See
 HRS § 
602-5(3) (Supp. 2009) (The supreme court has jurisdiction and power to issue writs of mandamus directed to public officers to compel them to fulfill the duties of their offices.); In Re Disciplinary Bd. Of Hawaii Supreme Court, 91 Hawai' i 363, 368, 
984 P.2d 688, 693 (1999) (Mandamus relief is available to compel an official to perform a duty allegedly owed to an individual only if the individual’s claim is clear and certain, the official’s duty is ministerial and so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt, and no other remedy is available.). Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
 
payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: 
Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 12, 2011.
