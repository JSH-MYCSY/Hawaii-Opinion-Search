MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
LINDA MOGA RIVERA, Inmate Grievance Specialist,
Halawa Correctional Facility, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and Duffy, JJ., and
Circuit Judge Kim, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael C. Tierney's 
petition for a writ of mandamus and the papers in support, it 
appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief. 
Therefore, petitioner is not 
entitled to extraordinary relief. See HRS § 602-5(3) (2009) 
("The supreme court shall have jurisdiction and power . . . [t]o exercise original jurisdiction in all questions . . . arising under writs of mandamus directed to public officers to compel them to fulfill the duties of their offices[.]”); Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus 
is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief  and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged 
wrong or obtain the requested action.); In re. Disciplinary Bd. Of the Hawaii Supreme Court, 91 Hawai' i 363, 368, 984 P.2d 688, 
693 (1999) (Mandamus relief is available to compel an official to perform a duty allegedly owed to an individual only if the individual’s claim is clear and certain, the official’s duty is ministerial and so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt, and no other remedy is available.). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: 
Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 10, 2011.
