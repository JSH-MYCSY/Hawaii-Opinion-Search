MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE RICHARD K. PERKINS, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent. 
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NOS. 88-2209 and 89-0024)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and Duffy, JJ.
and Circuit Judge Crandall, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael C. Tierney's
 
petition for a writ of mandamus, it appears that petitioner's
 
notice of appeal, dated January 3, 2011, was not "denied" by the
 respondent judge, but was filed by the circuit court on January
 10, 2011 and is being processed in the intermediate court of
 appeals as appeal No. CAAP-11-0000016. 
It further appears that a
 
motion for waiver of appellate fees for No. CAAP-11-0000016 must
 be made in the appellate court, not the circuit court. See HRAP
 
24(a) ("A party to an action in the circuit . . . court who
 desires to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis shall file in the
 appellate court a motion for leave to so proceed[.]"). 
Therefore, petitioner is not entitled to mandamus relief. See
  Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue 
unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action.). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied without prejudice to petitioner filing, in the
 intermediate court of appeals, in No. CAAP-11-0000016, a motion
 to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis pursuant to HRAP 24(a).
