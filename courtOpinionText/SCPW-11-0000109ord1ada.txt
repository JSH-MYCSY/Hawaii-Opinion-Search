IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I
 
MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
WALTER RODBY, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(Nos. 29993 and SCWC-29993)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael C. Tierney’s
 
petition for a writ of mandamus and the papers in support, it
 
appears that mandamus does not lie against petitioner’s court-
appointed counsel. See HRS § 602-5(3) (2010) (“The supreme court
 shall have jurisdiction and power . . . [t]o exercise original
 jurisdiction in all questions arising under writs directed to
 courts of inferior jurisdiction and returnable before the supreme
 court, or if the supreme court consents to receive the case
 arising under writs of mandamus directed to public officers to
 compel them to fulfill the duties of their offices[.]” 
Therefore,
  
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, March 10, 2011.
