IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I
 
ARWIN R. ECHINEQUE, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
HAWAI'I PAROLING AUTHORITY, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Arwin R. Echineque’s
 
“Complaint” to the intermediate court of appeals, which is
 
treated as a petition for a writ of mandamus to the supreme
 court, it appears that petitioner was sentenced in Cr. No. 06-1­1633 to five years imprisonment for assault and one year
 imprisonment for terroristic threatening, to be served
 consecutively. 
The Hawaii Paroling Authority’s (HPA) original
 
minimum term expiration date of August 4, 2011 apparently did not
 account for petitioner’s one-year consecutive sentence for
 terroristic threatening and the HPA apparently corrected the
 expiration date to August 2, 2012. Therefore, petitioner fails
 to demonstrate a clear and disputable right to relief. See HRS §
 
602-5(3) (Supp. 2010) (The supreme court has jurisdiction and
  power to issue writs of mandamus directed to public officers to 
compel them to fulfill the duties of their offices.); In Re Disciplinary Bd. Of Hawaii Supreme Court, 91 Hawai' i 363, 368, 
984 P.2d 688, 693 (1999) (Mandamus relief is available to compel an official to perform a duty allegedly owed to an individual only if the individual’s claim is clear and certain, the official’s duty is ministerial and so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt, and no other remedy is available.). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, March 9, 2011.
