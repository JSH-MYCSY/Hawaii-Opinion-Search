ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of respondents 2011 Reapportionment 
Commission and Chief Election Officer's motion for 
reconsideration and/or clarification of the January 4, 2012 order 
and the January 6, 2012 opinion granting the petition for a writ 
of mandamus, the papers in support and the record, it appears 
that the lack of complete information about the non-permanent 
status and location of Hawaii's non-residents is no basis for 
disregarding the express mandate of the Hawai' i Constitution, article IV, section 4, that only permanent residents be counted
 
in the population base for the purpose of reapportionment of the
 
state legislature.
 
It further appears that the January 6, 2012 opinion
 
discussed and disposed of the sole issue presented in
 
petitioners' petition as to whether the inclusion of non­
permanent residents in the population base for the 2011 Final
 
Reapportionment Plan constituted an error in the Reapportionment
 
Plan. How the Commission identifies the non-permanent resident
 
population for apportionment under article IV, section 4 and
 
whether the Commission must follow the procedures set forth in
 
HRS § 25-2 in preparing and filing a new reapportionment plan
 
were not issues in petitioners' mandamus proceeding.
 
It finally appears that the January 6, 2012 opinion 
advises the Commission that apportionment under article IV,
 
section 6 requires the Commission to "make an honest and good
 
faith effort to construct districts as nearly of equal population
 
as is practicable. . . . [M]athematical exactness or precision
 
[is not a] constitutional requirement." Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for
 
reconsideration and/or clarification is denied.
