Per Curiam. In these related original proceedings, the 
petitioners petitioned this court pursuant to the Hawai
'i 
Constitution, article IV, section 10, quoted infra, for: (1) a 
judgment invalidating the 2011 Final Reapportionment Plan for the state legislature adopted and filed on September 26, 2011 by the State of Hawai' i 2011 Reapportionment Commission; (2) a writ of 
mandamus directing the Reapportionment Commission to prepare and file a new reapportionment plan for the state legislature; and (3) a writ of mandamus directing the Chief Election Officer to
 rescind the publication of the 2011 Final Reapportionment Plan.
 
On January 4, 2012, we issued orders granting the 
petitions. We concluded that the 2011 Final Reapportionment Plan is constitutionally invalid because: (1) the Hawai' i 
Constitution, article IV, section 4, expressly mandates that only permanent residents be counted in the population base for the purpose of reapportionment and (2) the 2011 Final Reapportionment Plan disregards this constitutional mandate by including non­permanent residents in the population base that the Reapportionment Commission used to allocate the members of the state legislature among the basic island units. We invalidated the 2011 Final Reapportionment Plan and directed the Reapportionment Commission to prepare and file a new reapportionment plan that: (1) allocates the members of the state legislature among the basic island units by using a permanent resident population base, and then (2) apportions the members

                           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
among the districts therein as provided by article IV, section 6. 
We further directed the Chief Election Officer to rescind the
 publication of the 2011 Final Reapportionment Plan for the state
 legislature.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
A.
 
The Hawai' i Constitution, article IV (Reapportionment), 
requires, every tenth year after 1981, reapportionment for the state legislature and congressional districts. Reapportionment is effected by a reapportionment plan filed by a nine-member reapportionment commission constituted in the reapportionment year. 
Article IV, as originally enacted in 1978, provided for
 
reapportionment of the state legislature by requiring allocation
 -- among the four basic island units of the 25 senatorial
 districts and the 51 house of representative districts -- "on the
 basis of the number of voters registered in the last preceding
 general election." Though the registered voter basis was upheld
 as constitutional by the United States Supreme Court because it
 
1
approximated a plan based on a permissible population base,  the
1991 Reapportionment Commission concluded, after analyzing its
 data, that use of the voter registration basis would not result
 in a constitutionally permissible apportionment plan. 
It
1  Burns v. Richardson, 384 U.S. 73, 96 (1966)
 
3
 selected, as an alternative apportionment base, the permanent 
resident population, identified as the total population derived from the 1990 census, less transients. It hired a research firm to "determine which transients were counted in the census, how many there were and whether or not they could be located in specific census blocks." The research firm, upon consultation, reported to the 1991 Reapportionment Commission that "the nonresident military is the only large, census-block-identifiable group of nonresidents included in the census" and that "other groups, such as nonresident students, are statistically insignificant and cannot be easily placed in specific census blocks." The 1991 Reapportionment Commission thereupon decided to exclude, from the permanent resident population base, nonresident military personnel and their dependents as constituting "the vast majority of transients included in the census counts." It stated, in its final reapportionment plan, that "exclusion of nonresident military from the census data will come as close as possible to the desired permanent resident base for legislative reapportionment" because: (1) nonresident military then constituted about 114,000 or 14% of Hawaii's population; (2) most military personnel considered Hawai' i a 
temporary home and only 3% opted to become Hawai' i citizens; and 
(3) 98% of military dependents claimed the same residency as the
 military member of the family. 
4
 The 1991 Reapportionment Commission's final
 
reapportionment plan was the basis, in the 1992 legislative
 
session, for House Bill 2327 to amend article IV of the Hawai' i 
Constitution to change the state legislature apportionment base
 from registered voters to permanent resident population "based on
 the 1991 Reapportionment Commission's Final Reapportionment Plan"
 and "the reasons set forth in [the] Plan." House Bill 2327 was
 enacted by the 1992 legislature and article IV of the Hawai' i 
Constitution was amended by Hawai' i voters in 1992 to its present 
form.
 
ARTICLE IV
 
REAPPORTIONMENT
 
. . . .
 
APPORTIONMENT AMONG BASIC ISLAND UNITS
 
Section 4.   The [re
apportionment]
commissio
n shall allocate the total number of
 
members of each house of the state legislature
being reapportioned among the four basic island
units, namely: (1) the island of Hawaii, (2) the
islands of Maui, Lanai, Molokai and Kahoolawe,
(3) the island of Oahu and all other islands not
specifically enumerated, and (4) the islands of
Kauai and Niihau, using the total number of
permanent residents in each of the basic island
units and computed by the method known as the
method of equal proportions; except that no basic
island unit shall receive less than one member in
 each house.
 . . . .
 
APPORTIONMENT WITHIN BASIC ISLAND UNITS
 
Section 6.   Upon th
e determination of the
total num
ber of members of each house of the
 
state legislature to which each basic island unit
is entitled, the commission shall apportion the
members among the districts therein and shall
redraw district lines where necessary in such
manner that for each house the average number of
permanent residents per member in each district
is as nearly equal to the average for the basic
island unit as practicable.

                           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The apportionment provisions of article IV, sections 4 and 6 are
 
incorporated in the reapportionment statute, HRS Chapter 25,
 which provides that the reapportionment commission "shall
 reapportion the members of each house of the legislature on the
 basis, method, and criteria prescribed by the Constitution of the
 United States and article IV of the Hawaii Constitution." HRS §
 25-2(a) (2009).
 
The reapportionment commission, within 150 days from
 
the date that its members are certified, "shall file with the
 chief election officer a reapportionment plan for the state
 legislature . . . which shall become law after publication as
 provided by law." Article IV, section 2; HRS § 25-2(a). "Within
 fourteen days after the filing of the final reapportionment plan,
 the chief election officer shall cause public notice to be given
 of the final legislative reapportionment plan which, upon public
 notice, shall become effective as of the date of filing and
 govern the election of members of the next five succeeding
 legislatures." HRS § 25-2(a). "In the event of a successful
 court challenge of a reapportionment plan, the reapportionment
 commission shall continue in operation and may assist the court
 in formulating a new reapportionment plan." HRS § 25-9 (2009).

2011 being a reapportionment year, the State of Hawai' i 
2011 Reapportionment Commission ("the Commission") was certified

on April 29, 2011  and tasked with adopting and filing a final
reapportionment plan by September 26, 2011.
 
The Commission, at its initial organizational 
meetings, adopted "Standards and Criteria" that it would follow
 for the 2011 reapportionment of the congressional and state
 legislative districts. The "Standards and Criteria" for the
 state legislative districts stated:
 
Standards and criteria that shall be followed : 
The population base used shall be the "permanent
resident" population of the State of Hawaii. The permanent resident population is the totalpopulation of the State of Hawaii as shown in thelast U.S. census less the following: non-residentstudents and non-resident military sponsors.
 At meetings on May 11 and 24, 2011, the Commission was 
briefed on Hawaii's population growth since the 2001 
reapportionment, the history of Hawaii's reapportionment, and the constitutional and statutory provisions governing reapportionment. It was provided with data from the 2010 Census showing a 12% increase in the state's total population consisting of increases of 24% in Hawai' i County, 21% in Maui County, 15% in 
Kauai County, and 9% in Oahu County. It was informed of article IV, section 4 and 6's permanent resident basis for apportioning the state legislature and informed -- by counsel to the 2001

Chipchase IV, Clarice Hashimoto, Harold Masumoto, Elizabeth Moore,
Dylan Nonaka, Lorrie Lee Stone, Anthony Takitani and Terry Thomason. 
Marks was appointed by this court as the ninth member and Chairperson
on April 29, 2011, pursuant to article IV, section 2, after the eight
Commission members were unable to select the ninth member.

Reapportionment Commission -- that the 2001 Commission computed
 
the permanent residence base by excluding nonresident military
 personnel and their dependents, and nonresident college students. 
It was informed by Commission staff that data on Hawaii's
 nonresident military population had been requested from the
 Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) through the U.S. Pacific
 Command (USPACOM) and that Hawaii's nonresident student
 population would be identified by their local addresses and
 assigned to specific census blocks. The Commission, at the
 conclusion of the May meetings, solicited advice from the
 
3
apportionment advisory councils  as to whether nonresident
military and nonresident students should be excluded from the
 permanent resident base. 
The Maui and Kauai advisory councils recommended, at
 
the Commission's June 9, 2011 meeting, to exclude nonresident
 military and nonresident students.
4 Commissioner Takitani
 
thereupon asked Commission staff whether the current
 apportionment of the state legislature would change if
 apportionment were computed on the total resident population,
3  HRS § 25-7 (2009) (apportionment advisory councils) ( "The
 
apportionment advisory councils for the respective basic island units
shall be constituted at the same time as the reapportionment
commission[.]  Each advisory council shall serve in an advisory
capacity to the reapportionment commission as to matters affecting its
basic island unit.").
4  The Hawaii advisory council later recommended exclusion only of
 
nonresident military.  The Oahu advisory council's recommendation is
not reflected in the Commission's proceedings.

                           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
without exclusion of nonresidents. Commission staff indicated 
that there would be no change in apportionment without exclusion of nonresidents, but that Oahu County's senate seats would be reduced from 18 to 17 and Hawai' i County's senate seats would be 
increased from 3 to 4 with an extraction of nonresidents of over 20,000. 
The Commission, at its June 28, 2011 meeting, voted 8-1
 
to apportion the state legislature by using the 2010 Census count
 -- without exclusion of nonresident military and dependents and
 nonresident students -- as the permanent resident base.
 
The Commission's June 28, 2011 decision came to the 
attention of Hawai' i County legislator Robert Herkes, who 
immediately sought an opinion from the Attorney General on whether the Commission acted lawfully in deciding to include nonresident military and dependents and nonresident students in the permanent resident base. 
The Attorney General, by letter to Herkes of July 19, 
2011, opined that "the Hawai' i Supreme Court would likely hold 
that to the extent they are identifiable, nonresident college students and nonresident military members and their families cannot properly be included in the reapportionment population base the Commission uses to draw the legislative district lines this year." (Original underscoring). The opinion was based on the legislative history of the 1992 "permanent resident" amendment to article IV, section 4, and the Hawai' i Supreme 
9
                           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Court's interpretation of "resident population," as used the 
Hawai'i County Charter, as excluding nonresident college students 
and nonresident military personnel and their dependents from the population base for purposes of apportioning county council districts.
5 The opinion was forwarded to the Commission. 
The Commission, at its August 17, 2011 meeting, was 
provided by Commission staff with the following summary of data requested and received from DMDC and USPACOM on Hawaii's non­permanent military resident population and from Hawai' i 
universities on non-permanent student resident population. 
STAFF SUMMARY OF DATA SUBMITTED FROM THE MILITARY
 
AND UNIVERSITIES FOR USE IN THE NON-PERMANENT
 
POPULATION ADJUSTMENT TO THE 2010 CENSUS DATA
 
The 2011 reapportionment project staff
asked for non-permanent population data from the
historical data sources to accomplish its
constitutionally required population adjustment
in determining the permanent resident population.
 
The staff requested the military through USPACOM
to provide a data set of Active Duty personnel
and dependents who declare a state other than
Hawaii as their home state.  The data was
 provided segregated by U.S. Postal Zip Codes.
 
USPACOM provided the following counts:
 Active Duty:
Declares state other than Hawaii as home state  47,082
Declares Hawaii as their home state          933
 
Active Du
ty dependents in Hawaii             58,949
 
We are in the proc
ess of evaluating the data to
determine where these people live.  We are then
 trying to place them in Group Quarters on base,
base housing on base, or off-base housing through

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the reported U.S. Zip Code.  We are trying to
accomplish this in a reasonable and appropriate
process.
 
The staff requested the universities throughout
the state to provide data of students who pay out
of state tuition.
 
The universities provided the following counts:
 Hawaii Pacific University international and
mainland students by address.  Some of these
 addresses are associated with military bases or
commands.  3,203
 
Brigham Young University Hawaii international
and non-international students by address    627
 
University of Hawaii System students by U.S.
Zip Codes  10,493
 
Chaminade University did not report.
From their website total enrollment 2,781
59% Hawaii resident 41% other than Hawaii
 
Commission staff provided the following explanation as to
 
"permanent and non-permanent military residents."
 
The non-permanent resident extraction model used
in 1991 and 2001 [reapportionments] relied on
receiving location specific (address or Zip Code)
residence information for the specific non­permanent residents to be extracted.
 
In 2011, the data received from DMDC does not
provide residence information for military
sponsors nor does it provide specific breakdowns
of permanent and non-permanent residents by
location.
 
This lack of specific data from DMDC does not
allow the model used previously to be used at
this time.
 
Commission staff further noted that the DMDC data reported the
 
location of active duty military by the zip codes of their duty
 
stations, not their residences, and that the data did not
 designate the military dependents as residents or nonresidents. 
11
                           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
For these reasons, the Commission decided that the DMDC data did
 
not provide an accurate basis for determining Hawaii's non­permanent military resident population and it decided to use data
 from the 2010 Census for this purpose.
 
Commission staff thereafter developed its own "model" 
for the "extraction of non-permanent residents" for the 2011 reapportionment. Commission staff operated on the premise that non-permanent residents -- active duty military who declare Hawai'i not to be their home state and their dependents, and out­
of-state university students -- were to be identified according to the specific location of their residences within each of the four counties. Because the 2010 Census data and the university data did not include the residence addresses for all of the non­permanent active duty military residents and their dependents and the out-of-state university students, Commission staff identified three groups of non-permanent residents: Extraction A, Extraction B, and Extraction C. The groups were based on the level of "certainty in determining [the residents'] non-permanency and location." Extraction A were residents whose specific locations were certain and included out-of-state university students with known addresses and active duty military, with "fairly certain non-permanent status," living in military barracks. Extraction B included all residents in Extraction A, plus active duty military and their dependents, with "less certain non-permanent status," living in on-base military housing. Extraction C included all

   Oahu    72,609    Oahu    78,524

                           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
residents in Extraction A and Extraction B, plus out-of-state
 
university students with addresses identified only by zip code.
 
From the 2010 Census data and the university data,
 
Commission Staff "extracted" the following numbers of active duty
 military and their dependents and out-of-state university
 students for purposes of computing the permanent residence base
 for the 2011 apportionment.
 Extraction A  
Oahu    15,660 
Hawaii     793 Hawaii     921
 
Maui         4 
Kauai        1    Kauai      143    Kauai      198
 16,458 
The above numbers were presented to the Commission in an
 "Extraction of Non-Permanent Residents" wherein Commission staff
 noted that "under Extractions B or C, Oahu receives 17 and Hawaii
 receives 4 senate seats."
 
The Commission was scheduled to meet at its final
 
meeting on September 19, 2011 to adopt a final reapportionment
 
6
plan. It held a public hearing  in Hilo on September 13, 2011
wherein attorney Stanley Roehrig testified on behalf of Hawai' i 
County Senator Malama Solomon and three members of the Hawai' i 
7
County Democratic Committee  on the "extraction" of nonresidents
for the apportionment of senate seats. Roehrig cited to the
6  HRS § 25-2(a) ("[T]he commission shall conduct public hearings
 
[on legislative reapportionment].  . . .  At least one public hearing
on the proposed reapportionment plan shall be held in each basic
island unit after initial public notice of the plan.").

Commission's August 17, 2011 "Staff Summary" showing a state
 
population of 47,082 non-permanent active duty military
 residents, 58,949 military dependents, and 15,463 out-of-state
 university students. He testified that this total population of
 121,494 must be "extracted" from the total resident population of
 1,330,301 to compute the permanent resident base for the 2011
 apportionment of senate seats and that such computation resulted
 in an increase of Hawai' i County's senate seats from 3 to 4. 
Senator Solomon, at the September 13, 2011 public
 
hearing, read into the record the following September 12, 2011
 letter to the Commission from Governor Abercrombie.
 
I want to register my strong support for drawing
the [legislative district] lines on the basis of
residency.
 
The alternative of including non-residents in the
count severely distorts the actual population
shifts which have taken place across Hawaii over
the last 10 years.
 
In particular, the population growth on the Big
Island will literally be ignored and in effect
non-residents substituted for them in the guise
of phantom voters.  The likelihood of non­residents registering in any numbers remotely
reflecting the population changes I've cited is
highly unlikely.
 
Arguments have been made that formulating
districts absent a non-resident count would be
 challenging.  Such an observation is entirely
beside the point.  One does not fail to implement
one's duty under the law because doing so
presents difficulties, logistical or otherwise.
 
On the contrary, our obligation is to adhere to
policies that reflect the legislative intent of
the law regardless of whatever obstacles may
appear.
 
14
                           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In this instance my understanding is that
sufficient information exists to reasonably
account for the whereabouts of non-residents
 enough so that any contention that adequate
knowledge is not available is essentially moot.
 
I believe the Attorney General has already
presented a preliminary view that counting non­residents is not warranted in law and it
 certainly is not the present practice.  I believe
 that to undermine or deny Neighbor Island
population growth for redistricting purposes is
discriminatory on its face.
 
Eight of the nine members of the Commission met as
 
scheduled on September 19, 2011 to vote on a final
 
reapportionment plan. Commission staff briefed the Commission on
 the "extraction of non-permanent residents" presented in
 Extractions A, B and C.
 
After briefing and discussion, it was moved by
 
Chairperson Marks and seconded by Commissioner Thomason that the
 Commission compute the permanent resident base for the 2011
 legislative apportionment by excluding, from the 2010 census
 population, the 16,458 residents identified in Extraction A.
 
Commissioners Nonaka and Moore voted "no" as to any
 
exclusion of nonresidents as discriminatory. Commissioners
 Thomason, Chipchase, Stone, and Hashimoto voted "yes" to
 Extraction A as providing a "precise," "certain," and
 "identifiable" base of non-permanent residents. Commissioner
 Takitani voted "no" to Extraction A because the Commission's data
 on active duty military, military dependents, and out-of-state
 university students showed a non-permanent resident population of
 
15
                           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
"at least" 61,411 and "potentially" 120,360. Chairperson Marks 
stated a "preference" for Extraction B of 73,552 non-permanent residents because, according to the Commission's data, 47,082 active duty military declare Hawai' i as not their home and, "on a 
numbers basis," "73,552 [Extraction B] is closer to 47,082 than 16,4[58] [Extraction A] is to 47,082." The vote for Extraction A standing at 4 "yes" votes and 3 "no" votes, Marks -- stating that "some extraction has to occur" and "we need a majority to have some extraction take place" -- "reluctantly" voted "yes" for Extraction A, even though it "didn't represent everything [she] would like." 
The Commission adopted a final reapportionment plan 
that computed the permanent resident base by excluding 16,458 active duty military and out-of-state university students from the 2010 census population of 1,330,301 and apportioned each house of the legislature by allocating and maintaining, as to the senate, 18 seats for Oahu County, 3 seats for Hawai' i County, 3 
seats for Maui County, and 1 seat for Kauai County. The Commission filed its 2011 Final Reapportionment Plan with Chief Election Officer Scott Nago on September 26, 2011. Nago gave public notice of the final reapportionment plan sometime thereafter.

On October 10, 2011, a petition challenging the 2011 
Final Reapportionment Plan was filed with this court by Hawai' i 
16
                           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
County Senator Solomon and Hawai' i County Democratic Committee 
members Hao, Cook and Pavao (collectively "Solomon"). They 
asserted that: (1) the concept of "permanent residents" in article IV, section 4 was "designed to extract all, not some of the nonresident military, [nonresident military] dependents and nonresident students from the entire population base" for apportionment of the state legislature; (2) the Commission was provided by its own expert staff with "a reasonably accurate statewide count" of approximately 121,494 nonresident military, nonresident military dependents, and nonresident students, but the Commission extracted from this count "only a modest portion" of some 16,000 nonresident military and nonresident students and "willfully refused" to follow its own Standards and Criteria requiring extraction of nonresident students and nonresident military from the permanent resident population base; (3) the Commission was not required to have extraction information that was "neighborhood specific" "to perform the article IV, section 4 statewide extraction of non-permanent residents" and it improperly extracted nonresidents "island by island from specific locations" rather than "off the top of the statewide census base;" and (4) the Commission "knew that extraction in excess of 20,000 would trigger the loss of an Oahu-based senator from [a nonresident military and nonresident student] neighborhood," "the fear of Oahu's loss of this senate seat was the driving force for the Commission's 5-3 vote that effectively denied Hawai' i County 
17
                           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
a 4th senate seat," and "there can be no other rational
 
explanation for the Commission's action." 
A second petition challenging the 2011 Final 
Reapportionment Plan was filed with this court on October 11, 2011 by Hawai' i County resident Michael Matsukawa. Matsukawa had 
testified at the Commission's September 14, 2011 public hearing in Kona and had urged the Commission to abide by article IV, section 4's requirement of apportioning the state legislature on a permanent resident base that excluded nonresident military. He asserted in his petition that: (1) the Commission -- by employing Extraction A -- "removed only some of the identifiable and locatable non-permanent residents from the population base, but not a sufficient number so as to affect the current apportionment of legislative seats among the state's four basic island units, a result that could have been achieved if the Commission employed Extraction B or Extraction C or had developed any other methodology within a reasonable time;" (2) the Commission failed to make an honest and good faith effort to execute its duty to apportion the state legislature in accordance with article IV, section 4 by using its statutory power to gather information necessary to identify and locate non-permanent residents, but instead "bemoaned the difficulty of its work" and acted out of "convenience" to adopt a final reapportionment plan by the September 26, 2011 statutory deadline; and (3) the 2011 Final Reapportionment Plan dilutes the representational interest of 
18

Hawai'i County in the state legislature by denying Hawai' i County 
an additional seat in the senate. 
Solomon's and Matsukawa's petitions both sought: (1) a
 
judgment invalidating the 2011 Final Reapportionment Plan for the
 
state legislature; (2) a writ of mandamus directing the
 Commission to prepare and file a new reapportionment plan for the
 state legislature, and (3) a writ of mandamus directing Chief
 Election Officer Nago to rescind the publication of the 2011
 Final Reapportionment Plan.
 
The Commission and the Chief Election Officer, as
 
respondents to Solomon's and Matsukawa's petitions, were directed
 to answer the petitions and they answered on November 18, 2011. 
They argued that the Commission "properly followed the mandate of
 article IV, section 4" because the Commission determined the
 total resident population of each county by "identify[ing] and
 locat[ing] (by census block) the non-permanent residents to be
 excluded or extracted (active duty military members living in
 group quarters on base and non-resident students attending a
 university in Hawaii)."
 
Governor Abercrombie, as respondent to Solomon's
 
petition, was also directed to answer the petition and he
 answered on November 21, 2011. He argued that the Commission,
 "by its own admission," "did not extract all of the non-resident
 university students and active military personnel and their
 dependents who declared themselves to be residents of other
 
19
                           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
states, from the population base it used to develop the Final
 
2011 Reapportionment Plan." He "agree[d] with [Solomon] that the
 [Commission] did not use the correct population base to allocate
 the seats of the State Senate (and the State House) under article
 IV, section 4 and that the Commission must be compelled to
 correct this error and prepare a revised Final Reapportionment
 Plan."
 
On January 4, 2012, we heard oral argument on Solomon's
 
and Matsukawa's petitions. That day, we issued orders granting
 the petitions. We concluded that the 2011 Final Reapportionment
 Plan is constitutionally invalid because it includes non­permanent residents in the population base that the Commission
 used to allocate the members of the state legislature among the
 basic island units. We invalidated the 2011 Final
 Reapportionment Plan and directed the Commission to prepare and
 file a new reapportionment plan that: (1) allocates the members
 of the state legislature among the basic island units by using a
 permanent resident population base, and then (2) apportions the
 members among the districts therein as provided by article IV,
 section 6. We further directed the Chief Election Officer to
 rescind the publication of the 2011 Final Reapportionment Plan
 for the state legislature.

III. DISCUSSION
 
The Inclusion Of Non-Permanent Residents In The 
Population Base For The 2011 Reapportionment Of The
State Legislature Is An Error In The 2011 Final
Reapportionment Plan That Renders The Plan
Constitutionally Invalid.
 
"We have long recognized that the Hawai' i Constitution 
must be construed with due regard to the intent of the framers 
and the people adopting it, and the fundamental principle in interpreting a constitutional principle is to give effect to that intent." Save Sunset Beach Coalition v. Honolulu, 102 Hawai' i 
465, 474, 78 P.3d 1, 10 (2003), quoting Convention Center Auth. v. Anzai, 78 Hawai' i 157, 167, 890 P.2d 1197, 1207 (1995). 
Article IV, sections 4 and 6 provide for apportionment 
of the state legislature by using a "permanent resident" base. This "mandate[s] that only residents having their domiciliary in the State of Hawai' i may be counted in the population base for 
the purpose of reapportioning legislative districts." Citizens 
for Equit. & Resp. Gov't v. County, 108 Hawai' i at 322, 120 P.3d 
at 221. 
Article IV, sections 4 and 6 provide a two-step process
 
for apportionment of the state legislature: apportionment among
 the four counties, followed by apportionment within the four
 counties. Article IV, section 4 first requires the Commission to
 "allocate the total number of members of each house of the state
 legislature being apportioned among the four basic island units,
 . . . using the total number of permanent residents in each of
 
22
                           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the basic units and computed by the method known as the method of
 
equal proportions[.]" Upon such allocation, article IV, section
 6 then requires the Commission to "apportion the members among
 the districts therein" and "redraw district lines where necessary
 in such manner that for each house the average number of
 permanent residents per member of each district is as nearly
 equal to the average for the basic island unit as practicable."
 
As explained at the constitutional convention
 
proceeding on apportionment of the state legislature,
 "[a]pportionment [under article III, section 4, now article IV,
 section 4] is the process of allocating numbers of
 representatives or senators to various districts within the
 State. Districting [under article III, section 4, now article
 IV, section 6] is the process of making those districts. These
 are quite different activities." Debates in Committee of the
 Whole on THE LEGISLATURE -- Apportionment and Districting, II
 Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of Hawaii of 1968,
 at 204 (1972).
 
Apportionment of the state legislature in 2011 required
 
the Commission, in step one, to allocate the 25 members of the
 senate and 51 members of the house of representatives among the
 four counties. The Commission was then required, in step two, to
 apportion the senate and house members within county districts. 
Allocation under step one required the Commission to:
 
(1) determine the total number of permanent residents in the
 
23
                           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
state; (2) divide the total number of permanent residents by 25
 
and 51 to determine the average number of permanent residents per
 member of each senate and house district; and (3) divide the
 total number of permanent residents in each county by the average
 number of permanent residents per member of each senate and house
 district. Such allocation required the Commission, as an initial
 step, to determine the total number of permanent residents in the
 state and in each county.
 
Determining the total number of permanent residents in
 
the state and in each county required the Commission, in step
 one, to extract non-permanent military residents and non­permanent university student residents from the state's and the
 counties' 2010 Census population. Apportioning the senate and
 house members among nearly equal numbers of permanent residents
 required the Commission, in step two, to identify the specific
 locations of non-permanent military residents and non-permanent
 university student residents.
 
The Commission acknowledged a 2010 statewide population 
of at least 62,545 out-of-state university students and active duty military who declare Hawai' i not to be their home state. 
The Commission further acknowledged a 2010 statewide population of 58,949 military dependents, the majority of whom are presumably the dependents of 47,082 active duty military -- out of 48,015 active duty military -- who declare Hawai' i not to be 
their home state. From these numbers, the Commission extracted, 
24
                           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
as non-permanent residents, only 16,458 student and military
 
residents with identifiable residence addresses. Identification
 of the residence addresses for the non-permanent residents was
 necessary for apportionment of the senate and house members
 within the county districts under step two, but was not necessary
 for allocation of the senate and house members among the four
 counties under step one.
 
The Commission's data identified, by zip codes, the 
47,082 active duty military who declare Hawai' i not to be their 
home state and the 58,949 military dependents. The data identified 3,203 out-of-state students at Hawaii Pacific University, 627 out-of-state students at Brigham Young University, 1,140 out-of-state students at Chaminade University, and 10,493 out-of-state students at the University of Hawaii (UH) Manoa and Hilo. The UH out-of-state student population of 10,493 consists of 1,233 out-of-state students at UH-Hilo, according to public information provided by Solomon to the Commission. 
The Commission had sufficient data to determine the 
non-permanent military resident populations of each of the counties. The Commission also had data to determine -- by the site of Hawaii's universities -- the non-permanent student resident populations of each of the counties. As to Hawai' i 
County, Solomon used the Commission's data and identified for the Commission -- by the zip codes of the active duty military and their dependents -- 28 active duty military and 201 military 
25
                           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
dependents in Hawai' i County. Solomon also identified for the 
Commission the 1,233 out-of-state students in Hawai' i County at 
UH-Hilo. The Commission rejected Solomon's method of identifying 
the non-permanent resident population of Hawai' i County and 
identified and excluded only 793 residents from Hawai' i County's 
permanent population. 
The Commission contends that it apportioned the state
 
legislature in accordance with article IV, section 4 because it
 excluded, from the counties' permanent resident populations, only
 non-permanent residents identifiable to particular census blocks. 
However, HRS § 25-2(a) requires the Commission to apportion the
 state legislature on the "basis, method and criteria" prescribed
 by article IV, which provides, in section 4, for apportionment
 "using the total number of permanent residents in each of the
 basic island units." Nothing in article IV, section 4 requires
 apportionment based on the total number of permanent residents
 identified by census block. The 1991 Reapportionment Commission
 used census blocks to identify, count and locate non-permanent
 residents, but such method of determining the permanent resident
 population base was not incorporated in article IV, section 4. 
The Commission's method of apportioning the state
 
legislature did not properly separate the step one process of
 allocating the legislative members among the four counties from
 the step two process of apportioning the members within county
 districts. Identifying the non-permanent resident population for
 
26
                           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
step one and identifying the non-permanent resident population
 
for step two were separate processes. The Commission
 acknowledged at oral argument that it did not differentiate the
 step one process from the step two process.
 
The Commission's military data, university data and
 
census data on the state's non-permanent residents identified,
 for step one, the resident counties for over 100,000 non­permanent residents, but identified, for step two, the residence
 addresses for only 16,458 non-permanent residents. The
 Commission undertook its reapportionment task by focusing solely
 on identification of non-permanent residents for step two and
 using the results for step two to identify the non-permanent
 resident population for step one. The result is a Final
 Reapportionment Plan that includes -- in the population base that
 the Commission used to allocate the 25 members of the senate and
 51 members of the house of representatives among the basic island
 units -- at least 45,996 non-permanent university student
 residents and non-permanent active duty military residents, as
 well as thousands of other non-permanent residents who are the
 dependents of the 47,082 non-permanent active duty military
 residents. The Final Reapportionment Plan disregards the express
 mandate of article IV, section 4 that only permanent residents be
 counted in the population base for the purpose of reapportionment
 of the state legislature. The inclusion of non-permanent
 residents in the population base for the 2011 reapportionment of
 
27
                           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the state legislature is an error in the Final Reapportionment
 
Plan. The error renders the Final Reapportionment Plan
 constitutionally invalid under article IV, section 4. 
We invoke our power under article IV, section 10 to
 
correct the error in the Final Reapportionment Plan. The
 Commission must prepare and file a new plan for the 2011
 reapportionment of the state legislature. In preparing a new
 plan, the Commission must first -- pursuant to article IV,
 section 4 -- determine the total number of permanent residents in
 the state and in each county and use those numbers to allocate
 the 25 members of the senate and 51 members of the house of
 representatives among the four counties. Upon such allocation,
 the Commission must then -- pursuant to article IV, section 6 -­apportion the senate and house members among nearly equal numbers
 of permanent residents within each of the four counties.
