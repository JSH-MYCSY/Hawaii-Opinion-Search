ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Raymond Gonsalves' 
petition for a writ of mandamus and the papers in support, it 
appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief. 
Therefore, petitioner is not 
entitled to mandamus relief. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 
204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
 
obtain the requested action.). Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of appellate court
 
shall process the petition for writ of mandamus without payment
 of the filing fee.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
