IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I
 
MICHAEL J. MATSUKAWA, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I 2011 REAPPORTIONMENT COMMISSION; and
SCOTT NAGO, CHIEF ELECTION OFFICER, STATE OF HAWAI' I,
Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of respondents 2011 Reapportionment 
Commission and Chief Election Officer's motion for 
reconsideration and/or clarification of the January 4, 2012 order and the January 6, 2012 opinion granting the petition for a writ of mandamus, the papers in support and the record, it appears that the lack of complete information about the non-permanent status and location of Hawaii's non-residents is no basis for disregarding the express mandate of the Hawai' i Constitution, 
article IV, section 4, that only permanent residents be counted in the population base for the purpose of reapportionment of the state legislature.
 
It further appears that the January 6, 2012 opinion
 
discussed and disposed of the sole issue presented in
 
petitioner's petition as to whether the inclusion of non­permanent residents in the population base for the 2011 Final
 Reapportionment Plan constituted an error in the Reapportionment
 Plan. How the Commission identifies the non-permanent resident
 population for apportionment under article IV, section 4 and
 whether the Commission must follow the procedures set forth in
 HRS § 25-2 in preparing and filing a new reapportionment plan
 were not issues in petitioner's mandamus proceeding.
 
It finally appears that the January 6, 2012 opinion 
advises the Commission that apportionment under article IV,
 section 6 requires the Commission to "make an honest and good
 faith effort to construct districts as nearly of equal population
 as is practicable. . . . [M]athematical exactness or precision
 [is not a] constitutional requirement." Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for
 
reconsideration and/or clarification is denied.
