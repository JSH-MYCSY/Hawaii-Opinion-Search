WILLIAM MIDDLETON, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE GERALD H. KIBE, JUDGE OF THE DISTRICT
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIVIL NO. 1SC11-1-1620)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the motion for reconsideration of
 
the October 31, 2011 order denying the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus, it appears that the motion for reconsideration -- filed
 on November 21, 2011 -- was not filed within 10 days after the
 filing of the October 31, 2011 order. See
 HRAP 40(a) ("A motion
 
for reconsideration may be filed by a party only within 10 days
 after the filing of the opinion, dispositional order, or ruling
 unless by special leave additional time is granted during such
 period by a judge or justice of the appellate court involved."). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for
 
reconsideration is denied as untimely. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, November 22, 2011.
