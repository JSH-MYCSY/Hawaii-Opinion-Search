IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I
 
KEITH MURAUSKAS, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Keith Murauskas'
 
petition for a writ of mandamus and the papers in support, it
 
appears that petitioner has no clear and indisputable right to
 appeal to the circuit court pursuant to HRCP Rule 72 inasmuch as
 there is no statute that provides a right of review in the
 circuit court of a decision or action of the supreme court
 clerk's office. See
 HRCP Rule 72(a) ("Where a right of
 
redetermination or review in a circuit court is allowed by
 statute, any person adversely affected by the decision, order or
 action of a governmental official or body other than a court, may
 appeal from such decision, order or action by filing a notice of
 appeal in the circuit court having jurisdiction of the matter.") 
(underscoring added). Therefore, petitioner is not entitled to mandamus relief. See In re Disciplinary Bd. of Hawaii Supreme 
Court, 91 Hawai' i 363, 368, 984 P.2d 688, 693 (1999) (Mandamus 
relief is available to compel an official to perform a duty allegedly owed to an individual only if the individual’s claim is clear and certain, the official’s duty is ministerial and so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt, and no other remedy is available.). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 25, 2012.
