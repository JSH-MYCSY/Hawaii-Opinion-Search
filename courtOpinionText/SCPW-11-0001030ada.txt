KEITH RUSSELL JUDD, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I OFFICE OF ELECTIONS, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Keith Russell Judd's 
petition for a writ of mandamus, it appears that petitioner fails 
to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief. Therefore, petitioner is not entitled to mandamus relief. See 
HRS § 602-5(3) (2010) (“The supreme court shall have jurisdiction and power . . . [t]o exercise original jurisdiction in all questions . . . arising under writs of mandamus directed to public officers to compel them to fulfill the duties of their offices[.]”); 
In re Disciplinary Bd. of Hawaii Supreme Court, 91 
Hawai'i 363, 368, 984 P.2d 688, 693 (1999) (Mandamus relief is 
available to compel an official to perform a duty allegedly owed to an individual only if the individual’s claim is clear and
 
certain, the official’s duty is ministerial and so plainly
 prescribed as to be free from doubt, and no other remedy is
 available.). Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for writ of mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
