IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI

BENJAMIN ACUNA, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the letters to the Chief Justice and 
Associate Justices submitted by Petitioner Benjamin Acuna 
concerning the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and Petitioner Acuna’s counsel Emmanuel V. Tipon, which we consider as a petition for a writ of mandamus, materials submitted by ODC in response to our December 27, 2011 order, and the record, it 
appears that ODC did not abuse its discretion in the matter. See 
In re Disciplinary Board of the Hawai
'i Supreme Court, 91 Hawai' i 
363, 368, 370-71, 984 P.2d 688, 693, 695-96 (1999). It further 
appears that Petitioner Acuna’s request regarding the files in the possession of attorney Tipon is moot. Therefore,  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, February 9, 2012.
