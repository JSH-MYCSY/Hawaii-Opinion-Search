'I
 
DR. ORLY TAITZ, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE RHONDA A. NISHIMURA, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT
' COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAII, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Dr. Orly Taitz's 
petition for a writ of mandamus, it appears that petitioner fails 
to demonstrate an entitlement to mandamus relief. See Kema v. 
Gaddis
, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of 
mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action. Such writs are not intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the lower courts, nor are they intended to serve as legal remedies in lieu of normal appellate procedures. ). Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 12, 2012.
