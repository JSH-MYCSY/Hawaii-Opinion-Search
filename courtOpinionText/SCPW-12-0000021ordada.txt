IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
WAYNE M. SAKAI and SAKAI IWANAGA SUTTON LAW GROUP, Petitioners,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE RANDAL G.B VALENCIANO, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI 'I and
 
DTRIC INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED, Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0076)
 
ORDER GRANTING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.
and Circuit Judge Chan, in place of Acoba, J., recused)
 
Upon consideration of petitioners Wayne M. Sakai and
 
Sakai Iwanaga Sutton Law Group's petition for a writ of mandamus
 
and the responses thereto, it appears that: (1) Cades Schutte, as
 a result of its representation of petitioners, obtained
 confidential information of a non-public nature that, if known to
 any other client of Cades Schutte, could be used by such client
 to petitioners' material disadvantage and (2) petitioners'
 February 28, 2010 prospective conflict waiver did not, by its
 terms, apply in such instance. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is granted. The respondent judge is directed to: (1)
 
vacate the December 12, 2011 order denying petitioners' motion to
 disqualify Cades Schutte as plaintiff's counsel in Civil No. 11Â­1-0076 and (2) enter an order disqualifying Cades Schutte as
 plaintiff's counsel in Civil No. 11-1-0076.
