IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
BURKE MCPHEETERS BORDNER & ESTES, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE RANDAL G.B VALENCIANO, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI 'I and
 
DTRIC INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED, Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIVIL NO. 11-1-0076)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.
and Circuit Judge Chan, in place of Acoba, J., recused)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Burke McPheeters
 
Bordner & Estes' petition for a writ of mandamus and the
 
responses thereto, it appears that: (1) Cades Schutte, as a
 result of its representation of petitioner, obtained confidential
 information of a non-public nature that, if known to any other
 client of Cades Schutte, could be used by such client to
 petitioner's material disadvantage and (2) petitioner's December
 30, 2009 advanced conflict waiver did not, by its terms, apply in
 such instance. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is granted. The respondent judge is directed to: (1)
 
vacate the December 12, 2011 order denying petitioner's motion to
 disqualify Cades Schutte as plaintiff's counsel in Civil No. 11Â­1-0076 and (2) enter an order disqualifying Cades Schutte as
 plaintiff's counsel in Civil No. 11-1-0076.
