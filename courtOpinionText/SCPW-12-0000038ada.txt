IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI

JEAN A. KO, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE MATTHEW J. VIOLA, JUDGE OF THE FAMILY
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI' I and
 
JARRET H.C. KO, Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(FC-D NO. 10-1-6819)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.
and Circuit Judge Crandall, in place of Acoba, J., recused)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Jean A. Ko's petition 
for a writ of mandamus and the papers in support, it appears that 
petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and disputable right to relief and petitioner can seek relief from the respondent judge's pre-decree orders at the proceedings to finally divide and distribute the parties' estate. 
Therefore, petitioner is not 
entitled to mandamus relief. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 
204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
 
obtain the requested action.). Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, February 14, 2012.
