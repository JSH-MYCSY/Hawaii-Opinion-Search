GLENN OAMILDA, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
2011 COUNCIL REAPPORTIONMENT COMMISSION and
 
2011 STATE REAPPORTIONMENT COMMISSION, Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus filed by petitioner Glenn Oamilda, it appears that: (1)
 
Revised Ordinances of Honolulu, article III, section 3-103 does
 not require that communities remain undivided in the
 reapportionment of council districts; 
see Kawamoto v. Okata, 75
 
Haw. 463, 468-69, 868 P.2d 1183, 1186 (1994); (2) article III,
 section 3-103 does not require that council districts be drawn on
 a permanent resident population base; and (3) petitioner's
 assertions that the Council Reapportionment Commission did not
 follow lawful process are not supported by any evidence. 
Consequently, petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and
 indisputable right to relief and petitioner is not entitled to 
mandamus relief. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 
P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action.). 
It further appears that: (1) petitioner's challenge to 
the 2011 Final Reapportionment Plan for the State Legislature is untimely; see Hawai' i Constitution, article IV, section 10; and 
(2) the 2011 Final Reapportionment Plan for the State Legislature
 was invalidated on January 4, 2012. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is: (1) denied as to relief against the 2011 Council
 Reapportionment Commission and (2) dismissed as to relief against
 the 2011 State Reapportionment Commission.
