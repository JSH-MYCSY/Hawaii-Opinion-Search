ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Greg W. Schoenlein's 
petition for a writ of mandamus, the respondents' answers and the 
record of S.P.P. No. 11-1-0028, it appears that the State of 
Hawai'i filed an answer in S.P.P. No. 11-1-0028 on March 2, 2012 
and S.P.P. No. 11-1-0028 was disposed of on March 7, 2012. Petitioner's request for mandamus relief is moot. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied as moot.
