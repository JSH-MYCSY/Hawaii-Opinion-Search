ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and McKenna, JJ. and
Circuit Judge Wilson, in place of Duffy, J., recused)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Cedric Ah Sing's
petition for a writ of mandamus, the respondent judge's answer,
and the record of S.P.P. No. 11-1-0035, it appears that the
petition for post-conviction relief and motion for appointment of
counsel filed in S.P.P. No. 11-1-0035 was disposed of on May 10,
2012. Petitioner's request for mandamus relief is moot.
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied as moot.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, June 6, 2012.
