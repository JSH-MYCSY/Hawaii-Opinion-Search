IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(Civil No. 1RC 10-1-10634)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Nakayama, Acting C.J., Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ. and
Circuit Judge Chan, in place of Recktenwald, C.J., recused)
 
Upon consideration of petitioners Arna Lahela Johnson 
and Geralyn Lapitan Camarillo's petition for a writ of mandamus 
and the papers in support, it appears that the April 5, 2012 order denying petitioners' post-judgment "motion to vacate orders" is a final order of the district court appealable pursuant to HRS ยง 641-1(a). 
Petitioners can obtain appellate 
review of the April 5, 2012 order and can seek a stay pending appeal of the execution of the writ of possession pursuant to HRAP Rule 8. Therefore, petitioners are not entitled to mandamus relief. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai
'i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334,  338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that
 
will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and
 indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to
 redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
 action. Such writs are not intended to supersede the legal
 discretionary authority of the lower courts, nor are they
 intended to serve as legal remedies in lieu of normal appellate
 procedures). Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
