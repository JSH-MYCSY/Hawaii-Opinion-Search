MICHAEL TIERNEY, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I,
Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(ICA No. 29993)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael Tierney's 
petition for a writ of mandamus, it appears that petitioner fails 
to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief. Therefore, petitioner is not entitled to mandamus relief. See 
Kema v. Gaddis
, 91 Hawai 'i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action.). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
