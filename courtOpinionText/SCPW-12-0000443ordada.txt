IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
MICHAEL TIERNEY, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
FRANCIS SEQUEIRA, WARDEN, OAHU COMMUNITY CORRECTIONAL
CENTER, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and McKenna, JJ.
and Circuit Judge Chang, in place of Duffy, J., recused)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael Tierney's
 
petition for a writ of mandamus filed on May 3, 2012 and the
 
respondent's answer, it appears that respondent acknowledged that 
petitioner had a right to access his legal materials while in
 protective custody, but respondent failed to rebut petitioner's
 statement that petitioner was not allowed access to his trial and
 appellate court papers. 
Access should have been allowed pursuant
 
to Corrections Administration Policy and Procedures, Policy No.
 COR.11.01, Section 3.4(f). However, petitioner was transferred
 out of respondent's facility on May 23, 2012 and the request for
 mandamus relief is moot. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
  mandamus is denied as moot. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, June 29, 2012.
