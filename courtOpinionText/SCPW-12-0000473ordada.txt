IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF CHRIS GRINDING
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Chris Grindlingâ€™s 
petition for an extraordinary writ filed on May 9, 2012, it 
appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief. 
Therefore, petitioner is not 
entitled to extraordinary relief. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai 'i 
200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (An extraordinary writ will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action.). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for an extraordinary writ
 without payment of the filing fee.
 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for an
 
extraordinary writ is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, May 17, 2012.
