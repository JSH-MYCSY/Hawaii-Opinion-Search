IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
MICHAEL TIERNEY, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE RICHARD K. PERKINS, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 08-1-0869)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and McKenna, JJ.
and Circuit Judge Browning, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael Tierney's 
petition for a writ of mandamus, it appears that petitioner fails 
to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief. Therefore, petitioner is not entitled to mandamus relief. 
See 
Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai 'i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action.). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
