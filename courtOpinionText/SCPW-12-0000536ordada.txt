ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(Civil No. 09-1-0922-04)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and McKenna, JJ.
and Circuit Judge Castagnetti, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Association of
 
Apartment Owners of Moana Pacific's petition for a writ of
 
mandamus and the papers in support, it appears that the
 respondent judge had inherent power, pursuant to HRS § 603­21.9(6), to prohibit petitioner from replacing the Moana Pacific
 PEX water system until completion of the HRS Chapter 672E
 process. Prohibiting petitioner from replacing the PEX system 
until the HRS Chapter 672E process is complete was not a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion. Therefore, petitioner is not entitled to mandamus relief. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai
'i 200, 
204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action. Such writs are not intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the lower courts, nor are they intended to serve as legal remedies in lieu of normal appellate procedures. Where a court has discretion to act, mandamus will not lie to interfere with or control the exercise of that discretion, even when the judge has acted erroneously, unless the judge has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in which it has a legal duty to act.). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, June 22, 2012.
