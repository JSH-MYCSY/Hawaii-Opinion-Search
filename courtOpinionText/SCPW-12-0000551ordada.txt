ZEPHYR INSURANCE COMPANY, INC., Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE KARL K. SAKAMOTO, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT 
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI 'I;
INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; and DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE
AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I,
INSURANCE DIVISION, Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CI
VIL No. 10-1-2078-09)
 
ORDER GRANTING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By
: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and McKenna, JJ.
and Circuit Judge Ahn, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Zephyr Insurance Company,
 
Inc.'s petition for a writ of mandamus and the papers in support, it
 
appears that HRS ยง 235-114(a) (Supp. 2011) authorizes an appeal to
 
the tax appeal court from any assessment of income tax or
 
liability imposed by HRS Chapter 235. HRS ยง 235-114(c) (Supp.
 2011) requires the notice of appeal to be filed in the tax appeal
 court "within thirty days subsequent to the date when the notice
 of assessment was mailed." The DCCA insurance division's
 November 15, 2010 letter on petitioner's tax credit claim -- if
 appealable by petitioner pursuant to HRS ยง 235-114(a), as the
 respondent judge determined -- was appealable by notice of appeal
 
filed within thirty days after the letter was mailed. The
 November 15, 2010 letter was presumably mailed when it was
 written, the time for filing an appeal under HRS ยง 235-114
 expired in 2010, and an appeal to the tax appeal court is now
 precluded. The respondent judge's rulings to the contrary were
 incorrect. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the answer provision of HRAP
 
21(c) is suspended pursuant to HRAP 2.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is granted. The respondent judge shall set aside the
 stay of Civil No. 10-1-2078-09 and shall proceed to hear and
 dispose of petitioner's agency appeal.
