IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I 
MYLES D. SAPUTO,
Petitioner, 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE BARCLAY MACDONALD, PER DIEM JUDGE OF
THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI' I,
Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and McKenna, JJ., and
Circuit Judge Pollack, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
By letters dated June 25, 2012, Myles D. Saputo seeks
 
review of the actions of Second Circuit District Per Diem Judge
 
Barclay MacDonald in Case No. 2RC10-1-004119, Citibank (South
 Dakota), N.A. v. Myles D. Saputo. We view the letters as a
 petition for writ of mandamus. 
A writ of mandamus and/or prohibition is
an extraordinary remedy that will not issue
unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear
and indisputable right to the relief
requested and a lack of other means to
redress adequately the alleged wrong or to
 obtain the requested action. Straub Clinic & 
Hospital v. Kochi, 81 Hawai' i 410, 414, 917
P.2d 1284, 1288 (1996). Such writs are not 
meant to supersede the legal discretionaryauthority of the lower court, nor are theymeant to serve as legal remedies in lieu of
normal appellate procedures. Id. Where a 
trial court has discretion to act, mandamus
will not lie to interfere with or control the exercise of that discretion, even when thejudge has acted erroneously, unless the judgehas exceeded his or her jurisdiction, hascommitted a flagrant and manifest abuse ofdiscretion, or has refused to act on asubject properly before the court undercircumstances in which it has a legal duty toact. 
Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-205, 982 P.2d 334, 338-339 
(1999).
 
Petitioner Saputo’s letters make a number of
 
allegations, but provide nothing from the court record to support
 
the allegations, and review of the public docket for case number
 2RC10-1-004119 reveals the case is pending in the district court. 
Petitioner will have the opportunity to seek review by way of
 appeal after judgment is entered in case number 2RC10-1-004119. 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Clerk shall file
 
Petitioner Saputo’s letters as a petition for writ of mandamus,
 without payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Petition is denied. 
This denial is without prejudice to any timely appeal, complaint 
-2­    to the Commission on Judicial Conduct, or other lawful means of
 
seeking redress.
