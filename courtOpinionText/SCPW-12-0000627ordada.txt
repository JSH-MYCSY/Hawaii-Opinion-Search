STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 08-1-0869 (S.P.P. 12-1-0011); 1P108-6561)
 
ORDER DISMISSING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael C. Tierney’s
 
July 10, 2012 petition for a writ of habeas corpus and the papers
 
in support, the July 19, 2012 amendments to the petition, and the
 record, it appears that habeas corpus relief is available to
 petitioner in the circuit court pursuant to HRS § 660-3 (1993),
 other judicial remedies, including post-conviction relief, are
 available in both the district court and the circuit court and
 petitioner presents no special reason for invoking the supreme
 court’s original jurisdiction. See Oili v. Chang
, 57 Haw. 411,
 
412, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
habeas corpus is dismissed without prejudice.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, August 23, 2012.
