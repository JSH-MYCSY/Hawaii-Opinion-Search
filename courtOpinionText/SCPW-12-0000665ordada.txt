IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
ONEPO'OKELAOIAI 'OA'OKEKAULAOEZEKIELA SUGAR
 
CRAIG-RODENHURST, aka POOKELA, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE MAURA M. OKAMOTO, JUDGE OF THE DISTRICT
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CITATION NO. 1DT1-12-0093484)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of O.S. Craig-Rodenhurst’s “Affidavit 
of Truth”, which we treat as a petition for writ of mandamus, it 
appears that Hawaii Revised Statutes chapter 291D and Hawaii Civil 
Traffic Rules 18 and 19 provide the available remedies to seek a 
review of the May 14, 2012 default judgment. 
Therefore, petitioner 
is not entitled to mandamus relief. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai 'i 
200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is an 
extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner 
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of 
alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain 
the requested action). Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ mandamus without
 
payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, August 8, 2012.
