IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
ONEPO'OKELAOIAI 'OA'OKEKAULAOEZEKIELA SUGAR
 
CRAIG-RODENHURST, aka POOKELA, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE PHILIP DOI, JUDGE OF THE DISTRICT
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CITATION NO. 1DTC-12-002887)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama,Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack,JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of O.S. Craig-Rodenhurst’s 
“Affidavit of Truth,” which we treat as a petition for a writ of 
mandamus, it appears that petitioner has adequate remedies available to challenge the entry of the not guilty plea entered at the May 14, 2012 arraignment and plea hearing. 
Therefore, 
petitioner is not entitled to mandamus relief. See Kema v. 
Gaddis, 91 Hawai 'i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of 
mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
 
payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, August 23, 2012. 
/s/ Mark E. Recktenwald /s/ Paula A. Nakayama /s/ Simeon R. Acoba, Jr. /s/ Sabrina S. McKenna /s/ Richard W. Pollack
