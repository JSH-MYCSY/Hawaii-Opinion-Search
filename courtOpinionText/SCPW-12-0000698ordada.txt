ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 93-0141)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPLICATION FOR RECONSIDERATION
 
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the document submitted by Francis
 
Grandinetti entitled “Reconsideration Application for Judgment
 
Entered on Supervisory Mandamus and Habeas Corpus Case”, dated
 October 2, 2012 and filed October 16, 2012, the documents
 attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the
 record, it appears that the request for reconsideration of the
 September 6, 2012 order denying the petition for a writ of habeas
 corpus and a writ of mandamus is untimely. See HRAP 40(a) (“A
 
motion for reconsideration may be filed by a party only within 10
 days after the filing of the opinion, dispositional order, or
 ruling unless by special leave additional time is granted during 
such period by a judge or justice of the appellate court involved.”); see also Setala v. J.C. Penney Co., 97 Hawai' i 484, 
485, 40 P.3d 886, 887 (2002) (a document is deemed filed for purposes of a limitation deadline on the day it is tendered to a prison official by a pro se prisoner). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for
 
reconsideration is dismissed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 24, 2012.
