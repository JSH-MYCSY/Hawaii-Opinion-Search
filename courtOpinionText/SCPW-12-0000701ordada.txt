Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(S.P.P.
 12-1-0003(2))
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of petitioner Richard Ruhâ€™s August 
8, 2012 petition for a writ of mandamus, the documents in support 
and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate a 
clear and indisputable right to relief and, therefore, is not 
entitled to mandamus relief. See Kema v. Gaddis,  91 Hawai 'i 200, 
204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner 
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack 
of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or 
obtain the requested action. Such writs are not intended to 
supersede the legal discretionary authority of the lower courts, 
nor are they intended to serve as legal remedies in lieu of 
normal appellate procedures). Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, August 23, 2012.
