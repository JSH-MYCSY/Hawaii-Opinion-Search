JUSTIN GONDA, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE GARY W.B. CHANG, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV.
 NO. 1CC12-1-000692)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Justin Gondaâ€™s August 
13, 2012 petition for a writ of mandamus, the documents in 
support and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to mandamus relief. See 
Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai
'i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 
(1999) (A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ mandamus without
 
payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, August 23, 2012.
