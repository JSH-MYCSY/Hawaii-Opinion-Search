THE HONORABLE VIRGINIA L. CRANDALL, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV.
 NO. 11-1-2228-09; S.P.P. NO. 11-1-0052)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS/PROHIBITION
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna,and Pollack, JJ.,
with Acoba, J., dissenting)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Edmund M. Abordo’s 
August 22, 2012 petition for a writ of mandamus/prohibition in 
which he seeks a writ (1) directing the Honorable Virginia Lea 
Crandall to recuse herself from Civil No. 11-1-2228-09, and 
2) expediting the case, and the record, it appears that, at this 
time, petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable 
right to relief and, therefore, mandamus relief is not warranted. 
See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai 'i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 
(1999) (A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and 
indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to 
redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action. Such writs are not intended to supersede the legal
 
discretionary authority of the lower courts, nor are they
 
intended to serve as legal remedies in lieu of normal appellate
 
procedures.). This court, however, is mindful that petitioner
 
may not have access to court rules and forms, which may make it
 
difficult for petitioner to conform to the circuit court’s minute
 
orders and, as a result, the circuit court should consider
 
setting the motion for hearing or non-hearing disposition, as the
 
court deems appropriate. Moreover, minute orders do not satisfy
 
the requirement of written orders disposing of motions. The
 
standard for mandamus relief not having been satisfied, however,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus/prohibition without payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus/prohibition is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, October 9, 2012.

DISSENT BY ACOBA, J.
 
I dissent inasmuch as I do not believe a motion for
 
summary judgment can be a non-hearing motion.
