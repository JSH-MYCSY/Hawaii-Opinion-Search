DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV.
 NO. 05-1-0249(3))
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Christopher
 
Grindling’s September 5, 2012 petition for a writ of mandamus,
 
the document attached thereto and submitted in support thereof,
 and the record, it appears that petitioner is seeking to enforce
 the April 3, 2012 order for habeas relief entered by the second
 circuit court in Grindling v. Hirayama et al., Civil No. 05-1­0249(3). At this time, mandamus relief is not warranted inasmuch
 as petitioner has not demonstrated that he has a clear and
 indisputable right to relief because petitioner may seek relief
 as appropriate in the circuit court. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91
 Hawai'i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is 
an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner 
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied without prejudice to petitioner seeking
 further relief in the pending circuit court case.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 8, 2012.
