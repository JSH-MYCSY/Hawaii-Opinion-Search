ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Clifton Hasegawa’s 
August 29, 2012 e-mail to the Chief Justice, which was filed as a 
petition for a writ of mandamus on September 19, 2012, and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to mandamus relief. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai
'i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 
338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that  will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and
 
indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to
 redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
 action). Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition is denied.
 IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that petitioner is directed to
 
comply with the applicable court rules for filing documents in
 this court. This court will not file any further documents
 submitted by petitioner by e-mail. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, October 5, 2012.
