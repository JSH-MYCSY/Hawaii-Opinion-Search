MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
TED SAKAI, INTERIM DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, STATE
OF HAWAI' I; SHARI KIMOTO; and JEANETTE BALTERO, Respondents. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.,
with  Acoba,  J.  dissenting)
 
Upon consideration of Michael C. Tierney’s September 
19, 2012 petition for a writ of mandamus and the document 
submitted in support thereof and attached thereto, it appears 
that petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable 
right to return to Hawai
'i to serve the remainder of his 
sentence. See Malahoff v. Saito, 111 Hawai' i 168, 191, 140 P.3d 
401, 424 (2006) (the term “shall” in a statute may be construed 
as directory rather than mandatory); Jack Endo Elec., Inc. v. 
Lear Siegler, Inc., 59 Haw. 612, 617, 585 P.2d 1265, 1269 (1978) 
(same). Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to mandamus 
relief. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 
338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to
 
redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
 
action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, October 9, 2012.

DISSENT BY ACOBA, J.
 
I dissent to the denial of Petitioner Michael C.
 
Tierney’s petition for a writ of mandamus (Petition). I would
 
require Respondents Ted Sakai, Director of the Department of
 
Public Safety (DPS), Shari Kimoto, the mainland branch manager
 
for DPS, and Jeanette Baltero, the contract monitor for DPS to
 
file an answer to the Petition.
