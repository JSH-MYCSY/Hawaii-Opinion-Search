ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the document submitted by
 
petitioners Edmund M. Abordo & Cedric Ah Sing entitled “Writ of
 
Mandamus/Prohibition in Separation of Petitioner-Appellant Cedric

 Reasons,” which was filed in this court on September 25, 2012,

 The petition identified the Honorable Richard K. Perkins, Judge of
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, State of Hawai' i as the respondent.
The petition, however, is directed against the Department of Public Safety,

they are incarcerated to work on legal matters they file jointly. Moreover, they fail to present any evidence that they are being prevented from working on their appeal in CAAP-12-0000615 or that they do not have other available alternatives. At this time, it appears that petitioners are not entitled to mandamus relief. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai
'i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) 
(A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action); see also Barnett v. Broderick, 84 Hawai
'i 109, 111, 929 P.2d 1359, 
1361 (1996) (Mandamus relief is available to compel an official to perform a duty allegedly owed to an individual only if the individual’s claim is clear and certain, the official’s duty is ministerial and so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt, and no other remedy is available). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ mandamus/prohibition
 without payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus/prohibition is denied without prejudice to petitioners
 seeking relief as appropriate in the circuit court.
