ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CASE NO. CE-05-781)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and Pollack, JJ., and
Circuit Judge Chang, in place of McKenna, J., recused)
 
On September 28, 2012, petitioner Hawai
'i State Teachers Association (“HSTA”) filed a petition for a writ of 
mandamus seeking an order directing the Hawai' i Labor Relations 
Board (“HLRB”) to issue an order or decision on its prohibited practice complaint and motion for interlocutory relief in Case No. CE-05-781. 
On October 19, 2012, this court (1) denied without
 
prejudice petitioner’s request for a decision on the prohibited
 practice complaint, and (2) ordered the HLRB and the other
 respondents to answer the petition with respect to petitioner’s
 request for a decision on the motion for interlocutory relief. 
The HLRB and the other respondents timely answered. 
Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of mandamus, the
 answers to the petition, the respective supporting documents, and
 the record, it appears that there is no rule or statute that
 delineates a specific time within which the HLRB must resolve the
 pending motion for interlocutory relief. Nevertheless, the HLRB
 has indicated that in exercising its discretion to manage its
 cases, it has “determined that it would be more efficient to
 direct its efforts to issue a final decision on the merits, which
 includes a discussion of the [m]otion for [i]nterlocutory
 [r]elief.” In light of the HLRB’s determination to consolidate
 its ruling on the motion for interlocutory relief with
 disposition of the merits of the prohibited practice complaint,
 the HLRB is subject to the promptness requirement set forth in
 
2
 HRS § 377-9(d) (Supp. 2011) with respect to the motion for
 
interlocutory relief. See HRS § 377-9(d) (“After the final
 
hearing, the board shall promptly make and file an order or
 decision, incorporating findings of fact upon all the issues
 involved in the controversy and the determination of the rights
 of the parties.”); see also HRS § 89-5(i)(10) (Supp. 2011) (the
 HLRB is required to “[e]xecute . . . its responsibilities in a
 timely manner”). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that as to the HSTA’s request for
 
a decision on its motion for interlocutory relief, the petition
 for a writ of mandamus is denied without prejudice.
