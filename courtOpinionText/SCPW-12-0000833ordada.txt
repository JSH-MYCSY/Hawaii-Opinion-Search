MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE RICHARD K. PERKINS, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(S.P.P.
 NO. 12-1-0011)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
On October 2, 2012, this court filed a document
 
entitled “Petition for Writ of Mandamus,” which was submitted by
 
petitioner Michael C. Tierney. Petitioner seeks an order from
 this court directing the Honorable Richard K. Perkins to conduct
 an evidentiary hearing and appoint counsel for him in S.P.P. No.
 12-1-0011. Based upon our review of the petition for a writ of
 mandamus, the document attached thereto and submitted in support
 thereof, and the record, it appears that at this time, petitioner
 fails to demonstrate that he has a clear and indisputable right
 to relief and lacks alternative means to obtain the requested
  relief. Therefore, although more than ninety (90) days have 
passed since the State of Hawai' i filed its answer to the Rule 40 
petition and petitioner filed his motion for the appointment of 
counsel, and although petitioner is entitled to a ruling thereon, he is not entitled to the mandamus relief requested. See Kema v. 
Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of 
mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 24, 2012.
