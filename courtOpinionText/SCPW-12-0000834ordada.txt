ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV.
 NO. 06-1-0302(1))
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Alaku Pointe, LPâ€™s
 
October 2, 2012, petition for a writ of mandamus, the documents
 
submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that
 petitioner is not entitled to mandamus relief inasmuch as
 petitioner can seek appellate review, as appropriate, once an
 appealable judgment is entered in the case. See State ex rel.
 
Marsland v. Ames, 71 Haw. 304, 306, 788 P.2d 1281, 1283 (1990) (A
 writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue
 unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right
 
to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately
 the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action. Such writs,
 however, are not intended to supersede the legal discretionary
 authority of the trial courts, nor are they intended to serve as
 legal remedies in lieu of normal appellate procedure. Moreover,
 where a trial judge has discretion to act, mandamus will not lie
 to interfere with or control the exercise of that discretion,
 even when the judge has acted erroneously, unless the judge has
 exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and
 manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject
 properly before the court under circumstances in which he or she
 has a legal duty to act). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, November 28, 2012.
