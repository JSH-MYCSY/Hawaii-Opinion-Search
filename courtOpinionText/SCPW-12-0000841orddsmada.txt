THE HONORABLE RHONDA A. NISHIMURA, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV. NO. 11-1-2008)
 
ORDER DISMISSING MOTION TO EXPEDITE RULING
 
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By:  Pollack,  J.)
 
Petitioner Richard Blaisdell submitted a motion to
 
expedite a ruling on his October 5, 2012 petition for a writ of
 
mandamus, which was filed on November 15, 2012. This court,
 however, disposed of the October 5, 2012 mandamus petition by
 order filed on November 15, 2012. Petitionerâ€™s request for an
 expedited ruling is therefore moot. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is dismissed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, November 16, 2012.
