IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
ELIZABETH FISHER,
Petitioner/Defendant,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE HILARY B. GANGNES, JUDGE OF THE DISTRICT COURT
OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, HONOLULU DIVISION, STATE OF HAWAI 'I,
Respondent,
 
and
 
LORNA SOUZA,
Respondent/Plaintiff. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV.
 NO. 1RC12-1-00925)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Elizabeth Fisher’s
 
October 16, 2012 petition for a writ of mandamus/prohibition and
 
request for an immediate temporary stay, the documents attached
 
thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it
 
appears that: (1) as to petitioner’s request for an order
 
directing the respondent judge to recuse herself from all further
 
matters in Civil No. 1RC12-1-00925, petitioner can seek
 appropriate relief in the district court and obtain appellate 
review; (2) as to petitioner’s request for an order directing the 
respondent judge to vacate the dismissal order and the sanction 
award, petitioner can obtain appellate review; and (3) as to 
petitioner’s request for an order directing the district court to 
vacate “re-setting” the trial date on Ho 'ohiki to October 18, 
2012, petitioner can obtain appellate review. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to mandamus relief. See Kema v. 
Gaddis, 91 Hawai
'i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (A 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue 
unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right 
to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately 
the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action. Such writs are 
not intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of 
the lower courts, nor are they intended to serve as legal 
remedies in lieu of normal appellate procedures.). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus/prohibition and request for an immediate temporary stay
 
is denied.
