NO. SCPW-12-0000894
 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAII, Respondent,
 
vs.
 
CHRISTOPHER LEE SLAVICK, Petitioner.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 04-1-1534)
 
ORDER DENYING WITHOUT
 
PREJUDICE PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Christopher Lee
 
Slavickâ€™s October 23, 2012 petition for a writ of prohibition,
 
and the record, it is unclear what specific relief petitioner is
 seeking from this court. Moreover, it appears that, at this
 time, petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable
 right to relief and a lack of alternative means to obtain relief.
 See Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580
 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (A writ of prohibition is an extraordinary
 remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a
 clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative
 means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the
 requested action. Such a writ is not intended to supersede the
 
legal discretionary authority of the trial courts, cure a mere
 legal error or serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal
 appellate procedure.). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
prohibition is denied without prejudice.
