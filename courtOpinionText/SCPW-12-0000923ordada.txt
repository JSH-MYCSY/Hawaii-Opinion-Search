BARBARA ELLEN SHERRILL,
Petitioner,

THE HONORABLE DERRICK H.M. CHAN,
Judge of the First Circuit Court, State of Hawai' i,
Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CAAP-12-0000676; PROBATE NO. 10-1-0254)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ., and
Circuit Judge Nacino, in place of Acoba, J., recused) 
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Barbara Ellen 
Sherrillâ€™s petition for a writ of mandamus, which was filed on 
October 29, 2012, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner has failed to demonstrate that she has a clear and indisputable right to the relief she seeks and a lack of alternative means to obtain such relief. 
Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to mandamus 
relief. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that
 
will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and
 indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to
 redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
 action. Such writs are not intended to supersede the legal
 discretionary authority of the lower courts, nor are they
 intended to serve as legal remedies in lieu of normal appellate
 procedure). Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, November 30, 2012.
