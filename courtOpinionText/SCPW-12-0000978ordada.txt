MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
SHERIFF'S DIVISION, DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC
SAFETY, STATE OF HAWAI 1I, Respondents. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Petitioner Michael C. Tierney submitted a petition for 
a writ of mandamus, which was filed on November 2, 2012. 
Petitioner seeks an order directing the sheriffs for the State of Hawai1i to transport him to court hearings in Cr. No. 1P108-6561 
and Cr. No. 08-1-0869. 
Although a criminal defendant generally has a right to
 
be present in the courtroom during proceedings in his or her
 case, this right is only guaranteed for proceedings that are
 critical to the outcome if the defendant’s presence would
 contribute to the fairness of the procedure. See Kentucky v.
 
Stincer, 482 U.S. 730, 856 (1987); Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291
 U.S. 97, 105-06 (1934), overruled in part on other grounds by
 Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1 (1964) (the right to be present
 extends to those proceedings at which the defendant’s “presence
 has a relation, reasonably substantial, to the fullness of his
 
opportunity to defend against the charge”). This right does not
 extend to purely procedural hearings. See United States v.
 
Gagnon, 470 U.S. 522, 526 (1985). 
Petitioner fails to demonstrate that he was excluded or 
will be excluded from any hearing that implicates his right to confront witnesses and/or defend against the charges against him. Moreover, petitioner has not demonstrated that there are hearings pending in Cr. No. 1P108-6561 or Cr. No. 08-1-0869 that implicate his constitutional right to be present. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to mandamus relief. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 
Hawai1i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is 
an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
