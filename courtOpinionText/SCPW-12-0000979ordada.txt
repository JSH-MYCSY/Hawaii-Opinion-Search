MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT,
HONOLULU DIVISION, STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael C. Tierney’s 
petition for a writ of mandamus, which was filed on November 2, 
2012, and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief. On October 25, 2012, the district court entered an order granting the State of Hawai' i’s request to nolle prosequi the case without 
prejudice. Mandamus relief, therefore, is not warranted. See 
Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 
(1999) (A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will 
1
 not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and
 
indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to
 redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
 action. Such writs are not intended to supersede the legal
 discretionary authority of the lower courts, nor are they
 intended to serve as legal remedies in lieu of normal appellate
 procedures). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
