IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT,
HONOLULU DIVISION, STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondents. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael C. Tierney’s
 
motion for reconsideration of the December 17, 2012 order denying
 
his petition for a writ of mandamus, which was electronically
 
filed by the appellate clerk on January 4, 2013, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for 
reconsideration is denied. As we stated in our December 17, 2012 
order, the district court entered an order granting the State of 
Hawai'i’s request to nolle prosequi the case without prejudice on 
October 25, 2012. The case, therefore, has been dismissed without prejudice. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, January 14, 2013.
