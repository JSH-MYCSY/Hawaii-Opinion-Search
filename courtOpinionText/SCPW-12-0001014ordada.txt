IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I 
MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
RANDALL HIRONAKA, Court-Appointed Attorney, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Michael C. Tierney’s 
petition for a writ of mandamus, which was filed on November 16, 
2012, and the record, it appears that petitioner is not entitled to mandamus relief inasmuch as (1) court-appointed counsel, Randall Hironaka, filed a motion to withdraw as counsel in Cr. No. 08-1-0869 on December 10, 2012, and (2) petitioner can seek the appointment of new counsel, as appropriate, in the circuit court. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 
338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; such writs are not intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the lower courts, nor are they
 
intended to serve as legal remedies in lieu of normal appellate
 procedures). Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is (1) denied as moot as to petitioner’s request for
 court-appointed counsel to file a motion to withdraw as counsel,
 and (2) denied as to petitioner’s request for the appointment of
 new counsel.
