KAWIKA KEOKI AKUI, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
TED SAKAI, DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC
SAFETY, STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon review of petitioner Kawika Keoki Akui’s “Motion
 
to Transfer Habeas Corpus”, filed on December 7, 2012, which we
 
treat as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and the record, 
it appears that petitioner can seek relief in the circuit court
 
and by way of appeal, as appropriate, and petitioner presents no
 
special reason for invoking the supreme court’s original
 
jurisdiction at this time. See Oili v. Chang, 57 Haw. 411, 412,
 
557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition is denied
 
without prejudice.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 23, 2013.
