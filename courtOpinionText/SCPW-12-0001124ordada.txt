IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent,
 
vs.
 
CHRISTOPHER LEE SLAVICK, Petitioner.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 04-1-1534)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Christopher Lee
 
Slavickâ€™s petition for a writ of prohibition, which was filed on
 
December 28, 2012, and the record, it appears that petitioner
 fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to the
 requested relief and a lack of alternative means to obtain such
 relief. See Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237,
 
241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of prohibition is an
 extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner
 demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack
 of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
 obtain the requested action; such a writ is not intended to
 supersede the legal discretionary authority of the trial courts,
 
cure a mere legal error or serve as a legal remedy in lieu of
 normal appellate procedure). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
prohibition is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 23, 2013.
