IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I 
IN RE RANDY HANOHANO
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
By letter dated November 17, 2012, which was filed as a 
petition for a writ of mandamus on December 31, 2012, petitioner 
Randy Hanohano asks this court to review his conviction for terroristic threatening and acquit him. Upon considering the request and the record, it appears that (1) the time to seek further review of the terroristic threatening conviction has passed, see HRAP Rule 40.1(1), and (2) this court does not have jurisdiction to acquit a defendant, see HRS ยง 602-5(a) (Supp. 2012). Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to mandamus relief. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 
338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
 
action). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a 
writ of mandamus is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 23, 2013.
