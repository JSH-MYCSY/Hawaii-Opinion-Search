IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
KALYN GOWAN, CORRINNA GOWAN, Petitioners,
 
vs.
 
JUDGE EDWARD KUBO, Circuit Court Judge
of the First Circuit, Respondent Judge, 
and 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 12-1-1189)
 
ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART
 
APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
On January 9, 2013, petitioners Kalyn Gowan (“Kalyn”)
 
and Corrinna Gowan (“Corrinna”) filed a petition for a writ of
 
mandamus directing the respondent judge to set aside their
 
convictions for summary contempt in Cr. No. 12-1-1189. Kalyn
 
also seeks an order directing the respondent judge to recuse
 
himself from presiding further over his criminal case.
 
By order entered on January 24, 2013, we directed the 
respondent judge and the respondent State of Hawai 'i (the 
“State”) to answer the petition. The respondent judge and the  State timely answered the petition. 
Upon consideration of the petition, the answers, the
 
respective supporting documents, and the record, we find that:
 
(1) As to Kalyn’s request for an order setting aside 
his conviction for summary contempt, it appears that the findings 
and conclusions set forth in the January 16, 2013 “Order Finding 
Defendant in Contempt of Court Under 710-1077(1)(a) and (3)(a) 
Hawai[ ']i Revised Statutes” are inconsistent and not supported by 
the record. For example, the order states that Kalyn was given “every opportunity to justify himself in this case, and he did 
not produce any justification or mitigating facts to support his 
disrespectful statement made to the Court.” The record, however, 
does not support this statement. Nevertheless, at a December 17, 
2012 hearing, Kalyn apologized to the respondent judge and the 
respondent judge ruled that he would take no further action on 
his contempt conviction. 
(2) As to Corrinna’s request for an order setting
 
aside her conviction for summary contempt, it appears that the
 
circuit court had jurisdiction over Corrinna, see Peterson v.
 
Highland Music, 140 F.3d 1313, 1323 (9th Cir. 1998) (the court’s
 
contempt power extends to a non-party who either aids a party in
 
violating a court order or is legally identified with a party and
 
has notice of the order); Washington v. Washington State
 
Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Ass’n, 443 U.S. 658, 692 n.32
 
(1979) (anyone who takes steps deliberately to thwart the
 
enforcement of a judicial decree can be hauled into court and
 
dealt with summarily, even though he or she is not named in the
 
2
 decree, acting in concert with someone that is, or violating any
 
source of legal obligations other than the decree itself), but
 
should have addressed her alleged contemptuous conduct as
 
indirect constructive criminal contempt. Based on the record,
 
Corrinna’s alleged contemptuous conduct was committed outside the
 
court’s view and the court lacked knowledge of all of the facts
 
constituting the alleged offense. Corrinna’s conduct, therefore,
 
cannot constitute summary contempt and must be charged as
 
indirect constructive criminal contempt, which can only be
 
adjudicated by notice, a hearing, and other procedural
 
safeguards. See HRS § 710-1077(3)(b) (1993). In addition, for
 
indirect constructive criminal contempt, the hearing must be
 before a different judge. See State v. Brown, 70 Haw. 459, 467,
 
776 P.2d 1182, 1187-88 (1989). 
(3) As to Kalyn’s request for the disqualification of 
the respondent judge, mandamus relief is not warranted. Adjudication of a motion to disqualify a judge is a discretionary 
matter and Kalyn can seek further review of the denial of his 
motions to disqualify by way of an appeal from a final judgment 
entered in the case. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai
'i 200, 204, 
982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a 
clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative 
means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the 
requested action; such a writ is not intended to supersede the 
legal discretionary authority of the trial courts, cure a mere 
legal error or serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal 
3
 appellate procedure); Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw.
 
237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (same). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for a writ of
 
mandamus is granted in part and denied in part, as follows:
 
A. As to Kalyn, his request for mandamus relief is 
granted to the extent that the “Order Finding Defendant in 
Contempt of Court Under 710-1077(1)(a) and (3)(a) Hawai[ ']i 
Revised Statutes”, filed on January 16, 2013, is vacated. Because the respondent judge has indicated that he would take no 
further action on Kalyn’s contempt conviction after Kalyn 
apologized, no further proceedings on the contempt matter are 
necessary in the trial court. Kalyn’s request for an order 
directing the respondent judge to recuse himself from further 
presiding over his criminal case is denied. 
B. As to Corrinna, her request for mandamus relief is 
granted to the extent that the “Order Finding Corrin[n]a Gowan in 
Contempt of Court Under 710-1077(1)(g) and (3)(a) Hawai[
']i 
Revised Statutes”, filed on January 10, 2013, is vacated and the matter is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this 
order. The subsequent proceedings, if any, must be before a 
different judge.
