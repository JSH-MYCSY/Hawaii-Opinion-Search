ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR 
WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Francis Grandinetti’s
 
“Supervisory Habeas Corpus and Writ of Mandamus Petition: Texas
 
Arrest”, which was filed on January 10, 2013, and which we review
 as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a writ of mandamus,
 the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof,
 and the record, it is unclear what specific relief petitioner
 seeks by way of his petition. Nevertheless, petitioner presents
 no special reason for invoking the supreme court’s original
 jurisdiction, see Oili v. Chang, 57 Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 
788 (1976) (the supreme court “will not exercise its original jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings when relief is available in a lower court and no special reason exists for invoking its jurisdiction”), and fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief, see Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai
'i 200, 
204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of habeas corpus and
 a writ of mandamus without payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that the petition is 
denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, February 6, 2013.
