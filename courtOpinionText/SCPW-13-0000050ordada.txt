RICHARD RUH, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CAAP-12-0001021; S.P.P. NO. 12-1-0003(2))
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Richard Ruhâ€™s petition
 
for a writ of mandamus, which was filed on January 28, 2013, the
 
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
 the record, it appears that petitioner does not have a clear and
 indisputable right to the appointment of counsel for an appeal in
 a post-conviction proceeding. Moreover, petitioner fails to
 demonstrate that the ICA exceeded its jurisdiction in denying his
 request for the appointment of counsel, committed a flagrant and
 manifest abuse of discretion in doing so, or has refused to act
 on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in
 which the court has a legal duty to act. Petitioner, therefore,
 is not entitled to a writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 
Hawai'i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of 
mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless 
the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; where a court has discretion to act, mandamus will not lie to interfere with or control the exercise of that discretion, even when the court has acted erroneously, unless the court has exceeded its jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in which it has a legal duty to act). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a
 
writ of mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, February 14, 2013.
