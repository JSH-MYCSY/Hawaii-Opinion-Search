IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
CLYDE MITSURU HAYAKAWA, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(S.P.P. NO. 11-1-0033; CR. NO. 08-1-1927)
 
ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE 
PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
 
(
By:  Recktenwald,  C.J.,  Nakayama,  Acoba,  McKenna,  and  Pollack,  JJ.)
 
Upon review of petitioner Clyde Mitsuru Hayakawa’s
 
document entitled “Habeas Corpus”, filed on January 29, 2013,
 
which we treat as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and the
 record, it appears that the relief sought by petitioner is not
 the appropriate subject of a petition for a writ of habeas
 corpus. Petitioner has alternative forums within which to seek
 relief and fails to present any special reason for invoking the
 supreme court’s original jurisdiction. See Oili v. Chang
, 57
 
Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976) (the supreme court “will
 not exercise its original jurisdiction in habeas corpus
 proceedings when relief is available in a lower court and no
 special reason exists for invoking its jurisdiction”). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of habeas
 
corpus is denied without prejudice to any filings, as
 appropriate, in circuit court.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, February 25, 2013.
