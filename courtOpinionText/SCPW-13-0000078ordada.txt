IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE RICHARD K. PERKINS, Judge of the Circuit Court
of the First Circuit, State of Hawai 'i, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(S.P.P.
 No. 12-1-0011) 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael C. Tierneyâ€™s 
petition for a writ of mandamus, which was filed on February 7, 
2013, and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief. See HRPP 
40(f) and (i). Although petitioner is entitled to a timely ruling on his Rule 40 petition, he is not entitled to the mandamus relief requested at this time. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 
Hawai
'i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is 
an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
 
obtain the requested action). 
Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, March 4, 2013.  
/s/ Mark E. Recktenwald /s/ Paula A. Nakayama /s/ Simeon R. Acoba, Jr. /s/ Sabrina S. McKenna
