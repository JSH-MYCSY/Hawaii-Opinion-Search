ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Petitioner Francis Grandinetti submitted two documents,
 
which were filed on February 8, 2013: (1) “Supervisory Habeas
 
Corpus and Writ of Mandamus Petition: Texas Arrest”; and 
(2) “Intervening Injunction Application and Petition”. Upon consideration of the documents, which we review as petitions for a writ of habeas corpus and/or a writ of mandamus, it appears that petitioner presents no special reason for invoking the supreme court’s original jurisdiction, see Oili v. Chang, 57 Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976) (the supreme court “will not exercise its original jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings when relief is available in a lower court and no special reason exists for invoking its jurisdiction”), and fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to any relief, see Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai
'i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus 
is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petitions without payment of the filing
 fee.
 IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petitions are
 
denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, March 6, 2013.
