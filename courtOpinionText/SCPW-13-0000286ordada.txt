IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent,
 
vs.
 
CHRIS SLAVICK, Petitioner.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(Cr. No. 04-1-001534)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Christopher Lee
 
Slavick’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which was filed
 
on March 27, 2013, and the record, it appears that habeas corpus
 
relief is available to petitioner in the circuit court and
 
petitioner presents no special reason for invoking the supreme
 
court’s original jurisdiction. See Oili v. Chang, 57 Haw. 411,
 
412, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, May 8, 2013.
