ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV.
 NO. 11-1-0520-03)
 
ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Nakayama, Acting C.J., Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ., and
Circuit Judge Kubo, in place of Recktenwald, C.J., recused)
 
Upon consideration of the March 27, 2013 petition for a
 
writ of mandamus filed by petitioners Linda N. Guerra, Carrie Y.
 
Kawamoto, and Violet M. Anderson, as the Personal Representatives
 
of the Estate of Peggy Fujiko Yen, the May 2, 2013 oral
 
representation from petitioners’ counsel that the foreclosure
 action settled but the settlement needs to be approved by the
      probate court, the May 2, 2013 oral request from petitioners’
 
counsel that the court refrain from acting on the mandamus
 
petition pending the probate court’s approval of the settlement,
 
the July 19, 2013 order to show cause why the petition should not
 
be dismissed, and the August 2, 2013 response to the order to
 
show cause filed by petitioners, it appears that the mandamus
 
petition has been pending for more than four months and although
 
petitioners have recently submitted a petition for approval to
 
the probate court, the parties are still negotiating the terms of
 
the form of the written settlement agreement and a specific time
 
period for the underlying matter to be completely resolved is
 
uncertain. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is dismissed without prejudice.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, August 22, 2013.
