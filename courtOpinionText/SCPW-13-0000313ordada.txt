ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(T.A. No. 11-1-0021)
 
ORDER DENYING MOTION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the Petitioners’ April 19, 2013
 
submission in support of its March 28, 2013 Petition for a Writ
 of Mandamus – which this court characterizes as a motion to amend
 the March 28, 2013 Petition – the exhibits appended thereto, and
 the record, it appears the Petitioners, in addition to
  reiterating a previous request for this court to stay the
 
provisions of HRS § 235-114 (Supp. 2010), which this court
 declined to do by way of its April 22, 2013 order denying the
 original Petition, also request this court to “clarify or
 confirm” whether the February 8, 2013 order of the Tax Appeal
 Court and the April 1, 2013 denial of the Petitioner’s motion for
 reconsideration of the February 8, 2013 order are final,
 appealable orders. However, it is premature for this court to
 opine on the appealability of the orders before an appeal is
 brought, and this court declines to issue an advisory opinion. 
See Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. Housing and Cmty. Dev. Corp. Of 
Hawai
'i, 121 Hawai 'i 324, 339 n. 13, 219 P. 3d 1111, 1126 n. 13 
(2009) (advisory opinions are “impermissible”); State v. Lo, 116 
Hawai'i 23, 25-26, 169 P.3d 975, 977-78 (2007) (“Thus, this court 
must determine at the outset whether a mandamus petitioner may 
have a remedy by way of appeal or any other means of relief from 
the trial court’s action.”); Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai 'i 200, 204, 
982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary 
remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; such writs are not intended to supercede the legal discretionary authority of the lower courts, nor are they intended to serve as legal remedies in lieu of normal appellate 
2
 procedures). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Petitioners’ April 19,
 
2013 motion is denied on its merits.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, May 2, 2013.
