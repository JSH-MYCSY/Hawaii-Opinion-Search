MONTY V. RIDEOUT, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(S.P.P.
 No. 13-1-001K)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon review of petitioner Monty V. Rideout’s “Motion
 
for Release Under H.R.A.P. Rule 23(b) Pursuant to Pending Rule 40
 
SSP 13-1-001K”, which was filed on April 5, 2013, and which we
 treat as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the supporting
 and supplemental documents, and the record, it appears that
 petitioner, who is currently seeking post-conviction relief in
 the circuit court, can seek habeas relief in the circuit court
 and presents no special reason for the supreme court to invoke
 its original jurisdiction at this time. See Oili v. Chang, 57
 
Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976). Moreover, petitioner
 fails to demonstrate that his release from custody pending the
 disposition of his post-conviction proceeding is fitting under
 
the circumstances. See HRAP Rule 23(b). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
habeas corpus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, May 24, 2013.
