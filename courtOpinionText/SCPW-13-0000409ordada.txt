IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
ANTHONY BENITEZ, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(Cr. No. 11-1-1004)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR RELIEF
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Anthony Benitez, also 
known as Anthony Richardsonâ€™s petition for relief, which was 
filed on April 12, 2013, and which we review as a petition for a 
writ of mandamus, it appears that petitioner does not have a 
clear and indisputable right to an immediate review of the 
incarceration process and petitioner has alternative means to 
seek relief. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai 'i 200, 204-05, 982 
P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a 
clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative 
means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the 
requested action). Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for relief without payment of
 
the filing fee.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for 
relief is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, April 26, 2013.
