IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
GERALD VILLANUEVA, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Gerald Villanueva’s 
“Declaration of Independence of 1776 Oath of Allegiance to the 
Republic of Hawai[ ']i”, which was filed on May 3, 2013, and which 
we review as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the supporting documents and the record, it appears that habeas corpus relief is available to petitioner in the circuit court and petitioner presents no special reason for the supreme court to invoke its original jurisdiction at this time. See Oili v. 
Chang, 57 Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate court
 
shall process the petition for a writ of habeas corpus without
 payment of the filing fee.
 IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
habeas corpus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, June 28, 2013.
