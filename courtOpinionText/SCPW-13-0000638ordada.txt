IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
GERALD VILLANUEVA, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Gerald Villanueva’s
 
“Motion for Writ of Habeas Corpus”, which was filed on May 3,
 
2013, the supporting documents and the record, it appears that
 
habeas corpus relief is available to petitioner in the circuit
 
court and petitioner presents no special reason for the supreme
 
court to invoke its original jurisdiction at this time. See Oili
 
v. Chang, 57 Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976). 
Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the motion for a writ of habeas corpus
 
without payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the motion for a writ 
of habeas corpus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, June 28, 2013.
