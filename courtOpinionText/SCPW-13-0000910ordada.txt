HERMAN LEE KAOPUA, SR., Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 01-1-0185; NO. 25009; S.P.P. NO. 06-1-0001;
NO. 28907; S.P.P. NO. 09-1-0007; NO. 30079)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Herman-Lee Kaopua, 
Sr.â€™s petition for a writ of mandamus, the documents attached 
thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that he has a clear and indisputable right to void his conviction and sentence or that he lacks alternative means to seek relief. See Kema v. 
Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of 
mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appellate court shall
 
process the petition for a writ of mandamus without payment of
 
the filing fee.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a
 
writ of mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, June 18, 2013. 
/s/ Mark E. Recktenwald /s/ Paula A. Nakayama /s/ Simeon R. Acoba, Jr. /s/ Sabrina S. McKenna /s/ Richard W. Pollack
