STEPHANIE S.O. TIM SING,
Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE EDWIN C. NACINO, JUDGE OF THE FIRST
CIRCUIT COURT, STATE OF HAWAI 'I; DEPARTMENT OF LAND AND
NATURAL RESOURCES, STATE OF HAWAI 'I,
Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV. NO. 12-1-2216)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Stephanie S.O. Tim 
Singâ€™s petition for a writ of mandamus, the documents attached 
thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that the remedy petitioner is seeking is not appropriate by way of a petition for a writ of mandamus and petitioner has alternative means to address the alleged wrong. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to mandamus relief. See Kema v. 
Gaddis, 91 Hawai
'i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless
 
the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to
 relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the
 alleged wrong or obtain the requested action); Honolulu
 Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62
 (1978) (a writ of mandamus is not intended to supersede the legal
 discretionary authority of the trial courts, cure a mere legal
 error or serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate
 procedure; rather, it is meant to restrain a judge of an inferior
 court from acting beyond or in excess of his or her
 jurisdiction). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
