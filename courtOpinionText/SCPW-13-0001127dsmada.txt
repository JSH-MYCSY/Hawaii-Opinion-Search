IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent,
 
vs.
 
CHRIS SLAVICK, Petitioner.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DISMISSING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Christopher Lee 
Slavick’s letter to the court dated March 18, 2013, which was 
electronically filed on March 27, 2013, and which we review as a motion for reconsideration of the January 23, 2013 order denying without prejudice the motion for habeas corpus, and the record, it appears that the request for reconsideration is untimely. See 
HRAP 40(a) (“A motion for reconsideration may be filed by a party only within 10 days after the filing of the opinion, dispositional order, or ruling unless by special leave additional time is granted during such period by a judge or justice of the appellate court involved.”); see also Setala v. J.C. Penney Co., 97 Hawai' i 484, 485, 40 P.3d 886, 887 (2002) (a document is deemed filed for purposes of a limitation deadline on the day it
 
is tendered to a prison official by a pro se prisoner). 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for
 
reconsideration is dismissed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, April 3, 2013. 
/s/ Mark E. Recktenwald /s/ Paula A. Nakayama /s/ Simeon R. Acoba, Jr. /s/ Sabrina S. McKenna /s/ Richard W. Pollack
