IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent,
 
vs.
 
CHRIS SLAVICK, Petitioner.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE MOTION FOR HABEAS CORPUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Christopher Lee
 
Slavick’s “Motion for Habeas Corpus”, which was filed on January
 
2, 2013, the document attached thereto and submitted in support
 
thereof, and the record, it appears that habeas corpus relief is
 
available to petitioner in the circuit court and petitioner
 
presents no special reason for invoking the supreme court’s
 
original jurisdiction. See Oili v. Chang, 57 Haw. 411, 412, 557
 
P.2d 787, 788 (1976). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for habeas corpus
 
is denied without prejudice to seeking habeas corpus relief in
 the circuit court pursuant to HRS § 660-3 (1993).
 
DATED: 
Honolulu, Hawai 'i, January 23, 2013.
