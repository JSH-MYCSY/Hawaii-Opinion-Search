IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent,
 
vs.
 
CHRIS SLAVICK, Petitioner.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(Cr. No. 04-1-001534)
 
ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE MOTION FOR HABEAS CORPUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Christopher Lee
 
Slavick’s “Motion for Habeas Corpus 660-7”, which was filed on
 
May 29, 2013, and the record, it appears that petitioner has
 alternative means to seek habeas corpus relief and presents no
 special reason for invoking the supreme court’s original
 jurisdiction. See Oili v. Chang, 57 Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787,
 
788 (1976). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the motion for habeas corpus without payment
 of the filing fee. 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the motion for habeas
 
corpus is denied without prejudice. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, June 12, 2013.
