IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
KAPONO KANIELA TUMALE, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
Acting in Their Official Capacity as Agents of the
State of Hawai 'i, KEITH TAGUMA, LYLE KEANINI, LAWRENCE
TILLEY, JOHN KIM, DAVID LOUIE, ADRIANNE HEELY, and Appellate
Judges FUJISE, REIFURTH, and GINOZA, Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Kapono Kaniela
 
Tumaleâ€™s petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on January 3,
 
2013, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support
 
thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner is not
 
entitled to mandamus relief. Petitioner does not have a clear
 
and indisputable right to proceed with his appeal without paying
 
the required filing fee. See HRAP Rule 24. Moreover, petitioner
 
fails to demonstrate that the ICA judges exceeded their
 jurisdiction in denying his motion to proceed in forma pauperis
 
and dismissing his appeal for failing to pay the filing fee, that
 
the ICA judges committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of
 
discretion in doing so, or that the ICA judges have refused to
 act on a subject properly before them under circumstances in 
which they have a legal duty to act. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 
Hawai'i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of 
mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless 
the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to 
relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the 
alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; where a court has 
discretion to act, mandamus will not lie to interfere with or 
control the exercise of that discretion, even when the judge has 
acted erroneously, unless the judge has exceeded his or her 
jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of 
discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before 
the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty 
to act). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ mandamus without
 
payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a
 
writ of mandamus is denied.
