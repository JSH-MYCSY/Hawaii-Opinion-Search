CHARLES KAOHU, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 03-1-164)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Charles Kaohuâ€™s
 
petition for a writ of habeas corpus, filed on May 30, 2013, and
 
the record, it appears that habeas corpus relief is available to
 petitioner in the circuit court and petitioner presents no
 special reason for the supreme court to invoke its original
 jurisdiction at this time. See Oili v. Chang, 57 Haw. 411, 412,
 
557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976). Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
habeas corpus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, June 26, 2013.
