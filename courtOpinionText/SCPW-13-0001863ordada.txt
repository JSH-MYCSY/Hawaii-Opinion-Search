IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent,
 
vs.
 
RANDY HANOHANO, Petitioner.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 09-1-0082)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Randy Hanohanoâ€™s June
 
21, 2013 letter to the Honorable Richard W. Pollack, which we
 
filed and review as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and
 the record, it appears that the time to seek further review of
 the terroristic threatening convictions has passed. See HRAP
 
Rule 40.1(a)(1). To the extent petitioner alleges that his
 imprisonment is unlawful, petitioner can seek habeas corpus
 relief in the circuit court and does not present any special
 reason for the supreme court to invoke its original jurisdiction
 at this time. See Oili v. Chang, 57 Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787,
 
788 (1976). Accordingly,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of habeas corpus
 
without payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a 
writ of habeas corpus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, July 15, 2013.
