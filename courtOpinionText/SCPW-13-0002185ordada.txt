IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
WILLARD MAX IMAMOTO, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE RHONDA A. NISHIMURA,
Judge of the Circuit Court, First Circuit, Respondent Judge.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV. NO. 12-1-2761-11)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the document submitted by
 
petitioner Willard Max Imamoto entitled “Petitioner Willard Max
 
Imamoto’s Urgent Request to the Chief Justice of the Supreme
 Court with Extreme Violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct
 that has Entered into Aiding and Abetting Criminal Activity in
 the Circuit Court”, which was filed as a petition for a writ of
 mandamus on July 22, 2013, the documents attached thereto and
 submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that
 petitioner has alternative means to seek relief from the circuit
 court’s April 30, 2013 vexatious litigant order. Petitioner,
 therefore, is not entitled to mandamus relief. See Kema v.
  Gaddis, 91 Hawai 'i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue 
unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; where a court has discretion to act, mandamus will not lie to interfere with or control the exercise of that discretion, even when the judge has acted erroneously, unless the judge has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty to act). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a
 
writ of mandamus is denied.
