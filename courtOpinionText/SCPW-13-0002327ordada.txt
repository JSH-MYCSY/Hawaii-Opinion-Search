IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
GERALD VILLANUEVA, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
  
(CR. No. 96-0078, No. 20220)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
On July 24, 2013, the court received a document
 
submitted by petitioner Gerald Villanueva entitled “Newly
 
Discovered Evidence Pursuant to HRAP Rule 27(c)” in which
 petitioner asks the court to fix or correct his sentence. The
 caption of the document references Appeal No. 20220, which is
 closed, and, therefore, the document was filed as a petition for
 a writ of mandamus on July 24, 2014. Upon consideration of the
 petition, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support
 thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner is seeking
 similar relief in CAAP-13-0001903 and can raise the issues he
 presents here in the pending appeal. Petitioner, therefore, is
 not entitled to mandamus relief. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai 'i 
200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an 
extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appellate clerk shall
 
process the petition for a writ of mandamus without payment of
 the filing fee.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a
 
writ of mandamus is denied.
 
IT IS HEREBY FINALLY ORDERED that the appellate clerk
 
is directed not to accept any filings in Appeal No. 20220, which
 is closed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, August 8, 2013.
