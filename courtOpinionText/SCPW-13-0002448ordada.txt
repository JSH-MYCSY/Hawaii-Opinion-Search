ORDER DENYING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Francis M. Shyanguya's 
application for a writ of mandamus, filed on July 30, 2013, the 
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and 
the record, it appears that petitioner does not have a clear and 
indisputable right to the entry of findings of fact and 
conclusions of law in a decision from an agency appeal and has 
alternative means to seek relief. Petitioner, therefore, is not 
entitled to a writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai 'i 
200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an      extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner
 
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack
 
of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
 
obtain the requested action). Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, August 22, 2013.
