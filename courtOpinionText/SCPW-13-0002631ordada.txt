ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioners City and County of 
Honolulu and Nathan Evans’ petition for a writ of mandamus, filed 
on August 7, 2013, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioners do not have a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief and can seek appellate review of the November 7, 2012 summary judgment order once final judgment is entered in the case. Petitioners, therefore, are not entitled to a writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai
'i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that
 
will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and
 indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to
 redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
 action); Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241,
 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of mandamus is not intended to
 supersede the legal discretionary authority of the trial courts,
 cure a mere legal error or serve as a legal remedy in lieu of
 normal appellate procedure; rather, it is meant to restrain a
 judge of an inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of his
 or her jurisdiction); HRS § 641-1(b) (1993) (“The refusal of the
 circuit court to allow an appeal from an interlocutory judgment,
 order, or decree shall not be reviewable by any other court.”). 
Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
