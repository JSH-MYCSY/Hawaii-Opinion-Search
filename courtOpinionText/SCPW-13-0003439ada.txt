DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI' I,
Respondent.

ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
By letter to the Chief Justice, which was filed as a
 
petition for a writ of mandamus, petitioner James P. Calzetta
 
appears to be challenging a 2010 order declaring him a vexatious
 litigant, and asks the court to “restore [his] access to the
 courts.” Upon consideration of the petition, the documents
 submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that
 petitioner is not entitled to the requested relief. Petitioner
 fails to demonstrate that he is being denied the opportunity to
 seek court approval to file a new case or that he attempted to
 file a new case and was denied the opportunity. Under these
 circumstances, the extraordinary remedy of a writ of mandamus is
 not warranted. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 
334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy 
that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action); Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of mandamus is not intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the trial courts, cure a mere legal error, or serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedure; rather, it is meant to restrain a judge of an inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of his or her jurisdiction). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, November 27, 2013.
