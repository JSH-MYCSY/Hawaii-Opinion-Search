IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
RICHARD BLAISDELL, Petitioner,
 
vs.

Circuit Court of the First Circuit,
State of Hawai 'i, Respondent Judge,
 
and
 
 
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV.
 NO. 11-1-2008-09)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Richard Blaisdellâ€™s 
petition for a writ of mandamus directed to a judge, which was 
filed on September 24, 2013, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner can seek relief, as appropriate, in the circuit court and by way of an appeal from a final judgment. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai
'i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will
 
not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and
 indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to
 redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
 action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, October 7, 2013.
