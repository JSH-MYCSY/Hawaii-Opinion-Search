vs.

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER GRANTING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioners Allure Waikiki 
Marketing, LLC (“Allure Waikiki”) and Kalakaua Relief Line, LLC’s 
(“KRL”) petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on October 23, 2013, respondents State of Hawai
'i Department of Commerce and 
Consumer Affairs (“DCCA”) and DCCA Director Keali 'i S. Lopez’s 
answer to the petition, filed on December 20, 2013, and respondents’ subsequent response clarifying their position, filed on December 26, 2013, petitioners’ stipulation and order, filed on December 17, 2013, the respective supporting documents, and the record, it appears that: (1) On or about March 4, 2013, Steven D. Fifield, the 
manager of KRL’s former member and former manager, FRC Waikiki, 
LLC, filed Articles of Termination for KRL with the DCCA pursuant to Hawai
'i’s Uniform Limited Liability Company Act, which is 
promulgated under HRS ch. 428, without authority to file such document; 
(2) Once the Articles of Termination were filed, the
 
DCCA considered KRL to be terminated and no longer an existing
 LLC; 
(3) The DCCA lacks specific statutory authority to
 
reinstate a LLC that was terminated by the filing of a Articles
 of Termination and will not reinstate such a LLC absent court
 order;
 
(4) Respondents are agreeable to reinstating KRL as a
 
LLC retroactively to March 4, 2013, but reserve the right to
 object to and submit legal arguments against similar petitions
 filed in the future concerning the reinstatement of a terminated
 LLC or any other challenges to their filing duty and procedure
 under HRS ch. 428; and
 
(5) The parties agree that they will be responsible
 
for their own attorneys’ fees and costs.
 
Under the specific facts and circumstances presented in
 
this proceeding, and the DCCA and Lopez’s position with respect
 to KRL’s reinstatement as a LLC, a writ of mandamus is warranted
 at this time. Accordingly, 
2
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is granted to the extent that respondents are directed
 
to reinstate KRL as a LLC retroactively to March 4, 2013. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, February 12, 2014.
