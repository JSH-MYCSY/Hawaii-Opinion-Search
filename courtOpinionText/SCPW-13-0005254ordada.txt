ORIGINAL PROCEEDING

 NO. 13-1-1809-06)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION
 
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioners Richard Lee and Lily
 
Tai Nomura’s petition for a writ of prohibition, filed on
 
November 14, 2013, the documents submitted in support thereof,
 and the record, it appears that there are alternative means to
 seek the relief requested in the petition and petitioners fail to
 
demonstrate that the respondent judge has acted beyond or in
 excess of her jurisdiction in presiding over the underlying case. 
Petitioners, therefore, are not entitled to the extraordinary
 remedy of a writ of prohibition. See Honolulu Adv., Inc. v.
 
Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of
 prohibition “is an extraordinary remedy . . . to restrain a judge
 of an inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of his
 jurisdiction”); Gannett Pac. Corp. v. Richardson, 59 Haw. 224,
 226, 580 P.2d 49, 53 (1978) (a writ of prohibition is not meant
 to serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate
 procedures; rather, it is available in “rare and exigent
 circumstances” where “allow[ing] the matter to wend its way
 through the appellate process would not be in the public interest
 and would work upon the public irreparable harm”).
 Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
prohibition is denied.
