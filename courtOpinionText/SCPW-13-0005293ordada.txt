ORDER DENYING AS MOOT APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Christopher Lee

15, 2013, the respondent judge’s answer to the application for a writ of mandamus, filed on February 3, 2014, the State of Hawai
'i’s answer to the application for a writ of mandamus, filed 
on February 4, 2014, the respective supporting documents, and the record, it appears that on January 23, 2014, the respondent judge filed an amended summary judgment of conviction and sentence and
 
an amended mittimus (warrant of commitment to jail) to include
 the circumstances of the offense in which the respondent judge
 found petitioner guilty of summary contempt of court. See HRS §
 
710-1077(5) (“Whenever a person is convicted of criminal contempt
 of court or sentenced therefor, the particular circumstances of
 the offense shall be set forth in the judgment and in the order
 or warrant of commitment.”) Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied as moot.
