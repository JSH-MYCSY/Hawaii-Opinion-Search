IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent,
 
vs.
 
DeWITT LONG, Petitioner.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 12-1-1613)
 
ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE 
PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner DeWitt Long’s petition
 
for a writ of habeas corpus, filed on November 25, 2013, the
 
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
 the record, it appears that petitioner has alternative means to
 seek relief and presents no special reason for this court to
 invoke its jurisdiction at this time. See Oili v. Chang, 57 Haw.
 
411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976) (the supreme court “will not
 exercise its original jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings
 when relief is available in a lower court and no special reason
 exists for invoking its jurisdiction”). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
habeas corpus is denied without prejudice.  
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, February 13, 2014.
