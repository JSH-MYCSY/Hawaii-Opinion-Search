IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
JOHN DeCAMBRA, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
DIRECTOR TED SAKAI, DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC
SAFETY, STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.,
and Circuit Judge Ochiai, in place of Acoba, J., recused.) 
 
Upon consideration of petitioner John DeCambra’s “Writ
 
of Habeas Corpus”, filed on November 25, 2013, which we review as
 
a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the respondent Director
 of the Department of Public Safety’s answer to the petition for a
 writ of habeas corpus, filed on March 27, 2014, the respective
 supporting documents submitted thereto, and the record, it
 appears that respondent’s actions do not amount to a deliberate
 indifference to petitioner’s medical need. 
Petitioner,
 
therefore, is not entitled to the requested habeas corpus relief. 
See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104-05 (1976) (to establish a
 constitutional claim under the Eighth Amendment predicated upon
 the failure to provide medical treatment, an inmate must show 
(1) a “serious medical need” by demonstrating that failure to
 
treat the condition could result in further significant injury or
 the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain, and (2) the prison
 official’s response to the medical need was deliberately
 indifferent to the prisoner’s medical need); Farmer v. Brennan,
 511 U.S. 825, 847 (1994) (deliberate indifference exists when a
 prison official knows an inmate faces a substantial risk of
 serious harm to his health and fails to take reasonable measures
 to abate the risk); Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1131 (9th Cir.
 2000) (deliberate indifference is shown by a purposeful act or
 failure to respond to a prisoner’s pain or possible medical need,
 and harm caused by the indifference). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
habeas corpus is denied.
