ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 06-1-0570(1))
 
ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE
  
PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
  
Upon consideration of petitioner David T. Flemingâ€™s
 
petition for a writ of habeas corpus, filed on November 27, 2013,
 
the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof,
 and the record, it appears that petitioner is seeking similar
 relief pursuant to a petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on
 October 15, 2013, in SCPW-13-0004021. The court, therefore, can
 address the issues raised in the petition for a writ of habeas
 corpus together with the issues raised in the petition for a writ
 of mandamus. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
habeas corpus is denied without prejudice to the court reviewing
 
the issues in conjunction with the petition for a writ of
 mandamus.
