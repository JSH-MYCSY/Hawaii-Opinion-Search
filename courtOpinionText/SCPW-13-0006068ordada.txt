'I
 
CONTINENTAL PACIFIC, LLC by their Managing Agent, ELITE
PACIFIC PROPERTIES, LLC, Respondent,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE BARBARA RICHARDSON, JUDGE OF THE
DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, Respondent Judge, 
and
 
JOHN WESLEY ERRETT and KAY ANNE KROEHLER, Petitioners.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV.
 NO. 1RC13-1-6195)
 
ORDER (1) DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS,
AND (2) DENYING AS MOOT EX PARTE MOTION TO
SHORTEN TIME TO HEAR THE WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
On December 12, 2013, petitioners John Wesley Errett
 
and Kaye Anne Kroehler filed two documents in this court – 
(1) “Issuance of Writ of Mandamus to Judge Barbara Richardson to
 
Stay Destruction of Video Tape Evidence of Alleged Feloneous
 
Conduct”, and (2) “Ex Parte Motion to Shorten Time to Hear the
 
Writ of Mandamus”.
 
Upon consideration of the document entitled “Issuance
 
of Writ of Mandamus to Judge Barbara Richardson to Stay
 Destruction of Video Tape Evidence of Alleged Feloneous Conduct”, 
which we review as a petition for a writ of mandamus, and the 
record, it appears that the petition lacks the detail necessary 
to support the requested mandamus relief. Petitioners fail to 
demonstrate that they have a clear and indisputable right to the 
relief they request and that they lack alternative means to seek 
relief. Under these circumstances, the issuance of an 
extraordinary writ is not warranted at this time. See Kema v. 
Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of 
mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless 
the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to 
relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the 
alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
In light of the denial of the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus, IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the “Ex Parte Motion
 
to Shorten Time to Hear the Writ of Mandamus” is denied as moot.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, December 13, 2013.
