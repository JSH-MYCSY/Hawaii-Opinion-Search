IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
MONTY V. RIDEOUT, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CAAP-13-0001700; S.P.P. No. 13-1-001K)
 
ORDER DENYING “WRIT OF CERTIORARI, MOTION
FOR TRANSCRIPTS, MOTION FOR ASSIGNED COUNSEL”
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon review of petitioner Monty V. Rideout’s “Writ of 
Certiorari, Motion for Transcripts, Motion for Assigned Counsel”, 
which was filed on December 24, 2013, and which we review as a petition for a writ of mandamus, the supporting documents, and the record, it appears that petitioner is not entitled to a writ of mandamus. Petitioner does not have a clear and indisputable right to the appointment of counsel for an appeal in a post-conviction proceeding and fails to demonstrate that he is eligible for appointed counsel or that the appeal warrants the discretionary appointment of counsel. Petitioner, moreover, fails to demonstrate that the State of Hawai
'i is required to 
provide him free copies of the requested transcripts or that the requested transcripts are part of the appellate record. See Kema
 
v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai 'i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue 
unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; where a court has discretion to act, mandamus will not lie to interfere with or control the exercise of that discretion, even when the court has acted erroneously, unless the court has exceeded its jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in which it has a legal duty to act). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a
 
writ of mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, January 8, 2014.
