ANTHONY P. LOCRICCHIO, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, ACTING CHIEF DISCIPLINARY
COUNSEL CHARLENE M. NORRIS, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the January 26, 2014 petition for 
a writ of mandamus submitted by Petitioner attorney Anthony P. 
Locricchio, this court concludes nothing in the petition or the attached exhibits supports the conclusion that the Office of Disciplinary Counsel has violated a duty owed this court, or abused the discretion delegated to it by this court to investigate the allegations of misconduct lodged against the 
Petitioner. See Breiner v. Sunderland, 112 Haw. 60, 64-65, 143 
P.3d 1262, 1266-67 (2006); In re Disciplinary Bd. of the Hawai
'i Supreme Court, 91 Hawai 'i 363, 368-71, 984 P.2d 688, 693-96 
(1999); Akinaka v. Disciplinary Bd. of the Hawai 'i Supreme Court, 
91 Hawai 'i 51, 57, 979 P.2d 1077, 1083 (1999). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, January 30, 2014.
