IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I
 
ANTHONY P. LOCRICCHIO, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, ACTING CHIEF DISCIPLINARY
COUNSEL CHARLENE M. NORRIS, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the February 3, 2014 petition for
 
a writ of mandamus submitted by Petitioner attorney Anthony P.
 
Locricchio, the February 9, 2014 supplemental submission, and the
 exhibits appended, this court concludes nothing in the petition
 or the attached exhibits supports the conclusion that the Office
 of Disciplinary Counsel has violated a duty owed this court, or
 
abused the discretion delegated to it by this court. See Breiner
 
v. Sunderland, 112 Haw. 60, 64-65, 143 P.3d 1262, 1266-67 (2006); 
In re Disciplinary Bd. of the Hawai
'i Supreme Court, 91 Hawai 'i 
363, 368-71, 984 P.2d 688, 693-96 (1999); Akinaka v. Disciplinary Bd. of the Hawai 'i Supreme Court, 91 Hawai 'i 51, 57, 979 P.2d 
1077, 1083 (1999). It also appears there are alternate remedies 
to the alleged improprieties complained of, available to the Petitioner through action in the trial courts and Rule 8 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai
'i. “A writ of 
mandamus and/or prohibition will not issue unless a petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of other means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action.” Straub Clinic & Hospital v. Kochi, 81 
Hawai‘i 410, 414, 917 P.2d 1284, 1288 (1996). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, February 24, 2014.
