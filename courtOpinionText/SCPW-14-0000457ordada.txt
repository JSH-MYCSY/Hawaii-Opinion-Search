IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
MONTY V. RIDEOUT, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
  
(S.P.P.
 No. 13-1-001K)
 
ORDER DENYING “MOTION FOR RELEASE ON OWN
 
RECOGNIZANCE PURSUANT TO H.R.A.P. 23(b)”
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ., and
Circuit Judge Alm, assigned by reason of vacancy.)
 
Upon review of petitioner Monty V. Rideout’s “Motion
 
for Release on Own Recognizance Pursuant to H.R.A.P. 23(b)”,
 
which was filed on February 25, 2014, and which we treat as a
 petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the supporting documents,
 and the record, it appears that petitioner can seek relief in the
 circuit court and presents no special reason for the supreme
 court to invoke its original jurisdiction at this time. See Oili
 
v.
 Chang, 57 Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976). Moreover,
 
petitioner fails to demonstrate that his release from custody on
 his own recognizance is fitting under the circumstances. See
 
HRAP Rule 23(b). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
habeas corpus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, March 14, 2014.
