JOE CROFFORD, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE SHERRI ANN L. IHA, District Family
Court Judge, Family Court of the First Circuit, Respondent Judge, 
and
 
 
KRISTI ADACHI, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(FC-D NO. 13-1-7625)
 
ORDER GRANTING PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
We have considered Petitioner Joe Crofford’s petition
 
for a writ of prohibition, filed on February 25, 2014, the
 
supplement to the petition, the response filed by Respondent
 
Kristi Adachi, the respective supporting documents, and the
 
record. Under the circumstances of this case, the family court’s
 
issuance of the February 12, 2014 “Order Directing Seizure of Any
 
and All Computers and Data Storage Devices in Plaintiff’s
 
Possession or Control” ex parte and outside any formal discovery
     request was a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, and,
 
accordingly, a writ of prohibition is warranted. See Honolulu
 
Adv., Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a
 writ of prohibition “is an extraordinary remedy . . . to restrain
 
a judge of an inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of
 
his jurisdiction”). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition is granted. 
Respondent is directed to promptly deliver to Petitioner, through
 
respective counsel, the computer and data storage devices removed
 
from Petitioner’s possession and specifically identified on pages
 
2-3 of Exhibit “3” attached to the petition. The family court
 
may take appropriate steps to preserve and protect the property
 
and information. This order shall not be construed as
 
determining the rightful ownership of the property in question. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 13, 2014.
