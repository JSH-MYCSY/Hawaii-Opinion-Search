 ALLENE KAPLAN, Petitioner, 
vs. 
THE HONORABLE GREG K. NAKAMURA,
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV. NO. 11-1-000146)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF
 
PROHIBITION AND WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ., and
Circuit Judge Kubo, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Allene Kaplanâ€™s 
petition for a writ of prohibition and a writ of mandamus, filed 
on March 5, 2014, the documents submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that she has a clear and indisputable right to the requested extraordinary relief, and petitioner has alternative means to seek relief. 
Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to a writ of 
prohibition or a writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 
HawaiSi 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is 
an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or  obtain the requested action); Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao,
 
59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of mandamus and
 a writ of prohibition are extraordinary remedies meant to, among
 other things, restrain a judge of an inferior court from acting
 beyond or in excess of his or her jurisdiction; they are not
 intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the
 trial courts, cure a mere legal error, or serve as a legal remedy
 in lieu of normal appellate procedure). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
prohibition and a writ of mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, HawaiS i, April 4, 2014.
