IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent,
 
vs.
 
ROY ALAN COSTA, Petitioner.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 00-1-0253)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ., and
Circuit Judge Nakasone, assigned by reason of vacancy)
  
Upon consideration of petitioner Roy Alan Costa’s
 
petition for a writ of habeas corpus, filed on April 8, 2014, and
 
the record, it appears that petitioner has alternative means to
 seek relief and presents no special reason for this court to
 invoke its jurisdiction at this time. See Oili v. Chang
, 57 Haw.
 
411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976) (the supreme court “will not
 exercise its original jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings
 when relief is available in a lower court and no special reason
 exists for invoking its jurisdiction”). Accordingly,
  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
habeas corpus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, April 24, 2014.
