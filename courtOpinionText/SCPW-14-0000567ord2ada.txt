IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent,
 
vs.
 
ROY ALAN COSTA, Petitioner.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 00-1-0253)
 
ORDER DENYING “ORDER AGAINST YOUR DENYING TOWARD MOTION 16,
GOVERNMENT DISCOVERY; INSPECTION AND DISCLOSURE . . ., MOTION TO
DISAGREE YOUR DECISION’S APPEAL IS TAKEN, SHOULD NOT BE AFFIRMED”
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ., and
Circuit Judge Nakasone, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Roy Costa’s document
 
entitled “Order Against Your Denying Toward Motion 16. Government
 
Discovery; Inspection and Disclosure . . ., Motion to Disagree
 Your Decision’s Appeal is Taken, Should not be Affirmed”, which
 was filed as a petition for a writ of mandamus on April 15, 2014,
 and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate
 that he has a clear and indisputable right to the requested
 relief and that he lacks alternative means to seek relief. 
An
 
extraordinary writ, therefore, is not warranted. See Kema v.
  Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of 
mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless 
the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action); Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of mandamus is not intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the trial courts, cure a mere legal error, or serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedure). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition is
 
denied. 
IT IS HEREBY FINALLY ORDERED that the appellate clerks’
 
office shall not accept any further filings from petitioner in
 this closed proceeding. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, April 24, 2014.
