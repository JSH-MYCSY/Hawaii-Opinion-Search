SCPW-14-00000567 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
                                                          
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent,
 
vs.
 
ROY ALAN COSTA, Petitioner.
 
                                        
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 00-1-0253)
 
ORDER DENYING “MOTION RULE 16. GOVERNMENT DISCOVERY
 
INSPECTION AND DISCLOSURE . . , MOTION TO DISAGREE
DECISION’S APPEAL FROM THE SECOND CIRCUIT COURT’S JUDGMENT
 
FROM WHICH THE APPEAL IS TAKEN, SHOULD NOT BE AFFIRMED”
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ., and
Circuit Judge Nakasone, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Roy Costa’s document
 
entitled “Motion Rule 16. Government Discovery Inspection and
 
Disclosure . . , Motion to Disagree Decision’s Appeal from the
 Second Circuit Court’s Judgment from which the Appeal is Taken,
 Should not be Affirmed”, which was filed as a petition for a writ
 of mandamus on March 18, 2014, and the record, it appears that
 petitioner fails to demonstrate that he has a clear and
 indisputable right to the requested relief and that he lacks
 alternative means to seek relief. An extraordinary writ,
 therefore, is not warranted. 
See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 
204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an 
extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action); Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of mandamus is not intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the trial courts, cure a mere legal error, or serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedure). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition is 
denied.  
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, April 8, 2014.
