IN THE MATTER OF FRANCES ANNE WRIGHT,
Petitioner.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ., and
Circuit Judge Wilson, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Frances Anne Wright’s
 
letter to the court, which she describes as a petition, and which
 
the appellate clerks’ office filed as a petition on March 25,
 
2014, it appears that the requested relief is not available from
 
this court. See
 HRS § 386-88 (Supp. 2013). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
 
payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition is
 
denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, April 11, 2014.
