IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
FAUSTINO TRANSFIGURACION, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
HAWAI'I PAROLING AUTHORITY, STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent.
 
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 09-1-00126K)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ., and
Circuit Judge Ayabe, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Faustino
 
Transfiguracion’s letter dated March 25, 2014, which was filed as
 
a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on April 4, 2014, the
 documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
 the record, it appears that petitioner has alternative means to
 seek relief and presents no special reason for this court to
 invoke its jurisdiction at this time. See Oili v. Chang
, 57 Haw.
 
411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976) (the supreme court “will not
 exercise its original jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings
 when relief is available in a lower court and no special reason
 exists for invoking its jurisdiction”). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of habeas corpus
 
without payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a
 
writ of habeas corpus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, April 17, 2014. 
/s/ Mark E. Recktenwald /s/ Paula A. Nakayama /s/ Sabrina S. McKenna /s/ Richard W. Pollack
 /s/ Bert I. Ayabe
