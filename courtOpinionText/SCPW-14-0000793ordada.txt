CLAUDETTE DE GRACIA,
Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
CHARLENE NORRIS, ACTING FUND ADMINISTRATOR, LAWYERS’ FUND FOR
CLIENT PROTECTION; LAWYERS’ FUND FOR CLIENT PROTECTION,
Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER GRANTING PETITION FOR A WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the March 17, 2014 letter from
 
Claudette de Gracia to the Chief Justice of this court, which
  
this court has deemed a petition for a writ of mandamus, and the 
May 13, 2014 reply timely filed by Charlene Norris, Acting Fund Administrator for the Lawyers’ Fund for Client Protection, this court finds and concludes the following; that Rule 10.5(e) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai' i (RSCH) and 
Rule 5.2(j) of the Lawyers’ Fund Rules and Regulations (LFRR) grant both a denied claimant to the Fund and the respondent attorney the right to a hearing if timely requested following notification of the Fund’s final determination of a claim. 
Insofar as Ms. de Gracia timely made a request for the required hearing, the Fund has refused to provide her the hearing, and she has no other remedy for the denial of the hearing to which she has a right, see In re Disciplinary Board of the Hawai' i Supreme 
Court, 91 Hawai' i 363, 368, 984 P.2d 688, 693 (1999), therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is granted.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Lawyers’ Fund shall
 
timely convene a hearing on the denied claim, pursuant to RSCH
 Rule 10 and the LFRR.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, June 18, 2014.
