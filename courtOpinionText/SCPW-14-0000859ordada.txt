IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
MICHAEL G.M. OSTENDORP, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, ACTING CHIEF DISCIPLINARY
COUNSEL CHARLENE M. NORRIS, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the May 30, 2014 petition for a
 
writ of prohibition submitted by Petitioner attorney Michael G.M.
 
Ostendorp, this court notes the passage of time between the
 initial complaints and the present but, upon a review of the
 record, anticipates their timely resolution, and concludes nothing
 in the petition or the attached exhibits supports the conclusion
 that the Office of Disciplinary Counsel has violated a duty owed
 this court, or abused the discretion delegated to it by this court
 to investigate the allegations of misconduct lodged against the
 Petitioner. See Breiner v. Sunderland, 112 Haw. 60, 64-65, 143 
P.3d 1262, 1266-67 (2006); In re Disciplinary Bd. of the Hawai 'i 
Supreme Court, 91 Hawai 'i 363, 368-71, 984 P.2d 688, 693-96 
(1999); Akinaka v. Disciplinary Bd. of the Hawai 'i Supreme Court, 
91 Hawai 'i 51, 57, 979 P.2d 1077, 1083 (1999). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
prohibition is denied, without prejudice to the Petitioner, in his
 
discretion, filing a protective order with the appropriate party,
 pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Rules of the Disciplinary Board with
 regards to his medical records.
 
DATED: 
Honolulu, Hawai 'i, June 13, 2014.
