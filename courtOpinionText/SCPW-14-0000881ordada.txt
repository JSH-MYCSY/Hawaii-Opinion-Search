ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV.
 NO. 11-1-0525(2))
 
ORDER DENYING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
  
AND FOR AN EMERGENCY STAY
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitionersâ€™ application for writ
 
of mandamus and for an emergency stay, filed on June 9, 2014, the
 
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
 
the record, it appears that Petitioners fail to demonstrate that
 
the Respondent Judges are exceeding their jurisdiction,
 
committing a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or
 
refusing to act in ordering the posting of a supersedeas bond and
 the setting of a bond amount for a stay during the pendency of an 
appeal. Moreover, Petitioners have already sought relief in 
their appeal. A writ of mandamus, therefore, is not warranted. 
See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 
(1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and 
indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to 
redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested 
action; where a court has discretion to act, mandamus will not 
lie to interfere with or control the exercise of that discretion, 
even if the judge acted erroneously, unless the judge has 
exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and 
manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject 
properly before the court under circumstances in which the court 
has a legal duty to act); Shanghai Inv. Co. v. Alteka Co., Ltd., 
92 Hawai' i 482, 503, 993 P.2d 516, 537 (2000) (the amount of a 
bond or alternative security sufficient to protect the rights of an appellee is committed to the sound discretion of the trial 
court), overruled on other grounds by Blair v. Ing, 96 Hawai' i 
327, 31 P.3d 184 (2001). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for a writ of 
mandamus and for an emergency stay is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, June 24, 2014.
