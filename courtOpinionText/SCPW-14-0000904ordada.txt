TRUSTEES OF THE ESTATE OF BERNICE PAUAHI BISHOP

vs.
 
ROM A. TRADER, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT
OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, Respondent Judge, 
and
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I and GABRIEL ALISNA, Respondents. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 13-1-1861)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioners’ petition for a writ 
of mandamus, filed on June 25, 2014 (“Petition”), the answers 
filed by Respondents State of Hawai' i and Gabriel Alisna 
(“Alisna”), the supplemental memorandum and reply filed by 
Petitioners, the respective supporting documents, and the record, it is unclear whether the circuit court applied the three-part 
test set forth in State v. Peseti, 101 Hawai' i 172, 182, 65 P.3d 
119, 129 (2003), to address the issues related to the June 17, 2014 “Decision and Order Regarding In-Camera Inspection of
 
Documents Produced by Third-Party Kamehameha Schools Relating to
 Hearing Held May 27, 2014.” Peseti requires Alisna to show the
 
following: “(1) there is a legitimate need to disclose the
 
[1]
; (2) the information is relevant and protected information material to the issue before the court; and (3) the party seeking to pierce the privilege shows by a preponderance of the evidence that no less intrusive source for that information exists.” 101 Hawai'i at 182, 65 P.3d at 129 (quotation marks and citation 
omitted) (footnote added). 
Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Respondent Judge shall
 
apply the three-part test set forth in Peseti to determine if
 disclosure of the privileged documents is warranted, subject to
 any applicable waiver of the privilege. In determining whether
 there is a legitimate need by the defense for the information at
 issue, the Respondent Judge should consider in camera review of
 discovery disclosed by the government to Alisna and any
 applicable investigative reports prepared by Alisna. In
 determining whether there is no less intrusive source for the
 information, the Respondent Judge should consider whether the
 substance of the privileged information may become available to
 the defense through other discovery methods. If the Respondent
 Judge concludes that disclosure of the privileged documents is
 warranted, then the Respondent Judge is directed to consider the
 
This would involve consideration of Alisna’s constitutional rights
 
as well as the particular policy interests served by the attorney-client
privilege.

 1 imposition of appropriate protective measures, including, but not
 
limited to, the redaction of any mental impressions and work
 product of Petitioners’ attorneys. 
In all other respects, the petition for a writ of 
mandamus is denied. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 
982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (where a court has discretion to act, a writ of mandamus will not issue, even if the judge has acted erroneously, unless the judge has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before the court where he or she has a legal duty to act).
