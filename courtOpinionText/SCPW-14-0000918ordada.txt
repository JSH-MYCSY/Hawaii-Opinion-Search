ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV. NO. 13-1-0053)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Nakayama, Acting C.J., McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.,
and  Circuit  Judge  Nakasone,  in  place  of  Recktenwald,  C.J.,
recused.)
 
Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus filed by Petitioner Ardeshir Hormozyari, in his
 
capacity as Successor Trustee of the David E. Walters Trust
 
dated March 31, 2003 and Personal Representative of the
 Estate of David Walters, the documents attached thereto and 
submitted in support thereof, the supplemental memorandum, 
and the record, it appears that Petitioner fails to 
demonstrate, under the present facts and circumstances of 
the underlying proceeding, that he is entitled to the 
requested extraordinary relief. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 
Hawai'i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of 
mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue 
unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable 
right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress 
adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested 
action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ
 
of mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, April 28, 2015.
