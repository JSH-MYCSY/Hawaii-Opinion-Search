TONY ALAN WILLIAMS, Petitioner,
 
vs. 
COLETTE Y. GARIBALDI, Respondent Judge, 
and 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(S.P.P.
 11-1-0065)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Wilson, JJ., and
Circuit Judge To 'oto'o, in place of Pollack, J., recused.)
 
Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus filed by petitioner Tony Alan Williams on July 7, 2014,
 
and the record, it appears that the circuit court disposed of the
 HRPP Rule 40 petition for post-conviction relief on September 30,
 2014. 
Petitionerâ€™s request for mandamus relief is therefore
 
moot. Accordingly,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied as moot. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, November 5, 2014.
