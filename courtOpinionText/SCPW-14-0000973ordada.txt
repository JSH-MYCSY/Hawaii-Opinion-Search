ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the documents filed by Petitioner 
Livia Scotto, on July 18, 2014, which was filed as a petition for 
a writ of mandamus, the supplemental submission, filed on July 21, 2014, and the record, it appears that Petitioner is challenging the Findings of Facts, Conclusions of Law, Decision and Order issued by the Oahu Eviction Board A, Hawai
'i Public 
Housing Authority on June 18, 2014. The documents, however, should have been filed in the circuit court pursuant to HRS §§ 91-14 and 356D-96. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Clerk of the Appellate
 
Court shall forward the documents to the Circuit Court of the
 First Circuit, State of Hawai 'i to file as a notice of appeal. 
The filing date shall be deemed the date that the documents were 
filed in this court. 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a
 
writ of mandamus is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, August 5, 2014.
