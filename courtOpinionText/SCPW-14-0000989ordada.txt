ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DISMISSING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the documents filed by Petitioner
 
Livia Scotto, on July 22, 2014, which was filed as a petition for
 
a writ of mandamus, and the record, it appears that Petitioner is
 seeking identical relief challenging the eviction in an appeal to
 the first circuit court that will be filed pursuant to the order
 issued in SCPW-14-0000973, and the issues raised in the instant
 petition are raised in the appeal. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee. 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a
 
writ of mandamus is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, August 14, 2014.
