'I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent,
 
vs.
 
KEVIN NAKAYAMA, Petitioner.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 13-1-0381)
 
ORDER  DENYING  WITHOUT  PREJUDICE  PETITION  FOR  WRIT  OF  HABEAS  CORPUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Kevin Nakayama’s
 
petition for writ of habeas corpus, filed on July 28, 2014, the
 
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
 
the record, it appears that habeas corpus relief is available to
 
Petitioner in the circuit court and Petitioner presents no
 
special reason for invoking the supreme court’s original
 
jurisdiction. See Oili v. Chang, 57 Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787,
 
788 (1976). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
habeas corpus is denied without prejudice to seeking habeas
 corpus relief in the circuit court.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, August 14, 2014.
