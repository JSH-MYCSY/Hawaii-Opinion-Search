MICKEY A. MADDOX, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CAAP-14-0001108; CAAP-14-0001109; S.P.P. NO. 13-10004(3);
CR. NOS. 07-1-0139 and 09-1-0284)
 
ORDER DENYING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Mickey A. Maddox’s 
“Application for Writ of Habeas Corpus (Immediate Release of
 
Prisoner),” filed on August 11, 2014, the documents attached
 thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it
 appears that Petitioner currently seeks relief in the
 Intermediate Court of Appeals in appeals that were consolidated
 under CAAP-14-0001108 and Petitioner presents no special reason
 for invoking the supreme court’s original jurisdiction. 
See Oili
 
v. Chang, 57 Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for writ of
 
habeas corpus is denied.
 IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that all motions pending
 
in this original proceeding are dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, February 2, 2015.
