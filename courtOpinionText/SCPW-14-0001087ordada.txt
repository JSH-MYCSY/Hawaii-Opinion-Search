ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Nakayama, acting C.J., McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ., and
Circuit  Judge  Chan,  in  place  of  Recktenwald,  C.J.,  recused)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Robert Quartero’s
 
document entitled “Petitioner’s Battery of Nine Petitions for a
 
Peremptory Writ of Mandamus; Motion to Expedite for Emergency
 Treatment & Emergency Extension to Submit a Reply Brief,” which
 was filed on August 27, 2014, and which we review as a petition
 for a writ of mandamus, the supplemental exhibits submitted in
 support thereof, and the record, it appears that Petitioner fails
 to demonstrate that he has a clear and indisputable right to the 
requested relief or that he lacks alternative means to seek relief. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 
P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appellate clerk shall
 
process the petition for a writ of mandamus without payment of
 the filing fee.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a 
writ of mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, September 29, 2014.
