JOHN T. ORSO, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE STEVEN ALM, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT
OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent Judge
and
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent.

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 03-1-0048; S.P.P. NO. 07-1-0050)
 
ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner John T. Orso’s 
petition for a writ of mandamus, the answers filed by Respondent 
State of Hawai' i and Respondent Judge, the respective supporting 
documents, and the record, it appears that, on April 21, 2015, the circuit court disposed of the pending motion for reconsideration pursuant to the “Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting State’s Motion for Reconsideration in Light of New Case Law and Denying Petition for Post Conviction Relief Without a Hearing.” Petitioner’s request for mandamus
 
relief is therefore moot. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied as moot.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, April 30, 2015.
