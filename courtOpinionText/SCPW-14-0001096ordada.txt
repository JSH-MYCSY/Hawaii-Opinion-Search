ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CAAP-14-0000436; CAAP-14-0001238; CIV. NO. 1RC-13-8808)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, J.J.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioners Young Hui Kim and CK
 
Enterprises, LLC’s petition for a writ of prohibition, filed on
 
September 2, 2014, the documents attached thereto and submitted
 in support thereof, and the record, it appears that Petitioners
 fail to demonstrate that extraordinary relief is warranted under
 the facts and circumstances of this matter and Petitioners may
 seek relief, as appropriate, in their pending appeals (CAAP-14­0000436 and CAAP-14-0001238). Petitioners, therefore, are not
 entitled to the requested writ of prohibition. See Honolulu
 
Adv., Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a
 
writ of prohibition “is an extraordinary remedy . . . to restrain
 a judge of an inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of
 his jurisdiction”); Gannett Pac. Corp. v. Richardson, 59 Haw.
 224, 226, 580 P.2d 49, 53 (1978) (a writ of prohibition is not
 meant to serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate
 procedures; rather, it is available in “rare and exigent
 circumstances” where “allow[ing] the matter to wend its way
 through the appellate process would not be in the public interest
 and would work upon the public irreparable harm”). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
prohibition is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, November 25, 2014.
