ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV.
 NO. 12-1-1637-06)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
OR OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Father Walter
 
Johnsonâ€™s petition for a writ of mandamus or other appropriate
 
relief, filed on October 1, 2014, the documents attached thereto
 and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears
 that, under the specific facts and circumstances of this matter
 and the terms of the protective order, Petitioner fails to
 demonstrate that disclosure of the requested documents pursuant 
to the protective order issued by the Discovery Master violates article I, section 6 of the Hawai' i Constitution. Petitioner, 
therefore, is not entitled to a writ of mandamus. See Kema v. 
Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a 
writ of mandamus is meant to restrain a judge of an inferior court who has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty to act). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, March 18, 2015.
