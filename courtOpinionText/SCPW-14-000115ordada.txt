ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV.
 NO. 14-1-001348)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Khistina Caldwell
 
DeJean’s petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on October 3,
 
2014, the respective supporting documents, and the record, it
 appears that Petitioner fails to demonstrate that she has a clear
 and indisputable right to stop the 2014 general election and have
 her name included on the ballot as a candidate for governor. See
 
Haw. Const. art. V, sec. 2 (“The lieutenant governor shall be
   elected at the same time, for the same term and in the same 
manner as the governor[.]”); Hirono v. Peabody, 81 Hawai' i 230, 
915 P.2d 704 (1996) (a candidate for governor must seek the nomination to the office with a candidate for lieutenant governor from the same political party); HRS § 12-8 (2009 & Supp. 2013). Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 
338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 23, 2014.
