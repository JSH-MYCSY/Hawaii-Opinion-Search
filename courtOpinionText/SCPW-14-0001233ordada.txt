IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Petitioner, 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE RANDAL K.O. LEE, Judge of the Circuit Court of the
First Circuit, State of Hawai' i, Respondent Judge, 
and
 
 
TRACY T. YOSHIMURA, EUGENE M. SIMEONA, JR., MICHAEL D.

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 14-1-0717)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION
 
AND STAY OF PROCEEDINGS
 
(By:  Recktenwald,  C.J.,  Nakayama,  McKenna,  Pollack,  and  Wilson,  JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner State of Hawai' i’s 
petition for a writ of prohibition and stay of proceedings, filed 
on October 29, 2014, the documents attached thereto and submitted 
in support thereof, and the record, it appears that Petitioner 
fails to demonstrate that the Respondent Judge acted or is acting 
beyond or in excess of his jurisdiction in finding that he had 
limited and inherent jurisdiction to consider the reconsideration motion and in scheduling the evidentiary hearing. See Honolulu
 
Adv., Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a
 
writ of prohibition “is an extraordinary remedy . . . to restrain
 
a judge of an inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of
 
his jurisdiction”). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition is denied.
 DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, November 14, 2014.
