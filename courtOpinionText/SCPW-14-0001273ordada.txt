ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CAAP-14-0000809; CR. NO. 96-0078)
 
ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
 
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Gerald Villanuevaâ€™s 
petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on November 3, 2014, the 
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that Petitioner, who is seeking relief from the Intermediate Court of Appeals in CAAP-14-0000809, fails to demonstrate that he has a clear and indisputable right to relief from this court or that he lacks alternative means to seek relief. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to a writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 
338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and
 
indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to
 redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
 action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a
 
writ of mandamus is denied without prejudice to Petitioner
 seeking relief, as appropriate, in CAAP-14-0000809.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, November 20, 2014.
