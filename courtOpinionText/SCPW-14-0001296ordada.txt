ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV.
 NO. 12-1-1637-06)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
OR OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Catholic Foreign
 
Mission Society of America, Inc., aka Maryknoll Fathers and
 
Brothers’s petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on November
 12, 2014, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support
 thereof, and the record, it appears that Petitioner fails to
 demonstrate that, under the specific facts and circumstances of
 this matter and the terms of the protective order, disclosure of 
the requested documents pursuant to the protective order issued by the Discovery Master violates article I, section 6 of the Hawai'i Constitution. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to 
a writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 
982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is meant to restrain a judge of an inferior court who has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty to act). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
