HENRY M. NOA, Petitioner, 
vs. 
THE HONORABLE KELSEY T. KAWANO, Judge of the District Court
of the Second Circuit, State of Hawai' i, Respondent Judge, 
and 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CASE NO. 2DCW-14-0000523)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Henry M. Noaâ€™s 
petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on November 24, 2014, and 
the record, it appears that Petitioner fails to demonstrate that he has a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief, that he lacks alternative means to seek relief, or that the Respondent Judge committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion in denying the motion to dismiss and setting the matter for trial. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to a writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary
 
remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a
 clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative
 means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the
 requested action); Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw.
 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of mandamus is not
 intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the
 trial courts, cure a mere legal error, or serve as a legal remedy
 in lieu of normal appellate procedure; rather, it is meant to
 restrain a judge of an inferior court who has exceeded his or her
 jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of
 discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before
 the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty
 to act). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, December 4, 2014.
