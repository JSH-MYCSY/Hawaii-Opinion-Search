NORTH BEACH WEST MAUI BENEFIT FUND,

LAND COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I, ADMINISTRATIVE
DIRECTOR OF THE COURTS, and CHIEF STAFF ATTORNEY
OF THE SUPREME COURT, Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(1 L.D. CASE NO. 12-1-3039)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner North Beach West Maui 
Benefit Fundâ€™s petition for a writ of mandamus or other relief, 
filed on December 1, 2014, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that Petitioner fails to demonstrate that it has a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief or that it lacks alternative means to seek relief. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 
91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the
 
petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief
 and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged
 wrong or obtain the requested action); Honolulu Advertiser, Inc.
 v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of
 mandamus is not intended to supersede the legal discretionary
 authority of the trial courts, cure a mere legal error, or serve
 as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedure); Cir.
 Ct. R. 2.2(1)(c); Haw. Ct. Rec. R. 10.18(b). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus or other relief is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, February 2, 2015.
