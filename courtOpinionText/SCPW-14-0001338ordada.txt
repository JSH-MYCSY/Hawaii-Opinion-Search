ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-0137)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Eileen Shavelsonâ€™s 
petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on December 4, 2014, the 
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that the complaint and summons may not have been properly served upon the Respondents and, therefore, a judgment ending the case is not appropriate at this time. Petitioner is not entitled to the requested writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) 
(a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable
 
right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress
 adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action);
 Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d
 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of mandamus is not intended to supersede
 the legal discretionary authority of the trial courts, cure a
 mere legal error, or serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal
 appellate procedure; rather, it is meant to restrain a judge of
 an inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of his or her
 jurisdiction). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, December 17, 2014.
