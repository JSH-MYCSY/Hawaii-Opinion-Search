'I 
DIANE ELIZABETH MATHER-GEMELLI a.k.a. DIANE ELIZABETH MATHER 
and BRENTWOOD ASSOCIATES, LLC, Petitioners, 
vs. 
THE HONORABLE GARY W.B. CHANG, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE
FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Respondent Judge, 
and 
CITIMORTGAGE INC. and KAREN SCHAEFER, Respondents. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(Civil No. 14-1-1218-05)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioners Diane E. Mather and 
Brentwood Associates, LLCâ€™s petition for a writ of mandamus, 
filed on December 16, 2014, and the record, it appears that Petitioners fail to demonstrate that they have a clear and indisputable right to the requested documents or that they lack alternative means to seek relief. Petitioners, therefore, are not entitled to a writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 
Hawai
'i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is 
an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack
 
of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
 obtain the requested action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, January 21, 2015.
