JAMES J. NAVAJA, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
STEPHEN JOST, Director; CHRIS ATHERALL;
JOHN AND JANE DOES, Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CAAP-14-0001164; CIV. NO. 14-1-1439-06)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, J.J.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner James J. Navaja’s
 
petition for writ of prohibition, filed on December 22, 2014, and
 
the record, it appears that Petitioner’s appeal is pending before
 the Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”). If the appeal is
 dismissed for nonpayment of the filing fee or if the ICA enters
 judgment on the final disposition of the appeal, Petitioner may
 seek relief pursuant to HRAP Rule 40.1. A writ of prohibition is
 therefore not warranted under the specific facts and
 circumstances of this matter. See Honolulu Adv., Inc. v. Takao,
 
59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of prohibition
 “is an extraordinary remedy . . . to restrain a judge of an
 inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of his
 
jurisdiction”). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appellate clerks’ office
 
shall process the petition for writ of prohibition without
 payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a 
writ of prohibition is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 13, 2015.
