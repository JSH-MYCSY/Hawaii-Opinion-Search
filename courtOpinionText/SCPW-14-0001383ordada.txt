IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I
 
RANDY HANOHANO, Petitioner,
 
v.
 
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Randy Hanohanoâ€™s
 
letter to the supreme court, which was filed and reviewed as a
 
petition for a writ of habeas corpus, it appears that: (1)
 petitioner, who is incarcerated at Oahu Community Correctional
 Center awaiting trial in a pending first circuit court case,
 contends he is being unlawfully detained and offers numerous
 arguments to support his release; and (2) petitioner can seek
 relief in the first circuit court and does not present any
 special reason for the supreme court to invoke its original
 jurisdiction at this time. See Oili v. Chang, 57 Haw. 411, 412,
 
557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for writ of habeas corpus
 
without payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
habeas corpus is denied. The clerk of the court shall forward a
 copy of petitioner's letter to petitioner's attorney.
