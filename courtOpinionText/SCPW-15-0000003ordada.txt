ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV.
 NO. 13-1-1765-06)
 
ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Cordially Ramos­
Newton’s petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on January 5,
 
2015, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support
 thereof, and the record, it appears that Petitioner has filed an
 appeal from the foreclosure decree and the foreclosure judgment
 in CAAP-14-0001354 and that the foreclosure action remains
 pending in the circuit court. Petitioner may seek relief in 
appeal or in the circuit court. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 
91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus 
is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action); Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of
 mandamus is not intended to supersede the legal discretionary
 authority of the trial courts, cure a mere legal error, or serve
 as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedure). 
Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied without prejudice to Petitioner seeking
 relief, as appropriate, in the appeal or the circuit court.
