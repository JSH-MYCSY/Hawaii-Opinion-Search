LANRIC HYLAND, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
DEE TORRES, Secretary to the Board of Registration;
PHILLIP MATLAGE, Chair of the Board of Registration;
STEWART MAEDA, Hawaii County Clerk; and VALRI KUNIMOTO,
Deputy Attorney General, Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CAAP-15-0000053)
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Lanric Hyland’s 
petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on January 7, 2015, the 
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that Petitioner has filed an appeal from the Board of Registration’s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Dismissing Appeals with the Intermediate Court of Appeals, docketed as CAAP-15-0000053, and may seek relief in the appeal. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to a writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy
 
that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear
 and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means
 to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
 action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied without prejudice to Petitioner raising the
 arguments presented in the instant petition, as appropriate, in
 CAAP-15-0000053. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, February 10, 2015.
