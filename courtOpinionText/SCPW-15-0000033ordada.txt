ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CAAP-13-0001474; CIV. NO. 11-1-2228)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Edmund M. Abordo’s
 
document entitled “Plaintiff-Appellant’s Writ of Mandamus for
 
Violation of the Rules [of] the Court and the Fourteenth
 Amendment of the United States Constitution,” filed on January
 20, 2015, and the record, it appears that Petitioner fails to
 demonstrate that he has a clear and indisputable right to an
 immediate decision in CAAP-13-0001474 and, therefore, mandamus
 relief is not warranted. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 
204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an 
extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
 
court shall process the petition for a writ mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, February 2, 2015.
