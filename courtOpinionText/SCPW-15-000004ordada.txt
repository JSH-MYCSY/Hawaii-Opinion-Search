EILEEN SHAVELSON, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE CRAIG NAKAMURA, CHIEF JUDGE OF THE INTERMEDIATE
COURT OF APPEALS, STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent Judge,
 
and
 
KITAAMI, JEFFREY HIRANAKA, HARVEY HIRANAKA, and
MRS. MILTON (ANNA) HIRANAKA, Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
  
(CAAP-14-0001245; CAAP-13-0002205; CIVIL NO. 13-1-0137)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Eileen Shavelson’s
 
petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on January 5, 2015, the
 
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
 the record, it appears that Petitioner fails to demonstrate that
 the judges have not administered justice “speedily and properly”
 inasmuch as the Intermediate Court of Appeals considered CAAP-13­0002205 and CAAP-14-0001245, and recently dismissed the appeals
 for lack of jurisdiction. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled
 to the requested writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 
Hawai'i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is 
an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner 
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
