ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 14-1-0717)
 
ORDER GRANTING IN PART PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., and Pollack, J., with McKenna, J.,
concurring,  with  whom  Wilson,  J.,  joins,
 
and  with  Nakayama,  J.,  concurring  separately)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner State of Hawai' i’s 
petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on February 25, 2015 
(“Petition”), the Respondents’ answers of no position, the respective supporting documents, and the record, it appears that based on the case law adduced by the circuit court in favor of disqualification, the circuit court’s finding that Deputy Prosecuting Attorneys Katherine Kealoha and Jacob Delaplane
 
committed prosecutorial misconduct but that the misconduct “was
 not done intentionally or maliciously, but was based on a lack of
 experience” does not support the disqualification ordered by the
 circuit court in its December 1, 2014 Findings of Fact,
 Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Defendant Yoshimura’s
 Motion to Reconsider Order Granting State of Hawaii’s Ex Parte
 Motion to Nolle Prosequi Without Prejudice; Granting in Part and
 Denying in Part Defendant Simeona’s Oral Motion to Disqualify;
 and Denying Defendant Yoshimura’s Oral Motion to Establish a
 Deadline to Reindict (“Disqualification Order”). It further
 appears that Petitioner has made a showing of irreparable and
 immediate harm that has not been contradicted by Respondents.
 
Thus, under the specific facts and circumstances of this
 
matter, an extraordinary writ is warranted inasmuch as the basis
 upon which the circuit court grounded the disqualification is
 insufficient and Petitioner has made a showing of irreparable and
 immediate harm as a result of the disqualification. See Chuck v.
 
St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., 61 Haw. 552, 558, 606 P.2d
 1320, 1324 (1980) (“[W]here the basis upon which the trial court
 has rested its order of disqualification is clearly insufficient,
 and a convincing showing is made in the petition that irreparable
 and immediate harm would otherwise be the necessary consequence,
 the petitioner’s application for a writ of mandamus will be
 granted.”). Accordingly, 
2
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Petition is granted in
 
part. The Disqualification Order is vacated to the extent it
 
disqualifies Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Katherine Kealoha and
 Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Jacob Delaplane “from further
 prosecution of this matter.”
