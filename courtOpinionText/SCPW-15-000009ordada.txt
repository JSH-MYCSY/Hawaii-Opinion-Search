SANDRA KATO-KLUTKE, in her official capacity as a member
of the Agribusiness Development Corporation, and
CHAD McDONALD, in his official capacity as a Commissioner
of the Land Use Commission, Petitioners,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE RHONDA NISHIMURA, Circuit Judge of the Circuit
Court of the First Circuit, State of Hawai' i, Respondent Judge, 
and
 
HAWAI'I STATE ETHICS COMMISSION and 
PEER NEWS LLC, dba Civil Beat, Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(Civil No. 14-1-2022-09)
 
ORDER GRANTING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
AND WRIT OF PROHIBITION
 
(By:  Recktenwald,  C.J.,  Nakayama,  McKenna,  Pollack,  and  Wilson,  JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioners’ petition for writ of
 
mandamus and writ of prohibition, filed on January 7, 2015
 
(“Petition”), Respondent State of Hawaii Ethics Commission’s
 response, filed February 17, 2015, Respondent Peer News LLC, dba
 Civil Beat’s answer, filed February 20, 2015, the respective
 supporting documents, and the record, it appears that,
 Petitioners claim they will suffer irreparable harm if the
 circuit court’s December 31, 2014 “Order Granting Plaintiff Peer
 
News LLC’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction Filed September 25,
 2014” (“the Order”) is not stayed pending appellate review, while
 Respondent Peer News LLC, dba Civil Beat claims it will suffer
 irreparable harm if the Order is stayed. It does not appear,
 however, that the circuit court has made a final determination on
 the merits of the underlying case. A temporary stay is therefore
 warranted to preserve the status quo until a final judgment on
 the merits is entered by the circuit court. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Petition is granted to
 
the extent the Order requires the release of financial disclosure
 statements filed prior to the effective date of Act 230. 
Enforcement of the Order is temporarily stayed until the
 conclusion of the circuit court proceeding, which disposition
 should proceed in a prompt manner. The parties may seek a
 further stay during the pendency of an appeal, if any, as
 appropriate.
