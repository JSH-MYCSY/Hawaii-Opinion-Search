(Civil No. 13-1-0907(1))
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioners Jonathan Paul
 
Baldwin, Lynn Ann Lindell Baldwin, and Moana Property LLCâ€™s
 
petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on February 27, 2015, the
 documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
 the record, it appears that Petitioners fail to demonstrate that
 they have a clear and indisputable right to relief or that they
 lack alternative means to seek relief. Petitioners further fail 
to demonstrate that the Respondent Judge exceeded her jurisdiction, committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or refused to act on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in which she has a legal duty to act. Petitioners, therefore, are not entitled to a writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) 
(a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action); Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of mandamus is not intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the trial courts, cure a mere legal error, or serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedure; rather, it is meant to restrain a judge of an inferior court who has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty to act). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, March 25, 2015.
