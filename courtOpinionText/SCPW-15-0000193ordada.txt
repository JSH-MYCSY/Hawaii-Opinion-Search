ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV.
 NO. 1RC14-1-7636)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Lily Tai Nomura’s
 
petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on March 23, 2015, the
 
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
 
the record, it appears that Petitioner fails to demonstrate that
 
the respondent judge committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of
 
discretion in denying her “Motion to Set Bond for a Stay Pending
 
Appeal.” If an appeal is filed in the underlying proceeding,
 Petitioner may seek relief in the district court or in the 
Intermediate Court of Appeal, as appropriate. Petitioner is not 
entitled to extraordinary relief. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 
200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner 
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack 
of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or 
obtain the requested action; where a court has discretion to act, 
mandamus will not lie to interfere with or control the exercise 
of that discretion, even when the judge has acted erroneously, 
unless the judge has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has 
committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has 
refused to act on a subject properly before the court under 
circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty to act); 
Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 
58, 62 (1978) (a writ of mandamus is not intended to supersede 
the legal discretionary authority of the trial courts, cure a 
mere legal error, or serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal 
appellate procedure). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, April 8, 2015.
