ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CAAP-12-0000046; CIVIL NO. 11-1-1090)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR A PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Bruce Robert Travisâ€™s 
petition for a peremptory writ of mandamus, filed March 23, 2015, 
the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, 
and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate 
that he has a clear and indisputable right to extraordinary 
relief or that he lacked alternative means to seek relief. See 
Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue 
unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right 
to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately  the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; Honolulu
 
Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62
 
(1978) (a writ of mandamus is not intended to supersede the legal
 
discretionary authority of the trial courts, cure a mere legal
 
error, or serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate
 
procedure). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a peremptory 
writ of mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, May 15, 2015.
