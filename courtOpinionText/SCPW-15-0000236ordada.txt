IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
KAIULA KALAWE ENGLISH and ROBIN WAINUHEA DUDOIT, Petitioners,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE JOSEPH E. CARDOZA, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT
COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent Judge,
 
and
 
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 14-1-0819(3); CR. NO. 14-1-0820(3))
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioners Kaiula Kalawe English
 
and Robin Wainuhea Dudoitâ€™s petition for a writ of mandamus,
 
filed on March 27, 2015, the documents attached thereto and
 
submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that
 
Petitioners fail to demonstrate that they have a clear and
 
indisputable right to have their criminal cases dismissed or that
 
the Respondent Judge committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of
 
discretion in denying the motions to dismiss. Petitioners,
 
therefore, are not entitled to extraordinary relief. See Kema v.
 Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue 
unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right 
to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately 
the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; where a court 
has discretion to act, mandamus will not lie to interfere with or 
control the exercise of that discretion, even when the judge has 
acted erroneously, unless the judge has exceeded his or her 
jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of 
discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before 
the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty 
to act). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, April 20, 2015.
