ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(L.D. NO. 11-1-3738)
 
ORDER DENYING AS MOOT PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner’s petition for a writ
 
of mandamus, filed on April 6, 2015, the answer filed by the
 
Respondent Judge, the respective supporting documents, and the
 record, it appears that, on June 24, 2015, the Land Court
 disposed of the pending Land Court petition pursuant to the
 “Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Petition of The Bank
 of New York Mellon, as Trustee for the Certificateholders CWALT,
 Inc., Alternative Loan Trust 2006-OA10 Mortgage Pass-Through
 Certificates, Series 2006-OA10, for Amendment of Land Court
 
Certificate of Title No. 918,537.” Petitioner’s request for
 mandamus relief is therefore moot. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied as moot.
