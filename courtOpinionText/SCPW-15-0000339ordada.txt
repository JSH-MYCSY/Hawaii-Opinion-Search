NELSON WAIKIKI, JR., Petitioner,

THE HONORABLE RHONDA LOO, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE
SECOND CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent Judge,
 
and
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 13-1-0428)
 
ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Nelson Waikiki Jr.’s
 
“Petition for Extraordinary Writ of Mandamus,” filed on April 15,
 
2015, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support
 thereof, and the record, it appears that Petitioner is seeking
 the requested relief in the circuit court proceeding. 
Petitioner, therefore, fails to demonstrate that he lacks
 alternative means to seek relief or that the Respondent Judge has
 exceeded her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest
 abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a matter in which
 she has a duty to act in his criminal case. Petitioner,
 therefore, is not entitled to extraordinary relief. See Kema v. 
Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue 
unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; where a court has discretion to act, mandamus will not lie to interfere with or control the exercise of that discretion, even when the judge has acted erroneously, unless the judge has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty to act). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appellate clerks’ office
 
shall file the petition for a writ of mandamus without payment of
 the filing fee. 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for a
 
writ of mandamus is denied without prejudice to Petitioner
 seeking relief in the circuit court, as appropriate.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, April 28, 2015.
