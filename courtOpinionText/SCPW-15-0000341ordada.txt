MICHAEL YELLEN, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE GLENN HARA, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD
CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI #I, Respondent Judge.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CG NO. 14-1-0001)

 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Mike Yellen’s petition 
for a writ of mandamus, the documents attached thereto and 
submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that Petitioner is not a party to the underlying guardianship/ conservatorship proceeding and fails to demonstrate that he has a clear and indisputable right to relief, that he lacks alternative means to seek relief, or that the Respondent Judge’s actions amount to a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to a writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis , 91 Hawai #i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 
(1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to 
redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action); Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao , 59 Haw. 237, 241, 
580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of mandamus is not intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the trial courts, cure a mere legal error, or serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedure). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai #i, August 13, 2015.
