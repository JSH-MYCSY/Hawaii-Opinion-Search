SCPW-15-0000347 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI‘ I 
TRUSTEES OF THE ESTATE OF BERNICE PAUAHI BISHOP 
dba KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS, Petitioners, 
vs. 
ROM A. TRADER, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT
OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, Respondent Judge, 
and 
STATE OF HAWAI‘ I and GABRIEL ALISNA, Respondents. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CR. NO. 13-1-1861) 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Petitioners’ petition for a writ 
of mandamus, the documents attached thereto and submitted in 
support thereof, and the record, it appears that, under the 
specific facts and circumstances of this matter, the respondent 
Judge’s application of the three-part test set forth in State v. 
Peseti, 101 Hawai‘ i 172, 182, 65 P.3d 119, 129 (2003) and 
decision set forth in the March 24, 2015 “Amended Decision and     IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
 
  
      
       
      
            
 
 Order Regarding In-Camera Inspection of Documents Produced by Third-Party Kamehameha Schools Relating to Hearing Held May 27, 2014” does not amount to a flagrant and manifest abuse of 
discretion. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai‘ i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 
334, 338-39 (1999) (“Where a court has discretion to act, 
mandamus will not lie to interfere with or control the exercise 
of that discretion, even when the judge has acted erroneously, unless the judge has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has 
refused to act on a subject properly before the court under 
circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty to act). Accordingly, 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai‘ i, January 21, 2016.
