AHOKOVI-LIZARES MOTORCARS, LLC and  
HESELOMI V. AHOKOVI, Petitioners, 
 
vs. 
THE HONORABLE PRESIDING JUDGE, DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD 
CIRCUIT, NORTH AND SOUTH KONA DIVISION, Respondent Judge,  
 
and

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(3DCW-13-0001805) 
 
  ORDER DENYING PETITIONS FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, and Wilson, JJ., 
Circuit Judge Valenciano, in place of Circuit Judge Garibaldi, 
retired, and Circuit Judge Bissen, assigned by reason of vacancy)  
 
  
Upon consideration of Petitioners Ahokovi-Lizares 
Motorcars, LLC and Heselomi V. Ahokovi’s petitions for a writ of 
mandamus, the respondent’s answer, the respective supporting 
documents, and the record, it appears that petitioners fail to 
demonstrate that the respondent court flagrantly and manifestly 
abused its discretion in deciding the restitution issue.  
Petitioners, therefore, are not entitled to the requested Electronically Filed
Supreme Court

      s/ Mark E. Recktenwald  
s/ Sabrina S. McKenna 
s/ Michael D. Wilson 
s/ Randal G.B. Valenciano 
s/ Richard T. Bissen  extraordinary relief.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai ʻi 200, 204-
05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an 
extraordinary remedy; where the lower court has discretion to 
act, mandamus will not lie to control the exercise of that 
discretion even when the court has acted erroneously, unless the 
judge has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a 
flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act 
on a matter that is properly before the court under 
circumstances in which he or she has a duty to act).  
Accordingly,  
  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petitions for writ of 
mandamus are denied.
