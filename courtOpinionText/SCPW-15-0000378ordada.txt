ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CAAP-15-0000315; CIVIL NO. 14-1-0379(1))
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Michael C. Greenspon’s
 
petition for a writ of mandamus, filed April 29, 2015, the
 
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
 the record, it appears that Petitioner has filed an appeal from
 the circuit court’s March 10, 2015 Order Granting in Part and
 Denying in Part Defendant OneWest Bank N.A.’s Motion for
 Protective Order, Stay, and Sanctions with the Intermediate Court
 of Appeals, docketed as CAAP-15-0000315, and may seek relief in
 the appeal. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to a writ of
 mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 
334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy 
that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action); Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of mandamus is not intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the trial courts, cure a mere legal error, or serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedure). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, May 19, 2015.
