IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
SAMUEL CARTER, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE KAREN T. NAKASONE, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF
THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent Judge,
 
and 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
On June 26, 2015, Samuel Carter (“Carter”) submitted 
for filing a document entitled “Plaintiff Samuel Carter Request 
Motion to Receive the Final Judgment and Case Number Under Rule 2.13.” In the document, Carter asks this court to compel the Honorable Karen T. Nakasone to “release the case number in the above civil matter with the Final Judgment.” Upon consideration of the petition, it appears that Carter fails to provide sufficient information for this court to determine whether mandamus relief is warranted. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 
200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner
 
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack
 of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
 obtain the requested action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied without prejudice.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerks’
 
office shall process the petition for a writ of mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, August 6, 2015.
