IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
DENNIS FLORER, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE CHRISTINE KURIYAMA, JUDGE OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent Judge,
 
and
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
  
(CR. NO. 14-1-0229)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Dennis Florerâ€™s 
petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on July 2, 2015, the 
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that Petitioner fails to demonstrate that he has a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief or that he lacks alternative means to seek relief. A writ of mandamus is, therefore, not warranted. 
See Kema v. Gaddis , 91 
Hawai'i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless
 
the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to
 relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the
 alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, August 6, 2015.
