IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
MATTHEW J. WARNER, Petitioner, 
vs. 
HAWAI# I PAROLING AUTHORITY, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION 
AND/OR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Matthew J. Warner’s 
application for writ of prohibition and/or mandamus, respondent 
Hawai# i Paroling Authority’s response, the respective supporting 
documents, and the record, it appears that the requested 
extraordinary writ is not warranted.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is 
an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action); In re Disciplinary Bd. of Hawai# i Supreme Court, 91  Hawai# i 363, 368, 984 P.2d 688, 693 (1999) 
(mandamus relief is available to compel an official to perform a 
duty allegedly owed to an individual only if the individual’s claim is clear and certain, the official’s duty is ministerial and so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt, and no other remedy is available).  Accordingly,  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu,  Hawai# i, June 23, 2020.
