MICKEY A. MADDOX, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE RHONDA LOO, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF
 
THE SECOND CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent Judge,
 
and
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CAAP-14-0001016; CIV. NO. 13-1-0900)
 
ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Mickey A. Maddox’s 
“Application for Writ of Mandamus Directed to Judge Rhonda Loo,”
 
filed on July 10, 2015, and the record, it appears that
 Petitioner is currently seeking identical relief in the circuit
 court and, therefore, the requested writ of mandamus is not
 
appropriate at this juncture. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 
200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is
 an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner
 
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack
 of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
 obtain the requested action; it is meant to restrain a judge of
 an inferior court who has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has
 committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has
 refused to act on a subject properly before the court under
 circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty to act). 
Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appellate clerks’ office
 
shall process the application for a writ of mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the application for a
 
writ of mandamus is denied without prejudice.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, July 27, 2015.
