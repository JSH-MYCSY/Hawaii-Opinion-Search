ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
  
(CIVIL NO. 12-1-2882-11)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Dianna Nalani Kupahu’s 
petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on August 3, 2015, the 
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that Petitioner is not entitled to a writ of mandamus inasmuch as she fails to demonstrate that she has a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief or that she lacks alternative means to seek relief. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 
Hawai'i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner
 
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack
 of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
 obtain the requested action). Petitioner may, as appropriate,
 seek relief in an appeal from a final judgment entered relating
 to the foreclosure sale or in her pending appeal in CAAP-15­0000447. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, August 11, 2015.
