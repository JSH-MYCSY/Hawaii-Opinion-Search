ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael C. Greenspon’s
 
petition for a writ of mandamus, filed August 24, 2015, the
 
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
 the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that
 he has a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief or
 that the respondent judge’s actions demonstrate bias, infringe
 upon petitioner’s constitutional rights, exceed the court’s
 jurisdiction, or constitute a flagrant and manifest abuse of 
discretion. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to a writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 
334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; where a court has discretion to act, mandamus will not lie to interfere with or control the exercise of that discretion, even when the judge has acted erroneously, unless the judge has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty to act). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 20, 2015.
