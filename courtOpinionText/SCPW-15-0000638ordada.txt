 Electronically Filed 
Supreme Court SCPW-15-0000638 01-SEP-2015 10:47 AM 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI I 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING  
(NO. 20220; CR. NO. 96-0078) 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Gerald Villanueva ’s 
“Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to 
Release Petitioner from Custody, ” which was filed on August 28, 
2015 as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the 
record, it appears that Petitioner is presently seeking 
identical relief in CAAP-15-0000408, and presents no special 
reason for this court to invoke its jurisdiction at this time. 
See Oili v. Chang, 57 Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976) 
(the supreme court “
will not exercise its original jurisdiction 
in habeas corpus proceedings when relief is available in a lower  
   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
habeas corpus is denied.   
 
 
      
  
        
            
        
       
 court and no special reason exists for invoking its 
jurisdiction”). Accordingly,  
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai i, September 1, 2015.
