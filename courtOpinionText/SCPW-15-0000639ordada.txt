ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CAAP-14-0001115; CAAP-15-0000484; CIV. NO. 11-1-433K)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(
By: Nakayama, Acting C.J., McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ., and
Circuit  Judge  Garibaldi,  in  place  of  Recktenwald,  C.J.,  recused.)
 
Upon consideration of petitionersâ€™ petition for a writ
 
of mandamus, filed on August 28, 2015, the documents attached
 
thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it
 appears that petitioners fail to demonstrate that the circuit
 court has a legal duty to enter their proposed final judgment
 under the current procedural posture of the case. 
Petitioners,
 therefore, are not entitled to the requested writ of mandamus. 
See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 
(1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; such is meant to restrain a judge of an inferior court who has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty to act). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, November 13, 2015.
