CARRIE J. WALTERS, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE GLENN S. HARA, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE
THIRD CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent Judge, 
and 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 09-1-0443)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Carrie Waltersâ€™s 
petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on September 15, 2015, the 
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that she is entitled to the requested writ of mandamus. See Kema v. 
Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 28, 2015.
