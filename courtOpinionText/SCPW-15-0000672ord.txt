ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Reck tenwald, C.J., Nak ayama, Mc Kenna, Po llack, an d Wilson,  JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Carrie Waltersâ€™s
petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on September 16, 2015, the
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that
she is entitled to the requested writ of mandamus.  See Kema v.
Gaddis, 91 Hawai #i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue
unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right
to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately
the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action).  Accordingly, Electronically Filed
Supreme Court
SCPW-15-0000672
28-OCT-2015
09:00 AMIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai #i, October 28, 2015.
