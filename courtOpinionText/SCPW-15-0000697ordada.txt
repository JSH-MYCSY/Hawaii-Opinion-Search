IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Petitioner, 
vs. 
THE HONORABLE GLENN S. HARA, Judge of the Circuit Court
of the Third Circuit, State of Hawai' i, Respondent Judge, 
and 
XAVIER J. CORTEZ, JR. aka PEE WEE, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 15-1-0043)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION OR, IN THE
ALTERNATIVE, FOR AN ORDER STAYING PROCEEDINGS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, J.J.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner State of Hawai' i’s 
petition for a writ of prohibition or, in the alternative, for an 
order staying proceedings, filed on September 24, 2015, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that an appeal from the circuit court’s pretrial orders issued in the underlying criminal proceeding is pending in the Intermediate Court of Appeals (CAAP-15-0000481) and petitioner fails to demonstrate that extraordinary relief is warranted from this court. See Gannett Pac. Corp. v. Richardson,
 
59 Haw. 224, 226, 580 P.2d 49, 53 (1978) (a writ of prohibition
 
is not meant to serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal
 appellate procedures; rather, it is available in “rare and
 exigent circumstances” where “allow[ing] the matter to wend its
 way through the appellate process would not be in the public
 interest and would work upon the public irreparable harm”); HRAP
 Rule 8(c). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
prohibition is denied.
