ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
  
(CIVIL NO. 13-1-0842-03)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, J.J.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner’s petition for a writ
 
of mandamus, filed on October 2, 2015, the documents attached
 
thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it
 appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that she has a clear
 and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means
 to seek relief as petitioner may seek relief, as appropriate,
 once a final, appealable judgment is entered in the case. 
Additionally, petitioner fails to demonstrate that the respondent
 judge has exceeded his jurisdiction or committed a flagrant and 
manifest abuse of discretion in presiding over the partition action. See HRS § 668-1 (governing actions for partition). 
Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the relief requested. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 
(1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; such a writ is meant to restrain a judge of an inferior court who has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty to act). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, December 23, 2015.
