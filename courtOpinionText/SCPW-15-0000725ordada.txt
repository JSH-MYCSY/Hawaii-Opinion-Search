EMERSON M.F. JOU, M.D., Petitioner, 
vs. 
THE HONORABLE GARY W.B. CHANG, Judge of the Circuit Court
of the First Circuit, State of Hawai' i, Respondent Judge, 
and 
HEMIC, aka Hawaii Employers Medical Insurance Company,
an Entity, Form Unknown, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-1529-07)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION
 
OR FOR SUPERVISORY WRIT
 
(By: Nakayama, Acting C.J., McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, J.J.,
and Circuit Judge Alm, in place of Recktenwald, C.J., recused)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Emerson M.F. Jou,
 
M.D.’s petition for a writ of prohibition or for a supervisory
 
writ, filed on October 7, 2015, the documents attached thereto
 and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that
 petitioner’s case is not one in which the question of
 disqualification cannot otherwise be reviewed and immediate
 review by way of a writ of prohibition is not warranted. 
Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the relief requested. 
See Peters v. Jamieson, 48 Haw. 247, 257, 397 P.2d 575, 582
 
(1964) (“[A] writ of prohibition will lie to compel a trial judge
 to recuse him[] or [her]self because of bias or prejudice which
 appears from the record, where . . . the case is one in which the
 question of disqualification cannot otherwise be reviewed.”). 
Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
prohibition is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, November 25, 2015. 
/s/ Paula A. Nakayama /s/ Sabrina S. McKenna /s/ Richard W. Pollack /s/ Michael D. Wilson /s/ Steven S. Alm
