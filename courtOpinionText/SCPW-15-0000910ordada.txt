ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CAAP-15-0000707; CIVIL NO. 14-1-1218-05)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF SUPERINTENDING CONTROL
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Diane E. Mather’s
 
petition for a writ of superintending control, which was filed on
 
November 30, 2015, and which we review as a petition for a writ
 of mandamus, the documents attached thereto and submitted in
 support thereof, and the record, it appears that Petitioner has
 filed an appeal in the Intermediate Court of Appeals (CAAP-15­0000707) and, therefore, may raise the issues in the petition and
 seek to extend the deadline for the filing of the opening brief
 in the appeal. Petitioner is not entitled to the requested
 extraordinary writ. See, e.g., Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 
204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an 
extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
superintending control is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, December 14, 2015.
