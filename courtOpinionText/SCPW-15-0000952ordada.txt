PAUL KAUKA CULLEN, also known as PAUL KAUKA NAKI, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE ADRIANNE N. HEELY, JUDGE OF THE DISTRICT COURT
OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT, MOLOKA' I DIVISION, STATE OF HAWAI 'I,
Respondent Judge,
 
and
 
RICHARD P. PERREIRA and GWENDOLYN H. PERREIRA, Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(DC CIVIL NO. 13-1-0122)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Paul Kauka Cullenâ€™s 
petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on December 24, 2015, the 
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that he has a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief or a lack of alternative means to seek relief at this time. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to a writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not
 
issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable
 right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress
 adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). 
Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 20, 2016.
