IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
CHRISTOPHER GRINDLING, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I
 
and STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondents.
 
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NOS. 15-1-0347(2), 15-1-0564(4), and 15-1-0968(3))
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Christopher 
Grindlingâ€™s petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on December 
30, 2015, and the record, it appears that Petitioner fails to demonstrate that he has a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief or that he lacks alternative means to seek relief. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 
P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the
 
requested action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk of the
 
appellate court shall process the petition for a writ mandamus
 without payment of the filing fee. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 20, 2016.
