WILLIAM HALEMANO FREDERICK and MARY KATHERINE FREDERICK,
Petitioners,

CENTRAL PACIFIC BANK and SEA COUNTRY COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION,
Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CAAP-15-0000425; CIVIL NO. 14-1-2199-10)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION
 
(
By: Nakayama, Acting C.J., McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ., and
Circuit Judge Browning, in place of Recktenwald, C.J., recused)
 
Upon consideration of petitioners William Halemano
 
Frederick and Mary Katherine Frederick’s petition for writ of
 
prohibition, filed January 26, 2016, the documents attached
 thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it
 appears that petitioners fail to demonstrate that they are
 entitled to the requested writ of prohibition. See Honolulu
 
Adv., Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a
 writ of prohibition “is an extraordinary remedy . . . to restrain
 a judge of an inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of
 
his jurisdiction”); Gannett Pac. Corp. v. Richardson, 59 Haw.
 224, 226, 580 P.2d 49, 53 (1978) (a writ of prohibition is not
 meant to serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate
 procedures; rather, it is available in “rare and exigent
 circumstances” where “allow[ing] the matter to wend its way
 through the appellate process would not be in the public interest
 and would work upon the public irreparable harm”). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
prohibition is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, March 3, 2016.
