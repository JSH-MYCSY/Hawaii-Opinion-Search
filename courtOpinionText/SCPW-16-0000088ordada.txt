ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIVIL NO. 14-1-2135-10)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, J.J.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Yurie Yamanoâ€™s 
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on February 17, 2016, and 
the record, it appears that judgment was entered in the underlying case on August 20, 2015. Petitioner fails to demonstrate that she is entitled to mandamus relief. See Kema v. 
Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; such a writ is meant to restrain a judge of an inferior court who has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest
 
abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly
 before the court under circumstances in which he or she has a
 legal duty to act). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, March 15, 2016.
