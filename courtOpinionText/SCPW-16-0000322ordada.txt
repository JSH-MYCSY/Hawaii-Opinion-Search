ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV. No. 1RC15-1-7933)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND/OR PROHIBITION
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Seong Ho Ji and GX
 
Auto, Inc.â€™s petition for writ of mandamus and/or prohibition,
 
filed April 7, 2016, the documents attached thereto and submitted
 in support thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioners
 fail to demonstrate that they have a clear and indisputable right
 to the requested relief or that they lack alternative means to
 seek relief. Petitioners, therefore, are not entitled to an
 extraordinary writ. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 
P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary 
remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action); Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of mandamus and a writ of prohibition are extraordinary remedies meant to, among other things, restrain a judge of an inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of his or her jurisdiction; they are not intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the trial courts, cure a mere legal error, or serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedure). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus and/or prohibition is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, May 4, 2016.
