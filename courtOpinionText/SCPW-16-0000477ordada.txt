THE HONORABLE KARL K. SAKAMOTO, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV.
 NO. 08-0522-02)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioners Felix Dacanay, as
 
personal representative of the Estate of Roger Roxas, and The
 
Golden Budha Corporationâ€™s petition for writ of mandamus, filed
 on June 17, 2016, the documents attached thereto and submitted in
 support thereof, and the record, it appears that Petitioners fail
 to demonstrate that they are entitled to the specific relief they
 seek at this time. Petitioners, therefore, are not entitled to
 the requested writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 
200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an 
extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, August 1, 2016.
