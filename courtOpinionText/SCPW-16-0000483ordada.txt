ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV. NO. 1RC16-1-3064)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Donald Courtney 
Brownâ€™s petition for an emergency writ of mandamus, filed on June 
22, 2016, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support 
thereof, and the record, it appears that, at this time, 
petitioner is seeking relief in the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
in CAAP-16-0000485 and may seek further relief from any final 
order or judgment entered in the underlying action, as 
appropriate. Petitioner, therefore, fails to demonstrate that he 
is entitled to the requested emergency writ of mandamus. See 
Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will
 
not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and
 
indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to
 
redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
 
action); Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241,
 
580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of mandamus is not intended to
 
supersede the legal discretionary authority of the trial courts,
 
cure a mere legal error, or serve as a legal remedy in lieu of
 
normal appellate procedure). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, June 30, 2016.
