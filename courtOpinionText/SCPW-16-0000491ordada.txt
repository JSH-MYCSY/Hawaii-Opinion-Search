WALTER R. SCHOETTLE, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, and RICHARD A. PLATEL, CHIEF
DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Respondents.
 
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
  
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the May 10, 2016 petition for a 
writ of mandmamus submitted by Petitioner attorney Walter R. 
Schoettle, this court concludes nothing in the petition or the attached exhibits supports the conclusion that the Office of Disciplinary Counsel has violated a duty owed this court, or abused the discretion delegated to it by this court to investigate the allegations of misconduct lodged by the Petitioner. See Breiner v. Sunderland, 112 Hawai' i 60, 64-65, 
143 P.3d 1262, 1266-67 (2006); In re Disciplinary Bd. of the Hawai'i Supreme Court, 91 Hawai' i 363, 368-71, 984 P.2d 688, 693Â­
96 (1999); Akinaka v. Disciplinary Bd. of the Hawai' i Supreme 
Court, 91 Hawai' i 51, 57, 979 P.2d 1077, 1083 (1999). 
Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, July 15, 2016.
