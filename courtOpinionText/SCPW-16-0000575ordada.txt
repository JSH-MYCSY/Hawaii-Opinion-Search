KIMBERLYN SCOTT and BROOKE SCOTT, Petitioners,

THE HONORABLE JOSEPH E. CARDOZA, Judge of the Circuit Court of
the Second Circuit, State of Hawai' i, Respondent Judge,
 
and
 
STEVEN CAPOBIANCO and STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 16-1-0133)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, J.J.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioners Kimberlyn Scott and 
Brooke Scottâ€™s petition for writ of mandamus, filed on August 18, 
2016, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioners do not have a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief and, therefore, they are not entitled to the requested writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 
334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
 
action; such a writ is meant to restrain a judge of an inferior
 court who has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a
 flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act
 on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in
 which he or she has a legal duty to act). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, August 30, 2016.
