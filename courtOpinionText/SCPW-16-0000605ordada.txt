'I 
RICHARD L. HOLCOMB, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE JAMES H. ASHFORD, Judge of the District Court of
the First Circuit, State of Hawai' i, Respondent Judge, 
and
 
THE STATE OF HAWAI' I and ERIC KOBASHIGAWA, Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-16-01292)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND/OR PROHIBITION
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Richard L. Holcombâ€™s 
petition for writ of mandamus and/or prohibition, filed on
 
September 1, 2016, the documents attached thereto and submitted
 in support thereof, and the record, it appears that, at this
 time, petitioner fails to demonstrate that he has a clear and
 indisputable right to the requested relief or that he lacks
 alternative means to seek relief. Petitioner, therefore, is not
 entitled to the requested writ of mandamus and/or writ of
 prohibition. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 
334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy 
that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; it is meant to restrain a judge of an inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of his or her jurisdiction); Honolulu Adv., Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of prohibition is an extraordinary remedy that is meant to restrain a judge of an inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of his jurisdiction). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus and/or prohibition is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, September 16, 2016.
