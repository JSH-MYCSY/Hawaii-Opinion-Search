vs.
 
THE HONORABLE KARL K. SAKAMOTO, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT

LORNA GAGNON, PRESTIGE REALTY GROUP LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY,

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV. NO. 13-1-2328-08)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Prudential Locations, 
LLCâ€™s petition for writ of mandamus, filed on September 8, 2016, 
the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that Petitioners fail to demonstrate that they have a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief or lack alternative means to seek relief at this time. Petitioners, therefore, are not entitled to the requested writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that
 
will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and
 indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to
 redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
 action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 21, 2016.
