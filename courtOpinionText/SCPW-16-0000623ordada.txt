ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-16-01849)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND/OR PROHIBITION
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ., and
Circuit Judge Ayabe, in place of Nakayama, J., recused)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Lawrence Suan’s
 
petition for writ of mandamus and/or prohibition, filed on
 
September 16, 2016, the documents attached thereto and submitted
 
in support thereof, and the record, it appears that, at this
 
time, petitioner fails to demonstrate that he has a clear and
 
indisputable right to the requested relief, that the respondent
 
judge has exceeded his jurisdiction in presiding over the case,
 
that the respondents are not performing a ministerial duty, or
 
that he lacks alternative means to seek relief. 
Petitioner,
 therefore, is not entitled to the requested writ of mandamus 
and/or writ of prohibition. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 
204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner 
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack 
of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or 
obtain the requested action; it is meant to restrain a judge of 
an inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of his or her 
jurisdiction); Barnett v. Broderick, 84 Hawai' i 109, 111, 929 
P.2d 1359, 1361 (1996) (a writ of mandamus is available to compel an official to perform a duty allegedly owed to an individual 
only if the individual’s claim is clear and certain, the 
official’s duty is ministerial and so plainly prescribed as to be 
free from doubt, and no other remedy is available); Honolulu 
Adv., Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a 
writ of prohibition is an extraordinary remedy that is meant to 
restrain a judge of an inferior court from acting beyond or in 
excess of his jurisdiction). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus and/or prohibition is denied.
