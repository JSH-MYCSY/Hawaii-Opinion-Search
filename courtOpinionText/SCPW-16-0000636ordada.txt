ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV. NO. 15-1-0087)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Commercial Properties,
 
Limited’s petition for writ of mandamus, filed on September 23,
 
2016, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support
 thereof, and the record, it appears that, based on the facts and
 circumstances of the underlying matter, petitioner fails to
 demonstrate that it has a clear and indisputable right to the
 requested relief and that it lacks alternative means to seek
 relief. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested 
writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 982 
P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; where a court has discretion to act, mandamus will not lie to interfere with or control the exercise of that discretion, even when the judge has acted erroneously, unless the judge has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty to act). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
