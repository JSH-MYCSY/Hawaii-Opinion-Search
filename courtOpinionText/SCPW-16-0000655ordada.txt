ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV. NO. 13-1-2513-09)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Gabi Kim Collinsâ€™s 
petition for an emergency writ of mandamus, filed on October 5, 
2016, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support 
thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to 
demonstrate that she has a clear and indisputable right to the 
requested relief and that she lacks alternative means to seek 
relief. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to an emergency 
writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 
982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner 
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
 
obtain the requested action); Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao,
 
59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of mandamus is
 
not intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of
 
the trial courts, cure a mere legal error, or serve as a legal
 
remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedure). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 21, 2016.
