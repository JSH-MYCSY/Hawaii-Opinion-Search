ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV. NO. 15-1-0087)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitionersâ€™ petition for writ of
 
mandamus, filed on October 17, 2016, the documents attached
 
thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it
 appears that petitioners are currently seeking relief in the
 Intermediate Court of Appeals in CAAP-16-0000820. Petitioners,
 therefore, fail to demonstrate that they are entitled to the 
requested writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 
204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, December 29, 2016.
