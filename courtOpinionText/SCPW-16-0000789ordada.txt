VICTOR ESTRADA, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE MARGARET K. MASUNAGA, Judge of the District Court
of the Third Circuit, Kona District, Respondent Judge,
 
and
 
STATE OF HAWAIʻ I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
  
(CASE NO. 3DTA-14-01510)
 
ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE PETITION
 
FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS OR FOR OTHER RELIEF
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Victor Estrada’s 
“Petition for Writ of Mandamus or for Other Relief,” filed on 
November 7, 2016, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner has filed an appeal in the Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) in CAAP-16-0000682, and may seek the requested relief in that court, as appropriate. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawaiʻ i 200, 204, 982 
P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative
 
means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the
 requested action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus is denied without prejudice to petitioner seeking relief
 from the ICA in CAAP-16-0000682, as appropriate.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerks’
 
office shall process the petition for writ of mandamus without
 payment of the filing fee. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, November 10, 2016.
