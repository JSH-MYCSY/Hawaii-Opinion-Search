JOHN ANTONI, N.C. DYLAN WILLOUGHBY and ANTONI ALBUS, LLP,

vs. 
 
THE HONORABLE RHONDA I.L. LOO et al., Respondents. 
                                                                  
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS OR  
FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
 
  Upon consideration of John Antoni’s and N.C. Dylan 
Willoughby’s Petition for a Writ of Mandamus or of Prohibition, 
filed on November 17, 2016, we conclude the Petitioners fail to 
demonstrate they are entitled to the requested relief because 
the Petitioners failed to establish their right to relief is 
indisputable.  See Kema v. Gaddis,  91 Hawaiʻ i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 
334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy 
that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means 
to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested Electronically Filed

 action); Barnett v. Broderick , 84 Hawaiʻi 109, 111, 929 P.2d 
1359, 1361 (1996) (mandamus relief is available to compel an 
official to perform a duty allegedly owed to an individual only 
if the individual’s claim is clear and certain, the official’s 
duty is ministerial and so plainly prescribed as to be free from 
doubt, and no other remedy is available); Honolulu Advertiser, 
Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ 
of prohibition is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable 
right to relief and a lack of alternative means to address 
adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; 
such a writ is not intended to supersede the legal discretionary 
authority of the trial courts, cure a mere legal error or serve 
as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedure).  
Accordingly, 
  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
mandamus or for prohibition is denied.
