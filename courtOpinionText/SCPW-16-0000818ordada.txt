ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIVIL NO. 15-1-0034-01)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND/OR PROHIBITION
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioners Hugo Parker, LLP, 
Edward R. Hugo, Esq., and Anthony Bentivegna, Esq.’s petition for 
writ of mandamus and/or prohibition, filed on November 18, 2016, the documents submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioners are seeking relief in the Intermediate Court of Appeals in CAAP-17-0000016 and fail to demonstrate that they are entitled to the relief requested from this court. See 
Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right
 
to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately
 the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; where a court
 has discretion to act, mandamus will not lie to interfere with or
 control the exercise of that discretion, even when the judge has
 acted erroneously, unless the judge has exceeded his or her
 jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of
 discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before
 the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty
 to act); Honolulu Adv., Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d
 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of prohibition “is an extraordinary remedy
 . . . to restrain a judge of an inferior court from acting beyond
 or in excess of his jurisdiction;” it is not meant to serve as a
 legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedures). 
Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, February 13, 2017.
