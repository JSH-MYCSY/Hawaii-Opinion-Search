IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI
'I 
TATE ANDALE, INC., Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE RHONDA A. NISHIMURA, Judge of the Circuit Court
of the First Circuit, State of Hawai' i, Respondent Judge,
 
and
 
RODNEY A. FELICIANO and BEATRICE L. FELICIANO, Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIVIL NO. 16-1-0141-01)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND/OR PROHIBITION
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Tate Andale, Inc.’s 
petition for writ of mandamus and/or prohibition, filed on 
November 18, 2016, the documents submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioners fail to demonstrate that they are entitled to the relief requested from this court. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) 
(a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; where a court has discretion to act, mandamus will not lie to interfere with or control the exercise of that discretion, even
 
when the judge has acted erroneously, unless the judge has
 exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and
 manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject
 properly before the court under circumstances in which he or she
 has a legal duty to act); Honolulu Adv., Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw.
 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of prohibition “is an
 extraordinary remedy . . . to restrain a judge of an inferior
 court from acting beyond or in excess of his jurisdiction;” it is
 not meant to serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate
 procedures). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, February 13, 2017.
