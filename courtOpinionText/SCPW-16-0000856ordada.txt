ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner SPD II Makaiwa Resort
Development, LLC’s petition for writ of mandamus, filed on
December 9, 2016, the documents attached thereto and submitted in
support thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner fails
to demonstrate that it has a clear and indisputable right to the
requested relief and may raise its concerns in the pending matter
before the Department of Land and Natural Resources or in any
subsequent appeal, as appropriate.  Petitioner, therefore, is not
entitled to the requested writ of mandamus.  See Kema v. Gaddis ,
91 Hawai# i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus
is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless theElectronically Filed

Hawai#i 109, 111, 929 P.2d 1359, 1361 (1996) (a writ of mandamus
is available to compel an official to perform a duty allegedly
owed to an individual only if the individual’s claim is clear and
certain, the official’s duty is ministerial and so plainly
prescribed as to be free from doubt, and no other remedy is
available).  Accordingly,  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
mandamus is denied.
