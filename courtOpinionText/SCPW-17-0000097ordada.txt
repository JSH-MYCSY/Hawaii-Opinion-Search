ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Miti Maugaotega, Jr.’s
 
“Complaint for Writ of Habeas Corpus,” filed on February 24,
 
2017, which we review as a petition for writ of habeas corpus,
 
the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof,
 
and the record, it appears that, based on the specific facts and
 
circumstances presented in the petition, petitioner may seek
 
relief in his criminal case in the Pinal County Superior Court in
 
Arizona and presents no sufficient reason for this court to
 
invoke its jurisdiction at this time. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
habeas corpus is denied.
