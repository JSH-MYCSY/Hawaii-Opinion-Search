ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CR. NO. 11-1-001K) 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner John Wagner’s petition 
for writ of mandamus, filed on June 27, 2017, the documents 
attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that, on May 4, 2017, this court issued a published opinion vacating the ICA’s judgment, which affirmed the underlying conviction and sentence, and remanding the matter to the circuit court for a new trial. Petitioner may therefore seek relief, as appropriate, in the circuit court proceeding. See 
Kema v. Gaddis , 91 Hawai #i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai #i, July 5, 2017.
