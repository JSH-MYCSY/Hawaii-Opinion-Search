CHRISTOPHER LEE SLAVICK, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE EDWIN NACINO, Judge of the Circuit Court of the
First Circuit, State of Hawai' i, Respondent Judge,
 
and
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
  
(CR. NO. 01-13-1461)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Christopher Lee
 
Slavickâ€™s petition for writ of mandamus, filed on August 7, 2017, 
and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate
 that he is entitled to the requested writ of mandamus. See Kema
 
v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ 
of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus is denied.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk of the
 
appellate court shall process the petition for writ of mandamus
 
without payment of the filing fee.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, August 21, 2017.
