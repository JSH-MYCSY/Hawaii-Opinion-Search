ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Nakayama, Acting C.J., McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.,
and Circuit Judge Nacino, in place of Recktenwald, C.J., recused)
 
Upon consideration of petitionersâ€™ petition for writ of
 
mandamus and for a stay, filed on August 30, 2017, the documents
 
attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the
 record, it appears that petitioners fail to demonstrate that they
 have a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief or
 that they lack alternative means to seek relief. Petitioners,
 therefore, are not entitled to an extraordinary writ. See Kema
 
v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ 
of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the
 
alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus, including the request for a stay, is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, September 14, 2017. 
/s/ Paula A. Nakayama /s/ Sabrina S. McKenna /s/ Richard W. Pollack /s/ Michael D. Wilson /s/ Edwin C. Nacino
