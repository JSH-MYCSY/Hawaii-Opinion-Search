ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CASE NO. 2FC16-1-000394(4))
  
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Hau Phanâ€™s petition 
for writ of mandamus, filed on September 9, 2017, and the record, 
it appears that petitioner has filed an appeal from the judgment of conviction and sentence in the Intermediate Court of Appeals in CAAP-17-0000542 and, therefore, may seek relief in accordance to HRAP Rule 9(b), as appropriate. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested mandamus relief from this court. See 
Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately
 
the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, September 26, 2017.
