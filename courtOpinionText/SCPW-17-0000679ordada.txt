IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
GALINA OGEONE, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE JEFFREY P. CRABTREE, Judge of the Circuit Court of
the First Circuit, State of Hawai' i, Respondent Judge,
 
and
 
DENTIST LESLIE AU, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV. NOS. 16-1-1347-7 and 16-1-1348-7)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Galina Ogeoneâ€™s 
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on September 25, 2017, the 
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, the supplemental submissions, and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that she has a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief or that the respondent judge exceeded his jurisdiction or committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested writ of mandamus. See Kema v. Gaddis, 
91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless
 
the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to
 relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the
 alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; where a court has
 discretion to act, mandamus will not lie to interfere with or
 control the exercise of that discretion, even when the judge has
 acted erroneously, unless the judge has exceeded his or her
 jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of
 discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before
 the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty
 to act). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 24, 2017.
