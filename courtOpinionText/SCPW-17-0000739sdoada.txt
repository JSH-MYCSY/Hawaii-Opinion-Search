SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)  
 
  Petitioner  Randall Abe  seeks a writ of mandamus 
directing the Honorable Paula Devens (Judge Devens) to release 
him from custody forthwith pursuant to  the requirement that a 
defendant be released upon motion if a preliminary hearing has 
not commenced within two days of the defendant’s initial 
appearance.  See Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure  (HRPP) Rule

   On October 11, 2017 , Abe was arrested  for terroristic 
threatening in the first degree and assault in the second 
degree.  On October 13, 2017, a complaint charging Abe with the 
offenses for which he was arrested was filed in  the District 
Court of the First Circuit (district court).   
  A preliminary hearing was scheduled for October 17, 
2017.  At the scheduled hearing, the State requested to continue 
the hearing for one week, explaining that the complaining 
witness had not be en served with a subpoena.  The State  
indicated that the complaining witness had been in contact with 
its investigator and that it had no information that the 
complaining witness was not cooperative.  The State added that 
the complaining witness lives in l ow-income housing in Kapolei 
and thus transportation may be an issue.  Abe objected  to the 
requested continuance , arguing that there was no good cause for 
the continuance given that the complaining witness had been in 
contact with the State’s investigator.  Abe requested that the 
matter be dismissed and that Abe be released on his own 
recognizance forthwith.  In the alternative, Abe requested that 
bail be reduced or that, if the court was inclined to continue, 
the hearing be continued  for no more than one day.   
  The distri ct court found that there was good cause for 
a continuance and continued the hearing for one week; the court 
also denied Abe’s request for reduction of bail.  On October 24, ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 2017, while this petition  was pending , the State charged Abe  by 
grand jury indictment.   
  In his petition, Abe contends that , pursuant to HRPP 
Rule 5(c)(3), Judge Devens was required to release him on his 
own recognizance upon his re quest because a preliminary hearing 
did not commence within two days after his initial appearance.  
HRPP Rule 5(c)(3) provides in relevant part as follows:  
if the defendant is held in custody for a period of more 
than 2 days after initial appearance with out commencement 
of a defendant’ s preliminary hearing, the court, on motion 
of the defendant, shall release the defendant to appear on 
the defendant’s own recognizance, unless failure of such 
determination or commencement is caused by the request, 
action or condition of the defendant,  or occurred with the 
defendant’ s consent, or is attributable to such compelling 
fact or circumstance which would preclude such 
determination or commencement within the prescribed period, 
or unless such compelling fact or circu mstance would render 
such release to be against the interest of justice.  
In Moana v. Wong, No. SCPW -17-0000532, 2017 WL 5591471 , at *8-10 
(Haw. Nov. 21, 2017),  we held that HRPP Rule 5(c)(3) provides a 
strong presumption that the release of a defendant he ld in 
custody is required upon motion , when a preliminary hearing has 
not commenced within two days of initial appearance.  When a 
delay is not caused by a defendant a nd occurs without the 
defendant’s consent, a court may deny a defendant’ s motion for 
release only in a circumstance that is of such gravity as to 
overcome the strong presumption of release.   Id.  If such a 
compelling circumstance is found, the continuance of the ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
4 
 preliminary hearing must be no longer than needed to resolve the 
circumstance making the delay necessary.   Id.   
  Based on Moana, the record does not indicate that any 
compelling fact or circumstance was implicated in Abe’s case.   
And even if there was a compelling fact or circumstance , the 
continuance was not limited to the time necessary to 
expeditiously resolve the circumstance precluding the hearing.   
However, because Abe was charged by grand jury indictment during 
the pendency of this petition , which obviates the need for a 
preliminary hearing,  the petition is moot.   See id. at *3-5.  
Accordingly, 
  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Abe’s  petition  is denied . 
  DATED: Honolulu, Hawaii, December 22 , 2017.
