ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of petitioners Michael Eric O’Toole 
and Diane Zerfuss O’Toole’s petition for writ of mandamus, the 
respective supporting documents, and the record, it appears that the requested extraordinary relief is not warranted. See Kema v. 
Gaddis, 91 Hawai‘ i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of  mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless 
the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; it is meant to restrain a judge of an inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of his or her jurisdiction). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 25, 2020.
