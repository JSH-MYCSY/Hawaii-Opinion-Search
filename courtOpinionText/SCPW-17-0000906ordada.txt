IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
HONOLULU CIVIL BEAT INC., Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
HONOLULU CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Honolulu Civil Beat 
Inc.’s petition for writ of mandamus, filed on December 20, 2017, 
the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that it has a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief or lacks alternative means to seek relief. See Kema v. 
Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of 
mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action); see also HRS §§ 92-5 and 92-6(a)(6)(D). Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 31, 2018. 
/s/ Mark E. Recktenwald 
/s/ Paula A. Nakayama /s/ Sabrina S. McKenna /s/ Richard W. Pollack /s/ Michael D. Wilson
