FRANCIS GRANDINETTI, Petitioner,
vs.
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY ET AL., Respondents.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the document submitted by
petitioner Francis Grandinetti entitled, “On Motion: Private
Wardens’ Contracting for Hilo, HI,” which was filed on December
21, 2017, and which we review as a petition for writ of habeas
corpus, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support
thereof, and the record, it is unclear what specific relief
petitioner is seeking from this court; nevertheless, petitioner
presents no special reason for invoking the supreme court’s
original jurisdiction and fails to demonstrate that he has a
clear an indisputable right to relief from this court at this
time.  See Oili v. Chang , 57 Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 788
(1976) (the supreme court “will not exercise its original
jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings when relief is
available in a lower court and no special reason exists forElectronically Filed
