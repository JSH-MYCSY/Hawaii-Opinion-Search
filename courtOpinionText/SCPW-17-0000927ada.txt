APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
AUGUST 4, 2025 
 
RECKTENWALD, C.J., McKENNA, EDDINS, AND GINOZA, JJ., 
AND CIRCUIT JUDGE VIOLA, IN PLACE OF DEVENS, J., RECUSED 
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J. 
Courts must “seal or otherwise remove” all records 
pertaining to a qualifying person’s “judiciary files” from the 
“judiciary’s publicly accessible electronic databases.” Hawaiʻi 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 831-3.2(f) (2014 & Supp. 2024). 
HRS § 831-3.2(f) recognizes privacy and restorative 
interests for those arrested for, or charged with, but not 
convicted of a crime, those wrongly convicted, and those who 
have had a charge dismissed following a deferred acceptance of a 
guilty or no contest plea. 
Jerome Rogan qualified “to seal or otherwise remove” his 
court records because his case ended without conviction. 
Alan 
Ahn qualified because a court granted a deferred acceptance of 
his no contest plea, and later per HRS § 853-1 (2014), the 
charges against him were dismissed. 
Rogan and Ahn ask this court to seal their cases. Both had 
received expungement certificates from the Department of the 
Attorney General. 
Nick Grube objects to Ahn’s request. 
2  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
We consolidated Rogan’s and Ahn’s cases and invited 
briefing from the Department of the Attorney General and the 
Office of the Public Defender. 
HRS § 831-3.2(f)’s “seal or otherwise remove” language 
gives a court two choices. The court may remove the pertinent 
judicial files from the “judiciary’s publicly accessible 
electronic databases” or it may seal the records. Because 
sealing impacts the Hawaiʻ i Constitution’s article I, section 4 
right to public access, a court must comply with procedural and 
substantive measures if it decides to seal. 
We hold that Rogan’s and Ahn’s judicial records must be 
removed from eCourt Kōkua, the judiciary’s publicly accessible 
electronic database, but the judicial records must remain 
publicly accessible for in-person review at the courthouse. 
I. 
We start with HRS § 831-3.2, titled “Expungement orders.” 
HRS § 831-3.2 promotes privacy and restorative interests by 
avoiding the substantial effects disclosure of records may have on a person’s employment, housing, lending, and educational 
options. See
 2023 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 159, § 1 at 478 (amending 
HRS § 831-3.2(f) and identifying these interests in the preamble). 
Hawaiʻi
 has a sim
ple path to expungement relief.  Per HRS 
§ 831-3.2, expungement is available to those (1) “arrested for, 
3  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
or charged with but not convicted of a crime”; (2) “found 
eligible for redress under [HRS] chapter 661B”; or (3) who had a 
charge dismissed after a deferred acceptance of a guilty or no 
contest plea. HRS § 831-3.2(a); HRS chapter 661B; and HRS 
§ 853-1(e). 
Eligible persons may submit a “written application” to the 
attorney general or the attorney general’s authorized 
representative to obtain an expungement order. HRS § 831-3.2(a). The Department of the Attorney General must then “issue 
an expungement order annulling, canceling, and rescinding the 
record of arrest.” Id.The expungement order prompts county 
and state law enforcement agencies to forward the person’s arrest records to the attorney general for placement in a 
“confidential file.” HRS § 831-3.2(c). It also induces the 
attorney general or their authorized representative (Hawaiʻ i 
Criminal Justice Data Center) to issue a certificate that allows 
the person to represent they have “no record regarding the 
specific arrest.” HRS § 831-3.2(e). 
The legislature added subsection (f) to HRS § 831-3.2 in 
2016. The expungement statute no longer related to only arrest records. A person with an expungement order could now ask the 
court to “seal or otherwise remove all judiciary files” 
associated with the arrest: 
4  
    
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(f) Any person for whom an expungement order has been 
entered may request in writing that the court seal or 
otherwise remove all judiciary files and other information 
pertaining to the applicable arrest or case from the 
judiciary’s publicly accessible electronic databases. The 
court shall make good faith diligent efforts to seal or 
otherwise remove the applicable files and information 
within a reasonable time. 
2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, § 66 at 772-73. 
Act 231 amended several laws related to criminal 
prosecution recommended by the Penal Code Review Committee. 
2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, § 1 at 733-34. 
In 2015, pursuant 
to House Concurrent Resolution No. 155, the Penal Code Review Committee convened to review and provide recommended revisions 
to the 
Hawaiʻi Penal Code.  Penal Code Review Committee, 
Report
of the Committee to Review and Recommend Revisions to the Hawaiʻi 
Penal Code
 1 (Dec. 30, 2015), https://www.courts. 
state.hi.us/docs/news_and_reports_docs/2015_PENAL_CODE_REVIEW_RE 
PORT-FINAL-12-30-15.pdf [https://perma.cc/5G9R-FPVH] (2015 Penal 
Review Report); H.C.R. No. 155, S.D. 1, 28th Leg., Reg. Sess. 
(2015). 
As to HRS § 831-3.2, the Committee proposed amendments “so 
that persons who have obtained an expungement order may request in writing that the court seal or remove judiciary files or 
judiciary information from public access, including from the 
judiciary’s electronic databases.” 2015 Penal Review Report at 
10. The legislature rejected that approach. Compare 2015 Penal 
Review Report at 73 (“seal or otherwise remove all judiciary 
5  
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
files and other information relating to the expunged offense, 
including from the judiciary’s electronic databases, from public 
access”) (emphasis added), with 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, 
§ 66 at 772-73 (“seal or otherwise remove all judiciary files 
and other information pertaining to the applicable arrest or 
case from the judiciary’s publicly accessible electronic 
databases”). 
In 2023, the legislature revised HRS § 831-3.2(f). 
Effective July 1, 2025, the law now mandates that the judiciary seal or otherwise remove the case records for anyone with an 
expungement order. Requests for relief are no longer necessary. 
2023 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 159, §§ 2, 4 at 478 (“The court shall 
seal or otherwise remove from the judiciary’s publicly 
accessible electronic databases all judiciary files and other 
information pertaining to the applicable arrest or case of any 
person for whom an expungement order listing the court case 
number has been entered and transmitted to the court.”). 
In 2025, the legislature amended HRS § 831-3.2(f) again. 
It gives the Hawaiʻi Criminal Justice Data Center the authority 
to transmit expungement orders to the judiciary. Act 3, H.B. 
145, H.D. 1, § 1 (signed Apr. 10, 2025). The amendment also 
provided that the “court’s duties” do not apply “where the 
person for whom the order has been entered[] . . . [i]s only one 
of multiple defendants in the case at least one of whom has not 
6  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
been the subject of a prior expungement order.” Id. at § 2. 
Citing HRS § 831-3.2, Jerome Rogan and Alan Ahn (Movants), 
both self-represented, filed letters with this court requesting 
to seal their case files. Those court records include 
frequently cited opinions. State v. Rogan, 91 Hawaiʻ i 405, 984 
P.2d 1231 (1999); Grube v. Trader, 142 Hawaiʻ i 412, 420 P.3d 343 
(2018) (Grube I). 
Rogan’s case is straightforward. In 1998, a jury found him 
guilty of four counts of sexual assault in the third degree. 
This court reversed Rogan’s conviction. 
Prosecutorial 
misconduct tainted the case. It was so egregious that Hawaiʻ i’s 
double jeopardy clause, article I, section 10, prevented re-
trial. 
Our courts and litigants have repeatedly cited Rogan. 
See State v. Hirata, 152 Hawaiʻ i 27, 36 n.18, 520 P.3d 225, 234 
n.18 (2022) (“From this point on, for appeals that allege 
prosecutorial misconduct, the briefs do not need to address the 
double jeopardy issue first identified in State v. Rogan[.]”). 
Because he was “not convicted of a crime,” Rogan requested and 
received an expungement order. See HRS § 831-3.2(a). 
Ahn’s case has more procedural complexity. In 2015, a 
grand jury indicted Ahn, a former Honolulu police officer, and 
his girlfriend with drug-related crimes. Grube I
, 142 Hawaiʻi at 
418, 420 P.3d at 349. During the case, the circuit court sealed 
records pertaining to a closed hearing. Id.
7  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Petitioner Nick Grube moved to unseal those records. The 
circuit court denied his motion. Id. at 419-21, 420 P.3d at 
350-52. Grube filed writs of mandamus and prohibition, asking 
this court to unseal the records. Id. at 421, 420 P.3d at 352. 
Grube prevailed. We ordered the circuit court to unseal 
the records. Id. at 429, 420 P.3d at 360. “[T]he public has a 
constitutional right of access to criminal proceedings generally, as well as the records thereof.” Id. at 422, 420 
P.3d at 353. Courts often cite to Ahn’s case, Grube I, for the 
procedural and substantive requirements for closing courtrooms 
and sealing court records. See, e.g., Roy v. Gov’t Emps. Ins.
Co.
, 152 Hawaiʻi 225, 232-34, 524 P.3d 1249, 1256-58 (App. 2023). 
Eventually, Ahn pled no contest and resolved his criminal 
case. 
At sentencing he moved to defer his plea. The court 
denied that request. Later, Ahn moved to reconsider. The court 
did. It granted his motion and deferred his plea. HRS § 853-
1(a). In 2021, the circuit court discharged Ahn and dismissed 
the charges against him. See HRS § 853-1(c). Then, because he 
had a charge dismissed after a deferred acceptance of a guilty 
or no contest plea, Ahn requested and received an expungement 
order. See HRS § 831-3.2(a); HRS § 853-1(e). 
Rogan and Ahn have moved to seal all their case records. Rogan sent this court a letter requesting that, per HRS 
§ 831-3.2, the judiciary seal his case, “dissociate[] [his name] 
8  
    
  
  
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
from future judicial research,” and “redact[]” his name from 
“everything.” 
Ahn mailed a letter to the circuit court requesting that 
his court records be sealed. At a hearing with Ahn’s counsel, 
co-defendant’s counsel, and the deputy attorney general, the 
circuit court proposed creating separate case files so Ahn’s 
case file could be sealed, while his co-defendant’s case file 
remained accessible. No party objected. 
Ahn then mailed a letter to this court: “I am writing to 
request that all my court records be sealed” per HRS § 831-3.2(f). 
Years after this court decided Grube I, Ahn and Grube’s 
legal clash rekindles. After Ahn asked this court to seal, 
Grube filed a position statement. The court should “interpret 
HRS § 831-3.2(f) narrowly to avoid infringing on the public’s 
constitutional right of access and the Judiciary’s authority to 
administer its own records and procedures.” Ahn’s position, Grube warned, “raises serious constitutional concerns.” 
We treated the letters to this court from the self-
represented Rogan and Ahn as motions and consolidated the cases. 
Then we invited the Office of the Public Defender and the 
Department of the Attorney General (Amici) to submit amicus 
briefs. They did. For Grube, the Public First Law Center 
9  
   
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(formerly the Civil Beat Law Center for the Public Interest) 
responded to those briefs. 
Per our order, Amici and the Public First Law Center 
addressed: 
(1) Whether sealing the entire case file under HRS § 831-
3.2(f) violates the public’s right of access under the 
first amendment of the U.S. Constitution and/or article I, 
section 4 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution; 
(2) whether narrower remedies are available, short of a 
total sealing, that would protect the interests advanced by HRS § 831- 3.2(f), and if so, what are those remedies; and, 
(3) the extent, if any, HRS § 831- 3.2(f) encroaches on the 
Judiciary’s independence and power to administer its own records. See generally Haw. Const. art. VI, §§ 1, 7; HRS 
§§ 601-5 (2016), 602- 5.5 (2016). 
II. 
A. HRS § 831-3.2(f) contemplates alternatives to sealing 
HRS § 831-3.2(f) commands a court to “seal or otherwise 
remove all judiciary files and other information pertaining to 
the applicable arrest or case from the judiciary’s publicly 
accessible electronic databases.” 
The Office of the Public Defender (OPD) argues that HRS 
§ 831-3.2(f) requires the total sealing of judiciary files with 
no judicial review. As OPD puts it, HRS § 831-3.2(f) provides “[n]o other option” to sealing the case records. 
The Department of the Attorney General takes the same 
position in its supplemental briefing: “sealing case files under 
HRS § 831-3.2(f) does not violate the public’s right of access,” 
so the court does not need to consider “whether narrower 
10  
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
remedies, short of total sealing, are available.”  “The Court 
should apply the statute as written and grant the motions.” 
Grube maintains that the law allows remedies short of total 
sealing. Otherwise, he says, HRS § 831-3.2(f) violates the 
public’s article I, section 4 right to access court records. 
Grube is right. Statutory interpretation begins with the law’s words. 
Alpha, Inc. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 154 Hawaiʻ i 486, 490–91, 555 
P.3d 173, 177–78 (2024). Ambiguity arises when there is more 
than one plausible textual meaning. Id.To clarify ambiguity, 
we consider sources outside the text, such as legislative history and the purpose and spirit of the law. Id.
 at 491, 555 
P.3d at 178. Statutory construction doctrines may also aid us. 
Id. 
HRS § 831-3.2(f) reads, “seal 
or otherwise remove[.]” 
(emphasis added). The import of the word “or” is clear. It is 
a disjunctive that signals an alternative. See State v. Kalani, 
108 Hawaiʻ i 279, 284, 118 P.3d 1222, 1227 (2005). The statute 
does not require sealing. 
There’s another option – “remove” the 
judicial records from the “judiciary’s publicly accessible electronic databases.” 
It is also clear that the “judiciary’s publicly accessible 
electronic databases” refers to eCourt Kōkua
, as it is the only 
database that matches the criteria. Neither the Judiciary 
11  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Information Management System (JIMS) nor the Judiciary 
Electronic Filing and Service System (JEFS) is publicly 
accessible. JIMS is for court staff only; JEFS is for 
registered parties, attorneys, and staff. Generalized access 
routes through eCourt Kōkua. This leaves eCourt Kōkua as the 
only publicly accessible electronic database. 
But the statute is unclear as to its definition of 
“otherwise remove.” See HRS § 831-3.2. “Remove” means to 
“change the location, position, station, or residence of” or 
“eliminate” or “get rid of.” Remove, Merriam-Webster 
Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/remove [https://perma.cc/M8SD-HARX]. 
Did the legislature intend “otherwise remove” to mean the 
equivalent of a total seal such that the public has no knowledge 
about a case’s existence? Or did the legislature intend to 
limit online access while allowing the public on-site access? 
After all, records from non-confidential case files are not only available from the judiciary’s publicly accessible electronic 
database, but are available on-site at courthouses across the 
state. See
 Hawaiʻi Electronic Filing and Service Rules Rule 1 
(eff. 2010) (defining the Judiciary Information Management 
System (JIMS) and the electronic filing system within JIMS), 
Rule 11.1 (eff. 2010) (requiring the clerk to provide the public 
12  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
with on-site access to the dockets and documents of non-
confidential cases maintained in JIMS). 
Given the statute’s ambiguity, we turn to the legislative 
history. Alpha
, 154 Hawaiʻi at 491, 555 P.3d at 178. 
The legislature did not mention subsection (f)’s purpose 
when it grafted it to Hawaiʻi’s expungement statute in 2016.  
See
2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, § 1 at 734; Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 138-16, in 2016 House Journal, at 1399, in 2016 Senate Journal, 
at 824-25. The 2023 Legislature, though, offered context. It 
expressed a restorative purpose to HRS § 831-3.2(f), one 
designed to forestall the long-lasting aftershocks posed by easy 
online access to court records. The legislature identified 
adverse impacts to employment, housing, lending, and educational 
opportunities. See 2023 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 159, § 1 (amending 
the law and identifying these interests in the preamble). 
Neither the 2016 Legislature nor the 2023 Legislature 
adopted the 2015 Penal Code Review Committee’s recommendation to 
prohibit all public access under subsection (f). Compare 2015 
Penal Review Report at 73, with 2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, § 66 at 772-73, and 2023 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 159, § 2 at 478. 
Where the adopted law deviates from the recommendation, “all 
changes in words and phraseology will be presumed to have been 
made deliberately and with a purpose to limit, qualify or enlarge the adopted law to the extent that the changes in words 
13  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and phrases imply.” See Levy v. Kimball, 51 Haw. 540, 544-45, 
465 P.2d 580, 583 (1970). 
The differences between the proposed language and the 
adopted language suggest the legislature had no intent to 
require automatic sealing under subsection (f). The legislature 
could have written the statute to remove all public access to 
the files, like the Committee recommended. It also could have 
written the statute to say “seal all judiciary files.” But it did neither. Instead, it used the words “otherwise remove,” 
suggesting removal is a narrower remedy than total sealing. The 
softened language implies the legislature did not intend HRS 
§ 831-3.2(f) to have the broad sweep Amici claim. 
This interpretation is also supported by the doctrine of 
constitutional doubt. “The doctrine of constitutional doubt, a 
well-settled canon of statutory construction, counsels that 
where a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of 
which grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided, our duty is to 
adopt the latter.” Morita v. Gorak
, 145 Hawaiʻi 385, 391, 453 
P.3d 205, 211 (2019) (cleaned up). 
Interpreting “otherwise remove” as synonymous with sealing 
raises constitutional questions. 
Under that interpretation, 
sealing is required. There’s no other option. 
14  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
But in that case, HRS § 831-3.2(f) necessarily invokes the 
public’s article I, section 4 right to access court records. 
Applying the doctrine of constitutional doubt, we interpret 
“otherwise remove” as a narrower remedy, short of sealing, that 
is available under the statute. This construction of “otherwise 
remove” paves a way to avoid the constitutional questions raised 
by the other construction. And it still protects Rogan’s and 
Ahn’s interests. 
Thus, the options are to either seal the judicial records 
or remove them from eCourt Kōkua. While “otherwise remove” remains ill-defined, the central point is that it encompasses a 
remedy short of sealing. 
We hold that HRS § 831-3.2(f) offers options to (1) seal or 
(2) remove judicial records from eCourt Kōkua. 
But this construction of the statute does not avoid article 
I, section 4 questions entirely. Because sealing is one option 
under the statute, we must determine whether the article I, section 4 public right of access attaches to expunged judicial 
records in criminal proceedings, and, if so, impart guidance on 
procedural and substantive safeguards. 
Next, we turn to the first constitutional concern raised by 
the total and automatic sealing of judicial records: whether 
such sealing defies the public’s right of access under article 
I, section 4 of the Hawaiʻi Constitution. 
15  
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B. Automatic sealing under HRS § 831-3.2(f) implicates the 
public’s right of access to court records under article I, 
section 4 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution 
Amici both contend that automatically sealing judicial 
records is constitutional. 
Grube takes the opposite position. He believes blanket 
sealing violates the public’s article I, section 4 right to 
access court records. 
Grube is right. 
The Hawaiʻ i Constitution provides that no law shall be 
enacted “abridging the freedom of speech or of the press[.]” 
Haw. Const. art. I, § 4. 
When interpreting article I, section 4, this court 
“considers” the U.S. Supreme Court’s First Amendment 
jurisprudence. 
Oahu Publ’ns Inc. v. Ahn, 133 Hawaiʻ i 482, 494, 
331 P.3d 460, 472 (2014). 
But like all our state constitutional 
provisions with federal counterparts, we independently interpret 
the Hawaiʻ i Constitution.  Otherwise, we dishonor our 
constitution and overlook federalism principles. State v.Wilson, 154 Hawaiʻ i 8, 14, 543 P.3d 440, 446 (2024) (“Hawaiʻ i’s 
people are entitled to an independent interpretation of State 
constitutional guarantees. . . . That means this court, not the 
U.S. Supreme Court, drives interpretation of the Hawaiʻ i 
16  
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Constitution. If we ignore this duty, we fail to live up to our 
oath to defend Hawaiʻ i’s Constitution.”) (cleaned up). 
Here, there is no U.S. Supreme Court case to consider. The 
Supreme Court has not decided a case involving the First 
Amendment’s right of public access to court records where a 
prosecution ended without conviction and a former defendant 
wants to seal all case records. 
Article I, section 4 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution grants the 
public “a constitutional right of access to criminal proceedings 
generally, as well as the records thereof.” Grube I, 142 Hawaiʻ i 
at 422, 420 P.3d at 353. See also Oahu Publ’ns, 133 Hawaiʻ i at 
506-07, 331 P.3d at 484-85. This right “inheres in every member 
of the public” such that individuals may challenge sealings. 
Grube I
, 142 Hawaiʻ i at 417, 420 P.3d at 348.  And it aligns with 
our state’s “deeply ingrained traditional mistrust [of] secret 
trials.” Id. at 422, 420 P.3d at 353 (cleaned up). 
Hawaiʻi has a ric
h history of public access to court 
proceedings, dating to the 1820s. Sally Engle Merry, 
Colonizing
Hawaiʻi: The Cult
ural Power of Law
 70 (2000) (“A second major 
change in the system of law and legal procedure in the 1820s was the use of public trials by jury[.]”). At the end of the 19th 
century, Queen Liliʻ uokalani recounted that, during her 1895 
trial by military tribunal, the courtroom was “crowded with 
17  
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
curious spectators” including “a liberal representation from all 
classes.” Liliʻuokalani, Hawaiʻ i’ s Story by Hawaiʻ i
’s Queen 279 
(1898). 
Decades later, the Massie trial drew nationwide attention 
and regularly attracted a full courtroom. See Russell Owen, 
Massie Jury Is Out, N.Y. Times, Apr. 28, 1932, at 1 (“It seemed 
that everyone in Honolulu wanted to enter the trial room this 
morning.”); Russell Owen, Massie Takes Blame in Hawaiian Murder, 
N.Y. Times, Apr. 17, 1932, at 1 (“The entire roomful of 
spectators sat forward on their seats, oblivious to the heat and 
the discomfort of their crowded quarters[.]”). 
For sure, history and tradition alone do not drive the 
spirit of openness that animates article I, section 4. 
“The 
Hawaiʻi Supreme Court values history and tradition to aid 
statutory and constitutional interpretation. 
But unlike the 
United States Supreme Court, we do not subscribe to an 
interpretive theory that nothing else matters.” Wilson, 154 
Hawaiʻi at 23, 543 P.3d at 455 (internal citations omitted).   
Open courtrooms and accessible records are structural 
features of our judicial system. The public’s ability to watch court cases and check court records advances societal interests, 
like promoting transparency, ensuring fairness and 
accountability, enabling informed public discussion, and 
preserving the integrity of the judicial process. Grube I

Hawaiʻi at 422, 420 P.3d at 353 (article I, section 4 serves as a 
“safeguard of the integrity” of the judicial system); Oahu 
Publ’ns, 133 Hawaiʻ i at 502, 331 P.3d at 480 (open courts offer 
an “assurance that the proceedings were conducted fairly to all 
concerned thereby promoting a perception of fairness”) (cleaned 
up). 
The judicial system gains from public access. Because 
court proceedings are open for all to see, and court records are available for all to read, a transparent approach instills 
confidence in, and respect for, the judiciary’s work. Id.
(citing Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 594 (1980) (Brennan, J., concurring)). 
Open proceedings curb misconduct. Since all participants 
are exposed to public scrutiny, accountability increases and injustice recedes. Id. (citing Richmond Newspapers, 448 U.S. at 
569 (plurality opinion)); see also Times Mirror Co. v. U.S., 873 F.2d 1210, 1213 (9th Cir. 1989) (“[A] better-informed 
citizenry . . . tends to deter government officials from abusing 
the powers of government.”). On the flip side, closed hearings 
and sealed records may hide prosecutorial or judicial misconduct 
from public view. 
Amici argue that the presumptive right of public access 
expires when a case has a no conviction outcome. They say Commonwealth v. Pon, 14 N.E.3d 182 (Mass. 2014) supports the 
19  
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
idea that any benefits of openness are significantly diminished 
after a case ends. 
But societal interests in open proceedings persist even 
after a criminal case ends. See Globe Newspaper Co. v. Pokaski, 
868 F.2d 497, 503-04 (1st Cir. 1989). This court has often explained the right of public access continues after a case’s 
conclusion. See Gannett Pac. Corp. v. Richardson, 59 Haw. 224, 
235, 580 P.2d 49, 57 (1978) (“[A] complete record of those parts 
of the proceedings closed to the public shall be kept and made 
available to the public for a legitimate and proper purpose 
following the completion of trial or disposition of the case 
without trial.”); Oahu Publ’ns
, 133 Hawaiʻi at 507, 331 P.3d at 
485 (stating that the public’s qualified right of access to a 
transcript of closed proceedings persists even after the trial 
is completed); 
Grube I
, 142 Hawaiʻi at 422, 420 P.3d at 353 
(holding that the public has “a constitutional right of access 
to criminal proceedings generally, 
as well as the records 
thereof”) (emphasis added). 
Time does not determine whether a right of public access 
exists. Whether a proceeding is ongoing, concluded yesterday, or ended eighty years ago, is not decisive. Societal interests 
can endure. See, e.g., Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 
(1944); Korematsu v. United States, 584 F.Supp. 1406 (N.D. Cal. 
1984). 
20  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
For a right of public access to attach, the focus centers 
on the nature of the proceedings, not simply when a person makes 
a request to seal. See Globe Newspaper Co. v. Super. Ct. for 
Norfolk Cnty., 457 U.S. 596, 605 n.13 (1982) (explaining that the court must evaluate the State’s interest in restricting 
access to a criminal proceeding which is presumptively open). 
For example, outside criminal proceedings, the right of public 
access may not attach. See, e.g., HRS §§ 346-45(a) (2015) 
(limiting those who may inspect family court records of adult 
protective proceedings); 571-84(a) (2018 & Supp. 2019) 
(mandating that certain family court records be withheld from 
public inspection); 571-84.6(b) (2018) (same, and providing that 
other family court records be presumptively open for public 
inspection). 
But here, because the public has a presumptive right of 
access to criminal proceedings, the public does not forfeit its 
constitutional right to access the records of those proceedings when a defendant is not convicted. See Pokaski, 868 F.2d at 
507-09. 
We hold that under article I, section 4 of the Hawaiʻ i 
Constitution, the public maintains a presumptive right of public access to a criminal case’s judicial records where the defendant 
was not convicted and obtained an expungement of their records. 
See Grube I, 142 Hawaiʻ i at 422, 420 P.3d at 353.  Where the 
21  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
right of public access attaches, automatic restrictions on that 
right are constitutionally unsound. See id. See also Pokaski, 
868 F.2d at 505-06. 
Thus, nothing has changed. If Rogan and Ahn want to seal 
their cases, they must satisfy the procedural and substantive requirements article I, section 4 commands. See Oahu Publ’ns, 
133 Hawaiʻ i at 497, 331 P.3d at 475; Grube I, 142 Hawaiʻ i at 423, 
420 P.3d at 354. 
Next, we examine this framework. 
C. The public’s right of access to court records is not 
absolute 
The public’s article I, section 4 constitutional right to 
enter criminal courtrooms and review judicial records is not 
absolute. Oahu Publ’ns, 133 Hawaiʻ i at 496, 331 P.3d at 474.  
The right of public access may be overcome in limited 
circumstances — situations where closure or sealing is necessary 
to protect an interest that outweighs the importance of public 
access. Grube I, 142 Hawaiʻ i at 423, 420 P.3d at 354.  Courts 
decide on a case-by-case basis: “individualized determinations 
are 
always required before the right of access may be denied.” 
Globe Newspaper Co., 457 U.S. at 608 n.20. 
To overcome the presumption of public access, procedural 
and substantive requirements must be met. Grube I
, 142 Hawaiʻi 
at 423, 420 P.3d at 354. The procedural requirements are (1) 
22  
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
those objecting to sealing must be given a reasonable 
opportunity to be heard; and (2) the reasons that support 
sealing must be articulated in findings. See id.
Here, the procedural requirements are not in play. 
Petitioner Grube has been heard. We turn to the substantive 
requirements. Grube says Ahn “has not satisfied the 
constitutional standards to seal this matter.” 
1. The substantive requirements to seal judicial records 
The substantive test that a court uses to address a request 
to seal court records involves whether (1) the sealing serves a compelling interest that overcomes the right of public access to 
the records; (2) there is a substantial probability that this 
interest would be harmed absent the closure or sealing; and (3) 
there are no alternatives to closure or sealing that would adequately protect the compelling interest. See Grube I
, 142 
Hawaiʻi at 424, 420 P.3d at 355 (citing 
Oahu Publ’ns
, 133 Hawaiʻi 
at 497–98, 331 P.3d at 475–76). 
a. Compelling interest for sealing judicial records 
The compelling interest must be “an overriding interest” to 
the public’s right of access, and the court must find that 
“closure is essential to preserve” the higher values underlying 
this compelling interest and “is narrowly tailored to serve that 
interest.” Oahu Publ’ns
, 133 Hawaiʻi at 496–97, 331 P.3d at 474– 
75. 
23  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
While a privacy interest may often prove compelling, the 
interest must be sufficiently consequential to “outweigh both 
the right of access of individual members of the public and the 
general benefits to public administration” granted by access to 
judicial records. See Grube I
, 142 Hawaiʻi at 425, 420 P.3d at 
356. 
Where a defendant has obtained an expungement order from 
the attorney general, the privacy and restorative interests are 
usually important enough to override the public’s right of 
access. 
But before a court seals judicial records, there must 
be individualized attention. 
Here, sealing Rogan’s and Ahn’s records serves compelling 
privacy and restorative interests. 
Society benefits when a 
person is afforded a certain measure of privacy. Privacy grants a person the liberty to explore opportunities without the stigma 
attached to their judicial records. 
Hawaiʻi’s people value 
fairness, kindness, and forgiveness. See
 HRS § 5-7.5(a) (2009). 
Through HRS § 831-3.2(f), the legislature has expressed the 
importance of privacy and restorative interests. That law has a 
laudable remedy. Easy access to judicial records may harm a 
person charged but not convicted of a crime. HRS § 831-3.2(f) 
curbs one-click access to judicial records for a good reason -
to ease the adverse societal impacts for a person whose case ended without conviction. 
24  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Here though, we find these compelling interests do not 
overcome the public’s constitutional right of access. 
First, in most cases that qualify for HRS § 831-3.2(f) 
relief, public interest is slight. Our two cases, however, are 
far from routine. Both resulted in published opinions. Courts, 
including this one, have frequently cited them. 
Second, the cases are different from other cases in which 
this court has recognized privacy rights. Rogan’s and Ahn’s privacy interests diverge from the privacy rights this court has 
recognized, like those involving medical and financial records. 
See Brende v. Hara
, 113 Hawaiʻi 424, 430, 153 P.3d 1109, 1115 
(2007). Medical and financial records have privacy protections. 
See id.
 (medical and financial records are “‘highly personal and 
intimate’ information” protected from public disclosure by the informational prong of article I, section 6 of the 
Hawaiʻi 
Constitution). 
The judicial records here are public. 
Do court events, and 
the records that shape them, vanish due to HRS § 831-3.2? 
No. The presumption of openness is strong. It is even 
stronger in cases of public importance. It defies the 
principles that fortify the right of public access — 
accountability, transparency, and the integrity of the criminal 
justice system — to automatically seal once-accessible judicial records, and thereby erase history and the public record. 
25  
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
For these reasons, Rogan’s and Ahn’s privacy and 
restorative interests are not compelling enough to overcome the 
public right to access their judicial records. 
b. Substantial probability of damage 
To satisfy the second substantive requirement, “a court 
must find that disclosure is sufficiently likely to result in 
irreparable damage to the identified compelling interest.” Grube 
I
, 142 Hawaiʻi at 426, 420 P.3d at 357. “[T]here must be a 
‘substantial probability’ that disclosure will harm the asserted 
interest.” Id.
 (quoting Press-Enter. Co. v. Super. Ct. of Cal.
for Riverside Cnty., 478 U.S. 1, 15 (1986)). Further, the potential damage “cannot be fleeting or readily curable through 
remedial measures; it must be irreparable in nature.” Id.
(citations omitted). 
We accept that, like most cases under HRS § 831-3.2(f), 
there is a substantial probability that disclosure of Movants’ 
case files will harm their respective privacy interests. 
Movants satisfy the second substantive requirement for 
sealing. 
c. Narrow tailoring 
Rogan and Ahn do not meet the third substantive 
requirement. 
To satisfy that requirement to seal, a court must find 
“there are no [less restrictive] alternatives” that would 
26  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“adequately protect the compelling interest.” Id. at 427, 420 
P.3d at 358; see also Pokaski, 868 F.2d at 506 (explaining that 
courts must determine whether the state has selected the “least 
restrictive means of promoting its objective”). Where there is 
a feasible alternative to total sealing that would both protect 
the right of public access and the compelling interest, courts 
must choose that alternative. Grube I, 142 Hawaiʻi at 427, 420 
P.3d at 358 (citing United States v. Brooklier, 685 F.2d 1162, 
1172 (9th Cir. 1982)).  
OPD maintains there is no alternative to total sealing. Grube counters that there are less restrictive 
alternatives to sealing that would adequately protect the 
Movants’ interests. 
Grube is right. We conclude there are narrower remedies available that 
protect Rogan’s and Ahn’s interests, such as removing their respective judicial records from eCourt Kōkua. Thus, Movants 
fail to satisfy the third substantive requirement for sealing. 
Next, we discuss a constitutional rationale separate from 
article I, section 4 that forecloses automatic sealing of criminal case records. 
27  
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
D. The separation of powers doctrine gives this court control 
over judicial records 
We hold that HRS § 831-3.2(f) encroaches on the judiciary’s 
independence and power to administer its own records. 
The Hawaiʻi Constitution vests judicial power with the 
courts. Haw. Const. art. VI, § 1. Article VI, section 7 gives 
this court the “power to promulgate rules and regulations in all 
civil and criminal cases for all courts relating to process, 
practice, procedure and appeals, which shall have the force and 
effect of law.” Haw. Const. art. VI, § 7. 
Judicial power extends to procedural responsibilities such 
as control over judicial records. See In re Dorothy D. v. New
York City Prob. Dep’t
, 400 N.E.2d 1342, 1343 (N.Y. 1980) (noting 
that courts possess the power to control records of their own 
proceedings). 
HRS §§ 601-5 (2016) and 602-5.5 (2016) set forth the 
statutory framework further fortifying the independence of the judiciary and the power of this court to determine the custody 
of all judicial files. HRS § 602-5.5 grants this court the 
statutory authority to “determine whether, and the extent to 
which, the judiciary, will create, accept, retain, or store in 
electronic form any case, fiscal, and administrative records and convert written case, fiscal, and administrative records to 
electronic records.” 
28  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HRS § 602-5.5’s legislative history evinces a law crafted 
with separation of powers principles in mind. The judiciary has 
the exclusive responsibility to maintain judicial records. S. 
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1542, in 1997 Senate Journal, at 1477 
(“Your Committee finds that as a separate and co-equal branch of 
government, the Judiciary should have the exclusive 
responsibility for maintaining its records.”) (emphasis added). 
The legislative history also reveals the intent to give this court “complete authority to promulgate rules for the use, 
retention, and destruction of all judiciary records.” H. Stand. 
Comm. Rep. No. 340, in 1997 House Journal, at 1242 (emphasis 
added). 
Thus, the statutory framework governing judicial records 
aligns with this court’s constitutional authority over judicial 
records under article VI, section 7. 
Separation of powers concerns arise when one branch of 
government interferes with another’s authority. No single constitutional provision defines the separation of powers 
doctrine. Alakaʻi Na Keiki, Inc. v. Matayoshi, 127 Hawaiʻ i 263, 
275, 277 P.3d 988, 1000 (2012). But in 
Hawaiʻi, this court 
recognizes the “sovereign power is divided and allocated among 
three co-equal branches.” Id.
The Department of the Attorney General claims there is no 
separation of powers issue because the legislature and the 
29  
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
judiciary have jointly governed the administration of court 
records throughout Hawaiʻ i’s history. It says that the 
legislature has long mandated limitations on access to certain 
types of court records, so there’s no intrusion. See, e.g., HRS 
§§ 346-45(a) (restricting access to family court records of adult protective proceedings); 571-84(a) (requiring that certain 
family court records be withheld from public inspection); 571-
84.6(b) (dictating which family court records are presumptively 
open for public inspection). 
It also highlights that the judiciary has promulgated rules 
that recognize the restrictions set by sealing statutes. See,
e.g.
, Hawaiʻi Court Record Rules Rules 3.1 (eff. 2010) (stating 
that the court clerk shall maintain records “as required by 
statute or rule.”), 10.1 (eff. 2010) (noting court records shall be accessible “[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute, rule, 
or order”), 10.4 (eff. 2019) (restricting access to confidential 
files “[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute or court rule 
or as ordered”); Hawaiʻ i Family Court Rules Rule 7.2(b) (eff. 
2022) (stating all documents in proceedings authorized by 
certain chapters of the HRS shall be sealed). 
These arguments are unpersuasive. 
Not only are the 
proceedings covered by those statutes and rules not at issue 
here, those proceedings are also substantively different from 
criminal proceedings. Courts have historically recognized a 
30  
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
need for confidentiality in certain proceedings and recognized 
the societal benefits supporting that confidentiality. In 
short, there are historical and value-driven reasons why courts 
allow family court sealing. 
None of the family-court-related statutes apply to criminal 
proceedings. And nothing suggests the legislature has the 
unilateral authority to determine how the judiciary maintains 
its own records. HRS § 831-3.2(f) provides for the total sealing of judicial records without judicial discretion. 
Eliminating judicial review, especially when that review covers 
constitutional dimensions, invades the judiciary’s independence. 
Rather than entrusting control of judicial records to both 
the legislature and judiciary, article VI, section 7 grants 
exclusive authority to the judiciary over its own records. Haw. 
Const. art. VI, § 7. Plus, this court possesses sole statutory 
authority to determine how to handle judicial records. HRS 
§ 602-5.5. We hold that article VI, section 7 gives the judiciary the authority to exercise exclusive control over 
judicial records. E. The practical solution 
HRS § 831-3.2(f) has admirable goals. We respect the 
privacy and restorative interests the legislature sought to 
address with HRS § 831-3.2(f). These interests are emblematic 
31  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
of the “Aloha Spirit” that coats our state and guides this 
court. See HRS § 5-7.5(a). 
We also recognize that HRS § 831-3.2(f) provides two 
options (1) seal or (2) remove from eCourt Kōkua. 
Thus, we hold that Rogan’s and Ahn’s judicial records must 
be removed from eCourt Kōkua, but the judicial records must 
remain publicly accessible for in-person review at the 
courthouse. This removal obscures the subject case files from immediate and quick online public access. It thereby protects 
both the privacy and restorative interests advanced by HRS 
§ 831-3.2(f). 
This remedy satisfies HRS § 831-3.2(f) without dulling the 
public’s constitutional right of access to judicial records 
under article I, section 4 of the Hawaiʻi Constitution.  It also 
averts interference with the judiciary’s article VI, section 7 
powers. 
To effectuate § 831-3.2(f)’s legislative intent, this court 
will soon promulgate rules to guide this removal process. 
We stress that qualifying persons may move a court for 
selective redactions and sealing as to any case record. 
To 
comply with article I, section 4, courts must assess requests to 
seal under HRS § 831-3.2(f) on a case-by-case basis. 
Where a defendant has obtained an expungement order from 
the Attorney General, the privacy and restorative interests are 
32  
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
typically compelling enough to override the public’s 
constitutional right of access such that a total sealing of a 
case file is appropriate. So we believe, in most cases, these 
interests will override the public’s right to access. 
III. 
We deny the motions in part as to the Movants’ request to 
seal the judicial records, and we grant the motions in part to order the removal of all case records for Case No. 21908 and SCPW-17-0000927 from eCourt Kōkua.
