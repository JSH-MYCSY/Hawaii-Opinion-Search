IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
KAMAKA VILLEGAS, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE COLETTE Y. GARIBALDI, Judge of the Circuit Court
of the First Circuit, State of Hawai' i, Respondent Judge,
 
and
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CR. NO. 17-01-0000637)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITIONS FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Kamaka Villegas’s
 
applications for writ of mandamus, filed on January 20, 2018 and
 
January 22, 2018, which are construed as petitions for writ of
 
mandamus, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support
 
thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to
 
demonstrate that he has a clear and indisputable right to the
 
sealing of his ex parte motion or the dismissal of the underlying
 
criminal case, that he lacks alternative means to seek relief, or
 
that the respondent judge committed a flagrant and manifest abuse
 
of discretion in deciding the ex parte motion. Petitioner is not
 
entitled to the requested extraordinary relief. See Kema v.
 Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue 
unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right 
to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately 
the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; such writs are 
not intended to supercede the legal discretionary authority of 
the lower courts, nor are they intended to serve as legal 
remedies in lieu of normal appellate procedures; where a court 
has discretion to act, mandamus will not lie to interfere with or 
control the exercise of that discretion, even when the judge has 
acted erroneously, unless the judge has exceeded his or her 
jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of 
discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before 
the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty 
to act). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petitions for writ of
 
mandamus are denied.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED the appellate clerks’
 
office shall process the petitions for writ of mandamus without
 
payment of the filing fee.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, January 31, 2018.
