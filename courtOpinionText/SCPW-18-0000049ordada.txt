ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CASE NO. 2DCW-17-0002038)
ORDER DISMISSING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner DeMont R. D. Conner’s
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on January 26, 2018, and the
record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that he
has standing, as a non-party in the underlying criminal
proceeding, to seek the requested extraordinary relief from the
district court’s rulings in the underlying proceeding.  See
Kaho#ohanohano v. State, 114 Hawai #i 302, 162 P.3d 696 (2007). 
Accordingly, Electronically Filed
Supreme Court
SCPW-18-0000049
05-FEB-2018
12:52 PMIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
mandamus is dismissed.  
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 5, 2018.
