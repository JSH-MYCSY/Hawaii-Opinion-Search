ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CASE NO. 1DCW-18-0000395)
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner David Douglas Kromer’s
petition for writ of habeas corpus, filed on February 8, 2017, on
behalf of Norman Kalani Asam, and the record, it appears that
petitioner fails to demonstrate that he has standing, as a non-
attorney and non-party in the underlying proceeding, to seek the
requested extraordinary relief from this court related to the
underlying proceeding.  See Kaho# ohanohano v. State , 114 Hawai #i
302, 162 P.3d 696 (2007).  Moreover, petitioner presents no
special reason for this court to invoke its jurisdiction at this
time.  See Oili v. Chang, 57 Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 788
(1976) (the supreme court “will not exercise its originalElectronically Filed

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
habeas corpus is denied.

appellate court shall process the petition for writ of habeas
corpus without payment of the filing fee.
