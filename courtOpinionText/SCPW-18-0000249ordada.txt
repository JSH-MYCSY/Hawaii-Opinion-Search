(CIV. NO. 08-1-0240)
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Deborah Ann Hokulani
Joshuaâ€™s petition for writ of mandamus, filed on March 29, 2018,

and the record, it appears that, based on the record presented to

alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; where a court has
discretion to act, mandamus will not lie to interfere with or
control the exercise of that discretion, even when the judge has
acted erroneously, unless the judge has exceeded his or her
jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of
discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before
the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty
to act).  Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
mandamus is denied.
