IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
OKHOO HANES, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE HILARY B. GANGNES, Judge of the
District Court of the First Circuit, Respondent Judge, 
and
 
SCOTTRADE, INC. and ED BARAOIDAN, Respondents.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
(CIV. NO. 1SC17-1-2015)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
AND/OR PROHIBITION
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ., and
Circuit Judge Browning, in place of McKenna, J., recused)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Okhoo Hanes’s petition 
for writ of mandamus and/or prohibition, filed on June 1, 2018, 
the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that she is entitled to the requested relief sought by way of an extraordinary writ. See HRS §§ 633-27 and 633-28; Kema v. 
Gaddis, 91 Hawai' i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of 
mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless  the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to
 
relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the
 alleged wrong or obtain the requested action); Honolulu
 Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62
 (1978) (a writ of mandamus and a writ of prohibition are
 extraordinary remedies meant to, among other things, restrain a
 judge of an inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of his
 or her jurisdiction; they are not intended to supersede the legal
 discretionary authority of the trial courts or cure a mere legal
 error). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus and/or prohibition is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, June 15, 2018.
