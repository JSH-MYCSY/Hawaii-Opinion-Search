ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DISMISSING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael J. Matsukawaâ€™s 
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on June 18, 2018, the 
supplemental declaration, filed on June 24, 2018, the request to 
withdraw the petition for writ of mandamus, filed on July 2, 
2018, and the record, it appears that the request for relief has 
been rendered moot by the appointment and confirmation of eleven 
members to the County of Hawai' i Charter Commission for the 2019 
review year on June 29, 2018. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
mandamus is dismissed.
