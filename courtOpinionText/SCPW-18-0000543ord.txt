Upon consideration of petitioner Rick Daysog’s petition

2018, the respondent judge’s answer, filed on August 16, 2018,
Successor Trustee of the Abigail K. K. Kawananakoa Revocable
Living Trust Dated April 4, 2001, as Amended James H. Wright’s

02:37 PMShizuru’s answer, filed on August 21, 2018, the respective
supporting documents, and the record, it appears that, although
the initial orders of the probate court that allowed various
documents to be filed under seal in In the Matter of the Abigail
K. K. Kawananakoa Revocable Living Trust dated April 4, 2001, as
amended, Tr. No. 17-1-01222 (“the Trust Case”) did not fully
comply with the procedural and substantive requirements set forth
by court rules and this court’s precedents, the circuit court’s
August 2, 2018 order, which required the parties to file redacted
versions of documents that were filed under seal for which
redacted versions had not yet been filed--except for documents
filed under seal pursuant to Hawaii Probate Rule 3(d)--has
substantially addressed the issues underlying the petition.
Thus, based on the current posture of the Trust Case, the
requested extraordinary relief is not warranted.  See Honolulu
Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62
(1978) (a writ of prohibition “is an extraordinary remedy . . .
to restrain a judge of an inferior court from acting beyond or in
excess of his jurisdiction”); Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai #i 200,
204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an
extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack
of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
obtain the requested action).  Accordingly, 
2IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
prohibition and writ of mandamus is denied.  We note, however,
that the August 2, 2018 order in the Trust Case expressly
directed the parties to continue to comply with Oahu Publications
v. Takase, 139 Hawai #i 236, 386 P.3d 873 (2016) by filing
redacted versions of documents that were previously sealed.  The
probate court shall ensure that the redactions comply with Takase
and other requirements provided by law.  
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai #i, October 1, 2018.
