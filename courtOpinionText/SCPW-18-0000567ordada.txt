ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CIVIL NO. 18-1-0592-04)
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Thaddaeuss Thompson’s 
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on July 17, 2018, the
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that
he has been deprived of adequate writing materials or supplies
such that his right of access to the courts has been infringed or
that he lacks alternative means to seek relief.  Petitioner,
therefore, is not entitled to the requested writ of mandamus. 
See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999)

Barnett v. Broderick , 84 Hawai #i 109, 111, 929 P.2d 1359, 1361
(1996) (mandamus relief is available to compel an official to
perform a duty allegedly owed to an individual only if the
individual’s claim is clear and certain, the official’s duty is
ministerial and so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt,
and no other remedy is available).  Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
court shall process the petition for writ of mandamus without
payment of the filing fee. 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for writ
of mandamus is denied.
