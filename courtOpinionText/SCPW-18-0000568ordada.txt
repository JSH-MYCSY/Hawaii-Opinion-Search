THADDAEUSS THOMPSON, Petitioner,
vs.
ACO SARKISSIAN ET AL., Respondents.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CIVIL NO. 18-1-0592-04)
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Thaddaeuss Thompsonâ€™s 
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on July 17, 2018, the
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that
he is entitled to an extraordinary writ or that he lacks
alternative means to seek relief.  Petitioner, therefore, is not
entitled to the requested writ of mandamus.  See Kema v. Gaddis,
91 Hawai# i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus
is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the
petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to reliefElectronically Filed

wrong or obtain the requested action); Honolulu Advertiser, Inc.
v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of
mandamus is not intended to supersede the legal discretionary
authority of the trial courts, cure a mere legal error, or serve
as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedure; rather,
a writ of mandamus is meant to restrain a judge of an inferior
court from acting beyond or in excess of his or her
jurisdiction).  Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the clerk of the appellate
court shall process the petition for writ of mandamus without
payment of the filing fee. 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for writ
of mandamus is denied.   
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 15, 2018.
