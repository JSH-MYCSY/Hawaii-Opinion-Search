IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
CHARLES VITALE, NINA VITALE, Individually and in their
Representative Capacities and on Behalf of a Class of All Persons
Similarly Situated, Petitioners, 
vs. 
THE HONORABLE DEAN E. OCHIAI, Judge of the Circuit Court of the
First Circuit, State of Hawai i #, Respondent Judge, 
and 
D.R. HORTON, INC.; D.R. HORTON-SCHULER HOMES, LLC, Respondents. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CIV. NO. 15-1-1347-07) 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of petitioners Charles and Nina 
Vitalesâ€™ petition for writ of mandamus, the documents attached 
thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it 
appears that petitioners fail to demonstrate that they have a 
clear and indisputable right to the requested relief, that they 
lack alternative means to seek relief, and that the respondent 
judge committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion or 
exceeded his jurisdiction in considering the motion for leave to file a third amended complaint.  Petitioners, therefore, are not 
entitled to the requested extraordinary writ.  See Kema v. 
Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right 
to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately 
the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; where a court 
has discretion to act, mandamus will not lie to interfere with or 
control the exercise of that discretion, even when the judge has 
acted erroneously, unless the judge has exceeded his or her 
jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of 
discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before 
the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty 
to act); Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 
580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of mandamus is not intended to 
supersede the legal discretionary authority of the trial courts, 
cure a mere legal error, or serve as a legal remedy in lieu of 
normal appellate procedure).  Accordingly,  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 23, 2020.
