ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner William Horace Doddâ€™s
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on August 16, 2018, the
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
the record, it appears that petitioner may seek relief in the
appeals pending in the Intermediate Court of Appeals in CAAP-18-
0000147 and CAAP-18-0000696, as appropriate.  Petitioner,
therefore, is not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief. Electronically Filed

01:21 PMSee Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999)
(a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not
issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable
right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress
adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). 
Accordingly,  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
mandamus is denied.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, October 11, 2018.
