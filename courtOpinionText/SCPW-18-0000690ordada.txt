ALEXANDRA KING, Petitioner,

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 2DTC-18-003207) 
 
ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART 
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By
: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
 
  Upon consideration of petitioner Alexandra King’s 
petition for writ of mandamus, the respondent State of Hawaiʻi’s 
answer to the petition for writ of mandamus, petitioner’s reply 
in support of the petition for writ of mandamus, the respective 
supporting documents, and the record, it appears that, in light 
of the nature of the charged offenses, petitioner’s pleas to the Electronically Filed
Supreme Court

 charges in the initial complaint in the underlying proceeding, 
which the district court accepted, were not flawed by the lack 
of an advisement as to restitution.  See HRS § 706-646 
(restitution statute); HRS § 701-107(5) (“A violation does not 
constitute a crime.”); State v. Domingo, 121 Hawai ʻi 191, 194-95, 
216 P.3d 117, 120-21 (App. 2009) (“Absent evidence that 
Domingo’s conduct [(e.g., failing to remain at the scene of an 
accident, failing to give information, and failing to render 
reasonable assistance)] caused or aggravated Tomlin’s injuries 
or caused Tomlin’s death, no causal relationship between 
Domingo’s criminal act and a victim’s losses is shown and 
restitution may not be imposed pursuant to HRS § 706-646.”).  
Further, there was no basis to sua sponte set aside the pleas 
over petitioner’s objection.  See People v. Hardin, 67 A.D.2d 12 
(N.Y.S.2d 1979) (stating that, in the absence of fraud, the 
court may not set aside a plea without the defendant’s consent).   
Extraordinary relief is therefore warranted under the 
circumstances of this case.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai ʻi 200, 
204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (where a court has discretion to 
act, mandamus will not lie to interfere with or control the 
exercise of that discretion, even when the judge has acted 
erroneously, unless the judge has exceeded his or her 
jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of 
discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before 3

duty to act).  Accordingly,  
 
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of 
mandamus is granted in part and the district court is directed 
to reinstate petitioner’s pleas to the initial complaint and 
dismiss the pending Third Amended Complaint.   To the extent 
petitioner is requesting that this court dismiss her case in its 
entirety, the petition is denied. 1

                         1  Also, to the extent the Second Amended Complaint has not been 
dismissed, the district court shall also dismiss the Second Amended 
Complaint.
