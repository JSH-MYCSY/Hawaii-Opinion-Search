approved or rejected.  Petitioners challenge the ballot question 
as unclear and misleading in violation of Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 11-118.5 (2011), which provides in relevant 
part, “The language and meaning 
of a constitutional amendment 
shall be clear and it shall be neither misleading nor 
deceptive. ”  The ballot question is as follows : 
 
Shall the legislature be authorized to establish, as 
provided by law, a surcharge on investment real 
property to be used to  support public education?  
 
 The proposed constitutional amendments to a rticle 
VIII, section 3 and article X, section 1 of the Hawai‘ i 
Constitution would provide that the exclusive authority of the 
counties1 over functions, powers and duties relating to the 
taxation of real property be amended to also authorize the state 
legislature to impose a 
“surcharge on  investment real property ” 
to support public education.  The ballot question as written 
does not comply with the requirements of HRS § 11- 118.5 that the 
language and meaning of the ballot question be clear and n ot 
misleading.  Accordingly,  
 
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ballot question is 
declared invalid.  The Chief Election Officer shall issue a 
public proclamation stating that the ballot question is invalid 
and that any votes for or against the measure will not be 
counted and will have no impact.  A written opinion will follow.
