ORDER DENYING SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
AND WRIT OF PROHIBITION
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioners Milagros Leano Castro
and Benny F. Castro’s “Second Amended Real Emergency Petition for
a Writ of Mandamus with Prohibition and Prayer for Restraining
Order and Permanent Injunction,” filed on January 18, 2019, the
respective supporting documents, and the record, it appears that
petitioners, who currently have an appeal pending in CAAP-18-
0000761, fail to demonstrate that they have a clear and
indisputable right to the relief requested from this court and
that they lack alternative means to seek relief.  Petitioners,Electronically Filed

See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39
(1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will
not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and
indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to
redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
action; such a writ is not intended to supersede the legal
discretionary authority of the lower court, nor is it intended to
serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedures);
Gannett Pac. Corp. v. Richardson, 59 Haw. 224, 226, 580 P.2d 49,
53 (1978) (a writ of prohibition is an extraordinary remedy; it
is not meant to serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal
appellate procedures).  Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the second amended petition
for writ of mandamus and writ of prohibition is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 5, 2019.
