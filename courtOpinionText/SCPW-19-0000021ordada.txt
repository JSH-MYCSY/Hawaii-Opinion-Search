IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI I 
 
                                                                  
SAMUEL CAMPIFORMIO, Petitioner, 
 
vs. 
 
THE HONORABLE FA’AUUGA TO’OTO’O, Judge of the Circuit Court of 
the First Circuit, State of Hawai i, Respondent Judge, 
 
and 
 
STATE OF HAWAII, Respondent. 
                                                                  
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CR. NO. 1CPC- 18-0001728) 
     
 
ORDER GRANTING IN PART PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS 
AND/OR MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)  
 
  Upon consideration of petitioner Samuel Campiformio’s 
petition for writ of habeas corpus and/or mandamus, filed on 
January 7, 2019, respondent State of Hawai i’s answer, filed on 
January 29, 2019, the respondent judge’s answer, filed on 
January 30, 2019, the respective supporting documents, and the 
record, it appears that imposition of the amount of bail and any 
conditions thereof, if a defendant is bailable, should be based 
on a consideration of relevant factors pursuant to HRS Chapter 
804 and applicable case law.  See, e.g., Sakamoto v. Chang, 56 Electronically Filed

Haw. 447, 539 P.2d 1197 (1975); Pelekai v. W hite, 75 Haw. 357, 
861 P.2d 1205 (1993); State v. Henley, 136 Hawai ‘i 471, 363 P.3d 
319 (2015).  The “Findings of Fact and Order Denying Motion for 
Reduction in Bail,” filed on December 19, 2018, is insufficient 
for this court to determine whether the circuit court considered 
and applied the relevant factors in denying the motion for a 
bail reduction.  Accordingly, 
 
  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition is granted in 
part.  The “Findings of Fact and Order Denying Motion for 
Reduction in Bail,” filed on December 19, 2018, is vacated, and  
the matter is remanded to the circuit court for further hearing 
on the November 27, 2018 “Motion for Reduction of Bail.”  The 
disposition of the “Motion for Reduction of Bail” shall include 
the rendering of relevant findings consistent with the 
requirements of statutory and applicable case law.  In all other 
respects, the petition is denied. 
  IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the “Order 
Pertaining to Bail,” filed on November 7, 2018 shall remain in 
effect pending the  further hearing and the disposition of the 
“Motion for Reduction of Bail.”   
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai i, March 4, 2019.
