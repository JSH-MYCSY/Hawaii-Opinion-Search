ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Nakayama, Acting C.J., McKenna and Wilson, JJ., and  
Circuit Judge Ashford, in place of Recktenwald, C.J., recused, 
and Circuit Judge Wong, in place of Pollack, J., recused) 
 
  Upon consideration of petitioners Leonard G. Horowitz 
and Sherri Kane’s complaint against Bradley Tamm,  Chief 
Disciplinary Counsel for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, 
filed on December 14, 2018 (which this court construes as a 
petition for writ of mandamus), the documents submitted in 
support thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioners 
fail to demonstrate that they have a clear and indisputable 
right to the requested relief or that they lack alternative 
means to seek relief.  Petitioners are not entitled to a w rit of 
mandamus.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai ʻi 200, 204 -05, 982 P.2d 
334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary Electronically Filed

clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative 
means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the 
requested action).  According ly, 
  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of 
mandamus is denied.
