(S.P.P. NO. 18-1-0001)
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Herman-Lee Kaopua,
Sr.’s petition for writ of mandamus, filed on February 11, 2019,
the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof,
and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate
that he has a clear and indisputable right to the requested
relief or that he lacks alternative means to seek relief. 
Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested
extraordinary writ.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai #i 200, 204, 982
P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary
remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a
clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative
means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain theElectronically Filed

P.2d 1359, 1361 (1996) (with respect to a public official,
mandamus relief is available to compel an official to perform a
duty allegedly owed to an individual only if the individual’s
claim is clear and certain, the official’s duty is ministerial
and so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt, and no other
remedy is available).  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
mandamus is denied.
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk of the
appellate court shall process the petition for writ of mandamus
without payment of the filing fee. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai #i, February 25, 2019.
