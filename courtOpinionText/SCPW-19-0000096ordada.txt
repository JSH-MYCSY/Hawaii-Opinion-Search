ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CAAP-19-0000048; CIVIL NO. 16-1-0470(1))
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioners L & E Ranch LLC, Hugh
John Coflin, and Janet Dawn Stephenson Coflinâ€™s petition for writ
of mandamus, filed on February 16, 2019, the joinder, filed on
February 17, 2019, the respective supporting documents, and the
record, it appears that petitioners are not entitled to an
extraordinary writ.  An appeal is pending in CAAP-19-0000048.  
At this juncture, petitioners fail to demonstrate that they have
a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief from this
court or that they lack alternative means to seek relief.  SeeElectronically Filed
