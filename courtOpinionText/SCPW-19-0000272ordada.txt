THE HONORABLE GARY W. B. CHANG, Judge of the Circuit Court of the

(CIV. NO. 12-1-2207-08)
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Edmund M. Abordo’s
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on March 28, 2019, the
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that
he has a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief,
that he lacks alternative means to seek relief, or that the
respondent judge committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of
discretion or acted in excess of his jurisdiction.  Petitioner,
therefore, is not entitled to the requested extraordinary writ. 
See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999)

mandamus is denied.   
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerks’
office shall process the petition for writ of mandamus without
