ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR EXTRAORDINARY WRIT 
(By: McKenna, Acting C.J., Pollack and Wilson, JJ., and  
Circuit Judge Eddins, in place of Recktenwald, C.J., recused, 
and Circuit Judge Nakasone, in place of Nakayama, J., recused) 
 
  Upon consideration of David L. Moore’s petition for an 
extraordinary writ, filed on May 7, 2019, we conclude, on the 
merits of the petition,1 that petitioner Moore fails to 
demonstrate that he has a clear and indisputable right to the 
requested relief or that he lacks alternative means to seek 
relief. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested 
                                                           
 1 This court reaches the merits of the petition because there is no 
statute, court rule, or statutorily prescribed order prohibiting  Moore from 
filing the instant petition with this  court.  Electronically Filed

  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition is denied.
