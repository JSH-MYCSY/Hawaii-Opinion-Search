IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
CHRISTOPHER YOUNG, Petitioner, 
vs. 
THE HONORABLE HENRY T. NAKAMOTO, Judge of the Circuit Court of
the Third Circuit, State of Hawai# i, Respondent Judge, 
and 
POMAIKAI HOLDINGS, INC., dba RE/MAX PROPERTIES; et al.,
Respondents. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CIV. NOS. 17-1-0412 and 19-1-0047) 
ORDER DENYING “NOTICE OF APPEAL TO THE STATE OF HAWAII 
SUPREME COURT FROM ORDERS 5/8/2019 IN THE CIRCUIT COURT
OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT PURSUANT TO HRAP RULES 3(a)(1)(5),
21(a)(i)(ii)(iii), 24(b), & HRCP Rule 60(b)(3)”
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of petitioner Christopher Young’s 
“Notice of Appeal to the State of Hawaii Supreme Court from 
Orders 5/8/2019 in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit 
Pursuant to HRAP Rules 3(a)(1)(5), 21(a)(i)(ii)(iii), 24(b), & 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(3)”, which was filed in the third circuit court 
on June 13, 2019 and in this court on June 20, 2019, the 
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and 
the record, it appears that petitioner is seeking writs of mandamus and prohibition.  Petitioner, however, fails to 
demonstrate that he entitled to the requested extraordinary 
relief.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 
338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and 
indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to 
redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested 
action; a writ of mandamus is not intended to supersede the legal 
discretionary authority of the lower courts or serve as a legal 
remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedures); Honolulu Adv., 
Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ 
of mandamus, therefore, is meant to restrain a judge of an 
inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of his or her 
jurisdiction); Gannett Pac. Corp. v. Richardson, 59 Haw. 224, 
226, 580 P.2d 49, 53 (1978) (a writ of prohibition is an 
extraordinary remedy to restrain a judge of an inferior court 
from acting beyond or in excess of his or her jurisdiction).  
Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writs of 
mandamus and prohibition is denied.   
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerks’ 
office shall process the petition for writs of mandamus and 
prohibition without payment of the filing fee. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, July 2, 2019.
