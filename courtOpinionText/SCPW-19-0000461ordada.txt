petition for writ of mandamus, filed on June 25, 2019, and the
amended petition for writ of mandamus, filed on June 27, 2019,
the submissions of the respondents and the respondent judge, the

SCPW-19-0000461
18-JUL-2019
03:03 PM2019,” filed on June 18, 2019, in State v. Jamie Jason et al.,
Case No. 3CPC-18-0000639, in the circuit court of the third
circuit, was filed in the Intermediate Court of Appeals in CAAP-
19-0000462.  Accordingly, there appears to be an alternative
means to obtain the requested action as appropriate in CAAP-19-
0000462.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334,
338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that
will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and
indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to
redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
action; a writ of mandamus is not intended to supersede the legal
discretionary authority of the lower courts or serve as a legal
remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedures).  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
mandamus is denied without prejudice to petitioner seeking
relief, as appropriate, in the appeal pending in CAAP-19-0000462.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, July 18, 2019.
