THOMAS RUSSI AND CHRISTINE RUSSI, Petitioners,
vs.
COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon review of the May 25, 2019 email from Thomas and
Christine Russi to the Chief Justice of this court, which on 
June 25, 2019, we deemed to be a petition for writ of mandamus
which seeks relief from a May 22, 2019 disposition by the
Commission on Judicial Conduct of a complaint submitted earlier
to the Commission by the Russis, we conclude that nothing in the
record demonstrates the Commission committed a manifest and
flagrant abuse of discretion of the authority delegated to it by
this court through Rule 8 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of
the State of Hawai# i.  See State ex. rel. Marsland v. Ames, 71
Haw. 304, 307, 788 P.2d 1281, 1283 (1990); see also Barnett v.Electronically Filed
