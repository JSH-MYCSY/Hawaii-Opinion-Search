THE HONORABLE PETER T. CAHILL, Judge of the Circuit Court of the 
Second Circuit, State of Hawai ‘i, Respondent Judge. 
 
                                                                  
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)  
 
  Upon consideration of petitioners Alex Lessin and 
Janet Kira Lessin’s petition for writ of mandamus, the documents 
attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the 
record, it appears that the requested extraordinary relief is 
not warranted.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai ‘i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 
334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy 
that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear 
and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means 
to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested 
action; it is meant to restrain a judge of an inferior court Electronically Filed
