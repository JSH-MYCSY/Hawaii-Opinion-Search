Upon consideration of petitioner Harold Tomlin Hodges,
Jr.’s “MOTION TO Mandamus,” filed on September 3, 2019, which we

that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear
and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means
to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requestedElectronically Filed
