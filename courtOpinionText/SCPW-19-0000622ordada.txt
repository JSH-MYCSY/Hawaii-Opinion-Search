ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Honolulu Civil Beat
Inc.â€™s petition for writ of mandamus, filed on September 5, 2019,
the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof,
and the record, it appears that an appeal is pending in CAAP-19-
0000450.  Petitioner may seek relief through the appellate
process, as appropriate.  Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled
to the requested writ of mandamus.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91
Hawai#i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ ofElectronically Filed

the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to
relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the
alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; a writ of mandamus
is not intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of
the trial courts, cure a mere legal error, or serve as a legal
remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedures).  Accordingly,  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
mandamus is denied.
