ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(FC-S NO. 17-1-00230)
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioners A.S. and J.S.â€™s
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on September 6, 2019, the
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
the record, it appears that, based on the information presented
to this court, petitioners fail to demonstrate that they have a
clear and indisputable right to the requested relief and that
they lack alternative means to seek relief.  Petitioners,
therefore, are not entitled to the requested extraordinary writ. 
See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999)Electronically Filed

02:04 PM(a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not
issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable
right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress
adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; such
a writ is not intended to supersede the legal discretionary
authority of the trial courts, cure a mere legal error, or serve
as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedures). 
Accordingly,   
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition is denied.  
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, September 25, 2019.
