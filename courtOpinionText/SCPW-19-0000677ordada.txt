LAVERNE REMBERT, Petitioner, 
vs. 
HAWAI# I PAROLING AUTHORITY, Respondent Agency, 
and 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 1PC041002384) 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of petitioner Laverne Rembertâ€™s 
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on October 3, 2019, the 
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that alternative means are available for petitioner to seek relief.  See HRPP Rule 40(a)(2).  Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested extraordinary writ from this court.  See Kema v. Gaddis
, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204, 982 
P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the 
requested action).  Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu,  Hawai# i, October 25, 2019.
