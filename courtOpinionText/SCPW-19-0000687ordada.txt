 Lighter to transfer this matter to the Intermediate Court of 
Appeals, as an appeal from an agency decision, we note that ODC 
and the Board are Acreatures of this court, created pursuant to 
the court’s inherent and constitutional authority to regulate 
the practice of law. @  See In re Disciplinary Bd. of Hawaii 
Supreme Court, 91 Hawai i 363, 368, 984 P.2d 688, 693 (1999).  
Furthermore, there is nothing in the record to indicate ODC or 
the Board abused the discretion delegated to them by this court 
in their handling of the matter.  See id. at 370, 984 P.2d at 
695.  Therefore,  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion to transfer is 
denied. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the petition for writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai i, November 22, 2019.
