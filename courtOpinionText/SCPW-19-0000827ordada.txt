vs.

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner DeMont R. D. Connerâ€™s
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on November 25, 2019, and
the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that
he has a clear and indisputable right to the requested
extraordinary relief from this court and has alternative means to
seek relief.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204-05, 982
P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary
remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a
clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative
means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the
requested action).  Accordingly,Electronically Filed
