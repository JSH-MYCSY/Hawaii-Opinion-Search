ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Eric Richard Eleson’s
petition for writ of habeas corpus, filed on December 10, 2019,
the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof,
and the record, it appears that petitioner presents no special
reason for this court to invoke its jurisdiction at this time. 
See Oili v. Chang, 57 Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976)
(the supreme court “will not exercise its original jurisdiction
in habeas corpus proceedings when relief is available in a lower
court and no special reason exists for invoking its
jurisdiction”).  Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
habeas corpus is denied.Electronically Filed
