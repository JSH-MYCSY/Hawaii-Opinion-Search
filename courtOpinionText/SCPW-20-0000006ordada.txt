/s/ Paula A. Nakayama
/s/ Sabrina S. McKenna
/s/ Richard W. Pollack
/s/ Michael D. Wilsonat 8:15 a.m., and, as explained by the respondent judge, once the
motion for disqualification/recusal has been decided, the
evidentiary hearing will be set.  Thus, based on the current
state of the underlying record in this case, petitioner’s request
for extraordinary relief is not warranted.  See Kema v. Gaddis,
91 Hawai# i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus
is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the
petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief
and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged
wrong or obtain the requested action); Wong v. Fong, 60 Haw. 601,
604, 593 P.2d 386, 389 (1979) (an extraordinary writ will
ordinarily be invoked in exceptional circumstances amounting to
judicial usurpation of power).  Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
mandamus is denied.  
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 27, 2020.
