MATTHEW MARTOWSKA, Petitioner,
vs.
ALVIN T. ONAKA, in his capacity as State Registrar
and Chief of the Office of Health Status Monitoring, Department
of Health, State of Hawai#i, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Matthew Martowska’s
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on January 31, 2020, the
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate a
clear and indisputable right to the requested relief, fails to
demonstrate that the respondent’s duty is so plainly prescribed
as to be free from doubt, and has alternative means to seek
relief by filing an appropriate action in the circuit court.  See
Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issueElectronically Filed

/s/ Paula A. Nakayama
/s/ Sabrina S. McKenna
/s/ Richard W. Pollack
/s/ Michael D. Wilson unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right
to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately
the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action); Barnett v.
Broderick, 84 Hawai#i 109, 111, 929 P.2d 1359, 1361 (1996) (with
respect to a public official, mandamus relief is available to
compel an official to perform a duty allegedly owed to an
individual only if the individual’s claim is clear and certain,
the official’s duty is ministerial and so plainly prescribed as
to be free from doubt, and no other remedy is available). 
Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
mandamus is denied.
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk of the
appellate court shall process the petition for writ of mandamus
without payment of the filing fee.  
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 2, 2020.
