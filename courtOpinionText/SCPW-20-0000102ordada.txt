 circumstance to warrant extraordinary relief at this juncture. 
See Kema v. Gaddis
, 91 Hawaiʻi 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) 
(a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not 
issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and 
indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to 
redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested 
action; such a writ is meant to restrain a judge of an inferior 
court who has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a 
flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act 
on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in 
which he or she has a legal duty to act). Accordingly, 
DATED:
 Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, June 16, 2020.
