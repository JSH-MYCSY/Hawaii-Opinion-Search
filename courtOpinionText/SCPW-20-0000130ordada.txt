IN RE MICHAEL DOYLE RUGGLES, Petitioner.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE
RENEWED PETITION FOR EXTRAORDINARY WRIT
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, J.J.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Michael Doyle
Rugglesâ€™s renewed petition for an extraordinary writ, filed on
March 10, 2020, the documents attached thereto and submitted in
support thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner is
currently seeking relief from the State of Hawai# i Department of
Health and fails to demonstrate at this time that he is entitled
to the requested extraordinary writ from this court.  See, e.g.,
Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a
writ for extraordinary relief, such as a writ of mandamus or a
writ of prohibition, will generally not issue unless the
petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief
and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged
wrong or obtain the requested action).  Accordingly,
