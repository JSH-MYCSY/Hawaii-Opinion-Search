(CAAP-18-0000449; CIV. NOS. 16-1-1347-7 and 16-1-1348-7)
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Galina Ogeoneâ€™s
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on March 23, 2020, the
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that
she has a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief
and petitioner may seek relief, as appropriate, in CAAP-18-
0000449.  Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested
extraordinary writ.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204-05,
982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an
extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitionerElectronically Filed
