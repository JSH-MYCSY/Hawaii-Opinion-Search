MARK YOUNG, Petitioner,
vs.
THE HONORABLE GARY W. B. CHANG, Judge of the Circuit Court of the
First Circuit, State of Hawai#i, Respondent Judge.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CASE NO. T-05-1-0001 (GWBC))
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Mark Young’s petition
for writ of prohibition, filed on March 23, 2020, the documents
attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the
record, it appears that petitioner has alternative means to seek
relief and fails to demonstrate that the respondent judge has
acted beyond or in excess of his jurisdiction in presiding over
the contested matters.  Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to
the requested extraordinary writ.  See Honolulu Advertiser, Inc.
v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of
prohibition “is an extraordinary remedy . . . to restrain a judge
of an inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of his
jurisdiction”); Gannett Pac. Corp. v. Richardson, 59 Haw. 224,Electronically Filed
