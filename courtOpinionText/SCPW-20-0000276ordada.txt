IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I
                                                                 
IN RE HAROLD HARSHMAN, Petitioner.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Harold Harshmanâ€™s
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on April 7, 2020, the
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
the record, it appears that, under the standard by which this
court reviews a petition for writ of mandamus, petitioner fails
to demonstrate that he is entitled to the requested extraordinary
relief from this court.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204,
982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary
remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a
clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative
means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the
requested action).  Accordingly,Electronically Filed
Supreme Court

records and/or legal research division) to provide assistance to
