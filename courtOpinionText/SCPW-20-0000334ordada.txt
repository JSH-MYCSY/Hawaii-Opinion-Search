IN RE THOMAS LAURO, Petitioner.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CASE NO. 1CPN-19-0000002)
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Thomas Lauroâ€™s letter,
which was filed on April 30, 2020, as a petition for writ of
mandamus, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support
thereof, and the record, it appears that, at this time, based on
the information provided, petitioner is not entitled to the
requested extraordinary relief from this court.  See Kema v.
Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue
unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right
to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately
the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action).  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
mandamus is denied.   Electronically Filed
