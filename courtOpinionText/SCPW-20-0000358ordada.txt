ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CIVIL NO. 1CCV-19-0002169) 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of petitionersâ€™ petition for writ of 
mandamus, filed on May 6, 2020, the documents attached thereto 
and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioners fail to demonstrate that they have a clear and 
indisputable right to the requested relief and that they lack alternative means to seek relief. Petitioners, therefore, are not entitled to the requested extraordinary writ. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 
Hawai# i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action); Wong v. Fong, 60 Haw. 601, 604, 593 P.2d 386, 389 (1979) (ordinarily, a writ of mandamus is invoked in exceptional circumstances amounting to judicial usurpation of power); Honolulu Adv., Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of mandamus is meant to restrain a judge of an inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of his or her jurisdiction). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, May 22, 2020.
