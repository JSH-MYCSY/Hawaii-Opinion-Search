IN RE SHAREEN W. KAHEAKU, Petitioner.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of the document submitted by
petitioner Shareen W. Kaheaku entitled, “Motion granting writ of
habeas corpus,” which was filed as a petition for writ of habeas
corpus on May 18, 2020, and the record, it appears that
petitioner presents no special reason for this court to invoke
its jurisdiction.  See Oili v. Chang, 57 Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d
787, 788 (1976).  Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
habeas corpus is denied.
