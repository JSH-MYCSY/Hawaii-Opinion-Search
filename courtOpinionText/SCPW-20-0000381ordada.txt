(CASE NO. 1PC041001534)
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Christopher Lee
Slavick’s “Motion for this Court to Order Immediate Release Due
to Crimes Committed by (Former) Judge Karen Ahn,” which was filed
as a petition for writ of mandamus on May 18, 2020, the documents
attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the
record, it appears that petitioner is not entitled to the
requested extraordinary relief.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i
200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an
extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack
of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
obtain the requested action).  Accordingly,Electronically Filed
