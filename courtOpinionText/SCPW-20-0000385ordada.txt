KRISTOPHER KEALOHA, Petitioner,
vs.
THE HONORABLE FA #AUUGA TO#OTO#O, Judge of the Circuit Court of the
First Circuit, State of Hawai#i, Respondent Judge,
and
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CR. NOS. 1CPC-18-0001728 and 1CPC-19-0000390)
ORDER DENYING AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Wilson, JJ.,
and Circuit Judge Nakasone, assigned by reason of vacancy)
Upon consideration of petitioner Kristopher Kealohaâ€™s
amended petition for writ of mandamus, filed on August 3, 2020,
and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate
that he has a clear and indisputable right to relief from this
court or that he lacks alternative means to seek relief. 
Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to an extraordinary writ.

of mandamus is denied.
