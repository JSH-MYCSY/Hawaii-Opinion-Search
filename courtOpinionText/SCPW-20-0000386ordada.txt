ORIGINAL  PROCEEDING  
 
ORDER
  DENYING  WITHOUT  PREJUDICE  PETITION  FOR  WRIT  OF  MANDAMUS  
(By:  Recktenwald,  C.J.,  Nakayama,   McKenna,  Pollack,  and  Wilson,  JJ.)  
On May 21, 2020, Petitioners filed a petition for writ 
of mandamus in this original proceeding. On June 15, 2020, the 
respondent Hearing Officer filed a letter of no response. Also 
on June 15, 2020, answers were filed by Respondents Maui 
Planning Commission and County of Maui (“Planning Commission”);  2 
  In  Freitas  v.  Administrative  Dir.  of  the  Courts,  104  Hawaiʻi  
483,
  92  P.3d  993  (2004),  the  following  was  stated:  
         
     
        
      
       
         
         
       
         
          
         
        
      
          
       
        
 
 Mālama  Kakanilua,  Pele  Defense  Fund,  and  Hoʻoponopono  O  Mākena;  
and  BRE  Iconic  GWR  Owner,  LLC  (“BRE”).   Respondent  Director  of  
the  Department  of  Planning,  County  of  Maui  (“Department  of  
Planning”)  filed  a  joinder  to  the  answer  filed  by  the  Planning  
Commission.  
“courts consistently have found a right of access to 
civil proceedings and quasi-judicial administrative 
proceedings. ” Detroit Free Press v. Ashcroft, 195 
F.Supp.2d 937, 942 (E.D.Mich.2002) (emphasis added) 
(brackets and internal quotations omitted); see also 
Fitzgerald v. Hampton , 467 F.2d 755, 766 (D.C. Cir. 
1972) (finding due process right of access by the 
public and press to Civil Service Commission 
hearing). The U.S. District Court in Detroit Free 
Press held that there was a right to a public 
deportation hearing, 195 F. Supp. 2d at 943–44, and 
the plaintiff newspaper agency had a First Amendment 
right of access to immigration deportation 
proceedings. Id. at 944. That court applied a 
strict scrutiny analysis in determining the propriety 
of closing the immigration proceedings. Id. at 946– 
47. 
The  parties  appear  to  dispute  the  applicability  of  Freitas  to  
the  circumstances  of  this  case.   We  do  not  address  the  
applicability  of  Freitas  and  related  law  at  this  time.   We  note  
that  representations  in  the  email  communications,  which  were  
attached  to  BRE’s  submission  to  this  court,  reflect  discussions  
among  the  parties  regarding  the  issue  raised  in  the  petition.   
The  deputy  corporation  counsel  representing  the  Department  of  
Planning  stated  in  an  email  that  the  Planning  Department  did  not  
object  to  opening  the  proceedings  to  the  public.   The  email                           
 3 
         
         
           
         
          
         
          
         
             
        
           
        
           
          
            
           
          
           
          
        
 
  
 
            
              
       communications also appear to indicate that the Planning 
Department, BRE, and Intervenors agree that public access should 
be provided to the contested hearing by the Planning Commission. 
It appears that the parties generally favor arranging for 
livestream or alternative means for the public to observe the 
proceedings. We further note that the Planning Commission’s 
answer contends that the Commission was not given an adequate 
opportunity to address Petitioners’ request prior to the filing 
of the petition in this court and that “no denial of such right 
of public access has actually occurred.” 
Based on the record before this court, and the 
information and representations in the submissions, it therefore 
appears that, at this time, there may be an alternative means 
for Petitioners to seek the requested relief prior to the 
scheduled hearing. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawaiʻi 200, 204, 982 
P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary 
remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a 
clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative 
means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the 
requested action).1 Accordingly, and under these circumstances, 
1 The Planning Commission’s timely resolution of this issue does not 
depend on whether the parties are able to reach an agreement as to public 
access to the contested hearing.  4 
   IT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  that  the  petition  for  writ  of  
mandamus  is  denied  without  prejudice.
