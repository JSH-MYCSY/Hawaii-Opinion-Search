ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
AND MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, and McKenna, JJ.,
and Circuit Judge Watanabe, assigned by reason of vacancy,
with Wilson, J., concurring)
Upon consideration of petitioner Tekoa Ikaika Denomieâ€™s
petition for writ of habeas corpus, filed on September 2, 2020,
the motion for summary judgment, filed on September 11, 2020, the
respective supporting documents, and the record, it appears that
petitioner presents no special reason for this court to invoke
its jurisdiction and has alternative means to seek the requested
relief.  See Oili v. Chang, 54 Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 788
(1976).  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
habeas corpus and motion for summary judgment are denied.
