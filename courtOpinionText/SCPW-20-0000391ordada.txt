ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 1PC041001534) 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of petitioner Christopher Lee 
Slavick’s “Motion to Acknowledge Filing as Habeas Corpus 
Petition,” which was filed as a petition for writ of habeas corpus on May 27, 2020 (originally filed in CAAP-17-0000834), and the record, it appears that petitioner presents no special reason for this court to invoke its jurisdiction . See Oili v. Chang, 
54 Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of 
habeas corpus is denied. IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk of the 
appellate court shall process the petition for writ of habeas 
corpus without payment of the filing fee. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 3, 2020.
