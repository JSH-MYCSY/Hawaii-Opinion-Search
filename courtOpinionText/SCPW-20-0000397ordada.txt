IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
IN RE THOMAS LAURO, Petitioner. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 1CPN-19-0000002) 
ORDER DENYING “REQUEST FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
AND REQUEST FOR WRIT OF ERROR”
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of petitioner Thomas Lauro’s 
“Request for Writ of Mandamus and Request for Writ of Error”, 
which was filed on May 27, 2020, as a petition for writ of mandamus, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner is not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief from this court. See Kema v. Gaddis
, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 
(1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk of the 
appellate court shall process the petition for writ of mandamus 
without payment of the filing fee. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 3, 2020.
