LIKO O KALANI MARTIN, Petitioner,
vs.
DAVID IGE, Governor of the State of Hawai#i and future occupants
of the Executive Branch of the State of Hawai#i, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner’s “Petition for a Writ
of Prohibition & Justice”, filed on June 19, 2020, the documents
attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the
record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that
petitioner is entitled to the requested extraordinary relief from
this court or that petitioner lacks alternative means to seek
relief.  See Honolulu Adv., Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580
P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of prohibition “is an extraordinary
remedy . . . to restrain a judge of an inferior court from acting
beyond or in excess of his jurisdiction”); Gannett Pac. Corp. v.Electronically Filed

2Richardson, 59 Haw. 224, 226, 580 P.2d 49, 53 (1978) (a writ of
prohibition is not meant to serve as a legal remedy in lieu of
normal appellate procedures; rather, it is available in “rare and
exigent circumstances” where “allow[ing] the matter to wend its
way through the appellate process would not be in the public
interest and would work upon the public irreparable harm”). 
Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
prohibition is denied.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 24, 2020.
