CLAIMS SERVICES, Respondent/Insurance Carrier-Appellee, and 
JOHN MULLEN & COMPANY, INC., Respondents.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Dwight J. Vicente’s
“Notice of a Writ of Mandamus to the Supreme Court,” filed on
June 24, 2020, and the record, it appears that petitioner is
seeking relief from the ICA’s June 3, 2020 order dismissing his
appeal in CAAP-20-0000022 for lack of jurisdiction.  Petitioner
may seek appropriate relief by way of an application for writ of
certiorari.  See HRAP Rule 40.1.  Petitioner, therefore, is not
entitled to an extraordinary writ.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91
Hawai#i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is
an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack
of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
obtain the requested action).  Accordingly,Electronically Filed
