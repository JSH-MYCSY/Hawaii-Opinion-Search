2ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Wilson, JJ.,
and Circuit Judge Browning, assigned by reason of vacancy)
Upon consideration of petitioners’ petition for writ of
mandamus or other appropriate relief, filed on July 24, 2020, the
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
the record, it appears that, under the specific facts and
circumstances of this matter and the terms of the circuit court’s
July 2, 2020 “First Amended Order Granting in Part and Denying in
Part Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Production of Dole’s Settlement
Program Data for Epidemiological Analysis,” petitioners fail to
demonstrate that disclosure of the requested documents, subject
to a protective order and the circuit court’s stated limitations,
warrant the requested extraordinary relief.  See Kema v. Gaddis,
91 Hawai# i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of
mandamus is meant to restrain a judge of an inferior court who
has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant
and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a
subject properly before the court under circumstances in which he
or she has a legal duty to act); Cohan v. Ayabe, 732 Hawai# i 408,
418, 322 P.3d 948, 958 (2014).  Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
mandamus or other appropriate relief is denied. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, September 28, 2020.
