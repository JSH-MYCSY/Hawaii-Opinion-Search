ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
INTERIM ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, and McKenna, JJ., 
and Chief Judge Ginoza, assigned by reason of vacancy, with 
Wilson, J., dissenting1) 
 
On August 12, 2020, the Office of the Public Defender 
(“OPD”) filed a petition for extraordinary writ pursuant to HRS §§ 602-4, 602-5(5), and 602-5(6) and/or a writ of mandamus (“Petition”).  The Petition seeks, among other things, a 
reduction of the inmate populations at the State’s correctional 
centers and facilities in an effort to mitigate the harm that 
the COVID-19 pandemic may inflict upon the inmates, the  
correctional staff, and the people of Hawai‘ i.  In this regard, 
the Petition seeks the expedited release of certain categories 
of inmates from the State’s correctional centers and facilities,

Supreme Court
SCPW-20-0000509

 without the filing and hearing of individualized motions for 
release.  At the time the petition was filed, it was reported 
that more than 80 inmates and at least twelve staff members had 
tested positive for COVID-19 at the O‘ ahu Community Correctional 
Center (“OCCC”).   
By order entered on August 13, 2020, this court 
directed the Department of Public Safety (“DPS”) and Dwight 
Nadamoto, the Prosecuting Attorney for the City and County of 
Honolulu (“Prosecuting Attorney Nadamoto”), to file an answer to 
the Petition solely with respect to OCCC.  In the answer, DPS 
and Prosecuting Attorney Nadamoto were to address the process 
that should be implemented to facilitate the release of the category of defendants requested in the Petition, should the 
court allow for such release, including:  the COVID-19 screening 
process; the mechanism for providing the COVID-19 testing 
information to the court for each defendant identified for 
release; how positive, negative, and pending test results should 
be handled; the expected time frame to effectuate these steps; 
and any other issues that may be implicated by the requested release.  DPS and Prosecuting Attorney Nadamoto timely answered.  
  On August 14, 2020, this court held a hearing to 
address the Petition and the COVID-19 situation at OCCC.  
Appearing at the hearing were:  Susan Arnett on behalf of the 
OPD; Clare Connors on behalf of DPS, along with DPS Director 3 
 Nolan P. Espinda; and Prosecuting Attorney Nadamoto.  The OPD 
advocated for the immediate release of a certain category of 
non-violent defendants.  Prosecuting Attorney Nadamoto expressed 
that individualized assessments should be conducted for any 
inmate considered for release.  DPS explained, among other 
things, the status of its inmate COVID-19 testing process and 
the Department of Health’s assistance in addressing the surge in 
COVID-19 positive inmates at OCCC.    
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a public health 
emergency.  Since July 2020, Hawai‘ i has seen a surge of COVID-19 
cases in 
Hawai‘i, with record numbers of positive cases and 
increased hospitalizations being reported.  This court 
recognizes the impact of COVID-19 on Hawaiʻ i’s community 
correctional centers and facilities.  This court also recognizes 
public safety concerns regarding the release of inmates at OCCC 
into the community.  Responding to the impact of this crisis in 
our community correctional centers and facilities requires a 
careful consideration of interests, both for public health and public safety.  
Given the rising number of COVID-19 cases at OCCC and 
the difficulties with social distancing, there is urgent and 
immediate concern in reducing the inmate populations at OCCC to 
protect those who work at or are detained at OCCC, their 
families, and the community.  The immediacy of this concern is 4 
 also exacerbated in that the rising numbers of COVID-19 cases at 
OCCC will tax the limited resources of community health care 
providers, including hospital beds, ventilators, and personal 
protective equipment, and will also require the expenditure of 
additional resources to provide constitutionally mandated 
medical care. 
 At this time, additional information is necessary to 
assist the court and the parties in addressing the public health and safety concerns raised by the cluster of COVID-19 cases at 
OCCC and the Petition’s request for relief. 
Accordingly, upon consideration of the submissions and 
record in SCPW-20-0000509, the arguments presented at the 
hearing, and the current state of COVID-19 positive test results 
in our community, including at OCCC, and pursuant to this 
court’s authority under Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) §§ 602-
5(3) & (6) and § 706-625,  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: 
1. No later than 12:00 p.m. on Monday, August 17,
