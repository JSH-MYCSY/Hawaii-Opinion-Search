IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻ I 
 
 
IN THE MATTER OF INDIVIDUALS IN CUSTODY 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻ I 
 
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
INTERIM ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Wilson, JJ., 
and Chief Judge Ginoza, assigned by reason of vacancy) 
 
On August 12, 2020, the Office of the Public Defender 
(“OPD”) filed a petition for extraordinary writ pursuant to HRS 
§§ 602-4, 602-5(5), and 602-5(6) and/or a writ of mandamus (“Petition”).  The Petition seeks, among other things, a reduction of the inmate populations at the State’s correctional centers and facilities in an effort to mitigate the harm that the COVID-19 pandemic may inflict upon the inmates, the  
correctional staff, and the people of Hawai‘ i.  In this regard, 
the Petition seeks the expedited release of certain categories 
of inmates from the State’s correctional centers and facilities, without filing and hearing of individualized motions for 
release.   
In response to the petition, answers were filed by:   
(1) Nolan P. Espinda, Director of the Department of Public 
Safety, State of Hawai‘ i (“DPS”) and Edmund (Fred) K.B. Hyun, Electronically Filed
Supreme Court

 chairperson of the Hawaiʻ i Paroling Authority; (2) Mitchell D. 
Roth, Prosecuting Attorney for the County of Hawaiʻ i
; (3) Donald 
S. Guzman, Prosecuting Attorney for the County of Maui;  
(4) Dwight D. Nadamoto, Prosecuting Attorney for the City and County of Honolulu; and (5) Justin F. Kollar, Prosecuting 
Attorney for the County of Kauaʻ i.  The answers addressed the 
OPD’s requested relief, stated objections and concerns, and 
provided alternative considerations.      
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a public health 
emergency.  Since July 2020, Hawai‘ i has seen a surge in COVID-19 
cases, with record numbers of positive cases and increased hospitalizations being reported daily.  While the majority of 
the cases are on O
‘ahu, the neighbor island numbers have 
increased in recent days.  In addition, since the Petition was 
filed, it has been reported that more than two hundred inmates and over forty staff members have tested positive for COVID-19.  
While the majority of cases are related to the O‘ ahu Community 
Correctional Center (“OCCC”), there have been positive COVID-19 
test results in some of the other State correctional centers and facilities.   
This court recognizes the impact of COVID-19 on 
Hawaiʻi’s community correctional centers and facilities.  This 
court also recognizes, however, the significant public safety concerns regarding the release of inmates into the community.  While there is an urgent and immediate concern to respond to the impact of this crisis in our community correctional centers and facilities, such response requires a careful consideration of interests, both for public health and public safety.  
 At this time, additional information is necessary to 
assist the court and the parties in addressing the public health and safety concerns raised by the surge of COVID-19 cases in the 3 
 State, including at the correctional centers and facilities, and 
the Petition’s request for relief. 
Accordingly, upon consideration of the submissions and 
record in SCPW-20-0000509, and the current state of COVID-19 positive test results in our community and the State’s correctional centers and facilities, and pursuant to this 
court’s authority under Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) §§ 602-
5(3) & (6) and 706-625, Governor David Y. Ige’s Emergency 
Proclamations, and HRS § 601-1.5,  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: 1. No later than 12:00 p.m. on Saturday, August 22, 
2020, DPS shall provide to the OPD, the county prosecutors, and the Administrative Director of the Courts a list of all inmates at its correctional centers and facilities (excluding OCCC) who meet the following criteria, as applicable:
