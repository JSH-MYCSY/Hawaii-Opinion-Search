ORIGINAL PROCEEDING  
 
ORDER DENYING PETITIONER’S  
“MOTION TO COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH THIS COURT’S ORDERS” 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, and McKenna, JJ.,   
and Chief Judge Ginoza, assigned by reason of vacancy, 
with Wilson, J., dissenting ) 1
 
On August 24, 2020, in its response to the motion for 
clarification and/or reconsideration filed by respondent Nolan 
P. Espinda, Director of the Department of Public Safety (“DPS”)
, 
the Office of the Public Defender (“OPD”) included a section 
entitled “Motion to Compel Compliance with this Court’s Orders” 
(“Motion to Compel Compliance”).  The OPD sought various forms 
of relief.   
On August 27, 2020, DPS and Prosecuting Attorney 
Dwight Nadamoto each filed responses to the Motion to Compel 
Compliance.  The responses addressed the issues or concerns 
raised by the OPD, and requested that the court deny the Motion 
to Compel Compliance.

 /s/ Mark E. Recktenwald 
 /s/ Paula A. Nakayama 
 /s/ Sabrina S. McKenna 
 /s/ Lisa M. Ginoza Upon consideration of the Motion to Compel Compliance, 
the respective responses, and the record in this matter, the 
requests in the Motion to Compel Compliance are not within the 
scope of the relief previously ordered by this court or are 
otherwise not sufficiently supported.  Accordingly,  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to Compel 
Compliance is denied.  
Additionally, this court notes that the daily lists 
provided by DPS identifying the names of released inmates appear 
to include inmates released on grounds other than this court’s 
orders.
