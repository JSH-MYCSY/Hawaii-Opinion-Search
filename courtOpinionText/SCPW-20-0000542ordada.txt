f.k.a. MOTOOKA YAMAMOTO REVERE, LLLC, f.k.a. MOTOOKA & YAMAMOTO,

vs. 
 
THE HONORABLE RHONDA I.L. LOO, Judge of the Circuit Court of the

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CIV. NOS. 2CC081000293 and 2CC121000790) 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, and Wilson, JJ., 
Circuit Judge Ochiai, assigned in place of Nakayama, J., 
recused, and Circuit Judge Kim, assigned by reason of vacancy) 
 
  Upon consideration of Petitioners’ petition for writ 
of mandamus, filed on September 2, 2020, the documents attached 
thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, it 
appears that petitioners fail to demonstrate that they have a 
clear and indisputable right to relief and that they lack 
alternative means to seek relief.  Petitioners, therefore, are 
not entitled to the requested extraordinary writ.  See Kema v. Electronically Filed

Gaddis, 91 Hawai ‘i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue 
unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable 
right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress 
adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; 
where a court has discretion to act, mandamus will not lie to 
interfere with or control the exercise of that discretion, even 
when the judge has acted erroneously, unless the judge has 
exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and 
manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject 
properly before the court under circumstances in which he or she 
has a legal duty to act); Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 
Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (such a writ is not 
intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the 
trial courts, cure a mere legal error, or serve as a legal 
remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedure).  Accordingly,   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of 
mandamus is denied.
