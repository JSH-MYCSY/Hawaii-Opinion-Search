will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and
indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means toElectronically Filed

1359, 1361 (1996) (with respect to a public official, mandamus
relief is available to compel an official to perform a duty
allegedly owed to an individual only if the individual’s claim is
clear and certain, the official’s duty is ministerial and so
plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt, and no other remedy
is available).  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
mandamus is denied.
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk of the
appellate court shall process the petition for writ of mandamus
without payment of the filing fee.
