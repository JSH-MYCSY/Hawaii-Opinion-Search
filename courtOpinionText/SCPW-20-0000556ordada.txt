IN THE MATTER OF ALEX RODRIGUEZ AND
OTHER INDIVIDUALS SIMILARLY SITUATED IN THE
CUSTODY OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I, Petitioners.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER DENYING “PETITION FOR EXTRAORDINARY WRIT PURSUANT TO HRS §§
602-4, 602-5(5), and 602-5(6) AND/OR FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS”
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, and McKenna, JJ.,
and Intermediate Court of Appeals Chief Judge Ginoza,
assigned by reason of vacancy, with Wilson, J., dissenting )1
Upon consideration of petitioners’ “Petition for
Extraordinary Writ Pursuant to HRS §§ 602-4, 602-5(5), and 602-
5(6) and/or for Writ of Mandamus,” filed on September 10, 2020,
the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof,
and the record, it appears that petitioners fail to demonstrate
that they are entitled to the requested extraordinary relief from
this court.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204, 982 P.2d
334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy
that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear
and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means
to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
action).  Accordingly,
