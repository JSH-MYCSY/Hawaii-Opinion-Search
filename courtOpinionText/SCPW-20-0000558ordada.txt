Upon consideration of petitioner’s “Motion to Release
Non-Violent Community Custody Prisoner from Custody with Special
Release Terms and Conditions Amid the Coronavirus COVID-19 Bio-
Terrorism Pandemic”, which was filed as a petition on September

thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to
demonstrate that he is entitled to the requested extraordinary
relief from this court.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204,
982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary
remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a
clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative
means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the
requested action); Oili v. Chang, 54 Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787,
788 (1976) (“[The supreme] court will not exercise its originalElectronically Filed
