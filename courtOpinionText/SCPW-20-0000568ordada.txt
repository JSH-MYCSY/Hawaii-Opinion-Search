Dkt. 74 ODDPappeal and the record therein, petitioner’s request for relief is
more appropriate for consideration in SCOT-20-0000569.  See Kema
v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ
of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless
the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to
relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the
alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; it is not intended
to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the trial
courts, cure a mere legal error, or serve as a legal remedy in
lieu of normal appellate procedures).  Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for
extraordinary writ and/or for writ of mandamus is denied. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, January 14, 2021.
