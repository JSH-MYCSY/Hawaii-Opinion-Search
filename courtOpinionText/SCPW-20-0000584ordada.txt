for the Bankruptcy Estate of Aloha Sports Inc.’s petition for
writ of mandamus, filed on September 28, 2020, the documents
attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the
record, it appears that, under the specific facts and

Dkt. 27 ODDPunderlying dispute is not warranted or necessary.  It cannot be
said that the respondent judge exceeded his jurisdiction,
committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or refused
to act on a matter in addressing the subject issue, and
petitioner has alternative means to seek relief.  Petitioner,
therefore, is not entitled to the requested extraordinary writ. 
See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39
(1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will
not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and
indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to
redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
action; such a writ is meant to restrain a judge of an inferior
court who has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has committed a
flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act
on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in
which he or she has a legal duty to act).  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
mandamus is denied.
