ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Nakayama, Acting C.J., McKenna and Wilson, JJ.,
Circuit Judge Cataldo, in place of Recktenwald, C.J., recused,
and Circuit Judge Remigio, assigned by reason of vacancy)
Upon consideration of petitioner Thomas Frank Schmidt
and Lorinna Jhincil Schmidtâ€™s petition for writ of mandamus,
filed on October 20, 2020, the documents attached thereto and
submitted in support thereof, and the record, it appears that
petitioners fail to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to
the requested relief and have alternative means to seek relief. 
Petitioners, therefore, are not entitled to the requested
extraordinary writ.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204, 982

clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative
means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the
requested action; a writ of mandamus is not intended to supersede
the legal discretionary authority of the trial courts, cure a
mere legal error, or serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal
appellate procedures).  Accordingly,   
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
mandamus is denied.
