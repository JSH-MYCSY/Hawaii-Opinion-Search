ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, J., and
Circuit Judge Ashford, assigned by reason of vacancy,
with Wilson, J., dissenting, with whom McKenna, J., joins)

alternative means to seek relief.  Petitioner, therefore, is not
entitled to the requested extraordinary writ.  See Kema v.
