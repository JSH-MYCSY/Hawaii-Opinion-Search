DAVID BENNETT GRIFFIN, Petitioner,
vs.
THE HONORABLE CYNTHIA T. TAI,
Judge of the Family Court of the Third Circuit,
State of Hawai#i, Respondent Judge,
and
AMPORN NOIHA GRIFFIN, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CASE NO. 3DV171000134K)
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Wilson, JJ.,
and Circuit Judge Watanabe, assigned by reason of vacancy)
Upon consideration of petitioner David Bennett
Griffinâ€™s petition for writ of mandamus, filed on November 16,
2020, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support
thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner, who has an
appeal pending in CAAP-20-0000400, fails to demonstrate that he
has a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief from
this court and has alternative means to seek relief.  Petitioner,
therefore, is not entitled to the requested extraordinary writ. 
See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999)Electronically Filed

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
mandamus is denied.  
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, December 11, 2020.
