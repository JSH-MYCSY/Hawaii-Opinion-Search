ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND/OR MANDAMUS

Upon consideration of petitioner Erik Willisâ€™s petition
for writ of habeas corpus and/or mandamus, filed on December 21,
2020, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support
thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner, who is
currently seeking relief in the underlying case, fails to
demonstrate that he is entitled to the requested extraordinary
writ from this court at this juncture.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91
