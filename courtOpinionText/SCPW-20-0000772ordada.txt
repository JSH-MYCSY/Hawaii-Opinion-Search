IN RE CHRIS SLAVICK, Petitioner.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Chris Slavickâ€™s
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on December 28, 2020, it
appears that, based on the record before this court, petitioner
fails to demonstrate that he has a clear and indisputable right
to relief and that he lacks alternative means to seek relief. 
Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested
extraordinary writ.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204, 982
P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary
remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a
clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative
means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the
requested action).  Accordingly,Electronically Filed
