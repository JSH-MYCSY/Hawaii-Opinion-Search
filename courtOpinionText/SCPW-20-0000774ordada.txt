DENNIS C. DEREGO, Petitioner,
vs.
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CASE NO. 2FC151000209)
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Eddins, JJ.,
with Wilson, J., dissenting)
Upon consideration of petitioner Dennis C. DeRegoâ€™s
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on December 29, 2020, the
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that
he has a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief and
has alternative means to seek relief, including seeking relief in
the circuit court through a Hawai# i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule
40 petition or seeking relief from the Hawai#i Paroling
Authority, as provided by law.  Petitioner, therefore, is not
entitled to the requested extraordinary writ from this court.

Dkt. 7 ODDP(a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not
issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable
right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress
adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). 
Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
mandamus is denied.
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk of the
appellate court shall process the petition for writ of mandamus
without payment of the filing fee.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 16, 2021.
