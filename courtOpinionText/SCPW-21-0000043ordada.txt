IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
I
N RE CHRIS SLAVICK, Petitioner. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of petitioner Chris Slavickâ€™s 
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on February 1, 2021, the 
supporting documents, and the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that he has a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief and has alternative means to seek relief, including seeking relief in the circuit court case (Case No. 1PC041001534), which petitioner is currently pursuing, or seeking relief from the 
Hawai# i Paroling Authority, as provided by law. 
Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested extraordinary writ.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204, 982 
P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the 
requested action).  Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk of the 
appellate court shall process the petition for writ of mandamus without payment of the filing fee. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, February 12, 2021.
