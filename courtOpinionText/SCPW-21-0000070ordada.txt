Upon consideration of petitioner Tarval Webster’s
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on February 16, 2021, the
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
the record, it appears that petitioner’s “Petition to Vacate, Set

first circuit court on October 6, 2020, assigned case number
