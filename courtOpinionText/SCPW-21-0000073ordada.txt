ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CAAP-20-0000076; CASE NO. 1PR191000014)
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Christopher Lee
Slavick’s “Motion for Release of Prisoner Pending Disposition of
Application for Habeas Corpus,” which was filed as a petition for
writ of mandamus on February 17, 2021, and the record, it appears
that petitioner fails to present any basis upon which he is
entitled to be released from custody by this court, and has
alternative means to seek relief, including seeking release from
the Hawai#i Paroling Authority, as provided by law.  Petitioner,
therefore, is not entitled to the requested extraordinary writ.
