ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CASE NO. 3PC930000141)
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Francis P.
Grandinetti’s submission to this court, which was filed as a
petition for writ of habeas corpus on March 19, 2021, and the
record, it appears that petitioner presents no special reason for
this court to invoke its jurisdiction and has alternative means
to seek the requested relief, including seeking relief in his
underlying circuit court proceeding or before the Hawai#i
Paroling Authority, as provided by law.  See Oili v. Chang, 54
Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976).  Petitioner is
represented by court-appointed counsel in the underlying
proceeding in the circuit court and should seek counsel’s
assistance.  Accordingly,Electronically Filed
