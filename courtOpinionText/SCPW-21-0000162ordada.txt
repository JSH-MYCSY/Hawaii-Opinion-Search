WILLIAM KOTIS, Petitioner,
vs.
THE HONORABLE RICHARD K. PERKINS,
Judge of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit,
State of Hawai#i (retired), Respondent Judge,
and
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CR. NO. 1PC920002780)
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner William Kotisâ€™s
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on March 19, 2021, the
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that
he has a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief
from this court and has alternative means to seek relief,
including seeking relief pursuant to Hawai# i Rules of Penal
Procedure Rule 40 as provided by law.  Petitioner, therefore, is
not entitled to the requested extraordinary writ.  See Kema v.Electronically Filed

mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless
the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to
relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the
alleged wrong or obtain the requested action).  Accordingly,  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
mandamus is denied. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai#i, March 23, 2021.
