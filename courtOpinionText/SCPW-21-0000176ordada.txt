ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Eddins JJ.,
and Circuit Judge Kawano, in place of Wilson, J., recused)
Upon consideration of petitioner Adam E. Florence,
Jr.â€™s petition for writ of mandamus, filed on March 22, 2021, the
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
the record, it appears that petitioner fails to demonstrate that
he has a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief
from this court and has alternative means to seek relief,
including seeking relief pursuant to Hawai# i Rules of Penal
Procedure Rule 40 as provided by law.  Petitioner, therefore, is
not entitled to the requested extraordinary writ.  See Kema v.
Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of
mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unlessElectronically Filed
