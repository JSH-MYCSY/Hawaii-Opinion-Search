(FC-S NO. 18-00077)
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
AND MOTION FOR STAY
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Waila Sarcedoâ€™s
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on April 9, 2021, the motion
for stay, filed on April 11, 2021, the respective supporting
documents, and the record, it appears that, based on the
information presented to this court, petitioner has filed an
appeal in the Intermediate Court of Appeals in CAAP-21-0000196,
and may seek relief in the appeal or in the family court as
provided by law.  Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the
extraordinary relief or a stay requested from this court.  See
Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a
