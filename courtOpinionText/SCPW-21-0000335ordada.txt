HERBERT H. BROWN, Petitioner,
vs.
THE HONORABLE STEVEN ALM,
Judge of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit,
State of Hawai#i (retired), Respondent Judge,
and
STATE OF HAWAI#I, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CR. NO. 1PC031000926; CASE NO. 1PR181000003)
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Herbert H. Brownâ€™s
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on May 18, 2021, the
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
the record, petitioner fails to demonstrate that he has a clear
and indisputable right to the requested relief from this court
and appears to be seeking similar relief in the circuit court. 
Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested
extraordinary writ.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204, 982Electronically Filed
