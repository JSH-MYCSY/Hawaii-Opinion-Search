ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Mark D. Cairesâ€™s
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on May 18, 2021, the
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
the record, petitioner fails to demonstrate that he has a clear

and appears to be seeking similar relief in the circuit court. 
Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested
extraordinary writ.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204, 982
