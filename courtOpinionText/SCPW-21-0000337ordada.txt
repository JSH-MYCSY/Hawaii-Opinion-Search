MARK D. CAIRES, Petitioner,
vs.
THE HONORABLE ROBERT D.S. KIM,
Judge of the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit,
State of Hawai#i, Respondent Judge,
and
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent.
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CR. NO. 3PC02100157K)
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Mark D. Cairesâ€™s
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on May 19, 2021, the
documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and
the record, petitioner fails to demonstrate that he has a clear
and indisputable right to the requested relief from this court
and appears to be seeking similar relief in the circuit court. 
Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested
extraordinary writ.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204, 982
P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary
remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates aElectronically Filed

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of

appellate court shall process the petition for writ of mandamus
without payment of the filing fees.
