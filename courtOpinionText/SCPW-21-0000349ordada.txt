ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(CASE NO. 1PC041001534; CAAP-20-0000076)
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Christopher Lee
Slavickâ€™s petition for writ of mandamus, filed on May 24, 2021,
and the record, petitioner fails to demonstrate that he has a
clear and indisputable right to the requested relief from this
court and may seek relief in his pending case.  Petitioner has
not requested a waiver of the photocopying costs.  Petitioner,
therefore, is not entitled to the requested extraordinary writ. 
See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999)
(a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not
issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable
right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redressElectronically Filed
