ORIGINAL PROCEEDING

ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Bentley C. Adams’s
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on June 14, 2021, the
supplemental filings, the respective supporting documents, and
the record, petitioner fails to demonstrate that he has a clear
and indisputable right to the requested relief or that the
respondent judge has flagrantly and manifestly abused his
discretion in requiring individuals to wear facial coverings
while entering and remaining in the fifth circuit courthouse.

Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested
extraordinary writ.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204-05,
982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an
extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack
of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
obtain the requested action; such a writ is meant to restrain a
judge of an inferior court who has exceeded his or her
jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of
discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before
the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty
to act).  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
mandamus is denied.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 28, 2021.
