indisputable right to relief from this court and may seek relief
in the underlying proceeding.  Petitioner, therefore, is not
entitled to the requested extraordinary writ.  See Kema v.
Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of
mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless
the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to
