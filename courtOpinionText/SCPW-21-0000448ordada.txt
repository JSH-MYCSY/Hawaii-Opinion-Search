IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
  
CHRISTOPHER A. TENIS, Petitioner, 
vs. 
THE HONORABLE ROWENA A. SOMERVILLE,
Judge of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit,
State of Hawai# i, Respondent Judge, 
and 
STATE OF 
HAWAI# I, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 1CPN-21-0000024)
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of petitioner Christopher Tenisâ€™s 
petition for writ of mandamus, and the record, petitioner fails 
to demonstrate that he is entitled to the requested extraordinary writ. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 
(1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action); Honolulu Adv., Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of mandamus is meant to restrain a judge of 
an inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of his or her jurisdiction or where the judge has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion). Accordingly, 
It is ordered that the petition for writ of mandamus is 
denied.
