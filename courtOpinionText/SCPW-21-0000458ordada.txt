Circuit Judge To#oto#o, assigned in place of Eddins, J., recused)
Upon consideration of the document submitted by

Judgment of Acquittal,” which was filed as a petition for writ of
mandamus on August 9, 2021, petitioner fails to demonstrate that

338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that
will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and
indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to
redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested
action).  Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
mandamus is denied.
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk of theElectronically Filed
