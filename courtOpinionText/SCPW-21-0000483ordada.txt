(By:  Recktenwald,  C.J.,  Nakayama,   McKenna,  Wilson,  and  Eddins,   JJ.) 1
The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented 
public health emergency of global impact. Throughout the 
pandemic, the Office of the Public Defender (“OPD”) has 
initiated three original proceedings seeking relief related to 
certain categories of inmates as well as pandemic-related 
conditions at Hawai‘i’s community  correctional centers  and 
facilities. This order disposes of the third proceeding filed 
on August 27, 2021. 
1 Chief Justice Recktenwald and Justices Nakayama, McKenna, and Eddins 
join in Part One, with Justice McKenna also concurring and dissenting 
separately, in which Justice Wilson joins as to Sections I and III.A., 
Justice Wilson concurring and dissenting separately, and Justice Eddins also 
concurring separately. Chief Justice Recktenwald and Justices Nakayama, 
McKenna, and Wilson join in Part Two, with Justice Eddins dissenting.  2 
   
  
      
         
            
        
       
  
          
         
         
        
           
          
         
          
            
          
        
    
           
       
          
           
        
           
                     
               
             
    
 PART ONE 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Eddins, JJ., 
with McKenna, J., also concurring in part and dissenting 
in part separately, in which Wilson, J., joins as to Sections I 
and III.A., Wilson, J., concurring and dissenting separately, 
and Eddins, J., also concurring separately) 
In 2020, on two separate occasions, OPD filed 
petitions for an extraordinary writ seeking, among other things, 
the expedited release of certain categories of inmates at 
Hawaiʻi’s communi ty correctional centers  and facilities. When 
the first petitions were filed in late March 2020,2 the potential 
catastrophic impact of the pandemic on our State, the community, 
our citizens, and our correctional centers and facilities was 
not determinable. There were lockdowns across the nation and 
the death toll was rising. When the second petition was filed 
in early August 2020, the Oʻahu Co mmunity Correctional Center,  in 
particular, was experiencing a concerning surge in COVID-19 
positive cases. 
At the time
 these petitions were filed, the pandemic’s 
trajectory remained uncertain and vaccinations were not 
available. Given the virulent transmission of the virus within 
close quarters and the likelihood that an outbreak and spread of 
the virus in Hawaiʻi’s community  correctional  centers and 
facilities had the potential to tax the capacities of the health 
2 The first petition was filed on March 24, 2020 in SCPW-20-0000200. A 
second petition was filed on March 26, 2020 in SCPW-20-0000213. The two 
proceedings were thereafter consolidated.  3 
  
         
           
       
         
         
          
         
           
            
         
        
    
           
          
         
         
     
            
           
          
         
        
         
         care systems and the limited resources of the community health 
providers on each of the islands as the State continued to 
navigate this unprecedented pandemic, this court provided 
multiple forms of relief, including, among other things, setting 
forth procedures and processes for consideration by the courts 
for the release of inmates and pretrial detainees who met 
certain criteria, which included an opportunity for objection to 
the release. With respect to the first petition, this court 
also appointed a Special Master to work with the parties in a 
collaborative and expeditious manner to address the issues and 
facilitate a resolution, while protecting public health and 
public safety. 
Since these petitions were filed, three different 
vaccines have been made available to the public including every 
inmate and staff at Hawaiʻi’s community correctional  centers and 
facilities. Inmates have been prioritized for vaccination and 
are encouraged to get vaccinated. 
In addition, a
 class of inmates filed a federal court 
lawsuit (Chatman v. et al. v. Otani et al., Civil No. 21-00268-
JAO-KJM (D. Haw.)) alleging that the Department of Public Safety 
(“DPS”) mishandled the pandemic and failed to implement its 
Pandemic Response Plan (“PRP”) in violation of their 
constitutional rights. On September 2, 2021, the parties 
reached a settlement, which includes the establishment of a  4 
  
       
          
          
           
         
           
  
         
       
        
        
         
       
       
      
        
      
                     
             
 
         
        
      
     
 
        
       
       
       
     
      
 
 
       
        
      
    
 
          
       
    
 
         
     
       
  five-member panel of experts to provide advice and 
recommendations to assist DPS in its pandemic response.3 
On August 27, 2021, shortly before the settlement was 
executed in Chatman v. Otani, OPD filed another petition for an 
extraordinary writ pursuant to HRS §§ 602-4, 602-5(5), and 602-
5(6) and/or for writ of mandamus. The petition seeks the 
following relief: 
1) Order the Circuit, Family and District courts 
that when adjudicating motions for release: 
(a) release shall be presumed unless the court 
finds that the release of the individual would 
pose a significant risk to the safety of the 
individual or the public; (b) design capacity 
(as opposed to operational capacity) of the 
correctional facility shall be taken into 
consideration; (c) the health risk posed by the 
COVID-19 pandemic should be taken into 
3 As part of the settlement, DPS agreed, among other conditions, to: 
• screen and quarantine people newly admitted to 
a correctional facility as provided in its PRP, 
and subject to any conditions, modifications 
and/or exceptions set forth therein; 
• immediately isolate those who exhibit COVID-19 
symptoms and those who test positive for COVID-
19 infection as medically appropriate and in 
accordance with the PRP, taking into account 
available space, structural limitations, and 
staffing and other resources within each 
facility; 
• provide reasonably sufficient cleaning supplies 
to allow all inmates in its custody in 
correctional facilities to wipe down phones 
before they use them; 
• provide a minimum of two cloth or other 
appropriate face masks per person, as provided 
in the PRP; and 
• require staff to wear appropriate face masks 
where necessary within the correctional 
facilities as provided for in the PRP.  5

review protocols, the ability to social 
distance and make recommendations. 
4) Order test
ing for COVID-19 for all incarcerated 
persons and staff at Hawaiʻi correctional 
fa
cilities and to notify all parties of any 
positive or presumptive-positive test results 
for any incarcerated person. The information 
released to the parties should include the 
individual’s
 name, date of test and date of 
test result. 
5) Order the Circuit, Family and District courts 
to suspend the custodial portions of such 
sentence until the conclusion of the COVID-19 
pandemic or until deemed satisfied for 
individuals serving intermittent sentences. 
6) Order that the practice of no cash bail, 
including the release of individuals on their 
own recognizance, on signature bonds, or on 
supervised release, should be regularly 
employed, and pretrial detainees who are not a 
risk to public safety or a flight risk should 
not be held simply because they do not have the 
means to post cash bail. 
7) Order the HPA to expeditiously address requests 
for early parole consideration, including 
conducting hearings using remote technology. 
The HPA should also consider release of 
incarcerated persons who are most vulnerable to 
the virus, which includes individuals who are 
65 years old and older, have underlying health 
conditions, who are pregnant, and those 
individuals being held on technical parole 
violations (i.e. curfew violations, failure to 
report as directed, etc.) or who have been

 22,  2021  hearing,  the  record  is  insufficient  to  warrant  the  
extraordinary  relief  requested  except  as  it  relates  to  DPS’s 
compliance  with  the  requirements  of  HRS  §  353-6.2.    4 
Unlike  when  OPD  filed  its  August  2020  petition,  the  
total  number  of  active  positive  COVID-19  cases  among  inmates   in  
all  Hawaiʻi  community  correctional   centers   and  facilities   as  of  
October  8,  2021  is  34.   Vaccines  are  now  widely  available  to  all  
inmates,  and  it  has  been  reported  that  statewide,  as  of  
September  14,  2021,  66%  of  inmates  are  fully  vaccinated.   
Additionally,  as  this  court  has  stated  in  the  prior  proceedings,   
OPD  or  defense  counsel  are  not  precluded  from  filing  individual  
motions  seeking  the  release  of  any  inmate  or  pretrial  detainee,  
and  the  State  continues  to  have  the  option  of  filing  individual  
4 HRS § 353-6.2 provides as follows: 
Community correctional centers; periodic reviews of 
pretrial detainees. 
(a) The relevant community correctional centers, on 
a periodic basis but no less frequently than every 
three months, shall conduct reviews of pretrial 
detainees to reassess whether a detainee should 
remain in custody or whether new information or a 
change in circumstances warrants reconsideration of a 
detainee’s pretrial release or supervision. 
(b) For each review conducted pursuant to 
subsection (a), the relevant community correctional 
center shall transmit its findings and 
recommendations by correspondence or electronically 
to the appropriate court, prosecuting attorney, and 
defense counsel. 
(c) If a motion to modify bail is filed pursuant to 
a recommendation made pursuant to subsection (b), a 
hearing shall be scheduled at which the court shall 
consider the motion.  9 
  
          
            
         
         
          
          
          
        
         
          
       
        
   
        
            
        
          
          
          
    
 
                     
          
            
              
           
         motions seeking to modify the release status of any defendant. 
OPD has not shown that they have been precluded from using this 
procedural mechanism, or substantiate why this procedure is an 
inadequate remedy. Moreover, the trial courts have full 
discretion whether to set bail and to impose conditions of 
release.5 Further, the relief that is being requested regarding 
adherence to public health standards and compliance with the PRP 
within the correctional centers and facilities are currently 
being reviewed by the five-member panel established under the 
settlement agreement in Chatman v. Otani. And, finally, issues 
regarding inmate populations may be addressed through 
alternative means, including by the Hawai‘i Correctional Systems 
Oversight
 Commission. 
As to OPD’s request
 for relief regarding compliance 
with HRS § 353-6.2, there is dispute as to whether DPS has 
conducted the periodic reviews and provided the required 
information. At the hearing, DPS acknowledged that this action 
is a “ministerial” duty and indicated that it “intends” and 
“plans” to conduct the review and transmit the information as 
statutorily required. 
Accordingly, 
5 This court notes Hawai‘i’ s co nstitutional protection prohibiting the 
imposition of “punishment” pending trial as well as the setting of excessive 
bail. See Ha
w. Const. art. I, § 12. These constitutional principles should 
serve as guidance in determining whether to impose bail, particularly in 
light of the impact of the pandemic.  10 
  It  is  ordered  that  the  petition  is  granted  in  part  and  
denied  in  part  as  follows:  
       
 
      
        
     
       
       
       
       
 
  
        
    
 
           
        
 
        
         
            
          
         
             
    
    
    /s/ Mark E. Recktenwald 1.  DPS  shall  comply  with   the  requirements  of  HRS  
§  353-6.2,  including  timely  transmitting  its  findings  and   
recommendations by correspondence or electronically
 to the 
appropriate court, prosecuting attorney, and defense counsel.

PART TWO 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Wilson, JJ., 
with Eddins, J., dissenting) 
I. This Court Has the Authority to Grant Relief Similar to 
That Ordered in the Two Prior Original Proceedings. 
Justice Eddins’s concurrence questions this court’s 
authority to grant additional relief beyond ordering DPS to 
comply with HRS § 353-6.2. Although a majority of the court 
determined in Part One that OPD has failed to demonstrate 
entitlement to such additional relief, we nevertheless take this 
opportunity to address this court’s inherent, constitutional and  11 
  
 
           
           
         
            
         
         
        
           
        
         
           
         
        
            
         
                     
               
       
 
 statutory  authority  to  grant  extraordinary  relief  in  unique  
circumstances.   Specifically,  we  reaffirm  this  court’s  authority 
to  provide  the  relief  the  court  granted  with  respect  to  the  
prior  OPD  petitions   (e.g.,  the  March  2020  and  August  2020  
petitions).   
OPD sought a wide range of relief in the prior 
proceedings, some of which was granted, and much of which was 
denied without discussion. In separate filings, Justice Wilson 
dissented from the court’s denial of those items of relief. The 
relief that was granted generally focused on expedited decision 
making with regard to whether certain lower-risk inmates in 
custody should be released, consistent with protecting public 
safety. The premise of that relief was that ordinary mechanisms 
for determining individualized requests for release could not 
work quickly enough to meet the extraordinary circumstances that 
were presented (1) in the very early days of the COVID-19 
pandemic in March-April 2020, and (2) when COVID cases 
“erupt[ed]” at the Oahu Community Correctional Center (“OCCC”) 
in August 2020.6 The court also appointed a Special Master, the 
Honorable Daniel R. Foley (ret.), to work with interested

      The  role  of  the  Special  Master  is  to  work  with  
the  parties  in  a  collaborative  and  expeditious  manner  
to  address  the  issues  raised  in  the  two  petitions  and  
to  facilitate  a  resolution  while  protecting  public  
health  and  public  safety.   The  Special  Master  may  
include,  as  part  of  these  efforts  and  discussions,  
members  of  the  public  health  community  and  other  
affected  agencies.  
     Safety  of  the  inmates,  staff,  and  the  public  are  
imperative.   The  parties  shall  consider  viable  
options  to  keep  inmates  and  the  public  safe  (e.g.,  
bracelet  monitoring,  alternative  locations  to  house  
inmates,  inmate  categories  such  as  age  or  medical  
condition,  etc.).   
 
   
 . . . 
     The  S
pecial  Master  shall  convene  and  conduct  
meetings  with  the  parties  and  any  community  agency

discretion,  to  carrying  out  his  role.

Master  (May  28,  2020)  at  page  3.   8
As set forth below, this court has the authority under 
the constitution, the court’s inherent powers, and various 
statutes, to provide extraordinary relief when circumstances 
warrant. This court has previously stated that such power 
should be used sparingly, such as when existing remedies are 
inadequate, or would take too long to implement. We reaffirm 
those principles now, as well as the court’s determination that 
the circumstances that existed in March-April and August 2020, 
justified the use of those extraordinary powers. We reject the 
suggestion that the court’s authority to provide such relief was 
restricted by its rule-making authority. Finally, we note that 
courts in other jurisdictions relied on similar powers to 
provide relief in the face of the pandemic. 
Our  constitution  vests   the  “judicial  power  of  the  
State”  in  the  courts.   Haw.  Const.  art.  VI,  section  1.   “Nowhere 
in  [the  constitution]  is  the  exact  nature  of  the  ‘judicial  
8 The Fifth Summary Report noted, “The parties and stakeholders have 
acted admirably under difficult circumstances in carrying out this Court’s 
orders. Differences among them have been great at times, but all have done 
their best to work in a collaborative fashion as encouraged by this Court, 
despite their differences.” Fifth Summary Report and Recommendations of the

   power’ defined.” State v. Moriwake, 65 Haw. 47, 55, 647 P.2d 
705,  711-12  (1982)  (citations   omitted).   But  “speaking  
generally,  the  ‘inherent  power  of  the  court  is  the  power  to  
protect  itself;  the  power  to  administer  justice  whether  any  
previous  form  of  remedy  has  been  granted  or  not;  the  power  to  
promulgate rules for its
 practice; and the power to provide 
process where none exists.’” Id. at 55, 647 P.2d 712 (quoting 
In re Bruen, 172 P.1152, 1153 (Wash. 1918)) (emphasis added). 
This  court  has  held   that  the  “essentially  inherent  or  implied 
powers  of  the  court  are  by  their  nature  impracticable  if  not  
impossible of all-inclusive enumeration.”9 Id. 
Our  legislature  has  enumerated   the  inherent  powers  
conferred  on  our  courts  by  the  constitution  in  several  
provisions  of  HRS  ch.  602.  These  include   this  court’s   power  10 
9 In Moriwake , the court interpreted the trial court’s inherent power 
to “administer justice” pursuant to HRS § 603-21.9(6) (1976) — a provision 
nearly identical to HRS § 602-5(a)(6) — to include the power to sua sponte 
dismiss a manslaughter indictment with prejudice after two mistrials. The 
court held that in deciding when to exercise this power, courts must consider 
the interest of the public in the proper administration of justice as well as 
the fundamental fairness owed to a defendant, “with the added ingredient of 
the orderly functioning of the court system.” Moriwake , 65 Haw. at 56, 647 
P.2d at 712 (citation omitted). 
10 See id. at 55 n.13, 647 P.2d at 712 n.13 (“In HRS § 603-21.9 (1976), 
our legislature has undertaken the enumeration of the inherent powers 
conferred on our circuit courts by the constitution.”); Farmer v. Admin. Dir. 
of Ct., State of Haw., 94 Hawai i  232, 241 , 11 P.3d 457, 466 (2000) (“[T]he 
inherent power of the supreme court is codified in HRS § 602-5(7) [presently 
§ 602-5(a)(6)], which acknowledge[s] this court’s jurisdiction and power 
‘[t]o make and award such judgments, decrees, orders and mandates, issue such 
executions and other processes, and do such other acts and take such other 
steps as may be necessary to carry into full effect the powers which are or 
shall be given to it by law or for the promotion of justice in matters 
pending before it.’”).  15 
  
          
           
         
           
            
              
            
             
         
         
           
         
          
 
 
          
         
          
              
        
             
         
            “[t]o make or issue any order or writ necessary or appropriate 
in aid of its jurisdiction,” HRS § 602-5(a)(5), and “[t]o make 
and award such judgments, decrees, orders and mandates, issue 
such executions and other processes, and do such other acts and 
take such other steps as may be necessary to carry into full 
effect the powers which are or shall be given to it by law or 
for the promotion of justice in matters pending before it.” HRS 
§ 602-5(a)(6). Pursuant to HRS § 602-4, this court also has the 
power of “general superintendence of all courts of inferior 
jurisdiction to prevent and correct errors and abuses therein 
where no other remedy is expressly provided by law.” 
In recognizing that the inherent powers vested in our 
courts are broad and not susceptible to precise enumeration, the 
court  has  invoked  those   powers  with  restraint,  in  circumstances  
where  existing  remedies  were  either  inadequate  or  would  take  too 
long  to  implement.   See,  e.g.,  State  v.  Moniz,  69  Haw.  370,  373, 
742 P.2d 373, 376
 (1987) (“[A] strong commitment to the 
prudential rules shaping the exercise of our jurisdiction has 
resulted in a sparing use of this extraordinary power.” (citing 
State v. Fields, 67 Haw. 268, 276, 686 P.2d 1379, 1386 (1978)). 
Similarly, in Gannett Pac. Corp. v. Richardson, the 
court held that “[o]nly where there is urgent reason . . . for 
the invocation of this court’s supervisory jurisdiction over the 
lower courts, under both HRS §§ 602-4 and 602-5, will this court  16 
   
        
            
            
         
           
           
             
    
          
          
         
            
           
        
            
             
                  
            
    
       
       
       
     
          
         
        
        
        
 
 consider departing from [the doctrine of res judicata].” 59 
Haw. 224, 226-27, 580 P.2d 49, 53 (1978). There, the court 
noted that “we have deviated from this rule only in rare and 
exigent circumstances,” where “allow[ing] the matter to wend its 
way through the appellate process would not be in the public 
interest and would work upon the public irreparable harm.” Id. 
at 227, 580 P.2d at 53 (citing Sapienza v. Hayashi, 57 Haw. 289, 
554 P.2d 1131 (1976)). 
In Gannett, the court considered a petition for a writ 
of prohibition by representatives of the news media who sought 
to prohibit the respondent district judge from closing a 
preliminary hearing from the public. Id. at 226, 580 P.2d at 
52. The court held that exercise of the court’s supervisory 
jurisdiction and discretionary power was appropriate because the 
case presented a question “of grave import . . . involv[ing] not 
only the right of the accused to be tried by an impartial jury, 
but . . . also . . . the right of the public to attend and to be 
present at judicial proceedings.” Id. at 227, 580 P.2d at 53. 
The court noted: 
[B]ecause of the relative frequency with which 
preliminary hearings are being conducted in the 
district courts, thus enhancing the probability of 
collisions between established and fundamental 
rights, and because it appears to us only too clear 
that the district courts are in immediate need of 
direction from this court on a procedural and 
substantive matter of public importance, we deem it 
necessary to entertain the petition for writ of 
prohibition.  17 
   
          
           
          
        
        
            
             
       
          
           
           
 
  
             
         
            
            
         
          
         
            Id. (emphasis added); see also Moniz, 69 Haw. at 374, 742 P.2d 
at 376 (holding that “a classic example of when this court 
should exercise its supervisory power” is when the lower courts 
have differed in their interpretations of a statute). 
Similar but even more serious concerns were presented 
by the March 2020 and August 2020 petitions that were granted in 
part by this court. The premise of the relief granted was that 
ordinary mechanisms for determining individualized requests for 
release could not work quickly enough to meet the extraordinary 
circumstances that were presented (1) in the very early days of 
the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, and (2) when COVID cases 
“erupt[ed]”  at  OCCC   in  August  2020.   In  an  effort  to  prevent  
irreparable  harms  and  provide  direction  to  the  trial  courts,  the
court  invoked  its  supervisory  jurisdiction  and  discretionary  
power.   
Such  action,  though   rare,  is  far  from  unprecedented. 
In several cases,
 this court and the ICA have relied on HRS § 
602–5(a)(6) [previously HRS § 602–5(7)] to modify trial court 
judgments to prevent unfair results. In State v. Arlt, 9 Haw. 
App. 263, 277, 833 P.2d 902, 910 (1992), the ICA vacated a 
defendant’s conviction as to First Degree Robbery and remanded 
to the circuit court with instructions to enter a judgment 
convicting and resentencing the defendant for Theft in the 
Fourth Degree. The ICA stated that “[s]ince there is no statute  18 
    
     
         
          
          
           
           
          
          
             
          
         
         
         
         
          
          
         
         
          
                     
               
             
            
           
               
          
              
      
 or constitutional provision in Hawaii which specifically vests 
in the appellate courts the express authority to affirm, 
reverse, remand, vacate, or set aside any judgment, decree, or 
order of a court brought before them, such authority presumably 
derives from [HRS § 602-5(a)(6)].” Id. The ICA thus 
interpreted HRS § 602-5(6) to allow an appellate court to modify 
a trial court’s judgment of conviction if the interests of 
justice would be thereby promoted. Similarly, in Farmer v. 
Admin. Dir. of the Court, 94 Hawai‘i 232, 241, 11 P .3d 457, 466 
(2000), this court relied on its inherent powers under article 
VI, section 1 of the constitution and the statutory 
authorization under HRS § 602-5(6) in unanimously holding that 
“justice require[d]” that the defendant be given an opportunity 
to challenge the lifetime revocation of his driver’s license 
after one of the three predicate convictions on which his 
revocation was based was set aside, even though the district 
court’s rules specifically precluded such a remedy.11 
As noted by the concurrence, this court has not 
previously provided relief of the type provided in response to 
11 See also Hawaii Pub. Emp. Rels. Bd. v. Hawaii State Tchrs. Ass’n, 55 
Haw. 386, 520 P.2d 422 (1974) (reducing the fines imposed for civil contempt 
from $190,000 to $100,000 because, pursuant to HRS § 602-5(7) [presently HRS 
§ 602-5(a)(6)], “the promotion of justice would be better enhanced.”); CARL

      the March 2020 and August 2020 petitions.12 Thankfully, the 
court has never before been faced with circumstances such as the 
global COVID pandemic. The deadly implications of the pandemic 
— particularly in light of the overcrowding in our state’s 
correctional facilities — were largely unknown in March 2020. 
Moreover, the rapid spread of COVID in our prisons and jails in 
August 2020 presented an immediate threat that the virus would 
spread from the correctional system into our community, and 
strain already overtaxed health resources. 
These unknown and potentially catastrophic 
circumstances required a coordinated response from the 
judiciary. The work done by Special Master Foley on behalf of 
this court during the March 2020 petition was invaluable: he 
facilitated extensive discussion and problem-solving between the 
parties, and collected essential information for use by the 
court. That work was done at remarkable speed: his first 
report, with detailed submissions from the parties and others 
with relevant information, was submitted on April 9, 2020, only 
one week after he was appointed. This report, and the four that 
followed, provided the basis for prompt, informed, and 
12 However, this court’s cases recognize that courts can use their 
inherent powers to promote justice even when it implicates authority 
typically exercised by the executive branch. For example, Moriwake 
recognized that courts can dismiss cases with prejudice after two mistrials 
resulting from a hung jury, even though decisions about whether to initiate 
prosecutions are generally entrusted to the executive branch. 65 Haw. at 48, 
647 P.2d at 707.  20 
   
        
          
     
         
          
            
         
           
        
         
        
          
            
         
         
           
                     
           
             
                
               
               
             
     
 
            
           
            
            
         
           
           
             
             coordinated decision-making by this court. It simply would not 
have been feasible for individual trial courts to replicate that 
effort on a case-by-case basis.13 
These extraordinary circumstances justified the use of 
the court’s supervisory power to ensure that decisions about the 
release of inmates due to COVID concerns were made in a prompt, 
coordinated manner that minimized risks to inmates and the 
public as a whole, and promoted a fair and efficient judicial 
process. This court’s orders established presumptions, provided 
discretion to the trial judges where appropriate, and made 
system-wide determinations when necessary. The alternative — 
waiting for trial court decisions relating to the release of 
specific inmates to be appealed to this court — would have taken 
too long under the circumstances, with different trial courts 
taking different approaches in the meantime. That piecemeal 
approach would have increased the risk to our community.14 As 
13 Special Master Foley’s work also provided the background that 
enabled this court to act promptly when COVID “erupt[ed]” in our prisons and 
jails in August 2020. When the OPD filed its petition on August 12, 2020, it 
was reported that there were 23 positive cases in OCCC (16 inmates and 7 
staff), with the number rising to over 200 positive cases in just a few days. 
The court held a hearing within 48 hours, and issued its first order 
addressing the situation that evening. 
14 In addition to permitting delay, the narrow interpretation of this 
court’s powers advanced by the concurrence would have precluded action even 
where no reasonable dispute existed about the need for a prompt, uniform 
response. For example, information submitted to this court early in the 
March proceedings indicated that some prisoners were still serving 
“intermittent” sentences. See Order of Consolidation and for Appointment of 
Special Master, Office of the Public Defender v. Connors, SCPW-20-0000200 at

      the court has previously recognized, providing relief when delay 
will result in harm is a legitimate use of our supervisory 
power. See, e.g., Gannett, 59 Haw. at 226-27, 580 P.2d at 53 
(1978). And, as set forth below, other state supreme courts and 
chief justices came to the same conclusion and, likewise, 
identified categories of lower-risk offenders who could be 
released, if certain conditions were met, to alleviate 
overcrowding and reduce the risk of COVID spreading in 
correctional facilities and then into the community.15 
Inasmuch as the “inherent power of the court is . . . 
the power to provide process where none exists,” our grants of 
partial relief in the previous OPD petitions were appropriate 
under HRS §§ 602-4 and 602-5. Moriwake, 65 Haw. at 55, 647 P.2d 
at 712. The provision of such remedies was consistent with the 
purpose of our constitution and statutes to ensure a fair and 
efficient judicial process. 
out of correctional centers, which appear to directly contravene the intent 
of the current Department of Public Safety Policy of disallowing visits from 
those in the community in an effort to prevent the introduction of COVID-19 
into correctional centers.” The court directed that the custodial portion of 
such sentences be suspended until the conclusion of the pandemic, or deemed 
satisfied at the discretion of the sentencing judge. Id. at 5-6.

 This analysis is not affected by the fact that this 
court has rule-making authority under article VI, section 7 of 
the constitution. That provision provides that the “[t]he 
supreme court shall have power to promulgate rules and 
regulations in all civil and criminal cases for all courts 
relating to process, practice, procedure and appeals, which 
shall have the force and effect of law.” The court’s orders in 
the prior proceedings did not purport to be rules or 
regulations: the court did not invoke its rule-making power in 
adopting them, and none of the parties ever suggested that the 
orders should have been subject to the court’s rule-making 
process, or limited by the provisions of HRS § 602-11.16 
Moreover, nothing in the language of article VI, section 7 
suggests that it was intended to restrict this court’s inherent 
judicial powers, which, as noted above, are incorporated into 
the constitution via article VI, section 1 (“the judicial power 
of the State shall be vested in one supreme court . . .”), and 
codified in HRS § 602-5(a)(6). 
16 HRS § 602-11 provides, in part: 
The supreme court shall have power to promulgate 
rules in all civil and criminal cases for all courts 
relating to process, practices, procedure and 
appeals, which shall have the force and effect of 
law. Such rules shall not abridge, enlarge, or 
modify the substantive rights of any litigant, nor 
the jurisdiction of any of the courts, nor affect any 
statute of limitations.  23 
    
     
       
      
 
          
          
           
        
           
       
         
            
            
        
          
          
          
         
            
                     
             
              
             
           
            
 
 III. Other Jurisdictions’ Highest Courts Have Also Exercised 
Their Supervisory Powers to Provide Relief in 
Circumstances Similar to Those Here. 
The court’s actions on the March 2020 and August 2020 
petitions are supported by the response of other state supreme 
courts to the exigent circumstances caused by the pandemic. In 
Massachusetts, for example, the supreme judicial court ruled 
that in order to reduce the exposure of the virus in 
correctional facilities, COVID-19 shall constitute a “changed 
circumstance” under Massachusetts law.17 Comm. for Pub. Couns. 
Servs. v. Chief Just. of Trial Ct., 142 N.E.3d 525, 530, aff'd 
as modified, 143 N.E.3d 408 (Mass. 2020). To that end, the 
court concluded that with certain exclusions,18 defendants who 
were pending trial are “entitled to a rebuttable presumption of 
release. The individual shall be ordered released pending trial 
on his or her own recognizance, without surety, unless an 
unreasonable danger to the community would result, or the 
individual presents a very high risk of flight.” Id. 
17 The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts cited to two statutes. 
Mass. Gen. Laws. Ch. 276 § 57 outlines the factors to take into consideration 
for bail, and § 58 sets forth the court’s discretion to consider “changed 
circumstances or other factors not previously known” in issuing or revoking 
bail. Mass. Gen. Laws. Ch. 276 §§ 57 and 58. 
18   The  exclusions  were   defendants  who  were  being  held  without  bail  
under  Mass.  Gen.  Laws.  §  58(A),  or  who  were  charged  with  an  “excluded  offense 
(i.e.,  a  violent  or  serious  offense  enumerated  in  Appendix  A  to  this  
opinion).”    24 
  
       
              
         
        
          
          
       
         
        
            
         
           
        
          
            
          
     
       
         
           
            
       
                     
            
       In support of its actions, the Massachusetts court 
cited to the broad language in Mass. Gen. Laws. 211 § 3, which in 
relevant part, states that “[t]he supreme judicial court shall 
have general superintendence of all courts of inferior 
jurisdiction to correct and prevent errors therein if no other 
remedy is expressly provided[.]” Id. at 538. 
According to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, 
for “those individuals who are currently serving sentences of 
incarceration, absent a finding of a constitutional violation, 
our superintendence power is limited.” Id. at 530. The court 
therefore urged the Department of Corrections and the parole 
board to work with the special master to expedite hearings, and 
“to determine which individuals nearing completion of their 
sentences could be released on time served, and to identify 
other classes of inmates who might be able to be released by 
agreement of the parties, as well as expediting petitions for 
compassionate release.” Id. 
A significant number of incarcerated individuals were 
released as a result of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial 
Court’s decision. In fact, the number of inmates in various 
counties dropped, in some cases as high as 27 percent, just one 
month after the court’s ruling.19

             In a subsequent case, the Massachusetts Supreme 
Judicial Court also expanded the factors a judge is required to 
consider when evaluating a defendant’s motion to stay a sentence 
pending  an  appeal.    Commonwealth  v.  Nash,  159  N.E.3d  91,  99  
(Mass.  2020).   Prior  to  the  pandemic,  there  were  two  factors:  
(1)  the  defendant’s  likelihood  of  success  on  appeal;  and  (2)  
certain security factors.
 Id. In Christie v. Commonwealth, 142 
N.E.3d 55 (Mass. 2020), a third consideration, known as the 
COVID-19 factor, was included in the calculus. Id. at 59 (“In 
these extraordinary times, a judge deciding whether to grant a 
stay should consider not only the risk to others if the 
defendant were to be released and reoffend, but also the health 
risk to the defendant if the defendant were to remain in 
custody.”) (emphasis in original). The court in Nash reinforced 
the COVID-19 factor and emphasized the objective “to reduce 
temporarily the prison and jail populations, in a safe and 
responsible manner, through the judicious use of stays of 
executions of sentences pending appeal.”20 Nash, 159 N.E.3d at 
101-02.

        Other state supreme courts and chief justices have 
used their inherent and supervisory authority to grant relief to 
inmates due to the COVID pandemic. In South Carolina, for 
example, Chief Justice Donald W. Beatty issued a March 16, 2020, 
order requiring that “[a]ny person charged with a non-capital 
crime shall be ordered released pending trial on his own 
recognizance without surety, unless an unreasonable danger to 
the community will result or the accused is an extreme flight 
risk.”21 Chief Justice Beatty also required that in bond 
hearings, “[i]f a defendant has been in jail as a pre-trial 
detainee for the maximum possible sentence, the court shall 
convert the bond to a personal recognizance bond and release the 
defendant.”22 
In Maryland, Chief Judge Mary Ellen Barbera issued an 
order on April 14, 2020. Citing to the judiciary’s authority 
under the Maryland Constitution23 and the emergency powers 
ensure the safety of court personnel, litigants, and the public” and issued 
an order that provided “a uniform, coordinated response from Washington 
courts to prevent further outbreak and to maintain consistent and equitable 
access to justice[.]” In the Matter of Statewide Response By Washington 
State Courts to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, Amended Order No.

Supreme%20Court%20Orders/Supreme%20Court%20Emergency%20Order%20re%20CV19%2003

may constitute a “material change in circumstances” as a factor for judges to 
consider in motions for pre-trial release. Id.

 granted  by  the  Maryland  Rules  of  Practice  and  Procedure,   Chief 
Judge  Barbera  required  judges  to  consider  a  variety  of  factors  24
in  determining  whether  to  release  adult  defendants  from  pretrial 
detention,  including,  inter  alia,  whether  the  defendant  suffers  
from  pre-existing  conditions  that  render  the  defendant  more  
vulnerable  to  COVID-19  or  whether  the  release  of  the  defendant  
during the pandemic is in
 the interest of justice.25 
Furthermore, Chief Judge Barbera also ordered that “judges 
should consider the risk that COVID-19 poses to people confined 
in correctional facilities when taking into account all 
statutory requirements and relevant Maryland Rules in 
determining release conditions and the status of defendants 
pending sentencing and appeal[.]”26 
Similar to some of this court’s orders, the Kentucky 
Supreme Court ordered the emergency administrative release of 
any defendant charged with a non-sexual/non-violent misdemeanor

 activity.27 Those charged with a non-sexual/non-violent Class D 
felony were also eligible for release.28 As a result, according 
to Kentucky’s Administrative Office of the Courts, more than 
35,000 inmates were released since the start of the pandemic 
either from a judge’s order or on administrative release up 
through October 3, 2020.29 While the Governor of Kentucky also 
ordered additional releases utilizing his executive power under 
27 Kentucky 2020-27 Order at 2. 
In its 2020-27 Order, the Kentucky Supreme Court did not cite its 
statutory or constitutional authority. Justice Eddins’ concurrence refers to 
Kentucky’s 2020-45 Amended Order in which the Kentucky Supreme Court 
referenced Section 116 of the Kentucky Constitution and its own Supreme Court 
Rule 1.010 as authority to issue its order. In Re: Kentucky Court of Justice 
Response to COVID-19 Emergency: Amended Release Schedule and Pretrial Drug 
Testing Standards, 2020-45 (May 29, 2020), https://kycourts.gov/Courts / 
Supreme-Court/Supreme%20Court%20Orders/202045.pdf. 
According to Section 116, “The Supreme Court shall have the power to 
prescribe rules governing its appellate jurisdiction, rules for appointment 
of commissioners and other court personnel, and rules of practice and 
procedure for the Court of Justice. The Supreme Court shall, by rule, govern 
admission to the bar and the discipline of members of the bar.” Ky. Const., 
section 116. 
In Rule 1.010, “The policy-making and administrative authority of the 
Court of Justice is vested in the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice. All 
fiscal management, personnel actions and policies, development and 
distribution of statistical information, and pretrial release services come 
with that authority.” Ky. R. Sup. Ct. 1.010. 
Both authorities cited by the Kentucky Supreme Court align with this 
court’s own constitutional mandates. See Haw. Const. Art. VI, sections 6 and 
7. Like Kentucky, our court “shall have power to promulgate rules and 
regulations” and the chief justice “shall be the administrative head of the 
courts.” Haw. Const. Art. VI, sections 6 and 7.

sentences of specific incarcerated individuals based on the 
recommendations by the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet.31 The 
Kentucky Supreme Court, however, utilized its supervisory powers 
to order the lower courts to follow the broad emergency 
administrative release schedule to “further protect the health 
and safety of our criminal justice partners--peace officers, 
county jails, and pretrial drug testing providers--and to 
protect the health and safety of all pretrial defendants and any 
defendants housed in county jails[.]” 2020-27 Order at 1. 
IV. Conclusion 
This court has the authority to grant the relief that 
was ordered in the March 2020 and August 2020 petitions, 
pursuant to explicit and inherent authority under the 
constitution and state statutes. While this court uses that 
power with restraint, the circumstances that existed when the

therefor a statement of the reasons for his decision thereon, which 
application and statement shall always be open to public inspection.” Ky.
