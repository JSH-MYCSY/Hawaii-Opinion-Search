Dkt. 6 ODDPpetitioner’s motion for summary judgment, which is the subject of
the petition.  The relief that petitioner seeks in the petition
has been addressed by the circuit court’s order and, thus, the
requested extraordinary writ is not necessary.  See Kema v.
Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue
unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right
to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately
the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action).  Accordingly, 
It is ordered that the petition for writ of mandamus is
denied.
