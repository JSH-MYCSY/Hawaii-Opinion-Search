ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 1CC051000863) 
 
ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE PETITION FOR 
WRIT OF PROHIBITION AND WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
 
  Upon consideration of petitioner Civil Beat Law Center 
for the Public Interest’s petition for writ of prohibition and 
writ of mandamus, the respondent judge’s answer to the petition, 
petitioner’s response, the respondent judge’s reply, the amicus 
brief, and the record, it appears that the requested 
extraordinary writ is not warranted at this juncture.  See 
Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 580 P.2d 
58, 62 (1978) (a writ of prohibition “is an extraordinary remedy . . . to restrain a judge of an inferior court from acting Electronically Filed

 beyond or in excess of his jurisdiction.”); Kema v. Gaddis, 91 
Hawai‘i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of 
mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless 
the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to 
relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the
alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; such a writ is 
meant to restrain a judge of an inferior court who has exceeded 
his or her jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest 
abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly
before the court under circumstances in which he or she has a 
legal duty to act).    
 
  Petitioner initially sought a writ of prohibition and 
writ of mandamus related to the inability to publicly access the 
case file in Case No. 1CC051000863.  On April 11, 2022, the 
respondent judge entered an “Order Removing Security Designation 
for Civil No. 05-1-0863-05.”  Redacted copies of documents filed 
in Civil No. 05-1-0863-05 are now accessible by the public, 
including petitioner.    
  Petitioner has subsequently modified its request for relief before this court, in part, to request that the 
respondent judge be prohibited from enforcing an order sealing 
the complaint  and defendants’ names in Civil No. 05-1-0863-05,
1  
                                                           
1  Petitioner also notes that the case docket indicates that the circuit 
court no longer has the underlying complaint based on an order that was 3 
 and enforcing a gag order entered against petitioner.  
Petitioner specifically asserts that the respondent judge has 
failed to comply with the procedural and substantive standards 
for keeping the complaint sealed.  The respondent judge does not 
dispute that the actions taken in 2005 did not conform with O‘ ahu 
Publ’ns Inc. v. Ahn, 133 
Hawai‘i 482, 331 P.3d 460 (2014) and 
Grube v. Trader, 142 Hawai‘ i 412, 420 P.3d 343 (2018), but 
explains, in reply to petitioner’s response, the factors he 
considered and the discretionary balancing he undertook in giving paramount protection to the plaintiff’s constitutional 
right to privacy against a third party’s qualified right of 
access to court records in a civil case.  The respondent judge 
also clarified that his order does not preclude petitioner from 
seeking access to court records or publishing any motions or 
related documents and orders as long as the publication does not 
disclose the name and identify of any of the parties in the 
instant case.  These averments and rationale, however, are not 
provided in any written findings in the underlying case.   
    At this time, given the developments in this matter 
and petitioner’s recently modified request for relief, the more 
appropriate course of action is for petitioner to seek relief, 
                                                           
issued in 2005, which ordered the complaint be expunged and returned to 
plaintiff’s counsel.  This court notes that such an expungement and purging 
of a court document is not general practice. 4 
 as modified, in the underlying case, and for the respondent 
judge, after all parties are heard on the matter, to thereafter 
enter formal written findings consistent with constitutional 
standards and case law, specifically Ahn and Grube.    
  Accordingly,    It is ordered that the petition for writ of 
prohibition and writ of mandamus is denied without prejudice 
consistent with this order.
