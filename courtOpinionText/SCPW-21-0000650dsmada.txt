(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.)
On November 12, 2021, petitioner John Penitani
submitted a letter document seeking relief from this court
related to his federal court matter arising in the United States
District Court for the District of Hawai#i.  The document was
filed as a petition.  Upon consideration of the submission and
the record, this court lacks jurisdiction to provide petitioner
the requested relief.  See HRS ยง 602-5(a).  Accordingly,
It is ordered that the petition is dismissed.
It is further ordered that the clerk of the appellate
court shall process the petition without payment of the filing
fees.
