ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
ORDER DENYING PETITIONS FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.)
Upon consideration of petitioner Janis B. Griffin’s
petitions for writ of mandamus, and the attached supporting
documents, petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and
indisputable right to relief from this court and has alternative
means to seek relief, including seeking relief as directed by the
family court.  At this juncture, petitioner presents no basis for
this court’s intervention through the issuance of an
extraordinary writ.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204-05,
982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an
extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitionerElectronically Filed

Dkt. 10 ODDPdemonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack
of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
obtain the requested action; such a writ is meant to restrain a
judge of an inferior court who has exceeded his or her
jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of
discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before
the court under circumstances in which he or she has a legal duty
to act).  Accordingly,
It is ordered that the petitions for writ of mandamus
are denied.
