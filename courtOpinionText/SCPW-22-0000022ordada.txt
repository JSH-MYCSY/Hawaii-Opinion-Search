IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
RICHARD RAPOZO, Petitioner 
vs. 
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of petitioner Richard Rapozo’s 
petition for writ of habeas corpus, filed on January 24, 2022, 
petitioner has alternative means to seek relief and presents no special reason for invoking the supreme court’s original jurisdiction.  See Oili v. Chang, 57 Haw. 511, 512, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976).  Therefore, 
It is ordered that the petition for writ of habeas 
corpus is denied.  
It is further ordered that the clerk of the appellate 
court shall process the petition for writ of habeas corpus without payment of the filing fee. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i
, February 4, 2022.
