SCPW-22-0000053 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I 
IN RE ERNEST HOLMES, JR., Petitioner. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By:  Recktenwald,  C.J.,  Nakayama,  McKenna,  Wilson,  and  Eddins,  JJ.) 
Upon consideration of petitioner Ernest Holmes, Jr.’s 
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on February 14, 2022, 
petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief from this court and has alternative means to seek relief. See
 HRS § 846E-10 (setting forth the requirements for termination 
of registration of sex offenders and other covered offenders) and HRS § 560:5-106(2) (the family court has “exclusive jurisdiction over guardianships and related proceedings concerning minors”). Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to the requested extraordinary writ. See Kema v. Gaddis
, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204, 982 
P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the 
requested action). Accordingly, 
It is ordered that the petition for writ of mandamus is 
denied. 
It is further ordered that the clerk of the appellate 
court shall process the petition for writ of mandamus without payment of the filing fee. 
DATED: Honolulu,  Hawai#i, February 24, 2022.
