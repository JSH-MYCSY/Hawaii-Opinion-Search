 reapportionment, the process through which the state’s 
legislators are distributed and its political districts redrawn.
 
It provides that every ten years a nine-member 
reapportionment commission (the commission) shall determine the 
total number of state representatives to which each basic island 
unit2 is entitled.  Haw. Const. art. IV, §§ 1, 2 & 4.  This 
determination is made “using the total number of permanent residents in each of the basic island units” and with the “method of equal proportions.”  Id. 
Once the commission determines how many representatives 
each basic island unit is entitled to, it must apportion those 
representatives within the basic island units.  Id. at § 6.  If 
there have been population shifts in the decade since the last reapportionment, the commission must redraw district lines to 
ensure that the “number of permanent residents per member in 
each district is as nearly equal to the average for the basic 
island unit as practicable.”  Id.   
The commission is also tasked with redrawing congressional 
district lines.  Id. at § 9. 
Article IV, section 6 provides eight criteria that the 
commission “shall be guided by” in effecting redistricting.  The 
                                                 
2  The four basic island units are: (1) the island of Hawaiʻ i, (2) the 
islands of Maui, Lā naʻi, Molokaʻ i and Kahoʻ olawe , (3) the island of Oʻ ahu and 
all other islands not specifically enumerated, and (4) the islands of Kauaʻ i 
and Niʻihau.  Haw. Const. art. IV, § 4. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 sixth is that: “[w]here practicable, [state] representative 
districts shall be wholly included within [state] senatorial 
districts”  (the constitutional district within district 
guideline).  Id. at § 6. 
 Hawai i Revised Statutes (HRS) Section
 
25-2(b)(5) (Supp. 2021) (the statutory district within district 
guideline) similarly requires that “[w]here practicable, state 
legislative [representative and senatorial] districts shall be 
wholly included within [U.S.] congressional districts.”  ʻ
On January 28, 2022, the 2021 Hawaiʻ i Reapportionment 
Commission (the Commission) approved the 2021 Final Legislative 
Reapportionment Plan (the Plan). 
The Plan places 33 of 51 house districts (64.7%) into two 
or more senate districts.  It also places four O‘ ahu house 
districts and five O‘ ahu senate districts into both U.S. 
congressional districts. 
Petitioners, who are registered voters in the State of 
Hawai‘i, argue that the Plan is invalid because it does not give 
adequate effect to article I, section 6’s guidance that “[w]here 
practicable, representative districts shall be wholly included 
within senatorial districts.”  See Haw. Const. art. IV, § 6.    
They also argue that the Plan violates HRS § 25-2(b)(5) by 
placing nine O‘ ahu legislative districts into both congressional *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
4 districts.3  Petitioners say they submitted two plans to the 
Commission that not only complied with the district within 
district guidelines, but also had a lower average per-district 
population deviation than the Plan.  Petitioners say the 
Commission could have complied with article IV, section 6 and 
HRS § 25-2(b)(5), it just didn’t want to.  Petitioners also 
argue that less than perfect compliance with one of the district 
within district guidelines may only be justified by the need to 
comply with the other constitutional and statutory guidelines 
that govern reapportionment. 
The Commission says it satisfied its obligations under 
article IV, section 6 and HRS § 25-2(b) by considering the 
constitutional and statutory district within district guidelines 
(collectively the district within district guidelines) in 
developing the Plan.  It says Petitioners have not demonstrated 
that the Commission abused its discretion in discharging its 
duties and adopting the Plan. 
3Petitioners also make a third argument.  They claim the Commission 
unconstitutionally delegated much of its redistricting work and decision 
making to a committee that consisted of just four of the Commission’s nine 
members.  This argument lacks merit.  The record shows that the Plan was 
considered by all nine members of the bipartisan Commission and that all nine 
members of the Commission participated in the vote regarding the adoption of 
the Plan (eight commissioners voted to adopt the Plan and one voted not to).    
The establishment of the technical committee did not represent an 
unconstitutional delegation of the Commission’s power.  To the extent 
Petitioners raise claims under the Sunshine Law, they are not entitled to 
mandamus relief because those claims could have been brought in circuit court 
under HRS § 92-12(c)(2012). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 We agree.  The constitution and HRS § 25-2(b) mandate that, 
in redistricting, the commission “shall be guided” by certain 
enumerated criteria, among them the district within district 
guidelines.  The commission is not required to give the district 
within district guidelines any particular effect.  Nor is it 
required to disregard factors other than the criteria enumerated 
in article IV, section 6 or HRS § 25-2(b) in redrawing district 
lines.  So the Commission discharged its obligations under 
article IV, section 6 and HRS § 25-2(b) by considering the 
district within district guidelines alongside other policy 
objectives.  And, by extension, the Plan is valid. 
I. BACKGROUND 
At its May 17, 2021 meeting, the Commission formed a 
“technical” committee consisting of four commissioners.  The 
Commission tasked the technical committee with drafting proposed 
reapportionment plans for the Commission’s consideration. 
The technical committee presented its proposed 
reapportionment plans to the Commission at the Commission’s January 13, 2022 meeting.
4 
At that same meeting, there was public testimony demanding 
that the Commission explain its failure to better effectuate the 
                                                 
4  The technical committee had previously presented other reapportionment 
plans to the Commission.  But these earlier plans had to be amended as a 
result of updated data received from the military in December 2021 that 
impacted the Commission’s assessment of the number of permanent versus 
nonpermanent residents in the state. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 district within district guidelines.
 
Responding to this public testimony, Commissioner Nonaka 
explained that because of the incongruity between the population 
bases used in congressional districts and those used in state 
legislative districts, it was not possible, let alone 
practicable, to have all state districts wholly within a 
congressional district.  
Later at the same meeting, Commission Chair Mugiishi 
stressed that the Commission was holistically evaluating the constitutional and statutory requirements governing 
reapportionment and trying to balance them in a way that 
responded to community concerns.  He explained: 
[W]e are as a Commission considering all of those statutory 
requirements and constitutional requirements that that 
[sic] is asked of us and we are doing our best to make sure 
to the extent that it’ s practicable that we are following 
them.  But sometimes they’ re in conflict with each other 
and that’s where that’ s why we have a commission rather 
than a computer program drawing these lines.  It’s because 
human beings who are going to care about people and 
individual neighborhoods, are going to make judgment calls on what’ s the best way to make a practical decision about a 
conflict between two principles.  And that’ s why I think 
again, and I’ve said it about four times already, but I 
really do appreciate the work of the technical committee 
because they’ ve been doing this now for weeks, months, and 
for the last few days every single hour of the day to try 
and consider all of those factors.  Because we’ re going to 
affect people and that’ s so we’ re going to follow the 
constitution, we’ re going to follow the law and we’ re going 
to do our best to take care of people. 
 
The Commission also met on January 20, 21, 22, and 26, 
2022. 
At the Commission’s January 20, 2022 meeting, Chair 
Muguiishi read the article IV, section 6 guidelines aloud and *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
7 
 explained that “after due consideration the members of the 
technical committee 
believed that the modified proposed plans 
represent what they the technical committee deemed to be the best, best complies with the constitutional guidelines.”  
Commissioners Ono, Nonaka, and Nekota agreed with the Chair’s 
assessment.  Commissioner Nekota added “We really did take 
public testimony to heart.  We did not just go draw lines to 
draw lines.  We really did and follow the Constitution, as we perceive it to be, along with our legal counsel.” 
During the January 26, 2022 meeting, the technical 
committee presented and discussed a new version of its proposed 
final legislative reapportionment plans; the only change it had 
made to the proposed maps since January 13, 2022, was to the 
boundaries of House Districts 48 and 49 on O‘ ahu. 
At the January 28, 2022 Commission meeting, the Commission 
discussed, and then voted to approve, the January 26, 2022 
version of the legislative reapportionment plans.  In explaining 
his support for the motion to approve the Plan, Commissioner 
Chun pointed to the Commission’s commitment to ensuring that its redistricting decisions were made in the context of the article 
IV, section 6 guidelines:  
The constitution states that in effecting such 
redistricting, the commission shall be guided by the 
following criteria.  It sets forth guidance rather than 
inflexible standards so as to ensure reasonableness and fairness are always a part of the equation in arriving at 
redistricting determinations.  I have observed complete *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
8 objectivity and clear commitment to ensuring that good 
decisions were made in the context of these guidelines and 
as they were applied to the redistricting maps, so I will 
be pleased today to support the motion [to adopt the Plan]. 
Shortly after adopting the final reapportionment plan, the 
Commission authorized staff to make non-substantive changes, 
including changes to better align the representative district, Senate district, and council district lines.  
The staff made 
changes to the Plan so that it would better adhere to the constitutional district within district guideline; following 
these changes, there are thirty-three (33) House districts that 
are not wholly inside Senate districts. 
Petitioners challenge the Plan on the grounds that it 
violates article IV, section 6 and HRS § 25-2(b)(5) by failing to place districts within districts even where it would have 
been practicable to do so.  They argue the Commission erred by 
adopting a Plan that fell short of perfect adherence to the 
district within district guidelines without justifying the 
Plan’s noncompliance in terms of the need to comply with the 
other reapportionment “requirements” enumerated in article IV, 
section 6 and HRS § 25-2(b). 
II. DISCUSSION
We hold that neither article IV, section 6 nor HRS § 25-
2(b)(5) places concrete limits on the Commission’s discretion to 
craft a reapportionment plan.  The Commission must consider the 
district within district guidelines when redrawing district *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
9 lines.  But it is not required to give them any particular 
effect in redistricting. 
The existence of alternative plans that hew closer to the 
district within district guidelines is immaterial to our 
analysis.  Our task is not to consider the Plan’s relative 
merits in comparison to other options the Commission could have, 
but did not, adopt.  We consider only whether the Plan is 
constitutional under article IV, section 6 and legal under HRS 
§ 25-2(b)(5).  See McNeil v. Legis. Apportionment Comm’n of
N.J., 828 A.2d 840, 858 (N.J. 2003) (“The judiciary is not
justified in striking down a plan, otherwise valid, because a
‘better’ one, in its opinion, could be drawn.” (Cleaned up.)).
Petitioners have not shown that the Commission abused its 
discretion by disregarding or ignoring the district within 
district guidelines.  To the contrary, the record suggests that 
the Commission was aware of, discussed, and considered the 
district within district guidelines in redrawing district lines 
and adopting the Plan.  So even though we agree with Petitioners 
that the Plan does not give full effect to the constitutional 
district within district guideline,5 we hold that the Commission 
5Petitioners’ argument that the Plan does not give substantial effect to 
the statutory district within district requirement is less convincing than 
its arguments concerning the constitutional district within district 
guideline: the Plan places 88 percent of state house and senate districts 
wholly within a single congressional district.
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
10 did not abuse its discretion in developing and adopting the 
Plan. 
1. Standards of Review
a. We answer questions of constitutional law de novo
“Issues of constitutional interpretation present questions
of law that are reviewed de novo.”  League of Women Voters of 
Honolulu v. State, 150 Hawai‘ i 182, 189, 499 P.3d 382, 389 (2021) 
(cleaned up).  This court is the “ultimate judicial tribunal 
with final, unreviewable authority to interpret and enforce the 
Hawai‘i Constitution.”  See Ka Pa‘ akai O Ka ‘ Aina v. Land Use 
Comm’n, 94 Hawai‘ i 31, 41, 7 P.3d 1068, 1078 (2000) (cleaned up).  
“We answer questions of constitutional law by exercising our own 
independent constitutional judgment based on the facts of the 
case.”  State v. Hanapi, 89 Hawai‘ i 177, 182, 970 P.2d 485, 490 
(1998) (cleaned up).  Here, this means we give no deference to 
the constitutional interpretations the Commission implicitly 
operationalized in developing the Plan. 
b. We review the Commission’s exercise of its discretion
using the abuse of discretion standard 
We review the discretionary decisions of public bodies 
using the abuse of discretion standard.  See Kawamoto v. Okata, 
75 Haw. 463, 467, 868 P.2d 1183, 1186 (1994).  In the context of 
this case, this means we will not substitute our judgment for 
that of the Commission with respect to the Commission’s exercise*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
11 of discretion given to it by the  Constitution.  Instead, 
our determination of whether the Commission has complied with 
article IV, section 6 and HRS § 25-2(b) and other applicable laws will hinge on whether the record demonstrates that the 
Commission either did not consider criteria it was required to 
consider or, having considered all relevant criteria, made a 
decision that disregarded the law or exceeded the bounds of 
reason.Hawai‘i

2. Reapportionment commissions must consider the district
within district guidelines when redrawing districts
Both the constitution and HRS § 25-2(b) frame the district
within district guidelines as discretionary, describing them as 
“criteria” that the commission “shall be guided by” in effecting 
redistricting.  See article IV, section 6; HRS § 25-2(b). 
In Save Sunset Beach Coal. v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 102 
Hawai‘i 465, 479, 78 P.3d 1, 15 (2003), we considered whether 
Honolulu’s city council erred in zoning land as “country” where 
6This approach is consistent with that used by other courts reviewing 
the discretionary acts of state reapportionment commissions.  See, e.g.,  
Hartung v. Bradbury, 33 P.3d 972, 981 (Or. 2001) (e n banc) (considering 
constitutional challenges to reapportionment plan and explaining that it 
would void the plan only if it could “say from the record that the Secretary 
of State [the reapportioning body] either did not consider one or more 
criteria or, having considered them all, made a choice or choices that no 
reasonable Secretary of State would have made”); Jamerson v. Womack, 423 
S.E.2d 180, 182 (Va. 1992) (“In this particular litigation, it should be remembered that reapportionment is, in a sense, political, and necessarily 
wide discretion is given to the legislative body.  An abuse of that 
discretion is shown only by a grave, palpable and unreasonable deviation from 
the principles fixed by the Constitution.”  (Cleaned up.)). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
12 only two of the four statutory guidelines provided for 
identifying potential “country” district lands were met.  We 
concluded that while the “‘use’ or consideration” of the 
statutory guidelines was mandatory, “the ultimate designation 
decision arising out of that mandatory consideration must, of 
necessity, involve the exercise of discretion.”  Id.  We 
explained that “guidelines,” as used in the statute, “denote[d] 
individual factors that are not mandatory in themselves, but instead provide direction or guidance with respect to the 
ultimate decision.”  Id. 
A similar analysis informs our interpretation of “guided 
by” as used in article IV, section 6 and HRS § 25-2(b): the 
reapportionment commission must consider the district within 
district guidelines and it must use them in developing and 
adopting congressional and legislative plans.  But the 
guidelines are not mandatory “in themselves”; rather, they 
provide “direction or guidance with respect to the ultimate 
decision.”  See id. 
The history of article IV, section 6 reflects that the 
constitutional district within district requirement was not 
intended to curb the reapportionment commission’s discretion to 
redraw district lines.  After noting that it placed “a number of 
guidelines for the reapportionment commission to follow when 
redistricting” into article IV, section 6, the Committee on *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
13 Legislative Apportionment and Districting clarified: 
It is not intended that these guidelines b e absolute 
restrictions upon the commission excepting for numbers 1, 
2, 3 and 7 which are stated in mandatory terms.  The 
remainder [including the district within district 
guideline] are standards which are not intended to b e 
ranked in any particular order.  Rather, your Committee 
believes that they are matters that should b e considered in 
any decision concerning districting and that the balance to 
be struck among them is a matter for case- by-case 
determination.  The inclusion of these guidelines is 
intended to aid the reapportionment commission in 
maintaining impartiality and objectivity in its own 
reapportionme nt plan and to provide the courts with a 
standard for review of claims of gerrymandering or other 
unfair or partial result in the apportionment plan.  
Supp. Stand. Comm. Report No. 58, in 1 Proceedings of the 
Constitutional Convention of Hawai‘ i of 1968, at 265 (1973) 
(emphases added).  Elsewhere in the same report, the Committee 
observed that the reapportionment plan it proposed substantially 
complied with the district within district guideline; but, it 
remarked, it adopted that criterion “in a more general, less 
restrictive manner for future reapportionment.”  Id. at 247. 
Two aspects of this committee report support our conclusion 
that the constitutional district within district guideline is a 
factor the commission must consider, not a requirement it must 
meet. 
First, the committee report describes the guideline as a 
criterion “that should be considered” and recognizes that the 
extent to which it will be followed in any given reapportionment 
year is a “matter for case-by-case determination.”  Id. at 265.  
It says it adopted the guideline in a “more general” and “less *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
14 restrictive manner for future reapportionment.”  Id. at 247.  
Collectively, this language indicates that while the commission 
must “be guided by” and consider the guideline, the decision to 
give it effect, or not, remains discretionary. 
Second, the report indicates that, in the context of 
judicial review of reapportionment plans, the purpose of the 
district within district guideline is “to provide the courts 
with a standard for review of claims of gerrymandering or other 
unfair or partial result in the apportionment plan.”  Id. at 
265. This language affirms that the district within district
guideline is not an inflexible requirement that the
reapportionment commission can fall short of by adopting a plan
with too many house districts that span senate district lines.
It suggests that the constitutional district within district
guideline is, rather, a general guideline or a best practice.
This is not to say that the effect the reapportionment 
commission gives to the district within district guideline will 
always be immaterial to the question of a reapportionment plan’s 
constitutionality.  A reapportionment commission’s failure to 
give full effect to the district within district guideline would 
be appropriately considered in the context of a claim that a 
reapportionment plan was unconstitutionally gerrymandered, 
biased, or otherwise contrary to the equal protection principles 
that animate article IV, section 6 and article I, section 5.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
15 For example, the fact that a reapportionment commission placed 
nearly two thirds of house districts into two or more senate 
districts could, if presented alongside other credible evidence 
of bias, lend substantial support to a claim that a 
reapportionment plan was unconstitutionally partial to a 
particular person or party.  But this does not mean that failure 
to substantially comply with the district within district 
guideline is, standing alone, a constitutional violation.7 
Based on the plain language of article IV, section 6 and 
the framers’ intent as revealed by legislative history, we 
conclude that reapportionment commissions do not have a 
constitutional obligation to give the district within district 
guideline any particular effect.  They may not disregard or 
ignore the district within district guidelines (or the other 
reapportionment guidelines that are to be followed where 
“practicable” or “possible”).  They must consider them when 
redistricting and should, where practicable, endeavor to 
7Justice McKenna’s dissent highlights the constitutional district within 
district guideline’s role
 in “facilitating political organization and 
developing accountability of senators to communities of common interest.”  
Dissent at 12. 
We do not dispute the wisdom of the guideline from a policy 
perspective.  But the question of whether compliance with the district within 
district guideline is “normal and preferable,” see dissent at 11 (quoting 
Ethan Weiss, Partisan Gerrymandering and the Elusive Standard, 53 Santa Clara 
L.Rev. 693, 697 (2013)), is not before us.  And the contention that, from apolicy perspective, a reapportionment plan that gives full effect to thedistrict within district guideline would be better than one that doesn’ t
cannot curtail the reapportionment commission’s ability to exercise
discretion granted to it by the constitution.*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
16 effectuate them.  But they have no rigid statutory or 
constitutional obligation to effectuate them.  Put plainly, the 
guidelines must shape the reapportionment commission’s exercise 
of its discretion, but they do not impose any hard limits on 
it., 89
Petitioners’ contention that the Commission must “justify” 
the level of consideration it gave, or did not give, to the 
district within district guidelines reflects a misunderstanding 
about both the scope of the Commission’s discretion to develop 
and adopt reapportionment plans and this court’s role in 
reviewing the constitutionality of reapportionment plans.  Burns 
v. Richardson, 384 U.S. 73 (1966), is instructive.
In Burns, the Supreme Court considered the 
constitutionality of an interim Hawai‘ i state senate 
8This analysis concerns the non- mandatory guidelines of article IV, 
section 6 and HRS § 25
-2(b) only.  The reapportionment commission must give 
full effect to those constitutional and statutory requirements that are not 
modified by “where practicable” or “where possible,” for example article IV, 
section 6’s requirement that “[n]ot more than four members shall be elected 
from any district.”  
9  We note that the constitutional district within district guideline is 
not a general principle bereft of legal force absent implementing laws or 
statutes.  It is, rather, self-executing in that it “supplies a sufficient 
rule by means of which . . . the duty imposed may be enforced.”  See Morita 
v. Gorak, 145 Hawai‘ i 385, 392, 453 P.3d 205, 212 (2019)  (cleaned up).   The
constitution imposes a duty on reapportionment commissions to “be guided” by
the criterion that, “[w]here practicable, representative districts shall be
wholly included within senatorial districts.”  Haw. Const. art. IV, § 6 .  It
also provides the means for the enforcement of that duty.  See Haw. Const.
art. IV, § 10 (“Original jurisdiction is vested in the supreme court of the
State to be exercised on the petition of any registered voter whereby it may
compel, by mandamus or otherwise, the appropriate person or persons to
perform their duty or to correct any error made in a reapportionment
plan . . . .”).17 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
apportionment plan.  A three-judge panel of the United States 
District Court for the District of  Hawai ‘i
 had disapproved of the 
interim plan on the grounds that instead of accounting for 
population increases on O‘ahu by creating new single-member 
senatorial districts for the island, the plan merely increased 
the number of multi-member senatorial districts on Oʻahu from two 
to five.  Id. at 82.  The district court had concerns about 
“what it considered to be a difference in representational 
effectiveness between multi-member and single-members 
legislative districts.”  Id. at 86.  The Supreme Court overruled 
the district court, explaining that absent evidence of an Equal 
Protection Clause violation, the district court was wrong to 
second-guess the legislature’s exercise of its discretion to 
redistrict.   The Court said that given the absence of a showing 
that the interim reapportionment plan raised equal protection 
concerns, the district court should not have even required the 
legislature to justify its reliance on multi-member legislative 
districts: 10
10The Court explained: 
In relying on conjecture as to the effects of multi- member 
districting rather than demonstrated fact, the court acted 
in a manner more appropriate to the body responsible for 
drawing up the districting plan.  Speculations do not 
supply evidence that the multi- member districting was 
designed to have or had the invidious effect necessary to a 
judgment of the unconstitutionality of the districting. 
Burns, 384 U.S. at 88- 89.*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
18 
 Indeed, while it would have been better had the court not 
insisted that the legislature ‘justify’ its proposal, 
except insofar as it thus reserved to itself the ultimate 
decision of constitutionality vel non, the legislature did 
assign reasons for its choice.  Once the District Court had 
decided, properly, not to impose its own senate 
apportionment but to allow the legislature to frame one, 
such judgments were exclusively for the legislature to 
make.  They were subject to constitutional challenge only 
upon a demonstration that the interim apportionment, 
although made on a proper population basis, was designed to 
or would operate to minimize or cancel out the voting 
strength of racial or political elements of the voting 
population.

have intervened, and will continue to intervene, when necessary 
to ensure that Hawai‘ i’s reapportionment commission creates 
reapportionment plans that comply with the Equal Protection 
Clause, the four mandatory requirements in article IV, section 
6, and all other constitutional and statutory mandates 
concerning redistricting.  Cf. Solomon v. Abercrombie, 126

plan was invalid under article IV, section 4 of our constitution 
because it included non-permanent residents in the population 
base for reapportionment).  But as Burns makes clear, absent a 
showing that a reapportionment plan is unconstitutional or 
illegal we should not second-guess the reapportionment *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
19 commission’s exercise of its discretion to redistrict.  Cf. 
Supp. Stand. Comm. Report No. 58, in 1 Proceedings of the 
Constitutional Convention of Hawai‘ i of 1968, at 266 (1973) 
(“Judicial review is provided in the form of a mandamus to 
require the commission to do its work, correct any error or 
effectuate the purposes of the reapportionment provisions 
contained in the Constitution.”) 
3. The Commission did not abuse its discretion in developing
the Plan 
Our constitution requires that the reapportionment
commission consider the district within district guidelines.  
See supra section II(2).  But it does not dictate what that 
consideration should look like.  Decisions about when and how 
the guidelines ought to be considered are left to the discretion 
of the reapportionment commission.  
The record in this case shows that the Commission did not 
abuse that discretion: it adequately considered the 
constitutional district within district guideline in developing 
and approving the Plan. 
Chair Mugiishi’s statements at the January 13, 2022 meeting 
concerning the Commission’s commitment to “consider[ing] all of 
those factors,” “follow[ing] the constitution,” and doing its 
best to “take care of people” speaks to the fact that the 
constitutional district within district guideline was one of the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
20 factors the Commission considered in exercising its discretion.
As does Commissioner Chun’s remark at the January 28, 2022 
meeting that he had “observed complete objectivity and clear 
commitment to ensuring that good decisions were made in the 
context of these guidelines and as they were applied to the 
redistricting maps.”  
The Commission’s consideration of the constitutional 
district within district guideline is also evidenced by the fact 
that after the January 28, 2022 approval of the Plan, Commission 
staff made minor changes to the Plan in order to improve its 
compliance with the constitutional district within district 
guideline.  If the Commission was indifferent to the guideline 
it would not have tweaked the Plan to better comply with it. 
Finally, declarations provided by members of the 
Commission’s technical committee speak to the Commission’s 
consideration of the district within district guidelines.  
Commissioner Nonaka declared that: 
the Technical Committee was guided by the applicable 
constitutional and statutory provisions, including the 
eight (8) criteria listed in Article IV, Section 6 of the 
Hawai‘i Constitution.  We considered the criteria to comply 
with the Constitution while striving to produce plans that 
would best serve the State as a whole.  The Technical 
Committee also did its best to be responsive to public 
testimony while following the criteria.11 
11In explaining why  the Commission declined to more perfectly adhere to 
the constitutional district within district guideline, Commissioner Nonaka 
said that “it would be extremely difficult to consider other crtieria [sic] 
if that one principle was used as a guiding factor.  The Commission would 
have to prioritize drawing arbitrary lines without regard for community 
input.” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
21 
  
Commissioner Ono, who like Commissioner Nonaka was on the 
technical committee, declared that the committee considered the 
district within district guidelines in developing the Plan and 
that, in her opinion, the Plan “achieve[s] the overriding 
objective of voter equality and best represent[s] the balancing 
of constitutional and statutory redistricting criteria.” 
Petitioners may disagree with the weight the Commission 
assigned to the district within district guidelines, but they 
have not shown that the Commission disregarded them in 
developing and adopting the Plan.  To the contrary, the record 
reflects that the Commission holistically considered the 
district within district guidelines when exercising its 
discretion to develop and adopt the Plan.  The Commission’s 
consideration of the district within district guidelines was 
thus adequate under both article IV, section 6 and HRS § 25-
2(b)(5).12 
  
                                                 
12  We base this holding solely on the information in the record concerning 
the Plan’s development.  The Commission’s argument that the Plan is 
constitutional because the number of state house districts split by state 
senate districts in the Plan (33) is in line with that found in previous 
reapportionment plans lacks merit.  The Commission is right that the Plan’s 
compliance with the constitutional district within district guideline is 
similar to that of the 2012, 2001, and 1991 reapportionment plans, which 
split 30, 31, and 38 state house districts across state senate districts.  But this fact has no bearing on our analysis: e ven the most longstanding 
practice cannot transform unconstitutional actions into constitutional ones. 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 4. The Commission did not abuse its discretion by considering 
factors other than those enumerated in article I, section 6 
and HRS § 25-2(b) 
 
The Commission must consider the article IV, section 6 and 
HRS § 25-2(b) guidelines in reapportionment.  But it is not 
prohibited from pursuing other rational and non-discriminatory 
policy goals through its redistricting.13  So Petitioners’ claim 
that the Plan is invalid because the Commission unlawfully 
allowed its “preference” for preserving legacy districts to get 
in the way of drawing a reapportionment plan that better 
effectuated the district within district guidelines has no 
merit. 
There are two reasons why the Commission did not abuse its 
discretion by crafting and adopting a plan that sought the 
preservation of legacy district boundaries. 
First, the constitution explicitly contemplates that 
reapportionment will involve the redrawing of district lines.  
                                                 
13  McNeil provides a good example of a rational state policy that the 
reapportionment commission must consider alongside article IV, section 6 and 
HRS § 25-2(b)’s requirements and guidelines: compliance with the federal 
Voting Rights Act.  In McNeil, the New Jersey Supreme Court considered a 
challenge to the New Jersey constitution’s requirement that no county or 
municipality should be divided between legislative districts.  Under New 
Jersey’s constitution, “[u]nless necessary to meet the [contiguity, compactness or equal population] requirements, no county or municipality 
shall be divided among Assembly districts unless it shall contain more than 
one-fortieth of the total number of inhabitants of the state.”  828 A.2d at 
845 (cleaned up).  The court held this constitutional requirement was 
preempted by the federal Voting Rights Act, since full compliance with it 
would result in the “packing” of minority voters and the dilution of their 
electoral influence.  Id. at 857. 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
23 See Haw. Const. art. IV, § 6 (“Upon the determination of the 
total number of members of each house of the state legislature 
to which each basic island unit is entitled, the commission 
shall apportion the members among the districts therein and 
shall redraw district lines where necessary [to equalize the 
population in each district as much as practicable].” (Emphasis 
added.)).  This use of the word “redraw” presumes that existing 
districts may serve as the starting point for redistricting.  
The commission is required to consider the constitutional 
district within district guideline in adjusting district lines 
to account for population changes since the last 
reapportionment; but because it is tasked with redrawing it is 
also implicitly authorized to consider the boundaries of 
existing legislative districts. 
Second, the Supreme Court has recognized that “preserving 
the cores of prior districts” is a legitimate state legislative 
policy that may justify minor deviations from the requirement 
that each district should have an equal population.  In Karcher 
v. Daggett, 462 U.S. 725 (1983), the court explained that it was
“willing to defer to state legislative policies, so long as they
are consistent with constitutional norms, even if they require
small differences in the population of congressional districts.”
Id. at 740.  The court continued, explicitly recognizing that
keeping legacy districts intact was a “legitimate objective:”*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
24 
 Any number of consistently applied legislative policies 
might justify some variance, including, for instance, making 
districts compact, respecting municipal boundaries, 
preserving the cores of prior districts, and avoiding 
contests between incumbent Representatives.  As long as the 
criteria are nondiscriminatory, these are all legitimate 
objectives that on a proper showing could justify minor 
population deviations. 
 
Id. (emphasis added)(citation omitted). 
 To the extent that the reapportionment commission sought to 
preserve legacy districts, that was a “legitimate objective.”  
See id.; see also Chapman v. Meier, 407 F.Supp. 649, 664 (D.N.D. 
1975) (adopting a court-ordered apportionment plan and 
explaining that though the court had “altered most of the 
existing legislative districts to comply with the one man-one 
vote standard” it also “endeavored to retain the core 
of existing districts in the new reapportionment plan” so that 
“extreme disruption in the election processes may be avoided”). 
We see no reason to conclude that article IV, section 6 or 
HRS § 25-2(b) limit the commission’s discretion to craft a 
reapportionment plan that complies with constitutional equal 
protection mandates, strictly conforms to the mandatory 
requirements of article IV, section 6 and HRS § 25-2(b), and 
also seeks to promote stability by preserving legacy districts.

 III. CONCLUSION 
 The Plan complies with article IV, section 6 and HRS § 25-
2(b); Petitioners have not shown that they are entitled to the 
requested relief.  The Petition is denied.
