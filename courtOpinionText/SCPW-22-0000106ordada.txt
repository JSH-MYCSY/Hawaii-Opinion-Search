UISA KUHLMANN, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the petition for writ of habeas 
corpus, filed on March 9, 2022, petitioner presents no special 
reason for invoking the supreme courtâ€™s original jurisdiction. See Oili v. Chang, 57 Haw. 511, 512, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976). Therefore, 
It is ordered that the petition for writ of habeas 
corpus is denied. 
It is further ordered that the clerk of the appellate 
court shall process the petition for writ of habeas corpus without payment of the filing fee. 
DATED: Honolulu, 
Hawai#i, March 17, 2022.
