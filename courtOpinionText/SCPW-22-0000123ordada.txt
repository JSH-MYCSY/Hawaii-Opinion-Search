SCPW-22-0000123 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI#I 
JUAN VIANEZ, Petitioner 
vs. 
CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT and 
CITY AND COUNTY OF HONOLULU, Respondents. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the petition for writ of 
mandamus, filed on March 14, 2022, petitioner fails to 
demonstrate that he is entitled to the requested extraordinary 
relief from this court. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204, 
982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary 
remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action). Therefore, 
It is ordered that the petition for writ of mandamus is 
denied. It is further ordered that the clerk of the appellate 
court shall process the petition for writ of mandamus without 
payment of the filing fee. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 21, 2022.
