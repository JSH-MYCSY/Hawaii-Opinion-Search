vs. 
S. WEAD, Warden of Saguaro Correctional Center; and
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondents. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(Case No. 2PC011000015) 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS 
(By: Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ., and Circuit Judge
Castagnetti, in place of Recktenwald, C.J., recused) 
Upon consideration of the petition for writ of habeas 
corpus, filed on March 31, 2022, petitioner presents no special 
reason for invoking the supreme court’s original jurisdiction. See Oili v. Chang, 57 Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976). Therefore, 
It is ordered that the petition for writ of habeas 
corpus is denied. 
It is further ordered that the clerk of the appellate 
court shall process the petition for writ of habeas corpus without payment of the filing fee. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 6, 2022.
