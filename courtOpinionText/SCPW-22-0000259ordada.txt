IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
IN RE DAVID P. MORROW, Petitioner 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(Case Nos. FC-DA 21-1-0507; CAAP-21-0000433) 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the petition for writ of 
mandamus, filed on April 8, 2022, petitioner fails to demonstrate 
that he is entitled to the requested extraordinary relief. See 
Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a 
writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; such a writ is not intended to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the trial courts, cure a mere legal error, or serve as a legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedures). Therefore, 
It is ordered that the petition for writ of mandamus is 
denied. It is further ordered that the clerk of the appellate 
court shall process the petition for writ of mandamus without 
payment of the filing fee. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 26, 2022.
