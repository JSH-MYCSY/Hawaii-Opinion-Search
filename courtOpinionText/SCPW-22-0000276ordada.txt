ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR EXTRAORDINARY WRIT 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
 
  Upon consideration of petitioners Maui Meadows 
Neighborhood Association and the Pono Power Coalition’s petition 
for extraordinary writ, filed on April 17, 2022, and the record, 
petitioners fail to demonstrate that they are entitled to the 
requested extraordinary writ to warrant this court’s 
intervention and have alternative means to seek relief.  See, 
e.g., Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawaiʻi 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 Electronically Filed

Dkt. 20 ODDP2 
 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will 
not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and 
indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to 
redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested 
action).  Therefore,  
 It is ordered that the petition for extraordinary writ 
is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaii, May 9, 2022.
