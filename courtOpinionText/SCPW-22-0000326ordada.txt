IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
DEXTER SMITH, Petitioner 
vs. 
THE HONORABLE CHRISTINE E. KURIYAMA, 
Judge of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit,
State of 
Hawai# i, Respondent Judge. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 1PR161000009) 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of petitioner Dexter Smith’s 
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on May 12, 2022, the 
documents attached and submitted in support, and the record, 
petitioner fails to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to 
the requested relief and that he lacks alternative means to seek 
relief. Nor has petitioner shown that Judge Kuriyama exceeded 
her jurisdiction, committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of 
discretion, or refused to act on a subject properly before the 
court under circumstances in which it has a legal duty to act. 
Judge Kuriyama filed an order denying petitioner’s motion on May 
25, 2022, and Judge Kuriyama was not required to recuse herself 
from considering the motion. See Aga v. Hundahl, 78 Hawai# i 230, 
242, 891 P.2d 1022, 1034 (1995) (“[W]e have long adhered to the general rule that, standing alone, ‘mere erroneous or adverse 
rulings by the trial judge do not spell bias or prejudice[.]’” 
(Quoting Peters v. Jamieson, 48 Haw. 247, 264, 397 P.2d 575, 586 
(1964)). An extraordinary writ is thus not warranted. See Kema 
v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) 
(explaining that a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy 
that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear 
and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means 
to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested 
action; such a writ is meant to restrain a judge who has exceeded 
the judge’s jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest 
abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly 
before the court under circumstances in which the judge has a 
legal duty to act). 
Accordingly, 
It is ordered that the petition for writ of mandamus is 
denied. 
It is further ordered that the clerk of the appellate 
court shall process the petition for writ of mandamus without 
payment of the filing fee.
