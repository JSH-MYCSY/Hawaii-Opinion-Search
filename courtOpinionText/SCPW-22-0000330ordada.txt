ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.)
Upon consideration of Larry E. Pagan’s (petitioner’s)
letter filed on May 16, 2022, which we construe as a petition for
writ of mandamus, and the record, petitioner fails to demonstrate
a clear and indisputable right to the requested relief and that
he lacks alternative means to seek relief.  Petitioner may seek
relief in the circuit court by filing a Hawai#i Rules of Penal
Procedure Rule 40 Petition, as appropriate.  An extraordinary
writ is not warranted.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204,
982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (explaining that a writ of mandamus is
an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack
of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or
obtain the requested action).  Accordingly,
It is ordered that the petition for writ of mandamus is
denied.Electronically Filed
