IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
DENNIS VELASCO, Petitioner, 
vs. 
THE HONORABLE THOMAS A.K. HAIA, 
Judge of the District Court of the First Circuit, 
State of Hawai# i, Respondent Judge. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 1DRC-22-0001832) 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of petitioner Dennis Velasco’s 
petition for writ of mandamus, filed on June 6, 2022, and the 
record, petitioner has not demonstrated a clear and indisputable 
right to the requested relief and that he lacks alternative means 
to seek relief.  Nor has petitioner shown that Judge Haia 
exceeded his jurisdiction, committed a flagrant and manifest 
abuse of discretion, or refused to act on a subject properly 
before the court under circumstances in which it has a legal duty 
to act.  Petitioner may seek dismissal or other relief in the 
first district court, see District Court Rules of Civil Procedure 
(DCRCP) Rule 12, and may raise Judge Haia’s order denying 
petitioner’s request for a jury trial as an issue on appeal, see Hawai# i Revised Statutes § 641-1(a).  The issuance of a writ of 
mandamus is not intended to supersede the legal discretionary 
authority of the lower court, nor is it meant to serve as a legal 
remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedure.  An extraordinary 
writ is thus not warranted.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 
204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (explaining that a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the 
petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief 
and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged 
wrong or obtain the requested action; such a writ is meant to 
restrain a judge who has exceeded the judge’s jurisdiction, has 
committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has 
refused to act on a subject properly before the court under 
circumstances in which the judge has a legal duty to act). 
Accordingly, 
It is ordered that the petition for writ of mandamus is 
denied. 
It is further ordered that the clerk of the appellate 
court shall process the petition for writ of mandamus without 
payment of the filing fee. 
It is finally ordered that the clerk of the appellate 
court shall transfer the petition for writ of mandamus to the 
first district court to be filed as a motion under DCRCP Rule 12 
in Case No. 1DRC-22-0001832. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, June 20, 2022.
