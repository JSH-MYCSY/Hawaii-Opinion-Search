IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
AARON WILLIAMS, Petitioner, 
vs. 
THE HONORABLE JAMES R. ROUSE,
Judge of the Family Court of the Second Circuit,
State of Hawai# i, Respondent Judge, 
and 
ALENA WILLIAMS, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 2DV211000420) 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS OR PROHIBITION 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of Petitioner’s petition for a writ 
of mandamus or prohibition, filed on July 29, 2022, the documents 
attached and submitted in support, and the record, Petitioner has not demonstrated a clear and indisputable right to relief. Petitioner has also not demonstrated that the respondent judge exceeded the court’s jurisdiction, committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or refused to act on a matter properly before the court under circumstances in which the judge has a legal duty to act. Petitioner is thus not entitled to the 
requested extraordinary writs. See Kema v. Gaddis
, 91 Hawai# i 
200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (explaining that a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action; such a writ is meant to restrain a judge who has exceeded the judge’s jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before the court under circumstances in which the judge has a legal duty to act); 
Honolulu Advertiser, Inc. v. Takao, 59 Haw. 237, 241, 
580 P.2d 58, 62 (1978) (a writ of prohibition “is an extraordinary remedy . . . to restrain a judge of an inferior court from acting beyond or in excess of [their] jurisdiction”). Accordingly, 
It is ordered that the petition for a writ of mandamus 
or prohibition is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, September 19, 2022.
