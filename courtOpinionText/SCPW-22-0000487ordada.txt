(CASE NO. 1CPN-21-0000020)
ORDER DENYING WITHOUT PREJUDICE PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.)
Upon consideration of Petitioner’s letter filed on
August 11, 2022, which we construe as a petition for writ of
mandamus, and the record, Petitioner’s Rule 40 proceeding was
assigned to Judge Shanlyn A.S. Park of the circuit court on
August 26, 2022.  An extraordinary writ is thus not warranted at
this time.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai#i 200, 204, 982 P.2d
334, 338 (1999) (a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy
that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear
and indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means
to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requestedElectronically Filed
