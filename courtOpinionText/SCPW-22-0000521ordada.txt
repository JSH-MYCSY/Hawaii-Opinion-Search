HE HONORABLE JAMES H. ASHFORD, 
Judge of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit,
State of Hawai# i, Respondent Judge, 
and 
D
AYNA CLAIRE OWSKEY, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 1CCV-20-0001060) 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of 
mandamus and/or extraordinary writ, filed on August 27, 2022, the 
documents attached and submitted in support, and the record, Petitioner has not demonstrated a clear and indisputable right to relief because Petitioner’s expert valued the life interest based on an estimate of Petitioner’s life expectancy, which appears to be part of Petitioner’s claim for damages in the First Amended Complaint, see Hawai# i Rules of Evidence Rule 504(d)(3); Brende 
v. Hara, 113 Hawai# i 424, 430-31, 153 P.3d 1109, 1115-16 (2007), 
and the terms of the stipulated protective order is not before 
this court in this original proceeding. 
An extraordinary writ is 
thus not warranted. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai# i 200, 204-05, 
982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999). 
Accordingly, 
It is ordered that the petition is denied. DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, October 14, 2022.
