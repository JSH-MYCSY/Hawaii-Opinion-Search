IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
KAU
#I W. POAHA, Petitioner, 
vs. 
C
HIEF OF POLICE ARTHUR JOSEPH LOGAN, 
HONOLULU POLICE DEPARTMENT, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
Upon consideration of the petition for a “peremptory” 
writ of mandamus, filed on August 29, 2022, the documents 
attached and submitted in support, and the record, Petitioner has 
not demonstrated a clear and indisputable right to relief, nor a 
lack of alternative means to seek relief. An extraordinary writ 
is thus not warranted. See Barnett v. Broderick, 84 Hawai# i 109, 
111, 929 P.2d 1359, 1361 (1996); Salling v. Moon, 76 Hawai# i 273, 
274 n.3, 874 P.2d 1098, 1099 n.3 (1994). 
Accordingly, 
It is ordered that the petition is denied. DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i
, September 26, 2022.
