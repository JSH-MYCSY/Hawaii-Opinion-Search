SCPW-22-0000526 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
SOF-XI KAUAI PV GOLF, L.P.,
a Delaware limited partnership, Petitioner, 
vs. 
THE HONORABLE KATHLEEN N.A. WATANABE,
Judge of the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit,
State of Hawai# i, Respondent Judge, 
and 
LORRAINE MULL, as Trustee of the Lorraine S. Mull Revocable
Trust; and FRANCES R. WHITE, as Co-Trustee of the Andrew and
Frances White Trust dated April 11, 2019, Respondents. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 5CCV-21-0000063) 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.,
and Circuit Judge Kuriyama, in place of Nakayama, J., recused)
 
Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of 
mandamus, filed on August 30, 2022, the documents attached and 
submitted in support, and the record, the Respondent Judge had 
jurisdiction to consider whether the circuit court had 
jurisdiction, and it was within the Respondent Judge’s discretion 
to grant or deny a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. 
If Petitioner disagreed with the Respondent Judge’s ruling on a motion to dismiss, Petitioner had alternative means to seek 
relief by pursuing an interlocutory appeal. See
 Hawai# i Revised 
Statutes § 641-1(b); Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
4(a)(1). A writ of mandamus is not intended to be used in lieu 
of normal appellate procedures. 
The Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order granting 
the second motion for order to show cause, filed on August 24, 
2022, which was filed after and based in part on the August 2, 
2022 hearing, does not require the production of work product. 
See State v. Milne
, 149 Hawai# i 329, 335, 489 P.3d 433, 439 
(2021) (“[A] judge’s written order generally controls over its oral statements.”). The Order instead requires Petitioner to 
provide a privilege log at the time of document production, which 
does not constitute a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion. 
See
 Hawai# i Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 26(b)(6). An 
extraordinary writ is thus not warranted. See Kema v. Gaddis
, 91 
Hawai# i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999). Accordingly, 
It is ordered that the petition is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, October 14, 2022.
