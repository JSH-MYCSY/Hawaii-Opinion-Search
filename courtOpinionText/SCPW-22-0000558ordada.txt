IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I 
DAVID BARTLEY LEAS, Petitioner, 
vs. 
THE HONORABLE GALE CHING,
Judge of the Family Court of the First Circuit, State of 
Hawai# i,
Respondent Judge, 
and 
CRYSTAL WAITKUS LEAS, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ., and
Circuit Judge Morikawa, in place of Nakayama, J., recused) 
Upon consideration of the Petitionerâ€™s September 21, 
2022 petition for a writ of mandamus, the record in the 
underlying litigation, 1DV161001014, and the record in CAAP-18-0000211, CAAP-18-0000536, CAAP-18-0000630, CAAP-18-0000704, CAAP-18-0000877, CAAP-19-0000023, CAAP-20-0000593, CAAP-21-0000454, and CAAP-22-0000549, we conclude that the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that he has a clear and indisputable right to relief and no other remedy, see State ex rel. Kaneshiro v. Huddy, 82 Hawai& i 188, 193, 921 P.2d 108, 113 (1996). We further conclude that a review of the entirety of the aforementioned 
cases does not establish conduct by the Respondent Judge that would warrant requiring disqualification. Cf. Peters v. 
Jamieson, 48 Haw. 247, 263-64, 397 P.2d 575, 586 (1964). Therefore, 
IT IS ORDERED that the petition is denied. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the motion to disqualify the 
Respondent Judge from presiding over future proceedings in this matter is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, October 14, 2022.
