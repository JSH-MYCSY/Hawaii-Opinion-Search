   Rule 12(g) allows a judge who dismisses a case based on a 
“defect in the institution of the prosecution or in the charge” 
to order the defendant held for a “specified time” while the 
State re-files charges.  Up until recently, courts have rarely 
invoked Rule 12(g).  But the present wave of dismissals in cases 
where the State did not obtain an indictment from a grand jury 
has prompted a surge in the rule’s use. 
 Scott Deangelo is the defendant in one such case.  After the court dismissed charges against him, it ordered under Rule 
12(g) that Deangelo remain in custody for 90 days, while the 
State sought a grand jury indictment.  Deangelo argues that Rule 
12(g) violates the Fourth Amendment of the United States 
Constitution, which protects against unreasonable seizures, and 
Hawaiʻi
 Revised Statutes (HRS) § 803-9(5) (Supp. 2021), which 
requires an “arrested person” to be taken “before a qualified 
magistrate for examination” within 48 hours of arrest.  While 
Deangelo’s case has been mooted by his indictment eleven days 
later, his challenge to Rule 12(g) presents an issue of public 
importance.  
We hold that, when probable cause has been found after a 
preliminary hearing but the case is dismissed without prejudice due to a defect in the institution of the prosecution, Rule 
12(g) permits a court to hold a defendant in custody or continue *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 bail for a specified time that is reasonable under the 
circumstances.  
I. 
The police arrested Defendant-Petitioner Scott Deangelo 
without a warrant on February 8, 2022 for second-degree murder.    The next day, the district court made a judicial determination 
of probable cause for the extended restraint of liberty and set 
bail at $500,000.  On February 17, the court confirmed its probable cause and bail findings.  After a two-day preliminary 
hearing on February 25, a different district court judge found 
probable cause to believe that Deangelo committed the charged 
felonies and sent the case to circuit court.  
On March 10, Deangelo was arraigned without a grand jury 
indictment.  The circuit court confirmed bail at $500,000.  In 
response to the State’s motion to either hold Deangelo without 
bail or increase bail, the circuit court ordered on June 6 that 
Deangelo be held without bail.  The court based its order on the seriousness of Deangelo’s charged crimes and its finding that 
Deangelo posed a danger to the community and was a flight risk.   
On August 25, Deangelo moved to dismiss the case because he 
had not been indicted in accordance with HRS § 801-1 (2014).    
See State v. Obrero, 151 Hawaiʻ i
 472, 517 P.3d 755 (2022).  The 
State conceded the motion, but requested that the court dismiss *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 the case without prejudice.  Citing Rule 12(g), the State also 
asked the court to hold Deangelo in custody without bail. 
On October 10, the circuit court dismissed Deangelo’s case 
without prejudice and denied all pending motions as moot.  But 
under HRPP Rule 12(g), the court ordered that Deangelo remain in 
custody without bail for 90 days.  In the order, the circuit 
court made detailed factual findings.  These findings reviewed 
the impact of Covid-19 on grand jury proceedings over the past two and a half years.  The court observed that for fourteen of 
the last thirty months, grand juries were unavailable in the 
First Circuit.  The court pointed out that when the State 
charged Deangelo via complaint, grand jury proceedings were not 
taking place in the First Circuit.  In light of this, the 
court’s previous no-bail finding, and based on “the offenses 
alleged, the possible punishment upon conviction, Defendant’s 
financial ability to afford bail, the serious risk that 
Defendant will flee, and the serious risk that Defendant poses a danger to any person or the community,” the court decided to 
hold Deangelo in custody.    
By October 16, Deangelo had not yet been indicted.  He 
filed a petition for an extraordinary writ to this court.  His 
continued custody under 12(g) violated the Hawaiʻ i
 and United 
States Constitutions, as well as HRS § 803-9(5), he argued.  
Deangelo wanted to be released.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 Five days later, on October 21, a grand jury indicted 
Deangelo on three counts — murder in the second degree, place to 
keep a pistol or revolver, and place to keep ammunition.  Eleven 
days had elapsed since the case’s dismissal. 
The parties disagree on whether Deangelo’s indictment has 
mooted the court’s 12(g) order holding him in custody for up to 
90 days.  But both urge us to review the broader issue of Rule 
12(g)’s validity, since it is an issue of public interest that may repeat while evading meaningful judicial review.  See Moana 
v. Wong, 141 Hawaiʻ i 100, 115, 405 P.3d 536, 551 (2017).  Because 
we agree that the 12(g) issue should be resolved promptly, we assume the mootness of the order holding Deangelo but go on to the merits of Deangelo’s statutory and constitutional challenges 
to Rule 12(g) itself.  
HRPP Rule 12(g)
1 reads:  
If the court grants a motion based on a defect in the 
institution of the prosecution or in the charge, it may 
also order that the defendant be held in custody or that the defendant’s bail be continued for a specified time 
pending the filing of a new charge.  Nothing in this rule 
shall be deemed to affect provisions of any statute relating to periods of limitations. 
 
 
1  The rule, formerly known as Rule 12(b)(5), is a slightly modified 
version of Federal R. Crim. P. 12(g).  The federal rule provides:  
 
If the court grants a motion to dismiss based on a defect in instituting the prosecution, in the indictment, or in 
the information, it may order the defendant to be released 
or detained under 18 U.S.C. § 3142 for a specified time 
until a new indictment or information is filed.  This rule does not affect any federal statutory period of 
limitations. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 Deangelo contends that Rule 12(g), on its face and as 
applied to him, violates HRS § 803-9(5) and the Fourth Amendment 
of the United States Constitution.2 
Deangelo argues that when the court dismissed his case, all 
proceedings against him terminated, including the prior judicial 
determination of probable cause to hold him.  So he was like a 
person arrested without a warrant.  And this person has rights.  
First, they have a statutory right under HRS § 803-9(5) to be charged or brought before a district court judge for a probable 
cause determination within 48 hours.  Second, they have a Fourth 
Amendment and Hawaiʻ i constitution
 al right to a probable cause 
finding made before arrest or promptly after it, where promptly 
means within 48 hours.  Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 126 
(1975); County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 56 
(1991); Constitution of the State of Hawaiʻ i articl e I, section 
7.  By empowering judges to hold people in custody after dismissal for a specified period of time, Deangelo argues that 
Rule 12(g) on its face violates both HRS § 803-9(5) and his 
constitutional rights against unreasonable seizure.  Since a 
court rule cannot abridge substantive rights, Rule 12(g) “must 
be stricken,” or if upheld, must be capped at 48 hours.  
 
2  Deangelo mentions article I, s ection 7 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution, 
saying if there’s a Fourth Amendment violation, then there’s an article I, 
section 7 violation.  But Deangelo presents no arguments specific to our 
constitution’s Fourth Amendment analogue.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
7 
 Not so, says the State.  It argues that a person against 
whom a judicial determination of probable cause has already been 
made is not in the same position as a person who has just been 
arrested without that finding.  The plain language of HRS § 803-
9(5) governs only a person’s “initial appearance” in court after 
an arrest and has no relevance whatsoever to Rule 12(g).  As to 
Deangelo’s constitutional claims, the State maintains that all 
required constitutional procedures were followed — probable cause to hold Deangelo was found within 48 hours and confirmed 
after a preliminary hearing. 
II. 
The equivalent of Rule 12(g) has existed in federal law 
since 1944 and as of today has been adopted by at least 26 states.  The rule also has roots in the common law.  See Latson 
v. State, 146 A.2d 597, 600 (Del. 1958) (observing that the rule 
“embod[ies] the practice theretofore existing that on the 
dismissal of an indictment the defendant is not automatically entitled to discharge, and the court may hold him in custody.”)  
Yet, courts seldom invoke 12(g).  See U.S. v. Powers, 168 F.3d 
943, 949 (7th Cir. 1999) (commenting on the “dearth of reported cases”).  
In Dawson v. Lanham, we suggested in passing that the trial 
court should have used this rule to hold the defendants in 
custody after the court dismissed their indictment.  53 Haw. 76, *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
8 
 83, 488 P.2d 329, 334 (1971).  In his dissent, Justice Abe 
pointed out that Rule 12(g) is valid only to the extent that it 
does not abridge substantive rights, a question that the Dawson 
Court did not consider.  Id. at 87 n.4, 488 P.2d at 336 n.4. 
 Fifty years later, we take up this question. 
The Fourth Amendment protects against “unreasonable . . . 
seizures.”  U.S. Const. Am. IV.  It “requires a judicial determination of probable cause as a prerequisite to extended restraint of liberty following arrest.”  Gerstein, 420 U.S. at 
114.  That judicial determination, if made after arrest, must be made promptly.  Id. at 125-26.  The Supreme Court has held that 
determinations made within 48 hours of arrest will generally satisfy this requirement.  McLaughlin, 500 U.S. at 56.  HRS 
§ 803-9(5) codifies this rule in Hawaiʻ i law.  Failure to 
promptly determine probable cause or a defect in the probable 
cause determination itself may render any subsequent custody 
unreasonable.  See Manuel v. City of Joliet, Ill., 137 S. Ct. 
911, 918-19 (2017) (holding that probable cause obtained based on false police statements renders a seizure unreasonable.) 
Here, no one disputes that sufficient probable cause to 
arrest and hold Deangelo was found.  Also, through a preliminary hearing a judge determined that probable cause existed to 
believe Deangelo had committed the dismissed charges.  The 
constitutional question turns, then, on whether there was still
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
9 
 probable cause to hold Deangelo after the court dismissed his 
case.  
Typically, a dismissal ends the court proceedings, leaving 
“nothing further to be accomplished.”  State v. Kalani, 87 
Hawaiʻi 260, 261, 953 P.2d 1358, 1359 (1998).  And we have said 
that after dismissal “even if the prosecution is allowed to 
recharge the defendant, recharging [them] does not revive the 
original case.”  Id. at 262, 953 P.2d at 1360.  In Kalani, 
however, we considered whether a dismissal without prejudice constituted a final order for the purpose of appeal.  Kalani did 
not involve a Rule 12(g) order.  
Rule 12(g) creates a limited exception to the procedure 
that a dismissal completely terminates the original case.  If 
the court grants a dismissal based on “a defect in the 
institution of the prosecution or in the charge,” the rule 
allows the judge to hold the defendant in custody (or continue 
bail) while the State re-charges.  In effect, dismissal paired 
with a 12(g) grant resets the proceedings to where they were 
before the defective charge or indictment was made.  In Deangelo’s case, that means after a preliminary hearing at which 
the court found probable cause. 
A “[p]reliminary hearing is for the purpose of determining 
whether there is probable cause to warrant holding the accused 
for action by the grand jury.”  Engstrom v. Naauao, 51 Haw. 318, *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
10 
 320, 459 P.2d 376, 377 (1969); see also State v. Tominaga, 45 
Haw. 604, 609, 372 P.2d 356, 359 (1962) (“The only purpose of a 
preliminary hearing is to determine whether there is sufficient 
evidence against an accused to warrant his being held for action
by a grand jury.” (citations omitted)).  Because grand juries 
may take time to convene, the preliminary hearing helps ensure 
that a defendant is not unreasonably held before indictment.  
Within this framework, a rule like 12(g) does not offend 
the Fourth Amendment, article I, section 7, or HRS § 803-9(5), which duplicates the holding of McLaughlin.  We stress that 
12(g) is a procedural rule, limited to defects in the charging process.  The rule cannot abridge a substantive right.  HRS 
§ 602-11 (2016).  If, as in City of Joliet, it were discovered 
that police had sworn false statements in order to obtain a probable cause determination, the seizure would be unreasonable.  
In that case, custody could not continue without violating the 
Fourth Amendment and article I, section 7, and Rule 12(g) could not change that.  
No such defect in probable cause occurred here.  The State 
charged Deangelo via complaint and a preliminary hearing was 
conducted before our clarification that prosecutions based on 
complaint and preliminary hearing alone are unlawful under HRS 
§ 801-1.  See Obrero, 151
  472, 517 P.3d 755.  By 
dismissing the case, the circuit court addressed this defect in Hawaiʻi*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
11 
 the institution of the prosecution; by invoking Rule 12(g) the 
court ensured that a defendant it believed to be a danger to the 
public and a flight risk would remain in custody while the State 
sought a grand jury indictment.  Custody under these 
circumstances abridges no substantive right.3 
From the question of whether Rule 12(g) is constitutional, 
we turn to the question of how long a court may hold a defendant 
under the Rule.  
The plain text of 12(g) does not specify how long a 
defendant can be held in custody, only that the time be “specified.”  Several states that have adopted this rule have 
embedded specific time limits, ranging from one day to 60 days.
4 
Other states have made explicit that the specified time 
must be reasonable.5 
Still others have decided that when a prosecution is 
dismissed, the defendant must be released.6 
 
3  The length of custody authorized under 12(g) may not, for example, 
abridge a defendant’s right to a speedy trial. 
 
4  See Kan. Stat. Ann. § 22-3208(6) (custody limited to one day after 
dismissal); Wyo. R. Prac. & P. 12(i) (48 hours); Wis. Stat. § 971.31(6) (72 
hours); Md. Crim. Causes. 4- 252(h)(1) (ten days if the crime charged is a 
crime of violence, otherwise immediate discharge); Ohio Crim. R. 12(j) 
(fourteen days); Iowa R.2.11(7) (20 days); Ky. R. Crim. P. RCr 8.24(2) 
(within 60 days or until the discharge of the next grand jury assembled, whichever is sooner). 
 
5  See Utah R. Crim. P. 12(h); Ala. R. Crim. P. 15.5(a); Fla. R. Crim. P. 
R. 3.190(e). 
 
6  See Ariz. R. Crim. P. 16.4(e); Me. R. Crim. P. 12(5); Mont. Code Ann. 
§ 46-13-402. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
12 
 No court, federal or state, has interpreted the “specified 
time” language to mandate a fixed maximum time in all cases.  
See, e.g., Esguerra v. State, No. A-8395, 2005 WL 19220, at *3 
(Alaska Ct. App. Jan. 5, 2005) (“[T]he time which the State can hold the defendant before reindicting him must be specified, but 
is not limited to ten days.”); Powers, 168 F.3d at 948 
(declining to rule on what a “specified time” constitutes, but noting that such an extension potentially “cannot in itself affect the speedy trial clock”); U.S. v. Silverman, 129 F. Supp. 
496, 514 (D. Conn. 1955) (continuing bail for 21 days under the federal equivalent to 12(g) without discussion). 
The rule does not contemplate a universal time limit and 
setting one would undermine the trial court’s ability to tailor 
its order to the circumstances.  We hold only that the time 
specified must be reasonable in light of all the circumstances.  
Relevant circumstances may include the status of the case (is 
the case at the discovery and pretrial motions stage or is trial imminent?), the unprecedented exigencies of the Covid-19 
pandemic, the inability of the State to convene grand juries 
during a particular time, the nature and seriousness of the 
defendant’s alleged crime(s), the extent to which the defendant *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
13 
 poses a flight risk and a danger to the community, and the
defendant’s ability to afford bail.  7 
The circuit court properly looked to these factors.  Since 
the State indicted Deangelo before the 12(g) order expired, we 
do not find it necessary to determine whether the circuit court 
abused its discretion in specifying 90 days. 
However, we emphasize that no state that has specified a 
deadline to recharge under 12(g) has allowed custody to stretch beyond 60 days and that most have settled on a far lower number.  
We do not foresee any circumstances that will justify custody 
longer than 60 days under a 12(g) order.  In Deangelo’s case, 
despite the grand jury postponements identified by the circuit 
court, the State was able to secure an indictment within eleven 
days.  We expect that this time will continue to decrease as 
defendants are lawfully charged.

7  While Rule 12(g) gives the court the option of holding the defendant in 
custody or continuing bail, the court must support either determination with 
findings of fact that comply with HRS Chapter 804.
