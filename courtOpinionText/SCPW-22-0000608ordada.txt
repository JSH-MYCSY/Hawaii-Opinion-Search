  Upon consideration of the petition for writ of 
mandamus filed on October 17, 2022, and the record, Graham’s 
letters dated July 24 and August 24, 2022 are before Judge 
Rowena Somerville and appear to request a copy of the January 
28, 2022 order dismissing Graham’s Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 petition so that Graham may attach a 
copy of the order to a notice of appeal.  The relief Graham 
seeks may be addressed by the circuit court in response to these 
letters.  See Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawaiʻ i Electronically Filed

 Rules 2.2.17, 2.2.19; see also HRPP Rules 40(g)(3), 49(b)(5), & 
49(e)(3).  An extraordinary writ is thus not warranted.  See 
Kema v. Gaddis, 91  Hawaiʻi 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999); 
Barnett v. Broderick, 84 Hawaiʻ i 109, 111, 929 P.2d 1359, 1361 
(1996).  Accordingly,  
 It is ordered that the petition is denied. 
 It is further ordered that the appellate court clerk 
shall process the petition without payment of the filing fee. 
 It is finally ordered that the appellate clerk shall 
serve a copy of the petition and this order on Judge Rowena 
Somerville.
