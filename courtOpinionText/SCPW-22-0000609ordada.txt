 motions.  Petitioner has not demonstrated a clear and 
indisputable right to relief, nor a lack of alternative means to 
seek relief.  An extraordinary writ is thus not warranted.  See 
Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawaiʻ i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999).  
Accordingly,  
 It is ordered that the petition is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai i, November 4, 2022.
