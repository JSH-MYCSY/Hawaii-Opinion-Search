IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI‘ I 
 
 
DEXTER K. KA‘ IAMA, Petitioner, 
 
vs. 
 
CHAIRPERSON OF THE DISCIPLINARY BOARD 
OF THE 
HAWAI‘I SUPREME COURT, Respondent. 
 
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
 
 Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of mandamus 
or other extraordinary writ and the separate motion for judicial 
notice, filed by attorney Dexter Ka‘ iama on October 26, 2022, and 
the exhibits appended to both submissions, we conclude that Petitioner Ka‘ iama, in his petition and attached exhibits, has 
failed to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief 
and, hence, is not entitled to the requested writ.  See Kema v. 
Gaddis, 91 Hawai‘ i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999).  We 
also find that the documents and publications cited in the Electronically Filed

 motion for judicial notice, and in the appended documents which 
are the subject of the motion for judicial notice, are not 
adjudicative facts under the meaning of Rule 201 of the Hawai‘ i 
Rules of Evidence.  Therefore,  
 IT IS ORDERED that the petition is denied. 
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the motion for judicial notice 
is denied.
