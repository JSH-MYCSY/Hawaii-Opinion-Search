ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.) 
 
 Upon consideration of the submissions to this court from 
Dorothy Uwekoolani, originally filed in SCOT-22-0000616 on 
October 18 and 24, 2022, we deem them to be, in total, a petition for a writ of mandamus against the Board of Water 
Supply for Maui County, the State of Hawaiʻ i
 Commission on Water 
Resource Management, and the Department of Hawaiian Homelands, 
but further find and conclude that the petitioner has failed to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief and the 
lack of an alternate remedy.  See State 
ex rel. Kaneshiro v. 
Huddy, 82 Hawaiʻ i 188, 193, 921 P.2d 108, 113 (1996).  Therefore, Electronically Filed
