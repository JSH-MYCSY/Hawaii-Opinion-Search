Dkt. 4 ODDP2  /s/ Mark E. Recktenwald  
 /s/ Paula A. Nakayama 
 /s/ Sabrina S. McKenna 
 /s/ Michael D. Wilson 
 /s/ Todd W. Eddins  redress adequately the alleged wrong or to obtain the requested 
action.  Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai
ʻi 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 
(1999). 
The decision of whether to enter the written order under 
Rule 20(a) of the Hawaiʻ i Probate Rules (HPR) is within the 
discretion of the court.  In re Est. of Kam, 110 Hawaiʻ i 8, 24, 
129 P.3d 511, 527 (2006).  And, any purported error in the 
court’s exercise of this discretion should be raised on appeal, 
not mandamus.  Moreover, the failure of the court to enter a 
written order under HPR Rule 20(a) does not divest the court of 
its statutory jurisdiction.   
IT IS ORDERED that the petition for writ of mandamus and 
for writ to stay the sale of property is denied.  
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai‘ i, November 9, 2022.
