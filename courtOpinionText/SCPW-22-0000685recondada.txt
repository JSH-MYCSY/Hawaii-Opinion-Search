IN RE RONALD CARLSON 
________________________________________________________________ 
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION 
(By: Recktenwald , C.J., McKenna, and Eddins, JJ .) 1
 
 Upon consideration of the document filed on May 24, 2023, 
which we construe as a motion for reconsideration, the motion is untimely because it was filed more than ten days after this court’s January 20, 2023 order dismissing the petition.  See 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40(a). 
 Even if the motion were timely, this court has not overlooked or misapprehended points of law or fact.  See HRAP 
Rule 40(b). 
It is ordered that the motion is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai i, May 26, 2023. 
/s/ Mark E. Recktenwald /s/ Sabrina S. McKenna /s/ Todd W. Eddins
