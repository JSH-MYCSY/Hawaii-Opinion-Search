ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(5CCV-22-0000027)  
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.)  
  Upon consideration of the January 28, 2023 letter from 
Cameron and Martha Nice and its supporting documents which, on 
February 3, 2023, was filed with this court as a petition for a 
writ of mandamus, we construe the portion of the Nices’ petition 
directed to this court as a request for interlocutory review of 
the underlying litigation in Mark Malagodi, etc. v. Cameron E. 
Nice, et al., 5CCV-22-0000027 and conclude that the Petitioners 
have failed to demonstrate a right to such review.  We further 
conclude that the record does not support the conclusion that Electronically Filed

  the Respondent Judge has exceeded his jurisdiction, has 
committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has 
refused to act on a subject properly before the court in which 
the judge is subject to a legal duty to act.  See State 
ex rel. 
Kaneshiro v. Huddy, 82  188, 193, 921 P.2d 108, 113 
(1996).  Finally, in such litigation, an alternate remedy 
exists, of appellate review.  Straub Clinic & Hospital v. Kochi, 
81 Hawaiʻ i 410, 414, 917 P.2d 1284, 1288 (1996).  Therefore, Hawaiʼi
  It is ordered that the petition is denied.   DATED:  Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, February 10, 2023.
