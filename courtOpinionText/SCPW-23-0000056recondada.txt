ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
(5CCV-22-0000027)  
 
ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.)  
  Upon consideration of the March 8, 2023 submission 
from Cameron and Martha Nice, and the record in this matter, we 
conclude the submission is, in part, a second motion for 
reconsideration of this court’s February 10, 2023 order, which 
denied their original petition for a writ of mandamus, and is, 
in part, a series of motions for fresh relief, including (1) for 
interlocutory review of a February 23, 2023 hearing in the 
underlying litigation; (2) an order from this court removing Electronically Filed

Dkt. 24 ORD2 
 Judge Valenciano from the underlying litigation and/or requiring 
his recusal; (3) an order directing Judge Valenciano to vacate 
his January 26, 2023 order, which granted withdrawal of the law 
firm which previously had represented the Nices; (4) an order 
directing Judge Valenciano to reschedule a number of hearings to 
accommodate the Nices; (5) an order directing the former firm to 
renew its representation and/or refund monies to the Nices which 
were previously paid; (6) an order directing the Disciplinary 
Board of the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court and the Office of Disciplinary 
Counsel to expedite any investigations of the Nices’ allegations 
of misconduct against a number of attorneys involved in the 
underlying litigation; and (7) the provision of free legal representation and/or consultation.  We further conclude that 
either the requested relief is prohibited by court rule, see 
Rule 40(e) of the Hawaiʻ i Rules of Appellate Procedure, or the 
Nices, in their additional requests for relief, fail to 
establish a clear and indisputable right to relief or that they 
lack other means to adequately redress the alleged wrong, or 
both.  See Straub Clinic & Hospital v. Kochi, 81 Hawaiʻ i 410, 
414, 917 P.2d 1284, 1288 (1996); In re Disciplinary Bd. of 
Hawaiʻi Supreme Court, 91 Hawaiʻ i 363, 368-69, 984 P.2d 688, 693-
94 (1999); Breiner v. Sunderland, 112 Hawaiʻ i 60, 68, 143 P.3d 
1262, 1270 (2006).  Therefore, 3 
  It is ordered that the motions are denied in their 
entirety.
