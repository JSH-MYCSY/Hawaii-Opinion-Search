 I. 
Three law firms petition this court to order a judge to get 
them out of a case.  They argue the Circuit Court of the Third 
Circuit lacks jurisdiction to hale them into Kona - side by side 
with the tobacco companies they long-counseled - in a products 
liability, fraud, and conspiracy suit.   
The circuit court relied on conspiracy jurisdiction to 
invoke jurisdiction.  Not only is that theory of specific personal jurisdiction unconstitutional, the law firms maintain, 
but this court has never endorsed conspiracy jurisdiction.  And 
we shouldn’t now.  But if we did, the court still lacks 
jurisdiction - the pleadings and the evidence produced at a 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss 
were insufficient. 
We adopt conspiracy jurisdiction.  Still, the circuit court 
lacked personal jurisdiction.  The law firms are out. 
II. 
In March 2022, Marvin Manious and Valerie Manious 
(plaintiffs) sued ten defendants: Philip Morris USA Inc. (Philip 
Morris); RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company (Reynolds); Liggett Group 
LLC (Liggett); Shook, Hardy & Bacon L.L.P. (Shook); Covington & 
Burling L.L.P. (Covington); Greenspoon Marder L.L.P.; Womble 
Bond Dickinson (US) L.L.P. (Womble); Foodland Super Market; J. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 Hara Store; and Walmart.  The Maniouses filed their suit in the 
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit. 
Plaintiffs are Hawai ʻi residents.  Marvin Manious has 
laryngeal cancer.  Smoking cigarettes caused his cancer, the 
Maniouses allege.  Those cigarettes were “designed, 
manufactured, advertised, marketed, distributed and/or sold” by 
Defendant R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.  Plaintiffs say Philip 
Morris, Reynolds, and Liggett advertised and marketed cigarettes 
in Hawai ʻi and that Foodland, J. Hara, and Walmart operated 
retail outlets where Marvin Manious bought his cigarettes. 
Plaintiffs brought product liability, fraud, and conspiracy 
claims against the cigarette manufacturers and retailers.  They 
also brought two conspiracy counts specifically against the law 
firms. 
Why sue the law firms?  Plaintiffs allege the cigarette 
companies “utilized” the law firms as in-house and outside 
counsel to “conceal and misrepresent the harms of smoking 
cigarettes, secondhand smoke, . . . and the addictive qualities 
of nicotine.”  Their complaint claims the cigarette companies 
hired the law firms beginning in the 1950s “to assist them in 
their conspiratorial activities which included to conceal and 
misrepresent the harms of smoking and its addictive nature to 
the public.” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 According to Plaintiffs, the law firms “played a central 
role in the creation and perpetuation of the conspiracy and the 
implementation of its fraudulent schemes throughout the United 
States as well as in Hawai ʻi.”  Plaintiffs say that the law firms 
oversaw scientific research, reviewed advertisements, and 
provided false testimony to government agents.  They directed 
their conduct “throughout the United States, including to the 
State of Hawai ʻi.”  
Plaintiffs allege that the law firms orchestrated a 
conspiracy through an association known over time as the 
“Committee of Counsel.”  One count claims that the law firms 
conspired to commit fraudulent concealment:  “As a direct and 
foreseeable result of the law firms’ fraudulent conduct in 
assisting Philip Morris, RJ Reynolds, Liggett and their co-
conspirators conceal the health effects and addictive nature of 
cigarettes, consumers in Hawai ʻi, including Marvin Manious, were 
not aware of the true harms and addictive nature of cigarettes.” 
The complaint alleges in another count that the law firms 
conspired to commit fraudulent misrepresentations.  Factually, 
the complaint’s fraudulent concealment and fraudulent 
misrepresentations counts are mirror images. 
The law firms each moved to dismiss under Hawai ʻi Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 12(b)(2) for “lack of jurisdiction 
over the person.”  They make similar, though not identical, *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
5 
 arguments for dismissal.  They contend that Hawai ʻi courts lack 
general and specific jurisdiction over them.   
Plaintiffs counter that the complaint supports specific 
jurisdiction because it alleges that the law firms were engaged 
in a conspiracy with a goal to maximize the sale of cigarette 
products throughout the United States, including Hawai ʻi.  
Plaintiffs maintain that the law firms conspired with the 
cigarette companies and retailers to specifically target Hawai ʻi 
“with fraudulent advertisements and marketing materials, 
misinformation, and misleading statements.”  
Plaintiffs submitted 49 exhibits, totaling hundreds of 
pages, to back their position that the law firms “conspired with 
others to create a massive fraud that reached into Hawai ʻi.”  And 
for the first time, Plaintiffs introduced conspiracy 
jurisdiction to support the court’s specific personal 
jurisdiction.  
Shook’s reply memorandum points out that watermarks 
populate Plaintiffs’ documents, meaning that “most of 
Plaintiffs’ exhibits come from the searchable Truth Tobacco 
Industry Documents database.”  That database is “[a]n archive of 
14 million documents created by tobacco companies about their 
advertising, manufacturing, marketing, scientific research and 
political activities.”  See *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 https://industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/tobacco/ 
[https://perma.cc/4UB8-HLT2]. 
In October 2022, the circuit court ruled it had 
jurisdiction over three of the law firms (Shook, Covington, and 
Womble).  The court entered pithy orders denying the motions to 
dismiss.  Conspiracy jurisdiction defeated the law firms’ 
12(b)(2) motions.  “The Court finds and concludes that it may 
exercise personal jurisdiction . . . based on conspiracy 
jurisdiction.”  The court did not make minimum contacts findings 
or undertake any due process analysis.   
The court granted without prejudice Greenspoon’s motion to 
dismiss.  Later, Plaintiffs and Greenspoon submitted a joint 
stipulation dismissing that law firm as a defendant with 
prejudice.  The court signed off.  Greenspoon was out.  
The remaining law firms moved for leave to file an 
interlocutory appeal and stay the proceedings.  The court denied 
those motions.  
About one week later, the law firms petitioned this court.  
They request a writ of prohibition enjoining the circuit court 
from exercising personal jurisdiction over them, or 
alternatively for a writ of mandamus ordering dismissal for lack 
of personal jurisdiction.  The law firms urge us to reject 
conspiracy jurisdiction as a way to invoke specific personal 
jurisdiction.  But should we adopt conspiracy jurisdiction, it *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
7 
 does not operate to hale them into the third circuit, they 
maintain.  The law firms’ writ poses two questions: 
1. Does a circuit court violate the Due Process Clause of 
the U.S. Constitution and thus exceed its jurisdiction when 
it purports to exercise personal jurisdiction over a 
defendant based on the “conspiracy theory of personal 
jurisdiction”? 
  
2. Even if the “conspiracy theory of personal jurisdiction” 
were valid under current U.S. Supreme Court precedent, did 
the circuit court exceed its jurisdiction here where it 
purported to exercise personal jurisdiction over the Law 
Firms despite the absence of any evidence that substantial 
steps in furtherance of the conspiracy were taken in 
Hawaiʻi, or that the alleged conspiracy targeted Hawai ʻi? 
  
 We answer question 1 No. 
We answer question 2 Yes.   
III. 
A. 
To bring a defendant to our courts, a plaintiff must 
establish personal jurisdiction.  Courts invoke personal 
jurisdiction through general or specific jurisdiction.  See 
Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915, 
919 (2011). 
The parties agree on one thing.  There is no general 
jurisdiction.   
There’s no place other than home for general jurisdiction.  
A business entity has two home states: its place of 
incorporation and its principal place of business.  BNSF Ry. Co. 
v. Tyrrell, 581 U.S. 402, 413 (2017).  The law firms are not “at *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
8 
 home” in Hawai ʻi.  See Ford Motor Co. v. Montana Eighth Jud. 
Dist. Ct., 141 S. Ct. 1017, 1024 (2021).  Here, Shook is 
incorporated in Missouri, and has its principal place of 
business there.  Covington is incorporated under Delaware law 
and has its principal place of business in the District of 
Columbia.  Womble is incorporated in North Carolina, and has its 
principal place of business there. 
Since the court lacks general jurisdiction, Plaintiffs must 
show specific jurisdiction. 
B. 
 Hawai ʻi courts first consider whether Hawaiʻ i Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 634-35 (2016) allows specific jurisdiction.  
See Yamashita v. LG Chem, Ltd., 152 Hawai ʻi 19, 21, 518 P.3d 
1169, 1171 (2022).  Typically, Hawai ʻi’s long-arm statute is not 
decisive.  Instead, it blends into the due process analysis.  
Id. at 22, 518 P.3d at 1172.  Hawai ʻi law “allows Hawaiʻ i courts 
to invoke personal jurisdiction to the full extent permitted by 
the due process clause.”  Id. at 21, 518 P.3d at 1171.  
Specific jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants is based 
on “minimum contacts.”  International Shoe Co. v. State of Wash. 
Off. of Unemployment Comp. & Placement, 326 U.S. 310, 316 
(1945).  To protect out-of-state actors’ due process rights, 
courts rely on a three-part specific jurisdiction test: (1) the 
nonresident defendant must “purposefully avail[]” itself of the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
9 
 privilege of conducting activities within the forum state; (2) 
plaintiff’s claims “must arise out of or relate to the 
defendant’s contacts” within the forum; and (3) the exercise of 
jurisdiction must “not offend traditional notions of fair play 
and substantial justice.”  Ford Motor Co., 141 S. Ct. at 1024-
25.   
International Shoe still fits.  But Shoe’s well-worn 
standards of “fair play,” “justice,” and “minimum contacts” 
clash with the way courts determined personal jurisdiction in 
the very old days.  See Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 733 
(1877) (holding that courts lack jurisdiction over defendants 
who are not physically present in that state or who have not 
consented to jurisdiction). 
Some justices hint that personal jurisdiction law should 
revert to the 19th century economy’s “tag” rule.  See Ford Motor 
Co., 141 S. Ct. at 1038 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (noting that 
courts could revive the “old ‘tag’ rule” to hale corporations 
into court); Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 143 S. Ct. 2028, 
2040 (2023) (signaling that the original public meaning of 
personal jurisdiction entails the “traditional tag rule” and 
suggesting that a state registration law requiring a corporation 
to consent to jurisdiction operates like that procedure). 
Playing tag would seem to unravel long-arm statutes like 
HRS § 634-35.  A state registration statute may preserve *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
10 
 jurisdiction over corporations conducting business in a state.  
But what about other businesses, shell companies, and 
individuals that do not enter or remain in a forum state?  See 
Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 200 (1977) (“The Pennoyer 
rules generally favored nonresident defendants by making them 
harder to sue.”). 
For now, plaintiffs and defendants are not playing tag like 
it’s 1868.  Today, defendants must have minimum contacts with 
the forum state such that exercising jurisdiction over a 
defendant does not offend traditional notions of fair play and 
substantial justice.   
First, plaintiffs must show purposeful availment. 
Purposeful availment occurs when a defendant purposefully 
directs activities toward the forum, or performs some act to 
invoke the benefits and protections of its laws.  In Interest of 
Doe, 83 Hawai ʻi 367, 374, 926 P.2d 1290, 1297 (1996).  
Plaintiffs allege the law firms “played a central role in 
the creation and perpetuation of the conspiracy and the 
implementation of its fraudulent schemes throughout the United 
States.”  Going nationwide though does not mean a defendant 
purposefully directs conduct at any particular state.  
Nationwide conduct does not blow an unpoppable jurisdictional 
bubble that follows plaintiffs wherever they go.  See J. 
McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873, 885-86 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
11 
 (2011) (explaining that a defendant’s national conduct covering 
all states does not “establish[] that [the defendant] engaged in 
conduct purposefully directed at” any particular state.)  “The 
placement of a product into the stream of commerce, without 
more, is not an act of the defendant purposefully directed 
toward the forum State.”  Asahi Metal Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Super. 
Ct. of California, Solano Cnty., 480 U.S. 102, 112 (1987). 
Plaintiffs’ claims also do not arise out of or relate to 
the law firms’ contacts with Hawai ʻi.  The law firms have no 
state contacts by themselves.  And any indirect contacts are not 
related to the cause of action.  “Relate to” incorporates real 
limits.  See Ford Motor Co., 141 S. Ct. at 1026.   
 The circuit court understood the problem traditional 
specific personal jurisdiction posed to hale the law firms into 
the Third Circuit.  Only conspiracy jurisdiction brought the law 
firms to Kona, the court ruled. 
 Next, we consider conspiracy jurisdiction. 
C. 
Conspiracy jurisdiction is a type of specific jurisdiction.  
It allows a court to invoke jurisdiction over a conspiring out-
of-state defendant.  If a co-conspirator takes sufficient action 
in the forum state, a defendant’s own state contacts are 
immaterial.  The acts of a co-conspirator within a state may *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
12 
 support jurisdiction.  See In re Platinum & Palladium Antitrust 
Litig., 61 F.4th 242, 269 (2d Cir. 2023).   
Commonly, specific personal jurisdiction based on 
conspiracy jurisdiction has three elements: “(1) a conspiracy 
(2) in which the defendant participated and (3) a co-
conspirator’s overt act within the forum, subject to the long-
arm statute and in furtherance of the conspiracy.”  Youming Jin 
v. Ministry of State Sec., 335 F. Supp. 2d 72, 78 (D.D.C. 2004) 
(cleaned up). 
The law firms believe conspiracy jurisdiction violates the 
due process clause.  They say Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.S. 277 
(2014) “undercut the very foundation of conspiracy 
jurisdiction.” 
In Walden, law enforcement officers stopped a man at the 
Atlanta airport.  They seized the man and his money before he 
boarded a flight home to Nevada.  571 U.S. at 279-81.  He sued 
the officers in Nevada, alleging they falsified affidavits to 
justify taking his property.  Id.  One officer (Walden) argued 
the court lacked personal jurisdiction over him since he did not 
have minimum contacts with Nevada.  Id. at 281. 
Walden won.  Minimum contacts focus on the defendant’s 
contacts with the state, not the plaintiff’s contacts.  Id. at 
284.  Walden’s only connection to Nevada was knowledge the 
plaintiff lived there.  The “plaintiff cannot be the only link *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
13 
 between the defendant and the forum.”  Id. at 285 (emphasis 
added).  “The proper question is not where the plaintiff 
experienced a particular injury or effect but whether the 
defendant’s conduct connects [them] to the forum in a meaningful 
way.”  Id. at 290. 
Walden demands a defendant-focused inquiry.  Like Ford 
Motor Co. and other personal jurisdiction cases, Walden fastens 
the inquiry to the defendant’s contacts.  “[I]t is the 
defendant, not the plaintiff or third part[y], who must create 
contacts with the forum State.”  Id. at 291.   
Because of the “third party” language, the law firms argue 
that Walden precludes conspiracy jurisdiction.  True, a 
defendant’s relationship to a third party is insufficient.  
Courts may not exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant 
based only on someone else’s conduct.  Yet Walden says nothing 
about a defendant who participates in a conspiracy that 
substantially targets a forum state – and knows it. 
A co-conspirator isn’t like a third party.  Typically, a 
co-conspirator is a co-defendant.  Co-conspirator relationships 
do not resemble a defendant’s singular relationship with a 
plaintiff or a third party.  A conspiracy needs conspirators.  
Co-conspirators join forces to achieve an objective.  One co-
conspirator may commit overt acts in a state, while another co-
conspirator may not.  “In a conspiracy, an individual’s actions *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
14 
 in furtherance of the conspiracy are not unilateral because 
conspiratorial acts have at their foundation an agreement and 
the involvement of other co-conspirators.”  Santa Fe Techs., 
Inc. v. Argus Networks, Inc., 42 P.3d 1221, 1234 (N.M. Ct. App. 
2001). 
Co-conspirators resemble agents more than third parties.  
“[B]ecause a conspiracy is a type of agency relationship, an act 
taken during the course of a conspiracy relationship may lead to 
specific personal jurisdiction over a defendant.”  Raser Techs., 
Inc., by & through Houston Phoenix Grp., LLC v. Morgan Stanley & 
Co., LLC, 449 P.3d 150, 167-68 (Utah 2019).  “[C]ivil co-
conspirators, like criminal co-conspirators, act as agents of 
one other when engaging in acts in furtherance of their 
conspiracy.”  Mackey v. Compass Mktg., Inc., 892 A.2d 479, 495 
(Md. 2006).  
Comparing co-conspirators to agents is mistaken, the law 
firms contend.  Defendants control agents, not necessarily their 
co-conspirators.  We do not believe this distinction makes 
agency irrelevant to conspiracy jurisdiction.  Walden recognized 
that an agent’s in-state acts operate as a “relevant contact” 
for due process purposes.  And an agent’s acts are within the 
reach of Hawai ʻi’s long-arm statute.  See HRS § 634-35 (reaches 
those who act “in person or through an agent.”).  While *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
15 
 conspiracy and agency relationships are not exactly the same, 
they are closely related. 
So no, Walden doesn’t doom conspiracy jurisdiction.  
Rather, it keeps the jurisdictional analysis focused on what a 
defendant knew and did.   
Post-Walden cases endorse conspiracy jurisdiction.  For 
instance, in Nevada, the court parsed Walden and decided that 
conspiracy jurisdiction provides a basis for personal 
jurisdiction if the conspirators reasonably expect their actions 
to have consequences in the forum state.  Tricarichi v. Coop. 
Rabobank, U.A., 440 P.3d 645, 653 (Nev. 2019).  Utah also 
adopted conspiracy jurisdiction where “the defendant could have 
reasonably anticipated being subject to jurisdiction in the 
forum state because of [their] participation in the conspiracy.”  
Raser Techs., 449 P.3d at 170.  And Tennessee reinforced its 
pre-Walden position that conspiracy jurisdiction is a basis for 
specific jurisdiction.  See First Cmty. Bank, N.A. v. First 
Tennessee Bank, N.A., 489 S.W.3d 369, 395 (Tenn. 2015).  
After Walden, the Second Circuit kept conspiracy 
jurisdiction.  The Supreme Court, it observed, has not 
“delineated when one conspirator’s minimum contacts allow for 
personal jurisdiction over a co-conspirator.”  Charles Schwab 
Corp. v. Bank of America Corp., 883 F.3d 68, 86 (2d Cir. 2018). 
Plaintiffs satisfy due process if “(1) a conspiracy existed; (2) *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
16 
 the defendant participated in the conspiracy; and (3) a co-
conspirator’s overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy had 
sufficient contacts with a state to subject that co-conspirator 
to jurisdiction in that state.”  Id. at 87. 
We hold that conspiracy jurisdiction satisfies due process 
principles when Plaintiffs plead, or upon challenge show, the 
defendant’s knowledge or awareness of a co-conspirator’s acts 
within the jurisdiction.  EIG Energy Fund XIV, L.P. v. Petróleo 
Brasileiro S.A., 246 F. Supp. 3d 52, 90 (D.D.C. 2017), aff’d, 
894 F.3d 339 (D.C. Cir. 2018). 
We endorse EIG’s approach.  To establish conspiracy 
jurisdiction, a plaintiff must plead with particularity, or upon 
challenge show, the conspiracy as well as the overt acts within 
the forum taken in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Id.  At a 
minimum, a plaintiff must show that the defendant knew their co-
conspirator was carrying out acts in furtherance of the 
conspiracy in the forum.  Id. at 91.  
Because of its defendant-centered focus, we believe a 
pleading and proof standard that requires the defendant’s 
knowledge of a co-conspirator’s overt acts in the forum state 
squares with precedent.  If a plaintiff shows that the defendant 
knew a co-conspirator was carrying out acts in furtherance of 
the conspiracy in the forum, then conspiracy jurisdiction 
satisfies federal due process.  Thus, we adopt conspiracy *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
17 
 jurisdiction with a knowledge requirement.  A plaintiff must: 
(1) allege that the defendant knew of the co-conspirator’s acts 
in the forum; and (2) plead with particularity, or upon 
challenge show, the conspiracy as well as the overt acts within 
the forum taken in furtherance of the conspiracy.   
D. 
We hold that Hawai ʻi courts have jurisdiction to hear cases 
involving out-of-state defendants engaged in conspiracies that 
directly target our state.  
Conspiracy jurisdiction allows a Hawai ʻi plaintiff to sue a 
conspiring, but far flung, defendant here.  It keeps our court 
doors open to those who allege international, national, and 
other conspiracies directed at Hawai ʻi.  It aligns with our 
state’s spirit of access to justice.  Hawai ʻi courts should not 
shut to plaintiffs who properly allege a conspiracy where at 
least one defendant took substantial action in our state and the 
other defendants knew about it. 
Sometimes, conspiracy jurisdiction may be the only way to 
establish jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants engaged in 
widespread conspiracies targeting a particular state.   
Courts have invoked conspiracy jurisdiction to cover 
fraudulent schemes and scams.  Plaintiffs have used it to sue 
banks for conspiracy to price fix.  See, e.g., Schwab Short-Term 
Bond Mkt. Fund v. Lloyds Banking Grp. PLC, 22 F.4th 103, 123 (2d *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
18 
 Cir. 2021), cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. 2852 (2022).  And in Ponzi 
schemes.  See, e.g., Palumbo v. New Direction IRA, Inc., No. 
6:19-cv-235 (GLS/TWD), 2020 WL 5045158, at *3 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 
2020).  Multi-state loan scams, too.  See Galloway v. 
Martorello, No. 3:19-cv-314, 2023 WL 5183204, at *10 (E.D. Va. 
Aug. 11, 2023).  Courts have also invoked conspiracy 
jurisdiction in multi-defendant tobacco litigation cases.  See, 
e.g., Simon v. Philip Morris, Inc., 86 F. Supp. 2d 95, 120–21 
(E.D.N.Y. 2000) (collecting cases). 
Plaintiffs can recover damages from defendants who conspire 
to commit fraudulent acts in a forum state.  If a person or 
company conspires to do unlawful things in Hawai ʻi and knows a 
co-conspirator is taking substantial steps here to advance those 
conspiratorial aims, then we believe our courts may invoke 
personal jurisdiction.   
E. 
Though we adopt conspiracy jurisdiction, the law firms win.  
The allegations against them, and the evidence offered by 
Plaintiffs at the HRCP Rule 12(b)(2) motion, fail to establish 
conspiracy jurisdiction.   
Conspiracy jurisdiction does not mean anything goes.  
“[B]ald speculation” or “conclusionary statement[s]” do not 
establish conspiracy jurisdiction.  See Naartex Consulting Corp. 
v. Watt, 722 F.2d 779, 787 (D.C. Cir. 1983).   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
19 
 Unlike the claims against the tobacco companies and 
retailers, Plaintiffs do not allege in the complaint that the 
law firms had any direct contacts in Hawai ʻi.  Rather, the 
complaint alleges the law firms puppet-mastered a conspiracy 
from afar.   
Plaintiffs say that starting in the 1950s, the law firms 
conspired with the cigarette manufacturers “to conceal the 
health effects and addictive nature of smoking cigarettes” with 
the “ultimate goal” of maximizing their clients’ “sale of 
cigarette products throughout the United States.”  The complaint 
alleges that the law firms controlled research conducted by the 
manufacturers to prevent negative research from being published 
about cigarettes, “misdirected” efforts to focus on other causes 
of smoking-related diseases, identified and established 
relationships with “friendly” scientific witnesses, and engaged 
in document destruction and hiding of “negative industry 
documents behind the guise of work product privilege.”  
Plaintiffs level rangy accusations.  But nowhere do they 
claim the law firms knew of overt acts by co-conspirators 
specifically targeting Hawai ʻi, rather than the United States as 
a whole.  And the allegations, for instance the claim that the 
law firms were “engaged in a fraud directed nationally and at 
the State of Hawai ʻi,” are conclusory.  See American Land 
Program, Inc. v. Bonaventura Uitgevers Maatschappij, N.V., 710 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
20 
 F.2d 1449, 1454 (10th Cir. 1983) (“Mere allegations of 
conspiracy, without some sort of prima facie factual showing of 
a conspiracy, cannot be the basis of personal jurisdiction of 
co-conspirators outside the territorial limits of the court.”) 
(cleaned up). 
An HRCP Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss challenges a 
court’s jurisdiction over a defendant.  Plaintiffs have the 
burden to establish personal jurisdiction.  Unlike Rule 12(b)(1) 
and 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, the court does not have to 
accept a complaint’s allegations as true.  To counter a Rule 
12(b)(2) motion, Plaintiffs may present specific and relevant 
evidence that connects the defendant with Hawai ʻi.  See Shaw v. 
N. Am. Title Co., 76 Hawai ʻi 323, 327, 876 P.2d 1291, 1295 (1994) 
(plaintiffs must make a “prima facie showing of jurisdiction 
through [their] own affidavits and supporting materials”).  The 
court resolves any factual variances to favor the exercise of 
specific personal jurisdiction.  Id. 
Plaintiffs opposed the law firms’ Rule 12(b)(2) motions to 
dismiss.  Plaintiffs claimed that the firms had direct contacts 
with Hawai ʻi.  They devised fraudulent messages that spread 
through various print, radio, and broadcast media in Hawai ʻi.  
Plaintiffs submitted scattered exhibits.  Some extend to the 
1950s.  Few mention the law firms.  All fail to establish a 
sufficient connection between the law firms and Hawai ʻi.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
21 
 The exhibits occasionally mention the law firms.  For 
instance, exhibit A lists individuals who comprised the tobacco 
institute “Committee of Counsel.”  However, a document that 
namedrops the law firms or their attorneys offers no connection 
between the law firms and Hawaiʻ i.   
Some exhibits mention Hawaiʻ i.  Exhibit M is a 1980 
advertisement.  The small text reads in part: “C’mon up to KOOL, 
Hawaii’s #1 cigarette family. . . .  Right in step with Hawaii’s 
cool taste.” 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
22 
 Plaintiffs think the KOOL ad aids them.  It shows marketing 
in Hawaiʻ i.  But there’s no link to the law firms.  Nothing 
indicates that any law firm shaped the advertisement’s 
messaging, or otherwise knew that ads like this were run in 
Hawaiʻi.  
Plaintiffs also provide a few exhibits about a research 
proposal at the University of Hawaiʻ i looking at “a possible 
heredity factor in the tobacco smoking habit.”  Some documents 
include Shook meeting agendas that note the study.  Sure, Shook 
paid attention to the study.  But nothing shows that Shook had 
anything to do with the study, its funding, or that Shook took 
any action at all directed at Hawaiʻ i. 
We conclude Plaintiffs fail to establish personal 
jurisdiction.  Their smattering of documents fail to show the 
law firms knew of a co-conspirator’s targeted acts in the forum.  
The evidence presented to parry the jurisdictional attack does 
not demonstrate that the law firms conspired to direct 
fraudulent messages at Hawaiʻ i.  
The third circuit did not properly exercise personal 
jurisdiction over the law firms.  Plaintiffs plead no facts, and 
offer no evidence, to show the law firms knew a co-conspirator’s 
actions expressly targeted Hawaiʻ i.  See Cengiz v. Salman, No. 
20-3009 (JDB), 2022 WL 17475400, at *11 (D.D.C. Dec. 6, 2022).   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 Courts do not have to accept inferences from plaintiffs that are 
unsupported by the facts.  Livnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 
45, 57 (D.C. Cir. 2017).   
Representing a client is not enough.  Absent allegations 
that a law firm operates in Hawai ʻi or that the firm knows of a 
co-conspirator’s overt acts in Hawai ʻi to advance the conspiracy, 
a plaintiff’s claim against a law firm is just an allegation 
about “out-of-state activity by out-of-state actors.”  Page v. 
Democratic Nat’l Comm., No. 20 C 671, 2020 WL 8125551, at *4 
(N.D. Ill. Aug. 17, 2020).  A lawyer and client may be co-
conspirators.  See Breaking Bad: Better Call Saul (AMC 
television broadcast Apr. 26, 2009).  But not here.   
F. 
Next, we conclude that jurisdictional discovery is 
undeserved.  Plaintiffs neither ask for jurisdictional 
discovery, nor dispute the law firms’ argument that it’s not 
warranted.  “Jurisdictional discovery is only appropriate where 
the party seeking such discovery provides some specific 
indication regarding what facts additional discovery could 
produce that would affect the court’s jurisdictional analysis.”  
EIG Energy Fund, 246 F. Supp. 3d at 92 (cleaned up); see also 
Coal. for Mercury–Free Drugs v. Sebelius, 725 F. Supp. 2d 1, 5 
(D.D.C. 2010), aff’d, 671 F.3d 1275 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (no *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
24 
 jurisdictional discovery when plaintiffs’ request was not 
“narrowly tailored” to produce relevant information). 
G. 
Extraordinary writs are appropriate in extraordinary 
circumstances.  Exceeding jurisdiction, committing a “flagrant 
and manifest abuse of discretion,” or “refus[ing] to act on a 
subject properly before the court under circumstances in which 
it has a legal duty to act,” are court actions and inaction that 
may constitute extraordinary circumstances to issue a writ.  
Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawai ʻi 200, 205, 982 P.2d 334, 339 (1999).   
A petitioner must “demonstrate[] a clear and indisputable 
right to the relief requested and a lack of other means to 
redress adequately the alleged wrong or to obtain the requested 
action.”  Id. at 204, 982 P2d at 338.  These conditions operate 
to preserve a case’s usual progression.  
A rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss is not an infrequent 
filing.  But it rarely results in a writ.  The clear and 
indisputable right to relief and normal appellate process 
requirements typically push a jurisdictional challenge outside a 
writ’s ambit.  Pre-final judgment, this court has hardly ever 
taken jurisdiction over a case where a party wants to writ the 
trial court because it believes the court has exceeded its 
jurisdiction.  Indeed, the parties only cite two early-statehood 
cases covering jurisdictionally-inspired writs.  See e.g., *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
25 
 Victory Carriers, Inc. v. Hawkins, 44 Haw. 250, 254, 352 P.2d 
314, 317 (1960) (explaining that “if it appears from the record 
that the trial court is without jurisdiction over the person of 
the defendant and relator, prohibition will lie to prevent the 
court from further proceeding in the action.”); Atlas Elevator 
Co. v. Presiding Judge of Cir. Ct. of First Cir., 49 Haw. 129, 
412 P.2d 645 (1966).   
Until now, this court has not considered conspiracy 
jurisdiction.  Because the law firms’ petition advanced a new 
and extraordinary situation, we accepted it. 
We hold that the circuit court clearly and indisputably 
exercised jurisdiction beyond its authority and there were no 
other means for the law firms to adequately address the alleged 
wrong or to obtain dismissal.   
The firms are entitled to relief.  A contrary ruling would 
subject the law firms to the very due process violations that 
settled personal jurisdiction law aspires to avoid.  See Atlas, 
49 Haw. at 144, 412 P.2d at 655. 
Plaintiffs may still sue the law firms, just not in Hawai ʻi.  
Perhaps Plaintiffs will successfully show that the law firms 
“stopped being counsel and became co-conspirators” and that they 
“were instrumental in carrying out the conspiracy to 
misrepresent the health effects and addictive nature of smoking *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 cigarettes.”  But that’s a question for a court that has 
personal jurisdiction over the law firms.  
IV. 
  The court grants the law firms’ writ of prohibition.  We 
direct the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit to dismiss with 
prejudice the law firms as defendants.
