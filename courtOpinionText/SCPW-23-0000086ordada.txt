Dkt. 98 ODDP2 
 See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawaiʻ i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 
(1999).   
 In the Petition, Petitioner challenged the circuit court’s 
decision to uphold a claim of attorney-client privilege, the circuit court’s subsequent refusal to reconsider this decision, and the Respondent Judge’s refusal to recuse. 
Here, Petitioner is a party to the underlying foreclosure 
and by timely appeal may raise these grievances.  See Hawaiʻ i 
Revised Statutes § 667-51(a)(1); Bank of Am., N.A. v. Reyes-
Toledo, 139 Hawaiʻ i 361, 372, 390 P.3d 1248, 1259 (2017); see 
also Anastasi v. Fid. Nat. Title Ins. Co., 137 Hawaiʻ i 104, 106, 
366 P.3d 160, 162 (2016) (reviewing an order that upheld the 
attorney-client privilege); Cho v. State, 115 Hawaiʻ i 373, 384-
386, 168 P.3d 17, 28-30 (2007) (reviewing order on motion for reconsideration); Jou v. Dai-Tokyo Royal State Ins. Co., 116 
Hawaiʻi 159, 165, 172 P.3d 471, 477 (2007) (reviewing an order 
related to recusal).  We find that mandamus to address these 
grievances is not warranted because “[s]uch writs are not meant 
to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the lower 
court, nor are they meant to serve as legal remedies in lieu of 
normal appellate procedures.”  Kema, 91 Hawaiʻ i at 204, 982 P.2d 
at 338.    3 
 We turn now to the Petitioner’s contention that the 
Respondent Judge has failed to rule on a motion for 
reconsideration of a discovery order that upheld, in part, the claim of attorney-client privilege.  We are not persuaded that 
the circumstances raised in the Petition established that the 
circuit court “committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of 
discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before 
the court under circumstances in which it has a legal duty to 
act.”  Id. at 205, 982 P.2d at 339.   
“Generally, in the absence of an extreme, compelling 
situation, a trial court that has jurisdiction over an action 
lacks authority to refuse to consider a litigant’s motions.”  56 
Am. Jur. 2d Motions, Rules, and Orders § 38 (2023); see also In 
re Sch. Asbestos Litig., 977 F.2d 764, 793-795 (3d Cir. 1992) 
(discussing when a federal district court may refuse to consider 
a motion for summary judgment).  But counterposed is the “general proposition, [that] a party is prohibited from filing 
repetitive motions for the same relief, or asserting the same basis[.]”  56 Am. Jur. 2d Motions, Rules, and Orders § 5 (2023) (footnote omitted). 
Here, the circuit court did address and resolve, by order, 
the discovery dispute between the parties.  In response to a motion to compel, the circuit court reviewed records in camera that the party withheld under a claim of attorney-client 4 
 privilege, and entered an order that upheld the privilege, in 
part.  Petitioner was not satisfied with the circuit court’s decision to uphold the privilege and filed multiple successive motions which, in substance, moved the circuit court to 
reconsider its prior decision on discovery. 
 Next, the circuit court addressed and resolved Petitioner’s first motion for reconsideration, styled a “motion to clarify,” and then later resolved Petitioner’s “third motion to compel” that sought similar relief.  Both of these motions filed by Petitioner had sought, in substance, reconsideration of the circuit court’s decision to uphold the privilege.  While the circuit court entered at least two orders denying the requested 
relief, the Respondent Judge failed to enter an order disposing 
of Petitioner’s non-hearing motion filed on April 13, 2020 (Subject Motion).  In the Subject Motion, the Petitioner again sought reconsideration of the circuit court’s decision to uphold the privilege.  Yet because the decision to consider the Subject Motion, which was a repeat motion for reconsideration of a discovery order, was committed to the discretion of the circuit court, it cannot be said that Petitioner’s right to have the 
Respondent Judge resolve the Subject Motion is “clear and 
indisputable.”  See Kema, 91 Hawaiʻ i at 204, 982 P.2d at 338.   
The Petition made several other requests for relief, none 
of which we find warrant further review by mandamus.  In sum, 5 
 none of the arguments made by Petitioner support the issuance of 
the requested writ.  In so holding, we do not decide any question as to the merits.   
The burden was on Petitioner to establish the extraordinary 
circumstances to warrant mandamus.  We find that Petitioner 
failed to carry this burden.  See Hawaiʻ i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure, Rule 21(c) (“If the court is of the opinion that the 
writ should not be entertained, it shall deny the petition.”).  Petitioner’s grievances may be pursued by appeal, rather than by resort to this court’s original jurisdiction for extraordinary writs. 
It is hereby ordered that the Petition is denied.
