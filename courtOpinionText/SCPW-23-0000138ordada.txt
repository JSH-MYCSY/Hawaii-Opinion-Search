ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Wilson, and Eddins, JJ.)  
 
Upon consideration of petitioner’s letter dated November 
26, 2021 that was received by the court on November 30, 2022, 
which was filed as a petition for writ of mandamus on March 16, 
2023, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support 
thereof, and the record, it appears that petitioner is not 
entitled to the requested extraordinary relief from this court.  
See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawaiʻi 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) 
(a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a clear and 
indisputable right to relief and a lack of alternative means to 
redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested 
action; a writ of mandamus is not intended to supersede the Electronically Filed
