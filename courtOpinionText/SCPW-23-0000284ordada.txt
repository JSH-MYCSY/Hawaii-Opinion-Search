IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI‘ I 
 
 
IN RE JULIE SMITH 
 
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Eddins, JJ., 
Circuit Judge Somerville and Circuit Judge Morikawa, 
appointed by reason of vacancies) 
 
 Upon consideration of the April 11, 2023 submission by 
Julie Smith and its supporting documents, filed with this court
as a petition for a writ of mandamus, we conclude, with regard 
to the claims asserted against all parties, that Smith has 
failed to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief 
from this court, or the lack of an alternate remedy, or both.   
See Straub Clinic & Hosp. v. Kochi, 81  410, 414, 917 P.2d Hawaiʼi
1284, 1288 (1996).  With regard to the Petitioner’s complaint 
against the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC), we conclude 
Smith failed to demonstrate that ODC has abused its discretion.  Electronically Filed
