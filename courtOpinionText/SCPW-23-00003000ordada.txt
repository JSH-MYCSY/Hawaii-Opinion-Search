JASON FLETCHER, Petitioner, 
 
vs. 
 
The Honorable CATHERINE H. REMIGIO, Judge of the Circuit Court 
of the First Circuit, State of Hawaiʻ i, Respondent Judge,

STATE OF HAWAI
ʻI, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 1CPC-21-0001352) 
  
 ORDER DENYING PETITION 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, and Eddins, JJ., 
Circuit Court Judge Cataldo and Circuit Court Judge Kawashima
assigned by reason of vacancies) 
Upon consideration of petitioner Jason Fletcher’s 
letters filed April 21, 2023 at Docket 1 and Docket 2 under 
seal, which were filed as a petition, the documents attached 
thereto and submitted in support thereof (collectively referred 
to herein as “the petition”), and the record, we find that  
   
 
 
 Fletcher has alternative means in the circuit court under Hawaiʻ i 
Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 to address the alleged 
wrong or obtain the requested action. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 
Hawaiʻi 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999); Oili v. Chang, 57 
Haw. 411, 412, 557 P.2d 787, 788 (1976). 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: 
1. The petition is denied without prejudice; 
2. The clerk of the appellate court shall process the 
petition without payment of the filing fee; 
3. With respect to the sealed court filings at Docket 1 
and Docket 2, the appellate clerk shall file a redacted version of these documents on the public record by redacting the social 
security numbers and dates of birth in conformance with the 
definition of “Personal Information” in Rule 2.19 of the Hawaiʻ i 
Court Records Rules, and by redacting the Presentence Diagnosis 
and Report that appears at Docket 2, pages 27 through 30. The 
clerk shall file the redacted versions of Docket 1 and Docket 2 
on the record in this case as new filings, and Docket 1 and Docket 2 shall remain sealed as they contain the confidential 
personal information of the Petitioner, including his social 
security number, date of birth, and “non-conviction data” as 
defined by Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes § 846-1. Any individual may 
file a motion objecting to the sealing of these documents; 
2  
  
 
  
 
       
 4. The appellate clerk shall transmit the sealed and 
redacted versions of the petition to the first circuit court for 
filing under HRPP Rule 40; and 
5. In response to Fletcher’s request to initiate a formal 
complaint about his attorney, the appellate clerk shall transmit 
a copy of the petition to the Office of the Disciplinary Counsel 
(ODC) for such action as the ODC deems appropriate, with a copy 
transmitted to Fletcher’s last known address at Saguaro Correctional Center, 1250 East Arica Road, Eloy, Arizona 85131. 
Dated: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, June 26, 2023.
