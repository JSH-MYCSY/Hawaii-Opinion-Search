Dkt. 5 ODDP2 
 To that end, this court does not have authority to issue a 
writ of prohibition directed to a public official.  See HRS 
§ 602-5(a)(3) (2016) (“(a) Except as otherwise provided, the 
supreme court shall have jurisdiction and powers as 
follows: . . . (3) To exercise original jurisdiction . . . if 
the supreme court consents to receive the case arising under writs of mandamus directed to public officers to compel them to 
fulfill the duties of their offices[.]” (Emphases added)); 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 21(b) (2023) (writs of 
mandamus directed to a public officer).  
Instead: “Mandamus relief is available to compel an 
official to perform a duty allegedly owed to an individual only if the individual’s claim is clear and certain, the official’s duty is ministerial and so plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt, and no other remedy is available.”  Barnett v. Broderick, 
84 Hawaiʻ i 109, 111, 929 P.2d 1359, 1361 (1996).  
A duty is ministerial if the law prescribes and defines the 
duty to be performed with such precision and certainty as to 
leave nothing to the exercise of discretion and judgment.  
Salling v. Moon, 76 Hawaiʻ i 273, 274 n.3, 874 P.2d 1098, 1099 n.3 
(1994). 
Here, Petitioner has not demonstrated a duty that the HPA 
must be compelled to perform, and that the identified duty is 
defined with such precision and certainty as to leave nothing to 3 
 the exercise of discretion and judgment.  Petitioner instead 
asserts that the HPA is prohibited or should be prevented from holding a sex offender determination hearing. 
It is ordered that the petition is denied.
