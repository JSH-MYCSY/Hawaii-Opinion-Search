IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI‘ I 
 
 
IN RE CELESTE M. GONSALVES 
 
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(1DRC-21-0001879; 1DRC-21-0002121) 
 
ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, and Eddins, JJ.,
Circuit Judge Malinao and Circuit Judge Park, 
assigned by reason of vacancies)  
 
 Upon consideration of petitioner Celeste M. Gonsalves’s 
“Original jurisdiction application for emergency relief of 
denial of ADA reasonable accommodations” filed May 8, 2023 (Petition), the supplemental memorandum, filed on July 11, 2023, 
and the record, we conclude the writ requested by the petitioner 
is not warranted. 
 In the Petition, the petitioner alleges, in pertinent part, 
that the district court judges committed error in their handling 
of the following district court cases: Stuart Glauberman and 
Vicky Ramil v. Celeste M. Gonsalves, 1DRC-21-0001879 and Stuart Electronically Filed

Dkt. 10 ORD2 
 B. Glauberman, by his Managing Agent, KFG Properties, Inc. v. 
Celeste M. Gonsalves, 1DRC-21-0002121.  The specific relief 
requested by the petition, in pertinent part, is for this court 
to “vacate all rulings” entered in these cases and to “remand 
these cases back to district court to be scheduled for a new 
trial for damages and motions hearings.”  
To justify the issuance of a writ of mandamus or 
prohibition the burden is on petitioner to establish a clear and indisputable right to the relief requested and a lack of other 
means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or to obtain the 
requested action.  Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawaiʻ i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 
334, 338 (1999).  Petitioner failed to carry this burden. 
Here, the Petition alleges that petitioner “filed appeals 
in both cases” and references CAAP-21-0000536 and CAAP-21-
0000545.  The Petition further states, in pertinent part, “If I 
cannot be afforded relief . . . then I will begin the process of 
an Appeal[.]”  A writ of mandamus, however, is not intended to serve as a legal remedy “in lieu of normal appellate 
procedures.”  See Kema, 91 Hawaiʻ i at 204, 982 P.2d at 338.  The 
petitioner has therefore failed to establish the lack of other 
means to obtain the requested action.  
To the extent the petitioner alleges misconduct on the part 
of district court judges, we note that the appropriate forum for such complaints is the Commission on Judicial Conduct.  3 
 Finally, we note that Dockets 1, 2, and 3 were initially 
sealed by the appellate clerk at the request of the petitioner, 
in accordance with Rule 3.3 of the Hawaiʻ i Court Records Rules, 
which provides, in pertinent part, that “[t]he Clerk may 
temporarily seal any document or record . . . pending review and 
a determination” of accessibility by the court.  See also Oahu 
Publ’ns Inc. v. Takase, 139 Hawaiʻ i 236, 247-48, 386 P.3d 873, 
884-85 (2016).   
We find that Docket 1 includes medical and health records, 
as well as references throughout the document to the 
petitioner’s health and medical information and/or the health 
and medical information of petitioner’s family, and conclude 
that these records may remain sealed.  See, e.g., Pac. Radiation 
Oncology, LLC v. Queen’s Med. Ctr., 138 Hawaiʻ i 14, 19, 375 P.3d 
1252, 1257 (2016) (discussing the constitutional right to 
privacy).  However, any individual may file a motion objecting 
to the sealing of Docket 1.  Grube v. Trader, 142 Hawaiʻ i 412, 
423, 420 P.3d 343, 354 (2018); Oahu Publ’ns Inc. v. Ahn, 133 
Hawaiʻi 482, 507, 331 P.3d 460, 485 (2014).  We further note that 
it is possible for petitioner to file a redacted version of 
Docket 1 on the public record in this case, and do not foreclose 
this alternative in the event an objection is filed to challenge 
the complete sealing of Docket 1.  See Grube, 142 Hawaiʻ i at 424, 
420 P.3d at 355.   4    /s/ Mark E. Recktenwald 
   /s/ Sabrina S. McKenna    /s/ Todd W. Eddins    /s/ Clarissa Y. Malinao    /s/ Shanlyn A.S. Park 
 As to Docket 2, the Petitioner herself asserts that the 
information contained at pages 2-3, being a Judicial Retention 
Evaluation Form, is confidential, and we concur, based upon Rule 
5 Section 2.A of the Judicial Selection Commission Rules. 
Finally, as to Docket 3, the document contains a reference 
to medical information that should be redacted.  See Pac. 
Radiation Oncology, 138 Hawaiʻ i at 19, 375 P.3d at 1257.  
Therefore, 
It is ordered that the clerk of the appellate court shall 
process the petition without payment of the filing fee. 
It is further ordered that the clerk of the court shall 
file public versions of Dockets 2 and 3, redacted consistent with this order. 
It is further ordered that the petition is denied. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, August 3, 2023.
