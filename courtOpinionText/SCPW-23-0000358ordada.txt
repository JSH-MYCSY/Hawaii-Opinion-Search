ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR EXTRAORDINARY WRIT 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, and Eddins, JJ.,  
Circuit Judge Watanabe and Circuit Judge Kawano, 
assigned by reason of vacancies) 
 
 This court denied Petitioner’s May 24, 2023 petition for 
writ of habeas corpus by order filed on July 5, 2023.  On July 
21, 2023, Petitioner filed an “Application for Extraordinary 
Writ” on the same basis as the May 24, 2023 petition for writ of Electronically Filed

 habeas corpus, except Petitioner requests that the extraordinary 
writ be granted by the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA).   
The ICA does not have jurisdiction to consider a request 
for an extraordinary writ.  See 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 602-57 (2016).  It is this court that has jurisdiction to consider such a request.  HRS § 602-5(a)(3) (2016). 
Upon consideration of the “Application for Extraordinary 
Writ” filed on July 21, 2023, and the record, Petitioner’s 
request for an extraordinary writ is denied because an 
extraordinary writ is not meant to be used to supersede a 
circuit court judge’s discretionary authority.  See Kema v. 
Gaddis, 91 Hawaiʻ i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999). 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai i, August 14, 2023.
