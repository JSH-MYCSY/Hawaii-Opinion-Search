 establish a “clear and indisputable right to the relief requested and a lack of other means to redress adequately the 
alleged wrong or to obtain the requested action.”  See Kema v. 
Gaddis, 91 Hawaiʻ i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999).   
 Here, Petitioners are defendants to the foreclosure 
complaint in civil number 1CCV-22-0001614 and may raise and 
establish their defenses in that proceeding and, if necessary, 
may appeal.  See Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes § 667-51(a)(1).  We 
find that mandamus to address the question raised in the 
Petition is, thus, not warranted because “[s]uch writs are not 
meant to supersede the legal discretionary authority of the 
lower court, nor are they meant to serve as legal remedies in 
lieu of normal appellate procedures.”  Kema, 91 Hawaiʻ i at 204, 
982 P.2d at 338. 
It is ordered that the Petition is denied. 
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, August 10, 2023.
