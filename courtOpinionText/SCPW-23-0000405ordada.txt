Dkt. 36 ODDP2 
      
In the underlying civil case, the circuit court granted a 
renewed motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and 
then denied Petitioners’ motion for reconsideration of this 
decision.  Petitioners seek further review of the merits of the 
circuit court’s decisions through this original proceeding.  
But an extraordinary writ is not meant to be used to 
interfere with or control the exercise of the circuit court’s 
discretion, and it is within the circuit court’s discretion to grant or deny a motion that is pending before it.  Kema v. 
Gaddis, 91 Hawaiʻ i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39 (1999). 
The petition also claims that Petitioners have no 
alternative means “adequate” to seek relief and requests an expedited decision from this court.  But after the circuit court 
denied Petitioners’ motion for reconsideration, Petitioners 
filed a motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal on 
August 3, 2023.  Petitioners’ motion for leave to file an 
interlocutory appeal was filed about six weeks after filing the 
subject petition for a writ of mandamus.   
An extraordinary writ is also not meant to be used to 
sidestep normal appellate procedures merely because a party wants a speedy decision from this court.  See id. 3 
 Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of mandamus 
filed on June 21, 2023, and the record, it is ordered that the 
petition is denied.
