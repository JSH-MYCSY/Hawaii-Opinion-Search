and

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(5DTP-22-009571) 
 
ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, and Eddins, JJ., 
Circuit Judge Park and Circuit Judge Kawashima, 
assigned by reason of vacancies) 
 
 Upon consideration of the June 30, 2023 submission by 
Petitioner Dorothy Kulik, the exhibits attached thereto, the 
July 31, 2023 motion for injunctive relief and appointment of a Electronically Filed
Supreme Court

Dkt. 34 ORD2 
 special master, the declaration and exhibits appended thereto, 
the August 28, 2023 First Supplemental Declaration, the 
documents filed in this case on September 6, 2023, and the 
record in this matter and in State v. Dorothy Kulik, 5DTP-22-
009571, we conclude the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate 
that the district court exceeded its jurisdiction, committed a 
flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or refused to act on 
a subject properly before it, in which the court was subject to a legal duty to act (see State ex rel. Kaneshiro v. Huddy, 82 
Hawaiʻi 188, 193, 921 P.2d 108, 113 (1996)), or that she lacks 
alternate remedies.  We also conclude, with regard to the Commission on Judicial Conduct and the county and state entities identified by Petitioner in the June 30, 2023 filing, that the 
Petitioner has similarly failed to establish a clear and 
indisputable right to relief and the lack of other means to 
redress the alleged wrong or obtain the requested action (see 
Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawaiʻ i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999)).  
Finally, we find and conclude that allowing the Petitioner to 
proceed in forma pauperis is warranted by the submitted 
materials.  Therefore, 
 It is ordered that the motion to proceed in forma pauperis is granted.  The clerk shall waive the filing fee for the 
petition. 3 
  It is further ordered that the petition, and all other 
requests for relief set forth in the June 30, 2023, July 31, 
2023, August 28, 2023, and September 6, 2023 filings, are 
denied.
