  /s/ Todd W. Eddins 
  /s/ Shanlyn A.S. Park 
  /s/ James S. Kawashima 
 this court, which denied Kulik’s petition and subsequent 
Declarations, we deem the October 2, 2023 submission a motion 
for reconsideration, timely submitted pursuant to Rule 40 of the
Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure.  Upon review, we conclude 
the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that this court 
overlooked or misapprehended any facts or points of law that 
would establish she has a clear and indisputable right to relief
from this court for the remedies she seeks.  See Kema v. Gaddis,
91 
Hawaiʻi 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999)).  
 
 
 Therefore,  
 I
t is odered that the motion for reconsideration is denied. 
 It is further ordered that the denial of this instant motion for reconsideration closes this case.  The clerk shall 
not accept further filings in this case.
