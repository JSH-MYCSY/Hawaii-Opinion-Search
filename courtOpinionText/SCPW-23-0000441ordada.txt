Dkt. 14 ORD2 
        /s/ Rowena A. Somerville flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act 
on a subject properly before the court in which the judge is 
subject to a legal duty to act. See State 
ex rel. Kaneshiro v. 
Huddy, 82 Hawaiʻ i 188, 193, 921 P.2d 108, 113 (1996).  
Furthermore, with regard to the substantive decisions of the 
circuit court in the underlying litigation, and with regard to 
the allegations of judicial and attorney misconduct, we note the 
availability of alternate remedies.  We therefore conclude that 
the Petitioners have failed to establish a clear and 
indisputable right to relief or that they lack other means to 
adequately redress the alleged wrong, or both.  See Straub 
Clinic & Hospital v. Kochi, 81 Hawaiʻ i 410, 414, 917 P.2d 1284, 
1288 (1996); In re Disciplinary Bd. of Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court, 91 
Hawaiʻi 363, 368-69, 984 P.2d 688, 693-94 (1999); Breiner v. 
Sunderland, 112 Hawaiʻ i 60, 68, 143 P.3d 1262, 1270 (2006).  
Therefore,  It is ordered that the petition is denied.
