Dkt. 6 ODDP2 
  Under Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 804-9 (Supp. 2021), 
the trial court has broad discretion to establish a reasonable 
bail amount based on a balance of factors.  Accordingly, Medeiros’s grievances related to the denial of his motion to 
reduce bail are without merit to the extent a writ of mandamus 
is not meant to be used to supersede a judge’s discretionary 
authority.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawaiʻ i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 
334, 338 (1999). 
 As for Medeiros’s grievances related to the findings of 
fact, conclusions of law, and order denying Medeiros’s motion to 
suppress evidence, Medeiros has adequate means to redress the 
relief requested by appeal from the judgment entered in 2CPC-22-
0000677.  See HRS § 641-11 (2016).  Accordingly, denial of the 
petition as to this ground is warranted because a writ of 
mandamus is not “meant to serve as legal remedies in lieu of 
normal appellate procedures” and such a writ will not issue 
unless the petitioner establishes a “lack of other means to 
redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the requested 
action.”  See Kema, 91 Hawaiʻ i at 204, 982 P.2d at 338.  Medeiros 
failed to carry this burden. 
 Finally, it cannot be said that the respondent judge 
committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion in denying
Medeiros’s motion to reduce bail, motion for temporary release,  3  
 and motion to suppress evidence.  See id. at 205, 982 P.2d at 
339. 
 In conclusion, the court finds that all arguments made by Medeiros to support his petition are without merit.  See id. 
 It is ordered:  
1. The petition is denied without prejudice; 
2. The clerk of the appellate court shall process the 
petition without payment of the filing fee. 
3. In response to Medeiros’s request to initiate a formal 
complaint against the respondent judge, the appellate clerk shall transmit a copy of the petition to the Commission on 
Judicial Conduct (CJC) for such action as the CJC deems 
appropriate, with a copy transmitted to Medeiros’s last known 
address at Maui Community Correctional Center, 600 Waiale Drive, 
Wailuku, HI 96793.
