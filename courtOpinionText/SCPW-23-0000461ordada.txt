ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald , C.J., McKenna, and Eddins, JJ ., 
Circuit Judg e Johnson and Circuit Judge  Tonaki, 
assigned by reason of vacanc ies)  
 
 Petitioner Rick Blangiardi, Mayor of the City and County of 
Honolulu (the City), asserts that the Hawaiʻ i Labor Relations 
Board’s (HLRB’s) original jurisdiction over prohibited practice complaints under Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 89 was Electronically Filed

 effectively suspended by Governor David Y. Ige’s emergency 
proclamations issued during and concerning the COVID-19 
pandemic.  The City’s petition for a writ of mandamus asserts 
that, pursuant to HRS Chapter 127A, “the breadth, 
jurisdictional, and preemptive reach of the Governor’s emergency 
powers” “should be decided by the Judiciary,” not the HLRB.   
 
Yet that is what the HLRB decided when the HLRB denied the 
City’s motion to dismiss, the decision underlying the City’s 
petition for a writ of mandamus.  The HLRB clearly ruled that 
the jurisdictional reach of HRS Chapter 127A is the judiciary’s 
call.  The HLRB concluded it has jurisdiction over issues 
related to HRS Chapter 89, and because HRS Chapter 127A and 
Governor Ige’s emergency proclamations are not within HRS 
Chapter 89, the HLRB does not have jurisdiction to decide the 
applicability of HRS Chapter 127A and the emergency 
proclamations.  The HLRB also concluded that HRS Chapter 127A 
and the emergency proclamations may be raised on judicial review after the HLRB decides the prohibited practice issues under HRS 
Chapter 89. 
 The City appealed the HLRB’s decision on the City’s motion 
to dismiss to the circuit court.  But the City also filed a 
petition for a writ of mandamus in this court on August 4, 2023, 
requesting an order requiring (1) the parties to submit 3 
 expedited briefing in the appeal, and (2) a temporary stay of 
the August 8, 2023 HLRB hearing. 
 
A writ of mandamus is not meant to be used to interfere 
with or control the exercise of an agency’s or circuit court’s 
discretion.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawaiʻ i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 
334, 338 (1999); Barnett v. Broderick, 84 Hawaiʻ i 109, 111, 929 
P.2d 1359, 1361 (1996); Salling v. Moon, 76 Hawaiʻ i 273, 274 n.3, 
874 P.2d 1098, 1099 n.3 (1994). 
Nor is a writ of mandamus meant to be used in lieu of 
normal appellate procedures.  See Kema, 91 Hawaiʻ i at 204-05, 982 
P.2d at 338-39; Barnett, 84 Hawaiʻ i at 111, 929 P.2d at 1361. 
Here, the HLRB has jurisdiction to consider whether it has 
jurisdiction, as well as jurisdiction to decide which issues it 
has authority to adjudicate.  See HOH Corp. v. Motor Vehicle 
Industry Licensing Bd., 69 Haw. 135, 141, 736 P.2d 1271, 1275 
(1987).  Thus, it was within the HLRB’s discretion to deny the City’s motion to dismiss and decide which issues it has and does 
not have jurisdiction to consider.  That’s what happened here.   
If a party disagrees with the decision, that party may 
appeal that decision, as appropriate.  What a party should not 
do is sidestep normal appellate procedures by filing a petition 
for writ of mandamus merely because the party wants a speedy 
decision from this court.  That’s also what happened here. 4 
 Upon consideration of the City’s August 4, 2023 petition 
and the record, it is ordered that the petition is denied.
