SCPW-23-0000463 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻ I 
CELESTE M. GONSALVES, Petitioner, 
 
vs. 
 
THE HONORABLE KARIN L. HOLMA, 
Judge of the District Court of the First Circuit, 
State of Hawaiʻ i, Respondent Judge, 
 
and 
 
JEAN M. ORQUE, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(1DSC-23-0000434) 
 
     
 ORDER GRANTING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, and Eddins, JJ., 
Circuit Judge Kawano and Circuit Judge Kawashima, 
assigned by reason of vacancies) 
Upon consideration of the petition, Respondent’s answer to 
the petition, Petitioner’s reply, and the record, this court is 
satisfied that Petitioner has met the service required by Hawaiʻ i 
Revised Statutes § 633-28(a)(2) (2016) and Rules of the Small 
Claims Division of the District Courts (RSCD) Rule 3(c).  SeeRSCD Rule 1 (stating that the RSCD shall be construed to secure 
the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every 
action); RSCD Rule 9 (“The court shall not be bound by rules of 
evidence except provisions relating to privileged 
communications.”); see also Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawaiʻ i 200, 204, 
982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (mandamus standard). 
The evidence reflects that someone signed the certified 
mail receipt as the addressee within the first judicial circuit 
and Respondent has been appearing for the hearings, including 
the first hearing on June 30, 2023. 
It is ordered that the petition is granted and a writ shall 
issue requiring the Respondent Judge, or any presiding judge of the Small Claims Division of the District Court of the First 
Circuit, to move 1DSC-23-0000434 beyond the service issue, 
including setting for trial if necessary. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, December 7, 2023.
