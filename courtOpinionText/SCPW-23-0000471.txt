 2  We hold that a state-initiated original proceeding is not a 
legal action sheltered by sovereign immunity.  Thus, the state 
may be on the hook for reasonable attorney fees spent opposing a 
frivolous petition for extraordinary relief.   
Like here.  We conclude the Sierra Club is entitled to 
attorney fees.     
II. 
 In 2022, the Board of Land and Natural Resources, State of 
Hawaiʻi (BLNR) approved the continuation of revocable permits 
that allowed Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. and East Maui Irrigation 
Company, LLC to divert 40.49 million gallons of water per day 
(mgd) from East Maui streams.  The Sierra Club appealed to the Circuit Court of the First Circuit Environmental Court.  It 
argued that the BLNR unlawfully denied its request for a 
contested case hearing.  
 In June 2023, the environmental court modified the permits 
and capped at 31.5 mgd the amount of water Alexander & Baldwin and East Maui Irrigation could divert from the streams.  The 
environmental court invoked Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 604A-2(b)’s general equitable powers and also indicated that 
HRS § 91-14(g) allowed it to modify the permits. 
On July 14, 2023, the environmental court 
sided with the 
Sierra Club.  The BLNR should’ve held a contested case hearing.  Then, citing Mauna Kea Anaina Hou v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res., *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 3 136 Hawaiʻ i 376, 380-81, 363 P.3d 224, 228-29 (2015), and two 
other cases, the environmental court explained that “[a]s a 
general rule, when an agency fails to conduct a necessary contested case hearing, any approval it has issued is void.”  
Rather than void the revocable permits, however, the 
environmental court “ re-ordered” the 31.5 mgd cap.   Like before, 
the environmental court invoked HRS § 604A-2(b) (2016 & Supp. 
2018) and HRS § 91-14(g) (2012 & Supp. 2019) .  Public trust 
doctrine principles also supported the cap, the court wrote.  
The environmental court’s “Decision on Appeal and Order” explained that the court decided “not to risk chaos or 
unintended consequences by voiding the revocable permits in their entirety.  Doing so would potentially leave a legal vacuum 
until BLNR can issue new permits, which in turn could threaten 
reliable availability of necessary water.”  
On August 8, 2023, Lahaina burned and Hawaiʻ i residents 
died.   
  The next day, the BLNR petitioned this court.  The 
Department of the Attorney General (AG), the BLNR’s attorney, 
requested an extraordinary writ.  The BLNR sought a writ 
“enjoining the Respondent Judge from modifying the revocable 
permit conditions, including the cap amount of water permitted 
to be diverted.”  It also sought “an immediate stay of the Respondent Judge’s order.” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 4     The AG’s petition opened: “Central Maui has no water for 
fire reserve because the Respondent Judge substituted his 
judgment for that of the agency.  As a result, there was not 
enough permitted water to battle the wildfires on Maui this 
morning.” 
 The petition announced: “Now there is not enough fire 
reserve water in Central Maui.”  This shortage resulted, the BLNR alleged, because the environmental court “refused to permit any diversion of water for firefighting under the permits.”  The 
BLNR declared that “having the circuit court act as the 
gatekeeper to water has resulted in an imminent threat to public 
health and safety.” 
 Naturally we paid attention.  The Department of the 
Attorney General initiated an original proceeding during an unthinkable human event.  The petition advanced an idea that 
legal events impacted the nation’s most devastating wildfire.  A 
fire that leveled Lahaina, a historic, one-of-a-kind place on earth.  Land so special that in 1802 it was established by King 
Kamehameha as the Hawaiian Kingdom’s capital.  
  This court quickly ordered briefing.  At our request, the 
Sierra Club, the plaintiff during the years-long case, filed a response.  They met our speedy three-day deadline. 
  Both the County of Maui and the Sierra Club credibly 
discredited the BLNR’s key factual claim to support its petition *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 5 – there was no water to adequately fight the Maui fires because 
of the environmental court.  Maui County flatly contradicted the 
BLNR.  The County said it had way more than enough water to 
fight the fires.    
  The Sierra Club called the BLNR “shameful.”  It described 
the BLNR’s petition as disrespectful finger-pointing, a “brazen attempt to capitalize on tragedy to subvert the judicial 
process.”  Counsel’s briefing exhaustively, yet concisely, connected wide-ranging on-the-record evidence to persuasively 
confute the BLNR’s accusations.    
 In contrast, the BLNR’s briefing mustered nothing, even 
scantly, to support its instigative claims that “there was not enough permitted water to battle the wildfires on Maui this 
morning” because the environmental court judge “substituted his judgment for that of the agency.” 
 The BLNR’s petition second-guessed the environmental 
court’s rulings.  As the Sierra Club aptly noted, the BLNR’s 
quibbles with those calls hardly amounted to writ material: 
“Well-settled precedent prohibits BLNR from leap-frogging over 
ongoing appellate proceedings . . . .  Writs of mandamus are 
decidedly ‘not meant to . . . serve as legal remedies in lieu of 
normal appellate procedures,’ which is exactly what BLNR is 
attempting here.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 6  Before oral argument, the Sierra Club informed the 
Department of the Attorney General that the statements in the 
petition were sanctionable. 
 The BLNR did nothing.     
 We held oral argument.  Right away, this court asked the 
BLNR’s attorney whether the agency wished to “walk back” 
passages, or anything it had represented, in its petition.  
Counsel declined.  Again and again.  Much later during the virtual oral argument, counsel deep-breathed, “We’re not blaming 
the circuit judge, and we do apologize for the harshness of the 
language.”  
  The County of Maui repeated that it had enough water and 
that the environmental court’s decisions did not impact Maui’s 
firefighting efforts.  The County represented it had millions of 
gallons of water available, strong-winds hampered helicopter 
access, and it had used 37,000 gallons of water over 
approximately five days of firefighting.    We took the matter under advisement.     
 Not for long.  The next morning this court issued a two-
page order denying the BLNR’s petition. 
III. 
 The Sierra Club moved this court per HRS § 607-14.5 (2016) 
for attorney fees. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 7  In suits for monetary damage or injunctive relief, HRS 
§ 607-14.5(a) allows “either party, whether or not the party was 
a prevailing party” to recover its reasonable attorney fees if 
“all or a portion of the party’s claim or defense was 
frivolous.”   
   This original proceeding does not involve monetary 
damages.  Thus, it must relate to injunctive relief for the Sierra Club to recover fees under HRS § 607-14.5.    That’s not all.  After a party identifies the other side’s 
frivolous claims in writing, HRS § 607-14.5(c) gives the putatively transgressing party a chance to foreswear them.  If a 
party takes back its words, it may not have to pay up.  There 
are no attorney fees “[i]f the party withdraws the frivolous 
claims or defenses within a reasonable length of time.”  HRS § 607-14.5(c). 
 The BLNR opposed the Sierra Club’s motion for attorney 
fees.  As a state agency, it invoked sovereign immunity.  That 
doctrine bars monetary recovery, the BLNR says, including 
attorney fees and costs.  The BLNR also insists its claims were 
not frivolous or made in bad faith. 
 We disagree.   
 First, we conclude that the BLNR’s petition functionally 
compares to an injunctive relief action.  The BLNR’s petition *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 8 requested an “immediate stay” of a court order and asked us to 
“enjoin” the environmental court. 
 We see little difference for purposes of HRS § 607-14.5 
fees between a writ that seeks injunctive relief and a complaint that seeks injunctive relief.  The remedy is the same – 
injunctive relief.  Thus, any distinction between how a party 
styles a request for prospective relief is immaterial.  
 Next, we conclude that the BLNR made frivolous claims and 
declined to withdraw them despite the peril of paying attorney 
fees.   
Some claims have no place in our legal system.  They dent 
the justice system.  The legislature designed HRS § 607-14.5 to 
curb frivolous allegations.  To award attorney fees for a 
frivolous claim, a court must make “a specific finding that all or a portion of the party’s claim or defense . . . are frivolous 
and are not reasonably supported by the facts and the law in the 
civil action.”  HRS § 607-14.5(a) and (b).    Since this is an original proceeding, we treat the entire 
petition as the pleading.  The BLNR’s factual claims are intertwined with its claims for relief.  The allegations 
directly support the requested relief and are subject to an HRS 
§ 607-14.5 frivolous finding. 
 The BLNR sought a writ against the environmental court.  It 
believed the court exceeded its jurisdiction.  The BLNR knows *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 9 that this court rarely fact-finds.  See State v. West, 95 Hawaiʻ i 
452, 461, 24 P.3d 648, 657 (2001) (abrogated on other grounds) 
(“We take this opportunity to reiterate that fact-finding is the fundamental responsibility of the judge of the facts at 
trial.”).  Yet, the BLNR’s petition overflows with factual 
allegations to support its interest.  The BLNR makes varied 
factual claims to promote a view that the environmental court 
enfeebled firefighting efforts. 
 The Sierra Club says the BLNR “made a series of unsupported and unsupportable statements.”  The Sierra Club paints the 
BLNR’s petition as misleading and disrespectful.  It makes 
clear, though, that the “primary” focus of its motion relates to “BLNR’s false statements and undisputed facts.” 
 We understand that representations may not always have a sound basis in fact or law.  That’s bad.  But that’s sometimes 
litigation.  And those representations that have no reasonable 
basis in fact or law are typically taken care of.  See Ralston 
v. Yim, 129 Hawai ʻi 46, 55, 292 P.3d 1276, 1285 (2013).   
 But this is different.   
 The Sierra Club spotlights five representations made by the 
BLNR. 
1. “Central Maui has no water for fire reserve because  
the Respondent Judge substituted his judgment for that 
of the agency.  As a result, there was not enough permitted water to battle the wildfires on Maui this 
morning.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 10  
2. “Now there is not enough fire reserve water in  
Central Maui.” 
 
3. “Shortly after [the environmental court ‘refused to 
permit any diversion of water for firefighting under 
the permits,’] terrible wildfires broke out in Maui, 
leaving the court and agency hamstringed and unable to act quickly within the circuit court’s own 
parameters to adjust water for firefighting.” 
 
4. “The [environmental] court disagreed and refused to  
permit any diversion of water for firefighting under 
the permits.” 
 
5. “Time is of the essence and having the circuit court act as the gatekeeper to water has resulted in an 
imminent threat to public health and safety.”    
We conclude these allegations were frivolous.  The Sierra 
Club’s answer and motion, and Maui County’s representations, 
clearly establish sound grounds for us to conclude that “a 
portion of the party’s claim . . . was frivolous.”  HRS § 607-
14.5(a). 
Contrary to the claims in the BLNR’s petition, there was 
enough permitted water and reserve water to fight the fires.  
And the environmental court’s actions did not “result[] . . . in 
an imminent threat to public health and safety.” 
The Sierra Club provided us hard data and pointed to the 
underlying case’s water usage figures.  If needed, there was sufficient water in the Central Maui reservoirs to fight Maui’s 
fires.  By a lot.  Unused water diverted from the East Maui 
streams went into the Central Maui reservoirs and was available *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 11 for firefighting (and dust control).  In its July 2023 quarterly 
report to the BLNR, Alexander & Baldwin and East Maui Irrigation 
disclosed that in April, May, and June 2023, there was a monthly 
average of 5.5 mgd available in the Central Maui reservoirs for 
fire protection.  Despite the BLNR’s claims, the Central Maui 
reservoirs had sufficient fire water reserves.  The BLNR 
presented nothing to prop up its allegations.  
So there were millions of gallons of water per day to fight 
the fires.  But how much water could Maui County use?  Not millions of gallons per day.  In a 2021 contested case 
proceeding, the BLNR issued this finding of fact:  
According to the Maui County Fire Department, a helicopter 
uses approximately 2,400 gallons per hour of water; tankers 
use 7,000 gallons per hour; type 1 engines use 1,500 gallons per hour; type 5 engines use 800 gallons per hour; 
and utility vehicles use 300 gallons per hour. . . . 
Assuming that it is only safe to fight a fire during 
daylight, a fire requiring one- each of those (helicopters, 
tankers, and utility vehicles) would use 144,000 gallons of 
water (12,000 approximate gallons hourly x 12 hours of 
daytime firefighting) every day. 
 
 Now we turn to how much water would Maui County use to 
fight the fires – a useful metric to consider if the 
environmental court’s decisions impaired life-and-property-
saving efforts. 
 The County of Maui helped.  During oral argument, the 
County represented it used 37,000 gallons of water over approximately five days of fighting the fires.  High winds 
hampered aerial efforts.  (At oral argument, the BLNR’s counsel *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 12 fuzzily referred to “others” who used unspecified amounts of 
water.) 
 Next, contrary to the BLNR’s assertions, the environmental 
court’s order specifically permitted water for firefighting.  The allotted water usage for firefighting would be “drawn from 
the 7.5 mgd drawn by the County.”  So the BLNR’s claims that the 
environmental court “refused to permit any diversion of water 
for firefighting under the permits” and “Central Maui has no water for fire reserve” are counterfactual. 
The BLNR also claimed that the environmental court’s permit 
modification “hamstringed” the agency, leaving it “unable to act 
quickly within the circuit court’s own parameters to adjust 
water for firefighting.”  We are dubious.  Not only because, 
like its other representations, the BLNR produced little or no support to back its words.  But because of the court’s actions 
during the morning of August 9, 2023, the day after the fires 
started and before the BLNR filed its petition.  Then, the environmental court emailed all counsel asking if there were 
“any issues related to the water cap . . . and the ongoing 
efforts to suppress the wildfires across Maui.”  Per Alexander & 
Baldwin and the BLNR’s requests, the environmental court 
suspended the 31.50 mgd cap from August 9 to August 15 – “the 
court hereby authorizes any additional water use above the cap *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 13 related to actual or potential fire fighting, fire suppression, 
fire hazard, or any other use related to the recent fires.”  
The BLNR’s representations are “manifestly and palpably 
without merit.”  Coll v. McCarthy, 72 Haw. 20, 29, 804 P.2d 881, 
887 (1991).  They are frivolous. 
The Sierra Club’s motion called the BLNR’s statements 
“harmful” to both the Sierra Club and the court system.  It says the BLNR “perpetuated a false narrative that the environmental court, the Sierra Club and others who care about the environment 
were exacerbating damage caused by the fires.” 
We realize that making untrue or inaccurate statements 
standing alone does not establish that a party’s statements were 
frivolous.  See Canalez v. Bob’s Appliance Serv. Ctr., Inc., 89 
Hawaiʻi 292, 300, 972 P.2d 295, 303 (1999).   
Here, there’s more. 
During oral argument, this court asked the deputy attorney 
general many times whether the BLNR wanted to “walk back” passages or anything it had represented.  Counsel declined. 
On August 30, 2023, after this court denied the petition, 
the Sierra Club informed the BLNR’s counsel and senior members of the Department of the Attorney General that it would seek 
attorney fees unless the AG’s filed “an unequivocal[] 
withdraw[al]” of five statements it had made in its petition. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 14   The Sierra Club reminded them: “The Sierra Club explained 
in its answer to the BLNR’s petition that these statements have 
no evidentiary support; that they are false; that they were made 
in bad faith, exploiting a tragedy; and that they are 
frivolous.”  
 The Department of the Attorney General stood by its words. 
 Rejecting a request to retract and refusing to withdraw 
spurious attacks on a judge count when it comes to an HRS § 607-14.5 frivolous finding.  “In determining whether claims or 
defenses are frivolous, the court may consider whether the party 
alleging that the claims or defenses are frivolous had submitted 
to the party asserting the claims or defenses a request for 
their withdrawal.”  HRS § 607-14.5(b).   
Though HRS § 607-14.5 does not mention “bad faith,” this 
court has determined that the concept shapes a frivolous finding 
under that law.  We have said that an HRS § 607-14.5(b) “finding 
of frivolousness is a high bar; it is not enough that a claim be without merit, there must be a showing of bad faith.”  Tagupa v. 
VIPDesk, 135 Hawai ʻi 468, 479, 353 P.3d 1010, 1021 (2015).  This 
court has not defined the contours of HRS § 607-14.5(b)’s 
“frivolous-plus” finding, but we have assessed bad faith under 
certain circumstances.  For instance, in Tagupa we suggested 
that “an excessive and unreasonable amount of damages may be an 
indication of the frivolous and bad faith nature.”  135 Hawai ʻi *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 15 at 480, 353 P.3d at 1022 (cleaned up).  And Coll reasoned that 
the plaintiff’s knowledge when filing a complaint that the 
allegations were false, clearly indicated bad faith.  72 Haw. at 
30-31, 804 P.2d at 888.  In Canalez this court declined to award 
attorney fees, holding that although a party made untrue or inaccurate statements, whether the defendant’s “negligence 
caused the accident still remained unresolved.”  89 Hawai
ʻi at 
300, 972 P.2d at 303.  These cases do not set an insurmountable 
bad faith bar to HRS § 607-14.5 attorney fees.  Rather, they 
stress that “[a] meritless claim, without more, is not 
sufficient to show that the . . . party acted in bad 
faith.”  Pub. Access Trails Hawaiʻ i v. Haleakala Ranch Co., 153 
Hawaiʻi 1, 29, 526 P.3d 526, 554 (2023). 
Here, it seems that the BLNR tried to leverage the most 
horrific event in state history to advance its interests.   
 The BLNR’s attention-grabbing petition for extraordinary 
relief asked us to step in and enjoin the environmental court.  
Based on “facts” the BLNR advanced.  Facts wrapped in super-charged word choices.  
 Turns out, the BLNR offered no evidence to back its 
aggressive position that the circuit court’s orders regarding 
water permits in East Maui caused a shortage of water available 
to fight the wildfires.  They presented nothing to show that 
“there [was] not enough fire reserve water in Central Maui” *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 16 because of the “Respondent Judge’s uninformed notions of 
hydrology.” 
We hold that the statements made in the BLNR’s petition 
were so “manifestly and palpably without merit, so as to 
indicate bad faith.”  Coll, 72 Haw. at 29, 804 P.2d at 887 
(citation omitted).   
 The morning after the oral argument, this court issued a 
terse order denying the petition.  The timing and content of that order signaled our displeasure with the original 
proceeding.   
 Writs are rare.  They remedy extraordinary legal events. 
The Department of the Attorney General knows that 
“[e]xtraordinary writs are appropriate in extraordinary 
circumstances.  Exceeding jurisdiction, committing a flagrant 
and manifest abuse of discretion, or refusing to act on a 
subject properly before the court under circumstances in which 
it has a legal duty to act, are court actions and inaction that may constitute extraordinary circumstances to issue a writ.”  
Womble Bond Dickinson (US) LLP v. Kim, 153 Hawaiʻ
i 307, 319, 537 
P.3d 1154, 1166 (2023) (cleaned up). 
 The AGs also know that a writ-seeking party has a tough 
lift.  A petitioner must “demonstrate . . . a clear and 
indisputable right to the relief requested and a lack of other *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 17 means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or to obtain the 
requested action.”  Id. (cleaned up). 
 This court read and heard the BLNR’s arguments.  The petition does not approach the standard for extraordinary 
relief.   
The BLNR’s refusal to withdraw the meritless assertions, 
the flimsiness of its request for extraordinary relief, and its 
use of the Maui tragedy, support a finding of frivolousness and bad faith.  That is, a “portion of the claims . . . made by the 
party are frivolous and are not reasonably supported by the 
facts and the law in the civil action.”  HRS § 607-14.5(b).  And 
those claims were made in bad faith.  See Tagupa, 135 Hawaiʻ
i at 
479, 353 P.3d at 1021. 
IV. 
Because we find HRS § 607-14.5 applies, the Sierra Club may 
recover its reasonable attorney fees and costs. 
 We conclude the Sierra Club counsel’s requested attorney 
fees and costs are reasonable.  Under an accelerated timeframe, 
we asked the Sierra Club to aid our understanding of the BLNR’s petition.  Counsel produced sound writing and presented solid 
oral argument to this court.  In this case, filed against the 
environmental court judge (who declined to respond per Hawaiʻ i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 21(c) (eff. 2010)), 
counsel helped set the record straight.  Along with the County *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 18 of Maui, the Sierra Club showed how the BLNR made claims “not 
reasonably supported by the facts and the law.”   
  We conclude that the Sierra Club counsel’s request for 
attorney fees was reasonable and sufficiently documented.  
 Wait, not so fast, the BLNR hand-waves.  As a state agency, 
it invokes sovereign immunity.  Though reasonable attorney fees 
may be appropriate, sovereign immunity shields the state from 
having to pay.   Not so. 
 Sovereign immunity is judicially-made.  The doctrine 
protects a state from suits that seek monetary damages.  See 
Nelson v. Hawaiian Homes Comm’n, 130 Hawai ʻi 162, 168, 307 P.3d 
142, 148 (2013).  Most of the time.  Unless there is a “clear 
relinquishment of immunity and the State has consented to be 
sued,” money is not a remedy for a successful suit against the 
state.  Bush v. Watson, 81 Hawai ʻi 474, 481, 918 P.2d 1130, 1137 
(1996) (cleaned up); see also Rivera v. Cataldo, 153 Hawai ʻi 320, 
323, 537 P.3d 1167, 1170 (2023). 
Sovereign immunity does not bar injunctive relief actions.  
In a suit like this “[w]here a party seeks only injunctive 
relief, the ability to sue the state does not stem from a 
waiver 
of sovereign immunity, but from the fact that sovereign immunity does not bar suit in the first place.”  Sierra Club v. Dep’t of *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 19 Transp. of State of Hawaiʻ i, 120 Hawaiʻ i 181, 229 n.30, 202 P.3d 
1226, 1274 n.30 (2009). 
 Some suits against the state are unconcerned with a 
monetary remedy.  For instance, declaratory judgment actions are 
a common way the state winds up as defendant.  “The State’s 
sovereign immunity does not bar actions seeking prospective 
declaratory or injunctive relief.”  Gold Coast Neighborhood 
Ass’n v. State, 140 Hawai ʻi 437, 464, 403 P.3d 214, 241 (2017). 
The BLNR argues that sovereign immunity forbids damages, 
and attorney fees are just like damages.  Citing Gold Coast, the 
BLNR maintains that because “an award of costs and fees to a 
prevailing party is inherently in the nature of a damage award,” 
sovereign immunity bars recovery.  Id. at 465, 403 P.3d at 242.    
Since fees are like damages, the BLNR’s argument goes, it 
doesn’t need to pay the Sierra Club’s lawyer.  Just like the 
state didn’t need to pay Gold Coast Neighborhood Association’s 
lawyer.  
 But there’s a big difference.  Gold Coast Neighborhood 
Association initiated the action against the state and therefore 
could not recover.  
See id. at 443, 403 P.3d at 220.  This court 
purposefully left for another day whether the state may invoke sovereign immunity to dodge attorney fees in a case where it 
initiated the action.  Id. at 466, 403 P.3d at 243.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 20 That day has come.  The state did not withhold consent from 
being sued.  It sued.  The BLNR initiated an original proceeding 
against the environmental court.  A separate case.  In this 
court.  See HRS § 602-5(a)(3) (2016); HRAP Rules 17 (2006) and 
45 (2016).  The BLNR served the respondents, First Circuit Court Judge Jeffrey Crabtree, and the Sierra Club.  This is not a 
proceeding against the state. 
 We hold that the state waives its sovereign immunity when it initiates an original action.  
See People v. Downs, 864 N.E. 
2d 320, 323 (Ill. App. Ct. 2007) (“The doctrine of sovereign immunity bars only actions brought against the State, not 
actions brought by the state.”).  Thus, if the state initiates 
an original action and makes frivolous claims, then it is 
subject to reasonable attorney fees.   
 This court also has the inherent power to issue
