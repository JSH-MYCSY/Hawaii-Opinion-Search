 of the petition and answers, the oral argument held on August 
23, 2023, and the record, 
Petitioner has failed to establish a “clear and 
indisputa
ble right to the relief requested and a lack of other 
means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or to obtain the 
requested action.”  See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawaiʻi 200, 204, 982 
P.2d 334, 338 (1999).  Thus, it is ordered that the petition is 
denied.   
It is further ordered that the request for an immediate 
stay of the Respondent Judge’s order pending this court’s 
consideration of the petition and Petitioner’s motion to shorten 
time for consideration of the petition are denied as moot.
