 relief by order filed on October 3, 2023.  Petitioner has not 
demonstrated a clear and indisputable right to relief, nor a 
lack of alternative means to seek relief.  See Kema v. Gaddis, 
91 Hawaiʻi 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999). 
We also reject Petitioner’s assertion that the deputy 
prosecuting attorney that filed a response to the HRPP Rule 40 
petition should be sanctioned or otherwise disciplined.  
Respondent State of Hawaiʻi is allowed to file a response that 
objects to the arguments made in a HRPP Rule 40 petition.  See 
HRPP Rule 40(d) (“Within 30 days after service of the petition 
or within such further time as the court may allow, the 
respondent may answer or otherwise plead, but the court may 
require the State to answer at any time.”). 
It is ordered that the petition is denied.   
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawaii, October 23, 2023.
