SCPW-23-0000569 
 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI‘I 
IN THE INTEREST OF NICHOLAS ABEL 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, and Eddins, JJ.,  
Circuit Judge Kim  and Circuit Judge Kawano,  
assigned by reasons of vacancies)  
Upon consideration of the September 18, October 5, and 
October 24, 2023 submissions from Nicholas Abel, which we deem 
either an attempt to initiate civil litigation against two individuals, or to seek post-conviction relief concerning 
judgments entered against him, we conclude this court lacks the 
jurisdiction to consider his requests for relief.  Cf.
 Hawaiʻi 
Revised Statutes §§ 603-21.5(a) (Supp. 2017), 604-5 (2016); Rule 40(b) of the Hawaiʻ i Rules of Penal Procedure. We also note the 
motion for permission to proceed in forma pauperis. Therefore,    
 
  
       
       
       
       
       
  
 It is ordered that the motion to proceed in forma pauperis 
is granted. 
It is further ordered that the petitions are dismissed 
without prejudice to Abel seeking relief in a court of 
appropriate jurisdiction.
