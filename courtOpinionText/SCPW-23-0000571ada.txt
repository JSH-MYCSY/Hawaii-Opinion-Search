CIRCUIT JUDGE OCHIAI, ASSIGNED BY REASON OF VACANCIES  
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J. 
 
I. 
For decades, thousands of Native Hawaiians waited to lease 
land pledged to them under the federal government’s 1920 
Hawaiian Homes Commission Act.  First the Territory of Hawaiʻ i, 
then the State of Hawaiʻ i, held homestead land in trust for 
Native Hawaiian beneficiaries.  Both breached their fiduciary 
duties from the start.  See Kalima v. State, 111 Hawaiʻi 84, 88, 
137 P.3d 990, 994 (2006) (Kalima I). 
Now Native Hawaiians will receive compensation for the 
State’s failure.  In a class action, trust beneficiaries 
successfully sued the State.  The State breached its trustee 
responsibilities.  The State settled. 
Many beneficiaries died as the case progressed.  Others 
waited.  And waited.  Like untold numbers of Native Hawaiians after 1920 who just wanted to live on the promised homelands.  
Our decision accelerates payout to the beneficiaries.   
Because of its extraordinary public importance, we accepted 
a petition for a writ of mandamus, an appeal challenging final 
approval of the case’s settlement.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 3 We hold that Petitioner Rickey T. Rivera, Jr. has no right 
to compensation.  He was born beyond the statutory period to 
receive a payout from the settlement.  
Rivera also appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
(ICA).  Our decision ends Rivera’s appeal.  We direct the ICA to 
dismiss CAAP-23-0000572.  
II. 
 The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act created a land trust to provide homesteads to Native Hawaiians.  Kalima v. State, 148 
Hawaiʻi 129, 133, 468 P.3d 143, 147 (2020) (Kalima II).  Kalima I 
and Kalima II chronicle the messy history of the State’s trust 
breaches.  And the snail-paced struggles to redress those 
betrayals.  Kalima I, 111 Hawaiʻ i at 88-97, 137 P.3d at 994-1003; 
Kalima II, 148 Hawaiʻ i at 133-42, 468 P.3d at 147-56.  We recap 
some history.  
 In 1991, the legislature waived the State’s sovereign 
immunity.  It passed a law that allowed beneficiaries of the 
Hawaiian Homes Commission Act to sue the State.  Hawaiʻ i Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 674-17 (2016).  The law entitled qualified 
Native Hawaiians to compensation for individual trust breaches that happened between August 21, 1959 and June 30, 1988.  HRS 
§ 674-16 (2016).  
 In 1999, the plaintiffs filed a class action alleging 
breaches of the State’s trust responsibility.  In 2009, the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 4 Circuit Court of the First Circuit sided with them.  The State 
was liable.  Kalima II, 148 Hawaiʻ i at 136, 468 P.3d 150.   
Drawn-out litigation, settlement talks, and law-making ensued.  
In June 2022, the parties settled.  The State agreed to pay 
the beneficiary class $328 million.  The legislature, in turn, 
appropriated funds for that settlement.  S.B. 3041, S.D. 2, H.D. 
1, C.D. 1, 31st Leg., Reg. Sess. (2022); see Act 280 (2022).  
The settlement agreement has two key terms covering the 
time frame before eligible class members receive compensation: 
final approval by the circuit court, and judicial finality – an 
end to all appellate review. 
The circuit court concluded that there were 2,515 eligible 
class members.  1,351 class members are alive; 1,164 passed away.  Class members or their estates will receive $286 million 
(the remaining funds appropriated by the legislature go to 
attorney’s fees and other expenses).  
The settlement excludes class members who are ineligible 
for payment.  HRS § 674-16 has a cut-off date.  Per that law, 
the settlement does not pay anyone who “asserted an individual breach of trust that occurred after June 30, 1988.”  
This law excludes Rivera.  He did not become eligible to 
apply for a homestead lease until he turned 18 on August 21, 
1988.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 5 As final approval neared, the circuit court received 
objections.  The court had to determine – at a Hawaiʻ i Rules of 
Civil Procedure Rule 23 fairness hearing - whether the class 
settlement was “fair, reasonable, and adequate.”  See Pub. 
Access Trails Hawaiʻ i v. Haleakala Ranch Co., 153 Hawaiʻ i  1, 32, 
526 P.3d 526, 557 (2023) (McKenna, J. concurring) (applying the “fair, reasonable, and adequate” standard from Federal Rule of 
Civil Procedure 23(e) to a Hawaiʻ i class action).  
In June 2023, Rivera objected.  Later he withdrew his 
objection.  But soon he reappeared, mailing two letters to the 
circuit court.  In the first, Rivera insists that he deserves 
compensation: the “claim administrator made a mistake.”  
Likewise, the second letter complains that the claim 
administrator erred.  Rivera asks the circuit court to look at 
his claim.  
On July 21, 2023, the court conducted the fairness hearing.  
The settlement was “fair, reasonable and adequate.”  All 
objections lacked merit.  The court approved the settlement.  And on August 1, it entered final judgment. 
On August 17, 2023, the circuit court received and filed 
another letter from Rivera.  Now he wanted to appeal: “I wish to 
file an appeal before the deadline of August 31, 2023.”  Rivera 
wrote: “The appeal is limited to the issue of special master and *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 6 claims administrator failing to process my claim in a timely 
fashion.”  
Because of the settlement’s finality term, Rivera 
effectively paused payment to 2,515 class members with vetted 
claims.  The circuit court sought input from the parties.  The 
State said that so long as Rivera’s appeal is unresolved, the 
settlement’s finality term (no more appeals possible) is unmet.  
Class counsel countered: Rivera had no right to appeal.  
Circuit Court of the First Circuit Judge Lisa Cataldo 
expressed dismay.  “If any case demands that counsel bring to bear the full measure of their experience, expertise and talents 
to develop and consider strategies for a thoughtful, 
constructive, creative and legally-compliant resolution short of 
disposition by the appellate court, it is this one.”  The 
court’s invite spurred no helpful solution.   
  On October 9, 2023, Judge Cataldo ordered the clerk to file 
Rivera’s appeal with the ICA (case number CAAP-23-0000572). 
 
Before the appeal was docketed, Rivera sent a letter to the 
Hawaiʻi Supreme Court: 
Ref: Kalima Lawsuit Case File 
 I am a claimant plaintiff in the above case, I respectfully 
understand the Hawaii Supreme Court has established rules 
in order to qualify for settlement payment.  I believe I do 
qualify under the rule, but the Special Master refused to 
process my claims.  Can you please have [the Court] review my records for verification please; my defenses are the 
breach of trust period is from August 21, 1959 through June 
30, 1988.  My first attempt to apply was June 15, 1988.  
Enclosed are the records for your review. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 7  
Together with that letter were documents, like notices Rivera 
received from the Hawaiian Claims Office.  Rivera didn’t pay the 
petition filing fee, or ask to waive the fee.  Then on October 
10, the court clerk received a check from him.  That day, the clerk docketed Rivera’s letter as an original proceeding in this 
court.   
 We treated Rivera’s letter as a petition for a writ of 
mandamus.  See Erum v. Llego, 147 Hawaiʻ i 368, 391, 465 P.3d 815, 
838 (2020) (we construe self-represented filings liberally to 
provide a route to relief).  Because Rivera’s petition and 
appeal raise the same issue, we stayed the ICA proceedings 
pending resolution of the petition.  
III. 
We reject Rivera’s petition for a writ of mandamus.  
Writs are rare.  Writs are an exceptional remedy; they are 
no substitute for appeal.   Gannett Pac. Corp. v. Richardson, 59 
Haw. 224, 227, 580 P.2d 49, 53 (1978).   
The Hawaiʻ i Constitution and Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes allow 
us to issue writs.  Art. VI of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution vests the 
“judicial power of the State” in this court and the lower 
courts.  Judicial power includes the ability to advance justice.  
State v. Moriwake, 65 Haw. 47, 55, 647 P.2d 705, 712 (1982). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 8 HRS § 602-5(3) (2016 & Supp. 2022) confers original 
jurisdiction over writs.  And HRS §602-5(5) allows us to issue 
writs or orders to aid our jurisdiction.   
More broadly, HRS § 602-5(6) empowers the Hawaiʻi Supreme 
Court to do justice.  This court has the power to “make and 
award such judgments, decrees, orders and mandates, issue such 
executions and other processes, and do such other acts and take 
such other steps as may be necessary to carry into full effect 
the powers which are or shall be given to it by law or for the 
promotion of justice in matters pending before it.”  HRS § 602-
5(6).   
The Hawaiʻi Supreme Court also has general supervisory 
powers over the state’s lower courts.  “The supreme court shall 
have the general superintendence of all courts of inferior 
jurisdiction to prevent and correct errors and abuses therein 
where no other remedy is expressly provided by law.”  HRS § 602-
4 (2016). 
“Extraordinary writs are appropriate in extraordinary 
circumstances.”  Womble Bond Dickinson (US) LLP v. Kim, ___ 
Hawaiʻi ___, 2023 WL 6861305, at *9 (2023).  “[T]here are rare 
and exceptional situations where despite the availability of 
alternative remedies, the special and exigent circumstances of 
the particular case may move this court to issue its writ.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 9 Sapienza v. Hayashi, 57 Haw. 289, 293, 554 P.2d 1131, 1135 
(1976).  
When issues of “considerable public importance” are at 
stake, we may exercise our supervisory power.  Kaneshiro v. Au, 
67 Haw. 442, 446, 690 P.2d 1304, 1308 (1984).  Sometimes lower 
courts require “immediate need of direction from this court on a 
procedural and substantive matter of public importance.”  
Gannett, 59 Haw. at 227, 580 P.2d 53.  The value of speedy 
resolution may also prompt this court to step in: to “allow the 
matter to rest until the appeals process has run its course 
would forestall the expeditious presentation” of important 
public issues.  Sapienza, 57 Haw. at 294, 554 P.2d 1135.  A long 
lull may cause public harm.  Id.  
Because of this case’s extraordinary public importance, we 
accepted the petition.  Now we resolve it. 
1,351 people, and the descendants of 1,164 more, await 
long-overdue compensation.  We feel there is a critical and 
immediate need to provide decisive direction.      
Here, the ordinary timeline for appellate review delays 
justice.  Per  Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule Hawaiʻi
28, an appellant gets 40 days to file their brief, and a 
respondent receives another 40 days to answer.  Then the 
appellant has 14 days to reply.  Extensions may happen.  See 
HRAP 29(a).  After that, the ICA takes time to decide.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 10 Following the ICA’s judgment, a party has 30 days to apply for 
cert.  And this court has 30 days to accept or reject the cert 
application.  HRAP 40.1.   
The beneficiaries have waited decades, across two 
centuries.  Many have died before receiving homestead land or 
compensation for the State’s breach of its trust duties.  
Justice demands ending this case.  Paying the beneficiaries.  
Now.    
A prompt appellate resolution serves the public interest.  
Our resolution is an appropriate use of our authority under HRS 
§§ 602-4 and 602-5. 
IV. 
Rivera has standing to appeal the circuit court’s order 
approving the settlement.  His letters preserved grounds for 
appeal.  
Courts liberally construe a self-represented litigant’s 
filings to promote “equal access to justice and an opportunity 
to be heard.”  Makila Land Co., LLC v. Kapu, 152 Hawaiʻ i 112, 
121, 522 P.3d 259, 268 (2022).  A court assesses a pro se 
submission to favor a route to relief when a reasonable 
construction lets the party go on.  Erum, 147 Hawaiʻ i at 391, 465 
P.3d at 838. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 11 Rivera has preserved the one issue that animates his 
appeal: eligibility to receive compensation.  His letters to the 
circuit court protested: “I disagree with the notice that I do 
not qualify for payment.”  He included several claim-related 
documents and asked the circuit court to consider his 
eligibility.  Later his August 17 letter announced: “I wish to 
file an appeal before the deadline of August 31, 2023.”  We must 
reasonably construe these filings to pave a route to relief.  
Rivera gets his day in appellate court.  We decide the petition 
on the merits.  
V. 
The question Rivera raises in his ICA appeal mirrors the 
one he raises to this court: is he entitled to payment from the 
settlement pot?  
He is not.  
The reason is elementary.  Rivera was too young to get a 
homestead lease during the statutory claim period.  
In 1991, the legislature passed Act 323.  The Act empowered 
Native Hawaiians to seek compensation for the State’s fiduciary 
breaches.  HRS § 674-1 (2016).  The State waived its sovereign 
immunity.  HRS § 674-16(a).  The people of Hawaiʻ i, through their 
elected officials, took responsibility.  Native Hawaiians were 
gravely harmed.  The legislature awarded “individual *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 12 beneficiaries under the Hawaiian home lands trust” compensation.  
HRS § 674-1. 
HRS Chapter 674 limited the compensation period from 
statehood’s first day - August 21, 1959 - to June 30, 1988.  HRS 
§ 674-16(a).  The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act requires 
homestead applicants to be at least 18 years old.  1985 Haw. 
Sess. Laws, Act 60, § 2 at 93-94.  To receive compensation, a 
class member must have been eligible for a lease – and thus at 
least 18 – by June 30, 1988.  
Rivera was born too late, August 21, 1970.  He turned 18 on 
August 21, 1988, almost two months after the June 30 statutory 
deadline.   
Many settlement class members waited decades for homestead 
land that never came.  But Rivera was too young to get a lease.  
So he lacks any claim to compensation.  The claims administrator 
and circuit court correctly concluded that he was ineligible for 
compensation. 
We end Rivera’s case.  Because the legal issue is the same, 
our holding moots Rivera’s appeal in CAAP-23-0000572.   
VI. 
We deny the petition.  Per HRS §§ 602-4 and 602-5, we order 
the ICA to dismiss CAAP-23-0000572. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 13 There are no appeals left.  This petition ends all 
appellate review in case number 1CC990004771.  We remand to the 
circuit court.   Rickey T. Rivera, Jr.
