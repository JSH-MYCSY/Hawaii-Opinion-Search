ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 1CCV-22-0000740) 
   
     
  ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald , C.J., McKenna, and Eddins, JJ ., 
Circuit Judg e Johnson and Circuit Judge Tonaki, 
assigned by reason of vacanc ies) 
Upon consideration of the documents filed on October 13, 
2023, which we construe as a petition for writ of mandamus, and 
the record, a writ of mandamus is not intended to be used to   
       
       supersede the circuit court’s discretion when ruling on pending 
matters before it, nor be used in lieu of normal appellate 
procedures. See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawaiʻ i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 
334, 338-39 (1999). 
An extraordinary writ is not warranted. 
It is ordered that the petition is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai i, November 17, 2023.
