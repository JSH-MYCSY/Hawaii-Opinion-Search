ORIGINAL PROCEEDING

ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, and Eddins, JJ., 
Circuit Judge Remigio and Circuit Judge Souza, 
assigned by reason of vacancies) 
 
Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of mandamus, 
filed on October 16, 2023 (Petition), the documents attached and 
submitted in support, and the record, Petitioner Catherine M. 
Shyne failed to establish a “clear and indisputable right to the 
relief requested and a lack of other means to redress adequately Electronically Filed

 the alleged wrong or to obtain the requested action.”  See Kema 
v. Gaddis, 91  200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999).   Hawaiʻi
 Here, depending on the outcome of the hearings in the 
underlying post-judgment proceeding it appears Petitioner could 
pursue normal appellate procedures to challenge any purported 
error by the circuit court.  See e.g., Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 
Hawaiʻi 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003) (discussing post-
judgment orders and when they may be appealed); Harada v. Ellis, 
60 Haw. 467, 480, 591 P.2d 1060, 1070 (1979) (discussing the 
collateral order doctrine and contempt).  It is well-established 
that a petition for writ of mandamus is not meant to serve as a 
legal remedy in lieu of normal appellate procedure.  See Kema, 
91 Hawaiʻ i at 204, 982 P.2d at 338.   
 Next, based on a review of the record it cannot be said 
that the circuit court committed a flagrant and manifest abuse 
of discretion in scheduling the hearing dates at the same time.  
Here, a number of hearings related to the debtor examination 
occurred before the upcoming October 25, 2023 hearing, yet despite receiving notice of these hearings through the Judiciary 
Electronic Filing System (JEFS), counsel for Petitioner failed 
to appear.  See Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of 
Hawaiʻi, Rule 15(b) (“Expedition of Court Business”); see also 
Electronic Filing and Service Rules, Rule 6 (“The Notice of 
Electronic Filing automatically generated by JEFS and JIMS 3 
 constitutes service of the electronically filed document to JEFS 
Users.”).  In short, as to this ground and based on the 
circumstances raised by Petitioner, we decline to entertain the 
petition. 
 In sum, none of the arguments made by Petitioner support 
the issuance of the requested writ.  In so holding, we do not 
decide any question as to the merits.   
The burden was on Petitioner to establish the extraordinary 
circumstances to warrant mandamus.  We find that Petitioner failed to carry this burden.   
It is ordered that the Petition is denied.
