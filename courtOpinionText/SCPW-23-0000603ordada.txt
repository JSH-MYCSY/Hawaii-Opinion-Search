SCPW-23-0000603 
 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻ I 
IN RE KAIPOLANI ELIZABETH IAEA 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
 
 ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Eddins, J., Circuit Judge Cahill, in place of 
McKenna, J., recused, Circuit Judge Kawamura and Circuit Judge 
Remigio, assigned by reason of vacancies) 
Upon consideration of the submissions from Petitioner 
Kaipolani Elizabeth Iaea, filed with this court on October 23, 
2023 as a petition for a writ of mandamus, and the record, we 
conclude the Petitioner failed to establish a clear and 
indisputable right to the relief requested, and a lack of other 
means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or obtain the 
requested action. See Kema v. Gaddis , 91 Hawaiʻi 200, 204–05, 
982 P.2d 334, 338–39 (1999). 
It is ordered: 
1. The petition is denied.   
 2. With respect to the sealed court filings at Docket 1, 
Docket 2, and Docket 8, the appellate clerk shall file a 
redacted version of these documents on the public record by 
redacting the “Personal Information” including the social 
security numbers and dates of birth in conformance with the 
definition of “Personal Information” in Rule 2.19 of the Hawaiʻ i 
Court Records Rules. In addition, the appellate clerk shall 
redact the copies of the letters from the Social Security 
Administration, the Petitioner’s social security card, and the 
Petitioner’s driver license, on the basis that the Petitioner’s 
personal information is identified on these records. We also 
find that Docket 1, page 2, paragraph 5 include reference to the petitioner’s health and medical information, and to protect the 
confidentiality of this information the first four-words and 
date identified immediately after the paragraph 5 designation 
shall be redacted. See, e.g., Pac. Radiation Oncology, LLC v.
Queen’s Med. Ctr., 138 Hawaiʻ i 14, 19, 375 P.3d 1252, 1257 (2016) 
(discussing the constitutional right to privacy). 
The clerk shall file the redacted versions of Docket 1, 
Docket 2, and Docket 8 on the record in this case as new 
filings, and for the reasons stated above Docket 1, Docket 2, 
and Docket 8 shall remain sealed. Any individual may file a 
motion objecting to the sealing of these documents. 
2   
 
       
       
       
              3. The appellate clerk shall process the petition without 
payment of the filing fee, and the filing fees collected in this 
proceeding shall be refunded. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, December 1, 2023.
