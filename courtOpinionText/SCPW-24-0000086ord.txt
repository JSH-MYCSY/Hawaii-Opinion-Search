IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻ I 
  
JIN QUAN YANG, Petitioner, 
 
vs. 
 
THE HONORABLE MICHELLE L. DREWYER, 
Judge of the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit, 
State of Hawaiʻ i, Respondent Judge, 
 
and 
 
PACIFIC HAWAII FOOD SERVICE LLC, Respondent. 
  
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 2CCV-22-0000181) 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Eddins, Ginoza, and Devens, JJ.) 
 
Upon consideration of petitioner Jin Quan Yang’s February 
12, 2024 petition for writ of mandamus (Petition) to recuse the 
respondent judge from Civil No. 2CCV-22-0000181, and the record, 
we conclude that mandamus relief is not warranted.   
Here, Petitioner by timely appeal may raise this same 
grievance.  See Hawai
ʻi Revised Statutes § 641-1(a) (2016).  Electronically Filed

 Consequently, Petitioner’s case is not one in which the question 
of disqualification cannot otherwise be reviewed, and immediate 
review by way of mandamus is not warranted.  See Womble Bond 
Dickinson (US) LLP v. Kim, 153 Hawaiʻ i 307, 319, 537 P.3d 1154, 
1166 (2023) (requiring a petitioner seeking an extraordinary 
writ to “demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to the 
relief requested and a lack of other means to redress adequately 
the alleged wrong or to obtain the requested action” (cleaned 
up)); Peters v. Jamieson, 48 Haw. 247, 257, 397 P.2d 575, 582-83 
(1964) (“[A] writ of prohibition will lie to compel a trial judge to recuse . . . because of bias or prejudice which appears 
from the record, where . . . the case is one in which the question of disqualifications cannot otherwise be reviewed.”). 
The Petition made several other requests for relief, none 
of which we find warrant further review by mandamus.  In sum, 
none of Petitioner’s arguments support the issuance of the 
requested writ.  In so holding, we do not decide any question as 
to the merits. 
The burden was on Petitioner to establish the extraordinary 
circumstances to warrant mandamus.  We find that Petitioner 
failed to carry this burden.  See Hawai
ʻi Rules of Appellate 
Procedure, Rule 21(c) (“If the court is of the opinion that the 
writ should not be entertained, it shall deny the petition.”).  Petitioner’s grievances may be pursued by appeal, rather than by 3 
 resort to this court’s original jurisdiction for extraordinary 
writs. 
It is ordered that the Petition is denied.
