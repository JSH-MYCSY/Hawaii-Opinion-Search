ORIGINAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITIONS FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna,  Ginoza,  and Eddins, JJ.,  
and Circuit Judge  Kawamura, in place of Devens, J., recused)  
Upon consideration of the petitions for a writ of mandamus 
filed in SCPW-24-0000183 on March 20, 2024, SCPW-24-0000330 on 
April 24, 2024, and SCPW-24-0000655 on October 8, 2024, and the records of these SCPW cases and other cases,
1 Petitioners have 
repeatedly sought extraordinary relief from this court concerning the same case (5CCV-22-0000027). In these prior petitions, Petitioners have repeatedly levied accusations of bias, discrimination, and retaliation against Judge Valenciano. 
This court has denied those petitions. See SCPW-23-0000056 
docket 16; SCPW-23-0000441 docket 14; SCPW-23-0000711 docket 37. 
1 5CCV-22-0000027, 5CCV- 24-0000097, CAAP- 24-0000014, CAAP- 24-
0000015, SCPW- 23-0000056, SCPW- 23-0000441, and SCPW- 23-0000711. 
2  The petitions filed in this consolidated proceeding is more 
of the same against Judge Valenciano and concerning the same 
case, 5CCV-22-0000027. Except Petitioners have now levied similar accusations against the Attorney General of the State of 
Hawaiʻi and the Judges of the Intermediate Court of Appeals. We 
deny the requested writs in these three SCPW cases. 
In SCPW-24-0000183, whether an investigation and 
prosecution should occur is discretionary for the Attorney 
General of the State of Hawaiʻ i. See State v. Yokota, 143 
Hawaiʻi 200, 206, 426 P.3d 424, 430 (2018). An extraordinary 
writ is not used to interfere with the discretionary authority of a public official. SeeBarnett v. Broderick, 84 Hawaiʻ i 109, 
111, 929 P.2d 1359, 1361 (1996); Salling v. Moon, 76 Hawaiʻ i 273, 
274 n.3, 874 P.2d 1098, 1099 n.3 (1994). 
In SCPW-24-0000330, Petitioners seek an extraordinary writ 
against three Judges of the Intermediate Court of Appeals that, among other things, accuse them of not following the Hawaiʻ i 
Revised Code of Judicial Conduct and being “complicit to the 
crime of” fraud and “theft of $50,000 perpetrated by Judge Valenciano” because these Judges have not corrected an alleged “Appellate Court Clerk Fraud” and have not reported alleged judicial and attorney fraud. 
We deny the requested writ. See
Womble Bond Dickinson (US) LLP v. Kim, 153 Hawaiʻ i 307, 319, 537 
3  
 
 
 
 P.3d 1154, 1166 (2023); see also Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes § 602 -
59 (2016 & Supp. 2017); Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
40.1 (eff. 2023). 
In SCPW-24-0000655, Petitioners again seek a writ that 
vacates Judge Valenciano’s various orders in 5CCV-22-0000027, including the contempt order. 
The same issues were raised in 
other SCPW cases, including SCPW-23-0000711. We again deny the requested writ. 
It is ordered: 1. The petitions for writ of mandamus filed in SCPW-24-
0000183, SCPW-24-0000330, and SCPW-24-0000655 are denied. 
2. With the exception of a single motion for 
reconsideration of this order, if any, the appellate clerk shall not accept further filings from Petitioners in this consolidated proceeding. 
3. The requests to proceed in forma pauperis are denied 
as moot. 
4. The motions filed at dockets 57 and 71 of SCPW-24-
0000183, dockets 8 and 22 of SCPW-24-0000330, and dockets 27, 47, 49, and 51 of SCPW-24-0000655 are denied. See Womble
, 153 
Hawaiʻi at 319, 537 P.3d at 1166.

       5. The motion filed at docket 75 of SCPW-24-0000183 is 
denied because the consolidation order speaks for itself.
