SCPW-24-0000356 
 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAII 
IN RE THOMAS SCHMIDT 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Eddins,  Ginoza,  and Devens,  JJ.)  
On May 6, 2024, Petitioner Thomas Schmidt filed a letter 
requesting to be removed from the vexatious litigant list which 
was docketed as a petition for writ of mandamus (Petition). 
Citing to Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 634J-7 (2016), Schmidt 
contends he is entitled to be removed from the vexatious 
litigant list maintained by the clerk of the supreme court because he has not initiated a lawsuit for fifteen years. 
The court takes judicial notice of the vexatious litigant 
list marked “Updated: 08/29/2024” which is available on the Judiciary’s website at 
https://www.courts.state.hi.us/ under the   
    
   
   
   
   
 
  “Legal References” menu at “Vexatious Litigants.”  On this list, 
Schmidt is referenced as a vexatious litigant as follows: 
Name of Litigant: Court – Order was Filed in: Case Number: 
Schmidt, Thomas F. Third Circuit Court (Kona) Civ 03-1-0038K 
Schmidt, Thomas Third Circuit Court (Kona) Civ 04-1-0004K 
Schmidt, Tom Third Circuit Court Admin Order 
Schmidt, Thomas F. Third Circuit Court Civ 03-1-0038K 
We disagree with Schmidt’s interpretation of Chapter 634J 
of the Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes. We are not persuaded that a 
prefiling order entered by a court under HRS § 634J-7 which does not expire on its own terms, would otherwise lose effect because the person declared a vexatious litigant, by virtue of the passage of time, no longer meets the statutory definition of “vexatious litigant” set forth at HRS § 634J-1 (2016). 
In order for Schmidt to establish that he is entitled to 
removal from the vexatious litigant list maintained by the clerk 
of the supreme court, the burden is on Schmidt to establish that 
any order declaring him a vexatious litigant has been set aside, or is no longer in effect. 
Based on the information submitted 
by Schmidt, we are not persuaded that Schmidt has established a clear and indisputable right to the relief requested. 
We deny the petition without prejudice. Any future request 
by Schmidt addressed to this court that requests his removal from the vexatious litigant list shall be filed by the clerk of 
2   
       
              
       
      the supreme court in this case. The filing fee for the petition 
is waived.
