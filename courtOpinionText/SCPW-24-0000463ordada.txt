SCPW-24-0000463 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻ I 
DONALD JEFFRIES, Petitioner, 
vs. 
OFFICE OF DISCIPLINARY COUNSEL, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Eddins,  Ginoza,  and Devens,  JJ.)  
Upon consideration of Petitioner’s letter filed on 
July 8, 2024, which we construe as a petition for writ of 
mandamus, and the record, it is within the discretion of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) to investigate and dismiss complaints brought before it. See
 Rules of the Supreme Court of 
the State of Hawaiʻi (RSCH) Rule 2.6(b)(2) (2022); 
In re 
Disciplinary Bd. of Hawaiʻi Sup. Ct.
, 91 Hawaiʻi 363, 984 P.2d 
688 (1999). This record does not reflect an abuse of that 
discretion. See Disciplinary Bd.
, 91 Hawaiʻi at 371, 984 P.2d at 
696.   
       
       It is ordered that the petition is denied. We note that dockets 1, 2, and 3 have been sealed because 
they contain ODC letters that are confidential pursuant to RSCH 
Rule 2.22. See Disciplinary Bd., 91 Hawaiʻ i at 363 n.1, 984 P.2d 
at 688 n.1. The appellate clerk shall refile dockets 1, 2, and 
3 without the confidential ODC letters and with the names of the respondent attorneys in the disciplinary proceeding redacted. 
The appellate clerk shall also seal dockets 8, 10, 12, 14, 
and 18 because they contain the names of the respondent attorneys in the disciplinary proceeding. 
The appellate clerk 
shall refile dockets 8, 10, 12, 14, and 18 in new docket numbers that redact the names of the respondent attorneys. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai i, January 2, 2025.
