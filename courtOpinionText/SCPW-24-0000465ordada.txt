SCPW-24-0000465 
 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻI 
IN RE BONNY N. EVANS, Petitioner. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.  J., McKenna, E  ddins, Ginoza,  and  Devens, JJ.)  
Upon consideration of petitioner Bonny N. Evans’s (1) July 
8, 2024 Petition for Writ of Mandamus, (2) July 8, 2024 request 
to proceed in forma pauperis, (3) July 24, 2024 correspondence, 
which the court construes as a motion (July 24, 2024 motion), 
(4) August 16, 2024 Motion for Limited Remand, (5) August 18, 
2024 Motion to Stay Parallel Proceedings; (6) August 22, 2024 
motion, which we construe as seeking a writ of mandamus (August 22, 2024 petition), and the record, 
We conclude that petitioner fails to demonstrate 
entitlement to the mandamus relief requested in the July 8, 2024 
petition and August 22, 2024 petition. See Womble Bond
Dickinson (US) LLP v. Kim
, 153 Hawaiʻi 307, 319, 537 P.3d 1154, 
1166 (2023) (requiring a petitioner seeking an extraordinary        
            
      
      
 writ to demonstrate “a clear and indisputable right to the 
relief requested and a lack of other means to redress adequately 
the alleged wrong or to obtain the requested action” (citation 
omitted)). Additionally, Petitioner’s August 16, 2024 Motion 
for Limited Remand does not specifically seek relief from this 
court. 
It is ordered that: 1. The petitioner’s request to proceed in forma pauperis 
is granted, and the appellate clerks’ office shall process the 
petitions without payment of the filing fee. 
2. The July 8, 2024 petition and August 22, 2024 petition 
are denied. 
3. The July 24, 2024 motion is denied as moot. 
4. The August 18, 2024 motion is denied. 
5. The August 16, 2024 Motion for Limited Remand is 
dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, September 23, 2024.
