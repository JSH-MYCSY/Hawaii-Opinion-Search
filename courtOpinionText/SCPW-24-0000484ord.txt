vs. 
 
THE HONORABLE JAMES S. KAWASHIMA

Respondents. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 1CCV-19-0002164) 
ORDER 
(By: McKenna, Acting C.J., Eddins, Ginoza,  and  Devens, JJ.,  
and Circuit Judge Tomasa, assigned by reason of vacancy)  
Petitioner Civil Beat Law Center for the Public Interest 
(Law Center) petitions for mandamus to unseal the docket and 
complaint of a sealed civil case file. The case was originally 
filed as a publicly accessible non-confidential civil case.   Shortly after the complaint was filed, the parties settled, and 
the circuit court approved a stipulation to seal the entire case 
docket, including the complaint, from public access. 
The Law Center filed a motion to unseal the docket and 
complaint, which was denied by the circuit court without the 
entry of any findings to explain the reasoning for the decision. 
This original proceeding followed. 
We grant the petition in part and mandamus the circuit 
court to unseal the docket and complaint. 
I. 
On November 18, 2019, Plaintiff M.K. filed a complaint 
against S. Lawrence Schlesinger, M.D., and a business entity 
owned by him (Defendants) for various tort claims. 
No return of service was filed by Plaintiff, nor was an 
answer filed by Defendants. 
On December 10, 2019, a Stipulation to Seal all Filings and 
Notice of Dismissal, by and between Plaintiff and Defendants was submitted to court. This stipulation directed the clerk to 
close and seal the case file, including the complaint. Judge 
Gary W.B. Chang approved and so ordered this stipulation thereby 
sealing the case file. 
In December 2023 an attorney for the Law Center requested 
access to the case file at the courthouse, which was denied. 
Thereafter, the Law Center filed a motion to unseal, arguing the 
2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 total sealing violated the right of public access protected by 
the First Amendment of the Constitution and article I, section 4 
of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution.  The Law Center further argued the 
total sealing violated the procedural and substantive 
requirements established in case law the circuit court was 
required to follow before denying public access to the complaint 
and docket of a civil case. 
On May 28, 2024, Judge Chang held an evidentiary hearing 
that was closed to the public; the Law Center did not 
participate. Shortly after this hearing, Judge Chang retired. 
On June 21, 2024, Judge James S. Kawashima entered the 
Order Denying the Law Center’s Motion to Unseal. This denial order provides: 
The Court has carefully reviewed the Motion, the Memorandum 
in Support of the Motion, and the Opposition to the Motion, 
the Declaration and Exhibit, and the filings in this case. 
The Court ordered that: 1) The Complaint be amended to delete those words which the 
Court deemed scandalous pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure; 
2) The Amended Complaint and the entire previously sealed 
pleadings remain sealed; 
3) The redacted Complaint be made available to the Civil 
Beat Law Center. 
The Court, having reviewed all documents submitted and 
having heard the arguments of counsel, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT CIVIL BEAT LAW CENTER’S MOTION TO UNSEAL IS DENIED. 
On July 22, 2024, the Law Center initiated this original 
proceeding, filing a petition seeking a writ of prohibition 
3  
 
 
 prohibiting the circuit court from enforcing any order to seal 
the case, and a writ of mandamus ordering the circuit court to 
comply with the constitutional standards set forth in Oahu 
Publ’ns Inc. v. Ahn, 133 Hawaiʻ i 482, 331 P.3d 460 (2014) and 
Grube v. Trader, 142 Hawaiʻ i 412, 420 P.3d 343 (2018), and the 
standards for scandalous allegations under Hawaiʻ i 
Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 12(f) (eff. 2000). 
The court entered an order to entertain the petition and 
requested briefing from the parties. In opposition, Defendants 
argue a case “never was at issue” because they settled before 
they knew a civil complaint had been filed. Defendants further 
argue that the settlement agreement afforded the parties privacy 
by requiring the total sealing of the civil case, which are 
“rare and compelling circumstances” to justify the total 
sealing. Respondent Judge filed a notice that no response would 
be filed. 
II. 
Rule 10.15 of the Hawaiʻ i Court Records Rules (eff. 2022) 
provides, in pertinent part, that “[a] person or entity may seek review of a denial or grant of access to a record by petitioning 
the supreme court” under 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 21, Writs of Mandamus or Prohibition Directed to a Judge 
(eff. 2010). 
4 A writ of mandamus or prohibition is an extraordinary 
remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner demonstrates a 
clear and indisputable right to the relief requested and a lack 
of other means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or to 
obtain the requested action. See Womble Bond Dickinson (US) LLP
v. Kim, 153 Hawaiʻ i 307, 319, 537 P.3d 1154, 1166 (2023). 
III. 
This court has discretion under its supervisory 
jurisdiction, Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes § 602-4 (2016), and 
Hawaiʻi Court Records Rules 10.15, to review the circuit court’s 
decision to deny the Law Center, a non-party, access to the 
docket and complaint. 
IV. 
The total sealing of a civil case file that is publicly 
accessible implicates the public’s right of access to court 
records under article I, section 4 of the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution.  
See Roy v. Gov’t Emps. Ins. Co., 152 Hawaiʻ i 225, 233, 524 P.3d 
1249, 1257 (App. 2023); see also Oahu Publ’ns Inc., 133 Hawaiʻ i 
at 496 n.18, 331 P.3d at 474 n.18 (noting the public’s interest 
in open civil proceedings). Cf. Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v.
Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 580 n.17 (1980) (noting that historically civil trials “have been presumptively open”); 
Courthouse News Serv. v. Planet, 947 F.3d 581, 590 (9th Cir. 
2020) (similar). 
5   “To overcome the presumption of public access, procedural 
and substantive requirements must be met.” State v. Rogan, 156 
Hawaiʻi 233, 243, 573 P.3d 616, 626 (2025). “The procedural 
requirements are (1) those objecting to sealing must be given a 
reasonable opportunity to be heard; and (2) the reasons that 
support sealing must be articulated in findings.” Id.
The issue in this original proceeding focuses on the second 
prong. The Law Center argues the circuit court failed to follow 
these procedural requirements because the sealing orders did not 
include any of the written findings required by this Court’s 
precedent recognizing the public’s right of access to court 
records under article I, section 4 of the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution.  
In opposition, Defendants argue that written findings were not 
required, and that the oral findings made by the presiding judge at the evidentiary hearing were sufficient. 
We agree with the Law Center. Here, the record confirms that no written findings were 
made by the circuit court to justify the total sealing of the case file, including the docket and complaint. Specifically, no 
written findings were entered to establish “(1) the sealing 
serves a compelling interest that overcomes the right of public 
access to the records; (2) there is a substantial probability 
that this interest would be harmed absent the closure or sealing; and (3) there are no alternatives to closure or sealing 
6   that would adequately protect the compelling interest.” Id. at 
243, 573 P.3d at 626. Accordingly, we hold the circuit court 
erred by sealing the docket and complaint. 
V. 
We grant the Law Center’s petition for a writ of mandamus 
in part and order the circuit court to unseal the docket and complaint filed at Docket 1, subject to the stay set forth 
below. 
Any further order to seal a record in the case must comply 
with the constitutional standards set forth in Rogan, detailed 
above. See also Grube, 142 
Hawaiʻi at 425, 420 P.3d at 356 
(“Although privacy rights may in some instances rise to the 
level of compelling, simply preserving the comfort or official 
reputations of the parties is not a sufficient justification.”); 
Roy, 152 Hawai
ʻi at 234-35, 524 P.3d at 1258-59 (affirming the 
circuit court’s decisions to unseal a case file because “GEICO 
has not demonstrated that there are no less restrictive 
alternatives to closure that would adequately protect any 
compelling interest”) (cleaned up). 
We deny the Law Center’s petition for a writ of prohibition 
insofar as it seeks an order prohibiting the circuit court from 
enforcing any order to seal the docket and complaint, and for a 
writ of mandamus ordering the circuit court to comply with Rule 
7  
 
  
 
   
 12(f) of the Hawaiʻ i Rules of Civil Procedure because we deem 
this relief unnecessary based on our disposition. 
The court will stay the effective date of this order to 
Wednesday, February 4, 2026. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, January
  5, 2026.
