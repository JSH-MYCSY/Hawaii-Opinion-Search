SCPW-24-0000485 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻ I 
SILAS VALDEZ, Petitioner, 
 
vs. 
 
THE HONORABLE ROWENA A. SOMERVILLE, 
Judge of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, 
State of Hawaiʻ i, Respondent Judge, 
 
and 
 
STATE OF HAWAI 
ʻI, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 1CPN-23-0000023) 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION WITHOUT PREJUDICE 
(By: Recktenwald , C.J., M cKenna, Eddins,  Ginoza, and Devens,  JJ.)  
 Upon consideration of the letter filed on July 22, 2024, 
which we construe as a petition for a writ of mandamus, and the 
record, the amount of time that has passed without court action 
does not amount to a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, 
nor a refusal to act on a subject before the court under 
circumstances in which the court has a legal duty to act. An   
       
       
 extraordinary writ is unwarranted. SeeWomble Bond Dickinson 
(US) LLP v. Kim, 153 Hawaiʻ i 307, 319, 537 P.3d 1154, 1166 
(2023). 
It is ordered that the petition is denied without 
prejudice. 
It is further ordered that the appellate clerk shall serve 
a copy of the July 22, 2024 letter and this order on the 
Respondent Judge. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, August 30, 2024.
