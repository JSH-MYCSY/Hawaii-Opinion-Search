SCPW-24-0000638 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻI 
QIN LI, Petitioner,  
 
vs. 
 
DAMIEN A. ELEFANTE, Chairperson, 
Department of Labor & Industrial Relations Appeals Board, 
State of Hawaiʻi, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. AB 2022-015; DCD NO. 2-16-40740) 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald , C.J., M cKenna, Eddins,  Ginoza, and Devens,  JJ.)  
Upon consideration of Petitioner’s “motion” to disqualify 
Respondent from presiding over a workers’ compensation case, 
filed October 1, 2024, and the record, we construe the motion as 
a petition for writ of mandamus. Construed as such, a writ of 
mandamus is unwarranted because this issue is more appropriately 
addressed on appeal rather than through an extraordinary writ  
 directed to a public official.  See Barnett v. Broderick, 84 
Hawaiʻi 109, 111, 929 P.2d 1359, 1361 (1996); Salling v. Moon, 76 
Hawaiʻi 273, 274 n.3, 874 P.2d 1098, 1099 n.3 (1994). 
It is ordered that the petition is denied. 
We note that dockets 2, 3, 10, 12, and 14 have been sealed 
because they contain documents with birthdates, social security 
numbers, the name of an attorney that was the subject of an Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) complaint, as well as a 
letter from ODC concerning the outcome of the ODC complaint 
(docket 12). The attorney’s name and the letter are 
confidential pursuant to Rule 2.22 of the Rules of the Supreme 
Court of the State of 
Hawaiʻi. Se
e In re Disciplinary Bd. of
Hawaiʻi Sup. Ct.
, 91 Hawaiʻi 363, 363 n.1, 984 P.2d 688, 688 n.1 
(1999). Social security numbers and birthdates are confidential 
personal information pursuant to Rules 2.19 and 9.1 of the 
Hawaiʻi Court Records Rules. 
The appellate clerk shall seal docket 1 because docket 1 
consists of documents that were submitted to ODC and contain the 
name of the same attorney. See
 RSCH Rule 2.22; Disciplinary
Bd.
, 91 Hawaiʻi at 363 n.1, 984 P.2d at 688 n.1. 
The appellate clerk shall refile redacted versions of 
dockets 1, 2, 3, 10, and 14 that redacts the name of the 
2  
  
       
       attorney in the ODC complaint, social security numbers, and 
birthdates. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, April 11 , 2025.
