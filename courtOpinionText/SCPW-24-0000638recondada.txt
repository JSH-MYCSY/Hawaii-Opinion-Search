SCPW-24-0000638 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻI 
QIN LI, Petitioner,  
 
vs. 
 
DAMIEN A. ELEFANTE, Chairperson, 
Department of Labor & Industrial Relations Appeals Board, 
State of Hawaiʻi, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. AB 2022-015; DCD NO. 2-16-40740) 
 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION 
(By: Recktenwald , C.J., M cKenna, Eddins,  Ginoza, and Devens,  JJ.)  
Upon consideration of the motion for reconsideration filed 
on April 21, 2025, which seeks reconsideration of this court’s 
April 11, 2025 order denying the petition for writ of mandamus, 
and the record, this court has not overlooked or misapprehended 
points of law or fact. See Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 40(b) (2000). 
It is ordered that the motion is denied.  
  
       
       However, we add that our denial of the petition for writ of 
mandamus does not prevent Petitioner from seeking relief in the 
Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board. Nor does the 
denial of the petition prevent Petitioner from seeking review of 
the issues raised in this petition on appeal in the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals, as appropriate. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, April 23 , 2025.
