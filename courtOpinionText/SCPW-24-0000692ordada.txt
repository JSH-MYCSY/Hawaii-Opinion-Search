SCPW-24-0000692 
 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻI 
SANDEE KIM VILLEZA and BRENT IAN VILLEZA, 
Petitioners, 
 
vs. 
 
THE HONORABLE DEAN E. OCHIAI, 
Judge of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, 
State of Hawaiʻi, Respondent Judge, 
 
and

Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 1CCV-22-0001614) 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF PROHIBITION 
(By: Recktenwald, C.  J., McKenna, E  ddins,  Ginoza,  and Devens,  JJ.)  
Upon consideration of Petitioners Sandee Kim Villeza and 
Brent Ian Villeza’s petition for writ of prohibition filed 
October 22, 2024, and the record,  
  
       
       
       
       
      The court finds that Petitioners are seeking to relitigate 
issues that were previously raised and addressed in Villeza v. 
Judge Castagnetti, SCPW-23-0000373. The petition filed in SCPW-
23-0000373 requested essentially identical relief to the instant 
petition. 
The petition filed October 22, 2024 is denied on the ground 
that the merits of this original proceeding were conclusively 
determined on August 15, 2023 when this court entered its order denying petitioners’ motion for reconsideration in SCPW-23-
0000373. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, January 17, 2025.
