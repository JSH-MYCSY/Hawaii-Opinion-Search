Upon consideration of the petition for writ of mandamus or 
prohibition filed on November 13, 2024, the motion for stay 
pending appeal filed on November 29, 2024, and the record, Petitioner has not demonstrated that an extraordinary writ is 
warranted because an extraordinary writ is not meant to be used 
in lieu of normal appellate procedures. SeeWomble Bond

Petitioner has also not demonstrated that a stay is 
warranted. See Stop Rail Now v. DeCosta, 120 Hawaiʻ i 238, 243, 
203 P.3d 658, 663 (App. 2008). 
It is ordered that the petition and motion for stay pending 
appeal are denied.
