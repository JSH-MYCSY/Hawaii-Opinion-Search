Supreme Court SCPW-25-0000035 19-FEB-2025 10:45 AM Dkt. 8 ODDP 
SCPW-25-0000035 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻI 
IN RE SHEENA KEKONA-CRAMER 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Eddins,  Ginoza,  and Devens, JJ.)  
On January 21, 2025, Petitioner Sheena Kekona-Cramer 
submitted letters to court, which were filed as a petition for 
writ of mandamus, seeking review of the Hawai iʻ Paroling 
Authority’s (HPA) decision to deny parole (petition). Petitioner 
claimed the reason the HPA denied her parole was because it did 
not believe she was ready for release. Petitioner further 
claimed the denial of parole was a form of punishment. 
We d
ecline to entertain the petition. See Hawaiʻ i Ru
les of 
Appellate Procedure, Rule 21 (c) (eff. 2010). 
In g
eneral, mandamus relief is not available where the 
petitioner has alternative means to obtain the requested relief.    
 
   
     
 
    
   
 
   
     
  See Womble Bond Dickinson (US) LLP v. Kim, 153 Hawaiʻ i 307, 319, 
537 P.3d 1154, 1166 (2023) (providing that a petition for 
mandamus relief must establish a clear and indisputable right to the relief requested and a lack of other means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or to obtain the requested action.). 
Here, Petitioner has alternative means to seek the requested 
relief. First, Petitioner may seek relief directly from the 
HPA. Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes § 706-670(4) (2014 & Supp. 2022) 
provides, in pertinent part, for the HPA in its discretion to 
order a reconsideration or rehearing of a case at any time. We 
note that Petitioner claims she has already attempted to seek reconsideration from the HPA. However, Petitioner may also seek 
review of a HPA decision to deny parole by filing a petition for 
relief under Rule 40 of the Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRP
P) in the Second Circuit Court. See Willia
mson v. Hawaiʻ i 
Paroling Auth., 97 Hawaiʻ i 183, 1 94, 35 P.3d 210, 221 (2001).  In 
evaluating a HRPP Rule 40 petition seeking relief directed to the HPA, “judicial intervention is appropriate where the HPA has 
failed to exercise any discretion at all, acted arbitrarily and capriciously so as to give rise to a due process violation, or otherwise violated the prisoner’s constitutional rights.” Id. 
at 
195, 35 P.3d at 222; see also Rapozo v. State, 150 Hawaiʻ i 66, 84, 
497 
P.3d 81, 99 (2021). 
2    
      
       
       
              For the reasons stated,  we d ecline to entertain  the 
petition.  The petition for a writ of mandamus is denied without 
prejudice. The clerk of the appellate court shall process the petition without payment of the filing fee.
