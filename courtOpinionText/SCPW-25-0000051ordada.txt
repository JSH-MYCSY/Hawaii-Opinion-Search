IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻI 
IN RE PAUL H. GANTT, 
Petitioner 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(Civil No. 5CC131000166) 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.  J., McKenna,  and Eddins,  JJ.;  
Circuit Judge Remigio,  in place of Gi  noza, J., recused, and  
Circuit Judge Morikone, i  n place of Devens, J., recused )  
On January 28, 2025, Petitioner submitted a letter which 
was filed as a petition for writ of mandamus. 
We are not 
persuaded that the petition has established a clear and 
indisputable right to the relief requested, nor a lack of alternative means to seek the relief requested. See Womble Bond
Dickinson (US) LLP v. Kim
, 153 Hawaiʻi 307, 319, 537 P.3d 1154, 
1166 (2023) (providing that a petition for mandamus relief must establish a clear and indisputable right to the relief requested      
       
       
       
       
       and a lack of other means to redress adequately the alleged 
wrong or to obtain the requested action.). 
The petition is denied. The clerk of the appellate court 
shall process the petition without payment of the filing fee. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, April 1, 2025.
