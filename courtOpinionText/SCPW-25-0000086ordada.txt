Dkt. 5 ODDP 
SCPW-25-0000086 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻI 
IN RE FRANCIS GRANDINETTI 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 3PC930000141) 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS WITHOUT PREJUDICE 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., M cKenna, Eddins,  Ginoza, and Devens,  JJ.)  
Upon consideration of the document filed February 13, 2025, 
which we construe as a petition for writ of mandamus, and the 
record, an extraordinary writ is unwarranted because Petitioner 
has not demonstrated a clear and indisputable right to relief. 
See Womble Bond Dickinson (US) LLP v. Kim
, 153 Hawaiʻi 307, 319, 
537 P.3d 1154, 1166 (2023). 
It is ordered that the petition is denied without prejudice 
to refiling should the circuit court not act on the documents 
that were filed by Petitioner in 3PC930000141.  
       
       
It is further ordered that the appellate clerk shall serve 
a copy of the petition and this order on the administrative 
judge of the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit. 
DATED: 
Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, July 9, 2025.
