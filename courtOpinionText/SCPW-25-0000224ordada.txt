(By:  Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Eddins,  Ginoza,  and Devens,  JJ.)  
Upon consideration of Petitioner Michael Noghrey’s petition 
for a writ of prohibition filed March 23, 2024, which requested 
an order directing the Respondent Judge to stay or vacate the 
decision to imprison the Petitioner for civil contempt 
(petition), the papers in support, and the records and files

 moot based on the Family Court’s decision and order filed March 
25, 2025 which stayed any further decision on the possible 
incarceration of Petitioner for civil contempt until after the 
disposition of the appeal filed in CAAP-24-0000831. See 
generally Application of Thomas, 73 Haw. 223, 225–26, 832 P.2d 253, 254 (1992) (discussing mootness doctrine). 
It is ordered that the petition is denied without prejudice 
as moot.
