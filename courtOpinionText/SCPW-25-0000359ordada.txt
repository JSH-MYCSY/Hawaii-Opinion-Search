SCPW-25-0000359 
 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻI 
CAMERON NICE and MARTHA NICE, 
Petitioners, 
 
vs. 
 
THE HONORABLE RANDAL G.B. VALENCIANO, 
Judge of the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit, 
State of Hawaiʻi, Respondent Judge, 
 
and 
 
THE HONORABLE ANNE E. LOPEZ, 
Attorney General, Department of the Attorney General, 
State of Hawaiʻ i, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 5CCV-24-0000097) 
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Eddins,  and Ginoza,  JJ.,  and  
Circuit Judge Remigio, in place of Devens, J., recused)  
Upon consideration of the petition for a writ of mandamus, 
filed on April 17, 2025 (Petition), the documents attached and 
submitted in support, and the record, Petitioners Cameron Nice 
and Martha Nice have failed to establish a “clear and 
indisputable right to the relief requested and a lack of other  
 
 
 
       
              
       
      means to redress adequately the alleged wrong or to obtain the 
requested action.” See Kema v. Gaddis, 91 Hawaiʻ i 200, 204, 982 
P.2d 334, 338 (1999). 
Petitioners have repeatedly sought extraordinary relief 
from this court concerning the same underlying case (5CCV-22-
0000027). This court has denied those petitions. See SCPW-23-
0000056 docket 16; SCPW-23-0000441 docket 14; SCPW-23-0000711 docket 37; SCPW-24-0000183 docket 85; SCPW-24-0000330 docket 40; 
SCPW-24-0000655 docket 57. 
The petition filed in this proceeding is more of the same. 
This time, Petitioners add allegations regarding Judge 
Valenciano’s January 22, 2025 order declaring Petitioners 
vexatious litigants pursuant to Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes § 634J-7 
(2016). 
None of the arguments made by Petitioner support the 
issuance of the requested writ. The burden was on Petitioners 
to establish the extraordinary circumstances to warrant 
mandamus. We find that Petitioners failed to carry this burden. 
It is ordered that the Petition is denied.
