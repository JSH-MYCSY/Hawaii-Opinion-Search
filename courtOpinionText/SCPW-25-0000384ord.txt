ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
ORDER DENYING PETITION WITHOUT PREJUDICE 
(By: McKenna, Acting C.J., Eddins, Ginoza, and Devens, JJ.,  
and Circuit Judge Hamman, assigned by reason of vacancy)  
Upon consideration of the petition for writ of mandamus or 
extraordinary writ, filed April 29, 2025, and the record, 
Petitioners have not shown there are any qualified candidates 
who are willing to serve on the Board of Registration for the 
island of Hawaiʻ i, the Governor is aware of these candidates, and 
the Governor has unreasonably refused to appoint a qualified candidate to the Board. See Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes § 11-41   
       
       (2009 & Supp. 2023); Hanabusa v. Lingle, 119 Hawaiʻ i 341, 350-52, 
198 P.3d 604, 613-15 (2008). An extraordinary writ is unwarranted at this time. See Womble Bond Dickinson (US) LLP v.
Kim, 153 
Hawaiʻi 307, 319, 537 P.3d 1154, 1166 (2023). 
It is ordered that the petition is denied without 
prejudice. 
DATED: 
Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, December 10, 2025.
