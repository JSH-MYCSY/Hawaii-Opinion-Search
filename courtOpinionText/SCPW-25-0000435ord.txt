SCPW-25-0000435 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻ I 
VICTORIA R. KORDA, Petitioner, 
 
v. 
 
THE HONORABLE KATHLEEN N.A. WATANABE, 
Judge of the Circuit Court, Fifth Circuit, 
State of 
Hawaiʻi, Respondent Judge, 
 
and 
 
STATE OF HAWAI
ʻI, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NOS. 5CPC-21-0000193; 5CPC-21-0000194) 
ORDER DISMISSING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS WITHOUT PREJUDICE 
(By: McKenna, Acting C.J., Eddins, Ginoza, and Devens, JJ.,  
and Circuit Judge Toʻotoʻo,  assigned  by reason of vacancy)  
Petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandamus on June 5, 
2025. Petitioner filed other documents after June 5, 2025. 
Upon review of these documents, it is difficult to discern the 
relief sought in this original proceeding. Additionally, the 
last document was filed on July 16, 2025, and appears to seek         
       dismissal of this case. Petitioner has not filed any other 
documents since the July 16, 2025 document. 
It is ordered that the petition is dismissed without 
prejudice to refiling, if necessary. The clerk shall process 
the petition without payment of the filing fees. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, February 6, 2026.
