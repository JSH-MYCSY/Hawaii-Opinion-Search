IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻI  
ROBERT H. HARDIN, JR., Petitioner, 
 
vs. 
 
THE HONORABLE ANNALISA M. BERNARD LEE, 
Judge of the District Court of the Second Circuit, 
State of Hawaiʻ i, Respondent Judge,

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY, Respondent. 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING 
(CASE NO. 2DSC-25-0000144) 
ORDER DISMISSING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS WITH PREJUDICE 
(By: McKenna, Acting C.J., Eddins, Ginoza, and Devens, JJ., 
and Circuit Judge Johnson, assigned by reason of vacancy ) 
A petition for writ of mandamus was filed in this case on 
November 18, 2025. Petitioner subsequently filed a notice of 
dismissal on December 8, 2025, that requests dismissal of the 
petition for writ of mandamus. Based on the record, we construe 
the December 8, 2025 notice as a motion to dismiss and grant the 
motion.   
       
       It is ordered that the petition is dismissed with 
prejudice. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai i, February 13, 2026.
