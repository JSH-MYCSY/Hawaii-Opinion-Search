RESERVED QUESTIONS FROM THE 
CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAIʻ I 
 
SEPTEMBER 2, 2022 
 
RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, WILSON, AND EDDINS, JJ.  
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J. 
 
I. 
 
First came the flood: on April 13, 2018, torrential rains 
pummeled O‘ ahu. 
Then came the lawsuit: plaintiff Hakim Ouansafi filed a 
class action lawsuit against the City and County of Honolulu 
(the City) in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.  Ouansafi 
said that the City’s failure to inspect and maintain its East 
Honolulu storm and drainage system (the Drainage System) was the 3 
 reason he, and other Honolulu residents like him, had been 
injured by the April 13, 2018 flood (the Flood). 
Ouansafi moved for class certification.  But before his 
motion was decided, he settled on an individual basis with the 
City.  The court denied class certification. 
After the denial of class certification, individuals 
affected by the Flood brought twelve separate actions against 
the City in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit.  Seven of those actions were assigned to Judge Dean Ochiai.  The City 
filed motions to dismiss in all seven.  It argued the suits were 
barred because they did not comply with HRS § 46-72’s (2012) 
two-year notice requirement. 
HRS § 46-72 requires plaintiffs seeking to recover damages 
from the City for personal injury or property damage caused by a 
City official or employee’s negligence to file a written notice 
of claim with the City no more than two years after their 
claim’s accrual.
1 
The plaintiffs argued their suits were timely because — 
with respect to claims arising from the Flood — HRS § 46-72’s statute of limitations was tolled between October 12, 2018 (when 
                                                           
1  HRS § 46- 72 also imposes the same two- year notice requirement on 
plaintiffs seeking to recover damages from the City for property damage or 
personal injury that occurred on “ any of the streets, avenues, alleys, 
sidewalks, or other public places of the county.”  HRS § 46- 72. 
 4 
 Ouansafi filed his class action) and June 23, 2021 (when the 
court denied class certification in Ouansafi’s suit). 
Alongside its motions to dismiss, the City also filed 
motions to reserve questions pursuant to Hawai‘ i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 15(a)2 in five of the cases before Judge 
Ochiai (the Individual Suits).  The City asked the trial court 
to reserve two questions of law to the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court for 
consideration: 
(1) Whether a class action complaint fails to satisfy the 
notice requirements of HRS § 46-72 because class action 
tolling does not apply to HRS § 46-72 ; and 
 (2) Whether class action tolling of the two- year statute of 
limitations in HRS § 657- 7 applies in the context of mass 
tort actions where a plaintiff is seeking personal damages 
such as emotional distress, and where the class 
representative’s motion for class certification is denied 
on all four required prongs, including commonality. 
 
The court granted the City’s motions to reserve questions.  
We accepted these reserved questions3 and resolve them as 
follows.   
First, we hold that class action tolling applies to HRS 
§ 46-72 and that a class action complaint may therefore satisfy 
the statute’s notice requirement. 
                                                           
2  See Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 15(a) (2010) (“A circuit 
court, the land court, the tax appeal court and any other court empowered by 
statute, may reserve for the consideration of the supreme court a question of 
law arising in any proceedings before it.  Questions may be reserved on 
motion of any party or on the court’ s own motion.  Reserved questions shall 
be electronically filed by the clerk of the court.”). 
 
3  Our order accepting reserved questions designated plaintiffs in Civil 
Nos. 1CCV- 21-0000655, 1CCV- 21-0000662, 1CCV- 21-0000672, 1CCV- 21-0000695, and 
1CCV-21-0000750 as Appellants in this case.  5 
 Second, we hold that the availability of class action 
tolling turns not on whether or not the class action is a “mass 
tort,” but rather on whether it provided the defendant notice of 
the subject matter and potential size of the litigation at 
issue.  We conclude that because the Ouansafi complaint 
satisfied these requirements, class action tolling applies to 
the Individual Suits. 
II. 
Under HRS § 46-72, plaintiffs seeking to recover damages 
for property loss or personal injuries from a county of the 
State of Hawai‘ i have two years from the time of their loss or 
injury to give the county written notice of their claim: 
Before the county shall be liable for damages to any person 
for injuries to person or property received upon any of the 
streets, avenues, alleys, sidewalks, or other public places 
of the county, or on account of any negligence of any 
official or employee of the county, the person injured, or 
the owner or person entitled to the possession, occupation, 
or use of the property injured, or someone on the person’ s 
behalf, within two years after the injuries accrued shall 
give the individual identified in the respective county’ s 
charter, or if none is specified, the chairperson of the 
council of the county or the clerk of the county in which 
the injuries occurred, notice in writing of the injuries 
and the specific damages resulting, stating fully when, 
where, and how the injuries or damage occurred, the extent 
of the injuries or damages, and the amount claimed. 
 
HRS § 46-72. 
 Though this statute “may appear to be a mere condition 
precedent to liability, it operates, in reality, as a statute of 
limitations.”  Silva v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 115 Hawai‘ i 1, 
10–11, 165 P.3d 247, 256–57 (2007) (cleaned up). 6 
  In Levi v. University of Hawaii, 67 Haw. 90, 679 P.2d 129 
(1984), we adopted the class action tolling rule announced in 
American Pipe and Construction Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538 (1974), 
and held “that the commencement of a class action suspends the 
applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of 
a class who would have been parties had the suit continued as a 
class action.”  Levi, 67 Haw. at 93, 679 P.2d at 132.4  “To hold 
otherwise,” we explained, “would be to encourage intervention 
and filings of separate actions in the event class certification 
might be denied, thus creating the multiplicity of actions that 
class suits were designed to avoid.”  Id. 
HRS § 46-72’s designation as a “notice” statute does not 
change the fact that it is effectively a statute of limitations. 
  at 10–11, 165 P.3d at 256–57.  And the See Silva, 115 Hawai‘ i
same policy considerations that informed our holding in Levi 
apply to suits subject to HRS § 46-72.  For this reason, we hold 
                                                           
4  In Levi, we adopted American Pipe’s class action tolling as clarified 
by Crown, Cork & Seal Co., Inc. v. Parker, 462 U.S. 345 (1983).  See 67 Haw. 
at 93–94, 679 P.2d at 132.  In Crown, Cork & Seal, the Court clarified that 
class action tolling applies not just to putative class members who intervene 
following the denial of class certification, but also to those who file 
individual actions.  462 U.S. at 350. 
 
 7 that the filing of a class action tolls HRS § 46-72 as to the 
named plaintiff and all members of the putative class.5
III. 
Our analysis of whether class action tolling is available 
to former members of a putative class turns on whether the class 
action suit provided defendants notice of “the essential 
information necessary to determine both the subject matter and 
size of the prospective litigation.”  See American Pipe, 414 
U.S. at 555.  Not on whether or not the class action can be 
characterized as a “mass tort.”   Cf. Stevens v. Novartis Pharm. 
Corp., 247 P.3d 244, 253 (Mont. 2010) (holding that mass torts 6
5In 2007, the legislature extended HRS § 46– 72’s limitations period from 
six months to “two years after the injuries accrued.”  See 2007 Haw. Sess. 
Laws Act 152, § 8 at 284-85.  This amendment conformed HRS § 46– 72’s 
limitations period with that of the “general” personal injury statute of 
limitations found in HRS § 657-7 (2016).  See Silva, 115 Hawai‘ i at 8 n.6, 165 
P.3d at 254 n.6.  Because HRS § 46- 72’s limitations period is now the same as
that of HRS § 657- 7, the City has no arguments available to it under HRS
§46–72 distinct from those available to other litigants under HRS § 657- 7.
The analysis as to any sort of tolling will be identical for HRS § 657- 7 and
HRS § 46- 72.
6This pragmatic approach to analyzing notice is consistent with the test 
we adopted in Oakley v. State for analyzing whether an individual who had 
given the City written notice of a claim had complied with HRS § 46- 72.  In 
Oakley, we explained: 
that whenever, under [HRS § 46-72], a person files a 
written notice of claim, as contrasted with an absolute 
failure to file any written notice of claim, the issue is 
not a question of non- compliance but a question of 
sufficiency of compliance under all the circumstances of 
the case.  The test to determine sufficiency of compliance 
then is whether the municipal officials have been misled to 
their prejudice, under all the circumstances of the case, 
by the written notice of claim filed.  If they have not 
been misled and prejudiced then the written notice of claim 
complies sufficiently with the requirements of the statute. 
54 Haw. 210, 217, 505 P.2d 1182, 1186 (1973).8 may be subject to class action tolling and explaining that 
“[w]hile we may later encounter a situation in which a class 
action suit does not afford sufficient notice to the defendants 
of subsequent plaintiffs’ claims, we do not believe we are faced 
with such an instance today”).7 
The Individual Suits share “a common factual and legal 
nexus” with the Ouansafi class action.  See Cowles v. Bank West, 
719 N.W.2d 94, 105 (Mich. 2006) (explaining that for class 
action tolling to apply “the subsequent individual claims must 
share a common factual and legal nexus to the extent that the 
defendant would likely rely on the same evidence or witnesses in 
mounting a defense”).  The Ouansafi suit and the Individual 
Suits are all factually concerned with damages caused by the 
Flood that they allege would not have occurred but for the 
City’s approach to maintaining and operating the Drainage 
System.  Legally, each of the Individual Suits asserts the same 
five claims against the City that the Ouansafi suit asserted: 
(1) negligence; (2) trespass; (3) violation of the Constitution
7See also Tosti v. City  of L.A., 754 F.2d 1485, 1489 (9th Cir. 
1985) (“We find no persuasive authority for a rule which would require that 
the individual suit must be identical in every respect to the class suit for 
the statute to be tolled.”); McCarthy v. Kleindienst, 562 F.2d 1269, 1275 
(D.C. Cir. 1977) (holding that a finding of typicality is not a prerequisite 
for American Pipe tolling and observing that “if the court can conclude that 
the defendant has received ‘the essential information necessary to determine 
both the subject matter and size of the prospective litigation,’ then the 
doctrine of American Pipe may be applied” (quoting American Pipe, 414 U.S. at 
555)). 9 of the State of Hawai‘ i, article I, section 20; (4) nuisance; and 
(5)negligent infliction of emotional distress.   Often, the
Individual Suits assert these claims in language that is highly
similar — if not nearly identical — to that of the Ouansafi
complaint.8
The close factual and legal similarities between the 
Ouansafi suit and the Individual Suits mean that there will be 
overlap between the evidence and witnesses the City would have 
relied on to defend against the Ouansafi suit and the evidence 
and witnesses it will rely on in defending against the 
Individual Suits.   
Because the Individual Suits and the Ouansafi suit share a 
common set of factual allegations and legal claims, we conclude 
that the Ouansafi suit provided the City notice of the subject 
matter of the prospective litigation.  Cf. Crown, Cork & Seal, 
462 U.S. at 355 (Powell, J., concurring) (“[W]hen a plaintiff 
invokes American Pipe in support of a separate lawsuit, the 
8For instance, paragraph 83 of the complaint  in Coles v. City and County 
of Honolulu, one of the Individual Suits, differs from paragraph 62 of the 
Ouansafi complaint only in that it: (1) calls the City “the City” (and not 
“the Defendant”) and; (2) refers to Plaintiffs’ “ properties” instead of “real 
properties:” 
As a direct and proximate result of the City’s design, 
failure to replace, operation, and/or maintenance of the 
Drainage System to exercise dominion over man- made and 
natural watercourses for the management and control of 
storm waters, Plaintiffs’ properties have been repeatedly 
subject to erosion, inundation, and invasion by storm 
waters, causing Plaintiffs to suffer damage because of the 
unreasonable activities and conduct of the City.
 10 district court should take care to ensure that the suit raises 
claims that concern the same evidence, memories, and witnesses 
as the subject matter of the original class suit, so that the 
defendant will not be prejudiced.” (Cleaned up.)) 
The Ouansafi complaint also gave the City notice of the 
composition and approximate size of the putative class.  It 
described the class Ouansafi sought to represent as “made up of 
residents of the City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawai ‘i, 
who, during the events related to [Ouansafi’s suit], owned and 
occupied properties and residences in East Honolulu that were 
damaged or destroyed by the flooding on and after April 13, 
2018.”  The complaint alleged that approximately 410 homes were 
damaged by the Flood and indicated that the State had confirmed  
damage to over 280 homes.  Collectively, this information 
notified the City of “the number and generic identities of the 
potential plaintiffs who may participate in [the Ouansafi 
suit’s] judgment.”  See American Pipe, 414 U.S. at 555. 
Because the Ouansafi complaint provided the City “the 
essential information necessary to determine both the subject 
matter and size of the prospective litigation,” see id., we 
conclude that it tolled the statute of limitations applicable to 
the Individual Suits. 11 
 IV. 
 We hold that class action tolling applies to HRS § 46-72 
and that it may apply in the context of mass tort actions so 
long as the class action provided the defendant notice of the 
subject matter and approximate size of the prospective 
litigation.
