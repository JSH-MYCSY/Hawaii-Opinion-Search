RECKTENWALD, C.J., McKENNA, EDDINS, JJ., 
CIRCUIT JUDGE KIM AND CIRCUIT JUDGE WATANABE, 
ASSIGNED BY REASON OF VACANCIES 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY EDDINS, J.  
   
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
I. 
This court accepted the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit’s reserved question: 
Does a subrogee insurance company, which timely  intervened 
pursuant to HRS §  386-8(b), have an  independent right to 
continue to pursue claims and/or  legal theories against a 
tortfeasor that were not  asserted by the subrogor employee, 
after summary  judgment has been granted against the 
subrogor  employee, on the subrogor employee’s claims?  
We answer Yes. 
There are three main reasons. First, an affirmative answer 
protects subrogation, which in turn protects indemnity. Second, 
a Yes answer aligns with Hawaiʻ i’s workers’ compensation 
subrogation law, 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-8 (2015 & 
Supp. 2016). Third, a No answer undermines employers’ and 
insurers’ intervention rights. 
We also address a claim preclusion argument. It does not 
alter our answer. 
II. 
The subrogee insurance company is Plaintiff-Intervenor 
Dongbu Insurance Co., Ltd. (Dongbu). 
The subrogor employee is 
Plaintiff Hyun Ju Park (Park). The alleged third-party tortfeasor is the City and County of Honolulu (the City). 
Park sued the City. Dongbu intervened. The City moved to 
dismiss all of Park’s claims and some Dongbu claims. The 
circuit court granted the motions. Two Dongbu claims remained. The circuit court’s reserved question asks whether intervenor 
2  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Dongbu may pursue its non-dismissed claims as a subrogee against 
the City. 
We detail the factual backdrop and procedural history. Park worked as a bartender at Kings Sports Bar & Grill in 
Honolulu. In April 2015, three off-duty Honolulu Police Department (HPD) officers went to that bar. One officer had 
several drinks and unholstered his HPD-authorized firearm. He 
tried to load it. But he couldn’t – the gun was already loaded. The other HPD officers watched but did nothing. While Park 
worked, the officer shot her. She nearly died. 
Park sued the City and County of Honolulu and the officers 
in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaiʻi. 
Under 42 United States Code § 1983, Park alleged the City violated her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. She also 
asserted state tort law claims. 
Dongbu was Kings Sports Bar & Grill’s workers’ compensation 
insurance carrier. 
Dongbu successfully moved to intervene in 
the federal suit. Later, the City moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. In August 2018, the federal district court agreed. It dismissed Park’s federal claims with prejudice. 
Park v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, No. CV 17-00142 ACK-KSC, 2018 
WL 3764084, at *16 (D. Haw. Aug. 8, 2018). Park failed to 
allege “intentional governmental action meant to interfere” with 
her bodily integrity or that the officers “acted under color of 
3  
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
state law.” Id. at *9, *10. The court declined to rule on the 
state law claims. Id. at *16. Park appealed to the Ninth 
Circuit Court of Appeals. 
The next month, September 2018, Park filed a complaint in 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit. She alleged two claims, 
negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Park 
said the City was negligent in two ways: (1) An HPD policy in 
her view directed officers to possess guns while drinking alcohol, and (2) HPD lacked a whistleblowing policy requiring 
officers to report misconduct. The circuit court stayed the 
proceedings until the court of appeals ruled. 
The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal 
of Park’s claims in March 2020. Park v. City & Cnty. of
Honolulu, 952 F.3d 1136 (9th Cir. 2020). Park failed to plausibly argue that through its policies, “the County’s 
inaction reflected deliberate indifference to her Fourteenth 
Amendment right to bodily integrity.” Id. at 1141-42. The 
court disagreed with Park that HPD policy could reasonably be 
interpreted as requiring police officers to carry guns while 
intoxicated. Quite the opposite. “[T]he policy’s explicit 
purpose was to prohibit officers from carrying firearms while in 
an impaired condition.” Id. at 1142. The Ninth Circuit did not 
touch Park’s state law claims. 
4  
  
  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In March 2021, per HRS § 386-8, Dongbu intervened in the 
circuit court proceeding. Dongbu alleged four counts against 
the City: (1) negligence, (2) respondeat superior, (3) negligent 
supervision, and (4) subrogation. Dongbu repeated Park’s 
theories that the City was negligent for its possession-of-
firearms-while-intoxicated policy and not having a mandatory 
misconduct reporting policy. 
On its own, Dongbu alleged more. First, the City 
negligently trained the shooting officer on the safe handling of firearms. Second, the City negligently failed to supervise the 
officer and limit his access to weapons. 
Because it paid $1.1 million in workers’ compensation for 
Park, Dongbu also claimed subrogation. Dongbu maintained that 
it has the right to recover workers’ compensation payments it 
made for Park. 
In July 2021, the circuit court granted the City’s motion 
for summary judgment against Park. It also granted partial dismissal or partial summary judgment against Dongbu. The court 
dismissed Dongbu’s first two claims: negligence and respondeat 
superior. But not Dongbu’s other claims, negligent supervision 
and negligent training. 
In August 2021, the City answered Dongbu’s complaint. The 
next month it moved for summary judgment. The City argued that 
Dongbu’s negligent supervision claim failed to show the City had 
5  
   
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
notice that the officer needed supervision. Also, the City 
briefly mentioned that because Park was no longer in the case 
and Dongbu’s claims rested on the validity of her claims, 
Dongbu’s subrogation claim failed. 
The City withdrew its motion in March 2022. About a week 
later, the City again moved for summary judgment. The City 
revamped its argument. It relied on its subrogation theory. 
That is, Dongbu’s claims failed because the court dismissed Park from the case on the merits. 
In August 2022, the court denied the City’s MSJ against 
Dongbu. 
In September 2022, the City moved per Hawaiʻ i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 15(a) to reserve a question to this 
court. It also moved to stay the proceedings. Dongbu opposed 
the City’s requests. Park filed no response.  The circuit court 
granted the motion, but denied the stay. 
III. 
Does a subrogee insurance company [Dongbu], which timely 
intervened pursuant to HRS § 386-8(b), have an independent 
right to continue to pursue claims and/or legal theories 
against a tortfeasor that were not asserted by the subrogor 
employee [Park], after summary judgment has been granted against [Park], on [Park]’s claims? 
 Yes. So Dongbu may continue to pursue its non-dismissed 
claims. 
With subrogation, a subrogee (Dongbu) substitutes for a 
subrogor (Park), the original holder of a right. “[S]ubrogation 
6  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
involves ‘stepping into’ the shoes of another, when an insurer 
brings an action against a tortfeasor based upon its subrogation 
rights, the insurer’s rights flow from the insured’s rights.” 
State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Pac. Rent-All, Inc.
, 90 Hawaiʻi 
315, 329, 978 P.2d 753, 767 (1999). 
The parties disagree on what stepping into another’s shoes 
means. 
The City believes stepping into Park’s shoes means that the 
dismissal of her claims dooms Dongbu’s case. 
In its view, 
Dongbu’s rights flow solely from Park’s lawsuit. Because the 
court dismissed Park’s suit, Dongbu cannot pursue its claims as 
a subrogee. The City urges a No answer. 
We answer Yes. An employer or insurer, standing in an 
employee’s shoes, may continue litigating its independent claim if the employee could have raised that claim. 
First, answering Yes better protects subrogation, and by 
extension indemnity. Dongbu’s subrogation interest is not only 
valid, it’s vital to Hawaiʻ i’s workers’ compensation law.  “A 
substantial part of the legislative purpose and intent of a 
[workers’ compensation] statute is to provide for subrogation 
and prevent double recovery.” Moranz v. Harbor Mall, LLC
, 150 
Hawaiʻi 387, 400, 502 P.3d 488, 501 (2022) (citation omitted). 
Second, a Yes answer aligns with HRS § 386-8. 
Under that 
law, a subrogee insurance company like Dongbu has the ability to 
7  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
intervene to protect its lien interest against the tortfeasor. 
See HRS § 386-8(b) (“The employer, at any time before trial on 
the facts, may join as party plaintiff.”). 
Third, answering No would impair an employer or insurer’s 
ability to intervene. Its claims could only be as good as the 
employee’s. If an employee failed to survive a motion to 
dismiss, a court would have to dismiss an employer’s complaint – 
even a strong one. This approach may dissuade employers from intervening in employees’ lawsuits. That outcome weakens HRS 
§ 386-8’s right to intervene and seek reimbursement. And it may 
allow wrongdoers to elude liability. 
A. 
Subrogation aids indemnity. State Farm
, 90 Hawaiʻi at 328, 
978 P.2d at 766. It allows insurers to recover what they pay when third parties injure their insureds. 
Id.It prevents an 
insured from getting two recoveries: one from the insurer, one 
from the tortfeasor. Moranz
, 150 Hawaiʻi at 400, 502 P.3d at 
501. 
The insurer’s subrogation right balances the insured’s 
recovery right. 
The insurer, “who, in a fault sense, is 
neutral, comes out even;” the tortfeasor “pays exactly the 
damages it would ordinarily pay;” and the employee “gets a 
fuller reimbursement for actual damages sustained than is 
8  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
possible under the compensation system alone.” Id. (cleaned 
up). 
Subrogation is an insurer’s remedy for torts against its 
insureds. It is “both a legal right and a legal action.” State
Farm, 90 Hawaiʻ i at 328, 978 P.2d at 766 (citation omitted). It 
is not automatic. See id. at 333, 978 P.2d at 771. But once 
invoked, the subrogee “is put in all respects in the place of 
the party to whose rights [it] is subrogated.” Id. at 331, 978 
P.2d at 769. Here, Dongbu steps into Park’s shoes. Its rights flow from her rights. Id. at 329, 978 P.2d at 767. 
An intervening insurer slides into comfortable shoes, not 
shoddy shoes. It’s not forced to wear a dismissed plaintiff’s shoes. It may walk within the limits of the employee’s 
available rights. And it does so at the outset of the 
litigation. A workers’ compensation insurer may raise and 
litigate any claim an employee was entitled to raise at the 
outset. 
Dongbu seeks redress for Park’s injury. Payback for what 
it paid out. Dongbu may do more than piggyback on Park’s claims. It may enforce all rights available to Park. 
The City insists that State Farm supports its position. An 
insurer may “enforce only such rights as the insured . . . has 
against the party whose wrong caused the loss.” State Farm
, 90 
Hawaiʻi at 329, 978 P.2d at 767 (cleaned up).  Those rights, this 
9  
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
court said, “flow from the insured’s rights” and “are 
derivative” because they “rest upon the viability of the 
insured’s claim against the tortfeasor.” Id.The City believes 
this language means Dongbu’s claims are always tied to Park’s. Once her claims are dismissed, Dongbu’s are too. The City is 
wrong. 
State Farm merely stressed that an insurer may only bring 
claims the insured could bring. Here, Dongbu’s claims “rest upon the viability” of Park’s. If Park cannot advance any 
winning claims against the City, then neither can Dongbu. 
Dongbu’s pursuit of its claims does not harm Park. As a 
subrogee, an insurer is entitled to only what will make it 
“come[] out even.” Moranz
, 150 Hawaiʻi at 400, 502 P.3d at 501. 
If Dongbu prevails against the City, it pays Park “any excess” 
that it recovers. See
 HRS § 386-8(e), § 386-8(g) (setting 
priority order for distribution of damages). 
No matter how the City’s liability gets litigated, the 
distribution follows HRS § 386-8’s formula. Park receives any excess. It doesn’t matter if she wins, Dongbu wins, or they both win together. See HRS § 386-8(e)-(g). And even if Park 
wins without Dongbu’s intervention, Dongbu is still entitled to recover workers’ compensation payments from Park’s “judgment or 
settlement proceeds.” See HRS § 386-8(f). 
10  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B. 
HRS § 386-8 also supports a Yes answer. The statute offers 
the employer or workers’ compensation insurer the ability to 
independently protect its subrogation interest. (HRS § 386-8 
uses “employer” to refer to the employer or the employer’s 
workers’ compensation insurance carrier, and we follow that 
practice). 
“HRS § 386-8 provides the exclusive remedy for an employer 
seeking reimbursement for workers’ compensation benefits from a third-party tortfeasor.” Hawaiian Dredging Constr. Co., Inc. v.
Fujikawa Assocs., Inc., 142 Hawaiʻ i 429, 439, 420 P.3d 360, 370 
(2018). 
Because Dongbu paid for Park’s injuries through 
workers’ compensation benefits, HRS § 386-8 authorizes it to seek reimbursement. 
HRS § 386-8 empowers an employer to sue a third-party 
tortfeasor. Once an employee sues, the employer may “join as 
[a] party plaintiff.” HRS § 386-8(b). Once joined, HRS § 386-8 
does not bind the employer to the confines of the employee’s 
complaint. The employer has the same rights as a party. Like any plaintiff, it may advance claims. Here, Dongbu joined “as 
[a] party plaintiff” under HRS § 386-8(b) to protect its 
interests in subrogation and reimbursement. It may bring its 
own claims. 
11  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HRS § 386-8 also allows an employer to sue without the 
employee. If Park had not filed suit “within nine months after 
the date of the personal injury,” Dongbu could have sued on its 
own. HRS § 386-8(c). Park, as the employee, could join that 
suit, file her own action, or sit out the litigation. Id.If 
the employee sits out, the employer may go it alone. HRS § 386-8(e) anticipates actions “prosecuted by the employer alone” and 
details how judgments or settlements should be divided between employer and employee. 
Thus, we do not think the legislature intended for an 
employer to passively rely on an employee to propel litigation. 
The legislature gave employers the right to bring their own 
claims. HRS § 386-8(e) says nothing about ending an employer’s 
case when an employee’s case ends. 
Next, HRS § 386-8 protects employers’ subrogation interest 
in settlement negotiations. HRS § 386-8(d) reads: “No release 
or settlement of any claim or action under this section is valid without the written consent of both employer and employee.” It 
“ensures that both the employee and employer have an opportunity 
to protect their interests.” Hawaiian Dredging
, 142 Hawaiʻi at 
435, 420 P.3d at 366. 
We also believe the legislature did not intend to tie an 
employer to an injured employee. 
Rather, it gave the employer 
its own opportunity to shape the outcome. See Shimabuku v.
12  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Montgomery Elevator Co. , 79 Hawaiʻi 352, 358, 903 P.2d 48, 53 
(1995) (“[B]ecause the employer’s right to reimbursement is 
often dependent on the injured employee’s actions, the legislature imposed a provision requiring the written consent of 
both employer and employee before any release or settlement is 
valid”). 
Last, HRS § 386-8 understands that employers and employees 
can pursue separate legal strategies. 
They may bring either “a 
single action or . . . consolidated actions,” and be “represented by the same agreed attorney or by separate 
attorneys.” HRS § 386-8(g). An employer is not just a 
bystander. 
Nowhere does HRS § 386-8 indicate that an employer’s claims 
must match an employee’s claims, or must be dismissed if an employee is dismissed. An intervening employer, as “party 
plaintiff,” may pursue its own claims. 
C. 
The policies behind intervention inform our Yes answer. A 
No answer undermines intervention, weakens recovery, and 
disincentivizes insurers from intervening. 
Dismissing Dongbu subverts intervention’s aims. One HRS 
§ 386-8 purpose is to facilitate a complete resolution of the 
dispute. First Ins. Co. of Hawaii, Ltd. v. A&B Props., Inc.
, 
126 Hawaiʻi 406, 418, 271 P.3d 1165, 1177 (2012). An insurer’s 
13  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
intervention right is necessary to resolve the issue and provide 
for subrogation. 
Intervention is governed by Hawaiʻ i Rules of Civil Procedure 
Rule 24. Rule 24(a)(2) allows intervention when an applicant’s 
interest is at risk and is not “adequately represented by 
existing parties.” Intervention sometimes comes when an insurer 
mistrusts a plaintiff’s skill to litigate claims. The insurer 
doesn’t want to link its subrogation rights to a rinky-dink 
legal strategy. Something like Dongbu bemoans here: potentially 
viable claims omitted from the complaint. 
Hawaiʻi law allow
s employers to pursue their subrogation 
rights only through HRS § 386-8. Hawaiian Dredging
, 142 Hawaiʻ i 
at 435, 420 P.3d at 366. Once the employee sues, as Park did, the employer’s only option is to intervene in the employee’s 
suit. See HRS § 386-8(b)-(c). That’s why Dongbu’s claims 
survive: hitching its fate to Park barricades its only path to relief. A workers’ compensation insurer has another way – 
around the plaintiff – to pursue its subrogation right. 
Answering No as the City wants disincentivizes employers 
from joining cases where there is risk of dismissal. This may lead to lower recovery. If an employer thinks that a 
plaintiff’s case will get dismissed, it has little reason to 
spend money and prepare its own case. Employers lack motivation 
14  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to strengthen a weak case by intervening. The right to 
intervene erodes. 
Disincentivizing intervention harms injured employees 
unable to retain solid legal representation. An employer’s 
workers’ compensation lien cuts into the damages available to 
pay a plaintiff’s attorney. See HRS § 386-8(f). Because an 
employer’s complaint would only be as strong as the under-represented employee, an employer – usually better funded – is incentivized not to waste legal expenses by joining weaker 
cases. 
In contrast, allowing an insurer to pursue its claims 
benefits both insurer and insured. See Moranz
, 150 Hawaiʻi at 
398, 502 P.3d at 499 (the legislature “recognizes that a third-party action can result in recovery from a third person which 
benefits 
both the employee and the insurer, even when the action 
is prosecuted by the insurer or employee alone”) (cleaned up). HRS § 386-8(e) entitles Park to “any excess” compensation Dongbu 
receives, while Dongbu can claim reimbursement from Park’s 
recovery. See HRS § 386-8(f). Dongbu’s intervention right 
makes it more likely that third-party tortfeasors pay what 
“[they] would ordinarily pay.” Moranz
, 150 Hawaiʻi at 400, 502 
P.3d at 501 (cleaned up). 
15  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
D. 
Last, the City argues that claim preclusion applies. We 
disagree. 
The court dismissed Park’s claims and two of Dongbu’s four 
claims. Dongbu’s negligent supervision and negligent training 
claims remain. The circuit court never decided these claims 
because the City withdrew its motion to dismiss. The City 
refocused its revamped motion on its claim preclusion theory. 
Claim preclusion (res judicata) ensures that parties cannot 
relitigate claims that were decided or could’ve been decided in 
a final judgment. Bremer v. Weeks
, 104 Hawaiʻi 43, 53–54, 85 
P.3d 150, 160–61 (2004). Dongbu’s remaining claims though, are 
new. They were not litigated to final judgment. The summary 
judgment against Park does not glue Dongbu. 
The City gives no adequate reason why Park’s dismissal 
should apply to Dongbu’s additional claims. 
Res judicata 
applies “where matters have already been tried and decided on the merits.” Kauhane v. Acutron Co., Inc., 71 Haw. 458, 463, 
795 P.2d 276, 278–79 (1990). Here, Dongbu’s negligent training 
and supervision claims are not yet decided. Though res judicata 
forbids relitigation, it promotes access to justice. It 
“permits every litigant to have an opportunity to try [their] 
case on the merits.” Id. at 463, 795 P.2d at 279 (cleaned up). 
16  
  
  
 
 
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
That’s all Dongbu wants – to litigate the negligent training and 
supervision claim for the first time. 
The City had a chance to make Dongbu’s remaining claims go 
away. It filed a motion to dismiss those claims. But it 
withdrew that motion. Then, it filed a new motion, seemingly 
trying to leverage an offbeat legal theory to backdoor a 
dismissal. 
The City acknowledged its unusual tactic. Pitching the 
City’s “claim” argument to the circuit court, counsel conceded, “I understand, Your Honor, that in a normal case, we talk about 
claims a little differently.” Ordinarily parties can “move for 
partial summary judgment or I’d move for partial judgment on the 
pleadings and [the judge] would go claim by claim.” Counsel 
voiced the sound approach. Our justice system prefers 
adjudication on the merits. JK v. DK
, 153 Hawaiʻi 268, 278, 533 
P.3d 1215, 1225 (2023). In a case like this, we feel parties 
should seek summary judgment for each cause of action, applying 
the usual summary judgment standard. 
IV. 
An intervening workers’ compensation subrogee-insurer may 
make any claim that a subrogor-plaintiff may make at the outset 
of the case. 
If the plaintiff’s claims are dismissed, the 
insurer’s claims remain.
