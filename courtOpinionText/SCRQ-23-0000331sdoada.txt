RESERVED QUESTION FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 1CCV-22-0000743) 
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, and Eddins, JJ., Circuit Judge 
Remigio  and Circuit Judge Johnson, assigned by reason of vacancies)  
 This court agreed to answer a reserved question from the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit. The circuit court asked: 
In a wrongful foreclosure case brought by a homeowner 
against a homeowners’ association, should the mortgage debt 
of the homeowner to a third- party lender(s) that was 
discharged by the third- party lender’s subsequent 
foreclosure be considered in determining/calculating the Plaintiff’s damages?  
 
 
  
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
We accepted the reserved question, advising that we 
intended to answer it through Wong v. Ass’n of Apartment Owners 
of Harbor Square, SCAP-22-0000552, a case then pending before 
us. 
We decided Wong on February 29, 2024 and entered final 
judgment on April 2, 2024. 154 Hawaiʻ i 58, 545 P.3d 547 (2024).  
Our decision describes how a plaintiff may calculate damages in a lawsuit against a condominium association for wrongful foreclosure. 
Accordingly, we remand the case to the circuit court for 
further proceedings consistent with Wong. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, May 1, 2024.
