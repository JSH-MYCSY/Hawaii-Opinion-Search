RESERVED QUESTION FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 3CCV-22-0000088) 
 
JUNE 24, 2024 
 
RECKTENWALD, C.J., McKENNA, EDDINS, GINOZA, AND DEVENS, JJ. 
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
This court accepted the Circuit Court of the Third 
Circuit’s reserved question: “Whether [the circuit court] has 
the inherent and statutory authority to transfer 
nunc pro tunc
an appeal, which was timely filed with [the circuit court], to  
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the Supreme Court of Hawai‘ i as the court with appellate 
jurisdiction.”1 We answer yes. The subject case is an agency 
appeal of the Land Use Commission’s (LUC) order denying Honoipu 
Hideaway, LLC’s (Honoipu) petition for declaratory order to 
change the boundary location between the conservation and 
agricultural districts on a district boundary map. 
The question follows In re Kanahele, where this court 
held that declaratory orders entered by the LUC have the “same 
status” for judicial review as orders in contested cases under 
Hawai‘i Revised Statues (HRS) §§ 91-8 (2012), 91-14 (Supp. 2016), 
and 205-19 (2017 and Supp. 2019). 152 Hawai‘ i 501, 512, 526 P.3d 
478, 489 (2023). 
As a result, some appeals of LUC declaratory 
orders, then pending before the circuit courts and the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), were no longer in the 
correct court. Under Kanahele
, they all should have been filed 
with this court in the first instance. This is one of those 
cases. 
We hold that in order to correct jurisdiction 
following this court’s decision in Kanahele, the circuit court 
may transfer the case here nunc pro tunc, or backdated to the 
appropriate time. Allowing such a transfer in these limited 
circumstances accords with our longstanding policy to hear cases 
1 The Honorable Chief Judge Robert D.S. Kim presiding.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
on the merits, and there is both inherent and statutory power 
for the courts to do so. 
II. BACKGROUND 
In 2005, this court ruled in Lingle v. Haw. Gov’t 
Emps. Ass’n, AFSCME, Loc. 152, AFL-CIO that although declaratory orders are not contested cases, they have the same status for 
the purposes of appeal under HRS § 91-14. 107 Hawai‘ i 178, 186, 
111 P.3d 587, 595 (2005). 
At the time, that meant that both 
declaratory orders and contested cases could be appealed from an agency to the circuit court. In 2016, the Hawai‘ i legislature 
passed Act 48, which provided that contested cases before the LUC are appealable directly to the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court. Last 
year in Kanahele
, we wrote that 
[t]his court must presume the legislature was aware of 
Lingle  when it passed Act 48 in 2016.  .  .  .  Therefore, this 
court’s interpretation in Lingle  of HRS  §§ 91-8 and 91- 14 
that declaratory orders have the “same status” for judicial 
review as orders in contested cases applies to HRS  § 205-
19.  .  .  .  Thus, pursuant to HRS  §§ 91-8, 91-14 and 205- 19, 
this court has jurisdiction to directly review the Kanaheles’ appeal.  
152 Hawai‘i at 512, 526 P.3d at 489 (citations omitted). 
In other words, while contested cases and proceedings 
for declaratory orders are not the same, we held in 
Kanahele 
that they have the same status for appellate review: both should 
be appealed to this court directly. 
At the time that Kanahele was decided, Honoipu and 
other appeals of LUC declaratory orders were pending before the 
3  
 
 
   
   
 
          
   
      
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
circuit courts and the ICA. Honoipu is one of those cases. 
Honoipu is an appeal of a LUC petition, wherein Honoipu sought 
to change the boundary location between the conservation and 
agricultural districts on a district boundary map. When 
Kanahele was decided, briefing had just been completed in 
Honoipu. Following Kanahele, Honoipu moved to transfer its case from the third circuit to this court. The LUC moved to dismiss 
for lack of jurisdiction arguing that because, as a result of 
Kanahele, the case should have been filed at the supreme court, 
the circuit court lacked jurisdiction and should dismiss the 
case. In response, Honoipu suggested that if the circuit court 
was unsure of its power to transfer the case to the supreme 
court, it should reserve the question. 
The circuit court reserved this question pursuant to 
Hawai‘i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 15 (2018). We 
accepted the question and designated Honoipu to be the appellant and the LUC to be the appellee. 
Honoipu argues that the circuit court has the inherent 
authority under the Hawai‘i Constitution and statutory authority 
to transfer the case 
nunc pro tunc.2 It argues that the appeal 
2 Nunc pro tunc translates to “now for then.” Nunc pro tunc 
actions allow courts to remedy clerical issues, clear errors, and prevent 
manifest injustice. See Nunc Pro Tunc, Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 
2019). Here, a nunc pro tunc order would transfer the case effective as of 
its date of filing in the circuit court, such that Honoipu’s appeal to this 
court would be timely. 
4  
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
was initiated correctly based on both parties’ understanding of 
jurisdiction at the time, and the mutual understanding of 
jurisdiction was upended by Kanahele. Honoipu cites to 
article VI, section 1 of the Hawai‘ i Constitution, which “vests 
the judicial power of the State in the courts.” Farmer v.
Admin. Dir. of Ct., State of Haw., 94 Hawai‘ i 232, 241, 11 P.3d 
457, 466 (2000). 
It cites to cases in which this court has 
fashioned remedies where none existed, like Farmer
, in which 
this court allowed an appellant to “be given an opportunity to 
challenge the lifetime revocation of his driver’s license 
because one of the three predicate convictions on which his 
revocation is based ha[d] been set aside” even though the statute did not provide such an opportunity. Id.Honoipu 
argues further that the inherent authority of the courts, as part of the judicial power of the state established by the 
Hawai‘i Constitution, includes “the power to transfer cases that 
were otherwise timely brought from a court that lacks 
jurisdiction to a court with proper jurisdiction, despite that 
no statute explicitly provides for such recourse.” 
Honoipu also argues that there is supporting statutory 
authority in HRS § 603-21.9(6) (2016), which grants circuit 
courts the power to “take . . . steps as may be necessary to 
carry into full effect the powers which are or shall be given to 
5  
 
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
them by law or for the promotion of justice in matters pending 
before them.” It quotes this court’s decision in Alexander & 
Baldwin, LLC v. Armitage, arguing that transferring the case 
would comport with this court’s “policy in favor of hearing 
cases on the merits wherever possible.” 151 Hawai‘ i 37, 54, 508 
P.3d 832, 849 (2022). 
Honoipu differentiates between 
jurisdiction over the merits of an appeal and the jurisdiction 
to effectuate a transfer, arguing that the circuit court possess 
the latter even without the former. Honoipu also points to 
other jurisdictions in which courts have been allowed to transfer cases to cure jurisdictional problems. 
The LUC argues that the “right to appeal is purely 
statutory and exists only when jurisdiction is given by some 
constitutional or statutory provision,” and that the circuit 
court may not initiate a proceeding in a superior appellate 
court. (Quoting 
Lingle, 107 Hawai‘ i at 184, 111 P.3d at 593.) 
The LUC emphasizes that no statute explicitly grants the circuit court the power to transfer the appeal to the 
Hawai‘i Supreme 
Court, and because there is a jurisdictional defect, the remedy 
is dismissal of the case. The LUC disputes Honoipu’s HRS 
§ 603-21.9(6) argument, contending that while that provision 
grants the circuit court power to fashion remedies generally, it 
does not create jurisdiction or authorize the transfer here. 
6  
 
 
   
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The LUC lays out the different methods for cases getting to the 
Hawai‘i Supreme Court — certiorari and transfers from the ICA, as 
well as direct appeals designated by statute — and points out 
that none of them allow for cases to be transferred from a 
circuit court to this court. 
The LUC disputes the “inherent powers” argument, 
asserting that Honoipu’s reading of HRS § 603-21.9(6) is too 
broad and would render the circuit courts “effectively 
omnipotent.” 
The LUC cites Pele Def. Fund v. Puna Geothermal 
Venture
, arguing that when a circuit court lacks jurisdiction 
over an agency appeal, it can “do nothing but dismiss the 
appeal.” 77 Hawai‘i 64, 69 n.10, 881 P.2d 1210, 1215 n.10 
(1994). The LUC also raises practical questions, including 
whether the transfer must be done by motion of a party or 
sua 
sponte, whether it is mandatory or discretionary, and what should happen if briefs have already been filed. The LUC also 
argues that cases from other jurisdictions do not support this 
transfer. Finally, the LUC argues that nunc pro tunc corrects 
mistakes of the court, not those of litigants. It asserts that 
Honoipu’s appeal should have been filed in the Hawai‘ i Supreme 
Court, and that allowing transfer here would be correcting 
Honoipu’s mistake, not the court’s.

III. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
Reserved questions are questions of law. Flores-Case
‘Ohana v. Univ. of  Haw.
, 153 Hawai‘i 76, 81, 526 P.3d 601, 606 
(2023). We review them de novo. Id.
IV. DISCUSSION 
There is both statutory and inherent power to transfer 
this case. 
The circuit courts have statutory authority “[t]o 
make and issue all orders and writs necessary or appropriate 
in aid of their original or appellate jurisdiction.” HRS 
§ 603-21.9(1) (2016). And this court has the authority “[t]o 
make and issue any order or writ necessary or appropriate in aid 
of its jurisdiction.” HRS § 602-5(a)(5) (2016). This court may 
also 
make and award such judgments, decrees, orders and 
mandates, issue such executions and other processes, and do 
such other acts and take such other steps as may be 
necessary to carry into full effect the powers which are or 
shall be given to it by law or for the promotion of justice 
in matters pending before it. 
HRS § 602-5(a)(6) (2016) (emphasis added). 
Article VI, section 1 of the Hawai‘i Constitution 
entrusts courts with the “judicial power of the State.” This 
court has interpreted the judicial power as inherently including 
“the power to administer justice.” Farmer
, 94 Hawai‘i at 241, 11 
P.3d at 466 (quoting 
State v. Moriwake
, 65 Haw. 47, 55, 647 P.2d 
705, 712 (1982)). Hawai‘i courts “have inherent equity, 
supervisory, and administrative powers as well as inherent power 
8  
 
 
   
 
 
  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to control the litigation process before them. Inherent powers 
of the court are derived from the state Constitution and are not 
confined by or dependent on statute.” 
State v. Harrison, 95 
Hawai‘i 28, 32, 18 P.3d 890, 894 (2001) (quoting Kawamata Farms, 
Inc. v. United Agri. Prods., 86 
Hawai‘i 214, 242, 948 P.2d 1055, 
1083 (1997)). These powers include, but are not limited to, the power to “create a remedy for a wrong even in the absence of 
specific statutory remedies[,] . . . to prevent unfair 
results[,] . . . and to curb abuses and promote a fair process.” 
Id. Other jurisdictions have held that courts have the inherent 
authority to transfer appeals for lack of jurisdiction or venue.
  3
   The LUC is correct that there is no statutory 
authority that explicitly provides for the transfer of an appeal when some intervening circumstance (in this case, Kanahele) 
strips a court (in this case, the circuit court) of its 
3 See, e.g., Pearce v. Dir., Off. of Workers’ Comp. Programs, U.S. 
Dep’t of Lab. , 603 F.2d 763, 771 (9th Cir. 1979) (collecting cases and noting 
that “[w]e have held that we have power to transfer a pending case to another 
circuit even when the latter circuit has exclusive jurisdiction and venue to review the order in question”); People v. Nickerson, 26 Cal. Rptr. 3d 563, 
567 (App. 2005) (inherent authority, among other things, “empowers [the 
California appellate court] to order transfer [of an appeal]”); Pridgen v. 
Head, 210 So. 2d 426, 429 (Ala. 1968) (“The fact that the appeal was taken to 
the Court of Appeals rather than to [ the supreme court] does not justify a 
dismissal of the appeal. The cause has been transferred to this court in 
keeping with a practice of long standing where the appeal is taken to the wrong court. The motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.”); Dunn v. U.S. 
Dep’t of Agric. , 654 F.2d 64, 68 (Ct. Cl. 1981) (“[W]e have the same inherent 
power to transfer a case from this court to a Court of Appeals which appears to have exclusive jurisdiction. ”); Commonwealth v. Carter, 389 A.2d 241, 242 
(Pa. Commw. 1978) (“Where the defect is the erroneous filing of the proceeding in the wrong court, this error may be corrected by certifying the 
case to the proper tribunal.”).

jurisdiction. But that lack of explicit statutory authority is 
not dispositive. We hold that the power to “do such other acts 
and take such other steps as may be necessary to carry into full 
effect the powers which are or shall be given to them by law or 
for the promotion of justice” gives the circuit court the power 
to correct a jurisdictional mistake that was no party’s or court’s fault. HRS § 603-21.9(6). 
A nunc pro tunc order allows the record to “speak the 
truth.” DuPonte v. DuPonte, 53 Haw. 123, 126, 488 P.2d 537, 540 
(1971). “Where through no fault of the complaining party some act which the court must perform is not done at the time it 
ought to be done, the court, in the interest of justice, may and 
should presently do or perform that act as of the date it should 
have been done.” Keahole Def. Coal., Inc. v. Bd. of Land & Nat.
Res., 110 Hawai‘ i 419, 430, 134 P.3d 585, 596 (2006), abrogated 
on other grounds by Tax Found. of Haw. v. State, 144 Hawai‘ i 175, 
439 P.3d 127 (2019) (citation omitted). 
Honoipu argues that it 
is in the “interest of justice” to transfer the case to this 
court, effective as of the date of the original filing in 
circuit court, (i.e., nunc pro tunc
) such that it was timely 
filed. The LUC argues that because jurisdiction is statutory 
and there is no statute authorizing transfer from a circuit 
court to the Hawai‘ i Supreme Court, transfer is inappropriate. 
10  
 
   
   
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The unusual circumstances of this case weigh in favor 
of nunc pro tunc transfer. When the appeal to the circuit court 
was filed, Kanahele had yet to be decided. Jurisdiction was 
never challenged at the circuit court. The circuit court’s 
jurisdiction only became a contested issue after Kanahele. 
Transferring the case nunc pro tunc would further the 
judiciary’s policy of “permit[ting] litigants, where possible, to appeal and hear the case on its merits.” State by Off. of
Consumer Prot. v. Joshua
, 141 Hawai‘i 91, 98, 405 P.3d 527, 534 
(2017) (citation omitted). Now, the circuit court does not have 
jurisdiction to hear the case on the merits. But allowing it to 
transfer the case to the court with jurisdiction — this court — 
will permit the case to be heard on the merits. Otherwise, 
Honoipu could lose its day in court entirely if the time for 
filing an appeal is deemed to have expired. Even if the circuit 
court fashioned a remedy in which the case was dismissed for 
lack of jurisdiction - but with leave to refile the appeal with the proper court - this court would eventually see all of the 
same arguments these parties have already made to the circuit 
court. Thus, the judicially efficient remedy is to transfer the 
case to this court 
nunc pro tunc so that we may address the 
merits questions more expeditiously. 
Answering yes to this reserved question is not a 
license to transfer any case from the circuit court to our 
11  
 
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ‘I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
court. Rather, in this limited circumstance, in which 
jurisdiction was proper when the appeal was originally filed, 
but the parties’ understanding of jurisdiction shifted following 
a decision from an appellate court, transfer to perfect 
jurisdiction is appropriate. 
V. CONCLUSION 
For the reasons described above, the answer to the 
reserved question is “Yes.” Calvert G. Chipchase  /s/ Mark E. Recktenwald
