RESERVED QUESTIONS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT 
OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI͑I 
(CASE NO. 2CSP-23-0000057)

RECKTENWALD, C.J., McKENNA, EDDINS, AND GINOZA, JJ., 
AND CIRCUIT JUDGE MORIKONE IN PLACE OF DEVENS, J., RECUSED 
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
In this case, individual and class plaintiffs and 
defendants agreed to the terms of a global settlement agreement 
that would resolve all claims arising from damages caused by the 
August 2023 Maui fires. 
As relevant here, the terms of the 
settlement require, as a condition precedent, either a release by insurance carriers of all subrogation claims against the 
defendants, or a final, unappealable order and judgment that the  
 
  
 
    
 
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
insurers’ exclusive remedy for all subrogation claims arising 
from the fires would be a lien against the settlement under 
Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 663-10 (2016).  The Circuit 
Court of the Second Circuit reserved three questions to our 
court. 
On Monday, February 10, 2025, we issued an order 
answering the reserved questions as follows: 
Question 1: 
Does the holding of Yukumoto v. Tawarahara, 140 
Haw[aiʻi] 285 [], 400 P.3d 486[] (2017)[,] that 
limited the subrogation remedies available to 
health insurers to reimbursement from their 
insureds under HRS § 663-10 and barred 
independent actions against tortfeasors who 
settled with the insureds extend to property 
and casualty insurance carriers? 
Question 1 is answered in the affirmative. Our 
opinion in Yukumoto v. Tawarahara, 140 Hawai‘ i 285, 400 P.3d 
486 (2017), extends to property and casualty insurers such 
that, under 
Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 431:13-
103(a)(10)(A)  [(2019)], the lien provided for under HRS § 
663-10(a) is the exclusive remedy for a property and 
casualty insurer to recover claims paid for damages caused 
by a third- party tortfeasor in the context of a tort 
settlement between an insured and the tortfeasor.  
Question 2: 
Is a property and casualty insurer
’s 
subrogation right of reimbursement prejudiced 
by its insured’s release of any tortfeasor when 
the settlement documents and release preserve 
those same rights under HRS § 663- 10? 
Because the statutory lien under HRS § 663- 10 is the 
exclusive remedy for a property and casualty insurer in the context of a tort settlement, Question 2 is answered in the 
negative.  
Question 3
: 
Under the circumstances of the Maui Fire Cases and the terms of the “Global Settlement,” does 
the law of the State of 
Hawaiʻi require that 
2  
 
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
insureds be made whole for all claimed injuries 
or damages before their insurers can pursue a 
subrogation right of recovery or reimbursement 
against a third- party tortfeasor? 
Question 3 is answered in the negative.  Under the 
circumstances of this mass tort case, we decline to apply the made whole doctrine to the statutory lien- claim process 
established by HRS §§ 431:13- 103(a)(10) and 663- 10. 
These answers are consistent with our precedent, and 
with the plain language and legislative history of the relevant 
statutes. Specifically, our answers effectuate the 
legislature’s intent, following the enactment of HRS § 431:13-
103(a)(10) in 2000, to appropriately balance an insurer’s right 
to reimbursement with an insured plaintiff’s right to be fairly 
compensated for their injury. Further, our answers serve the 
long-recognized policy of promoting settlement. 
In our order, we retained jurisdiction to issue this 
opinion. 
II. BACKGROUND 
A. Procedural History 
The facts underlying this case are well known. On the 
morning of August 8, 2023, under conditions of strong, dry winds 
from Hurricane Dora, a brush fire ignited outside of Lahaina, 
Maui. Residents had little warning or ability to evacuate. 
Some sheltered in the ocean off Front Street, as they watched 
large swathes of Lahaina burn. The conflagration destroyed over 3,000 structures, including homes, businesses, and historical 
3  
 
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
landmarks. At least 102 people lost their lives as a result of 
the fire. 
Subsequently, numerous individual actions were brought 
by plaintiffs (Individual Action Plaintiffs) in the Circuit 
Court of the Second Circuit (circuit court) against various defendants, including Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc., 
Kamehameha Schools, State of Hawai‘ i, County of Maui, and others 
(Defendants). The circuit court then created a special 
proceeding under Rule 12 of the Rules of the Circuit Courts of 
the State of 
Hawaiʻi to coordinate the issuance of complex case 
management orders applicable to all individual proceedings in 
the numerous cases arising from the Maui wildfires.1 To 
facilitate the special proceeding, the circuit court ordered liaison counsel to coordinate the Individual Action Plaintiffs. 
The circuit court then appointed a special settlement master and 
co-administrators to facilitate settlement. 
Separately, three class action lawsuits were filed in 
the First and Second Circuits in the name of injured parties that had not yet filed individual actions (Consolidated Class 
Plaintiffs). These three class actions were removed to the 
United States District Court for the District of Hawai‘ i, where

proceeding.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
they were consolidated into a single action and later re-filed 
in the Second Circuit.2 
At the same time, subrogation actions were brought by 
numerous insurance carriers (Subrogating Insurers) in the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit against the same Defendants, seeking to recover benefits paid to their insureds for damages 
caused by the fires.
3 
Counsel for the Individual Action Plaintiffs, 
Consolidated Class Plaintiffs, Defendants, and Subrogating 
Insurers all participated in mediation to resolve the various 
pending actions.4 In early August 2024, this mediation resulted 
in a settlement term sheet signed by all parties save for the 
Subrogating Insurers. The term sheet contemplated a global 
settlement that resolved all claims against the Defendants. The 
term sheet also required an agreement or judgment resolving the 
Subrogating Insurers’ claims against the Defendants as a 
2 In October 2024, the United States District Court for the 
District of Hawai͑i approved the Consolidated Class Plaintiffs and 
Defendants’ joint stipulation to dismiss the class action complaints .  On 
October 30, 2024, the Consolidated Class re- filed a complaint in the circuit 
court.  On November 27, 2024, the circuit court approved the Consolidated 
Class Plaintiffs and Defendants’ joint stipulation to stay all proceedings 
“to focus resources on further effectuating the settlement.” 
3 On October 23, 2024, the Circuit Court of the First Circuit 
transferred venue of the Subrogating Insurers’ claims to the circuit court. 
4 The mediation process was initiated by the circuit court in case 
2CSP-23-0000057.  Thus, the Consolidated Class Plaintiffs and Subrogating 
Insurers participated in the mediation as non- parties to the underlying 
proceeding.

condition precedent to the proposed settlement. The relevant 
provision stated: 
4. Agreement or Judgment Resolving Subrogation Claims. 
The Settlement Agreement shall provide that as a 
condition precedent to any obligations of the Paying 
Parties under the Settlement Agreement, in addition 
to all other requirements and conditions in the 
Settlement Agreement, one of the following two conditions (under sub- point (a) or sub- point (b)) 
must be met within 90 days from mutual execution and delivery of the Term Sheet: 
(a) each and every [Subrogating Insurer] enters into 
a written agreement that provides for releases of all Maui Fires Claims against the Paying Parties and 
other related parties, and that agreement, including 
a list of all insurers who are parties to it, is 
provided to the Paying Parties, in which case no 
further conditions under paragraph 4(b) must be satisfied; or 
(b) a trial court enters a judgment, order, or 
opinion determining that if the Settlement Agreement 
between the [Individual Action Plaintiffs] and the 
Paying Parties becomes effective, 
(i) the [Subrogating Insurers’] exclusive 
remedy for any Maui Fires Claims would be 
asserting liens, if any, against their 
policyholders for their respective shares of 
the Aggregate Settlement Amount, and 
(ii) the [Subrogating Insurers] would be barred 
from bringing or maintaining any Maui Fires 
Claims against the Paying Parties, 
Provided that within nine months from the date of 
each judgment, order, or opinion under (b), either 
(x) each and every [Subrogating Insurer] enters 
into a written agreement that provides for releases of all Maui Fires Claims against the 
Paying Parties and other related parties, and 
that agreement, including a list of all insurers who are parties to it, is provided to 
the Paying Parties; or 
(y) each such judgment, order or opinion under 
(b) is rendered final and unappealable.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
On August 19, 2024, pursuant to the proposed global 
settlement, the circuit court issued an order declaring itself 
to have “exclusive jurisdiction, authority, and legal duty to 
review and resolve any and all subrogation claims or liens 
arising out of claims for payments under HRS § 663-10 in the event the global settlement of the Maui Fires claims between 
Plaintiffs and Defendants becomes effective.” Then, on 
September 12, 2024, the circuit court sua sponte reserved three 
questions to the Hawaiʻ i Supreme Court.  We accepted the reserved 
questions on September 25, 2024. 
B. Legal Background 
1. Subrogation defined Subrogation permits an insurer to step into the shoes 
of an injured insured and sue a third-party tortfeasor to 
recover damages for which the tortfeasor is liable to the 
insured but for which the insurer has already paid the insured. 
State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Pac. Rent-All, Inc.
, 90 Hawaiʻi 
315, 329, 978 P.2d 753, 767 (1999). Stated differently, 
subrogation “protects an insurer from paying a debt that should be discharged by another.” 
St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v.
Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.
, 135 Hawaiʻi 449, 455, 353 P.3d 991, 997 
(2015). Subrogation rights may arise from statute, in contract, or in equity. 
7  
 
  
   
  
  
 
  
 
 
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Generally, subrogation is theorized to prevent a 
windfall to either the injured insured or the tortfeasor.  See 
Yukumoto v. Tawarahara, 140 5
Hawaiʻi 285, 291, 400 P.3d 486, 492 
(2017). 
Subrogation prevents a double recovery by limiting the 
insured from collecting damages for the same injury from both 
the insurer and the tortfeasor.  Additionally, subrogation 
ensures that the ultimate liability attaches to the tortfeasor, 
and not the insurer, once the insurer has paid out to the 
insured. Brendan S. Maher & Rahda A. Pathak, Understanding and
Problematizing Contractual Tort Subrogation, 40 Loy.U.Chi.L.J. 
49, 63 (2008). Thus, subrogation has also been seen as serving 
a third policy objective: deterring future loss-causing conduct. 
Id. 6
Some scholars and courts, however, have characterized 
subrogation as a windfall for insurance companies. E.g., 
Maxwell v. Allstate Ins. Cos.
, 728 P.2d 812, 815 (Nev. 1986) 
(“Allowing subrogation deprives the insured of the coverage for 
5 Hawaiʻi courts have expressed distaste for “unjust enrichment” by 
both the tortfeasor and the insured. See 
State Farm
, 90 Hawaiʻi at 332, 978 
P.2d at 770 (distinguishing 
Pac. Ins. Co. Ltd. v. Esperanza, 73 Haw. 403, 8 33 
P.2d 890 (1992) from P eters v. Weatherw ax, 69 Haw. 21, 731 P.2d 157 (1987)). 
6 This concern runs counter to the spirit of the collateral source 
rule under which “a tortfeasor is not entitled to have its liability reduced 
by benefits received by the plaintiff from a source wholly independent of and 
collateral to the tortfeasor” as it robs the injured insured of the benefit 
of their prudent forethought. Bynum v. Magno
, 106 Hawaiʻi 81, 86, 101 P.3d 
1149, 1154 (2004) (internal quotations and brackets omitted). As the 
Bynum 
court explains, any benefit from collateral sources “should redound to the 
injured party.” Id. (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 920A cmt. b).

which he had paid and results in a windfall recovery for the 
insurer.”); Roger M. Baron, Subrogation: A Pandora’s Box 
Awaiting Closure, 41 S.D.L.Rev. 237, 241-247 (1996) (discussing 
“the flawed rationale of subrogation”). Under this theory, 
subrogation does not appreciably decrease insurance premiums because subrogation recovery is too speculative to be relied 
upon and, as such, premiums already cover the distributed risk 
of the insurance pool. Baron, supra, at 244. Any recovery from 
subrogation, therefore, is a pure windfall for the insurer at the insured’s expense, both because the insured paid a premium 
and because the insured is denied recovery from the tortfeasor. 
Id. at 243-45. As the Maxwell court explained, 
“[s]ubrogation is a windfall to the insurer.  It plays no 
part in the rate schedules (or only a minor one), and no 
reduction is made in insuring interests . . . where the 
subrogation right will obviously be worth something.” Patterson, Essentials of Insurance Law 151–152 (2d ed. 
1957). See also 2 Richards, Law of Insurance, § 183 (5th 
Ed. 1952) and DeCespedes v. Prudence Mut. Cas. Co. of Chicago, Ill., 193 So.2d 224, 227– 28 (3d D.C.A.Fla. 1966), 
aff’d 202 So.2d 561 (Fla. 1967). 
728 P.2d at 815 (quoting Allstate Ins. Co. v. Druke, 576 P.2d 
489, 492 (Ariz. 1978)). 
Notwithstanding these countervailing concerns, this 
court has recognized broad subrogation rights for insurers. 
See, e.g., Peters v. Weatherwax, 69 Haw. 21, 27, 731 P.2d 157, 
161 (1987) (quoting Kapena v. Kaleleonalani, 6 Haw. 579, 583 (Haw. Kingdom 1885)) (“[Equitable subrogation] is broad enough 
to include every instance in which one party pays a debt for 
9  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
which another is primarily answerable, and which, in equity and 
good conscience, should have been discharged by the latter[.]”) 
(second brackets in original} (quoted in St. Paul Fire, 135 
Hawaiʻi at 452, 353 P.3d at 994). 
2. Relevant caselaw 
Having established the general contours of 
subrogation, we turn to a survey of our controlling caselaw. 
Much of our caselaw discussing subrogation involves workers’ 
compensation claims and motor vehicle insurance, both of which 
are expressly exempted from HRS § 431:13-103(a)(10). See, e.g., 
Park v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu
, 154 Hawaiʻi 1, 543 P.3d 433 
(2024) (holding that an insurer’s subrogation claim remained 
after summary judgment had been granted against insured); 
AIG 
Haw. Ins. Co. v. Rutledge
, 87 Hawaiʻi 337, 955 P.2d 1069 (App. 
1998) (permitting an insurer to seek reimbursement from injured 
insureds where the insureds were compensated for damages caused 
by an uninsured motorist). 
Our attention therefore turns to two cases: the first, 
a pre-2000 case where we held that, in the context of fire and casualty insurance, an insured may not knowingly prejudice an 
insurer’s subrogation rights; the second, a case decided in 2017 
where we held that a health insurer had no subrogation rights 
and that the health insurer’s exclusive remedy was a lien on the 
10  
 
  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
insured’s settlement with the tortfeasor under HRS §§ 663-10 and 
431:13-103(a)(10). 
a. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. 
In State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Pacific Rent-All, 
Inc., decided in 1999, we held that, in the context of fire and casualty insurance: 
[I]f the insurer proves (1) that the tortfeasor had actual 
or constructive knowledge of the insurer’ s subrogation 
right of reimbursement or that the tortfeasor and insured colluded to destroy the insurer’s subrogation right and (2) 
that the insurer’s subrogation right of reimbursement is 
actually prejudiced by the insured’s release of the 
tortfeasor, then the release, settlement, and/or 
indemnification agreement executed by the insured and the 
tortfeasor will not bar a subrogation action by the insurer against the tortfeasor. 
90 Hawaiʻ i at 332, 978 P.2d at 770. 
There, the insured rented an air compressor from the 
alleged tortfeasor.7 Id. at 319, 978 P.2d at 757. The 
compressor subsequently exploded causing personal injury to the 
insured as well as substantial property damage to the insured and others. Id.The insured and others submitted claims to the 
property insurer, State Farm, that the property insurer paid. Id. 
The insured filed a complaint against the tortfeasor, 
alleging negligence and strict products liability. Id.The 
insured and the tortfeasor settled, releasing all of the

insured’s claims against the tortfeasor for personal injury and 
property damage caused by the explosion. Id. at 319-20, 978 
P.2d at 757-58. The insured thereafter voluntarily dismissed the complaint. Id. at 320, 978 P.2d at 758. 
State Farm, together with the other injured parties, 
including the insured, filed a complaint against the tortfeasor, asserting, among other things, a subrogation right of 
reimbursement for the amount of claims paid. Id.The 
tortfeasor moved for summary judgment, arguing that the insured had dismissed with prejudice all claims arising from the 
explosion. Id. at 320-21, 978 P.2d at 758-59. State Farm 
opposed, arguing that it had “acquired rights of subrogation 
against defendants by virtue of benefits paid” to the injured 
parties and that the other injured parties were not party to the 
insured’s settlement agreement. Id. at 321, 978 P.2d at 759. 
The insured argued “he did not intend to settle his property claims with defendants, implying that he was unaware of the 
contents of the Agreement.” Id.
The circuit court granted in part the motion for 
summary judgment.
8 Id. State Farm appealed. Id. at 322, 978 
P.2d at 760. 
8 The circuit court preserved a count arising from an insurance 
claim for damage to another injured party’s automobile, which was 
subsequently voluntarily dismissed. State Farm
, 90 Hawaiʻi at 321-22, 978 
P.2d at 759- 60. 
12  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Two issues were presented before this court: 1) did 
the insured have authority to settle the other injured parties’ 
claims against the tortfeasor; and 2) did the insured’s 
settlement destroy State Farm’s subrogation claims against the 
tortfeasor? Id. at 323, 978 P.2d at 761. 
i. Insured’s actions may affect subrogation rights 
We explained that because subrogation rights may arise 
from contract or from equity, an insurer who has paid for 
damages caused by a third party’s tortious conduct is entitled 
to be subrogated to the insured’s rights against the third party 
“irrespective of the nature of the contract . . . even though 
the policy contains no stipulations to that effect.” Id. at 
328-29, 978 P.2d at 766-67 (emphasis in original) (quoting 8B John A. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice § 4941, at 31-38 
(1981)). The insurer steps into the shoes of the insured and may only assert those rights that the insured had against the 
tortfeasor. Id. at 329, 978 P.2d at 767. Likewise, the 
tortfeasor may raise any defense against the insurer that the tortfeasor had against the insured. Id.Thus, because the 
viability of a subrogation claim is determined by, and limited by, the viability of the insured’s own claim against the 
tortfeasor, an insured may affect an insurer’s right to subrogation, such as through waiver or release. Id.
13  
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Discussing the impact of settlements that purport to 
release the tortfeasor from liability, this court quoted 
extensively from The Law of Liability Insurance: 
[I]f an insured settles with and releases the tortfeasor 
from liability before the insurer pays the loss under the 
terms of the policy, the insurer cannot enforce its right 
to subrogation against the tortfeasor when it does pay the 
claim, unless it can prove that the tortfeasor knew of the 
insurer’ s right of reimbursement or can prove collusion 
between the insured and the tortfeasor in an attempt to defeat the insurer’ s right. The insurer will, however, 
have the right to deny the insured’ s claim on the basis 
that it violated the contract of insurance since it did prejudice the insurer’ s subrogation right.  If the insured 
settles with and releases the tortfeasor after payment is made by the insurer, the insurer is entitled to seek 
reimbursement from the insured. 
The general rule applies when the tortfeasor does not know 
of the existence of the subrogation claim. If the 
tortfeasor or its liability insurer knows of the subrogation claim and settles with the insured, without 
protecting the insurer’ s subrogation claim, the release 
given by the insured does not bar the subrogation claim. The subrogated insurer can still recover from the 
tortfeasor. 
    .
. . . 
The basis of the right the subrogated insurer has to reimbursement if the insured settles and destroys its 
subrogation right appears to be that the insurer is 
prejudiced when it had no knowledge of the settlement. Surprisingly, there is relatively little law concerning 
whether the insurer must prove that it was prejudiced, that 
is, that it could have recovered on the claim, had the 
insured not settled with the tortfeasor. If the insurer 
could not have recovered, it is not prejudiced and has no claim or defense against its insured. 
Id. at 329-30, 978 P.2d at 767-68 (quoting 4 R. Long, The Law of
Liability Insurance § 23.04[1], at 23-41 to 23-42 (1998)) 
(emphasis and ellipsis in original).  9
9 The State Farm court then collected cases from other 
jurisdictions that have adopted a similar approach to resolving subrogation 
(continued . . .) 
14  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Based on the foregoing, we held that 
[I]n the context of fire and casualty insurance, if the 
insurer proves (1) that the tortfeasor had actual or 
constructive knowledge of the insurer’ s subrogation right 
of reimbursement or that the tortfeasor and insured colluded to destroy the insurer’ s subrogation right and (2) 
that the insurer’ s subrogation right of reimbursement is 
actually prejudiced by the insured’ s release of the 
tortfeasor, then the insurer may maintain a subrogation 
action against the tortfeasor. In other words, the 
insured’ s release of the tortfeasor will not affect the 
insurer’ s subrogation right of reimbursement when the 
tortfeasor acts inequitably and causes actual prejudice to the insurer.  
Id. at 330, 978 P.2d at 768. 
Additionally, we concluded that such an approach was 
consistent with our caselaw in Peters, 69 Haw. at 27, 29, 731 
P.2d at 161-62, Grain Dealers Mutual Insurance Co. v. Pacific 
Insurance Co., Ltd, 70 Haw. 211, 217, 768 P.2d 226, 229-30

qualified beneficiary for injuries arising from a motor vehicle 
accident caused by a third-party tortfeasor. Peters, 69 Haw. at 
22-24, 731 P.2d at 159-60. After discussing subrogation 
generally, the Peters court explained that: 
When “the legislature enacts into statute law [sic] a 
common law concept, . . . that is a clue that the courts 
are to interpret [and apply] the statute with the freedom 
with which they would construe and apply a common law 
principle[.]” Posner, Statutory Interpretation— in the 
Classroom and in the Courtroom, 50 U.Chi.L.Rev. 800, 818 
(1983). Under the concept borrowed from the common law 
here, a court “may give restitution . . . and prevent the 
unjust enrichment of the defendant, where the plaintiff’ s 
property has been used in discharging an obligation owed by 
the defendant[.]” Restatement of Restitution § 162 comment 
a (1937). Unjust enrichment in this instance could only be 
prevented if the State is allowed to assert its claim for 
special damages. Otherwise, the defendants may have 
discharged their tort liability for less than what was just 
in the circumstances at the expense of the State; and it would then be unjust for them to retain the benefit of the 
State’s assumption of the obligation to pay the accident 
victim’s medical bills. 
State Farm, 90 Hawaiʻi at 331, 978 P.2d at 769 (quoting Peters, 
69 Haw. at 29, 731 P.2d at 162) (modifications in original, 
internal footnote omitted). 
Construing Peters, we explained in State Farm that 
“[a]pplying principles of common law and equity, the Peters 
court weighed the State’s statutory subrogation rights against 
the tortfeasor’s contractual release rights and held that a 
recipient of state medical assistance lacked the capacity to 
waive the State’s subrogation rights through a settlement or release agreement with the tortfeasor.” Id. (footnote omitted).

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
At bottom, we concluded in State Farm that equity 
demanded protecting the insurer’s rights to subrogation, where 
the insurer performed its contractual obligations in good faith: 
Equity simply does not support the conclusion that the 
insurer, which has performed its contractual obligations 
under the policy in good faith, should be forced to 
unjustly enrich a tortfeasor who attempted to settle a 
claim with knowledge of the insurer’ s subrogation claim.  
Where the insurer’ s subrogation right clashes with the 
tortfeasor’ s contractual release right, the insurer’ s 
subrogation right will prevail if the tortfeasor acted inequitably. 
Id. at 333, 978 P.2d at 771 (emphasis in original). 
ii. Insurer’s actions may affect subrogation rights 
Like an insured, an insurer’s actions may also affect 
its own subrogation rights. 
As we explained, 
[a]n insurer may relinquish its subrogation rights, either 
knowingly or unknowingly. It may do this expressly by 
waiving its right to subrogation or by engaging in conduct 
inconsistent with its exercise of its subrogation right. Thus, an insurer’ s failure to assert its subrogation right 
may be construed as a waiver.  
Id. at 333, 978 P.2d at 771 (quoting The Law of Liability
Insurance § 23.04[2], supra, at 23-45 to 23-46). 
We further relied on our decision in Grain Dealers, 
where we explained that “[t]his right of subrogation . . . is 
not absolute. . . . Equitable principles dictate that the 
subrogee exercise reasonable diligence to protect its subrogation interest.” Id. (quoting Grain Dealers, 70 Haw. at 
217, 768 P.2d at 230) (emphasis omitted)(ellipses in original). In State Farm, we held that “a genuine issue of material fact 
remain[ed] as to whether State Farm Fire exercised due diligence 
17  
 
  
 
    
  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
in asserting its subrogation rights.” Id. at 333-34, 978 P.2d 
at 771-72. 
We also explained that this interpretation was 
consistent with HRS § 663-10,10 which “provides further support 
for an equitable requirement of diligence, insofar as it 
provides protection for an insurer that exercises due diligence 
by filing a timely notice of its claim.” Id. at 333, 978 P.2d 
at 771. 
iii. State Farm and the made whole doctrine 
As a final matter, the State Farm court discussed the 
made whole doctrine in two explanatory footnotes. Id. at 328 
nn.8-9, 978 P.2d at 766 nn.8-9. Early in our discussion, we 
clarified that there are two types of subrogation: “‘Equitable 
subrogation’ (sometimes called, curiously enough, ‘legal 
subrogation’) is a principle of equity; it is effected by 
10 HRS § 663-10 (1993) as it was then effective provided: 
Collateral sources; protection for liens and rights of 
subrogation. In any civil action in tort, the court, 
before any judgment or stipulation to dismiss the action is 
approved, shall determine the validity of any claim of a lien against the amount of the judgment or settlement by 
any person who files timely notice of the claim to the 
court or to the parties in the action. The judgment entered, or the order subsequent to settlement, shall 
include a statement of the amounts, if any, due and owing 
to any person determined by the court to be a holder of a 
valid lien and to be paid to the lienholder out of the 
amount of the corresponding special damages recovered by the judgment or settlement[.]

    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
operation of law and arises out of a relationship that need not 
be contractually based. ‘Conventional subrogation’ arises out 
of the contractual relationship of the parties. . . .” Id. at 
328, 978 P.2d at 766 (footnotes omitted). 
There, following the first quoted sentence, we 
explained, in footnote 8, the equitable basis of subrogation: 
Regarding legal or equitable subrogation, The Law of 
Liability Insurance, supra, § 23.02[2], at 23.8– 13 states 
that 
[a]n insurer’ s right to legal or equitable 
subrogation arises only when certain requirements are 
met. First, the insurer must have paid the loss. 
The right extends to the extent of the amount 
actually paid and the amount paid must have been paid to the insured. 
In addition, the amount paid by the insurer must 
result in the insured’ s being made “whole.”  The 
general rule is that the subrogated insurer is entitled to no subrogation, or to reduced subrogation, if the result of full subrogation would 
be to cause the insured to be less than fully 
compensated for the loss, although some cases hold to 
the contrary. . . . 
Courts have taken three approaches to the issue of 
whether or not subrogation will be allowed when the 
insured has not been fully compensated. One approach 
is to find that the insurer is entitled to the full 
amount of its subrogation, whether or not its insured 
is made whole. Another is to find that the insurer is entitled to no subrogation until the insured 
recovers his entire loss, between the insurance 
payment and the recovery from the tortfeasor. The 
third approach is to hold that the court should make 
an equitable distribution of any recovery from the tortfeasor, in light of all of the circumstances. 
    . . . . 
The second requirement for the existence of the right 
to legal subrogation is that the insurer must not 
have merely volunteered to pay the loss, but must have been required to pay based upon[, for example, 
operation of law or a] . . . contract of 
insurance. . 
. . 
19  
 
  
 
 
 
    
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Finally, since legal subrogation is equitable in 
nature, the right will not be enforced unless the 
rights of the party seeking it are greater than the 
rights of others. 
(Footnotes omitted.) (Brackets added.) 
State Farm, 90 Hawaiʻ i at 328 n.8, 978 P.2d at 766 n.8 
(alterations in original). 
Then, following the second quoted sentence, we 
contrasted, in footnote 9, equitable from contractual 
subrogation rights: 
Regarding conventional or contractual subrogation, The Law 
of Liability Insurance, supra, § 23.03[1][a], at 23.18.1– 
18.2, and § 23.03[4], at 23– 37 also states: 
The right to conventional subrogation, as opposed to 
legal subrogation, does not depend upon principles of equity. When subrogation claimed by an insurer is 
based on contract, the subrogation provisions of the 
policy constitute the sole measure of its rights. In 
such a case, the insurer’ s rights would be subject to 
any limitations contained in the contract of 
insurance. 
    ..
. . 
The statute of limitations for the insurer as 
subrogee is the same as the statute of limitations 
applicable to the subrogor. For example, if the subrogation claim is based on tort, the tort statute 
of limitations will apply. . . 
. 
(Footnotes omitted.) Therefore, principles of equity may apply to a payment made pursuant to a contract. Any 
subrogation terms written into that contract, however, will govern. 
State Farm, 90 Hawaiʻ i at 328 n.9, 978 P.2d at 766 n.9 
(alterations in original). 
Despite providing the most comprehensive examination 
of the made whole doctrine in our caselaw, the State Farm court 
20  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
did not expressly adopt or otherwise address the status of the 
made whole doctrine in Hawaiʻ i. 
b. Yukumoto v. Tawarahara 
In Yukumoto v. Tawarahara, decided in 2017, we held 
that 
State Farm  does  not apply to situations involving an 
insurer’s right to subrogation in the context of personal 
insurance such as the instant case, and thus, here, [the health insurer] does not have equitable subrogation rights. 
We also conclude that the legislature intended to limit a 
health insurer’ s right of subrogation under HRS §§ 663- 10 
and 431:13- 103.  Thus, we conclude that any contractual 
provision that conflicts with HRS § 663- 10 is invalid, and 
that [the health insurer]  is not entitled to contractual 
subrogation rights.  
140 Hawaiʻi at 291, 400 P.3d at 492. 
There, the insured was driving a moped when he was 
struck by a third-party tortfeasor, causing serious bodily 
injury, including brain damage. Id.
 at 287, 400 P.3d at 488. 
The injured party filed a complaint in circuit court against the third-party tortfeasor. Id.The insured’s health insurer, 
Hawaii Medical Service Association (HMSA), subsequently filed a “Notice of Claim of Lien” in the amount of approximately 
$325,000 for payment of medical expenses arising from the 
collision, which was later revised to more than $339,000. Id.
at 287-89, 400 P.3d at 488-90. 
The insured petitioned the circuit court for a 
determination of the validity of the lien, arguing that because 
the settlement contained a general—damages only release that 
21  
 
  
  
 
 
  
   
   
  
  
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
left the insured undercompensated,11 HMSA had no lien or 
subrogation rights under HRS § 663-10. Id. at 287-88, 400 P.3d 
at 488-89. 
HMSA opposed, arguing that HRS § 663-10 did not 
abrogate its contractual lien or subrogation rights, but rather 
provided for a separate statutory right to assert a lien against 
the insured’s settlement. Id. at 288, 400 P.3d at 489. 
Ultimately the circuit court ruled in favor of the 
insured, concluding that HMSA “is not entitled to a payment of 
the amount of its claimed lien.”12 Id. at 290, 400 P.3d at 491. 
HMSA appealed the circuit court’s final judgment and 
the appeal was transferred to this court. Id.We affirmed the 
circuit court. Id. at 299, 400 P.3d at 500. 
11 The insured alleged approximately $4,000,000 in lost wages and 
general damages. Yukumoto
, 140 Hawaiʻi at 287, 400 P.3d at 488. The 
settlement included a policy maximum from the third- party tortfeasor’s 
insurer of $1,100,000 and an additional $50,000 in underinsured motorist 
coverage. Id. Thus, the insured alleged they were underinsured by 
approximately $2,850,000. Id. 
12 Like many subrogation cases, Yukumoto presented a complex 
procedural history. For example, the health insurer sought judgment against the third- party tortfeasor for its payment of medical expenses on behalf of 
the insured in a complaint in intervention. Yukumoto, 140 Hawaiʻ i at 
288- 89, 
400 P.3d at 489- 90. The health insurer also filed a separate complaint 
seeking to enforce its subrogation rights against the tortfeasor. Id. Both 
the complaint in intervention and the separate complaint were dismissed because the circuit court found that HRS § 663-10 was the exclusive remedy 
for the health insurer to seek reimbursement for its payments. Id. at 288

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
i. No equitable right to subrogation for health 
insurers 
First, we held a health insurer does not have 
equitable subrogation rights against a third-party tortfeasor. 
Id. at 294, 400 P.3d at 495. We began by recognizing that 
“[s]ubrogation is a ‘creature of equity,’ and is premised on the notion that an insured should not be able to ‘unduly benefit 
from a loss and thereby enjoy a “double recovery” from both the 
insurer and the tortfeasor.’” Id. at 291, 400 P.3d at 492 
(quoting St. Paul Fire
, 135 Hawaiʻi at 452, 353 P.3d at 994, and 
Roger Baron, 
Subrogation: A Pandora’s Box Awaiting Closure, 41 
S.D.L.Rev. 237, 241 (1996)). We then explained that 
“[s]ubrogation exists to provide insurers with a mechanism ‘to 
recover the costs of reimbursing injured insured parties.’” Id.
at 292, 400 P.3d at 493 (quoting Johnny C. Parker, The Made Whole Doctrine: Unraveling the Enigma Wrapped in the Mystery of 
Insurance Subrogation, 70 Mo.L.Rev. 723, 723 (2005)). 
Relying extensively on precedent from the New Jersey 
Supreme Court, we distinguished “[s]ubrogation rights in the ‘personal insurance’ context . . . from subrogation rights in 
the property or casualty insurance context” on the basis that 
“the two types of insurance cover different losses.” Id.
(citing Perreira v. Rediger, 778 A.2d 429, 437-38 (2001)) (footnote omitted). We explained that “Courts have applied the 
23  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
principle of equitable subrogation to property and casualty 
insurance policies because ‘the insured’s actual loss is 
generally liquidated in the context of property insurance,’ and 
‘any excess compensation from the combination of insurance 
proceeds and tort recovery can be determined with certainty.’” Id. (quoting Parker, supra, at 729) (footnote omitted). We then 
quoted extensively from Perreira’s discussion of subrogation 
rights. 
Subrogation rights are common under policies of property or 
casualty insurance, wherein the insured sustains a fixed 
financial loss, and the purpose is to place that loss ultimately on the wrongdoer. To permit the insured in such 
instances to recover from both the insurer and the 
wrongdoer would permit him to profit unduly thereby. 
In personal insurance contracts, however, the exact loss is 
never capable of ascertainment. Life and death, health, 
physical well being, and such matters are incapable of 
exact financial estimation. There are, accordingly, not the same reasons militating against a double recovery. The 
general rule is, therefore, that the insurer is not 
subrogated to the insured’ s rights or to the beneficiary’ s 
rights under contracts of personal insurance, at least in the absence of a policy provision so providing. Nor would a settlement by the insured with the wrongdoer bar his 
cause of action against the insurer. However, if a 
subrogation provision were expressly contained in such 
contracts, it probably would be enforced quite uniformly. 
Such a provision cannot be read into a policy by calling it an indemnity contract, however. 
Id. at 292-93, 400 P.3d at 493-94 (quoting Perreira, 778 A.2d at 
438). 
We then explained that “ Hawaiʻi courts have also 
recognized the differences between subrogation rights for 
property/casualty insurance and subrogation rights for personal 
insurance.” Id. at 293, 400 P.3d at 494. We contrasted our 
24  
 
  
  
 
 
 
    
  
   
  
 
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
decision in State Farm, where we followed the majority rule in 
the context of property insurance, with the ICA’s decision in 
Rutledge, where the ICA limited an insurer’s right to 
subrogation. Id. In State Farm, “[t]his court held that ‘in 
the context of fire and casualty insurance . . . the insurer may maintain a subrogation action against the tortfeasor’ regardless 
of outside settlement.” Id. (quoting 90 Hawaiʻ i at 330, 978 P.2d 
at 768) (alterations in original). In contrast, in Rutledge, 
The ICA ruled that an insurance carrier providing 
[uninsured motorist (UM)] coverage is “entitled to 
reimbursement for payments it makes to an accident victim to the extent the victim’ s total recovery from all sources 
exceeds his or her damages [but] the carrier is entitled to no reduction of UM coverage . . . where the victim is not 
fully compensated.” [Rutledge, 87 Hawaiʻ i at 346, 955 P.2d 
at 1078] (quoting Bradley v. H.A. Manosh Corp.
, 157 Vt. 
477, 601 A.2d 978, 983
-84 (1991)). Therefore, the ICA 
concluded that “in the allocation of tort recovery proceeds 
and UM benefits, we agree with the principle of full but 
not duplicative recovery of damages by the injured insured.” Id. 
Yukumoto, 140 Hawai͑i at 293, 400 P.3d at 494. 
The Yukumoto court also discussed our decision in Sol
v. AIG Hawaiʻ i Insurance Co., where we explained that “because 
the legislature ‘intended to prevent no-fault insurers from 
subrogating against the optional additional coverages, uninsured 
motorist coverage is exempt from no-fault reimbursement.’” 
Id.
at 294, 400 P.3d at 495 (quoting Sol, 76 Hawaiʻ i 304, 308, 875 
P.2d 921, 925 (1994)). 
25  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Ultimately, we concluded that the equitable 
considerations that support subrogation do not exist in the 
context of personal insurance. Id. We reasoned: 
Situations involving tort recovery in personal insurance 
contexts, like the instant case, often include payment by 
the tortfeasor for intangible losses such as life, death, 
health, pain and suffering, and physical well being, where 
it is difficult to ascertain exact measurements of loss. In this way, recovery for medical insurance benefits and 
tort damages do not involve the principles which support 
our recognition of equitable subrogation in the 
property/casualty context, and recovery does not 
necessarily produce a windfall or duplicative recovery to the insured. 
Id. 
ii. Reimbursement limited to lien under 
HRS §§ 663-10 and 431:13-103 
Next, the Yukumoto court turned to an analysis of HRS 
§§ 663-10 and 431:13-103(a)(10), holding that the plain language 
of HRS § 663-10 (Supp. 2002) limited the subrogation rights of 
health insurers.  Id. In particular, we noted that the statute 
“applie[d] broadly to ‘any claim of a lien[,]’” including those arising from collateral sources, such as “health insurance or 
benefits.” Id. at 295, 400 P.3d at 496 (quoting HRS 13
13 Before reaching the plain language of the statute, the Yukumoto 
court looked to the statute’s title, reasoning: 
As reflected in its title, “Collateral sources; protection 
for liens and rights of subrogation”, the statute provides 
a comprehensive structure for addressing liens and 
subrogation rights in this context. 
140 Hawaiʻi at 294-95, 400 P.3d at 495- 96 (emphasis in original). 
26  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
§ 663-10(a)). Thus, we concluded that HRS § 663-10 applies to 
health insurers. Id. Next, we noted that because recovery from 
a lien is limited to the “special damages recovered by the 
judgment or settlement” and does not include recovery from 
general damages, health insurers’ subrogation rights were limited. Id. (emphasis in original). 
We then turned to the legislative history of HRS §§ 
663-10 and 431:13-103(a)(10), which we found to be consistent 
with the interpretation that “a health insurer’s sole rights to 
reimbursement and subrogation are provided for in those 
statutes[.]” Id. at 295-96, 400 P.3d 496-97. In particular, we 
looked at the legislative history for the 2000 and 2002 amendments to HRS chapters 663 and 431. Id. at 296-98, 400 P.3d 
497-99. After reviewing the committee reports for S.B. No. 2563 
(2000) and S.B. No. 940 (2001-02), we concluded: 
HRS § 663-10’s legislative history supports the conclusion 
that [a health insurer’ s] sole rights to reimbursement and 
subrogation are provided for in HRS §§ 663-10 and 431-
13:103(a)(1) [sic].  First, the drafters indicated that 
“all of the rights and obligations of health benefit 
providers and consumers” are provided for in HRS § 663-10 
for third- party liability situations, thus creating a 
“uniform and comprehensive procedure” for health insurers’ subrogation and reimbursement rights. H. Stand. Comm. Rep. 
No. 1330- 00, in 2000 House Journal, at 1515.  The drafters 
also stated that “health insurers have always been subject to [the] limitations” under HRS § 663-10, and “continue to 
be entitled to reimbursement of their subrogation liens” 
under HRS § 663-10.  Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 67- 02, in 2002 
House Journal, at 1783. Therefore, the legislature intended for HRS § 663- 10 to serve as the authority which 
controls all of a health insurer’ s obligations and rights 
regarding reimbursement and subrogation benefits from third-party sources of recovery, which negates any argument 
27  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that HRS § 663-10 applies only to reimbursement of an 
insurer by an insured. See H. Stand. Comm. No. 1330- 00, in 
2000 House Journal, at 1515. 
Id. at 298, 400 P.3d at 499. 
iii. No contractual subrogation rights 
Finally, we rejected HMSA’s argument that their 
subrogation rights were preserved where their contract expressly 
provided for those rights. Id.Relying on our opinion in Sol, 
we explained that “[w]hen the terms of an insurance contract are in conflict with statutory language, the statute must take 
precedence over the terms of the contract.” Id. (quoting Sol, 
76 Hawaiʻ i at 307, 875 P.2d at 924) (brackets in original).  
Thus, because HRS § 663-10 limits an insurer’s subrogation 
rights to a statutory lien against a settlement, HMSA was not 
entitled to contractual subrogation. Id.
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Reserved Questions 
A reserved question that presents a question of law is 
“reviewable de novo under the right/wrong standard of 
review.” State v. Jess, 117 Hawaiʻ i  381, 391, 184 P.3d 133, 
143 (2008) (quoting Roes v. FHP, Inc., 91 Hawaiʻ i 470, 473, 
985 P.2d 661, 664 (1999)). 
“On a reserved question we are 
required to answer a question of law based on facts 
reported to this court by the circuit judge. We may not 
express an opinion on a question of law by assuming certain 
facts as to which the circuit judge has made no finding.”

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B. Statutory Interpretation 
Statutory interpretation is “a question of law reviewable 
de novo.” This court’ s construction of statutes is guided 
by established rules: 
First, the fundamental starting point for 
statutory interpretation is the language of the 
statute itself. Second, where the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, our sole 
duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious 
meaning. Third, implicit in the task of 
statutory construction is our foremost 
obligation to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, which is to be 
obtained primarily from the language contained 
in the statute itself. Fourth, when there is 
doubt, doubleness of meaning, or 
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an ambiguity 
exists. 
When there is ambiguity in a statute, “the meaning of the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the 
context, with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain 
their true meaning.” Moreover, the courts may resort 
to extrinsic aids in determining legislative intent, 
such as legislative history, or the reason and spirit 
of the law.

IV. DISCUSSION 
As indicated in our February 10, 2025 order, we hold 
that in the context of a tort settlement, HRS § 663-10 is the 
exclusive remedy for a property and casualty insurer to recover 
claims paid for damages caused by a third-party tortfeasor. 
We 
also hold that, because the statutory lien is the exclusive 
remedy for a property and casualty insurer to recover claims 
29  
 
  
 
   
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
paid to its insured in the context of a tort settlement, an 
insurer’s rights are not prejudiced by its insured’s release of 
a tortfeasor where the settlement documents and release preserve 
the insurer’s reimbursement rights under HRS § 663-10. Finally, 
given our answers to Reserved Questions 1 and 2, and the record before this court, we decline to apply the made whole doctrine 
to the statutory lien-claim process defined by HRS §§ 431:13-
103(a)(10) and 663-10 under the circumstances of this mass tort 
case. A.  Reserved Question 1 
Question 1: 
Does the holding of Yukumoto v. Tawarahara, 140 Haw[ aiʻi] 
285 [], 400 P.3d 486[] (2017)[,] that limited the 
subrogation remedies available to health insurers to 
reimbursement from their insureds under HRS § 663-10 and 
barred independent actions against tortfeasors who settled with the insureds extend to property and casualty insurance carriers? 
Because we conclude that, under HRS 
§ 431:13-103(a)(10)(A), the lien-claim process established by 
HRS § 663-10 provides the exclusive remedy for an insurer to 
recover for claims paid to an insured for damages caused by a 
third-party tortfeasor where the insured has settled with the tortfeasor, we answer question 1 in the affirmative. 
We reject the Subrogating Insurers’ argument that HRS 
§ 431:13-103(a)(10)(A) only applies to circumstances where the 
insurer has withheld payment, recognizing instead the 
30  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
legislature’s manifest intent that an insurer’s recovery be 
limited to the HRS § 663-10 lien-claim process in all cases 
where its insured recovers damages by judgment or settlement of 
a third-party tort claim. 
We also clarify that HRS § 663-10 does not apply in 
the absence of a settlement or judgment. Thus, where there is no competition between the insured and the insurer for recovery, 
a property and casualty insurance carrier’s equitable 
subrogation rights are preserved. In this regard, our decision 
in this case reflects the distinct types of losses covered by 
personal insurance compared to property and casualty insurance 
and, as recognized by our court in Yukumoto
, the differences 
between equitable subrogation rights. 140 Hawaiʻi at 292, 400 
P.3d at 493. 
1. Property and casualty insurers’ rights to subrogation 
and reimbursement under HRS §§ 663-10 and 431:13-103 
In 
Yukumoto, we held that, in the context of a tort 
settlement between an insured plaintiff and a third-party 
tortfeasor, a health insurer is barred from bringing an 
independent subrogation action against the tortfeasor. 140 
Hawai‘i at 298, 400 P.3d at 499.  This is because the statutory 
procedure established by HRS §§ 663-10 and 431:13-103(a)(10)(A) 
“comprehensively addresses and limits a health insurers’ rights 
to reimbursement and subrogation.” Id.We are now asked 
31  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
whether that same statutory procedure extends to limit the subrogation rights of a property and casualty insurer in the 
context of a tort settlement. We hold that it does. 
Our analysis here, as in Yukumoto, turns on our 
interpretation of the two statutes, HRS §§ 431:13-103 and 663-10. When construing the application and scope of a 
statutory provision, “our foremost obligation is to ‘give effect 
to the intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained 
primarily from the language contained in the statute itself.’” 
Hawaiian Dredging Constr. Co. v. Fujikawa Assocs., Inc., 142 
Hawai‘i 429, 435, 420 P.3d 360, 366 (2018) (quoting 
Morgan v. 
Plan. Dep’t, Cnty. of Kaua‘i
, 104 Hawai‘i 173, 179, 86 P.3d 982, 
988 (2004)). Further, “we must read statutory language in the 
context of the entire statute and construe it in a manner 
consistent with its purpose.” Id.
 (quoting Morgan
, 104 Hawai‘i 
at 179, 86 P.3d at 988). 
Here, the plain language, legislative history, and 
purpose of the relevant statutes lead us to conclude that, where 
an insured pursues a settlement or judgment from a third-party 
tortfeasor, the legislature intended to limit a property and 
casualty insurer’s right of reimbursement to the lien-claim 
process prescribed by HRS § 663-10. 
32  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
a. The plain language of HRS §§ 431:13-103(a)(10) 
and 663-10 
We held in Yukumoto that “the plain language of HRS 
§ 663-10 supports the conclusion that [a health insurer’s] 
subrogation rights are limited.” 140 Hawai‘ i at 295, 400 P.3d at 
496. 
Read on its face, that same language operates to limit the 
subrogation rights of any collateral source, including a 
property and casualty insurer, within the context of “any civil action in tort.” HRS § 663-10(a). HRS § 663-10(a) provides: 
§ 663-10  Collateral sources; protection for liens 
and rights of subrogation. (a)   In any civil action in 
tort, the court, before any judgment or stipulation to 
dismiss the action is approved, shall determine the 
validity of any claim of a lien against the amount of the 
judgment or settlement by any person who files timely 
notice of the claim to the court or to the parties in the 
action. The judgment entered, or the order subsequent to settlement, shall include a statement of the amounts, if 
any, due and owing to any person determined by the court to 
be a holder of a valid lien and to be paid to the 
lienholder out of the amount of the corresponding special 
damages recovered by the judgment or settlement. In determining the payment due the lienholder, the court shall 
deduct from the payment a reasonable sum for the costs and 
fees incurred by the party who brought the civil action in 
tort. As used in this section, lien means a lien arising 
out of a claim for payments made or indemnified from collateral sources, including health insurance or benefits, 
for costs and expenses arising out of the injury which is 
the subject of the civil action in tort. If there is a 
settlement before suit is filed or there is no civil action 
pending, then any party may  petition a court of competent 
jurisdiction for a determination of the validity and amount 
of any claim of a lien.  
As we have previously recognized, the title of the 
statute, “Collateral sources; protection for liens and rights of 
subrogation,” indicates that HRS § 663-10 is plainly intended to 
provide “a comprehensive structure for addressing liens and 
33  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
subrogation rights” whenever an insured party pursues a judgment 
or settlement from a third-party tortfeasor. Yukumoto, 140 
Hawai‘i at 294-95, 400 P.3d at 495-96; see also Tauese v. Dep’t
of Lab. & Indus. Rels., 113 Hawai‘ i 1, 37, 147 P.3d 785, 821 
(2006) (citing Honolulu Star Bull., Ltd. v. Burns, 50 Haw. 603, 606, 446 P.2d 171, 173 (1968)) (reiterating that a statute’s 
title may be referred to as an aid in construing its 
application). This is further reflected in the plain language 
of the statute, which evinces a broad application to “any claim 
of a lien . . . arising out of a claim for payments made or 
indemnified from collateral sources . . . for costs and expenses arising out of the injury which is the subject of the civil 
action in tort.” HRS § 663-10(a); see Yukumoto, 140 Hawai‘ i at 
295, 400 P.3d at 496. 
When an injured party pursues a settlement or civil 
action in tort, HRS § 663-10 places an affirmative duty on the 
court to protect the reimbursement rights of insurers and other 
collateral sources. HRS § 663-10(a); Yukumoto
, 140 Hawai‘i at 
295, 400 P.3d at 496. Prior to the entry of judgment or the 
approval of any settlement, the court “
shall determine the 
validity of any claim of a lien against the amount of the judgment or settlement by any person who files timely notice of 
the claim.” HRS § 663-10(a) (emphasis added). Once a judgment 
34  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
or settlement is reached, “[t]he judgment entered, or the order 
subsequent to settlement, shall include a statement of the 
amounts, if any, due and owing to any person determined by the 
court to be a holder of a valid lien.” Id. (emphasis added); 
Yukumoto, 140 Hawai‘ i at 295, 400 P.3d at 496. 
While HRS § 663-10 protects an insurer’s rights of 
reimbursement, it also limits what any insurer or other 
collateral source may recover to “the amount of the 
corresponding special damages recovered by the judgment or 
settlement.” HRS § 663-10(a) (emphasis added); Yukumoto
, 140 
Hawai‘i at 295, 400 P.3d at 496.  As discussed below, this 
limitation reflects the legislature’s intent to balance the 
insurer’s right to reimbursement with the insured plaintiff’s 
right to be fairly compensated for their injury. The statute 
further limits the amount of an insurer’s recovery by directing 
the court to “deduct from the payment” to the lienholder “a 
reasonable sum for the costs and fees incurred by the party who 
brought the civil action in tort.” HRS § 663-10(a). Moreover, the lien-claim process is the exclusive means of recovery for a 
collateral source under HRS § 663-10, as the statute does not 
provide for subrogation or any direct action by the collateral 
source lienholder against the defendant in tort. 
See id.
The language of HRS § 663-10 does not by itself 
preclude an insurance entity from pursuing its own subrogation 
35  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
claim against a third-party tortfeasor. That directive is 
instead found in article 13 of the Insurance Code, HRS chapter 
431. The purpose of article 13 is “to regulate trade practice 
in the business of insurance . . . by defining, or providing for 
the determination of, all acts, methods, and practices which constitute unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive 
acts or practices.” HRS § 431:13-101. Specific “[u]nfair 
methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or 
practices” are defined under HRS § 431:13-103. 
One unfair practice defined includes “limiting 
coverage available to an individual because the individual may 
have a third-party claim for recovery of damages; provided that: . . . [w]here damages are recovered by judgment or settlement of 
a third-party claim, reimbursement of past benefits paid shall 
be allowed pursuant to section 663-10.” HRS § 431:13-
103(a)(10)(A) (emphasis added). 
Where the plain language of HRS 
§ 663-10 is at all ambiguous as to that statute’s application in 
the insurance context, “the fact that [HRS] § 431:13-103 
explicitly incorporates [HRS] § 663-10, leaves no doubt that the 
Hawai‘i Statutes must be read together.” Rudel v. Haw. Mgmt.
All. Ass’n
, 937 F.3d 1262, 1273 (9th Cir. 2019). And together, 
“[HRS] §§ 431:13-103(a) and 663-10 are specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance.” Id. at 1274 (internal 
quotations omitted). Thus, in the context of a third-party tort 
36  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
judgment or settlement, HRS § 431:13-103(a)(10)(A) limits an 
insurer’s means of reimbursement to the lien-claim procedure 
defined by HRS § 663-10. Id. at 1273-74. Together, the two 
statutes construct a framework that “comprehensively addresses and limits” an insurer’s rights to reimbursement and 
subrogation. See Yukumoto, 140 Hawai‘ i at 298, 400 P.3d at 499; 
Rudel, 937 F.3d at 1274. 
Moreover, there is nothing in the plain language of 
either HRS §§ 663-10 or 431:13-103(a)(10) to indicate that the 
procedure prescribed by those statutes should apply solely to 
health insurers and not extend to property and casualty 
insurers. HRS chapter 431, article 13 broadly regulates “trade 
practice in the business of insurance,” an umbrella under which 
property and casualty insurers are indisputably covered. See
HRS § 431:13-101; Rudel, 937 F.3d at 1273 (“[HRS] § 431:13-103 unquestionably regulates insurance.”). Further, the relevant provision, HRS § 431:13-103(a)(10), expressly provides specific 
exemptions for workers compensation and motor vehicle insurance 
carriers. HRS § 431:13-103(a)(10)(B) (“This paragraph shall not 
apply to entities licensed under chapter 386 or 431:10C.”). 
Notably, rights of subrogation and reimbursement for those 
entities are defined by their own, separate statutory 
procedures. See HRS § 386-8; § 431:10C-307. By contrast, 
property and casualty insurers are not specifically exempted 
37  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
from HRS § 431:13-103(a)(10). And “it is generally presumed 
that the legislature acts intentionally and purposely in the 
disparate inclusion or exclusion of terms in its statutes.” 
Rosehill v. Land Use Comm’n, 155 Hawai‘ i 41, 54, 556 P.3d 387, 
400 (2024) (internal quotations omitted) (quoting In re Application of Gas Co., 147 Hawai‘ i 186, 200, 465 P.3d 633, 647 
(2020)). 
Property and casualty insurers are thus subject to the 
terms of HRS § 431:13-103(a)(10) and, by extension, the 
reimbursement procedure defined by HRS § 663-10. 
As noted above, HRS § 663-10 applies to “any claim
 of 
a lien against the amount of the judgment or settlement by any person.” (Emphasis added). A lien is defined as “a lien 
arising out of a claim for payments made or indemnified from 
collateral sources, including health insurance or benefits, for 
costs and expenses arising out of the injury which is the 
subject of the civil action in tort.” HRS § 663-10(a). Here, 
the phrase “including health insurance or benefits” does not 
exclude other collateral sources, such as property and casualty insurers, from the scope of the statute. See In re Waikoloa
Sanitary Sewer Co.
, 109 Hawai‘i 263, 274, 125 P.3d 484, 495 
(2005) (brackets in original) (quoting 
Fed. Land Bank of St. 
Paul v. Bismarck Lumber Co., 314 U.S. 95, 99-100 (1941)) (“[T]he term ‘including’ is not one of all-embracing definition, but 
connotes simply an illustrative application of the general 
38  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
principle.”); State v. Tsujimura , 140 Hawai‘i 299, 307, 400 P.3d 
500, 508 (2017) (citing 
Lealaimatafao v. Woodward-Clyde 
Consultants, 75 Haw. 544, 556, 867 P.2d 220, 226 (1994)) (“[T]he list that follows ‘including’ is regarded as non-exhaustive 
examples of the general definitional clause.”) (emphasis in 
original). Rather, as discussed below, that language is merely 
intended to clarify that the provision indeed applies to health 
insurers. See Tsujimura
, 140 Hawai‘i at 307, 400 P.3d at 508 
(quoting 
State v. Guyton
, 135 Hawai‘i 372, 379 n.14, 351 P.3d 
1138, 1145 n.14 (2015)) (“‘[I]ncluding’ means either ‘an 
enlargement and has the meaning of 
and or in addition to, or 
merely specifies a particular thing already included within the general words theretofore used.’”). 
In sum, a plain reading of HRS §§ 663-10 and 
431:13-103(a)(10) indicates that the legislature intended to limit an insurer’s subrogation and reimbursement rights when 
their insured pursues damages by judgment or settlement of a 
third-party tort claim. Further, nothing in the plain language 
of those statutes suggests that property and casualty insurers 
should be exempt from the comprehensive procedure they define. 
This reading is consistent with the purpose of those provisions 
as illustrated by the legislative history laid out below. 
39  
 
  
 
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
b. The legislative history of HRS 
§§ 431:13-103(a)(10) and 663-10 
In 1986, responding to a “crisis in liability 
insurance,” the legislature passed S.B. S1-86, which comprised 
“a comprehensive combination of reforms to both the tort system 
and the insurance regulatory system.” 1986 Special Sess. Haw. Sess. Laws Act 2, § 1 at 3. The bill added a number of new 
statutes across various HRS chapters and was considered by the 
legislature as “a complex, coherent bill, which embodies the 
demands and concessions of many different segments of our 
community.” H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 4-86, in 1986 House 
Journal, at 40. 
Included as part of this “complex, coherent bill” was 
the statutory section that would later be codified as HRS § 663-10 (1993),  which addressed rights of subrogation and 
reimbursement for collateral sources who have made payments for 
14
14 HRS § 663- 10 (1993) as originally enacted provided in full: 
Collateral sources; protection for liens and rights 
of subrogation.   In any civil action in tort, the court, 
before any judgment or stipulation to dismiss the action is 
approved, shall determine the validity of any claim of a 
lien against the amount of the judgment or settlement by 
any person who files timely notice of the claim to the 
court or to the parties in the action. The judgment entered or the order subsequent to settlement, shall 
include a statement of the amounts, if any, due and owing 
to any person determined by the court to be a holder of a 
valid lien and to be paid to the lienholder out of the 
amount of the corresponding special damages recovered by the judgment or settlement. In determining the payment due 
the lienholder, the court shall deduct from the payment a 
reasonable sum for the costs and fees incurred by the party 
(continued . . .) 
40  
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“costs and expenses arising out of the injury.” 1986 Special 
Sess. Haw. Sess. Laws Act 2, § 16 at 10; Yukumoto, 140 Hawai‘ i at 
296, 400 P.3d at 497. The purpose of this particular 
legislation was “to ensure that claimants who recover damages in 
tort actions do not receive double payments for costs and 
expenses arising out of the tort action.” S. Special Comm. Rep. 
No. S5-86, in 1986 Senate Journal, at 28. At the same time, the legislature was mindful to protect a claimant’s recovery for 
uninsured damages by imposing limitations on a collateral source 
lienholder’s right to reimbursement. The House Committee on 
Judiciary and Health provided the following in its report: 
There is provided in this section a mechanism which 
would serve to avoid, upon the giving of timely notice, 
double payment in tort actions from collateral source 
lienholders who may have paid for costs or expenses arising out of the injury which is the subject of the tort action. 
A post-judgment or post- settlement proceedings [sic] before 
the court would establish first, the validity of liens of collateral source payors and second, that payment on those 
liens or so much thereof is deducted from the proceeds of the special damages awarded to the plaintiff. Finally, 
this section provides that where a collateral source 
lienholder is entitled to be paid out of the judgment or 
settlement, the court will first deduct from such payment a 
reasonable sum for the costs and fees incurred by the party who brought the underlying tort action and thus made it 
possible for the lienholder to be paid.  
(. . . continued) 
who brought the civil action in tort. As used in this section, lien means a lien arising out of a claim for 
payments made or indemnified from collateral sources for costs and expenses arising out of the injury which is the 
subject of the civil action in tort.  
1986 Special Sess. Haw. Sess. Laws Act 2, § 16 at 10. 
41  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The intent of this provision is to prevent double 
payments from collateral source[s]  for costs or expenses 
arising out of the injury for which the plaintiff has 
brought the tort action and is awarded a judgment therefor. The collateral source lienholders have been limited only to 
that portion of the settlement or judgment which is 
designated as special damages  so as not to deprive the 
plaintiff of any award for noneconomic damages which is not covered by collateral source payment for costs and expenses already made.  
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 4-86, in 1986 House Journal, at 42-43 
(emphasis added). 
In the insurance context, limiting an insurer’s 
recovery to special damages provides a logical means to balance 
the insurer’s right to reimbursement with the insured plaintiff’s right to be compensated for their injury. Unlike 
general damages, which are difficult to determine exactly, 
special damages typically correspond with economic loss and are 
thus easier to quantify. See Yukumoto, 140 Hawai‘ i at 295, 400 
P.3d at 496; Lima v. Deutsche Bank Nat’l Tr. Co., 149 Hawai‘ i 
457, 466, 494 P.3d 1190, 1199 (2021) (quoting Dunbar v. 
Thompson, 79 Hawai‘ i 306, 315, 901 P.2d 1285, 1294 (App. 1995)) 
(“[Special damages] are ‘often considered to be synonymous with 
pecuniary loss and include such items as medical and hospital 
expenses, loss of earnings, and diminished capacity.’”); In re 
Haw. Fed. Asbestos Cases, 734 F. Supp. 1563, 1567 (D. Haw. 1990) 
(“Special damages compensate claimants for specific out-of-
pocket financial expenses and losses.”). Accordingly, the 
portion of the settlement or judgment that is designated as 
42  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
special damages is likely to correspond with those costs or 
expenses covered by collateral source payment. Thus, by 
limiting collateral source reimbursement to the corresponding 
amount of special damages, the legislature acted to prevent 
double payment without unduly limiting a plaintiff’s ability to recover from the tortfeasor. See H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 4-86, 
in 1986 House Journal, at 43. 
In 2000, the legislature again spoke to an insurer’s 
rights to reimbursement when it enacted Act 29, which amended article 13 of the Insurance Code by creating a new subsection, 
HRS § 431:13-103(a)(10).  2000 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 29, § 1 at 
55. This new legislation made it an unfair practice for an 
insurer to refuse or limit “coverage available to an individual 
because the individual may have a third-party claim for recovery 
of damages.” 
HRS § 431:13-103(a)(10) (Supp. 2000). The intent 
of the measure was “to clarify an insurer’s rights and duties 15
15 HRS § 431:13- 103(a)(10) (Supp. 2000) provided that an insurer 
would have committed an unfair insurance practice by: 
Refusing to provide or limiting coverage available to an 
individual because the individual may have a third- party 
claim for recovery of damages; provided that: 
(A) Where damages are recovered by judgment or settlement 
of a third- party claim, reimbursement of past 
benefits paid shall be allowed pursuant to section 663-10; and 
(B) This paragraph shall not apply to entities licensed 
under chapter 386, 431:10C, 432, or 432D[.] 
2000 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 29, § 1 at 55. 
43  
 
  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and protect consumers’ rights to coverage in cases involving 
third party claims.” S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2743, in 2000 
Senate Journal, at 1127. This was accomplished in part by 
resolving any ambiguity that those rights were indeed covered 
under HRS § 663-10. HRS § 431:13-103(a)(10)(A) (Supp. 2000); see H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1330-00, in 2000 House Journal, at 
1515 (“[T]his measure is intended to prohibit provisions which 
purport to provide no coverage or limit coverage before or after 
settlement or judgment, while providing reimbursement rights 
pursuant to Section 663-10 to avoid a duplicate windfall 
recovery to the claimant.”). 
Act 29 also amended HRS § 663-10 to expressly include 
“health insurance or benefits” within its provisions. 2000 Haw. 
Sess. Laws Act 29, § 2 at 57; Yukumoto, 140 Hawai‘ i at 296, 400 
P.3d at 497. 
At the same time, the legislature in Act 29 
exempted health coverage and benefits from the newly created 
§ 431:13-103(a)(10) (Supp. 2000).16 2000 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 29, 
16 Workers’ compensation and motor vehicle insurance benefits were 
also exempted from HRS § 431:13- 103(a)(10) (Supp. 2000) “because those 
coverages already ha[d] reimbursement rights defined by statute.” H. Stand. 
Comm. Rep. No. 1330- 00, in 2000 House Journal, at 1515.  The testimony of 
Consumer Lawyers of Hawai͑i provides a helpful impression of the state of 
subrogation and reimbursement law prior to Act 29: 
Current law provides procedures for reimbursement of automobile and workers’ compensation insurance benefits 
where the insured may have a third- party claim for recovery 
of damages against a wrongdoer. Other types of insurance 
such as travel, fire, and non
-automobile property damage 
coverage do not have explicit legal standards. This

§ 1 at 55; see H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1330-00, in 2000 House 
Journal, at 1515 (“Health coverage and benefits are exempted 
from Section 431:13-103 and the same rights and obligations are 
placed in Section 663-10[.]”). These specific amendments were 
made by the Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection in response to testimony from HMSA and Consumer Lawyers of 
Hawai͑i. See S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2743, in 2000 Senate 
Journal, at 1127. Responding to specific concerns that HRS § 431:13-103(a)(10) as originally drafted
17 would obligate health 
insurers to pay “future claims” to cover a claimant’s “future medical needs,” the legislature opted to place “all of the 
rights and obligations of health benefit providers and consumers in Section 663-10 for third-party liability situations to create 
a uniform and comprehensive procedure.”

No. 1330-00, in 2000 House Journal, at 1515; see Testimony of 
HMSA, to Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection, 
20th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Feb. 24, 2000). 
Finally, Act 29 further amended HRS § 663-10 to 
clarify an insurer’s subrogation and lien rights where an insured has recovered damages from a third party, including in 
instances where “there is a settlement before suit is filed or 
there is no civil action pending.” 2000 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 29, 
§ 2 at 57. By amending both HRS §§ 431:13-103(a) and 663-10, 
the legislature intended to create “a fair, uniform and 
comprehensive procedure governing the rights and obligations of 
insurance companies and consumers for the reimbursement of insurance benefits from third-party sources of recovery.” H.

court or to the parties in the action. The judgment 
entered, or the order subsequent to settlement, shall include a statement of the amounts, if any, due and owing 
to any person determined by the court to be a holder of a 
valid lien and to be paid to the lienholder out of the 
amount of the corresponding special damages recovered by 
the judgment or settlement. 
In determining the payment due 
the lienholder, the court shall deduct from the payment a 
reasonable sum for the costs and fees incurred by the party 
who brought the civil action in tort. As used in this 
section, lien means a lien arising out of a claim for 
payments made or indemnified from collateral sources, 
including health insurance or benefits,  for costs and 
expenses arising out of the injury which is the subject of 
the civil action in tort. If there is a settlement before
suit is filed or there is no civil action pending, then any 
party may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for a determination of validity and amount of any claim of a 
lien.

Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1330-00, in 2000 House Journal, at 1515. 
As we previously recognized in Yukumoto
, the effect of Act 29 
was to “limit[] reimbursement and subrogation for all insurance companies” to the comprehensive procedure prescribed by HRS 
§§ 431:13-103(a)(10) and 663-10. 140 
Hawai‘i at 296, 400 P.3d at 
497. 
Just one year later, in 2001, the legislature again 
considered amendments to HRS §§ 431:13-103(a)(10) and 663-10. 
A 
new bill, S.B. 940, was introduced to bring health insurers back 
within the scope of HRS § 431:13-103(a)(10). S.B. 940, 21st 
Leg., Reg. Sess. (2001). The intent of this measure was not to 
create any new obligation specific to health benefit providers, 
but rather to clarify that those entities were subject to the 
same rights and obligations as other insurance providers under 
article 13 of the Insurance Code and HRS § 663-10. 
This new legislation was in response to testimony 
that, in the wake of Act 29, health insurers had been interfering with third-party settlements and actively making 
things worse for their insureds. The Senate Committee on 
Commerce, Consumer Protection and Housing noted the following in 
its report: 
The purpose of this measure is to make mutual benefit 
societies (societies) and health maintenance organizations 
(HMOs) subject to the unfair methods of competition and 
unfair and deceptive acts and practices of the business of 
insurance, for refusing to provide or limiting coverage to an individual having a third- party claim for damages. 
47  
 
     . . . . 
 Testimony of the State Insurance Commissioner[ ] 
indicated that this measure corrects an oversight in Act 
29, Session Laws of Hawai͑i (SLH) 2000, which should not 
have exempted societies and HMOs from insurance unfair 
practices for refusing to provide or limiting coverage to 
the insured who has a third- party claim.  Act 29, SLH 2000, 
established lien rights for health insurance benefits paid, which is a complement to revisions in the same measure to the insurance code relating to unfair insurance practices.  19
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
.  .  .  The intent of your C ommittee is that societies 
and HMOs promptly pay the benefits owing under their 
policies, and recoup their payments from a third- party 
claim by lien as provided under section 663- 10, HRS.  
Testimony indicated that under current law, societies and HMOs may be interfering with a third- party settlement by 
claiming that they are exempt from insurance unfair trade practice as a result of Act 29, SLH 2000. This was clearly 
not the intent of the legislature. This measure clears up that confusion.  
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 107, in 2001 Senate Journal. 
The bill was carried over into the 2002 legislative 
session and eventually passed as Act 228. 2002 Haw. Sess. Laws 
Act 228, at 909-15. The Conference Committee report reiterated: 
The purpose of this measure is to clarify the rights 
and obligations of health insurers, mutual benefit 
societies, and health maintenance organizations with regard 
to health coverage rights of persons with third- party 
claims for damages.  
Refusing to provide or limiting health coverage to 
persons who have third- party claims for damages is not 
permitted, except for reimbursement under section 663- 10, 
[HRS].  This measure makes such acts  unfair insurance 
practices under article 13 of the insurance code to 
19 State Insurance Commissioner Wayne Metcalf testified on behalf of 
the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs that “[a]lthough the legal effect of Act 29 is that [health insurers] are subject to the same rights and 
obligations of other insurers, the separation of those duties into two 
separate sections has resulted in some confusion.”

Insurance Commissioner Wayne Metcalf, to Senate Committee on Commerce,

eliminate any doubt that health insurers have always been 
subject to these limitations under section 663- 10, HRS. 
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 67, in 2002 House Journal, at 1783. 
The legislative history makes clear that the intent of 
Act 228 was merely to bring health insurers into the fold of the 
existing statutory framework established by Act 29. The logical 
implication of that action is that all insurance entities not 
specifically exempted by statute were already, and continue to 
be, subject to that same framework as defined by HRS §§ 431:13-103(a)(10) and 663-10. Given that property and casualty 
insurers are not specifically exempted, and that neither of the 
relevant provisions have been subsequently amended, it follows 
that our holding in Yukumoto, that the framework defined by “HRS 
§§ 663-10 and 431-13:103(a)(10) comprehensively addresses and 
limits a health insurers’ [sic] rights to reimbursement and 
subrogation,” also extends to property and casualty insurers. 
See 140 Hawaiʻ i at 298, 400 P.3d at 499. 
As we explained in Yukumoto
, “[w]hen the terms of an 
insurance contract are in conflict with statutory language, the 
statute must take precedence over the terms of the contract.” 
140 Hawaiʻi at 298, 400 P.3d at 499 (quoting 
Sol
, 76 Hawaiʻi at 
307, 875 P.2d at 924) (brackets in original). Similarly, as we 
explained in 
Moranz v. Harbor Mall, LLC, where a statute “is 
plain and unambiguous, . . . it would be inappropriate to use 
49  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
equitable principles in its interpretation.” 150 Hawaiʻ i 387, 
396, 502 P.3d 488, 497 (2022); see Ditto v. McCurdy, 90 Hawai‘ i 
345, 356, 978 P.2d 783, 794 (1999) (quoting Guidry v. Sheet 
Metal Workers Nat. Pension Fund, 493 U.S. 365, 376 (1990)) (“As 
a general matter, courts should be loath to announce equitable 
exceptions to legislative requirements or prohibitions that are 
unqualified by the statutory text.”); see also In re Powerine
Oil Co., 59 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir. 1995) (“Equity may not be 
invoked to defeat clear statutory language[.]”); United States 
v. Oil Res., Inc., 817 F.2d 1429, 1432 (9th Cir. 1987) (“Common 
law rules must yield when they conflict with a statute’s logic and intention.”). 
Because an insurer’s recovery in the context of a tort 
settlement or judgment is limited to a statutory lien, the 
insurer’s contractual and equitable rights must yield to 
statute. Any other attempt to recover a paid claim resulting 
from a third party’s tortious conduct, whether from the third-
party tortfeasor through a subrogation action, whether contractual or equitable, or the insurer’s own insured, through 
a reimbursement action outside of the lien process contemplated 
by HRS § 663-10, would violate HRS § 431:13-103(a)(10) as an 
“unfair method[] of competition and unfair or deceptive act[] or 
practice[.]” Therefore, where, as here, an insured has reached 
a settlement with a third-party tortfeasor, a property and 
50  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
casualty insurer’s exclusive remedy to recover claims paid to an 
insured for damages caused by the third-party is limited to the 
lien-claim process prescribed by HRS § 663-10. 
2. Equitable subrogation survives in the absence of a 
judgment or settlement 
While we conclude that HRS §§ 431:13-103(a)(10)(A) and 
663-10 together limit a property and casualty insurer’s rights 
to subrogation in the context of an insured’s recovery by 
judgment or settlement of a third-party tort claim, there is 
nothing in those statutes that purports to limit the subrogation 
right where no such judgment or settlement has been finalized. 
Put differently, where an injured insured does not pursue a 
civil action against the tortfeasor, an insurer remains free to pursue their own subrogation claim. In this way, the 
distinction we recognized in Yukumoto between personal 
insurance, and property and casualty insurance, remains a 
meaningful one. See
 140 Hawaiʻi at 294, 400 P.3d at 495.  
Further, and importantly, equitable subrogation still functions 
in this context to give restitution to the insurer and prevent 
the unjust enrichment of the defendant-tortfeasor. See id.
 at 
292, 400 P.3d at 493. 
As discussed above, the Yukumoto court adopted the 
majority rule “that an insurer does not have equitable subrogation rights in personal insurance contexts.” Id. at 294, 
51  
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
400 P.3d at 495. This decision, which was consistent with other 
jurisdictions and our own caselaw, was supported by the 
rationale that “it is difficult to ascertain exact measurements 
of loss” in personal insurance cases. Id.; see Rutledge, 87 
Hawaiʻi at 341, 955 P.2d at 1073; Sol, 76 Hawaiʻ i at 307-08, 875 
P.2d at 924-25; Perreira, 778 A.2d at 438. At the same time, we 
acknowledged that “Hawaiʻ i courts have also recognized the 
differences between subrogation rights for property/casualty 
insurance and subrogation rights for personal insurance,” and 
have allowed for subrogation “in the context of fire and 
casualty insurance.” Yukumoto, 140 Hawaiʻ i at 293, 400 P.3d at 
494; see State Farm, 90 Hawaiʻ i at 330, 978 P.2d at 768. Quoting 
Perreira, we stated the following as to the equitable 
subrogation right in the context of property insurance: 
Subrogation rights are common under policies of property or 
casualty insurance, wherein the insured sustains a fixed 
financial loss, and the purpose is to place that loss 
ultimately on the wrongdoer. To permit the insured in such 
instances to recover from both the insurer and the 
wrongdoer would permit him to profit unduly thereby. 
Yukumoto , 140 Hawaiʻi at 292, 400 P.3d at 493 (quoting Perreira, 
778 A.2d at 438). 
We have no reason to, and we do not, extend Yukumoto 
so far as to eliminate property and casualty insurers’ equitable 
subrogation rights entirely. See 73 Am. Jur. 2d Statutes § 174 
(2025) (“[I]t is not presumed that the legislature intended to abrogate or modify a rule of the common law on the subject any 
52  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
further than that which is expressly declared or clearly 
indicated[.]”) (footnote omitted). Where the insured recovers 
by settlement or judgment against the tortfeasor, HRS §§ 431:13-
103(a)(10)(A) and 663-10 apply and equitable subrogation has no 
place. In those cases, the defendant-tortfeasor is made to pay directly to the injured party and the statutory lien-claim 
process preserves the insurer’s right to reimbursement and 
protects against double-recovery by the plaintiff-insured. 
However, where there is no judgment or settlement, the insurer’s 
right to equitable subrogation is not displaced. In that 
context, there is no judgment or settlement against which the 
insurer may assert a lien. Their only means to recover is through a direct subrogation action against the defendant-
tortfeasor. In such cases, the only way to prevent the unjust 
enrichment of the defendant-tortfeasor and to ensure they do not 
escape liability is to allow the insurer to assert its own 
subrogation claim. State Farm
, 90 Hawaiʻi at 331, 978 P.2d at 
769 (quoting 
Peters, 69 Haw. at 29, 731 P.2d at 162). Further, 
because there is no judgment or settlement between the defendant 
and the insured, there is no competition for funds between the 
insured and the insurer and thus no risk of prejudicing the 
insured’s right to fairly recover for their loss. In this 
context, “[s]ubrogation aids indemnity.” Park
, 154 Hawaiʻi at 5, 
543 P.3d at 437 (citing 
State Farm
, 90 Hawaiʻi at 328, 978 P.2d 
53  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
at 766). Thus, where the injured party has not recovered 
damages by judgment or settlement of a third-party claim, see 
HRS § 431:13-103(a)(10)(A), it is appropriate, indeed it is 
favorable, that the insurer be able to exercise its right to 
equitable subrogation and bring a claim directly against the tortfeasor for benefits paid. 
3. The Subrogating Insurers’ countervailing arguments are 
without merit 
The Subrogating Insurers argue that HRS § 663-10 is 
merely a “procedural statute” that simply does not apply to them 
here because they have not asserted “any liens against the 
proposed settlement or any claims categorizable as ‘special 
damages’ under Hawai‘ i law.” They cite to Rudel for the 
proposition that “[b]y its own permissive terms, the statute 
permits, but does not obligate a claimant to ask a court to 
determine the validity of a lien.” 937 F.3d at 1272 (emphasis 
in original). In a narrow sense they are correct. Read alone, HRS § 663-10 does not by itself impose a legal obligation on a 
property and casualty insurer, or any collateral source, to 
assert a lien against a judgment or settlement awarded to its 
insured. An insurer, under any circumstance, may simply choose 
not to pursue reimbursement at all. The Subrogating Insurers’ 
argument, however, ignores both the context in which Reserved 
Question 1 has been presented and the legislature’s clear intent 
54  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that HRS § 663-10 be read together with § 431:13-103. Rudel, 
937 F.3d at 1273. As discussed above, where an injured insured 
recovers from a third-party tortfeasor by judgment or 
settlement, HRS §§ 431:13-103 and 663-10 comprehensively address 
and limit an insurer’s rights to reimbursement and subrogation. 
Id. at 1273-74, Yukumoto, 140 Hawai‘ i at 298, 400 P.3d at 499. 
Faced with this comprehensive statutory procedure, the 
Subrogating Insurers argue that any limitation on their rights 
under HRS § 431:13-103 has not been triggered here. HRS 
§ 431:13-103(a)(10) makes it an unfair insurance practice to 
“[r]efus[e] to provide or limit[] coverage available to an 
individual because the individual may have a third-party claim 
for recovery of damages.” The Subrogating Insurers read this 
language narrowly to mean that “an insurer is prohibited from 
refusing to pay its insured, and instead telling them to pursue 
recovery against a tortfeasor defendant.” The insurers argue that “[b]y definition, a property and casualty insurer that has 
paid out its full policy limits has not refused to provide, or 
limited the scope of, its coverage.” (Emphasis omitted). 
Because there is no argument here that the Subrogating Insurers 
have withheld or otherwise refused to pay out claims to their 
insured, it follows by their logic that their means of 
reimbursement should not be routed exclusively through the HRS § 663-10 lien-claim process. 
55  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
This is incorrect. As an initial matter, we have 
already addressed this argument in Yukumoto. There, HMSA paid 
over $325,000 to its insured for medical expenses arising from 
damages caused by the defendant-tortfeasor. Yukumoto, 140 
Hawai‘i at 287, 400 P.3d at 488.  Nevertheless, we held that, 
“HMSA’s sole rights to reimbursement and subrogation are 
provided for in HRS §§ 663-10 and 431:13-103(a)[(10)(A)].” Id.
at 298, 400 P.3d at 499. The fact that HMSA had not withheld 
payment from its insured did not give HMSA rights to seek 
recovery outside of the statutory lien-claim process and assert 
an independent subrogation action against the tortfeasor. It 
would be inconsistent for us to now hold that a property and 
casualty insurer may skirt the statutory mandate of HRS 
§§ 431:13-103(a)(10)(A) and 663-10 under the same circumstances. 
Further, the Subrogating Insurers’ narrow reading of 
what does or does not constitute a limitation of coverage is inconsistent with the legislative history of HRS §§ 431:13-103 
and 663-10 discussed above. The legislature clearly indicated 
that one of the intended functions of HRS § 431:13-103(a)(10) 
was to prevent insurers from “interfering with a third-party 
settlement.” S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 107, in 2001 Senate 
Journal at 987. This intent is aligned with the long-recognized 
public policy that “favors the finality of negotiated settlements that avoid the costs and uncertainties of protracted 
56  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
litigation.” Gossinger v. Ass’n of Apt. Owners of Regency of
Ala Wai, 73 Haw. 412, 424, 835 P.2d 627, 633 (1992); Exotics
Hawaii-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 116 Hawai‘ i 
277, 288, 172 P.3d 1021, 1032 (2007) (citations omitted) (“We 
acknowledge the well-settled rule that the law favors the 
resolution of controversies through compromise or settlement 
rather than by litigation.”). 
Here, allowing the Subrogating 
Insurers to pursue reimbursement through direct subrogation 
actions against the Defendants, rather than the HRS § 663-10 
lien-claim process, would interfere with the ability of the 
injured Plaintiffs and the Defendants to settle their dispute. 
Both the legislative history and the plain language of 
the statutes themselves specifically contemplate HRS § 663-10 as 
an insurer’s exclusive remedy for reimbursement where the 
insured recovers tort damages by judgment or settlement. Thus, 
the reference to HRS § 663-10 within § 431:13-103(a)(10)(A) is not an “exclusion to the law,” as the insurers argue, but a 
legislative mandate with which the insurers are bound to comply. 
Still, the Subrogating Insurers push back, arguing that 
“[r]ecovery of insurance monies from the tortfeasor can never 
alter the benefits that have already been paid to the insured.” 
In other words, the benefit received by an insured is 
undiminished by the insurer bringing a subrogation action against the same defendant. 
In support of this argument, the 
57  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Subrogating Insurers cite to our recent opinion in Park for its 
holding “that an insurer’s ‘pursuit of its claims does not harm’ 
the insured because an ‘insurer is entitled to only what will 
make it come out even.’” (quoting Park, 154 Hawai‘i at 5, 543 
P.3d at 437). 
The Subrogating Insurers’ reliance on Park is 
misplaced. 
First, Park involved a workers’ compensation claim. 
Id. at 2-3, 543 P.3d at 434-35. Thus, the relevant statute at 
issue was HRS § 386-8,  and the insurer in that case was 20
20 HRS § 386- 8, Hawai‘ i’s workers’ compensation subrogation law, is 
applicable “[w]hen a work injury for which compensation is payable under 
[chapter 386] has been sustained under circumstances creating in some person 
other than the employer or another employee of the employer acting in the 
course of employment a legal liability to pay damages on account thereof[.]” 
HRS § 386- 8(a).  The statute provides a comprehensive set of procedures that 
govern subrogation rights in the workers’ compensation context and 
contemplates specific methods of allocating the amount of the judgment or 
settlement depending on whether the employee, the employer, or both jointly 
prosecute the action against the third
-party tortfeasor.  See HRS § 386- 8 
(e)
-(g).  HRS § 386- 8(e) provides, for example: 
If the action is prosecuted by the employer alone, 
the employer shall be entitled to be paid from the proceeds 
received as a result of any judgment for damages, or 
settlement in case the action is compromised before 
judgment, the reasonable litigation expenses incurred in 
preparation and prosecution of the action, together with a reasonable attorney’s fee, which shall be based solely upon 
the services rendered by the employer’s attorney in 
effecting recovery both for the benefit of the employer and 
the employee. After the payment of the expenses and 
attorney’s fee, the employer shall apply out of the amount of the judgment or settlement proceeds an amount sufficient 
to reimburse the employer for the amount of the employer’s 
expenditure for compensation and shall pay any excess to 
the injured employee or other person entitled thereto. 
We factored this comprehensive distribution procedure into our 
analysis in Park. 154 Hawai‘ i at 5, 543 P.3d at 437 (“No matter how the 
[defendant’s] liability gets litigated, the distribution follows HRS 
(continued . . .) 
58  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
specifically exempt from the application of § 431:13-103(a)(10). 
See HRS 431:13-103(a)(10)(B) (“This paragraph shall not apply to 
entities licensed under chapter 386 or 431:10C[.]). Second, the 
insurer’s pursuit of its subrogation claim could not harm the 
insured plaintiff because the plaintiff’s own claim against the 
tortfeasor had been dismissed. See Park, 154 Hawai‘ i at 3, 543 
P.3d at 435. Because the plaintiff stood to recover nothing on 
her own, there was no risk of her recovery being diminished by 
the insurer’s subrogation action. Notably, this also meant 
there was no recovery by judgment or settlement of a third-party 
claim against which the insurer would have been able to assert a 
lien under HRS § 663-10. This is not the case here, where the 
Plaintiffs have reached the terms of a settlement agreement with 
the Defendants, and where allowing the Subrogating Insurers to 
pursue their own, separate subrogation actions risks diminishing 
or destroying entirely the Plaintiffs’ recovery under the proposed settlement. 
The Subrogating Insurers further argue that HRS 
§ 663-10 “applies only to health insurance policies.” This 
court’s reasoning in Yukumoto
, the Insurers contend, “center[ed] 
on fundamental, conceptual distinctions between Hawai‘i’s 
(. . . continued) 
§ 386-8’s formula.  Park receives any excess. It doesn’t matter if she wins, 
[the workers’ compensation insurer] wins, or they both win together.”).  
59  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
treatment of personal insurance (such as health and medical 
insurance) and its treatment of property and casualty 
insurance.” While it is true that we recognize distinctions 
between personal insurance, and property and casualty insurance, 
those distinctions do not justify an exemption from HRS §§ 431:13-103(a)(10) and 663-10 for property and casualty 
insurers where no such exemption is contemplated by either the 
plain language or the legislative history of those statutes. 
The Subrogating Insurers imply that our specific focus 
in Yukumoto indicates that HRS §§ 431:13-103(a)(10) and 663-10 
somehow apply uniquely to health insurers. That is not the 
case. There, our specific focus on the subrogation rights of health insurers was a response to the issue presented to us on 
appeal. See In re Att’y’s Fees of Mohr, 97 Hawai‘ i 1, 9, 32 P.3d 
647, 655 (2001) (“[T]he use of judicial power to resolve public 
disputes . . . should be limited to those questions capable of judicial resolution and presented in an adversary context.”) 
(ellipses in original). 
Further, our holding there is 
consistent with an affirmative answer to Reserved Question 1 here. We recognized in Yukumoto
 that in 2000 the legislature 
“limited reimbursement and subrogation for all insurance companies, excluding health insurers, in HRS § 431:13-
103(a)(10).” 140 Hawai‘ i at 296, 400 P.3d at 497 (emphasis 
added). 
Then, in 2002, the legislature amended HRS 
60  
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
§§ 431:13-103(a)(10) and 663-10 “to eliminate any doubt that 
health insurers have always been subject to” the same 
limitations as other insurance entities. Id. at 298, 400 P.3d 
at 499 (quoting Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 67, in 2002 House Journal, at 1783). We need not read the statutes or the legislative history any differently to reach the conclusion here that, under 
HRS § 431:13-103(a)(10)(A), a property and casualty insurer’s 
rights to reimbursement and subrogation are limited to the HRS § 
663-10 lien-claim process where their insured has recovered by 
judgment or settlement of a third-party tort claim. 
Moreover, our answer in the present case upholds the 
“conceptual distinctions” between personal insurance, and property and casualty insurance, that we recognized in Yukumoto. 
As discussed above, we do not extend Yukumoto to eliminate a 
property and casualty insurer’s right to equitable subrogation 
entirely. Under our ruling here, the property insurer’s 
equitable right to subrogation survives. And where that right 
is displaced by HRS §§ 431:13-103 and 663-10, the insurer’s 
right to reimbursement is preserved through the lien-claim 
process. Thus, contrary to what the Subrogation Insurers argue, 
an affirmative answer to Reserved Question 1 does not compel the insurers to “release their own claims without compensation.” 
61  
 
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B.  Reserved Question 2 
Question 2: 
Is a property and casualty insurer’ s subrogation right of 
reimbursement prejudiced by its insured’s release of any 
tortfeasor when the settlement documents and release 
preserve those same rights under HRS § 663- 10? 
Our answer in the affirmative to Question 1 is 
dispositive of Question 2. Because we hold in Question 1 that 
HRS § 663-10 is the exclusive remedy for an insurer to recover 
paid claims in the context of a settlement between an insured 
and a third-party tortfeasor under HRS § 431:13-103(a)(10)(A), 
we answer Question 2 in the negative. A property and casualty 
insurer is not prejudiced when its rights are limited by 
settlement to the exclusive remedy for recovery provided for by law. Therefore, a property and casualty insurer’s subrogation 
right of reimbursement is not prejudiced by its insured’s 
release of a tortfeasor when the settlement documents and 
release preserve those same rights under HRS § 663-10. To the 
extent that State Farm could be construed as inconsistent with 
our answers in this opinion, we clarify the application of State 
Farm after the adoption of Act 29 in 2000. 
1. Insurers are not prejudiced when their recovery is 
limited by the terms of a settlement to the insurer’s exclusive form of recovery as provided for by law 
The Subrogating Insurers assert that “State Farm 
directly controls the disposition of this reserved question.” 
State Farm holds in relevant part that 
62  
 
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
if the insurer proves (1) that the tortfeasor had actual or 
constructive knowledge of the insurer’ s subrogation right 
of reimbursement or that the tortfeasor and insured colluded to destroy the insurer’ s subrogation right and  
(2) that the insurer’ s subrogation right of reimbursement 
is actually prejudiced  by the insured’ s release of the 
tortfeasor, then the release, settlement, and/or 
indemnification agreement executed by the insured and the 
tortfeasor will not bar a subrogation action by the insurer against the tortfeasor.  
90 Hawaiʻi at 332, 978 P.3d at 770 (emphasis added). 
Because it is undisputed that the Plaintiffs and the 
Defendants had actual knowledge of Subrogating Insurers’ 
subrogation rights, the arguments here are limited to the actual 
prejudice prong of the 
State Farm test. 
The Subrogating Insurers argue that their interests 
are actually prejudiced because the right of subrogation is legally and conceptually distinct from the right of 
reimbursement that is preserved through the lien-claim process 
under HRS § 663-10. The Subrogating Insurers contend that the 
settlement’s limitation of their recovery to one cause of action 
over another constitutes actual prejudice for two reasons. 
Firstly, the Subrogating Insurers argue: 
[I]t is legally impermissible for the trial court to 
effectively re- draft the [Subrogating Insurers’] complaint 
so that they are asserting liens against their own insureds. Such an action would operate as an involuntary 
substitution of one cause of action for another; running afoul of the principle that a party may determine its own causes of action and legal theories while depriving the 
[Subrogating Insurers] of their rights without due process. 
Further, the Subrogating Insurers argue that the 
Settlement Term Sheet does not preserve their subrogation 
63  
 
    
 
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
rights, instead preserving only the “lesser legal right” of 
reimbursement, which they argue is “more vulnerable to equitable 
defenses than subrogation claims.” In their view, the 
channeling of subrogation rights into reimbursement rights is 
intended to manufacture direct competition between the Subrogating Insurers and the Plaintiffs for the Defendants’ 
limited funds. 
The Plaintiffs counter that there is no actual 
prejudice because “as long as the right of reimbursement under 
HRS § 663-10 is available to the insurer after the policyholder 
settles the claim, then the insurer’s ‘right of reimbursement’ 
is not ‘actually prejudiced.’”
21 
“Actual prejudice” within the meaning of State Farm is 
not clearly defined. The Subrogating Insurers contend that a property and casualty insurer is actually prejudiced whenever 
the insurer loses the right that it previously had to subrogate 
their insured’s claim against the tortfeasor. This 
interpretation is incorrect. While it is true that the 
possibility of recovery is a necessary prerequisite to establish 
actual prejudice, it is a mere threshold question. Instead, 
once the possibility of recovery is established, State Farm then 
21 The Plaintiffs misstate the standard of actual prejudice to an 
insurer’s subrogation right of reimbursement by eliding “subrogation” from 
the standard. Nevertheless, even when properly stated the analysis below 
applies and the outcome is the same. 
64  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
requires courts to evaluate whether the tortfeasor acted 
inequitably in obtaining a release of claims by the injured 
insured. 90 Hawaiʻ i at 333, 978 P.2d at 771 (“Where the 
insurer’s subrogation right clashes with the tortfeasor’s 
contractual release right, the insurer’s subrogation right will 
prevail if the tortfeasor acted inequitably.”) (emphasis added). 
Further, accepting the Subrogating Insurers’ 
definition of actual prejudice would lead to absurd results. While the right to equitable subrogation is preserved in the 
absence of a settlement or judgment, that right is limited to 
reimbursement via lien once a settlement or judgment in a tort 
action is entered. HRS § 663-10; HRS § 431:13-103(a)(10)(A). 
If the extinguishment of an insurer’s subrogation right 
constituted actual prejudice under State Farm, HRS §§ 663-10 and 
431:13-103 would by their mere operation result in actual 
prejudice. The only way for an insured to preserve an insurer’s subrogation right would be to not pursue its own action against 
the tortfeasor because doing so would result in judgment or 
settlement, either of which would foreclose the insurer’s 
ability to assert their subrogation rights. This would be 
contrary to the compensatory purpose of tort law. See, e.g., 
Kailieha v. Hayes, 56 Haw. 306, 320, 536 P.2d 568, 576 (1975) (Richardson, C.J., dissenting) (“It is . . . well established that one of the major purposes of tort law . . . is to 
65  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
compensate injured parties for the wrongs of others[.]”). Such 
a position is also counter to the public policy in favor of 
promoting the resolution of controversies by settlement, as 
expressed in State Farm. 90 Hawaiʻ i at 323, 978 P.2d at 761 (“We 
acknowledge the well-settled rule that the law favors the 
resolution of controversies through compromise or settlement 
rather than by litigation.”). 
It would also be counter to the 
express intent of the legislature in enacting HRS § 431:13-103 
in 2000, and in amending HRS §§ 663-10 and 431:13-103 in 2002. 
E.g., S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 107, in 2001 Senate Journal, at 
987 (“Testimony indicated that under current law, societies and 
HMOs may be interfering with a third-party settlement by 
claiming that they are exempt from insurance unfair trade 
practice as a result of Act 29, SLH 2000. 
This was clearly not 
the intent of the legislature. This measure clears up that confusion.”). We therefore decline to adopt the Subrogating Insurers’ formulation for determining actual prejudice under 
State Farm. 
In summary, HRS § 431:13-103(a)(10)(A) makes the 
lien-claim process pursuant to HRS § 663-10(a) the exclusive 
means of recovery for a property and casualty insurer in the 
context of a settlement between an insured and a third-party 
tortfeasor. Because HRS §§ 663-10 and 431:13-103(a)(10)(A) together operate to preclude subrogation in this context, the 
66  
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Subrogating Insurers’ argument must fail at the threshold: a 
release of claims by a settlement does not prejudice an insurer 
because the insurer has no right to subrogation to be 
extinguished by the terms of the settlement. Where an insured 
and a tortfeasor have settled, the insurer only ever had, and would continue to have, the right to seek reimbursement via the 
statutory lien process envisioned by HRS § 663-10(a). A right 
that does not exist cannot be prejudiced. 
2. An insurer’s right to reimbursement is prejudiced when 
a settlement is structured to nullify the insurer’s 
valid lien interests under HRS § 663-10 
In answering Question 2 in the negative, we do hold 
that a property and casualty insurer’s right to reimbursement 
via lien under HRS § 663-10 cannot be prejudiced by the terms of 
a settlement. As discussed above, HRS § 663-10, which was 
adopted as part of “a complex, coherent bill, which embodies the 
demands and concessions of many different segments of our community,” balances an insurer’s right to reimbursement with an 
insured’s right to be fairly compensated for their injury. H. 
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 4-86, in 1986 House Journal, at 40. This 
express purpose for adopting HRS § 663-10 is reflected in House 
Committee on Judiciary and Health report: 
The intent of this provision is to prevent double payments 
from collateral source[s] for costs or expenses arising out 
of the injury for which the plaintiff has brought the tort action and is awarded a judgment therefor. The collateral 
source lienholders have been limited only to that portion 
of the settlement or judgment which is designated as 
67  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
special damages so as not to deprive the plaintiff of any 
award for noneconomic damages which is not covered by 
collateral source payment for costs and expenses already 
made. 
Id. at 43 (emphasis added). 
Because the Legislature acted to preserve 
reimbursement from the limited portion of a judgment or 
settlement allocated as special damages, we presume that the 
legislature did not intend to permit settling parties to nullify 
the statute by structuring their settlements in such a manner as 
to reduce the insurer’s reimbursement to nothing. To permit 
otherwise could incentivize settlements being structured to 
effectively defeat the attachment of a lien. We therefore read 
into HRS § 663-10 an implicit good-faith requirement for 
settlements between insured and tortfeasors. 
Thus, the settling parties may not, in bad faith, 
structure their settlement in such a way as to nullify the protections afforded to insurers under HRS § 663-10. For 
example, a settlement between a tortfeasor and an injured 
insured that purports to waive a property and casualty insurer’s 
right to assert an otherwise valid lien under HRS § 663-10 would 
be prejudicial to the insurer’s rights and violative of State Farm. Similarly, a settlement improperly structured as for 
general damages only, when the circumstances do not warrant such 
a settlement, would prejudice an insurer’s rights under HRS 
68  
 
  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
§ 663-10. Such settlements cannot be countenanced as in good 
faith. 
This does not mean that there are no circumstances 
under which parties could, in good faith, settle their claims 
under a general-damages only settlement.  Instead, the trial 
court must determine whether, under the totality of the 
circumstances as they are known at the time of the settlement, 
the settlement was entered into in good faith. In this regard, 
there are some similarities between the inquiry required under 
HRS § 663-10 and the inquiry under HRS § 663-15.5, which was 
enacted in 2002 and imposes a good faith requirement in 
settlements that release a joint tortfeasor’s liability. 
In 
determining whether a settlement is in good faith for purposes 
of HRS § 663-15.5, we adopted a totality of the circumstances 
framework in Troyer v. Adams. 102 Hawaiʻi 399, 77 P.3d 83 
(2003). Relevant factors under the Troyer test include: 22
(1) the type of case and difficulty of proof at trial, 
e.g., rearend motor vehicle collision, medical malpractice, product liability, etc.; (2) the realistic approximation of 
total damages that the plaintiff seeks; (3) the strength of 
the plaintiff’ s claim and the realistic likelihood of his 
or her success at trial; (4) the predicted expense of litigation; (5) the relative degree of fault of the settling tortfeasors; (6) the amount of consideration paid 
to settle the claims; (7) the insurance policy limits and 
solvency of the joint tortfeasors; (8) the relationship 
among the parties and whether it is conducive to collusion 
or wrongful conduct; and (9) any other evidence that the settlement is aimed at injuring the interests of a non-
22 The same considerations would also apply to a settlement that 
limited special damages to a nominal value. 
69  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
settling tortfeasor or motivated by other wrongful purpose. 
The foregoing list is not exclusive, and the court may 
consider any other factor that is relevant to whether a 
settlement has been given in good faith. 
Id. at 427, 77 P.3d at 111. 
Here, we do not adopt the Troyer test for evaluating 
whether a settlement is in good faith for the purposes of HRS 
§ 663-10. Instead, Troyer is instructive for the type of 
inquiry a trial court may conduct in making the relevant good 
faith determination. 
Where a settlement’s allocation of damages 
disproportionately favors general damages at the expense of 
special damages to the prejudice of an insurer in an amount 
significantly below the amount of a valid lien as determined by 
the trial court, a trial court may presume the settlement is in bad faith. This presumption may be overcome by a showing that 
the allocation of damages was reasonable under the totality of 
the circumstances as known to the settling parties at the time 
of the settlement. On appeal, the trial court’s determination 
will be reviewed for abuse of discretion. 
3. State Farm is clarified to the extent that it could be 
construed as inconsistent with this opinion 
When State Farm was decided in 1999, the legislature 
had already enacted HRS § 663-10 to govern an insurer’s recovery 
from an insured’s tort settlement. However, HRS § 431:13-
103(a)(10)(A), which makes liens under HRS § 663-10 the 
70  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
exclusive remedy for recovery where the insured has settled with 
the tortfeasor, had not yet been enacted. Thus, at the time 
State Farm was decided, a lien under HRS § 663-10 was not the 
exclusive remedy but merely one remedy among others for an 
insurer to recover its paid claims. In that context, the existence of a settlement would not, by itself, require an 
insurer to pursue a lien under HRS § 663-10. Permitting an 
insurer to assert an equitable subrogation right that was 
purportedly waived by a settlement did not violate any statutory 
prescriptions. Instead, State Farm acknowledged the equitable 
basis for all subrogation rights and so, balancing the equities, 
reinstating an insurer’s equitable subrogation rights where the tortfeasor and the insured inequitably colluded was permissible. 
However, with the enactment of HRS § 431:13-103 via 
Act 29 in 2000, HRS § 663-10 became the exclusive remedy for an 
insurer to seek recovery when the insured and the tortfeasor 
settled. Because subrogation rights do not arise in the context 
of a settlement by operation of HRS § 431:13-103(a)(10)(A), an 
insurer is limited to the exclusive statutory remedy of a lien 
against the settlement. Therefore, we clarify the applicability 
of State Farm post Act 29 to the extent that it could be construed as inconsistent with our answers to Questions 1 and 2 
in this opinion. 
71  
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
C.  Reserved Question 3 
Question 3: 
Under the circumstances of the Maui Fire Cases and the 
terms of the “Global Settlement,” does the law of the State 
of Hawaiʻi require that insureds be made whole for all 
claimed injuries or damages before their insurers can 
pursue a subrogation right of recovery or reimbursement 
against a thirty- party tortfeasor? 
We answer Question 3 in the negative. This court has 
never adopted the made whole doctrine in the context of property 
and casualty insurance and we decline to apply it here under the 
circumstances of this mass tort case. Question 3 is directed at “the circumstances of the Maui Fire Cases and the terms of the 
‘Global Settlement.’” See Flores-Case ʻ Ohana, 153 Hawaiʻi at 81, 
526 P.3d at 606 (quoting Cabrinha, 42 Haw. at 100) (“On a 
reserved question we are required to answer a question of law based on facts reported to this court by the circuit judge. We 
may not express an opinion on a question of law by assuming 
certain facts as to which the circuit judge has made no 
finding.”). We decline to reformulate Reserved Question 3 to 
reach the application of made whole doctrine beyond the 
circumstances of this case. See id. at 78, 526 P.3d at 603 
(citing Pac. Radiation Oncology, LLC v. Queen’s Med. Ctr., 138 
Hawai͑i 14, 16, 375 P.3d 1252, 1254 (2016)) (explaining that 
this court may reformulate reserved questions “as it perceives 
them to be, in light of the contentions of the parties”). 
Therefore, we do not address the application of made whole 
72  
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
doctrine in the context of property and casualty insurance more 
broadly. 
1.  We decline to apply the made whole doctrine under the 
circumstances of this mass tort case 
The made whole doctrine, also known as the 
antisubrogation doctrine, is an equitable doctrine that prevents 
an insurer from asserting its right to equitable subrogation 
unless and until the injured insured has been made whole. This 
court described the made whole doctrine in footnote 8 of State 
Farm, when discussing the requirements for equitable 
subrogation: 
First, the insurer must have paid the loss. The right 
extends to the extent of the amount actually paid and the 
amount paid must have been paid to the insured. 
In addition, the amount paid by the insurer must 
result in the insured’ s being made “whole.”  The general 
rule is that the subrogated insurer is entitled to no 
subrogation, or to reduced subrogation, if the result of 
full subrogation would be to cause the insured to be less 
than fully compensated for the loss, although some cases 
hold to the contrary. . . . 
Courts have taken three approaches to the issue of 
whether or not subrogation will be allowed when the insured has not been fully compensated. One approach is to find 
that the insurer is entitled to the full amount of its 
subrogation, whether or not its insured is made whole. Another is to find that the insurer is entitled to no 
subrogation until the insured recovers his entire loss, 
between the insurance payment and the recovery from the 
tortfeasor. The third approach is to hold that the court 
should make an equitable distribution of any recovery from the tortfeasor, in light of all of the circumstances. 
State Farm, 90 Hawaiʻi at 328 n.8, 978 P.2d at 766 n.8 
(modifications in original). 
73  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The Plaintiffs argue that, in State Farm, this court 
adopted “the made-whole rule as a requirement that must be met 
before legal/equitable subrogation arises.” The Plaintiffs 
further argue that “the insurer has the burden of establishing 
the policyholder has been made whole to show entitlement to subrogation” under State Farm. The Plaintiffs contend that such 
a showing by the Subrogating Insurers will be impossible because 
“the total losses of all the plaintiffs exceed $12 billion” and 
the settlement is for only a little over $4 billion. 
The Subrogating Insurers urge us not to adopt the made 
whole doctrine. Relying on State Farm
, the Subrogating Insurers 
assert that “[b]ecause equitable property subrogation has not 
previously been limited by this Court, Hawaiʻi currently follows 
the first approach [outlined in 
State Farm footnote 8], holding 
that the insurer is entitled to full equitable subrogation 
against the tortfeasor irrespective of the insured’s other damages.” Stated differently, the made whole doctrine does not 
apply to equitable property and casualty subrogation. Instead, 
following the Subrogating Insurers’ interpretation of our 
caselaw, “[w]hen faced with a conflict between limiting the 
liability of tortfeasors and allowing the subrogation rights of 
insurers, this Court has consistently determined that equitable 
doctrines favor the insurer.” However, if we were to adopt the made whole doctrine “for the first time,” the Subrogating 
74  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Insurers urge us not to apply it at this time because the record 
before the trial court is not sufficiently developed to evaluate 
the equities in this case. 
While this court has discussed the made whole doctrine 
in the context of property and casualty insurance, e.g., State
Farm, 90 Hawaiʻ i at 328 n.8, 978 P.2d at 766 n.8 (discussing the 
equitable bases for subrogation); see also id. at 328 n.9, 978 
P.2d at 766 n.9 (contrasting equitable subrogation with 
contractual subrogation), the made whole doctrine has never been 
adopted in any Hawai‘ i case involving property and casualty 
insurance. 
Indeed, this court has never adopted the made whole 
doctrine in any context. 
We agree with authority cited by the Subrogating 
Insurers that the equitable analysis required under the made 
whole doctrine necessitates a fact intensive and individualized 
determination. See, e.g., 
Vandenbrink v. State Farm Mut. Auto.
Ins. Co., No. 8:12-cv-897-T-30TBM, 2012 WL 3156596, at *3 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 3, 2012) (“If this case were to proceed, the most important issues to settle will be individual in nature. The 
issues will include the damages incurred by an individual 
plaintiff, the amount of the settlement, and the portion of the 
settlement that actually was for medical payments.”). We 
disagree, however, that such a determination is inherently 
incompatible within the context of mass tort cases generally. 
75  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The authority cited by the Subrogating Insurers relied on class 
certification requirements pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP). Id.In particular, the 
predominance test for federal class action certification under FRCP Rule 23(b)(3) was dispositive. Vandenbrink, 2012 WL 
3156596, at *3. Because this court is not bound to follow the 
federal court’s interpretation of the FRCP when construing the 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), we are not bound to the 
same outcome under our analogous class certification rule, HRCP Rule 23(b)(3). See Chen v. Mah, 146 Hawaiʻ i 157, 176, 457 P.3d 
796, 815 (2020) (citing Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Products, 86 Hawaiʻ i 214, 256, 948 P.2d 1055, 1097 (1997)) 
(“[N]otwithstanding their persuasiveness, interpretations of the 
FRCP by federal courts are by no means conclusive with respect 
to our interpretation of any rule within the HRCP”). 
However, we need not resolve that issue here. A 
reserved question, with an undeveloped record, is not an 
appropriate vehicle to determine how, if at all, the made whole 
doctrine applies. We therefore decline to apply the made whole 
doctrine under the circumstances of this mass tort case. 
V. CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, we answer Question 1 in the 
affirmative, and we answer Questions 2 and 3 in the negative. These answers provide the framework for the circuit court to
