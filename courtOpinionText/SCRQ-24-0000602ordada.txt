SCRQ-24-0000602 
 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI I 
IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR THE COORDINATION 
OF MAUI FIRE CASES. 
RESERVED QUESTIONS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT 
(CASE NO. 2CSP-23-0000057) 
 
ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., McKenna, Eddins, and Ginoza, JJ., 
and Circuit Judge Morikone, in place of Devens, J., recused) 
The Circuit Court of the Second Circuit reserved three 
questions to this court. Upon consideration of the appellate 
briefing, the record, and oral argument, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the reserved questions are 
answered as follows: 
Question 1: Does the holding of Yukumoto v. Tawarahara
, 140 
Hawaiʻi 285, 400 P.3d 486 (2017), that limited the 
subrogation remedies available to health insurers 
to reimbursement from their insureds under HRS § 
663-10 and barred independent actions against tortfeasors who settled with the insureds extend 
to property and casualty insurance carriers?  
 Question 1 is answered in the affirmative. Our 
opinion in Yukumoto v. Tawarahara, 140 Hawaiʻ i 285, 400 P.3d 486 
(2017), extends to property and casualty insurers such that, 
under Hawai
ʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 431:13-103(a)(10)(A), the 
lien provided for under HRS § 663-10(a) is the exclusive remedy 
for a property and casualty insurer to recover claims paid for 
damages caused by a third-party tortfeasor in the context of a 
tort settlement between an insured and the tortfeasor. 
Question 2: Is a property and casualty insurer’s subrogation 
right of reimbursement prejudiced by its 
insured’s release of any tortfeasor when the settlement documents and release preserve those 
same rights under HRS § 663-10? 
Because the statutory lien under HRS § 663-10 is the 
exclusive remedy for a property and casualty insurer in the 
context of a tort settlement, Question 2 is answered in the 
negative. 
Question 3
: 
Under the circumstances of the Maui Fire Cases 
and the terms of the “Global Settlement,” does 
the law of the State of Hawai‘i require that 
insureds be made whole for all claimed injuries 
or damages before their insurers can pursue a 
subrogation right of recovery or reimbursement 
against a third-party tortfeasor? 
Question 3 is answered in the negative. 
Under the 
circumstances of this mass tort case, we decline to apply the 
made whole doctrine to the statutory lien-claim process established by HRS §§ 431:13-103(a)(10) and 663-10. 
2  
 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this case is remanded to the 
circuit court for such other and further proceedings as may be 
appropriate consistent with this order. 
We retain concurrent jurisdiction to enter an opinion 
and judgment that will follow. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai i, February 10, 2025.
