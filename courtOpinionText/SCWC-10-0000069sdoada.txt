SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.;
with Acoba, J., Concurring and Dissenting Separately)
 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Tommy W. Bullard 
(Bullard) seeks review of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ 
(ICA) August 26, 2011 judgment on appeal, which affirmed the district court of the first circuit’s (district court) September 7, 2010 judgment of conviction and sentence.

 At the time of the alleged offense, HRS § 291E-61 provided in
 
pertinent part:
 
(a)	 A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under
the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:

sufficient to impair the person's normal mental
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard
against casualty[.]
 
. . .
 
(b)	 A person committing the offense of operating a vehicle under
the influence of an intoxicant shall be sentenced as follows
 without possibility of probation or suspension of sentence:
 
(1)	 Except as provided in paragraph (2), for the first
offense, or any offense not preceded within a
five-year period by a conviction for an offense under
this section or section 291E-4(a):
 
(A)	 A fourteen-hour minimum substance abuse
 
rehabilitation program, including education and
counseling, or other comparable program deemed

accepted Bullard’s application for writ of certiorari
 
(Application) and now vacate the judgment of the ICA and remand
 to the district court with instructions to dismiss without
 prejudice.
 
Bullard’s first six questions presented summarily 
contend that the ICA erred in concluding that the State was not required to allege mens rea in his OVUII charge under HRS § 291E­61(a)(1). In State v. Nesmith, ___ Hawai' i ___, ___ P.3d ___ 
(2012), we held that an OVUII charge under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) must allege mens rea in order to fully define the offense in unmistakable terms readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding in order to inform the accused of the nature and cause of the accusation. 
Here, following Nesmith, the ICA erred by concluding
 
that mens rea need not be alleged in a HRS § 291E-61(a)(1)
 charge. Without such allegation, Bullard’s HRS § 291E-61(a)(1)
 charge fails to fully define the OVUII offense in unmistakable
 terms readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding

and is, therefore, fatally deficient.3 Accordingly, Bullard’s
 
OVUII conviction under the deficient (a)(1) charge cannot stand. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: (1) the ICA’s judgment
 
affirming the district court’s judgment of conviction and
 
sentence is vacated; and (2) the case is remanded to the district
 court with instructions to dismiss without prejudice.

 Because we vacate the ICA’s judgment based on Bullard’s first six
 
questions presented, we do not reach his remaining points of error.
