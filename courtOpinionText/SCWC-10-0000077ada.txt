2 officers through the grievance procedures of the collective 
bargaining agreement governing the parties.  When the parties 
were unable to resolve the grievances, the matter was submitted 
to arbitration for final determination.  After finding that the 
promotions were subjective, arbitrary, and capricious in 
violation of the collective bargaining agreement, the arbitrator 
awarded the three officers promotions and back pay.  The Circuit 
Court of the Fifth Circuit (circuit court) found that it was beyond the scope of the arbitrator’s authority to award 
promotions and vacated the arbitrator’s remedy.
1  The principal 
issue before this court is whether it was proper for the circuit court to vacate the arbitrator’s remedy.  
I. BACKGROUND 
 In May 2007, the Employer notified SHOPO that it would 
fill five police sergeant positions from the existing promotional eligible list, which was based on the results of 
written examinations.  The acting chief of police decided to add 
an oral interview to the promotional process.  An examination 
panel was assembled, and the interviews were conducted in August 
2007.  Five candidates were selected to the police sergeant 
positions, and following the appointments, three of the 
                         
 1 SHOPO appealed the decision of the circuit court to the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), and the ICA vacated the circuit court’s 
decision.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
3 unsuccessful candidates filed grievances alleging violations of 
the collective bargaining agreement.   
 The grievances were brought under the collective 
bargaining agreement that pertains to the employment of state and county police officers (agreement).
2  The agreement is 
between SHOPO--the exclusive representative for public employees 
in the police officers unit--and the State of Hawaiʻ i, City and 
County of Honolulu, County of Hawaiʻ i, County of Maui, and County 
of Kauaʻ i.  The agreement includes a four-step grievance 
procedure that provides for the final settlement of unresolved 
grievances through “final and binding” arbitration.3   
 The four-step grievance procedure is set out in 
Article 32, which provides for arbitration as the final step and 
restricts review of the decision on appeal: “The award of the 
Arbitrator shall be accepted as final and binding.  There shall 
be no appeal from the Arbitrator’s decision by either party, if 
such decision is within the scope of the Arbitrator’s authority 
as described below . . . .”  Article 32 includes a limitation on the arbitrator’s authority: “The Arbitrator shall not have the 
                         
 2 The parties agreed that Articles 1, 14, 32, 35, and 47 were 
substantially the same between the contract that was in effect July 2003 
through June 2007 and the contract in effect from July 2007 through June 
2011.  All quotations from the agreement in this o pinion are from the 
agreement effective July 2007.   
 3 Article 32 provides for the grievance procedure to govern the 
parties under the agreement; it includes provisions regarding the selection 
of an arbitrator, the arbitrator’s jurisdiction, a pre- hearing, discovery, 
and the arbitration award. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
4 power to add to, subtract from, disregard, alter, or modify any 
of the terms of this Agreement.”  Article 32 also sets forth the 
arbitrator’s authority:  
The Arbitrator’s authority shall be to decide whether the 
Employer has violated, misinterpreted or misapplied any of the terms of this Agreement and in the case of any action 
which the Arbitrator finds unfair, unjust, improper or 
excessive on the part of the Employer, such action may be 
set aside, reduced or otherwise changed by the Arbitrator.  
The Arbitrator may, in the Arbitrator’s discretion, award back pay to recompense in whole or in part, the employee 
for any salary or financial benefits lost, and return to 
the employee such other rights, benefits, and privileges or 
portions thereof as may have been lost or suffered. 
 Article 47 of the agreement specifically addresses 
promotions: “Promotions shall be based upon fair standards of 
merit and ability, consistent with applicable civil service 
statutes, rules and regulations and procedures.”  The “Rights of 
the Employer” are provided for in Article 11; it includes a 
single section titled “Management Rights” that provides, “The 
Employer reserves and retains, solely and exclusively, all 
management rights and authority, including the rights set forth in Section 89-9(d)(1)-(8), Hawaii Revised Statutes, except as 
specifically abridged or modified by this Agreement.”
4     
                         
 4 HRS § 89- 9(d) (Supp. 2007) prohibits agreement to a provision 
that “would interfere with the rights and obligations of a public employer 
to” do certain listed functions including the right to “[h]ire, promote, 
transfer, assign, and retain employees in positions.”  Notwithstanding HRS § 
89-9(d)’s prohibition of agreements that interfere with certain management 
rights, it also provides the following:  
This subsection shall not be used to invalidate provisions of collective bargaining agreements in effect on and after 
June 30, 2007, and shall not preclude negotiations over the 
procedures and criteria on promotions . . . .

5  The grievances of the three police officers asserted 
violations of the collective bargaining agreement.  The 
grievants contended that the promotional process used by the 
Employer was subjective, arbitrary, and capricious.  Each 
grievance statement stated the following under the heading 
“remedy sought”: “That the employer promote the Grievant to 
Police Sergeant on the effective date of promotion and be made 
whole.”    The parties were not able to settle the grievances 
through the first three steps of the grievance procedures before the Employer, and in May 2008, SHOPO sent the Employer a Notice 
of Intent to Arbitrate on behalf of each grievant.  Larry L. 
Cundiff, Sr. was selected as the sole arbitrator for 
determination of the three grievances (arbitrator).  A 
consolidated arbitration hearing on the grievances was held 
before the arbitrator for three days in January 2009. 
 At the beginning of the hearing, the arbitrator 
stated, “Both parties have agreed that this matter is properly 
before the arbitrator.”  After a brief discussion with both 
attorneys off the record, the arbitrator stated that the parties 
previously agreed that SHOPO had the right to challenge “the way 
                                                                               
(continued . . .) 
Violations of the procedures and criteria so negotiated may 
be subject to the grievance procedure in the collective 
bargaining agreement.  
HRS § 89- 9(d). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
6 that the promotions were done; however, they do not challenge 
the [Employer’s] right to make the promotions.”  During the 
hearing, a total of seventy-five exhibits were admitted into 
evidence, and eight witnesses testified.  Testimony indicated 
that there were three to five vacant sergeant positions at that 
time. 
 In the arbitrator’s June 2, 2009 decision, the 
arbitrator found that the matter was properly before the 
arbitrator and that the arbitrator had jurisdiction over the 
grievances.5  The arbitrator’s decision provided an overview of 
the testimony presented regarding the three officers’ work history and qualifications.  The arbitrator found that the 
grievants were denied promotions “due to subjective, arbitrary 
and capricious promotional practices.”  The arbitrator awarded 
the grievants promotions to sergeant positions, back pay, and 
“any additional rights, benefits and privileges they would have 
been entitled to had they been promoted.”  SHOPO filed a motion to confirm the arbitrator’s award 
in the circuit court on June 23, 2009, arguing that the award was valid, binding, and issued within the arbitrator’s 
authority.
6  The Employer opposed SHOPO’s motion and moved for 
                         
 5 The arbitrator determined he had authority based on the section 
titled “Arbitrators Authority” in Article 32.

court proceedings in this case.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
7 the circuit court to vacate the award on the basis that the 
arbitrator “exceeded his authority” under the agreement.  The 
Employer also maintained that the arbitrator’s actions “were 
beyond the jurisdiction of negotiation and arbitration, as well 
as a violation of public policy.”  SHOPO opposed the Employer’s 
motion to vacate and contended that the arbitrator had the 
jurisdiction and authority to decide the matter and noted that 
the Employer conceded in pre-arbitration proceedings that SHOPO had the right to grieve the subject promotions. 
 The circuit court heard argument on the motions in a 
July 29, 2009 hearing.  The court stated during the hearing that the grievances were properly before the arbitrator and that the 
Employer had taken “inconsistent positions” regarding whether 
the promotions were a proper subject of arbitration.  The 
circuit court stated, “I believe the employer is estopped from 
arguing otherwise, because they agreed to final and binding 
arbitration.”  The circuit court continued, “They agreed that this was a proper subject.” 
 However, the circuit court also found that it was 
beyond the scope of the arbitrator’s authority under the agreement and HRS § 658A-23 to award promotions and back pay.  
The circuit court found that the agreement in this case was 
distinguishable from the collective bargaining agreement in 
University of Hawaiʻ i Professional Assembly v. University of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
8 Hawaiʻi, 66 Haw. 214, 659 P.2d 720 (1983) (per curium) 
[hereinafter UHPA II],7 which the circuit court found granted the 
arbitrator greater authority. 
 On August 6, 2009, the circuit court granted in part 
and denied in part the Employer’s motion to vacate.  The court 
confirmed the arbitrator’s findings of facts and conclusions 
with the exception of the arbitrator’s remedy, which the court 
vacated.  The court reasoned that the grievances were properly 
before the arbitrator and within his jurisdiction, but the court 
also found that the arbitrator’s remedy exceeded his authority 
and powers granted under Article 32 of the agreement in 
violation of HRS § 658A-23.  In accordance with its rulings, the court denied SHOPO’s motion to confirm the arbitrator’s award 
and remanded the case for a rehearing on the issue of remedy.  
SHOPO filed a notice of appeal, which was dismissed by the ICA 
for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
 On July 8, 2010, the arbitrator issued a decision 
regarding the circuit court’s order denying the Employer’s request to vacate the arbitrator’s remedy.  The arbitrator’s 
                         
 7 In a series of four cases decided on the same day in 1983, this 
court clarified judicial review of arbitration decisions in the context of 
public sector collective bargaining agreements providing for final and 
binding arbitration.  See Univ. of Haw. Prof’l Assembly v. Univ. of Haw., 66 
Haw. 207, 659 P.2d 717 (1983) (per curium) [hereinafter UHPA I]; UHPA II, 66 
Haw. 214, 659 P.2d 720; Univ. of Haw. v. Univ. of Haw. Prof’l Assembly, 66 
Haw. 228, 659 P.2d 729 (1983) (per curium) [hereinafter UHPA III]; Univ. of 
Haw. v. Univ. of Haw. Prof’l Assembly, 66 Haw. 232, 659 P.2d 732 (1983) (per 
curium) [hereinafter UHPA IV].  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
9 decision stated that the parties agreed to a rehearing on the 
remedy issue before the arbitrator by submitting their arguments 
and positions via memoranda.  The arbitrator concluded that the 
remedy from his previous decision would “remain unchanged” based 
on the arbitrator’s “reading and interpretation of the plain 
language and meaning of the ‘Arbitrator’s Authority’ as set 
forth in Article 32” of the agreement. 
 The arbitrator also made several findings with regard 
to his authority under Article 32 including that “the words 
‘otherwise change’ are clear and unambiguous” and grant the 
arbitrator the authority to grant promotions as part of the 
remedy to resolve grievances.  The arbitrator found that the 
remedy was consistent with past practices of parties under the 
agreement.  The arbitrator also found that the Employer “never 
contended during the arbitration hearings that the language in 
Article 32 was not sufficiently worded to permit the Arbitrator 
to grant a promotion to remedy the grievances.”  Additionally, the arbitrator noted that he had “previously found” that the 
grievants were “well qualified based on merit and ability for 
promotion,” as shown by evidence presented during the 
arbitration hearings.  
 SHOPO filed a motion to confirm the arbitrator’s July 
8, 2010 award arguing that the arbitrator’s remedy “should be confirmed as a ‘final and binding’ decision that was issued ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
10 within the arbitrator’s authority.”  The Employer opposed 
SHOPO’s motion and filed a motion to vacate.  On September 20, 
2010, the circuit court issued orders resolving the parties’ 
motions.  The court granted in part and denied in part SHOPO’s 
motion to confirm the award; as it had done previously, the 
court confirmed the arbitrator’s “findings and decisions in all 
respects” but vacated based on the arbitrator’s remedy.  SHOPO 
timely filed a notice of appeal. 
 In a published opinion, the ICA first considered 
SHOPO’s contention that the Employer was estopped from asserting that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in awarding 
promotions because the Employer failed to raise this argument 
during arbitration.  The ICA rejected SHOPO’s estoppel argument, 
distinguishing the UHPA II case from this case based primarily 
on the wording of the respective agreements.  The ICA also found that the Employer contested the arbitrator’s authority to 
promote the grievants during the arbitration hearings. 
 With regard to the remedy awarded by the arbitrator, 
the ICA concluded that pursuant to the agreement and HRS § 89-9(d), the arbitrator did not exceed his authority in awarding 
promotions and the circuit court erred in finding otherwise.  In 
its analysis, the ICA considered the public policies set forth 
in HRS §§ 76-1 and 89-9 but did not expressly resolve whether 
the agreement was contrary to public policy.  Accordingly, the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
11 ICA affirmed in part and vacated in part the circuit court’s 
August 6, 2009 and September 20, 2010 orders and remanded the 
case to the circuit court for confirmation of the arbitrator’s 
decision in its entirety. 
 The Honorable Lisa M. Ginoza concurred and dissented 
in the decision, arguing that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in granting the remedy (ICA dissent).  The Employer 
requests this court to adopt the analysis of the ICA dissent, which interpreted the agreement as reserving the right to 
promote solely to the Employer and to the exclusion of the 
arbitrator. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
 “[J]udicial review of an arbitration award is confined 
to ‘the strictest possible limits,’” and a court may only vacate an award on the grounds specified in HRS § 658A-23 and modify or 
correct on the grounds specified in HRS § 658A-24.  See Daiichi 
Haw. Real Estate Corp. v. Lichter, 103 Hawaiʻ i 325, 336, 82 P.3d 
411, 422 (2003).  This standard applies to both the circuit 
court and the appellate courts.  See id. (noting that HRS §§ 
658–9 and –10 “also restrict the authority of [appellate courts] to review judgments entered by circuit courts confirming [or 
vacating] the arbitration awards” (quoting  Mars Constructors, 
Inc. v. Tropical Enters., Ltd., 51 Haw. 332, 336, 460 P.2d 317, 
319 (1969)). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
12  The circuit court’s “findings of fact will not be set 
aside unless they are clearly erroneous.”  Beneficial Haw., Inc. 
v. Casey, 98 Hawaiʻ i 159, 167, 45 P.3d 359, 367 (2002).   
A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when, despite 
evidence to support the finding, the appellate court is left with the definite and firm conviction in reviewing the 
entire evidence that a mistake has been committed.  A 
finding of fact is also clearly erroneous when the record 
lacks substantial evidence to support the finding.  We have defined ‘substantial evidence’ as credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a 
person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.  
Daiichi, 103 Hawaiʻ i at 337, 82 P.3d at 423 (citations 
omitted) (quoting Beneficial Haw., Inc. v. Kida, 96 Hawaiʻ i 
289, 305, 30 P.3d 895, 911 (2001)) (internal quotation 
marks omitted).  We review the circuit court’s conclusions 
of law under the right/wrong standard.  Id. 
III. DISCUSSION  
 The Employer raises one issue in its Application for 
Writ of Certiorari, whether “the ICA gravely erred in holding that the Arbitrator did not exceed his powers under the applicable collective bargaining agreement . . . by ordering 
that the Grievants be promoted to the position of Sergeant and 
awarding the attendant back pay and benefits.”  The Employer 
argues that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority under the 
agreement in promoting the grievants and maintains that the 
agreement expressly reserves the right to promote to the 
Employer.  The Employer also submits that the arbitrator’s ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
13 awarding of back pay and promotions are in violation of public 
policy. 
  In response, SHOPO maintains that the ICA majority 
reached the correct decision and that the circuit court 
“contravened well established case law” in “second guessing” the 
arbitrator’s interpretation of the collective bargaining 
agreement, ignoring the unambiguous language of the agreement, 
and disregarding the parties’ long standing practice “that permitted the Arbitrator to resolve the grievances as he did.” 
A. The Arbitrator’s Decision and Award Could Have Rested on an 
Interpretation of the Agreement.  
 In this case, the parties agreed to “final and 
binding” arbitration for the settlement of grievances.  “It is well settled that the legislature overwhelmingly favors 
arbitration as a means of dispute resolution.”  Tatibouet, 99 
Hawaiʻi at 234, 54 P.3d at 405 (quoting Leeward Bus Co. v. 
Honolulu, 58 Haw. 64, 71, 564 P.2d 445, 449 (1977)).  
Accordingly, the legislature narrowly constrained judicial review of arbitration awards in the HRS, Chapter 658A.  Under 
HRS § 658A-22 (Supp. 2001),
8 a party to an arbitration proceeding 
                         
 8 HRS § 658A- 22 provides the following: 
After a party to an arbitration proceeding receives notice 
of an award, the party may make a motion to the court for an order confirming the award at which time the court shall 
issue a confirming order unless the award is modified or 
corrected pursuant to section 658A- 20 or 658A- 24 or is 
vacated pursuant to section 658A- 23.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
14 may make a motion to a court for confirmation of an award.  HRS 
§ 658A-22 requires the court to confirm the order unless the 
award is modified or corrected under certain limited 
circumstances9 or is vacated pursuant to HRS § 658A-23 (Supp. 
2001).10  The circumstances under which a circuit court may 
vacate an arbitration award are set forth in HRS § 658A-23, 
                         
 9 The award may be modified or corrected by the arbitrator pursuant 
to HRS § 658A- 20 or by the court pursuant to HRS § 658A- 24.   
 10 HRS § 658A- 23(a) provides the following:  
Upon motion to the court by a party to an arbitration 
proceeding, the court shall vacate an award made in the 
arbitration proceeding if: 
(1) The award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other 
undue means; 
(2) There was: 
(A) Evident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a 
neutral arbitrator; 
(B) Corruption by an arbitrator; or 
(C) Misconduct by an arbitrator prejudicing the rights of 
a party to the arbitration proceeding; 
(3) An arbitrator refused to postpone the hearing upon 
showing of sufficient cause for postponement, refused to 
consider evidence material to the controversy, or otherwise 
conducted the hearing contrary to section 658A- 15, so as to 
prejudice substantially the rights of a party to the 
arbitration proceeding; 
(4) An arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator’s powers; 
(5) There was no agreement to arbitrate, unless the person 
participated in the arbitration proceeding without raising 
the objection under section 658A- 15(c) not later than the 
beginning of the arbitration hearing; or 
(6) The arbitration was conducted without proper notice of 
the initiation of an arbitration as required in section 
658A-9 so as to prejudice substantially the rights of a 
party to the arbitration proceeding. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
15 which includes vacation of an arbitration award if an 
“arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator’s powers.”  Cf. Tatibouet, 
99 Hawaiʻ i at 234, 54 P.3d at 405 (discussing the limitations on 
judicial review of arbitration awards under HRS § 658-9 (1993) 
(repealed 2001)). 
 In determining whether an arbitrator has exceeded his 
or her authority under the agreement, “there should be no 
‘second guessing’ by the court” of the arbitrator’s 
interpretation of his or her authority so long as the 
arbitrator’s interpretation “could have rested on an 
interpretation and application of the agreement.”11  Local Union 
1260 Int’l Bhd. of Elec. Workers v. Hawaiian Tel. Co., 49 Haw. 
53, 56, 411 P.2d 134, 136 (1966); UHPA I, 66 Haw. at 210, 659 
P.2d at 719 (explaining that the issue of arbitrability should 
be decided by the arbitrator, rather than the court, because 
“the parties agreed to submit to the arbitrator” disputes of 
arbitrability); see also Haw. State Teachers Ass’n v. Univ. Lab. 
Sch., 132 Hawaiʻ i 426, 432, 322 P.3d 966, 972 (2014) (upholding 
the principle that questions of arbitrability are reserved for 
                         
 11 Federal courts apply a similar standard: an arbitrator’s award 
“is legitimate only so long as it draws its essence from the collective 
bargaining agreement.”  United Steelworkers of Am. v. Enter. Wheel & Car 
Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 597 (1960); see also  W.R. Grace & Co. v. Local Union 
759, Int’l Union of United Rubber Workers, 461 U.S. 757, 765 (1983) (“Because 
the authority of arbitrators is a subject of collective bargaining, just as 
is any other contractual provision, the scope of the arbitrator’s authority 
is itself a question of contract interpretation that the parties have 
delegated to the arbitrator.”).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
16 the arbitrator); UHPA III, 66 Haw. at 230, 659 P.2d at 731 (“It 
is the arbitrator’s construction of the contract which was 
bargained for.” (alterations omitted) (quoting United 
Steelworkers of Am. v. Enter. Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 
597 (1960)). 
 Consistent with our case law discussing the proper 
review of arbitration awards, the agreement in this case 
provided, “The award of the Arbitrator shall be accepted as final and binding.  There shall be no appeal from the 
Arbitrator’s decision by either party, if such decision is 
within the scope of the Arbitrator’s authority . . . .”  
Accordingly, the outcome of this case depends on whether the 
arbitrator’s interpretation of the scope of his authority “could 
have rested on an interpretation and application of the 
agreement.”  Hawaiian Tel. Co., 49 Haw. at 56, 411 P.2d at 136. 
 In this case, Article 32 of the agreement expressly 
grants the arbitrator the authority to “decide whether the Employer has violated, misinterpreted or misapplied any of the 
terms of this Agreement.”
12  Article 32 further provides that 
                         
 12 Article 32 provides:   
The Arbitrator’s authority shall be to decide whether the 
Employer has violated, misinterpreted or misapplied any of 
the terms of this Agreement and in the case of any action 
which the Arbitrator finds unfair, unjust, improper or excessive on the part of the Employer, such action may be 
set aside, reduced or otherwise changed by the Arbitrator.  
The Arbitrator may, in the Arbitrator’s discretion, award 
back pay to recompense in whole or in part, the employee 
(continued . . .) ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
17 “any action which the Arbitrator finds unfair, unjust, improper 
or excessive on the part of the employer, such action may be set 
aside, reduced or otherwise changed by the Arbitrator.”  
(Emphasis added).  Further, Article 32 gives the arbitrator the authority to “award back pay” and “return to the employee such 
other rights, benefits, and privileges or portions thereof as 
may have been lost or suffered.” 
 Article 32 supports an interpretation that the 
arbitrator had the authority to award promotions and back pay in this case.  Article 32 grants the arbitrator the authority to 
determine violations of the agreement and to remedy such 
violations.  By granting promotions to the grievants, the 
arbitrator returned to the grievants “such other rights, 
benefits, and privileges” that were “lost or suffered” as a 
result of the nonpromotions, thus, “chang[ing]” the action of 
the Employer it found to violate the agreement.  Because the 
arbitrator’s authority to grant promotions and back pay “could have rested on an interpretation and application of the 
agreement,” the circuit court should not have “second guessed” 
the arbitrator’s award in this case.  See Hawaiian Tel. Co., 49 
Haw. at 56, 411 P.2d at 136.  “Indeed, by giving the arbitrator

the employee such other rights, benefits, and privileges or 
portions thereof as may have been lost or suffered.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
18 the power to actually grant tenure or promotion, the collective 
bargaining agreement is made that much more meaningful, since 
‘the confidence of the workers in the equity of the agreement is 
strengthened when they know that any dispute over the meaning of 
the contract may be submitted to an impartial third party for 
decision.’”  UHPA II, 66 Haw. at 223, 659 P.2d at 727 (quoting 
James M. Ringer, Note, Legality and Propriety of Agreements to 
Arbitrate Major and Minor Disputes in Public Employment, 54 
Cornell L. Rev. 129, 135 (1968)). 
 The Employer urges this court to adopt the analysis of 
the ICA dissent, which found that the award of promotions 
exceeded the arbitrator’s authority under Article 11 of the 
agreement.  Article 11 reserves exclusively to the Employer “all 
management rights and authority, including the rights set forth 
in Section 89-9(d)(1)-(8), Hawaii Revised Statutes, except as 
specifically abridged or modified by this agreement.”  The ICA 
dissent seems to suggest that because Article 11 reserved the Employer’s right to make promotions--“except as specifically 
abridged or modified”--the agreement must expressly state that the arbitrator has the authority to grant promotions.  However, 
this interpretation of the agreement does not give appropriate 
judicial deference to the arbitrator’s interpretation of the 
agreement and is contrary to the terms of the agreement itself. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
19  Additionally, the ICA dissent references a court’s 
authority to review whether the arbitrator exceeded its 
authority under the agreement and under HRS § 658A-23(a)(4) in 
responding to SHOPO’s argument that the circuit court erred by 
substituting its interpretation of the agreement for that of the 
arbitrator.  The ICA dissent states that the agreement in this 
case is “even beyond the authority provided by HRS § 658A-
23(a)(4)” because the agreement in this case “expressly contemplates that a party may seek judicial review when there is 
a question whether the Arbitrator exceeded his authority.”
13  
While it is true that HRS § 658A-23(a)(4) and the agreement authorize judicial review for a determination of whether or not 
the arbitrator exceeded its authority under the agreement, it 
does not follow that the court may substitute its own 
interpretation of the agreement for that of the arbitrator when 
making such a determination.   
 Further, we disagree with the ICA dissent’s 
interpretation of the arbitrator’s authority under the agreement.  The ICA dissent looked at Article 32 and Article 42 
separately for express grants of such authority, while not 
                         
 13 The agreement’s provision that the arbitrator’s decision be 
“final and binding” and that there shall be “no appeal” of an arbitrator’s 
decision within the scope of the arbitrator’s authority is consistent with 
HRS § 658A- 23 and Hawaiʻ i case law limiting judicial review of arbitration 
decisions.  Accordingly, the provision for judicial review under the 
agreement appears to be coextensive with HRS § 658A-23(a)(4).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
20 considering the importance of reading the two provisions 
together.  See Leeward Bus Co., 58 Haw. at 68, 564 P.2d at 448 
(“[A]n agreement should be construed as a whole and its meaning determined from the entire context and not from any particular 
word, phrase or clause.” (quoting Ching v. Hawaiian Restaurants, 
Ltd., 50 Haw. 563, 565, 445 P.2d 370, 372 (1968))).  When read 
together, Article 47 and Article 32 make promotions subject to 
the grievance procedures of the agreement and, thus, grant the arbitrator the authority to “otherwise change” any action with 
relation to a promotion that the Arbitrator finds “unfair, 
unjust, improper or excessive.”  Article 32 also specifically 
gives the arbitrator the authority to “award back pay” and 
“return to the employee such other rights, benefits, and 
privileges or portions thereof as may have been lost or 
suffered.” 
 The arbitrator determined that the grievants were 
denied promotions “due to subjective, arbitrary and capricious promotional practices.”  Under Article 32, the arbitrator was 
authorized to “return to” the grievants the right, benefit, or 
privilege of their promotions that they lost due to the improper 
interview procedure.  It would be illogical for the arbitrator 
to have authority over the promotion grievances yet have no 
authority to “otherwise change” the grieved action and “return ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
21 to” the grievants the privileges and benefits lost as a result 
of the nonpromotions.   
 An interpretation of the agreement that recognizes the 
arbitrator’s authority to remedy the promotion grievances is further bolstered by the fact that the arbitrator’s authority 
over the grievances was agreed to by the parties, affirmed by 
the circuit court, and not raised on appeal.  Further, the 
arbitrator found that the remedy granted in this case was consistent with past practices of the parties under the 
agreement, and the record indicates that there were three to 
five positions that were open at the time of the arbitration 
hearing.
14 
 For the reasons discussed above, the ICA majority 
correctly concluded that “the arbitrator’s award did not exceed 
his authority and the circuit court erred in failing to so 
conclude.” 
B. The Arbitrator’s Decision and Award Does  
Not Violate Public Policy. 
 In its Application, the Employer asks this court to 
“set aside the ICA’s holding pertaining to whether the 
Arbitration Decision violated public policy.” 
                         
 14 This case therefore does not raise, and we do not address, a 
situation where an arbitrator’s remedy would require an employer to establish 
a new position for a grievant.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
22  Hawaiʻi case law recognizes “that there is a limited 
public policy exception to the general deference given 
arbitration awards.”  Inlandboatmen’s Union of the Pac. v. Sause 
Bros., Inc., 77 Hawaiʻ i 187, 194, 881 P.2d 1255, 1262 (App. 
1994); see also Gepaya v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 94 
Hawaiʻi 362, 366, 14 P.3d 1043, 1047 (2000).  This public policy 
exception is based on the exception recognized by the United 
States Supreme Court in United Paperworkers International Union 
v. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29 (1987); see Sause Bros., 77 Hawaiʻ i 
at 194, 881 P.2d at 1262 (adopting the public policy exception 
of Misco and directing that the exception should be applied 
under the guidelines set forth in Misco).    
 The Court in Misco established a framework for courts 
reviewing public policy claims.  First, the court must determine 
whether there is an “explicit, well defined, and dominant” 
public policy that is “ascertained ‘by reference to the laws and 
legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed 
public interests.’”  See E. Associated Coal Corp. v. United Mine 
Workers of Am., Dist. 17, 531 U.S. 57, 62 (2000) (quoting W.R. 
Grace & Co. v. Rubber Workers, 461 U.S. 757, 766 (1983)) (citing 
Misco, 484 U.S. at 43)); accord Sause Bros., 77 Hawaiʻ i 187, 193, 
881 P.2d 1255, 1261 (App. 1994).  Second, the court must 
determine whether the arbitration award itself is clearly shown 
to be “contrary” to the “explicit, well-defined, and dominant ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
23 public policy.”  See E. Associated Coal Corp., 531 U.S. at 62-
63; Sause Bros., 77 Hawaiʻ i 187, 194, 881 P.2d 1255, 1262 (App. 
1994) (stating that the court must determine that “the violation 
of the public policy is clearly shown” in order for the public 
policy exception to apply (alterations omitted) (quoting W.R. 
Grace & Co., 461 U.S. at 766)).    
 We consider whether the arbitrator’s award violates 
public policies with regard to the merit principles as set forth in HRS § 76-1 and the authorized scope of negotiations of 
collective bargaining agreements as expressed in HRS § 89-9(d). 
 First, “[t]he merit principle is the selection of 
persons based on their fitness and ability for public employment 
and the retention of employees based on their demonstrated 
appropriate conduct and productive performance.”  HRS § 76-1 
(Supp. 2000).  There is nothing in the record to suggest that 
the arbitrator’s authority to grant promotions and back pay in 
this case violates the merit principle.  To the contrary, the 
agreement is in accordance with the merit principle as it 
requires promotions to be based on “fair standards of merit and ability, consistent with applicable civil service statutes, 
rules and regulations and procedures.”  The arbitrator heard 
testimony with regard to the grievants’ professional background 
and work performance, and the arbitrator found that “the 
grievant officers were well qualified based on merit and ability ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
24 for promotion to the rank of sergeant based on the evidence 
presented during the arbitration hearings.”  Thus, the 
arbitrator’s award in this case was not contrary to the merit 
principle.  Accordingly, there is no basis to support a finding 
that the arbitrator’s authority to grant promotions and back pay 
was contrary to the public policy of promotions in accordance 
with the merit principle.    
 Second, HRS § 89-9, which pertains to the scope of 
negotiations for public sector collective bargaining, provides 
that an employer and union may not agree in collective 
bargaining to any provision “which would interfere with the 
rights and obligations of a public employer to” perform several 
listed functions including to “[h]ire, promote, transfer assign, 
and retain employees in positions.”  While HRS § 89-9(d) 
expresses a policy that a collective bargaining agreement should 
not interfere with an employer’s prerogative to make promotions, 
the provision expressly provides that this subsection “shall not preclude negotiations over the procedures and criteria on 
promotions . . . as a permissive subject of bargaining during 
collective bargaining negotiations.”  Further, HRS § 89-9(d) 
states, “Violations of the procedures and criteria so negotiated 
may be subject to the grievance procedure in the collective 
bargaining agreement.”   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
25  Thus, HRS § 89-9(d) expresses a policy to avoid 
interference through collective bargaining with an employer’s 
function to make promotions, but the statute specifically states 
that this policy is to be balanced against a policy to encourage 
negotiations over the procedures and criteria on promotions that 
may be subject to grievance procedures.  Accordingly, HRS § 89-9 
does not include an “explicit, well defined, and dominant” 
public policy discouraging the arbitrator’s award of promotions and back pay in this case.   
 The public policy to encourage negotiation over the 
procedures and criteria for promotions that is clearly expressed on the face of HRS § 89-9(d) is further bolstered by the history 
behind the 2007 amendment to the provision.
15  The legislature’s 
2007 amendments to HRS § 89-9(d) were made in light of United 
Public Workers v. Hanneman, 106 Hawaiʻ i 359, 105 P.3d 236 (2005), 
                         
 15 The 2007 amendments added the following language:  
This subsection shall not be used to invalidate provisions 
of collective bargaining agreements in effect on and after 
June 30, 2007, and shall not preclude negotiations over the 
procedures and criteria on promotions, transfers, 
assignments, demotions, layoffs, suspensions, terminations, discharges, or other disciplinary actions as a permissive 
subject of bargaining during collective bargaining 
negotiations or negotiations over a memorandum of 
agreement, memorandum of understanding, or other 
supplemental agreement. 
Violations of the procedures and criteria so negotiated may 
be subject to the grievance procedure in the collective 
bargaining agreement. 
2007 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 58, § 1 at 101 (emphasis added).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
26 wherein the court held that management rights under HRS § 89-
9(d) precluded collective bargaining over the City and County of 
Honolulu’s unilateral decision to transfer refuse workers to a 
different employment location.  Under Hanneman, the scope of 
topics subject to negotiation cannot “infringe upon an employer’s management rights under [HRS § 89-9(d)].”  Hanneman, 
106 Hawaiʻ i at 365, 105 P.3d at 242.  The purpose of the 2007 
amendments was to clarify that management rights enumerated in 
HRS § 89-9(d) do not invalidate or preclude negotiations 
concerning agreements on procedures and criteria on promotions and other management functions.  See S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 
889, in 2007 Senate Journal, at 1438.  The House Committee on 
Labor & Public Employment stated that “negotiations over 
procedures and criteria of promotions . . . are consistent with 
the underlying purpose of chapter 89, HRS.”  H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1465, in 2007 House Journal, at 1595.  
 Further, as the parties agreed before the arbitrator, 
SHOPO challenged the way in which the promotions were done and 
did not challenge the Employer’s right to make promotions.  Thus, the arbitrator’s decision and award did not infringe on 
the Employer’s authority to make promotions in accordance with 
the bargained for criteria and procedures and relevant law.  See 
UHPA II, 66 Haw. at 220-21, 659 P.2d at 725 (holding that HRS 
89-9(d), which granted the employer the “exclusive jurisdiction ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
27 over matters such as setting the criteria for determining 
tenure, promotion, and other areas of faculty employment,” did 
not prohibit the arbitrator “from actually granting tenure or 
promotion upon a finding of arbitrary or capricious conduct”).  
Thus, the arbitrator’s award has not been clearly shown to be 
“contrary” to an “explicit, well-defined, and dominant public 
policy.”  
 We thus conclude that the arbitration award in this 
case did not violate public policy.       
C. Clarification of the Doctrine of Quasi-Estoppel.  
 The ICA majority held that the Employer was not 
estopped from contesting the arbitrator’s authority.  The ICA 
majority’s ruling was based primarily on a distinction that it 
drew between this case and the UHPA II case, which is discussed 
below.   
 Under the doctrine of quasi-estoppel, a party is 
estopped from taking “a position inconsistent with a previous 
position if the result is to harm another.”  UHPA II, 66 Haw. at 
221, 659 P.2d at 725; see also, e.g., Godoy v. Haw. Cnty., 44 
Haw. 312, 320, 354 P.2d 78, 82 (1960) (“But there is a species 
of equitable estoppel, sometimes called quasi-estoppel, which has its basis in election, waiver, acquiescence, or even 
acceptance of benefits and which precludes a party from 
asserting to another’s disadvantage, a right inconsistent with a ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
28 position previously taken by him.  No concealment or 
misrepresentation of existing facts on the one side, no 
ignorance on the other, are necessary ingredients.” (quoting 
Hartmann v. Bertelmann, 39 Haw. 619, 627-28 (Haw. Terr. 1952)). 
 In UHPA II, this court found that the doctrine of 
quasi-estoppel provided a basis for affirmation of an 
arbitrator’s award of tenure and back pay to a grievant.  66 
Haw. at 216-17, 659 P.2d at 723.  The UHPA II court found it 
significant that the parties contractually agreed that the 
arbitrator’s decision would be “final and binding” and that the 
Employer agreed to arbitrate the tenure and promotions dispute.  
Id. at 221, 659 Haw. P.2d at 726.  The court explained that the 
Employer “could have either excluded subjects such as tenure and promotion from the agreement’s arbitration provision altogether, 
or it could have made clear, at the outset of the arbitration 
proceedings, that it was not submitting to the arbitrator the 
power to actually grant tenure or promotion.”  Id. at 221-22, 
659 Haw. P.2d at 726.  UHPA II found that the grievant would 
have been “substantially disadvantaged in terms of time and money spent in the arbitration process and in litigation” if the 
employer were permitted to argue that the arbitrator never had ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
29 the power to resolve the grievances only after the arbitration 
award was not decided in its favor.16  Id.   
 The agreement in this case, like the agreement in UHPA 
II, provides for “final and binding” arbitration.  Also like the 
agreement in UHPA II, the agreement here does not exclude 
promotions from the arbitrator’s powers.  Further, Article 47 of 
the agreement expressly provides requirements for promotions, 
and Article 32 gives the arbitrator the authority to “award back pay” and “return to the employee such other rights, benefits, 
and privileges or portions thereof as may have been lost or 
suffered.”  Thus, the scope of the arbitrator’s authority in 
this case is not significantly different from that of the 
arbitrator in UHPA II.   
 The ICA majority distinguished this case from UHPA II 
on the basis that the agreement in UHPA II “expressly gave the 
                         
 16 The court in UHPA II stated,  
After having contractually agreed that arbitration would be 
the last step in the grievance process and that the 
arbitrator’s decisions would be “ final and binding,” and 
after agreeing to arbitrate these tenure and promotion disputes only to see the arbitration award go against it in 
each and every instance, the University now complains that the arbitrator never had the power to resolve these 
grievances in the first place. We find this complaint 
untenable.  The University could have either excluded 
subjects such as tenure and promotion from the agreement’s 
arbitration provisions altogether, or it could have made clear, at the outset of the arbitration proceedings, that 
it was not submitting to the arbitrator the power to 
actually grant tenure or promotion. 
66 Haw. at 221, 659 P.2d at 726. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
30 arbitrator the right and power to ‘substitute his judgment for 
that of the official’ if the arbitrator found the official’s 
decision to be arbitrary and capricious,” while in this case the 
Employer retains the management rights under the agreement 
“except as specifically abridged or modified.”  However, this is 
not a meaningful distinction because the UHPA II court’s focus 
was on the parties’ agreement to “final and binding” arbitration 
and the Employer’s consent to arbitrate tenure and promotions.  See UHPA II, 66 Haw. at 221-22, 659 P.2d at 726.  Further, the 
ICA majority’s comparison of the arbitrator’s authority in UHPA 
II with the Employer’s authority in this case does not support 
the ICA majority’s distinction, particularly since the employer 
in UHPA II and the employer in this case retained similar 
authority over promotions.
17   
 We note that the arbitrator in this case made an 
express finding that the Employer “never contended during the 
arbitration hearings that the language in Article 32 was not sufficiently worded to permit the Arbitrator to grant a 
promotion to remedy the grievances.”  Nonetheless, the ICA 
majority made a contrary finding that the “Employer did contest 
the arbitrator’s authority to actually promote the grievants.”  
                         
 17 The employer in UHPA II had “exclusive jurisdiction over matters 
such as setting the criteria for determining tenure, promotion, and other 
areas of faculty employment.”  UHPA II, 66 Haw. 214, 220, 659 P.2d 720, 725 
(1983).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
31 Because we find that the arbitrator acted within the scope of 
his authority under the agreement, we need not decide whether 
the doctrine of quasi-estoppel applies in this case and, 
therefore, do not address this conflict between the findings of 
the ICA majority and the arbitrator. 
IV. CONCLUSION  
  Accordingly, the ICA’s December 5, 2014 Judgment on 
Appeal is affirmed, but for the reasons set forth herein.
