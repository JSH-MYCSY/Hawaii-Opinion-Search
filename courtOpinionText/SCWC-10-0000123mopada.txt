MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna and Pollack, JJ.
with Acoba, J., concurring and dissenting separately)
 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Kawa Salas (Salas) 
appeals from the July 3, 2013 Judgment on Appeal of the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) affirming the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit’s (circuit court) judgment of conviction and sentence for robbery in the second degree. 
Pursuant to our prior 
decisions in State v. Cordeiro, 99 Hawai' i 390, 56 P.3d 692 
(2002), and State v. Getz, No. SCWC-12-0000009, __ Hawai' i __, 
313 P.3d 708 (2013), we hold that the circuit court plainly erred *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
when it failed to give the jury a specific unanimity instruction. 
Because that error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we
 vacate the circuit court and ICA judgments and remand the case
 for a new trial. 
I.
 
During a jury trial for first degree robbery, the State
 
adduced evidence that Salas and two other men allegedly accosted
 a group of four complaining witnesses (CWs) at a scenic campsite. 
The State alleged that Salas stood in front of the CWs’ tents and
 shadowboxed in a threatening manner while his co-defendant
 demanded money and drugs. The State also alleged that Salas
 verbally threatened the CWs. In sum, the State’s theory of the
 case was that Salas had accosted all four of the CWs. 
At the close of trial, the jury was given the following
 
unanimity instruction:
 
The law allows the introduction of evidence . . . for the
 
purpose of showing that there is more than one act upon
which proof of an element of an offense may be based. 
In order for the prosecution to prove an element, all 12
jurors must unanimously agree that the same act has been
proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 
. . . . 
Your verdict must be unanimous. 
This instruction advised the jury that it was required to
 
unanimously agree upon the specific act that the defendant
 committed that constituted the offense charged, or an element
 
2
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
thereof. However, the circuit court did not instruct the jury
 
that it was required to unanimously agree upon the identity of
 the target of Salas’s conduct, and neither side requested such an
 instruction. After deliberation, the jury found Salas guilty of
 robbery in the second degree pursuant to HRS § 708-841.

Salas appealed to the ICA and his conviction was
 
affirmed. However, his attorney failed to raise the lack of a
 specific unanimity instruction before the ICA, and again failed
 to raise the issue in Salas’s application for writ of certiorari. 
Nonetheless, a defendant’s right to a unanimous jury verdict is
 constitutionally guaranteed, and thus, the failure to give a
 specific unanimity instruction when one is warranted may be
 reviewed for plain error. 
II.
 
“Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights 
may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.” Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 52(b)(2008). 
1 HRS § 708-841 provided then as it does now: 
(1) A person commits the offense of robbery in the second
degree if, in the course of committing theft or
non-consensual taking of a motor vehicle:
 
. . . . 
(b) The person threatens the imminent use of force
against the person of anyone who is present with intent
to compel acquiescence to the taking of or escaping with
the property[.]

“This court will apply the plain error standard of review to
 
correct errors that seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or
 public reputation of judicial proceedings, to serve the ends of
 justice, and to prevent the denial of fundamental rights.” State
 
v. Taylor, SCWC-30161, 2013 WL 3967699, at *9 (Haw. Aug. 19, 2013) (internal citations omitted). Plain error may be corrected on appeal unless the record affirmatively reveals that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Miller, 122 
Hawai'i 92, 100, 223 P.3d 157, 165 (2010). 
III. 
A defendant’s right to a unanimous jury verdict in a 
criminal prosecution is guaranteed by article 1, sections 5 and 14 of the Hawai' i constitution. See State v. Arceo, 84 Hawai' i 1, 
30, 928 P.2d 843, 872 (1996). For a verdict to be unanimous, “[t]he jury must unanimously find that each material element of the offense has been proven -- the conduct, the attendant circumstances, and the result of the conduct -- as well as the mental state requisite to each element.” State v. Jones, 96 
Hawai'i 161, 169, 29 P.3d 351, 359 (2001). In some 
circumstances, a specific unanimity instruction is required “to eliminate any ambiguity that might infect the jury’s deliberations respecting the particular conduct in which the defendant is accused of engaging and that allegedly constitutes 
4
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the charged offense.” State v. Valentine, 93 Hawai' i 199, 208, 
998 P.2d 479, 488 (2000). Specifically, a unanimity instruction 
must be given if “(1) at trial, the prosecution adduces proof of two or more separate and distinct culpable acts; and (2) the prosecution seeks to submit to the jury that only one offense was committed.” Id. Thus, when a defendant is charged with a single 
offense of robbery and the prosecution adduces evidence that the defendant used or threatened to use force against more than one individual, the circuit court is required to instruct the jury that it must agree unanimously as to the person against whom the defendant used or threatened to use force. See Cordeiro, 99 
Hawai'i at 407-08, 56 P.3d at 709-10. 
For example, in Cordeiro, the prosecution introduced 
evidence that the defendant shot one man, and then pulled his gun on a second man while ordering him to dispose of the first man’s body. 99 Hawai' i at 400, 56 P.3d at 702. At trial, the 
prosecution argued to the jury that either of the defendant’s acts could support a first degree robbery conviction. Id. at 
407, 56 P.3d at 709. After closing arguments, the circuit court instructed the jury that its verdict must be unanimous, but did not instruct the jury that it must unanimously agree on the identity of the person against whom the defendant used force. Id. On these facts, we held that the circuit court plainly erred 
5
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
in failing to give the jury a specific unanimity instruction. 
Id. at 408, 56 P.3d at 710. Because we could not say that the
 error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we vacated
 Cordeiro’s robbery conviction. Id.
 
Likewise, in Getz, the prosecution adduced evidence 
that the defendant used force against two security guards in an attempt to steal a handbag. __ Hawai' i at __, 313 P.3d at 710­
11. The State argued to the jury that it could find the
 
defendant guilty of robbery if they unanimously agreed that the
 defendant had used force against either the first security guard
 or the second one. Id. at __, 313 P.3d at 712. However, the
 
jury was not instructed that it must unanimously agree upon the
 identity of the person against whom the defendant used force. 
Id. We held that the failure to give a specific unanimity
 
instruction prejudiced the defendant’s substantial constitutional
 right to a unanimous jury verdict, and that the error was not
 harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at __, 313 P.3d at 716. 
Accordingly, we applied the plain error doctrine, vacated the
 defendant’s conviction, and remanded for a new trial. Id.
 
Here, the State charged Salas with one count of
 
robbery. At trial, the State adduced evidence that Salas
 threatened to use force against a group of four individuals who
 were sharing a campsite. Based on these facts, the circuit court
 
6
   
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
was required to instruct the jury that it must unanimously agree
 
upon the identity of the person against whom Salas threatened to
 use force. The circuit court’s failure to do so prejudiced
 Salas’s substantial constitutional right to a unanimous jury
 verdict, and thus, constitutes plain error. Because there is a
 reasonable possibility that this error might have contributed to
 Salas’s conviction, we cannot say that it was harmless beyond a
 reasonable doubt. 
IV.
 
For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the ICA’s
 
judgment on appeal and the circuit court’s judgment and
 conviction. This case is hereby remanded to the circuit court
 for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

 We acknowledge Justice Acoba’s concurring and dissenting opinion,
 
which raises issues surrounding probable cause to support the indictment,
probable cause for Salas’s arrest, suppression of pretrial identifications,
and eyewitness identification instructions.  In light of our decision to
vacate the conviction and to remand the case for new trial, it is unnecessary
for this court to address the merits of these issues.  However, we agree with
Justice Acoba’s observation that “the court must give a specific eyewitness
identification instruction on remand.”  See Concurring and Dissenting Opinion
 
at 19-20.
