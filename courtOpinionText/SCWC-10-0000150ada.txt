RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, AND POLLACK, JJ., AND 
CIRCUIT JUDGE NAKASONE, IN PLACE OF ACOBA, J., RECUSED  
OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.   
I. Introduction 
At issue in this appeal is whether this court should 
impose 
a duty of reasonable care on the Planning Department of the 
County of Hawai ʻi to a property owner, leading to potential 
negligence liability for damages allegedly sustained due to the 
Planning Department’s failure to maintain all pertinent  
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
                     
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REP ORTER *** 
correspondence in its property files at all times.  We hold that 
policy considerations counsel against the judicial creation of 
such a legal duty under the common law, and also hold that there 
is no basis under Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) Chapter 92F 
(the Uniform Information Practices Act (Modified) , or “UIPA” ), 
or Rule 1-8 of the Hawai i County Planning Department Rules of 
Practice and Procedure, to impose negligence liability upon the 
Planning Department based on the temporary absence of a 
government record from its files. We therefore affirm the 
judgment of the ICA, which affirmed the Circuit Court of the 
Third Circuit’s1 order granting the County’s motion for summary 
judgment on Molfino’s negligence claim. 
II. Background 
In this case, Molfino bought a piece of property on the 
Hamakua Coast of the Island of Hawai ʻi, identified by Tax Map Key 
(“TMK”) Number 3 -2-002-035, for $350,000 in June 2003.  Molfino 
wanted to create a subdivision on the property.  He visited the 
Planning Department and made copies of the property’s TMK file. Based on the property’s zoning classification , Molfino 
understood that his property might consist of only two pre-existing lots. Allegedly missing from the TMK file at that time 
was an April 2000 letter from a realtor to the former Planning 
Director, which requested a pre-existing lot determination, and 
1 The Honorable Greg K. Nakamura presided.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REP ORTER *** 
the former Planning Director’s May 2000 response letter, which 
stated that the property consisted of six pre-existing lots.  
Unaware of the prior six-lot determination, Molfino wrote a 
letter to the Planning Department in December 2003 requesting a 
pre-existing lot determination.  Based on the size of the 
property and the number of homes already built upon it, Molfino 
stated to the Planning Department that there was a possibility 
the property actually consisted of seven pre-existing lots.  
Christopher Yuen, the Planning Director, responded to Molfino’s 
letter in June 2004. Yuen’s letter stated that Molfino’s 
property consisted of two pre-existing lots.  Apparently, the 
April 2000 and May 2000 letters were also missing2 from the 
Planning Department’s TMK files when Yuen and his employee, 
Edward Cheplic, prepared the June 2004 letter. 
While awaiting Yuen’s response, Molfino entered into a 
contract to sell the property for $795,000 to Mikhail Pruglo, 
and the deal was closed in July 2004.  When Pruglo applied to subdivide the property, the May 2000 letter resurfaced.  The 
Planning Department honored the May 2000 determination that the 
property consisted of six pre-existing lots and granted Pruglo a 
2 The County does not dispute that these letters were temporarily 
missing from the TMK file. Yuen testified in a deposition that the Planning 
Department’s policy is to keep all correspondence related to a property in the property’s TMK file “essentially forever.”  There is no allegation in the 
complaint, and no evidence in the record , that anyone at the Planning 
Department intentionally or maliciously removed the April and May 2000 
letters from the TMK file.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REP ORTER *** 
six-lot subdivision. The Planning Director inadvertently 
excluded a sliver of land on the property in granting the six-
lot subdivision approval, so he revised his final subdivision 
plat map to include the sliver of land as a seventh lot.  See  
Kellberg v. Yuen , 131 Hawai i 513, 518, 319 P.3d 432, 437 (2014). 
Molfino discovered that Yuen admitted making a mistake in 
the June 2004 letter, which initially determined that the 
property consisted of only two pre-existing lots. Molfino then 
sued Yuen and the County of Hawai ʻi for negligence (among other 
claims, which are no longer at issue on certiorari), alleging 
that they breached a legal duty to use reasonable care in 
maintaining the TMK file, and that this breach caused Molfino 
monetary damages. The County filed its Answer, raising as a 
defense that it owed no duty to Molfino. 
The County later filed a motion for summary judgment on 
Molfino’s negligence claim. The County pointed out that Molfino 
based his negligence claim solely on a duty to maintain records 
purportedly contained in the Hawai i County Planning Department 
Rules of Practice and Procedure, Rule 1-8 (“Rule 1 -8”), which 
provides the following: 
1-8 Public Records.  
All public records shall be available for inspection  by any 
person during established office hours unless public 
inspection of such records is in violation of any other state, federal, or county law; provided that, except where 
such records are open un
der any rule of court, the 
Corporation Counsel or Prosecuting Attorney may determine which records may be withheld from public inspection when 
4
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
(Emphasis added). The County argued that Rule 1-8 mandates 
inspection of public records, not the maintenance of those 
records. The County then cited to Cootey v. Sun. Inv.  Inc., 68 
Haw. 480, 485, 718 P.2d 1086, 1090 (1986), for the proposition 
that the County “is not intended to be an insurer of all the 
dangers of modern life, despite its ever-increasing effort to 
protect its citizen s from peril.” Further, “[w]ithout a 
reasonable and proper limitation of the scope of duty of care 
owed by the County, the County would be confronted with an 
unmanageable, unbearable, and totally unpredictable liability.” 
68 Haw. at 484, 718 P.2d at 1090.  The County concluded that 
imposing a legal duty upon it to maintain records that it has no duty to keep would impe rmissibly reallocate the County’ s 
resources (a task better suited to a legislative body); expose  
the County to potentially infinite liability; lengthen the  
permit process timeline; and dissuade the County from enacting  
subdivision rules, regulations, and laws, contrary to the public  
interest. Molfino counter-argued that “the duty to main tain  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REP ORTER *** 
such records pertain to the preparation of the prosecution 
or defense of any action or proceeding to which the County 
is or may be a party, or when such records do not relate to 
a matter in violation of law and are deemed necessary for 
the protection of the character or reputation of any 
person. 
Copies of records printed or reproduced for persons other 
than governmental agencies shall be given to any person, 
provided that the fees or costs prescribed in the Hawaii 
County Code are paid. 
5

  
 
 
  
 The circuit court agreed with the County. In an order 
granting the County’s motion for summary judgment, the circuit 
court reasoned as follows:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REP ORTER *** 
accurate records follows from [Rule 1-8’s] duty to make public 
records available to any person.” 
1. There is no express requirement in Rule § 1-8 of the 
Planning Department Rules of Practice and Procedure that 
the Planning Department records be kept in any particular 
condition. Rather, this rule allows records to be open for 
public inspection. It does not require that the records be 
maintained so that they can be relied upon by the general 
public in making major decisions; 
2. The Hawai i County Code contains a formal mechanism for 
subdivision approval which identifies how to determine 
whether real property is subject to subdivision and under 
what conditions. This determination should not be based 
upon a review of the Planning Department ’s records. 
Whether or not real property is subject to subdivision and 
under what conditions based upon a review of Planning 
Department records only would be speculative, at best; 
3. Imposing a duty of care to maintain Planning Department 
records with reasonable accuracy invites unremitted 
liability. For example, it would be too easy for a person 
to manufacture a case by reviewing the records and claiming 
reliance upon the status of the records for their actions 
or omissions; 
4. If a duty and liability is to be imposed upon the 
County to maintain Planning Department records with 
unerring accuracy, it should be imposed by a legislative 
body. A legislative body is the proper entity to determine 
whether [to spend] the County’ s scarce resources on such a 
duty and is capable of providing additional economic resources which may be necessary; 
5. The Planning Department owes no duty to keep its 
records accurate and complete for persons who seek 
information regarding the degree to which real property may 
be capable of subdivision. 
The circuit court subsequently entered judgment in favor of the 
County and against Molfino, and Molfino appealed.  Before the 
ICA, Molfino argued for the first time that the Planning 
Department’s legal duty to maintain accurate, relevant, timely ,  
6

  
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REP ORTER *** 
and complete records stems from HRS Chapter 92F. The County 
counter-argued that, even if the ICA were to consider HRS 
Chapter 92F, Molfino’s argument would still fail. The County 
argued that HRS Chapter 92F simply requires access to those 
records a government agency has in fact maintained. See Nuuanu  
Valley Ass’n v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 119 Hawai i 90, 97, 194 
P.3d 531, 538 (2008) (citing State of Hawai i Org. of Police 
Officers (SHOPO) v. Soc’y of Prof’l Journalists - Univ. of Hawai i 
Chapter, 83 Hawai i 378, 393, 927 P.2d 386, 401 (1996)). 
In a summary disposition order, the ICA affirmed the 
circuit court’s judgment, holding that the circuit court 
properly concluded “that the Planning Department did not have a 
statutorily-based duty to maintain its records with unerring 
accuracy.” Molfino v. Yuen, CAAP-10-0000150 (App. Aug. 28, 
2013) (SDO) at 5. The ICA noted that Molfino had not cited any cases “establishing a common law duty of this nature. . . .” 
Id. The ICA lastly concluded, “Strong policy considerations 
compel us to reject” Molfino’s argument. Id. This case is now 
before us on certiorari review. 
III.  Standard of Review 
This court reviews a circuit court’s grant of summary 
judgment de novo . See Hawai i Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Keka , 
94 Hawai i 213, 221, 11 P.3d 1, 9 (2000). “[S]ummary judgment is 
7
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REP ORTER *** 
appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to 
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the 
affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to 
any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to 
judgment as a matter o f law.” Id.  
IV. Discussion 
In order to prevail on a negligence claim, a plaintiff is 
required to prove all four of the necessary elements of 
negligence: 
(1) A duty, or obligation, recognized by the law, requiring 
the defendant to conform to a certain standard of conduct, 
for the protection of others against unreasonable risks; 
(2) A failure on the defendant’s part to conform to the 
standard required: a breach of the duty; (3) A reasonably 
close causal connection between the conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) Actual loss or damage resulting 
to the interests of another. 
Takayama v. Kaiser Found. Hosp. , 81 Hawai i 486, 498-99, 923 P.2d 
903, 915-16 (1996) (citation and brackets omitted)).  A 
prerequisite to any negligence action is the existence of a duty 
owed by the defendant to the plaintiff. Lee v. Corregedore, 83 
Hawaii 154, 158, 925 P.2d 324, 328 (1996). The existence of a 
duty is entirely a question of law. See 
Hao v. Campbell Estate, 
76 Hawai i 77, 80, 869 P.2d 216, 219 (1994) (citation omitted).  
Whether a duty exists is a “question of fairness that involves a 
weighing of the nature of the risk, the magnitude of the burden 
of guarding against the risk, and the public interest in the 
8

  
 
 
   
    
  
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REP ORTER *** 
proposed solution.” Id. (citation omitted). This court has 
chosen to impose tort duties reluctantly: 
In considering whether to impose a duty of reasonable care 
on a defendant, we recognize that duty is not sacrosanct in 
itself, but only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the 
particular plaintiff is entitled to protection. Legal 
duties are not discoverable facts of nature, but merely 
conclusory expressions that, in cases of a particular type, 
liability should be imposed for damage done. In determining whether or not a duty is owed, we must weigh 
the considerations of policy which favor the appellants’ 
recovery against those which favor limiting the appellees ’ 
liability. The question of whether one owes a duty to 
another must be decided on a case -by-case basis.  However, 
we are reluctant to impose a new duty upon members of our 
society without any logical, sound, and compelling reasons 
taking into consideration the social and human 
relationships in our society. 
McKenzie v. Hawai i Permanente Med. Group, Inc. , 98 Hawai i 296, 
301, 47 P.3d 1209, 1214 (2002) (citations omitted). 
One such case in which this court declined to impose a duty 
was Cootey, 68 Haw. 480, 718 P.2d 1086, a case which the County 
relied upon in its moving papers, and which the circuit court 
and ICA drew heavily from in ruling in the County’s favor. In 
Cootey, plaintiff homeowners (the Cooteys) sued the County of 
Hawaii for negligently approving a subdivision, the development 
of which allegedly caused flooding on the Cooteys’ p roperty. 68  
Haw. at 482, 718 P.2d at 1088-89.  The Cooteys claimed that the County owed them a “duty to administer and enforce the 
applicable laws, rules and regulations and directives of the 
County and the State of Hawaii. . . .” 68 Haw. at 482, 718 P.2 d 
at 1089. This court disagreed, holding that such a duty was 
9

  
 
 
  
 In Cootey, this court noted that the determination of 
whether a duty exists requires a balancing of “the policy 
considerations supporting recovery by the injured party against 
those favoring a limitation of the County’s liability.” 68 Haw. 
at 484, 718 P.2d at 1090. The court struck the balance in favor 
of  limiting the County’s liability. 68 Haw. at 483, 718 P.2d at 
1089. This court stated, “Government is not intended to be an insurer of all the dangers of modern life, despite its ever-
increasing effort to protect its citizens from peril.” 68 Haw. 
at 485, 718 P.2d at 1090. Government should not be “liable for 
all injuries sustained by private persons as a result of 
governmental activity, even though doing so would spread the 
losses over the largest possible base.” Id.  (citation omitted). 
Government agencies must still be able to function effectively 
for their own “socially approved ends.” Id.  (citation omitted). 
This court held that the imposition of a duty in the Cooteys’ 
situation would “reorder[] priorities and forc[e] reallocation 
of resources upon the other branches [primarily the legislative 
branch] which make policy decisions in this regard.” 68 Haw. at 
485, 486, 718 P.2d at 1090-91, 1091. Specifically, “exposure to 
such liability would unduly lengthen the permit process, or *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REP ORTER *** 
“too expansive in light of public policy considerations versus 
liability and remedial considerations.” 68 Haw. at 483, 718 
P.2d at 1089. 
10
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REP ORTER *** 
could very well dissuade the County from enacting rules, 
regulations and laws applicable to proposed subdivisions and 
intended for the protection and welfare of the public, a result 
contrary to the public interest.” 68 Haw. at 486, 718 P.2d at 
1091 (citations omitted). In conclusion, this court held that 
the imposition of a legal duty in Cootey would result in 
“unmanageable, unbearable, and totally unpredictable liability” 
for the County. 68 Haw. at 484, 718 P.2d at 1090. 
We agree with the ICA that similar policy considerations in 
the instant case counsel against the judicial creation of a 
legal duty for potential negligence liability to be imposed upon 
the County for an alleged failure to maintain the May 2000 
letter in the Planning Department’s TMK files. First, we a gree 
with the ICA that there appears to be no common law basis for imposing a legal duty to maintain government records in complete 
condition at all times. Second, we also agree with the ICA that 
there is no statutory basis for imposing such a legal duty under these circumstances. 
In this case, before the circuit court, Molfino’s sole 
support for his claim that the County owed him a legal duty to 
maintain accurate Planning Department records was Rule 1-8, 
which requires only that “[a]ll public records s hall be 
available for inspection by any person,” and contains no express duty to maintain these records in “accurate, relevant, timely, 
11
  
 
 
  
   
 
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REP ORTER *** 
and complete” condition. We note, however, that Rule 1 -8 is 
similar to HRS Chapter 92F in that both afford the public a 
right to inspect government records. HRS § 92F-11(a) (2012) 
states, “All government records are open to public inspection 
unless access is restricted or closed by law.” Further, HRS 
§ 92F-12(a)(15) (2012) requires each agency to “make available 
for public inspection and duplication during regular business 
hours . . . [i]nformation collected and maintained for the 
purpose of making information available to the general public 
. . . .” Although not an express record -keeping requirement 
under HRS §§ 92F-11(a) and -12(a)(15), HRS § 92F-2(2) (2012) provides that one of the “underlying purposes and policies” of 
HRS Chapter 92F is to “[p]rovide for accurate, relevant, timely, 
and complete government records. . . .” Thus, it is helpful to 
examine HRS Chapter 92F and cases construing that chapter to 
determine whether the County owes a legal duty to Molfino to 
maintain accurate, relevant, timely, and complete government records at all times. 
Two key cases construing HRS Chapter 92F are Nuuanu Valley 
Ass’n, 119 Hawai i 90, 194 P.3d 531, and SHOPO, 83 Hawai i 378, 
927 P.2d 386. In these cases, we held that HRS Chapter 92F “requires agencies to provide access to those records that are 
actually maintained.” Nuuanu Valley Ass’n
, 119 Hawai i at 97, 
194 P.3d at 538 (citing SHOPO, 83 Hawai i at 393, 927 P.2d at 
12

  
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REP ORTER *** 
401). In Nuuanu  Valley Ass’n , this court further explained, 
“Whether the [records] are ‘actually maintained’ [by the 
government agency] depends on whether [the agency] ‘chose[ ] to 
retain possession or control[]’ of the records.” Id.   (citation 
omitted). 
In this case, Yuen testified at his deposition that the 
Planning Commission’s policy is that “any incoming or outgoing 
correspondence is supposed to be kept essentially fore ver” in a 
property’s TMK files. 
Therefore, the Planning Commission 
generally chooses to retain possession and control over letters 
like the 2000 letters.  Thus, under Nuuanu  Valley Ass’n  and 
SHOPO
, the Planning Department failed to provide Molfino with 
access to the May 2000 pre-existing lot determination, which the 
Planning Department admittedly should have maintained in its TMK 
files but did not. 
We must determine, however, whether this failure triggers a 
legal duty under tort law leading to potential negligence liability. In examining the rest of Chapter 92F, however, we 
fail to discern any legislative intent to impose tort liability 
upon a government agency for its failure to maintain government 
records in accurate, relevant, timely, and complete condition at 
all times. Legislative intent may be gleaned from reading 
“statutory language in the context of the entire statute and 
construing it in a manner consistent with its purpose.” Lingle 
13
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HRS § 92F-16 (2012) provides immunity from liability as  follows: 
“Anyone participating in good faith in the disclosure or 
nondisclosure of a government record shall be immune from any 
liability, civil or criminal, that might otherwise be incurred, 
imposed or result from such acts or omissions.” Thus, HRS 
Chapter 92F only expressly imposes criminal penalties for 
3   HRS Chapter intentional violations of confidentiality statutes.
92F, when read as a whole, does not reflect a legislative intent 
to impose tort liability for merely negligent acts or omissions 
of government agencies in the maintenance of public records. In 
                     
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REP ORTER *** 
v. Haw. Gov’t Emps. Ass’n, AFSCME, Local 152, AFL-CIO, 107 
Hawaii 178, 183, 111 P.3d 587, 592 (2005) (citation omitted).  
Other provisions of HRS Chapter 92F speak to the consequences for violating the UIPA. HRS § 92F-17 (2012) provides the 
following: 
Criminal penalties. (a) An officer or employee of an agency 
who intentionally discloses or provides a copy of a 
government record, or any confidential information 
explicitly described by specific confidentiality statutes, 
to any person or agency with actual knowledge that 
disclosure is prohibited, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, 
unless a greater penalty is otherwise provided for by law. (b) A person who intentionally gains access to or obtains a 
copy of a government record by false pretense, bribery, or 
theft, with actual knowledge that access is prohibited, or 
who intentionally obtains any confidential information by 
false pretense, bribery, or theft, with actual knowledge that it is prohibited [by] a confidentiality statute, shall 
be guilty of a misdemeanor . 
3 We express no opinion as to whether HRS Chapter 92F imposes tort 
liability for bad faith disclosures or nondisclosures of government records, 
as bad faith nondisclosure was not alleged in this case, nor does the record 
show that the absence of the May 2000 letter from the Planning Department's 
TMK files was in bad faith. 
14
  
 
 
    
 
 We hold that neither Rule 1-8 of the Hawai i County Planning  
Department Rules of Practice and Procedure nor HRS Chapter 92F 
provides a statutory basis for imposing negligence liability 
upon the Planning Department of the County of Hawai i based on  a 
breach of any duty to maintain its TMK files in accurate, 
relevant, timely, and complete condition at all times. We hold 
that policy considerations counsel against the judicial creation 
of a legal duty under the common law, leading to negligence 
liability, under the circumstances present on the record in  this 
case. We therefore affirm the ICA’s judgment on appeal, which affirmed the circuit court’s order granting the County’s motion 
for summary judgment.  
   
  
 
      
  
   
        
 
       *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REP ORTER *** 
other words, HRS Chapter 92F does not create a statutory legal 
duty, flowing from the Planning Department to Molfino, to 
maintain a property’s TMK file in accurate, relevant, timely, 
and complete condition at all times, such that the Planning 
Department should be liable for negligence because the May 2000 
letter was temporarily missing from the file.
