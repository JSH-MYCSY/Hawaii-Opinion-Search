OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAYAMA, J.
  
Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellee the State of Hawai
'i 
(State) has asked this court to determine whether the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) gravely erred when it held that lost wages may not be awarded as restitution pursuant to HRS  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
§ 706-646 (Supp. 2006). We hold that HRS § 706-646 permits
 
restitution for reasonable and verified lost wages in appropriate
 circumstances. Here, the District Court of the Second Circuit
 (district court) acted within its discretion when it ordered
 Respondent/Defendant-Appellant Lawrence DeMello, Jr. (DeMello) to
 pay restitution for wages that the Complaining Witness (CW) lost
 as a result of DeMello’s unlawful conduct. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On May 10, 2008, a physical altercation involving
 
DeMello and the CW occurred at the CW’s home. As a result of the
 altercation, DeMello was charged with one count of harassment in
 violation of HRS § 711-1106(1)(a) (Supp. 1996) and one count of
 trespass in violation of HRS § 708-815(1) (1993). The district
 court held a bench trial on December 14, 2009.

At trial, the CW testified that on the night in
 
question, she, her husband, and DeMello had been arguing about
 the proper care of her husband’s son. The argument escalated
 into a physical altercation. Eventually DeMello grabbed the CW
 by the hair and dragged her about ten feet across her lawn. The
 CW testified that she experienced immediate, excruciating pain,
 and that she blacked out. At the close of trial, the district
 court found DeMello guilty of both charges.

 The Honorable Kelsey T. Kawano presided.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
At the State’s request, the district court held
 
restitution hearings on August 2, 2010, and September 20, 2010. 
During the first hearing, the CW testified that in the days
 following the altercation, she experienced chronic pain in her
 neck and shoulders, blurred vision, and that she had difficulty
 standing. The CW also testified that due to her injuries, she
 was unable to perform her job duties as a hairdresser for a ten-
day period. The State entered the CW’s hairdressing appointment
 ledger into evidence. With respect to the ledger, Defense
 counsel stated: 
We will stipulate that [the CW] will say each of these names
that are listed on her ledger, that she will say how much
she charged, and . . . the taxes added, . . . and that the
total amount is indicated as $1,155.12. 
We are not stipulating that this is true, only that this is
what [the CW] will testify to.
 
At the second hearing, DeMello argued: 
With respect to the lost wages and therapy, we would argue
that that is not applicable to the restitution statute.
. . . . 
We would argue that the Legislature, when they amended [HRS
§ 706-646] in 1998, did not intend to include wage loss and
therapy.
 
And [House] Standing Committee Report Number 683-98, the
House stated . . . “wage loss was ‘more appropriate’ for the
civil arena.”
 
The district court disagreed. It ordered DeMello to pay $3,387
 
in restitution, including $1,155 in restitution for the ten-day
 period when the CW was unable to work. 
On appeal, the ICA reversed. It held, among other
 
3
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
things, that lost wages are not a compensable category of
 
restitution pursuant to HRS § 706-646. Accordingly, the ICA
 vacated the restitution order and remanded for a new restitution
 
hearing.

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
The proper interpretation of a statute is a question of 
law that is reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard. 
Gillan v. Gov’t Emps. Ins. Co., 119 Hawai' i 109, 124, 194 P.3d 
1071, 1086 (2008). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
HRS § 706-646(2) (subsection 2) provides, in relevant
 
part: “The court shall order the defendant to make restitution
 for reasonable and verified losses suffered by the victim or
 victims as a result of the defendant’s offense when requested by
 the victim.” HRS § 706-646(3) (subsection 3) provides, in
 relevant part: “Restitution shall be a dollar amount that is
 sufficient to reimburse any victim fully for losses, including
 but not limited to: (a) Full value of stolen or damaged property
 . . . ; (b) Medical expenses; and (c) Funeral and burial expenses
 incurred as a result of the crime.” The State has asked this
 court to determine whether HRS § 706-646 authorizes restitution
 
2
 The ICA also remanded for a new hearing on the apportionment of
 
medical expenses and for resentencing on DeMello’s harassment conviction.  
Neither of those determinations were challenged in the State’s application for
writ of certiorari.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
for lost wages.  We hold that HRS § 706-646 permits restitution
for reasonable and verified lost wages in appropriate
circumstances.3
A.The Plain Language of HRS § 706-646
The plain language of a statute is “the fundamental
starting point of statutory interpretation.”  State v. Wheeler,
121 Hawai# i 383, 390, 219 P.3d 1170, 1177 (2009) (internal
quotations omitted).  “Courts are bound, if rational and
practicable, to give effect to all parts of a statute and no
clause, sentence or word shall be construed as superfluous, void
or insignificant if construction can be legitimately found which
will give force to and preserve all words of the statute.”  Dawes
v. First Ins. Co. of Hawai #i, Ltd., 77 Hawai# i 117, 135, 883 P.2d
38, 56 (1994) (citation omitted).  Additionally, “this court must
presume that the legislature meant what it said and is further
barred from rejecting otherwise unambiguous statutory language.” 
Morgan v. Planning Dep’t, Cnty. of Kauai , 104 Hawai #i 173, 185,
86 P.3d 982, 994 (2004) (quoting Sato v. Tawata , 79 Hawai #i 14,
23, 897 P.2d 941, 950 (1995) (Ramil, J., dissenting)).  
[W]here there is no ambiguity in the language of a statute,
3We define “wage” to mean: “[A] payment usu. of money for labor or
services usu. according to contract and on an hourly, daily, or piecework
basis.”  Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary of Law 529 (1996).  Although somesources define “lost wages” to encompass loss of earning capacity, Black’s LawDictionary 1812 (10th ed. 2014), that concept is not at issue in this case andwould seem to fall outside the scope of HRS § 706-646’s requirement that lostwages be “verified” rather than merely quantifiable.     
5*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and the literal application of the language would not
produce an absurd or unjust result, clearly inconsistent
with the purposes and policies of the statute, there is no
room for judicial construction and interpretation, and the
statute must be given effect according to its plain and
obvious meaning.
 
State v. Palama, 62 Haw. 159, 161, 612 P.2d 1168, 1170 (1980)
 
(brackets in original, citation omitted). 
The plain language of HRS § 706-646(2) states that the
 
court “shall order the defendant to make restitution for . . .
 losses suffered by the victim.” In other words, subsection 2 is
 mandatory and its scope is broad. However, subsection 2 imposes
 four requirements before restitution must be awarded; the
 victim’s losses must be (1) “reasonable,” (2) “verified,” (3)
 “suffered . . . as a result of the defendant’s conduct,” and (4)
 “requested by the victim.” These limitations impose thresholds
 that relate to proof and to procedure, but do not limit the
 categories of restitution that are compensable. Thus, as
 subsection 2 contains no language that would exclude lost wages,
 an award that did not compensate a victim for lost wages would
 not fulfill the court’s mandatory duty to order restitution for
 “losses” in appropriate circumstances. Accordingly, the plain
 language of subsection 2 appears to require restitution for lost
 wages subject to the aforementioned limitations. 
Subsection 2 operates in harmony with subsection 3,
 
which also is mandatory and broad in scope. Subsection 3
 contains both a prefatory clause and an illustrative list. 
6
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Turning first to the prefatory clause, subsection 3 mandates that
 
“[r]estitution shall be a dollar amount that is sufficient to
 reimburse any victim fully for losses.” (Emphasis added). An
 award that did not include reasonable and verified income lost as
 a result of the defendant’s unlawful conduct would not reimburse
 a victim fully for losses. Therefore, the plain language of the
 prefatory clause also appears to require restitution for lost
 wages. 
Subsection 3’s illustrative list states, in context: 
“Restitution shall be a dollar amount that is sufficient to reimburse any victim fully for losses, including but not limited to: (a) Full value of stolen or damaged property . . .; (b) Medical expenses; and (c) Funeral and burial expenses.” (Emphasis added). This list is an inclusive list rather than an exhaustive one. See State v. Mita, 124 Hawai' i 385, 391, 245 
P.3d 458, 464 (2010) (explaining that the phrase “shall include but not be limited to” provides “an inclusive, rather than exclusive, list of examples”); see also Black’s Law Dictionary at 880 (10th ed. 2014) (“The participle including typically indicates a partial list . . . [b]ut some drafters use phrases such as including without limitation and including but not limited to -- which mean the same thing.”). In other words, the legislature’s use of the phrase “including but not limited to” indicates that the three categories of losses enumerated in 
7
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
subsection 3 are not the only categories of losses that may be
 
recovered pursuant to the statutory scheme. Any other reading
 would render the phrase “including but not limited to”
 meaningless. 
Even if subsection 3 were to be viewed as a 
definitional parameter, verified lost wages are similar in kind to the losses illustrated in subsection 3 -- verified pecuniary losses. See Zanakis-Pico v. Cutter Dodge, Inc., 98 Hawai' i 309, 
321, 47 P.3d 1222, 1234 (2002) (stating that pecuniary losses are “those damages (either general or special) which can be accurately calculated in monetary terms such as loss of wages and cost of medical expenses”). Indeed, lost wages are routinely grouped with the types of losses illustrated in subsection 3. See, e.g., State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Dacanay, 87 Hawai' i 
136, 138 n.3, 952 P.2d 893, 895 n.3 (App. 1998) (“Special damages are often considered synonymous with pecuniary loss and include such items as medical and hospital expenses [and] loss of earnings.”). Of course, pecuniary losses that are merely quantifiable rather than verified, would not comport with the requirements of subsection 2. 
Requiring restitution for reasonable and verified lost
 
wages would not lead to an absurd result. One purpose motivating
 the passage of HRS § 706-646 were the perceived gaps in victim
 compensation through the Crime Victim Compensation Commission
 
8
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(CVCC). See H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 683-98, in 1998 House
 
Journal, at 1305 (“Although the Criminal Injuries Compensation
 
Commission helps victims by providing some compensation, victims
 of property crimes and some violent crimes are not eligible for
 any compensation from the Commission.”).
4 Here, due to the
 
nature of DeMello’s crimes, the CW would not have been eligible
 for an award from the CVCC. See HRS §§ 351-31 and 351-32. Thus,
 
our interpretation of HRS § 706-646 is in accordance with the
 legislature’s underlying purpose to provide restitution for
 victims who are ineligible for CVCC compensation.
 
Additionally, restitution for reasonable and verified 
lost wages would not place an unreasonable administrative burden on trial courts. HRS § 706-646 already requires the allocation of court resources to provide restitution for medical expenses, especially where apportionment for a pre-existing, symptomatic injury is at issue. See Montalvo v. Lapez, 77 Hawai' i 282, 299, 
884 P.2d 345, 362 (1994) (requiring apportionment of damages caused by a pre-existing, symptomatic injury). In most cases, the additional burden of adjudicating reasonable and verified lost wages will be consolidated into other hearings that trial courts are already required to hold. Furthermore, HRS § 706-646, according to its terms, safeguards against adjudication of unduly 
4
 The CVCC was originally called the Criminal Injuries Compensation
 
Commission.  See 1967 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 226, § at 332.
 
9
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
complex wage loss issues. Where lost wages cannot be verified,
 
which may be the case if the victim was unemployed or if the
 request is for expected future income, adjudication will require
 a more extensive civil proceeding. 
In sum, there is nothing in the language of HRS § 706­
646 to suggest that the kind of losses at issue in this case,
 reasonable and verified lost wages, would be unrecoverable in a
 restitution proceeding. Not only are such losses capable of
 adjudication in the type of streamlined proceedings contemplated
 by the statute, they comport with the statutory mandate that the
 court “shall order the defendant to make restitution for . . .
 losses suffered by the victim . . . [in] a dollar amount that is
 sufficient to reimburse any victim fully for losses.” Therefore,
 in accordance with the plain language of the statute, we hold
 that lost wages are recoverable pursuant to HRS § 706-646. 
B. The Legislative History of HRS § 706-646
 
If statutory language is ambiguous or doubt exists as
 
to its meaning, “‘[c]ourts may take legislative history into
 
consideration.’” Franks v. City and Cnty. of Honolulu, 74 Haw.
 
328, 335, 843 P.2d 668, 671-72 (1993) (quoting Life of the Land
 v. City and Cnty. of Honolulu, 61 Haw. 390, 447, 606 P.2d 866,
 899 (1980). Even where statutory language appears unambiguous
 upon initial review, “an examination of sources other than the
 language of the statute itself” may be essential “to adequately
 
10
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
discern the underlying policy which the legislature seeks to 
promulgate . . . to determine if a literal construction would produce an absurd or unjust result, inconsistent with the policies of the statute.” Sato, 79 Hawai' i at 17, 897 P.2d at 
944. 
However, “we do not resort to legislative history to 
cloud a statutory text that is clear.” State v. Kalama, 94 
Hawai'i 60, 64, 8 P.3d 1224, 1228 (2000) (internal citation and 
quotation marks omitted) (declining to rely on a legislative committee report expressing views that did not correspond to the statutory language ultimately enacted). This court has repeatedly declined to rely on legislative history where the plain language of the statute did not produce an absurd result, even in situations where “the history may show that the legislature really meant and intended something not expressed by the phraseology of the statute.” State v. Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai' i 
235, 251, 178 P.3d 1, 17 (2008) (internal quotations and citation omitted). 
We cannot change the language of the statute, supply a want,
or enlarge upon it in order to make it suit a certain state
of facts.  We do not legislate or make laws.  Even where the
 Court is convinced in its own mind that the Legislature
really meant and intended something not expressed by the
phraseology of the Act, it has no authority to depart from
the plain meaning of the language used.
 
State v. Dudoit, 90 Hawai' i 262, 271, 978 P.2d 700, 709 (1999) 
(emphasis removed) (quoting State v. Meyer, 61 Haw. 74, 77, 595 
11
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
P.2d 288, 291 (1979)). 
Additionally, the role of legislative history is 
limited to the extent it sheds reliable light on the enacting 
legislature’s understanding of an otherwise ambiguous term. See 
Exxon Mobile Corp. v. Allapattah Servs., Inc., 545 U.S. 546, 550 (2005). “‘Statements by legislators or even committee reports need not reflect the purpose which a majority of the legislators believed is carried out by [a] statute.’” Dines v. Pac. Ins. 
Co., Ltd., 78 Hawai' i 325, 332, 893 P.2d 176, 183 (1995) (quoting 
Yoshizaki v. Hilo Hosp., 50 Haw. 150, 153 n.5, 433 P.2d 220, 223 n.5 (1967)). “Only ‘unmistakable support in the history and structure of the legislation’ can justify a rejection of otherwise unambiguous language.” Richardson v. City and Cnty. of 
Honolulu, 76 Hawai' i 46, 57, 868 P.2d 1193, 1204 (1994) (quoting 
Blue Chips Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723, 756 (1975) (Powell, J., concurring)). 
In this case, the relevant legislative history
 
encompasses the 1998 enactment of HRS § 706-646 and the 2006
 amendments to the statute. 
1. 1998 Enactment of HRS § 706-646
 
In 1998, House Bill No. 2776 (H.B. 2776) was introduced
 
to “permit an order for restitution in a criminal case to be
 
enforceable as a civil judgment.” H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 683­
12
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
98, in 1998 House Journal, at 1305. At that time, the collection
 
of restitution was consigned to governmental entities that were
 only able to collect “a small fraction of the amount.” Id. The
 
legislation was also designed to provide restitution to victims
 who were ineligible for compensation from the CVCC. See id.
 
(“Although the Criminal Injuries Compensation Commission helps
 victims by providing some compensation, victims of property
 crimes and some violent crimes are not eligible for any
 compensation from the Commission.”). The proponents of H.B. 2776
 acknowledged that “although a victim may bring a civil action
 against the defendant, this process is costly and time
 consuming.” Id. Therefore, the legislature proposed “that
 
victims should have a ‘fast track’ ability to be compensated for
 their losses . . . using all of the civil collection remedies.” 
Id.; see also S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 3008, in 1998 Senate
 Journal, at 1224; Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 89, in 1998 Senate
 Journal, at 780. 
H.B. 2776, as initially proposed, expressly included
 
“wage loss” and the cost of “therapeutic treatment” in the
 partial list of compensable losses contained in subsection 3. 
However, the House Judiciary Committee removed those categories
 from subsection 3 prior to the second reading of H.B. 2776. See
 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 683-98, in 1998 House Journal, at 1305­06. The committee stated:
 
13
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
[A]llowing restitution for therapy and wage loss presents
difficulty because these costs are often immeasurable. 
While the value of stolen or damaged property, medical
expenses, and funeral and burial expenses can be determined
with specificity, costs of therapy, which can last for
months or years after the defendant is sentenced, are not. 
Also, wage loss may be measurable if the victim has an
occupation at the time of the offense, but it becomes
difficult to determine if the victim is unemployed at the
time.  Your Committee finds that this remedy is more
appropriate for the civil arena. 
. . . .
 
Accor
dingly, your Committee has amended this bill by:
 
. . . . 
(2)
 Not allowing for reimbursement of wage loss incurred by
the victim and cost of therapeutic treatment required by the
victim to recover from the psychological and emotional
effects of the offense in the restitution order.  
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 683-98, in 1998 House Journal, at 1305­
06. Despite these statements, the legislature did not amend H.B.
 2776 to expressly provide that lost wages were not recoverable,
 nor did it propose language that would have made subsection 3 an
 exhaustive list. Rather, H.B. 2776, as initially amended,
 appeared to encompass restitution for a broad scope of losses. 
The Senate Ways and Means Committee attempted to
 
clarify the scope of H.B. 2776 by deleting the word “fully” from
 subsection 3’s full compensation clause. See
 S. Stand. Comm.
 
Rep. No. 3008, in 1998 Senate Journal, at 1224 (explaining that
 the Committee deleted the word “fully” “to clarify the legitimate
 types of damages” that a victim could recover). It stated:
 “Reimbursing the victim ‘fully’ for losses may be interpreted as
 having an unlimited practical application, and allows for many
 
14
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
legitimate types of damages that may require a more extensive
 
civil proceeding.” Id.; see also H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 683­
98, in 1998 House Journal, at 1305 (attempting to relegate wage
 loss to the civil arena). Thus, the Senate Ways and Means
 Committee’s amendment attempted to effectuate the House’s intent
 to limit the scope of compensable losses contained in H.B. 2776. 
However, when House and Senate representatives convened
 
in conference, the Conference Committee reinserted the word
 “fully” into the statute. See Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 89, in 1998
 
Senate Journal, at 780-81 (“Your Committee on Conference has
 amended this bill by: . . . . (2) Reinserting the word ‘fully’ in
 section (3) of the new section 706- (Victim Restitution”)). The
 Conference Committee explained that it reinserted the word
 “fully” “so that restitution shall be a dollar amount sufficient
 to reimburse any victim fully for losses.” Id. In light of the
 
purpose behind the House’s and the Senate’s previous amendments
 to H.B. 2776, the Conference Committee’s reinsertion of the word
 “fully” expresses the intent of both chambers to not
 categorically exclude such losses as wage loss from the scope of
 HRS § 706-646. See Demby v. Schweiker, 671 F.2d 507, 510 (D.C.
 
Cir. 1981) (explaining that a conference report that presents the
 final statement of terms accepted by both houses is the most
 persuasive evidence of legislative intent, next to the statute
 itself). To the extent there is an alternative interpretation of
 
15
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the legislative history, it does not provide the “unmistakable
 
support” required to “justify a rejection of otherwise
 unambiguous [statutory] language.”
5 Richardson, 76 Hawai' i at 
57, 868 P.2d at 1204.
 
2. 2006 Amendments to HRS § 706-646
 
The dissent focuses on the legislative history of the
 
original 1998 version of HRS § 706-646 to argue that the
 
legislature did not intend to allow recovery for “lost wages” in
 a restitution award. Whatever the legislature may have stated in
 1998, the 2006 amendments to Section 706-646 make it clear that
 reasonable and verified lost wages must be included in a
 restitution award when requested by a victim.
 
Section 22 of Act 230 of 2006 amended HRS § 706-646 as
 
follows:
 
SECTION 22. Section 706-646, Hawai 'i Rev ised Statutes, is
amended by amending subsections (2) and (3) to read as
follows: 
“(2) 
The court [may] shall order the defendant to make
restitution for reasonable and verified losses suffered by
the victim or victims as a result of the defendant’s
 offense[.] when requested by the victim.  The court [may]
shall order restitution to be paid to the crime victim
compensation commission in the event that the victim has
been given an award for compensation under chapter 351.  If
 
the court orders payment of a fine in addition to
restitution or a compensation fee, or both, the payment of
restitution and compensation fee shall have priority over
 
5
 The dissent erroneously ascribes the intent of the entire 
legislature to a report from a single house committee that is contra-indicatedby the plain language of the statute.  See Dines, 78 Hawai 'i at 332, 893 P.2d
at 183 (“Statements by legislators or even committee reports need not reflectthe purpose which a majority of the legislators believed is carried out by [a]statute.”).   
16
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the payment of the fine, and payment of restitution shall
have priority over payment of a compensation fee.
 
(3) In ordering restitution, the court shall not consider
the defendant’s financial ability to make restitution in
determining the amount of restitution to order.  The court,
however, shall consider the defendant’s financial ability to
make restitution for the purpose of establishing the time
and manner of payment.  The court shall specify the time and
manner in which restitution is to be paid.  Restitution
 shall be a dollar amount that is sufficient to reimburse any
victim fully for losses, including but not limited to:
 
(a) Full value of stolen or damaged property, as
determined by replacement costs of like property, or the
actual or estimated cost of repair, if repair is possible;
 
(b) Medical expenses; and
 
(c) Funeral and burial expenses incurred as a result of
the crime.”
 
(Emphasis added). This amendment to HRS § 706-646 was one of
 
numerous proposed amendments to the Hawai' i Penal Code included in 
the Report of the Committee to Conduct a Comprehensive Review of
 the Hawai' i Penal Code (“Penal Code Review Committee”) Submitted 
to the Twenty-third Legislature of the State of Hawai' i on 
December 29, 2005. 
See S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No 3215, in 2006
 
Senate Journal, at 1557. According to this committee report, the
 proposals of the Penal Code Review Committee were recommended for
 adoption. Id. 
Furthermore, according to the Comment of the Penal Code
 
Review Committee regarding the proposed amendments to the
 restitution statute:
 
(1) The proposed amendments to subsections (2) and (3) make
it mandatory for the court to order a defendant to pay full
restitution for reasonable and verified losses suffered by
the victim of a crime when requested by the victim.  An
 informal request for restitution may be sufficient.  The
 
17
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
court is prohibited from considering the defendant’s
financial ability to make restitution in determining the
amount of restitution to order.  The court, however, is
required to consider the defendant’s financial ability for
the purpose of establishing the time and manner of payment. 
. . . .
 Restitution serves two purposes: (1) to repay crime victims
for financial losses they have suffered as a result of
crimes, and (2) to help rehabilitate offenders by requiring
them to take responsibility for the consequences of their
actions.  In 1975, the Legislature empowered courts to order
a convicted person to pay restitution.  The committee report
 accompanying the bill stated:
 
Reparation and/or restitution by wrongdoers to their victims
is basic to justice and fair play.  The penal system should
 not be excluded from this concept.  Your Committee believes
 that by imposing the requirement that criminal repay not
only “society” but the persons injured by the criminal’s
acts, society benefits not once, but twice.  The victim of
 the crime not only receives reparation and restitution, but
the criminal should develop or regain a degree of self
respect and pride in knowing that he or she righted, to as
great a degree as possible, the wrong that he or she had
committed.  S.C. Rep. No. 425, 1975 House Journal at 1148.
 
The restorative justice envisioned by the Legislature in
enacting restitution laws has not been fully realized. 
Under current law, courts cannot impose restitution unless
they determine that the offender can afford to pay it. This
 
determination is difficult to make at sentencing because
accurate information regarding the offender’s true financial
status is often unavailable and the offender’s future
 earnings capacity is often unclear.
 
The proposed amendments would create a restitution system
similar to the federal Mandatory Victims Restitution Act
(MVRA), 18 U.S.C. §[sic]3663A-3664.  Courts imposing
restitution pursuant to the MVRA must order full restitution
without consideration for the defendant’s economic
 circumstances, but they are directed to consider the
defendant’s ability to pay in establishing a restitution
payment schedule.
 
Penal Code Review Committee, Final Report 27j (2005) (emphasis
 
added). Thus, the 2006 amendments removed a judge’s discretion
 to award restitution, and made restitution mandatory for
 “reasonable and verified” losses requested by a crime victim. 
The Penal Code Review Committee report makes it clear
 
18
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that the amendments were intended to require “full restitution
 
for reasonable and verified losses,” and to “create a restitution
 system similar to the federal Mandatory Victims Restitution Act
 (MVRA), 18 U.S.C. §§ 3663A to 3664.” Id. at 27j-k. Section 3663
 
of the MVRA provides in pertinent part, as it did in 2006 and
 2012 at the time of this sentencing:
 
(b) The order of restitution shall require that such
defendant–
 
. . . .
 (2) in the case of an offense resulting in bodily injury to
a victim–
 
(A) pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary medical and
related professional services and devices relating to
physical, psychiatric, and psychological care, including
nonmedical care and treatment rendered in accordance with a
 method of healing recognized by the law of the place of
treatment;
 
(B) pay an amount equal to the cost of necessary physical
and occupational therapy and rehabilitation; and
 
(C) reimburse the victim for income lost by such victim as a
result of such offense;
 
(Emphasis added). The proposed amendments to HRS § 706-646 of
 
the Penal Code Review Committee were adopted without change by
 the Legislature. Thus, whatever the 1998 Legislature may have
 said, in accordance with the clear language of the statute as of
 2006, reasonable and verified lost wages are to be included in a
 restitution award.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate in part the ICA’s
 
November 18, 2013 Judgment on Appeal, affirm the district court’s
 
19
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
order of restitution as it relates to lost wages in the amount of
 
$1,155.00, and remand to the district court for further
 proceedings consistent with this opinion and the remainder of the
 ICA’s opinion.

 The dissent asserts: “In this case, a court would have to
 
determine whether [the CW] incurred the same chair rent and business costs
during the time she could not work.  Presumably, [the CW] would not have
incurred her ordinary inventory costs, and an order of restitution based on
gross receipts, instead of net income, would seemingly not represent her
actual loss.”  Although this might be true in future cases, DeMello waived
these arguments by failing to raise them before the district court and the
ICA.
