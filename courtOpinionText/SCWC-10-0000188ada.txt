RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, ACOBA, MCKENNA, AND POLLACK, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY ACOBA, J. 
We hold first, that, Hawai
'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 
2
658A-28(a) (Supp. 2005),  which enumerates the appeals that “may”
1
 CAAP-11-0000019 was consolidated with CAAP-10-0000188 on November
 
23, 2011.
 
2 HRS § 658A-28 provides as follows:
 
§ 658A-28 Appeals.
(a) An appeal may be taken from :
 
(1) An order denying a motion to compel arbitration ;
 
(2) An order granting a motion to stay arbitration;
 
(3) An order confirming or denying confirmation of an
 
award;
 
(4) A
n order modifying or correcting an award;
 
2
         
        
 
        
         
         
 
        
          
         
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
be taken from a court order concerning an arbitration proceeding, 
does not represent an exclusive list of appealable orders. Thus, although not listed in HRS § 658A-28(a), the order compelling arbitration in the instant case, is sufficiently “final” under our collateral order doctrine to be appealable under the general civil matters appeal statute, HRS § 641-1 (Supp. 2005).
3 We 
therefore affirm the similar conclusion in the October 17, 2011 Order of the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) Denying [the] September 19, 2011 Motion to Dismiss Appeal for Lack of Jurisdiction filed by Petitioners/Defendants-Appellees UniDev, LLC (UniDev) and UniDev Hawai' i, LLC (UniDev Hawai 'i) 
(collectively, Petitioners). Second, we hold that under the circumstances of this case, the scope of the arbitration clause contained in the “Development Services Agreement” (DSA) between Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellant County of Hawai' i (Respondent) and 
UniDev encompassed all claims of Respondent and the counterclaims of Petitioners. To the extent that the ICA held otherwise, the ICA’s August 31, 2012 opinion and October 18, 2012 judgment on 
(5) An order vacating an award without directing a
rehearing; or
 
(6) A final judgment entered pursuant to this chapter.
 
(b) An appeal under this section shall be taken as
from an order or a judgment in a civil action.
 
(Emphases added.)
 
3
 HRS § 641-1 provides in relevant part as follows:
 
(a) Appeals shall be allowed in civil matters from all final
judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and district courts and
the land court to the intermediate appellate court, subject to
chapter 602.

appeal are vacated. The December 17, 2010 Order Granting
 
Counterclaimant [UniDev’s] Motion to Compel Alternative Dispute
 Resolution and to Stay Proceedings, and the January 3, 2011
 Amended Order Granting Counterclaimant [UniDev’s] Motion to
 Compel Alternative Dispute Resolution and to Stay Proceedings of
 
4
the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit  (the court) are affirmed. 
This case is remanded to the court for further proceedings
 consistent with this opinion.
 
I. 
A.
 
In April 2005, Respondent awarded UniDev a contract to 
develop an affordable housing development project (the Project) in Waikoloa Village on the island of Hawai' i.
5 On March 2, 2006, 
the parties entered into the DSA. Under the DSA, UniDev agreed to construct “approximately 800 to 1,200” housing units in the Waikoloa area. Respondent initially owned the 288 acres of land that UniDev agreed to develop. However, pursuant to the DSA, Respondent would “transfer title to the [Property] to a to-be­formed non-profit entity,” and Respondent would “assign all of its rights and obligations in and under [the DSA] to [that non­profit entity].” 
The DSA also contained a provision regarding
 
alternative dispute resolution. The parties agreed that if

 The Honorable Elizabeth A. Strance presided.

 The ICA’s decision in this case consolidated two cases, CAAP-10­
0000188 and CAAP-11-0000019.
 
4
         
         
         
     
         
       
       
        
         
          
        
         
         
        
       ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
mediation of a dispute was not successful, the parties would
 
proceed to arbitration under state law:
 
Any dispute arising under the terms of this Agreement that
is not resolved within a reasonable period of time by
authorized representatives of [UniDev] and [Respondent]
shall be brought to the attention of the Chief Executive
Officer of [UniDev] and the Executive Director of
[Respondent] for joint resolution. Thereafter, if the
matter in dispute is still unresolved, then the parties
shall in good faith mutually appoint a mediator to mediate
the dispute, provided that if the parties cannot agree to a
mediator, then either party may petition a court of
competent jurisdiction to appoint a mediator. If the matter
 
in dispute is still not resolved by mediation, then the
parties shall submit the matter to arbitration as provided
in the “Uniform Arbitration Act” under State law .
 
(Emphases added.) 
As anticipated under the DSA, Respondent transferred 
title to the Property to Hawai' i Island Housing Trust (HIHT), 
which subsequently leased the Property to Waikoloa Workforce 
Housing, LLC (WWH). Respondent, HIHT, and WWH signed a “Development Agreement,” which provided, in part, that HIHT and WWH would develop the Project according to Respondent’s requirements. Failure to do so would result in reversion of the Property to Respondent. Respondent then entered into an “Assignment and Assumption Agreement” (Assignment Agreement) with WWH, which stated in relevant part that Respondent “assigns unto [WWH] all right, title, and interest of [Respondent] in . . . [the DSA].” 
On February 21, 2008, UniDev and WWH entered into an
 
“Amended and Restated Development Services Agreement” (ADSA). 
UniDev and WWH “wish[ed] to amend the DSA to reflect certain
 changes in facts and circumstances that [had] occurred since the
 
5
         
 
        
        
   
          
       
  
           
          
          
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
DSA was first executed by [UniDev] and [Respondent].” Although
 
the ADSA altered some aspects of the original agreement such as
 UniDev’s compensation, the provision relating to alternative
 dispute resolution remained largely unchanged. 
On April 19, 2009, WWH instructed UniDev to cease all
 
work on the project. The Property was subsequently returned to
 Respondent.
 
B.
 
Following UniDev’s termination from the Project,
 
Respondent filed a Complaint on July 1, 2009 with the court. The
 case initiated by the Complaint was designated Civil No. 09-01­264K. The Complaint asserted five causes of action, including
 (1) false claims, in violation of HRS § 46-171 (Supp. 2001),
6
 
(2) intentional misrepresentation, (3) fraudulent inducement, 
(4) negligent misrepresentation, and (5) negligence. 
On March 29, 2010, Petitioners answered Respondent’s
 
Complaint and filed a counterclaim against Respondent, HIHT, and
 WWH. Petitioners’ counterclaim asserted four counts, including
 (1) breach of contract (against Respondent and WWH), (2) quantum
 
6	 HRS § 46-171 provides, in relevant part as follows:
 
§ 46-171 Actions for false claims to the
 
counties; qui tam actions .
 
(a) Any person who:
(1)	 Knowingly presents, or causes to be
presented, a false or fraudulent claim for
payment or approval;
 
. . . .

 
shall be liable to the county for a civil penalty of not
less than $5,500 and not more than $11,000, plus three times
the amount of damages that the county sustains due to the
act of that person.
 
6
         
        
        
(12)	  Engages  in  any  other  conduct  which
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
meruit (against Respondent and WWH), (3) intentional interference
 
with contract (against Respondent), and (4) fraudulent transfer
 (against HIHT and Respondent).
 
On November 23, 2010, Respondent filed a second
 
Complaint, initiating a second action against Petitioners, Civil
 No. 10-1-0427K. Respondent reiterated four of the five causes of
 action included in its original Complaint. Respondent again
 alleged causes of action for false claims pursuant to HRS § 46­171 (Count I), intentional misrepresentation (Count III),
 fraudulent inducement (Count IV), and negligent misrepresentation
 (Count V). Regarding all four causes of action, the second
 Complaint identified particular circumstances that constituted
 the bases of Respondent’s allegations. Respondent also alleged a
 new cause of action for unfair and deceptive practices (Count
 
7
II), declaring that Petitioners violated HRS §§ 480-2 (1993)  and
481A-3 (1993) by engaging in several acts.
8 On December 16,
 
7	 HRS § 480-2 provides in relevant part as follows:
 
§  480-2   Unfair  competition,  practices,  declared  unlawful.
(a)  Unfair  methods  of  competition  and  unfair  or  deceptive
acts  or  practices  in  the  conduct  of  any  trade  or  commerce
are  unlawful.
 
8	 HRS § 481A-3 provides in relevant part as follows:
 
§  481A-3   Deceptive  trade  practices .
 
(a)  A  person  engages  in  a  deceptive  trade  practice  when,  in
the  course  of  the  person’s  business,  vocation,  or
occupation,  the  person:
(1)	  Passes  off  goods  or  services  as  those  of
 
another;
 
(2)	  Causes  likelihood  of  confusion  or  of
  
misunderstanding  as  to  the  source,  sponsorship,
  
approval,  or  certification  of  goods  or  services;
 
. . .

2010, the parties stipulated to consolidate Civil No. 09-01-264K
 
with Civil No. 10-1-0427K.9
 
C.
 
On July 30, 2010, Petitioners filed their arbitration
 
motion. On December 17, 2010, the court issued an Order granting
 the motion. The Order stated in relevant part as follows:
 
1.	 [Petitioners] ha[ve] established the existence of a
written agreement that requires [Respondent] and
[Petitioners] to resolve disputes by means of
alternative dispute resolution. Specifically, Section
13 of Rider A of the [DSA] and Section 13 of Rider A
of the [ADSA] both require the parties to resolve “any
 dispute arising under the terms of this Agreement”
through the alternative dispute resolution process
described therein. [Respondent] concedes that it
validly executed the DSA, and as to the alternative
dispute resolution provisions, the ADSA simply
restates the DSA.
 
2.	 [Respondent’s] claims fall within the scope of the
alternative dispute resolution clause . . . .
Alternative dispute resolution clauses must be broadly
construed, and those covering claims “arising out of”
the agreement have been held to require alternative
dispute resolution of fraud-based claims concerning
the subject matter of the agreement, as do
[Respondent’s] claims.
 
3.	 [Petitioners’] counterclaims against [Respondent] are
also subject to the alternative dispute resolution
provisions of the DSA and the ADSA, as [Petitioners]
stated at the hearing. Some of the counterclaims are
 
expressly based on the DSA and the ADSA, and others
touch matters concerning the DSA and ADSA or arise out
of the relationship between the parties created by
those contracts.
 
(Emphases added.)
 
similarly creates a likelihood of
confusion or of misunderstanding.
 
9
 Petitioners did not file an answer or counterclaims to the second
 
complaint, apparently because the court’s December 17, 2010 Order granting
Petitioner’s Motion to Compel Alternative Dispute Resolution (arbitration
motion) stayed “all proceedings in this court.”
 
8
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
II.
 
A.
 
Respondent appealed to the ICA. After the parties had 
filed briefs on the merits, Petitioners filed a Motion to Dismiss 
on September 19, 2011, arguing that the ICA lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the “appeal of an interlocutory order compelling arbitration is forbidden by the [Federal Arbitration Act (FAA)].” Petitioners acknowledged that “Hawai' i law allows 
appeals from interlocutory orders compelling arbitration under the collateral order doctrine when the issue of arbitrability is separable from and collateral to the claims asserted in the underlying case.” (Citing Sher v. Cella, 114 Hawai' i 263, 266­
67, 160 P.3d 1250, 1253-54 (App. 2007).) However, according to Petitioners, “in disputes covered by the FAA -- such as this one -- that rule cannot apply.” 
In opposition, Respondent cited Volt Info. Scis., Inc.
 
v. Bd. of Trs., 489 U.S. 468, 479 (1989), for the proposition that “where, as here, the parties have agreed to abide by state rules of arbitration, enforcing those rules according to the terms of the agreement is fully consistent with the goals of the FAA, even if the result is that arbitration is stayed where the act would otherwise permit it to go forward.” (Emphasis in original.) Respondent noted that the arbitration clauses in both the DSA and ADSA explicitly stated that Hawai' i law applied; 
that, as Petitioners stated in their Answering Brief, “an 
9
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
immediate appeal of the order compelling arbitration is permitted 
under Hawai' i law;” and therefore, that the ICA had jurisdiction 
to hear the appeal. 
On October 17, 2011, the ICA denied Petitioners’ Motion 
to Dismiss. County of Hawai' i v. Unidev LLC, No. CAAP-11­
0000019, 2011 WL 4998491, at *1 (App. Oct. 17, 2011) (Unidev I). The ICA related that under the FAA, “the courts and arbitrators must give effect to the contractual rights of the parties, that the parties’ intentions control, that the parties may limit the issues that they choose to arbitrate, and that ‘parties may agree on rules under which any arbitration will proceed.’” Id. at *3 
(quoting Stolt-Nielsen, S.A. v. Animalfeeds Int’l Corp., 559 U.S. 662, 130 S. Ct. 1758, 1774 (2010)) (emphasis in original). “Under Hawai' i state law, an order compelling arbitration is 
appealable under HRS § 641-1(a) [(Supp. 2004)] and the collateral order doctrine.” Id. at *4 (citing Sher, 114 Hawai' i at 266-67, 
160 P.3d at 1253-54; Association of Owners of Kukui Plaza v. Swinerton & Walberg Co., 68 Haw. 98, 107, 705 P.2d 28, 35 (1985); Luke v. Gentry Realty, Ltd., 105 Hawai' i 241, 246 n. 10, 96 P.3d 
261, 266 n.10 (2004); Douglass v. Pflueger Hawai' i Inc., 110 
Hawai'i 520, 522 n.1, 135 P.3d 129, 131 n.1 (2006)). 
Consequently, the ICA decided that it “ha[d] jurisdiction over [Respondent’s] appeal from the December 17, 2010 order compelling alternative dispute resolution and the January 3, 2011 amended order compelling alternative dispute resolution.” Id.

              ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
B.
 
On May 25, 2011, Respondent filed its Opening Brief
 
(OB) with the ICA. In pertinent part, Respondent argued (1) that
 
it was not “required to arbitrate pursuant to the DSA [or] the
 ASDA,” and (2) that its claims were not subject to arbitration.
10
 
Petitioners filed an Answering Brief (AB) on August 4, 2011. 
Respondent filed a Reply Brief on August 24, 2011.
 
1.
 
As to its first argument, Respondent contended that
 
“the assignment of the DSA to WWH constituted a novation;” “the
 ADSA [thus] replaced the DSA” and as a result, “the DSA was
 discharged and [Petitioners could] not enforce the arbitration
 provision of the DSA against [Respondent].” Also, Respondent
 asserted that Respondent was not a party to the ADSA, and
 moreover WWH was not its agent when WWH entered into the ADSA
 because WWH possessed neither actual authority nor apparent
 authority to enter into the ADSA on its behalf.
 
Petitioners responded in their Answering Brief that the
 
Assignment Agreement was an assignment, and not a novation, and
 as such, did not relieve Respondent from its duties under the
 DSA;
11 the ADSA did not constitute a substituted contract because
 
10
 Respondent also argued that Petitioners waived their right to 
request arbitration. The ICA held that Petitioners did not waive their 
arbitration rights, and neither party has challenged that holding. County of 
Hawai'i v. Unidev LLC , 128 Hawai 'i 378, 405, 289 P.3d 1014, 1041 (App. 2012) 
(Unidev II ). 
11
 As noted by the ICA, for the Assignment Agreement to have been a 
novation, rather than an assignment, “Unidev must have agreed to the discharge
of [Respondent’s] duties under the DSA.” Unidev II , 128 Hawai 'i at 396, 289 
11
         
            
            
          ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the DSA itself contemplated amendment in that it stated “this
 
Agreement shall remain in force with the inclusion of any such
 amendment”; and Respondent was bound under the ADSA’s arbitration
 clause, despite not signing the ADSA, because Respondent
 “affirmed WWH’s conduct and ratified the ADSA,” and because
 Respondent “originally empowered WWH to act on its behalf.”
 
2.
 
As to its second argument, Respondent pointed out that 
the arbitration clauses in the DSA and ADSA required arbitration for “any dispute arising under the terms of this Agreement,” and that “[c]ourts in the Ninth Circuit and Hawai' i have held [that] 
similar language is ‘relatively narrow,’ and only mandates arbitration of claims which related to the interpretation of the contract and matters of performance.” (Citing Cape Flattery Ltd. v. Titan Maritime LLC, 607 F. Supp 2d 1179 (D. Haw. 2009);
 Mediterranean Enterprises, Inc. v. Ssangyong Corp., 708 F.2d 1458
 (9th Cir. 1983); Tracer Research Corp. v. National Envtl. Servs.
 Co., 42 F.3d 1292, 1295 (9th Cir. 1994).) 
Next, Respondent asserted that its claims were not
 
based on Petitioners breaching either the DSA or ADSA, but
 instead, on Petitioners making fraudulent misrepresentations. 
Thus, its claims were “clearly actionable regardless of the
 existence of the DSA or ADSA,” inasmuch as “the claims asserted
 
P.3d at 1032 (emphasis in original); see also Hawai 'i Builders Supply Co. v.
Kaneta, 42 Haw. 111, 112 (Haw. Terr. 1957) (“[A] discharge of a previous
contractual duty is one of the essential elements of a novation.”). 
12
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
by [Respondent] are clearly tort claims, and, as a result, d[id]
 
not arise under the DSA or ADSA . . . .” Finally, Respondent
 declared that Petitioners’ counterclaims were not subject to
 arbitration, because those “claims necessarily rely upon
 [Respondent] not being a party to the DSA or ADSA” and,
 therefore, none of Petitioners’ four counterclaims “arose under
 the terms of the Agreement.”
 
In their Answering Brief, Petitioners responded that
 
Respondent’s claims fell within the scope of both arbitration
 clauses; for clauses that require the party to arbitrate “any
 dispute arising under the terms of this Agreement” have been
 consistently construed as “broad.” Thus, Petitioners asserted
 that the arbitration clauses in the DSA and ADSA covered any
 claims that “touch matters covered by the parties’ contract” or
 that “have their roots in the relationship created by the
 contract.” (Citing PRM Energy Sys., Inc., v. Primenergy, L.L.C.,
 592 F.3d 830, 836-37 (8th Cir. 2010); Int’l Asset Mgmt., Inc. v.
 Holt, 487 F. Supp. 2d 1274, 1288 (N.D. Okla. 2007).) According
 to Petitioners, the cases cited by Respondent represented “‘a
 distinct minority analysis,’” (quoting EFund Capital Partners v.
 Pless, 59 Cal. Rptr. 3d 340, 341 (Cal. App. 2007)), that the
 “majority of federal courts have ‘declined to follow.’” (Quoting
 Battaglia v. McKendry, 233 F.3d 720, 727 (3d Cir. 2000).) 
Additionally, Petitioners maintained that Respondent’s
 
causes of action fell within the arbitration clauses because
 
13
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
either they “require[d] interpretation of [] the DSA and [ADSA]”
 
or because the claims would not have occurred “unless the DSA and
 [ADSA] existed.” Regarding Petitioners’ counterclaims,
 Petitioners claimed that their “relationship with [Respondent]
 arises out of[,] and would not have existed without the DSA.” 
“Thus,” Petitioners urged, “any claims related to that
 relationship arise out of and are related to the DSA.” 
III.
 
A.
 
The ICA held, regarding Respondent’s first argument, 
that Respondent was bound by the DSA, but not the ADSA. As to the DSA, the ICA ruled that because neither the Assignment Agreement nor the ADSA was a novation with regard to the DSA, Petitioners did not agree to the discharge of Respondent’s duties under the DSA in either document. Unidev II, 128 Hawai' i at 396, 
289 P.3d at 1032. Therefore, the ICA concluded that Respondent was bound by the DSA’s arbitration provision. Id. 
However, with respect to the ADSA, the ICA decided that
 
Respondent “was not a signatory” and Respondent neither gave WWH
 the authority to bind it to the ADSA nor ratified the ADSA. Id.
 
at 397-98, 289 P.3d at 1033-34. Therefore, the ICA concluded
 that the court “erred in determining that the ADSA arbitration
 agreement applies to [Respondent].” Id.
 
B.
 
Regarding Respondent’s second argument, the ICA
 
14
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
analyzed each cause of action alleged in the complaints and the 
counterclaims. The ICA observed that a split in authority existed as to whether clauses that mandated arbitration for disputes “arising under” or “arising out of” an agreement were broad or narrow. Id. at 399, 289 P.3d at 1035. However, the ICA 
did “not decide that particular issue because the arbitration provision ha[d] further limiting language,” specifically that arbitration was mandatory for disputes “arising under the terms of the agreement.” Id. (emphasis in original). According to the 
ICA, “[e]ven though public policy strongly favors arbitration, the scope of arbitration ultimately depends on the wording of the contract.” Id. (citing Hawai' i Med. Ass’n v. Hawai' i Med. Serv. 
Ass’n, 113 Hawai' i 77, 92, 148 P.3d 1179, 1194 (2006)). 
The ICA explained that “[b]y choosing the specific and
 
clear language in the DSA arbitration provision, the parties
 indicated their intent to require arbitration when a dispute
 implicates or involves the terms of the DSA.” Id. (emphasis
 
added). Hence, “arbitration [was] required for claims that
 involve construction or interpretation of the DSA’s terms, or
 that require a determination of the parties’ rights and/or
 obligations under the terms of the DSA.” Id. Applying its
 
interpretation of the DSA’s arbitration clause, the ICA held that
 Respondent’s negligence claim in its first complaint was subject

 breach of contract “to the extent [that it alleged] that

[Respondent] breached the DSA.” Id. However, the remainder of
 
Respondent’s claims and Petitioners’ counterclaims did not
 
“involve the terms of the DSA,” and therefore were not within the
 scope of the DSA’s arbitration clause. Id.

In their Application, Petitioners ask (1) whether this
 
court’s decision in Swinerton was “nullified by the adoption of
 the [Revised Uniform Arbitration Act (RUAA)], (2) whether the ICA
 erred by “adopting the minority view regarding [the] ‘arising
 under’ language” in the arbitration provisions and “drastically
 narrow[ing] the scope of the parties’ arbitrable claims,” and (3)
 whether it was grave error to exclude Respondent’s claims and
 Petitioners’ counterclaims from arbitration. Respondent filed a
 Response on December 31, 2012. Petitioners filed a Reply on
 January 7, 2012.
 
V.
 
As an initial matter, neither party challenges the 
ICA’s conclusion that Respondent is bound by the arbitration clause of the DSA. Unidev II, 128 Hawai' i at 396, 289 P.3d at 
1032. Therefore, Respondent is bound by the arbitration clause in the DSA.
12 
12
 Respondent did object to the ICA’s holding regarding the DSA at 
oral argument. However, Respondent did not cross-appeal the holding of the
ICA or raise this issue in its Response. Thus, it has been waived. See 
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40.1. In any event, it
appears that the ICA correctly rejected Respondent’s arguments that neitherthe Assignment Agreement nor the ADSA effected a novation and dischargedRespondent’s obligations under the DSA. As the ICA recognized, Petitioners’assent to the discharge of Respondent’s duties under the DSA was required toeffectuate a novation. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 280 cmt. d (“For a

   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Petitioners argue that the ICA erred by holding that
 
Respondent was not bound by the arbitration provision in the
 
ADSA, because the ICA allowed “[Respondent] to use the ADSA as
 both a sword and shield.”
13 Respondent is “bound to arbitrate,”
 
Petitioners urge, because its claims “allege breaches under the
 ADSA and therefore arise under . . . the ADSA.”
14 This argument,
 
however, is unrelated to any of the questions presented for
 decision by Petitioners. The first question presented, regarding
 the ICA’s jurisdiction, does not address the ADSA at all. The
 second and third questions presented, regarding the ICA’s
 interpretation of the scope of the arbitration agreement, also
 apparently do not address the ADSA, because the ICA held that
 
novation to take place, the obligee must assent to the discharge of the
obligor’s duty in consideration for the promise of the third party to
undertake that duty.”) (emphasis added); see also Hawai 'i Builders Supply Co.
v. Kaneta, 42 Haw. 111 (Haw. Terr. 1957) (“[D]ischarge of a previous
contractual duty is one of the essential elements of a novation.”). The ICA
 
observed nothing in the record that indicated Petitioners agreed to discharge
Respondent from its duties under the DSA.
 
13 Petitioners’ Application does not explain why the question of 
whether or not Respondent is bound by the ADSA is relevant to the ultimatedisposition of the case. Whether Petitioners are bound by the arbitrationclause in the ADSA may have been relevant under the ICA’s holding thatarbitration clauses in the DSA and ADSA extend only to claims requiring“construction or interpretation” of the terms of those agreements. Unidev II ,
127 Hawai 'i at 399, 289 P.3d at 1035. Presumably, some of Respondent’s claims 
and Petitioners’ counterclaims may have implicated the terms of the ADSA, but not the DSA. Therefore, under the ICA’s interpretation of the scope of thearbitration clauses in the DSA and ADSA, some claims may have been subject toarbitration only if the Respondent was subject to the ADSA. However, asdiscussed infra, the ICA erred regarding the scope of the arbitration clausesin the DSA and ADSA. 
14
 Petitioners point to Count 1 of Respondent’s first complaint,
 
which alleged that Petitioners submitted to Respondent invoices that
Respondent was not contractually obligated to pay, and even if Respondent was
obligated to pay, those invoices “request payment for amounts that even under
the ADSA . . . would not be due to [Petitioners].” (Emphasis added.)
 
Petitioners claim that this citation to the ADSA “requires interpretation of
 the ADSA’s payment provisions.”
 
17
         
             
           
             
            
      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
only the DSA applied to Respondent, and therefore the ICA did not 
address the ADSA’s scope at all. See Unidev II, 128 Hawai' i at 
398, 289 P.3d at 1034 (“We now consider whether the scope of the DSA’s arbitration provision covers the claims and counterclaims asserted by the parties.”) (emphasis added). Pursuant to HRAP Rule 40.1 (d)(1), “[t]he application for a writ of certiorari shall contain . . . a short and concise statement of the questions presented for decision,” and “[q]uestions not presented according to this paragraph will be disregarded.” Petitioners’ argument regarding the applicability of the ADSA is unrelated to any of the questions presented. Hence, under Rule 40.1(d)(1) Petitioners’ arguments are disregarded. The ICA’s holding that Respondent is not bound by the ADSA is affirmed. 
Further, Petitioners did not argue below that
 
Respondent was bound by the arbitration clause in the ADSA. At
 oral argument, Petitioners contended that they “raised the
 ratification argument” at every stage of the proceedings. To the
 contrary, before the court and before the ICA, Petitioners argued
 that by asserting claims under the ADSA, Respondent ratified
 WWH’s signing of the ADSA as a part of an agency theory. All of
 the cases cited by Petitioner related to agency status.
15 The 
15 See, e.g. , Hawai'i County v. Purdy , 22 Haw. 272, 283 (Haw. Terr. 
1914) (“A municipal corporation may ratify the unauthorized acts of its agents
or officers . . . .”) (emphasis added); Ass’n of Apartment Owners of Maalaea
Kai, Inc. v. Stillson , 108 Hawai 'i 2, 30, 116 P.3d 644, 672 (2005)
(“Ratification rests on principles of agency.”). 
18
         
            
            
        
            
          
            
            
           ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
ICA rejected Petitioners’ ratification argument because 
Petitioners could not demonstrate “that WWH entered into the ADSA on behalf of Respondent.” Unidev II, 128 Hawai' i at 397, 289 
P.3d at 1034; see also Stillson, 108 Hawai' i at 30, 116 P.3d at 
672 (noting that ratification is defined as “the affirmance by a person of a prior act which did not bind him but which was done or professedly done on his account”) (emphasis added). 
Before this court, Petitioners did not challenge the 
ICA’s determination that Petitioners could not prove that WWH was acting on behalf of Respondent. Instead, Petitioners cited cases that suggested Respondent was bound by the ADSA’s arbitration clause solely because Respondent asserted claims under the ADSA. The analysis in the cases cited does not utilize an agency theory, but instead one of estoppel.
16 Thus, Petitioners raise 
their estoppel theory for the first time before this court. It is axiomatic that where a party fails to raise an argument before the courts below, that argument may be deemed waived for purposes of appeal. State v. Moses, 102 Hawai' i 449, 456, 77 P.3d 940, 
947 (2003). Hence, we consider Petitioners’ estoppel argument waived. 
16 See, e.g. , Boucher v. Alliance Title Company, Inc. , 127 Cal. Rptr.
 
3d 440, 44 (Ct. App. 2005) (“Here, defendant relies only on equitable estoppel
principles.”)(emphasis added); Int’l Ins. Agency Services, LLC v. Revios
Reins. U.S., Inc. , 2007 WL 951943 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 27, 2007) (“Because it
proves to be dispositive, the court considers only the estoppel theory.”)
(emphasis added). Estoppel and agency are two different theories which may
be used to bind a non-signatory to an arbitration agreement. See Thomson-CSF,
S.A. v. American Arbitration Ass’n , 64 F.3d 773, 776 (2d Cir. 1195).

VI.
 
A.
 
As to the first Application question, Petitioners 
contend, contrary to their position before the ICA, that Hawai' i 
law does not permit interlocutory appeals from orders compelling 
arbitration. According to Petitioners, this court’s decision in Swinerton, 68 Haw. at 107, 705 P.2d at 34, which allowed interlocutory appeals from orders denying and compelling arbitration, is no longer applicable in light of the adoption of the RUAA. 
Petitioners maintain that at the time Swinerton was 
decided, Hawai' i’s arbitration statute was “silent with regard to 
appeals of orders concerning arbitration.” Thus, “the Swinerton decision properly turned upon general principles of appealability.” Petitioners read Swinerton as holding that under the “collateral order doctrine,”
17 the Hawai' i general appeals 
18
 , allowed “interlocutory appeals
 statute, HRS § 641-1(a) (1993) 
17 The collateral order doctrine allows appeals from orders “falling
 
in that small class which finally determine claims of right separable from,
and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied
review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate
consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.” Swinerton , 68
 
Haw. at 105, 705 P.2d at 35 (citations omitted).
 
18
 At the time of Swinerton , HRS § 641-1(a) (1985 Repl.) provided as
 
follows:
 
(a) Appeals shall be allowed in civil matters from all
final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and district
courts and the land court, to the supreme court or to the
intermediate appellate court, except as otherwise provided
by law and subject to the authority of the intermediate
appellate court to certify reassignment of a matter directly
to the supreme court and subject to the authority of the
supreme court to reassign a matter to itself from the
 
20
         
  
 
         
        
        
    
 
         
           
            
               
          
              
            ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
from orders denying arbitration as well as orders compelling
 
arbitration.” (Citing Swinerton, 68 Haw. at 107, 705 P.2d at
 35.)
 
Petitioners state, however, that “fifteen years after 
Swinerton, the Hawai' i legislature adopted the RUAA,” and under 
the RUAA, “HRS § 658A-[2]8 permits appeals of orders denying arbitration,” but “does not authorize appeals challenging orders compelling arbitration.”
19 (Emphases in original.) That 
“omission is significant,” according to Petitioners, “for ‘this court has consistently applied the rule of expressio unius est exclusio alterius -- the express inclusion of a provision in a statute implies the exclusion of another -- in interpreting statutes.’” (Quoting Fought & Co. v. Steel Eng’g, 87 Hawai' i 37, 
55, 951 P.3d 487, 505 (1998).) (Brackets omitted.) Therefore “it would be contrary to the canons of interpretation to read the grant of appellate jurisdiction in one instance but not the other 
intermediate appellate court.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
HRS  §  641-1(a)  was  subsequently  amended  to  require  that  appeals  be
heard  by  the  ICA.   To  reiterate,  HRS  §  641-1(a)  now  provides  as  follows:
 
(a) Appeals shall be allowed in civil matters from all
final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and district
courts and the land court to the intermediate appellate
court, subject to chapter 602.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
19
 Petitioners acknowledge that twice since the adoption of the RUAA, 
this court has restated its holding in Swinerton that appeals are allowable
under the collateral order doctrine. (Citing Luke, 105 Hawai 'i at 246, 96 
P.3d at 266 n.10; Douglass , 110 Hawai 'i at 522, 135 P.3d at 131 n.1 (2006).)
However, Petitioners explain that the RUAA, which applies only to contractsmade “on or after July 1, 2002,” HRS § 658A-3 (Supp. 2011), did not governthose cases because the contracts at issue were entered into prior to 2002. 
21
         
     
      
          
        
         
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
as granting appellate jurisdiction in both.” Additionally, 
Petitioners declare that “upholding Swinerton would [] contravene the legislature’s intent since it is presumed to have known of [this c]ourt’s decision in Swinerton when it decided to grant appellate jurisdiction only as to orders denying arbitration.” (Citing State v. Reis, 115 Hawai' i 79, 97, 165 P.3d 980, 998 
(2007).) (Emphases in original.) 
Also, Petitioners assert that the majority of
 
jurisdictions adopting the RUAA do not allow appeals from orders
 compelling arbitration. Hence, this court must “interpret and
 construe the RUAA as to effectuate [the RUAA’s] general purpose
 to make uniform the laws of the states and territories which
 enacted [it].” (Citing HRS § 1-24 (Repl. 2003).)
20 Finally,
 
Petitioners maintain that allowing appeals from orders compelling
 arbitration will “encourage[] delays, add[] costs, and wast[e]
 judicial resources and the parties resources.”
 
B.
 1.
 
Respondent responds first, that Petitioners have waived 
the argument that Hawai' i law forbids appealing orders that 
compel arbitration, by not raising that issue before the ICA. “It is well established,” Respondent maintains, “that an issue 
20
 HRS § 1-24 provides as follows:
 
§ 1-24 Interpretation of uniform acts.
All provisions of uniform acts adopted by the State shall be
so interpreted and construed as to effectuate their general
purpose to make uniform the laws of the states and
territories which enact them.
 
22
         
        
        
     
        
       
        
         
       
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered by the 
reviewing court.” (Citing State v. Schnabel, 127 Hawai' i 432, 
478-79, 279 P.3d 1237, 1283-84 (2012); State v. Wallace, 80 Hawai'i 382, 410, 910 P.2d 695, 723 (1996).) According to 
Respondent, because Petitioners asserted before the ICA that Hawai'i law did permit an appeal, “[Petitioners] argued the 
opposite of what [they] now argue.” Thus, inasmuch as HRS § 602­59
21 only allows this court to review “clearly wrong” decisions 
by the ICA, and “the ICA never decided this issue . . . there is nothing for this [c]ourt to correct.” Further, Respondent declares that if it must proceed through arbitration and subsequently appeal the court’s ruling compelling arbitration, “[t]he ICA would then render the same decision” regarding the merits of the claims, resulting in “meaningless duplication and wasteful actions.” 
2.
 
In answer to Petitioners’ position that the RUAA
 
supplants this court’s decision in Swinerton, Respondent posits
 that “HRS § 641-1(a) provides additional authority for appeals.” 
Respondent cites the ICA’s decision in Picardy v. Sky River
 
21 HRS § 602-59 provides in relevant part as follows:
 
(b) The application for writ of certiorari shall tersely
state its grounds, which shall include:
(1) Grave errors of law or of fact; or
(2) Obvious inconsistencies in the decision of the
intermediate appellate court with that of the supreme court,
federal decisions, or its own decision, and the magnitude of
those errors or inconsistencies dictating the need for
further appeal.

22
 (order),  in which the defendant moved to dismiss an appeal from
an order compelling arbitration, arguing that “HRS § 658A-28 did
 
not permit an appeal [from such] an order. . . .” 
The ICA,
 
however, ruled that “HRS § 641-1(a) provides 
additional authority
 
for appeals and authorizes appeals from judgments, orders, or
 decrees.” (Citing Picardy, 2009 WL 4988294 at *1.) (Emphasis
 added.) Applying this court’s decision in Swinerton, the ICA
 held that “orders granting stays of arbitration are appealable
 final orders.” (Citing Picardy, 2009 WL 4988294 at *2.)
 
Relying on Picardy, Respondent contends that “several
 
other jurisdictions [] have noted [that] similar statutes . . .
 do not represent an exclusive list of appealable orders.”
23
 
Those jurisdictions recognize that “permitting appeals of orders
 compelling arbitration is logical and just since ‘these claims
 cannot be effectively vindicated after the party has been
 compell[ed] to do that which it claims it is not required to
 do.’” (Citing Kremer v. Rural Comm. Ins. Co., 788 N.W.2d 538,
 549 (Neb. 2010).) Respondent explains that “delaying the appeal
 until after arbitration requires the parties to engage in a
 useless arbitration proceeding if the order compelling

 Respondent argues that Picardy is a decision of this court. 
Westlaw has published the opinion as from the “Supreme Court of Hawai 'i.”

arbitration was improper.” (Citing Evansville-Vanderburg Sch.
 
Corp. v. Evansville Teacher’s Ass’n, 494 N.E. 2d 321, 322-23
 (Ind. App. 1986).)

VII.
 
As an initial matter, Respondent’s contention that 
Petitioners have waived their argument that Hawai' i law does not 
permit appeals from an order compelling arbitration is incorrect. “If a court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter of a proceeding, any judgment rendered in that proceeding is invalid.” Bush v. Hawaiian Homes Comm’n, 76 Hawai' i 128, 133, 870 P.2d 
1272, 1277 (1994). Therefore, “such a question is valid at any stage of the case.” Id. (emphasis added). In other words, 
“[t]he lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter cannot be waived by the parties.” In re Rice, 68 Haw. 334, 335, 713 P.3d 
426, 427 (1986). Hence, Petitioners cannot have waived their argument that the ICA lacked jurisdiction to hear an appeal. 
Respondent also argues that “the ICA never decided” the 
issue of whether the ICA had jurisdiction under Hawai' i law and 
therefore, “there is nothing to correct.” However, as discussed supra, a jurisdictional question can be raised at any point in 
24
 In Reply, Petitioners argue that they cannot have waived their 
jurisdictional argument because “[t]he ICA’s improper exercise of appellate
jurisdiction is a grave error of law that may be raised at any time.” (Citing Hous. Fin. & Dev. Corp. v. Castle , 79 Hawai 'i 64, 76, 898 P.2d 576, 588 
(1995).) Also, Petitioners reiterate that “[a]llowing only interlocutoryappeals of orders denying arbitration . . . allow[s] arbitration to proceed []without unnecessary delay.” (Citing Gepaya v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. ,
94 Hawai 'i 362, 365, 14 P.3d 1043, 1046 (2000).) 
25
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the proceedings. Therefore, whether or not the ICA’s opinion 
contained error is not controlling; the lack of jurisdiction can be raised for the first time before this court. Additionally, Respondent’s assertion that the ICA “never decided th[e] issue” is wrong. The ICA held that “[u]nder Hawai' i state law, an order 
compelling arbitration is appealable under HRS § 641–1(a) and the collateral order doctrine.” Unidev I, 2011 WL 4998491 at *4. 
Finally, if a court lacks jurisdiction, “any judgment rendered in that proceeding is invalid,” Bush, 76 Hawai' i at 133, and any 
opinion in the case “is a nullity.” State by Kanbara v. Hilo 
Metals Co., 53 Haw. 642, 644, 500 P.2d 743, 745 (1972) (“[T]he district court lacked jurisdiction . . . and the district court's judgment . . . is a nullity.”). Hence, Respondent’s claim that the ICA’s opinion renders the issue of the ICA’s jurisdiction to hear the case moot lacks merit, because if the ICA lacked jurisdiction to hear the case, that opinion “is a nullity.” Id. 
VIII.
 
A. 
In HRS § 658A-28, which adopted the RUAA appeals
 
provision, the legislature expressly enumerated six circumstances
 in which an interlocutory appeal may be taken from proceedings
 related to arbitration. Although the statute specifically allows
 for appeals from “[a]n order denying a motion to compel
 arbitration,” it is silent as to the appealibility of orders 
26
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
granting a motion to compel arbitration. HRS § 658A-28 (emphasis 
added). Under the canon of expressio unius est exclusio alterius, “the mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another.” Int’l Sav. and Loan Ass’n v. Wiig, 82 Hawai' i 197, 
201, 921 P.2d 117, 212 (1996). However, this canon applies “only where in the natural association of ideas the contrast between a specific subject matter which is expressed and one which is not mentioned leads to an inference that the latter was not intended to be included within the statute.” Id. 
There is a “natural association of ideas” between an
 
order denying a motion to compel arbitration and an order
 granting a motion to compel arbitration, because both involve the
 circuit court’s decision regarding a motion to compel
 arbitration. Hence, the failure to include an order granting a
 motion to compel arbitration in the list of appealable orders in
 HRS § 658A-28 may suggest that the legislature did not intend to
 allow such appeals. See, e.g., Chem-Ash, Inc. v. Arkansas Power
 
and Light Co., 751 S.W.2d 353, 354 (Ark. 1988) (interpreting an
 identical statute and holding that “[c]learly, if the legislature
 had intended to deny or delay arbitration by permitting an appeal
 from an order compelling arbitration, it would have said so. The
 act only states that an appeal can be taken from an order denying
 an application to compel arbitration.”); Clark Cnty. v. Empire
 Elec., Inc., 604 P.2d 352, 353 (Nev. 1980) (interpreting an
 identical statute and holding that “the fact that the Legislature
 
27
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
saw fit to specify in one code section the different orders and
 
judgment from which appeals may be taken clearly indicates, in
 our opinion, an intention to restrict the appeals in such
 proceeding to orders and judgment therein specified”).
 
However, HRS § 658A-28 and HRS § 641-1 are both 
statutes regarding the courts’ jurisdiction to hear appeals. It is well settled that “where there is a plainly irreconcilable conflict between a general and a specific statute concerning the same subject matter, the specific will be favored.” State v. 
Hussein, 122 Hawai' i 495, 525, 229 P.3d 313, 343 (2010). If, 
however, “the statutes simply overlap in their application, effect will be given to both if possible, as repeal by implication is disfavored.” Id. Clearly, HRS § 658A-28, which 
addresses appealability in the limited context of arbitration, is the specific statute, and HRS § 641-1, which addresses appealability generally, is the general statute. Thus, should the two statutes conflict, HRS § 658A-28 would control over HRS § 641-1. 
Two statutes conflict where “it is not possible to give 
effect to both.” Schnabel, 127 Hawai' i at 448, 279 P.3d at 1253 
(2012). Under Swinerton, HRS § 641-1 permits appeals from orders compelling arbitration, while, as discussed supra, HRS § 658A-28 may not. Thus, the two statutes may conflict if HRS § 658A-28 provides an exclusive enumeration of the issues related to arbitration that may be appealed.

B.
 
But nothing in the text of HRS § 658A-28 indicates that
 
its list of appealable orders is exclusive. To the contrary, the
 
plain meaning of the text demonstrates that HRS § 658A-28 may be
 read in conjunction with the general appeals statute, HRS § 641­1. See State v. Ribbel, 111 Hawai' i 426, 431, 142 P.3d 290, 296 
(2006) (“Where the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning.”). HRS § 658A-28 states that “an appeal may be taken from” six different types of orders. HRS § 658A-28 (emphasis added.) The word “may” is defined as “(1) to have the ability to; (2) to have permission to; (3) to be free to.” Merriam 
Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 718-19 (10th ed. 1993). By declaring that an appeal “may” be taken from the enumerated statutes, then, the statute indicates that litigants “have permission to,” inter alia, appeal the orders listed in HRS § 658A-28. There is no indication in the statutory language, then, that the “permission” to appeal certain orders such as an order denying a motion to compel arbitration precludes the appeal of an order granting a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to HRS § 641-1. Therefore, “effect can be given to both” HRS § 658A-28 and HRS § 641-1. In other words, HRS § 658A-28 poses “no hurdle” to an appeal under HRS § 641-1. See Gilliland, 904 P.2d at 78 
(“[W]e view [the Uniform Arbitration Act (UAA) appeals provision] 
29

as no hurdle to [an appeal under the state’s final judgment
 
statute.”).25
 
C.
 
This interpretation of HRS § 658A-28 is consistent with
 
the approach followed in the majority of cases cited by
 Petitioners and Respondent. As Respondent notes, several other
 jurisdictions that have enacted either
 
the UAA or the RUAA permit appeals from orders compelling
 arbitration. They view appeals statutes based on either the
 
26 2 7
 UAA or the RUAA  as non-exclusive, because those statutes
 
25 The ICA reached the same conclusion in Picardy , holding that “HRS
 
§ 641-1 provides additional authority for appeals, authorizing appeals to the
[ICA] from final judgments, orders, or decrees.” 2009 WL 4988294 at *1.
 
26 The UAA appeals section is virtually identical to the RUAA appeals
 
section. The UAA section governing appeals provides as follows:
 
§ 19 Appeals.
(a) An appeal may be taken from:
 
(1) An order denying a motion to compel
arbitration made under Section 2;
 
(2) An order granting a [motion] to stay
arbitration made under Section 2(b);
 (3) An order confirming or denying confirmation
of an award;
 (4) An order modifying or correcting an award;
 
(5) An order vacating an award without directing
a rehearing; or
 (6) A judgment or decree entered pursuant to the
provisions of this act.
 (b) An appeal under this section shall be taken as
from an order or a judgment in a civil action.
 
HRS § 658A-28 is adopted verbatim from the RUAA. The RUAA section
 
governing appeals provides as follows:
 
§ 28 Appeals.
(a) An appeal may be taken from:

“lay[] no textual pretense to exclusivity in [their] application
 
to arbitration related appeals.” Gilliland, 904 P.2d at 77-78. 
Rather, those courts treat the RUAA appeals provision as “no more
 than a litany of orders -- all typically occurring in litigation
 over arbitration -- which in addition to more mainstream rulings,
 are to be treated as appealable.” Id. at 78 (emphasis added).
28
 
Such jurisdictions also recognize that it would be fundamentally
 unfair to “require a party who has not agreed to arbitrate a
 particular dispute . . . to arbitrate it.” Kremer, 788 N.W. 2d
 
at 549. 
Even in the majority of the decisions cited by
 
Petitioners, courts do not conclude that statutes based on the
 UAA or RUAA are exclusive. Instead, those decisions conclude 
(1) An order denying a [motion] to compel
arbitration;
 
(2) An order granting a [motion] to stay
arbitration;
 (3) An order confirming or denying confirmation
of an award;
 (4) An order modifying or correcting an award;
 
(5) An order vacating an award without directing
a rehearing; or
 (6) A final judgment entered pursuant to this
[Act].
 (b) An appeal under this section shall be taken as
from an order or a judgment in a civil action.
 
28
 Other jurisdictions that permit appeals from orders compelling
 
arbitration based on an interpretation of similar provisions as being non-
exclusive are Kremer, 788 N.W.2d at 547-48; Wein v. Morris , 944 A.2d 642, 651
(N.J. 2008); and Collier v. Pennington , 69 P.3d 238, 240 (N.M. App. 2003).

that (1) orders compelling arbitration are not listed under the
 
RUAA appeals provision, and (2) that the appealability of orders
 compelling arbitration “must also be examined” under that
 jurisdiction’s general appeals statute. Chem-Ash, 751 S.W.2d at
 
85 (holding that “[c]learly, if the legislature had intended to
 deny or delay arbitration by permitting an appeal from an order
 compelling arbitration, it would have said so,” but also holding
 that “[e]ven so, the trial court's order must also be examined in
 light of Rule 2(a) of the Arkansas Rules of Appellate Procedure,
 which governs the appealability of lower court orders.” (emphasis
 added)).
29 Consequently, even the states that hold orders 
29 Other cases cited by Petitioners that address both the appeals
 
provision in the UAA or RUAA and that jurisdiction’s general appeals statute
before holding that orders compelling arbitration are not appealable are

granting arbitration could not be appealed under the RUAA’s appeals provision

litigation is not final” under Utah’s final judgment statute); Harris v. State
Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. , 283 So.2d 147, 148-49 (Fla. App. 1973) (holding that
an “order granting a motion or application to compel arbitration is

because “it is not a final order”); Fayette Cnty. Farm Bureau Fed’n v. Martin ,
758 S.W.2d 713 (Ky. App. 1988) (holding that an order compelling arbitration

is not final); Maleski v. Mutual Fire, Marine, and Inland Ins. Co. , 534 A.2d
1143, 1145-46) (1993) (holding that an order compelling arbitration is not
immediately appealable because it is not final and because it is not listed in
the UAA appeals provision); T.R. Mills Contractors, Inc. v. WRH Enterprises,
LLC, 93 S.W. 3d 861, 864-65 (2002) (holding that the UAA appeals statute is a

Ass’n, 472 P.2d 572, 573 (Wash. App. 1970) (holding that orders compelling
arbitration are not appealable not because of the UAA appeals provision, but
because “[i]t has been definitely settled by the Supreme Court of this state
that an order compelling arbitration is not final and therefore is not
appealable.”).

compelling arbitration are not appealable recognize that the
 
RUAA’s appeals provision is non-exclusive.30
 
Therefore, in consonance with the decisions of the
 
majority of jurisdictions that have adopted either the UAA or
 RUAA’s appeals provision, HRS § 658A-28 represents a non-
exclusive list of appealable orders. In that regard, HRS § 641­1, Hawai' i’s final judgment statute, allows appeals from “all 
30 At oral argument, Petitioners stated that “forty-nine”
 
jurisdictions have adopted the UAA or RUAA, and of those jurisdictions “about
 
forty-one” do not allow appeals from orders compelling arbitration.
Petitioner cited as authority the American Law Reports annotation on orders
compelling arbitration. See Annotation, Appealability of State Court’s Order
or Decree Compelling or Refusing to Compel Arbitration , 6 A.L.R.4th 652
(Originally published in 1981). Petitioner apparently was citing the
Prefatory Note to the RUAA, which stated that “forty-nine jurisdictions have
arbitration statutes, 35 of those have adopted the UAA and 14 have adopted
substantially similar legislation.” Prefatory Note to the RUAA.
But, confusion apparently exists as to which jurisdictions have
not adopted the UAA. Compare Birmingham News Co. v. Horn , 901 So.2d 27, 45
(“Presumably Alabama is the excluded 50th jurisdiction, it being self-evident
that the [Alabama Arbitration Act] is in no wise [sic] ‘substantially similar’
to the UAA”) with Committee on Arbitration, Association of the Bar of the City
of New York, et al. Report on the Revised Uniform Arbitration Act (“New York
is the one state that did not formally adopt the UAA.”); see also Stephen
Wills Murphy, Note, Judicial Review of Arbitration Awards Under State Law , 96
Va. L. Rev. 887, 891 n.15 (stating that Alabama, New Hampshire, and West
Virginia “have adopted arbitration statutes whose systems of judicial review
are not based on the Federal or Uniform Acts”). Moreover, even the
 jurisdictions with “substantially similar legislation” often utilize differing
 appeals provisions. For example, nine states have “adopted arbitration
 statutes based on the [FAA].” Murphy, Judicial Review of Arbitration Awards
Under State Law , 96 Va. L. Rev. at 891. The FAA’s appeals provision contains
explicit language regarding orders compelling arbitration. Consequently,
Petitioner’s statement does not clarify how many states have adopted statutes
similar to HRS § 658A-28.
Second, in the ALR article identified by Petitioner, decisions
from twenty UAA or RUAA states (Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida,
Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, North
Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia,
Washington, and Wyoming) are cited as refusing to allow appeals from orders
compelling arbitration. 6 A.L.R.4th at § 3[b]-3[c]. Of those twenty states,
decisions from nineteen states (all but Nevada) are cited as “based in whole
 or in part upon the consideration that the particular order lacked such
finality as to fall within the purview of a statute or rule of practice
authorizing appeals from final orders or judgments. ” Id. at § 3[b] (emphasis
 
added). Hence, even under the authority cited by Petitioner, the clear
majority of states do not consider the UAA or RUAA appeals provision to be
exclusive.
 
33
         
           
          ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
final judgments, orders or decrees.” To reiterate, under the 
collateral order doctrine, “orders . . . compelling arbitration are appealable final orders.” Swinerton, 68 Haw. at 107, 705 
P.2d at 35 (emphasis added). In sum, after Hawai' i’s adoption of 
HRS § 658A-28, orders compelling arbitration remain appealable under Hawai' i’s final judgment statute, HRS § 641-1. Gilliland, 
904 P.2d at 78. Thus, the ICA’s holding that it had jurisdiction to hear Respondent’s appeal was not in error. 
D.
 
The Commentary to the RUAA does not address the RUAA
 
section on appeals. The Prefatory Note to the RUAA does state
 that the RUAA “revis[ed] the original [UAA] in light of the
 increasing use of arbitration, the greater complexity of many
 disputes resolved by arbitration, and the developments of the law
 in this area.” Prefatory Note to the RUAA. In other words, the
 RUAA is a “revision of the UAA.” Id. The Prefatory Note to the
 
original UAA explained that “[t]he section on Appeals is intended
 to remove doubts as to what orders are appealable and to limit
 appeals prior to judgment as to those instances where the element
 of finality is present.” Prefatory Note to the UAA.
31
 
It had been held that in order to ensure that the
 
appeals section of the UAA has the intended effect of “remov[ing]
 doubts as to what orders are appealable,” that section must be
 read as an exclusive list of appealable orders. See S.
 
31
 Neither the UAA nor RUAA establishes the weight to be given to
 
either the Commentary or the Prefatory Note in interpreting those acts.
 
34
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
California Edison Co. v. Peabody Western Coal Co., 977 P.2d 769,
 
774 (Ariz. 1999) (holding that the Prefatory Note indicates that
 the intent of the UAA drafters was that “interlocutory orders,
 including those compelling arbitration are not appealable.”). 
If orders related to arbitration could also be appealed via a
 general appeals statute, such as HRS § 641-1, then “doubts” would
 remain as to the appealability of all orders not explicitly
 identified in the RUAA.
 
As discussed supra, however, the plain language of HRS 
§ 658A-28, i.e. “may,” indicates that the statute’s list of appealable orders was not exclusive. “Departure from the plain and unambiguous language of the statute cannot be justified without a clear showing that the legislature intended some other meaning would be given [to] the language.” Singleton v. Liquor 
Comm’n, Cnty. of Hawai' i, 111 Hawai' i 234, 244, 140 P.3d 1014, 
1024 (2006). The language in the Prefatory Note to the UAA was not included in either the model RUAA or Hawai' i’s adoption of 
the RUAA. There is no indication that the legislature either considered the Prefatory Note to the UAA while adopting HRS § 658A-28 or intended it to control the interpretation of HRS § 658A-28 under the RUAA. Therefore, the Prefatory Note to the UAA does not constitute a “clear showing” that the legislature intended to depart from the plain meaning of HRS § 658A-28. 
Moreover, this court’s decision in Swinerton is not
 
inconsistent with the Prefatory Note to the UAA, inasmuch as the
 
35
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Note emphasized that the purpose of the appeals provision was to
 
“limit appeals prior to judgment as to those instances where the
 element of finality is present.” (Emphasis added.) Swinerton
 
explained that “what determines the finality of an order . . . is
 the nature and effect of the order.” 68 Haw at 105, 705 P.3d at
 33. Regarding orders compelling arbitration, Swinerton observed
 
that “whether [] alleged contractual violations should be
 presented to an arbitrator . . . is a matter wholly separate from
 the merits of plaintiff’s cause.” Id. at 106, 705 P.3d at 34
 
(internal quotation marks and punctuation omitted). Hence, a
 ruling on an motion to compel arbitration “is a final disposition
 of the claimed right.” Id. (emphasis added). This court
 
therefore determined that “orders . . . compelling arbitration
 are [immediately] appealable,” i.e., that under HRS § 641-1, the
 “nature and effect” of orders compelling arbitration demonstrated
 their finality. Id. Thus, an “element of finality is present,”
 
Prefatory Note to the UAA, in orders compelling arbitration. 
E.
 
Finally, Petitioners argue pursuant to HRS § 1-24, that
 
this court should interpret HRS § 658A-28 in a manner that is
 uniform with the other states adopting RUAA. (Internal quotation
 marks and brackets omitted). First, as discussed supra, the
 majority of UAA or RUAA states to address this issue apparently
 recognize that the appeals provision of both model statutes are
 not exclusive. Hence, interpreting HRS § 658A-28 as a non­
36
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
exclusive list is consistent with the practices of other
 
jurisdictions. Second, other UAA or RUAA states are not uniform
 in disallowing appeals from orders compelling arbitration. 
Decisions from several UAA or RUAA states, including Nebraska,
 New Jersey, Oklahoma, and New Mexico permit appeals from orders
 compelling arbitration. Given conflicting interpretations of the
 UAA or RUAA appeals provision in other states, HRS § 658A-28 is
 not being interpreted in a non-uniform manner.
 
VIII.
 
A.
 
Regarding the second Application question, Petitioners
 
first contend that the ICA erred in relying on In re Kinoshita,
 287 F.2d 951, 952-53 (2d Cir. 1961), because “the majority of the
 federal circuits have [] rejected Kinoshita’s reasoning” that the
 phrase “arising under” should be interpreted narrowly. In its
 Response, Respondent maintains that, the ICA “noted the lack of
 consistency by the [federal c]ourts” on this issue, and the ICA
 “did not adopt the minority position” because it “expressly
 stated that it was not deciding that issue.” (Emphasis in
 original.) 
The language in the DSA states that “any dispute 
arising under the terms of the agreement” is subject to arbitration. Acknowledging the split in federal authority interpreting “arising under,” the ICA stated that “[w]e need not decide that particular issue.” Unidev II, 128 Hawai' i at 399, 
37
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
289 P.3d at 1035. The ICA determined that because the provision
 
also contained the phrase “the terms of the agreement,” “the
 parties indicated their intent to require arbitration when a
 dispute implicates or involves the terms of the DSA.” Id.
 
(emphasis in original). The ICA opinion thus focused on the
 words “the terms of this agreement” and not the phrase “arising
 under.” Id. Hence, the ICA did not decide whether the phrase
 
“arising under” should be construed narrowly or broadly. 
B.
 
As to their second argument regarding the second
 
question, Petitioners contend that “[c]ourts that examine nearly
 identical arbitration clauses [to the arbitration clause at issue
 in this case] refuse to characterize the controlling language as
 being narrow.” Petitioners assert that in Goldberg v. Focus
 Affiliates, Inc., 152 F. Supp. 2d 978, 980-82 (N.D. Ill. 2001),
 “the court held that a clause requiring arbitration for claims
 ‘arising under the terms of this Agreement’ was broad enough to
 encompass fraudulent inducement and negligent and fraudulent
 misrepresentation claims –- the same claims [Respondent] asserts
 against [Petitioners].” (Emphasis added.) Petitioners also cite
 Gregory v. Electro-Mech. Corp., 83 F.3d 382, 385 (11th Cir.
 1996), and Campos v. Campos Family Farms, LLC, 2012 WL 2090303
 (E.D. Cal. June 8, 2012), as supporting arbitration in this case. 
According to Petitioners, in Gregory, the “Eleventh
 
Circuit held that fraudulent inducement claims were within the
 
38
         
             
          
           
            
        
         
             
             
           
           
                 
           
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
scope of an agreement requiring arbitration of ‘any dispute . . .
 
which may arise hereunder.’” Further, Petitioners contend that
 in Campos, which dealt with an agreement “requiring arbitration
 for ‘any and all disputes over the terms and implementation of
 this Agreement,’” the court characterized the arbitration
 agreement as “broad in scope.” (Emphasis added.) Consequently,
 Petitioners argue that the DSA’s arbitration provision should be
 construed “broadly.”
 
In response, Respondent reiterates that under Cape 
Flattery Ltd., Mediterranean Enterprises, and Tracer Research, the arbitration agreement at issue in this case is “relatively narrow.” Respondent also cites Hamada v. Westcott, 102 Hawai' i 
210, 215, 74 P.3d 33, 38 (2003) as holding that an “agreement to arbitrate which contained ‘arising under’ language did not permit [the] arbitrator to rule on attorney[’s] fees and costs.”
32 
C.
 
Under Hawai' i law, “any doubts concerning the scope of 
arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.” Lee v. Heftel, 81 Hawai' i 1, 4, 911 P.2d 721, 724 (1996). 
32 In Hamada, 102 Hawai 'i at 215, 74 P.3d at 38, this court held that 
an “agreement to arbitrate which contained ‘arising under’ language did not
permit [an] arbitrator to rule on attorney[’s] fees and costs.” Hamada 
excluded the issue of attorney’s fees and costs from the scope of anarbitration agreement because in another contractual provision related toearly termination, the parties explicitly stated that the terminating partywould be liable for the payment of attorney’s fees. Hamada, 102 Hawai 'i at 
212, 74 P.3d at 35. This court therefore concluded that attorney’s fees werenot within the scope of the arbitration agreement because “[w]here the partiesintended to provide for attorney’s fees and costs in the purchase agreement,they said so.” Id. at 215, 74 P.3d at 38. Hamada is not applicable to the
instant case, where no provisions in the DSA beyond the arbitration agreementitself are relevant to the breadth of the arbitration agreement. 
39
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
However, “the mere existence of an arbitration agreement does not 
mean that the parties must submit to an arbitrator disputes which are outside the scope of the arbitration agreement.” Hawai'i 
Med. Ass’n, 113 Hawai' i at 92, 148 P.3d at 1194 (citation 
omitted). “What issues, if any, are beyond the scope of a contractual agreement to arbitrate depends on the wording of the contractual agreement to arbitrate.” Id. (citations omitted) 
(emphasis in original). An arbitration agreement is interpreted like a contract, and “as with any contract, the parties intentions control.” Heftel, 81 Hawai' i at 4, 911 P.2d at 724. 
Further, “we have long expressed our disapproval of interpreting a contract such that any provision be rendered meaningless.” Stanford Carr Dev. Corp. v. Unity House, 111 Hawai' i 286, 297, 
141 P.3d 459, 470 (2006). 
Those courts deciding that the phrase “arising under”
 
should be interpreted narrowly emphasize that the choice to use
 “arising under” instead of language such as “arising out of or in
 relation to” must be meaningful. See Mediterranean Enterprises,
 
708 F.2d at 1464. For example, in construing the phrase “arising
 under” as narrow, the Ninth Circuit stated that “[t]he standard
 phrase suggested in the U.S.-Korean Commercial Arbitration
 Agreement contains the phrase “out of or in relation to or in
 connection with the contract, or for the breach thereof.” Id. 
Because the agreement before that court excluded much of that
 language, and referred only to “any disputes arising hereunder,”
 
40
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the court reasoned that “[w]e have no difficulty finding that
 
‘arising hereunder’ is intended to cover a much narrower scope of
 disputes, i.e., only those relating to interpretation and
 performance of the contract.” Id.; see also Kinoshita, 287 F.2d
 
at 953 (holding that the parties choice to require arbitration
 for disputes which “arise under” a contract, when the standard
 language was “arising out of or relating to” demonstrated that
 the parties intended the agreement to be narrow).
 
In contrast, the majority of federal courts conclude
 
that the policy favoring arbitration requires arbitration
 provisions containing “general language,” such as the language at
 issue in the instant case, be construed broadly. Sweet Dreams
 
Unlimited, Inc. v. Dial-A-Mattress Int’l, Ltd., 1 F.3d 639, 642­43 (7th Cir. 1993). In Sweet Dreams Unlimited, the arbitration
 clause at issue provided that “any disputes arising out of the
 agreement” shall be settled through arbitration. The Seventh
 Circuit ruled that “arising out of” and “arising under” both
 constituted “general language” authorizing arbitration. 
Therefore, should parties wish to exempt specific issues from
 arbitration, they should use “specific language to identify the
 types of disputes that are not subject to arbitration, thereby
 limiting the reach of phrases such as ‘arising out of’ or
 ‘arising under.’” Id. at 643 (emphasis in original). Because
 
the parties in Sweet Dreams Unlimited had “not taken any steps to
 narrow the reach of the [] arbitration clause,” the Seventh
 
41
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Circuit interpreted the clause’s scope broadly, and held that it
 
covered allegations that the contract was void due to illegality
 and allegations of fraud or misrepresentation that occurred
 “after the agreement expired.” Id.
 
Several other courts have also interpreted arbitration
 
provisions containing “arising under” language as “general”
 arbitration clauses whose scope is broad. For example, in PRM
 Energy Systems, the arbitration clause at issue “cover[ed] ‘all
 disputes arising under’ the agreement.” 592 F.3d at 836. The
 Eighth Circuit explained that this arbitration clause “includes
 no limiting language and is generally broad in scope.” Id. at
 
837. It was concluded the “arising under” arbitration clause 
thus applied to tort claims including fraud, misappropriation of trade secrets, unfair competition, and tortious interference. Id. at 832, 837; cf. Heftel, 81 Hawai' i at 2, 4, 911 P.2d at 722, 
724 (concluding that an arbitration clause covering “any dispute . . . [that] arises out of this [contract]” was a “broad arbitration clause”). 
Under the circumstances of this case, the reasoning of
 
the federal courts in construing similar arbitration clauses
 broadly is persuasive. Respectfully, the ICA’s interpretation of
 the arbitration provision’s scope, i.e., that the clause only
 mandates arbitration for claims that involve “construction or
 interpretation of the DSA’s terms,” appears unnecessarily narrow. 
We conclude that the arbitration clause in the instant case
 
42
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
constitutes a “general” arbitration clause. As discussed infra,
 
this application of the arbitration clause in the DSA covers the
 claims and counterclaims raised by the parties in the instant
 case.
 
Moreover, as in Sweet Dreams Unlimted and PRM Energy,
 
the general arbitration clause contained “no limiting language” 
that could have narrowed its scope. PRM Energy, 592 F.3d at 837.
 
“[W]e [] look to the language of the arbitration clause to
 determine whether [an] underlying dispute . . . is arbitrable.” 
Koolau Radiology, Inc. v. Queen’s Medical Center, 73 Haw. 433,
 447, 834 P.2d 1924, 1301 (1992); see also Rainbow Chevrolet, Inc.
 v. Asahi Jyuken (USA), Inc., 78 Hawai' i 107, 113, 890 P.2d 694, 
700 (App. 1995), superseded by statute as stated in, Ueoka v. Szymanski, 107 Hawai' i 386, 114 P.3d 892 (2005) (“What issues, if 
any, are beyond the scope of a contractual agreement to arbitrate depends on the wording of the contractual agreement to arbitrate.”). In this case, the arbitration clause employed general language. Thus, it may be inferred from the clause that the parties did not intend to restrict the reach of the arbitration clause simply to claims involving construction or arbitration of the terms of the agreement. Had the parties intended to restrict arbitration to issues related to interpretation of the DSA’s terms only, as the ICA suggests, it would have been a simple matter to draft unambiguous language to effectuate that intent. For example, the parties could have 
43
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
provided that arbitration was limited to disputes regarding 
construction or interpretation of the DSA. The failure of the parties to unambiguously limit the arbitrability of disputes suggests that they intended a longer reach for the arbitration clauses. Sweet Dreams Unlimited, 1 F.3d at 643. Thus, 
respectfully, the ICA erred in concluding that the scope of the arbitration agreement was limited to “claims that involve construction or interpretation of the DSA’s terms.” Unidev II, 
128 Hawai' i at 399, 289 P.3d at 1035. 
IX.
 
A.
 
As to the third question raised in the Application, 
Petitioners argue that all of Respondent’s claims and Petitioners’ counterclaims are subject to arbitration. Whether a claim falls within the scope of an arbitration agreement turns on the factual allegations in the complaint. See Heftel, 81 Hawai' i 
at 4, 911 P.2d at 724 (examining the plaintiff’s “general allegations” to determine if a claim was arbitrable). There are five factual bases alleged for Respondent’s claims of false claims, unfair and deceptive practices, fraudulent inducement, intentional misrepresentation, and negligent misrepresentation. They are that (1) Petitioners submitted invoices that demanded payment for services for which Petitioner had already received payment, (2) Petitioners submitted invoices which misrepresented that funds would be used to pay contractors, (3) Petitioners 
44
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
submitted invoices that Respondent was not required to pay, (4)
 
Petitioners made misrepresentations to induce Respondent to
 provide funding to the Project, and (5) Petitioners made
 misrepresentations to induce Respondent to award the Project to
 Petitioners.
 
As to (1), (2), and (3), the invoices that Respondent
 
objects to all requested payment for work allegedly performed on
 behalf of the project. Thus, the invoices that Respondent
 alleges are fraudulent are covered by the general language
 referring to disputes arising under the DSA inasmuch as the
 payments involved Petitioners’ obligation to develop the Project
 for Respondent. 
Similarly, as to (4), Respondents allege that the
 
purpose of Petitioners’ misrepresentations was to obtain further
 funding for the Project. Because the contractual relationship
 created by the DSA between Petitioners and Respondent initiated
 the development of the Project, these allegations also arose
 under the DSA. 
As to (5), Petitioner claims that the contract itself 
was fraudulently induced. In Heftel, this court concluded that “a broad arbitration clause will be held to encompass arbitration of the claim that the contract itself was induced by fraud.” 81 Hawai'i at 4, 911 P.2d at 724. However, this court limited its 
holding to cases “where no claim is made that fraud was directed to the arbitration clause itself.” Heftel, 81 Hawai' i at 4, 911 
45
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
P.2d at 724. In the instant case, as in Heftel, Respondent’s
 
“general allegations were based on fraud in the inducement of the
 contract as a whole, rather than fraud in the inducement of the
 arbitration clause.” Id. Hence, the factual allegations that
 
Petitioners’ made misrepresentations to induce Respondent to
 award them the Project also fall within the scope of the
 arbitration agreement.
 
Finally, for its negligence claim in its first
 
complaint, Respondent alleged that Petitioners failed to abide by
 the terms of the DSA, which required Petitioners to obtain prior
 approval for certain consultant contracts and their expenses. In
 other words, Respondent alleges that Petitioners did not meet the
 contractual obligations set forth in the DSA. Thus, as the ICA
 recognized, this allegation arose under the DSA.
 
As to Petitioners’ counterclaims, Petitioners allege
 
that (1) WWH breached the DSA and ADSA, (2) Respondent and WWH
 were unjustly enriched because they did not pay Petitioners for
 the benefits of their services, (3) Respondent interfered with
 the contract between WWH and Petitioners, and (4) WWH
 fraudulently transferred land to Respondent to avoid paying
 Petitioners what they were owed under the ADSA. All four claims
 relate to the relationship between WWH and Petitioners. The DSA
 foresaw that Respondent would transfer the Property to WWH, and
 that WWH would work with Petitioners to complete the Project. As 
46
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the court recognized, then, Petitioners’ counterclaims “arise out
 
of the relationship between the parties” created by the DSA.
 
X.
 
Thus, Respondent’s claims and Petitioners’
 
counterclaims fall within the scope of the DSA arbitration
 provision, and are subject to arbitration. 
To the extent that
 
the ICA held otherwise, respectfully, the ICA erred. Based on
 the foregoing, the ICA’s October 17, 2011, Order Denying
 September 19, 2011 Motion to Dismiss Appeal for Lack of
 Jurisdiction is affirmed. In light of the reasons stated herein,
 the ICA’s August 31, 2012 opinion and October 18, 2012 judgment
 on appeal are vacated in part and affirmed in part. The case is
 remanded to the court for further proceedings consistent with
 this opinion.
