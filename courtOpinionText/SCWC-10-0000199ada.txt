the case. We find no deficiency of jurisdiction and affirm the 
judgment on appeal, but for the reasons stated herein. 
II. BACKGROUND 
On February 20, 2008, the State of Hawaiʻ i (State) 
filed a two-count criminal traffic complaint against Sandra 
Schwartz (Schwartz) in the District Court of the Second Circuit 
(district court). 
Count One alleged commission of the offense 
of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant 
(OVUII), in violation of Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E­
61(a) (2007).1 The complaint charged Count One as follows: 
That on or about the 26th day of January, 2008, in the 
Division of Lahaina, County of Maui, State of Hawaii, 
SANDRA KAY SCHWARTZ did operate or assume actual physical 
control of a vehicle while under the influence of an 
intoxicant meaning that she was under the influence of 
alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair her normal mental
faculties or ability to care for herself and guard against 
casualty, thereby committing the offense of Operating a 
Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant in violation of Section 291E61 (a) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes. 
The complaint did not allege that the offense took place on a 
public way, street, road, or highway.2 
1	 HRS § 291E-61(a) provides, in relevant part as follows: 
(a)	 A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under
the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an amount 
sufficient to impair the person’s normal mental
faculties or ability to care for the person and guardagainst casualty . . . . 
2 Count Two alleged Reckless Driving of Vehicle in violation of HRS
§ 291-2 (2007).  The charge read as follows:

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
On April 2, 2008, Schwartz pleaded guilty to the OVUII 
charge.3 At the change of plea hearing, counsel for Schwartz 
stated, “Your Honor, we are in receipt of a written complaint. 
We waive oral reading of the written complaint.” The court 
examined Schwartz with respect to her plea, and Schwartz 
indicated that she was aware of the procedural and substantive 
effect of her plea. Schwartz and the State stipulated to the 
following facts: Schwartz was stopped by a police officer in Lāhainā; she was unable to successfully perform field sobriety 
maneuvers; and she elected to refuse testing. Following 
recitation of these facts and completion of the guilty plea 
colloquy, the district court found Schwartz guilty of OVUII and 
imposed sentence.
4 Schwartz did not file an appeal from the 
April 2, 2008 judgment of conviction (judgment). 
(. . . continued) 
That on or about the 26th day of January, 2008, in the
Division of Lahaina, County of Maui, State of Hawaii,SANDRA KAY SCHWARTZ did operate a motor vehicle recklessly
in disregard of the safety of persons or property, thereby 
committing the offense of Reckless Driving of Vehicle in
violation of Section 291- 2 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes. 
Court minutes reflect that Count Two was amended to “Lack of Due Care,” in
violation of Maui County Code § 10.52.010.  
3 The Honorable Rhonda I. L. Loo presided. 
4 The district court also accepted Schwartz’s “admittance” to the
Lack of Due Care charge. 
The district court imposed the following sentence: Count One-­
$300 fine, $30 criminal injury fee, $100 driver’s education fee, $7 driver
education fee, $25 neurotrauma fee, $250 drug demand reduction fee, and 90­
day license suspension; Count Two--$100 fine, and $7 driver’s education fee.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Approximately two years later, this court held that 
operation of a vehicle on “a public way, street, road, or 
highway” (public road) is an attendant circumstance of the 
offense of OVUII, and therefore the public road circumstance is 
an element of the offense that must be stated in the charge. 
State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawaiʻ i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180 
(2009). 
Based on Wheeler,  Schwartz filed a petition to vacate 
and set aside the judgment under Hawaiʻ i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP) Rule 40 (Rule 40 petition). In her Rule 40 petition, 
Schwartz raised a single issue: the “complaint failed to allege 
an essential element of OVUII,” and “[a]ccordingly, [c]ount 
[o]ne of the complaint . . . was fatally defective, thereby 
conferring no subject matter[] jurisdiction to the trial court.” (Emphasis added). Schwartz argued that as a consequence of the 
court’s lack of jurisdiction, the judgment as to the OVUII 
charge “is null and void as a matter of law.” Schwartz did not 
contend that her plea was not made voluntarily and intelligently 
nor assert any other reason that her plea should be considered 
invalid. 
The State responded with the following arguments: 
Schwartz waived her jurisdictional argument by failing to raise 
it on direct appeal; even if she had not waived the argument, Wheeler
 does not apply retroactively to final judgments no

   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
longer pending at the time Wheeler was decided; the complaint 
reasonably charged Schwartz with OVUII; and she was not 
prejudiced by the omission of the public-road element in the 
OVUII charge. 
In its written order denying the Rule 40 petition, the 
district court concluded that Wheeler “created a new 
constitutional rule of criminal procedure.”5 The court noted 
that new constitutional rules of criminal procedure do not apply 
to cases that become final before the new rule is announced, 
unless the rule is within one of two categories. The court 
concluded that the two exceptions did not apply because it was 
not (1) a rule that places a class of private conduct beyond the 
power of the State to proscribe or addresses a substantive 
categorical guarantee of the constitution or (2) a watershed 
rule of criminal procedure implicating fundamental fairness. 
Accordingly, the district court concluded that Wheeler did not 
apply retroactively and denied Schwartz’s Rule 40 petition. 
Schwartz timely appealed to the Intermediate Court of 
Appeals (ICA). Before the ICA, Schwartz renewed her argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the 
crime for which she was charged and also challenged the district

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
court’s conclusion that Wheeler could not be applied 
retroactively to challenge a final judgment. 
In response, the State argued the following: the 
district court correctly found that Wheeler did not have 
retroactive application; under the Motta/Wells liberal 
construction standard,6 the complaint could reasonably be 
construed to charge a crime; and Schwartz could not show that she suffered prejudice. 
The ICA affirmed the district court’s order denying 
Schwartz’s Rule 40 petition in a summary disposition order, 
relying on Christian v. State, 131 Hawaiʻ i 153, 315 P.3d 779 
(App. 2013), decided the same day. Schwartz v. State,
 No. CAAP­
10-0000199 (App. Nov. 23, 2013) (SDO) at *1. In 
Christian, the 
ICA held that the Wheeler decision represented a new rule that did not apply retroactively. Christian, 131 Hawaiʻ i at 160-61, 
315 P.3d at 786-87. Additionally, the ICA concluded that when a 
defendant challenges the sufficiency of the charge for the first 
time on collateral review, a defendant is required to show 
exceptional circumstances in order to obtain relief. Id. at 
164—65, 315 P.3d at 788—90. Applying that test, the ICA held that Schwartz could not establish exceptional circumstances. 
Id. at 164-65, 315 P.3d at 790-91. 
6 See State v. Motta, 66 Haw. 89, 657 P.2d 1019 (1983); State v. 
Wells, 78 Hawaiʻ i 373, 894 P.2d 70 (1995).

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In her application for writ of certiorari 
(Application) to this court, Schwartz presents the threshold 
question of whether the failure of a charging instrument to 
allege an element of an offense is a jurisdictional defect that 
“fail[s] to confer subject-matter jurisdiction to the district 
court.” Schwartz also presents two other questions: whether 
Wheeler applies retroactively to cases on collateral review, and 
whether “a defective charge under Wheeler
, even if properly 
characterized as a jurisdictional defect, cannot be 
retroactively applied on collateral review.” 
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
The denial of a Rule 40 petition based on the district 
court’s conclusions of law is reviewed de novo. Coulter v. 
State, 116 Hawaiʻ i 181, 184, 172 P.3d 493, 496 (2007). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
In 2009, this court held that the fact that the 
offense of OVUII took place on a public road was an element of 
an OVUII charge. Wheeler, 121 Hawaiʻ i at 393, 396, 219 P.3d at 
1180, 1183. As noted, the OVUII charge against Schwartz, filed 
prior to the decision in Wheeler, did not allege the public-road 
element. Thus, this court must determine whether the district 
court had jurisdiction to adjudicate the OVUII offense charged 
against her, notwithstanding the omitted element.

A. Jurisdiction of the district court is conferred by statute 
Jurisdiction is defined as “the power and authority on 
the part of the court to hear and judicially determine and 
dispose of the cause pending before it.” State v. Villados, 55 
Haw. 394, 396, 520 P.2d 427, 430 (1974
); Matter of Keamo, 3 Haw. 
App. 360, 366, 650 P.2d 1365, 1370 (1982) (same); Sherman v. Sawyer, 63 Haw. 55, 57, 621 P.2d 346, 348 (1980) (same); see 
also Black’s Law Dictionary 980 (10th ed. 2014) (defining 
jurisdiction as a “court’s power to decide a case or issue a 
decree”). 
“Jurisdiction of the offense charged and of the person 
of the accused is a fundamental and indispensable prerequisite 
to a valid prosecution.”
7 State v. Meyers, 72 Haw. 591, 593, 825 
P.2d 1062, 1064 (1992). 
“[J]urisdiction depends upon the state 
of affairs existing at the time it is invoked; once having attached, it . . . is retained by a court until fully exhausted 
by the entry of a final judgment.” Villados, 55 Haw. at 397, 
520 P.2d at 430. It is not lost by subsequent events, id., 
7 Jurisdiction over the person of the accused exists, inter alia,
when the person’s conduct or the conduct of another for which the person is 
legally accountable occurs within this State or the result constituting anelement of the offense occurs within this State. HRS § 701-106(1)(a); see 
also  HRS § 701
 -106(1)(b)- (f).  Schwartz has not argued that personal
jurisdiction was lacking in this case.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
unless a statute provides otherwise.8 “[J]urisdiction is not a 
light bulb which can be turned off or on during the course of 
the trial.” Id. (quoting Silver Surprize, Inc. v. Sunshine 
Mining Co.
, 445 P.2d 334, 336 (Wash. 1968)) (internal quotation 
marks omitted). 
Lack of subject-matter jurisdiction means that a court 
is without power to decide the merits of a case.9 State v. 
Brandimart, 68 Haw. 495, 496, 720 P.2d 1009, 1010 (1986). 
However, “[a] court always has jurisdiction to determine whether 
it has jurisdiction over a particular case.” Id. “[Q]uestions 
regarding subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any stage 
of a cause of action.” Adams v. State, 103 Hawaiʻ i 214, 221, 81 
P.3d 394, 401 (2003) (quoting Amantiad v. Odum, 90 Hawaiʻ i 152, 
159, 977 P.2d 160, 167 (1999)). 
If a court lacks jurisdiction 
to hear a matter, any decision on the merits of the “case” is, 
by definition, null and void. Id. 
Thus, subject-matter jurisdiction is fundamental to a 
court’s power to act on the merits of a case from the outset of 
8 See, e.g., HRS § 583A- 202 (2002) (describing the exclusive, 
continuing jurisdiction of a court over a child- custody determination until 
two alternative events transpire). 
9 “Subject- matter jurisdiction” is used in this opinion when 
generally referring to “the power and authority on the part of the court to
hear and judicially determine and dispose of the cause pending before it.”
State v. Villados, 55 Haw. 394, 396, 520 P.2d 427, 430 (1974). “Criminal 
jurisdiction” is used when referring to the subject
-matter jurisdiction of 
the district courts over criminal cases, as defined by Hawai i Revised 
Statutes (HRS) chapter 604.

the action; it may be challenged at any time, but jurisdiction 
does not vacillate during the course of a case depending on the 
particulars of the matter as it develops. 
1. Criminal jurisdiction of the district courts 
The criminal jurisdiction of our courts originates in 
our constitution and is defined by the legislature. 
The judicial power of the State shall be vested in one
supreme court, one intermediate appellate court, circuit
courts, district courts and in such other courts as the
legislature may from time to time establish.   The several 
courts shall have original and appellate jurisdiction asprovided by law  .  .  .  .  
Haw. Const. art. VI, § 1 (emphasis added). In accordance with 
the constitution, the legislature has established the criminal 
jurisdictional parameters of the circuit courts and the district 
courts by statute. See HRS § 603-21.5 (prescribing the 
jurisdiction of the circuit courts as including “[c]riminal offenses cognizable under the law of the State, committed within 
their respective circuits”); HRS § 604-8 (setting forth the 
narrower criminal jurisdiction of the district courts).
10 
HRS chapter 604 defines the criminal jurisdiction of 
the district courts.11 “District courts shall have jurisdiction 
10 “An offense defined by this Code or by any other statute of
this State for which a sentence of imprisonment is authorized constitutes a
crime.” HRS § 701- 107. 
11 See also  Haw. Const. art. I, § 14 (“In all criminal prosecutions, 
the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by animpartial jury of the district wherein the crime shall have been committed, 
which district shall have been previously ascertained by law . . 
 . .” 
(emphasis added)). 
- 10 -
 
 
 
  
                     
 
 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of, and their criminal jurisdiction is limited to, criminal 
offenses punishable by fine, or by imprisonment not exceeding 
one year whether with or without fine.” HRS § 604-8 (2001). 
District courts are empowered “to try without a jury, and to 
render judgment in all cases of criminal offenses coming within 
their respective jurisdictions.” HRS § 604-9.12 Additionally, 
the district courts are conferred authority to adjudicate 
violation of ordinances enacted by the counties.13 
In addition to defining district court criminal 
jurisdiction by the penalties that may be imposed for the offense, the legislature specifies that the district courts have 
jurisdiction of all criminal offenses “cognizable” under state 
law that occur within their respective circuits, subject to the 
penalties limitations set forth in HRS § 604-8: “The several 
district courts shall have jurisdiction, except as otherwise 
provided, of all criminal offenses cognizable under the laws of 
the State, committed within their respective circuits or transferred to them for trial by change of venue from some other 
district court.” HRS § 604-11.5 (1993) (emphasis added); 
see  
12   The district court’s criminal jurisdiction over a case terminates
when a defendant exercises a  right to jury trial.  HRS §  604-8(a); see  infra  
note 15.  
13 “Jurisdiction is conferred upon the district courts to try all
cases arising from the violation of ordinances in force in the counties and 
to impose the penalties in such ordinances prescribed for such offenses in
like manner as their original jurisdiction is exercised under the general
law.” HRS § 604-11 (1993). 
- 11 -
 
 
                     
  
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
also HRS § 603-21.5 (providing that the circuit courts have 
jurisdiction of criminal offenses “cognizable under the laws of 
the State” (emphasis added)). 
Cognizable means “[c]apable of being known or 
recognized,” or “[c]apable of being judicially tried or examined 
before a designated tribunal; within the court’s jurisdiction.” 
Black’s Law Dictionary  316 (10th ed. 2014). “A court has 
subject matter jurisdiction over a case if it is authorized to take cognizance of, try, and determine a case involving that 
subject matter.” State v. Alagao, 77 Hawaiʻ i 260, 262, 883 P.2d 
682, 684 (App. 1994) (citing Coleman v. Coleman, 5 Haw. 300 
(Haw. Kingdom 1885)).
14     
Therefore, the criminal jurisdiction of the district 
courts is defined and limited by grant of the legislature. As defined by HRS Chapter 604, the jurisdiction of the district 
14 “Cognizable” has been applied by the United States Supreme Court
in addressing a court’s jurisdiction. In Lamar v. United States,  240 U.S. 60
(1916), Justice Holmes stated that “nothing can be clearer than that the
district court, which has jurisdiction of all crimes cognizable under theauthority of the United States . . . , acts equally within its jurisdiction.”  
240 U.S. at 64- 65 (emphases added).  Similarly, in United States v. Williams, 
341 U.S. 58 (1951), the Court used the concept of cognizable to distinguish
between cases where subject- matter jurisdiction existed versus where it did 
not. Where jurisdiction was lacking, the Court found that “[t]he kind of
judicial controversies presented for adjudication . . . were [sic] not
cognizable by the respective courts.” 341 U.S. at 67. In the case before 
it, however, the Court ruled that the district court had jurisdiction because
federal statutes independently prohibited the conduct at issue: “We have a
court empowered to take cognizance of the crime . . . and decide the issues under that statute.” 
Id. at 68. 
Under Lamar  and Williams, jurisdiction is 
the power granted by law to adjudicate crimes defined by other law; suchcrimes are said to be “cognizable” by the adjudicating entity.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
courts encompasses crimes established by law that are punishable 
by fine or by fine and imprisonment of not more than a year, and 
that occur within the court’s respective circuit or that are 
properly transferred by a change of venue. If the requirements 
of HRS Chapter 604 are satisfied, jurisdiction of the district 
court is invoked by the charging instrument. 
2.
	 The OVUII charge invoked the jurisdiction of the district
court 
The complaint charged Schwartz with OVUII under HRS § 
291E-61(a).15 Count One of the complaint stated as follows: 
That on or about the 26th day of January, 2008, in the
Division of Lahaina, County of Maui, State of Hawaii,
SANDRA KAY SCHWARTZ did operate or assume actual physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence of an 
intoxicant meaning that she was under the influence of
alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair her normal mental faculties or ability to care for herself and guard against
casualty, thereby committing the offense of Operating a
Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant in violation 
of Section 291E- 61 (a) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes. 
The charge indicated the location and date of the 
offense, the defendant, and the statute that Schwartz allegedly 
violated. The charged OVUII offense is “known” and recognized 
as a crime under HRS § 291E-61; the offense was punishable by a 
15 At the time of Schwartz’s offense, HRS § 291E- 61 provided the 
following as a sentence for a first offense: fourteen hours of a “substance
abuse rehabilitation program,” a 90- day suspension of license, and a $25 
neurotrauma special fund surcharge. HRS § 291E-61 (2007).  In addition, the
court could impose one or more of the following: 72 hours of communityservice, “not less than forty- eight hours and not more than five days of 
imprisonment,” and a “fine of not less than $150 but not more than $1,000.”Id. 
Based on the maximum potential sentence, Schwartz did not have the right
to a jury trial. See  State v. Nakata , 76 Hawai‘ i 360, 367, 878 P.2d 699, 706 
(1994). 
- 13 -
 
 
 
Davis,***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
fine and by imprisonment not exceeding one year; and the offense 
was alleged to have occurred in Lāhainā, which is within the 
Second Circuit. The required components of HRS §§ 604-8 and 
604-11.5 were thus met. Consequently, the district court had 
subject-matter jurisdiction over the January 26, 2008 OVUII 
charge; that is, the district court had the power to hear and 
judicially dispose of the OVUII charge brought against Schwartz. 
Count One also set forth the elements of the crime as 
defined by HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), but it did not state that the offense took place on a public road. Thus, the charge failed to 
allege an element of the crime of OVUII as established by HRS 
§ 291E-61(a)(1). 
3.	 Failure to charge an element does not deprive a court of
subject-matter jurisdiction 
This court has implicitly rejected the proposition 
that a charging instrument that fails to allege an element or the requisite mens rea of an otherwise cognizable crime renders 
the trial court without criminal jurisdiction. In State v. 
 133 Hawai
ʻi 102, 324 P.3d 912 (2014), we considered 
whether an appellate court must address a defendant’s express claim of insufficiency of evidence prior to remanding a case for 
dismissal because of a defective charge. 
Id. at 118, 324 P.3d 
at 928. The defendant in that case appealed his conviction following trial, contending, inter alia, that (1) the charge was 
- 14 -

 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
defective because the State failed to allege a culpable state of 
mind as required and (2) there was insufficient evidence to 
support the conviction. Id. at 110, 324 P.3d at 920. The ICA 
agreed that the charge was defective and accordingly remanded the case to the district court to dismiss the case without 
prejudice; however, the ICA did not consider the sufficiency of 
the evidence. Id. The defendant sought review in this court of 
the ICA’s failure to consider the sufficiency of the evidence, 
arguing that double jeopardy barred retrial if the evidence 
adduced at trial was insufficient to sustain the conviction. 
Id. 
We held that an appellate court is required to address 
a defendant’s expressed claim of insufficiency of the evidence 
before remanding a case for dismissal based on a defective 
charge. Id. at 120, 324 P.3d at 930. The holding in Davis 
treated a charge that is deficient for failing to allege a state of mind the same as one that fails to allege an element: 
“A 
defective or faulty indictment or charge,” whether based on a 
failure to allege the mens rea or based upon the omission of an 
element, is a “trial error.” Id. at 116 n.14, 324 P.3d at 926 
n.14 (internal quotation marks omitted). 
The Davis court noted, 
“It is well-settled that, even where this court finds trial 
error, challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence must always 
be decided on appeal.” Id. at 116, 324 P.3d at 926 (emphasis 
- 15 -
 
 
 
Rice,***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
altered) (quoting State v. Kalaola, 124 Hawaiʻ i 43, 59, 237 P.3d 
1109, 1125 (2010)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Therefore, 
Davis’s treatment of trial error in relation to a 
flawed charge did not depend upon the nature of the charging 
defect. 
The primary holding of 
Davis--that the appellate court 
must consider the sufficiency of the evidence when it is raised 
on appeal prior to remanding a case for dismissal as a result of 
a defective charge--is incompatible with treating a defective 
charge as depriving the court of the power to hear the case. 
It is axiomatic that if a lower court is found to have 
lacked jurisdiction, we have jurisdiction on appeal, not of
the merits, but for the purpose of correcting an error in
jurisdiction.  If an insufficient charge constituted a
jurisdictional defect, then this court could not evaluate
whether sufficient evidence existed before the trial court 
inasmuch as it would not have jurisdiction over the merits
of the case.

Therefore, Davis is irreconcilable with a rule 
that a court is deprived of subject-matter jurisdiction by a charging instrument that fails to allege a culpable state of 
mind or an element of the crime charged. If the court’s jurisdiction had been abrogated by the defective charge, the 
trial proceedings would be void and the appellate court would be

unable to consider whether the evidence was sufficient to 
support a conviction. 
4. Prior decisions are generally consistent with Davis 
This court’s prior decisions are generally consistent 
with a rule that a charging instrument that fails to allege either the mens rea or an element of a crime, while potentially 
a significant violation of the defendant’s right to due process, 
does not deprive the court of its power to adjudicate a crime 
over which the legislature has granted the court jurisdiction. 
In State v. Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 279, 567 P.2d 1242 
(1977), this court characterized an insufficient charge as a 
“failure to state an offense” and characterized a conviction 
based on such a charge as a “denial of due process.” Id. at 
281, 567 P.2d at 1244. “Not only does [the complaint] fail to 
state an offense, but it also fails to meet the requirement that 
an accused must be informed of the ‘nature and cause of the 
accusation’ against him.” Id. (quoting Territory v. Yoshimura, 
35 Haw. 324, 327 (Haw. Terr. 1940)). 
Despite finding the charge 
“fatally defective,” id., Jendrusch does not describe the 
defective charge as precluding the subject-matter jurisdiction 
of the court. Rather, the principal error recognized by Jendrusch was that the complaint failed to state the requisite 
intent and an element of conduct of the offense charged. Id. at 
281-82, 567 P.2d at 1244-45 (noting that the complaint failed to 
- 17 -

 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
allege the prescribed intent and that the relevant speech was 
likely to provoke a violent response). Therefore, Jendrusch 
addressed the defendant’s lack of notice of the nature and cause 
of the charge against him and not the power of the court to hear 
the case. 
In State v. Elliott
, 77 Hawaiʻ i 309, 884 P.2d 372 
(1994), this court also did not use the term “jurisdiction” 
regarding a deficient charging instrument. The State failed to 
allege that the defendant intentionally prevented a police 
officer from effectuating an arrest with respect to a resisting 
arrest charge. Also, in regard to an assault against a police 
officer charge, the State did not allege that the assault was against a police officer in the line of duty. 
Id. at 311, 884 
P.2d at 374. 
Citing Jendrusch,  Elliott states that “the failure to 
allege an essential element of an offense ma[kes] a charge ‘fatally defective,’” id., and “constitute[s] a denial of due 
process,.” id. (quoting Jendrusch, 58 Haw. at 281, 567 P.2d at 
1244. Elliott then examined the charge to determine if it could 
reasonably be construed to allege an included crime. 
Id.
 at 
312, 884 P.2d at 375. The court concluded that the assault against a police officer charge could be construed to charge 
assault in the third degree but that the resisting arrest charge 
- 18 -
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
could not be construed to charge an included offense. Id. at 
313, 884 P.2d at 376. 
Accordingly, the case was remanded for entry of 
conviction of assault in the third degree and for dismissal of 
the resisting arrest charge. Id. If the defective charge had 
deprived the trial court of its power to adjudicate the assault offense, there would have been no basis on which this court 
could direct the trial court to enter conviction for the lesser included offense--the conviction for assault against a police 
officer would simply have been a nullity and the court would 
have vacated the judgment and remanded the case for dismissal. 
Therefore, as Elliott
 addressed the merits of the assault charge 
and examined relevant facts of the case, it is consistent with the rule that a charge, defective for failure to allege an 
element of an offense or a requisite mens rea, does not deprive 
the court of subject-matter jurisdiction conferred by statute. 
In 
State v. Israel,  78 Hawaiʻ i 66, 890 P.2d 203 (1994), 
the State appealed the circuit court’s dismissal of a charge of 
the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. The defendant had successfully moved to have the charge dismissed 
for failure to allege the underlying felony. Id. at 69, 890 
P.2d at 306. The court held that the failure of the State to allege the predicate felony resulted in a failure to adequately 
inform the defendant of the nature and cause of the crime

charged, in violation of article I, section 14 of the Hawaiʻ i 
Constitution. Id. at 71, 890 P.2d at 308. The Israel
 court 
concluded that “the principle of fundamental fairness, essential 
to the concept of due process of law, dictates that the 
defendant in a criminal action should not be relegated to a 
position from which he or she must speculate as to what crime he 
or she will have to meet in defense.” Id. (alterations omitted) 
(quoting Kreck v. Spalding, 721 F.2d 1229, 1233 (9th Cir.)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also id. at 73—75, 890 
P.2d at 310—12 (characterizing a defective charge as a failure 
of due process and citing Elliott, Jendrusch, and Territory v. 
Yoshimura,
 35 Haw. 324, 328 (Haw. Terr. 1940)).16 Therefore, the 
court affirmed the dismissal. 
 at 76, 890 P.2d at 313. 
Israel does not refer to jurisdiction in discussing the failure 
of the charging document; thus, the decision is also consistent 
16 In Yoshimura,  the court held that a grand jury indictment was 
sufficient if the information  clearly and distinctly sets 
forth the offense charged in ordinary and concise language,
in such manner as to enable a person of common
understanding to know what is intended, and with such a
degree of certainty as to enable the court to pronounce
judgment  of conviction according to the right of the case.  
Yoshimura,
 35 Haw. at 331 (internal quotation mark omitted).  The court found 
that one charge was legally insufficient for “merely” using “the language ofthe statute and [fell] short of apprising the defendant of the nature and
cause of the accusation against him as required by the sixth amendment to the
Constitution of the United States.” 
Id. at 327
-28.  The court found that 
another charge was not defective and accordingly reinstated the indictment
against the defendant but only on the sufficient charge. Id. at 332. The 
decision does not suggest any impairment of jurisdiction.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
with the rule that a charging instrument that fails to allege an 
element of the crime charged does not deprive a court of its 
subject-matter jurisdiction. 
In State v Sprattling,  99 Hawaiʻ i 312, 317, 55 P.3d 
276, 282 (2002), the defendant was orally charged with assault 
in the third degree, but the State failed to allege “bodily 
injury,” alleging only “injury” instead. Id. at 317, 55 P.3d at 
281. Sprattling  describes a defective charge as “encroach[ing] 
upon a defendant’s constitutional rights,” but not as 
encroaching upon the power of the court to adjudicate the crime 
charged. Id. at 318, 55 P.3d at 282. “The onus is on the 
prosecution to inform the accused fully of the accusations 
presented against him or her because [of] ‘the principle of 
fundamental fairness[] essential to the concept of due process 
of law . . . .’” Id. (alteration omitted) (quoting Israel, 78 
Hawaiʻi at 71, 890 P.2d at 308).  The majority in Sprattling did 
not use the term “jurisdiction” in reference to the alleged 
defect of the charge.17 This decision is therefore also 
consistent with the rule that a charge that omits an element of an offense is a trial error but not one that vitiates the 
jurisdiction of the court granted by statute.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawaiʻ i 48, 276 P.3d 617 
(2012), this court again reviewed the sufficiency of a charge 
and did not describe an insufficient charge in terms of jurisdiction. Id. at 52, 276 P.3d at 621. The defendants in 
Nesmith 
 were charged with OVUII under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and 
(a)(3), but challenged their convictions on the grounds that the 
charge in their respective cases failed to allege the mens rea. 
This court determined that under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), the 
“sufficient to impair” alternative of the offense,18 the State 
was required to prove a culpable state of mind that must be alleged in the complaint. Id. However, under HRS § 291E­
61(a)(3), the court determined that the alternative of “with .08 
or more grams of alcohol” per two hundred ten liters of breath 
was a strict liability offense that did not require the State to 
prove a culpable state of mind. Id. at 53, 276 P.3d at 622. 
Thus, as the charges relating to the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) alternative did not require the State to allege the mens rea, 
the decision in 
Nesmith upheld the convictions of both 
18 HRS § 291E-61(a) contains four subsections delineating forms of 
conduct or circumstances that comprise the offense of OVUII: (1) while under
the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair the person’s
normal mental faculties or ability to care for the person and guard againstcasualty; (2) while under the influence of any drug that impairs the person’s
ability to operate the vehicle in a careful and prudent manner; (3) with .08
or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of breath; or (4) with
.08 or more grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters
of blood. HRS § 291E-61(a).  Conviction of the single offense of OVUII under
HRS § 291E– 61(a) can be based on any, or any combination, of the subsections.  
Nesmith, 127 Hawaiʻ i at 50 n.5, 276 P.3d at 619 n.5.

defendants, but the court also concluded that the respective 
charges failed to allege the requisite state of mind for the 
“sufficient to impair” alternative under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1). 
Id. at 61, 276 P.3d at 630. 
As is significant in the current context, Nesmith did 
not describe the failure to allege the mens rea as a defect that 
deprived the court of its subject-matter jurisdiction. Instead, 
the decision describes the defect as “a failure to state an offense, and a conviction based upon it cannot be sustained, for 
that would constitute a denial of due process.” 
Id. at 53, 276 
P.3d at 622. Thus, 
Nesmith is consistent with the rule that a 
charge that fails to allege the requisite mens rea does not 
deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction. 
Similarly, in  State v. Apollonio,  130 Hawaiʻ i 353, 358, 
311 P.3d 676, 681 (2013), this court considered the sufficiency 
of an excessive speeding charge that failed to allege a culpable 
state of mind.  described the insufficient charge not 
as a defect that deprives a court of its subject-matter jurisdiction, but as a denial of due process. “[W]e adhere to this core principle: A charge that fails to charge a requisite 
state of mind cannot be construed reasonably to state an offense 
and thus the charge is dismissed without prejudice because it

violates due process.”19 Id. at 359, 311 P.3d at 682 (citing 
Elliott, 77 Hawai i at 313, 884 P.2d at 376; Nesmith, 127 Hawai i 
at 56, 276 P.3d at 625). Therefore, Apollonio is also 
consistent with the rule that a charge that fails to allege the 
mens rea or an element of a crime is a due process violation, 
but such omission does not eliminate a court’s jurisdiction 
established by statute over a cognizable criminal offense. 
While the majority of our cases have not treated a 
charge that omits an element or the requisite mens rea as a 
defect that eliminates a court’s subject-matter jurisdiction, 
two cases have characterized such defects as jurisdictional 
flaws. These cases state that the defective charge is a violation of due process and deprives the court of 
“jurisdiction.” However, both cases appear not to have fully 
applied a subject-matter jurisdiction analysis as reflected in 
the disposition or other rulings rendered in those cases. See 
Adams, 103 Hawaiʻ i at 220-21, 81 P.3d at 400-01 (“[J]urisdiction

that it be dismissed without prejudice.  Id. at 358, 311 P.3d at 681.  The 
majority opinion did not undertake an analysis of the jurisdiction of the
trial court. 
The minority, however, analyzed the defendant’s argument that
the insufficient charge deprived the court of jurisdiction and concluded that
“an insufficient charge does not constitute a jurisdictional defect.”
Apollonio, 130 Hawaiʻ i at 368, 311 P.3d at 691 (Recktenwald, C.J., concurring

prosecution.” (citing State v. Meyers,  72 Haw. 591, 593, 825

In State v. Cummings,  101 Hawaiʻ i 139, 63 P.3d 1109 
(2003), a defendant charged with OVUII argued “that the complaint failed to allege he was under the influence of 
intoxicating liquor ‘in an amount sufficient to impair the 
person’s normal mental faculties or ability to care for oneself 
and guard against casualty.’” 101 Hawaiʻ i at 142, 63 P.3d at 
1112 (emphasis deleted) (quoting HRS § 291-4(a)(1) (Supp. 
1999)). The Cummings court agreed that the complaint was 
“fatally defective” and stated that “the district court lacked 
subject matter jurisdiction to preside over the prosecution’s DUI case against [the defendant].” Id. at 145, 63 P.3d at 1115. 
Therefore, Cummings concluded that the prosecution’s case-in­chief “was a nullity.”

Cummings  to be consistent with a theory that a charge failing to 
allege an element of the offense deprives the court of 
jurisdiction, the charge should have been dismissed or the case 
remanded to the lower court for dismissal.20 
In State v. Walker , 126 Hawaiʻ i 47 5, 273 P.3d 1161 
(2012), the court examined the conviction of the defendant for 
habitually operating a vehicle under the influence of an 
intoxicant (habitual offense). Id. at 478, 273 P.3d at 1164. 
The State failed to allege an element of the crime, namely, that the defendant was convicted of OVUII three or more times within 
ten years. Id. at 486, 273 P.3d at 1172. 
Walker
 states that “a 
charge must sufficiently allege an offense in order to properly 
confer jurisdiction upon the presiding court.” Id. at 489, 273 
P.3d at 1175). The Walker
 decision concluded that the lack of 
subject-matter jurisdiction was fatal to the original charge. 
Id. at 492 n.26, 273 P.3d at 1178 n.26. 
20 Cummings  cited to Territory v. Gora, 37 Haw. 1 (Haw. Terr. 1944), 
as support for its conclusion that a charge that does not state all the
essential elements of an offense contains a jurisdictional defect. Cummings,
101 Hawaiʻ i at 142, 63 P.3d at 1112. However, a contrasting analysis is also 
evident in 
Gora, in which the court characterized the failure to state an 
offense in a charge as a “jurisdictional point.” 37 Haw. at 6. The court 
concluded that the defendant did not argue that the charge did not state anoffense and cited no authorities that would have supported such a contention.
Id. 
Consequently, the  Gora court concluded that the defendant had abandoned 
the jurisdictional issue, but the court nevertheless found that the chargewas sufficient. 
Id. As lack of jurisdiction is not subject to abandonment
or waiver, 
Adams, 103 Hawaiʻ i at 221, 81 P.3d at 401, the determination that 
the charge was sufficient is in conflict with a rule that a deficient
indictment is a “jurisdictional point.” 
- 26 -
 
 
  
                     
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
However, Walker also determined that lack of 
jurisdiction over the habitual offense could not be “cured” by 
remand to the lower court to enter judgment under a lesser 
included OVUII offense because the charge for the habitual 
offense failed to allege the public-road element that an OVUII 
charge would have required. Id. at 492, 273 P.3d at 1178. The 
analysis in Walker seemingly indicates that, while jurisdiction may be lacking for a charged offense, it might nonetheless be present for a lesser included offense. But if jurisdiction is 
truly absent, the court is without authority to allow the 
prosecution to proceed upon a lesser included offense. 
Further, the 
Walker opinion went on to analyze the 
defendant’s argument that statements to a police officer and the 
results of a field sobriety test should have been suppressed.21 
Id. at 492, 273 P.3d at 1178. Under the rule that every 
judgment on the merits in a proceeding is invalid if it is later 
determined that the court lacked jurisdiction, Meyers, 72 Haw. at 593, 825 P.2d at 1064, the question of whether evidence was 
properly admitted by the trial court was not subject to 
21 Walker  found that “where there is a wealth of overwhelming and 
compelling evidence tending to show the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt, . . . errors in the admission or exclusion of evidence are deemed
harmless.” Id. at 493, 273 P.3d at 1178 (alteration omitted) (quoting State 
v. Toyomura,
 80 Hawai i 8, 27, 904 P.2d 893, 912 (1995)) (internal quotation

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
appellate review once the Walker court ostensibly determined 
that jurisdiction was lacking.22
As treatment of the merits of a case by a trial or 
appellate court is inconsistent with a lack of subject-matter 
jurisdiction, Cummings and Walker appear not to have fully 
applied a subject-matter jurisdiction analysis. In any event, 
our more recent decisions in 
Davis, Apollonio, and Nesmith have 
implicitly rejected an approach in which a charge, information, 
or indictment that fails to allege either the requisite mental 
22   It is noted that the statement in State v. Morin, 71 Haw. 159,
785 P.2d 1316 (1990), that “[g]enerally, a guilty plea .   .  . precludes a 
defendant from later asserting any nonjurisdictional   claims” but that “the 
defendant may still challenge the sufficiency of the indictment or other like 
defects bearing directly upon the government’s authority to compel the 
defendant to answer to charges in court,” 71 Haw. at 162, 785 P.2d at 1318 
(emphasis added), could be construed to suggest that a charging instrument 
that fails to allege an element or the requisite mens rea renders the trial 
court without jurisdiction.  However, the charging instrument in Morin   was 
not deficient; it did not fail to allege an element or the requisite mens  
rea. Further, the authorities cited by Morin  do not appear to assert that a 
charge that fails to allege an element deprives the court of jurisdiction, 
see id.   (citing 1A Charles Alan Wright et al., Fed. Prac. & Proc. Crim.   §  175 
(1969)), or did not involve a deficient charging instrument, see  State v.  
Lerner, 551 P.2d 553 (Ariz. 1976).  Thus, Morin  does not provide authority 
for the proposition that a charging instrument failing to charge an element  
of the offense invariably deprives the court of jurisdiction.    Cases that 
cite Morin’s language regarding challenges to the sufficiency of the 
indictment do not discuss charging instruments that omit an element or the 
mens rea of an offense, see  Adams, 103 Hawaiʻ i at 224, 81 P.3d at 404 (defect  
in indictment alleging crimes outside the period of the statute of limitation  
was nonjurisdictional), or do not involve a defective indictment,  see  State 
v. Rauch,  94 Hawaiʻ i 315, 316, 13 P.3d 324, 325 (2000) (jurisdictional issues
raised on appeal unrelated to sufficiency of charging instrument); State v.
Dudoit, 90 Hawaiʻ i 262, 263, 978 P.2d 700, 701 (1999) (appeal of a sentence).  
Accordingly, Morin is more appropriately construed to mean that a 
defendant, who has pled guilty or nolo contendere, is not barred from
challenging the sufficiency of the charging instrument if the alleged defectgoes to the subject- matter jurisdiction of the court.  See  infra  
note 42 
for 
a non-exhaustive list of defects in a charging instrument that are 
jurisdictional in nature.

state or an element of the offense deprives a trial court of 
subject-matter jurisdiction. To the extent that Cummings and 
Walker proceeded upon this premise, they have been superseded, 
and their rulings as to subject-matter jurisdiction are no 
longer controlling. 
B.
	 Under federal law, an omission of an element from a charge
does not deprive the court of jurisdiction 
Recently decided federal law is consistent with the 
decisions of this court as reflected by Jendrusch and subsequent 
cases such as Nesmith
, Apollonio, and Davis. 
In United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625 (2002), the 
United States Supreme Court rejected the contention that a 
charging instrument that failed to allege an element of the 
crime “deprive[s] a court of its power to adjudicate” a criminal 
case. Id. at 630. Following a jury trial, the defendants were 
convicted of drug charges under an indictment that did not allege sufficient quantities of contraband that would support 
enhanced penalties. Id.
 at 628. Nonetheless, the trial court 
applied the enhanced penalties when imposing sentence.23 Id. On 
review, the court of appeals vacated the enhanced sentences due 
23 The Court noted that the imposition of the enhanced sentences was 
in violation of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000). Cotton , 535 U.S 
at 632. However, as the defendants in Cotton had neglected to object to the 
omission of enhancement language in the indictment during the sentencing
proceeding, the Court reviewed the sentences for plain error. Id. No error 
was found as the Court concluded that the evidence admitted at trial 
overwhelmingly demonstrated a sufficient quantity of contraband to support
the enhanced penalties. Id.

    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to lack of jurisdiction: “an indictment setting forth all the 
essential elements of an offense is both mandatory and 
jurisdictional”; thus, “a court is without jurisdiction to . . . 
impose a sentence for an offense not charged in the indictment.” 
Id. at 629 (emphasis omitted) (quoting United States v. Cotton, 
261 F.3d 397, 404-05 (4th Cir. 2001)) (internal quotation mark omitted). 
The Supreme Court reversed, expressly overruling its 
decision in 
Ex parte Bain , 121 U.S. 1 (1887), “the progenitor” 
of the view that a defective indictment necessarily deprives a 
court of jurisdiction. Cotton, 535 U.S. at 629–31. The Court 
found that Bain was “a product of an era” that “led to a somewhat expansive notion of ‘jurisdiction,’” which was “more a 
fiction than anything else.” Id. at 629-30 (quoting Custis v. 
United States, 511 U.S. 485, 494 (1994); Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 79 (1977)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The 
Court indicated that the nineteenth century “concept of jurisdiction is not what the term ‘jurisdiction’ means today, 
i.e., ‘the courts’ statutory or constitutional power to 
adjudicate the case.’” Id. at 630 (emphasis added and 
omitted).
24 “This latter concept of subject-matter jurisdiction, 
24 The historical reason for the expansive view of jurisdiction was
explained by the Cotton Court, which characterized Ex parte Bain  as “a 
product of an era in which this Court’s authority to review criminal
convictions was greatly circumscribed.” Cotton, 535 U.S at 629.  It could

because it involves a court’s power to hear a case, can never be 
forfeited or waived.” Id. 
To explain the difference between a “defect” that 
might deprive a court of subject-matter jurisdiction and one 
that would not, the Cotton Court cited Lamar v. United States, 
240 U.S. 60 (1916), in which the Court rejected the claim that 
“the court had no jurisdiction because the indictment does not 
charge a crime against the United States.” Cotton, 535 U.S. at 
630 (quoting 
Lamar, 240 U.S. at 64) (internal quotation marks 
omitted). In Lamar, Justice Holmes stated, “Jurisdiction is a matter of power, and covers wrong as well as right decisions.” 
240 U.S. at 64-65 (citing Fauntleroy v. Lum, 210 U.S. 230, 234 
(1908); Burnet v. Desmornes y Alvarez, 226 U.S. 145, 147 
(1912)). 
A decision that a patent is bad, either on the facts or on
the law, is as binding as one that it is good. And nothing 
can be clearer than that the district court, which has jurisdiction of all crimes cognizable under the authorityof the United States, acts equally within its jurisdiction
whether it decides a man to be guilty or innocent under thecriminal law, and whether its decision is right or wrong.
The objection that the indictment does not charge a crime
against the United States goes only to the merits of thecase.

examine constitutional errors in a criminal trial only on a writ of habeas
corpus, and only then if it deemed the error “jurisdictional.” 
(internal 
quotation marks omitted). “The Court’s desire to correct obvious 
constitutional violations led to a ‘somewhat expansive notion of jurisdiction 
. . . .’” Id. (quoting Custis v. United States , 511 U.S. 485, 494 (1994)) 
(internal quotation marks omitted).

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Id. at 64-65 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Thus, 
Justice Holmes’ analysis concludes that whether the charging 
instrument is sufficient or insufficient goes to the merits of 
the particular case–-including whether the case is correctly or 
wrongly decided–-but does not deprive the federal district court 
of cognizance of the crime in the first instance, nor of the 
power to adjudicate that crime. See also Cotton, 535 U.S. at 
631 (quoting United States v. Williams, 341 U.S. 58, 66 (1951), 
for its holding that a defective indictment “does not affect the 
jurisdiction of the trial court to determine the case presented 
by the indictment”). Under Cotton, Lamar, and Williams, 
criminal subject-matter jurisdiction is the power granted by a 
legislative body to adjudicate certain crimes. These cases hold 
that an indictment that is defective for failing to charge an 
element of the offense does not deprive a court of its 
legislatively granted power. 
Similarly, in United States v. Brown,  752 F.3d 1344 
(11th Cir. 2014), the Eleventh Circuit noted that the Cotton decision and its own case law were in accordance with a rule 
that “an omission of an element from an indictment does not 
deprive the district court of jurisdiction.” 
Id.
 at 1351. 
Brown
 found that to determine “whether an indictment defect is 
jurisdictional, we must ask the question  whether the indictment 
charged the defendant with a criminal ‘offense against the laws 
- 32 -

 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of the United States.’” Id. (alteration omitted) (emphasis 
added). 
The district court’ s power over [the] case did not vanish 
simply because the indictment omitted one element of the
charged offense. The omission of an element may render the
indictment insufficient, but it does not strip the district
court of jurisdiction over the case. 
So long as the indictment charges the defendant withviolating a valid federal statute as enacted in the United
States Code, it alleges an 
“offense against the laws of the 
United States” and, thereby, invokes the district court’ s 
subject- matter jurisdiction.   The omission of an element of 
that offense does not mean that the indictment fails to do 
so; it means only that the indictment is missing an
“allegation requisite to liability.” This may allow the 
defendant to argue before a guilty plea that the indictment
is insufficient and should be dismissed — but it does not 
deprive the district court of jurisdiction to act over theindictment or to accept a guilty plea. 
Id. at 1353-54 (emphases added) (citations omitted) (quoting 
Alikhani v. United States, 200 F.3d 732, 734-35 (11th Cir. 
2000); United States v. Peter, 310 F.3d 709, 715 (11th Cir. 
2002)). Thus, it is clear that under federal law, the omission 
of an element of the charged offense in an indictment does not 
deprive the court of jurisdiction over the case. 
C. The omission of the public-road element from the OVUII
charge did not eliminate subject-matter jurisdiction 
Schwartz has argued that the trial court lacked 
jurisdiction over the OVUII offense because the charging instrument failed to allege an essential element of the offense. Based on the holdings of this court in 
Jendrusch  through Nesmith 
and Davis, it is clear that a charging instrument that fails to allege a culpable state of mind or an element of an offense may

    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
result in a significant violation of due process, but the flawed 
instrument does not abrogate the jurisdiction of the court, 
which is established by statute and invoked by a charge of a 
cognizable offense prescribed by law.25 Here, as noted, the 
district court had jurisdiction over the OVUII charge under HRS §§ 604-8 and 604-11.5. Thus, the failure of the charging 
instrument to fully allege the elements of the crime of OVUII as 
set forth in HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) did not negate the charge’s fulfillment of the requirements under HRS Chapter 604 
establishing the jurisdiction of the district court. 
Consequently, Schwartz’s contention that the district court 
lacked jurisdiction of the OVUII charge against her is 
incorrect. 
D. 
Analysis in Christian v. State is flawed 
Christian v. State , 131 Hawai
ʻi 153, 315 P.3d 779 (App. 
2013), provided the basis for the ICA’s decision in the present case.
26 See Schwartz,  No. CAAP-10-0000199 at *1 (affirming the 
order denying Schwartz’s petition “on the basis explained today 
25 A charging instrument may be so deficient that a court does not
have jurisdiction over the case; for instance, if the charging document was
never filed. See State v. Kaulia
, 128 Hawaiʻ i 479, 491, 291 P.3d 377, 389
(2013) (holding that because the State failed to properly file the complaint,
“the district court lacked jurisdiction to proceed to trial”).  Without 
deciding the matter, a charge that fails to fulfill the statutory
requirements of jurisdiction, see, e.g.,  HRS §§ 604-8 and 604- 11.5, in 
contrast to the due process failure to properly state an offense, would
appear to fail to confer jurisdiction upon the district court. 
26 Christian was decided prior to this court’s decision in Davis.

in Christian” ). The relevant facts in Christian are 
substantively indistinguishable from the facts in Schwartz’s 
case. See Christian
, 131 Hawaiʻ i at 155, 315 P.3d at 781.  The 
defendant pleaded no contest to a charge of OVUII in 2008. Id. 
In 2010, the defendant filed an HRPP Rule 40 petition seeking to 
have his judgment set aside on the basis that a “defect in the 
charge was jurisdictional, and therefore his judgment of 
conviction was a nullity” because the charge failed to allege 
the public-road element. Id. at 156, 315 P.3d at 782. The 
district court denied the petition, and the defendant appealed to the ICA. 
The ICA affirmed the denial on the grounds that 
although Wheeler created a new rule, the rule did not apply 
retroactively. Id. at 160, 315 P.3d at 786. The ICA reached 
this conclusion by looking at this court’s analysis in State v. 
Ruggiero, 114 Hawaiʻ i 227, 160 P.3d 703 (2007), and State v. 
Kekuewa, 114 Hawaiʻ i 411, 163 P.3d 1148 (2007), and noted that in 
both cases, the decisions determined that the complaint could 
reasonably be construed to allege the crime of OVUII. Id. at 
159, 315 P.3d at 785. 
The ICA reasoned that “by quoting the 
charges in  Ruggiero  and Kekuewa and then directing entry of 
judgment of conviction on the charges for OVUII as a first offense, [this court] implicitly held and concluded that the 
charges in 
Ruggiero
 and Kekuewa were sufficient to charge OVUII 
- 35 -
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
as a first offense.” Id.  at 160, 315 P.3d at 786. Therefore, 
the ICA concluded that, since Ruggiero and Kekuewa approved 
charging instruments that did not specifically allege a public-
road element, Wheeler’s requirement that the State must allege a 
public-road element “announced a new rule.” Id. 
Additionally, the ICA held that even if the new rule 
did apply retroactively, the defendant in Christian could not 
demonstrate exceptional circumstances to overcome a “heightened 
interest in finality that attaches to cases on collateral 
review.” Id.
 at 156, 315 P.3d at 782. 
1. Guiding Principles in the Creation of New Rules 
“[W]hen questions of state law are at issue, state 
courts generally have the authority to determine the 
retroactivity of their own decisions.” State v. Garcia,  96 
Hawaiʻi 200, 211, 29 P.3d 919, 930 (2001) (quoting Am. Trucking 
Ass’ns, Inc. v. Smith, 496 U.S. 167, 177 (1990) (plurality opinion)) (internal quotation marks). The prototypical manner 
in which this court creates a new rule is when it overrules a 
previous decision and announces a superseding principle of law. 
See State v. Jess,
 117 Hawaiʻ i 381, 398—99, 184 P.3d 133, 150—51 
(2008); see also James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia,  501 
U.S.
 529, 534 (1991) (the paradigm case of nonretroactivity 
arises “when a court expressly overrules a precedent upon which 
- 36 -
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the contest would otherwise be decided differently and by which 
the parties may previously have regulated their conduct”). 
In Jess, this court considered the continued viability 
of the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction between facts that must 
be alleged in charging an individual with a crime. Jess, 117 
Hawaiʻi at 393—94, 184 P.3d at 145—46.  At the time 
Jess
 was 
decided, the rule was that aggravating circumstances must be 
alleged by the State in the charging instrument and submitted to 
the jury for its consideration,  State v. Apao,  59 Haw. 625, 634, 
586 P.2d 250, 257 (1978), unless such circumstances constitute extrinsic facts--those that have no bearing on the issue of 
guilt, State v. Huelsman, 60 Haw. 71, 79, 588 P.2d 394, 400 (1978). 
This court, in 
Jess
, held that “the 
intrinsic/extrinsic distinction has lost its viability to the 
extent that it governs charging procedure and . . . decline to 
follow it any further.” Id. at 398, 184 P.3d at 150. The 
result was to reverse the Huelsman qualification and cases reaffirming it, and revert to the original rule that requires all aggravating circumstances, regardless of whether they are 
intrinsic or extrinsic in nature, to be alleged when charging a 
crime. 
Id.
 at 398, 184 P.3d at 150. 
Finding that the rule it announced was a new rule 
because it expressly overruled cases that distinguished between

v. Cuevas, 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
extrinsic and intrinsic facts when charging an individual with a 
crime, the Jess court then considered whether to accord the new 
rule with retroactive effect. Id. at 401, 184 P.3d at 153. 
Ultimately, this court concluded, after weighing considerations pertinent to the issue of retroactivity, that the new rule 
should be given only purely prospective application to avoid 
substantial prejudice to prosecutions and the courts. Id. at 
403, 184 P.3d at 155.
27 
Another classic situation in which this court 
establishes a new rule is when it announces a new principle of 
constitutional law, such as one applying to criminal 
prosecutions. In Tachibana v. State,  for example, we held that 
under the Hawaiʻ i Constitution, “trial courts must advise 
criminal defendants of their right to testify and must obtain an 
on-the-record waiver of that right in every case in which the 
27 Another case in which a new rule was created by overruling
precedent is State v. Ikezawa,  75 Haw. 210, 857 P.2d 593 (1993). In Ikezawa, 
this court reiterated that State v. Stone, 65 Haw. 308, 651 P.2d 485 (1982), 
was overruled by State v. Balauro, 73 Haw. 70, 828 P.2d 267 (1992), which
held that the six- month period under HRPP 48(b), within which a criminal 
trial must be commenced, is tolled when a later charge is the same or isrequired to be joined with the original charge. Ikezawa, 75 Haw. at 221— 22, 
857 P.2d at 598— 99.  The Ikezawa  court held that the principle stated in 
Balauro constituted a new rule and, after conducting a balancing test as to 
whether to apply the new rule retroactively, found that purely prospective
application was more appropriate. Id.; see also  State v. Santiago, 53 Haw. 
254, 492 P.2d 657, 665— 67 (1971) (holding that this court’s decision in State 
53 Haw. 100, 488 P.2d 322 (1971), in which we invalidated a
statute imposing the burden upon a defendant to disprove the existence of
malice once the act of killing is proved by the prosecution and which
overruled cases that previously upheld the statute’s validity, announced a
new rule that should be accorded pipeline retroactive application).

defendant does not testify.” 79 Hawaiʻ i 226, 236 & n.7, 900 P.2d 
1293, 1303 & n.7 (1995). Hence, this court concluded that the 
Tachibana colloquy was a new rule and that it should be applied 
only prospectively.28 Id. at 238 & n.10, 900 P.2d at 1305 & 
n.10. 
In contrast, in instances where this court engages 
only in statutory construction to elucidate the meaning and 
application of specific provisions of a statute, we have held 
that a new rule does not arise. In Garcia v. State
, 125 Hawaiʻ i 
429, 263 P.3d 709 (2010), we examined whether our decision in 
State v. Tauiliili , 96 Hawaiʻ i 195, 29 P.3d 914 (2001), 
constituted an announcement of a new rule. Tauiliili 
interpreted HRS § 706-671 to mean that presentence imprisonment 
credit should be applied, in cases where a defendant is 
sentenced to consecutive terms, only to the aggregate term of 
the sentence. See id.
 at 199, 29 P.3d at 918. Until that 
point, the practice was to apply the presentence imprisonment 
28 The U.S. Supreme Court has also identified the following
instances in which it has created “an entirely new and unanticipated
principle of law”: where the (1) “ruling caused such an abrupt andfundamental shift in doctrine as to constitute an entirely new rule which in
effect replaced an older one”; (2) “disapproves a practice this Court
arguably has sanctioned in prior cases”; (3) “or overturns a longstanding and
widespread practice to which this Court has not spoken, but which a near-
unanimous body of lower court authority has expressly approved. United 
States v. Johnson,  457 U.S. 537, 551 (1982) (citations omitted) (internal
quotations marks omitted). 
The decision in Wheeler  does not fall under any 
of these categories. 
- 39 -
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
credit to each of the consecutive terms. See Garcia, 125 Hawaiʻ i 
at 443—44, 263 P.3d at 723—24. 
In Garcia, we stated that “Tauiliili
 was not a 
departure from precedent but, rather, confirmed the law as it 
existed prior to that decision.” Id. at 443, 263 P.3d at 723 
(citing Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U.S. 298, 312—13 (1994)). As such, we concluded that our holding in Tauiliili 
applied retroactively. 
Id. 
Finally, we have also held that where this court 
merely clarifies an existing legal principle, a new rule is not 
created. See State v. Ketchum
, 97 Hawaiʻ i 107, 114 n.26, 34 P.3d 
1006, 1013 n.26 (2001). In Ketchum, this court considered 
whether the principle announced in State v. Ah Loo, 94 Hawaiʻ i 
207, 10 P.3d 728 (2000), constituted a new rule. Ah Loo
 held 
that Miranda warnings must be administered “once a detainee 
becomes expressly or impliedly accused of having committed a 
crime—because the totality of the circumstances reflects either 
that probable cause to arrest the detainee has developed or that the officer’s questions have ‘become sustained and coercive.’” 
Ketchum, 97 Hawaiʻ i at 124, 34 P.3d at 1023 (quoting Ah Loo, 94 
Hawaii at 212, 10 P.3d at 733). We concluded that 
Ah Loo 
did 
not announce a new rule, but “merely clarified the existing 
proposition that a person temporarily and lawfully detained need 
- 40 -
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
not be given Miranda warnings until the moment of express or 
implied accusation has arrived.” Id. at 123 n.26, 34 P.3d at 
1022 n.26. 
2. Wheeler did not announce a new rule because it did not 
overrule Ruggiero or Kekuewa 
The ICA’s decision in Christian is predicated on its 
conclusion that this court implicitly ruled, in 
Ruggiero and 
Kekuewa, that a charge omitting the public-road element can nonetheless be reasonably construed to allege OVUII under HRS § 
291E-61(a). Christian, 131 Hawaiʻ i at 159—60, 315 P.3d at 785— 
86. In both Ruggiero and Kekuewa, at issue was the sufficiency 
of the charge in accusing the defendants of violating HRS § 
291E-61(a) and (b)(2) as second-time OVUII offenders. Ruggiero, 
114 Hawai
ʻi at 239, 160 P.3d at 715; Kekuewa, 114 Hawai
ʻi at 421— 
21; 163 P.3d at 1158—59. In both cases, we held that the charges were insufficient as a matter of law to accuse the 
defendants of violating HRS § 291E-61(a) and (b)(2) because they 
failed to allege the defendants’ respective prior OVUII 
conviction but that they could reasonably be construed to charge 
OVUII as a first offense under HRS § 291E-61(a) and (b)(1). 
Ruggiero, 114 Hawaiʻ i at 240, 160 
 P.3d at 716; Kekuewa, 114 
Hawaiʻi at 425—26, 163 P.3d at 1162—63.  
In Wheeler , the State argued that Ruggiero and Kekuewa 
established precedent that an OVUII charge lacking the public­

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
road element is not deficient. Wheeler, 121 Hawaiʻ i at 396, 219 
P.3d at 1183. This court disagreed, explaining that 
Ruggiero  and Kekuewa focused on whether a charge that 
failed to adequately allege that the defendant had a prior
OVUII conviction within the past five years was
nevertheless sufficient to charge a first- offense OVUII.  
Neither defendant raised the issue  of whether the 
proscribed conduct must take place “upon a public way,street, road, or highway” and, if so, whether it had been
adequately alleged in the charge. 
Id. at 399, 219 P.3d at 1186 (emphasis added). The Wheeler 
court reasoned that 
Ruggiero and Kekuewa “are limited to the 
issues that were actually decided by the court [in those cases], and are not dispositive of the distinct issue presented [in 
Wheeler, i.e., whether the public-road element must be alleged 
in the charging instrument.]” Id. at 399, 219 P.3d at 1186 
(citing Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S. 507, 511 (1925); E&J Lounge 
Operating Co., Inc. v. Liquor Comm’n of City & County of 
Honolulu, 118 Hawai i 320, 338, 189 P.3d 432, 450 (2008)).
29        
29 Additionally, the Wheeler  court reasoned that “Ruggiero and 
Kekuewa are factually distinguishable from the circumstances of [Wheeler].”  
Wheeler
, 121 Hawaiʻ i at 399, 219 P.3d at 1186. Because the defendants in both 
cases failed to make “a timely objection to the sufficiency of the OVUII
charge in the trial court,” id., the “Motta/ Wells post- conviction liberal 
construction rule” applied, id.  (quoting State v. Merino, 81 Hawai i 198, 212,
915 P.2d 672, 688 (1996)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under this analysis, a charging instrument is presumed valid, and a conviction will notbe reversed because of a defective charging instrument, unless the defendant
demonstrates prejudice or the complaint cannot be reasonably construed to
charge a crime. Id. at 399—400, 219 P.3d at 1186— 87.  In contrast, “because
Wheeler timely objected to the oral charge in the district court, theMotta/Wells analysis [wa]s not applicable [in Wheeler].”  Id. at 400, 219 
P.3d at 1187. This factual distinction between 
Wheeler
, on the one hand, and
Ruggiero  and Kekuewa, on the other--which essentially resulted in the 
application of differing analytical standards--was another reason why the 
court held in Wheeler  that Ruggiero  and Kekuewa were not governing precedent.  
Id.  
- 42 -
 
 
                     
   
  
 
 
   
 
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
As we recognized in Wheeler, our decisions in Ruggiero 
and 
Kekuewa did not hold that a charge accusing an individual of 
OVUII, in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a), is sufficient without 
the public-road element. The fact that this court in Ruggiero 
and Kekuewa did not address the public-road element was not 
equivalent to a holding that it was not a required element of 
OVUII; it meant only that the issues challenged in those cases 
provided neither a reason nor the necessity for this court to consider this element. See id. at 396, 219 P.3d at 1184 
(stating that Ruggiero and Kekuewa “do not require a contrary result”). 
Accordingly, our conclusion in Wheeler--that “HRS § 
291E–1 [requires] that the defendant’s conduct occur ‘upon a 
public way, street, road, or highway’”--was not a new rule, see 
Wheeler, 121 Hawai
ʻi at 392, 219 P.3d at 1179, because unlike 
Jess, Wheeler did not overrule or modify any previous precedent 
of this court dealing with the same issue.30 Cf. Jess, 117 
30 Nonetheless, according to the concurrence, “ Walker clarified that 
Wheeler did, in fact, render Ruggiero and Kekuewa  unreliable for the 
proposition that a defendant who is not given fair notice of the public roads 
element may . . . be convicted of OVUII as a first offense.” Concurrence at 
2
3.  
To support this assertion, the concurrence relies quite heavily on a
quote from  Walker stating that the “current essential elements that the State 
must include in an OVUII charge differ from those required in 2007 at the
time of the Ruggiero and Kekuewa decisions.”  Concurrence at 19 (quoting 
Walker, 126 Hawaiʻ i at 490, 273 P.3d at 1176). However, the validity of this
statement from Walker  is plainly problematic. 
Generally, a 
crime or offense is governed by the law existing at 
the time it was committed. See State v. Martin
, 62 Haw. 364, 370, 616 P.2d
(continued  .  .  .)

Hawaiʻi at 398, 184 P.3d at 150 (abandoning the

aggravating facts that must be alleged in a charging instrument). Wheeler had no need to overrule Ruggiero or

similar or analogous to the facts of Wheeler.

because the underlying act was committed before the effective date of thePenal Code). It naturally follows that a charge must be compliant with the governing law existing at the time the offense was committed. 
The underlying conduct that comprised the charged offense in
Wheeler occurred on May 
 31, 2007.  Wheeler, 121 Hawaiʻ i at 386— 87, 219 P.3d 
1170—74.  Hence, for charging purposes, the law that governed was the OVUII
statute as it existed in 2007. It is therefore inaccurate to say that theOVUII law post- Wheeler was any different than that existing pre- Wheeler, 
because the requirements set forth in Wheeler were themselves applied to a 
charge that dated back to 2007. Accordingly, the Walker quote is a 
misstatement (“essential elements that the State must include in an OVUII
charge differ from those required in 2007”).   
31 This court has previously applied Wheeler  retroactively in cases 
in which an OVUII charge lacked the public- road element without discussion of 
whether Wheeler announced a new rule. See 
Garcia
, 125 Hawaiʻ i at 443, 263
P.3d at 724 (holding that “retroactivity is assumed unless a ‘new rule’ is 
announced”). These post- Wheeler decisions include the following cases: State 
v. Tominiko,
 126 Hawaiʻ i 68, 76, 266 P.3d 1122, 1130 (2011) (applying  Wheeler, 
which was decided in November 2009, to an August 2008 complaint charging defendant with OVUII, and holding that under the liberal construction
standard, the charges, read with reference to each other, were sufficient toallege the public- road element to support the OVUII conviction); Walker, 126 
Hawaiʻi at 489, 273 P.3d at 1175 (applying Wheeler to an April 21, 2008 felony 
information and complaint and holding that the charging instruments could not
be reasonably construed to charge OVUII because the public- road element was 
not alleged); id. at 493, 273 P.3d at 1179 (Recktenwald, C.J., concurring) 
(agreeing with the majority that Wheeler’s public- road element applied to the 
April 21, 2008 charging instruments).

As it is clear that Wheeler did not overrule 
precedent, it did not announce a new rule. 
3.	 Wheeler Engaged in Statutory Interpretation to Effectuate a
Settled Constitutional Principle 
Wheeler is best understood as a case applying the 
settled constitutional requirement that “an ‘accusation must 
sufficiently allege all of the essential elements of the offense 
charged.’” Id. (quoting Merino, 81 Hawaiʻ i at 212, 915 P.2d at 
686). Specifically, Wheeler involved an inquiry into whether 
the OVUII charge at issue in that case was legally sufficient. 
Wheeler, 121 Hawaiʻ i at 391, 219 P.3d at 1178.  In conducting 
this inquiry, the Wheeler court utilized settled canons of 
statutory construction to identify the elements of OVUII that 
must be alleged in order to satisfy the dictates of due process. 
See id. at 391—93, 219 P.3d at 1178—80 (applying principles of statutory construction in interpreting the word “operating”). 
Using principles of statutory construction, we 
concluded in
 Wheeler  that “HRS § 291E–1 establishes an attendant 
circumstance of the offense of OVUII, i.e., that the defendant’s conduct occur ‘upon a public way, street, road, or highway.’” 
Id.
 at 392, 219 P.3d at 1179. Because an attendant circumstance 
is an element of an offense, we held that “the operation of a 
vehicle on a public way, street, road, or highway is an . . .

element of the offense” that must be alleged in an OVUII charge. 
Wheeler, 121 Hawaiʻ i at 393, 219 P.3d at 1180.   
Against this foregoing background, it cannot be said 
that Wheeler
 created a new rule. For one, Wheeler merely 
applied the constitutionally settled principle that all elements 
of an offense must be alleged in order for the charging 
instrument to be legally sufficient.32 See Yates v. Aiken, 484 
U.S.
 211, 216—17 (1988) (explaining that Francis v. Franklin , 
471 U.S. 307 (1985), merely applied the constitutional rule that 
32 The concurrence asserts that Wheeler created a new rule because 
“it imposed an obligation on the State that was not compelled by prior law.”
Concurrence at 19. 
However, the obligation we set forth in  Wheeler- -that the 
State must allege the statutory definition of “operating” when chargingOVUII--is merely a particularized application of the elementary precept that 
a charge must allege all elements of the offense. In short, what the Statewas obligated to do in Wheeler, and after Wheeler, was essentially the same 
as what the State was obligated to do before Wheeler: to charge a person with 
all of the elements of the offense of which he or she is accused. Thus,
prior law, which required all elements of an offense to be alleged, did impel
the result in 
Wheeler. 
It is equally inaccurate to say that “ Wheeler broke new ground by 
establishing  a constitutional rule.”  Concurrence at 2 1 (emphasis added).  
Wheeler merely applied a well- established constitutional principle to the 
context of OVUII charging. Even assuming such a rule were applicable, thereare no indicia that Wheeler  could have been decided to yield a “reasonable  
contrary conclusion[].” See  Butler v. McKellar, 494 U.S. 407, 415 (1990) 
(emphasis added) (noting a circuit split between the Fourth and SeventhCircuit Courts of Appeals as an indication that the result in Arizona v.
Roberson, 486 U.S. 675 (1988), “was susceptible to debate among reasonable 
minds”). The ICA unanimously decided the case in a two- page summary 
disposition order relying on settled law that the charge failed to allege an
attendant circumstance of the offense. 
State v. Wheeler, 
120 Hawai i 256, 203
P.3d 676 (App. 2009) (summary disposition order) (citing HRS § 702- 205 and 
Jendrusch  in concluding that the charge was insufficient). This court was 
similarly unanimous. See  Wheeler, 121 Hawai i at 385, 219 P.3d at 1172. It 
was not debatable whether the failure to allege the public- road element 
(i.e., the definition of “operating”) yields a sufficient charging
instrument, because this would have been in derogation of a settledconstitutional principle.  See  State v. Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 279, 281, 567 P.2d 
1242, 1244 (1977) (noting that a charge omitting an element of the offenseconstitutes a denial of due process).

510 (1979), “that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth 
Amendment prohibits the State from making use of jury 
instructions that have the effect of relieving the State of the 
burden of proof enunciated in 
Winship on the critical question 
of intent in a criminal prosecution” (quoting Francis, 471 U.S. at 326—327)). Further, this court’s elucidation in Wheeler on 
the meaning of “operating” in the OVUII statute, which was based on our application of canons of statutory construction, see 
Wheeler, 121 Hawaiʻ i at 390—93, 219 P.3d at 1177—80, similarly 
did not create a new rule. When this court announces a legal 
principle grounded in its understanding of a particular statute, it merely expresses in definitive terms what that statute has 
always meant, both before and after that decision is handed 
down. See Rivers, 511 U.S. at 312—13 n.12 (“[I]t is not 
accurate to say that the Court’s decision in Patterson ‘changed’ the law that previously prevailed . . . when this case was 
filed. Rather, . . . the  opinion finally decided what

Wheeler is similar to Tauiliili inasmuch as it interpreted HRS §

The concurrence contends that Wheeler created a new 
rule “because it held that the State’s routine charging practice 
was unconstitutional despite this court’s contrary directives in 
Ruggiero and Kekuewa.”34 Concurrence at 20. Because this court 
remanded Ruggiero and Kekuewa for entry of judgment and resentencing, and because this court in those cases did not 
opine as to the meaning of “operating” and the public-road 
element of OVUII, the concurrence posits that “this court had provided a degree of judicial approval over the practice of 
charging OVUII in the language of the statute.” 
Concurrence at 
20.35 That is, the concurrence suggests that this court endorsed 
34 To the extent the concurrence’s conclusion that there are “four 
categories of cases that delineate when a new rule is established” could be 
read as enumerating an  exhaustive  list of categories, concurrence at 8 , it is 
overly restrictive. The inquiry into whether a rule is new or preexisting is
not accurately conducted by classifying a wide variety of cases in which this
issue may arise under inflexibly delineated categories; oftentimes, a rule
promulgated by a case is best characterized as existing on a spectrum, one
end of which constitutes rules that are clearly preexisting and the other end
composed of clearly new rules. See  Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 301 (1989) 
(“It is admittedly often difficult to determine when a case announces a new
rule, and we do not attempt to define the spectrum of what may or may not
constitute a new rule for retroactivity purposes.”). Hence, the
concurrence’s sweeping list of four categories of cases that “delineate[s]
when a new rule is established” is not helpful. 
35 For this proposition, the concurrence relies upon Johnson,  457 
U.S.
 537, where the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that as far as federal
retroactivity jurisprudence is concerned, a new principle of law is announced 
when a case “disapproves a practice [that it] arguably has sanctioned in
prior cases.” Id. at 551. However, this class of cases disavowed previous
decisions that expressly sanctioned the practices involved. See Gosa v. 
Mayden,
 413 U.S. 665, 673 (1973) (holding that “[t]he Court long and 
consistently had recognized that military status in itself was sufficient for
the exercise of court- martial jurisdiction,” a view that was later disavowed 
by the Court);  Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 731 (1966) (recognizing
that the Court’s previous cases approved of in- custody interrogation even 
though there was a “failure to warn accused persons of their rights[] or the
failure to grant them access to outside assistance,” cases that Miranda  later

sub silentio in Ruggiero and Kekuewa the then-prevailing 
practice by the State of charging OVUII without the public-road 
element. 
It bears repeating that this Court clarified in 
Wheeler that “Ruggiero and  focused on whether a charge 
that failed to adequately allege that the defendant had a prior OVUII conviction within the past five years was nevertheless 
sufficient to charge a first-offense OVUII.” Wheeler, 121 
Hawaiʻi at 399, 219 P.3d at 1186.  As mentioned, “the issue of 
whether the proscribed conduct must take place ‘upon a public 
way, street, road, or highway’ and, if so, whether it had been 
adequately alleged in the charge” was never raised, and “[a]s a result, this court did not address that issue in Ruggiero or 
Kekuewa
.” Id. Hence, this court concluded in  Wheeler
 that 
Ruggiero  and Kekuewa were dispositive only of the distinct 
issues presented in those cases. Id. 
The dissent’s suggestion--that this court’s silence 
in Ruggiero and Kekuewa on the issue directly presented for the 
(. . . continued) 
rendered nonbinding). 
In stark contrast,  Ruggiero  and Kekuewa were merely 
silent and in no way sanctioned the State’s practice of charging OVUII
without the public- road element derived from the statutory definition of 
“operating.” 
Further, if Wheeler  were indeed a case that disapproved of a 
previously sanctioned practice, then the concurrence, consistent with what
Johnson  directs, should find that Wheeler  is fully nonretroactive, see  id.  at 
549—51, a conclusion that the concurrence does not reach, concurrence at 28 .

first time in Wheeler was an implicit endorsement of the 
validity of the practice of not charging the public-road 
element--artificially extracts a holding from what was 
unaddressed. 
This practice was soundly rejected in Wheeler, see 
id. (rejecting the State’s contention that this Court had already decided in Ruggiero and Kekuewa that a charge omitting 
the public-road element is legally sufficient), and is of 
insignificant analytical value, see Texas v. Cobb, 532 U.S. 162, 169 (2001) (“Constitutional rights are not defined by inferences 
from opinions which did not address the question at issue.”); In 
re Stegall, 865 F.2d 140, 142 (7th Cir. 1989) (“A point of law 
merely assumed in an opinion, not discussed, is not 
authoritative.”).
36 
Just because this Court has not explicitly and 
affirmatively rejected a legal proposition in no way means that 
it has effectively approved of it, especially given the fact 
that prudential rules limit this Court to consideration of issues presented by the peculiarities of a particular case and 
the issues raised by a party. See Kapuwai v. City & Cnty. of 
Honolulu, Dep’t of Parks & Recreation, 121 Hawaiʻ i 
 33, 40, 211 
36 The concurrence’s assertion is analogous to the argument that the
denial by the U.S. Supreme Court of certiorari is an implicit endorsement of
the holding and reasoning of the case for which certiorari review was sought.
But it has long been settled that “denial of a writ of certiorari imports noexpression of opinion upon the merits of the case.” United States v. Carver,  
260 U.S. 482, 490 (1923) (Holmes, J.); accord  Hughes Tool Co. v. Trans World 
Airlines, Inc., 409 U.S. 363, 366, n.1 (1973).

P.3d 750, 757 (2009) (“[W]hile the courts of the State of Hawaiʻ i 
are not bound by a ‘case or controversy’ requirement, we 
nonetheless recognize that the ‘prudential rules’ of judicial self-governance ‘founded in concern about the proper—and 
properly limited—role of courts in a democratic society’ are 
always of relevant concern.’ For ‘even in the absence of 
constitutional restrictions, courts must still carefully weigh 
the wisdom, efficacy, and timeliness of an exercise of their 
power

(quoting Life of the Land v. Land Use Commission, 63 Haw. 166, 172, 623 P.2d 431, 438 (1981)) (internal quotation marks

Additionally, the concurrence’s analogy of  Wheeler to 
Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573 (1980) is incongruous. In United States v. Johnson, 457 U.S. 537 (1982), the Supreme Court 
concluded that Payton “did not simply apply settled precedent to 
a new set of facts” and that the presumption of retroactivity 
was thus inapplicable. Johnson, 457 U.S. at 551. The 
concurrence’s reliance on 
Johnson
 is flawed for two reasons: 
first, as fully explained supra, Wheeler did apply settled 
precedent to a new set of facts and did not break new ground; 
and second, the Johnson Court did not find that Payton 
established a new rule.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Contrary to the concurrence’s assertion that Johnson 
found a new rule in the primary holding of Payton, a closer 
reading of
 Johnson reveals that this is not accurate. The 
question of retroactivity in Johnson was not predicated on whether the Payton rule was new. What the U.S. Supreme Court 
did was to identify three classes of cases in which the question 
of retroactivity had been conclusively decided by Supreme Court 
precedents. Johnson, 457 U.S. at 549—51. One of those classes 
is where a case “announce[s] an entirely new and unanticipated 
principle of law”; in those cases, the Supreme Court “almost 
invariably has gone on to find such a newly minted principle 
nonretroactive.” Id. at 549. 
The Court expressly found that 
Payton did not fall under this class of cases. Id. at 551. 
Similarly, the Court determined that Payton did not fit the 
other two classes of cases where retroactivity is presumed.37 As 
a result, the Court then analyzed Payton under a retroactivity test patterned after that advocated for by Justice Harlan.
38 
37 These two classes are as follows: (1) “when a decision of this
Court merely has applied settled precedents to new and different factual
situations,” it applies retrospectively; and (2) “full retroactivity [i]s a
necessary adjunct to a ruling that a trial court lacked authority to convict
or punish a criminal defendant in the first place.” Johnson, 457 U.S. at 
549
—51. 
38 The concurrence argues that “the Supreme Court had to have found
that Payton was a new rule because it applied Justice Harlan’s test.”  
Concurrence at 7 n.2. 
It is true that Justice Harlan’s test focuses on 
“newly-declared constitutional rule[s],” Johnson, 457 U.S. at 546 (emphasis 
added), and that in Johnson, the Court stated, “We now agree with Justice 
Harlan that ‘[r]etroactivity must be rethought,’” id. at 548 (quoting Desist 
v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 258 (1969) (dissenting opinion)) (internal

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The concurrence’s reasoning behind its assertion that 
Payton announced a new rule appears to be based on the Supreme 
Court’s finding that Payton “did not simply apply settled 
precedent” and, therefore, was not a preexisting rule. Johnson, 
457 U.S. at 551. However, the fact that Payton was not a preexisting rule did not establish the converse: that Payton 
must be a new rule. Instead, unacknowledged by the concurrence 
is that the Supreme Court in fact found that Payton was not a new rule. Id. (“Payton also did not announce an entirely new 
and unanticipated principle of law.”).
39 Hence, to the extent 
(. . . continued) 
quotation marks omitted). 
The test that the Court adopted in Johnson, 
however, varies from that advocated by Justice Harlan. The test announced by
Johnson  is twofold: “We . . . examine the circumstances of this case to 
determine whether it presents a retroactivity question clearly controlled by
past precedents, and if not
,” id., whether a limited retroactive application 
of Payton  “would satisfy each of the three concerns stated in Justice 
Harlan’s opinions in Desist  and Mackey,” id.  at 554. 
Thus, compared to Justice Harlan’s test
--“that all ‘new’ rules of 
constitutional law must, at a minimum, be applied to all those cases whichare still subject to direct review by this Court at the time the ‘new’
decision is handed down,” 
Desist
, 394 U.S. at 258--the Johnson  test was not 
founded upon whether the rule is new or not new. 
This approach partially
differs from the approach that we employ. See  Ikezawa,  75 Haw. at 221— 22, 
857 P.2d at 598— 99 (analyzing whether a legal principle is new before 
proceeding to a balancing test to answer the retroactivity question). 
39 The concurrence agrees that Payton did not announce an entirely
new and unanticipated principle of law, but it asserts that the rule in
Payton was new  because it fits “a second separate category of cases”:  those 
that break new ground. Concurrence at 5, 7 n.2. However, Johnson  was clear 
that Payton did not break new ground. See  Johnson, 457 U.S. at 551— 52 
(describing cases that broke new ground and concluding that Payton is not one 
of them). Further, cases that break new ground are merely a subset of casesthat announce an entirely new and unanticipated principle of law, Johnson, 
457 U.S. at 551— 54, such that the concurrence’s attempt at disassociating one 
from the other--characterizing each as a discrete group--is inaccurate.

 Taylor v. Louisiana,

that the concurrence concludes that Wheeler announced a new rule 
because it is similar to Payton, it is mistaken. 
The concurrence additionally concludes that Wheeler 
should not be applied to cases that have become final before 
Wheeler was announced. Concurrence at 28. This conclusion is 
grounded in a predicate finding that mischaracterizes Wheeler as 
a case that announced a “new constitutional rule[] of criminal 
procedure,” concurrence at 27 (quoting Teague
, 489 U.S. at 310). 
As already explained, Wheeler merely applied an established 
constitutional principle. Hence, the rule from Teague 
(acknowledged by this court in State v. Gomes, 107 Hawai i 308, 
113 P.3d 184 (2005)) is inapposite and has no application to 
Wheeler.40 
Finally, the concurrence maintains that our decision 
on the issue of whether Wheeler applies retrospectively is 
dictum because “it has no impact on [our] ultimate conclusion 
that Schwartz waived her constitutional challenges by pleading 
retrospectivity to the constitutional requirement that jurors must be drawn guilty.” Dissent at 22. As this court has explained, 
an obiter dictum is a remark made or opinion expressed by a 
judge, in his decision upon a cause, by the way— that is, 
incidentally or collaterally  and not directly  upon the

from a fair cross section of the community, a requirement that was not in
existence prior to the Supreme Court’s decision i
n  419 
U.S. 522 (1975). In contrast, Wheeler  involved the long- settled 
constitutional requirement that a charge must set forth all elements of theoffense.

Dictionary 1177 (9th ed. 2009)) (internal quotation marks

retroactivity bears directly upon the question of whether 
Schwartz has any legal basis upon which she could predicate a 
challenge to the sufficiency of the charge against her, as a 
determination of a new rule could foreclose a challenge to the charge; hence, deciding the issue of retroactivity is a 
necessary component of the resolution of this case and not 
dictum.
41  
41 The concurrence’s proposition is equivalent to an argument that
this court’s determination of whether a lower court erred is dictum when it 
is ultimately determined that any error is harmless. See Michael C. Dorf, 
Dicta and Article III, 1
42 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1997, 2046 (1994). However, as
explained by Professor Dorf, deciding first whether the lower court erred“simply makes more sense . . . before deciding whether a putative error was
harmless.” Id.  Analytically speaking, “until the court passes on the
substantive question, it will not know exactly what the error is that it must test for harmlessness.” Id.   Because the determination of whether the lower 
court erred is meant to further “the purpose of resolving the case,” it is
not dictum. Id. 
The same is true in this case. The retrospective application of
Wheeler  forms an essential part of the analysis for why we conclude that 
Schwartz is precluded from challenging the legal sufficiency of the charge.In fact, the effect of Schwartz’ guilty plea upon her ability to challengethe charge becomes significant only after it is determined that
 Wheeler  did 
not announce a new rule and was, therefore, applicable retrospectively.Because our conclusion on retrospectivity is an integral part of our
reasoning, it may not be seriously labeled as dictum. 
Hawaiʻi at 513— 14, 229 P.3d at 331— 32 (defining obiter dictum as a court’s

Based on the foregoing, the ICA’s holding in Christian 
that Wheeler announced a new rule is incorrect, and Wheeler 
applies retroactively. Because we hold that the failure to 
charge the public-road element of OVUII does not deprive the 
district court of criminal jurisdiction--that is, such a failure 
is a nonjurisdictional defect42--the retroactive effect of 
Wheeler does not provide a basis for post-conviction relief to Schwartz, who pleaded guilty to OVUII. See Morin, 
 71 Haw. at 
162, 785 P.2d at 1318 (stating that a guilty or a nolo 
contendere plea “made voluntarily and intelligently precludes a 
defendant from later asserting any nonjurisdictional claims, 
including constitutional challenges to the pretrial 
proceedings”). Schwartz’s guilty plea therefore precludes her 
from challenging the charge as being insufficient for failing to 
allege the public-road element of OVUII. 
4. Adoption of an “exceptional circumstances” test for
collateral review was unwarranted 
The ICA in Christian alternatively concluded that 
“[e]ven if the asserted deficiency in [the] charge is properly 
42 Where the defect in the charging instrument is one that precludes
the district court from exercising criminal jurisdiction--e.g., charging an 
offense that is not “cognizable” under state law or an offense that was
committed outside the district court’s circuit, see  HRS §§ 603- 21.5; 604­
11.5; or if the offense charged is not “punishable by fine, or byimprisonment not exceeding one year whether with or without fine,” HRS § 604­
8; or if the charging instrument was never filed, see  supra  note 25, then the 
rule from Morin would not apply and a defendant may challenge such 
jurisdictional defects even after entry of a guilty or nolo contendere plea.

characterized as a jurisdictional defect, [it] would not require 
applying the Wheeler rule retroactively to [the defendant’s] 
collateral attack of his conviction” because of an “overriding interest in finality” that distinguishes collateral review from 
direct review. 
Christian,
 131 Hawaiʻ i at 161, 315 P.3d at 787 
(quoting United States v. Cuch , 79 F.3d 987, 991 n. 8 (1996)). 
Based on its determination that Wheeler should not be applied 
retroactively to the defendant’s charge in the underlying 
conviction, the ICA concluded that Ruggiero and Kekuewa provided 
persuasive authority that the OVUII charge was sufficient and 
that under the Motta/Wells standard the defendant could not 
demonstrate either prejudice or that the charge could not be construed to charge a crime. Id. at 162, 315 P.3d at 788. 
Therefore, the ICA held that the defendant in 
Christian
 was not 
entitled to the relief sought in the HRPP Rule 40 petition. Id.  
Although determining that the “new rule” had limited 
retroactive effect and that the defendant’s HRPP Rule 40 
petition was properly denied, the ICA observed that “[t]he 
Hawaiʻi Supreme Court . . . has not specifically addressed how a 
challenge to the sufficiency of a charge raised for the first 
time on collateral review should be evaluated.” Id.
 at 163, 315 
P.3d at 789. Based on the perceived lack of an evaluative standard,
 Christian  adopted a test from the federal circuits 
that a defendant challenging the sufficiency of a charge for the

first time on collateral review must show “exceptional 
circumstances” to reflect “the heightened interest in the 
finality of judgments.” Id. at 163-64, 315 P.3d at 789-80. 
However, 
Wheeler did not establish a new rule, and the 
trial court in this case did not lack jurisdiction because of 
the omission of the public-road element from the OVUII charge 
brought against Schwartz. Additionally, the adoption of an 
“exceptional circumstances” test that must be satisfied by defendants seeking to challenge the sufficiency of charging 
instruments on collateral review was unwarranted in light of the 
various alternative bases advanced by the ICA to support its 
ruling, and further, the test is not in accordance with our 
law.
43 Accordingly, the decision in Christian  is overruled.44   
43 The exceptional circumstance test, as adopted by the ICA, applies 
to defendants challenging the sufficiency of a charge for the first time on
collateral review. However, HRPP Rule 40 does not assign any special
standard for challenging a conviction based on the grounds asserted in the 
petition. See  HRPP Rule 40. 
Although an HRPP Rule 40 challenge to a
conviction on the grounds that the charge omitted an element has not been
reviewed by this court, an HRPP Rule 40 challenge based upon a charge that
reflected the alleged misconduct outside the statute of limitations has been 
considered, without reviewing the petition under any specialized standard.
See  Adams  103 Hawaiʻ i at 224, 81 P.3d at 404 (reviewing de novo the denial of
an HRPP Rule 40 challenge of a conviction on the grounds, inter alia, that
the charge was defective). 
Adopting varying standards of review to evaluate an HRPP Rule 40
petition that would depend on the grounds alleged is an approach that thiscourt has not previously applied and would unnecessarily complicate our law
regarding post
-conviction relief.  Our review in this case did not employ a
specialized standard. In light of our jurisprudence with regard to Rule 40petitions, the “exceptional circumstances” standard is rejected.

E. Resolution of the Application 
We resolve as follows the threshold question presented 
in Schwartz’s Application: the failure of a charging instrument 
to allege an element of an offense does not constitute a 
jurisdictional defect that fails to confer subject-matter jurisdiction to the district court. Secondly, we conclude that 
Wheeler did not establish a new rule; thus, Schwartz’s 
contention pertaining to the retroactive applicability of the 
new rule to cases on collateral review is inapposite. 
Schwartz’s third question, whether “a defective charge under 
Wheeler, even if properly characterized as a jurisdictional 
defect cannot be retroactively applied on collateral review,” is 
rendered moot by our response to the threshold question. 
Accordingly, Schwartz’s Rule 40 petition was properly 
denied as the district court had jurisdiction to accept her plea to the OVUII charge and enter judgment.

nature” and concluded on that basis that the failure of an indictment to 
allege the requisite mens rea did not present a “jurisdictional impediment.”
134 Hawai‘ i at 285, 339 P.3d at 1086.  Kam did not cite Christian. 
The ICA opinion in Christian concludes that the defendant “failed 
to show that the offense charged was one of which the sentencing court
manifestly
 had no jurisdiction” and that “the charge was not so deficient 
that the trial court manifestly lacked jurisdiction.” Christian, 131 Hawaiʻ i 
at 164-65, 315 P.3d at 790- 91.  This conclusion appears to create a confusing
new standard for measuring a court’s lack of jurisdiction--“manifest lack of jurisdiction”--which we do not adopt.

V. CONCLUSION 
In accordance with the prior decisions of this court, 
the criminal jurisdiction of the district court is provided by 
HRS Chapter 604; here, the district court had jurisdiction over 
the OVUII charge alleged against Schwartz by satisfaction of the requirements set forth in that chapter. Subject-matter 
jurisdiction is not abrogated by a charging instrument that 
fails to allege a culpable state of mind or a statutory element 
defining the offense; thus, the fact that the OVUII charge 
failed to allege an element of the offense did not extinguish 
the criminal jurisdiction of the district court. 
Based on the foregoing, we overrule Cummings and 
Walker insofar as the holdings of those decisions indicate that 
a charge, information, or indictment that fails to allege either the requisite mental state or an element of the charged offense 
deprives a trial court of subject-matter jurisdiction. In 
addition, as explained, the decision in Christian is also 
overruled.
