WILLIAM A. DANIELS, JR., Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant.
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.;
with Acoba, J., concurring and dissenting)
 
Petitioner William A. Daniels, Jr. (“Daniels”) seeks
 
review of the Intermediate Court of Appeal’s November 10, 2011
 
Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its October 24, 2011
 Summary Disposition Order, which affirmed the District Court of
 the First Circuit’s December 8, 2010 Judgment and Notice. The
 District Court adjudged Daniels guilty of Operating a Vehicle
 
Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, in violation of Hawai' i  
 
    
    
    
   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Revised Statutes (“HRS”) §§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3)(2007).1 We
 
accepted Daniels’ application for writ of certiorari and now
 
affirm the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal.
 
On certiorari, Daniels contends that the ICA gravely
 
erred in holding that mens rea need not be alleged in either an
 
HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) or an HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) charge.2 In State
 
v. Nesmith, we recently held that (1) mens rea must be alleged in
 
an HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge in order to provide fair notice of
 the nature and cause of the accusation; and (2) mens rea need not
 be alleged (or proven) in an HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) charge, as the
 legislative intent to impose absolute liability for an HRS §
 291E-61(a)(3) offense plainly appears. State v. Nesmith, ____
 
Hawai'i ___, ___ P.3d ____ (2012). Accordingly, the ICA gravely 
erred in holding that mens rea need not be alleged in an HRS 
1
 HRS § 291E-61(a) provided, at the time of the alleged offense, the
following: 
A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under 
the
influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or assumes
actual physical control of a vehicle:
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to
 
impair the person’s normal mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty;
(2) While under the influence of any drug that impairs the person’s
ability to operate the vehicle in a careful and prudent manner;
(3)
 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of
breath; or
(4) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters or
cubic centimeters of blood.
 
2 The other questions presented in Daniels’ application are without
merit.

Timothy I. MacMaster 
for petitioner/
defendant-appellant ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI
'I AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
§ 291E-61(a)(1) charge. Therefore, Daniels’ HRS § 291E-61(a)(1)
 
charge was deficient for failing to allege mens rea.
 
However, the District Court adjudged Daniels guilty of 
violating both HRS §§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3). Subsections (a)(1) and (a)(3) can each serve as the basis for a conviction under HRS § 291E-61. See State v. Grindles, 70 Haw. 528, 530-31, 
777 P.2d 1187, 1189-90 (1989); State v. Caleb, 79 Hawai
'i 336, 
339, 902 P.2d 971, 974 (1995); State v. Mezurashi, 77 Hawai 'i 94, 
98, 881 P.2d 1240, 1244 (1994). Insofar as the HRS § 291E­61(a)(3) charge was sufficient, and insofar as Daniels does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence as to that basis, his conviction still stands. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal
 
is affirmed.
