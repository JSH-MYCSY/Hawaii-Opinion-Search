Flynn’s application for writ of certiorari and now affirm the
 
judgment of the ICA. 
Flynn’s questions presented summarily contend that the 
ICA erred in concluding that the State was not required to allege mens rea in his OVUII charge under both HRS §§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3). In State v. Nesmith, ___ Hawai' i ___, ___ P.3d ___ 
(2012), we held that an OVUII charge under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) must allege mens rea in order to fully define the offense in unmistakable terms readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding and to inform the accused of the nature and cause of the accusation. In Nesmith, the State’s failure to allege mens rea in the OVUII charge under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) rendered the charge fatally defective. However, because both subsections (a)(1) and (a)(3) may serve as the basis for a conviction under HRS § 291E-61 and the State adequately alleged the charge of 
2...continue 
(ii) Not less than forty-eight hours and not
more than five days of imprisonment; or 
(iii) A fine of not less than $150 but not more
than $1,000; 
(D) A surcharge of $25 to be deposited into theneurotrauma special fund; and 
(E) May be charged a surcharge of up to $25 to bedeposited into the trauma system special fund ifthe court so orders[.]
 
HRS §§ 291E-61(a)(1), (a)(3), and (b)(1) (Supp. 2009).

              *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
OVUII under the alternative subsection (a)(3), we affirmed
 
Nesmith’s conviction.
 
The same holds true in the instant case. Here,
 
following Nesmith, the ICA erred by concluding that mens rea need
 not be alleged in a HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge. Without such
 allegation, Flynn’s HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge fails to fully
 define the OVUII offense in unmistakable terms readily
 comprehensible to persons of common understanding and is,
 therefore, fatally deficient. Flynn’s OVUII conviction under the
 deficient (a)(1) charge cannot stand. However, insofar as
 Flynn’s conviction under the alternative charge based upon
 subsection HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) is sufficient, and insofar as
 Flynn does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence as to
 that basis, his OVUII conviction under subsection (a)(3) stands. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s judgment is
 
affirmed.
