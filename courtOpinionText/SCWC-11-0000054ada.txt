ORDER DISMISSING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
 
(By: Nakayama, Acting C.J., Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ. and
Circuit Judge Perkins, in place of Recktenwald, C.J., recused)
 
Petitioner/defendant-appellant Patsy Naomi Sakuma's
 
application for writ of certiorari, filed on November 4, 2011,
 
was filed more than ninety days after the filing of the ICA s
 August 3, 2011 dismissal order. 
The application is untimely. 
See HRS § 602-59(c) (Supp. 2010) ("An application for writ of
 
certiorari may be filed with the supreme court no later than
 ninety days after the filing of the judgment or dismissal order
 of the intermediate appellate court."). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for writ of
 
certiorari is dismissed.
