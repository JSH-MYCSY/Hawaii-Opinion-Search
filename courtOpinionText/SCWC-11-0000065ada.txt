RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, POLLACK, AND WILSON, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAYAMA, J.
 I. INTRODUCTION
 
At issue is whether the doctrine of sovereign immunity
 
protects the State from an arbitrator’s award of prejudgment
 
interest. We hold that, under the facts of this case, it does
 not. 
Because judicial review of an arbitration award is confined
           
       *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to the strictest possible limits, and because the arbitrator in
 
this case reasonably interpreted the arbitration agreement in
 fashioning the award, we hold that the arbitrator did not exceed
 his authority in awarding prejudgment interest against the State. 
We also hold that the award of attorneys’ fees and costs on
 appeal was proper. 
Thus, we affirm the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ 
(ICA) November 21, 2016 judgment on appeal, which 1) vacated in part the Circuit Court of the First Circuit’s (circuit court) February 24, 2011 final judgment, 2) reversed the circuit court’s January 4, 2011 orders, 3) affirmed the circuit court’s January 31, 2011 order, and 4) granted Hawai' i State Teachers 
Association’s (HSTA) request for fees and costs. 
II. BACKGROUND
 
A. Arbitration Proceedings
1
 
On July 18, 2008, Kathleen Morita (Morita or grievant), 
a public school teacher, was terminated from her job for allegedly smoking marijuana and possessing alcohol while in her classroom at Hau' ula Elementary School. HSTA filed a grievance 
on Morita’s behalf and an arbitration hearing was held pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement (the agreement) between HSTA and the Hawai' i State Department of Education (State or 
Walter H. Ikeda presided over the arbitration proceedings.

Employer). 
Article V of the agreement outlines the grievance
 
procedure, which provides that a grievant may request
 
arbitration. Article V.G.2.f provides the arbitrator with the
 authority to enter an award in favor of the grievant if the
 arbitrator finds that the Employer’s actions were improper:
 
When the arbitrator finds that any disciplinary action was
improper, the action may be set aside, reduced or otherwise
modified by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may award back
pay to compensate the teacher wholly or partially for any
salary lost. Such back pay award shall be offset by all
other compensation received by the grievant(s) including but
not limited to unemployment compensation or wages.
 
On May 7, 2010, the arbitrator issued a decision and 
award, which sustained the grievance because the State lacked 
just cause to terminate Morita. The arbitrator ordered that Morita be restored to her position at Hau' ula Elementary School 
and be given back wages “with interest at the rate of ten (10) percent per annum on any unpaid amounts that are due and owing.” The arbitrator also noted that he would “retain limited jurisdiction for a period not to exceed 6 months from the date of this award to assure compliance with the award.” 
On July 28, 2010, HSTA filed a motion for final
 
decision and award requiring the State to pay Morita $30,454.57
 in backpay, plus ten percent interest until the amount was fully
 paid. In its memorandum in support of the motion, HSTA explained
 that there “has been no compliance with the remedial terms of the

          *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
award . . . as to back pay by Employer” and requested that the
 
arbitrator enter a final decision in order to settle any
 remaining disputes over the calculation of the award between the
 parties. 
On September 27, 2010, the arbitrator entered a
 
compliance order. In it, the arbitrator noted that the State had
 filed a July 22, 2010 motion to strike or vacate the interest
 portion of the award with the circuit court and that this motion
 was still pending at the circuit court level.

As to the issues of backpay and interest (also labeled
 
throughout the proceedings as prejudgment or backpay interest),
 the arbitrator offered the following explanation:
 
While the Union has requested a final award and order
which fixes the amount of backpay and interest, the
Arbitrator has elected to treat it as a compliance matter
pursuant to his continuing jurisdiction because the May 7,
2010 decision and award was final except for what normally
would have been ministerial mathematical calculation. As a
 general proposition, Arbitrators are authorized to proceed
under the authority permitted by the collective bargaining
agreement and the Uniform Arbitration Act, HRS, Chapter
658A. As previously indicated in the order of June 16,
2010, the Arbitrator believes that he is acting in
conformity tithe [sic] Collective Bargaining Agreement and
the authority granted by HRS, Chapter 658A in the
determination that any backpay award includes interest at
the rate of 10 percent per annum. The purpose of an award
 of backpay including interest is to “make whole” financially
 the Grievant had she not been terminated. Elkouri &
 Elkouri, How Arbitration Works
, 6th  Ed.  2003,  p.  1224.
 
P
ayment to the Grievant of wrongfully withheld pay without
interest would not restore her whole as loss of use of funds
 for that period entailed either deprivation or additional
costs to the Grievant if she had to borrow funds to replace
lost wages while awaiting the results of her grievance. The
 
The State’s motion to strike is discussed in the following section.

     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
doctrine of interest assessed by an arbitrator as
compensation or penalty to prevent further damages is
demonstrated by Morris Knudsen Company vs. Makahuena
Corporation and Tea Pacific, Inc. , 66 Haw. 663 (1983) and
Sussell vs. Civil Service Commission of the City & County of
Honolulu , 74 H,[sic] 599 (1993).
 
As such, the arbitrator reaffirmed his May 7, 2010 determination
 
that Morita was entitled to interest on unpaid backpay, but left
 the calculation to the parties:
 
The Grievant is entitled to a reimbursement of backpay
of $25,169.05 excluding interest for the period from
August 1, 2008 to May 31, 2010. She is also entitled to
 interest on any unpaid backpay at the rate of 10 percent per
 annum. Since the Employer has indicated the possibility of
appealing at least the interest portion of the award, no
amount is set forth as to accrued interest. If the Employer
does not contest the principal amount of the backpay, it
should be paid forthwith as it may be the source of the
repayment by the Grievant of retirement benefits received
from the State of Hawaii Retirement System. The calculation
 of accrued interest is left to the parties using financial
management software. The calculation should assume the
 deficit in backpay accrued monthly from August 1, 2008 by
dividing the aggregate deficit in backpay for each year by
the number of months that the unpaid deficit remained unpaid
multiplied by the rate of 10 percent per annum until paid.
 
B. Circuit Court Proceedings3
 
On May 18, 2010, HSTA filed a motion to confirm the
 
arbitration award, entry of judgment and allowing costs and other
 
appropriate relief with the circuit court. The State filed a
 response, arguing that Morita was not entitled to the awarded
 interest and opposing HSTA’s request for attorneys’ fees and
 costs. 
Confusion appears to have arisen when the State filed

          *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
two separate motions, which sought the same relief from the
 
arbitrator’s award of interest, but relied on different statutory
 grounds. The first, filed on July 9, 2010,
4
 was the State’s
motion to modify or correct the arbitration award (motion to
 modify award), in which the State sought to modify the portion of
 the arbitrator’s decision that awarded prejudgment interest on
 the backpay. This motion was brought pursuant to Hawai' i Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 658A-24 (Supp. 2010).
5
   
HSTA’s motion to confirm and the State’s motion to
 
modify the award were heard on July 15, 2010. At the hearing,
 the State also made an oral request to file a motion to vacate
 
4 There is some discrepancy as to when this motion was filed. The motion
 
is dated July 8, 2010 but date stamped July 9, 2010.
 
5 HRS § 658A-24 (Supp. 2010), “Modification or correction of award,”
 
provides in full:
 
(a) Upon motion made within ninety days after the movant
receives notice of the award pursuant to section 658A-19 or
within ninety days after the movant receives notice of a
modified or corrected award pursuant to section 658A-20, the
court shall modify or correct the award if:
(1) There was an evident mathematical miscalculation
or an evident mistake in the description of a person,
thing, or property referred to in the award;
(2) The arbitrator has made an award on a claim not
submitted to the arbitrator and the award may be
corrected without affecting the merits of the decision
upon the claims submitted; or
(3) The award is imperfect in a matter of form not
affecting the merits of the decision on the claims
submitted.
 
(b) If a motion made under subsection (a) is granted, the
court shall modify or correct and confirm the award as
modified or corrected. Otherwise, unless a motion to vacate
is pending, the court shall confirm the award.
(c) A motion to modify or correct an award pursuant to this
section may be joined with a motion to vacate the award.

the award. 
The second of the State’s written motions, filed on
 
July 26, 2010,6
 was the State’s motion to vacate in part the
arbitration award (motion to vacate award), in which the State
 
sought to vacate the portion of the arbitrator’s decision that
 awarded prejudgment interest on the backpay. This motion was
 brought pursuant to HRS § 658A-23 (Supp. 2010).

September 13, 2010, a hearing was held on the State’s motion to
 
6 There is some discrepancy as to when this motion was filed. There are
 
two date stamps on the document, July 22, 2010 and July 26, 2010.
 
7 HRS § 658A-23 (Supp. 2010), “Vacating award,” provides in part:
 
(a) Upon motion to the court by a party to an arbitration
proceeding, the court shall vacate an award made in the
arbitration proceeding if:
(1) The award was procured by corruption, fraud, or
other undue means;
(2) There was:
(A) Evident partiality by an arbitrator
appointed as a neutral arbitrator;
(B) Corruption by an arbitrator; or
(C) Misconduct by an arbitrator prejudicing the
rights of a party to the arbitration proceeding;
(3) An arbitrator refused to postpone the hearing upon
showing of sufficient cause for postponement, refused
to consider evidence material to the controversy, or
otherwise conducted the hearing contrary to section
658A-15, so as to prejudice substantially the rights
of a party to the arbitration proceeding;
(4) An arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's powers;
(5) There was no agreement to arbitrate, unless the
person participated in the arbitration proceeding
without raising the objection under section 658A-15(c)
not later than the beginning of the arbitration
hearing; or
(6) The arbitration was conducted without proper
notice of the initiation of an arbitration as required
in section 658A-9 so as to prejudice substantially the
rights of a party to the arbitration proceeding.

               *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
vacate award. The circuit court orally granted the motion and
 
vacated the portion of the award that gave Morita prejudgment
 interest. Counsel for HSTA was not at the hearing. Both parties
 assert that there was a service error and that HSTA did not
 receive notice of the hearing date until after the hearing.
 
On October 7, 2010, HSTA filed a motion for
 
reconsideration of the State’s motion to vacate award, arguing
 that HSTA did not receive notice of the hearing on the State’s
 motion. A hearing on HSTA’s motion for reconsideration was held
 on November 22, 2010. Both parties appeared and argued as to
 whether the doctrine of sovereign immunity applied when awarding
 prejudgement interest. At the close of the hearing, the circuit
 court took the matter under advisement. The following day,
 November 23, 2010, the circuit court entered a minute order
 denying HSTA’s motion for reconsideration. 
Meanwhile, on October 1, 2010, the circuit court
 
entered three orders and one judgment: 1) Order Denying
 Employer’s Oral Motion For Leave to File Motion to Vacate Award
 Dated May 7, 2010, Filed Orally on July 15, 2010; 2) Order

The October judgment reads in its entirety as follows:
 
Pursuant  to  the  1)  order  granting  in  part  and  denying
in  part  motion  to  confirm  arbitration  award,  entry  of
judgment  and  allowing  costs  and  other  appropriate  relief
filed  on  May  18,  2010,  entered  on  OCT.- 1,  2010,  2)  order
denying  Employer’s  motion  to  modify  or  correct  award  dated
May  7,  2010,  filed  on  July  18,  2010,  entered  on  OCT.- 1,
2010,  and  3)  order  denying  Employer’s  motion  for  leave  to
file  motion  to  vacate  award  dated  May  7,  2010,  filed  orally
on  July  15,  2010,  entered  on  OCT.- 1,  2010,  Judgment  is
hereby  entered  in  conformity  with  the  arbitration  award
filed  on  May  18,  2010  in  accordance  with  Section  658A-25(a),
Hawaii  Revised  Statutes,   in  favor  of  the  Hawaii  State
Teachers  Association  and  against  Employer,  State  of  Hawaii,
Department  of  Education.
This  judgment  is  entered  as  to  all  claims  raised  by
the  parties,  and  it  resolves  all  claims  by  and  against  the
parties  in  the  above-entitled  case.   No  claims  or  parties
 
remain.   Any  and  all  remaining  claims,  if  any,  are  dismissed
with  prejudice.
 
(Formatting altered.)
 
On October 11, 2010, HSTA filed a motion to alter and
 
8(...continued)
t
ext of the order, also notes that the motion was filed on July 8, 2010, which
more accurately reflects the record. The circuit court offered the following
 
explanation for denying the motion:
 
The Employer relies on subsection 3 of Section 658A-24(a),
Hawaii Revised Statutes , (HRS), for its motion and the
Court finds no authority to modify or correct. The change
sought by the Employer goes to the subject matter of the
award. The question of the 10% interest as awarded by the
arbitrator is part of the merits of the award and to modify
or correct as sought by the Employer would alter the
substance of the award.

 9 The  order  granting  in  part  HSTA’s  motion  to  confirm  the  arbitration
 
award  confirmed  the  May  7,  2010  decision  and  award  of  the  arbitrator,  entered
judgment  in  accordance  with  the  arbitration  award,  and  denied  without
prejudice  HSTA’s  request  for  attorneys’  fees  and  costs.   With  note  to  the
 
denial  of  the  fees  and  costs,  the  circuit  court  explained  that  HSTA  did  not
request  a  specific  amount  of  fees  and  costs,  and  that  HSTA  could  file  another
motion  that  would  afford  the  State  the  opportunity  to  contest  the  amount.
             *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
amend the circuit court’s October judgment (motion to amend) so
 
that the judgment would either include the specific amount of
 backpay reflected in the arbitrator’s compliance order or to
 confirm the arbitrator’s compliance order. At the November 8,
 2010 hearing on HSTA’s motion to amend, the circuit court orally
 granted HSTA’s motion and ordered the State to pay Morita backpay
 in the amount of $25,169.05. The court noted that HSTA’s motion
 for reconsideration, which addressed the issue of the prejudgment
 interest, would be heard on November 22, 2010. 
On January 4, 2011, the circuit court entered two
 
written orders: 1) granting the State’s motion to vacate the
 award as to the prejudgment interest, and 2) denying HSTA’s
 motion for reconsideration. 
On January 31, 2011, the circuit court entered its
 
written order, entitled “Order Granting HSTA’s Motion to Alter
 and Amend Judgment Entered October 1, 2010 or in the Alternative
 to Confirm Supplemental Arbitration Award Clarifying Award of 
May 7, 2010, Filed October 11, 2010.” The order states:
 
It  is  hereby  ordered,  adjudged,  and  decreed  that  the
HSTA’s  motion  to  alter  and  amend  judgment  entered  October  1,
2010  or  in  the  alternative  to  confirm  supplemental
arbitration  award  clarifying  award  of  May  7,  2010,  is  hereby
granted.   The  judgment  will  be  amended  to  state  the  Employer
shall  pay  the  employee  $25,169.05.
    
(Formatting altered.) The order also addresses the issue of
 retirement benefits, and then concludes with a final paragraph
 
10
           
 On February 24, 2011, the circuit court entered a final 
judgment, which reads as follows:
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that an amended judgment would be filed at a later time. The
 
final paragraph, originally typed, states the following:
 
An  amended  judgment  consistent  with  this  order  will
not  b e  filed  until  the  Court  has  ruled  on  the  other  matters
 
pending  in  the  case,  i.e.,  the  HSTA’s  request  for  attorney
fees  and  costs  and  the  HSTA’s  Motion  for  Reconsideration  of
 
Employer’s  Motion  to  Vacate  in  Part  Award  Dated  May  7,  2010,
Filed  July  26,  2010  which  will  be  heard  on  November  22,

 crossed out and in its place is the following handwritten
 sentence: “An amended judgment consistent with this order shall
 be filed at an appropriate time.”

C. ICA Proceedings
 
On appeal, HSTA argued that the circuit court exceeded
 
its authority in vacating the interest portion of the arbitration
 
award because the doctrine of sovereign immunity was not
 implicated in this case.
10
 
1. The ICA’s 2013 Opinion
 
On November 26, 2013, the ICA issued a published 
opinion in which it: 1) vacated the circuit court’s February 24, 
2011 final judgment; 2) reversed the circuit court’s January 4, 2011 orders (order granting State’s motion to vacate award, and the order denying HSTA’s motion for reconsideration); and 3) dismissed HSTA’s appeal of the circuit court’s January 31, 2011 order granting HSTA’s motion to alter and to amend the October 1, 2010 judgment. Haw. State Teachers Ass’n v. State Dep’t of 
Educ., 131 Hawai' i 301, 312, 318 P.3d 591, 602 (App. 2013), 
vacated, CAAP-11-0000065, 2014 WL 4548491, at *1 (Haw. Ct. App. Sept. 15, 2014) (HSTA I). 
The ICA’s opinion held, inter alia, that the circuit
 
court erred when it vacated the portion of the arbitration award
 
On February 3, 2011, HSTA filed its first notice of appeal from the
 
circuit court’s January 4, 2011 orders, which was docketed as CAAP-11-0000065.
On March 9, 2011, HSTA filed a second notice of appeal from the circuit
court’s February 24, 2011 final judgment, which was docketed as CAAP-11­0000140. The ICA consolidated these appeals under CAAP-11-0000065.

pertaining to interest, concluding that “[n]either sovereign
 
immunity nor the statutory prohibition against the award of pre­judgment interest against the State are implicated here.” Id. at
 
302, 318 P.3d at 592. 
On September 15, 2014, the ICA entered an order 
vacating the opinion sua sponte, “[i]n light of the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court’s Opinion in Association of Condominium Homeowners of Tropics at Waikele v. Sakuma, 131 Hawai' i 254, 319 P.3d 94 
(December 17, 2013).” Haw. State Teachers Ass’n v. State Dep’t 
of Educ., CAAP-11-0000065, 2014 WL 4548491, at *1 (Haw. Ct. App. Sept. 15, 2014). The order further stated that a “new opinion shall be filed.” Id. 
2. The ICA’s 2016 Opinion
 
On September 30, 2016, the ICA issued an unpublished
 
memorandum opinion. Haw. State Teachers Ass’n v. State Dep’t of
 
Educ., CAAP-11-0000065, 2016 WL 5719745, at *1 (Haw. Ct. App.
 
Sept. 30, 2016) (HSTA II). This opinion, other than resolving
 the procedural issues raised by Sakuma, was substantially similar
 to its 2013 opinion in its analysis and disposition of the
 issues.
 
Before reaching HSTA’s points on appeal, the ICA first
 
addressed two preliminary questions: 1) whether the ICA had
 appellate jurisdiction to review all of the issues on appeal, and
 
13
           
         
      
         
           
           
         
          
        
       
        *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
2) whether the circuit court had the authority to proceed to
 
enter orders and a second judgment after it entered the 
October 1, 2010 judgment. Id. at *6.
 
In addressing the first question, the ICA first 
concluded that the October judgment was “a final and appealable judgment” pursuant to HRS §§ 658A-25 and 658A-28. Id. Next, the 
ICA examined whether there was a timely appeal from the October judgment. Id. The ICA noted that neither party timely appealed 
the judgment, but that HSTA timely filed a post-judgment motion-­its motion to amend the October judgment. Id. The ICA further 
explained that, under Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 4(a)(3), the circuit court failed to enter an order within ninety days after the date that HSTA’s motion to amend was filed. Id. at *6-7. In HSTA I, the ICA concluded that under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), HSTA’s motion to amend was deemed denied on January 10, 2011 and that the parties would have had thirty days from that date to timely file an appeal from the October judgment. Id. at 
*7. The following excerpt from HSTA II explains why this conclusion was incorrect: 
However, in Sakuma, the majority opinion held that when a
timely post-judgment motion for reconsideration is deemed
denied, it does not trigger a thirty-day deadline for filing
a notice of appeal until thirty days after the entry of an
order disposing of the motion. . . . Thus, the HSTA’s Motion
to Amend 10/1/10 Judgment was not “deemed denied” on January
10, 2011 (as we previously had held), and the January 31,
2011 Order Granting HSTA’s Motion to Amend 10/1/10 Judgment
constitutes the effective disposition on this motion.
Finally, the January 31, 2011 Order Granting HSTA’s Motion
 
14
           
        
        
          
       
            
   
          
         
        
         
        
      
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to Amend 10/1/10 Judgment specifically states that: “An
 
amended judgment consistent with this order shall be filed
at an appropriate time.” This judgment appears to be the
2/24/11 Judgment, which expressly enters judgment on six
orders . . . [and] the HSTA timely filed a Notice of Appeal
from the 2/24/11 Judgment.
 
Id. Thus, the ICA concluded that it had appellate jurisdiction
 
over all of the issues raised in HSTA’s appeal. Id.
 
In addressing the second question, the ICA examined HRS
 
Chapter 658A, which sets out the framework for judicial action of
 
arbitration proceedings, and explained that the framework does
 not contemplate the convoluted procedural posture of this case: 
HRS Chapter 658A does not contemplate a case like this one,
where one party secures an order confirming an award, and
the court enters final judgment on the confirmation order,
while the other party later secures an order vacating in
part the same award, without challenging the court’s entry
of final judgment on the confirmation award.
We  cannot  speculate  as  to  why  the  Circuit  Court
entered  the  10/1/10  Judgment  notwithstanding  the  parallel
requests  for  relief.   We  also  cannot  speculate  as  to  why  the
State  failed  to  seek  relief  from  the  10/1/10  Judgment.
 
. . . .
 
HRS  §  658A-23  provides  statutory  authority  for  relief
from  an  arbitration  award,  but  not  from  a  final  judgment  on
an  order  confirming  an  arbitration  award.   In  order  to  seek
 
relief  in  the  Circuit  Court  from  a  final  judgment  entered
pursuant  to  HRS  §  658A-25(a),  such  as  the  10/1/10  Judgment,
the  State  had  to  file  a  timely  motion  to  alter  or  amend  the
judgment.   It  did  not.   Under  these  circumstances,  we  must
conclude  that  the  Circuit  Court  was  no  longer  authorized  to
enter  an  irreconcilably  inconsistent  order  based  on  the
State’s  Motion  to  Vacate  Award.   See  Wong,  79  Hawai'i  at  29­
30,  897  P.2d  at  956-57.   On  this  basis  alone,  we  conclude
that  the  Circuit  Court  erred  when  it  entered  the  Order
 
Partially  Vacating  Award  and  the  Order  Denying  HSTA’s  Motion
for  Rehearing.
 
Id. at *8-9. As such, the ICA concluded that the circuit court
 
did not have authority to enter subsequent orders or another
 
15
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
judgment after the October judgment. Id. at *9.
 
Despite arriving at this conclusion, the ICA went on to
 
analyze the substantive claims raised on appeal. The ICA
 
determined that, even if the circuit court could have vacated in
 part the award, the circuit court erred in doing so in this case
 because the State expressly waived sovereign immunity with
 respect to Morita’s grievance. Id. The ICA explained that
 
Morita’s grievance was a contract claim pursuant to the
 collective bargaining agreement and that, as such, the State
 “waived its immunity with respect to the submission of the claim
 to binding arbitration.” Id. 
The ICA examined the collective bargaining agreement,
 
which provided that the “arbitrator may award back pay to
 compensate the teacher wholly or partially for any salary lost,”
 and determined that it was “clear from the record of the
 arbitration proceedings that the Arbitrator interpreted this
 contract provision to allow an award to include interest on back
 pay in order to ‘wholly’ compensate a teacher for lost salary.” 
Id. The ICA concluded that the arbitrator did not exceed his
 
powers in this regard and that “[e]ven if he incorrectly
 construed the agreement or misinterpreted applicable law, he
 acted within his power to interpret the agreement and fashion a
 remedy in accordance with his interpretation.” Id. at *10

Citing Kenneth H. Hughes, Inc. v. Aloha Tower
 
Development, Corp., 654 F. Supp. 2d 1142, 1149 (D. Haw. 2009),
 
the ICA further concluded that neither the doctrine of sovereign
 immunity nor the statutory prohibition against awards of
 prejudgment interest against the State prevented the arbitrator
 from awarding interest against the State. Id. Therefore, the
 
ICA held that the circuit court erred in vacating that part of
 the arbitrator’s award. Id. 
As such, the ICA entered the following order:
 
For the foregoing reasons, we: (1) vacate in part the
Circuit Court’s February 24, 2011 Final Judgment; (2)
reverse the Circuit Court’s January 4, 2011 orders, the
Order Granting Employer’s Motion to Vacate in Part Award
Dated May 7, 2010, and the Order Denying HSTA’s Motion for
Reconsideration of Employer’s Motion to Vacate in Part Award
Dated May 7, 2010; and (3) affirm the Circuit Court’s
January 31, 2011 Order Granting HSTA’s Motion to Alter and
to Amend Judgment Entered October 1, 2010 or in the
Alternative to Confirm Supplemental Arbitration Award

This case is remanded to the Circuit Court for further
 proceedings consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.
 
Id. at *11.
 
On October 12, 2016, the ICA entered an order granting
 
in part and denying in part HSTA’s request for attorneys’ fees
 
and costs filed on December 20, 2013. The ICA awarded HSTA fees
 in the amount of $13,696.33 pursuant to HRS § 658A-25(c) and
 
17
           
          
   
       
       
        
         
     
          
  
         
      
        
       
         
     
    11 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
costs in the amount of $371.30 pursuant to HRS § 685A-25(b).11
  
The ICA noted that HSTA “may submit a supplemental motion for
 
costs within (5) days from the date of this order.”
 
On October 17, 2016, HSTA filed a supplemental motion
 
for expenses, requesting an additional $24.08 for the costs of
 ordering a transcript of the November 8, 2010 proceeding. On
 November 9, 2016, the ICA granted HSTA’s October 17, 2016
 supplemental motion for expenses, awarding HSTA an additional
 $24.08 in costs.
 
On November 21, 2016, the ICA entered its judgment on
 
appeal pursuant to its September 30, 2016 memorandum opinion,
 October 12, 2016 order granting in part and denying in part
 HSTA’s request for attorneys’ fees and costs, and November 9,
 2016 order granting HSTA’s supplemental motion for expenses.
 
HRS § 658A-25 (2016), “Judgment on award; attorney’s fees and litigation
 
expenses,” provides in full:
 
(a) Upon granting an order confirming, vacating without
directing a rehearing, modifying, or correcting an award,
the court shall enter a judgment in conformity therewith.
The judgment may be recorded, docketed, and enforced as any
other judgment in a civil action.
(b) A court may allow reasonable costs of the motion and
subsequent judicial proceedings.
(c) On application of a prevailing party to a contested
judicial proceeding under section 658A-22, 658A-23, or
658A-24, the court may add reasonable attorney’s fees and
other reasonable expenses of litigation incurred in a
judicial proceeding after the award is made to a judgment
confirming, vacating without directing a rehearing,
modifying, or correcting an award.

III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Judicial Review of Arbitration Awards
 
“[J]udicial review of an arbitration award is confined
 
to ‘the strictest possible limits,’ and a court may only vacate
 
an award on the grounds specified in HRS § 658A-23 and modify or
 correct on the grounds specified in HRS § 658A-24.” 
State of
 
Haw. Org. of Police Officers (SHOPO) v. County of Kaua' i, 135 
Hawai'i 456, 461, 353 P.3d 998, 1003 (2015) (alteration in 
original) (quoting Daiichi, 103 Hawai' i at 336, 82 P.3d at 422). 
“This standard applies to both the circuit court and the
 appellate courts.” Id.
 
Judicial review of an arbitration award is limited by
the following precepts:
 
First,  because  of  the  legislative  policy  to  encourage
arbitration  and  thereby  discourage  litigation,  arbitrators
have  broad  discretion  in  resolving  the  dispute.   Upon
submission  of  an  issue,  the  arbitrator  has  authority  to
determine  the  entire  question,  including  the  legal
construction  of  terms  of  a  contract  or  lease,  as  well  as  the
disputed  facts.   In  fact,  where  the  parties  agree  to
arbitrate,  they  thereby  assume  all  the  hazards  of  the
arbitration  process,  including  the  risk  that  the  arbitrators
may  make  mistakes  in  the  application  of  law  and  in  their
findings  of  fact.
  
Second,  correlatively,  judicial  review  of  an
arbitration  award  is  confined  to  the  strictest  possible
limits.   An  arbitration  award  may  be  vacated  only  on  the
four  grounds  specified  in  HRS  §  658-9  and  modified  and
corrected  only  on  the  three  grounds  specified  in  HRS  §  658­
10.   Moreover,  the  courts  have  no  business  weighing  the
merits  of  the  award.
  
Third,  HRS  §§  658-9  and  -10  also  restrict  the
 
authority  of  appellate  courts  to  review  judgments  entered  by
circuit  courts  confirming  or  vacating  the  arbitration
awards.

82 P.3d at 422). 
IV. DISCUSSION
 
The State presents both procedural and substantive
 
arguments in support of its position that the ICA erred in
 
vacating the circuit court’s judgment and upholding the
 arbitrator’s award of interest against the State. Additionally,
 the State takes issue with the ICA’s award of appellate fees and
 costs to HSTA.
 
A.	 Procedural Issues
 
The State argues that the ICA erred in concluding that
 
the circuit court was not authorized to enter orders and
 
judgments that were irreconcilable with its October judgment. 
The State provides four grounds for this argument: 1) this issue
 was not raised before the ICA by either party; 2) the October
 judgment was not final; 3) subsequent outstanding issues rendered
 the October judgment non-final; and 4) HSTA’s motion to alter or
 amend the October judgment rendered the October judgment non-
final. 
1.	 The ICA did not err in considering an issue not raised
by the parties on appeal.
 
The State first argues that the ICA improperly reached
 
20
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
an issue that was not raised by the parties during the circuit
 
court or appellate proceedings. Specifically, the State contends
 that the “ICA decided this case primarily on the procedural issue
 of whether the 10/1/10 Judgment had binding effect on and
 superseded the subsequent orders in the case,” but that neither
 of the parties raised this as an issue in their briefings before
 the ICA.
 
HRS § 641-2(b) (2016) provides: 
The  appellate  court  may  correct  any  error  appearing  on  the
record,  but  need  not  consider  a  point  that  was  not  presented
in  the  trial  court  in  an  appropriate  manner.   No  judgment,
order,  or  decree  shall  be  reversed,  amended,  or  modified  for
any  error  or  defect,  unless  the  court  is  of  the  opinion  that
it  has  injuriously  affected  the  substantial  rights  of  the
appellant.
  
(Emphasis added.) See also HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(D) (2016) (“Points
 
not presented in accordance with this section will be
 disregarded, except that the appellate court, at its option, may
 notice a plain error not presented.” (emphasis added)). 
Thus, while an appellate court need not consider a
 
point not properly raised on appeal, it is within its discretion
 to consider and correct an error not raised. Additionally, as a
 matter of jurisdiction, this issue needed to be addressed before
 the ICA could consider the other issues. As such, the ICA did
 not err in considering the issue of the October judgment even
 though neither party raised it as a point of error.
 
21
           
          
          
          
          
            
          
            
           
         *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
2. The ICA did not err in concluding that the October
judgment was a final and appealable judgment.
 
Second, the State argues that, even if the ICA could
 
raise the October judgment issue sua sponte, “the ICA erred in
 
giving the [October judgment] binding effect because it was not
 in fact a final judgment.” According to the State, the October
 judgment “was only a non-final, interim judgment.” 
HRS Chapter 658A provides statutory authority for 
courts to enter judgments on arbitration awards. HRS § 658A­25(a) (Supp. 2010) reads in full: “Upon granting an order confirming, vacating without directing a rehearing, modifying, or correcting an award, the court shall enter a judgment in conformity therewith. The judgment may be recorded, docketed, and enforced as any other judgment in a civil action.” Additionally, Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 58 
(2010) provides in part that the “filing of the judgment in the office of the clerk constitutes the entry of the judgment; and the judgment is not effective before such entry.” 
The October judgment, filed on October 1, 2010, reads 
in full as follows:
 
Pursuant to the 1) order granting in part and denying
in part motion to confirm arbitration award, entry of judgment and
allowing costs and other appropriate relief filed on May 18, 2010,
entered on OCT.- 1, 2010, 2) order denying Employer’s motion to
modify or correct award dated May 7, 2010, filed on July 18, 2010,
entered on OCT.- 1, 2010, and 3) order denying Employer’s motion
for leave to file motion to vacate award dated May 7, 2010, filed
orally on July 15, 2010, entered on OCT.- 1, 2010, Judgment is
hereby entered in conformity with the arbitration award filed on
 
22
           
         
         
       *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
May 18, 2010 in accordance with Section 658A-25(a), Hawaii Revised
Statutes, in favor of the Hawaii State Teachers Association and
against Employer, State of Hawaii, Department of Education.
This  judgment  is  entered  as  to  all  claims  raised  by  the
parties,  and  it  resolves  all  claims  by  and  against  the  parties  in
the  above-entitled  case.   No  claims  or  parties  remain.   Any  and
all  remaining  claims,  if  any,  are  dismissed  with  prejudice.
 
(Formatting altered) (emphasis added).
 
It is unclear how the October judgment could be
 
interpreted as anything other than a final judgment. It was
 
titled “JUDGMENT,” entered in accordance with HRS § 658A-25(a),
 which provides authority for courts to enter judgments on
 arbitration awards, and filed on October 1, 2010 pursuant to HRCP
 Rule 58. Additionally, the language of the judgment is plain and
 unambiguous. The judgment states in no uncertain terms:
 “[j]udgment is hereby entered in conformity with the arbitration
 award . . . in favor of [HSTA] and against [the State]”;
 “judgment is entered as to all claims . . . and resolves all
 claims”; “[n]o claims or parties remain”; and “[a]ny and all
 remaining claims, if any, are dismissed with prejudice.” Given
 its procedural conformity and clear, unambiguous language, the
 October judgment cannot be interpreted as anything other than
 what it was entitled--a judgment. See Wohlschlegel v. Uhlmann-
Kihei, Inc., 4 Haw. App. 123, 130, 662 P.2d 505, 511 (1983)
 (“Obviously, a court order which is unambiguous and certain on
 its face leaves no room for construction.”). As such, the
 State’s argument that the October judgment was merely a “non­
23
           
             
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
final, interim judgment” has no basis in the law or facts.
 
3.	 The ICA did not err in concluding that the October
judgment was final despite the State’s contention that
“outstanding issues” existed.
 
Third, the State argues that, even if the October 
judgment appeared to be initially final, the existence of 
outstanding issues rendered it non-final. The State relies on Contrades v. Reis, 112 Hawai' i 367, 145 P.3d 910 (App. 2006), for 
this argument. 
In Contrades, the plaintiff (John) filed an action
 
against a property owner, alleging co-ownership of a parcel of
 land. Id. at 368, 145 P.3d at 911. After the circuit court
 
entered an order and judgment in favor of the defendant, two
 significant filings were made: 1) John filed a timely motion for
 reconsideration that stayed the finality of the judgment, and 2)
 another party (Louise) filed a motion to intervene as a
 counterclaim defendant.
12 Id. The circuit court orally granted
 
Louise’s motion to intervene before entering a written order
 denying John’s motion for reconsideration. Id. at 368-69, 145
 
P.3d at 911-12. Now a party to the case, Louise moved to set
 aside the court’s judgment, arguing that it was no longer a final
 judgment pursuant to HRCP Rule 58 because it did not resolve all
 issues and claims. Id. at 369, 145 P.3d at 912. Additionally,
 
Louise contended that she was a co-owner of and had an interest in the
 
subject property. Id. at 368 n.3, 145 P.3d at 911 n.3.
 
24
 12           
          
          
          
       
        
          
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
both Louise and John filed notices of appeal from the circuit
 
court’s judgment. Id. The circuit court denied Louise’s motion
 
to set aside the judgment. Id. at 370, 145 P.3d at 913.
 
On appeal, the ICA explained that “a judgment, order,
 
or decree may not be appealed unless it is final” and that
 “[g]enerally, a judgment, order, or decree is not final unless it
 completely adjudicates all the claims or rights and liabilities
 of all the parties.” Id. (quoting Sturkie v. Han, 2 Haw. App.
 
140, 145-46, 627 P.2d 296, 301 (1981)). Then, the ICA concluded
 that:
 
prior to the time Louise and John filed their notices of
appeal, Louise had become a party. When Louise and John
 filed their notices of appeal, Louise was a party but her
defenses and affirmative defenses remained undecided. All
 claims against all parties not having been finally decided
when the notices of appeal were filed, we do not have
appellate jurisdiction.
 
Id. at 371, 145 P.3d at 914. Therefore, the ICA dismissed the
 
appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. Id.
 
The State argues that the Contrades case “is similar to
 
the present case” and points out that, in Contrades, the
 existence of an intervening party with new claims after the
 filing of the judgment destroyed the judgment’s finality. 
However, the current case can be distinguished from Contrades in
 a number of ways. First, Contrades involved an intervening party
 who raised new claims after the judgment was filed. The circuit
 court granted Louise’s motion to intervene before disposing of
 
25
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the motion for reconsideration; as a matter of law, the judgment
 
did not resolve all claims in the Contrades case. 
In contrast, in the current case, subsequent to the
 
October judgment, there were no new parties or new claims. 
Instead, new motions were filed seeking a different disposition
 of the same claims. Additionally, the State’s motion to vacate
 award and motion to modify award were both filed in July of 2010,
 before the circuit court entered its October judgment. The
 hearing on the State’s motion to modify was held in July, and the
 hearing on the State’s motion to vacate was held in September,
 both before the October judgment. Unlike in Contrades, where the
 court was unaware of another party’s claims until a motion to
 intervene was filed, the circuit court in the current case knew
 of the State’s arguments regarding the arbitrator’s award of
 interest before it entered the October judgment as to “all claims
 raised by the parties.” 
Thus, unlike in Contrades, no new parties or claims
 
were brought to the attention of the court prior to the judgment
 becoming final. The State’s argument that “outstanding issues”
 eviscerated the finality of the October judgment is unpersuasive.
 
26

4.	 The ICA erred in concluding that the circuit court did
not have the authority to enter a subsequent judgment
after HSTA filed a motion to amend; however, such error
was harmless because the ICA also addressed the
 substantive issues.
 
Finally under this point, the State argues that, even
 
if the October judgment was initially final, it was subsequently
 
set aside or rendered non-final by HSTA’s motion to alter or
 amend. 
This argument has merit. The procedural history of
 
this case, although convoluted, clearly shows that the circuit
 court entered a subsequent final judgment in February 2011, and
 that this final judgment was properly entered after an
 appropriate motion by HSTA.
 
Parties have many tools at their disposal in dealing
 
with an unfavorable judgment. For instance, pursuant to HRCP
 Rule 59, a party may petition for a new trial or file a motion to
 alter or amend a judgment. Specifically, HRCP Rule 59(e) (2000)
 provides that “[a]ny motion to alter or amend a judgment shall be
 filed no later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.” 
Additionally, pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) (2016), a party may
 file a notice of appeal “within 30 days after entry of the
 judgment or appealable order.” 
While neither party appealed the October judgment, HSTA
 
did file a timely post-judgment motion pursuant to HRCP Rule
 
27
           
           
          
         *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
59(e) seeking to amend the October judgment. This motion was
 
filed on October 11, 2010, within the ten day window mandated by
 HRCP Rule 59(e). On January 31, 2011, the circuit court entered
 an order granting HSTA’s motion to amend the October judgment.
13
   
While this order did not touch on the interest issue, it did note
 that “[a]n amended judgment consistent with this order shall be
 filed at an appropriate time.” On February 24, 2011, the circuit
 court entered a final judgment, which expressly entered judgment
 on six orders: 
Pursuant  to  the  1)  Order  Granting  In  Part  And  Denying
In  Part  Motion  To  Confirm  Arbitration  Award,  Entry  Of
Judgment  And  Allowing  Costs  And  Other  Appropriate  Relief

Revised  Statutes,  in  favor  of  Hawaii  State  Teachers
Association  (HSTA)  and  against  Employer,  State  of  Hawai'i,
Department  of  Education  (DOE)  on  the  reinstatement  and  back
pay  to  the  grievant  in  conformity  with  the  arbitration  award
filed  on  May  18,  2010,  and  in  favor  of  the  DOE  and  against
HSTA  on  the  10%  interest  on  the  back  pay  in  the  arbitration
award  and  on  HSTA’s  request  for  fees.
This  final  judgment  is  entered  as  to  all  claims  raised
by  the  parties,  and  it  resolves  all  claims  by  and  against
the  parties  in  the  above-entitled  case.   No  claims  or
 
parties  remain.
 
(Emphasis added.) 
The ICA’s HSTA II opinion explained that, under this court’s decision in
 
Sakuma, the January 31, 2011 order constituted the effective disposition of
HSTA’s motion. HSTA II , 2016 WL 5719745, at *7.
 
28
 13           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Thus, HSTA’s motion to amend the October judgment 
essentially opened the door for the circuit court to enter 
another judgment, one that was unfavorable to HSTA. See Wong v. 
Wong, 79 Hawai' i 26, 30, 897 P.2d 953, 957 (1995) (“Once a valid 
judgment is entered, the only means by which a circuit court may thereafter alter or amend it is by appropriate motion under HRCP 59(e).”). As such, the ICA erred in concluding that the circuit court lacked authority to enter the February judgment. 
However, regardless of whether the ICA erred in
 
ultimately concluding that the October judgment was the final
 judgment in this case, such an error is harmless because the ICA
 then went on to address the substantive claims: “Even assuming,
 
arguendo, that the Circuit Court could have vacated in part the
 Award, after entering the 10/1/10 Judgment on the Order
 
Confirming Award, we conclude that the Circuit Court erred in
 doing so in this case.” HSTA II, 2016 WL 5719745, at *9. The
 
ICA subsequently provided an in-depth analysis for this
 conclusion. Id. at *9-10.
 
As such, our disposition of this case turns on the
 
ICA’s analysis and ultimate conclusion as to the substantive
 issues, as detailed in the following section.
 
B. The Arbitrator’s Award of Prejudgment Interest
 
The State argues that even if the ICA did not err on
 
29
           
           
         
  
        
  
  
     
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the procedural issues, it did err in its resolution of the
 
substantive issues. According to the State, the ICA erred in
 upholding the arbitrator’s award of prejudgment interest for two
 reasons. First, the State contends that the ICA erred when it
 concluded that the award of prejudgment interest did not violate
 the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Second, the State contends
 that the ICA erred in not applying the public policy exception to
 arbitrations. As such, the State asserts that the circuit court
 properly vacated the arbitrator’s award of prejudgment interest.
 
Before addressing the State’s substantive arguments
 
here, an overview of the statutory framework for vacating an
 arbitration award provides useful context.
 
“[J]udicial review of an arbitration award is confined 
to the ‘strictest possible limits,’ and a court may only vacate an award on the grounds specified in HRS § 658A-23 and modify or correct on the grounds specified in HRS § 658A-24.” SHOPO, 135 
Hawai'i at 461, 353 P.3d at 1003 (alteration in original) 
(quoting Daiichi, 103 Hawai' i at 336, 82 P.3d at 422). 
HRS § 658A-23 provides six grounds that a court can
 
rely on when vacating an arbitration award:
 
(a) Upon motion to the court by a party to an arbitration
proceeding, the court shall vacate an award made in the
arbitration proceeding if:
(1) The award was procured by corruption, fraud, or
other undue means;
(2) There was:
(A) Evident partiality by an arbitrator
appointed as a neutral arbitrator;
 
30
           
     
      
       
        
      
       
      
       
      
      
        
     
      
       
 
      
        
        
        *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(B) Corruption by an arbitrator; or
(C) Misconduct by an arbitrator prejudicing the
rights of a party to the arbitration proceeding;
(3) An arbitrator refused to postpone the hearing upon
showing of sufficient cause for postponement, refused
to consider evidence material to the controversy, or
otherwise conducted the hearing contrary to section
658A-15, so as to prejudice substantially the rights
of a party to the arbitration proceeding;
(4) An arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator’s powers;
(5) There was no agreement to arbitrate, unless the
person participated in the arbitration proceeding
without raising the objection under section 658A-15(c)
not later than the beginning of the arbitration
hearing; or
(6) The arbitration was conducted without proper
notice of the initiation of an arbitration as required
in section 658A-9 so as to prejudice substantially the
rights of a party to the arbitration proceeding.
 
In this case, the relevant subsection of this statute
 
is part (a)(4) because the State contends that the arbitrator’s
 
interest award “exceeded the arbitrator’s powers.” “In
 determining whether an arbitrator has exceeded his or her
 authority under the agreement, ‘there should be no second
 guessing by the court’ of the arbitrator’s interpretation of his
 or her authority so long as the arbitrator’s interpretation
 ‘could have rested on an interpretation and application of the
 agreement.’” 
SHOPO, 135 Hawai' i at 463, 353 P.3d at 1005 
(quoting Local Union 1260 Int’l Bhd. of Elec. Workers v. Hawaiian
 Tel. Co., 49 Haw. 53, 56, 411 P.2d 134, 136 (1966)).
 
We now address the State’s specific arguments regarding
 
the arbitrator’s award of prejudgment interest. 
1.	 The ICA correctly concluded that the State waived its
sovereign immunity in the arbitration proceedings.
 
“The doctrine of sovereign immunity ‘refers to the
 
31
           
         
          
        
       
        
          
        
        
          *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
general rule, incorporated in the Eleventh Amendment to the 
United States Constitution, that a state cannot be sued in federal court without its consent or an express waiver of its immunity. The doctrine also precludes such suits in state courts.’” Nelson v. Hawaiian Homes Comm’n, 130 Hawai' i 162, 168, 
307 P.3d 142, 148 (2013) (quoting Sierra Club v. Dep’t of Transp., 120 Hawai' i 181, 225-26, 202 P.3d 1226, 1270-71 (2009)). 
See also Taylor-Rice v. State, 105 Hawai' i 104, 109, 94 P.3d 659, 
664 (2004) (“[T]he State’s liability is limited by its sovereign immunity, except where there has been a ‘clear relinquishment’ of immunity and the State has consented to be sued.” (quoting Bush v. Watson, 81 Hawai' i 474, 481, 918 P.2d 1130, 1137 (1996))). 
When determining whether the State has waived its sovereign immunity, Hawai' i has adopted the following guidance from federal 
law: 
(1) a waiver of the Government’s sovereign immunity will be
strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the
sovereign; (2) a waiver of sovereign immunity must be
unequivocally expressed in statutory text; (3) a statute’s
legislative history cannot supply a waiver that does not
appear clearly in any statutory text; (4) it is not a
court’s right to extend the waiver of sovereign immunity
more broadly than has been directed by the [legislature];
and (5) sovereign immunity is not to be waived by policy
arguments[.]
 
Kaleikini v. Yoshioka, 129 Hawai' i 454, 467, 304 P.3d 252, 265 
(2013) (alteration in original) (quoting Taylor-Rice, 105 Hawai' i 
at 110, 94 P.3d at 665). 
The State argues that the ICA erred in holding that the
 
32
           
            
              
            
             
            
          
               
     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
State had waived its sovereign immunity with respect to the 
arbitrator’s award of interest against the State. According to the State, the ICA’s decision regarding sovereign immunity directly conflicts with HRS § 661-8 (1993),
14 and two Hawai' i 
cases: Taylor-Rice and Garner v. State Dep’t of Educ., 122 
Hawai'i 150, 223 P.3d 215 (App. 2009). The State contends that 
these two cases held that a general waiver of sovereign immunity is not enough to specifically waive sovereign immunity as to prejudgment interest and that “any waiver of sovereign immunity is to be strictly construed in favor of the State.” 
In Taylor-Rice, this court considered the following 
question in the context of a tort case: “Whether Appellee State of Hawai' i, as a joint and several judgment debtor to [the 
plaintiffs] under [HRS §] 663-10.9 . . . must pay statutory interest on the full value of the judgment per [HRS] § 478-3, or may pay only limited interest under section 662-8?” 105 Hawai' i 
at 109, 94 P.3d at 664 (alteration in original). This court concluded that the State was not required to pay prejudgment interest for three reasons. First, this court noted that “the 
HRS § 661-8 (1993) provides that “[n]o interest shall be allowed on any 
claim up to the time of the rendition of judgment thereon by the court, unless
upon a contract expressly stipulating for the payment of interest, or upon arefund of a payment into the ‘litigated claims fund’ as provided by law.”This court has held that this statute immunizes the State against awards ofinterest unless the State has expressly or statutorily waived its sovereignimmunity. Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of Emps.’ Ret. Sys. , 106 Hawai 'i 416, 433, 106 
P.3d 339, 356 (2005). 
33
 14           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
State was not found to be jointly and severally liable for pre­
judgment interest on the plaintiffs’ damages.” Id. at 110, 94
 
P.3d at 665. Second, this court explained that the plaintiffs
 
waived this claim because they did not challenge the circuit
 court’s failure to hold the State liable for prejudgment
 interest. Id. at 111, 94 P.3d at 666. Finally, this court noted
 
that “HRS § 662-2 provides in clear and unambiguous language that
 ‘the State . . . shall not be liable for interest prior to
 
judgment’” and that this “constitutes a plain reservation of
 immunity with respect to pre-judgment interest on judgments
 
rendered against the State.” Id.
 
Similarly, in Garner, the ICA held that the State had 
not waived its sovereign immunity from an award of prejudgment interest in a case brought by a class action of substitute teachers seeking backpay. 122 Hawai' i at 162-63, 223 P.3d at 
227-28. The circuit court held that the doctrine of sovereign immunity did not bar the plaintiffs’ claim for breach-of-contract damages, but that it did bar the plaintiffs’ claim for prejudgment interest. Id. at 156, 223 P.3d at 221. The ICA 
affirmed the circuit court on these issues. Citing HRS § 661-8, which provides that “[n]o interest shall be allowed on any claim [against the State] up to the time of the rendition of judgment thereon by the court,” the ICA determined that the circuit court 
34
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
did not err in denying the substitute teachers’ request for
 
prejudgment interest. Id. at 163, 223 P.3d at 228.
 
While both Taylor-Rice and Garner hold that prejudgment 
interest cannot be awarded against the State in court proceedings, neither of these cases address the issue of prejudgment interest in arbitration proceedings. As such, they are distinguishable from the case before us. This court has not reached the specific issue presented in the current case; however, other jurisdictions, including the federal district court of Hawai' i, have considered this issue. 
In Kenneth H. Hughes, Inc. v. Aloha Tower Development, 
Corp., 654 F. Supp. 2d 1142 (D. Haw. 2009), the United States District Court for the District of Hawai' i (district court) 
considered an issue almost identical to the one before this court. Hughes involved an arbitration award for damages relating 
to a contract dispute between the State of Hawai' i and a Texas 
corporation, Hughes, over the development of the Aloha Tower complex in Honolulu. Id. at 1144-45. After the project failed, 
Hughes filed a demand for arbitration pursuant to their Development Agreement, which required that disputes be brought before a mediator or arbitrator within the jurisdiction of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Id. at 1145. The arbitrator 
awarded Hughes over $900,000 in reliance damages, over $270,000 
35
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
in pre-award interest, and more than $60,000 in attorneys’ fees
 
and costs. Id. The State filed a motion to vacate or modify the
 
arbitration award with the district court, arguing, inter alia,
 that the award of interest violated the State’s sovereign
 immunity.
 
Before addressing the issues before it, the district
 
court explained that the FAA “provides limited circumstances
 under which a federal court may vacate or modify a binding
 arbitration award” and that “[t]his authority is extremely narrow
 and designed to preserve due process but not to permit
 unnecessary intrusion into private arbitration procedures.” Id. 
The district court also noted that 9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(4) provides
 that a federal court may vacate an arbitration award “where the
 
arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed
 them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject
 
matter submitted was not made.” Id. at 1146. The district court
 
further explained that the “Ninth Circuit has interpreted Section
 (4) of the FAA, when an arbitrator exceeds its powers, to
 encompass situations where an arbitrator’s decision is
 ‘completely irrational’ or exhibits a ‘manifest disregard of
 law.’” Id. (quoting Kyocera Corp. v. Prudential-Bache Trade
 
Servs., 341 F.3d 987, 997 (9th Cir. 2003)).
 
In analyzing the State’s sovereign immunity claim, the
 
36
           
       
          
        
           
       
         
          
        
        
            
         *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
district court construed the State’s argument to be that the
 
arbitrator exceeded his power under 9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(4) of the
 FAA. Id. at 1148. The district court explained that, in order
 
to prevail, the State “must demonstrate that the arbitrator’s
 decision to include interest was ‘completely irrational’ or
 exhibited a ‘manifest disregard of law’ in violation of the
 State’s sovereign immunity protections.” Id. at 1148-49. The
 
district court concluded that the State “fail[ed] to meet this
 exceedingly high burden” for the following reasons. Id. at 1149.
 
First, the district court explained that, while Hawai' i 
law does prohibit courts from awarding prejudgment interest, there is no Hawai' i law that prohibits arbitrators from making 
such awards: 
Respondent relies on case law and Hawaii statute
regarding pre- and postjudgments made in a court of law as
evidence of the arbitrator’s error. But the arbitrator’s
 decision is not a judgment of a court of law. Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (“HRS”) section 661-8, relied on by
Respondent, states that: “No interest shall be allowed on
 
any claim up to the time of the rendition of judgment
 
thereon by the court , unless upon a contract expressly
stipulating for the payment of interest.” The arbitration
 
demand was not a claim and the award was not a judgment by
the court, and therefore HRS § 661-8 is not controlling.
 
Id.
 
Second, the district court determined that the State
 
“explicitly availed itself of arbitration.” Id. The district
 
court explained that the agreement that the State and Hughes
 
entered into stated that “any claims or disputes, not resolved in
 
37
           
         
         
         
       
          
           
       *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
good faith, may be brought before a mediator or arbitrator within
 
the jurisdiction of the FAA.” Id. As such, the district court
 
determined that “the arbitrator did not manifestly disregard the
 law when determining that the State waived sovereign immunity as
 to interest in conjunction with its waiver as to damages.” Id. 
The district court explained its reasoning for this
 determination:
 
Because the FAA explicitly lists the grounds upon which a
court may vacate, courts will not find a manifest disregard
of the law where an arbitrator merely interprets or applies
the governing law incorrectly, and confirmation is required
even if an arbitrator makes an erroneous finding of fact. .
. . Rather, “it must be clear from the record that the
 arbitrators recognized the applicable law and then ignored
it.”
 
Id. at 1146 (quoting Mich. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Unigard Sec. Ins.
 
Co., 44 F.3d 826, 832 (9th Cir. 1995)).
 
Although not controlling, Hughes is persuasive for
 
three reasons. First, the FAA’s statutory framework analyzed in
 Hughes is nearly identical to that of Hawaii’s Uniform
 Arbitration Act. For instance, under both the FAA and HRS
 Chapter 658A, courts may vacate arbitration decisions where,
 inter alia, “the arbitrators exceeded their powers.” 9 U.S.C. §
 10(a); see also HRS § 658A-23(a)(4). Similarly, under both the
 FAA and HRS Chapter 658A, courts may modify or correct an
 arbitration award on three grounds: where there was a
 mathematical miscalculation of the award, where there was an
 award on a claim or matter not submitted to the arbitrator, or
 
38
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
where the award was “imperfect in matter of form not affecting
 
the merits of the controversy.” 9 U.S.C. § 11; see also HRS §
 658A-24(a). 
In both Hughes and the current case, the State claimed 
that the arbitrator had exceeded his authority in awarding the prevailing party prejudgment interest. According to the district court, an arbitrator exceeds its powers only when the arbitrator’s decision is “completely irrational” or “exhibits a manifest disregard for the law.” Hughes, 654 F. Supp. 2d at 
1146. Although Hawai' i courts use a different standard for 
determining whether an arbitrator has exceeded his or her powers, the standard is similar in that it strongly curtails the court’s ability to vacate an arbitrator’s award on such grounds: “In determining whether an arbitrator has exceeded his or her authority under the agreement, ‘there should be no second guessing by the court’ of the arbitrator’s interpretation of his or her authority so long as the arbitrator’s interpretation ‘could have rested on an interpretation and application of the agreement.’” SHOPO, 135 Hawai' i at 463, 353 P.3d at 1005 
(quoting Local Union 1260, 49 Haw. at 56, 411 P.2d at 136). As such, although the district court relied, in part, on the FAA in reaching its decision, Hawaii’s arbitration law mirrors the federal law in important ways.

Hughes*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Second, the district court’s analysis of the
 
applicability of HRS § 661-8 to arbitration proceedings is
 
reasonable and supported by the statutory framework of HRS
 Chapter 658A. The language of HRS § 661-8 clearly states that
 interest shall not be awarded against the State through a
 “judgment thereon by the court.” HRS § 661-8 does not state that
 an arbitrator is prohibited from awarding prejudgment interest
 against the State. This reading is supported by HRS § 658A-21(c)
 (Supp. 2010), which provides that arbitrators are authorized to
 award remedies a court might be prohibited from granting: 
As to all remedies other than those authorized by
subsections (a) and (b), an arbitrator may order such
remedies as the arbitrator considers just and appropriate
under the circumstances of the arbitration proceeding . The
 
fact that such a remedy could not or would not be granted by
the court is not a ground for refusing to confirm an award
under section 658A-22 or for vacating an award under section
658A-23 .
 
(Emphasis added.) Thus, HRS § 661-8 appears to be inapplicable
 
in the arbitration context under the facts of this case.
 
Third and finally, as in Hughes, the State in the
 
current case availed itself of the arbitration proceedings. The
 district court in Hughes noted that the State “explicitly availed
 itself of arbitration in paragraph 21 of the Development
 
Agreement,” which stated that “any claims or disputes, not
 resolved in good faith, may be brought before a mediator or
 
arbitrator within the jurisdiction of the FAA.” , 654 F.
 Supp. 2d at 1149.

  15 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Similarly, in the current case, the State was a party 
to the collective bargaining agreement, which explicitly provided 
for disputes to go to arbitration and stated that “[t]he arbitrator may award back pay to compensate the teacher wholly or partially for any salary lost.” This court has recognized that “arbitrators have the authority to make an award of interest as 
part of the determination of the total amount of compensation to which the prevailing party is entitled” and that prejudgment 
interest is “an element of complete compensation.” Hamada v. 
Westcott, 102 Hawai' i 210, 217, 74 P.3d 33, 40 (2003) (quoting 
Kalawaia v. AIG Haw. Ins. Co., 90 Hawai' i 167, 172-73, 977 P.2d 
175, 180-81 (1999)).
15 Thus, under Hawai' i law, the arbitrator’s 
interpretation of “wholly compensate” was a reasonable reading of the agreement and the arbitrator did not exceed his authority in awarding prejudgment interest against the State. See also State 
v. Alaska Pub. Emps. Ass’n, 199 P.3d 1161, 1165 (Alaska 2008)
 (“Considering the closeness of this question, the policy favoring
 effective arbitration, and the fairness of awarding interest, we
 
This court in Kalawaia concluded that “where the entire dispute is 
submitted to arbitration and pre-award interest is not specifically excluded
by contract, arbitrators have the authority to make an award of interest aspart of the determination of the total amount of compensation to which theprevailing party is entitled.” 90 Hawai 'i at 173 n.11, 977 P.2d at 181 n.11.
This court explained that this conclusion “is sensible because the award of interest is an element of compensation, and the entire dispute has beensubmitted to arbitration to determine the amount of compensation due to theinjured party.” Id. The Kalawaia holding supports our conclusion in the
present case, as pre-award interest was not specifically excluded by thearbitration agreement.

           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
are unable to conclude that the arbitrator’s decision to award
 
prejudgment interest against the State was gross error.”); John
 Rocchio Corp. v. Town of Coventry, 919 A.2d 418, 419-20 (R.I.
 2007) (upholding an arbitrator’s award of prejudgment interest
 against a town after noting that the court has limited authority
 to vacate an arbitration award).
 
Given the broad discretion afforded to arbitrators and
 
the strict limits confining judicial review of arbitration
 awards, the State’s argument that the arbitrator exceeded his
 powers is unavailing. For these reasons, the ICA did not err in
 concluding that the State waived its sovereign immunity in the
 arbitration proceedings, even as to the issue of interest.
 
2.	 The ICA correctly concluded that the public policy
exception to arbitrations does not apply in this case.
 
The State argues that the ICA also erred when it 
“ignored the public policy exception” to arbitration awards. 
The State contends that sovereign immunity is an explicit public
 policy and that the violation of the public policy exception was
 “clearly shown” when “the arbitrator awarded pre-judgment
 interest despite the fact that the Collective Bargaining
 Agreement did not ‘expressly’ provide for interest and despite
 the rule requiring strict construction of waiver.” 
Hawai'i recognizes a “limited public policy exception 
to the general deference given arbitration awards.”

Inlandboatmen’s Union of the Pac. v. Sause Bros., 77 Hawai' i 187, 
194, 881 P.2d 1255, 1262 (App. 1994). Quoting the Supreme Court 
of the United States, the ICA explained the exception: 
A court’s refusal to enforce an arbitrator’s award . .
 
. because it is contrary to public policy is a specific
application of the more general doctrine, rooted in the
common law, that a court may refuse to enforce contracts
that violate law or public policy. [The ‘public policy’
exception] derives from the basic notion that no court will
lend its aid to one who founds a cause of action upon an
immoral or illegal act, and is further justified by the
observation that the public’s interests in confining the
scope of private agreements to which it is not a party will
go unrepresented unless the judiciary takes account of those
interests when it considers whether to enforce such
 agreements.
 
Id. at 193, 881 P.2d at 1261 (quoting United Paperworkers Int’l 
Union v. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 42 (1987)). The public policy exception is applicable only in cases where enforcing an arbitration award or contract would involve illegality or violate public policy. SHOPO, 135 Hawai' i at 465-67, 353 P.3d at 1007­
09; see also Inlandboatmen, 77 Hawai' i at 194, 881 P.2d at 1262 
(providing examples of Hawai' i courts applying the public policy 
exception). 
The public policy exception is inapplicable in this
 
case. We have already determined in the previous section that
 the State waived its sovereign immunity as to the arbitration
 proceedings. Additionally, we have determined that the
 arbitrator operated within his considerable discretion when he
 interpreted the collective bargaining agreement to include an
 award of prejudgment interest. Thus, an arbitrator’s reasonable
 
43
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
award against the State when the State has availed itself of
 
arbitration and waived its sovereign immunity is not against
 public policy or illegal. As such, the ICA did not err in
 dismissing the State’s contention that the public policy
 exception to arbitration awards should apply in this case.
 
C. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs on Appeal
 
“In contrast to compensation awarded to a party, the 
well-accepted ‘American rule’ is that ‘in absence of contract or 
statute a litigant has no inherent right to have his [or her] attorney’s fees paid by his [or her] opponent.’” Hamada, 102 
Hawai'i at 217, 74 P.3d at 40 (alteration in original) (quoting 
Larsen v. Pacesetter Sys. Inc., 74 Haw. 1, 51, 837 P.2d 1273, 1297 (1992)); see also Sierra Club, 120 Hawai' i at 218, 202 P.3d 
at 1263 (“[P]ursuant to the ‘American Rule,’ each party is responsible for paying his or her own litigation expenses. This general rule, however, is subject to a number of exceptions: attorney’s fees are chargeable against the opposing party when so authorized by statute, rule of court, agreement, stipulation, or precedent.”) 
In the current case, the ICA awarded HSTA fees and
 
costs incurred at the appellate level pursuant to HRS § 658A-25. 
The State asserts that the ICA erred in this regard because HRS §
 658A-25 does not provide for an award of fees and costs at the

       16 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
appellate level.16 This is an issue of first impression for this
 
court. 
1.	 The ICA did not err in awarding fees and costs pursuant
to HRS § 658A-25.
 
HRS § 658A-25 (2016), “Judgment on award; attorney’s
 
fees and litigation expenses,” provides in full:
 
(a) Upon granting an order confirming, vacating without
directing a rehearing, modifying, or correcting an award,
the court shall enter a judgment in conformity therewith.
The judgment may be recorded, docketed, and enforced as any
other judgment in a civil action.
(b) A court may allow reasonable costs of the motion and
subsequent judicial proceedings.
(c) On application of a prevailing party to a contested
judicial proceeding under section 658A-22, 658A-23, or 658A­24, the court may add reasonable attorney’s fees and other
reasonable expenses of litigation incurred in a judicial
proceeding after the award is made to a judgment confirming,
vacating without directing a rehearing, modifying, or
correcting an award.
 
The State points out that “court” is defined as “any
 
district or circuit court of competent jurisdiction in this
 
State, unless otherwise indicated.” HRS § 658A-1 (2016). The
 State contends that HRS § 658A-25(b) and (c), when read in
 conjunction with the definition section found in HRS § 658A-1,
 
The State presents two other arguments under this section. First, the 
State argues that HSTA should not have prevailed on appeal and is therefore
not entitled to fees and costs. Because we held in the previous section thatthe ICA did not err in concluding that HSTA was the prevailing party onappeal, we do not address this argument further. Second, the State arguesthat sovereign immunity protects the State against an award of attorneys’ fees and costs. This argument also fails because HRS § 658A-25 expressly allowsfor an award of fees and costs to the prevailing party in a contested judicialproceeding. The State availed itself of HRS Chapter 658A when it entered intoan arbitration agreement with HSTA; this serves as a statutory waiver of theState’s sovereign immunity with regard to attorneys’ fees and costs under the Chapter as well. See Sierra Club , 120 Hawai 'i at 228-29, 202 P.3d at 1273-74
(holding that a statutory waiver of the State’s sovereign immunity as to theunderlying claim also waives the State’s sovereign immunity as to attorneys’fees resulting from the litigation of that claim). 
45
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
provide for an award of fees and costs only at the circuit or
 
district court level.
 
However, the legislative history reveals that the
 
statute was not intended to be interpreted so narrowly. The
 Hawai'i legislature enacted Chapter 658A in 2001 in order to 
“standardize Hawaii’s arbitration laws with those used in other
 states by replacing the current statutory chapter on arbitration
 and awards with the Uniform Arbitration Act.” Conf. Comm. Rep.
 No. 115, in 2001 House Journal, at 1093, 2001 Senate Journal, at
 905. Under its original iteration in 2001, “court” was defined
 as “the circuit court of the appropriate judicial circuit in this
 State, unless otherwise indicated.” 2001 Haw. Sess. Laws Act
 265, § 1 at 810. In 2006, the legislature amended the definition
 to include district courts for the following reasons:
 
Under  the  existing  laws,  the  district  courts  have
exclusive  jurisdiction  over  civil  claims  in  which  the
disputed  amount  is  $10,000  or  less.   However,  the  circuit
courts  have  exclusive  jurisdiction  over  disputes  subject  to
arbitration  regardless  of  the  amount  in  dispute.   Many
disputes  subject  to  arbitration  are  well  below  the  $10,000
limit  at  which  the  district  courts  would  normally  have
jurisdiction.   The  legislature  finds  that  this  is  not  an
economical  or  efficient  use  of  judicial  resources  and  it
discourages  the  use  of  arbitration  in  the  area  of  small
disputes.   Therefore,  the  mere  existence  of  an  arbitration
agreement  should  not  impact  which  court  has  jurisdiction
over  civil  claims.
 
The  purpose  of  this  Act  is  to  give  the  district  courts
jurisdiction  over  civil  actions  subject  to  arbitration
agreements  where  the  amount  in  dispute  is  less  than  $10,000,
unless  the  arbitration  is  subject  to  chapter  89,  chapter
377,  or  the  National  Labor  Relations  Act.
 
2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 72, § 1 at 128.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The legislative history shows that the legislature, in
 
defining “court,” was interested in articulating which court had
 
jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings when the litigation
 was initiated; nothing in the legislative history indicates that
 the legislature intended that “court” be limited to the district
 or circuit courts after these initial proceedings were appealed.
 
This interpretation is supported by the commentary to
 
the 2000 Revised Uniform Arbitration Act (UAA), which HRS Chapter
 658A is modeled after. Under the UAA, “court” is defined as “a
 court of competent jurisdiction in this State.” Unif.
 Arbitration Act § 1 (Nat’l Conference of Comm’rs on Unif. State
 Laws 2000). Significantly, the commentary to this section
 explains that “[d]ifferent States determine which court in its
 system has jurisdiction over arbitration matters in the first
 instance.” UAA § 1 cmt. n.3 (emphasis added). As such, the UAA
 directs states to define “court” in order to resolve the issue of
 which court, district or circuit, a party turns to when initially
 contesting an arbitration award.
 
17
 Additionally, commentary to UAA § 25  explains the
HRS § 658A-25(c) was modeled after UAA § 25(c) and the two sections are
 
nearly identical. UAA § 25(c) provides:
 
On [application] of a prevailing party to a contested
judicial proceeding under Section 22, 23, or 24, the court
may add reasonable attorney’s fees and other reasonable
expenses of litigation incurred in a judicial proceeding
after the award is made to a judgment confirming, vacating
without directing a rehearing, modifying, or correcting an
award.

        *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
policy behind allowing courts to award attorneys’ fees and costs
 
in a contested judicial proceeding. Notably, the policy
 articulated in the commentary applies equally to trial and
 appellate courts reviewing arbitration awards:
 
Section 25(c) promotes the statutory policy of
finality of arbitration awards by adding a provision for
recovery of reasonable attorney’s fees and reasonable
expenses of litigation to prevailing parties in contested
judicial actions to confirm, vacate, modify or correct an
award. Potential liability for the opposing parties’ post-
award litigation expenditures will tend to discourage all
but the most meritorious challenges of arbitration awards.
If a party prevails in a contested judicial proceeding over
an arbitration award, Section 25(c) allows the court
discretion to award attorney’s fees and litigation expenses.
 
UAA § 25 cmt. n.3 (emphasis added). As such, attorneys’
 
fees serve the purpose of discouraging a party from a
 nonmeritorious challenge to an arbitration award; this holds
 true even for appellate proceedings, as other jurisdictions
 have noted.
 
For instance, in Blitz v. Beth Isaac Adas Israel
 
Congregation, 720 A.2d 912, 920 (Md. 1998), the Court of Appeals
 of Maryland concluded that, under a statute substantially similar
 to HRS § 658A-25, “the prevailing party is entitled to recover
 attorneys’ fees incurred both at trial and on appeal in
 confirming and enforcing an arbitration award.” In making this
 decision, the Maryland court noted that there was a “significant
 difference” between the initial arbitration proceedings, where
 attorneys’ fees are only allowed if provided for in the
 arbitration agreement, and the subsequent confirmation
 
48
           
        
       
      
      
          
        
        
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
proceedings. Id. at 917. In the confirmation proceedings, the
 
Maryland court explained that the UAA specifically provides for
 
attorneys’ fees because such a policy encourages speedy
 resolutions of arbitration disputes. Id. at 917-18. The
 
Maryland court also noted that other jurisdictions have
 recognized the importance of preventing drawn-out confirmation
 proceedings:
 
The interpretations of our sister states also promote the
public policy of encouraging early payment of valid
arbitration awards and the discouragement of nonmeritorious
protracted confirmation challenges. The prefatory comment
to the 1954 draft of the Uniform Arbitration Act stated that
 court intervention in arbitration ‘must be prompt and simple
or the values of arbitration will be largely dissipated
through prolonged litigation.’
 
Id. (quoting Canon Sch. Dist. No. 50 v. W.E.S. Constr. Co., 882
 
P.2d 1274, 1279 (Ariz. 1994)); see also Buzas Baseball, Inc. v.
 Salt Lake Trappers, Inc., 925 P.2d 941, 952-53 (Utah 1996)
 (holding that petitioners, who had received an arbitration award,
 were entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in defending
 the award on appeal under the Utah Arbitration Act). 
Given the legislative history of HRS Chapter 658A, the
 
language and commentary of the UAA, and the guidance offered by
 other jurisdictions, we conclude that the ICA did not err in
 awarding HSTA attorneys’ fees and costs on appeal pursuant to
 HRS § 658A-25.
 
V. CONCLUSION
 
For the reasons stated above, the ICA’s November 21,
 
49
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
2016 judgment on appeal, which 1) vacated in part the circuit
 
court’s February 24, 2011 final judgment, 2) reversed the circuit
 court’s January 4, 2011 orders, 3) affirmed the circuit court’s
 January 31, 2011 order, and 4) granted HSTA’s request for fees
 and costs, is affirmed.
