Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant 
(“OVUII”) in violation of the Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 
291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) and HRS § 291E-61(b)(1) (Supp. 2009) and one count of Accidents involving Damage to Vehicle or 
2
Property in violation of HRS § 291C-13 (Supp. 2011)  (hereinafterreferred to as Count II). On April 12, 2012, after Petitioner appeared in the court for trial (February 1, 2011) and after Petitioner filed his opening brief in the ICA (January 17, 2012) and before the ICA issued its SDO in this case (June 29, 2012), this Court in State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 56, 276 P.3d 617, 
625 (2012), held that a charge that fails to allege the requisite state of mind does not provide fair notice to the accused of the nature and cause of the accusation. 
In his Application, Petitioner only raises a challenge
 
to the sufficiency of the Complaint with respect to Count II,
 which charged him with Accidents Involving Damage to Vehicle or
 
2
 HRS § 291C-13 (Supp. 2011) states in relevant part:
 
The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident resulting
only in damage to a vehicle or other property that is driven
or attended by any person shall immediately stop such
vehicle at the scene of the accident or as close thereto as
 possible, but shall forthwith return to, and in every event
shall remain at, the scene of the accident until the driver
has fulfilled the requirements of section 291C-14. Every
such stop shall be made without obstructing traffic more
than is necessary. For any violation under this section, a
surcharge of up to $100 may be imposed, in addition to other
penalties, which shall be deposited into the trauma system
special fund.

Property in violation of HRS § 291C-13. Petitioner claims that
 
Count II failed to allege the requisite intentional, knowing, and
 reckless states of mind required to “‘alert the defendant[] of
 precisely what [he] needs to defend against to avoid a
 conviction.’” (Quoting 
Nesmith,  127 Hawai' i at 56, 276 P.3d at 
625.) Therefore, he asserts that the charge should be dismissed
 pursuant to this court’s opinion in Nesmith. Petitioner also
 argued that Count II was fatally defective under Hawai' i Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 7(d)
3
 because state of mind is an
“essential fact” but was not alleged.
 
In 
State v. Maharaj, No. SCWC-29520, --- P.3d ----,
 
2013 WL 6068086, at *5 (Haw. Nov. 18, 2013), we reaffirmed the
 “core principle” set out in State v. Apollonio, 130 Hawai' i 353, 
3
 (HRPP) Rule 7(d) states in relevant part:
 
The charge shall be a plain, concise and definite statement of the
essential facts constituting the offense charged. An indictment
shall be signed by the prosecutor and the foreperson of the grand
jury. An information shall be signed by the prosecutor. A
complaint shall be signed by the prosecutor. The charge need not
contain a formal conclusion or any other matter not necessary to
such statement. Allegations made in one count may be incorporated
by reference in another count. It may be alleged in a single count
that the means by which the defendant committed the offense are
unknown or that the defendant committed it by one or more
specified means. The charge shall state for each count the
official or customary citation of the statute, rule, regulation or
other provision of law which the defendant is alleged therein to
have violated. Formal defects, including erroneous reference to
the statute, rule, regulation or other provision of law, or the
omission of such reference, shall not be ground for dismissal of
the charge or for reversal of a conviction if the defect did not
prejudice the defendant.

311 P.3d 676 (2013), that “‘[a] charge that fails to charge a 
requisite state of mind cannot be construed reasonabl[y] to state an offense and thus the charge is dismissed without prejudice because it violates due process.’” Id. at *5 (quoting Apollonio, 
130 Hawai' i at 539, 311 P.3d at 682). We also held that “as a 
fact that must be alleged in a charge, a requisite state of mind is clearly an essential fact that must be alleged under HRPP Rule 7(d).” Id. at *5 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, 
inasmuch as Count II of the Complaint against Petitioner failed to allege the requisite state of mind, Count II must be dismissed without prejudice. Id. at *5. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the July 26, 2012 judgment of
 
the ICA and the February 3, 2011 Notice of Entry of Judgment
 and/or Order and Pleas/Judgment of the court are vacated, and
 this case is remanded to the court with instructions to dismiss
 Count II of the Complaint without prejudice.
