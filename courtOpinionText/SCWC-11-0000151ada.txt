  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the statute applies, the circuit court should make a finding, on 
the record, as to whether the Association of Apartment Owners of 
Discovery Bay (“AOAO”) refused to mediate this dispute, and if 
so, the circuit court should take into consideration such 
refusal in determining whether to award attorneys’ fees and 
costs. We also hold that, on remand, the circuit court shall determine whether four time entries were correctly billed to the 
instant matter.  
II. Background 
On August 30, 2010, 
the AOAO filed a complaint against 
Ralph Mitchell, a condominium owner in the AOAO, for declaratory 
and injunctive relief. The Complaint alleged that on August 11, 
2010, Mitchell submitted a petition to the AOAO to conduct a 
special meeting of the AOAO to remove one or more of the AOAO 
Board members. The AOAO alleged that the petition did not 
contain at least 25% of the owners’ signatures, contrary to the 
requirements of HRS § 514B-121(b) (Supp. 2008).  According to the AOAO, Mitchell insisted that he intended to hold a special 
meeting anyway. Therefore, the AOAO prayed for declaratory 
relief in the form of an order finding that because Mitchell did 
not have the requisite percentage of owner signatures on his 
petition, there was no basis for conducting a special meeting. 
The AOAO also alleged that Mitchell was obtaining signatures via 
misrepresentation, so the AOAO also sought to enjoin this

    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
conduct. After Mitchell failed to answer the Complaint, the 
circuit court1 entered a default against him. 
The AOAO then filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (“MSJ”). 
Attached to the motion was a spreadsheet prepared by the AOAO’s 
property manager showing that, when the names of non-owners were 
removed from Mitchell’s petition, he had only 24.10 29% of the 
owners’ signatures on the petition. The AOAO also attached an 
updated spreadsheet showing that even fewer owners (23.7619%) were interested in holding a special meeting, as many owners had 
withdrawn their names from Mitchell’s petition. Therefore, the 
AOAO argued that no genuine issue of material fact existed regarding whether Mitchell had the requisite 25% of owners’ 
signatures on his petition, and the AOAO was entitled to 
judgment as a matter of law. The AOAO also reserved its right 
to file a motion seeking attorney’s fees and costs for having to 
file the MSJ. The circuit court granted the AOAO’s MSJ. 
Mitchell then submitted his Motion for Reconsideration of 
the circuit court’s order granting the AOAO’s MSJ. Mitchell 
asserted that he obtained 34.2969% of owners’ signatures on his 
petition, attaching his list of owners and their ownership percentages. Mitchell also stated he sought to mediate the 
dispute in September 2010, but the AOAO did not respond to his 
request and, instead, “plowed ahead with this litigation.”

 Mitchell filed an Opposition to the AOAO’s fees and c osts 
motion. Mitchell argued that the AOAO “should be estopped from 
seeking fees and costs, for they violated HRS  §  514B-161 by 
refusing to respond to Mitchell’s request to mediate the issues 
raised in this case.”   At the time this litigation commenced, 
HRS § 514B-161(a) provided  the following:  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Mitchell requested that the circuit court set aside its order 
granting the AOAO’s MSJ and stay the case to allow the parties 
to mediate the dispute. The circuit court denied the motion. 
The AOAO then filed a motion seeking $14,332.42 in fees and 
costs under HRS § 514B-157(a) and (b) (2006), which provide, in 
relevant part, the following (with emphases added): 
Attorneys ’ fees, delinquent assessments, and expenses of 
enforcement. (a) 
reasonable attorneys ’  fees, incurred by or on behalf of the 
association for : . . . . 
(3) Enforcing any provision of the declaration, 
bylaws, house rules, and this chapter , or the rules 
of the real estate commission; 
against an owner , occupant, tenant, employee of an owner, 
or any other person who may in any manner use the property, 
shall be promptly paid on demand to the association by such person
  or persons; provided that if the claims upon which 
the association takes any action are  not substantiated, all 
costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys ’  fees, 
incurred by any such person or persons as a result of the action of the association, shall be promptly paid on demand to such person or persons by the association.  
(b) . . . If any claim by an owner is not 
substantiated in any court action against an association, 
any of its officers or directors, or its board to enforce 
any provision of the declaration, bylaws, house rules, or this chapter, then all reasonable and necessa
ry expenses, 
costs, and attorneys ’ fees incurred by an association shall 
be awarded to the association, unless before filing the 
action in court the owner has first submitted the claim to 
mediation, or to arbitration under subpart D, and made a good faith effort to resolve the dispute under any of those 
procedures.

 Mitchell also objected to the following four time  entries 
as “hav[ing] absolutely no bearing on this case”:  
   
   
   
       
 
11/01/2010	  
       
 
11/18/2010	   
      
 
    
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
If a unit owner or the board of directors requests 
mediation of a dispute involving the interpretation or 
enforcement of the association’s declaration, bylaws or 
house rules, or a matter involving part VI, the other party in the dispute shall be required to participate i n 
mediation. 
Each party shall be wholly responsible for its 
own costs of participating in mediation, unless at the end of the mediation process, both parties agree that one party 
shall pay all or a specified portion of the mediation 
costs. 
If a unit owner or the board of directors refuses 
to participate in the mediation of a particular dispute, a 
court may take this refusal into consideration when 
awarding expenses, costs, and attorneys’ fees .  
 
(Emphasis added.)   According to  Mitchell, he requested mediation 
in early September 2010, which meant that “any prospect of his 
calling a special meeting on his own[] was off the table.”   To 
support his statement, he appended a communication from the Mediation Center of the Pacific, Inc., which had scheduled 
mediation for September 27, 2010.  He thus blamed the AOAO for 
deciding to litigate, and sought to have the AOAO bear its own 
fees and costs for its decision.

 At a hearing on the motion, the circuit court granted the 
AOAO’s motion for attorney’s fees and costs in the reduced 
amount of $10,730.92, after determining that a reasonable 
attorney billing rate was $150.00 per hour (versus the range of 
$185-250 requested by the AOAO), and after cutting hours billed 
for tasks that the circuit court did not consider to be  complex.   
The circuit court explained its reasoning as follows:  
 There were in e- mails a total of 5.2 hours of 
examining e -mails, which if billed at the top rate would be 
for $1,300. The e -mails would seem to be for the most part 
unnecessary, particularly in light of the fact that there  
were significant billings, in fact, 7.3 hours for the time 
spent with John Morris. And I know that he has some input 
because he advises the board on their procedural matters 
and so some contact with Mr. Morris would be appropriate, but I would ask that you adjust the bill by taking into 
account that the total number of hours for the bill would be –- that would be allowable would be 5 hours for the 
preparation of the TRO paperwork; that the bill would not 
include the time spent on the e -mails; and that the  total 
amount of time that would be allowable for Mr. Morris in 
consultation with him would be 3 hours.

in the mediation of a particular dispute] into consideration 
when awarding fees and costs, ” but does not preclude an award of 
fees altogether. 
THE COURT: Mr. Perez -Mesa, I looked at the –- I looked at 
the bill and there’s several things that I noted from it. 
The temporary restraining order if I look at the cost bill 
is said to have undergone several revisions and to have 
taken 11.1 hours to prepare. That amount of time seems 
excessive in light of the fact that the particular type of 
work that’s involved is fairly mainstream and not a very 
exotic form, so I would allow 5 hours of billing to prepare 
the document.  
The 
–-because I take a look at the complexity, the 
relative complexity of the work and I don’t doubt that on 
certain types of work that the things that are perhaps at the cutting edge of litigation, but the top bil ling rate 
for both you and Mr. Revere would be somewhat higher.  I think the amounts that I would allow, which is $150 per 
hour, is appropriate to the type of work that is involved 
here. So would you please adjust the bill.  When it is

THE COURT: 
 
 
 
The circuit court did not address the four time entries Mitchell 
challenged. The circuit court also did not address Mitchell’s 
argument that the AOAO should be estopped  pursuant to HRS       
§ 514B-161 from seeking fees and costs for refusing to respond to his request to mediate the issues in the case. The circuit 
court entered Final Judgment, and Mitchell timely appealed.    
  
 On appeal, Mitchell again argued that the AOAO’s refusal to 
mediate the dispute precluded it from an entitlement of any fees 
and costs under HRS § 514B-161(a).   Mitchell again challenged 
the four time entries. The AOAO did not address Mitchell’s argument that its refusal to mediate precluded an award of fees 
and costs under HRS § 514B-161, nor did it address the four time  
entries.

incidental expenses are okay. 
MR. PEREZ -MESA:  Your Honor, if we can summarize just so 
I’m clear, so 5 hours i s okay for the TRO, the meeting with 
John Morris —-
Three hours for live meeting with John Morris 
at that billing rate. Please remove the e -mails.  I just 
think those are probably –-I recognize there’s a certain 
amount of getting up to speed on it. I wouldn’t bill him 
for the learning curve if you follow what I’m getting at. 
B. The ICA Appeal 
While Mitchell’s appeal was pending before the ICA, he sold 
his Discovery Bay condominium unit
. Although the issue of 
whether Mitchell obtained the requisite twenty-five percent of owners’ signature for the special meeting thus became moot, the

 Mitchell   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
ICA went on to determine the question of attorneys’ fees and 
costs, which is “ancillary to the underlying action and survives 
independently under the Co urt’s equitable jurisdiction.” Ass’n 
of Apartment Owners of Discovery Bay v. Mitchell , CAAP-11-
0000151 (App. Feb. 24, 2014) (SDO) at 2-3 (citing Queen Emma 
Found. v. Tatibouet , 123 Hawai ʻi 500, 508, 510, 236 P.3d 1236, 
1244, 1246 (App. 2010)).  The ICA then determined that the AOAO 
was the prevailing party in the underlying action, “without 
regard to whether [the ICA thought] the trial court’s decision 
on the underlying merits [was] correct,” because the AOAO had 
been granted its MSJ. , SDO at 4 (citing Tatibouet, 123 
Hawaiʻi at 510, 236 P.3d at 1246). 
As to Mitchell’s contention that the AOAO’s refusal to 
mediate should 
have precluded it from an award of attorney’s 
fees and costs under HRS § 514B-161(a), the ICA stated that “such refusal may be taken into consideration in the award of 
attorneys fees and costs, but [the statute] does not mandate 
that it be considered.” , 
SDO at 7.   As to Mitchell’s 
challenge to the four time entries, the ICA concluded, “It is 
clear from the discussion the Circuit Court had with counsel 
that the Circuit Court carefully examined the invoices before 
adjusting the fee award.”   SDO at 6.   Therefore, the 
ICA affirmed the circ uit court’s j udgment.  , SDO at 7. 
8

         
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
It subsequently denied Mitchell’s Motion for Reconsideration, 
which once again challenged the four time entries. 
III. Standard of Review 
“The trial court’s grant or denial of attorney’s fees and 
costs is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.” 
Sierra Club v. Dep’t of Transp. , 120 Hawai
ʻi 181, 197, 202 P.3d 
1226, 1242 (2009) (citations and brackets omitted). “The trial 
court abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling on an 
erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment 
of the evidence. In other words, an abuse of discretion occurs 
where the trial court has clearly exceeded the bounds of reason 
or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.” 
Maui Tomorrow v. 
Bd. of Land & Na
tural Res., 110 Hawai ʻi 234, 242, 131 P.3d 517, 
525 (2006) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets 
omitted). 
IV. Discussion On certiorari , 
Mitchell challenges the ICA’s affirmance of 
the fees and costs award as a matter of law, arguing that the 
AOAO’s refusal to participate in mediation precluded it from 
receiving an award of fees and costs under HRS § 514B-161(a). 
HRS § 514B-161(a) contemplates a party’s refusal to participate 
in mediation, and such refusal may impact a fees and costs award, but it does not preclude the same: “If a party refuses 
9
         
 
 
                      
   
 
 
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to participate in the mediation of a particular dispute, a court 
may take this refusal into consideration when awarding expenses, 
costs, and attorneys’ fees.” While HRS § 514B -161(a) allows a 
court the discretion to take a party’s refusal to mediate into consideration in awarding fees and costs, we cannot assume that 
the circuit court in this case exercised such discretion simply 
by virtue of having reduced the AOAO’s fee award, because the 
hearing transcript is silent on the matter. Mitchell expressly 
raised the applicability of the statute (albeit as a basis for 
precluding a fee award altogether ). Given the legislature’s 
2 intent to encourage mediation of condominium disputes,  the 
circuit court should have addressed whether HRS § 514B-161(a) 
applied. In doing so on remand, the circuit court should 
determine whether the AOAO refused to participate in mediation, 
and if so, the circuit court should consider, on the record, 
2 From our review of the record on appeal, we assume (but do not 
decide) that Chapter 514B applies in this case.  In 2004, the legislature 
enacted Chapter 514B as a recodification of the Condominium Property Regime 
chapter (HRS Chapter 514A). 2004 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 164, at 755. The 2004 
legislature referred to the Hawai i Real Estate C ommission’s December 31, 2003 
Final Report to the Legislature as an “aid in understanding and interpreting” 
the Act that became Chapter 514B. 2004 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 164, at 755. 
That report, in turn, stressed the need for improved alternative dispute 
resolution in condominium communities, because “the ‘mandatory’ mediation provisions [of Chapter 514A] are essentially voluntary (with boards refusing 
to mediate or going through the motions to avoid the appearance of non -
cooperation). . . .” Hawaii Real Estate Commission, “Final Report to the Legislature, Recodification of Chapter 514A, Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(Condominium Property Regimes), in Response to Act 213, Section 4 (SLH 2000),” at 34. In the instant case, Mitchell contends that the AOAO refused 
to mediate. In passing HRS § 514B -161(a), the legislature encouraged the 
courts to take into consideration a refusal to participate in the mediation 
of a dispute when awarding attorneys’ fees and costs.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
such refusal in determining whether to award attorneys’ fees and 
costs. 
On certiorari, Mitchell also continues to challenge the 
four time entries as belonging to a different matter. 
From what 
we are able to glean from the record on appeal, it is unclear 
how the four time entries are connected to the instant 
litigation. Although Mitchell objected to the time entries 
before the circuit court, the AOAO’s counsel never explained the 
four time entries in its reply in support of its motion for fees 
and costs, or at the hearing on that motion.  The circuit court, 
for its part, did not inquire about the four time entries at the 
hearing on the motion for fees and costs. The ICA, for its 
part, assumed that the circuit court “carefully examined” the 
fee request, although the record seems to show otherwise, with 
respect to these four time entries.  Mitchell,  SDO at 7. It 
would appear that no court has yet to scrutinize the propriety of these four time entries. We therefore remand this case to the circuit court to determine whether these four time entries 
were correctly included in the Mitchell matter. 
V. Conclusion 
We therefore vacate the ICA’s judgment on appeal and remand 
this case to the circuit court
.  On remand, the circuit court 
shall determine whether HRS § 514B-161(a) applies in this case.  
If it does, the circuit court should determine whether the AOAO

refused to participate in mediation, and if so, the circuit 
court should consider, on the record, such refusal in 
determining whether to award attorneys’ fees and cos ts. On 
remand, the circuit court shall also determine whether four time entries were correctly billed to the instant matter.
