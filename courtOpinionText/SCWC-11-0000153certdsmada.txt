IN THE INTEREST OF M. CHILDREN: BM
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(ICA NO. CAAP-11-0000153; FC-S NO. 08-11988)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, J., Circuit Judge Del Rosario,
in place of McKenna, J., recused, and Circuit Judge Kim, assigned
by reason of vacancy, with Acoba, J., dissenting separately)
 
Petitioner/Appellant Mother’s application for writ of
 
certiorari, filed on May 8, 2012, was filed more than thirty days
 
after the filing of the ICA’s February 9, 2012 judgment on
 appeal. The application is untimely and thus, this court lacks
 appellate jurisdiction. See HRS § 602-59(c) (Supp. 2011); HRAP
 
Rule 40.1(a). Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for writ of
 
certiorari is dismissed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, June 21, 2012.
