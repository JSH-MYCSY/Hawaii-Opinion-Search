Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Roger A. Pai
 
(Petitioner) seeks review of the January 9, 2013 judgment of the
 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) filed pursuant to its
 November 26, 2012 Summary Disposition Order, affirming the
 Judgment entered on March 21, 2011 by the District Court of the

court of Excessive Speeding in violation of the Hawai' i Revised 
2
Statutes (HRS) § 291C-105(a)(2) (Supp. 2010)  and No Motor Vehicle
Insurance in violation of HRS § 431:10C-104 (2005).3 On appeal to
 
the ICA, Petitioner contended that the Respondent/Plaintiff-
Appellee the State of Hawai' i (the State) did not establish, 
first, “that the laser gun was tested according to manufacturer
 recommended procedures and determined to be operating properly
 prior to its use,” and second that “‘the nature and extent of the
 citing officer’s training in the operation of the laser gun meets

 Pursuant to HRS § 291C-105(a), “no person shall drive a motor
 
vehicle at a speed exceeding” either (1) “[t]he applicable state or county
speed limit by thirty miles per hour or more,” or (2) “[e]ighty miles per hour
or more irrespective of the applicable state or county speed limit.”
Individuals found to have violated HRS § 291C-105(a) are guilty of a petty
misdemeanor and subject to a fine between $500 and $1,000, a thirty-day
suspension of license, a surcharge of up to $125, an assessment for driver
education, and either thirty-six hours of community service work or between
forty-eight hours and five days of imprisonment. HRS § 291C-105(c).
Individuals found guilty are also required to attend a course of instruction
in driver retraining. Id.

 HRS § § 431:10C-104 provides in relevant part as follows:
 
§ 431:10C-104 Conditions of operation and registration of motor
 
vehicles.
 
(a) Except as provided in section 431:10C-105, no person
shall operate or use a motor vehicle upon any public street,
road, or highway of this State at any time unless such motor
vehicle is insured at all times under a motor vehicle
 insurance policy.
 
(b) Every owner of a motor vehicle used or operated at any
time upon any public street, road, or highway of this State
shall obtain a motor vehicle insurance policy upon such
vehicle which provides the coverage required by this article
and shall maintain the motor vehicle insurance policy at all
times for the entire motor vehicle registration period.

the requirements indicated by the manufacturer.’” (Quoting State
 
v. Assaye, 121 Hawai' i 124, 213-15, 216 P.3d 1227, 1236-38 
(2009).) Petitioner also maintained that the State did not demonstrate “that the laser gun had been inspected and serviced in a manner directed by the manufacturer.” 
On November 26, 2012, the ICA issued its SDO affirming
 
the court's Judgment, only addressing (1) whether the laser gun
 was tested or determined to be working properly in accordance
 with the manufacturer’s recommended procedures, (2) whether the
 Officer’s training met the manufacturer’s requirements, and (3)
 whether the laser gun was inspected and serviced by the
 manufacturer. 
In his Application, Petitioner contends that “the ICA’s 
order affirming [her] conviction constitutes an obvious inconsistency with . . . State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 276 
4
P.3d 617 (2012)[,]”  and “the ICA gravely erred in holding that
the State laid sufficient foundation for the admission of the

 The Amended Complaint read as follows:
 
That on or about the 1st day of December, 2010, in the Division of
Wailuku, County of Maui, State of Hawai 'i, [Petitioner] did drive
a motor vehicle at a speed exceeding eighty miles per hourirrespective of the applicable state or county speed limit to wit,did drive a motor vehicle at 82 miles per hour, thereby committingthe offense of Excessive Speeding, in violation of Section 291C­105(a)(1) and/or 291C-105(a)(2) and 291C-105(c)(1) of the Hawaii
Revised Statutes.

laser gun reading.”5 Petitioner challenges the sufficiency of the
 
charge in the Amended Complaint for the first time in his
 
Application. The Amended Complaint in this case did not allege
 the state of mind that the State was required to prove for the
 charge of excessive speeding against Petitioner. Because HRS §§
 291C-105(a)(1), 291C-105(a)(2), and 291C-105(c)(1) do not specify
 the requisite state of mind, HRS § 702-204 applies, which
 provides: “When the state of mind required to establish an
 element of an offense is not specified by the law, that element
 is established if, with respect thereto, a person acts
 intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.” 
In State v. Maharaj, No. SCWC-29520, 2013 WL 6068086, 
at *5 (Haw. Nov. 18, 2013), we reaffirmed the “core principle” set out in State v. Apollonio, 130 Hawai' i 353, 311 P.3d 676 
(2013), that a charge that fails to allege the requisite state of mind must be “‘dismissed without prejudice because it violates due process.’”

P.3d at 682). We also held that the requisite state of must be

 In his Application, Petitioner does not challenge his conviction
 
for the offense of No Motor Vehicle Insurance.

 In the instant case, Petitioner challenged the sufficiency of the 
Amended Complaint for the first time in his Application to the Court.
However, in Apollonio , where the defendant also challenged the sufficiency of
the charge for the first time in his Application, this court held that the“core principle” that a charge that fails to state the requisite state of mindmust be dismissed without prejudice applied. 130 Hawai 'i at 369 n.10, 311 
P.3d at 682 n.10.

alleged as an “essential fact” under Hawai' i Rules of Penal 
Procedure Rule 7(d). Thus, inasmuch as the Amended Complaint 
against Petitioner failed to allege the requisite state of mind that also was an essential fact of the offense of excessive speeding, the Amended Complaint must be dismissed without prejudice. Id. at *5. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the January 9, 2013 judgment
 
of the ICA and the March 21, 2011 Judgment of the court are
 vacated, and this case is remanded to the court with instructions
 to dismiss the Excessive Speeding charge without prejudice.
