CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

(CAAP-11-0000427; CASE NO. 2DTC-10-006049)

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

(By: Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ; with Recktenwald, C.J.,
dissenting, with whom Nakayama, J., joins)
 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Wendy Pierce

(Petitioner) seeks review of the August 24, 2012 judgment of the

Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) filed pursuant to its August

10, 2012 Summary Disposition Order (SDO), affirming the Entry of

Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment (Judgment), filed on

April 27, 2011 in the District Court of the Second Circuit,

Wailuku Division (the court)1. Petitioner was convicted by the 
court of the offense of excessive speeding in violation of Hawai' i 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291C-105 (2007 and Supp. 2010).2 On 
appeal to the ICA, Petitioner contended that [the Respondent] did 
not establish “‘(1) that the [True Speed] was tested according to the manufacturer’s recommended procedures and found to be working properly, and (2) that the nature and extent of [the Officer’s] training in the use of the [True Speed] met the requirements indicated by the manufacturer.’” (Citing State v. Assaye, 121 Hawai'i 124, 213-15, 216 P.3d 1227, 1236-38 (2009).) 
On August 10, 2012, the ICA issued its SDO affirming

the court’s Judgment, only addressing (1) whether the True Speed

was tested or determined to be working properly in accordance

with the manufacturer’s recommended procedures, and (2) whether

the Officer’s training met the manufacturer’s requirements.

Pursuant to HRS § 291C-105(a), “no person shall drive a motor
 
vehicle at a speed exceeding” either (1) “[t]he applicable state or county
speed limit by thirty miles per hour or more,” or (2) “[e]ighty miles per hour
or more irrespective of the applicable state or county speed limit.”
Individuals found to have violated HRS § 291C-105(a) are guilty of a petty
misdemeanor and subject to a fine between $500 and $1,000, a thirty-day
suspension of license, a surcharge of up to $125, an assessment for driver
education, and either thirty-six hours of community service work or between
forty-eight hours and five days of imprisonment. HRS § 291C-105(c).
Individuals found guilty are also required to attend a course of instruction
in driver retraining. Id.

     ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In her Application, Petitioner contends that “the ICA’s 
order affirming [her] conviction constitutes an obvious 
inconsistency with . . . State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 276 
3
P.3d 617 (2012)[,]”  and “the ICA gravely erred in holding that
 
the State laid sufficient foundation for the admission of the

laser gun reading.” 
Petitioner challenges the sufficiency of the
 
charge in the Amended Complaint for the first time in her

Application. The Amended Complaint in this case did not allege
 
the state of mind that the State was required to prove for the

charge of excessive speeding against Petitioner. Because HRS §§
 
291C-105(a)(1), 291C-105(a)(2), and 291C-105(c)(1) do not specify

the requisite state of mind, HRS § 702-204 applies, which

provides: “When the state of mind required to establish an

element of an offense is not specified by the law, that element

is established if, with respect thereto, a person acts

intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.”

The Amended Complaint read as follows:
 
That  on  or  about  the  20 th  day  of  October,  2012,  in  the  Division  of 
Wailuku,  County  of  Maui,  State  of  Hawai'i,[Petitioner]  did  drive  a
motor  vehicle  at  a  speed  exceeding  the  applicable  state  or  county
speed  limit  by  thirty  miles  per  hour  or  more,  to  wit,  did  drive  a
motor  vehicle  at  77  miles  per  hour  in  a  45  miles  per  hour  zone,
thereby  committing  the  offense  of  Excessive  Speeding,  in  violation
of  Section  291C-105(a)(1)  and/or  291C-105(a)(2)  and  291C-105(c)(1)
of  the  Hawaii  Revised  Statutes.

raised for the first time on appeal, we reaffirmed the “core 
principle” set out in State v. Apollonio, 130 Hawai' i 353, 311 
P.3d 676 (2013), that “‘[a] charge that fails to charge a requisite state of mind cannot be construed reasonabl[y] to state an offense and thus the charge is dismissed without prejudice because it violates due process.’”
4 Id. (quoting Apollonio, 130 
Hawai'i at 359, 311 P.3d at 682). We also held that “as a fact 
that must be alleged in a charge, a requisite state of mind is clearly an essential fact that must be alleged under [Hawai' i 
Rules of Penal Procedure] Rule 7(d).” Id. at *5 (internal 
quotation marks omitted). Thus, inasmuch as the Amended Complaint against Petitioner failed to allege the requisite state of mind that also was an essential fact of the offense of excessive speeding, the Amended Complaint must be dismissed without prejudice. Id. at *5. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the August 24, 2012 judgment

of the ICA and the April 27, 2011 Judgment of the court are

In Apollonio , the defendant first contested the sufficiency of the 
charge in his Application to this court. 130 Hawai 'i at 357 n.5, 311 P.3d at 
680 n.5. Similarly, in the instant case, the sufficiency of the charge was
first raised by Petitioner in her Application. Moreover, as in Apollonio , see
id., here Petitioner’s Notice of No Reply Brief in the ICA was filed on
Feburary 14, 2012, prior to this court’s decision in Nesmith , filed on April
12, 2012. Therefore, as this court explained in Apollonio , Petitioner could
not have raised the argument that her conviction was contrary to Nesmith
before the ICA. Id.

to dismiss the Complaint without prejudice.
