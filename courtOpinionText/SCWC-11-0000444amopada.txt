(collectively Petitioners), mortgagors under the mortgage herein,
 
are precluded from raising the standing of Respondent/Plaintiff-
Appellee Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS, or
 Respondent) to bring the foreclosure action herein inasmuch as
 (1) a standing objection is not “unique” to a confirmation of
 sale proceeding, see Security Pacific Mortg. Corp. v. Miller, 71
 Haw. 65, 70, 783 P.2d 855, 858 (1989), from which Petitioners
 appeal, and (2) Petitioners’ failure to appeal the foreclosure
 judgment barred challenges to Respondent’s standing under the
 doctrine of res judicata. In consonance with these holdings, the
 April 29, 2011 judgment of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
1
(the court) , and the January 2, 2013 judgment of the
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) are affirmed, but for the
 reasons set forth herein.
 
I.
 
On September 8, 2006, Petitioners executed a promissory 
note (Note) secured on a mortgage (Mortgage) on their residence located in Ewa Beach, Hawai' i, in the amount of $416,250.00 from 
Flexpoint Funding Corporation (Flexpoint) a California corporation. The Mortgage stated that it “secured to [Flexpoint],” inter alia, “the repayment of the loan.”

 The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided.

Respondent was listed in the mortgage as “mortgagee”  and
“nominee.”3 The Mortgage provided that “[Respondent] holds only
 
legal title to the interests granted by [Petitioners] in this
 Mortgage; but, if necessary to comply with law or custom,
 [Respondent], (as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and
 assigns), has the right: to exercise any and all of those
 interests, including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose
 and sell the Property.” 
On May 6, 2009, Respondent, as Plaintiff and acting
 
“solely as nominee,” filed a Complaint against Petitioners,
 alleging that Petitioners had failed to make payments pursuant to
 the terms of the Note and that Respondent sought foreclosure of
 the mortgage, sale of the property, and a deficiency judgment if
 the proceeds of the sale did not satisfy Petitioners’ debt. 
Copies of the Note and Mortgage were attached to the Complaint. 
On July 8, 2009, Respondent filed a Motion for Summary
 
Judgment as Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree
 of Foreclosure. Respondent attached a Declaration of Barbara

 A “mortgagee” is defined as “[o]ne to whom property is mortgaged;
 
the mortgage creditor, or lender.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1104 (9th ed.
 
2009). Because Flexpoint was the “creditor or lender,” it does not appear
 
that Respondent was the “mortgagee.” See Mortgage Electronic Registration
Systems, Inc. v. Saunders , 2 A. 3d 289, 295-96 (Me. 2010).
 
3
 “Nominee” is defined as “[a] person designed to act in place of
 
another, usu[ally] in a very limited way,” or “[a] party who holds bare legal
title for the benefit of others or who receives and distributes funds for he
 benefit of others.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1076 (8th ed. 2004).

Huidmer, an “officer, collection officer, or employee,” of JP
 
Morgan Chase Bank National Association (Chase), a “servicing
 agent” for Respondent. The Declaration stated that Chase was in
 possession of the Note and that Petitioners had failed to make
 payments “as required” under the Note. The Note, Mortgage, and
 records establishing that Petitioners had failed to make timely
 payments were attached as exhibits to the motion. 
On July 13, 2009, Respondent secured a clerk’s entry of
 
default against Petitioners for failing to respond to the
 Complaint.
 
On July 27, 2009, Wise, proceeding pro se, filed
 
Petitioners’ Answer to Respondent’s Motion for Summary Judgment
 as Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree of
 
4
Foreclosure (“Answer”),  stating,  inter alia, that Respondent
lacked standing to file the Complaint.
 
On August 5, 2009, a hearing was held on Respondent’s
 
Motion for Summary Judgment. 
Wise was apparently present at the
 
hearing. A transcript of the hearing is not a part of the
 record.
 
On May 12, 2010, the court granted Respondent’s Motion
 
for Summary Judgment and filed Findings of Fact, Conclusions of
 
4
 Wise titled the “Answer” as an “Answer to Plaintiff’s Motion for
 
Summary Judgment.” However, the substance of the Answer, which appears to
deny allegations stated in the complaint, appears to be an Answer to the
complaint. In its reply before this court, Petitioners characterized this
document as an “answer to the Complaint.”

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Law (conclusions), and an Order Granting Motion for Summary
 
Judgment as Against All Defendants and for Interlocutory Decree
 of Foreclosure. The court’s conclusions provided, inter alia,
 that “[Respondent] is entitled to have its first mortgage
 foreclosed upon the Mortgaged Property and to have the property
 sold in a manner subscribed by law.” The Order stated that the
 mortgage “shall be and is hereby foreclosed as prayed, and the
 Mortgaged Property shall be sold at public auction . . . . The
 sale shall not be final until approved and confirmed by the
 court.” A foreclosure judgment was also entered on May 12 and
 incorporated the court’s order.
 
The ultimate time to appeal the foreclosure judgment 
expired on July 12, 2010, assuming Petitioners would have sought an extension of time to appeal. See Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure Rule 4 (stating that a notice of appeal “shall be filed within 30 days of the judgment” and that an extension may be obtained but that “no such extension shall exceed 30 days past the prescribed time”). Petitioners did not appeal. 
On September 23, 2010, the commissioner issued his
 
report stating that Petitioners’ property was sold to Respondent
 for $329,986.80. On the same day, Respondent filed a Motion for
 Confirmation of Sale, for Writ of Possession and for Disposal of
 Personal Property (Motion for Confirmation). The Motion for
 Confirmation was heard on October 14, 2010. At the hearing,
 
5
         
         
           
      
           
          
         
          
           
           
         
         
        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Petitioners apparently “objected to confirmation on the grounds
 
that Respondent was acting as a nominee for an undisclosed
 principal and had no standing to foreclose in the first place.” 
The hearing on the Motion for Confirmation was continued to March
 10, 2011. 
On February 8, 2011, Respondent filed an Amended Notice 
of Hearing of its Motion for Confirmation (Amended Motion). Respondent attached to the Amended Motion a Declaration (Mikell Declaration) from a Lora A. Mikell, “Senior Lead Operations Specialist,” who was also with Chase. The Mikell Declaration stated that Chase “as holder of the [N]ote and [M]ortgage securing the [N]ote, confirms the actions taken to date,” and “specifically authorized [Respondent] . . . to bring and to continue proceeding in this foreclosure action and any related legal action in connection with the [N]ote and the [M]ortgage.” The court interpreted this statement as “ratification” under Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 17.
5 Neither party 
5 HRCP  Rule  17(a)  provide  in  relevant  part  as  follows:
 
(
a) Real party in interest. Every action shall be
prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest . An
 
executor, administrator, guardian, bailee, trustee of an
express trust, a party with whom or in whose name a contract
has been made for the benefit of another, or a party
authorized by statute may sue in its own name without
joining with it the party for whose benefit the action is
brought. No action shall be dismissed on the ground that it
is not prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest
until a reasonable time has been allowed after objection for
ratification of commencement of the action by, or joinder or
substitution of, the real party in interest; and such

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
has challenged this interpretation. 
Copies of the Note and Mortgage were attached to the
 
Declaration. Appended to a copy of the Note was an endorsement
 
transferring the Mortgage from Flexpoint to Washington Mutual
 
6
” and an endorsement in
 Bank, which was entitled an “allonge, 
7
blank signed by a Robin B. Tango, a Vice President at Washington
Mutual Bank. 
The Declaration explained that the Note and a copy
 
of the Mortgage had been “kept by Chase in the ordinary course of
 business under [the declarant’s] custody and control” and that
 the Note contained endorsements. 
Petitioners’ counsel filed an Opposition to
 
Respondent’s Amended Motion on March 3, 2011, challenging
 Respondent’s standing to foreclose and Chase’s ability to
 retroactively ratify Respondent’s standing pursuant to HRCP Rule
 
5(...continued)
r
atification, joinder, or substitution shall have the same
effect as if the action had been commenced in the name of
 
the real party in interest.

6 An  “allonge”  is  defined  as  “[a]  slip  of  paper  sometimes  attached
 
to  a  negotiable  instrument  for  the  purpose  of  receiving  further  indorsements
when  the  original  paper  is  filled  with  indorsements.”   Black’s  Law  Dictionary
 
88  (9th  ed.  2009).

 Hawai'i Revised Statutes (H.R.S.) § 490:3-205(b) provides as 
follows: 
(b) If an indorsement is made by the holder of an instrument
and it is not a special indorsement, it is a “blank
 indorsement.” When indorsed in blank, an instrument becomes
payable to the bearer and may be negotiated by transfer of
possession alone until specially indorsed .

17. Petitioners also asserted that Chase could not establish
 
that “the underlying promissory note was assigned from
 
[Flexpoint] by allonge to [Washington Mutual] and then assigned
 in blank by [Washington Mutual]” because, inter alia, the Mikell
 Declaration “fails to provide any foundation for his assertions
 as to the actions and the record keeping of either MERS or
 Washington Mutual Bank, which he purports nevertheless to testify
 about.” 
On March 7, 2011, Respondent filed a reply memorandum,
 
arguing that Respondent had standing to foreclose, that Chase’s
 ratification cured any standing defect, and that the endorsement
 in blank attached to the Note rendered Chase the holder of the
 Note and Mortgage. 
On March 10, 2011, Petitioners filed a Motion to Set
 
Aside Clerk’s Entry of Defaults pursuant to HRCP Rule 55(c).
8 In
 
a Declaration of Counsel attached to the motion to set aside
 defaults, Petitioners’ counsel stated that “the summary judgment
 in this case was clearly procured by false representations to
 [the] court under oath, as a result of which [Respondent] lacks
 standing to proceed in this case, and [the] court consequently
 
8
 HRCP Rule 55(c) provides as follows:
 
(c) Setting Aside Default. For good cause shown the court
may set aside an entry of default and, if a judgment by
default has been entered, may likewise set it aside in
accordance with Rule 60(b).

   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
lacks jurisdiction to confirm the sale.” The declaration of
 
counsel incorporated by reference the March 3, 2011 opposition
 memorandum, which was attached as an exhibit.
 
On April 29, 2011, the court made the following
 
findings in its Order Confirming Sale.
9
 
1.	 Although the Court acknowledges [Petitioners’] arguments regarding
[Respondent’s] lack of standing, Haw. R. Civ. P. 17(a) allows for
ratification of commencement of the action by the real party in
interest. The real party in interest, JP Morgan Chase Bank,
National Association (“Chase”), has confirmed the actions taken to
date and has authorized [Respondent] to bring and to continue
proceeding in this foreclosure action. Therefore, Chase’s
ratification has effectively corrected any issue regarding
[Respondent’s] lack of standing and Chase has agreed to be bound
for the decision of this Court, which eliminates any risk of
multiple liability .
 
2.	 In addition, Chase is the holder of the note, with both the
endorsement from Flexpoint Funding Corporation in favor ofWashington Mutual Bank, and the blank endorsement signed byWashington Mutual Bank. In accordance with Hawai 'i Revised 
Statutes Section 490:3-205(b), when an instrument is indorsed inblank, it becomes payable to bearer and may be negotiated bytransfer of possession alone until specially indorsed . 
(Emphases added). On April 29, 2011, the court entered judgment
 
confirming the sale of Petitioners’ residence. On May 10, 2011,
 the court issued an Order Denying Petitioners’ motion to set
 aside defaults. The property was sold on May 12, 2011. 
II.
 
On May 31, 2011, Petitioners appealed to the ICA. 
Petitioners’ notice of appeal stated that they were appealing
 from the April 29, 2011 Order Confirming Sale, the April 29, 2011
 
9
 The full title of the order confirming sale is “Order Approving
 
Report of Commissioner, Confirming Commissioner’s Sale of Property at Public
Sale, Directing Distribution of Proceeds, for Writ of Possession and for
Disposal of Personal Property.”
 
9
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Judgment, and the April 29, 2011 writ of possession. Petitioners
 
argued (1) that “Respondent’s lack of standing was irrevocable,”
 because Respondent did not have ownership of the underlying
 promissory note, (2) that “[HRCP] Rule 17(a) is not available to
 a plaintiff [i.e., Respondent] unless that plaintiff had standing
 to invoke the jurisdiction of the court in the first place,” (3)
 “[HRCP] Rule 17(a)’s ‘ratification provision’ . . . cannot be
 taken advantage of by a purported real party in interest when
 there is no showing of ‘honest and understandable mistake,’” and
 (4) the court “committed reversible error” in “finding that Chase
 was the holder of the Note and therefore the real party in
 interest.” 
The ICA affirmed the court’s denial of the motion to
 
set aside the entry of default judgment. As to Petitioners’
 first three arguments, the ICA noted that “the [] court
 acknowledged [Petitioners’] contention that Respondent lacked
 standing, but found that Chase addressed those concerns by
 ratification of the proceedings.” Mortgage Electronic
 
Registration Systems, Inc. v. Wise, No. CAAP-11-0000444, 2012 WL
 5971062 at *1 (App. Nov. 29, 2012) (SDO). The ICA held that “the
 [] court properly allowed the ratification where such
 ratification was formal and did not prejudice the defendants.” 
Id. 
10
         
        
            
           
              
           
         
           
            
           
             
          
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
As to the fourth argument, the ICA stated that 
“Respondent submitted a copy of the Note as Exhibit A attached to 
their [sic] motion to confirm the sale,” and “[t]he Sr. Lead Operations Specialist for Chase declared the Note to be a true and accurate copy of the Note in Chase’s possession, satisfying Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 490:3-205(b) . . . .” Id. The 
ICA concluded that “the [] court did not err in finding Chase to be the holder of the note where Chase bore the Note endorsed by [Flexpoint] to Washington Mutual Bank and the blank endorsement by Washington Mutual Bank establishes Chase as the holder of the Note.” Id. 
III.
 
In their Application, Petitioners ask if the ICA erred
 
by holding that Chase could ratify Respondent’s standing,
10
 
because Chase could not demonstrate that it was the holder of the
 Mortgage and Note at the commencement of the suit and therefore
 could not establish that it was the real party in interest HRCP
 Rule 17(a). Petitioners contend (1) that “[HRCP] Rule 17(a) []
 
10 In this jurisdiction, “[t]he crucial inquiry with regard to 
standing is whether the plaintiff has alleged such a personal stake in the
controversy as to warrant his or her invocation of the court’s jurisdiction
and to justify exercise of the court’s remedial powers on his or her behalf .” 
Kaho'ohanohano v. State , 114 Hawai 'i 302, 318, 162 P.3d 696, 712 (2007)
(internal quotation marks removed) (emphasis in original). “[I]n deciding
whether the plaintiff has a requisite interest in the outcome of thelitigation, we employ a three part test: (1) has the plaintiff suffered anactual or threatened injury as a result of the defendant’s wrongful conduct;(2) is the injury fairly traceable to the defendant’s actions; and (3) would a
favorable decision likely provide relief for [the] plaintiff’s injury.” Id.
 
(internal quotation marks removed).
 
11
         
 
        
           
         
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
is not available to ratify commencement of an action unless the
 
ratifying party [i.e., Chase] had standing to invoke the
 jurisdiction of the court in the first place at the time the
 complaint was filed,” and (2) “there is no evidence in the record
 to prove that Chase had suffered any injury at the time
 Respondent commenced this foreclosure action.” 
IV.
 
In its Response, Respondent raises several arguments
 
suggesting that Petitioners are procedurally barred from
 challenging Respondent’s standing or Chase’s ratification of
 Respondent’s standing. Respondent maintains, inter alia, (1)
 that the challenges made by Petitioners to Respondent’s standing
 are inappropriate in an appeal from the Order Confirming Sale,
 and (2) that the challenges by Petitioners to Respondent’s
 standing are barred by res judicata. In their Reply, Petitioners
 maintain that they are not barred from challenging Respondent’s
 standing because “[a] plaintiff’s lack of standing may be
 disputed at any stage of a proceeding, even on appeal.”
11
 
V. 
A.
 
Respondent’s arguments are dispositive. As to
 
11
 Supplemental briefing was ordered on the issues of whether 
ratification pursuant to HRCP Rule 17(a) cures a defect in standing and
whether the Mortgage and Note were self-authenticating pursuant to Hawai 'i 
Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 902(9). 
12
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Respondent’s first contention, this court has explained that a 
judgment of foreclosure “finally determines the merits of the controversy.” MDG Supply, Inc. v. Diversified Investments, Inc., 
51 Haw. 375, 380, 463 P.2d 525, 528 (1969) (internal citations omitted). Subsequent proceedings “are simply incidents to its enforcement.” Id. (internal citations omitted.) Thus, 
“foreclosure cases are bifurcated into two separately appealable parts: (1) the decree of foreclosure and the order of sale, if the order of sale is incorporated within the decree, and (2) all other orders.” Miller, 71 Haw. at 70, 783 P.2d at 858. It is 
evident that orders confirming sale are separately appealable from the decree of foreclosure, and therefore fall within the second part of the bifurcated proceedings. See id. (treating an 
appeal from an order confirming sale and for deficiency judgment as separate from an appeal from the foreclosure judgment); see also Eastern Savings Bank, FSB v. Esteban, 129 Hawai' i 154, 296 
P.3d 1062 (2013) (treating an appeal from the judgment confirming the foreclosure sale as a separate matter from the judgment of foreclosure). 
In Miller, the defendant did not appeal from the
 
court’s order granting summary judgment and a decree of
 foreclosure, but did appeal from an Order Confirming
 Commissioner’s Sale of Property at Public Sale, Directing 
13
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Distribution of Proceeds, and for Deficiency Judgment. 71 Haw.
 
at 67, 783 P.2d at 856. The defendants apparently challenged the
 plaintiff’s right to seek a deficiency judgment. Id. at 70, 783
 
P.2d at 858. 
This court held that the defendants “timely appeal from
 
the Deficiency Judgments would entitle it to challenge errors
 unique to it, such as an erroneous upset price or miscalculation
 of deficiency.” Id. at 71, 783 P.2d at 858 (emphasis added)
 
(internal quotation marks removed); see also Independence Mortg.
 Trust v. Dolphin, Inc., 57 Haw. 554, 556, 560 P.2d 488, 490
 (1977) (stating that “this court has jurisdiction to consider
 errors unique to those post-judgment orders which have been
 timely appealed”); Powers v. Ellis, 55 Haw. 414, 418, 520 P.2d
 431, 434 (1974) (explaining that “to the extent that an order of
 sale merely implements matters contained in a decree of
 foreclosure, there is no need to take a separate appeal from it,”
 but an appellate court can review the order of sale for “errors
 unique to it”). However, the plaintiff’s “right to recover
 deficiency judgments was completely and finally adjudicated” by
 the court’s order granting summary judgment on the foreclosure. 
Id. Therefore, this court held that “where an appellant
 
challenges the right of a party to obtain a deficiency judgment
 in a foreclosure case, he must take his appeal in a timely 
14
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
fashion from the order which finally determined the right to a
 
deficiency,” i.e., the order granting summary judgment. Id. 
Because the defendant’s appeal was not from the deficiency
 judgment, the court dismissed the appeal for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction. Id. at 67, 783 P.2d at 856.
 
Similarly, in Citicorp Mortgage, Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 
Hawai'i 422, 16 P.3d 827 (App. 2000), the plaintiffs appealed, 
inter alia, from the court’s deficiency judgment, arguing that the defendant committed Truth in Lending Act (TILA) violations or unfair and deceptive practices. The ICA found that these issues were “defenses against [the plaintiff’s] right to the foreclosure, to be properly brought in the trial court against [the plaintiff’s] motion for summary judgment.” Id. at 433, 16 
P.3d at 838. Hence, those issues were “properly brought on appeal from the final judgment on that motion.” Id. However, 
the plaintiffs “appealed instead from the [] deficiency judgment.” Id. The ICA dismissed the appeal from the deficiency 
judgment because the plaintiffs “ma[de] no argument on appeal regarding the amount of the deficiency judgment,” and thus “fail[ed] to raise any cognizable issues with respect to the deficiency judgment.” Id. at 429 n.3, 16 P.3d at 835 n.3. 
(citing Miller, 71 Haw. at 71–72, 783 P.2d at 858). 
B.
 
In the instant case, Petitioners have never legally
 
15
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
challenged the court’s entry of the May 12, 2010 judgment of
 
foreclosure made pursuant to the order granting Respondent’s
 motion for summary judgment. As discussed supra, Petitioners’
 ultimate deadline to appeal that judgment was July 12, 2010. 
However, they did not appeal from that judgment. Hence, the May
 12, 2010 judgment became final and binding. As stated before,
 the foreclosure judgment “determined the merits of the
 controversy,” rendering subsequent proceedings “incident[] to its
 enforcement.” MDG Supply, 51 Haw. at 380, 463 P.2d at 528. 
The issue of whether or not Respondent had standing to 
bring suit is not “unique” to the confirmation of sale. Miller, 
71 Haw. at 71, 783 P.2d at 858. A lack of standing could have been raised at any time. See Keahole Defense Coalition, Inc. v. 
Board of Land and Natural Resources, 110 Hawai' i 419, 427, 134 
P.3d 585, 593 (2006) (“[S]tanding is a jurisdictional issue that may be addressed at any stage of a case.”) As in Citicorp, Petitioner’s lack of standing could have been brought as a defense to Respondent’s motion for summary judgment. See Miller, 
71 Haw. at 71, 783 P.2d at 858; see also MDG Supply, 51 Haw. at 380, 463 P.2d at 528. 
Because the time for appealing the judgment of
 
foreclosure passed without an appeal being taken, that judgment 
16
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
became final and Respondent’s right to foreclose was finally
 
decided in its favor. As related, the court’s foreclosure
 judgment entitled Respondent to foreclose on the mortgage, to
 have the property sold, and to a distribution of the proceeds. 
By virtue of the finality of the foreclosure judgment, Respondent
 was authorized to procure the sale of the property. 
VI.
 
As to Respondent’s second contention in this case, we
 
observe that none of the foregoing cases involved an objection to
 standing. See Miller, 71 Haw. at 71, 783 P.2d at 858. However,
 
we conclude that res judicata would preclude Petitioners from
 challenging Respondent’s standing in their appeal from the order
 confirming sale, despite the general proposition that a lack of
 standing may be raised at any time. Under the doctrine of res
 judicata, challenges to Respondent’s standing were subsumed under
 the foreclosure judgment, which had became final and binding.
 
A.
 
“Res judicata . . . limit[s] a litigant to one 
opportunity to litigate aspects of the case to prevent inconsistent results and multiplicity of suits and to promote finality and judicial economy.” Esteban, 129 Hawai' i at 158, 296 
P.3d at 1067. The doctrine prohibits parties from “relitigating 
a previously adjudicated cause of action.” Id. at 159, 296 P.3d 
17
          ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
at 1067 (quoting Bremer v. Weeks, 104 Hawai' i 43, 54, 85 P.3d 150, 
161 (2004)). 
As explained supra, foreclosure cases are bifurcated
 
into two appealable parts. Due to their bifurcated nature,
 
mortgage foreclosure proceedings may be treated as analogous to
 two separate proceedings for res judicata purposes.
 
Esteban is instructive in this regard. In Esteban, the
 
defendants did not appeal the court’s order foreclosing on their
 property. Id. at 155, 296 P.3d at 1063. However, prior to a
 
hearing on the motion for confirmation of sale, the defendants
 filed TILA claims against the plaintiff in federal court, arguing
 that they were exercising their right to rescind their mortgage. 
Id. at 156, 296 P.3d at 1064. The defendants then submitted a
 brief opposing the confirmation of sale on the basis of their
 federal TILA claims against the plaintiff. Id. 
This court held that, pursuant to 
Miller
, the
 
foreclosure judgment was a final judgment that allowed the
 plaintiff to assert the defense of res judicata. Id. at 160, 296
 
P.3d at 1069. Res judicata prevented the defendants from raising
 their TILA claims because the claims could have been raised as
 defenses in the foreclosure action, but were not. Id. at 160-61,
 
296 P.3d 1069-70. Thus, this court affirmed the court’s judgment
 confirming the sale of the plaintiff’s property. Id. at 161-62,
 
296 P.3d 1069-70. 
18
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Hence, in Esteban, this court held that, in the context
 
of proceedings to confirm the sale of foreclosed property, the
 
judgment of foreclosure has a preclusive effect. As in Esteban,
 in this case Petitioners raised a defense during the confirmation
 proceedings that was potentially subject to the res judicata
 effect of the foreclosure judgment. 
B.
 
However, Respondent apparently did not raise the 
affirmative defense of res judicata against Petitioners’ standing objection in the confirmation of sale proceedings. A res judicata defense is subject to waiver. State ex rel. Office of 
Consumer Protection v. Honolulu University of Arts, Sciences, and Humanities, 110 Hawai' i 504, 516, 135 P.3d 113, 125 (2006). (“In 
this case, Honolulu University did not plead res judicata as an affirmative defense in its answer nor did it raise the doctrine of res judicata during the circuit court proceedings. Consequently, Honolulu University has waived the affirmative defense of res judicata.”)(emphasis added). 
Nevertheless, “preclusion [i.e., res judicata] even can
 
be raised by an appellate court for the first time on appeal.”
 Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4405; cf.
 Clements v. Airport Authority of Washoe County, 69 F.3d 321, 330
 (9th Cir. 1995) (noting that because the court has “the ability 
19
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to overlook waiver and raise the res judicata issue sua sponte,”
 
“we [also] may do so with respect to issue preclusion”). 
Further, “just as the court of appeals can raise a res judicata
 defense on its own, it can entertain a party’s [res judicata]
 argument” raised for the first time on appeal. Wright and
 Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4405. This is because
 courts are concerned with “avoiding the burdens of relitigation”
 and “avoiding inconsistent decisions.” Id. Consequently, “[t]he
 
waiver principle need not sacrifice the judicial interests in
 enforcing res judicata principles.” Id.
 
Although Respondent raised the issue of res judicata
 
for the first time before this court, the “public interest” in
 “avoiding inconsistent results,” see Clements, 69 F.3d at 330, is
 strong. By virtue of the foreclosure judgment Respondent already
 had the right to have Petitioners’ property sold. A serious
 inconsistency would result if Respondent were held not to have
 the right to procure confirmation of the sale. Absent an
 objection unique to the sale of the property, such as a grossly
 inadequate sale price, see, e.g., Hoge v. Kane, 4 Haw. App. 533,
 540, 670 P.2d 36, 40 (1983), a ruling abrogating the sale would
 “impair or destroy the rights” granted by the foreclosure
 judgment, since an adverse ruling could prevent Respondent from
 receiving the proceeds of the action. Sure-Snap Corp. v. State 
20
         
 
       
           
             
               
            
            ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Street Bank and Trust Co., 948 F.2d 869, 875 (2d Cir. 1991). 
Therefore, in the limited circumstances of foreclosure
 proceedings, we consider the merits of the res judicata defense,
 even if impliedly waived.
 
C.
 
As explained in Esteban, “res judicata precludes not 
only the relitigation of claims or defenses that were litigated in a previous lawsuit, but also of all claims and defenses that might have been properly litigated, but were not litigated or decided.” 129 Hawai' i at 159, 296 P.3d at 1067. Further, “[w]hen 
a valid and final personal judgment is rendered in favor of the plaintiff . . . [i]n an action upon the judgment, the defendant cannot avail himself of defenses he might have interposed, or did interpose, in the first action.” Id. (quoting Restatement 
(Second) of Judgments § 18) (emphasis in original). 
“[T]he doctrine that a judgment creates its own cause
 
of action [i.e., an ‘action upon the judgment’] is an entirely
 practical legal device, the purpose of which is to facilitate the
 goal of securing satisfaction of the original cause of action.”
12
 
12
 To reiterate, “foreclosure cases are bifurcated into two
 
separately appealable parts: (1) the decree of foreclosure and the order of
sale, if the order of sale is incorporated within the decree, and (2) all
other orders.” Miller, 71 Haw. at 70, 783 P.2d at 858. As discussed infra,
by filing a motion for confirmation of sale, Respondent may be understood to
have in effect filed a separate action upon the judgment in a foreclosure
action.
 
21
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh v. Owenby, 42 Fed.
 
Appx. 59, 63 (9th Cir. 2002) (emphasis added). Traditionally, an
 action upon a judgment was an action to secure enforcement of an
 out of state judgment. See id. (citing Restatement(Second) of
 
Judgments § 18 cmt. f). However, courts have held that other
 actions similar to such proceedings also qualify as an action on
 the judgment for the purposes of res judicata. See In re Wright,
 
194 B.R. 715, 718 n.6 (Bankr. D. Conn. 1996) (Wright II).
 
For example, in Wright, the plaintiff brought a
 
“dischargability action” to have a debt declared to be non­dischargable in a pending bankruptcy case. In re Wright, 187
 
B.R. 826, 828 (Bankr. D. Conn. 1995) (Wright I). The original
 debt was the result of a district court action against the
 plaintiff. Id. at 829. In response to a motion for
 
reconsideration, Wright I explained that the “dischargability
 action” was the “same claim” as the prior district court action. 
Wright II, 194 B.R. at 718. The federal bankruptcy court further
 stated that characterization of the action as an action on the
 judgment was appropriate, because “both seek to preserve the
 creditor's ability to execute upon the prior judgment.” Id. at
 
718 n.6. Therefore, Wright I noted that “the Defendant would
 appear to be precluded under principles of res judicata from
 presently offering any defenses which were available to him in
 the District Court Action.” Id.
 
22
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Proceedings to confirm the sale of a foreclosed
 
property are similar to a traditional “action upon the judgment,”
 
inasmuch as both are proceedings to “facilitate the goal of
 securing satisfaction of the original cause of action.” See
 
Owenby, 42 Fed. Appx. at 63. This court has explained that, “[a]
 judgment of foreclosure of mortgage or other lien and sale of
 foreclosed property is final, although it contains a direction to
 commissioners to make a report of sale and to bring the proceeds
 into court for an order regarding their disposition.” MDG
 
Supply, 51 Haw. at 379, 463 P.2d at 528 (citations omitted). 
“Subsequent proceedings” are treated as incidental to enforcement
 of the foreclosure judgment. Id. Thus, as in a traditional
 
action upon the judgment, confirmation of the commissioner’s sale
 serves to facilitate the satisfaction of the original judgment. 
Hence, a proceeding for confirmation of sale is analogous to an
 “action on the judgment.” See Wright II, 194 B.R. at 718 n.6.
 
As stated previously, in an action on the judgment a
 
defendant is barred by res judicata from availing himself of
 “defenses he might have interposed, or did interpose, in the
 first action.” Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 18.
 Petitioners raised Respondent’s alleged lack of standing as a
 defense to the foreclosure proceeding, but did not appeal from
 the foreclosure judgment, which became final. In view of the 
23
         
         
           
           
            
         
             
         
  
         
            
           
             
             
             
           
              
              
       
           
           
             
            
           
          
             
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
functional similarity between the confirmation of sale proceeding
 
and an action on the judgment, we conclude that Petitioners
 cannot again raise the standing objection previously asserted in
 the foreclosure proceeding in the subsequent confirmation of sale
 proceedings.
13 Id. This promotes the finality of the foreclosure
 
judgment and prevents inconsistent results between the
 foreclosure judgment and the order confirming sale or other
 similar proceedings.
14
 
VII.
 
For the foregoing reasons, the April 29, 2011 judgment 
13 Contrary to Petitioners’ contention, it has been held that “the
 
doctrine of res judicata has application to questions of jurisdiction as well
as other issues and it ordinarily precludes a subsequent challenge to a
finding that jurisdiction does exist.” Cutler v. Hayes , 818 F.2d 879, 888
(D.C. Cir. 1987) (internal citations omitted) (holding that “[s]tanding ranks
amongst those questions of jurisdiction . . . whose disposition . . . may
preclude, or collaterally estop, relitigation of the precise issues of
jurisdiction adjudicated”).
 
14 In its Opening Brief before the ICA, Petitioners contended that
 
their challenges to Respondent’s standing could also be raised as a part of
their appeal from the court’s Order Denying Petitioners’ Motion to Set Aside
 Entry of Defaults. However, this court has explained that “a motion to set
 aside a default entry or a default judgment may and should be granted whenever
the court finds (1) that the nondefaulting party will not be prejudiced by the
reopening, (2) that the defaulting party has a meritorious defense, and (3)
that the default was not the result of inexcusable neglect or a wilful act.”
BDM, Inc. v. Sageco, Inc. , 57 Haw. 73, 76, 549 P.2d 1147, 1150 (1976).
Petitioners have raised no cognizable argument regarding prongs
(1) or (3) of Sageco. Hence, Petitioners’ contentions regarding the court’s 
Order Denying Petitioners’ Motion to Set Aside Entry of Defaults are not addressed further. Cf. Aames Funding Corp v. Mores , 107 Hawai 'i 95, 105 n.10,
110 P.3d 1042, 1052 n.10 (2005) (“Because the Moreses do not provide anydiscernible legal argument as to their contention that the court had nosubject matter jurisdiction because the Moreses did not receive the requisitecopies of the TILA ‘Notice of Right to Cancel,’ we do not address this contention further.”).

affirmed, but for the reasons set forth herein.15
