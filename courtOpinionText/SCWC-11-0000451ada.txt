OPINION OF THE COURT BY ACOBA, J. 
We hold that for the purposes of expungement of a drug

 HRS § 706-622.5(4) provides in relevant part:
 
(4) The court, upon written application from a
person sentenced under this part, shall issue a court
order to expunge the record of conviction for that
particular offense ; provided that a person has
successfully completed the substance abuse treatment

2 HRS § 706-622.5(1) states:
 
(1) Notwithstanding section 706-620(3), a person
convicted for the first or second time for any offense
under section 329-43.5 involving the possession or use
of drug paraphernalia or any felony offense under part
IV of chapter 712 involving the possession or use of
any dangerous drug, detrimental drug, harmful drug,

nonviolent after reviewing the person's criminal
history, the factual circumstances of the
offense for which the person is being sentenced,
and any other relevant information;
(b) The person has been assessed by a certified
substance abuse counselor to be in need of
 substance abuse treatment due to dependency or
abuse under the applicable Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual and Addiction Severity Index;
and
 (c) Except for those persons directed to
substance abuse treatment under the supervision

her probationary term and has been discharged from probation.

On December 29, 2005, Petitioner was sentenced to a

a “first time drug offender” pursuant to HRS § 706-622.5. The
 
purpose of HRS § 706-622.5 is “to promote treatment of nonviolent
 substance abuse offenders, rather than [imposing] incarceration,
 as being in the best interests of the individual and the
 community at large[,]” in order to reduce recidivism. Conf.
 Comm. Rep. No. 96-02, in 2002 Senate Journal, at 986, in 2002
 House Journal, at 1796. The Judgment, Conviction and Probation
 Sentence, filed by the court on December 29, 2005, included the
 following “Terms and Conditions of Probation”:
 
1.	 You must not commit another federal or state crime
 
during the term of probation;
 . . . .
 
5.	 You must notify a probation officer promptly if
arrested or questioned by a law enforcement officer[.]
 . . . .
 
Also, the Judgment, Conviction and Probation Sentence contained a
 
number of “Special Terms and Conditions,” including that
 Petitioner “must not possess, use, or consume any alcohol,
 unprescribed or illegal drug nor possess any drug-related
 paraphernalia.”
 
On January 24, 2011, after the conclusion of
 
Petitioner’s probation period, the Adult Client Services Branch

(probation department) filed a Certificate of Discharge
 
(Certificate), providing in relevant part as follows:
 
Wherefore, having completed the period of probation on
December 28, 2010, [Petitioner] shall be relieved of any
obligations imposed by the order of the court and shall have
satisfied the disposition of the court except as to any
action to collect unpaid fines, restitution, attorney’s
fees, costs, or interest (HRS [§] 706-630); thereby, is
restored to such rights deprived pursuant to Section 831-2
of the [HRS].
 
(Emphases added) (original emphasis omitted). On January 31,
 
2011, Petitioner filed her Motion. On February 8, 2011, 
Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i (Respondent) filed 
its Statement of Opposition to the Motion (Statement of Opposition). The Statement of Opposition included a discussion of Petitioner’s criminal history during the probationary period and stated that Petitioner was convicted of Theft in the Fourth Degree on November 8, 2006, Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) on March 7, 2007, Criminal Contempt of Court on May 3, 2007, and Driving Without a License on May 29, 2008 and again on December 15, 2009. 
The Statement of Opposition also noted that Petitioner
 
had not presented documentation to aid the court in assessing
 Petitioner’s completion of a substance abuse treatment program. 
On February 9, 2011, Petitioner filed an Addendum to her Motion
 (Addendum). This Addendum provided certificates indicating
 Petitioner’s completion of several substance abuse treatment
 programs, but did not address Petitioner’s criminal history.

     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The court held an initial hearing on February 10, 2011
 
with respect to Petitioner’s Motion. During the hearing, the
 
court raised the issue of Petitioner’s prior convictions,
 stating, “I’m just telling you right now it doesn’t look like
 [Petitioner] deserves an expungement because of these convictions
 . . . . I don’t know if she told probation -- even if she told
 them.” Following this statement, the court asked defense counsel
 if she wanted more time, apparently to check with Petitioner’s
 probation officer and to prepare a response to the judge’s
 remarks regarding the prior convictions. She answered in the
 affirmative and the judge granted a continuance. 
On April 18, 2011, Petitioner filed a “Memo in Support
 
of Motion for An Order of Expungement Pursuant to HRS § 706­622.5(4)” (Memo in Support). The Memo in Support stated, inter
 alia, that Petitioner had successfully completed three substance
 abuse programs, complied with the other terms and conditions of
 probation, and her “conviction[] should be expunged.” 
[P]er her Probation Officer [], [Petitioner] has in fact
complied with the “other terms and conditions” of her
 probation. This despite [Petitioner’s] conviction for Theft
4 (where she was considered an accomplice to her daughter
because they came into the store together), her [OVUII]
(based on a relapse after finishing [a drug abuse treatment
program] at Malama in 2006) when she was starting Family
Court Drug Court after the [OVUII] as well as participating
in The Shelter’s Relapse Prevention Program after the
[OVUII], and because she was getting Dual Diagnosis
treatment based on Mental Health and Drug addiction issues,
[Petitioner’s probation officer] still believes [Petitioner]
has successfully complied with the other terms and
conditions of her probation and thus discharged [Petitioner]
from Probation, with [Petitioner’s probation officer]’s
supervisor’s approval.
[Petitioner’s probation officer] is proud of

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
[Petitioner] and related that [Petitioner] continues to
attend AA/NA and is a mentor for other Family Court Drug
Court clients. [Petitioner’s probation officer] also
relates that while on probation to date, [Petitioner] is
trying to adopt her granddaughter and cannot do so if she
has a felony conviction.
As the law under HRS § 706-622.5 speaks to complying
 
with “other terms and conditions” of probation and as in her
probation officer’s opinion and recommendation that
[Petitioner] has complied with the other terms and
conditions to her satisfaction, [Petitioner’s] felony
convictions should be expunged at this time.
 
(Emphases added.)
 
The court continued with the hearing on Petitioner’s
 
Motion on April 21, 2011. On that date, Petitioner’s counsel
 
stated, “I don’t have anything further to add to my [Memo in
 Support].” The court proceeded to deny the Motion:
 
THE COURT: . . . . Well, after reviewing this
matter, it is quite clear that [Petitioner] was
convicted of one, two, three, four crimes including
driving under the influence of an intoxicant and twice
driving without a license while she was on probation.
[HRS § 706-622.5(4)] requires that she have
completed her substance abuse treatment and complied
with other terms and conditions of her probation, and
not committing another crime is clearly a condition of
the probation . So it’s the [c]ourt’s view that she
hasn’t qualified under the statute for the relief
requested. So I’m going to deny the motion.
 
(Emphases added.) The court thus concluded that Petitioner did
 
not qualify for expungement of her felony convictions because, in
 
committing other crimes during her probationary period, she had
 violated a term of her probation. 
II.
 
A.
 
Pertinent to the Application, Petitioner argued in her
 
Opening Brief to the ICA that the court (1) erred in denying her
 
7
         
 
   
       
        
        
         
       
         
      
 
          ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Motion because its “hyper-technical” interpretation of HRS § 706­
622.5(4) disregarded legislative intent and HRS § 706-630 (Supp.
 
7
1998),  a statute that provides the procedure for terminating a
defendant’s probation obligations; (2) violated her due process
 rights because it decided that she was in violation of a term and
 condition of her probation after she had been discharged from
 probation; (3) lacked jurisdiction to modify her original
 probation sentence after her discharge, which in effect, it did
 when the court concluded that Petitioner had violated a term and
 condition of probation; and (4) incorrectly found that she had
 been convicted of multiple crimes during her period of probation,
 because that finding was not supported by substantial evidence.
8
 
B.
 
In its Answering Brief to the ICA, Respondent did not
 
contest expungement. Rather, Respondent stated (1) that the
 court had jurisdiction to hear Petitioner’s Motion because such a
 motion can be made before or after the term of probation is
 
7 HRS § 706-630 states:
 
Discharge of defendant. Upon the termination of
the period of the probation or the earlier discharge
of the defendant, the defendant shall be relieved of
any obligations imposed by the order of the court and
shall have satisfied the disposition of the court ,
except as to any action under this chapter to collect
unpaid fines, restitution, attorney’s fees, costs, or
interest.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
8
 In light of our disposition, we need not decide this question.
 
8
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
completed, and (2) that the court did not err in finding that
 
Petitioner committed another crime while she was on probation,
 but (3) agreed with Petitioner that the court erred in denying
 the Motion, because Petitioner had “satisfied the disposition of
 the court” upon her discharge from probation. Respondent thus
 concurred that Petitioner was entitled to expungement of her
 conviction. 
C.
 
With respect to Petitioner’s first argument, the ICA
 
held that the court’s denial of Petitioner’s Motion was
 consistent with the plain language of HRS § 706-622.5(4)
 requiring that the movant “comply with other terms and conditions
 of probation,” and that HRS § 706-630 is not in conflict with HRS
 § 706-622.5(4) because HRS § 706-630 only “governs the
 probationer’s future obligations after the probation sentence has
 been completed,” rather than obligations of the court in
 expungement proceedings. State v. Pali, No. CAAP-11-0000451,
 
2012 WL 2505516, at *1 (App. June 29, 2012) (SDO) (emphasis in
 original). 
In addressing Petitioner’s second argument that her due
 
process rights had been violated because she did not have notice
 that “her original sentence might be modified,” the ICA stated
 that “[Respondent] did not seek revocation of [Petitioner]’s
 probation, nor did it seek to modify its terms after
 
9
         
 
 
           
      
        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
[Petitioner]’s probation had ended.” Id. Further, “Petitioner
 
presented no authority for the proposition that [Respondent] must
 
raise any violation of probation for purposes of expungement, in
 advance of the filing of the motion to expunge.” Id. (emphasis
 
in original).
 
The ICA also rejected Petitioner’s third argument,
 
stating that the decision of the court under HRS § 706-622.5 “did
 not convert the expungement subsection into a term of her
 probation nor make [her probation] subject to revocation or
 
modification procedures[, ]” which would have resulted in a
 
jurisdictional defect. Id. at *2. 
9
Finally, the ICA undertook a plain error review with
regard to the court’s finding that Petitioner had been convicted
 
of five offenses during her probationary period. Id. The ICA
 
noted that the court’s finding was based on prior convictions
 presented by Respondent, which Petitioner failed to contradict
 with evidence and effectively admitted during the proceedings.
10
 
Id. Thus, the ICA held that the court had not committed plain
 
error in finding that Petitioner had been convicted of crimes
 during her probationary period, and affirmed the court’s May 11,
 2011 order denying Petitioner’s Motion. Id.
 
9
 In light of our disposition, we need not discuss whether the ICA’s
 
so called “plain error” review was proper.
 
10
 See Petitioner’s Memo in Support, quoted in part, supra.
 
10
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
III.
 
Petitioner presented three questions in her 
Application, namely (1) “[w]hether the ICA gravely erred in 
holding that the [] court’s denial of [Petitioner]’s motion for expungement of conviction was consistent with the plain language of HRS § 706-622.5(4), where [Petitioner] completed substance abuse treatment and was successfully discharged from probation[;]” (2) “[w]hether the ICA gravely erred in rejecting [Petitioner]’s due process challenge and whether such holding is obviously inconsistent with the ICA decision in State v. Johnson, 92 Hawai' i 36, 986 P.2d 987 (App. 1999)[;]” and (3) “[w]hether the 
ICA gravely erred in rejecting [Petitioner]’s challenge to the [] court's jurisdiction to address probation violations after the probation period had lapsed and whether such holding is obviously inconsistent with the ICA decision in State v. Asuncion, 120 Hawai'i 312, 205 P.3d 577 (App. 2009).” On October 8, 2012, 
Respondent filed a Response to Petitioner’s Application (Response). 
IV.
 
The purpose of Act 161, S.L.H. 2002, which enacted HRS
 
§ 706-622.5, is “to require first time non-violent drug
 offenders, . . . to be sentenced to undergo and complete drug
 treatment instead of incarceration.” 2002 Haw. Sess. Laws Act
 161, § 1 at 571. The 2002 Conference Committee Report declares
 
11
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
that the statute was designed to “approach[] crime as being the
 
result of addiction that is treatable,” and therefore, “to
 promote treatment of nonviolent substance abuse offenders, rather
 than incarceration.” Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 96-02, in 2002 Senate
 Journal, at 987, in 2002 House Journal, at 1796. This objective
 is designed to help the individual avoid the negative effects of
 incarceration. See 2002 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 161, § 1 at 569
 
(“Without proper treatment, an offender is at risk to continue to
 be drug dependent and to commit new offenses[.]”).
 
Initially it may be noted that, with respect to HRS §
 
706-622.5(4), “expungement of record” means “[t]he removal of a
 conviction (esp. for a first offense) from a person’s criminal
 record.” Black’s Law Dictionary 662 (9th ed. 2009). HRS § 706­
622.5(4) indicates the defendant’s record will be expunged only
 for convictions that fall within the purview of HRS § 706-622.5,
 
specifically drug offenses prescribed by HRS § 706-622.5(1). 
Thus, the expungement allowed under the statute is limited to
 
those felony drug convictions for which the defendant was
 sentenced to probation, and will not apply to any other
 conviction. 
It is plain that the expungement provision of HRS §
 
706-622.5(4) would enable offenders to avoid the lasting negative
 effects of a criminal record stemming from a felony conviction. 
For example, Petitioner’s Memo in Support alleged that a record
 
12
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of a felony conviction would prevent her from adopting her 
granddaughter. Generally, a felony conviction imposes substantial disabilities on a defendant. See, e.g., Haw. Const. 
art. 2, § 2 (noting that a convicted felon cannot vote except upon the person’s final discharge); HRS § 378-2.5 (Supp. 2011) (indicating that an employer “may inquire about and consider an individual's criminal conviction record concerning hiring, termination, or the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment” without engaging in a discriminatory practice); HRS § 612-4 (Supp. 2011) (noting that a convicted felon may not serve on a jury); Haw. Admin. Rules (HAR) § 17-663-82 (stating that felony convictions affect status when an individual or his or her family is applying for public benefits). See also State v. 
Nguyen, 81 Hawai' i 279, 288, 916 P.2d 689, 698 (1996) (noting that 
a criminal conviction can have collateral consequences, including “loss of the right to vote [Haw. Const. art. 2, § 2] or [to] travel abroad [see, e.g. 51 C.F.R. § 51.61 (2008)], loss of civil service employment [see, e.g., HRS § 831-3.1 (Supp. 2003)], loss of a driver’s license [HRS § 286-240 (Supp. 2006)], loss of the right to possess firearms [HRS § 134-7(b) (Supp. 2006)] or an undesirable discharge from the Armed Services [see, e.g., Kalista v. Sec’y of Navy, 560 F. Supp. 608, 614 (D. Colo. 1983)].”);
 David Wolitz, The Stigma of Conviction: Coram Nobis, Civil
 Disabilities, and the Right to Clear One’s Name, 2009 B.Y.U. L.
 
13
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Rev 1277, 1315 (2009) (“The reputational consequences of
 
conviction are already substantial, but the ongoing explosion of
 information available over the Internet[] . . . greatly
 exacerbates the reputational damage of conviction.”). 
V.
 
In her Application, Petitioner first argues that the
 
ICA erred when it upheld the court’s denial of the Motion
 “because it appeared that [Petitioner] was convicted multiple
 times for criminal offenses during her probationary period, [and
 this] was consistent with the plain language of [HRS § 706­622.5(4)].” Pali, 2012 WL 2505516, at *1. She maintains that
 
use of the term “shall” in the statute mandates that her Motion
 be granted, because she had successfully completed drug treatment
 
and her probation term had been satisfied.
 
In its Response to this court, Respondent acknowledges
 
that it took the same position as Petitioner with respect to
 
statutory interpretation in its Answering Brief to the ICA. As
 noted supra, before the ICA, Respondent acknowledged that
 Petitioner had “satisfied the disposition of the court” upon her
 discharge from probation and was therefore entitled to an
 expungement of her conviction. However, in its Response to the
 Application, Respondent contends that HRS § 706-622.5(4) requires
 that both conditions, the treatment program and the terms and
 conditions of probation, must be complied with. Further,
 
14
         
 
           
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Respondent reiterates the ICA’s statement that “HRS § 706-630
 
does not address the expungement of the defendant’s probation
 sentence or whether the probationer complied with conditions of
 probation, but instead governs the probationer’s future
 obligations . . . .” (Quoting id.) (Emphasis in original.) 
A.
 
It is well-established that the starting point for 
statutory interpretation is the language of the statute, and where such language is “plain and unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning.” Dejetley v. 
Kaho'ohalahala, 122 Hawai' i 251, 262, 226 P.3d 421, 432 (2010) 
(quoting Rees v. Carlisle, 113 Hawai' i 446, 452, 153 P.3d 1131, 
1137 (2007)). Petitioner is correct that the word “shall” in the 
statute is ordinarily used to denote mandatory action.
11 However, 
the words “provided that” contemplate that the individual meet 
the two conditions described in the statute, namely, (1) successful completion of the substance abuse treatment and (2) compliance with other terms and conditions of probation. The 
pivotal question presented in this case is how the court is to 
determine whether the movant has “complied with other terms and 
conditions of probation.” This issue arises because although several convictions occurred during Petitioner’s probationary

period, probation was not revoked and Petitioner completed her
 
probationary period and was formally discharged.
 
B.
 
“Complied” in HRS § 706-622.5(4) is not a term expressly
 
defined in the statute, and, thus, this court “may ‘resort to legal
 or other well accepted dictionaries as one way to determine the
 ordinary meaning of certain terms not statutorily defined.’” State
 
v. Kikuta, 125 Hawai' i 78, 96, 253 P.3d 639, 658 (2011) (quoting 
State v. Kalama, 94 Hawai' i 60, 63 n.6, 8 P.3d 1224, 1227 n.6 (2000)) 
(citation omitted) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). There are multiple dictionary definitions of “comply.” One of the definitions is “to complete, perform what is due[.]” Merriam 
Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 236 (10th ed. 1993) (emphasis added).
12 It is not clear in the context of the statutory provisions 
governing probation whether the term “complied” in HRS § 706-622.5 is satisfied by the “discharge” from probation, which signifies that the probationer has completed probation and “satisfied the disposition of the court” under HRS § 706-630 and as reflected in the Certificate of Discharge. 
Here, criminal violations existed and probation could have
 
been revoked under HRS § 706-625 (Supp. 2011), but was not. Instead,
 the defendant completed her probation period, and was released from

 “Comply” can also mean “to be ceremoniously courteous[,]” or “to
 
conform or adapt ones’ actions to another’s wishes, to a rule, or to
 
necessity[.]” Merriam Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 236.

all further court obligations under HRS § 706-630 (except incidental
 
matters not relevant here). Plainly, this situation was not
 contemplated in HRS § 706-622.5(4) with respect to compliance with
 “other terms and conditions of probation.” 
Because probation is involved, “compliance,” in HRS § 706­
622.5(4) should be construed in pari materia with other relevant
 statutory provisions regarding probation. Statutes on the same
 subject matter should be construed in pari materia in order to
 clarify the meaning of a term. See State v. Kamana' o, 118 Hawai' i 
210, 218, 188 P.3d 724, 732 (2008) (“[L]aws in pari materia, or upon
 the same subject matter, shall be construed with reference to each
 other. What is clear in one statute may be called upon in aid to
 explain what is doubtful in another.”) (internal quotation marks and
 
13
 citation omitted). HRS § 706-625  concerns violations of probation
13 HRS § 706-625 states, in relevant part:
 
(1) The court, on application of a probation officer,
the prosecuting attorney, the defendant, or on its own
motion, after a hearing, may revoke probation except as
provided in subsection (7), reduce or enlarge the conditions
of a sentence of probation, pursuant to the provisions
applicable to the initial setting of the conditions and the
provisions of section 706-627.
(2) The prosecuting attorney, the defendant’s
probation officer, and the defendant may appear in the
hearing to oppose or support the application, and may submit
evidence for the court’s consideration.
 
(3) The court shall revoke probation if the defendant
has inexcusably failed to comply with a substantial
requirement imposed as a condition of the order or has been
convicted of a felony. The court may revoke the suspension
of sentence or probation if the defendant has been convicted
of another crime other than a felony.
(4) The court may modify the requirements imposed on the
defendant or impose further requirements, if it finds that such an
action will assist the defendant in leading a law-abiding life.

          ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
and vests discretion in the court to decide what constitutes a
 
violation and what remedy should apply. HRS § 706-625(1) indicates
 that “[a] court, on application of a probation officer, the
 prosecuting attorney, the defendant, or on its own motion, after a
 hearing, may revoke probation . . . , [or] reduce or enlarge the
 conditions of a sentence of probation.” (Emphases added.) “A court
 shall revoke probation if the defendant has inexcusably failed to
 comply with a substantial requirement imposed as a condition of the
 order or has been convicted of a felony.” HRS § 706-625(3). A court
 may revoke the suspension of a sentence or probation if the defendant
 has been convicted of another crime other than a felony. Id. A
 
court may also “modify the requirements imposed on the defendant or
 impose further requirements.” HRS § 706-625(4). Thus, a court has
 the authority to determine, at any time during a defendant’s
 probation period, whether that defendant is in compliance with the
 terms and conditions of probation. If a “court revokes probation[,]”
 it “may impose on the defendant any sentence that might have been
 imposed originally . . . .” HRS § 706-625(5).
 
In the instant case, the probation department was charged
 
with the supervision of Petitioner and determined, as indicated in
 the Certificate issued pursuant to HRS § 706-630, that Petitioner
 “satisfied the disposition of the court.” See HRS § 806-73(a) (Supp.
 
13(...continued)
(5) When the court revokes probation, it may impose on the
defendant any sentence that might have been imposed originally for
the crime of which the defendant was convicted. (Emphasis added).

2001) (“A probation officer shall keep informed concerning the
 
conduct and condition of the defendant and report thereon to the
 court, and shall use all suitable methods to aid the defendant and
 bring about an improvement in the defendant’s conduct and
 condition.”). The probation officer or the prosecuting attorney
 could have timely moved for revocation of probation before the
 completion of her probationary term, see HRS § 706-625(1), but did
 not. Review of compliance with terms of probation under HRS § 706­625, and enforcement of such terms prior to completion of probation,
 then, is largely committed to the probation department, the parties,
 and the court.
14 As is clear in this case, neither the probation
 
department, the parties, nor the court objected to Petitioner’s
 release from the court’s probation order, before she was discharged
 from probation.
 
C.
 
Petitioner’s discharge from probation relieved her of any
 
further obligations to the court. The Certificate confirmed this,
 and pursuant to HRS § 706-630, it was deemed that Petitioner had
 “completed the period of probation.” Thus, she was no longer subject
 to modification or revocation orders under HRS § 706-625. Once the
 probation term is completed, a court no longer has jurisdiction to
 modify or revoke the defendant’s probation. State v. Viloria, 70 
14
 Here, the convictions were not felonies, but instead misdemeanor
 
convictions for fourth degree theft, OVUII, and driving without a license, and
apparently were not viewed by the probation department or the prosecutor as
necessitating modification or revocation of probation.

Haw. 58, 60, 759 P.2d 1376, 1378 (1988). By the time of discharge,
 
Petitioner had already overcome a variety of hurdles, including
 meeting the eligibility requirements for sentencing under HRS § 706­622.5, completing drug treatment, and finishing her probation period. 
Thus, pursuant to HRS § 706-630, as confirmed by the discharge
 certificate, Petitioner had satisfied the “disposition” of the
 court’s probation order, in other words, legally “complied” with the
 terms and conditions of probation. Accordingly, a court was not
 authorized after probation discharge to redetermine whether
 Petitioner should not have “be[en] relieved of any obligations” or
 failed to “satisf[y] the disposition of the court[.]”
15 HRS § 706­
630. Upon completion of the probation term and discharge, then,
 
Petitioner must be deemed to have “complied with the terms and
 conditions of probation” because she had “satisfied the disposition
 of the court.” 
The “disposition of the court[,]” includes the terms of the
 
probation, which would be satisfied at the time of discharge. HRS §
 706-630. Having “satisfied the disposition of the court,” therefore,
 a defendant is deemed to have “complied with the terms and conditions
 of probation.” This interpretation is supported by the language of
 
15
 As indicated supra, a subsequent determination of non-compliance
 
with probation terms and conditions after discharge would necessarily conflict
with HRS § 706-630 and the Certificate. Relatedly, as noted, the ICA had
rejected Petitioner’s argument that the court’s order denying expungement
rendered HRS § 706-630 meaningless. Pali, 2012 WL 2505516, at *1.
 
20
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
HRS § 706-630 itself, which provides that upon termination of the 
probation period or discharge, the defendant “shall have satisfied the disposition of the court, except as to any action under this chapter to collect unpaid fines, restitution, attorney’s fees, costs, or interest.” Id. (emphasis added). These exceptions evince the 
legislature’s intent that all other probation conditions, excepting the monetary terms specifically referenced, are satisfied upon discharge. In Asuncion, the ICA employed this interpretation of HRS § 706-630, when it stated that “Asuncion’s term of probation ended without any motion being filed to revoke Asuncion’s probation or modify or enlarge the conditions of Asuncion’s probation,” and therefore, “[p]ursuant to HRS § 706-630, . . . Asuncion was deemed to have satisfied his probation sentence and was relieved of any further obligation imposed by the terms of his probation.” 120 Hawai' i at 
319, 205 P.3d at 585 (emphasis added). 
A contrary approach would have an unsettling effect on
 
every probation discharge. Under Respondent’s and the ICA’s
 approach, an expungement hearing would resurrect questions of
 compliance that were required to be presented before and not after
 discharge. Such issues may arise years after probation discharge
 inasmuch as no time limits apply to expungement proceedings. Even if
 time limits did apply, such questions would undermine the past 
21
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
discretion exercised by probation officers, defense attorneys,
 
prosecutors, and judges in allowing probation discharges, and invite
 conflicting judicial determinations as to past discharges. Re­examination of the probation proceedings, after discharge, for
 redetermination of compliance with the terms and conditions of
 probation would result in intractable conflict in the law and in the
 penal proceedings governing probation. Thus, HRS § 706-622.5(4)
 cannot be viewed as divorced from HRS § 706-630 or construed in
 isolation, but must, under accepted statutory canons, be construed
 with HRS § 706-630.
 
In sum, were HRS § 706-622.5(4) read to require something
 
other than that the defendant had “satisfied the disposition of the
 court,” an expungement hearing could potentially become a pseudo-
probation revocation hearing in which the parties could contest, and
 the expungement court would determine anew, whether the defendant had
 met the terms and conditions of his or her probation after discharge
 had already taken place. Consequently, a subsequent determination of
 non-compliance in an HRS § 706-622.5(4) expungement hearing after
 discharge would necessarily conflict with the procedures set forth in
 HRS § 706-625 regarding revocation of probation, HRS § 706-630
 regarding discharge, and a certificate of discharge. 
D.
 
Treating discharge as satisfaction of the terms and
 
22
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
conditions of probation is not inconsistent with the apparent impetus
 
behind the rehabilitative approach of HRS § 706-622.5. The House
 Committee Report with respect to Act 44, which amended HRS § 706­622.5 to its current form, stated that Act 44 “[m]odif[ied] the
 expungement provision that permits a first-time nonviolent drug
 offender to have the conviction expunged on a one-time-only basis
 upon successful completion of substance abuse treatment.” H. Stand.
 Comm. Rep. No. 495-04, in 2004 House Journal, at 1605 (emphasis
 added). By expressly specifying substance abuse treatment, see also
 HRS § 706-622.5(1)-(4), as a prerequisite for expungement under HRS §
 706-622.5(4), the legislature placed emphasis on this factor. In
 contrast, although probation compliance is included in the statute,
 the legislative history does not mention the phrase “complied with
 other terms and conditions of probation.” An interpretation of HRS §
 706-622.5 that mandates the court to grant expungement upon
 successful completion of substance abuse treatment and discharge from
 probation recognizes the primary objectives of the statute, as
 expressed in the Committee Report.
 
Under the circumstances of this case and within the
 
framework of the penal code provisions relating to probation, we
 
conclude that, consistent with HRS § 706-625(1), because Petitioner
 
had completed her probation term and thus “satisfied the disposition
 
of the court,” as provided by HRS § 706-630, she had, in effect,
 
23
         
 
       
         
           
              
          
           
        
           
          
         
           
           
          
           
            
           
             
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
complied with the terms and conditions of probation for purposes of
 
expungement under HRS § 706-622.5(4).16
 
VI. 
With respect to other issues raised herein, we observe that
 
expungement is not “automatic” pursuant to HRS § 706-622.5, as
 Petitioner contends, because the court must still determine whether a
 defendant successfully completed a substance abuse treatment program
 and whether the defendant completed his or her probation term. If
 the defendant is discharged from probation, then the defendant has
 statutorily complied with the terms and conditions of the probation
 sentence. 
As noted previously, Respondent argued that both
 
conditions, the treatment program and the terms and conditions of
 probation, must be satisfied. However, our interpretation of HRS §
 706-622.5(4) does give “legal effect” to the full text, inasmuch as
 
16 Petitioner’s second question concerns a potential violation of
 
Petitioner’s due process rights resulting from the court’s “modification” of
 
her probation terms and conditions when it denied her expungement motion on
the basis of her prior convictions. She argues that she was not provided with
notice that her original sentence would be modified at the expungement
hearing, Respondent had a statutory burden under HRS § 706-625(3) to prove
that her convictions amounted to “inexcusable” noncompliance with a
 “substantial” term and condition of probation, and she did not have the
opportunity to submit evidence with respect to her past convictions.
As decided herein, Petitioner is not subject to modification or
revocation of her probation terms pursuant to HRS § 706-625 after completion
of the probation term. Accordingly, during the expungement hearing, the court
 cannot, in effect, “modify” her probation terms by deciding anew whether
compliance with terms and conditions had been met. Therefore, the expungement
proceedings are not subject to the statutory requirements of HRS § 706-625.
As a result, Petitioner’s due process rights would not be violated, because,
as held herein, the court does not apply the burden of proof or procedural
requirements set forth in HRS § 706-625 in expungement proceedings.

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
“complied with other terms and conditions” indicates that a defendant
 
may file a motion for expungement after his or her probation period
 has been completed and he or she has been discharged.
 
Respondent also contended that the phrase, “[t]he court may
 
require other terms and conditions of probation,” in the “first-time
 drug offender” statute, at HRS § 706-622.5(2), indicates that the
 court should conduct an independent review of whether the defendant
 complied with those terms and conditions, following discharge. 
However, this statutory phrase does not support Respondent’s
 position. HRS § 706-622.5(2) states in its entirety,
 
(2) A person eligible under subsection (1) may be
sentenced to probation to undergo and complete a substance
abuse treatment program if the court determines that the
person can benefit from substance abuse treatment and,
notwithstanding that the person would be subject to
sentencing as a repeat offender under section 706-606.5,
the person should not be incarcerated to protect the
public. If the person fails to complete the substance
abuse treatment program and the court determines that the
person cannot benefit from any other suitable substance
abuse treatment program, the person shall be subject to
sentencing under the applicable section under this part.
As a condition of probation under this subsection, the
court may direct the person to undergo and complete
substance abuse treatment under the supervision of the drug
court if the person has a history of relapse in treatment
 programs. The court may require other terms and conditions
of probation , including requiring that the person
contribute to the cost of the substance abuse treatment
 program, comply with deadlines for entering into the
substance abuse treatment program, and reside in a secure
drug treatment facility.
 
(Emphases added.) 
Thus, HRS 706-622.5(2) merely describes the options,
 
including drug court, that may be considered by the court in
 
sentencing a first or second time offender to probation, in addition
 
25
         
  
       
             
            
          
             
           
          
         
             
         
        
           
           
           
           ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to the requirement of completing a drug treatment program. “[O]ther
 
terms and conditions of probation” may be imposed, as they were
 imposed in the instant case. HRS § 706-622.5(2). But, as noted
 supra, once probation is completed and the defendant discharged, the
 defendant “shall be relieved of any obligations imposed by the
 [probationary] order of the court and shall have satisfied the
 disposition of the court[,]” HRS § 706-630, and this determination
 cannot be undermined by a subsequent post-probation hearing on
 expungement. 
Finally, the ICA’s construction of HRS § 706-630 as
 
governing only post probation obligations is incorrect insofar as it
 de-emphasizes the central tenet of the statute. That tenet is that
 upon discharge, the defendant is deemed to have satisfied the
 disposition of the court order of probation, and except for
 incidental obligations, is no longer under any obligation that was
 
“imposed” by the court.
17 HRS § 706-630.
 
17 Petitioner’s third question concerning the court’s lack of
 
jurisdiction is based on Asuncion , 120 Hawai 'i at 329, 205 P.3d at 594, in 
which the ICA held that the circuit court “no longer had jurisdiction to
revoke [the defendant’s] probation or modify or enlarge its terms,” because
 the State failed to take any action to modify the terms of the defendant’s
probation before she completed the probation period. Likewise, in Johnson , a
court incorrectly sought to modify the defendant’s original sentence in the
form of a free-standing restitution order that imposed additional monetary
obligations on the defendant. 92 Hawai 'i at 43, 986 P.2d at 987.
However, because under our view, completion of and discharge from
probation cannot be subsequently reexamined, Petitioner is not adversely
affected in the expungement proceeding. Petitioner would be in the same
 position as she was in before she filed the Motion.
Our holding is consistent with Asuncion , on the principle that once the
defendant has completed his or her probation, the court no longer has

Based on the foregoing, we vacate the ICA’s July 26, 2012
 
judgment and the court’s May 11, 2011 order denying Petitioner’s
 
Motion, and remand the case to the court with instructions to enter
 an order granting the Motion.

jurisdiction to, in effect, modify the probation terms or revoke the
defendant’s probation sentence. 120 Hawai 'i at 329, 205 P.3d at 594. 
Asuncion pointed out that “the State failed to take any steps during 
Asuncion’s probation ” (emphasis added), but instead initiated proceedings to
punish the defendant for a probation violation after the completion of his
probation term. Id. In this case, on the other hand, Petitioner requested
the court for an order of expungement, and the court was vested withjurisdiction to decide the Motion, because, as we hold herein, a modificationor revocation of Petitioner’s probation is not involved.
