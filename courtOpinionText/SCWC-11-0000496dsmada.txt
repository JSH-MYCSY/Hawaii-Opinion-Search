KEITH MURAUSKAS, Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellant,

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, STATE OF HAWAI' I,
Respondent/Defendant-Appellee.
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(ICA NO. CAAP-11-0000496; CIV. NO. 09-1-1272-06)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and Duffy, JJ.,
and Circuit Judge Border, in place of McKenna, J., recused)
 
Petitioner/plaintiff-appellant Keith Murauskas filed an
 
application for a writ of certiorari to review of the
 
Intermediate Court of Appeals' (ICA) dismissal of petitioner's
 appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
The time for filing
 
an application for a writ of certiorari commenced upon the filing
 of the ICA's September 15, 2011 order of dismissal, not the ICA's
 October 6, 2011 order denying reconsideration of the dismissal. 
See HRS ยง 602-59(c) (Supp. 2010) ("An application for a writ of
 certiorari may be filed in the supreme court no later than ninety
 days after the filing of the judgment or dismissal order of the
 intermediate appellate court.") (underscoring added). 
Petitioner's application for a writ of certiorari -- deemed filed
 
on January 2, 2012 when it was delivered to prison officials for
 mailing -- was filed more than ninety days after the filing of
 the September 15, 2011 order of dismissal. The application is
 untimely. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for a writ of
 
certiorari is dismissed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, February 21, 2012.
