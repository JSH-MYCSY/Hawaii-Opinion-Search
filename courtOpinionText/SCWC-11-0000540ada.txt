OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAYAMA, J.
 
Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai
'i (State) 
asks us to consider whether its complaint against 
Respondent/Defendant-Appellee Marianne L. Codiamat (Codiamat) provided sufficient notice to Codiamat of the charged offense to  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
meet the constitutional requirements of due process. The State’s 
complaint charged Codiamat with harassment, in violation of Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 711-1106(1)(a) (Supp. 2010).
1 
Before the commencement of trial, the District Court of the First 
2
Circuit (district court)  granted Codiamat’s motion to dismiss
the State’s complaint on the ground that it left the defendant
 unsure of what offense was charged because it was pleaded in the
 disjunctive using the conjunction “or.”
 
On application for writ of certiorari to this court, 
the State argues: (1) that the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) erred in affirming the dismissal because the State did not charge non-synonymous alternative means disjunctively; (2) that the ICA’s dismissal is inconsistent with Hawai' i precedent 
allowing some use of the disjunctive in charging documents; and (3) that Hawai' i precedent limiting the use of disjunctive 
charging should be overturned. 
We hold that the complaint in this case met due process
 
requirements, regardless of whether one concludes that the
 
1 On the date of the alleged incident, as it does now, HRS § 711­
1106(1)(a) defined harassment as follows:
 
(1) A person commits the offense of harassment if, with
intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other person, that
person:
(a) Strikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touches
another person in an offensive manner or subjects the
other person to offensive physical contact[.]

 The Honorable Clarence A. Pacarro presided.

disjunctively charged acts were synonymous or non-synonymous. 
Therefore, it is unnecessary for us to reach the question of
 
whether the acts charged disjunctively were synonymous. 
The acts
 
charged disjunctively were contained within a single subsection
 of a statute and were reasonably related so that the complaint
 sufficiently apprised the defendant of the nature of the charged
 acts and allowed the defendant to prepare a defense.
 
We vacate the judgment of the ICA affirming the
 
district court’s notice of entry of judgment and/or order and
 remand this case to the district court for further proceedings.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On January 24, 2011, the State charged Codiamat with
 
harassment in violation of HRS § 711-1106(1)(a).
3 The complaint
 
stated:
 
On or about the 6th day of January, 2011, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, MARIANNE L. CODIAMAT,
with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm [Complainant], did
strike, shove, kick, or otherwise touch [Complainant] in an
 
3 The Dissent asserts that the State conceded that “only the
 
‘[s]trikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touches another person in an offensive
manner’ portion of HRS § 711-1106(1)(a) will be tried in this case” and
therefore “the reference to ‘subjects the other person to offensive physical
contact’ in the charge . . . has no relevance at all for pleading, trial, or
appeal purposes.”  Dissenting Opinion at 4 (emphasis in original).  In its
 application for writ of certiorari, the State asserts that, “[it] is neither
alleging nor proving that [Codiamat] committed the same offense in two
entirely different ways, because the only act being charged here is an
offensive touching of another person.”  However, the State’s admission must be
read in the context of its continuing assertion that “the charge’s words of
‘touch[ing Complainant] in an offensive manner’ are factually synonymous with
the words ‘subject[ing Complainant] to offensive physical contact.’”  
Although the State maintains that it is only charging the defendant with
committing a single act, this act’s nature and breadth are unclear.
 
3
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
offensive manner or subject [Complainant] to offensive
physical contact, thereby committing the offense of
Harassment, in violation of Section 711-1106(1)(a) of the
Hawaii Revised Statutes.
 
(Emphasis added). 
On June 15, 2011, at a pretrial hearing, Codiamat
 
orally moved to dismiss the complaint based on State v. McCarthy,
 
No. 29701, 2010 WL 3433722 (App. Aug. 31, 2010) (mem. op.),4
 
arguing that the disjunctive wording in the complaint made it
 difficult to prepare a defense.
5 Over the State’s objection, the
 
district court granted Codiamat’s motion and dismissed the
 complaint without prejudice. 
On appeal to the ICA, the State argued that McCarthy
 
only prohibits charging in the disjunctive when the acts, or the
 results of the acts, charged disjunctively are non-synonymous. 
It maintained that the acts described in Codiamat’s complaint –­“strike, shove, kick, or otherwise touch in an offensive manner
 or subject to offensive physical contact” –- are simply multiple
 descriptions of “an offensive touching.” The State reasoned that
 the disjunctive charging did not deprive Codiamat of fair notice
 because the disjunctive was only used to link synonymous words. 
In her answering brief, Codiamat argued that the
 
4
 See infra Part III. A. 1 (discussing McCarthy ).
 
5
 Defense counsel stated that the State had recently filed amended 
complaints in the majority of its pending harassment cases to comply with
McCarthy and that the State had not taken the opportunity to do so here.
 
4
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
reasoning in McCarthy applied here to prohibit disjunctive
 
charging. Specifically, Codiamat argued that (1) strike, (2)
 shove, (3) kick, (4) otherwise touch in an offensive manner, and
 (5) subject to offensive physical contact each have a distinct
 meaning. Codiamat concluded that by charging these acts
 disjunctively, “[She] was not given proper notice of what she was
 actually being charged with doing.”
6
 
The ICA affirmed the district court’s judgment, 
concluding that “[b]ecause the charge was pleaded in the disjunctive, it did not sufficiently apprise Codiamat of what she must be prepared to meet.” See State v. Codiamat, No. CAAP-11­
0000540, 2012 WL 3113898, at *1 (App. July 31, 2012) (SDO). The ICA first established that “touching another person in an offensive manner” is not synonymous with “subjecting the other person to offensive physical contact.” Id. at *1-2. Relying 
upon its earlier holding in State v. Pesentheiner, 95 Hawai' i 
290, 22 P.3d 86 (App. 2001), the ICA clarified that “‘subject[ing] the other person to offensive physical contact’” has a separate meaning from offensive touching, namely, “‘contact with an item physically appurtenant to the body.’” Id. at *2 
(quoting Pesentheiner, 95 Hawai' i at 294-95, 22 P.3d at 90-91). 
The ICA then cited State v. Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 279, 567 P.2d 1242 
6
 Codiamat also alleges that the complaint lacked sufficient details
 
regarding the factual allegations of the alleged incident.
 
5
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(1977), for the principal that “‘[w]here a statute specifies
 
several ways in which its violation may occur, the charge may be
 
laid in the conjunctive but not in the disjunctive.’” Id. at *2­
3 (quoting Jendrusch, 58 Haw. at 283 n.4, 567 P.2d at 1245 n.4). 
The ICA therefore concluded that the disjunctive phrasing in the
 complaint constituted a fatal defect and held that the district
 court did not err in dismissing the case without prejudice. Id. at *3. 
Chief Judge Nakamura filed a concurring opinion in 
which he argued that the “Jendrusch rule[  7] cannot withstand 
rational scrutiny.” Id. at *4 (Nakamura, C.J., concurring). He 
contended that charging in the conjunctive provides no greater
 notice to the defendant than charging in the disjunctive,
 explaining that “[b]ecause the State can establish the harassment
 offense against Codiamat by proving either of the charged
 alternative means of committing the offense, charging her in the
 disjunctive clearly provided her with fair notice of the
 
accusation and what she was required to meet.” Id.
 at *4. Chief
 
Judge Nakamura opined that he believed this court should re­
examine and overturn its precedent limiting the use of
 
7
 The term “ Jendrusch rule” was first used by Chief Judge Nakamura 
in this concurring opinion.  He noted that “[a]lthough the Jendrusch footnote
is arguably dicta, it has been cited with approval in other cases by theHawai'i Supreme Court.”  Codiamat, 2012 WL 3113898, at *4 n.1 (Nakamura, C.J., 
concurring). 
6
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
disjunctive pleading. Id. at *5-6. 
Codiamat timely filed an application for writ of
 
certiorari on September 7, 2012. This court accepted Codiamat’s
 
application on October 22, 2012, and oral argument was heard on
 November 29, 2012. 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Sufficiency of a Complaint
 
The issue of whether a complaint provides sufficient 
notice to a defendant is reviewed under the de novo, or right/wrong, standard. State v. Merino, 81 Hawai' i 198, 212, 915 
P.2d 672, 686 (1996). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. The complaint was sufficient to meet the requirements of due
process
 
Hawai'i takes a nontechnical approach to pleading 
standards. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 14 of the Hawai' i Constitution mandate 
that a “charge must be worded in a manner such that the nature and cause of the accusation could be understood by a person of common understanding.” State v. Sprattling, 99 Hawai' i 312, 318, 
55 P.3d 276, 282 (2002) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted) (quoting State v. Israel, 78 Hawai' i 66, 71, 890 P.2d 
303, 308 (1995)). The complaint must “inform[] the accused 
7
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
‘fully’ of the nature and cause of the accusation against him or
 
her, and sufficiently appris[e] the defendant of what he or she
 must be prepared to meet to defend against the charges.” State
 
v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 66, 276 P.3d 617, 635 (2012) (Acoba, 
J., concurring and dissenting). 
1. Hawai'i precedent regarding disjunctive charging 
Hawai'i courts have never enforced a strict rule 
against charging in the disjunctive. “The rule against disjunctive allegations has been modified and relaxed in Hawaii in cases of offenses which are ‘constituted of one or more of several acts or which may be committed by one or more of several means or with one or more of several intents or which may produce one or more of several results.’” Territory v. Tamashiro, 37 
Haw. 552, 553 (1947) (quoting Revised Laws of Hawai' i (RLH) § 
10804 (1945)). 
In Jendrusch, the first modern case in which this court
 
addressed the issue of disjunctive charging, the defendant was
 charged with disorderly conduct in violation of HRS § 711­1101(1).
8 58 Haw. at 280, 567 P.2d at 1243. The complaint
 
8
 At the time of the alleged incident, HRS § 711-1101 (Supp. 1974)
 
provided in pertinent part:
 
“(1) A person commits the offense of disorderly conduct if,
with intent to cause physical inconvenience or alarm by a
member or members of the public, or recklessly creating a

8
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
charged the defendant disjunctively with violating subsection
 
(1)(b) or subsection (1)(c) of the statute.9 Jendrusch, 58 Haw.
 
at 280, 567 P.2d at 1243-44. The court held that the complaint
 was insufficient on other grounds.
10 Id. at 282, 567 P.2d at
 
1245. But, in dicta, the court stated:
 
The type of conduct proscribed by subsection (1)(b) is not
factually synonymous with that proscribed by subsection
(1)(c).  In charging the defendant in the disjunctive rather
than in the conjunctive, it left the defendant uncertain as
to which of the acts charged was being relied upon as the
basis for the accusation against him.  Where a statute
 specifies several ways in which its violation may occur, the
 
8(...continued)
risk thereof, he:
 
. . . .
 
(b) Makes unreasonable noise; or
(c) Makes any offensively coarse utterance, gesture,
or display, or addresses abusive language to any
person present, which is likely to provoke a violent
response[.]”
 
Jendrusch, 58 Haw. at 280, 567 P.2d at 1243 (emphasis omitted) (quoting HRS §
711-1101).
 
9 The complaint read:
 
You [Jendrusch] are hereby charged that in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, on or about the 14th
day of September, 1974, with intent to cause public
inconvenience, annoyance or alarm by members of the public
or recklessly creating a risk thereof, you did make
unreasonable noise or offensively coarse utterance, gesture
or display or address abusive language to any person
present, thereby committing the offense of Disorderly
Conduct . . . .
 
Id. at 280, 567 P.2d at 1243-44 (emphasis omitted; brackets in original).
 
10
 The court held that the complaint failed to charge an offense 
because it was drawn from an outdated version of the statute and did not
 account for subsequent amendments.  Jendrusch , 58 Haw. at 283, 567 P.2d at
 
1245.
 
9
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
charge may be laid in the conjunctive but not in the
disjunctive.
 
Id. at 283 n.4, 567 P.2d at 1245 n.4 (citing Territory v. Lii, 39
 
Haw. 574 (1952)). 
Later cases clarified permissible means of charging a
 
defendant in the alternative. In an indictment for an offense
 that may be committed by a variety of acts, two or more of those
 acts may be charged in multiple counts or conjunctively in one
 count. See State v. Lemalu, 72 Haw. 130, 134, 809 P.2d 442, 444
 
(1991) (approving of charging in several counts); see also Lii,
 39 Haw. at 578-79 (approving of charging conjunctively in one
 count). However, the preferred method for charging an offense
 that may be committed in more than one way is to charge in the
 conjunctive/disjunctive -- alleging that the defendant committed
 the offense in one way and/or in another way. State v. Batson,
 73 Haw. 236, 250, 831 P.2d 924, 932 (1992) (citing State v.
 Cabral, 8 Haw. App. 506, 510, 810 P.2d 672, 675 (1991)).
 
These later cases extrapolated a rule from Jendrusch:
 
“[W]here a statute proscribes an offense that can be committed by
 factually alternative types of conduct, ‘the charge may be laid
 [out] in the conjunctive but not in the disjunctive.’” Batson,
 
73 Haw. at 249-50, 831 P.2d at 932 (first brackets added, second
 brackets in original) (quoting Lemalu, 72 Haw. at 134, 809 P.2d
 
10
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
at 444); accord Jendrusch, 58 Haw. at 283 n.4, 567 P.2d at 1245
 
n.4. Though this court quoted the Jendrusch rule in Batson and
 
Lemalu, we have never relied upon the rule in reaching the
 holding of a case. 
The ICA previously construed the Jendrusch rule
 
narrowly, to forbid disjunctive charging only where a defendant
 is charged with committing an offense under multiple sections of
 a statute. See State v. Freitas, No. 28430, 2010 WL 2862051, at
 
*3 (App. July 22, 2010) (SDO) (“Jendrusch is inapposite because
 [defendant] was not charged with engaging in conduct proscribed
 by different sections of [the statute] . . . .”). The ICA’s
 decision in McCarthy represented a departure from its earlier
 interpretation of the Jendrusch rule. 
McCarthy was convicted of harassment in violation of
 
HRS § 711-1106(1)(b).
11 McCarthy, 2010 WL 3433722, at *1. On
 
appeal, McCarthy alleged that the trial court erred in denying
 
11 HRS § 711-1106(1)(b) (Supp. 2005) provided then, as it does now:
 
(1) A person commits the offense of harassment if, with
intent to harass, annoy, or alarm another person, that
person:
. . . .
 
(b) Insults, taunts, or challenges another person in a
manner likely to provoke an immediate violent response
or that would cause the other person to reasonably
believe that the actor intends to cause bodily injury
to the recipient or another, or damage to the property
of the recipient or another[.]
 
11
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
his motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of specificity. Id.
 
at *1-2. McCarthy’s complaint read:
 
On or about the 4th day of October, 2006, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, KIRK MCCARTHY, with
intent to harass, annoy, or alarm SCOTT AKAU, did insult,
taunt, or challenge SCOTT AKAU in a manner likely to provoke
an immediate violent response or that would cause SCOTT AKAU
to reasonably believe that KIRK MCCARTHY intended to cause
bodily injury to him or another or damage to the property of
SCOTT AKAU or another . . . .
 
Id. at *1 (emphasis added). Relying upon the Jendrusch rule and
 
federal pleading standards, the ICA held that “[t]he complaint is
 insufficient because it charges the results of the conduct in the
 disjunctive (‘or’), rather than in the conjunctive (‘and’).” Id.
 
at *2 (emphasis added). The court noted that by charging two
 non-synonymous results disjunctively -- provoking a violent
 response or causing fear of injury -- the defendant was left
 uncertain as to which acts were alleged. Id. at *3. The court
 
also recommended using the conjunctive/disjunctive (“and/or”)
 construction established in Batson.
12 Id. at *4. 
12 Based on the ICA’s use of capital letters to emphasize certain 
uses of “or,” it appears that the ICA recommended amending the complaint to
read:
 
On or about the 4th day of October, 2006, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, KIRK MCCARTHY, with
intent to harass, annoy, or alarm SCOTT AKAU, did insult,
taunt, or challenge SCOTT AKAU in a manner likely to provoke
an immediate violent response [and/]or that would cause
SCOTT AKAU to reasonably believe that KIRK MCCARTHY intended
to cause bodily injury to him [and/]or another [and/]or
damage to the property of SCOTT AKAU [and/]or
another . . . .
 
(continued...)
 
12
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Despite the ICA’s apparent assertion that disjunctive
 
charging of non-synonymous acts violates due process, the court
 
itself was doubtful of this conclusion. In the final footnote of
 McCarthy, the ICA stated: “The case law notwithstanding, it is
 not clear to us that phrasing the charge in the conjunctive
 provides any additional notice over a charge phrased in the
 disjunctive.” Id. at *4 n.4.
 
2. Applying Hawai' i precedent to the complaint here 
The ICA relied upon Jendrusch to conclude that because
 
the complaint against Codiamat charged two forms of non-
synonymous conduct disjunctively, the charge did not provide the
 defendant with adequate notice. See Codiamat, 2012 WL 3113898,
 
at *1-2. As discussed above, the Jendrusch rule suggests that
 complaints charging non-synonymous acts disjunctively may not
 provide adequate notice. However, a closer examination of
 Jendrusch demonstrates that not all uses of the disjunctive, even
 when joining non-synonymous acts, constitute a fatal flaw. 
12(...continued)
McCarthy, 2010 WL 3433722, at *1-3.  But, the ICA also criticized the “[u]se
of the disjunctive to combine multiple forms of conduct .” Id. at *3 (emphasis
 
added).  It is therefore unclear why the ICA did not, or if it perhaps did,
recommend charging the conduct in the conjunctive/disjunctive as well: insult,
taunt, and/or challenge.
 
13
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Jendrusch involved a charge of disorderly conduct under
 
HRS § 711-1101(1), subsections (b) and (c).13 Jendrusch, 58 Haw.
 
at 280, 567 P.2d at 1243. The disorderly conduct codified in
 
subsection (b) is: “unreasonable noise.” HRS § 711-1101(1)(b). 
The disorderly conduct codified in subsection (c) is, generally,
 rude conduct: “offensively coarse utterance[s], gesture[s], or
 display[s], or . . . abusive language . . . likely to provoke a
 violent response.” HRS § 711-1101(1)(c). Notably, the acts of
 subsection (c) were charged disjunctively as they appear in the
 statute -- “mak[ing] offensively coarse utterance, gesture, or
 display, or address[ing] abusive language to any person present.” 
Jendrusch, 58 Haw. at 280, 567 P.2d at 1243-44 (emphasis added). 
The Jendrusch court expressed no concern as to charging these
 non-synonymous acts disjunctively. The court stated only that
 charging subsection (b) and subsection (c) disjunctively deprived
 the defendant of notice.
14 Id. at 283, 567 P.2d at 1245. 
In this case, the State charged Codiamat under a single
 
subsection of the harassment statute, HRS § 711-1106(1)(a). The
 ICA construed the language of HRS § 711-1106(1)(a) as
 
13
 See supra note 10.
 
14
 From the text of Jendrusch, it is unclear if the use of the 
disjunctive was impermissible because it joined acts from two different
subsections of the statute, or if it was impermissible because it joined two
different categories of behavior.
 
14
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
constituting two distinct forms of conduct: direct offensive
 
touching and indirect offensive contact. But, whether Codiamat
 was charged with direct offensive touching or indirect offensive
 contact is relatively inconsequential because the actions are
 closely related, falling within the same category of behavior. 
Because Codiamat was charged with violating only one subsection
 of the statute, codifying a single category of harassing
 behavior, the complaint does not violate the Jendrusch rule. 
B. Hawaii’s disjunctive charging rule strikes the appropriate
balance between ease of administration and protection of
defendants’ rights
 
The State argues that Hawai' i precedent limiting the 
use of disjunctive in charging documents should be reexamined and 
overturned. The State adopts Chief Judge Nakamura’s reasoning from his concurring opinion and argues for “a reasonable approach.” The State’s argument relies upon the principle that Hawaii’s courts “interpret a charge as a whole, employing practical considerations and common sense.” Sprattling, 99 
Hawai'i at 318, 55 P.3d at 282. 
The State encourages us to adopt Alaska’s approach for
 
determining the sufficiency of a charge. In Christian v. State,
 513 P.2d 664 (Alaska 1973), the Alaska Supreme Court determined
 that a complaint provided sufficient notice when it charged the
 
15
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
defendant with “mak[ing] false statements, conceal[ing] material
 
facts or otherwise commit[ting] fraud in application for
 registration of a vehicle.” 513 P.2d at 667 (emphasis added). 
The Christian court explained that “under modern principles of
 criminal procedure an indictment should not be construed
 hypertechnically in an effort to find fatal flaws when, by a
 reasonable approach, it can be read as fulfilling the basic
 criteria of sufficiency.” Id. It reasoned that the charge
 
provided fair notice to the defendant where it “named the
 defendant, gave the date and place of the offense, stated the
 essential elements of the offense, cited the precise number of
 the certificate of title, and named several methods by which the
 offense was perpetrated.” Id.
 
Codiamat disagrees, arguing that disjunctive pleading
 
does not provide adequate notice to the defendant. She claims
 that the disjunctively worded complaint left her unsure of how to
 prepare a defense.
15 Codiamat takes issue with Chief Judge
 
15 In its reply to Codiamat’s response, the State contends that the 
procedural history of the case demonstrates that Codiamat was not hindered in
preparing her defense.  The State notes that at the first trial setting forthis case, Codiamat “objected to the State’s request for a continuanceostensibly because she was ready to proceed to trial.”  This theorizing is irrelevant.  The standard for evaluating the sufficiency of a complaintchallenged before trial is “whether the nature and cause of the accusationcould be understood by a person of common understanding,” not whether the
defendant understood the accusation.  Sprattling, 99 Hawai 'i at 318, 55 P.3d 
at 282 (brackets omitted; emphasis added). 
16
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Nakamura’s conclusion that charging in the conjunctive is
 
misleading because it suggests that the State must prove both
 means charged while in actuality proof of either means will
 suffice. Codiamat maintains that charging in the conjunctive
 provides notice to the defendant that he or she is accused of
 committing the offense by each means charged. At oral argument,
 Codiamat also suggested that the most important aspect of notice
 is informing the defendant of the nature of the charge, and that
 informing the defendant of what is necessary to prepare a defense
 is secondary.
 
We disagree with Codiamat’s weighing of the dual
 
purposes of notice. It is equally important that the defendant
 first, understand the acts with which he or she is charged and
 second, be provided with sufficient information to prepare a
 defense. We agree, in part, with Chief Judge Nakamura: the use
 of the disjunctive may be appropriate when it provides notice to
 the defendant that the State may attempt to prove guilt by
 showing that the defendant committed any one of multiple related
 acts. This alerts the defendant that he or she must be prepared
 to defend against each of the charged alternatives. However, the
 disjunctive may not provide adequate notice to the defendant when
 used to join charges of violations of multiple sections or
 subsections of a statute. In these instances, the use of the
 
17
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
disjunctive may confuse the defendant as to the number of
 
disparate acts with which he or she is charged. This conclusion
 is supported by our precedent.
 
As discussed above, the disjunctive charging rule in 
Hawai'i has evolved over time. The earliest Hawai' i precedent 
provided that analogous terms, or terms used merely for illustrative purposes, could be charged disjunctively, but that all other uses of the disjunctive were impermissible. Kim Ung 
Pil, 26 Haw. at 726. By 1947, the rule came to allow some disjunctive charging of acts, means, intents, and results. See 
Tamashiro, 37 Haw. at 553. If dicta from Jendrusch is interpreted as precedent, then charges brought under separate sections or subsections of a statute may not be worded disjunctively. Jendrusch, 58 Haw. at 283 n.4, 567 P.2d at 1245 
n.4. However, states of mind may be charged disjunctively. See, 
e.g., Batson, 73 Haw. at 248, 831 P.2d at 931 (charging defendant “intentionally or knowingly”); Jendrusch, 58 Haw. at 280, 567 P.2d at 1243 (charging defendant with “intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm by members of the public or recklessly creating a risk thereof”). Furthermore, acts may be charged disjunctively when the words used charge similar or analogous forms of conduct that are codified in a single subsection of a statute. See, e.g., Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i at 51,

276 P.3d at 620 (charging defendant with “operat[ing] or
 
assum[ing] actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public
 way, street, road, or highway while under the influence of
 alcohol”); Jendrusch, 58 Haw. at 280, 567 P.2d at 1243-44
 (charging defendant with “mak[ing] offensively coarse utterance,
 gesture, or display, or address[ing] abusive language to any
 person present”).
 
These principles strike a balance between a more common
 
sense, less technical, approach to charging while still
 protecting defendants’ rights to notice and due process.
 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
We hold that when charging a defendant under a single
 
subsection of a statute, the charge may be worded disjunctively
 in the language of the statute as long as the acts charged are
 reasonably related so that the charge provides sufficient notice
 to the defendant.
16 We therefore vacate the ICA’s August 30,
 
16 This holding does not disturb our earlier precedent that when 
charging an offense that may be committed in more than one way, the State may
charge in separate counts, in the conjunctive, or, preferably, in theconjunctive/disjunctive. See Batson, 73 Haw. at 250, 831 P.2d at 932; Lemalu,
72 Haw. at 134, 809 P.2d at 444; Lii, 39 Haw. at 578-79.  Furthermore, whilethe State may charge in the alternative, the State may not charge a defendantwith any offense, or any alternative, that is not supported by probable cause. See Hawai 'i Rules of Professional Conduct (HRPC) Rule 3.8(a) (1994) (“A public
prosecutor or other government lawyer shall . . . not institute or cause to beinstituted criminal charges when [the prosecutor or government lawyer] knowsor it is obvious that the charges are not supported by probable cause . . . .”(brackets in original))
