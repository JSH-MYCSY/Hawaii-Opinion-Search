CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(CAAP-11-0000660; CIV. NO. 10-1-0614(2))
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
On October 21, 2014, Petitioner Sylvia Cabral filed a 
one-page document in the Intermediate Court of Appeals entitled 
“Application for Writ of Certiorari,” which contains no content. See Hawai' i Revised Statutes § 602-59(b) (Supp. 2013). The 
October 21, 2014 document was subsequently filed in this court on October 22, 2014. On October 30, 2014, Petitioner filed a seventy-three page document entitled “Application for Writ of    Certiorari.” The October 30, 2014 filing is a timely application
 
for writ of certiorari. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for writ of
 
certiorari that was filed in the Intermediate Court of Appeals on
 October 21, 2014, and in this court on October 22, 2014, is
 dismissed. The court will consider the October 30, 2014 filing
 as a timely filed application for writ of certiorari.
