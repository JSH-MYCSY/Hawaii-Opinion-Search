CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna and Pollack, JJ.,
and Circuit Judge Sakamoto, in place of Acoba, J., recused)
  
Following a bench trial, Petitioner Stanley K. Huihui,
 
Jr. (Huihui) was convicted of Abuse of Family or Household
 
Members, Terroristic Threatening, and Unlawful Imprisonment. 
His
 
convictions were affirmed by the Intermediate Court of Appeals
 (ICA). On application to this court, Huihui contends that the
 Family Court of the Third Circuit (family court) abused its
 discretion when it precluded evidence of the complaining
 witness’s (CW’s) propensity for self-harm. Because such evidence
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
would have been relevant to establish that Huihui reasonably
 
believed that the CW was attempting to harm herself, it should
 have been admitted. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Huihui’s appeal arises from an incident where he
 
allegedly confined the CW in his vehicle, threatened her, and
 committed various acts of physical abuse on her person. Huihui
 was charged by complaint with one count of Abuse of Family or
 Household Members, HRS § 709-906, one count of Terroristic
 Threatening in the Second Degree, HRS §§ 707-715(1) and 707­717(1), and one count of Unlawful Imprisonment in the Second
 Degree, HRS § 707-722(1). 
Prior to trial, Huihui filed a motion to introduce 
character evidence of the CW’s “suicidal tendencies” pursuant to Hawai'i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 404(a)(2). The family court 
did not dispose of Huihui’s motion until August 10, 2011, when the case proceeded to a bench trial.
1 At the start of the 
proceedings, Huihui made an oral motion to introduce an audio recording: 
DEFENSE COUNSEL: I’ll do also an oral motion in limine
 
regarding . . . an audio recording that was provided . . .
to me by the State.  That audio recording occurred . . . two
or three days prior to this incident.
 
THE COURT: When did you receive this recording?
 DEFENSE COUNSEL: I received the recording . . . last week.

 The Honorable Joseph P. Florendo, Jr. presided.

   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
I actually requested the recording because . . . the
defense, would like to introduce it.  I think that the State
 with my discussions with [the Prosecutor] stated that there
would be an objection regarding relevance[,] so we could
address . . . whether that recording will be allowed into
evidence or not. 
THE COURT:
 Well, why don’t you wait until that time comes. 
DEFENSE COUNSEL:
 We can do it that way, too.
 
The trial itself hinged on a credibility determination:
 
Whether to believe the CW’s or Huihui’s version of events. The
 
CW testified as follows. She and Huihui got into an argument
 while driving in Huihui’s truck. Huihui eventually pulled his
 truck to the side of the road and punched the CW in the face. 
When the CW tried to open her passenger-side door, Huihui grabbed
 her arm and told her that if she got out, he was going to punch
 her in the face again. The CW then jumped into the back seat of
 the truck, where her daughter was seated. Huihui grabbed the CW
 by the hair and yanked her back into the front seat. The CW
 again tried to open her door and Huihui punched her in the face. 
Huihui testified to a substantially different version
 
of events. He claimed that while driving in his truck, the CW
 accused him of having a sexual relationship with another woman. 
The argument escalated until the CW tried to open the passenger-
side door. Huihui testified that he believed she was going to
 jump out of the moving truck. Huihui grabbed the door handle and
 told the CW that if she wanted to get out he would stop the

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
truck. Huihui then pulled to the side of the road and offered to
 
let the CW out. The CW remained in the vehicle. 
Huihui resumed driving at approximately 55-miles-per­
hour. Shortly thereafter, the CW opened the passenger-side door
 and attempted to jump from the moving truck. Huihui testified
 that he grabbed the CW by the hair to keep her from falling out. 
Huihui held the CW by the hair until he could bring his truck to
 a stop. As the truck slowed, the CW repeatedly slammed into the
 side of the truck, sustaining several injuries. Once the truck
 had come to a stop, Huihui pulled the CW by the hair back into
 the front seat, where she hit her head on the gear shift. 
At this point, Huihui’s attorney attempted to introduce
 
evidence that the CW had threatened to harm herself on prior
 occasions:
 
DEFENSE COUNSEL: Have you had any prior contact with [the
CW] where she threatened to hurt herself?
 
PROSECUTOR: Objection. . . . Relevance. 
THE COURT:  Sustained. 
DEFENSE COUNSEL: Your Honor, . . . it is character evidence
but I believe it is permissible under 404 – 404(a)(2), . . .
evidence of [the] character of the victim is . . .
admissible . . . to show that she was acting . . . to harm
herself during this incident and that she had done so or
threatened to do so on prior occasions. 
THE COURT:  Character is not at issue in this case.
 
DEFENSE COUNSEL: [The CW] did attempt to harm herself by
jumping out of the car. 
THE COURT: It’s not a character question in my mind. 
DEFENSE COUNSEL: Well, the character of . . . having
 
4
  
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
suicidal tendency[.]
 
THE COURT:  You need more foundation in order to establish
 
that the acts in this case were suicidal.  
DEFENSE COUNSEL: Your Honor, just evidence that the victim
attempted to jump out of the car while going 55, I think
that’s circumstantial evidence [that] a person has . . .
suicidal traits or at least traits that she wants to harm
 herself.  
THE COURT: I’ll sustain the objection.  
At the close of trial, Huihui was found guilty of all
 
three charges and sentenced accordingly. Huihui timely appealed
 
to the ICA, which affirmed the family court’s judgment and
 conviction. 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
Evidentiary rulings made on the basis of HRE Rule 404
 
are reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Richie, 88
 
Hawai'i 19, 36, 960 P.2d 1227, 1244 (1998). 
Evidentiary decisions based on HRE Rule 403, which require a
judgment call on the part of the trial court, are reviewed
for an abuse of discretion.  HRE 404 represents a
particularized application of the principle of HRE 403 (see
Commentary to HRE 404), and we will employ the same abuse of
discretion standard of review.
 
Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
Under the abuse of discretion standard
 
the trial court may not be reversed by an appellate court
unless the trial court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason
or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the
substantial detriment of a party litigant.  Under that
 standard different trial judges may, on the same facts,
arrive at opposite rulings without any of them being
reversible on appeal.
 
Kealoha v. Cnty. of Hawai' i, 74 Haw. 308, 318, 844 P.2d 670, 675 
5
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(1993) (citation and quotations omitted). 
Where evidence is improperly excluded, the judgment of
 
the trial court must be reversed unless it can affirmatively be
 
said that the exclusion was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
See State v. Perez, 64 Haw. 232, 234, 638 P.2d 335, 337 (1981);
 State v. Russo, 67 Haw. 126, 138, 681 P.2d 553, 563 (1984).
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
In this case, the family court abused its discretion
 
when it excluded evidence of the CW’s propensity for self-harm. 
A. Relevance
 
HRE Rule 401 (2004) states that evidence is relevant if 
it has “any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of 
consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” See also 
State v. Maddox, 116 Hawai' i 445, 457, 173 P.3d 592, 604 (App. 
2007) (stating that character evidence “is properly excluded where the evidence at trial does not support a factual dispute” that is of consequence to the action). 
Character evidence that the CW had a propensity for
 
self-harm was relevant to Huihui’s defense. A defendant may make
 out a choice of evils defense if, among other things, the
 defendant reasonably believed that his or her action was
 necessary to avoid an imminent harm. See HRS §§ 703-300, 
6
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
703-302(1) (1993). Huihui’s testimony indicated that the CW
 
sustained her injuries in an apparent suicide attempt, and that
 his act of pulling the CW by the hair was motivated by his belief
 that the CW was attempting to harm herself. Thus, a fact “of
 consequence to the determination of the action” was whether a
 reasonable person would believe that the CW was attempting to
 harm herself. 
If the CW had a propensity for self-harm, then it is
 
more likely that she actually attempted to jump from a vehicle
 moving at 55-miles-per-hour. If that were true, then it would
 support the conclusion that Huihui reasonably believed he needed
 to grab the CW’s hair and/or confine her to his vehicle to
 prevent an imminent harm. Thus, evidence of the CW’s prior
 attempts to harm herself would make the occurrence of a fact of
 consequence more likely. The family court erred when it
 concluded that such evidence was irrelevant. 
B. Character Evidence
 
Having established that evidence of the CW’s propensity
 
for self-harm was relevant, Huihui should have been allowed to
 
introduce that evidence pursuant to the rules governing character
 evidence. HRE Rule 404(a) (2004) states: “Evidence of a person’s
 character or a trait of a person’s character is not admissible
 for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a
 
7
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
particular occasion[.]” However, HRE Rule 404(a)(2) allows the
 
accused to introduce “[e]vidence of a pertinent trait of
 character of the victim of the crime[.]” See also State v.
 
Basque, 66 Haw. 510, 512, 666 P.2d 599, 601 (1983) (“‘[A]
 defendant who claims self-defense to a charge of homicide is
 permitted to introduce evidence of the [victim’s] violent or
 aggressive character either to demonstrate the reasonableness of
 his apprehension of immediate danger or to show that the [victim]
 was the aggressor.’”) (quoting State v. Lui, 61 Haw. 328, 330,
 603 P.2d 151, 154 (1979)). Here, the CW’s propensity for self-
harm was a pertinent character trait, and evidence tending to
 establish that trait should have been admitted pursuant to HRE
 Rule 404(a)(2).
2 Because there is a reasonable possibility that
 
the family court’s error might have contributed to Huihui’s
 conviction, we cannot say that it was harmless beyond a
 reasonable doubt.
 
C. Foundation
 
The family court also precluded evidence of the CW’s
 
propensity for self-harm because it concluded that Huihui had not
 
laid adequate foundation to establish that the acts in this case
 were suicidal. Huihui testified that the CW attempted to jump
 
2
 Accordingly, we need not address whether evidence of the CW’s
 
prior attempts to harm herself should have been admitted pursuant to HRE Rule
404(b).

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
from a vehicle that was traveling at approximately 55-miles-per­
hour. No further foundation was required to establish that the
 CW’s alleged action was an attempt at self-harm. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the ICA’s
 
November 1, 2013 judgment on appeal and the family court’s
 August 10, 2011 judgment of conviction and sentence. This case
 is hereby remanded to the family court for further proceedings
 before a different judge.

 This case must be resolved before a different judge on remand
 
because the family court made problematic statements during sentencing
allocution.
