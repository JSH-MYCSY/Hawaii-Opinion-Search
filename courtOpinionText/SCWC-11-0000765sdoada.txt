CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, and McKenna, JJ., with
Acoba, J., dissenting separately, with whom Pollack, J., joins) 
 
Petitioner/plaintiff-appellee State of Hawai
'i seeks 
review of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’s April 8, 2013 
Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its February 26, 2013 Summary Disposition Order. The ICA’s judgment vacated the Family Court of the First Circuit’s September 28, 2011 Judgment of 
1
Conviction and Sentence,  which convicted Matthew Lockey of
1
 The Honorable Wilson M.N. Loo presided. 
 
 
    ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Harassment in violation of Hawai' i Revised Statutes 
§ 711-1106(1)(a).2 On certiorari, the State contends that the 
ICA erred in holding that (1) the complaint did not sufficiently 
apprise Lockey of what he must be prepared to meet because the language was worded in the disjunctive; and (2) Lockey’s untimely objection was not waived. 
We recently addressed this precise issue in State v. 
Codiamat, ––– Hawai' i ––––, ––– P.3d –––– (2013) (holding that a 
charge worded disjunctively in the language of the statute provides sufficient notice so long as the acts charged are contained in a single subsection of a statute and are reasonably related). 
Lockey was charged under the same statute as the
 
defendant in Codiamat, and the language of the charge was
 virtually identical to the language upheld as valid in Codiamat. 
See id. at *1. Applying the holding of Codiamat to the present
 case, the State’s HRS § 711-1106(1)(a) charge provided Lockey
 with sufficient notice of what he must be prepared to meet. 
Accordingly, the ICA erred in vacating Lockey’s judgment of
 
2
 HRS § 711-1106 (Supp. 2009) provides in relevant part:
 
(1) A person commits the offense of harassment if,
with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other
person, that person:
  (a) Strikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touches
another person in an offensive manner or
subjects the other person to offensive physical
contact[.]
 
2
     ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
conviction and sentence on the ground that the charge was pled in
 
the disjunctive. 
Because we are vacating the ICA’s judgment on other
 
grounds, we need not reach the issue of whether Lockey’s untimely
 objection was waived.
 
Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s April 8, 2013 Judgment
 
on Appeal and affirm the family court’s September 28, 2011
 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence.
