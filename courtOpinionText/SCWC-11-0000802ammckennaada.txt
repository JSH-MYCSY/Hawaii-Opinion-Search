AMENDED OPINION OF THE COURT BY MCKENNA, J.
 
I. Introduction
 
The sole issue before this court is whether a sentencing
 
court has the discretion to sentence a defendant convicted of
 
violating Hawai
‘i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 712-1240.8 (1993 &  
   
   
    
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Supp. 2006) (Methamphetamine Trafficking in the Second Degree)1
 
under HRS § 706-667 (1993 & Supp. 2006) (the “Young Adult
 
Defendants” statute).2 Specifically, the issue is whether the
 
1 That statute currently states, as it did at the time of the alleged
 
offense, the following:
(1) A person commits the offense of methamphetamine
trafficking in the second degree if the person knowingly
distributes methamphetamine in any amount.
(2) Methamphetamine trafficking in the second degree is a
class B felony for which the defendant shall be sentenced as
provided in subsection (3).
(3) Notwithstanding sections 706-620, 706-640, 706-641, 706­660, 706-669, and any other law to the contrary, a person
convicted of methamphetamine trafficking in the second
degree shall be sentenced to an indeterminate term of
imprisonment of ten years with a mandatory minimum term of
imprisonment of not less than one year and not greater than
four years and a fine not to exceed $10,000,000; provided
that:
 
(a)  If the person has one prior conviction for
methamphetamine trafficking pursuant to this section or
section 712-1240.7, the mandatory minimum term of
imprisonment shall be not less than three years, four months
and not greater than six years, eight months;
(b) If the person has two prior convictions for
methamphetamine trafficking pursuant to this section or
section 712-1240.7, the mandatory minimum term of
imprisonment shall be not less than six years, eight months
and not greater than ten years; or
(c) If the person has three or more prior convictions for 
methamphetamine trafficking pursuant to this section or section 
712-1240.7, the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment shall be 
ten years.
 
2
 That statute currently states, as it did at the time of the alleged
 
offense, the following:
(1) Defined.  A young adult defendant is a person convicted
of a crime who, at the time of the offense, is less than
twenty-two years of age and who has not been previously
convicted of a felony as an adult or adjudicated as a
juvenile for an offense that would have constituted a felony
had the young adult defendant been an adult.
(2) Specialized correctional treatment. A young adult
defendant who is sentenced to a term of imprisonment
exceeding thirty days may be committed by the court to the
custody of the department of public safety and shall
receive, as far as practicable, such special and
individualized correctional and rehabilitative treatment as
 may be appropriate to the young adult defendant’s needs.
(3) Special term. A young adult defendant convicted of a
felony, in lieu of any other sentence of imprisonment
authorized by this chapter, may be sentenced to a special

phrase “Notwithstanding sections 706-620, 706-640, 706-641, 706­
660, 706-669, and any other law to the contrary,” found in the
 sentencing provision of HRS § 712-1240.8, overrides sentencing
 under HRS § 706-667 as “contrary.” We hold that it does not. 
Therefore, we reverse the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal, and affirm
 the circuit court’s Judgment of Conviction and Sentence and Order
 Denying Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence.
 
II. Background
 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellee Rubin Ikoa Casugay-Badiang
 
(“Casugay-Badiang”) pled guilty to two counts of Methamphetamine
 
Trafficking in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS § 712­
1240.8.   At Casugay-Badiang’s sentencing hearing, both the
 
prosecution and defense requested a minimum sentence of one year
 
in prison, presumably under HRS § 712-1240.8(3), because Casugay-
Badiang had no prior criminal record. 
indeterminate term of imprisonment if the court is of the
opinion that such special term is adequate for the young
adult defendant’s correction and rehabilitation and will not
 jeopardize the protection of the public.  When ordering a
special indeterminate term of imprisonment, the court shall
impose the maximum length of imprisonment, which shall be
eight years for a class A felony, five years for a class B
felony, and four years for a class C felony.  The minimum
 length of imprisonment shall be set by the Hawaii paroling
authority in accordance with section 706-669. During this
special indeterminate term, the young adult shall be
incarcerated separately from career criminals, when
practicable.
 This section shall not apply to the offenses of murder or attempted murder.

The circuit court,  on the other hand, sua sponte raised the
issue of whether it possessed the discretion to sentence Casugay-
Badiang under HRS § 706-667. 
The circuit court reasoned that it
 
did retain such discretion because HRS § 712-1240.8(3) expressly
 excluded sentencing under HRS §§ 706-620, -640, -641, -660, and ­669, but HRS § 706-667 was not among that list. The circuit
 court recognized that HRS § 712-1240.8(3) included an additional
 phrase “and any other law to the contrary,” following the five
 
enumerated statutes. To the circuit court, however, the fact
 
that HRS § 706-667 was not among the enumerated statutes “still
 
ke[pt HRS §] 706-667 in play.” The circuit court then sentenced
 
Casugay-Badiang to a “concurrent term of imprisonment of five (5)
 
years in Counts I and II, as a young adult defendant (pursuant to
 
§706-667, H.R.S.), with a mandatory minimum of one (1) year.”
 
The State then filed its Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence,
 
in which it argued that the circuit court’s decision to sentence
 Casugay-Badiang under HRS § 706-667 “runs contrary to the law
 imposing sentence upon offenders under HRS § 712-1240.8.” 
At a
 
hearing on the motion, the State rested on its briefing, but
 defense counsel argued that (1) if the legislature intended for
 HRS § 712-1240.8(3) to override HRS § 706-667, then it would have
 included HRS § 706-667 among the five enumerated statutes in HRS
 
The Honorable Glenn J. Kim presided.
 
4
 3  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
§ 712-1240.8(3); and (2) if the legislature intended HRS § 706­
667 not to apply to methamphetamine trafficking, then it would
 have amended that statute to include that offense along with
 murder and attempted murder in HRS § 706-667(3). 
The circuit court added that it believed that it could still
 
sentence Casugay-Badiang under HRS § 706-667 because that statute
 “mitigated,” but was not “contrary” to, the sentencing scheme set
 forth in HRS § 712-1240.8(3). The circuit court issued an Order
 Denying Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence. The State timely
 appealed the circuit court’s Judgment of Conviction and Sentence
 and its Order Denying Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence.
 
Before the ICA, the State argued the following:
 
The circuit court abused its discretion in sentencing
[Casugay-Badiang] to five years imprisonment under HRS §
706-667 as a young adult defendant, where HRS § 712­1240.8(3) provides:  Notwithstanding sections 706-620, 706­
640, 706-641, 706-660, 706-669, and any other law to the
contrary, a person convicted of methamphetamine trafficking
in the second degree shall be sentenced to an indeterminate
term of imprisonment of ten years with a mandatory minimum
term of imprisonment of not less than one year and not
greater than four years and a fine not to exceed
$10,000,000[.] 
(Emphasis in original). The State essentially argued that the
 
plain language of HRS § 712-1240.8(3) mandated sentencing under
 that statute. In support of its interpretation, the State
 pointed out that the phrase “notwithstanding any other law to the
 contrary” in a sentencing provision has previously been construed
 by this court, in State v. Dannenberg, 74 Haw. 75, 837 P.2d 776
 
5
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(1992), as limiting the discretion of the trial court to take
 
into account any other statutory sentencing scheme. The State
 further argued that HRS § 706-667 is “contrary” to HRS § 712­1240.8(3), because a five-year indeterminate term under HRS §
 706-667 is “completely different” from a ten-year indeterminate
 
term under HRS § 712-1240.8(3). 
The ICA agreed with the State. It vacated the circuit 
court’s Judgment of Conviction and Sentence and remanded this 
case for re-sentencing under HRS § 712-1240.8. See State v. 
Casugay-Badiang, 128 Hawai‘ i 370, 374, 289 P.3d 1006, 1010 
(2012). It held: 
HRS § 712-1240.8 clearly precludes the applicability of
sentencing as a young adult defendant under HRS §706-667 for
cases involving methamphetamine trafficking in the second
degree because HRS § 706-667 is contrary to HRS § 712­1240.8.  The legislature intended to divest the circuit
court of its discretion to sentence Casugay-Badiang under
any sentencing statute other than HRS § 712-1240.8(3).
 
128 Hawai‘ i at 373, 289 P.3d at 1009. The ICA concluded that the 
circuit court “erred in disregarding the plain language of HRS § 
712-1240.8. . . .” 128 Hawai‘ i at 374, 289 P.3d at 1010. 
III. Discussion
 
On certiorari, Casugay-Badiang argues that the “ICA’s
 
Opinion simply concludes that ‘HRS § 706-667 is contrary to HRS §
 
712-1240.8’ without undertaking a thorough analysis of the
 construction of both statutes.” We now take a closer look at
 both statutes.

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
A. HRS § 712-1240.8
 
HRS § 712-1240.8 provides:
 
Methamphetamine trafficking in the second degree. (1) A
 
person commits the offense of methamphetamine trafficking in
the second degree if the person knowingly distributes
methamphetamine in any amount.
    (2) Methamphetamine trafficking in the second degree is
a class B felony for which the defendant shall be sentenced
as provided in subsection (3).
    (3) Notwithstanding sections 706-620, 706-640, 706-641,
706-660, 706-669, and any other law to the contrary, a
person convicted of methamphetamine trafficking in the
second degree shall be sentenced to an indeterminate term of
imprisonment of ten years with a mandatory minimum term of
imprisonment of not less than one year and not greater than
four years and a fine not to exceed $10,000,000; provided
that:
 
(a) If the person has one prior conviction for
methamphetamine trafficking pursuant to this section or
section 712-1240.7, the mandatory minimum term of
imprisonment shall be not less than three years, four months
and not greater than six years, eight months;
(b) If the person has two prior convictions for
methamphetamine trafficking pursuant to this section or
section 712-1240.7, the mandatory minimum term of
imprisonment shall be not less than six years, eight months
and not greater than ten years; or
(c) If the person has three or more prior convictions for
methamphetamine trafficking pursuant to this section or
section 712-1240.7, the mandatory minimum term of
imprisonment shall be ten years.
 
At issue in this case is whether the circuit court had the
 
discretion to sentence Casugay-Badiang to a special five-year
 indeterminate term of imprisonment under HRS § 706-667 in the
 face of the following language from HRS § 712-1240.8(3): 
Notwithstanding sections 706-620, 706-640, 706-641, 706-660,
706-669, and any other law to the contrary, a person
convicted of methamphetamine trafficking in the second
degree shall be sentenced to an indeterminate term of
imprisonment of ten years with a mandatory minimum term of
imprisonment of not less than one year and not greater than
four years and a fine not to exceed $10,000,000[.]

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
This court’s foremost obligation in construing a statute is
 
“to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the language
 
contained in the statute itself.” State v. Valdivia, 95 Hawai‘ i 
465, 472, 24 P.3d 661, 668 (2001)(citation omitted). “Where the
 
statutory language is unambiguous, the court’s sole duty is to
 give effect to its plain and obvious meaning.” State v.
 
Sakamoto, 101 Hawai‘ i 409, 412, 70 P.3d 635, 638 (2003)(citations 
omitted). 
1. 	A Plain Language Reading of HRS § 712-1240.8(3)
in Favor of the State
 
This court previously interpreted the statutory phrase
 
“notwithstanding any other law to the contrary” as removing a
 
circuit court’s discretion to sentence under any other law. An
 early case interpreting the phrase “any other law to the
 contrary” was State v. Rice, 66 Haw. 101, 657 P.2d 1026 (1983). 
In the context of whether the prostitution statute allowed for
 deferred acceptance of guilty pleas, this court concisely held,
 “[W]e think that § 853-1, HRS, is ‘any other law to the contrary’
 and that the court below therefore correctly construed § 712­1200(4) as taking away its power to grant deferred acceptance of
 guilty pleas in prostitution cases.” 66 Haw. at 102, 657 P.2d at
 1026.
 
8
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In Dannenberg, this court once again held that the trial
 
court abused its discretion in granting a defendant’s motion for
 
a DANC plea to a charge of prostitution under HRS § 712-1200,
 which, at that time, provided in relevant part:
 
Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a person
convicted of committing the offense of prostitution shall be
sentenced as follows:  [for the first offense, a fine or
community service and/or a prison term of not more than 30
days; for a subsequent offense, a fine and a prison term of
30 days, without possibility of suspension of sentence or
probation.]
 
74 Haw. at 77, 79-80, 837 P.2d at 777, 778. The Dannenberg court
 
reaffirmed Rice and clarified its reasoning in that case as
 follows:
 
As Defendant points out, HRS § 712-1200 is ambiguous as to
whether the ‘notwithstanding any other law to the contrary’
refers to HRS ch. 853 (1985 & Supp. 1991) which is the
statutory authority for permitting discretionary deferred
acceptance of guilty pleas and deferred acceptance of nolo
contendere pleas.  Defendant’s argument that the sentencing
provisions of HRS § 712-1200 only apply where defendant is
actually ‘convicted’ and that a DANC is not a conviction is
well-taken.  However, to permit a trial court to defer the
entry of a plea in order to avoid a conviction permits the
court to avoid the sentencing scheme created by the
legislature specifically for prostitution cases and is
therefore repugnant to the legislative intent in enacting
the prostitution law.
 
74 Haw. at 80, 837 P.2d at 778-79. This court then turned to the
 
legislative history of the prostitution statute, which revealed
 that “[t]he intent was clearly to limit the discretion of the
 trial court in sentencing prostitution offenses and to provide a
 mandatory sentencing structure unlike that for other petty
 misdemeanors.” 74 Haw. at 81, 837 P.2d at 779. Thus, this court
 held that DANC’s were not available for prostitution charges,
 
9
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“[s]ince it is clear that the language of the statute anticipates
 
mandatory sentencing for prostitution offenders, and the
 legislative history reveals an intent to remove judicial
 discretion from sentencing[.]” 74 Haw. at 83, 837 P.2d at 779­80.
4 Thus, under Dannenberg, HRS § 712-1240.8(3)’s
 
“notwithstanding any other law to the contrary” phrase indicates
 that the circuit court lacked the discretion to sentence Casugay-
Badiang under any other sentencing scheme not found in HRS § 712­1240.8(3), which would include HRS § 706-667. 
Numerous cases since Dannenberg interpreted the phrase
 
“notwithstanding any other law to the contrary.” In State v.
 
Smith, 103 Hawai‘ i 228, 234, 81 P.3d 408, 414 (2003), we 
synthesized these cases and held that the interpretation of the
 
phrase “notwithstanding any other law to the contrary” has been,
 since Rice, a plain-language interpretation divesting the
 sentencing court of discretion to sentence under any other
 scheme:
 
[T]his court has repeatedly employed a plain-language
analysis in interpreting statutes that contain the phrase,
‘notwithstanding any other law to the contrary. . . .’ See
 
State v. Hamili , 87 Hawai ‘i 102, 105, 952 P.2d 390, 393
(1998)(reaffirming this court’s holding in State v. Rice,infra); State v. Dannenberg, 74 Haw. 75, 80, 837 P.2d 776,
778 (1992)(reaffirming this court’s holding in Rice, infra);State v. Mun Chung Tom, 69 Haw. 602, 604, 752 P.2d 597, 598(1988)(analogizing the language of the driving under theinfluence (DUI) statute to the wording of the prostitution 
4 Dannenberg  was later superseded by statute.  The prostitution statute 
was later amended to expressly allow for probation, and, therefore, DANC
pleas.  See State v. Klie , 116 Hawai ‘i 519, 523, 174 P.3d 358, 362 (2007). 
10
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
statute, infra, and noting that “the language of the DUI
statute [(i.e., a person convicted ‘shall be sentenced as
follows without possibility of probation’)] is sufficiently
clear in mandating the sentence to be imposed”); State v.
Rice, 66 Haw. 101, 657 P.2d 1026 (1983) (holding that, where
the prostitution statute provides “notwithstanding any other
law to the contrary, a person convicted of committing the
offense of prostitution shall be sentenced as follows[,]”
the phrase “‘any other law to the contrary’ . . . takes away
[the trial court’s] power to grant deferred acceptance of
guilty pleas in prostitution cases”).  
See also State v. Kamanao, 118 Hawai‘ i 210, 218, 188 P.3d 724, 
732 (2008)(“The express language of HRS § 706-606.5,
 
‘[n]othwithstanding . . . any other law to the contrary . . . [,]
 ‘clearly limits the applicability of HRS § 706-668 in cases
 involving the ‘[s]entencing of repeat offenders.’ HRS § 706-668
 is precisely the type of ‘law to the contrary’ described in HRS §
 706-606.5.”) 
Moreover, within the phrase “notwithstanding any other law
 
to the contrary,” a plain language, dictionary definition of
 “contrary” is “being opposite to or in conflict with each
 other[.]” Merriam Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 765 (10th Ed.
 
1989)(cited in State v. Schnabel, 127 Hawai‘ i 432, 448, 279 P.3d 
1237, 1253 (2012)). “‘[T]wo statutes conflict’ where ‘[i]t is
 
not possible to give effect to both[.]” Id. (citing State v.
 
Richie, 88 Hawai‘ i 19, 35, 960 P.2d 1227, 1243 (1998)). In 
Casugay-Badiang’s case, HRS § 706-667 is seemingly contrary to
 HRS § 712-1240.8(3) because “[i]t is not possible to give effect
 to both” an indeterminate five-year term of imprisonment under
 
11
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the former statute and an indeterminate ten-year term of
 
imprisonment under the latter. Under Richie, then, and in
 contrast to the circuit court’s reasoning, a sentence under HRS §
 706-667 is not just “mitigating” in relation to HRS § 712­1240.8(3); it is contrary to HRS § 712-1240.8(3). Thus, under
 Richie, HRS § 706-667 would appear to be included in HRS § 712­1240.8(3)’s phrase “notwithstanding . . . any other law to the
 contrary[.]” 
2. 	A Plain Language Reading of HRS § 712-1240.8(3)
in Favor of Casugay-Badiang
 
On the other hand, HRS § 706-667 is not included among the
 
five enumerated statutes in HRS § 712-1240.8(3)’s
 
“notwithstanding” clause, evidencing no express legislative
 intent to exclude it as a sentencing alternative. This court
 previously decided a case in which HRS § 706-667 was considered
 to be a “sentencing alternative” in the face of a sentencing
 statute that excluded “any other law to the contrary.” In State
 v. Lau, 73 Haw. 259, 831 P.2d 523 (1992), a case decided four
 months before Dannenberg, the defendant (“Lau”) was sentenced to
 an indeterminate twenty-year term of imprisonment following a
 class A felony drug conviction for cocaine trafficking. 73 Haw.
 at 260-61, 831 P.2d at 524. 
On appeal, he argued that “the sentencing court committed
 
reversible error by not stating its reasons for imposing a twenty
 
12
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
year sentence . . . [and that] it is unknown if the court
 
considered the alternative eight year sentence under the young
 adult defendants statute for which he was qualified.” 73 Haw. at
 260-61, 831 P.2d at 523-24. This court held:
 
Our review of the record reveals that the sentencing court
had the benefit of a pre-sentence report, the arguments of
counsel, which included references to both the ordinary
twenty year term and the special indeterminate term of eight
years, and appellant’s personal statement.  Thus, we can
reasonably infer that the court did consider the sentencing
alternatives, and we therefore affirm.
 
73 Haw. at 260, 831 P.2d at 524. 
This was so, even though at the time Lau was decided, HRS §
 
706-659 (1985) provided, “Notwithstanding . . . any other law to
 
the contrary, a person who has been convicted of a class A felony
 shall be sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of
 twenty years without possibility of suspension of sentence or
 probation.” (emphasis added). This court stated that the
 sentencing court could sentence Lau under HRS § 706-667, without
 discussing HRS § 706-659’s express “notwithstanding any other law
 to the contrary” language, which is similar to HRS § 712­1240.8(3)’s “notwithstanding” language. 73 Haw. at 260, 831 P.2d
 at 524. In fact, we stated, “Once the court determines that
 imprisonment is necessary, the court ‘is free . . . to choose’
 between the ordinary term or the special indeterminate sentence
 under the young adult defendants statute.” 73 Haw. at 263, 831
 P.2d at 525 (citing HRS § 706-667 commentary). Therefore, Lau is
 
13
  
 5 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
in tension with Dannenberg, as well as Rice, which existed at the
 
time Lau was decided. 
The legislature amended HRS § 706-659 twice since Lau was
 
decided, with neither amendment expressly eliminating HRS § 706­667 as a sentencing alternative, where applicable.
5 See 1994
 
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 229, § 3 at 558; 2012 Haw. Sess. Laws Act
 292, § 4 at 993. Lau’s interpretation of HRS § 706-659 to allow
 
for sentencing under HRS § 706-667 appears to have been untouched
 by the legislature, which is “‘presumed [to] know the law when
 enacting statutes, ‘including this court’s interpretations of
 
statutory language.” State v. Reis, 115 Hawai‘ i 79, 97, 165 P.3d 
980, 998 (2007); Terr. v. Ota, 36 Haw. 80, 98-99 (1942)(“While .
 
. . legislative inaction does not amount to legislative
 construction, it does indicate a lack of active disagreement with
 [judicial interpretation]. . . [L]egislative inaction tends to
 indicate agreement.”)
 
In addition, even if HRS § 706-667 is “contrary” to HRS §
 
712-1240.8(3)’s sentencing scheme, the following rules of
 statutory interpretation would favor Casugay-Badiang’s position:
 
Also of note, the legislature included the “notwithstanding” clause when
 
it enacted HRS § 706-659 in 1980.  1980 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 293, § 1 at 562­
63. HRS § 706-667 existed at that time, having been enacted in 1972. See
 
1972 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 9, § 1 at 81-82.  HRS § 706-667 was not included
among the other statutes in the “notwithstanding clause” of HRS § 706-659. 
1980 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 293, § 1 at 562-63.  Also in 1980, the legislature
amended HRS § 706-667 but did not reference or exclude HRS § 706-659 from HRS
§ 706-667.  1980 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 295, §§ 2, 3 at 563.  Therefore, young
adult defendant sentencing appears to be generally available for class A
felony convictions, and has been since the time HRS § 706-659 was enacted.

First, legislative enactments are presumptively valid and
“should be interpreted [in such a manner as] to give them
effect.” Second, “laws in pari materia, or upon the same
subject matter, shall be construed with reference to each
other.  What is clear in one statute may be called in aid to
explain what is doubtful in another.”  Third, “where there
is a ‘plainly irreconcilable’ conflict between a general and
a specific statute concerning the same subject matter, the
specific will be favored.  However, where the statutes
simply overlap in their application, effect will be given to
both if possible, as repeal by implication is disfavored.”
 
Richardson v. City & County of Honolulu, 76 Haw. 46, 54-55, 868
 
P.2d 1193, 1201-02 (1994)(citations omitted).
 
This court has already considered HRS § 706-667 to be a
 
specific statute, “involv[ing] specialized treatment for a
 limited group of defendants,” as compared to other statutes that
 
refer to “any sentence.” State v. Putnam, 93 Hawai‘ i 362, 371, 3 
P.3d 1239, 1248 (2000). Thus, in comparing statutes concerning
 
the subject matter of sentencing, Putnam observed that “HRS §
 706-667 is to be favored and would control,” were the defendant
 in that case age-eligible for young adult defendant sentencing,
 which she was not. Id.
 
B. HRS § 706-667
 
We now turn to an examination of HRS § 706-667, which
 
provides:
 
Young adult defendants. (1) Defined.  A young adult
defendant is a person convicted of a crime who, at the time
of the offense, is less than twenty-two years of age and who
has not been previously convicted of a felony as an adult or
adjudicated as a juvenile for an offense that would have
constituted a felony had the young adult defendant been an
adult.
    (2) Specialized correctional treatment. A young adult
defendant who is sentenced to a term of imprisonment
 
15
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
exceeding thirty days may be committed by the court to the
custody of the department of public safety and shall
receive, as far as practicable, such special and
individualized correctional and rehabilitative treatment as
 may be appropriate to the young adult defendant's needs.
    (3) Special term. A young adult defendant convicted of a
felony, in lieu of any other sentence of imprisonment
authorized by this chapter, may be sentenced to a special
indeterminate term of imprisonment if the court is of the
opinion that such special term is adequate for the young
adult defendant’s correction and rehabilitation and will not
 jeopardize the protection of the public. When ordering a
special indeterminate term of imprisonment, the court shall
impose the maximum length of imprisonment, which shall be
eight years for a class A felony, five years for a class B
felony, and four years for a class C felony.  The minimum
 length of imprisonment shall be set by the Hawaii paroling
authority in accordance with section 706-669. During this
special indeterminate term, the young adult shall be
incarcerated separately from career criminals, when
practicable.
    This section shall not apply to the offenses of murder
or attempted murder.
 
1. 	A Plain Language Reading of HRS § 706-667 in
Favor of the State
 
In the face of HRS § 712-1240.8(3)’s “notwithstanding . . .
 
any other law to the contrary” language, the permissive “may be
 
sentenced” in HRS § 706-667 seemingly lacks the force necessary
 to demonstrate that sentencing under HRS § 706-667 overrides
 sentencing under HRS § 712-1240.8(3). When HRS §§ 706-667 and
 712-1240.8(3) are read together, the “notwithstanding . . . any
 other law to the contrary” language indicates that a special
 five-year indeterminate term of imprisonment under HRS § 706-667
 is contrary to a ten-year indeterminate term of imprisonment
 under HRS § 712-1240.8(3).
 
As the United States Supreme Court has observed, “[I]n
 
construing statutes, the use of such a ‘notwithstanding’ clause
 
16
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
clearly signals the drafter’s intention that the provisions of
 
the ‘notwithstanding’ section override conflicting provisions of
 any other section. Likewise, the Courts of Appeals generally
 have ‘interpreted similar “notwithstanding” language . . . to
 supersede all other laws, stating that “[a] clearer statement is
 difficult to imagine.”’” Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group, 508
 
U.S. 10, 18, (1993)(citations omitted). 
2. 	A Plain Language Reading of HRS § 706-667 in
Favor of Casugay-Badiang 
On the other hand, the plain language of HRS § 706-667 also
 
states, “A young adult defendant convicted of a felony, in lieu
 
of any other sentence of imprisonment authorized by this chapter,
 may be sentenced to a special indeterminate term of
 imprisonment.” All sentences for all offenses are governed by
 “this chapter,” meaning Chapter 706.
6 See HRS § 706-600
 
(1993)(“No sentence shall be imposed otherwise than in accordance
 with this chapter.”); HRS § 706-660 cmt. (1993)(“This section
 establishes that dispositions for all offenses – whether defined
 within or outside the Penal Code – are to be imposed in
 accordance with this chapter and . . . ‘the only dispositions
 authorized are those permitted by the Code.’”). 
In addition, facially, the only limit on the application of
 
We therefore reject the State’s argument that HRS § 706-667 does not
 
apply to HRS § 712-1240.8 simply because HRS § 712-1240.8 is not found within
Chapter 706.
 
17
 6 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
HRS § 706-667 as a sentencing option appears in subsection (3): 
“This section shall not apply to the offenses of murder and
 attempted murder.” Methamphetamine Trafficking in the Second
 Degree is not included among these offenses.
 
This court previously construed the limitation found in
 
subsection (3) in favor of young adult defendants. In State v.
 Pacariem, 67 Haw. 46, 47, 677 P.2d 463, 464 (1984), we faced the
 issue of whether young adult defendant sentencing was available
 following a conviction for attempted murder. At the time, HRS §
 706-667 expressly stated that murder was the only offense for
 which young adult defendant sentencing was unavailable. 67 Haw.
 at 47 n.1, 677 P.2d 463 n.1. 
The State appealed the defendant’s young adult defendant
 
sentence, arguing that the sentencing court should have sentenced
 the defendant under the more recently passed HRS § 707-660.1,
 which mandated a sentence of life imprisonment (with or without
 parole, depending upon the circumstances of the attempted
 murder). 67 Haw. at 47-48, 677 P.2d at 464. The State argued
 that the legislature intended to repeal HRS § 706-667 by
 implication, as to sentencing for the offense of attempted
 murder, as evidenced in the Commentary to HRS § 707-660.1, which
 stated that the “sentences for attempted murder . . . would be
 similar to those provided for murder,” because “in either offense
 
18
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the intent to kill was the same.” 67 Haw. at 47 n.2, 48, 677
 
P.2d at 463 n.2, 464. The State argued that, when a general and
 specific statute pertain to the same subject matter, the specific
 statute (which it argued was HRS § 707-660.1) should supersede
 and be deemed an exception to the general statute (which it
 argued was HRS § 706-667). Id. 
We rejected the State’s argument, noting that that rule of
 
statutory construction was “qualified by the proviso that the
 conflict between the general and specific statutes in question be
 ‘plainly irreconcilable.’” Id. (citation omitted). Further, we
 
held:
 
H.R.S. § 706-667 specifically provides that it is not
applicable to the offense of murder.  It also provides that
the sentencing court has the discretion to apply H.R.S. §
706-667 “. . . in lieu of any other sentence of imprisonment
authorized by this chapter.”  These two provisions of H.R.S.
§ 706-667 are not plainly irreconcilable with H.R.S. § 706­660.1, but rather invest the sentencing court with
discretion to apply H.R.S. § 706-667 to a young adult
defendant, as long as the offense in question is not murder.
 
67 Haw. at 48, 677 P.2d at 464-65. We then held that repeals by
 
implication are disfavored, and “that if effect can reasonably be
 given to two statutes, it is proper to presume that the earlier
 statute is intended to remain in force and that the later statute
 did not repeal it.” Id.
 
Similarly, in the instant appeal, the State’s argument that
 
HRS § 706-667 sentencing is no longer available under HRS § 712­1240.8 could be construed as an argument that HRS § 712-1240.8
 
19
  7 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
repealed, by implication, young adult defendant sentencing as to
 
the offense of Methamphetamine Trafficking in the Second Degree. 
Following the logic of Pacariem, however, it can be argued that
 the sentencing court remained invested with discretion to
 sentence Casugay-Badiang under HRS § 706-667 in lieu of any other
 sentence of imprisonment, specifically the sentence set forth
 under HRS § 712-1240.8 for Methamphetamine Trafficking in the
 Second Degree, as the only offenses for which young adult
 sentencing are not available remain murder and attempted murder. 
Therefore, HRS § 712-1240.8, even with its “notwithstanding”
 language, did not repeal by implication the sentencing
 alternative available under HRS § 706-667.
7
 
C. Legislative History of Act 230 of 2006
 
In light of these two competing and equally viable plain
 
language readings of HRS §§ 712-1240.8 and 706-667, legislative
 history may be a helpful aid in understanding whether HRS § 712­1240.8 overrides HRS § 706-667, or whether HRS § 706-667 remains
 a sentencing alternative. The legislature addressed both
 
In 1986, the legislature amended HRS § 706-667 to expressly include
 
attempted murder as an offense for which young adult sentencing is not
available.  1986 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 314, § 44 at 614.   Although the
legislature did not discuss Pacariem, it can be surmised that the amendment
was made in response to Pacariem. See Ota, 36 Haw. at 98-99 (“It is a common
practice of legislative bodies to enact laws to circumvent judicial
constructions deemed by the legislators to be contrary to the true meaning of
the statute construed.”).
 
20
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
statutes in the same Act. See 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 230, at
 
996-1025. Therefore, the actions the legislature took (or did
 
not take) in clarifying the relationship between these two
 statutes in Act 230 is worth examining. 
Act 230 enacted HRS § 712-1240.8 after repealing an earlier
 
version of the methamphetamine trafficking statute, HRS § 712­1240.6. 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 230, § 4 at 998-99 (enacting
 Chapter 712, part IV); 1024 (repealing HRS § 712-1240.6). 
Simultaneously, Act 230 also amended HRS § 706-667 to provide for
 the availability of young adult defendant sentencing for persons
 less than twenty-two years of age at the “time of the offense”
 rather than at the “time of sentencing.” 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws
 Act 230, § 25 at 1013. Although both HRS §§ 712-1240.8 and 706­667 were dealt with in the same Act, the legislature made no
 apparent effort to cross-reference one to the other. Two
 conclusions might be drawn from the legislature’s inaction: one
 that supports the State’s argument that HRS § 706-667 is not a
 sentencing alternative following a conviction under HRS § 712­1240.8, and one that supports Casugay-Badiang’s argument that it
 is. 
1. Analysis of Act 230 in Favor of the State
 
Act 230 was an omnibus crime bill, and neither HRS § 706-667
 
nor HRS § 712-1240.8 (nor the interaction between these two
 
21
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
statutes) was debated or discussed in the Standing Committee 
Reports, Conference Committee Reports, or on the House or Senate floor. This was probably because the bill that became Act 230 was the result of the work of the Committee to Conduct a 
Comprehensive Review of the Hawai‘ i Penal Code, a committee 
created by Act 125 of the 2005 Legislative Session which 
submitted a Report to the Legislature proposing the addition of seven new statutory sections, amendments to 46 existing statutory sections, and the repeal of one statutory section-- proposals the Legislature largely adopted without discussion. Compare 2006 
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 230 at 996-1025 with Report of the Committee 
to Conduct a Comprehensive Review of the Hawai‘ i Penal Code 
(“Report”) at 11-57 (2005). Hence, the legislature’s failure to 
expressly cross-reference HRS § 706-667 with HRS § 712-1240.8 does not necessarily reflect a deliberate intent to retain HRS § 706-667 as a sentencing alternative to HRS § 712-1240.8(3). If anything, such cross-reference was unnecessary, given the legislature’s drafting of HRS § 712-1240.8(3) to exclude “any other law to the contrary,” with young adult defendant five-year indeterminate term sentencing contrary to the ten-year indeterminate term called for in HRS § 712-1240.8(3). See 
Cisneros, 508 U.S. at 18 (“[T]he use of such a ‘notwithstanding’ clause clearly signals the drafter’s intention that the 
22
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
provisions of the ‘notwithstanding’ section override conflicting
 
provisions of any other section. . . A clearer statement is
 difficult to imagine.”)(citation omitted). 
Moreover, the Committee that drafted the legislative
 
proposals that eventually became Act 230 identified crystal
 methamphetamine abuse as “the dominant issue in the criminal
 justice system,” affecting “most criminal cases” and “most of the
 defendants who are sent to prison.” Report at 5. Thus, to the
 Committee, the problem of methamphetamine in general was of
 primary concern. 
2. Analysis of Act 230 in Favor of Casugay-Badiang
 
Nevertheless, the legislature’s amendment to HRS § 706-667
 
in 2006 to set the defendant’s eligibility date for young adult
 defendant sentencing as the “time of the offense,” versus the
 “time of sentencing” also indicates the legislature’s intent to
 increase a sentencing court’s discretion to apply HRS § 706-667
 by increasing the pool of defendants eligible for young adult
 sentencing. There is no legislative discussion of the amendment
 to HRS § 706-667. The Report, however, explains that the change
 was intended to prevent the unfairness that resulted when the
 would-be young adult defendant aged out of eligibility for
 sentencing under HRS § 706-667 simply based on when the
 sentencing court scheduled his or her sentencing hearing. See
 
23
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Report at 27r. Thus, the increased sentencing discretion added
 
to HRS § 706-667 contradicts any purported legislative intent to
 simultaneously decrease sentencing discretion via the enactment
 of HRS § 712-1240.8. This is particularly true where the
 legislature did not include Methamphetamine Trafficking in the
 Second Degree among the other offenses for which young adult
 defendant sentencing is unavailable. See HRS § 706-667(3)(“This
 
section shall not apply to the offenses of murder or attempted
 murder.”). 
The legislature could have cross-referenced HRS §§ 706-667
 
and 712-1240.8, if it had so intended, in Act 230. Tellingly,
 Act 230 also amended another statute, HRS § 706-622.5, to
 expressly exclude HRS § 712-1240.8. 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act
 230, § 18 at 1009. HRS § 706-622.5 states, in relevant part,
 with emphasis added, “Notwithstanding section 706-620(3), a
 person convicted for the first or second time for . . . any
 felony offense under part IV of chapter 712 . . . [but] not
 including any methamphetamine trafficking offenses under sections
 712-1240.7 and 712-1240.8, is eligible to be sentenced to
 probation . . . .” Thus, if the legislature intended to exclude
 Methamphetamine Trafficking from HRS § 706-667, it could have
 done so, as it did with HRS § 706-622.5, but it did not. 
24
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
D. Policy Considerations
 
Given the difficulties in divining the legislative intent
 
behind Act 230, an examination of the legislature’s stated
 
policies behind HRS §§ 706-667 and 712-1240.8 may provide needed
 guidance. Both statutes were chosen for unique treatment by our
 legislature. Both statutes are undergirded by powerful policy
 considerations.
 
1. 	Policy Considerations behind Hawai‘ i’s Carve-Out 
for Methamphetamine Trafficking 
On one hand, the legislature has singled out methamphetamine
 
trafficking as requiring sentencing separate from the general
 
sentencing provisions found in Chapter 706. The legislature
 
first carved out methamphetamine trafficking for separate
 
sentencing in 2004 when it passed Act 44. 2004 Haw. Sess. Laws
 Act 44, § 3 at 204-27; see also H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 495-04,
 in 2004 House Journal, at 1604 (“Amending the new offense of
 unlawful methamphetamine trafficking to . . . . [s]pecify that
 other statutes relating to sentencing do not apply to the offense
 of methamphetamine trafficking[.]”). Act 44 resulted in the
 codification of HRS § 712-1240.6, which set classes of
 methamphetamine trafficking offenses according to the weight of
 methamphetamine, and set mandatory prison terms and fines
 according to the class of offense. HRS § 712-1240.6 (Supp.
 2004). 
25
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The new carve-out was pursuant to the legislature’s finding
 
“that new and enhanced criminal penalties are needed to protect
 
[Hawai‘i’s] citizens from the effects of the ice epidemic.” 2004 
Haw. Sess. Laws at 205. The legislature stated that “the use of
 
and addiction to crystal methamphetamine (especially in the form
 known as ‘ice’) . . . has reached epidemic proportions and is
 currently considered a public health crisis. 2004 Haw. Sess.
 Laws at 204. HRS § 712-1240.6 was repealed in 2006 and replaced
 with our current methamphetamine trafficking statutes, HRS
 Chapter 712, Part IV. 
2. 	Policy Considerations behind Hawai
‘i’s Young Adult
Defendant Sentencing 
On the other hand, the legislature has also singled out
 
young adult defendants for specialized sentencing due to their
 immaturity and potential for rehabilitation. HRS § 706-667 is
 based on the Model Penal Code, Tentative Draft 7. 
Putnam, 93
 
Hawai‘i at 369, 3 P.3d at 1246 (“HRS § 706-667 is based on the 
Young Adult Offender statute, Section 6.05 of the Model Penal
 Code, and is in relevant part similarly worded.”). The
 Commentary to HRS § 706-667 contains a cross-reference to the
 Model Penal Code, Tentative Draft No. 7, comments at 24, which
 explains the general policy behind young adult sentencing as
 follows:
 
26
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
[T]he incidence of criminality and of recidivism in this age
span is distressingly and disproportionately high; that
these are still, however, formative years in personal
development; and that these individuals involved have many
years of active life ahead.  Prudence and humanity combine,
therefore, to argue for a specialized and concentrated
effort in this area.
 
Model Penal Code, Tentative Draft No. 7, comments at 24 (1957);
 
Putnam, 93 Hawai‘ i at 369-70, 3 P.3d at 1246-47 (citing to the 
Model Penal Code, Tentative Draft No. 7); see also Model Penal
 
Code Part I Commentaries, vol. 3 at 75 (1985)(finalizing draft
 comments similarly). 
The Commentary to HRS § 706-667 also explains the philosophy
 
behind discretionary sentencing and special terms of imprisonment
 for young adult defendants:
 
[T]he Code adopts a flexible approach in sentencing. The
court is not compelled to impose a special term in the case
of a convicted young adult.  It may, according to the
provisions of Part II of this Chapter, suspend the
imposition of sentence or sentence the defendant to
probation. If the court determines that imprisonment is
necessary, the court is free, within the limitations
heretofore set forth, to choose between the special term
authorized by this section and the ordinary and extended
terms authorized by prior sections in this Part. Subsection
(3) merely authorizes the employment of a special, more
limited term of imprisonment “if the court is of the opinion
that such special term is adequate for... [the defendant’s]
correction and rehabilitation and will not jeopardize the
protection of the public.” Assuming the court is satisfied
that this condition can be met, there seems no reason for
not allowing the court, if it chooses, to protect the young
offender from the longer maxima provided for felonies.
 
HRS § 706-667 cmt. (1993 & Supp. 2006)(emphasis added). Other
 
passages in the Model Penal Code, Tentative Draft 7, illuminate
 further policy reasons behind specialized young adult sentencing. 
For example, as to why youthful offenders should receive a
 
27
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
shorter term of imprisonment than ordinary offenders, the
 
American Law Institute reasoned as follows:
 
We recognize the theory . . . that . . . a longer term is
more reformative than a short, definite sentence to jail. 
This is a case, however, where we think that theory has
outrun a sense of just proportion.  Simple regard for
personal liberty – of young no less than of mature adults –
requires, in our view, that younger people not be subject to
more onerous sentences because of their immaturity.  We can
 perceive no adequate basis for sentencing young adults,
whose offenses reveal no substantial danger to the
community, to sentences as long as those imposed for major
crimes.
 
Model Penal Code, Tentative Draft 7, comments at 28.
 
IV. Conclusion
 
There are strong arguments both for and against retaining
 
discretion to sentence under HRS § 706-667 following a conviction
 
under HRS § 712-1240.8. As analyzed above, however, there exists
 enough ambiguity in the language of both statutes, their
 relationship to each other, and the legislature’s actions (and
 inaction) with regard to each that the rule of lenity applies in
 this case. “[W]here a criminal statute is ambiguous, it is to be
 interpreted according to the rule of lenity. Under the rule of
 lenity, the statute must be strictly construed against the
 government and in favor of the accused.” State v. Bayly, 118
 
Hawai‘i 1, 15, 185 P.3d 186, 200 (2008)(citation omitted). 
In addition, based on the totality of the circumstances, it
 
appears the legislature considers HRS § 706-667 a separate and
 unique sentencing overlay to all other indeterminate term
 
28
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
sentencing statutes (except murder and attempted murder) such
 
that HRS § 706-667 would not be “contrary” to HRS § 712­1240.8(3).
8 First, the plain language of HRS § 712-1240.8 does
 
not enumerate HRS § 706-667 among the other five statutes
 excluded from consideration in sentencing for Methamphetamine
 Trafficking in the Second Degree. HRS § 712-1240.8(3). Further,
 the catch-all phrase “notwithstanding any other law to the
 contrary,” under Lau, has not been interpreted to limit the
 availability of young adult sentencing. Lau, 73 Haw. at 263, 831
 
P.2d at 525. Even if HRS § 706-667 could be viewed as
 conflicting with HRS § 712-1240.8(3)’s sentencing provisions, we
 have already held that the young adult defendant sentencing
 statute, as the more specific statute, “is to be favored and
 would control,” over other general sentencing statutes like HRS §
 
712-1240.8(3). Putnam, 93 Hawai‘ i at 371, 3 P.3d at 1248. 
Second, young adult defendant sentencing is “in lieu of any
 
other sentence of imprisonment” for any other offense except
 
murder and attempted murder. HRS § 706-667(3). Under Pacariem,
 the limitation set forth in HRS § 706-667(3) is restrictively
 viewed. Pacariem, 67 Haw. at 48, 677 P.2d at 464-65. 
Methamphetamine Trafficking in the Second Degree is not listed
 
If the legislature disagrees with our interpretation of HRS § 706-667,
 
as it apparently did following Pacariem, it has the power to amend HRS § 706­
667 (and/or HRS § 712-1240.8) to clarify that young adult defendant sentencing
is not available following a conviction for Methamphetamine Trafficking in the
Second Degree. 
29
 8   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
along with murder and attempted murder, indicating that the court
 
retains discretion to sentence under HRS § 706-667 following a
 conviction under HRS § 712-1240.8. 
Third, when the legislature simultaneously amended HRS §
 
706-667 and enacted HRS § 712-1240.8 in 2006, it did not cross-
reference those statutes with each other to indicate that young
 adult sentencing was not available following a conviction under
 HRS § 712-1240.8. 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 230, §§ 4, 25 at 998­99, 1013. Through that same act, the legislature demonstrated
 its ability to so cross-reference when it excluded HRS § 712­1240.8 from HRS § 706-622.5. 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 230, § 18
 at 1008. Therefore, it appears that the legislature did not
 intend to exclude HRS § 706-667 as a sentencing alternative to
 HRS § 712-1240.8(3).
 
Fourth, the policy considerations behind HRS § 706-667
 
indicate that young adult defendants are intended to be spared 
from the same sentences imposed on adults for major crimes like
 methamphetamine trafficking. Model Penal Code, Tentative Draft
 7, comments at 28.
 
As such, we hold that the sentencing court did retain
 
discretion to sentence Casugay-Badiang under HRS § 706-667. 
Accordingly, the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal is reversed. The
 
30
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
circuit court’s Judgment of Conviction and Sentence and Order
 
Denying Motion to Correct Illegal Sentence are affirmed.
