CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

JUNE 19, 2013
 
RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, ACOBA, MCKENNA, AND POLLACK, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY ACOBA, J.
 
We hold that under State v. Tachibana, 79 Hawai
'i 226, 
900 P.2d 1293 (1995) and State v. Lewis, 94 Hawai' i 292, 12 P.3d 
1233 (2000), a colloquy between the judge and a defendant 
involves a verbal exchange in which the judge ascertains the defendant’s understanding of the defendant’s rights. In this case, the advisement by the Family Court of the First Circuit (the court) did not adequately ascertain whether Petitioner/ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Defendant-Appellant Chong Hung Han (Petitioner) understood his
 
Constitutional right to testify or not to testify. Further,
 Petitioner’s need for an interpreter during the trial was a
 “salient fact” heightening the necessity for the court to insure
 that Petitioner understood the rights that he waived. See State
 
v. Barros, 105 Hawai' i 160, 170, 95 P.3d 14, 24 (App. 2004). 
Under the circumstances, the error in this case was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we vacate the October 30, 2012 judgment of the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) filed pursuant to its September 12, 2012 Summary Disposition Order (2012), vacate the court’s October 13, 2011 Amended Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, and remand the case to the court. 
I. 
On January 26, 2010, Petitioner was charged, via
 
complaint, with the offense of Abuse of Family and Household
 Members, HRS § 709-906 (Supp. 2006).
1 The Complaint alleged that
 
on January 17, 2010, Petitioner “did intentionally, knowingly, or
 
1 HRS § 709-906 provides, in relevant part:
 
(1) It shall be unlawful for any person, singly or in
concert, to physically abuse a family or household
member or to refuse compliance with the lawful order
of a police officer under subsection (4).  The police,
in investigating any complaint of abuse of a family or
household member, upon request, may transport the
abused person to a hospital or safe shelter.
 
For the purposes of this section, “family or household
member” means spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries,
former spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries, persons
who have a child in common, parents, children; persons
related by consanguinity, and persons jointly residing
or formerly residing in the same dwelling unit.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
recklessly physically abuse [his wife,] Kyung Soon Jung
 
[(complainant)], a family or household member[.]” A jury trial
 was held over the course of three days, from January 19 to
 January 21, 2011. Prior to jury selection and trial, a Korean
 language interpreter was sworn in before the court to translate
 the proceedings for Petitioner. 

On the first day of trial 2, the following exchange took
place between the court and Petitioner:
 
THE COURT:  Counsel, before we recess for the day, the court
would like to, at this point, advise the defendant of -- of [State
v.] Tachibana[, 79 Hawai 'i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995),] before we ­
- before we recess for the day, okay.
All right, [Petitioner], good afternoon -- good afternoon
again.  The cou
rt, at this point, will take this opportunity to
advise you of your r
ights.
Okay.  All right.  [Petitioner], you have a constitutional
right to testif
y in your own defense.  You should consult with
 
your lawyer regarding the decision to testify.  However, it is
ultimately your decision, and no one can prevent you from
testifying should you choose to do so.  If you decide to testify,
the prosecutor will be allowed to cross-examine you based on your
direct testimony.
You also have a constitutional right not to testify and to
remain silent.  If you choose not to testify, the jury will be
instructed that it cannot hold your silence against you in
deciding your case.
If you have not testified by the end of the trial, I will
question you to ensure that it was your decision not to testify.
Do you have any questions about what I just explained?
[PETITIONER]:  (No audible response)
 THE COURT:  Okay, thank you very much.
 
(Emphases added.)
 
On the final day of trial, January 21, 2011, Petitioner
 
informed the court that the “[d]efense is going to rest.” The
 
following exchange immediately took place:
 
THE COURT:  Oh, okay.  All right.  And so let me take
 
this oppor
tunity, then, to question your client again and -­
before we bring in our jury.
All right, [Petitioner], good morning.  Your attorney
 
2
 The Honorable Fa 'auuga L. To 'oto'o presided. 
3
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
just informed the court that you are not going to testify on
your behalf.
[PETITIONER]:  (Through the interpreter) Yes.
 THE COURT: 
  Okay.  All right, remember in the beginning -­
beginning of our trial, this court advised you of your rights. 
And that is, one, you have the right to testify on your behalf,
and that -- that decision to testify -- whether to testify or not
is your decision alone and that nobody can force you to testify. 
And then, of course, second, you also have the constitutional
right to remain silent and that if you decide to exercise your
right to remain silent, the jury will be instruct -- will be
instructed not 
to hold that against you.
Okay.  And -- and I trust that you have -- now that the
State has 
finished its case and you had a chance to discuss what
happened with your attorney, and based on that discussion, you
have decided that you are not going to testify on your behalf.  Is
 anybody threatening or forcing you this morning not to testify?
[PETITIONER]:  (Through the interpreter) No.
 THE COURT:
  The decision not to testify is yours and yours
alone after you have discussed the matter with your attorney.
[PETITIONER]:  (Through the interpreter) Yes.
 
(Emphasis added.) The trial concluded, and the jury found
 
Petitioner guilty as charged. Petitioner was sentenced to two
 years probation, fined, and sentenced to serve two days in jail. 
II.
 
Petitioner appealed to the ICA. On appeal, Petitioner
 
claimed that his right to testify, as set forth in the Hawai' i 
Constitution and the United States Constitution, was violated
 because the court’s 
Tachibana colloquy was deficient. (Citing
 
Tachibana, 79 Hawai
'i 226, 900 P.2d 1293.) Petitioner argued 
that the court “failed to adequately ascertain whether
 [Petitioner] understood his Tachibana rights.” According to
 Petitioner, the colloquy “significantly differed” from the
 colloquy cited “with approval” by this court in State v.
 Christian, 88 Hawai' i 407, 967, P.2d 238 (1998), in that the 
court did not engage in a dialogue with Petitioner after each
 segment or ensure that Petitioner understood his rights. “Thus,”
 
4
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Petitioner asserted, “[his] waiver of his right to testify was
 
not knowing and voluntary.” 
Petitioner further argued in his Opening Brief that the 
court’s error was not harmless. He cited to State v. Hoang, 94 Hawai'i 271, 12 P.3d 371 (App. 2000), for the proposition that 
“[i]n general, it is inherently difficult, if not impossible, to define what effect a violation of the defendant’s constitutional right to testify had on the outcome of any particular case.” Id. 
at 279, 12 P.3d at 37. As applied to the instant case, Petitioner alleged that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, because, “[i]f [Petitioner] had testified, the decisive issue in the instant case would have been credibility, as his version as to what occurred on the night in question would have conflicted with [his wife’s] version.” “Hence,” Petitioner concluded, ”[Petitioner’s] conviction and sentence must be vacated.” (Citing Hoang, 94 Hawai' i at 279-80, 12 P.3d at 379­
80; Tachibana, 79 Hawai' i at 240, 900 P.2d at 1307.) 
In its Answering Brief to the ICA, Respondent 
maintained that (1) the “court conducted a colloquy with [Petitioner] both before trial commenced and before the defense rested at trial, which is plainly consistent with Tachibana [],” (citing Tachibana, 79 Hawai' i at 240, 900 P.2d at 1307), (2) 
whether the “right to testify is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived requires looking at ‘the totality of [the] facts and circumstances of each particular case[,]’” (citing Christian, 88 Hawai' i at 420, 967 P.2d at 253 (quoting State v. 
5
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Merino, 81 Hawai' i 198, 221, 915 P.2d 672, 695 (1996)(internal 
quotation marks omitted)), and that (3) “Christian did not hold 
that any portion of the colloquy that was conducted in that case should be replicated in all subsequent cases[.]” (Citing Christian, 88 Hawai' i 407, 967 P.2d 239.) 
According to Respondent, “there is nothing in the 
record to indicate that the interpreter had difficulty interpreting the [] court’s colloquy of [Petitioner], or that [Petitioner] was unable to understand any portion of the court’s colloquy with him.” Thus, “by answering either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the questions asked by [the court, Petitioner] [] clearly indicat[ed] through his answers that he understood the questions . . . .” The court “clearly asked [Petitioner] whether he had any questions about the colloquy that the court ‘just explained’ . . . .” “Although the transcript indicates ‘no audible response’ in [Petitioner]’s reply [], it is apparent from [the court’s] subsequent response of, ‘[o]kay, thank you very much,’ that [Petitioner] did not have any questions with regard to the colloquy. . . .” Respondent contends then that “based on the totality of the circumstances, the record in this case clearly envinces that [the court] conducted a colloquy that is consistent with Tachibana, . . . and [Petitioner] knowingly, intentionally, and voluntarily waived his constitutional right to testify.” See 
Merino, 81 Hawai' i at 220, 915 P.2d at 694. Therefore, according 
to Respondent, “there was ‘no occasion to apply the doctrine of 
6
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
harmless error.’” (Citing State v. Lewis, 94 Hawai' i 292, 264, 12 
P.3d 1233, 1235 (2000) at 264, 12 P.3d at 1235.)  
As Petitioner recounts in his Application, the ICA
 
affirmed his conviction, stating the following, inter alia:
 
1. [The court] informed [Petitioner] of his right to testify
or not testify before trial commenced and conducted a brief
colloquy with [Petitioner] before the defense rested at trial, toensure that [Petitioner’s] decision not to testify was his own[,]see Tachibana, 79 Hawai 'i at 237 n.9, 900 P.2d at 1304 n.9. 
2. [Petitioner] argues, however, that [the court’s] end-of­
trial colloquy was inadequate because it was conducted with the
assistance of an interpreter, it was relatively brief, and
[Petitioner’s] responses to the court were simply ‘yes’ or ‘no.’
 
3. [T]here is nothing in the record to indicate, that the
interpreter had any problem interpreting [the court’s] colloquy or
that [Petitioner] did not understand the colloquy . . . .
 
4. [B]ased on the totality of the circumstances, . . .
[Petitioner’s] waiver of his constitutional right to testify was
done knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. 
(Citing State v. Chong Hung Han, No. CAAP-11-0000814, 2012 WL
 
4009906, at *2-3 (App. Sept. 12, 2012)(SDO).)
 
III.
 
In his Application Petitioner maintains that “[t]he ICA
 
gravely erred in holding that [Petitioner] made a knowing,
 intelligent, and voluntary waiver of the right to testify at
 trial because the ICA erroneously concluded that [Petitioner]
 understood his constitutional rights.” Respondent did not file a
 response. 
IV.
 
It is established that “‘[a] defendant’s right to 
testify in his or her own defense is guaranteed by the constitutions of the United States and Hawai' i and by a Hawai 'i 
7
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Statute.[ 3
]’”  Tachibana, 79 Hawai' i at 231, 900 P.2d at 1298 
(quoting State v. Silva, 78 Hawai
'i 115, 122-23, 890 P.2d 702, 
709-10 (App. 1995))(brackets omitted). Three separate amendments 
of the United States Constitution guarantee such a right. Tachibana, 79 Hawai' i at 231, 900 P.2d at 1298. 
“It is guaranteed by the due process clause of the
fourteenth amendment as essential to due process of law in a
fair adversary process. . . 
The right to testify is also guaranteed to state defendants
by the compulsory process clause of the sixth amendment as
applied through the fourteenth amendment. . .
 
Lastly, the opportunity to testify is also a necessary
corollary to the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee against
compelled testimony, since every criminal defendant is
privileged to testify in his [or her] own defense, or to
refuse to do so.”
 
Id. (quoting Silva, 78 Hawai' i at 122-23, 890 P.2d at 709-10). 
The Hawai' i Constitution also guarantees the right to testify in 
the provisions that parallel the fourteenth, fifth, and sixth 
amendments to the United States Constitution. See id.; Haw. 
Const. art. I, §§ 5, 14, and 10. 
In Tachibana, this court first considered what
 
procedures would best protect criminal defendants’ exercise of
 their right to testify. Id. at 233-38, 900 P.2d at 1300-05. 
After reviewing the three primary approaches that other
 jurisdictions had taken in cases where defendants had claimed
 
3
 HRS § 801-2 (1993) states:
 In the trial of any person on the charge of any offense, he
[or she] shall have a right. . . to be heard in his [or her]
own defense. 
8
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
that their attorneys deprived them of their right to testify,4
 
this court concluded that requiring trial courts to conduct an
 
on-the-record discussion with the defendant was the best
 approach. Id. The risk that “‘by advising the defendant of his
 
[or her] right to testify, the court could influence the
 defendant to waive his [or her] right not to
 testify, thus
 
threatening the exercise of this other, converse,
 constitutionally explicit and more fragile right[,]’” was
 recognized. Id. at 235, 900 P.2d at 1303 (quoting United States
 
v. Martinez, 883 F.2d 750, 760 (9th Cir. 1989)) (brackets and
 emphases in original). However, this court also observed that 
“[a]lthough trial judges would be required to advise
defendants who do not testify, the burden would be
relatively minimal.  Indeed, by engaging in the colloquy, a
trial judge would establish a record that would effectively
settle the right-to-testify issues in the case, and thereby
relieve the trial judge of extended post-conviction
proceedings.”
 
Id. (quoting Boyd, 586 A.2d at 679-80) (emphasis added). Thus,
 
it was held that “in order to protect the right to testify under
 the Hawai' i Constitution,[] trial courts must advise criminal 
defendants of their right to testify and must obtain an on-the­
4 The Tachibana court first rejected the “demand rule” which would 
have required that “‘a defendant who fails to complain about the right to
testify during trial is conclusively presumed to have waived that right.’” 79 Hawai'i at 233, 900 P.2d at 1301 (quoting Boyd v. United States, 586 A.2d 670
(D.C.App. 1991)).  The court then decided between the remaining two approaches.  Id. at 234, 900 P.3d at 1301.  One approach was the “colloquy procedure[,]” which it adopted.  79 Hawai 'i at 234, 900 P.2d at 1301.  The 
remaining approach was the post-conviction challenge approach, in which “‘atrial judge need not sua sponte question the defendant during the trial, butthe defendant is free to bring a post-conviction challenge based on a denialof the right to testify.  To prevail in such a challenge, the defendant mustdemonstrate that he or she did not knowingly waive the right to testify attrial.’”  Id. (quoting Boyd, 586 A.2d at 675-677.) 
9
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
record waiver of that right in every case in which the defendant
 
does not testify.” Id. at 1303. 
Tachibana also discussed when such a colloquy must take
 
place, concluding that “the ideal time to conduct the colloquy is
 immediately prior to the close of the defendant’s case.” Id. at
 
237. Further, Tachibana indicated how the colloquy must be
 
conducted. Id. at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7. It stated, 
In conducting the colloquy, the trial court must be careful
not to influence the defendant’s decision whether or not to
 testify and should limit the colloquy to advising the
defendant
 “[(1)] that he or she has a right to testify, [(2)] that if
he or she 
wants to testify that no one can prevent him or
her from doing so, and [(3)] that if he or she testifies the
prosecution will be allowed to cross examine him or her.  In
 connection with the privilege against self-incrimination,
the defendant should also be advised that [(4)] he or she
has a right not to testify and [(5)] that if he or she does
not testify then the jury can be instructed about that
right.” 
 
Id. (quoting State v. Neuman, 179 W.Va. 580, 585 (1988))(brackets
 
and citation omitted). 
This court’s subsequent opinion in Lewis further 
clarified the requirements of when and how a court must conduct the colloquy. 
First, Lewis incorporated the colloquy 
requirements that were set forth in footnote 7 of Tachibana, quoted supra, into the text of the opinion, when it described how a trial court must engage a defendant. Lewis, 94 Hawai' i at 293­
94, 12 P.3d at 1234-35. Second, in recognizing that the Tachibana colloquy was the “product of two objectives: (1) the protection of a defendant’s personal right to testify; and (2) the minimization of post-conviction disputes over the actual waiver of the right to testify[,]” id. at 295, 12 P.3d at 1236, 
10
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Lewis held that a trial court need not engage in a Tachibana
 
colloquy except where the defendant has indicated that he or she
 will not testify. Id. at 296-97, 12 P.3d at 1237-38. This court
 
also stated, however, that “we believe there is a salutary effect
 to be obtained in all cases from a trial court addressing a
 defendant [at the start of trial],” and thus this court held that
 “we now mandate that . . . such advice shall be imparted by the
 trial court to defendants . . . . prior to the start of trial[.]” 
Id. 
Therefore, Lewis (1) reiterated the requirements set
 
out in footnote 7 of Tachibana regarding how the trial court must
 advise the defendant, id. at 294-95, 12 P.3d at 1234-35, (2)
 required that a colloquy regarding defendant’s right to testify
 or not to testify be conducted at the start of trial in all
 cases, id. at 296, 12 P.3d at 1237, and (3) stated that the
 “ultimate colloquy,” the one described in Tachibana, must be
 given in all cases, except where the defendant has indicated that
 he or she does intend to testify, id. at 296, 12 P.3d at 1237. 
V.
 
In the instant case, Petitioner contends that his 
waiver of the constitutional right to testify in his defense was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. This court has held that “to determine whether a waiver [of a fundamental right] was voluntarily and intelligently undertaken, this court will look to the totality of the facts and circumstances of each particular case.” State v. Friedman, 93 Hawai' i 63, 66-67, 996 P.2d 268, 
11
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
273-74 (2000) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); 
see also Christian, 88 Hawai' i at 420, 967 P.2d at 252 (applying 
the “totality of the facts and circumstances” test to determine whether the defendant’s waiver of his right to testify in his own defense was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary). Based on the transcripts of the court’s proceedings in this case, taken as a whole, it appears that the defendant did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his constitutional right to testify. 
VI.
 
In this case, two advisements took place regarding the 
defendant’s right to testify, one before trial began, in accordance with Lewis, 94 Hawai' i at 297, 12 P.3d at 1238, and one 
at the close of the defendant’s case, as required by Tachibana, 79 Hawai' i at 236, 900 P.2d at 1303. With respect to the first 
advisement, Lewis requires that “‘prior to the start of trial,’” the court shall “‘(1) inform the defendant of his or her personal right to testify or not to testify and (2) alert the defendant that, if he or she has not testified by the end of the trial, the court will briefly question him or her to ensure that the decision not to testify is the defendant’s own decision.’” 94 Hawai'i at 297, 12 P.3d at 1238 (quoting Tachibana, 79 Hawai' i at 
237 n.9, 900 P.2d at 1304 n.9). Petitioner challenges the first pre-trial colloquy on the ground that the court did not obtain 
12
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
from the defendant an audible indication that he understood his
 
rights.
 
As indicated supra, before the start of trial, the
 
court advised Petitioner of his “constitutional right to testify
 in his own defense.” To reiterate, at the end of his pre-trial
 advisement, the judge asked Petitioner if he had any questions
 about what the judge had explained, but it was noted on the trial
 transcript that Petitioner’s response was inaudible. 
There is no requirement for this first advisement that 
a court obtain an on-the-record waiver of the defendant’s right to testify. However, Lewis implemented the pre-trial advisement requirement with the intent that it would “have the beneficial effect of limiting any post-conviction claims that a defendant testified in ignorance of his or her right not to testify.” 94 Hawai'i at 297, 12 P.3d 1238. It is thus important that the 
defendant actually have an understanding of what the court articulates in its pre-trial advisement. 
In this case, there was no audible response by
 
Petitioner to the court’s inquiry as to whether Petitioner had
 any questions about the rights that the court explained. 
Contrary to Respondent’s assertion that the court’s “[o]kay,
 thank you very much,” indicates acquiescence on the part of
 Petitioner, it cannot be inferred exactly what was said because
 Petitioner’s response was inaudible. Therefore, even though an
 on-the-record waiver is not required, the fact that it is not
 known whether Petitioner was able to understand the court’s
 
13
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
advisement is problematic inasmuch as appellate review of the
 
adequacy of the advisement is precluded. 
On appeal, the pre-trial advisement is reviewed for 
“actual prejudice.” Lewis, 94 Hawai' i at 297, 12 P.3d at 1238 
(“Because we view this prior-to-trial advisement as incidental to the ‘ultimate colloquy’ [], any claim of prejudice resulting from the failure of the trial court to give it must meet the same ‘actual[] prejudice[]’ standard applied to violations of the colloquy requirement.”) In holding that the failure to properly conduct the Tachibana colloquy was harmful error, infra, the issue of whether Petitioner could demonstrate “actual prejudice” with respect to the pre-trial colloquy need not be addressed here. 
VII. 
Petitioner also challenges the second colloquy, the
 
Tachibana colloquy given at the close of his case, on two
 different grounds. First, he alleges that the court failed to
 adequately ascertain whether Petitioner understood his Tachibana
 rights. Second, he contends that because he needed a Korean
 language interpreter, the court’s failure to inquire into whether
 he understood the advisement was even “more egregious.”
 
Pursuant to Tachibana, this second colloquy is 
considered to be the “ultimate colloquy,” 79 Hawai' i at 237 n.9, 
900 P.2d 1304 n.9, and while Lewis held that this colloquy was not required where the defendant had decided to testify, 94 Hawai'i at 296-97, 12 P.3d at 1237-38, in this case such an 
14
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
exchange was necessary, because Petitioner’s attorney had
 
indicated that Petitioner would not be testifying. In this case,
 to reiterate, the transcript indicates that the following
 exchange took place at the close of Petitioner’s case:
 
THE COURT:  Oh, okay.  All right.  And so let me take
 
this opportunity, then, to question your client again and -­
before we bring in our jury.
All right, [Petitioner], good morning.  Your attorney just
informed the co
urt that you are not going to testify on your
behalf.
 
[PETITIONER]:  (Through the in
terpreter) Yes.
 
THE COURT:   Okay.  All right, remember in the
beginning -- be
ginning of our trial, this court advised you
of your rights.  And that is, one, you have the right to
testify on your behalf, and that -- that decision to testify
-- whether to testify or not is your decision alone and that
nobody can force you to testify.  And then, of course,
second, you also have the constitutional right to remain
silent and that if you decide to exercise your right to
remain silent, the jury will be instruct -- will be
instructed not to hold that against you.
Okay.  And -- and I trust that you have -- now that
the State has finished its case and you had a chance to
discuss what happened with your attorney, and based on that
discussion, you have decided that you are not going to
testify on your behalf.  Is anybody threatening or forcing
you this morning not to testify?
[PETITIONER]:  (Through the interpreter) No.
 
THE COURT: 
 The decision not to testify is yours and yours
alone after you
 have discussed the matter with your attorney.
[PETITIONER]:  (Through the interpreter) Yes.
 
(Emphases added.)
 
A.
 
First, the court failed to ascertain whether Petitioner
 
understood his right to testify. As mentioned, following
 
Tachibana, “in order to protect the right to testify under the
 Hawai
'i Constitution, trial courts must advise criminal defendants 
of their right to testify and must obtain a waiver of that right
 in every case in which the defendant does testify.” 79 Hawai
'i at 
236, 900 P.2d at 1303. Tachibana characterized such an exchange
 
15
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
as a “colloquy.” Id. at 237, 900 P.2d at 1304. “Colloquy” is
 
defined as “[a]ny formal discussion, such as an oral exchange
 
between a judge, the prosecutor, the defense counsel, and a
 criminal defendant in which the judge ascertains the defendant’s
 understanding of the proceedings and of the defendant’s rights.” 
Black’s Law Dictionary 300 (9th ed. 2009) (emphases added). 
In this case, the transcript does not indicate that a
 
true “colloquy” took place. Instead, the court simply advised
 Petitioner of his rights, without any “discussion,” “exchange” or
 ascertainment that Petitioner understood his rights. See id. 
Respectfully, at least twice during the colloquy, the court
 should have engaged in a verbal exchange with Petitioner to
 ascertain Petitioner’s understanding of significant propositions
 in the advisement. 
The first time the court should have requested a
 
response was after it stated, “you also have the constitutional
 right to remain silent, and that if you decide to exercise your
 right to remain silent, the jury . . . will be instructed not to
 hold that against you.” The court did not obtain an affirmative
 or negative response from Petitioner as to his understanding of
 these principles, but simply continued on with the advisement.
 
The second time the court should have requested a
 
response was following its statement that “[a]nd -- and I trust
 that you have -- now that the State has finished its case and you
 had a chance to discuss what happened with your attorney, and
 
16
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
based on that discussion, you have decided that you are not going
 
to testify on your behalf.” Again, the court did not engage
 Petitioner in any acknowledgment of his understanding of these
 propositions. Instead of asking for Petitioner’s response to
 these important matters, the court singled out one factor for a
 response, inquiring “[i]s anybody threatening or forcing you this
 morning not to testify?”, to which Petitioner responded, through
 his interpreter, “No.” It is not evident why the court chose
 this particular issue as one deserving of a response, but did not
 inquire into other matters of constitutional magnitude. 
Under the circumstances, the court did not adequately
 
establish, on-the-record, that Petitioner understood what rights
 he was waiving when he agreed that his decision not to testify
 was his alone. Nothing in the record indicates that in making
 that decision for himself, Petitioner had in fact understood the
 rights listed by the court and to which the court did not obtain
 responses.
 
Moreover, Petitioner’s two responses to the court
 
during this colloquy do not indicate that Petitioner understood
 that he had the right to testify. Regarding the first question,
 “[i]s anybody threatening or forcing you this morning not to
 testify?”, (emphasis added), Petitioner’s response of “No” does
 not indicate that he understood that he had a constitutional
 right to testify, only that no one was forcing him not to do so. 
Moreover, although Petitioner responded “[y]es” to the court’s
 
17
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
statement that “[t]he decision not to testify is yours and yours
 
alone after you have discussed the matter with your attorney[,]”
 it is not clear that the defendant was responding “yes” that he
 understood that the decision was his alone, or “yes[,]” he had
 discussed the matter with his attorney.

The failure to ensure that Petitioner understood his 
rights amounts to a failure to obtain the on-the-record waiver required by Tachibana. In Tachibana, this court declared that one of its reasons for adopting such a requirement was so “a trial judge would establish a record that would effectively settle the right-to-testify issues in the case, and thereby relieve the trial judge of extended post-conviction proceedings.” 79 Hawai' i at 234-35, 900 P.2d at 1302-03 (quoting Boyd, 586 A.2d 
at 679-80) (emphasis added). The colloquy in the instant case by no means produced a record that would “settle the right-to­testify issues.” Id. Respectfully, the colloquy does not 
establish any confidence that the defendant understood each of his rights, and that the court had an objective basis for finding that Petitioner knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily gave up those rights.
6

 The Hawaii Criminal Benchbook also sets forth the Tachibana
 
requirements. 
By contrast, in Christian , the court adm inist ered the colloquy as
 
follows:
 
THE COURT:   As I have discussed with you before the
start of the tr
ial, you do have the constitutional right to
6
 
testify in your own 
defense, You understand?
THE DEFENDANT:
 Yes.
 
18
 In determining how language barriers can affect the
 
waiver of constitutional rights, case law regarding the waiver of
 
the right to a trial by jury, see U.S. Const. amend XI; Haw.
 Const. art. 1, § 14, is instructive.   
In United States v. Duarte-
Higareda, the Ninth Circuit considered whether a defendant had
 knowingly and intelligently waived his Constitutional right to a
 jury trial. 113 F.3d 1000, 1002 (9th Cir. 1997). That court

B.
 
Next, Petitioner’s observation that the court’s error
 
in failing to ensure his understanding was “more egregious”
 because of the need for an interpreter is accurate. 
The language
 
barrier in this case was a “salient fact” that impacted
 Petitioner’s ability to understand the rights that he waived. 
See Barros, 105 Hawai' i at 170, 95 P.3d at 24. 
THE COURT:  And although you should consult with [],
your 
lawyer regarding your decision to testify, it is your
decision and no one can prevent you from testifying if you
chose to do so . . . Do you understand?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
 
THE COURT:   And if you decide to testify, the
prose
cutor will be allowed to cross-examine you.  You
 
understand that?
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
 
THE COURT:  You also have the constitutional right not
to te
stify and to remain silent.  You understand?
 
THE DEFENDANT:  I understand.
 
THE C
OURT:  And you understand  that if you chose not
to testify, that the jury will be instructed that it can not
hold your silence against you in deciding your case.
THE DEFENDANT:  I understand.
 
THE C 
OURT:  It’s the understanding of the Court that you do
not intend to testify in this case,  is that correct?
THE DEFENDANT:  That’s correct.
 THE COURT:  And that’s your decision.
THE D
EFENDANT: Yes.

19
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
noted that “the district court should question the defendant to
 
ascertain whether the defendant understands the benefits and
 burdens of a jury trial and freely chooses to waive a jury.” Id.
 
(citing United States v. Cochran, 770 F.2d 850, 853 (9th Cir.
 1985)). 
The defendant had used a Spanish language interpreter
 
throughout the proceedings, but signed a written jury waiver form
 that was written entirely in English. Id. at 1003. Under these
 
circumstances, Duarte-Higareda held that “[the defendant’s]
 language barrier, like [] mental illness, is a salient fact that
 was known to the district court and put the court on notice that
 [the defendant’s] waiver might be less than knowing and
 intelligent[.]” Id. (emphasis added) (citation and internal
 
quotation marks omitted). The Ninth Circuit thus held that the
 language barrier triggered an additional reason for the district
 court to engage in a colloquy with the defendant “to carry out
 its ‘serious and weighty responsibility’ of ensuring that a
 defendant’s jury waiver is voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.” 
Id. (quoting United States v. Christensen, 18 F.3d 822, 826 (9th
 Cir. 1994)).
 
This court has acknowledged this “salient fact” 
requirement in Friedman, where it addressed whether or not the defendant’s waiver of a jury trial was voluntary, knowing and intelligent. 93 Hawai' i at 70, 996 P.2d at 275 (“[The defendant] 
has failed to direct us to any ‘salient fact’ bearing upon his 
20
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
ability to understand his jury waiver that would have created the 
need for an extensive colloquy by the trial court . . . [.]”); see also Barros, 105 Hawai' i at 169, 95 P.3d at 23; State v. 
Mitchell, 94 Hawai' i 388, 395, 15 P.3d 314, 321 (App. 2000). 
While Friedman is not controlling in terms of addressing a defendant’s waiver of his or her right to testify, the rationale in Friedman highlights the necessity of ensuring that a trial court’s procedures are designed to adequately protect vulnerable defendants. 
The presence of a “salient fact” underscores the 
importance of the court’s colloquy as a procedural safeguard that protects a defendant’s right to testify or to not testify. “Salient facts,” such as mental illness or language barriers, require that a court effectively engage the defendant in a dialogue that will effectuate the rationale behind the colloquy and the on-the-record waiver requirements as set forth in Tachibana. See 79 Hawai' i at 325, 900 P.2d at 1302. 
In Duarte-Higareda, the language barrier was a concern
 
with regard to filling out the jury waiver form that was in
 English. 770 F.2d at 1003. Here, a number of complex concepts
 addressing Petitioner’s constitutional rights were articulated by
 the court and then apparently translated for Petitioner.

 The record reflects that the defendant had a Korean language
 
interpreter and that the discussion occurred “[t]hrough the interpreter[.]”
 
21
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
respect to a waiver of the right to testify, Tachibana and Lewis 
require a colloquy in all cases where defendant is not testifying, see Lewis, 94 Hawai' i at 297, 12 P.3d at 1238, so 
whether or not a colloquy should have been conducted is not at issue in this case. However, as in Duarte-Higareda, a language barrier was present, and thus there was a “salient fact” that made the Petitioner’s understanding of the colloquy critical. 
In these circumstances, the court was duty bound under
 
Tachibana to inquire into Petitioner’s understanding of the
 rights that the court articulated. The language barrier that
 triggered the colloquy requirement in Duarte-Higareda, 770 F.2d
 at 1003, and, by analogy, the language barrier in this case,
 implicate the importance of proper questioning to confirm that
 the Petitioner understood each of his rights with respect to his
 decision not to testify.
 
VIII.
 Taken together, the errors by the court in the instant 
case demonstrate that Petitioner’s waiver of the right to testify was not made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. See 
Christian, 88 Hawai' i at 420, 967 P.2d at 252. With respect to 
the Tachibana colloquy at the close of defendant’s case, first, the court did not ask Petitioner for appropriate responses to ensure that Petitioner understood the rights articulated, and second, the risk that Petitioner did not understand was exacerbated by the fact that Petitioner needed an interpreter 
22
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
during the proceedings. Accordingly, a review of the court’s
 
interactions with Petitioner with respect to the constitutional
 right to testify establishes that the court did not obtain a
 valid on-the-record waiver of Petitioner’s right to testify.

Taken together, the errors

8 In addition, because the case is remanded, we note that in the
 
Tachibana colloquy, two of the advisements may have been confusing and one of
the required advisements was omitted altogether.
First, the court must indicate to a defendant that no one can prevent
him or her from testifying. Id.  However, here, the court stated, “whether to
testify or not is your decision alone and [] nobody can force you to testify.” 
At the end of the colloquy, the court then asked Petitioner, “[i]s anybody
threatening or forcing you this morning not to testify?”  The court’s
 questions indicated coercion was involved, but, to the contrary, “preventing”
need not involve threats or force.  
Second, the court should tell a defendant “that if he or she testifies,
the prosecution will be allowed to cross examine him or her.”  Tachibana, 79 
Hawai'i at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7 (brackets and citations omitted). 
Here, the court did not advise Petitioner of this at all during the Tachibanacolloquy.  Although Petitioner’s counsel had indicated that Petitioner did notintend to testify, it was still critical that the court inform Petitioner thatif he did testify, the prosecutor could cross-examine him, inasmuch asPetitioner could change his mind and decide to testify.
Finally, the court should advise a defendant that he or she has the
right not to testify . Tachibana, 79 Hawai 'i at 235, 900 P.2d at 1303.  Here,
the court told Petitioner that he had “the constitutional right to remainsilent[,]” and said nothing about the right not to testify.  However, for adefendant, “remaining silent” could mean something other than “nottestifying,” since the phrase “right to remain silent” popularly invokes thefamiliar Miranda warnings.  As Chief Justice Rehnquist noted in his opinion inDickerson v. United States, “Miranda has become embedded in routine policepractice to a point where the warnings have become part of our nationalculture.”  530 U.S. 428, 430 (2000).  A defendant could be confused if a court states simply, “you have the right to remain silent” without using theaccompanying phrase, “you have the right not to testify.” 
23
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
waiver of the right to testify was not made knowingly, 
intelligently, and voluntarily. See Christian, 88 Hawai' i at 420, 
967 P.2d at 252. Accordingly, a review of the court’s interactions with Petitioner with respect to the constitutional right to testify establishes that the court did not obtain a valid on-the-record waiver of Petitioner’s right to testify. 
Additionally, we note advisedly for purposes of remand,
 
that the court misstated two portions of the Tachibana colloquy
 and omitted a third portion entirely. 
X.
 
Respondent does not make any arguments with respect to 
harmless error, except to state that, “there is no error here, and thus ‘no occasion to apply the doctrine of harmless error.’” (Quoting Lewis, 94 Hawai' i at 264, 12 P.3d at 1235.) However, 
“[o]nce a violation of the constitutional right to testify is established, the conviction must be vacated unless the State can prove that the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” Tachibana, 79 Hawai' i at 240, 900 P.2d at 1307 (citing Silva, 78 
Hawai'i at 125, 890 P.2d at 712). In this case, Respondent has 
not attempted to prove the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
“The relevant question under the harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt standard is ‘whether there is a reasonable possibility that error might have contributed to conviction.’” State v. Schnabel, 127 Hawai' i 432, 450, 279 P.3d 1237, 1255 
24
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(quoting State v. Duncan, 101 Hawai' i 269, 278, 67 P.3d 768, 777 
(2003)) (emphases in original). As stated, the ICA observed in
 
Hoang that, “it is inherently difficult, if not impossible, to
 divine what effect a violation of the defendant’s constitutional
 right to testify had on the outcome of any particular case,” 94
 Hawai'i at 379, 12 P.3d at 379 (citing Silva, 78 Hawai' i at 126, 
890 P.2d at 713), and thus the burden rests on the State to
 establish “the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.”
 Tachibana, 79 Hawai' i at 240, 990 P.2d at 1307. 
The jury in the instant case heard testimony from
 
complainant, who testified as to the incident, and Honolulu
 Police Officer Kelly Crail (Crail), who responded to the scene of
 the alleged incident. During his cross-examination of
 
9 1 0
 complainant,  and the cross-examination of Crail,  Petitioner’s
 
9 The following excerpts, inter alia, from the cross-examination of
 
complainant support Petitioner’s theory of the case:
 
[Counsel for Petitioner]:   So you went to Straub
[clinic] with these two people from the church, right?
[Complainant]:  That’s correct.
 
[Counsel for Petitioner]:   And you told them what
 
happened?
[Complainant]: Yes.
 
. . . .
 
[Counsel for Petitioner]:  So they didn’t find that -­
your breathing was normal, and your breath sounds normal,
and you had no respiratory distress?
[Complainant]: 
 Yes, they say nothing wrong.
 
. . . . 
[Counsel for Petitioner]:  [] So at Straub [clinic], they did
some tests on you, yeah, x-ray?
[Complainant]:
 Yes.
 
[Counsel for Petitioner]:  They found no fracture?
 [Complainant]:  Yeah, that’s right.
 
The f
ollowing excerpts, inter alia, from the cross-examination of
 
Crail support Petitioner’s theory of the case:
 
25
 10 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
counsel attempted to call into question whether complainant was
 
actually injured as a result of the events that took place on
 January 17, 2010. Thus, the theory of Petitioner’s defense at
 trial appears to have been that complainant’s testimony was not
 credible, in other words, that she was lying about the alleged
 incident. 
In closing argument, Petitioner’s counsel argued, 
inter
 
alia, that (1) “the physical evidence [didn’t] match” the
 
11
 complaint’s version of events,  (2) that complainant
12
 (3) that the
 “exaggerated” her account and was “not credible[,]”  
only account of the incident that Respondent presented was
 complainant’s account, which again, was not corroborated by the
 
[Counsel for Petitioner]:   If she hadn't been able to
 
walk 
around because of pain, that certainly would have gone
in your report, correct?
[Crail]:
  Yes.
 
[Counsel for Petitioner]: 
 Do you recall ever seeing
her walk at all that night? Was she moving and standing at
all?
 
[Crail]:
  Yes.
 
. . . .
 
[Counsel for Petitioner]:  Did you see her walk with a
 
limp,
 dragging her back foot?
[Crail]:  No.
 
[Counsel for Petitioner]:   Something like that, you
certa
inly would have noticed, and probably the EMS person
would have noticed, everybody would have noticed, right?
[Crail]:  Yes.
 
11
 Counsel for Petitioner stated, “[p]hysical evidence doesn’t lie. 
The physical evidence doesn’t match, and when the physical evidence doesn’t
match, you have a reasonable doubt as to whether things happened the way
[complainant] said.”
 
12
 Counsel for Petitioner stated, “[s]o [complainant] exaggerated. 
And what does the law say about exaggerating?  You can use that to see if you
 find the witness credible.  She’s not credible.” 
26
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
13
 (4) that the jury cannot know, based only on
 physical evidence,  
complainant’s account, what actually occurred on the date of the
 
incident,14 and (5) that complainant’s “stories conflict,” which
 
could create questions in the minds of the jurors, and therefore
 reasonable doubt.
15 As a result, based on the cross-examination
 
of Respondent’s witnesses and the closing argument, the case
 would have rested on the credibility of the witnesses.
 
As Petitioner noted before, “[i]f [Petitioner] had
 
testified, the decisive issue in the instant case would have been
 credibility, as his version as to what occurred on the night in
 question would have conflicted with [complainant’s] version.” 
13 Counsel for Petitioner stated,
 And if you have a doubt about that -- because it’s just
[complainant’s] word.  There’s no other witnesses.  There’s
 no video of something happening.  There’s no neighbor who
 even heard shouting.  There’s no other testimony.  That’s
 all [Respondent’s] introduced, is her word that this
happened.  And you look at the physical evidence, which
doesn’t lie, it can’t lie, and has no reason to lie, has
nothing to gain from -- by lying, and it doesn’t match what
she said. 
14 Counsel for Petitioner stated:
 
[Complainant] came in, and she lied, and she
exaggerated.  And you don’t know what really happened
 that night.  You don’t know if [Petitioner] hit her. 
You don’t know if he was even there.  You don’t know
 if she just whacked herself in the face enough to get
it red and show an old bruise or a new bruise, rammed
herself against the counter.  Who knows, okay?  Who
 knows?
 
15
 Finally, counsel for Petitioner stated:
 
[Complainant’s] stories conflict.  You’re allowed to
 
question her credibility.  You may have a question about her
 credibility.  And she’s the only eyewitness.  If you have
 questions about your decision.  When you have questions,
 that means you have a doubt.  When you have just one, single
reasonable doubt -- doesn’t have to be the same as everybody
else -- you have to vote not guilty.
 
27
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Thus, in this case, as in Tachibana and Silva, it would be 
“‘impossible to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt,’” that Petitioner’s testimony, “‘could not have created a reasonable doubt in the mind of the factfinder and, hence, that the error could not have contributed to the conviction.’” Tachibana, 79 
Hawai'i at 240, 900 P.2d at 1307 (quoting Silva, 78 Hawai' i at 
126, 890 P.2d at 713). Thus, the court’s error in failing to obtain an knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of Petitioner’s right to testify was not harmless.

Based on the foregoing, we vacate the ICA’s October 30,
 
2012 judgment and the court’s October 13, 2011 Amended Judgment
 of Conviction and Sentence, and remand the case to the court for
 proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
