ORDER OF CORRECTION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the Opinion of the court filed on June
 
19, 2013, it appears that sections VIII and IX are repetitive. 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that part of section IX (lines 5Â­
12 on page 23 and lines 1-6 on page 24) is deleted. The
 subsequent section roman numerals are changed to reflect the
 deletion. Additionally, in footnote 8, lines 1-3 are deleted.
 The Clerk of the Court is directed to take all
 
necessary steps to notify the publishing agencies of these
 
changes.
 
DATED: 
Honolulu, Hawai' i, July 31, 2013.
