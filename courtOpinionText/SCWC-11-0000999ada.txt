CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(ICA NO. CAAP-11-0000999; CIVIL NO. 08-1-352K)
 
ORDER ACCEPTING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI,
VACATING ICA ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL AND CROSS-APPEAL FOR LACK
 OF JURISDICTION, AND REMANDING APPEAL AND CROSS-APPEAL TO ICA
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and McKenna, JJ. and
Circuit Judge Crandall, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
Petitioner/plaintiff-appellant/cross-appellee Saingoen Davis
 
filed a timely application for writ of certiorari on June 7, 2012
 
to review the intermediate court of appeals' (ICA) May 8, 2012
 
Order Dismissing Appeal and Cross-Appeal for Lack of
 
Jurisdiction. 
Petitioner and respondents appealed and cross-
appealed the November 21, 2011 Final Judgment entered in Civil
 No. 08-1-352K. The ICA concluded that the November 21, 2011
 Final Judgment did not resolve the Vancil defendants' cross-claim 
-- and therefore did not resolve all claims of all the parties, 
as required by Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 
Hawai'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1333, 1338 (1994) -- because: (1) the 
final paragraph of the judgment declared that the judgment did not dispose of the cross-claim "which may be resurrected" after 
the appeal of the good faith determination order and (2) the 
cross-claim was in fact resurrected on February 24, 2012 when the 
ICA vacated the good faith determination order. However, 
paragraph 11 of the November 21, 2011 judgment stated that "[the 
Vancil defendants] cross-claim against Defendant Nicholle . . . 
was dismissed." The judgment, on its face, resolved the cross-
claim, notwithstanding the caveat that the cross-claim "may be 
resurrected" after the appeal of the good faith determination 
order. The finality and appealability of the November 21, 2011 
judgment was not affected by the subsequent vacatur of the good 
faith determination order and reinstatement of the cross-claim on 
February 24, 2012. 
Petitioner's application for writ of certiorari is
 
accepted. The ICA's May 8, 2012 Order Dismissing Appeal and
 
Cross-Appeal for Lack of Jurisdiction is vacated. Petitioner's
 
appeal and respondents' cross-appeal are remanded to the ICA for
 
disposition.
