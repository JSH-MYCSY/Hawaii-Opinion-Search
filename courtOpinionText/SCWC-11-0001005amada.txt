VACATING ICA ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR
 
LACK OF JURISDICTION, AND REMANDING APPEAL TO ICA
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, Duffy, and McKenna, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-appellant Na Moku 
'Aupuni O Ko 'olau Hui (Na 
Moku) filed a timely application for writ of certiorari on 
November 29, 2011 to review the intermediate court of appeals' (ICA) August 31, 2011 Order Dismissing Appeal for Lack of Jurisdiction. Na Moku appealed a decision of the Commission on Water Resource Management (the Commission) denying Na Moku's petition for a contested case hearing on the Commission's amendment of interim instream flow standards for certain Maui streams. The Commission's decision was reflected in the minutes

identified on the original order as ICA No. CAAP-11-0000161.
 of the Commission's October 18, 2010 meeting, which minutes were
 
approved and signed by Lenore N. Ohye, the Acting Deputy Director
 to the Chairperson of the Board of Land and Natural Resources
 (BLNR). The ICA concluded that the minutes of the October 18,
 2010 meeting were not a final order of the Commission appealable
 pursuant to HRS § 91-14(a) because the document was not "signed
 by the (BLNR) chairperson or any other member of the
 Commission[.]" (Underscoring added.) The ICA accordingly
 dismissed Na Moku's appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
HAR § 13-167-7(c) provides that "[a]ll orders and other
 
actions of the commission shall be authenticated or signed by the
 chairperson or other persons authorized by the commission." 
(Underscoring added). HAR § 13-167-8(e) provides that the deputy
 to the chairperson "shall certify all decisions and orders and
 other actions of the commission."
 
Acting Deputy Director Lenore N. Ohye was authorized by 
the Commission, pursuant to HAR § 13-167-8(e), to certify the Commission's October 18, 2010 decision denying Na Moku's petition for a contested case hearing. Ohye did so by approving and signing the minutes of the Commission's October 18, 2010 meeting reflecting the Commission's decision. Ohye authenticated the Commission's decision in accordance with HAR § 13-167-7(c). The decision, as reflected in the minutes of the Commission's October 18, 2010 meeting, is a final decision of the Commission for which judicial review may be sought pursuant to HRS § 91-14(a). See 
Kaleikini v. Thielen, 124 Hawai' i 1, 26, 237 P.3d 1067, 1092

 (2010) (letter by BLNR chairperson denying request for contested
 
case hearing constituted a final decision and order from which
 judicial review could be sought pursuant to HRS § 91-14(a).).
 
Na Moku's application for writ of certiorari is
 
accepted. The ICA's August 31, 2011 Order Dismissing Appeal for
 Lack of Appellate Jurisdiction is vacated. Na Moku's appeal is
 remanded to the ICA for disposition.
