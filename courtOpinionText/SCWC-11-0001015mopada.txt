STATE OF HAWAI' I,
Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee,

DANIEL JOSEPH JOHNSON,
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant. 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna and Pollack, JJ.)
 
This appeal arises from a series of unfortunate
 
clerical errors. 
On September 13, 1995, Petitioner/Defendant-
Appellant Daniel Joseph Johnson (Johnson) entered a deferred plea
 
in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (circuit court) to the
 charge of promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree. The
 circuit court subsequently set aside Johnson’s deferral and he
 was placed on probation. However, unbeknownst to the State or to
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Johnson, after Johnson’s deferral was set aside, an order of
 
discharge and dismissal that purportedly dismissed the original
 charge against Johnson was mistakenly filed. Apparently unaware
 of the order of discharge and dismissal, the circuit court
 proceeded to revoke Johnson’s probation numerous times in the
 following years. After the erroneous order of discharge and
 dismissal was brought to the circuit court’s attention, the court
 attempted to remedy that order in an August 29, 2011 order of
 correction. On November 17, 2011, the circuit court again
 revoked Johnson’s probation and imposed a five year sentence. 
Johnson appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals
 
(ICA), and in a memorandum opinion the ICA affirmed the circuit
 court’s November 17, 2011 order of revocation and resentencing. 
We vacate the ICA’s July 29, 2013 judgment on appeal and June 10,
 2013 memorandum opinion due to a previously unidentified clerical
 error in the circuit court’s August 29, 2011 order of correction.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On November 3, 1994, Johnson and his brother, co-
defendant Benjamin Michael Johnson, were indicted, inter alia, for promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree in violation of Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 712-1243(1) (1993), in 
criminal case number (Cr. No.) 94-189K. On March 30, 1995, and September 13, 1995, the circuit court entered orders granting 
2
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Benjamin Michael Johnson and Johnson, respectively, deferred
 
acceptance of guilty pleas to the charge of promoting a dangerous
 drug in the third degree.
1 As a result of multiple probation
 
violations stemming from Johnson’s abuse of drugs and alcohol, on
 June 5, 1996, the State filed a motion to set aside Johnson’s
 deferred acceptance of guilty plea. On June 5, 1998, the circuit
 court granted the State’s motion, accepted Johnson’s guilty plea,
 and resentenced Johnson to five years of probation with sixty
 days of incarceration as a special term of probation. 
On May 16, 2000, a purported order of discharge and
 
dismissal for Cr. No. 94-189K as to Johnson’s charge of promoting
 a dangerous drug in the third degree was filed. The order
 referenced the deferred acceptance of guilty plea entered by the
 circuit court on March 30, 1995 and stated that “the State ha[d]
 not filed a motion to set aside the deferred acceptance of plea,
 nor ha[d] filed a motion to adjudicate the Defendant, nor ha[d]
 otherwise informed the Court that Defendant ha[d] not complied
 with the terms and conditions of the Court order.” 
Following the court’s 1998 acceptance of Johnson’s
 
guilty plea, and apparently unaware of the purported dismissal
 order filed May 16, 2000, the circuit court repeatedly revoked

Johnson’s probation and resentenced him to additional periods of
 
probation and incarceration. On August 14, 2009, the circuit
 court again issued an order revoking Johnson’s probation and
 resentencing Johnson to an indeterminate term of five years of
 incarceration with credit for time served.
2 The circuit court
 
elaborated upon its initial order in an additional order filed
 September 3, 2009, stating that Johnson willfully and inexcusably
 violated substantial terms of probation by failing to submit to
 two drug tests, failing to make child support payments as ordered
 by the family court, and traveling without his probation
 officer’s permission. Johnson appealed the circuit court’s
 September 3, 2009 order to the ICA. 
On November 18, 2009, after learning of the May 16,
 
2000 dismissal order, the State filed a motion in the circuit
 court to correct the dismissal order. The State noted that the
 May 16, 2000 dismissal order had “a clerical mistake in its
 caption ‘(As to DANIEL JOSEPH JOHNSON)’ and should have referred
 instead to co-Defendant Benjamin Michael Johnson.” The State
 explained that the conditions described in the order applied to
 Benjamin Michael Johnson, rather than Johnson. 
By summary disposition order of March 29, 2011, the ICA

held that due to the May 16, 2000 dismissal order, it was plain
 
error for the circuit court to resentence Johnson to a five year
 term of imprisonment on September 3, 2009. State v. Johnson,
 
Nos. 30044 & 30084, 2011 WL 1144855 at *2 (Haw. App. March 29,
 2011) (SDO). The ICA acknowledged, however, that the State had
 filed a motion to correct the clerical error in the May 16, 2000
 dismissal order, and the ICA remanded the case to the circuit
 court to address that issue. Id.
 
On August 29, 2011, the circuit court attempted to
 
resolve the clerical error by issuing an order granting the
 State’s motion to correct the clerical mistake on the May 16,
 2000 dismissal order. The circuit court recognized that the
 dismissal order contained a clerical error in its caption and
 stated that the order should not have referred to Johnson, but
 “should have referred instead to co-defendant Benjamin Michael
 Johnson.” Importantly, the order concluded: “It is hereby
 ordered that the Order of Discharge and Dismissal filed May 16,
 2009, be set aside.” On November 17, 2011, the circuit court
 entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law and order
 revoking Johnson’s probation and reimposing the five year
 sentence with credit for time served. 
Johnson appealed the circuit court’s order of
 
revocation and resentencing to the ICA, arguing in part, that the
 
5
    *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
May 16, 2000 order of discharge and dismissal made all subsequent
 
actions taken in the case a nullity. The ICA held that
 “[i]rrespective of whether the Circuit Court properly set aside
 the Order of Discharge and Dismissal, the Circuit Court lacked
 jurisdiction to enter the order in the first instance” because
 Johnson’s deferred acceptance of guilty plea was set aside and
 his conviction was final before the entry of the order of
 discharge and dismissal. State v. Johnson, No. CAAP-11-0001015,
 
2013 WL 2476724 at *3 (Haw. App. June 10, 2013) (mem.).
 
II. DISCUSSION
 
A. The circuit court lacked statutory authority to enter the
May 16, 2000 order of discharge and dismissal.
 
We agree with the ICA insofar as concluding that the
 
May 16, 2000 order of discharge and dismissal was issued in
 error. On June 5, 1998, two years before the circuit court
 issued its order of discharge, it set aside Johnson’s deferred
 acceptance of guilty plea and convicted him due to his non­compliance with the terms and conditions of the plea. Thus, not
 only did the circuit court make a clerical error when it used the
 incorrect name in the order of discharge and dismissal, more
 importantly, the circuit court lacked the statutory authority to
 dismiss a charge of which Johnson had already been convicted. 
6
    
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B. The ICA erred when it affirmed the circuit court’s
 
November 17, 2011 order revoking Johnson’s probation and
resentencing him to five years of imprisonment.
 
On remand from the ICA to correct the error in the May
 
16, 2000 dismissal order, the circuit court entered an order that
 
contained yet another mistake. The circuit court’s August 29,
 2011 order purportedly corrected a nonexistent May 16, 2009 order
 of discharge and dismissal. Due to this second clerical mistake,
 the circuit court failed to set aside the May 16, 2000 dismissal
 order. Thus, that order was still in effect when the circuit
 court issued its November 17, 2011 order of revocation and
 resentenced Johnson.
3 While the circuit court lacked the
 
statutory authority to enter the order of discharge and dismissal
 in 2000, it was erroneous for the circuit court to re-sentence
 Johnson without first properly correcting the May 16, 2000 order
 of discharge and dismissal. 
3 The circuit court’s August 29, 2011 order of correction also
 
failed to state that the order was entered nunc pro tunc.
 
The purpose or function of an order nunc pro tunc is to make
the record speak the truth. It is an inherent power of the
court but is limited to those acts which record ‘now for
 then’ an order actually made or a judgment actually rendered
which through some oversight or inadvertence was never
entered upon the records of the court by the clerk or which
was incorrectly entered.
 
DuPonte v. DuPonte, 53 Haw. 123, 126-27, 488 P.2d 537, 540 (1971).  Because it
 is undisputed that the order of May 16, 2000 was incorrectly entered as to
Johnson, the circuit court should have indicated that the order of correction
was entered nunc pro tunc .

  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
III. CONCLUSION
 
We hold that the ICA erred in affirming the circuit
 
court’s erroneous November 17, 2011 order. Accordingly, we
 
vacate the ICA’s July 29, 2013 judgment on appeal and June 10,
 2013 memorandum opinion and remand this case to the circuit court
 for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
