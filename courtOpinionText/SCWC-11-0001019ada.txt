as a construction supervisor for Oahu Construction Co., Ltd. 
(Oahu Construction) and the subsequent workers’ compensation 
claims made against Oahu Construction, insured by Seabright 
Insurance Company. The issues presented on appeal are 1) 
whether there was substantial evidence to show that a 
neuromonics device was reasonably needed to treat Pulawa’s 
tinnitus and 2) whether Pulawa was no longer entitled to total 
temporary disability (TTD) payments because he was able to 
resume work. We hold that there was substantial evidence that 
the neuromonics device was reasonably needed for treating 
Pulawa’s tinnitus, and that based on this finding, Pulawa was 
not medically stable and unable to return to work.  Thus, the 
Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB) clearly 
erred in its determination that Pulawa was not entitled to the 
neuromonics device and in its decision to terminate Pulawa’s TTD 
payments. Accordingly, the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) 
December 16, 2014 Judgment on Appeal and LIRAB’s November 2, 
2011 Decision and Order are vacated. The case is remanded to 
LIRAB for proceedings consistent with this opinion.  
I. Background 
A. Pulawa’s Work -Related Accident 
Pulawa’s tinnitus diagnosis is due to a work-related 
accident. On August 20, 1996, Pulawa was employed by Oahu

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Construction as a construction supervisor when he was injured. 
As he was observing the construction operations, Pulawa was 
struck in the head by a 12 inch by 6 inch rock that became 
airborne after being run over by a loader vehicle.  The force 
from this projectile cracked Pulawa’s hard hat and fractured his 
skull.1 As a result of this accident, Pulawa now suffers severe 
headaches, tinnitus, and depression. Tinnitus sufferers hear 
ringing or other sounds in the ear when no external sound is 
present. See 11 Roscoe N. Gray & Louise J. Gordy, Attorneys’ 
Textbook of Medicine ¶ 84.63 (3d ed. 2014).  Pulawa suffers from chronic bilateral tinnitus, which is described as a “constant, 
high-pitched tone.” Pulawa has not returned to work since he 
was injured in August 1996. 
B. Pulawa’s Medical Treatment and Doctor Evaluations 
Immediately after the accident, Pulawa was treated at 
The Queen’s Medical Center and required surgery to repair a left 
frontal skull depressed fracture.  As he recovered from surgery, Pulawa suffered from impaired cognitive functions.  After more 
than two weeks of hospitalization, Pulawa was transferred to the 
Rehabilitation Hospital of the Pacific for another two weeks, 
where he received physical, occupational, and speech therapy.

negligence, but he did not prevail.  Pulawa v. GTE Hawaiian Tel , 112 Hawai i

                     ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
After his release from the Rehabilitation Hospital, Pulawa 
continued outpatient therapy on a monthly basis for 
approximately two years. His primary complaints consisted of 
headaches, cognitive issues, and sleep problems.  While early 
reports do not specifically list tinnitus as a complaint, he was 
briefly prescribed tinnitus medication (amitriptyline) in 1997 
and also complained of ringing in his ears during an independent 
neuropsychological evaluation performed in 2000. 
Pulawa has been continuously treated for his ailments —  
primarily headaches and tinnitus —from the time of the accident.  
Dr. Barry Odegaard, Pulawa’s family physician, treated Pulawa 
from 1997 to approximately 2001.  Dr. Robert Marvit, a 
psychiatrist, treated Pulawa from early 2001 to late 2009, when 
he retired. In 2001, Dr. Marvit prescribed a treatment plan 
that consisted of Pulawa attending the Casa Colina Center of 
Rehabilitation (Casa Colina), a residential brain injury 
2 treatment program in Pomona, California, for several months.    
Dr. Marvit believed that the residential treatment program would 
allow Pulawa to maximize his capacities so that he would  be 
2   Dr. Marvit’s status as an attending or concurrent physician under 
Hawai
i  Administrative Rules (HAR)  §  12-15-32 or §  12-15-40, which is required 
to submit a treatment plan, was challenged by Oahu Construction. 
Subsequently, Dr. Marvit was found to be a concurrent physician by the 
Director of the Department of Labor and  Industrial Relations . However, 
further challenges to Dr. Marvit’s tre atment plan, including attendance in 
the Casa Colina treatment program, were brought  by Oahu Construction .    
4
   
 
   
 
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
“functionally capable of returning to useful, gainful activity.”  
Dr. Marvit noted that the program “ would also include less 
reliance on medication, increased interpersonal, positive 
interactions, avoidance of self-destructive behaviors, pain 
control, and an exercise of his vocational potential.”  
Dr. David Patterson, the Medica
l Director at Casa 
Colina, stated in his preadmission screening report that Pulawa 
was an acceptable candidate for the brain injury treatment 
program, even though Pulawa had some “psychological overlay ” 
that was preventing further recovery. Despite this psychological hindrance, Dr. Patterson believed that Pulawa had 
persistent physical and neurocognitive symptoms, such as 
tinnitus, that needed to be addressed.  Proposed treatment 
included admission to Casa Colina’s comprehensive 
neuropsychological program that would provide Pulawa with 
“compensatory strategies to deal with the emotional, cognitive 
and psychological difficulties.” In addition, Dr. Patterson 
recommended cervical trigger point injections to promote 
movement in the neck, an evaluation of his migraine-type 
medications, and evaluations by specialists in otology, 
neurology, audiology, oral/maxillofacial, and neuro-optometry to 
further his recovery.  Pulawa agreed to attend the treatment 
program.

  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
However, admission to Casa Colina was delayed for 
nearly six years due to Oahu Construction’s challenge of Dr. 
Marvit’s treatment plan recommending admission . After the 
Director of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, Disability Compensation Division (Director) approved the 
treatment plan and LIRAB affirmed the Director’s decision, 
Pulawa attended Casa Colina , where he participated in the 
program from September 2007 to February 2008. 
During the treatment program, Pulawa received several 
treatments to manage and relieve his headaches, tinnitus, and depression. Relevant to this appeal, Dr. Lucy Shih, a 
specialist in otology and neurotology at the Casa Colina center, 
examined Pulawa and recommended that he be fitted with a 
neuromonics device, a device that at the time was only available 
at the House Ear Institute in Los Angeles, California.  Dr. Shih 
was referred by Dr. Patterson specifically to assess treatment 
options for Pulawa’s tinnitus symptoms. Dr. Shih stated in a 
letter to Dr. Patterson that she informed Pulawa of “a 
relatively new tinnitus treatment which may be beneficial.” Dr. Shih described the device as “a listening device manufactured by 
Neuromonics which incorporates a neural stimulus into music to 
interrupt and desensitize the brain from continued perception of 
[tinnitus].” The device consists of earphones connected to a

   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
small compact music player.   Dr. Patterson agreed with Dr. 
Shih’s recommendation to fit Pulawa with a neuromonics device. 
However, Pulawa was released from Casa Colina after five months  
of treatment, returning to Hawai i in  February 2008, without  
3  being fitted for the neuromonic device.   
Rather than 
authorizing the neuromonics device after 
Pulawa completed the Casa Colina program, Oahu Construction 
requested two independent evaluations by Drs. Brian Goodyear, a neuropsychologist, and Anthony Mauro, a neurologist, as well as 
a vocational rehabilitation assess ment, to update Pulawa’s 
worker
s’ compensation disability status. 
1.	 Dr. Brian Goodyear’s Supplemental Independent 
Psychological Evaluation 
Dr. Goodyear, a neuropsychologist, evaluated Pulawa on 
May 23, 2008 and May 27, 2008 after Pulawa sought authorization 
from Oahu Construction for the neuromonics device that he had not received during his treatment in California.  Although Dr. 
Goodyear concluded Pulawa was medically stable and therefore 
would not improve with future treatment, he did not discuss the 
utility of the neuromonics device in his report; nor did he 
3 From the record, it appears that Pulawa was unable to be fitted 
with the device in California for several reasons, including: 1) Seabright 
Insurance required extensive documentation in order to process the request 
for the neuromonics device consultation; 2) the insurance adjustor assigned 
to Pulawa’s case retired while the request was pending; and 3) the House Ear 
Institute had a large backlog of patients, and appointments were scheduled 
several weeks or months in advance . 
7
   
 
     
  
  
 
 
  In regard to returning to work, Dr. Goodyear concluded 
that while Pulawa would have some difficulty returning to his 
usual and customary work, he was capab  le of returning to 
productive employment. He did not believe any significant 
changes in Pulawa’s subjective complaints and functional status ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
address the opinions of Dr. Shih and Dr. Patterson recommending 
the neuromonics device for treatment of Pulawa’s tinnitus. 
In his report, Dr. Goodyear noted that he evaluated 
Pulawa on two previous occasions, December 1999 and July 2004. 
After briefly summarizing Pulawa’s extensive medical history, 
Dr. Goodyear opined there was no significant change in Pulawa’s condition since the 2004 evaluation. Although Pulawa had 
completed the Casa Colina program and met with Dr. Marvit on a 
regular basis, Dr. Goodyear concluded there was little 
improvement for a number of reasons —primarily because Pulawa 
lacked motivation and was magnifying his symptoms.  Dr. Goodyear 
reasoned that Pulawa “had become very entrenched in the disabled role” and that he had powerful financial incentives to not give 
up that role. Specifically, Dr. Goodyear mentioned that Pulawa 
was receiving about $5,000 per month in benefits. Based on the 
foregoing, Dr. Goodyear concluded that from a neuropsychological 
perspective, Pulaw a’s condition remained stable and ratable, and 
he remained at a 25% permanent impairment rating. 
8
   
 
  
  
 
 
   
 
  
   
   
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
would occur in the future. Thus, according to Dr. Goodyear, 
Pulawa required no further psychological or neuropsychological 
testing and no significant changes in Pulawa’s subjective 
complaints and functional status would occur in the future. 
However, Dr. Goodyear ’s report did acknowledge the need to 
engage in further review of his current medical regimen for headaches. Throbbing headaches, tinnitus, interrupted sleep, 
memory problems, difficulty with loud noises, and depression 
were reported to Dr. Goodyear during each of his evaluations of 
Pulawa. Based on this history, Dr. Goodyear recommended that a 
neurologist evaluate Pulawa to review the effectiveness of his 
current treatment regimen for his headaches and determine 
whether Pulawa had achieved maximum medical improvement.  
2. Dr. Anthony Mauro’s Independent Medical Evaluation 
On July 3, 2008, Dr. Mauro, a neurologist, completed 
Pulawa’s second independent medical examination due to Pulawa’s 
request for the neuromonics device. His examination was limited to a records review; he did not personally communicate with 
Pulawa. Regarding the neuromonics device, Dr. Mauro admitted 
that he was not aware of the device being “available for 
treatment of tinnitus” or whether the device met “an accepted 
standard of treatment for tinnitus.” Nonetheless, b ased on his 
review of the medical records, Dr. Mauro concluded Pulawa ’s 
9
   
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
medical condition was medically stable and ratable, and that his 
symptoms would never completely subside. Dr. Mauro was 
concerned that Pulawa had an “inappropriate hope for ‘100% ’ 
recovery.” In particular, Dr. Mauro poi nted out that in late 
1997, the Chief of Psychology Services at the Rehabilitation 
Hospital of the Pacific, Kathleen S. Brown, Ph.D., stated that 
Pulawa “[did] not appear to ful ly appreciate the need for self 
management and treatment of chronic pain and continues to seek 
[a] medical cure for his pain.” Dr. Mauro was concerned that 
Pulawa’s history of seeking a medical cure meant that he 
required his condition to return to “100%” prior to returning to 
any type of employment. 
Dr. Mauro concluded that although Pulawa suffers from 
significant cognitive and personality deficits from his head 
injury, he is capable of gainful employment, albeit not as a 
construction supervisor. Indeed, based on his review of 
Pulawa’s records, Dr. Mauro reasoned that Pulawa woul d never 
report improvement in his symptoms, regardless of future 
treatment. 
Dr. Mauro’s opinion did not include a position as to 
whether the neuromonics device was reasonably needed for 
Pulawa’s greatest possible medical rehabilitation. Nor did he 
address the opinions of Dr. Shih and Dr. Patterson recommending 
10
   
 
   
 
  
 
   
 
 
 
  
 
   
 
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
the neuromonics device for treatment of Pulawa’s tinnitus. He 
reviewed two academic studies of the device —one of which found 
the treatment “promising,” although it lacked “ideal pl acebo 
control.” According to Dr. Mauro’s report, the second study 
stated that “electrical suppression of the tinnitus does not 
offer a promising outcome for patients.” After reading the two 
articles, he concluded there was no “basis for enthusiasm for 
ongoing efforts to treat the tinnitus.” 
3.	 Vocational Counsel or Priscilla Ballesteros Havre’s 
Independent Vocational Rehabilitation Report 
Ms. Priscilla Ballesteros Havre performed an 
independent vocational rehabilitation review dated November 6, 
2008, at the request of Oahu Construction to determine whether 
Pulawa was capable of returning to work.  She did not address 
the opinions of Dr. Shih and Dr. Patterson, recommending the 
neuromonics device for treatment of Pulawa’s tinnitus. After 
reviewing the reports of Dr. Goodyear and Dr. Mauro and a prior 
vocational rehabilitation report from 1997, Ms. Ballesteros 
Havre endorsed the views of Dr. Mauro and Goodyear to conclude 
that Pulawa’s symptoms, his current daily activities, his 
tendency to magnify symptoms, his average cognitive abilities, 
and the amount of compensation he received on disability 
rendered him capable of returning to gainful employment if he 
were motivated to do so.  
11
   
 
    
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Based on her opinion that Pulawa lacked motivation, 
Ms. Ballesteros Havre conducted no independent analysis as to 
whether Pulawa was capable of returning to work. 
4.	 Pulawa’s Treating Physician Reject s Opinions of 
Independent Medical Examiners 
Dr. Marvit submitted a treatment plan on December 2, 
2008 rejecting the opinions of the three independent medical 
examiners retained by the employer. As Pulawa’s treating 
physician, Dr. Marvit was not of the view that Pulawa was 
medically stable and would not benefit from further treatment.  
Consistent with Dr. Shih and Patterson, he requested Pulawa 
receive concurrent care at the House Ear Institute in order to 
be fitted with the neuromonics device.  In a letter dated 
February 26, 2009, Dr. Marvit stated that “ without approval of 
the treatment plan outlined by myself and Casa Colina, he will 
remain in a permanently impaired disabled state, and the 
likelihood of any kind of recovery will be minimal to absent. ” 
He also noted that “[i]n addition, one would expect further 
deterioration of his function, which would end up ultimately in 
either his premature death, or institutionalization.” 
5.	 Oahu Construction Denies the Neuromonics Device and 
Seeks To Terminate TTD Payments 
Based on the evaluations of Drs. Goodyear and Mauro, 
and the review by vocational counselor Ms. Ballesteros Havre, 
12
   
 
  
    
    
 
 
   
 
  
                     
  
 
   
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Oahu Construction took two actions.  First, on December 5, 2008, 
it denied Dr. Marvit’s December 2, 2008 treatment plan 
requesting that Pulawa be fitted for the neuromonics device at 
the House Ear Institute in California. Second, on December 16, 
2008, Oahu Construction gave notice to Pulawa, in accordance 
with Hawai i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-31 and Hawai i 
Administrative Rules (HAR) § 12-10-26, seeking to terminate TTD 
payments no later than December 30, 2008 because the reports of 
Drs. Goodyear and Mauro and vocational counselor Ms. Ballesteros 
Havre showed that Pulawa had “retired from the labor market and 
is not entitled to income and indemnity benefits.” After Oahu 
Construction denied Pulawa’s request to be fitted with a 
neuromonics device and gave notice of its intent to terminate 
TTD payments, Pulawa sought relief from the Director. 
C. Department of Labor and Industrial Relations Proceedings 
Pulawa requested a hearing to determine whether Dr. 
Marvit’s treatment plan dated December 2, 2008 was improperly 
denied and to determine if TTD payments were properly 
terminated.4 On March 30, 2009, the Director determined that 
4 On January 5, 2009, Pulawa’s first request for the neuromonics 
device was denied on the basis that the attending physician did not submit to 
Oahu Construction a written request for the neuromonics device that comported 
with the requirements of HAR § 12-15-51(a), which outlines the notice 
requirements applicable when an attending physician requests approval from the employer to treat the employee . 
13
   
 
   
 
 
   
  
 
  
                     
   
 
   
 
   
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
5Pulawa was not entitled to a neuromonics device. The Director 
also concluded on March 30, 2009 that Pulawa was entitled to TTD 
benefits only through December 16, 20086 based on Dr. Goodyear’s 
and Mauro’s opinion that Pulawa was capable of returning to 
work. 
The Director also awarded Oahu Construction a credit for 
TTD payments from December 17, 2008 through December 30, 2008. Finally, the Director found that the issue of permanent 
disability was premature because there was no impairment rating 
for Pulawa’s injuries and that the issue would be decided at a 
later date. Pulawa appealed the March 2009 decision to LIRAB, 
which triggered Oahu Construction’s request for an ad ditional 
independent medical evaluation performed by Dr. Ajit Arora, an internist.    
1. Dr. Ajit Arora’s Independent Medical Evaluation 
Dr. Arora performed Pulawa’s third independent medical 
evaluation on behalf of Oahu Construction on July 6, 2010.  
Dr. 
Arora addressed Pulawa’ s medical stability, ability to return to 
work, and need for further treatment. He did not conclude that 
5 The Director’s decision was based on Pulawa’s failure to appeal 
the January 5, 2009 decision within the 20 days required by HRS § 386-87(a).  
LIRAB and the ICA, however, reached the merits of Pulawa’s claim , as 
discussed infra. The procedural issue cited by the Director was not raised 
by the parties on certiorari and is thus not addressed herein. 
6 Oahu Construction gave notice of its intent to terminate TTD 
payments on December 16, 2008.  
14
   
 
  
   
   
 
  
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
the neuromonics device was not reasonably needed for Pulawa’s 
greatest possible rehabilitation. 
After examining Pulawa and reviewing the medical 
records, Dr. Arora came to several conclusions. First, Dr. 
Arora determined that Pulawa’s condition was medically stable 
and eligible for a permanent disability rating because his 
symptoms had remained unchanged for several years. Second, Dr. 
Arora concluded that while Pulawa suffers from throbbing 
headaches and tinnitus, he is able to be employed in a position 
that will accommodate his limitations. Dr. Arora pointed out 
that he had several patients who were able to work with severe 
tinnitus symptoms. Like Drs. Goodyear and Mauro, Dr. Arora 
agreed that motivation was an important factor in Pulawa’s 
return to work because Pulawa “is probably making more money now 
than he would if he returned to some type of modified 
employment.” 
Third, Dr. Arora determined that although Pulawa 
received appropriate treatment for the throbbing headaches, cognitive dysfunction, and depression, the treatment at Casa 
Colina was of questionable relevance and significance. Dr. 
Arora opined that the necessity and utility of such a program 
was highly questionable because Pulawa’s injury was over 10 
15
   
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
years old at the time, and thus resulted in a waste of resources 
and time. 
Next, Dr. Arora acknowledged in his report that the   
work injury and noise exposure   caused Pulawa’s tinnitus , but he 
did not recommend the neuromonics device.   He stated that he had  
“serious[]  doubt” that the use of “a neuromonics device for this 
symptom” “would be of any benefit” —noting that “ [t]here is no 
proven treatment for tinnitus.”   In apparent contradiction, 
however, Dr. Arora  endorsed a treatment for tinnitus; he   agreed  
that the medication prescribed by his treating physician, 
amitriptyline, “is typically the .  .  . medication prescribed for 
such patients and may help some cases.”   Further, Dr. Arora 
acknowledged that Pulawa’s tinnitus condition was capable of 
improvement. He stated that  better control of Pulawa’s 
throbbing headaches, which “aggravate and exacerbate his 
tinnitus to a great extent,” would lead to reduced tinnitus 
symptoms.  Dr. Arora left unanswered  why amitriptyline 
medication qualified for treatment of the tinnitus, but the 
neuromonics device  did not.   Dr. Arora ventured agreement   with 
Dr. Mauro that the   neuromonics device “would be of questionable 
value and benefit to Mr. Pulawa for treatment of his tinnitus.” He did not directly address the opinions of Dr. Shih and Dr. 
16
   
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
LIRAB heard testimony at the hearing from Pulawa and 
Dr. Scott McCaffrey  that was  contrary to Dr. Arora’s report . 
They testified in support of Pulawa’s  request for the 
neuromonics device and for the continuation of TTD benefits.  
Pulawa testified that he was not able to work with his h  eadaches 
and tinnitus. He stated that the primary ailments that remain 
from the accident include heavy throbbi ng and “head pains” along 
with ringing in the ears.   Pulawa confirmed that he had seen 
several specialists since the accident for his headaches,  
tinnitus, and depression. Regarding his tinnitus, Pulawa ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Patterson recommending the neuromonics device for treatment of 
Pulawa’s tinnitus. 
Having found that Pulawa suffered from tinnitus; that 
it was capable of improvement with medication; and that 
continuing treatment for tinnitus, depression, and headaches was 
necessary, Dr. Arora recommended Pulawa seek a one-time 
consultation with a “Dr. Raskin” at the University of California 
at San Francisco, who was a specialist in headaches.  Though 
this analysis does not connote medical stability, Dr. Arora 
nonetheless determined that Pulawa’s condition was medically 
stable. 
2. LIRAB Affirms the Director’s March 30, 2009 Decision 
17
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
18 confirmed that he was prescribed oral medication and a noise-
masking device, but these treatments were unsuccessful.   
  Dr. Scott McCaffrey, Pulawa’s attending physician at 
the time of the hearing,  testified that he did not believe 
Pulawa was medically stable.  Dr. McCaffrey explained that his 
office was addressing injuries to Pulawa’s neck and lower back 
that were not treated by previous doctors , Pulawa’s tinnitus was 
still untreated, and he was receiving treatment for emotional 
problems.  Dr. McCaffrey noted  that tinnitus is a very difficult 
problem and that “no one has found a cure,” although he stated 
that there are medications that show  promise in clinical 
studies.  No witnesses testified in sup port of the Director’s 
decision denying the neuromonics  device and terminating Pulawa’s 
TTD payments.   
  LIRAB affirmed the Director’s decision  denying Pulawa 
the neuromonics device and terminating his TTD payments in its 
November 2, 2011 Decision  and Order.  It made no finding as to 
whether the neuromonics  device was reasonably needed for 
Pulawa’s greatest  possible rehabil itation, although it did opine 
that the neuromonics device was not “reasonable or necessary” 
medical care.7 
                     
7  As discussed infra, in its Decision and Order, LIRAB incorrectly 
applied “reasonable and necessary” as the  standard to determine Pulawa’s 
request for the neuromonics device:  
(continued . . .)    
 
  
  
  
   
  Accordingly, LIRAB concluded that the neuromonics  
device was not “reasonable or  necessary” medical care, that 
                                                                  
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
In affirming the Director’s  termination of TTD 
payments, LIRAB credited Dr. Mauro’s opinion that  Pulawa ’s  
medical condition was stable    and   that although he would have some  
difficulty returning to his job as a construction supervisor, he 
was capable of returning to gainful employment.    
LIRAB found that Pulawa’s 
testimony supported his 
ability to return to work.  It emphasized Pulawa’s testimony 
regarding his ability to operate a vehicle, his visits to Ala 
Moana Beach Park three days a week, and his ability to care for

  In its Summary Disposition Order, the ICA affirmed  
LIRAB’s  Decision and Order. Pulawa v. Oahu Constr. Co., Ltd.  , 
No. CAAP-11-0001019, 2014 WL 5503365 (App. Oct. 30, 2014)  (SDO).   
The ICA rejected Pulawa’s position that he was entitled to the 
neuromonics device for  treatment of his  tinnitus condition  under 
HRS §§ 386-21(a) and 386 -24.   Id. at *3.    Giving deference to 
LIRAB’s determination of credibility between the contrasting 
doctor’s opinions as to the need for the neuromonics device, the 
ICA affirmed denial of the device. Id.

Pulawa was not certified as temporarily and totally disabled, 
that Pulawa was medically stable, and that Oahu Construction was 
entitled to a credit for TTD payments paid between December 17, 
2008 and December 30, 2008 to be applied to the future award of 
permanent disability benefits. Pulawa appealed to the ICA.  
D. ICA Appeal 
The ICA 
also held that LIRAB properly terminated 
Pulawa’s TTD payments. Id. at *4-5. The ICA reasoned that 
under HRS §§ 386-1 and 386-31(b), TTD payments are terminated 
“upon order of the director or if the employee is able to resume 
work.” Id. 
at *3 (citation omitted) (internal quotation mark 
omitted). Accordingly, the “able to resume work” definition 
required that Pulawa’s injury was stable and that Pulawa was 
capable of working “in an occupation for which [he] has received

previous training or for which [he] has demonstrated aptitude.” 
Id. at *4-5 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks 
omitted). The ICA held that LIRAB’s determination regarding 
Pulawa’s medical stability and his ability to return to work was 
not clearly erroneous. Id. at *5.  In this regard, the ICA 
pointed to the physician reports opining that Pulawa’s condition 
was stable and that he could return to work with his injury’s 
limitations. Id.
 The ICA concluded that these reports amounted 
to substantial evidence supporting Pulawa’s injury stabilit y and 
his ability to return to work. Id.  
II. Standards of Review 
A. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law 
Appellate review of a LIRAB decision is governed by 
HRS § 91- 14(g) (1993), which states that: 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case with 
instructions for further proceedings; or it may 
reverse or modify the decision and order if the 
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been 
prejudiced because the administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders are: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory 
provisions; or 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or 
jurisdiction of the agency; or 
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or 
(4) Affected by other error of law; or 
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, 
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or 
21
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
[Conclusions of Law]  are freely reviewable to 
determine if the agency’s decision was in violation 
of constitutional or statutory provisions, in excess 
of statutory authority or jurisdiction of agency, or 
affected by other error of law.

(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by

of discretion. 
We have previously stated: 
[Findings of Fact] are reviewable under the clearly 
erroneous standard to determine if the agency 
decision was clearly e
rroneous in view of reliable, 
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record. 
A [Conclusion of Law] that presents mixed questions 
of fact and law is reviewed under the clearly 
erroneous standard because the conclusion is dependent upon the facts and circumstances 
of the 
particular case. When mixed questions of law and fact are presented, an appellate court must give 
deference to the agency ’s expertise and experience in 
the particular field. The court should not 
substitute its own judgment for that of the agency.

III.  Discussion 
A.	 The Neuromonics Device Was an Aid “Reasonably Needed for 
the Employee’s Greatest Possible Medical Rehabilitation” 
9	   From the language of LIRAB ’s decision, “reasonable and necessary”  
and “reasonable or necessary” appear to be used interch angeably. This court  
will apply the “reasonably needed” standard set forth in HRS §§ 386  -21(a) and 
386-24 to determine whether Pulawa is entitled to the neuromonics device.   
10	 HRS § 386-21(a) (1993) states as follows: 
Immediately after a work injury sustained by an 
employee and so long as reasonably needed the 
employer shall furnish to the employee all medical care, services, and supplies as the nature of the 
injury requires. The liability for the medical care, 
services, and supplies shall be subject to the 
deductible under section 386 -100.

services, and supplies,” requires that “[i]mmediately after a 
work injury sustained by an employee and so long as reasonably 
needed
 the employer shall furnish to the employee all medical 
care, services, and supplies as the nature of the injury 
requires.”11 (Emphasis added). In addition to medical treatment 
for injury, an employee is entitled to medical services and 
supplies reasonably needed for the employee’s greatest possible 
medical rehabilitation.  HRS § 386-24,   12 titled “[m]edical 
rehabilitation,” states that “ [t]he medical services and 
supplies to which an employee suffering a work injury is 
entitled shall include such services, aids, appliances, 
apparatus, and supplies as are reasonably needed  for the 
employee’s greatest possible medical rehabilitation.” (Emphases 
added). 
11 In 1963, the Hawai i workers’ compensation statute was amended for 
the purpose of, inter alia , “mak[ing] changes necessary to eliminate 
unnecessary hardships and inequities, . . . and mak[ing] certain major and 
minor substantive improvements in the provisions governing workmen’s 
compensation.” S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 334, 
in 1963 Senate Journal, at 788. 
12 HRS § 386-24 (1993) states as follows: 
The medical services and supplies to which an employee suffering  a work injury is entitled shall 
include such services, aids, appliances, apparatus, 
and supplies as are reasonably needed for the 
employee’s greatest possible medical rehabilitation. 
The director of labor and industrial relations, on 
competent medical advice, shall determine the need 
for or sufficiency of medical rehabilitation services 
furnished or to be furnished to the employee and may 
order any needed change of physician, hospital or 
rehabilitation facility.

  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
LIRAB and the Director rejected the neuromonics device 
based on a standard more strict than allowed by statute: 
“reasonable and necessary .” As noted , HRS §§ 386-21(a) and 386­
24 require application of a “reasonably needed” standard. The term “reasonably needed” is not defined by statute, but it is 
less restrictive than the “reasonable and necessary” standard 
used by LIRAB.
13 
Additionally, t he “greatest possible medical 
rehabilitation” language in HRS § 386-24 lends a definition to 
“reasonably needed” that is significantly more br oad than 
“reasonable and necessary.” See HRS § 1-16 (2009) (“Laws in 
pari materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall be 
construed with reference to each other. What is clear in one 
statute may be called in aid to explain what is doubtful in 
another.”); State v. Casugay-Badiang, 130 Hawai ʻi 21, 27, 305 
P.3d 437, 443 (2013) (same).  The words “greatest” and 
“possible” define the high degree of medical assistance due an 
injured employee. The statute does not say merely “possible” 
medical rehabilitation; nor does it state simply “employee’s 
medical rehabilitation.” Thus, aid that can provide the

is “absolutely needed” or “required” —a stricter definition than merely

“greatest possible” medical rehabilitation for a claimant is 
“reasonably needed” absent substantial evidence to the contrary.  
Viewed under 
the reasonably needed standard as 
properly applied, LIRAB clearly erred because “the record lacks 
substantial evidence to support the finding” that the 
neuromonics device was not reasonably needed for Pulawa’s 
greatest possible medical rehabilitation. See In re Water Use  
Permit Applications , 94 Hawai
i at 119, 9 P.3d at 431. Our court 
has defined substantial evidence as “ credible evidence which is 
of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion. ” Id. (citations 
omitted) (internal quotation mark omitted).  The reports of Dr. 
Goodyear, Mauro, and Arora, credited by LIRAB, do not constitute 
substantial evidence supporting a finding that the neuromonics 
device was not reasonably needed to treat Pulawa’s tinnitus for 
his greatest possible medical rehabilitation. None of the three opined that the device is not reasonably needed. Dr. Goodyear 
never explicitly mentioned the neuromonics device to reach his 
conclusion that any further treatment would not lead to Pulawa reporting an improvement in symptoms.  Dr. Mauro conceded he was 
not aware of whether the device is an accepted standard of 
treatment or whether it is available for Pulawa in Hawai i; and 
his observation that he experienced little enthusiasm about the 
26
   
 
  
 
  
 
  
   
 
  
  
   
 
 
     
 
 
                     
   
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
device’s utility in treating Pulawa’s tinnitus cannot qualify as 
substantial evidence the device is not reasonably needed for 
Pulawa’s greatest possible medical rehabilitation . Finally, 
while Dr. Arora expressed “serious doubt” that the use of the neuromonics device “would be of any benefit ,” without further 
analysis, he merely agreed with Dr. Mauro that the device has “questionable value and benefit.” Significantly, the three 
doctors had no experience with the device. 
In contrast, Dr. Shih’s opinion was based upon 
experience with the neuromonics device and medical expertise 
specifically related to studying and treating diseases and 
disorders of the ear: otology and neurotology. Pulawa was 
referred by Dr. Patterson, the Director of the Casa Colina brain 
injury treatment program, to Dr. Shih because she specialized in 
otology and neurotology.  In her opinion, the neuromonics device 
could be beneficial to treat Pulawa’s tinnitus , although it was 
a relatively new treatment.
14 
Thus, the ICA’s deference to LIRAB was based on a 
false factual assumption that “there were varying opinions among 
the physicians as to whether a Neuromonics device was 
‘reasonably needed.’” Pulawa, SDO, 2014 WL 5503365, at *2.  In 
actuality, as discussed supra, no physician mentioned whether 
14 Her recommendation was of such significance to Dr. Patterson that 
he arranged to have Pulawa fitted for the device. 
27
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
  
  
  
   
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
the device was “reasonably needed;” nor did LIRAB address 
whether the device was “reasonably needed.” 
The nature of Pulawa’s injury and his treatment 
history also establish a need to augment, albeit with a new 
method, 14 years of unsuccessful strategies to treat his 
tinnitus. After his traumatic brain injury, he underwent 
rehabilitative therapy, medications with varying side effects, 
injections in his neck, and a five month treatment regimen in 
California without relief from his tinnitus. He was also 
treated for tinnitus with a noise-masking device to no avail.  
Conventional, approved treatment regimens have thus failed. A 
new device designed to treat his ailment is now available as a 
treatment option. 
Thus, properly applied —and based on the evidence 
before LIRAB—the “reasonably needed” standard enumerated in HRS 
§§ 386-21(a) and 386-24 compels a finding that Pulawa’s claim 
for the neuromonics device be granted in order for him to attain 
the “greatest possible medical rehabilitation.” 
B.	 The Record Lacks Substantial Evidence that Pulawa Is Stable 
and Able To Resume Work 
The Director and LIRAB determined that Pulawa was no 
longer entitled to TTD payments because he is “capable of 
resuming some form of full-time work.” The statutory definition 
of “able to resume work” requires that Pulawa’s injury 
28
   
 
                      
      
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
“stabilized after a period of recovery” and that he “is capable 
of performing work in an occupation for which [he] has received 
previous training or for which [he] has demonstrated aptitude” 
prior to the termination of TTD payments. HRS § 386-1 (Supp.   
15  2005).  As discussed supra , LIRAB’s finding —affirmed by the 
ICA—that Pulawa was not entitled to the neuromonics device was  
clearly erroneous.  Based on the present posture of the record, 
until Pulawa receives the opportunity  for the greatest possible 
medical rehabilitation with the neuromonics device, his  benefits 
16 should not be terminated.   Accordingly, Pulawa is entitled to 
reinstatement of TTD payments  until he has had a reasonable 
15 HRS § 386-31(b) (Supp. 2005) states that employers can terminate 
TTD payments “upon order of the director or if the employee is able to resume 
work.” 
16 Dr. Scott McCaff rey, Pulawa’s treating physician at the time of 
the hearing before LIRAB, testified that Pulawa was not medically stable due 
to, inter alia , his tinnitus: 
Well I do not believe he is [medically stable] for the 
following reasons, we’re still worki ng up his complaints 
and pains that he has in his neck and his low back and have 
found some structural damage to those two areas; areas 
which by the way I don’t think were addressed much in the 
many years prior to his coming to see us, because his 
primary injury was a very severe head injury as you know  
.  . . above and beyond that  he has ongoing significant 
complaints of ringing in his ears, or tinnitus,  headaches, 
post injury headaches which may be implicated by the neck 
as well which is one reason we’re pursuing the neck cause  
[sic] it can drive headaches in addition to primary  
injuries to the skull.  Also he’s been struggling with 
emotional problems re lated to the injury; I believe he’s 
got a traumatic brain injury picture where he’s not —he 
doesn’t think as well as he did and that plus the pain plus all the impairment has resulted in a depression[.]

opportunity to receive treatment for his tinnitus with the

the ICA’s December 16, 2014 
Judgment on Appeal and the November 2, 2011 Decision and Order of the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board are vacated.
