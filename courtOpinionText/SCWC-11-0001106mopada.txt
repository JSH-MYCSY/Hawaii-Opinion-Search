compensation benefits for a mental stress injury suffered by a 
former employee of the State of Hawai‘ i  Department of Land & 
Natural Resources ( “DLNR”). Specifically, Juliana J. Zhang

CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS  
(CAAP-11-0001106; CASE NO. AB
-2003-365 (2-94-41072)) 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.,

I. Introduction  
 
  As to the first issue, we hold that, based on  Panoke v. 
Reef Development of Hawaii, Inc. , 136 Hawai ‘i 448, 363 P.3d 296 
(2015), the LIRAB erred in denying Zhang ’s  temporary total 
disability benefits after May 5, 2004 based solely on 
deficiencies in the certifications of disability submitted by 
Zhang’s physician. As to the second issue, although it appears  
Zhang correctly asser  ts that she was authorized to continue   
                         
    
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
(1) she is not entitled to retroactive temporary total 
disability benefits from May 5, 2004 to the present  due to 
deficiencies in her physicians’ certifications of disability , 
and (2) she was not terminated from employment solely due to her 
filing of this workers’ compensation claim , which would  
constitute a violation of Hawai ‘i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 386-
1  142 (1993).
1 HRS § 386- 142 provide d then and now as follows: 
It shall be unlawful for any employer to suspend or 
discharge any employee solely because the employee suffers 
any work injury which is compensable under this chapter and 
which arises out of and in the course of employment with 
the employer unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the director that the employee will no longer be capable of 
performing the employee’ s work as a result of the work 
injury and that the employer has no other available work which the employee is capable of performing. Any employee 
who is suspended or discharged because of such work injury 
shall be given first preference of reemployment by the 
employer in any position which the employee is capable of 
performing and which becomes available after the suspension 
or discharge and during the period thereafter until the 
employee secures new employment. This section shall not apply to the United States or to employers subject to part 
III of chapter 378.

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
working in the United States  at the time of her July 27, 1994 
termination by DLNR, the LIRAB did not err in ruling that   Zhang 
was not terminated solely due to her filing o f a workers’ 
compensation claim, in violation of HRS § 386-142.  As argued by 
DLNR, res judicata principles preclude the finding sought by  
Zhang because the circuit court found in  her prior lawsuit that   
Zhang had been terminated from  employment because of DLNR’s 
belief that Zhang had failed to submit documents necessary for 
the extension of her work authorization.  The judgment 
incorporating this finding was not appealed, giving it 
preclusive effect, which prohibits a finding that Zhang was  
terminated solely due to her filing of this workers’ compensation claim.  
We therefore vacat
e in part the Intermediate Court of 
Appeals’ (“ICA”) October 24, 2014 Judgment on Appeal and the 
LIRAB’s December 6, 2011 Decision and Order , and remand the case 
to the LIRAB for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion. 
II. Background 
A. Background 
Zhang is an electrical engineer originally from the 
People’s Republic of China , who fled to the United States in 
1990 with her former husband.  Zhang entered the United States 
as the spouse of a Chinese student permitted to work pursuant to 
3
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Executive Order 12711 of 1990, which granted Chinese nationals 
who were in the United States after June 5, 1989 employment 
authorization through January 1, 1994. See  Exec. Order No. 
12711 § 3, 55 Fed. Reg. 13897 (April 11, 1990). 
On June 24, 1992, Zhang 
began working for DLNR on a 
renewable annual contract basis, checking engineering aspects of water project proposals. Upon beginning employment, she filled 
out the requisite United States (“ U.S.”) Department of Justice, 
Immigration and Naturalization Serv ice (“INS”) Form I-9 to 
verify her employment eligibility. Pursuant to the INS’s 
“Handbook for Employers” in effect at the time, an employer was 
required to verify an incoming employee’s employment 
authorization by having a new employee submit either a document 
from List A, which would establish both identity and employment 
eligibility (such as a U.S. passport), or one document from List 
B to establish identity (such as a state driver’s license) and 
one document from List C to establish employment eligibility (such as a U.S. Social Security Number Card (“Social Security 
Card”) other than one reflecting “ not valid for employment”). 
Zhang submitted a Hawai‘ i Driver’s License valid until May 
16, 1995 and a standard Social Security Card, which did not contain a statement that it was not valid for employment. In 
the Form I-9, she also completed a box attesting that she was an 
“alien authorized to work until 01/01/94 ” under a specific alien 
4
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
or admission number as provided by Executive Order 12711 of 
1990. Effective October 19, 1992, however, Executive Order 
12711 was superseded by the Chinese Student Protection Act of 
1992, Pub. L. No. 102-404, 106 Stat. 1969 (“CSPA”). The CSPA 
allowed Chinese nationals in the United States subject to Executive Order 12711 to apply for an adjustment to legal 
permanent resident status. CSPA § 2(a)(1) also specifically 
provided that upon application for adjustment of status, the 
Chinese national would be “deemed approved.”  CSPA, Pub. L. No. 
102-404, § 2, 106 Stat. at 1969. 
Around March of 1993, a permanent position became available 
at DLNR, and Zhang’s direct supervisors appa rently encouraged 
her to apply. Also, apparently pursua nt to Zhang’s request, in 
May of 1993, DLNR drafted an H-1B petition to have Zhang 
classified as a temporary non-immigrant in a specialty 
occupation for a three year employment period. It appears, 
however, that although DLNR thought this petition had been submitted, it had not. 
It also appears that Zhang learned about passage of the 
CSPA because on June 30, 1993, she submitted a Form I-485 to the 
INS to apply for an adjustment of her status to that of a legal 
permanent resident. Although pursuant to the CSPA, she 
apparently may have been “deemed approved” upon submission of 
5
  
 
  
   
  
 
   
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
her adjustment application, on October 8, 1993, she called the 
INS to inquire about the status of this application, and was 
informed it was still pending. From that date to December 15, 
1993, Zhang visited the Honolulu INS office twice to follow up, 
but the INS said there had been no change in status. On 
December 15, 1993, Zhang wrote to the INS to inquire about the 
status of her application. On January 28, 1994, the INS 
responded that her application was still pending.  As noted 
above, however, the CSPA provided that upon submission of her 
application for adjustment of status, Zhang’s adjustment of 
status to legal permanent resident had been “deemed approved.” 
According to Zhang, she had not received any negative 
feedback or evaluations, but it appears that by early 1994, DLNR 
had some concerns regarding her work.  DLNR Deputy Director Rae 
Loui (“Loui”) met with Zhang on March 18, 1994 to discuss her 
work hours, and on March 28, 1994, sent Zhang a memorandum, the 
purpose of which was “to make clear your work hours, name of supervisor, and our expectations.” The memorandum informed 
Zhang that: (1) her work hours, per her request, were 8:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m., with two 15 minute coffee breaks and one 45 minute 
lunch break; (2) because her previous supervisor was on loan to 
another organization, her direct supervisor was David Higa and 
that Higa’s supervisor was Ed Sakoda; (3) she was to keep 
6
  
 
   
 
 
 
  
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
personal calls to a minimum and was not allowed to sell stamps 
during work hours; and (4) she would need to clock in her time 
four times per day. This memorandum was apparently triggered by 
complaints from Zhang’s co -workers. 
Zhang’s union, the Hawai‘i Government Employees Association 
(“HGEA”), filed a step 1 grievance on her behalf on April 25, 
1994, then a step 2 grievance on May 27, 1994, alleging that the 
requirements placed on Zhang were discriminatory, arbitrary, and 
capricious, and demanding a rescission and expungement of the 
memorandum as well as a stop to “this type of discrimination in 
the workplace.” 
On May 25, 1994, Zhang’s supervisor allegedly told her he 
would be giving her both verbal and written warnings if he heard 
any more complaints about her. 
On June 22, 1994, Zhang orally reported a worker’s 
compensation mental stress type injury to DLNR,  and went to see  
physician Dr. Nola Mirikitani (“Dr. Mirikitani”) for the first 
time. Dr. Mirikitani diagnosed Zhang  with major depression , 
certified her as disabled as of June 22, 1994, and noted that 
Zhang would be able to return to regular work  on July 6, 1994.   
In the WC-2 Physicians’ Report Dr. Mirikitani prepared, she noted a date of injury/illness of “03/?/94,” noted that the work 
injury was the only cause of Zhang’s condition, certified Zhang as disabled as of June 22, 1994, indicated  a need for further 
7
  
 
  
 
 
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
medical rehabilitation, and noted that Zhang would be able to 
return to regular work on July 6, 1994. 
On June 27, 1994, Zhang faxed an HGEA Unit 13 step 1 labor 
grievance form to DLNR’s Higa concerning the May 25, 1994 
incident, asserting Higa had made the statement in retaliation 
for the previous grievance Zhang had brought, and requested that 
the statement be rescinded. Zhang returned to work on June 28, 
1994, despite Dr. Mirikitani’s July 1, 1994 WC -2 stating that 
Zhang could return to work on July 6th.  Zhang obtained workers’ 
compensation forms on that day; Dr. Miritani’s office faxed in a 
work excuse for June 22nd to the 28th. 
On June 28, 1994,  DLNR Chair Keith Ahue (“DLNR Chair Ahue”) 
wrote to HGEA, agreeing to rescind the March 28,  1994 memo 
changing Zhang’s work schedule, and ruling in favor of HGEA’s previous grievance that alleged unfair changes to Zhang’s work 
schedule. On June 30, 1994, Loui wrote a “courtesy reminder” to Zhang, stating that her limited term employment would end on September 30, 1994. Soon thereafter, HGEA filed a step 1 
grievance regarding this letter, alleging that the “courtesy 
reminder” was “disciplinary, and in retaliation for her having 
filed other grievances in the past.” On June 30, 1994, Higa 
sent a letter to Zhang via certified mail, stating that her June 
27, 1994 grievance would not be considered because it had been

made more than twenty days after the alleged May 25, 1994 
incident, in contravention of the grievance procedure in the 
Unit 13 Contract Agreement (“CBA”), which required that a 
grievance be submitted within twenty working days.2 
On July 1, 1994, Zhang sought treatment from Dr. Mirikitani 
for a second time. Zhang said she had been back at work for 
three days without problems until the day before, when she 
received a letter that her position would not be renewed in the 
fall due to budget cuts. She had called in sick that day, said 
she was unable to function and that she had an attorney. She 
said she still felt tired, although her headaches were not as 
bad. She also spent a great deal of time worrying about a 
change in date for her return to work slip. Dr. Mirikitani 
continued Zhang on anti-depressant medication, and noted she 
could return to work on July 8, 1994. 
On July 1, 1994, DLNR prepared a WC-1 Employer’s Report of 
Industrial Injury, noting that Zhang had sustained a stress-related injury allegedly as “a result of mental stress and 
pressure caused by work supervisors and brought about by a hostile work environment[,]” checked “Yes” to “Is Liability

Denied,” but noted “Pending Investigation” as to “If Liability 
Denied—Why?”3 
Zhang saw Dr. Mirikitani again on July 8, 1994. Dr. 
Mirikitani changed Zhang’s medication, and noted that Zhang 
should minimize contact with others and could return to work in 
one week. Also on that day, Zhang prepared a WC-5 Employee’s 
Claim for Workers’ Compensation Benefits, describing her work 
injury as headache, fatigue, dizziness, failure to concentrate 
due to mental stress, subsequent insomnia, loss of appetite, and 
weight loss. 
On July 5, 1994, DLNR personnel officer Melvin Young 
(“Young”) reviewed Zhang’s files to ascertain her employment 
eligibility status. Although Young later represented that this 
review was a part of a routine review to reverify the employment 
eligibility and work authorization of DLNR’s alien employees, 
Young later admitted that only Zhang’s records had been 
reviewed. Then on  July 18, 1994, Young wrote to Zhang, stating 
that her employment authorization had only been granted until 
January 1, 1994, and asking that she contact the INS, to submit   
On July 8, 1997, this court held in Mitchell v. DOE, 85 Hawai ‘i 
250, 942 P.2d 514 (1997), that a stress -related injury caused by a 
disciplinary action within the course of employment is compensable under 
workers’ compensation law. Pursuant to Act 224 of 1998, the Legislature 
added HRS § 386- 3(c), generally excluding mental stress resulting solely from 
good faith disciplinary actions from the workers’ compensation scheme. 1998 
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 224, § 2 at 768.

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
documents showing extension of her visa and employment 
authorization by July 25, 1994. Also on that date, Higa 
prepared a job evaluation report for Zhang for the three month 
period of April through June 1994, finding her “Not quite 
satisfactory” for “Quantity of Work on the Job” and “Work Attitudes on the Job.” 
At a July 22, 1994 meeting with Young, Zhang therefore 
submitted (1) a copy of a December 15, 1993 letter from Zhang to the INS inquiring of the status of her Form I-485 for adjustment 
to permanent resident status, and (2) a January 18, 1994 
response from the INS indicating that her application was still 
pending. Zhang followed up on the July 22, 1994 meeting with a 
letter that day, stating that her documents showed there were no 
problems regarding her work authorization, asking that Young not 
contact the INS directly regarding her status, expressing her 
opinion that Young’s July 18, 1994 letter was a continuation of 
harassment, and asking that any further inquiries be memorialized in case her explanation and documentation had not 
been sufficient. 
Young responded via letter dated July 25, 1994, asserting 
that none of Zhang’s documents provided the required information 
or related to an approval of her work authorization beyond 
January 1, 1994, and informing Zhang that she would be

 According to Zhang, on July 25, 1994 at 4:45 p.m., she was 
planning to work late when Higa told her she needed to leave at 
5:00 p.m. When asked why, he allegedly said his supervisor, 
Eric Hirano, told him to tell her to leave at 5:00 p.m., 
otherwise he would give her a reprimand. When she asked why 
only she needed to leave, Higa allegedly went to Hirano’s 
office, then returned at 4:57 p.m. and said that everyone must 
leave at 5:00 p.m. 
 
  
  
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
terminated if the requested documentation was not received by 
July 27, 1994. 
Zhang returned to Dr. Mirikitani on July 26, 1994, noting 
that she had been working since July 11, but had an argument 
with her supervisor the day before, had been criticized for 
working late, felt discriminated against, had not been able to 
sleep the night before, and had called in sick that day. She 
stated she was having difficulty doing work when harassed, and 
was worried about paying for her medical expenses. Dr. Mirikitani diagnosed major depression, noting a “no win 
situation for pt.” She counselled Zhang to settle her 
grievances. Zhang responded that she was taking steps to do so, 
but that the process would take time, and expressed an honest 
desire to work. On that day, Dr. Mirikitani prepared a 
certificate to return to work noting that Zhang “is able to 
return to work on 8/1/94.”

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Also on July 26, 1994, a hearing took place in Loui’s 
office attended by Loui, Hirano, and then-HGEA Field Services 
Officer Randy Perreira (“Perreira”) regarding the step 1 
grievance HGEA had filed on behalf of Zhang with respect to Loui’s June 30, 1994 letter. During that hearin g, Perreira 
apparently asserted that the June 30, 1994 letter had been improperly placed in Zhang’s personnel file in violation of 
4Article 16 of the CBA.
Also on July 26, 1994, Zhang wrote to Young, submitting 
additional “documentation required according to the INS rules 
that verify [Zhang’s] work and immigration status.” Zhan g 
explained that an INS agent Paul Fereza (“Fereza”) indicated to 
her that her check written with her application for extension of 
her work authorization qualifies as a receipt, and therefore is 
sufficient until authorization is received. 
Despite this, Zhang, Hirano, and possibly also Young went 
to the INS office on this or the next date to clarify Zhang’s work authorization status.  It appears that DLNR was focused on  
4 During the hearing, Loui stated that the letter was only a 
“courtesy reminder,” and was not placed in Zhang’s file, and Hirano confirmed 
this statement. Given these assurances and a confirming letter from Loui to 
HGEA dated July 27, 1994, which also stated that the June 30, 1994 letter had 
been sent to provide Zhang with the same ninety day notice provided to 
regular employees facing a pending reduction in force or layoff, this charge 
was not pressed further. When Zhang reviewed her personnel file after her termination, however, Loui’s June 30, 1994 “courtesy reminder” let ter was in 
her personnel file. 
13
  
 
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
the H-1B it had prepared in May 1993, which apparently had never 
been submitted. In a July 28, 1994 memorandum to INS agent  
Fereza, Hirano explained that DLNR had no additional information 
on Zhang’s H-1B petition for a non-immigrant visa.  A notation 
on that memorandum indicates that Ferreza called back to say 
that the INS was also unable to find any records on an H-1B 
petition for Zhang.  Young then wrote to Zhang   later that day, 
stating that DLNR’s review of the documents submitted showed 
that Zhang still did not have proper INS employment 
authorization after January 1, 1994, and that she was terminated 
effective close of business on July 27, 1994 “as stipulated in 
our memorandum to you dated July 25, 1994.” Thus, July 27, 1994 
was Zhang’s last day of work at DLNR.  
On August 2, 1994, HGEA wrote to DLNR Chair Ahue, 
expressing dissatisfaction with the handling of the first s
tep 
grievance it had filed on behalf of Zhang. According to this 
letter, Zhang had been notified by letter dated June 30, 1994 that her employment would be terminated September 30, 1994. 
HGEA alleged that DLNR’s decision to not renew Zhang’s 
employment was in retaliation for Zhang having filed grievances 
against DLNR, and was the culmination of a pattern of 
harassment. HGEA demanded her reinstatement. 
14
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
On August 4, 1994, Zhang wrote to the State of Hawai ‘i 
Department of Human Resources Development, State Workers’ 
Compensation Division, requesting  
an immediate hearing regarding the denial of my workers’ 
compensation benefits by Melvin Young, Personnel Office, Dept. of Land and Natural Resources. The HGEA supports my 
contention that Rae Loui, Deputy Director of DLNR and other 
management personnel have cohorted [sic] to put extreme 
pressure on me at my work. Since my original WC claim, the 
harassment and discrimination has [sic] escalated, to the point of Melvin Young terminating me on July 27, 1994. 
This termination is illegal according to Federal Law, and 
will be investigated by the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) 
Dept. of Justice in Washington, D.C. which investigates 
National Origin discrimination cases, the Hawaii Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Hawaii Civil 
Rights Commission and HGEA Union #13. 
Zhang further alleged that “Rae Loui, Melvin Young, Eric Hirano, 
and David Higa of DLNR have caused [her] extreme stress and although [she] tried to work through it, it just became 
unbearable . . . .”  
Zhang saw Dr. Mirikitani again on Au
gust 5, 1994.  Despite 
the initial denial of compensability, Dr. Mirikitani continued 
to treat Zhang’s depression as work -related. 
On August 10, 1994, Zhang wrote to Young, enclosing a 
photocopy of a Department of Justice Employment Authorization Card issued on that date. Zhang requested immediate 
reinstatement, but was not reinstated. 
After her termination, Zhang also sought treatment with 
psychologist Dr. Rosemarie Adam-Terem (“Dr. Adam-Terem”), who 
she first saw on August 17, 1994. Dr. Adam-Terem diagnosed major depression and generalized anxiety disorder, and 
15
  
 
   
  
 
 
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
recommended continued therapy. Thereafter, Zhang continued 
treatment with both Drs. Mirikitani and Adam-Terem. 
B.	 1994 to 2006: Preliminary Decisions of the Director and 
Circuit Court Complaint 
By decision dated December 15, 1994, the Director of the 
Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (“Director”) 
determined that Zhang suffered a compensable work-related stress 
injury. By supplemental decision dated April 28, 1995, the 
Director awarded Zhang temporary total disability  benefits from 
June 25, 1994.  
In the meantime, on August 5, 1994, Zhang had filed charges 
of employment discrimination with the U.S. Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission and the Hawai‘ i Civil Rights Commission.  
On August 31, DLNR responded to the Department of Justice, 
asserting that Zhang had not been discriminated against, and 
that the sole reason for her termination was her alleged failure 
to provide necessary work authorization documentation. 
A complaint was then filed on Zhang’s behalf on July 26, 
1996 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (“circuit 
court”), Civil No. 96-3117-07, alleging ancestry and national 
origin discrimination and retaliation. A bench trial took place 
before the circuit court in June 1998. The circuit court’s July 
23, 1998 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order and 
August 14, 1998 Judgment (“Judgment”), concluded  that Zhang’s 
16
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
termination was not based on ancestry or national origin 
discrimination and retaliation, and was   also not based on 
retaliation for the filing of grievances.  The Judgment was not 
appealed. 
The circuit court entered the following findings of fact 
directly relevant to this appeal:  
1.	 That [Zhang] is a Chinese National who was allowed to 
enter and work within the State of 
Hawaii pursuant to  
an “executive order” “work exemption” which was to expire in January of 1994.  
2.	 That [Zhang] was hired by the State of 
Hawaii in June 
of 1992.  [Zhang] was hired as a civil engineer by 
the [DLNR] on a temporary basis, renewable on a 
yearly basis. 
3.	 That [Zhang] recognized her temporary work status within the State of Hawaii, and as such, she sought 
to extend or eliminate this temporary status by various means. 
4.	 That one means of extending or eliminating this 
temporary work status was by way of an H -1B petition.  
The petition required sponsorship and [Zhang] sought 
sponsorship from [DLNR]. 
5.	 That as a result of [Zhang’s] request for 
sponsorship, [] Loui had questions and concerns as to 
some of the inquiries contained within the H -1B 
petition. As such , [] Loui memorialized her 
questions and concerns in Exhibit 9. The questions and concerns contained within Exhibit 9 were not 
generated as a result of [] Loui’s meeting with the 
FBI or as a means of finding a “legal way to 
discriminate” against [Zhang] “on the basis of 
national origin”. 
6.	 That the expiration of [Zhang’s] work status was noted by [] Hirano a few months after the expiration 
date.  [] Hirano notified [] Young of this 
expiration. 
7.	 That it was []  Hirano and Young’s impression that

the expiration of [Zhang’s] work authorization in a 
timely  fashion.  As such, [Hirano and Young] sought  
to remedy the matter by seeking, what they believed 
to be, the necessary documents  from [Zhang].

8.	 That [Zhang] submitted, what she thought to be, the 
necessary documents to [] Young. [ ] 
9.	 That it was [] Young’ s position that [Zhang] did not 
submit the documents which were necessary for the 
extension of her work authorization. As such, 
[Zhang] was terminated from her employment with 
[DLNR].

13.	 That there is no credible evidence to support a 
finding that [Zhang’s] termination from employment [] 
was based upon her “national origin”. [sic] 
. . . . 
18.	 That [Zhang] did fil e “grievances” against [] Louie 
for some of the “acts ” [Zhang] was required to do. 
The record does not support a finding that [Zhang’s ] 
termination was a result of the filing of these 
grievances. 
19.	 That [Zhang] did file charges of “discrimination” . . . . However, the timing of the filing of these 
charges and termination of [Zhang] does not support a 
finding that [Zhang’s] termi nation was based upon 
retaliation for the filing of “discrimination” charges. 
20.	 That [Zhang] has failed to meet her burden in 
presenting the Court with credible evidence that 
provides a “link” between her termination and her 
allegations that it was based upon “national origin” 
and/or for “retaliatory” purposes. 
DLNR continued to pay Zhang temporary total disability  
benefits and medical costs through 2003.  Zhang continued 
treatment for depression with Dr. Mirikitani through at least 1997, and with Dr.  Adam-Terem through 2003.   
Zhang underwent an independent medical examination ( “IME”) 
with 	DLNR’s physician, Dr. John Stretzler (“Dr. Stretzler”), on 
August 1, 2002. On August 8, 2002, Dr. Stretzler opined that Zhang did not have a mental disorder, and diagnosed her with a

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
pre-existing “Paranoid Personality Disorder with Narcissistic 
Traits.” Zhang requested vocational rehabilitation services on 
July 12, 2002, underwent testing, and prepared to enroll in 
classes at a local community college. As of May 5, 2004, no 
vocational rehabilitation plan was formalized. 
On August 15, 2002, Zhang was informed that, based upon Dr. 
Stretzler’s findings, her temporary total disability benefits 
would terminate effective August 29, 2002. By letter dated 
November 21, 2002, Zhang requested a hearing to review DLNR’s 
“denial of services .” By second supplemental decision dated 
July 30, 2003, the Director determined that Zhang’s compensable 
work injury “was limited to an Adjustment Disorder that resolved 
and Major Depression that is in remission[,]” and denied further 
psychological treatment because her need for treatment was not 
related to her work injury, but rather, was due to a pre -
existing personality disorder.5 
Zhang appealed the July 30, 2003 supplemental decision to 
the LIRAB, which, by stipulation of the parties, remanded the 
case for a determinat ion of Zhang’s entitlement to vocational 
rehabilitation services and temporary total disability benefits. 
5 In making these determinations, the Director credited the 
testimony and reports of Dr. Stretzler that Zhang’s work injury had resolved 
and that her then- current psychological problems resulted from a pre -existing 
personality disorder, over those of Zhang’s treati ng psychologist, Dr. Adam -
Terem. 
19
  
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
                         
 6  In total, Zhang appealed three of the four supplemental decisions 
to the LIRAB, including the Director’s supplemental decisions dated July 30, 
2003, July 2, 2004, and July 6, 2006 (as amended July 18, 2006).  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Following a hearing on May 5, 2004 on the remanded issues, 
the Director issued a third supplemental decision on July 2, 
2004, denying vocational rehablitation and additional temporary 
total disability benefits based on the July 30, 2003 
supplemental decision, which concluded that Zhang’s work injury 
had resolved. 
Zhang appealed the July 2, 2004 supplemental decision to 
the LIRAB, which granted Zhang’s Motion for Temporary Remand on the HRS § 386-142 claim. A hearing was held on February 1, 
2006, and continued and completed on  March 21, 2006.  
By fourth supplemental decision dated July 6, 2006 (as 
amended on July 18, 2006), the Director determined that Zhang 
was terminated as a result of her immigration work status, and 
not solely due to her workers’ compensation claim. 
On July 23, 2006, Zhang, now pro se, appealed the July 6, 
2006 supplemental decision (as amended July 18, 2006), and 
continued the appeal of issues from prior decisions previously appealed to the LIRAB.
6 On August 24, 2010, Zhang filed a fraud

 7  In its SDO, the ICA ruled that “the issue of Zhang’s August 24, 
2010 fraud complaint is not properly before us, and the LIRAB did not err by 
failing to find that DLNR committed fraud against Zhang” where “it does not 
appear that the Director made any ruling on the 
issue . . . [nor] that LIRAB 
was asked to remand the matter to the Director or otherwise take any action on Zhang’s fraud complaint.” We likewise decline to address this issue for the first time on appeal. See Kalapodes v. E.E. Black, Ltd. , 66 Haw. 561,  
565, 669 P.2d 635, 637 (1983)  (“This court will not consider issues for the 
first time which were not presented to the [LIRAB].”); see also  HRS § 386 -

arguing

DLNR and Eric Hirano, Melvin Young, and DLNR Personnel 
office [sic], fabricated the “Warning Notice” based solely on a fraudulent I -9 Form “review”by [sic] INS, to 
intentionally  mislead and misrepresent [Zhang’s] work 
status in the U.S., and that INS and DLNR knew [Zhang] was 
terminated while she was authorized to work in the U.S.  
Zhang contended that she entered the United States under 
Executive Order 12711, and that the CSPA extended her work 
authorization status beyond January 1, 1994 because she had an 
I-485 petition pending.  
C. Appeal to the LIRAB 
The LIRAB held a hearing  on December 1, 2010.  The issues 
relevant to this appeal that were to be determined at the 
hearing included:  (1) whether Zhang is entitled to temporary 
total disability benefits after May 5, 2004, and (2) whether 
8 HRS § 386- 89(b) (1993) provides, “[t]he director may a t any time, 
either of the director’s own motion or upon the application of any party, 
reopen any case on the ground that fraud has been practiced on the director or on any party and render such decision as is proper under the 
circumstances.” 
21
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
48. The Board finds, therefore, no evidence that 
[Zhang] was temporarily and totally disabled after May 5, 
2004.  
                         
   
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Zhang was terminated solely due to her filing of a worker’s 
9 compensation claim, in violation of HRS § 386-142.  
The LIRAB issued its Decision and Order   on December 6, 
2011, reversing in part, modifying  in part, and affirming  in 
part the Director’s supplemental decisions dated July 30, 2003, 
July 2, 2004, and July 6, 2006 (amended on July 18, 2006). The 
LIRAB concluded that Zhang’s “work injury includes major 
depression, in remission, and adjustment disorder, resolved, but 
not dysthymia.” The LIRAB also entered the following findings 
of fact:  
VR 
44. [Zhang] initiated vocational rehabilitation . . . 
on July 12, 2002. 
45. There are no opinions that Claimant did not and 
may not suffer permanent partial disability as a result of 
the June 20, 1994 work injury. 
46. The Board finds, therefore, that [Zhang] is 
entitled to further VR services. 
TTD 
47. There are no medical certifications that [Zhang] 
was temporarily and totally disabled as a result of the 
June 20, 1994 work injury for the period after May 5, 2004.  
49. The Board makes no determination on [Zhang]’s 
entitlement to TTD after September 18, 2009 (medical 
9 By pretrial order dated February 19, 2009, the issues to be 
determined were,  inter alia : (1) whether Zhang’s work injury includes major 
depression, dysthymia, and/or adjustment disorder; (2) whether Zhang is entitled to further medical treatment; (3) whether Zhang is entitled to 
further VR services; (4) whether Zhang is entitled to TTD benefits after May 5, 2004; (5) whether to remand permanent partial disability for a later 
determination; and (6) the HRS § 386 -142 claim.

reports deadline) or [Zhang]’s entitlement to TTD pursuant 
to Section 386 -25, HRS, given the approval of future VR in 
the previous section. 
.. . . 
Termination 
57. The Board finds that the issue of whether 
[Zhang]’s termination from employment was solely the result 
of her industrial injury of June 20, 1994 has not been 
previously adjudicated.  
58.
 The Board finds that [Zhang]’s termination from 
employment was not solely the result of her industrial injury of June 20, 1994.  
The LIRAB also made the following conclusions of law: 
3. The Board concludes that [Zhang] is entitled to 
further vocational rehabilitation services. 
4. The Board concludes that [Zhang] was not entitled 
to temporary total disability benefits after May 5, 2004 
for lack of disability certification. The Board makes no determination o f [Zhang]’s entitlement to TTD benefits 
after September 18, 2009, as TTD may be related to re -
enrollment in VR. 
.. . . 
7. The Board concludes, considering Section 386 -142, 
Hawaii Revised Statutes, that [Zhang]’s termination from 
employment was not solely the result of her industrial 
injury of June 20, 1994. 
There is no evidence to support 
this contention.  
D. Appeal to the ICA 
10 Zhang, appearing pro se, argued, inter alia,  that the 
LIRAB erred in (1) denying her temporary total disability  
10  The first eight points of error concern alleged LIRAB error.  
Zhang argued that the LIRAB erred (1) by failing to find that DLNR committed 
fraud against Zhang; (2) by denying Zhang TTD payments, medical benefits, and 
“other benefits” after May 5, 2004; (3) by crediting the opinion of Dr. 
Streltzer and by determining that DLNR presented substantial evidence to 
overcome the presumption of work -relatedness regarding dysthymia; (4) 
regarding its permanent partial disability benefits decision; (5) by denying Zhang’s request for a change in her workers’ compensation “average weekly wage;” (6) by determining that DLNR did not violate HRS § 386 -142; (7) by 
denying Zhang “full discovery” regarding her termination; and (8) by failing to recognize Zhang’s entitlement to vacation and sick leave credits, as well 
(continued. . .)

                                                                              *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
payments, medical benefits, and “other benefits” after May 5, 
2004 based on its finding that there were “no medical trea tment 
plans after May 5, 2004[,] ” and noted an August 9, 2005 Workers’ 
Compensation Treatment Plan written by Dr. Adam-Terem as an 
example; and (2) finding no HRS § 386-142 violation where she 
was terminated after the date of her injury and the filing of 
her workers’ compensation claim. 
DLNR 
argued, inter alia , that none of the medical reports 
after May 5, 2004 properly certified that Zhang’s work-injury 
totally disabled her from work, and that HRS § 386-142 does not 
apply because Zhang “was terminated due to her failure to 
provide requested documents required by the INS and not because 
of her work injury.” As to the second issue, DLNR argued that 
Zhang failed to provide any evidence to establish that DLNR discharged her solely because of her work injury, instead 
providing evidence to show that DLNR should not have terminated 
her due to her immigration status. 
The ICA af
firmed the LIRAB’s denial of temporary total 
disability after May 5, 2004 for lack of disability certification, ruling that the three medical reports dated after 
May 5, 2004 were insufficient under HRS 386-96, which mandates 
(. . .continued)  
as her rights and benefits as a member of the HGEA. In Zhang’s ninth point 
of error, she argued that the award of attorney’s fees to her attorney should not be included in the ICA appeal.  These points of alleged error are not 
pursued on certiorari and are therefore not addressed.  
24
  
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
the submission of medical reports for the giving of treatment or 
rendering of services to an injured employee.  Based on the lack 
of adequate disability certification after May 5, 2004 and the 
LIRAB’s deference on mixed questions of law and fact, the ICA 
concluded that the LIRAB’s findings of fact  47 and 48 were 
supported by substantial evidence, and thus, the LIRAB did not clearly err regarding its temporary total disability decision in 
conclusion of law 4.  
The ICA also rejected the HRS § 386-142 claim as being  
“without merit,” stating,  Zhang “provide[d] no furthe r argument, 
facts, or authority supporting her assertion that the LIRAB 
erred, instead asking this ‘Court to spell out ANY evidence of 
any action to terminate Zhang or to question her work 
authorization initi ated PRIOR to June 20, 1994.’”  
III. Standards of Review 
Appellate review of a LIRAB decision is governed by HRS § 
91-14(g) (1993), which states that: 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm the 
decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions for further proceedings; or it may 
reverse or modify the decision and order if the 
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been 
prejudiced because the administrative findings, 
conclusions, decisions, or orders are: 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; or 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or 
jurisdiction of the agency; or (3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or 
(4) Affected by other error of law; or 
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, 
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole 
record; or

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by 
abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted 
exercise of discretion. 
We have previously stated: 
[Findings of Fact] are reviewable under the clearly erroneous standard to determine if the agency 
decision was clearly erroneous in view of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole 
record. 
[Conclusions of Law] are freely reviewable to 
determine if the agency’s decision was in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions, in excess 
of statutory authority or jurisdiction of agency, or 
affected by other error of law. 
A [Conclusion of Law] that presents mixed questions 
of fact and law is reviewed under the clearly 
erroneous standard because the conclusion is 
dependent upon the facts and circumstances of the 
particular case. When mixed questions of law and 
fact are presented, an appellate court must give deference to the agency’s expert ise and experience in 
the particular field. The court should not substitute its own judgment for that of the agency.

in original omitted) (quoting In re Water Use Permit 
Applications, 94 Hawai ‘i 97, 119, 9 P.3d 409, 431 (2000)).  
An FOF or a mixed determination of law and fact is 
clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial 
evidence to support the finding or determination, or (2) 
despite substantial evidence to support the finding or determination, the appellate court is left with the 
definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.  
We have defined “substantial evidence” as credible evidence 
which is of sufficient quality and probative value to 
enable a person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.

Barbara Kanae,  on March 19, 2016.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
IV. Discussion 
Represented by counsel on certiorari,11 Zhang asserts that 
the LIRAB erred in determining that (1) she is not entitled to 
retroactive temporary total disability benefits from May 5, 2004 
to the present due to deficiencies in her physicians’ successive 
certifications of disability, and (2) she was not terminated 
solely due to her filing of a workers’ compensation claim, in 
violation of HRS § 386-142.  We address these issues as follows. 
A.	 The LIRAB erred in denying Zhang’s TTD benefits after May 
5, 2004 based on deficiencies in the certifications of 
disability submitted by Zhang’s physician 
Zhang received temporary total disability  benefits totaling 
$226,869.84 for the period of June 25, 1994 to May 5, 2004, but 
was denied additional  benefits from May 5, 2004 to September 18, 
2009 (medical reports deadline).  To briefly summarize  the 
proceedings relevant to this issue, the Director denied 
temporary total disability  after May 5, 2004 on the basis that 
the July 30, 2003 second supplemental  decision determined that 
Zhang’s compensable work injury “was limited to an Adjustment Disorder that resolved and Major Depression that is in 
remission.” On appeal, the LIRAB affirmed the denial “for  lack 
of disability certification. ”   The ICA affirmed the LIRAB on the 
same basis.  
27
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Zhang argues, inter alia,  that the ICA erred in assuming 
“that successive medical certification was required to obtain 
TTD[.]” 
The issue of the 
denial of temporary total disability 
benefits due to deficiencies in physicians’ certifications of 
disability was specifically addressed by this court in Panoke , 
136 Hawai
‘i 448, 363 P.3d 296, in which this court vacated the 
LIRAB’s limitation of temporary total disability benefits, 
holding that “the LIRAB may not deny a claimant benefits based on deficiencies in a physicians’ certifications of disability.”  
136 Hawai‘ i at 465, 363 P.3d at 313. Rather, the consequence of 
a physician’s failure to include required information, such as 
“dates of disability,” in a report as required by HRS § 386 -96 
is a denial of compensation to the physician, not denial of the employee’s claim for temporary total disability benefits.  
Id.  
“To be sure, the LIRAB must assess the quality of the evidence that is presented, to determine whether the necessary showing 
has been made. However, in doing so it cannot rely on the 
physician’s failure to comply with the certification 
requirements set fo rth in those provisions.” 136 Ha w. at 466, 
363 P.3d at 314. 
In this case, 
the only allegedly valid disability 
certification dated after May 5, 2004 is the August 9, 2005 
Workers’ Compensation Treatment Plan by Dr. Adam -Terem, Zhang’s 
28
  
 
  
  
 
    
 
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
treating psychologist.  The ICA ruled that this report “did not 
comport with the HRS § 386-96(a)(2) requirement that it include 
the ‘dates of disability’ because it simply constituted a plan 
for future treatment and did not specify any range of time the document was supposed t o cover.”  DLNR asserts that this report 
is not a proper disability certification because it includes conditions for which DLNR is not responsible, and “Dr. Adam -
Terem made no attempt to separate out what specifically caused  
[Zhang]’s inability to work.”  
HRS § 386-31(b) establishes an employee’s entitlement to 
temporary total disability
, and provides that when “a work 
injury causes total disability not determined to be permanent in 
character, the employer,  for the duration of the disability,  but 
not including the first three calendar days thereof, shall pay 
the injured employee” the prescribed benefits. HRS § 386-31(b) 
(emphasis added). Based on 
Panoke, the ICA and the LIRAB 
clearly erred as a matter of law in denying Zhang’s temporary total disability benefits after May 5, 2004 based on 
deficiencies in the certifications of disability submitted by 
her physician. 
Accordingly, we vacate in part the ICA ’s October 24, 2014 
Judgment on Appeal and the LIRAB’s December 6, 2011 Decision and 
Order as to the denial of temporary total disability benefits after May 5, 2004 due to alleged deficiencies in the 
29
  
 
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
     *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
certifications of disability provided by Zhang’s physician, and 
remand the issue to the LIRAB for further proceedings consistent 
with this opinion. We decline to address Zhang’s en titlement to 
temporary total disability on the other bases referenced in the LIRAB’s finding of fact 49, such as temporary total disability  
after September 18, 2009 (medical  reports deadline) or pursuant 
to HRS § 386-25 in light of Zhang’s entitlement to future 
vocational rehabilitation services, as the LIRAB made no 
determination on those issues;  thus, they  are not properly 
before us. 
See  Kalapodes , 66 Haw. at  565, 669 P.2d at 637   
(“This court will not consider issues for the first time which 
were not presented to the [LIRAB].”); see also  HRS § 386-87(c) 
(explaining the LIRAB’s powers of review).  
B.
	 Although Zhang appears to have been authorized to work, the 
LIRAB did not err in determining that Zhang’s termination 
for alleged lack of work authorization did not violate 
HRS § 386-142 
At the outset, we address Zhang’s contention that she 
provided sufficient documentation to establish her employment 
eligibility. Based on the record and the law, it appears Zhang 
is correct.  We do not and need not decide this issue, however, 
because we conclude that Zhang ’s HRS § 386-142 claim is 
precluded by res judicata principles. 
We do note that Zhang entered the United States in 1990 as 
the spouse of a Chinese student permitted to work pursuant to 
30
  
 
  
 
 
  
   
  
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Executive Order 12711, which granted Chinese nationals who were 
in the United States  after June 5, 1989 employment authorization 
through January 1, 1994. See  Exec. Order No. 12711 § 3, 55 Fed. 
Reg. 13897 (April 11, 1990). Executive Order 12711 was 
superseded by the passage of the CSPA in 1992.  CSPA, Pub.  L. 
No. 102-404, 106 Stat. 1969.  The CSPA allowed Chinese  nationals 
in the United States  subject to Executive Order 12711 to apply 
for an adjustment to legal permanent resident status.  CSPA § 
2(a)(1) provided that upon application for adjustment of status, 
the Chinese national would be “deemed approved[.]” CSPA, Pub. 
L. No. 102-404, § 2, 106 Stat. at 1969.  Thus, Zhang was 
permitted to apply for an adjustment to legal permanent resident 
status following passage of the CSPA in 1992.  
Zhang submitted her Form I
-485 to the INS on June 30, 1993.  
At the time of her termination, Zhang’s application was still 
pending with the INS.  As Zhang had submitted her Form I-485 
with the required payment, it appears she was therefore deemed approved pursuant to CSPA § 2(a)(1), as confirmed by the August 
10, 1994, Department of Justice Employment Authorization Card 
Zhang received and forwarded to DLNR. It appears she therefore 
did not need to file for an H-1B petition. As noted in the 
circuit court’s findings , DLNR had drafted an H-1B temporary 
foreign professional visa application based on Zhang’s request, but it appears it was never submitted.  As also noted in the 
31
  
 
  
  
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
circuit court’s findings, unfortunately, DLNR apparently  
believed that the H-1B petition was pending  and that Zhang  
needed to establish approval of the H-1B petition in order to 
establish work authorization after January 1, 1994.   Based on 
the July 28, 1994 letter from Hirano to the INS and other letters from Young noting that Zhang had not provided the 
appropriate documents, it appears that, at the time of Zhang’s 
termination, DLNR did not focus on the effect of Zhang’s pending 
Form I-485 application for adjustment of status within the 
context of Executive Order 12711 and the CSPA.  Based on the 
issuance of Zhang’s Employment Authorization Card on August 10, 1994, it appears, however, that pursuant to the CSPA, Zhang was 
authorized to work in the United States at the time of her July 
27, 1994 termination.  We need not, however, and do not decide 
this issue because res judicata principles, in any event,   
preclude Zhang’s HRS § 386-142 claim. 
 
With respect to 
the alleged HRS § 386-142 violation, Zhang 
asserts that “the sole issue for decision was whether the 
immigration/work status issue was not a ruse or cover ” for her 
termination, and notes that the immigration issues emerged only 
after the filing of her workers’ compensation claim . DLNR’s 
position is that Zhang “was terminated due to her failure to 
provide requested documents required by the INS and not because 
of her work injury.”

DLNR also correctly asserts that Zhang is barred from  
raising an HRS § 386-142 claim under res judicata (claim  
preclusion) and/or collateral estoppel (issue preclusion),  based 
upon the circuit court’s decision in Zhang’s employment 
discrimination lawsuit  against DLNR, which was  noted in LIRAB’s 
12 finding of fact 32.  
As noted, the circuit court specifically found that Zhang  
had been terminated from her employment because of Young’s 
belief that Zhang had failed to submit the documents which were 
necessary for the extension of her work authorization.  In other 
12	 Finding of Fact 32 in the LIRAB Decision and Order states: 
32.  On July 23, 1998, Judge James P. Aiona, Jr.[,] 
issued Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order 
following a jury -waived trial.  In relevant part, Judge 
Aiona concluded that [Zhang’s] termination was not based upon her “national origin” and that there were no changes 
in her employment in retaliation for filing any employment 
grievances and/or discriminatory complaints.  
The following were among Judge Aiona’s Findings of 
Fact:  
. . . . 
7.
	 That it was []  Hirano and Young’s [sic] 
impression that sanctions could be imposed for 
their failure to note the expiration of 
[Zhang’s] work authorization in a timely 
fashion. As such, [Hirano and Young] sought to 
remedy the matter by seeking, what they 
believed to be, the necessary documents from 
[Zhang].  
8.
	 That [Zhang] submitted, what she thought to be, 
the necessary documents to [] Young. . . . 
9.	 That it was [] Young’s position that [Zhang] did not submit the documents which were 
necessary for the extension of her work authorization. As such, [Zhang] was terminated 
from her employment with [DLNR].

words, the circuit court found this to be the reason for Zhang ’s 
termination. The Judgment incorporating this finding was not 
appealed. Pursuant to HRS § 386-73 (1993),13 the Director has 
original jurisdiction over HRS § 386-142 claims, and the circuit court did not address this statute.   The circuit court, however,  
found another cause  for Zhang’s termination, namely, Young’s 
incorrect but actual belief that Zhang had failed to submit 
documents necessary for the extension of her work authorization.   
Therefore, Zhang is collaterally estopped from claiming that she 
was  discharged “solely” because she filed this workers’ 
compensation claim. The circuit court’s  specific finding as to 
the reason for Zhang’s  discharge has preclusive effect.

apply when a claim or issue decided in the original suit is 
identical to one presented in the action in question).   The 
issue of the reason for  Zhang’s  discharge was addressed in her

§ 386-73 Original jurisdiction over 
controversies. Unless otherwise provided, the director of 
labor and industrial relations shall have original 
jurisdiction over all controversies and disputes arising 
under this chapter. The decisions of the director shall be 
enforceable by the circuit court as provided in section 
386-91. There shall be a right of appeal from the 
decisions of the director to the appellate board and thence to the supreme court subject to chapter 602 as provided in 
sections 386 -87 and 386- 88, but in no case shall an appeal 
operate as a supersedeas or stay unless the appellate board 
or the supreme court so orders.

 Based on the foregoing, the LIRAB  clearly erred in denying  
Zhang’s temporary total disability  benefits after May 5, 2004

circuit court lawsuit.  The circuit court found a reason other 
than her filing of a workers’ compensation claim. This finding 
has collateral estoppel effect, precluding Zhang from asserting 
that her filing of a workers’ compensation claim was the “sole” 
14 reason for her termination.  
Even if res judicata principles did not govern, the LIRAB 
also concluded that Zhang’s termination was not solely the 
result of her June 20, 1994 work
-related injury based on a lack 
of evidence. The LIRAB’s concl usion was not clearly erroneous.   
V. Conclusion 
14 It appears another aspect of res judicata not argued by DLNR 
could also preclude Zhang from now asserting that Young’s belief as to the 
deficiency of her immigration documents was a mere ruse to retaliate against 
her for filing this workers’ compens ation claim: 
The rule against splitting a cause of action is an 
aspect of res judicata and precludes the splitting of a 
single cause of action or an entire claim either as to the 
theory of recovery or the specific relief demanded. The 
rationale for the rule is to prevent a multiplicity of suits and provide a limit to litigation. It exists to avoid 
harassment of the defendant, vexatious litigation, and the 
costs incident to successive suits on the same cause of 
action. 
Bolte v. Aits, Inc.,  60 Haw. 58
, 60, 587 P.2d 810, 812 (1978). 
The circuit court found that that Zhang had been terminated from her 
employment because of Young’s belief that Zhang had failed to submit the documents which were necessary for the extension of her work authorization.  
Zhang could have asserted in the circuit court lawsuit that this belief was a 
“ruse.” The rule against “splitting” could therefore also prohibit Zhang  
from making this claim in this workers’ compensation proceeding. Because we 
rule on collateral estoppel principles, we do not address or decide this 
possible issue.

We therefore vacate in part the ICA’s October 24, 2014 Judgment

consistent with this opinion.
