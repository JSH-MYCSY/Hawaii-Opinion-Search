OPINION BY ACOBA, J.
 
We hold that the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
1
(the court)  was right in denying the Motion for Relief from
Forfeiture of Bail Bond filed on November 2, 2011 (November 2

Motion for Relief) by Petitioner/Surety-Appellant Freedom Bail
 
Bonds (Petitioner). In doing so we conclude that (1) the
 November 2 Motion for Relief could not be brought under Hawai' i 
2
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b)  because pursuant to
3
HRCP Rule 81(a)(8),  the rules of civil procedure do not apply to
bond forfeiture proceedings, (2) the statement in Hawai
'i Revised 
4
Statutes (HRS) § 804-14,  that a surety may recover its bond at
any time by surrendering the defendant is qualified by HRS § 804­
5
51, which provides that once the court enters a judgment of
forfeiture a surety is entitled to relief only by filing a motion
 within thirty days demonstrating good cause for setting the
 judgment of forfeiture aside, (3) the November 2 Motion for
 Relief was not filed within the thirty-day time limit and thus
 was untimely, and (4) under the terms of HRS § 804-51, once the 
2 HRCP Rule 60(b) is reproduced infra.
 
3 HRCP Rule 81(a) states, in relevant part:
 
(a) To What Proceedings Not Applicable. Except as
expressly otherwise provided in this Rule 81 or another rule
of court, these rules shall not apply to the following
proceedings . . . in any circuit court:
 
. . . .
 (8) Proceedings for the forfeiture of bonds under
[HRS] section 709-51, as the same may be renumbered ;
 
. . . .
 
(Emphases added.) (Note: the State Legislature recodified HRS § 709-51 as HRS
§ 804-51 effective January 1, 1973. 1972 Haw. Sess. Laws 139.).
 
4 HRS § 804-14 states, “[t]hose who may have become bail for anyone,
 
may at any time discharge themselves, by surrendering him to the custody of
any sheriff or chief of police or his authorized subordinate.”

court denies a motion to set aside the judgment, the court is not
 
required to file a separate judgment under HRCP Rule 58.6
 
Therefore, for the reasons stated herein, we affirm the
 
May 23, 2013 judgment of the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA)
 
7
filed pursuant to its April 26, 2013 Memorandum Opinion,  that
affirmed the December 13, 2011 “Findings of Fact [(findings)],
 Conclusions of Law [(conclusions)], And Order” that denied
 Petitioner’s November 2 Motion For Relief of the court, entered
 on December 13, 2011. 
(December 2011 Order).
 
I. 
A. 
On March 23, 2009, Defendant Joseph Vaimili (Vaimili)
 
was charged with Kidnapping, Terroristic Threatening in the First
 Degree, Promoting Prostitution in the First Degree, and Carrying
 or Use of a Firearm in the Commission of a Separate Felony. Bail
 
6 HRCP Rule 58 provides as follows:
 
Rule 58 Entry of Judgment
Unless the court otherwise directs and subject to the
provisions of Rule 54 of these rules and Rule 23 of the
Rules of the Circuit Courts, the prevailing party shall
prepare and submit a proposed judgment. The filing of the
judgment in the office of the clerk constitutes the entry of
the judgment; and the judgment is not effective before such
entry. The entry of the judgment shall not be delayed for
the taxing of costs. Every judgment shall be set forth on a
separate document.

was set at $250,000. Petitioner posted bond for Vaimili on July
 
23, 2009, pursuant to HRS § 804-3 (2008).8 Vaimili was present
 
for jury selection on June 21, 2010, however, he failed to appear
 in court on June 23, 2010. The trial was continued to June 28,
 2010, to allow defense counsel the opportunity to locate Vaimili.
 
On June 28, 2010, a Judgment and Order of Forfeiture of
 
Bail Bond was filed. The court continued the trial to July 19,
 2010 to allow defense counsel another opportunity to secure
 Vaimili’s presence for trial. Vaimili again failed to appear for
 trial on July 19, 2010, and Petitioner was unable to locate or
 contact Vaimili.
 
B.
 
Petitioner filed its first motion, a Motion to Set
 
Aside Judgment and Order for Forfeiture of Bail Bond on July 27,
 2010 (July 27 Motion to Set Aside). At the time of filing,
 Vaimili’s whereabouts were still unknown. At the August 9, 2010
 hearing to address the July 27 Motion to Set Aside, Petitioner
 stated it was unable to locate and to surrender Vaimili within
 the “thirty-day search period,” and had no reason for Vaimili’s
 failure to appear at trial.
9 The court denied Petitioner’s July
 
8
 HRS § 804-3(b) states, in relevant part, “[a]ny person charged
 
with a criminal offense shall be bailable by sufficient sureties; provided
that bail may be denied where the charge is for a serious crime . . . .”

 At the forfeiture hearing, Petitioner stated that: (1) it had no
 
contact with Vaimili and was unaware of Vaimili’s whereabouts; (2) it was
unable to locate and surrender Vaimili prior to the expiration of the thirty

 the thirty-day 27 Motion to Set Aside and refused to enlarge  
search period. 
(Citing State v. Camara, 81 Hawai' i 324, 330 
(1996).) On August 16, 2010, the court filed its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying [Petitioner’s (first)] Motion to set Aside Judgment and Order of Forfeiture of Bail Bond (August 2010 Order). 
Petitioner filed its Notice of Appeal to the ICA on 
September 16, 2010, thirty-one days after the court filed its August 2010 Order. The ICA dismissed the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction because Petitioner’s Notice of Appeal was not filed within the thirty-day time period required by Hawai' i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(1) (2010). State 
v. Vaimili (Vaimili I), No. CAAP-10-0000017, 2010 WL 5497660, at
 *1 (Haw. App. Dec. 30, 2010)(unpublished order). 
C.
 
On June 27, 2011 Petitioner filed its second motion, a
 
Motion for Relief from Forfeiture of Bail Bond, pursuant to Rule
 7 and 60(b) of the HRCP (June 27 Motion for Relief).
11 HRCP Rule
 
60(b) states, in relevant part that:
 
day search period; (3) it had no satisfactory reason for Vaimili’s failure to
appear at trial when requested; and (4) it could not assure the court that
Vaimili would be located and surrendered prior to the expiration of the thirty
day search period.

 See HRS § 804-51 quoted infra.

     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
[T]he court may relieve a party . . . from a final judgment,
order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered
evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in
time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b) ; (3) fraud . . .,
misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4)
the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied,
released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is
based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer
equitable that the judgment should have prospective application;
or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the judgment. The
 
motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons
(1),(2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order,
or proceeding.
 
(Emphases added.) Vaimili’s whereabouts were still unknown, and
 
at the July 5, 2011 hearing regarding Petitioner’s June 27 Motion
 for Relief, Petitioner stated that it would continue its efforts
 to apprehend Vaimili on the mainland, but could not assure the
 court that Vaimili would be located. 
The court did not address whether HRCP Rule 60(b) was
 
applicable to a bond forfeiture case. The court denied
 Petitioner’s June 27 Motion for Relief based on Petitioner’s
 failure to locate Vaimili within the thirty-day period, under HRS
 § 804-51.
12 Petitioner did not appeal the denial of its June 27
 
Motion for Relief. 
D.
 
Vaimili was arrested and returned to Hawai' i by federal 
authorities on October 14, 2011. Petitioner filed its third motion, a Motion for Relief from Forfeiture of Bail Bond pursuant to HRCP Rules 7 and 60(b) on November 2, 2011 (November 2 Motion

    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
for Relief). In the November 2 Motion for Relief, Petitioner
 
asserted that Vaimili had been recaptured due to the efforts of
 its agents.
13
 
On December 13, 2013 the court entered the December
 
2011 Order. The court denied the November 2 Motion for Relief in
 its December 2011 order, based on the expiration of the thirty
 day period established by HRS § 804-51. See discussion infra.
 
E.
 
Petitioner filed its Notice of Appeal on January 10,
 
2012.
 
II.
 
On appeal to the ICA, Petitioner argued that the court
 
erred when it (1) concluded that HRCP Rule 60(b) did not apply to
 bond forfeiture proceedings; and (2) denied its HRCP Rule 60(b)
 motion, violating its right to due process. State v. Vaimili
 
(Vaimili II), No. CAAP-12-0000034, 2013 WL 1789405, *1 (Haw. App.
 April 26, 2013). The ICA decided that HRCP Rule 81(a)(8)
 expressly states that the HRCP do not apply in bond forfeiture
 proceedings. Id. at *2. Further, the ICA ruled that HRS § 804­
51 establishes the exclusive means to seek relief from a judgment
 
13
 Further, Vaimili previously had been ordered to report to the Oahu
 
Intake Service Center (OISC) to be outfitted with an ankle bracelet for
electronic monitoring, but did not appear. At the hearing on November 22,
2011, Petitioner argued that it was not notified about Vaimili’s failure to
appear at OISC, and if it had been, Petitioner could possibly have had time to
“surrender [Vaimili] to the custody of the Department of Public Safety before
he absconded to the mainland.”

         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of forfeiture because the statute prescribes the means for the
 
challenging party to appeal the motion. Id.
 
III.
 
In its Application, Petitioner maintains
 
(1) “the ICA’s conclusion that HRS § 804-51 is the ‘exclusive
 means’ for redress constitutes a grave error of law,” (2) HRS §
 804-14 “allow[s] a bail forfeiture to be set aside where the
 defendant is apprehended through efforts of the bail agent” and
 (3) “a separate ‘judgment’ is required [to be filed] in all civil
 proceedings[.]” Respondent did not file a Response to the
 Application.
 
IV.
 
A.
 
In connection with the first issue, Petitioner argues
 
that the ICA’s decision that HRS § 804-51 is the only avenue to
 challenge a bond forfeiture proceeding unnecessarily restricts
 the court’s ability to grant post-judgment relief and is
 inconsistent with the decisions of other state courts and of
 federal courts. Those courts, Petitioner contends, recognize
 that a bail forfeiture proceeding is a civil proceeding, and that
 the judgment is subject to post-judgment review consistent with
 any other civil judgment.

           ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Petitioner cites Camara, 81 Hawai' i at 329 n.7, 915 
P.2d at 1230 n.7, in which this court held that bond forfeiture 
proceedings are civil proceedings, and are therefore subject to HRAP Rule 4(a), which governs when appeals are taken in civil cases. It asserts that the ICA’s decision is inconsistent with Camara because Camara employs the same rationale as cases that “specifically recognize that a bail forfeiture proceeding is a civil proceeding and is subject to the same type of post-judgment review as any civil judgment.” 
Petitioner claims that analogously, in federal court,
 
bond forfeiture proceedings are not subject to the Federal Rules
 of Criminal Procedure (FRCP), but rather the Federal Rules of
 Civil Procedure because the civil rules are more consistent with
 the civil nature of the action. (Citing United States v.
 Vaccaro, 51 F.3d 189 (9th Cir. 1995) and United States v.
 Plechner, 577 F.2d 596 (9th Cir. 1978).) Additionally,
 Petitioner declares that other jurisdictions recognize the
 application of Rule 60(b) post-judgment motions in order to set
 aside bail forfeiture judgments.
14
 
14
 Petitioner cites United States v. Scott , 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS
 
114470, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. July 13, 2012) (considering a civil procedure Rule
60(b) motion to set aside bail forfeiture judgment, and concluding that
justice did not require bail forfeiture), Swift v. Esdale , 306 So.2d 268 (Ala.
1975) (affirming decision to overturn a forfeiture judgment pursuant to an
Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure (ARCP) Rule 60(b) motion), People v. Caro ,
753 P.2d 196 (Colo. 1988) (holding that a judgment of forfeiture could be
vacated pursuant to Colorado Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 60), State v.
Crosby, 2009 Ohio App. LEXIS 4176 (Ohio Ct. App. Sept. 21, 2009) (holding that
Ohio’s remission statute and Civil Rule 60 are cumulative remedies in bond

     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
B.
 
As to Petitioner’s first issue, the ICA correctly
 
concluded that the HRCP do not apply here.  Bond forfeiture
 
proceedings are excluded from the ambit of civil procedure rules
 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 81(a)(8), which provides that “[e]xcept as
 expressly otherwise provided in this Rule 81 or another rule of
 court, these rules shall not apply to . . . [p]roceedings for the
 forfeiture of bonds[.]” Consequently, HRCP Rule 81(a)(8)
 expressly precludes the application of the HRCP in this case.
15
 
Petitioner contends that because Camara applied HRAP
 
Rule 4(a) to bond forfeiture proceedings, this court recognized
 that such proceedings were civil proceedings. However, HRCP Rule
 81(f) provides that, “Rule 4(a) of the [HRAP] shall apply to
 appeals [] from a circuit court in proceedings listed in
 subdivision (a) of this Rule,” i.e., to bond forfeiture 
forfeiture proceedings), State ex. Rel. Moore County Bd. Of Educ. v.
Pelletier , 606 S.E.2d 907 (N.C. App. 2005) (recognizing that the court had
“previously utilized our Rules of Civil procedure in reviewing a trial court’s
denial of remission of a bond forfeiture”), and State v. Cortez , 211 S.E.2d
876 (N.C. App. 2011)(unpublished disposition)(holding that North Carolina
Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 60 applies to bond forfeiture).
 
15
 Pursuant to HRCP Rule 81(h), “[i]n any proceeding in the land 
court or listed in subdivision (a) of Rule 81 the court may by order direct
that any one or more of these rules , not otherwise applicable to said
proceeding pursuant to this Rule 81, shall be applicable to said proceeding .”
(Emphases added.) Petitioner cited Rule 81(h) in its Reply Brief before the ICA. However, Petitioner did not raise Rule 81(h) before the court in itsNovember 2, 2011 Motion for Relief or before this court. Hence, any argument based on Rule 81(h) may be deemed waived. State v. Moses , 102 Hawai 'i 449, 
456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003). 
10
         
        
            
           
            
            
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
proceedings. Thus, this court’s application of HRAP Rule 4(a) in
 
Camara is consistent with HRCP Rule 81. However, to reiterate,
 HRCP Rule 81(a) provides that the rules of civil procedure do not
 apply to bond forfeiture proceedings. Nothing in Camara is
 contrary to this express command.
 
The cases from other jurisdictions cited by Petitioner
 
are also inapposite, inasmuch as none of those cases interpret an
 analogous civil procedure rule. For example, Petitioner relies
 on Swift, where a bond forfeiture judgment was reversed pursuant
 to an ARCP Rule 60(b) motion. However, in contrast to HRCP Rule
 81, relating to the applicability of the HRCP, ARCP Rule 81 does
 not exclude bond forfeiture proceedings from civil procedure
 rules. Similarly, Petitioner also cites cases from Colorado,
 North Carolina, and Ohio, in addition to federal cases. However,
 none of those jurisdictions’ rules contain a provision precluding
 their application to bond forfeiture proceedings.
16 Hence, the
 
cases cited by Petitioner are not analogous to the HRCP, inasmuch
 as HRCP Rule 81(a) explicitly states that the rules of civil
 procedure shall not apply in bond forfeiture proceedings.
 
16
 See, e.g. , FRCP Rule 81(a) (bond forfeiture proceedings not
 
included in list of exceptions where rules do not apply); Colorado Rules of
Civil Procedure Rule 81(a) (same); Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 1
(same); North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 1 (stating that the rules
apply to “all actions and proceedings of a civil nature except when a
differing procedure is prescribed by statute”).

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
V.
 A.
 
In connection with the second issue, Petitioner
 
contends that the ICA failed to recognize that under HRS § 804­
14, a surety may “at any time” discharge itself by surrendering
 the defendant. It maintains that the statute is clear and that
 there is no temporal restriction on the phrase “at any time.” 
Petitioner argues that, like HRS § 804-14, FRCP Rule
 
46(f)
17 does not set forth a deadline to recover bail if the
 
defendant is ultimately apprehended through efforts of the bail
 agent. It cites Babb v. United States, 414 F.2d 719, 722 (10th
 Cir. 1968), which recognized that FRCP Rule 46(f) does not
 contain a time limit for bringing an action to set aside a
 forfeiture, but if the application for remission is “inexcusably
 delayed” relief may be refused.
 
Petitioner also relies on Swift, 306 So.2d at 268, in
 
which the appeal deadline had expired on the original forfeiture,
 
17 FRCP 46(f) states, in relevant part:
 
(f) Bail forfeiture.
 
(1) Declaration. A court must declare the bail forfeited if a
 
condition of the bond is breached.
 
(2) Setting Aside. The court may set aside in whole or in part a
bail forfeiture upon any condition the court may impose if:
(A) the surety later surrenders into custody the person
released on the surety’s appearance bond; or
(B) it appears that justice does not require bail
f
orfeiture.
 
. . .

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
but after the defendant was surrendered, that court set aside the
 
judgment on a Rule 60(b) motion in reliance on Alabama’s
 remission statute,
18 which allows that court to discharge bail
 
bonds at any time. Petitioner likens the Alabama statute to HRS
 § 804-14. 
Petitioner explains that its extensive efforts to bring
 
Vaimili back to Hawai' i merit the discharge of judgment under HRS 
§ 804-14. It further asserts that returning the bond once a
 defendant is surrendered promotes the public policy of having a
 defendant brought to justice, because without the possibility of
 recovery, the surety would have no inducement to find and
 surrender the defendant.
 
B. 
As to Petitioner’s second issue, the ICA did not err in
 
18 Code of Alabama § 15-13-139 states:
 
Remission after final judgment of forfeiture. In forfeiture cases where
the sureties have paid the amount of the forfeiture into the court or in
cases where the forfeiture has been made final or absolute and there is
 no further litigation pending on the forfeiture, and the surety locates
the defendant and causes the return of the defendant to the custody of
the court where the bond was forfeited, and if the defendant was
substantially procured by actions of the surety, and the administration
of justice has not been thwarted nor the successful prosecution of the
defendant has been affected, then the court which ordered the
forfeiture, shall have full power and jurisdiction in all proceedings
conducted pursuant to this article and within a period of six months
from the date of issuance of any final forfeiture judgment . . . may, in
the court's discretion, remit the whole of the penalty of the bail . . .
and render a new final judgment against the sureties appearing upon the
bail bond or undertaking. In forfeiture cases, if the judgment has been
paid into the State or Municipal Treasury, the court may issue an order
to the custodian of the treasury to make a refund to the sureties.

HRS § 804-14. As an initial matter, Petitioner did not raise HRS § 804-14 as a ground for the recovery of its bond in any of its motions before the court. In its November 2, 2011 Motion for Relief, Petitioner stated that it sought to have the court “grant relief from the judgment based on Rule 60(b) of the Hawai' i Rules 
of Civil Procedure.” Hence, any argument based on HRS § 804-14 has been waived. Moses, 102 Hawai' i at 456, 77 P.3d at 947. 
C.
 
In any event, pursuant to HRS § 804-51, once the court 
forfeits a bail bond, HRS § 804-14 is limited by the “thirty-day search period,” see Camara, 81 Hawai' i at 331, 916 P.2d at 1232, 
contained within HRS § 804-51. To reiterate, once a bond is forfeited pursuant to HRS § 804-51, a surety has thirty days from the time it receives notice of forfeiture to set aside the forfeiture judgment: 
Whenever the court, in any criminal cause, forfeits any bond
or recognizance given in a criminal cause, the court shall
immediately enter up judgment in favor of the State . . .
and shall cause execution to issue thereon immediately after
the expiration of thirty days from the date that notice is
given . . . to the surety or sureties on the bond, of the
entry of the judgment in favor of the State, unless before
the expiration of thirty days from the date that notice is
given to the surety or sureties on the bond of the entry of
the judgment in favor of the State, a motion or application
. . . showing good cause why execution should not issue upon
the judgment, is filed with the court. If the motion or
 
application . . . is sustained, the court shall vacate the
judgment of forfeiture and, if the principal surrenders or
is surrendered pursuant to section 804-14 or section
 
14
         
     
     
           
       
          
       
          
           
               
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
804-41, [ 19
]  return  the  bond  or  recognizance  to  t he  principal
or  s urety,  whoever  shall  have  given  it  .  .  .  .  If  the  motion
or  application,  after  a  hearing  held  thereon,  is  overruled,
execution  shall  forthwith  issue  and  shall  not  be  stayed
unless  the  order  overruling  the  motion  or  application  is
appealed  from  as  in  the  case  of  a  final  judgment.
 
HRS § 804-51 (emphases added). Pursuant to HRS § 804-51, then,
 
when a bond is forfeited in a criminal case, (1) judgment shall
 be entered in favor of the State, (2) the surety is given thirty
 days to file a motion showing good cause as to why the judgment
 should not be executed, (3) if the motion is sustained, the
 judgment shall be vacated, and (4) if the principal surrenders or
 is surrendered pursuant to HRS § 804-14, or HRS § 804-41 then the
 bond shall be returned to the surety. 
The legislative history of HRS § 804-51 indicates that
 
in 1989, the legislature amended HRS § 804-51 through Act 289. 
The report of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on S.B.
 1061
20 stated that “the present statute allows for a [surety] to
 
have the bail forfeiture set aside, but only within ten days
 after the defendant has failed to appear for court.” S. Stand.
 
19 HRS § 804-41 provides as follows:
 
§ 804-41 Discharge of surety
 
At any time before the breach of the condition of the bond,
the surety may discharge oneself by surrendering the
principal into the hands of any sheriff or the chief of
police or the sheriff's or chief's authorized subordinate.
 
Standing Committee Report No. 857 discussed S.B. 1061. The House
 
Judiciary Committee inserted the language of S.B. 1061 into S.B. 740, which
was adopted as Act 289. See H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1285, in 1989 House
 
Journal at 1318.
 
15
 20         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Comm. Rep. No. 857, in 1989 Senate Journal at 1127-28. Thus, the
 
legislature understood that the only means of setting aside a
 forfeiture was through a timely motion. However, the ten day
 time limit was inadequate because sureties were not informed
 within ten days of the defendant’s failure to appear. Id. 
Act 289 “change[d the] present law by requiring that
 
the courts give written notice to the surety,” and “allow[ed] a
 [surety] thirty days, instead of the [then] present ten [days] to
 object to the forfeiture of a bail bond.” Id. Hence, the
 
legislative history of Act 289 seemingly means that the
 legislature understood that a motion brought within thirty days
 was the exclusive means of recovering a forfeited bail bond.
 
In Camara, this court interpreted the legislative 
history of Act 289 to HRS § 804-51 as “demonstrating the legislature’s intent to allow the surety the opportunity to locate the principal before execution of the judgment of forfeiture actually occurs.” 81 Hawai' i at 331, 916 P.2d at 
1232. Thus, “if the principal surrenders or is surrendered within the thirty-day search period, the surety would be entitled to return of the bond.” Id. 
Also, execution of the judgment “shall issue forthwith
 
upon the expiration of thirty days unless the principal or surety
 files a motion showing good cause why execution should not issue
 within the thirty-day period.” Id. at 329, 916 P.2d at 1230
 
16
         
          
       
                
      
          
              
              
           
           
              
    
            
           ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(emphasis in original). This court further explained that a
 
defendant may show good cause as to why execution should not
 issue by, inter alia, surrendering the defendant “prior to the
 expiration of the thirty-day search period.”
21 Id. at 330, 916
 
P.2d at 1231. Hence, as explained by Camara, absent good cause 
22
 a surety has a
 for why execution of the bond should not issue  thirty-day window under HRS § 804-51 to surrender the defendant
 (i.e., the “thirty-day search period”). Id. at 331, 916 P.2d at
 
1232. 
In 
State v. Ranger Ins. Co. ex rel James Lindblad, 
Inc., 83 Hawai' i 118, 925 P.2d 288 (1996)23 this court held that 
the failure to locate the defendant within the “thirty-day search period” and to file a motion within the “thirty-day window” resulted in the forfeiture of a bail bond. In Ranger, the trial court filed a forfeiture judgment on March 5, 1991, and the surety received notice of the judgment on March 7. 83 Hawai' i at 
21 Camara also held that a surety could establish good cause by
 
showing that “uncontrollable circumstances prevented appearance” by the
 
defendant. Id. at 330, 916 P.2d at 1231. This is not applicable in this case
because Petitioner has not made this assertion.
 
22
 In determining whether good cause existed, it should be noted that 
“‘the primary purpose of bail in a criminal case is not to punish a defendantor surety, nor to increase the revenue of the State, but rather to honor thepresumption of innocence,’ by allowing ‘a defendant to prepare his or hercase, and to ensure the defendant’s presence in the pending proceeding.’”Diaz III , 128 Hawai 'i at 224, 286 P.3d at 833 (quoting Camara, 81 Hawai 'i at 
330, 916 P.2d at 1231). 
23
 Ranger was not cited by either party. However, the court did cite
 
Ranger in the Conclusions of Law in its December 2011 Order.
 
17
         
          
               
             
           ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
120, 925 P.2d at 290. On April 5, 1991, the surety filed a
 
timely HRS § 804-51 motion, and the trial court allowed the
 surety an additional forty-two days to locate the defendant. Id. 
Following the expiration of the forty-two days, on May 17, 1991
 the court orally denied the HRS § 804-51 motion. Id. 
Months later, in January 1992, the defendant was
 
apprehended by law enforcement authorities. Id. The surety then
 
filed a “bail bond surrender,” apparently pursuant to HRS § 804­14, on February 20, 1992. Id. Nevertheless, the trial court
 
filed an order denying the HRS § 804-51 motion on February 20,
 1992.
24 Id. Subsequently, the surety brought a second motion to
 
vacate the forfeiture judgment on March 12, 1992. Id. The trial
 
court denied the motion without a hearing, because it “‘did not
 provide a legal basis for the relief requested.’”
 
This court affirmed the court’s order denying the
 
surety’s first HRS § 804-51 motion. It was held that “the
 [s]urety’s HRS § 804-51 motion failed to make the requisite
 showing of “good cause why execution should not issue upon the
 forfeiture judgment.” Id. Consequently, under Ranger, absent
 
good cause a surety’s failure to surrender the defendant within 
24
 Seemingly, in Ranger, the court’s Feburary 20, 1992 order was a 
confirmation of its May 17, 1991 oral ruling. 83 Hawai 'i at 121, 925 P.2d at 
290. The trial court in Ranger apparently did not issue a separate ruling
discussing the bail bond surrender filed on Feburary 20, 1992. Id.
 
18
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the thirty-day search period provided by HRS § 804-51 mandates
 
forfeiture of the bond.
 
This court also affirmed the court’s denial of the 
surety’s second motion. Ranger explained that, “HRS § 804-51 
permits the filing neither of a second motion seeking to show ‘good cause why execution should not issue’ nor any motion after the closing of the thirty-day window.” 83 Hawai' i at 124 n.5, 
925 P.2d at 294 n.5 (emphases in original). Hence, “[t]he [s]urety’s sole recourse from the [denial of the motion to set aside] . . . [is] by way of appeal [to] this court.” Id. 
Thus, in the instant case, Petitioner’s July 27 Motion,
 
its first motion to set aside, constituted its HRS § 804-51
 motion. However, the court denied that motion. But,
 Petitioner’s appeal from the court’s denial of its motion was
 untimely. Consequently, Petitioner had no further recourse under
 HRS § 804-51. Id.
 
D.
 
An in pari materia analysis also supports the foregoing 
conclusion. “[L]aws in pari materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall be construed with reference to each other. What is clear in one statute may be called upon in aid to explain what is doubtful in another.” State v. Kamana' o, 118 Hawai' i 210, 218, 
188 P.3d 724, 732 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
19
         
           
           
          
          
           
           ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Here, HRS § 804-14 and HRS § 804-51 both pertain to recovery of a
 
surety’s bail bond. 
25
 To reiterate, pursuant to HRS § 804-14  sureties may
26
 “discharge  themselves,” i.e., extinguish the legal duty owed
regarding the defendant, by surrendering him or her to law enforcement. 
On the other hand, HRS § 804-51 pertains to 
recovery of a bail bond once the judgment of forfeiture has been entered. As explained 
supra, pursuant to HRS § 804-51, after the 
court forfeits a bail bond, sureties are allowed thirty days to file a motion showing good cause as to why the forfeiture judgment should be vacated. When the two statutes are “construed with reference to each other,” Kamana'o, 118 Hawai' i at 218, 188 
P.3d at 732, it is apparent that HRS § 804-14 applies generally except when the bond has been forfeited. In that event, HRS § 804-51 is applicable. 
HRS § 804-51 thus controls in situations where a
 
judgment of forfeiture has been entered. This resolves the
 question of whether the general allowance for surrender of a
 principle contained in HRS § 804-14 applies to Petitioner. 
Because HRS § 804-51 governs situations in which a judgment of
 
25
 As stated before, HRS § 804-14 provides that “[t]hose who may have
 
become bail for anyone [sic], may at any time discharge themselves, by
surrendering him to the custody of . . . [law enforcement].”
 
26
 “Discharge” is defined as, inter alia , “any method by which a
 
legal duty is extinguished; especially the payment of a debt or satisfaction
of some other obligation.” Black’s Law Dictionary 530 (9th ed. 2009).
 
20
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
forfeiture has been entered, and such a judgment was entered
 
against Petitioner, HRS §804-51 and not HRS § 804-14 applies to
 recovery of the bail bond by the Petitioner. Therefore,
 Petitioner cannot recover its bond under the provisions of HRS §
 804-14, but only under the conditions set forth in HRS § 804-51.
 
E.
 
Petitioner asserts that HRS § 804-14 should apply 
because allowing the surety an unlimited time period to recover its bond provides the surety an incentive to recapture a fleeing defendant. The accuracy of this contention aside, any argument that the thirty-day time period should have been extended to give Petitioner more time to recapture Vaimili should have been raised on appeal from the court’s denial of Petitioner’s July 27 Motion to Set Aside. See Ranger, 83 Hawai' i at 124 n.5, 925 P.2d at 294 
n.5 (holding that a surety’s only recourse from a the denial of a
 motion to set aside is an appeal). In failing to file a timely
 appeal, see Vaimili I, 2010 WL 5497660, at *1, Petitioner waived
 these arguments and it is not necessary to discuss them here.
 
VI. 
A.
 
In connection with the third issue, Petitioner
 
maintains that a bail forfeiture judgment is a civil judgment
 that must comply with the same level of formality as any other 
21
         
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
civil judgment. Specifically, it asserts that because the court 
in Camara, 81 Hawai' i at 329, 916 P.2d at 1230, held that a 
judgment in a bail forfeiture proceeding is a judgment in a civil case, there must be a separate judgment that complies with the requirements of Jenkins v. Cades Shutte, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 860 
P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). According to Petitioner, the court 
failed to enter a separate judgment that specifically identified 
the party or parties for and against whom the judgment was 
entered and the claims for which judgment was entered, and neglected to dismiss claims not specifically identified. 
Further, Petitioner apparently asserts that once the
 
court filed a “final judgment,” it would then be allowed to file
 a “renewed motion to set aside” pursuant to Diaz III. Petitioner
 maintains that in Diaz III, this court held that a “renewed
 motion to set aside” was timely “where it was filed over six
 years after the original Notice of Entry of Judgment but within
 30 days from the notice of the entry of a Final Judgment.” 
B.
 
As previously noted, HRS § 804-51 plainly requires the
 
court to issue a judgment “immediately” once the court “forfeits
 any bond.” The surety is then given thirty days to move to stay
 the execution of that judgment. If the motion to stay is denied,
 “execution shall forthwith issue.” Id. Hence, nothing in HRS §
 
804-51 permits the filing of a second judgment. Instead, the
 
22
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
initial judgment becomes effective once the deadline to file a 
motion to stay the execution of the judgment expires. In the instant case, on June 28, 2010 the court filed a forfeiture judgment as required by HRS § 804-51. That judgment was accorded res judicata effect on December 30, 2010, when the ICA dismissed Petitioner’s appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. See 
Eastern Savings Bank, FSB v. Esteban, 129 Hawai' i 154, 159, 296 
P.3d 1062, 1067 (2013) (“According to the doctrine of res judicata, the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction is a bar to a new action in any court between the same parties or their privies concerning the same subject matter[.]”). No further motions were permitted under HRS § 804-51. Hence, the court was not required to enter an additional judgment. 
C.
 
Petitioner cites Jenkins for the proposition that there 
must be a separate final judgment “[u]nder the rules applicable for a civil judgment.” Jenkins interpreted the “separate 
document requirement” set forth in HRCP Rule 58. 76 Hawai' i at 
119, 869 P.2d at 1339. However, as explained supra, the rules of civil procedure are inapplicable to bond forfeiture proceedings such as in the instant case. Hence, Jenkins is inapposite. The requirements of HRS § 804-51, and not the rules of civil procedure, are controlling here. 
23
         
          
               
   
        
            
             
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Diaz III also does not compel a contrary conclusion. 
In that case, the defendant initially appealed from the court’s 
order denying his first HRS § 804-51 motion to set aside the forfeiture judgment. See Diaz III, 128 Hawai' i at 221, 286 P.3d 
at 830. In State v. Diaz (Diaz), No. 28539, 2009 WL 3290249, at *1 (App. Oct. 13, 2009), the ICA held that it did not have jurisdiction over Petitioner’s appeal because the record on appeal did not contain the original forfeiture judgment filed under HRS § 804-51.
27 On remand, the defendant filed a second 
motion to set aside, and in light of the ICA’s holding, “also asked the district court to enter a [second] judgment of forfeiture.”
28 See State v. Diaz (Diaz II), No. 30324, 2012 WL 
1525032, at *3. The district court denied the second HRS § 804­51 motion, but “granted [the defendant’s] request for entry of bail forfeiture judgment.” Diaz III, 128 Hawai' i at 221, 286 
P.3d 830. 
The defendant then appealed the denial of the second
 
HRS § 804-51 motion. The ICA held that “under the peculiar 
27
 The first forfeiture judgment apparently did exist and was a part 
of the record on appeal in the second appeal. Diaz III , 128 Hawai 'i at 221, 
286 P.3d at 830. 
28
 Thus, contrary to Petitioner’s assertion, the second judgment in 
Diaz III was not characterized as a “final judgment.” Instead, both judgments 
were “bail forfeiture judgments.” See Diaz III , 128 Hawai 'i at 218, 222, 286 
P.3d at 827, 831. 
24
         ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
circumstances of this case” the second motion was timely because 
it was filed before the second entry of judgment. Diaz II, 2012 
WL 1525032, at *3. This court affirmed the ICA in this regard. Diaz III, 128 Hawai' i at 224, 286 P.3d 833. 
Nothing in Diaz III provides that a defendant or
 
surety is entitled to a second final judgment that renders a
 second motion to set aside timely. Such a requirement would
 allow defendants and sureties to circumvent the thirty-day time
 limit in HRS § 804-51. The filing of a second final judgment in
 Diaz III was the result of “the peculiar circumstances” of the
 case, i.e., the rejection of the defendant’s first appeal because
 the first judgment was not included in the record. See Diaz II,
 
2012 WL 1525032, at *3. In the instant case, Petitioner’s first
 appeal was rejected not because of the absence of a forfeiture
 judgment, but because it was untimely. See Vaimili I, 2010 WL
 
5497660, at *1. Hence, there was no reason for the court to
 enter a “second judgment” here.
 
In sum, pursuant to HRS § 804-51, a court is only
 
required to enter a judgment of forfeiture once -- at the time
 the court forfeits a bond. It is undisputed that this
 requirement was followed here. Hence, Petitioner’s argument that
 the court “failed to enter a separate judgment that complied with
 the requirements of Jenkins” is incorrect.

Based on the foregoing, the December 13, 2011 Order of
