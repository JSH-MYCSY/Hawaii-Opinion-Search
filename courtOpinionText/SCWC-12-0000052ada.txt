CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
(CAAP-12-0000052, 3P711-1171) 

December 23, 2014 
RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, POLLACK, AND WILSON, JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J.
  
I.
 Introduction 
Defendant was convicted by the District Court for the 
Third Circuit (district court) of committing the offense of 
prostitution in violation of Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 
712-1200(1) (1993, Supp. 2013). Defendant appealed the 
conviction to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), arguing  
  
 
   
  
                         
  
 
     
 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
there was insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction. The 
ICA affirmed the conviction. Defendant filed an application for writ of certiorari in which he argued the ICA erred by finding sufficient evidence to prove the commission of a prostitution 
offense. We affirm the judgment on appeal of the ICA, and 
clarify the prior-to-trial advisement required by
 State v. 
Lewis, 94 Hawai ʻi 292, 297, 12 P.3d 1233, 1238 (2000). 
II.
 Background 
On August 3, 2011, James Raymond Monteil was charged 
by complaint in the district court with the offense of prostitution, in violation of HRS Section 712-1200(1).
1 Monteil 
pleaded not guilty to the charge, and trial was scheduled before the district court on January 10, 2012. 
A.
 Prior-to-Trial Tachibana  Advisory 
At the commencement of Monteil’s bench trial,2 the 
judge conducted the following colloquy to inform Monteil of his right to testify and the right not to testify: 
THE COURT:  All right. Mr. Monteil, let me inform you:
You have the right to remain silent and the right against 
1 HRS § 712-1200(1) states,

MR. MONTEIL: 
 
 
MR. MONTEIL: 
 
THE COURT: 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
self-incrimination. No one can force you to testify in
this matter. Do you understand? 
MR. MONTEIL: Yes, your Honor. 
THE COURT: You don’t have to present any evidence
whatsoever. It’s up to the State to prove this case beyond
a reasonable doubt. Do you understand? 
MR. MONTEIL: Yes, sir. 
THE COURT: Do you understand that if you wish to testify,
the Court will allow you to do so; and if you do wish to
testify, your testimony will be taken under oath and
subject to penalties of perjury, the prosecutor can cross-examine you, and the Court can consider your testimony indeciding if you are guilty or not guilty? 
Yes, your Honor. 
THE COURT: You can wait until after the State has 
completed its evidence in order to decide if you wish totestify, and you can talk to your attorney before you
decide. All right? 
Yes, your Honor. 
All right. Call your first witness. 
Notably, the court did not inform Monteil that if he did not 
testify, his silence could not be used against him in deciding 
the case. 
B. Trial 
At the conclusion of the court’s colloquy, the State 
called its first witness, Honolulu Police Department (HPD) 
Sergeant Chad Taniyama (Sgt. Taniyama). Sgt. Taniyama testified 
that his duties as a detective included organizing prostitution 
sting operations and that he had conducted approximately ten such operations with the HPD. Some operations involved setting up email accounts and placing advertisements in the escort section of web sites such as “Backpage” or “Craigslist.”

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Sgt. Taniyama testified he was the lead investigator 
in such an operation on July 18, 2011. He placed an 
advertisement in the escort section of “backpage.com” on July 16, 2011, entitled, “ExOtIC BeAuTy AwAiTs You ToDaY.” The 
advertisement read as follows: 
Hey fellas my name is SiN. 
I am here for a short visit, take advantage while you can.

5’ with race car curves and eager to make your dreams come
true. Your imagination is our only limit. 100% REAL!! I

420 Friendly. 
Sgt. Taniyama testified he received email messages 
from several individuals in response to the advertisement, 
including messages from Monteil on July 16 and July 18, 2011.3 
Monteil’s email conversation with Sgt. Taniyama on July 16, 
2011, reads, in relevant part, as follows: 
MONTEIL: r u on big island? 
SGT. TANIYAMA (posing as “SiN”): Hey babe, i am not on the
Big Island right now. i will b in kona on Monday. i wouldlove to meet. lmk if we can hook up.

Two days later, on July 18, 2011, Monteil and Sgt. 
Taniyama continued the email conversation in which they agreed 
to meet later that day:

SiN: 
F13 . . . Love Sin 
Sgt. Taniyama testified that Monteil arrived at Kona 
Reef Condominiums (Kona Reef) room F-13 at 6:00 p.m. on July 18, 
2011. When Monteil arrived at the room, he knocked on the door, and Officer Sharon Yoon (Officer Yoon), who was assigned by Sgt. Taniyama to dress “as a prostitute,” answered, “Who is it?” A voice replied, “It’s me.” Officer Yoon opened the door and let 
Monteil into the unit. Officer Yoon informed Monteil that she 
was “gonna get ready” and left the room. At that juncture, “the vice officers came into the room from a separate room in the 
6
  
 
  
 
 
 
THE STATE:
 
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
unit and placed [Monteil] under arrest.” Sgt. Taniyama 
testified he conducted a search incident to the arrest and recovered $300.00 in cash from Monteil’s person. 
Sgt. Taniyama testified Monteil had agreed to receive 
“GFE” in exchange for $300. The Officer defined the term “GFE” as “girlfriend experience” and explained that “GFE” meant unprotected sex. 
THE STATE: And what is a “GFE”? 
SGT. TANIYAMA: That’s an internet escort term for a 
“girlfriend experience.” 
THE STATE: And what does “girlfriend experience” mean? 
SGT. TANIYAMA: As it relates to escorts, “girlfriend
experience” would mean that the john would like to be
treated as if he was dealing with his girlfriend with theescort. 
As it relates to sexual intercourse, it would mean
sexual intercourse without any contraceptives. 
 And is that what the defendant requested? 
SGT. TANIYAMA:
 Yes, a GFE. 
. . . . 
THE STATE: And just to clarify: Going back to the term
“GFE,” that means “girlfriend experience.” With regard
specifically to sexual conduct –- I’m sorry, what –- how
would you describe what a “girlfriend experience” is? 
. . . . 
SGT. TANIYAMA: Vaginal intercourse or anal intercourse or
any intercourse without contraceptives. 
THE STATE: So without the use of a condom, for example? 
SGT. TANIYAMA:
  
 Correct. 
THE STATE: Okay. No further questions, your Honor. 
On cross-examination, Sgt. Taniyama acknowledged the 
email exchange did not expressly mention sexual conduct. Sgt. 
Taniyama also acknowledged that from the time Monteil arrived at 
7
  
 
  
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the Kona Reef until the time he was arrested, Monteil did not 
make any indication that he came to the room to have sex. 
At the conclusion of the State’s case, the judge 
inquired if there were any witnesses for the defense. The 
defense counsel responded, “Yes, your Honor. We’re gonna have 
Mr. Monteil take the stand. . . . So if you’d like to question him.” The judge replied, “I think I already did that.” 
Monteil then took the stand and testified that in the 
email communications prior to his arrest, all he asked was if he could “meet somebody and have dinner or a drink,” and he maintained that “GFE” had no sexual connotations that he knew of. Monteil stated as a realtor, he “use[d] ‘GFE’ as ‘good 
faith estimate’ all the time” and that he did not “know what the 
intent of ‘GFE’ [was] in [the] prostitute world.” Monteil acknowledged his email interaction with “SiN” was not a “real estate transaction,” but he asserted that when he used the term “GFE” he meant “good fun everywhere experience,” “which [was] a very common term in any hotel industry.” He added that “having good fun everywhere [could mean] go and have dinner and have [] drinks,” and he maintained that his purpose for going to the 
Kona Reef was to take someone to dinner. However, on cross-
examination, Monteil acknowledged he did not mention going to dinner with SiN in his emails, but rather requested a “GFE experience for an hour or two.” 
8
  
 
   
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
With respect to his email communication with “SiN” 
about police, Monteil stated he thought it was “very strange 
that [he] was being asked if [he] was popo,” and he maintained he “didn’t know what ‘popo’ was.” When asked about his comment 
in the email correspondence about “tastings,” Monteil testified 
he was “a food and beverage director” and the “conversation ha[d] nothing to lead to any sex or anything.” Monteil additionally testified he had $400 on his person at the time of his arrest rather than the $300 the police testified to recovering from him. At the conclusion of Monteil’s testimony, the defense rested. 
The State’s closing relied on the testimony of Sgt. 
Taniyama, Officer Yoon, and the cross-examination of Monteil. The defense maintained in its closing that under the prostitution statute the defendant’s state of mind is at issue, not the police officer’s beliefs. For that reason, the defense argued Sgt. Taniyama’s testimony as to the meaning of the term “GFE” was not relevant in determining whether Monteil had the intent to engage in sexual conduct with “SiN.” The defense concluded that the evidence presented failed to demonstrate 
Monteil had the intent to engage in sexual conduct and thus the 
court should find Monteil not guilty. 
The district court indicated “the critical issue” was 
the definition of the term “GFE” or “GFE experience.” The court 
9
  
 
   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
found “[t]aken into effect the entirety of [the email exchanges 
between Monteil and “SiN”], together with the actions of [Monteil], [Monteil] did agree to engage in a girlfriend experience, which, as testified by Sgt. Taniyama, would be 
treated as if [Monteil], or the customer, were the boyfriend of 
the female and had sex without contraceptives.” Thus, the State “proved beyond a reasonable doubt that [Monteil] intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly paid or agreed to pay or offered to pay a fee to another to engage in sexual conduct.” 
When asked if he wished to make any further 
statements, Monteil stated, “Your Honor, . . . I am a law-abiding officer -- law-abiding citizen . . . . There was no 
intent whatsoever to do that.” 
In response to Monteil’s statement, the court 
explained to Monteil that his testimony was an additional factor 
it considered in finding him guilty of prostitution: 
Part of your testimony led me to believe that you did have
[] intent. You initially said you didn’t have any ideawhat “GFE” means and you referred to your real estate
experience, but the communication in this e-mail shows that
you were the one who suggested the “GFE experience,”. . . . but when you came onto the witness stand, you saidyou didn’t know what “GFE” means. . . . [t]hat’s one factorthat I used to decide this case. 
The court imposed a $500 fine and a $30 criminal 
injury fee.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
III. Appellate Proceedings 
On appeal to the ICA, Monteil argued the district 
court erred by concluding there was sufficient evidence to 
support a conviction of prostitution based on the term “GFE.” 
Monteil maintained that in order to establish that “[he] paid, 
agreed to pay, or offered to pay a fee to another to engage in sexual conduct, the district court would have to find the following, beyond a reasonable doubt”: (1) “‘GFE’ means ‘Girl Friend Experience[,]’” and (2) “the term ‘Girl Friend Experience’ is defined or means sexual conduct.” Monteil argued there was “contradictory testimony on the definition of the term “Girl Friend Experience” and whether the term in fact means 
sexual conduct. 
  Monteil contended Hawai ʻi cases dealing with 
prostitution have held that “when a term is not statutorily 
defined, [courts] may resort to legal or other well accepted 
dictionaries as one way to determine its ordinary meaning.” Monteil pointed out neither Black’s Law Dictionary nor any other “generally regarded dictionaries” reference the term “GFE” or “Girl Friend Experience,” and therefore, the “term ‘GFE’ [wa]s not commonly understood, or widely accepted to possess a generic 
meaning.” Monteil further argued, “Hawai ʻi appellate courts have 
never recognized GFE to mean ‘Girl Friend Experience’” and no 
11
  
 
   
                         
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Hawaiʻi case law “defines a ‘Girl Friend Experience’ to mean [] 
sexual conduct, sexual contact or sex without contraceptives.”4
  Monteil contended Hawai ʻi case law requires the trial 
court to find a “meeting of the minds” for an “agreement to pay 
a fee to another to engage in sexual conduct” when slang terms or phrases of uncertain meaning are used. Monteil maintained the “GFE” acronym was “not known or used by the general public to the extent that it ha[d] a general recognized meaning in the public,” and therefore, the “acronym, standing by itself[,] [was] insufficient to establish the element and finding of the 
district court, that [he] paid, agreed to pay, or offered to pay a fee to another to engage in sexual conduct.” Accordingly, Monteil requested the ICA reverse his conviction. 
In its Answering Brief, the State asserted it was 
“well within the [district] court’s discretion [to] . . . make credibility determinations and draw reasonable inferences from [the] evidence presented.” The State maintained that the evidence supported the court’s finding that “GFE” meant 
“girlfriend experience,” which constituted sexual conduct, and 
that Monteil solicited a “GFE” experience from “SiN.” Therefore, the State contended that the trial court’s finding Monteil guilty of prostitution was not clearly erroneous. 
4 Monteil instead argued the term “GFE” has been uniformly
recognized as “Good Faith Estimate” by federal courts located in Hawai ʻi. 
12
  
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Alternatively, the State argued that even if the 
district court clearly erred by finding “GFE” meant “girlfriend 
experience,” there was “still substantial evidence Monteil agreed to pay a fee to engage in sexual conduct” as evidenced by 
the nature of the online advertisement and the “sexually 
saturated remarks” in Monteil’s email exchange with Sgt. Taniyama. The State maintained “these exchanges—and the reasonable inferences that follow given the context—[were] sufficiently credible and probative that the agreement for a GFE concerned ‘sexual conduct’ as that term is defined under the 
Hawaiʻi Penal Code.” 
The State asserted the district court “reasoned that 
the exhibits, [Sgt.] Taniyama’s testimony, and Monteil’s 
behavior on the stand—considered in its entirety—showed that Monteil agreed to pay a fee in return for sexual conduct.” The 
State concluded that the evidence presented was of “sufficient 
quality and probative value to sustain Monteil’s conviction even if [Sgt.] Taniyama’s testimony [was] disregarded.” 
A. ICA Summary Disposition Order 
In its Summary Disposition Order (SDO), the ICA 
concluded there was sufficient evidence to support the district court’s finding that Monteil’s use of the term “GFE” conveyed his intent to engage in sex for a fee. The ICA noted that it was Monteil who first used the term “GFE” to describe the “kind 
13
  
 
   
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of party” he wanted in response to Sgt. Taniyama’s email and who 
subsequently agreed to pay “for this experience.” The ICA additionally noted that Sgt. Taniyama testified the term “GFE” had “a literal meaning of girlfriend experience” but “within the 
context of the escort industry was the equivalent of having sex 
as boyfriend and girlfriend without contraceptives.” 
The ICA noted that “even assuming that there are other 
meanings” for the acronym “GFE” and “the meaning testified to by 
Officer Taniyama has not been recognized by the courts of Hawai ʻi 
as Monteil argues, Officer Taniyama testified GFE is understood 
as referring to unprotected sex in the escort context, and when Monteil used the term in that context, it was to convey that meaning.” The ICA further noted that the “District Court credited Officer Taniyama’s testimony.” 
The ICA found the context of the email exchange 
supported Sgt. Taniyama’s testimony. The ICA held “[i]t [was] well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence” within “the province of the trier of fact.” The ICA concluded that in considering the evidence in the strongest light for the prosecution, there was substantial evidence as to every material element of the offense charged. Thus, the ICA affirmed the district court’s judgment of conviction. 
14
  
 
   
  
  
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
B. Application for Writ of Certiorari 
In his Application for Writ of Certiorari 
(Application) to this court, Monteil raises the following point 
of error: 
The ICA committed grave error when it found the State
introduced sufficient evidence to find Monteil guilty underthe new prostitution statute, because he never agreed or
offered to pay another for sexual conduct. 
Monteil reiterates his argument that there was 
insufficient evidence demonstrating he offered to pay another 
for sexual conduct and that the trial court’s determination of 
the meaning of “GFE” was improper. 
Additionally, Monteil argues that, assuming he meant 
“girlfriend experience” in his email, Sgt. Taniyama’s definition 
“as it relates to escorts” was “consistent with an offer to pay for . . . lawful services provided by escorts, including dates, dancing, dinner, drinks, . . . or flirting in an email exchange, all of which fall outside the definition of sexual conduct.”  Monteil argues that the ICA’s conclusion that there was 
sufficient evidence to convict him of prostitution was “clearly 
wrong” and that “girlfriend experience,” as it relates to services performed by an escort, does not involve sexual contact or sexual intercourse. 
Monteil asks this court to reverse the ICA’s SDO and 
the district court’s judgment of conviction and remand this case for entry of an acquittal. 
15
  
 
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In its Response to Monteil’s Application (Response), 
the State contends Monteil made “many sexually saturated 
remarks” throughout his email exchange with “SiN,” which evidences that “he wanted to engage in sexual conduct.” The 
State concludes that these remarks, “and the reasonable 
inferences that follow, given Monteil’s subsequent actions, are sufficiently credible and probative that the $300 agreement for a ‘gfe experience’ was vernacular for sexual conduct.” 
In Monteil’s Reply, he argues that “75% of the 
‘sexually saturated remarks’ in the email exchange were made by Sgt. Taniyama, and exchanges about ‘popo’ and ‘tasting’ were initiated by SiN, not Monteil.” Monteil argues the “prohibited 
conduct must be shown by the defendant’s words , not police 
suggestions,” and he contends that he did not “email SiN [in 
response to the ad] requesting sexual favors.” 
IV. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
On appeal, the test for sufficiency of the evidence is 
“not whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there is ‘substantial evidence’ to support the 
conclusion of the trier of fact.” State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai ʻi 
149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 (2007) (quoting State v. 
Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 248-49, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992)). “Substantial evidence” is “credible evidence which is of 
sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of 
16
  
 
   
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
reasonable caution to support a conclusion.” Id. at 158, 166 
P.3d at 331 (quoting Batson, 73 Haw. at 248-49, 831 P.2d at 
931). When considering the legal sufficiency of evidence to support a conviction, such “evidence adduced in the trial court 
must be considered in the strongest light for the prosecution.” 
Matavale
, 115 Hawai ʻi at 157, 166 P.3d at 330. 
In a bench trial, “the trial judge is free to make all 
reasonable and rational inferences under the facts in evidence, 
including circumstantial evidence.” Batson, 73 Haw. at 249, 831 
P.2d at 931. Further, “[i]t is for the trial judge as fact-finder to assess the credibility of witnesses and to resolve all questions of facts; the judge may accept or reject any witness’s 
testimony in whole or in part.” State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai ʻi 
131, 139, 913 P.2d 57, 65 (1996). It is not the role of the 
appellate court to weigh credibility or resolve conflicting 
evidence.

; State v. Wallace, 80 Hawai ʻi 382, 418, 910 P.2d 
695, 731 (1996). 
V. DISCUSSION 
A. Sufficiency of the Evidence 
A person commits the offense of prostitution if he or 
she “[p]ays, agrees to pay, or offers to pay a fee to another to 
engage in sexual conduct.” HRS § 712-1200(1)(b). In this case, 
the State adduced evidence that Monteil responded to Sgt. Taniyama’s online advertisement in which the officer portrayed 
17
  
 
                          
  
  
  
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
an escort named “SiN.” The email conversations between Monteil 
and “SiN” were replete with sexual innuendo,5 and at several 
times during the conversation, Monteil expressed concern about whether “SiN” was involved in law enforcement.
6 Ultimately, 
Monteil asked “SiN” for a “GFE experience for an hour or two” and offered to pay $300.00 for such experience. After reaching an agreement with “SiN” to pay $300.00 for “GFE,” Monteil arranged a date, time and location to meet “SiN,” and he followed through with those plans. 
Sgt. Taniyama and Monteil both testified as to the 
meaning of “GFE.” Sgt. Taniyama explained the term “GFE” was vernacular in the internet escort community for “girlfriend 
experience,” which in turn meant to have sex with another 
without the use of contraceptives. Monteil testified he did not know what “GFE” meant in the context of prostitution; he asserted that “GFE” means “good faith estimate” in the real 
5 For example, “SiN” made several sexually suggestive comments to
Monteil: 1) he needs to “book [her] now or miss the greatest ride on earth,”
2) she “played a naughty cop many times,” 3) she “can’t wait to get [her]hands on [him],” and 4) she “will let [Monteil] know where to cum.”Additionally, in response to “SiN’s” comment that she “taste[d] as good asshe look[ed]” in her ad, Monteil told “SiN” that 1) he specialized in
“tasting competitions,” 2) he would taste her “until there’s no more to
taste,” and 3) he guaranteed that she would “experience” the “tasting.” 
6 When “SiN” initially asked what “kind of party” he wanted,
Monteil was resistant to answering on email, “Do i really need to say on e-mail . . . .” Monteil then asked whether or not “SiN” was in any “law
enforcement group.” On the day that Monteil was scheduled to meet with
“SiN,” Monteil again asked “SiN” if she was “associated with any lawenforcement.”

estate context and that “GFEE” means “good fun everywhere 
experience” in the hotel industry. 
In its oral ruling, the district court expressly 
relied on Sgt. Taniyama’s testimony in finding “GFE” constituted 
sexual conduct; by contrast, the judge noted Monteil’s testimony 
regarding the term “GFE” was inconsistent and contradictory. The sexual nature of the email conversation between Monteil and “SiN” further supports Sgt. Taniyama’s contention that “GFE” constitutes sexual conduct. 
When viewed in the light most favorable to the State, 
the totality of the evidence—including the email conversation, Sgt. Taniyama’s testimony,
7 and Monteil’s subsequent actions— 
constitutes substantial evidence that Monteil contacted “SiN” to solicit sexual conduct. Thus, the ICA did not err in concluding the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to sustain Monteil’s conviction for prostitution. 
7 The ICA has previously relied on police testimony to discern the
meaning of colloquial words, phrases, or other types of street vernacular.

officer’s testimony that the defendant’s question in Japanese to the Japanese
male tourists, “Would you like to play?” was the street vernacular equivalentto “Would you like to have sex?”).

B. Prior-to-Trial Advisement 
1.
 Hawai ʻi law has long recognized that a defendant 
accused of a criminal offense is accorded specific fundamental 
rights, including the right to be represented by counsel, the right to have guilt proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and, as relevant to this case, the right to testify and the right not to 
testify. 
See Tachibana v. State , 79 Hawai #i 226, 900 P.2d 1293 
(1995); see also Lewis,  94 Hawai #i at 295, 12 P.3d at 1236. 
A defendant’s “right to testify is guaranteed by the 
United States’ Sixth Amendment guarantee of compulsory process, 
and Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of due process; the Hawai #i 
Constitution’s parallel guarantees under Article I, sections 14, 
and 5, respectively; and HRS § 801-2 (1993)’s statutory protection of the right to testify, which states, ‘In the trial 
of any person on the charge of any offense, he shall have a 
right . . . to be heard in his defense.’” 
State v. Pomroy,  132 
Hawai#i 85, 91, 319 P.3d 1093, 1099 (2014) (citing Tachibana, 79 
Hawai
#i at 231-32, 900 P.2d at 1298-99);  accord State v. Han,  130 
Hawai#i 83, 87, 306 P.3d 128, 132 (2013). 
A defendant’s right not to testify is guaranteed by 
the United States’ Fifth Amendment guarantee against compelled 
testimony and the Hawai ʻi Constitution’s parallel guarantee under 
20
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Article I, section 10. See State v. Silva, 78 Hawai ʻi 115, 124, 
890 P.2d 702, 711 (App. 1995), abrogated on other grounds by 
Tachibana, 79 Hawai ʻi 226, 900 P.2d 1293; see also Lewis, 94 
Hawai#i at 293, 12 P.3d at 1234. As early as 1887, this court 
held that a defendant should not be prejudiced for exercising 
the right not to testify and for remaining silent at trial. See 
The King v. McGiffin,  7 Haw. 104, 114 (Haw. Kingdom 1887) 
(holding a comment by the prosecution in its summation as to the 
defendant’s failure to testify was “highly improper, and contrary to the statute” although not prejudicial in the particular case as the court intervened and directed the jury 
not to take notice). 
The Hawai ʻi Legislature later adopted and 
codified this common law rule when it enacted HRS § 621-15 that 
provided, in part, “[N]o inference shall be drawn prejudicial to the accused by reason of such neglect or refusal [to testify], nor shall any argument be permitted tending to injure the 
defense of the accused person on account of such failure to 
offer himself as a witness.” HRS § 621-15 (1976) (repealed 1980). This provision has evolved over the years and is found 
today in Hawai ʻi Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 513, which 
prohibits the court or counsel to comment on, or draw any 
inference from, a defendant’s exercise of the right not to testify. HRE Rule 513(a) (codified at HRS § 626-1).

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Thus, Hawai #i has historically protected both the right 
to testify and the right not to testify. To ensure that a 
decision to waive the fundamental right to testify is an intelligent and voluntary act, this court adopted the colloquy approach in which “the trial judge, as a matter of routine, conducts an [on-the-record] inquiry . . . with the defendant.” 
Tachibana, 79 Hawai ʻi at 233, 900 P.2d at 1300. 
In Tachibana
, this court reviewed a defendant’s claim 
that his attorney had prevented him from testifying at trial, and thus violated his right to testify. 79 Hawai ʻi at 230, 900 
P.2d at 1297. To protect the right to testify and to limit 
similar post-conviction challenges, 
Tachibana required that the 
trial court conduct an “ultimate colloquy” in cases in which a 
defendant has not testified prior to the close of the case. 79 
Hawaiʻi at 236, 900 P.2d at 1303. The court is required to 
advise defendants of their right to testify and must obtain an 
on-the-record waiver of that right in every case in which the 
defendant does not testify. Id. 
“In conducting the colloquy, the trial court must be 
careful not to influence the defendant’s decision whether or not 
to testify.” Tachibana,  79 Hawai ʻi at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 
n.7. Accordingly, the court’s advisory to the defendant must 
maintain an “even balance” between a defendant’s right to 
22
  
 
testify and the right not to testify. Lewis, 94 Hawai #i at 295, 
12 P.3d at 1236. Particular caution must be afforded to avoid 
infringing upon the right not to testify, which has been recognized as a “more fragile right”
8 than the right to testify. 
See id.
 at 295, 12 P.3d at 1236. 
                          
  
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Expressly recognizing the importance of a balanced 
advisement, Tachibana  provides the trial courts with specific 
guidance for the “ultimate” colloquy to ensure defendants are informed of their right to testify and not to testify, without influencing this decision. As stated by Tachibana, the court should inform the defendant of the following: 
 
[H]e or she has a right to testify, that if he or she wants
to testify that no one can prevent him or her from doingso, and that if he or she testifies the prosecution will be
allowed to cross-examine him or her. In connection with 
the privilege against self-incrimination, the defendantshould also be advised 
that he or she has a right not to
testify and that if he or she does not testify then thejury can be instructed about that right. 
Tachibana, 79 Hawai ʻi at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7 
8 “Fragile” in the context of the right not to testify derives
from Siciliano v. Vose, 834 F.2d 29 (1st Cir. 1987). 
To require the trial court to follow a special procedure,explicitly telling defendant about, and securing anexplicit waiver of, a privilege 
to testify (whether
administered within or outside the jury’s hearing), couldinappropriately influence the defendant to waive hisconstitutional right not to testify, thus threatening theexercise of this other, converse, constitutionallyexplicit, and more fragile right. 
Id.
 at 30. The court in  Siciliano suggests that advising the defendant of
the right to testify may inappropriately influence the defendant torelinquish the more fragile constitutional right not to testify. 
23
  
 
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(emphasis added). 
In addition to requiring an “ultimate colloquy,” 
Tachibana  strongly recommended trial courts conduct a prior-to-
trial advisement to inform defendants of their right to testify and the right not to testify. Id. at 237 n.9, 900 P.2d at 1304 
n.9
 (noting that “ although the ultimate colloquy should be 
conducted after all evidence other than the defendant’s testimony has been received, it would behoove the trial court, 
prior to the start of trial” to inform the defendant of his or 
her right to testify or not to testify). However, not all trial 
courts took heed of Tachibana’s recommendation. 
In Lewis, the court reviewed a post-conviction 
challenge from a defendant who testified at his trial and was 
subsequently found guilty. Lewis, 94 Hawai ʻi 292, 12 P.3d 1233. 
The defendant did not receive either the “ultimate” 
Tachibana 
colloquy or Tachibana ’s recommended prior-to-trial advisement. 
Id. On appeal, the defendant argued the trial court erred by 
failing to obtain an on-the-record waiver of his right not to 
testify. Id. 
In finding the trial court did not err, the Lewis 
court observed Tachibana’s “ultimate” colloquy was primarily intended to protect the right to testify and thus was “only required in cases in which the defendant does not testify.” 
Id. 
24
  
 
                          
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
at 295, 12 P.3d at 1236 (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Lewis further noted the prior-to-trial advisement discussed in 
Tachibana was a recommendation, not a requirement for trial 
courts. Id.
 at 296-97, 12 P.3d at 1237-38. As such, Lewis held 
the trial court in that case was not required to advise the defendant of his right not to testify. Id. 
Although holding the trial court did not err,
9 Lewis 
found that there was a “salutary effect” gained from “a trial court addressing a defendant” prior to trial regarding the right to testify or not testify. Id. Specifically, the court noted a 
prior-to-trial advisement would “have the beneficial impact of limiting any post-conviction claim that a defendant testified in 
ignorance of his or her right not to testify.” Id. The 
pretrial advisement also lessened the risk that the “ultimate 
colloquy” would affect the defendant’s right not to testify. 
Tachibana, 79 Hawai ʻi at 236 at 236 n.9, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.9 
(“Such an early warning would reduce the possibility that the 
trial court’s colloquy could have any inadvertent effect on [] the defendant’s right not to testify . . . .”). Lewis thus 
recognized the fundamental importance of a trial court informing 
9 The Lewis court concluded that although the trial court did not
advise the defendant of his right not to testify, there was “nothing to
indicate [] [the defendant’s] decision to testify was anything other than
voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently made,” and the court affirmed the
conviction. Lewis
, 94 Hawai #i at 296-97, 12 P.3d at 1237-38. 
25
  
 
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
a defendant of the constitutional right not to testify prior to 
the commencement of trial. 
Accordingly, Lewis set forth a prospective requirement 
that, prior to the start of trial, trial courts must “(1) inform 
the defendant of his or her personal right to testify or not to 
testify and (2) alert the defendant that if he or she has not testified by the end of the trial, the court will briefly question the defendant to ensure that the decision not to 
testify is the defendant’s own decision.” 94 Hawai ʻi at 297, 12 
P.3d at 1238 (quoting Tachibana, 79 Haw. at 237 n.9, 900 P.2d at 
1304 n.9). In contrast to Tachibana’s delineated advisory for the “ultimate” colloquy, Lewis did not specify the content of the prior-to-trial advisement. 
2. 
In this case, at the commencement of trial, the court 
conducted a prior-to-trial advisement to inform Monteil of his right to testify and right not to testify. 
As to Monteil’s 
right not to testify, the court advised him that he had the “right to remain silent and the right against self-incrimination” and that no one could “force [him] to testify.” The court also informed Monteil that he did not “have to present any evidence whatsoever” and that it was “up to the State to prove [the] case beyond a reasonable doubt.” However, the 
court’s prior-to-trial advisement did not inform Monteil that if 
26
  
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
he exercised his right not to testify, his silence could not be 
used against him in deciding the case. Monteil later testified without a further advisory from the court. 
3. 
A defendant’s understanding of the right to testify or 
not to testify is fundamental to a fair trial. A court has a “serious and weighty responsibility to determine whether” a waiver of the right to testify is a knowing and intelligent 
decision. Tachibana, 79 Hawai ʻi at 233, 900 P.2d at 1300. 
Similarly, a decision by a defendant not to testify should be 
based upon a defendant’s awareness of the “relevant circumstances and likely consequences” of such a decision. See 
Brady v. United States
, 397 U.S. 742, 748 (1970) (“ Waivers of 
constitutional rights not only must be voluntary but must be 
knowing, intelligent acts done with sufficient awareness of the 
relevant circumstances and likely consequences.”) . 
Foremost among the “relevant circumstances” pertaining 
to the constitutional right not to testify is the guarantee that 
a defendant cannot be penalized for exercising the right not to testify. 
That is, “no inference may be drawn therefrom,” by the 
fact finder. HRE Rule 513(a). If an inference of guilt could be drawn from not testifying, such penalty would erode the 
constitutional guarantee against compelled testimony as it would 
tend to coerce a defendant to testify. 
27
  
 
    
                         
   
 
   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In this case, the court did not advise Monteil of the 
very significant “relevant circumstance” of his right not to 
testify—i.e., that no inference of guilt may be drawn for exercising this right. Because Monteil testified, implicitly 
waiving his right not to testify prior to the close of his 
defense’s case, he did not receive the “ultimate” Tachibana colloquy. However, had Monteil waited until he received the “ultimate” colloquy before deciding whether to testify, he would have been informed by the court that a decision not to testify could not be used against him in deciding the case.
10 
This imbalance in information between the prior-to-
trial advisement and the “ultimate” colloquy potentially 
threatens the “more fragile right” not to testify, as testifying 
defendants, such as Monteil, are not assured to receive adequate advisement of the “relevant circumstance” of exercising the 
10 The Tachibana  ultimate colloquy provides as follows in
relevant part: 
In connection with the privilege against self-
incrimination, the defendant should also be advised that heor she has a right not to testify and that if he or shedoes not testify then the jury can be instructed about thatright. 
Tachibana
, 79 Hawai ʻi at 236 at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7. Hawai #i 
Criminal Jury Instruction No. 3.14, entitled “Defendant Not Required toTestify” provides as follows: 
The defendant has no duty or obligation to testify, and you mustnot draw any inference unfavorable to the defendant becausehe/she did not testify in this case, or consider this in any wayin your deliberations. 
28
  
 
                          
  
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
right not to testify. Consequently, a prior-to-trial advisement 
that fails to advise the defendant that a decision not to testify may not be used as evidence of guilt, may jeopardize an informed decision by the defendant regarding whether to testify. 
The prior-to-trial advisement as given in this case 
additionally may not achieve its intended objective of limiting post-conviction challenges from defendants claiming to have testified without adequate awareness of the right not to 
testify.  
Lewis, 94 Hawai #i at 297, 12 P.3d at 1238 (pretrial 
advisement  “will have the beneficial effect of limiting any 
post-conviction claim that a defendant testified in ignorance of 
his or her right not to 
testify”).11 If a court omits a 
significant “relevant circumstance” of the right not to testify from its prior-to-trial advisement, as occurred in this case, the advisement’s effect on limiting post-conviction challenges 
is diminished. See Lewis, 94 Hawai #i at 297, 12 P.3d at 1238. 
Further, a pretrial advisement that fails to 
adequately inform a defendant of a “relevant circumstance” poses 
a possibility that the court may inadvertently influence a 
defendant’s decision of whether or not to testify. See Lewis, 
11 See also Tachibana,  79 Hawai #i at 235, 900 P.2d at 1302 ( “[B]y
engaging in the colloquy, a trial judge would establish a record that would
effectively settle the right-to-testify issues in the case, and therebyrelieve the trial judge of extended post-conviction proceedings.”  (quoting
Boyd v. United States , 
586 A.2d 670, 679-80 (D.C. App. 1991)). 
29
  
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
94 Hawai #i at 295, 12 P.3d at 1236; Tachibana, 79 Hawai #i at 236 
n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7. In expressly recognizing the risk of 
undue influence, Tachibana provided trial courts with express guidance to ensure the “ultimate” colloquy would “maintain the even balance of the trial court’s statement to the defendant” 
while at the same time providing sufficient information for a defendant to be adequately informed of his or her right to 
testify or not to testify. 
Lewis, 94 Hawai #i at 295, 12 P.3d at 
1236 (balanced statement was intended to avoid risk that  “by 
advising the defendant of his or her right to testify, the court 
could influence the defendant to waive his or her right not to 
testify”). 
In this case Monteil was informed of the right to 
remain silent, the right against self-incrimination, and that no one could force him to testify, however not conveyed was the critical information that the exercise of the right not to testify does not permit a fact finder to draw an inference of guilt from not testifying. 
Consequently, such an advisory may 
have a potential to influence the decision to testify or not testify. 
To address the future risk of a court inadvertently 
influencing a defendant’s decision, the court’s pretrial advisement should provide the “even balanced” statement that is required in the ultimate colloquy—that a decision not to testify 
30
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
may not be used against the defendant in deciding the case. 
This will ensure that the testifying defendant is provided with the same information that is given to the non-testifying defendant regarding the “circumstance” of not testifying, and 
thus, the court will avoid emphasizing one right over the other. 
It will also help accomplish one of the primary objectives of the pretrial advisory, which is to reduce the number of post-conviction challenges from defendants claiming to have testified 
in ignorance of their right not to testify. 
Lewis, 94 Hawai #i at 
297, 12 P.3d at 1238. 
Therefore, we hold that in order to more fully protect 
the right not to testify under the Hawai #i Constitution, the 
trial courts when informing the defendant of the right not to 
testify during the pretrial advisement must also advise the defendant that the exercise of this right may not be used by the fact finder to decide the case. This requirement will be 
effective in trials beginning after the date of this opinion. The inclusion of this information in the pretrial advisement 
will enhance the even balance of the trial court’s statement to 
defendants regarding the right to testify or the right not to 
testify. See Lewis,
 94 Hawai #i at 295, 12 P.3d at 1236.

4. 
Although the court’s advisement did not inform Monteil 
that his silence could not be used against him if he did not 
testify, “there is nothing to indicate his decision to testify 
was anything other than voluntarily, knowingly, and 
intelligently made.” Lewis, 94 Hawai #i at 296-97, 12 P.3d at 
1237-38. 
“Thus, there can be no [finding of] error premised on 
[the] lack of judicial advice” in this case.12 Id. at 296, 12 
P.3d at 1237.
