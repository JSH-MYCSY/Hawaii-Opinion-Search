ORDER DISMISSING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Petitioner/defendant-appellee’s Kawaiaha' o Church and 
William Haole, in his official capacity as the Chair of the Board 
of Trustees and Chair of the Board of Directors of Kawaiaha' o Church, seek review of the ICA’s September 28, 2012 order
 
granting Respondent/plaintiff-appellant Dana Naone Hall’s second
 motion for a preliminary injunction pending appeal and the
 October 12, 2012 order denying their motion for reconsideration
 of the injunction order. Neither the injunction order nor the
 reconsideration order are reviewable by this court by application
 for a writ of certiorari. See HRS § 602-59(a) (Supp. 2011). 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for a writ of
 
certiorari is dismissed.
