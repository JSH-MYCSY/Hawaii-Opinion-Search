OCTOBER 8, 2013
 
RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, ACOBA, McKENNA, AND POLLACK, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J.
 
Daniel S. Nakano was charged with Operating a Vehicle 
Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of 
Hawai
'i Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 291E-61(a)(1), (a)(3), and 
(b)(1). Nakano entered a conditional no contest plea as to HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), conditioned on his ability to appeal on the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
ground that the charge was defective because it did not allege a
 
state of mind. The State consented to the conditional plea. 
Although Nakano’s written submission of plea form contained a
 conditional plea only to the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) method of proof,
 the district court convicted Nakano of OVUII under both HRS
 §§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3).
1
 
On appeal, the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) 
determined that the district court’s judgment should be vacated as to the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) method of proof based on this court’s decision in State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 276 P.3d 
617 (2012). The ICA further vacated Nakano’s conviction as to HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), but determined that, on remand, the State could proceed to prosecute Nakano under the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) method of proof. In his application, Nakano argues that the ICA violated his right to due process in remanding the HRS § 291E­61(a)(3) method of proof for further proceedings. 
We conclude that the State cannot prosecute Nakano
 
under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3). Although the State did not explicitly
 agree to give up the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) method of proof, it
 appears to have agreed to Nakano’s no contest plea under HRS
 § 291E-61(a)(1), and any ambiguity as to what the State agreed to
 should be construed in favor of Nakano. Accordingly, we affirm
 the ICA’s judgment vacating the district court’s judgment, but

-2­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
clarify that, on remand, the State is precluded from prosecuting
 
Nakano under the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) method of proof.
 
I. Background
 
The following factual background is taken from the
 
record on appeal.
 
A. District Court Proceedings
 
On June 27, 2011, the State filed a complaint against
 
Nakano, alleging he committed the offense of OVUII “in violation
 
of Section 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) of the [HRS].” The
 complaint did not contain a state of mind allegation.
 
At a proceeding on January 23, 2012, the deputy
 
prosecuting attorney (DPA) informed the district court that the
 prosecution and the defense had “come to a conditional plea
 agreement” that “Nakano will be pleading No Contest to 291E­61(a)(1)(b)(1) and --” Defense counsel then stated:
 
That’s true, Judge.  And we have the form in
 
front of you.
The conditional plea is raised, as you know, the
issue of whether state of mind is required to be
charged in a written complaint charging DUI[.] . . .
So we are preserving that issue for appeal, otherwise
we’re doing a conditional plea.
 
Nakano submitted a Written Submission of Plea form, in
 
which he initialed the following statements: “I plead . . . No
 
Contest to the following charge(s): HRS 261E-61(a)(1) and
 (b)(1)[.] . . . This is a conditional plea under HRPP Rule
 11(a)(2) - Defendant is preserving the issue of the requirement
 of state of mind being charged in the written Complaint.” 
-3­ 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(Emphasis added).
 
The following exchange then occurred at the proceeding:
 
THE COURT:	 Okay.  (Indiscernible) stipulate to a
factual ba
sis.[ 2
]
[Defense]:	 Yes. 
 There’s already a written charge, so
we waive public reading of the written
charge.  And although our argument is that
the charge is defective because it doesn’t
include state of mind.
 
The DPA then asked to re-arraign Nakano, and Nakano
 
objected. The district court denied the DPA’s request in light
 
of a pending appeal of an unrelated case on the same issue, and
 because mens rea was a material element and the “original charge
 should have been dismissed without prejudice and recharged with
 the mens rea language.” The district court continued:
 
THE COURT:	 The written filed complaint . . . has been
filed, and that is what the defense is
entering a No Contest Plea to.
Conditionally, that if the Supreme Court
overturns the ICA decision regarding mens
rea that they will be allowed to withdraw
the plea, correct?
 
[Defense]:	 Yes.  I guess, basically, Judge, what I’m
arguing is that the charge, as it’s
written, should be dismissed because it’s
defective.  If you deny the motion, yes,
then we’re -- which I’m making, then we’re
preserving that issue on a conditional
plea.
THE COURT:	 Okay. . . . [Y]our oral motion is denied.
 
The following exchange then occurred regarding Nakano’s
 
plea of No Contest:
 
THE COURT:	 . . . Okay, so your client’s making a
conditional plea -­
[Defense]:	 Yes.
 
2
 Because the transcript is indiscernible, it is unclear whether
 
defense counsel stipulated to a factual basis to the entire charge as set
forth in the complaint, i.e., HRS §§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3), or only to HRS
§ 291E-61(a)(1), as reflected in the Written Submission of Plea form. 
-4­3 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
THE COURT: -- on the original charge?
 
[Defense]: Yes.
 
THE COURT:  Okay.  And waive formal reading of that
charge is stipulated to a factual basis?
 
[Defense]:  Yes.
 
THE COURT: Okay.  Submit -­[Defense]: Again, preserving our issue for appeal.
THE COURT: All right.
Okay.
  So, Mr. Nakano, you
previously received a filed copy of the
complaint for driving under the influence. 
It’s a first offense.  The violation date
 was June 10th, 2011.  You understand that
 charge?
 
[Nakano]:
 Yes.
 
THE COURT: Okay.  And what’s your plea?
 [Nakano]: No Contest.
 THE COURT: Okay.  No Contest, okay.
No Co
ntest means you’re not
contesting the charge, but you were found
guilty for sentencing.  You understand?
 
[Nakano]:	 
Yes.
 
THE COURT:
	 Okay.  And Court did receive a change of
plea form, okay.  It’s stating in
captions: “Condition.”  Your No Contest
 Plea is conditional and that is based on
 your attorney’s arguments before this
court.
 
[Defense]:
 And I did -- I did write at the end of the
 
plea form . . . what the issue is, Judge.
 
THE COURT: Right.
That this is a conditional plea
under [HRPP] Rule 11(a)(2). [ 3
]  Defendant
 
is preserving the issue of the requirement
of 
state of mind being charged in the
written complaint.
 
[Defense]: Yes
.
 
THE COURT:  Yeah, that’s what it is, right?  Okay.
Any q
uestions about the form?
 
[Nakano]: No.
 
THE COURT: Okay.  You also reviewed the penalties?
 [Nakano]: Yes.
 THE COURT: . . . Knowing [the available] penalties,
you s
till want to enter a No Contest Plea?
 
[Nakano]:  Yes.
 
THE COURT: Okay.  You’re giving up your right to a
 
HRPP 
Rule 11(a)(2) (Supp. 2011) provides:
 
Conditional Pleas.  With the approval of the court and
the consent of the State, a defendant may enter a
conditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere,
reserving in writing the right, on appeal from the
judgment, to seek review of the adverse determination
of any specific pretrial motion.  A defendant who
 prevails on appeal shall be allowed to withdraw the
plea.
 
-5­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
trial and to have the State prove this
charge beyond a reasonable doubt.  You
 understand that?
 
[Nakano]: Yes.
 THE COURT: And d
 o you want to say anything about this
offense or
 sentencing?
 
[Nakano]: No.
 THE C 
OURT: No?
 
I will acc
ept the No Contest Plea;
find you guilty as charged. (Inaudible)
knowing, voluntarily, and intelligent.
 
(Emphases added). 
The district court then sentenced Nakano, but stayed
 
the sentence pending appeal. 
The district court subsequently entered its Order and
 
Notice of Entry of Order reflecting the acceptance of the No
 
Contest plea and imposing the aforementioned sentence. 
The Order
 
and Notice of Entry of Order identified one count against Nakano
 -- “HRS 291E-61(a)(1)(3)(b)(1)” -- and noted that it had accepted
 Nakano’s nolo contendere plea on that count.
4 Nakano timely
 
filed a notice of appeal. 
B. ICA Appeal
 
While Nakano’s appeal was pending, but before filing of
 
Nakano’s opening brief, this court decided State v. Nesmith, 127
 
Hawai
'i 48, 276 P.3d 617 (2012), in which we held that an HRS 
4
 In his application, Nakano argues that the district court did not
 
convict him of the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) charge.  However, the district court’s
Order and Notice of Entry of Order indicates that the charge in Count 1
included both HRS §§ 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3), and that the district court
accepted Nakano’s plea of no contest on this “[c]ount[.]”  Thus, it appears
the district court did erroneously convict Nakano on both methods of proof,
despite his conditional plea only to HRS § 291E-61(a)(1).
 
-6­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
§ 291E-61(a)(1) charge that omitted mens rea was deficient.5  In
his opening brief, Nakano argued based on  Nesmith that the
district court erred in denying his oral motion to dismiss the
HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) complaint.  Nakano specifically argued:
“[T]his Court should allow [Nakano] to withdraw his plea on
remand in this case pursuant to HRPP Rule 11(a)(2) and order that
the case be dismissal [sic] by the District Court for lack of
jurisdiction because the Complaint fails to state a proper
charge.” 
In its answering brief, the State acknowledged that the
omission of a state of mind from the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge
rendered it defective under Nesmith.   However, the State asserted
that Nakano was charged with violating either HRS §§ 291E-
61(a)(1) or (a)(3), and in light of this court’s decision in
Nesmith, “a state of mind was not required for the HRS § 291E-
61(a)(3) OVUII charge, therefore the charge was not defective
with regard to OVUII charged pursuant to HRS § 291E-61(a)(3).”  
5In Nesmith, the defendants were each charged with OVUII in
violation of HRS §§ “291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3)[.]”  127 Hawai #i at 50, 276
P.3d at 619.  The complaints against each defendant did not allege mens rea,
and the defendants timely moved to dismiss their respective complaints basedon the argument that the State failed to allege an essential fact, i.e., mensrea.  Id. at 51, 276 P.3d at 620.  The trial court denied the motions todismiss and subsequently found both defendants guilty as charged.  Id.  Thiscourt held that the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge must allege mens rea and wastherefore deficient, but that the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) charge was sufficientbecause HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) is a strict liability offense.  Id. at 53, 276
P.3d at 622.  This court further held that HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3) “caneach serve as the basis for a conviction under HRS § 291E-61.”  Id. at 61, 276P.3d at 630.  Because the case had proceeded to trial and there was sufficientevidence to support the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) method of proof, this court upheldthe district court’s judgments of conviction and sentence under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3).  Id.
-7-***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The State further asserted that “on remand [Nakano’s] conviction
 
and sentence for his no contest plea to the OVUII charge based on
 HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) should be affirmed[.]” 
Nakano filed a reply brief and argued that the HRS
 
§ 291E-61(a)(1) charge must be dismissed without prejudice. In
 addition, Nakano contended that he did not enter a plea to the
 HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) charge, and therefore, “there is no reason to
 address the (a)(3) charge, and the entire Complaint should be
 dismissed without prejudice.” 
On April 17, 2013, the ICA filed an initial summary
 
disposition order (SDO) affirming the district court’s judgment
 as to his conviction under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), but vacating his
 conviction under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1). Nakano filed a motion for
 reconsideration and argued that he did not plead to the charge
 under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3). The ICA filed an Order granting the
 motion for reconsideration, and ordered that the April 17, 2013
 SDO be vacated and that a new SDO be filed. 
In its April 26, 2013 SDO, the ICA determined:
 
Based on the Hawai 'i Supreme Court’s decision in
State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai 'i 48, 61, 276 P.3d 617,
630 (2012), we conclude that the complaint was
sufficient to charge OVUII in violation of HRS § 291E­61(a)(3), but was insufficient to charge OVUII inviolation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1).  Thus, no effectivecharge against Nakano under HRS § 291[E]-61(a)(1)existed, but the State was entitled to proceed totrial on the OVUII offense charged under HRS § 291E­61(a)(3).  However, where no trial ensued on the(a)(3) offense, and where Nakano neither entered a nocontest plea nor stipulated to a factual basis for theOVUII charge under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), no proof hasyet been adduced to support a conviction under HRS 
-8­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
§ 291E-61(a)(3), and said conviction cannot be
sustained.
 
State v. Nakano, No. CAAP-12-0000106, 2013 WL 1789414, *1 (Haw.
 
App. Apr. 26, 2013).
 
Accordingly, the ICA vacated the district court’s
 
judgment and remanded the case to the district court for further
 proceedings. 
Id.
 
Nakano filed a motion for reconsideration and argued:
 
The problem with [the April 26, 2013 SDO] is
that it gives the State an inappropriate “second bite
at the apple” on the HRS [§] 291E-61(a)(3) charge.
  
The date [Nakano] entered a conditional plea on the
(a)(1) charge was the trial date for the (a)(1) and
(a)(3) charges. [Nakano] offered to enter a
conditional plea on the (a)(1) charge, and the State
chose not to proceed on the (a)(3) charge.  By
allowing [Nakano] to enter the conditional plea only
to the (a)(1) charge, the State chose to put an end to
the litigation of the charge of OVUII which is a
single offense 
(see State v. Grindles, 70 Haw. 528,
777 P.2d 1187 (1989)) even though there are multiple
ways ((a)(1) and (a)(3)) to prove the single OVUII
offense.  By allowing [Nakano] to enter the
conditional plea, which requires the consent of the
State . . . to only the (a)(1) charge, the State was
consenting to give up proceeding on the (a)(3) method
of proving the OVUII charge. . . .  As the Hawaii
 
Supreme Court stated in Grindles, it would be a
violation of a defendant’s due process right to a fair
trial to allow an OVUII charge . . . to be bifurcated. 
Put another way, it would have been inappropriate for
the trial court in this case to have allowed a plea
only resolving the (a)(1) charge and allow the (a)(3)
charge to “hang out there.”
 
On May 7, 2013, the ICA issued an order denying
 
Nakano’s motion for reconsideration. State v. Nakano , No. CAAP­
12-0000106, 2013 WL 1905111, at *1 (Haw. App. May 7, 2013) (Order
 
Denying Motion for Reconsideration). The ICA stated, in relevant
 part:
 
-9­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Grindles is inapposite, where it concerned
viola
tions of due process and the right against self-
incrimination by the district court’s requiring the
defendant to testify (as to one method of DUI) before
conclusion of the State’s evidence (on another method
of DUI) in a bifurcated trial.  In the instant case,
where no effective (a)(1) charge existed because of a
lack of alleged mens rea, Nakano was not placed in
jeopardy by that defective charge.  Additionally, the
record does not reflect that the State or the district
 court understood that Nakano was pleading only to
(a)(1), where no confirmation of such by the State
occurred, and where the district court inquired if
Nakano was pleading “as charged,” to which Nakano’s
counsel answered in the affirmative, and then the
district court proceeded to convict Nakano under
(a)(3) in addition to (a)(1).  Thus, the State’s right
to proceed to trial notwithstanding the plea does not
prejudice Nakano’s right to due process.
 
Id. (footnotes omitted).
 
II. Standard of Review
 
The appellate court reviews questions of constitutional
 
law de novo under the “right/wrong” standard and, thus, exercises
 
its “own independent judgment based on the facts of the case.” 
State v. Jenkins, 93 Hawai' i 87, 100, 997 P.2d 13, 26 (2000) 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
 
III. Discussion
 
A.	 On remand, the State may not prosecute Nakano under the HRS
§ 291E-61(a)(3) method of proof
 
It is undisputed that the complaint against Nakano
 
failed to allege a mens rea and, therefore, was insufficient to
 
charge a violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1). See Nesmith , 127
 
Hawai'i at 61, 276 P.3d at 630. Accordingly, on remand, the 
charge of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) should be dismissed without
 prejudice. State v. Spearman, 129 Hawai' i 146, 151-52, 296 P.3d 
-10­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
359, 364-65 (2013). However, because the complaint alleged both
 
the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3) methods of proof, this court
 must determine whether the State is permitted to proceed under
 HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) on remand. Nakano asserts that the State is
 precluded from proceeding under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) because it
 “gave up” that method of proof when it “agreed” to Nakano’s no
 contest plea solely under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1). For the reasons
 set forth below, we agree with Nakano and conclude that the State
 may not proceed on the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) method of proof. 
As noted, Nakano was charged with OVUII under two
 
alternative methods of proof: HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) (providing that
 a person commits OVUII when he or she operates a vehicle “[w]hile
 under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair
 the person’s normal mental faculties or ability to care for the
 person and guard against casualty”), and HRS § 291E-61(a)(3)
 (providing that a person commits OVUII when he or she operates a
 vehicle “[w]ith .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten
 liters of breath”). Nakano filed a Written Submission of Plea
 Form in which he entered a plea of no contest solely to the HRS
 § 291E-61(a)(1) method of proof. The form was silent with
 respect to HRS § 291E-61(a)(3). The State consented to the
 conditional plea at a hearing. See HRPP Rule 11(a)(2) (“With the
 
approval of the court and the consent of the State, a defendant
 may enter a conditional plea of guilty or nolo contendere,
 
-11­ 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
reserving the right, on appeal from the judgment, to seek review
 
of the adverse determination of any specific pretrial motion.”
 (emphasis added)). However, the transcript of the hearing
 reveals some ambiguity as to the State’s and the district court’s
 understandings of the plea.
 
As noted, at the start of the hearing, the DPA informed
 
the court that “Nakano will be pleading No Contest to 291E­61(a)(1)(b)(1) and --” The district court subsequently asked
 whether Nakano was pleading no contest “on the original charge,”
 to which defense counsel stated, “Yes.” However, the district
 court also asked whether Nakano understood the Submission of Plea
 Form, which contained a plea only as to HRS § 291E-61(a)(1).
6
 
The district court then found Nakano guilty “as charged,” and
 defense counsel did not object to that determination.
7
 
At no time did the parties or the district court
 
reference the disposition of the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) charge. 
Moreover, the record contains no explicit agreement by the State
 that it intended to forego proceeding under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3). 
Nevertheless, the State indicated that it had “come to a
 
6 HRPP Rule 11(c)(1) provides: “Advice to defendant.  The court
 
shall not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere without first addressing
the defendant personally in open court and determining that the defendant
understands . . . the nature of the charge to which the plea is offered[.]”
 
7
 Although the district court entered judgment as to the HRS § 291E­
61(a)(3) method of proof, the record does not establish that Nakano in fact
pleaded no contest to that method of proof, particularly when the Written
Submission of Plea form indicated that Nakano was only entering a plea under
HRS § 291E-61(a)(1).  Accordingly, the district court should not have entered
judgment against Nakano on the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) method of proof.
 
-12­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
conditional plea agreement” with Nakano, provided its consent to 
the conditional plea, and acknowledged at the hearing that Nakano was pleading “No Contest to 291E-61(a)(1)(b)(1) and –-” At the very least, the agreement between the State and Nakano was ambiguous as to the status of the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) method of proof, and any ambiguity in the plea agreement is strictly construed in favor of the defendant. See State v. Abbott, 79 
Hawai'i 317, 320, 901 P.2d 1296, 1299 (App. 1995) (“[A] plea 
agreement containing terms that are ambiguous or reasonably susceptible to different interpretations is strictly construed in favor of the defendant.”). 
Thus, we construe the State as having given up its 
ability to prosecute Nakano under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) in exchange for his conditional plea under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1). Put another way, the State’s consent to the conditional plea reflected a plea agreement between the State and Nakano, i.e., the defendant pled no contest and gave up his constitutional rights with respect to the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) method of proof, in exchange for the State’s agreement not to proceed under the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) method of proof. See State v. Adams, 76 Hawai' i 408, 412, 879 
P.2d 513, 517 (1994) (“A plea agreement is essentially a contract entered into between the State and the defendant, in which the defendant agrees to plead guilty or no contest to a charge and to forego certain constitutional rights (including the right to 
-13­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
trial) in exchange for which the State promises some form of
 
leniency or cooperation in prosecution.”). 
In these circumstances, allowing the State to prosecute 
Nakano under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) would allow the State to avoid its end of the bargain, and would thereby violate Nakano’s due process rights. See State v. Miller, 122 Hawai' i 92, 100-01, 223 
P.3d 157, 165-66 (2010). It is well settled in this jurisdiction that the “state is bound by the terms of a plea agreement which serves as the inducement or consideration for a defendant’s guilty or no-contest plea.” Abbott, 79 Hawai' i at 319, 901 P.2d 
at 1298 (citing Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262 (1971)). “When a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.” Santobello, 404 U.S. at 262 (emphasis added). 
In Adams, the defendant Barton J. Adams was charged 
with 21 counts of fraud and theft. 76 Hawai' i at 409, 879 P.2d 
at 514. Adams agreed with the State to plead no contest to one count of fraud in exchange for, inter alia, the State’s promise to “stand silent . . . and not oppose” his requests for a deferred acceptance of his no contest plea and for no jail time. Id. The State subsequently submitted a “sharply critical” seven-
page “statement” to the Adult Probation Division. Id. Adams 
moved to withdraw his plea, but the circuit court denied the 
-14­***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
motion. Id. On appeal, this court determined that the State’s
 
“statement” violated the plea agreement. Id. This court stated,
 
“because a plea agreement ‘implicates constitutional
 
considerations -- including the fairness and voluntariness of the
 plea,’” “the terms of a plea agreement, which serve as the
 inducement for entering a plea, must be fulfilled . . . . 
Indeed, due process requires that the State uphold its end of the
 bargain.” Id. at 412, 414, 879 P.2d at 517, 519. This court
 
further concluded, “where a defendant is denied due process
 because the prosecution violates a plea agreement, there is
 manifest injustice as a matter of law[.]” Id. at 414, 879 P.2d
 
at 519. Because this court determined that the State breached
 the plea agreement, it vacated the circuit court’s order denying
 Adams’s motion to withdraw his no contest plea. Id. at 415, 879
 
P.2d 520.
 
Recently, in Miller, this court reaffirmed the holding 
of Adams and concluded that within the context of the State’s agreement to take no position on a defendant’s motion for deferred acceptance of no contest plea at sentencing, the State breached the plea agreement, which thereby implicated the defendant’s due process rights. 122 Hawai' i at 100-01, 223 P.3d 
at 165-66. In addition, this court, citing the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Santobello, concluded that “based on the breach alone, the case must be remanded in ‘the interests of 
-15­

justice,’ regardless of prejudice, because, in the case of a plea 
agreement, the prosecutor’s ‘promise must be fulfilled.’” Miller, 122 Hawai' i at 100-01, 223 P.3d at 165-66. This court 
concluded, “Under Hawai' i precedent, . . . a breach [of a plea 
agreement] implicates due process, and the interests of justice.” Id. at 101, 223 P.3d at 166 (citations and quotation marks omitted). 
In the circumstances presented here, permitting the 
State to proceed with prosecution under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) would constitute a breach of the plea agreement in violation of Nakano’s due process rights. Accordingly, on remand, the State is precluded from prosecuting Nakano under the HRS § 291E­61(a)(3) method of proof. Since Nakano can be given the benefit of the plea agreement and has not sought to withdraw the plea, we have no occasion to consider whether any circumstances may exist that would support a motion to withdraw the plea, if a motion was filed by Nakano on remand. See Adams, 76 Hawai' i at 414, 879 
P.2d at 519.

8 Nevertheless, we recognize that, ordinarily, a defendant who 
successfully rescinds a plea agreement is returned to their status prior to
their plea agreement, meaning the defendant must again face all of the chargesin the original complaint.  See Adams, 76 Hawai 'i at 414 n.5, 879 P.2d at 519
n.5 (noting that “a defendant who elects to have a violated plea agreement
rescinded must plead again to all charges in the original indictment”). 
However, in the instant case, it is not necessary to attack the plea agreement
in order to vacate Nakano’s conviction. 
In this sense, United States v. Barron, 172 F.3d 1153 (9th Cir.
1999), is instructive.  There, the defendant, William Scott Barron, pled
guilty to three counts in exchange for the government agreeing to refrain from
bringing other, unspecified charges and to refrain from seeking a life

sentence.  Id. at 1155.  One of the relevant counts in the plea agreement
After
 the plea was entered, the United States Supreme Court determined in an
unrelated case that the relevant “use” of a firearm required “active
employment” of the firearm.  Id. at 1156 (citing Bailey v. United States, 516
 U.S. 137, 143 (1995)).  Barron then sought to set aside his conviction and
sentence on the firearm count.  Id. at 1156.  The government conceded that the
facts did not justify Barron’s conviction, but a dispute arose as to whether
the entire plea agreement involving all three counts should be rescinded.  Id. 
The Ninth Circuit concluded that Barron was not required to
withdraw his plea as to all three counts in order to set aside his invalid
conviction.  Id. at 1156, 1161.  In support of its conclusion, the court noted
that “Barron’s motion purely and simply asked the district court to vacate a
conviction that was void as a matter of law.  The motion did not attack the
 plea agreement in any way.”  Id. at 1158.  Moreover, the court noted that,
because the firearm conviction was invalid, “[a]s an initial matter the
government could not have said, ‘You are innocent of using a gun, but if
you’ll plead to it, we’ll give up charging you for your career offenses.’” 
Id. at 1159.
 
These considerations are particularly apt where, as here, the
defendant conditionally pled no contest on the express condition that he be
permitted to challenge the validity of the charge, and the charge ultimately
was ruled invalid.  As in Barron, the State could not have, in the first
instance, required Nakano to plead to an invalid charge in exchange for
refraining from prosecuting him under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3).  Allowing the State
to pursue that charge now that the invalid conviction has been vacated would
give the State the benefit of a bargain to which Nakano did not agree.
Moreover, the State was well aware of the potential that the HRS § 291E­61(a)(1) charge would be ruled invalid, given the discussions on the record
regarding this court having accepted an application for a writ of certiorari
in Nesmith . Accordingly, the State “could have anticipated the contingency
that has arisen and included a provision protecting the government’s interest
in the event [the] conviction was vacated; that the government did not do so
does not justify recission of the agreement.”   Barron, 172 F.3d at 1161.
