OPINION  OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.
  
I. Introduction 
This case 
arises from Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant 
Joseph Vaimili’s (“Vaimili[’s]”) convictions for sex trafficking 
related crimes based on his conduct as a pimp for the

complaining witness ( “CW”) who came to Hawai i to work as a 
prostitute during the 2009 Pro Bowl. 
In brief summary, at his trial, Vaimili was present 
for voir dire and jury selection; however, he failed to appear 
in court two days later despite being instructed to do so.  The 
trial was continued two times over the course of one month, 
first for five days, at which time the circuit court found that 
Vaimili had voluntarily absented himself from the proceedings, 
and again for twenty-one days, after which the circuit court 
conducted trial in absentia. 
Vaimili challenges the State’s pleading of the charges 
against him in the disjunctive and the circuit court’s conducting trial in absentia, presenting four issues on 
certiorari: 
1.  Whether the ICA  [Intermediate Court of Appeals]  gravely 
erred in holding that the charges against Vaimili were 
not defective where they were phrased in the 
disjunctive?  
2.  Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that Vaimili’s  
counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge the 
charges as defective where they were phrased in the 
disjunctive?  
3.  Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that the 
proceedings in this case “commenced” for purposes of 
HRPP [Hawaii  Rules of Penal Procedure] Rule 43 when the 
process of jury selection begins?  
4.  Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that the 
circuit court did not violate Vaimili’s constitutional 
right to be present where it proceeded to trial in his 
absence?  
Questions 1, 2, and 4 were raised as points of error before the 
ICA. Question 3 concerns an issue of first impression in this

for purposes of HRPP Rule 43 when jury selection begins.

third person. 
Jeffrey T. Arakaki (“Arakaki” or “trial counsel”) was 
appointed to represent Vaimili. 
On April 6, 2010, during a hearing on certain pretrial 
motions, trial counsel requested that Vaimili’s presence be 
waived. The State informed the circuit court that it had 
information that Vaimili had left Hawai i, and that the bail bond 
company had gone to San Francisco to try to locate him.  The 
State also explained that Vaimili’s bail was set for $250,000 
because of the high risk of his leaving the state. The circuit court ordered a trial call for the following week and required 
Vaimili to be present in court. 
On April 13, 2010, Vaimili was present in court for 
the trial call. Ida Peppers (“Peppers”) , who stated that she 
was a representative of the bail bond company and also Vaimili’s 
employer in a restaurant, reported to the circuit court that she 
and Linda Del Rio (“Del Rio”) , an employee of the bail bond 
company, were in California looking for another person, not Vaimili. Vaimili denied that he had traveled to the mainland 
while on bail, instead asserting that he had been at work. The 
circuit court clarified with Vaimili that he “ cannot leave this 
island without this Court ’s permission[,]” and continued the 
5
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
trial call to the following week to permit additional witnesses 
to be called on the issue of whether Vaimili had left Hawai i.  
At the hearing on April 22, 2010, a district court 
clerk (“court clerk”) testified that on April 1st, Del Rio 
informed the clerk that Vaimili had forfeited his $250,000 bail, 
and that she was going to travel to San Francisco to bring him 
back. The court clerk, however, did not know whether Vaimili 
had actually left the jurisdiction. Del Rio testified that 
“Vaimili never left the State of Hawaii[,]” and that she went to 
San Francisco to search for two other people. The circuit court 
concluded that the evidence presented was insufficient to prove 
an intentional violation of the conditions of bail by Vaimili.  
The circuit court found that “Del Rio’s credibility is an 
issue[,]” and that the court clerk was more credib le. The 
circuit court modified Vaimili’s bail conditions, subjecting 
Vaimili to electronic monitoring and imposing a curfew.  
On June 15, 2010, Vaimili apparently failed to appear 
on time for morning proceedings, for which the circuit court 
issued the following reprimand: 
Mr. Vaimili, you were supposed to be here this 
morning. And I know your attorney told you you didn’t have 
to, [sic] but at the last hearing I made it clear all 
parties be here. Henceforth, whenever you have to come to 
this courtroom, you have to come -- you have to be here, regardless of what somebody else tells you just be here.  
And be here on time b ecause if you’re not on time, I’m 
going to take you into custody.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
On Monday, June 21, 2010, Vaimili was present for jury 
selection and voir dire, which began and was completed that day.  
After the jury was selected, the circuit court informed the 
jurors, in Vaimili’s presence, that trial would resume on 
Wednesday at 9:00 a.m., instructed the jurors to arrive at 8:45 a.m., and informed the jurors that he would swear them in on 
Wednesday before proceeding with opening statements and 
evidence. 
On Wednesday, June 23, 2010, Vaimili failed to appear.  
Trial counsel represented that he had spoken to Vaimili the day 
before because they planned to meet, but that Vaimili failed to 
show up for their meeting and thereafter did not respond to any 
of his contacts.  Trial counsel explained that when he attempted 
to contact Vaimili by phone, Vaimili’s phone number “indicated 
that he would not take any calls at that point in tim e.”
7 
At that point, the circuit court asked counsel how the 
case should proceed in light of Vaimil i’s absence, explaining 
that trial in absentia could proceed because “Vaimili 
voluntarily absented himself from the trial[,]” or he “could 
also discharge the jury[,]” which had not been sworn in yet. 
Trial counsel preferred to have Vaimili present and requested a continuance until Vaimili either “show[ed] up” or was “picked

calls were just when I call his phone number the phone number just indicated 
that he would not take any calls at that point in time.”

up[.]” The circuit court issued a bench warrant, ordered 
forfeiture of Vaimili’s bond , and continued trial for five days 
to the following Monday, June 28, 2010. 
On June 28, 2010, the State filed a “Memorandum on 
Trial In Absentia[,]” asserting , inter alia, that:  (1) Vaimili 
was present in court when trial commenced with jury selection; 
(2) Vaimili was present in court when the State confirmed that 
the CW was on O ahu and prepared to testify at trial; (3) Vaimili 
did not return to court thereafter, and thus, voluntarily 
absented himself from the proceedings; and (4) the public’s 
interest in going forward with the trial outweighed Vaimili’s 
right to be present. The State further represented that (1) on 
June 15, 2010, Vaimili notified the Intake Service Center 
(“ISC”) that the telephone to which his electronic monitor was 
attached had been disconnected, and that the ISC had not heard 
from him since June 17, 2010 despite his having an appointment 
with ISC the week of June 21, 2010; (2) since Vaimili’s non -
appearance in court on June 23, 2010, police officers and 
sheriffs had been actively looking for Vaimili on O ahu at places 
he was known to frequent, but had been unable to find him; (3) 
on June 23, 2010, Vaimili had reportedly been at the Honolulu 
International Airport preparing to board a flight to San 
Francisco; and (4) because Vaimili had absconded, the CW, who 
8
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
had been brought from the mainland to Hawai i to testify at 
trial, was “obligated to remain on the Island of Oahu for an 
additional week at significant expense, inconvenience and emotional distress to the [CW], who fear[ed] [that Vaimili] and 
his friends w[ould] attempt to keep her from testifying against 
him.” 
Trial counsel then informed the circuit court that he 
had not had any contact with Vaimili, and that Del Rio told him 
that morning that they had not located him.  The circuit court 
noted that “it received several phone calls from Ms. Del Rio 
indicating that she was at the airport anticipating that Mr. 
Vaimili was -- maybe leaving the jurisdiction and that she was soliciting the assistance of law enforcement authorities to 
assist her in locating and apprehending [him].” The circuit 
court therefore found that under HRPP Rule 43, “Vaimili [had] 
voluntarily and intelligently absent[ed] himself from the 
proceedings.” 
The circuit court called in the jury, advised them 
that the trial would be continued to July 19, 2010, and asked if anyone would be unavailable. The circuit court excused a juror 
who stated that she was going back to the mainland on July 15th, 
and replaced her with the first alternate. The circuit court 
then asked the jurors whether they had heard anything about the 
case outside of the courtroom, questioned two jurors who 
9
  
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
answered affirmatively, outside of the presence of the other 
jurors, and permitted trial counsel and the State an opportunity 
to question them. The two jurors stated that what they had been 
told would not impact their ability to be fair and impartial, 
and the circuit court kept the two jurors on the jury. The 
circuit court then addressed the entire jury and instructed them 
to return on July 19th. 
The circuit court also denied Vaimili’s motion to 
dismiss his charges for alleged discovery violations, and Natasha Cambra (“Cambra”), a co-defendant whose case had been 
consolidated with Vaimili’s case for trial, pled guilty to 
unlawful imprisonment pursuant to a plea agreement. 
Vaimili had not been located by July 19, 2010.  Trial 
counsel objected to trial in absentia, arguing tha t “the public 
interest in continuing this trial does not in fact supersede [Vaimili’s] right to be present, [nor] his right to confront . . 
. his accusers[,]” and that the State had not shown that Vaimili was voluntarily absent. Trial counsel also informed the court 
that he had last spoken to Vaimili on June 22, the day after 
jury selection, and that they had scheduled to meet. Trial 
counsel further stated that he attempted to contact Vaimili “a 
number of times[]” through a phone number provided by Vaimil i, 
including an attempt made as recently as one or two weeks previously, but that he did not respond to any of those calls.  
10
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Trial counsel also stated that Peppers confirmed with him that 
the number he was using to reach Vaimili was “not a number that 
he can be reached at[,]” and that Peppers was “presently on the 
mainland looking for Mr. Vaimili.” 
Citing HRPP Rule 43, the circuit court ruled in 
relevant part as follows: 
[T]he defendant shall be considered to have waived the 
right to be present whenever a defendant initially present 
is voluntarily absent after the hearing or trial is 
commenced. In this particular case, Mr. Vaimili was 
informed that the —-after jury selection that the trial 
will commence at 9:00 on the 23rd. Mr. Vaimili was 
instructed to be here I believe at 8:30. He had been 
previously admonished by this court that irregardless [sic] 
of what anybody might tell him that he is required to be 
present at all proceedings and that ’s why the court even 
imposed conditions on Mr. Vaimili short of revoking his 
bail. 
As counsel recall there was a motion to revoke Mr. 
Vaimili’s bail because of allegations that Mr. Vaimili had 
left the jurisdiction to the State of California, and the witness that would bear fruit to that was Ms. Del Rio. 
However, at the hearing Ms. Del Rio had indicated that that 
was not correct, and therefore the court had no basis to 
grant the motion. However, given the seriousness of the 
offense, the court nevertheless imposed the conditions that it did on Mr. Vaimili only later be [sic] confronted on 
June 23rd of Mr. Vaimili ’s failure to appear. The court 
even continued the matter to allow [trial counsel] or Ms. 
Del Rio to find Mr. Vaimili. And to this date, Mr. Vaimili 
has yet to appear before this court. Therefore, the court, under Rule 43 of the Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure, will 
proceed without Mr. Vaim ili’s presence. 
The circuit court then proceeded to swear in the jury, 
and instructed the jury that Vaimili had “voluntarily elected 
not to be present at trial[,]” and that the jury shall not use 
or consider Vaimili’s absence to determine his guilt or 
11

  
 
 
 
    
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
                         
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
innocence of the charges and shall not use Vaimili’s absence “as 
evidence that [he] is a person of bad characte r.”8 
On July 22, 2010, the jury found Vaimili guilty as 
charged on all five counts. 
On or about October 14, 2011, Vaimili was arrested in 
Texas and returned to Hawai i for sentencing. 
On February 21, 2012, Vaimili appeared before the 
circuit court for sentencing. The circuit court imposed 
mandatory minimum terms of incarceration based on Vaimili’s 
status as a repeat offender, 
sentencing him to forty years of 
imprisonment as follows: ten years on counts 1 and 2, and five years on count 3 to run concurrently, ten years on count 4 to run consecutively to the sentences on counts 1 through 3, and 20 
years on count 5 to run consecutively to the sentences on counts 
1 through 4. 
On February 24, 2012, Vaimili appealed the Judgment to 
the ICA. 
8 Relevant to the State’s charging Vaimili with altern ative acts, 
the circuit court also instructed the jury as follows: 
The law allows the introduction of evidence for the 
purpose of showing that there is more than one act upon 
which proof of an element of an offense may be based. In order for the prosecution to prove an element, all twelve 
jurors must unanimously agree that the same act has been 
proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  
12
  
 
 
 
   
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
On April 12, 2012, Arakaki filed a motion to withdraw 
as counsel, which the ICA granted. Thereafter, Jeffrey A. Hawk was appointed counsel for Vaimili, effective June 4, 2012. 
B. Appeal to the ICA 
On appeal to the ICA,  Vaimili argued that his 
conviction should be  vacated because: (1) the charges against 
him were fatally defective due to the State’s charging him in 
the disjunctive, which allegedly failed to provide him with 
adequate notice of the alleged offenses; (2) his trial counsel 
provided ineffective assistance by failing to raise the charging 
issue; and (3) the circuit court deprived Vaimili of his 
constitutional right to be present at trial by holding trial in 
his absence after he failed to appear.    
The ICA affirmed the circuit court’s Judgment in a 
published Opinion, stating its holdings as follows:  
(1) consistent with . . . State v. Codi amat, 131 Hawai i 
220, 317 P.3d 664 (2013), the State’s charging Vaimili in 
the disjunctive did not render his charges defective under 
Codiamat; (2) Vaimili’s  trial counsel’s failure to raise 
the charging issue did not constitute ineffective 
assistance of counsel; and (3) the Circuit Court acted 
within its discretion, and did not violate Vaimili’s right 
to be present at trial, when it only proceeded with the 
trial after it became apparent that Vaimili was voluntarily absent, that he could not be located, and that it was 
unlikely he would soon return.  
With respect to the disjunctive charges, the ICA also stated  in 
Part I.D. of its discussion:  
We conclude that the charges against Vaimili gave him 
fair notice of the nature and cause of the accusation 
against him and what he needed to be prepared to meet. It 
is well- settled that where an offense statute establishes 
13
  
 
 
 
  
 
   
  
  
  
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
alternative means of committing an offense, the State is 
allowed to prove in the disjunctive, that is, prove the 
offense was committed by establishing any of the 
alternative means . 
If the State can prove alternative means in the 
disjunctive, then charging alternative means in the disjunctive serves to provide a defendant with fair notice. 
Put another way, disjunctive charging provides a defendant 
with fair notice because it accurately reflects what the 
defendant must be prepared to meet, and thus, satisfies due 
process. . . .     
In this case, the State’s disjunctive charging served 
to provide Vaimili with fair notice that the State could prove the charges against him through proof of alternative 
acts or states of mind.  . . .  We conclude that Vaimili  
has failed to show that his charges w
ere rendered fatally 
defective by the State’s charging in the disjunctive.

III. Standards of Review 
A. Sufficiency of Charges 
“[W]hether a complaint provides sufficient notice to a 
defendant is reviewed under the de novo, or right/wrong, 
standard.
” State v. Codiamat , 131 Hawai i 220, 223, 317 P.3d 
664, 667 (2013). 
B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel 
When reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance of 
counsel, [the appellate court] looks at whether defense 
counsel’s assistanc e was within the range of competence 
demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. The defendant has the burden of establishing ineffective assistance of counsel and must meet the following two -part test:  1) that 
there were specific errors or omissions reflecting counsel’s lack of skill, judgment, or diligence; and 2) 
that such errors or omissions resulted in either the 
withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially 
meritorious defense. To satisfy this second prong, the 
defendant needs to show a possible impairment, rather than 
a probable impairment, of a potentially meritorious 
defense. A defendant need not prove actual prejudice.  
State v. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai i 504, 513-14, 78 P.3d 317, 326-27 
(2003) (internal quotation marks, citations, and footnote

omitted). 
C. Defendant’s Constitutional Right to be Present 
“We answer questions of constitutional law by 
exercising our own independent constitutional judgment based on 
the facts of the case. Thus, we review questions of 
constitutional law under the right/wrong standard.” State v. 
Pratt, 127 Hawai i 206, 212, 277 P.3d 300, 306 (2012) (citations 
and internal quotation marks omitted). 
D. Interpretation of a Court Rule 
Principles of statutory construction apply to 
interpreting a rule promulgated by the courts. The 
interpretation of a court rule is thus a question of law 
reviewable de novo. See State v. Baron , 80 Hawai i 107, 113, 905 
P.2d 613, 619 (1995). 
IV. Discussion 
A. Disjunctive Charging Language 
In Codiamat , 131 Hawai i 220, 317 P.3d 664, this court 
recognized that “states of mind may be charged disjunctively,” 
and “acts may be charged disjunctively when the words used 
charge similar or analogous forms of conduct that are codified 
in a single subsection of a statute.” 1 31 Hawai i at 227, 317 
P.3d at 671 (citing State v. Batson, 73 Haw. 236, 248, 831 P.2d 
924, 931 (1992); State v. Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 279, 280, 567 P.2d 
15
  
 
 
 
  
 
   
 
   
   
 
  
    
 
         *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
1242, 1243 (1977); State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai i 48, 51, 276 P.3d 
617, 620 (2012)). Here, the ICA “concl ude[d] that the charges 
against Vaimili gave him fair notice of the nature and cause of 
the accusation against him and what he needed to be prepared to 
meet” because the State was permitted to “prove the charges 
against him through proof of alternative acts or states of mind.” 
Although initially, the ICA accurately quoted our 
holding in Codiamat , the ICA’s subsequent language in Part I.D. 
of its discussion, partially quoted in Part II.B., supra, is overly expansive and may suggest an extension of our holding in 
Codiamat. We therefore expressly reiterate that our conclusion is limited to the following: “when charging a defendant under a 
single subsection of a statute, the charge may be worded 
disjunctively in the language of the statute as long as the acts 
charged are reasonably related so that the charge provides 
sufficient notice to the defendant.” Codiamat, 131 Hawai i at 
227, 317 P.3d at 671 (footnote omitted). Here, Vaimili was 
charged by amended complaint. See supra Part II.A. A review of 
the actions alleged in each count reveals that the charges were worded disjunctively in the language of a single subsection of 
each respective statute. 
Nevertheless, Vaimili asserts that the charges for each 
count gave him insufficient notice of the specific acts with 
16
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
which he was charged.   In brief, for each count charged, he 
identifies four possible acts that could support a conviction of 
the charge, and states that the four acts were “distinct and 
separate acts that [he] had to p repare to defend.” For example, 
with respect to Count I, Vaimili asserts:  
[T]here were four distinct acts that could have supported 
Vaimili’s conviction: 1) intentionally restraining [the CW] 
with intent to terrorize her; 2) knowingly restraining [the 
CW] with intent to terrorize her; 3) intentionally 
restraining [the CW] with intent to terrorize an 
unspecified third person; or 4) knowingly restraining [the 
CW] with intent to terrorize an unspecified third person. 
Vaimili’s assertion is without merit. The State’s 
charging of multiple “distinct and separate” acts using 
disjunctive language is permissible as long as use of the 
disjunctive is confined to address “similar or analogous forms 
of conduct” contained in a single subsection of a statute; in 
this way, the alleged acts are reasonably related, and each of 
those separate acts can be ascertained. Codiamat, 131 Hawai i at 
227, 317 P.3d at 671.  
Here, determination of the content and number of 
disparate acts alleged is not an issue, as Vaimili readily 
identifies each of them. Further, Vaimili’s assertions that the 
disparate acts alleged by the State within each count are not 
reasonably related to provide Vaimili with requisite notice, are 
unpersuasive. Vaimili points only to the kidnapping charge in 
Count I to illustrate why he was not given sufficient notice. 
17
  
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
  
 
 
     
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
That is, Vaimili suggests that Count I did not provide him 
sufficient notice because the amended complaint did not allege 
the identity of the possible “third person.” Yet, the absence 
of the identity of the “third person” in the amended complaint, which could have been rectified by a motion for a bill of 
particulars, see HRS § 806-47 (1993), bears not on whether the 
State’s use of the disjunctive failed to give Vaimili adequate 
notice of the “nature and cause of the accusation,” Haw. Const. 
art. I, § 14; that is, whether “the acts charged are reasonably 
related.” 
Vaimili provides no other reasons to support a 
conclusion that the acts charged within each count are not 
reasonably related. The charges met due process requirements as 
they provided fair notice and were worded “‘in a manner such 
that the nature and cause of the accusation could be understood 
by a person of common understanding. ’”  Codiamat, 131 Hawai i at 
223, 317 P.3d at 667 (quoting State v. Sprattling , 99 Hawai i 
312, 318, 55 P.3d 276, 282 (2002)). 
As previously noted, each count of the charges against 
Vaimili was worded disjunctively in the language of a single 
subsection of a statute, alleging conduct that was reasonably 
related. We conclude the amended complaint provided sufficient 
notice to Vaimili and was not defective. See Codiamat, 131 
18
  
 
 
 
  
  
   
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Hawaii at 227, 317 P.3d at 671.  Further, as no potentially 
meritorious defense was implicated, trial counsel did not 
provide ineffective assistance for failing to object to the 
disjunctive charging language.  See Wakisaka , 102 Hawai i at 513-
14, 78 P.3d at 326-27. 
B. Trial in Absentia 
“[A] [d]efendant’ s right to be present at all stages 
of his [or her] trial is of fundamental importance and is 
derived from the confrontation clause of the Fifth Amendment to 
the United States Constitution and made applicable to the states 
by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. ” State 
v. Caraballo, 62 Haw. 309, 320, 615 P.2d 91, 99 (1980) (citing Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400 (1965)). Trial may continue, 
however, in certain circumstances when a defendant is 
voluntarily absent. 
Rule 43 of the Hawai i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(“HRPP”) codifies a defendant’s constitutional right to be 
present at trial, as well as exceptions to the defendant’s 
continued presence. See Caraballo, 62 Haw. at 320, 615 P.2d at 
99 (referring to the Hawai i Rules of Criminal Procedure 
(“HRCP”), the predecessor to the HRPP).  The Rule states in 
relevant part: 
(a) Presence required. The defendant shall be present at 
the arraignment, at the time of the plea, at evidentiary 
pretrial hearings, at every stage of the trial including 
19
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
the impaneling of the jury and the return of the verdict, 
and at the imposition of sentence, except as otherwise 
provided by this rule. 
(b) Continued presence not required. The further progress 
of a pretrial evidentiary hearing or of the trial to and including the return of the verdict shall not be prevented 
and the defendant shall be considered to have waived the 
right to be present whenever a defendant, initially 
present,
 (1) is voluntarily absent after the hearing or trial 
has commenced (whether or not the defendant has been informed by the court of the obligation to remain during 
the trial); or
 (2) engages in conduct which is such as to justify 
exclusion from the courtroom . 
HRPP Rule 43. 
By proceeding with trial despite his absence, Vaimili 
argues the trial court violated this court rule, and in so 
doing, violated his rights under the United States and Hawai i 
Constitutions. Specifically, Vaimili contends (1) the State 
failed to show his absence from trial was voluntary; (2) that 
trial does not “commence” until after the empaneled jury is 
administered its oath, and as such, Rule 43(b)’s exception to 
the defendant’s constitutional right to be present does not apply to his case as the selected jury had not been administered 
its oath prior to his absence from court; and (3) his absence 
through the trial was “not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” 
For the following reasons, Vaimili’s arguments are 
unpersuasive. 
1. Vaimili’s Absence Was Voluntary. 
Vaimili was present in court on June 21, 2010 when the 
jury was selected and the parties and jurors were instructed to 
20
  
 
 
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
return two days later. Vaimili, who was released on bail, 
failed to return when trial resumed on June 23, 2010.  Trial 
counsel could not explain Vaimili’s absence, representing that 
he had spoken with Vaimili on June 22 because they planned to 
later meet, but that Vaimili failed to show and thereafter did 
not return any of trial counsel’s phone calls. Afte r issuing a 
bench warrant and ordering the forfeiture of Vaimili’s bond, the 
circuit court continued the trial for five days. On June 28, 
2010, Vaimili’s whereabouts were still unknown —  trial counsel 
informed the circuit court that Vaimili still had not contacted him and that the bail bond company had not been able to locate 
Vaimili. The circuit court also noted that it received several 
phone calls from a bail bond company employee indicating she was 
seeking assistance from law enforcement authorities to  help 
locate and apprehend Vaimili.  
The court continued proceedings for another twenty-one 
days to July 19, 2010. On that date, Vaimili remained absent, 
and defense counsel argued that trial should not proceed without 
Vaimili as the State “ha[d] not me t its burden to show that 
[Vaimili] [wa]s voluntary[ily] absent.” Specifically, defense 
counsel suggested, “[f]or all we know, your Honor, [Vaimili] may 
have been hurt or . . . deceased.” Through the court’s colloquy 
with defense counsel, it was establis hed that defense counsel’s 
last successful contact with Vaimili was on June 22, which was 
21
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
     
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
the day after jury selection. Further, all of defense counsel’s 
subsequent attempts to contact Vaimili by phone at a number 
provided by Vaimili — including the most recent efforts one to 
two weeks before July 19 — were unsuccessful. Defense counsel 
also stated that the head of the company that posted bail for 
Vaimili informed him that she could not reach Vaimili at that 
same provided number, and that she was searching for Vaimili on 
the mainland. Thus, for almost a month, Vaimili had no contact 
with his attorney or bail bond person, the minimum two 
individuals he should have had contact with given that he was 
released on bail and was last informed that trial was to resume 
on June 23, 2010. Moreover, these events unfolded after (1) the 
court previously received testimony in April 2010 by the court 
clerk that Del Rio had informed her that Vaimili had forfeited 
bail and would need to be retrieved from San Francisco, and (2) 
Vaimili failed to appear on time for proceedings the morning of 
June 15, 2010. 
Based on the foregoing, we conclude the ICA, when 
conducting its de novo review, did not err in “conclud[ing] that 
there was sufficient evidence to show that Vaimili was 
voluntarily absent. ” The trial court had issued a bench warrant 
to secure Vaimili’s return, yet local authorities were unable to 
locate him. The trial court also provided a significant amount 
of time for Vaimili to reappear and contact his attorney or bail 
22
  
 
 
 
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
bond person, which he did not do. Moreover, the telephone 
number provided by Vaimili, when dialed, indicated that Vaimili 
“would not take any calls at that point in time,” see supra note 
7, which does not support defense counsel’s position that Vaimili may have been injured or deceased. As the ICA noted, 
“[a]lthough the . . . [c]ourt did not know the precise reason 
for Vaimili’s failure to appear, the record provides compelling 
evidence that Vaimili had absconded” and therefore was 
voluntarily absent. 
2.	 For the Purposes of HRPP Rule 43, Trial “Commences” 
before the Selected Jury Is Sworn. 
HRPP Rule 43 is the successor to HRCP Rule 43, which 
in turn was modeled on Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of Criminal 
Procedure (“FRCP”). See Caraballo, 62 Haw. at 322 n.12, 615 
P.2d at 99 n.12; Matias v. State, 73 Haw. 147, 149, 828 P.2d 
281, 283 (1992). HRPP Rule 43 states in relevant part: “The 
further progress . . . of the trial to and including the return 
of the verdict shall not be prevented and the defendant shall be 
considered to have waived the right to be present whenever a 
defendant, initially present, . . . is voluntarily absent after 
the . . . trial has commenced [.]” HRPP Rule 43(b)(1). This 
portion of HRPP Rule 43 is substantially similar to the version 
of FRCP Rule 43 after which HRCP Rule 43 was patterned. Compare 
HRPP Rule 43(b)(1), with FRCP 43(b)(1) (1975 and 1995 
23
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
         
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
amendments) (“The further progress of the trial . . . will not 
be prevented and the defendant will be considered to have waived 
the right to be present whenever a defendant, initially present 
at trial . . . is voluntarily absent after the trial has 
commenced.”). Since 1995, FRCP 43 has not changed 
substantively; only stylistic edits were made in 2002 to promote 
clarity and consistency. See FRCP 43(c)(1)(A) (“A defendant who 
was initially present at trial . . . waives the right to be 
present . . . when the defendant is voluntarily absent after the 
trial has begun . . . .”). See State v. Okumura, 58 Haw. 425, 
570 P.2d 848 (1977). 
As with the federal rule after which it was modeled, 
HRPP Rule 43 “refers not to the commencement of jeopardy but to 
the commencement of trial.” United States v. Miller, 463 F.2d 
600, 603 (1st Cir. 1972). Thus, although jeopardy attaches 
after an empaneled jury is sworn, see State v. Quitog, 85 Hawai i 
128, 141, 938 P.2d 559, 572 (1997), that does not mean an 
empaneled jury must be sworn before trial “commences” for the 
purposes of HRPP Rule 43. 
Rather, federal courts have consistently held that for 
purposes of FRCP Rule 43, trial “has begun” or “commenced” when jury selection begins, not when the selected jury is sworn in. 
See, e.g., Miller, 463 F.2d at 603 (“With regard to a 
defendant’s presence at trial, the trial commences ‘at least’ 
24
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
from the time that the work of impaneling jurors begins. ” 
(quoting Hopt v. Utah, 110 U.S. 574, 578 (1884)); United States 
v. Bradford, 237 F.3d 1306, 1309 (11th Cir. 2001) (citing United 
States v. Krout, 56 F.3d 643 (5th Cir. 1995); United States v. Camacho, 955 F.2d 950 (4th Cir. 1992); Government of the Virgin 
Islands v. George, 680 F.2d 13 (3d Cir. 1982); Miller, 463 F.2d 
600); United States v. Benabe, 654 F.3d 753 (7th Cir. 2011).  
Indeed, “[a] felony defendant has a right to be present at jury 
selection because the trial begins no later than voir dire.” 
Cuoco v. United States, 208 F.3d 27, 32 (2d Cir. 2000) (emphasis in original). These federal cases are persuasive given HRPP 
Rule 43’s origins in FRCP Rule 43. Moreover, the plain text of 
HRPP Rule 43 supports the conclusion that jury selection is not 
a proceeding separate from trial. See HRPP Rule 43(a) (“The 
defendant shall be present . . . at every stage of the trial 
including the impaneling of the jury . . . .”) (emphasis added); 
State v. Rauch, 94 Hawai i 315, 322, 13 P.3d 324, 331 (2000) 
(stating that statutory construction begins with “language 
contained in the statute itself”). 
As such, we agree with the foregoing line of federal 
cases interpreting FRCP Rule 43, and hold that for the purposes of HRPP Rule 43, trial “commences” when prospective jurors are 
administered an oath prior to voir dire, at any authorized 
location for court proceedings.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
3.	 The Okumura Balancing Test Applies to Voluntarily 
Absent Defendants Such as Vaimili. 
We further clarify that when a defendant has not 
expressly requested — and been granted — permission to leave an 
on-going trial,9 but is otherwise voluntarily absent, the trial 
court must still engage in the balancing test outlined in 
Okumura, 58 Haw. 425, 570 P.2d 848, before determining whether 
to proceed with the trial: “[T] he narrow discretion given to 
the trial judge to proceed with the trial should be exercised only when the public interest clearly outweighs that of the 
absent defendant.” (quoting United States v. Tortora, 464 F.2d 
1202, 1210 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. Santoro v. United States, 409 U.S. 1063 (1972)). Thus, a defendant’s right to 
confront his accusers is balanced against factors such as (1) 
“the time and expense caused by [a] defendant’s efforts to 
defeat the proceedings by his departure or flight,” Okumura, 58 
Haw. at 430, 570 P.2d at 852 (citation and quotation marks omitted); (2) “the likelihood that the trial could soon take 
place with the defendant present,” United States v. Benavides, 
9   Our ruling in Caraballo, 62 Haw. 309, 615 P.2d 91, is not 
disturbed. In that case, the defendant, through counsel, twice requested and 
was granted, permission to leave the trial while it continued to proceed. 
See  Caraballo, 62 Haw. at 321 n.11, 615 P.2d at 99 n.11. The first instance 
was prior to the empaneling  of the jury, and the second instance was during 
the testimony of a witness. See  Caraballo, 62 Haw. at 320 & nn.8, 9, 615 
P.2d at 98 nn.8, 9. In these circumstances, we held that the defendant’s requested, voluntary absence from trial, with no record that the defendant also requested that trial be continued until his ret urn, “operates as a 
waiver of his right to be present and the trial may continue as if he were present.” Caraballo, 62 Haw. at 323, 615 P.2d at 100.  
26
  
 
 
 
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
596 F.2d 137, 139 (5th Cir. 1979); (3) “the difficulty of 
rescheduling,” Tortora , 464 F.2d at 1210; (4) the “inconvenience 
to jurors,” Benavides, 596 F.2d at 140; and (5) harm to the 
State’s case, Okumura , 58 Haw. at 430, 570 P.2d at 852.     
Here, Vaimili was present at the start of trial, when 
a jury and alternate jurors were selected. Despite Vaimili’s 
absence when trial resumed on June 23, 2010 and was later 
continued to June 28, 2010, the court did not hastily proceed 
with trial, but instead continued proceedings again for an extra 
twenty-one days due to Vaimili’s disappearance. Cf. Benavides, 
596 F.2d at 140 (concluding the trial court abused its discretion when it proceeded with trial after providing only a 
one-day continuance for defense counsel to locate his clients).   
Yet, even with the extension of time, no indication was given as 
to when Vaimili would return. Vaimili did not contact anyone 
related to the case, his attorney and bail bond person could not 
reach him, and authorities could not locate Vaimili after a bench warrant issued. Thus any further delay to proceedings in 
order to await Vaimili’s return was foreseeably indefinite, as 
there was “no reasonable probability he could be located 
shortly.” United States v. Beltran-Nunez, 716 F.2d 287, 291 
(5th Cir. 1983). 
Based on these circumstances, the public interest 
clearly outweighed Vaimili’s interest. The purpose of HRPP 
27
  
 
 
 
  
 
   
 
     
   
   
  
     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
43(b)(1) is to prevent a defendant from “defeat[ing] the 
proceedings by voluntarily absenting  himself after the trial has 
been commenced in his presence.” FRCP 43 advisory committee’s 
note (1944 adoption). Vaimili’s disappearance for nearly a 
month stymied all reasonable efforts by the court to permit him 
to be present at the remainder of his trial.  The delay caused 
by Vaimili’s absence and lack of contact had already requir ed 
the replacement of one juror, with an indefinite delay 
potentially requiring the dismissal of additional jurors, 
thereby wasting the time and expense already spent for tri  al.     
Accordingly, the circuit court did not violate 
Vaimili’s right to be present at trial. The ICA did not err in 
concluding that the circuit court appropriately exercised its 
discretion in proceeding with the trial without Vaimili.  
V.
