CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS  
(CAAP-
12-0000124; CASE NO. 1P1120000029) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Michael Deming (Deming) 
was convicted for entering or remaining in a public park during 
posted closure hours in violation of Revised Ordinances of 
Honolulu (ROH) § 10-1.2(a)(12) (1990).1 The Intermediate Court 
1 ROH § 10- 1.2(a)(12) provides: 
Sec. 10-1.2 Park rules and regulations.

2    We raise this issue sua sponte because of the paramount 
importance of a defendant’s right to counsel.  See  State v. Pitts, 131 Hawaiʻ i 
 537, 541, 319 P.3d 456, 460 (2014) (raising the issue of the right to counsel for post- verdict motions sua sponte on certiorari “because the right to 
counsel is an essential component of a fair trial” (citation omitted) 
(internal quotation marks omitted));  cf. State v. Staley ,  91 Hawai ʻi 275, 286, 
 982 P.2d 904, 915 (1999) (“Although not raised by [the defendant] on appeal, 
our review of the record establishes that [the defendant’s] right to testify, 
as set forth in Tachibana v. State, 79 Hawai ʻi 226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995), was 
violated.”); State v. Hirayasu, 71 Haw. 587, 589 -90, 801 P.2d 25, 26 (1990) 
(raising issue of sufficiency of evidence sua sponte on appeal and noting 
“the power to sua sponte notice plain errors or defects affecting substantial 
rights clearly resides in this court” (citation omitted) (int ernal quotation 
marks omitted)).

of Appeals (ICA) affirmed Deming’s conviction. Although not 
raised on appeal, our review of the record establishes that 
Deming’s waiver of his right  to counsel was not knowingly and 
intelligently made, and accordingly, Deming’s conviction must be 
2 vacated and the case remanded for a new trial.   
During arraignment and plea before the 
District Court 
of the First Circuit (district court), Deming was informed of 
(. . . continued) 
(a)	 Within the limits of any public park, it is 
unlawful for any person to: 
. . . . 
(12) 	Enter or remain in any public park during the night hours that the park is closed, 
provided that signs are posted indicating 
the hours that the park is closed, except 
that a person may traverse a public beach 
park using the most direct route during park closure hours for the purpose of 
reaching the shoreline[.] 
ROH § 10- 1.1 (1990) provides in relevant part: “‘Public park’ 
means any park, park roadway, playground, athletic field, beach, beach right -
of-way, tennis court, golf course, swimming pool, or other recreation area or 
facility under the control, maintenance and management of the department of 
parks and recreation.” 
We do not address the issues raised in Deming’s application for 
certiorari as the record does not support his allegations of error.

the charge against him, and the court recommended that he 
consult with the public defender’s office. Deming apparently 
consulted with the public defender’s office, and after doing so, 
informed the court that he “waive[d]” the “involvement” of t he 
“public [d]efender.” The district court recommended that Deming obtain counsel and set a trial date.  
Deming appeared for trial
3 on February 23, 2012, 
without counsel. The court asked Deming if he would be interested in a plea agreement, and the State noted for the 
record that “the offer would be Simple Trespass with a fine of 
$25.” Deming elected to proceed to trial, and the State re-
arraigned him. Deming indicated that he understood the charge and plead not guilty. The record does not reflect that the 
court engaged Deming in a colloquy regarding his decision to 
proceed without counsel.

The right to counsel for an individual accused of a 
crime is guaranteed under both the Hawai ʻi Constitution and the 
United States Constitution. State v. Phua, 135 Hawai i 504, 512, 
353 P.3d 1046, 1054 (2015). A defendant also has the right to 
proceed pro se, but when he or she chooses to do so, “the record 
3 The Honorable Dean E. Ochiai presided. 
4 Twice during the trial, the district court referenced Deming’s 
waiver of his right to counsel and Deming acknowledged that he had been 
offered an attorney but elected to proceed pro se. However, the court did 
not engage in a sufficient waiver inquiry, as discussed herein.

must indicate that the defendant was offered counsel, but he or 
she ‘voluntarily, knowingly, and int elligently rejected the 
offer and waived that right.’” Id. 
(quoting State v. Dickson , 4 
Haw. App. 614, 619, 673 P.2d 1036, 1041 (1983)). In such 
situations the trial court must ensure that: 1) “the waiver of 
counsel is knowingly and intelligently made”; 
and 2) “the record 
is complete so as to reflect that waiver.” Id. 
(citation 
omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). “The latter 
requirement arises because appellate courts are charged with 
determining from the record whether there was an unequivocal 
waiver, which was voluntarily and freely made.” Id.   
In State v. Phua , we held that the defendant’s waiver 
of his right to counsel during the sentencing stage of his case 
was invalid, because the “record . . . [was] critically 
deficient to support a f inding that Phua’s waiver of his right 
to counsel was intelligently and knowingly made.” Id. at 517, 
353 P.3d at 1059. 
We explained that —pursuant to the ICA’s 
opinion in State v. Dickson —the trial court should focus its 
waiver inquiry on three principle factors: “(1) the particular 
facts and circumstances relating to the defendant that indicate 
the defendant’s level of comprehension; (2) the defendant’s 
awareness of the risks of self-representation; and (3) the 
defendant’s awareness of the disadvantages o f self-
representation.” Phua, 135 Hawai i at 512, 353 P.3d at 1054.

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
In the instant case, the record does not establish 
that Deming knowingly and intelligently waived his right to 
counsel. While the district court in passing addressed some of 
the issues discussed in Phua that are relevant to a waiver 
inquiry, it did not do so in connection with a formal colloquy 
prior to Deming waiving his right to counsel. To the contrary, 
on the day of trial, the district court failed to conduct an 
inquiry regarding Deming’s waiver of his right to counsel, and 
instead accepted that Deming was proceeding pro se as a foregone 
conclusion. Because the “record does not support a finding that 
[Deming’s] waiver of counsel was knowingly and intelligently 
made,” id. at 506, 353 P.3d at 1048, we vacate the conviction 
and remand the case to the district court for a new trial. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the the ICA’s April 2, 2015 
Judgment on Appeal and the district court’s March 1 2, 2012 
Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order are vacated, and this case is remanded to the district court for a new trial.
