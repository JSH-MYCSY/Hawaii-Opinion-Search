RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, POLLACK, AND WILSON, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J.
 
This case requires us to determine what information
 
must appear on the face of an “anticipatory” search warrant,
 
i.e., a warrant that cannot be executed until some expected
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
future event occurs. This case arose when a FedEx employee 
discovered marijuana in a package addressed to a residence on Kaua'i. The Kaua' i Police Department (KPD) was contacted and 
decided to conduct a controlled delivery of the package to the address listed. They applied for a warrant to allow them to search the premises upon completion of the delivery. However, rather than listing this triggering condition, the warrant issued by the district court instead authorized the KPD to conduct the search “forthwith.” 
The KPD completed the controlled delivery, and
 
Petitioners Jason Curtis and Melissa Hall were charged with drug
 offenses based on evidence seized in the subsequent search. 
Petitioners moved to suppress that evidence, arguing that the
 anticipatory search warrant was invalid because it failed to list
 the triggering condition. The circuit court denied Petitioners’
 motion, and the Intermediate Court of Appeal (ICA) affirmed. 
We are faced with a question of first impression for 
this court: Does the Hawai' i Constitution require that an 
anticipatory search warrant identify the triggering condition on the face of the warrant? In light of the privacy protections contained in article I, section 7 of the Hawai' i Constitution, we 
hold that an anticipatory search warrant must, on its face, identify the triggering condition to be valid. We therefore 
2
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
vacate the ICA’s February 23, 2016 Judgment on Appeal and the
 
circuit court’s denial of Petitioners’ motion to suppress
 evidence seized pursuant to the unlawful search warrant, and
 remand the case to the circuit court for proceedings consistent
 with this Opinion. 
I. Background
 
A. Anticipatory Search Warrant 
On December 1, 2010, a FedEx employee at the Honolulu 
FedEx sorting facility opened a parcel that he suspected contained illegal narcotics. The parcel was addressed to “Jennifer ROBERTSON” at a Kaua' i residential address (Subject 
Premises). After discovering plastic bags in the parcel that appeared to contain marijuana, the FedEx employee notified a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) officer. The parcel and its contents were subsequently turned over to the KPD. After testing and weighing the suspected marijuana, the KPD determined that the parcel contained approximately eight pounds of marijuana. 
KPD Officer Paris Resinto applied for and obtained a
 
court order authorizing KPD officers to install in the parcel a
 tracking device that would permit the KPD to track the location
 of the parcel and determine when the parcel was opened. In
 conjunction with obtaining the order for the tracking device,
 Officer Resinto applied for an anticipatory search warrant to
 
3
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
search the Subject Premises for the parcel and its contents,
 
including the tracking device. 
Officer Resinto’s affidavit in support of the
 
anticipatory search warrant explained that (1) the KPD planned to
 effect a controlled delivery of the parcel under police
 surveillance to the Subject Premises to “identify the person(s)
 involved in this illegal drug shipment”; (2) the KPD would
 install the tracking device in the parcel; and (3) after the
 tracking device was installed, Officer Resinto and KPD Sergeant
 Darren Rose would maintain custody of the parcel until it was
 delivered to the Subject Premises. The affidavit also
 incorporated three documents by reference: a description of
 Officer Resinto’s training and experience, the affidavit
 supporting the application for the tracking device, and the order
 granting the application. 
The affidavit stated that Officer Resinto “has
 
reasonable grounds to believe that the property described herein
 will be located in the [Subject Premises] after the time of
 delivery of the suspect parcel and request that a search warrant
 issue commanding that a search be made of said residence for said
 property[.]” The affidavit also requested the issuance of a
 search warrant to search the Subject Premises “within forty-eight
 (48) hours after the time of delivery of the subject parcel[.]” 
4
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
1
On December 2, 2010, the district court  issued an
“Anticipatory Search Warrant” based on Officer Resinto’s
 
affidavit, authorizing KPD officers to search the Subject
 Premises for the parcel and its contents. 
The search warrant did
 
not set forth the triggering condition for the execution of
 warrant, and it did not mention the controlled delivery of the
 parcel described in Officer Resinto’s affidavit. Rather, the
 search warrant stated:
 
Affidavit(s) having been made before me that the
property described herein may be found at the location
set forth herein and that it falls within the grounds
specified by said affidavit(s).  And I am satisfied
 that there is probable cause to believe that the
property described herein is located within the
property to be searched and that the foregoing grounds
for application for issuance of a search warrant
exist:
 
YOU ARE HEREBY COMMANDED forthwith to search:
 
[The Subject Premises]
 
(Emphases added.) 
It also described the property to be searched and
 
stated that “[t]he search shall take place within 10 days of this
 
date.” 
That same day, the KPD conducted a controlled delivery
 
of the parcel to the Subject Premises. Sergeant Rose approached
 the Subject Premises and handed the parcel to Curtis, who carried
 it inside the Subject Premises. Sergeant Rose also saw Hall and
 
1
 The Honorable Trudy K. Senda presided. 
5
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
co-defendant Genevieve Walker. Officer Rose asked Walker if she
 
was “Jennifer Robertson,” the named addressee of the parcel. 
Walker said yes and signed the FedEx delivery form. Sergeant
 Rose left the Subject Premises and notified other KPD officers
 participating in the investigation that the parcel had been
 delivered. 
About five minutes after the parcel had been delivered,
 
the tracking device alerted the KPD officers that the parcel had
 been opened. In response, the KPD officers went to the Subject
 Premises and executed the search warrant. 
In executing the warrant, the officers observed Curtis,
 
Hall, and Walker and found the contents of the opened parcel,
 including the marijuana, in various parts of the Subject
 Premises. The officers recovered one of the bags of marijuana
 from the parcel. The officers also recovered drug paraphernalia
 and over $1,000 in cash. 
B. Circuit Court Proceedings 
On January 19, 2011, Curtis, Hall, and Walker were 
charged with: (1) second-degree commercial promotion of 
marijuana in violation of Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 712­
2
1249.5(1)(a) and/or (b),  (2) unlawful use of drug paraphernalia

 HRS § 712-1249.5(1) (1989) provides in relevant part:

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

in violation of HRS § 329-43.5(a),  and (3) second-degree
promotion of a detrimental drug in violation of HRS § 712­1248(1)(c).
4
 
On February 17, 2011, Walker filed a “Motion to Quash
 
Search Warrant and Suppress Illegally Obtained Evidence and
 Statements” (Suppression Motion), challenging the validity of the
 warrant. Walker argued that the search warrant was invalid under
 
2(...continued)
(1) A person commits the offense of commercial
promotion of marijuana in the second degree if the
person knowingly:
(a) Possesses marijuana having an aggregate
weight of two pounds or more;
(b) Distributes marijuana having an aggregate
weight of one pound or more[.]
 
3 HRS § 329-43.5(a) (1988) provides:
 
(a) It is unlawful for any person to use, or to
possess with intent to use, drug paraphernalia to
plant, propagate, cultivate, grow, harvest,
manufacture, compound, convert, produce, process,
prepare, test, analyze, pack, repack, store, contain,
conceal, inject, ingest, inhale, or otherwise
introduce into the human body a controlled substance
in violation of this chapter.  Any person who violates
this section is guilty of a class C felony and upon
conviction may be imprisoned pursuant to section
706-660 and, if appropriate as provided in section
706-641, fined pursuant to section 706-640.
 
4
 HRS § 712-1248(1) (1989) provides in relevant part:
 
(1) A person commits the offense of promoting a
detrimental drug in the second degree if the person
knowingly:
. . . .
 (c) Possesses one or more preparations, compounds,
mixtures, or substances, of an aggregate weight of one
ounce or more, containing any marijuana[.]
 
7
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
5
article I, section 7 of the Hawai' i Constitution  and under HRS §
6
803-31 because it did not contain a description of the
triggering condition on its face. 
In support of her argument, Walker cited a depublished
ICA case, State v. Scott (Scott I), that set forth six
 
requirements for an anticipatory search warrant, including that
 the warrant “authorizes a search only upon the occurrence of the
event generating the probable cause”; “authorizes a search only
 within the probable life of the probable cause”; and is “executedbefore the probable cause in fact expires.” 
87 Hawai' i 80, 80­
81, 951 P.2d 1243, 1243-44 (1998).7 Walker argued that the
  
 

 
5 Article I, section 7 of the Hawai 'i Constitution provides: 
Searches, Seizures, and Invasion of Privacy. 
The right of the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers and effects against unreasonable
searches, seizures and invasions of privacy shall not
be violated; and no warrants shall issue but upon
probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and
particularly describing the place to be searched and
the persons or things to be seized or the
communications sought to be intercepted.
 
6 HRS § 803-31 (1998) provides:
 
A search w
arrant is an order in writing made by a
judge or other magistrate, directed to an officer of
justice, commanding the officer to search for certain
articles supposed to be in the possession of or which
are anticipated to be in the possession of one who is
charged with having obtained them illegally, or who
keeps them illegally, or with the intent of using them
as the means of committing a certain offense.

 As a depublished case, Scott I  has no precedential value and 
cannot be cited.  The citations refer to the related Hawai 'i Supreme Court 
case (Scott II) that depublished Scott I . 
8
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
warrant in this case did not meet these three requirements and
 
was therefore invalid. Curtis and Hall joined in Walker’s
 Suppression Motion. 
The State opposed the motion, arguing that the warrant 
met the requirements set forth by the United States Supreme Court in United States v. Grubbs, 547 U.S. 90 (2006). The State also argued that the motion advocated a “hyper-technical warrant reading,” even though “it is well-settled that a search warrant and its support[] should be evaluated in totality, and examined with common sense,” citing State v. Sherlock, 70 Hawai' i 271, 
274, 768 P.2d 1290, 1293 (1989). The circuit court denied the motion based on Grubbs, but also noted that the anticipatory search warrant was “a very, very sloppy and apparently hastily put together warrant.” 
On October 10, 2011, the circuit court issued “Findings
 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying [the Suppression
 Motion].” The circuit court made the following relevant
 Conclusions of Law:
 
. . . .
 
3. The State of Hawaii has the authority to provide
constitutional protections to citizens above and
beyond that provided by the U.S. Constitution and theU.S. Supreme Court, and has done so when the Hawai 'i 
Supreme Court has deemed necessary. 
 State v. Kaluna,
55 Haw. 361, 367–69, 520 P.2d 51, 57–58 (1974). '
4. The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has, however, not
expanded on the constitutional protections provided bythe U.S. Constitution and U.S. Supreme Court with 
9
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
respect to anticipatory search warrants.
 
5. In accordance with controlling case law,
anticipatory search warrants need not contain future
tense anticipatory or triggering language where the
accompanying supporting affidavit adequately
demonstrates the anticipatory nature and intent of the
warrant itself.  U.S. v. Grubbs, 547 U.S. 90, 126
S.Ct. 1494 (2006).
 
. . .
 .
 
7. This Court is bound to “pay great deference” to
the probable cause determination made by the issuingjudge, and is to employ “a common sense and realistic,and not a hypertechnical reading of affidavits inconnection with the determination of probable cause.” State v. Navas, 81 Hawai 'i 29, 35 (Hawai 'i App., 1995). 
. . . .
 
9. Read in totality, the Anticipatory Search Warrant
at issue is in accordance with HRS Section 803–31 (as
amended effective April 29, 1998), and is not
constitutionally invalidated by present tense language
that appears on page one of the warrant.  HRS Section
 803–31[;] U.S. v. Grubbs, 547 U.S. 90, 126 S.Ct. 1494
(2006).
 
On February 6, 2012, Curtis and Hall entered
 
conditional no contest pleas to the amended charge of
 
first-degree promoting a detrimental drug, reserving the right to
 appeal the circuit court’s order denying the Suppression Motion
 and its subsequent order denying a motion to reconsider. On
 February 8, 2012, Curtis and Hall were each sentenced to pay a
 $5,000 fine and a $105 crime victim compensation fee.
8
  
C. ICA Proceedings 
Curtis and Hall appealed to the ICA, arguing that the
 
8
 Pursuant to a plea agreement, the charges against Walker were
 
dismissed without prejudice.  Walker was not a party to the ICA appeal.
 
10
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
circuit court erred in denying their motion to suppress. 
The ICA held that the anticipatory search warrant was 
valid. State v. Curtis, 137 Hawai' i 43, 52, 364 P.3d 941, 950 
(2015). First, the ICA determined that Hawai' i law is similar 
enough to federal law to warrant applying Grubbs. The ICA noted 
that both the Hawai' i Constitution and U.S. Constitution “only 
require that the warrant particularly describe the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized; they do not require that search warrants additionally ‘include a specification of the precise manner in which they are to be executed.’” Id. at 49, 364 P.3d at 947. Additionally, the ICA 
asserted that both Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCP) Rule 41 and Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 41 “do 
not require that a copy of the search warrant be presented to the property owner or others before the warrant is executed.” Id. at 
50, 364 P.3d at 948. Given these similarities, the ICA concluded that Grubbs applied, and accordingly, anticipatory search warrants do not require triggering conditions to be valid. 
The ICA then declined to follow its conclusion in Scott
 
I “that an anticipatory search warrant must itself state the
 triggering condition to be valid.” Id. at 51, 364 P.3d at 949. 
The ICA based its reasoning on Scott I’s lack of precedential
 value, and the fact that Grubbs was issued after Scott I had been
 
11
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
overruled by Scott II. Further, the ICA noted that the
 
subsequent amendments to HRS § 803-31 “did not impose any
 specific conditions for a valid anticipatory search warrant.” 
Id. at 51, 364 P.3d at 949. 
Second, the ICA adopted the following test that had
 
been employed by other jurisdictions: 
Although the triggering condition need not be stated
in the warrant itself . . . the following two
conditions must be satisfied for an anticipatory
search warrant that does not state the triggering
condition to be valid:  (1) the officer’s affidavit
must specifically identify the triggering condition
for the execution of the warrant; and (2) this
triggering condition must be satisfied before the
warrant is executed.
 
Id. at 50, 364 P.3d at 948.
 
The ICA argued that if these conditions are met, “any
 
risk that an anticipatory search warrant would be executed
 
prematurely if the warrant fails to identify the triggering
 condition is exceedingly low.” Id. at 49, 364 P.3d at 947. 
The ICA then concluded that these conditions were
 
satisfied in this case. As to the first condition, the ICA found
 that the “affidavit in support of the search warrant specifically
 identified the triggering condition for the execution of the
 warrant––the delivery of the parcel to the Subject Premises.” 
Id. As to the second condition, the ICA found that “KPD waited
 
until the parcel had been delivered to the Subject Premises (and
 the tracking device indicated the parcel had been opened) before
 
12
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
executing the warrant.” Id. at 50, 364 P.3d at 949. The ICA
 
further contended that there was “no plausible risk” of premature
 
execution because law enforcement “would not be disposed to
 undermine the success of their efforts by premature execution of
 the warrant.” Id. (quoting Alvidres v. Superior Court, 90 Cal.
 
Rptr. 682, 686 (Cal. App. 1970)).
 
The ICA thus concluded that the anticipatory search 
warrant was valid, and stated that its holding was in line with the purposes underlying Hawaii’s exclusionary rule and the primary purpose of the Hawai' i Constitution, “to safeguard the 
privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by government officials.” Id. at 51-52, 364 P.3d at 949-50. 
Accordingly, the ICA affirmed the circuit court’s denial of the Suppression Motion. 
Petitioners timely sought certiorari review, presenting
 
the following three questions:
 
A. Does article I, section 7 of the Hawai 'i 
Constitution afford greater protections for
anticipatory search warrants than the 4th Amendment ofthe U.S. Constitution? 
B. Did the ICA gravely err in holding the right to
privacy in the Hawai 'i Constitution does not require
the triggering event to be included in an anticipatory
search warrant? 
C. Did the ICA gravely err in giving effect to a
search warrant that was based on an objectively false
finding by the issuing court that the alleged
contraband was, at the time of the issuance, located
on the subject premises? 
13
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
II. Standard of Review
 
A. Constitutional Law 
This court reviews questions of constitutional law de 
novo under the “right/wrong” standard and thus exercises its “own 
independent judgment based on the facts of the case.” State v. 
Jenkins, 93 Hawai' i 87, 100, 997 P.2d 13, 26 (2000) (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted). 
III. Discussion
 
This case presents a question of first impression in 
this court: Does the Hawai' i Constitution require that an 
anticipatory search warrant identify the triggering condition? We hold that it does. 
A. Background on Anticipatory Search Warrants 
1. The Scott Decisions
 
An anticipatory search warrant is “a warrant based upon
 
an affidavit showing probable cause that at some future time (but
 
not presently) certain evidence of crime will be located at a
 specified place.” Grubbs, 547 U.S. at 94. Anticipatory warrants
 
generally seek authority to search after the occurrence of a
 future event, referred to as the “triggering condition,” which is
 often the delivery of a package containing contraband to the
 premises to be searched. See id. “By definition, it is issued
 
before the necessary events have occurred which will allow a
 
14
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
constitutional search of the premises; if those events do not 
transpire, the warrant is void.” Scott II, 87 Hawai' i at 80 n.1, 
951 P.2d at 1243 n.1 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
In Scott, an undercover police officer delivered a 
parcel known to contain drugs to the defendant, and shortly after the delivery, the defendant was arrested pursuant to an anticipatory search warrant. Scott II, 87 Hawai' i at 81, 951 
P.2d at 1244. The triggering condition was not stated on the face of the warrant. Id. at 83, 951 P.2d at 1246. The defendant 
moved to quash the search warrant and suppress the evidence, and the circuit court granted the motion. Id. at 82, 951 P.2d at 
1245. 
On appeal, the ICA concluded that an anticipatory
 
search warrant was constitutionally permissible if the warrant:
 
(1) is issued by an authorized judge based on probable
cause supported by oath or affirmation; (2) is based
on a clear showing, supported by oath or affirmation,
of law enforcement’s need to have the [anticipatory
search warrant] issued before the occurrence of the
event that will generate the probable cause; (3)
particularly describes the place to be searched and
the things to be seized; (4) authorizes a search only
upon the occurrence of the event generating the
probable cause; (5) authorizes a search only within
the probable life of the probable cause; and (6) is
executed before the probable cause in fact expires.
 
Id. at 83, 951 P.2d at 1246. 
The ICA invalidated the warrant because it failed to
 
satisfy requirements (1), (4), and (5). Id. It determined that
 
15
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the warrant failed requirement (4) because “[n]otwithstanding
 
[the officer’s] averments in the affidavit that the search would
 not be conducted until after delivery of the Federal Express
 parcel, the Warrant failed to condition its execution upon actual
 delivery of the parcel.” Id. 
In Scott II, this court, without addressing the
 
constitutionality of anticipatory search warrants, held that such
 warrants were not permitted under the then-existing HRS § 803-31
 
9 1 0
 (1993) and HRPP Rule 41(a) (1995) .  Id. at 81, 951 P.2d at
 
1244. 
This court reasoned that HRS § 803-31 authorized searches
 
of articles “supposed to be in the possession of the person whose
 premises are to be searched.” Id. at 84, 951 P.2d at 1247
 
(emphasis in original). We further reasoned that HRPP Rule 41
 only authorized a judge to issue a search warrant “within the
 
9 HRS § 803-31 (1993) provided: 
Search warrant; defined.  A search warrant is an order
 
in writing made by a judge or other magistrate,
directed to an officer of justice, commanding the
officer to search for certain articles supposed to be
in the possession of one who is charged with having
obtained them illegally, or who keeps them illegally,
or with the intent of using them as the means of
committing a certain offense.
 
10
 HRPP Rule 41(a) (1995) provided:
 
Authority to Issue Warrant.  A search warrant
 
authorized by this rule may be issued by any district
or circuit judge within the circuit wherein the
property sought is located.  Application therefor
should be made to a district judge wherever
practicable.  
16
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
circuit wherein the property sought is located .”  Id. (quoting
HRPP Rule 41(a)) (emphasis in original).  This court thus ordered
Scott I depublished without addressing the ICA’s six factors. 
Id. at 85, 951 P.2d at 1248.
In response to Scott II,  the legislature amended HRS
§ 803-31 to authorize the issuance of anticipatory search
warrants.  1998 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 65, § 1 at 145.  The
amendment added the following phrase: 
A search warrant is an order in writing made by a
judge or other magistrate, directed to an officer of
justice, commanding the officer to search for certain
articles supposed to be in the possession of or which
are anticipated to be in the possession of one who is
charged with having obtained them illegally, or who
keeps them illegally, or with the intent of using them
as the means of committing a certain offense.
Id. (emphasis added).11  
2.United States v. Grubbs  
Eight years after this court’s decision in Scott II,
the United States Supreme Court considered the permissibility of
anticipatory search warrants in Grubbs.  In Grubbs, the defendant
purchased a videotape containing child pornography from a website
HRPP Rule 41(a) was amended in 1999 to state: 11
(a)  Authority to issue warrant. Except as otherwise
provided by statute, a search warrant may be issued by
any district or circuit judge (1) within the circuit
wherein the property sought is located; or (2) within
the circuit where the property is anticipated to be
located.  Application therefor should be made to a
district judge wherever practicable.
(Emphasis added.)
17 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
operated by an undercover postal inspector. 547 U.S. at 92. The
 
Postal Service arranged a delivery to Grubbs, and the police
 obtained an anticipatory search warrant that did not specify the
 triggering condition. Id. Around thirty minutes into the
 
search, Grubbs was given a copy of the warrant, which did not
 include the supporting affidavit that explained when the warrant
 would be executed. Id. at 93. The search of Grubbs’ residence
 
led to the seizure of a number of items, including the videotape. 
Id. Grubbs moved to suppress the evidence, arguing that the
 
warrant was invalid because it failed to name the triggering
 event. Id. The District Court denied the motion. Id.
 
On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that
 
“the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment[12] applies
 
with full force to the condition precedent to an anticipatory
 search warrant.” United States v. Grubbs, 377 F.3d 1072, 1077
 
(9th Cir.) amended on denial of reh’g, 389 F.3d 1306 (9th Cir.
 2004), rev’d, 547 U.S. 90 (2006). “The rationale for this rule
 is simple: ‘a warrant conditioned on a future event presents a
 
12
 The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides:
 
The right of the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable
searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no
warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,
supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly
describing the place to be searched, and the persons
or things to be seized.
 
18
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
potential for abuse above and beyond that which exists in more
 
traditional settings: inevitably, the executing agents are
 called upon to determine when and where the triggering event
 specified in the warrant has actually occurred.’” Id. at 1078
 
(quoting Hotal, 143 F.3d at 1226). It therefore concluded: 
Anticipatory search warrants are invalid absent
“clear, explicit, and narrow” triggering conditions. 
See Hotal, 143 F.3d at 1226.  Those triggering
conditions may be listed either in the warrant itself
or in attached documents, but whatever document
contains them must be presented to the person whose
property is being searched.  Absent such presentation,
individuals would “stand [no] real chance of policing
the officers’ conduct,” because they would have no
opportunity to check whether the triggering events by
which the impartial magistrate has limited the
officers’ discretion have actually occurred.
 
Grubbs, 377 F.3d at 1079. 
In short, the failure to include the triggering
 
conditions in the warrant or attach the affidavit to the warrant
 
was a fatal error that required that all evidence obtained during
 that search be suppressed. Id. at 1079. Because the postal
 
inspectors “failed to present the affidavit––the only document in
 which the triggering conditions were listed––to Grubbs or [his
 wife],” the warrant was “inoperative, and the search was
 illegal.” Id.
 
The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit’s
 
judgment, holding that anticipatory search warrants are not per
 se unconstitutional and that they do not require triggering
 conditions to be included in the warrant itself. 547 U.S. at 94,
 
19
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
97. 
First, the Court held that anticipatory search warrants
 
are not categorically unconstitutional under the Fourth
 
Amendment, noting that “every Court of Appeals to confront the
 issue” has held the same. Id. at 95. The Court explained that
 
ordinary warrants are “in a sense, ‘anticipatory’” because “the
 magistrate’s determination that there is probable cause for the
 search amounts to a prediction that the item will still be there
 when the warrant is executed.” Id. With anticipatory warrants,
 
“the fact that the contraband is not presently located at the
 place described in the warrant is immaterial, so long as there is
 probable cause to believe that it will be there when the search
 warrant is executed.” Id. at 96. 
The Court reasoned that anticipatory warrants are
 
therefore “no different in principle from ordinary warrants”
 because they both require a magistrate judge “to determine (1)
 that it is now probable that (2) contraband, evidence of a crime,
 or a fugitive will be on the described premises (3) when the
 warrant is executed.” Id. (emphases in original).
 
The Court then held that the Fourth Amendment “does not
 
require that the triggering condition for an anticipatory search
 warrant be set forth in the warrant itself.” Id. at 99. In
 
response to the Ninth Circuit’s conclusion regarding the Fourth
 
20
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Amendment particularity requirement, the Court responded that the
 
Fourth Amendment “specifies only two matters that must be
 ‘particularly describe[ed]’ in the warrant: ‘the place to be
 searched’ and ‘the persons or things to be seized.’” Id. at
 
97-98. 
The Court also rejected Grubbs’ two policy arguments. 
First, Grubbs argued that it is necessary to include the
 triggering condition in the warrant “to delineate the limits of
 the executing officer’s power” because “if there is a
 precondition to the valid exercise of executive power, that
 precondition must be particularly identified on the face of the
 warrant.” Id. at 98 (brackets omitted). The Court responded
 
that “[t]he Fourth Amendment does not require that the warrant
 set forth the magistrate’s basis for finding probable cause, even
 though probable cause is the quintessential ‘precondition to the
 valid exercise of executive power.’” Id. Similarly, the court
 
stated that the Fourth Amendment does not require the warrant to
 describe a triggering condition. Id. 
Second, Grubbs argued that the triggering condition
 
needed to be in the warrant to “assur[e] the individual whose
 property is searched or seized of the lawful authority of the
 executing officer, his need to search, and the limits of his
 power to search.” Id. The Court responded that neither the
 
21
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Fourth Amendment nor FRCP Rule 41 requires the executing officer
 
to present a copy of the warrant to the property owner before
 conducting the search. Id. at 99. The Court held that the
 
Constitution does not give property owners “license to engage the
 police in debate over the basis for the warrant,” but protects
 them by requiring that an impartial judicial officer issue the
 warrant and by providing “a right to suppress evidence improperly
 obtained and a cause of action for damages.” Id.
 
Hence, because the Fourth Amendment does not require
 
the triggering condition to be set forth in the warrant itself,
 the Court held that the Ninth Circuit erred in invalidating the
 warrant at issue. Id. 
Justice Souter, joined by Justices Stevens and
 
Ginsburg, concurred in part and concurred in the judgment. Id.
 
Justice Souter agreed that anticipatory search warrants are
 constitutional and that the Ninth Circuit erred in invalidating
 the warrant, but wrote separately to “qualify some points” made
 by the Majority. Id. at 99-100. He agreed with the Majority’s
 
argument regarding the particularity requirement, but noted that
 a warrant that does not specify a triggering condition can lead
 to “several untoward consequences with constitutional
 significance.” Id. at 100. First, “a warrant that fails to tell
 
the truth about what a magistrate authorized cannot inform the
 
22
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
police officer’s responsibility to respect the limits of
 
authorization,” a danger with real significance if the warrant is
 not executed by the same official who applied for it. Id. 
Second, Justice Souter stated that an incomplete
 
anticipatory warrant does not address an owner’s interest in “an
 accurate statement of the government’s authority to search
 property.” Id. at 101. He noted that the right to inspect a
 
warrant prior to a search has not yet been determined. Id. 
However, “if a later case holds that the homeowner has a right to
 inspect the warrant on request, a statement of the condition of
 authorization would give the owner a right to correct any
 misapprehension on the police’s part that the condition had been
 met when in fact it had not been.” Id. 
B.	 Anticipatory Search Warrants Are Not Categorically
Unconstitutional
 
As discussed above, Grubbs held that anticipatory 
search warrants are constitutional under the Fourth Amendment, 
noting that “every Court of Appeals to confront the issue” has held the same. 547 U.S. at 95. Further, the Hawai' i 
legislature’s response to Scott II was to amend HRS § 803-31 to give judges the authority to issue anticipatory search warrants. Shortly thereafter, this court amended HRPP Rule 41 to permit anticipatory search warrants. 
23
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
However, this court has never explicitly ruled on 
whether anticipatory search warrants are permitted under article 
I, section 7 of the Hawai' i Constitution. See Scott II, 87 
Hawai'i at 81, 951 P.2d at 1243 (disposing of the case “[w]ithout 
addressing the constitutionality of an [anticipatory search warrant]”). Thus, we address this threshold question before considering whether the Hawai' i Constitution requires triggering 
conditions to be on the face of an anticipatory search warrant. 
We hold that anticipatory search warrants are valid 
under the Hawai' i Constitution when supported by probable cause 
because they are consistent with the requirements of article I, section 7, and they incentivize police officers to obtain warrants prior to conducting searches. 
First, article I, section 7 does not contain any
 
language specifying the time at which a warrant should issue. It
 states: 
The right of the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers and effects against unreasonable
searches, seizures and invasions of privacy shall not
be violated; and no warrants shall issue but upon
probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and
particularly describing the place to be searched and
the persons or things to be seized or the
communications sought to be intercepted.
 
The Hawai' i Constitution thus requires that warrants be 
based on probable cause and particularly describe the place to be 
searched and property to be seized. See State v. Woolsey, 71 
24
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Haw. 638, 640, 802 P.2d 478, 479 (1990). Anticipatory warrants
 
satisfy these conditions--even if probable cause will not arise
 until some future event. 
Second, the probable cause analysis is conceptually “no
 
different in principle” for anticipatory search warrants because
 they still require a neutral judge to determine “(1) that it is
 now probable that (2) contraband, evidence of a crime, or a
 fugitive will be on the described premises (3) when the warrant
 is executed.” Grubbs, 547 U.S. at 96 (emphases in original). 
With either ordinary warrants or anticipatory search warrants,
 the judge must review the sworn affidavits to determine whether,
 at the time of the search, the items to be seized will be “in the
 possession of one who is charged with having obtained them
 illegally, or who keeps them illegally, or with the intent of
 using them as the means of committing a certain offense.” HRS §
 803-31. Thus, “when a government official presents independent
 evidence indicating that delivery of contraband will, or is
 likely to, occur, and when the magistrate conditions the warrant
 on that delivery, there is sufficient probable cause to uphold
 the warrant.” United States v. Garcia, 882 F.2d 699, 702 (2d
 
Cir. 1989). Also, anticipatory search warrants may make it more
 likely that the items to be seized will be at the specified
 location at the time of the search because they are based on the 
25
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
future occurrence of identified events, not “solely upon the
 
known prior location of the items to be seized.” Commonweath v.
 
Soares, 424 N.E.2d 221, 224 (Mass. 1981).
 
Third and finally, anticipatory search warrants
 
incentivize police officers to obtain approval from a neutral
 judge prior to searching private premises. Given “the speed with
 which government agents are required to act, especially when
 dealing with the furtive and transitory activities of persons who
 traffic in narcotics,” police often have to decide whether to
 “proceed without a warrant or risk losing both criminal and
 contraband.” Garcia, 882 F.2d at 703. 
The purposes of article 1, section 7 of the Hawai' i 
Constitution are better served by incentivizing officers to obtain warrants in advance “because a neutral judge, rather than a police officer acting in the heat of the moment, makes the critical determination of whether probable cause for a search exists.” People v. Carlson, 708 N.E.2d 372, 375-76 (Ill. 1999). 
By requiring neutral judges to determine whether known facts legally justify a search prior to the search taking place, anticipatory search warrants decrease the chance that a citizen will be subject to an unreasonable search, seizure, or invasion of privacy. 
Thus, we hold that anticipatory search warrants do not
 
26
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
violate the Hawai' i Constitution because they are consistent with 
the requirements and purposes of article 1, section 7.13 
C. 	Triggering Conditions Must Be Identified in the Anticipatory
Search Warrant
 
Grubbs held that the Fourth Amendment “does not require 
that the triggering condition for an anticipatory search warrant 
be set forth in the warrant itself.” 547 U.S. at 99. However, Grubbs does not dispose of this case. As correctly noted by Petitioners, “‘[A]rticle I, section 7 of the Hawai' i 
Constitution’ provides a ‘more extensive right of privacy . . . than that of the United States Constitution.’” Accordingly, we may provide broader protections if required by the relevant constitutional provisions and our case law interpreting those provisions. State v. Lopez, 78 Hawai' i 433, 445, 896 P.2d 889, 
901 (1995) (“[I]t is well-established that as long as we afford defendants the minimum protection required by the federal constitution, we are free to provide broader protection under our state constitution.”). 
13 This holding is consistent with the vast majority of state courts 
who have addressed this issued.  See Norma Rotunno, Validity of anticipatory
search warrants––state cases, 67 A.L.R.5th 361 Art. II, § 3 (originallypublished in 1999, updated weekly) (collecting cases).  These include states that have privacy rights in their state constitutions, similar to thoseenumerated in the Hawai 'i Constitution.   See, e.g., Johnson v. State, 617 P.2d 
1117, 1124  (Alaska 1980); State v. Cox, 522 P.2d 29, 34 (Ariz. 1974); Peoplev. Shapiro , 37 Cal. App. 3d 1038, 1042 (2d Dist. 1974); People v. Sousa, 18
Cal. App. 4th 549, 557 (1st Dist. 1993); Bernie v. State, 524 So.2d 988, 991
(Fla. 1998); People v. Carlson , 708 N.E.2d 372, 376 (Ill. 1999).
 
27
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Unlike the U.S. Constitution, the Hawai' i Constitution 
contains “a specific provision expressly establishing the right 
to privacy as a constitutional right” in article 1, section 6.14 
State v. Mallan, 86 Hawai' i 440, 448, 950 P.2d 178, 186 (1998) 
(emphases in original). Further, unlike the Fourth Amendment, article 1, section 7 recognizes a right “against unreasonable . . . invasions of privacy,” which “protects people from unreasonable government intrusions into their legitimate expectations of privacy.” Navas, 81 Hawai' i at 122, 913 P.2d at 48. This 
provision was “designed to protect the individual from arbitrary, oppressive, and harassing conduct on the part of government officials.” Id. (quoting Nakamoto v. Fasi, 64 Haw. 17, 23, 635 
P.2d 946, 952 (1981)). 
We have often recognized broader protections “[i]n the 
area of searches and seizures under article I, section 7” than our federal counterparts. Lopez, 78 Hawai' i at 445, 896 P.2d at 
901. This is because article I, section 7 is “enforceable by a
 
rule of reason which requires that governmental intrusions into
 the personal privacy of citizens of this State be no greater in
 intensity than absolutely necessary.” Id. at 446, 896 P.2d at
 
14
 Article 1, section 6 of the Hawai 'i Constitution provides: 
The right of the people to privacy is recognized and
shall not be infringed without the showing of a
compelling state interest.  The legislature shall take
affirmative steps to implement this right.
 
28
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
902 (quoting Kaluna, 55 Haw. at 369, 520 P.2d at 58–59) (emphasis
 
in original). 
To ensure that governmental intrusions into citizens’
 
privacy is no greater than absolutely necessary, we hold that an
 anticipatory search warrant must itself identify the triggering
 condition. 
We find the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit Court of
 
Appeals in a pre-Grubbs case, United States v. Hotal, 143 F.3d
 1223 (9th Cir. 1998), to be persuasive. Faced with the same
 question presented here, the Ninth Circuit held that “when a
 warrant’s execution is dependent on the occurrence of one or more
 conditions, the warrant itself must state the conditions
 precedent to its execution and these conditions must be clear,
 explicit, and narrow.” Id. at 1226. It explained that
 
anticipatory search warrants present a unique potential for
 abuse: 
[A] warrant conditioned on a future event presents a
potential for abuse above and beyond that which exists
in more traditional settings: inevitably, the
executing agents are called upon to determine when and
whether the triggering event specified in the warrant
has actually occurred.  Consequently, magistrates who
are asked to issue such warrants must be particularly
vigilant in ensuring that the opportunities for
exercising unfettered discretion are eliminated.
 
Id. at 1226-27 (quoting United States v. Ricciardelli, 998 F.2d
 
8, 12 (1993)). 
The Ninth Circuit explained that triggering conditions
 
29
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
serve the important role of “ensur[ing] that all parties [are]
 
advised when the search may first take place, and the conditions
 upon . . . which the search is authorized and may lawfully be
 instituted.” Id. at 1227. In this way, triggering conditions
 
are similar to the particularity requirements, as both serve to
 “ensur[e] that the discretion of the officers executing the
 warrant is limited” and to “inform[] the person subject to the
 search of what items are authorized to be seized.” Id. at 1227. 
Thus, the court stated that the warrant’s identification of the
 triggering condition “is not merely ‘efficient’ or preferable,”
 but is “the only way effectively to safeguard against
 unreasonable and unbounded searches.” Id. 
We agree with the reasoning in Hotal that the
 
triggering condition must appear on the face of the warrant to
 ensure that the executing officer does not exceed the scope of
 the warrant. As the Grubbs concurrence explained, “a warrant
 that fails to tell the truth about what a magistrate authorized
 cannot inform the police officer’s responsibility to respect the
 limits of authorization[.]” 547 U.S. at 100 (Souter, J.,
 concurring). It is particularly important that anticipatory
 search warrants clearly inform executing officers about
 triggering conditions because the triggering condition is
 integral to the judge’s probable cause finding. Scott II, 87
 
30
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Hawai'i at 80 n.1, 951 P.2d at 1243 n.1 (citation omitted) (“By 
definition, [an anticipatory search warrant] is issued before the 
necessary events have occurred which will allow a constitutional search of the premises; if those events do not transpire, the warrant is void.”). 
Anticipatory warrants’ potential for abuse “assum[es]
 
real significance when the warrant is not executed by the
 official who applied for it and happens to know the unstated
 condition.” Grubbs, 547 U.S. at 100 (Souter, J., concurring). 
If the officer who executes the warrant is different from the
 officer who applied for the warrant, the executing officer may
 “simply take[] such a warrant on its face and make[] the
 ostensibly authorized search before the unstated condition has
 been met,” thereby subjecting a private citizen to an
 unreasonable search. Id. at 100-01. 
Further, as the Grubbs concurrence noted, a warrant
 
that does not provide notice of the triggering condition
 adversely impacts “an owner’s interest in an accurate statement
 of the government’s authority to search property.” 547 U.S. at
 101 (Souter, J., concurring). HRPP Rule 41(d) requires that
 “[t]he officer taking property under the warrant shall give to
 the person from whom or from whose premises the property was
 taken a copy of the warrant and a receipt for the property taken
 
31
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
or shall leave the copy and receipt at the place from which the
 
property was taken.” Consistent with this requirement, a
 warrant’s clear identification of the triggering condition
 “reliably ‘assures the individual whose property is searched or
 seized of the lawful authority of the executing officer, his need
 to search, and the limits of his power to search.” Grubbs, 547
 
U.S. at 101 (quoting United States v. Chadwick, 433 U.S. 1, 9
 (1977)) (Souter, J., concurring). 
This holding is consistent with the purposes underlying 
Hawaii’s exclusionary rule: judicial integrity, protection of individual privacy, and deterrence of illegal police misconduct. See State v. Torres, 125 Hawai' i 382, 394, 262 P.3d 1006, 1018 
(2011). Requiring triggering conditions in anticipatory warrants deters executing officers from conducting a search prior to the occurrence of the triggering condition and thereby acting beyond the scope of the authority granted of the judge. By extension, this protects individual privacy by preventing unreasonable, arbitrary searches. Lastly, this holding will enhance judicial integrity by preventing courts from “placing their imprimatur on evidence that was illegally obtained” pursuant to a constitutionally-deficient warrant. Id. at 395, 262 P.3d at 1019 
(citation omitted). 
32
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
IV. Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, we hold that anticipatory
 
search warrants must identify the triggering condition. 
Accordingly, the ICA’s February 23, 2016 judgment on appeal
 affirming the circuit court’s denial of Petitioners’ suppression
 motion is vacated, and the case is remanded to the circuit court
 for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
