STATE OF HAWAIʻI,  
Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee,  
 
vs.  
 
WALTER GUITY,   
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant.  
After having entered a plea agreement, but prior to 
sentencing, Petitioner/Defendant
-Appellant Walter Guity 
(“Guity”), representing himself, orally moved in the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit ( “circuit court ”) to withdraw guilty 
pleas in his global plea agreement to two criminal offenses —one 
charged in the family district court (“family court case ”) that  
   
   
   
  
 
  
 
   
  
 
    
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
was legally impossible for him to have committed under the law 
in effect at the time of his plea.  The second offense was 
charged in the circuit court (“circuit court case ”).  At the 
conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court denied Guity’s oral 
motion to withdraw pleas in both cases and entered a sentence 
pursuant to the plea agreement.  
Because both of Guity’s pleas were encompassed in a 
global plea agreement, and the Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) correctly concluded that Guity was entitled to withdraw 
his plea in the family court case, the ICA should have also held that Guity was permitted to withdraw his plea in the circuit 
court case. Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s judgment on 
appeal, the circuit court’s judgments, and the circuit court’s 
order denying Guity’s motion to withdra w pleas and remand to the 
circuit court with instructions to accept Guity’s withdrawal of 
both pleas. 
I. Background 
In May 2010, Guity was charged in the family court 
with multiple counts relating to an incident with his wife, 
including attempted first-degree sexual assault.  In March 2011, 
while awaiting trial in the family court case, Guity was charged 
in the circuit court with multiple counts of second-degree and 
fourth-degree sexual assault in an incident involving another 
woman.  
2  
    
  
  
 
  At the time of the plea agreement, it was legally 
impossible for Guity to have committed  the crime to which he had 
pleaded guilty in the family c  ourt case relating to his wife.  
Hawaiʻ i  Revised Statutes (“ HRS”)   § 707-732(1)(f) (2014)   (defining 
sexual assault in the third degree as “knowingly, by strong 
compulsion,” having “sexual contact with another person”); HRS § 707-700 (2014)  (defining “sexual contact” as “a ny touching, 
other than acts of ‘sexual penetration’ , of the sexual or other  
intimate parts of 
a person not married to the actor ” (e mphasis 
  added)).  As the transcript of the change of plea hearing makes 
clear, the State, Guity, and the court accepting his plea were 
all aware at the time of his plea that third-degree sexual assault excluded an offense involving 
a spouse.    2 1
                     
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In May 2011, Guity entered a plea agreement in the 
circuit court encompassing both cases.  In that agreement, he 
pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of third-degree sexual 
assault in the family court case, and pleaded guilty to second-
degree sexual assault in the circuit court case. In return, the 
State agreed to dismiss the remaining counts in both cases.  
1 The legislature replaced the phrase “of a person not married to 
the actor” with “another” in the definition of “sexual contact” in 2016.  
2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, § 32 at 753. 
2 During the hearing, the court said, “sexual assault in the third 
degree is actually defined by the Legislature to exclude sexual contact, 
under this statute, with someone you’re married to.  But in accordance with 
the plea bargain you have agreed to plead to this offense.  Is that -- you

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Guity was represented by private counsel during his 
plea negotiations and at his change of plea hearing.  He 
subsequently became dissatisfied with his attorney, who 
withdrew.  Guity was appointed a deputy public defender; he, too, subsequently withdrew from representing Guity.  On December 
10, 2011, Guity notified the circuit court he wanted to 
represent himself.  
On January 17, 2012, the circuit court held a hearing 
in which it inquired into Guity’s desire to represent himself on 
a motion to withdraw his guilty pleas.
3 Guity’s explanation of 
his motives and readiness to represent himself was ambiguous.  For example, at the very end of the hearing, the circuit court 
asked, “I take it that you’re making a voluntary, knowing, and 
intelligent decision that you do not want [court-appointed 
counsel] to actually handle this, or you do not want to exercise 
your right to a lawyer and you want do it yourself.”  In 
response to that question, Guity stated, “I need a lawyer, your 
Honor.”  The circuit court responded, “ [l]ook, I’m not going to 
(. . . continued) 
understand all of that?”  Guity responded, “[y]es, Your Honor.”  The court 
then asked, “[a]re you giving up your right to be excluded from that statute 
by legislative language?”  Guity responded, “[y]es, Your Honor.”  The court 
then asked, “[d]o you have any questions about that?”  Guity responded, 
“[n]o, Your Honor.”  
3 The Honorable Karen S.S. Ahn presided. 
4  
   Three days later, on January 20, 2012, the circuit 
court heard Guity’s oral motion to withdraw his guilty pleas.  
He argued the motion pro se, with court-appointed counsel 
operating as stand-by counsel.  Guity argued, inter alia, that 
during the plea negotiations (and at the change of plea hearing) 
his private attorney had failed to explain to him the nature of 
the law, including the fact that he was pleading guilty to a 
crime he could not legally commit  in the family  court case.  The 
circuit court denied Guity’s motion to withdraw his guilty 
pleas.  The court later sentenced him to a  one-year term of   
imprisonment for the family court case, an eighteen-month   term 
of imprisonment for the circuit court case, and concurrent five-year terms of probation for each count pursuant to the plea 
agreement.   
                     
 
 
  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
play games, Mr. Guity.”  Nonetheless, the cour t agreed to allow 
him to represent himself with the assistance of stand-by 
appointed counsel.  Yet the court’s permission for Guity to 
represent himself was itself ambiguous, since the court closed 
the hearing by saying, “ [i]f time is your problem, I’m den ying 
your motion.  Let’s proceed.”    4 
4 Although the court sai d at the end of the hearing, “I’ m denying 
your motion[,] ” the court probably meant that it was granting Guity’s motion 
to proceed pro se in his oral motion to withdraw pleas , but denying Guity’s 
appointed counsel’s motion to withdraw from representing Guity.  That left 
Guity’s appointed counsel in the position of “stand -by counsel” for purposes 
of Guity’s motion to withdraw pleas. 
5  
  B. The ICA’s Memorandum Opinion 
  The ICA’s opinion first discussed  Guity’s challenge to 
the factual basis of the pleas to the charge in the family court 
case.  The ICA held that the circuit court had “clearly violated 
[Hawaiʻ i  Rules of Penal Procedure (“ HRPP”)]   Rule 11(g)” because 
it knew “there was no factual basis” for that plea, and it 
“affirmatively knew that it was legally impossible for Guity to 
have committed this offense.”  State v. Guity, No. CAAP-12-
0000287, 2016 WL 6427681, at *7 (App. Oct. 31, 2016)  (mem.).   
Given that the plea in the family court case  violated HRPP Rule 
11(g), the ICA concluded that the circuit court “should not have 
accepted his guilty plea to this offense.”  Id.   The ICA next 
addressed the S  tate’s argument that Guity  had waived the  defect 
in his guilty plea in the family court case.  The ICA observed 
that allowing a defendant to plead guilty to a crime he could 
not legally commit “implicates the integrity of the judicial 
system.”  Id. at *  8.   The court concluded that allowing such a 
plea “would be contrary to the truth -seeking function of the 
criminal justice system and would serve to undermine the 
integrity of the system and publi c confidence in the system.”   
Id.   For that reason, “Guity’s challenge to his guilty plea 
could not be barred by waiver.”  Id.  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
6  
     
 
   
     
  The ICA vacated the judgment in the circuit court case  
and vacated, as well, the judgment in the case involving Guity’s 
plea in the family court case.  Id.  at *10.  The ICA found that 
Guity’s plea in the latter,  to a crime he could not legally have 
committed, could never form part of a valid plea agreement.   Id.  
at *8.   Accordingly, the ICA remanded to the circuit court with 
instructions to permit Guity to withdraw that plea.  Id.  at *10.  
In contrast, the ICA found that Guity’s plea in the circuit 
court case was an otherwise valid plea tainted only by the fact   
that the record did   “not reflect a valid waiver of counsel”  at 
the time he appeared pro se to argue his motion to withdraw   
guilty pleas.   Id.  at *8.   
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The ICA also concluded that the circuit court erred in 
allowing Guity to represent himself at the motion to withdraw his guilty pleas because the circuit court had failed to first 
obtain a valid waiver of his right to counsel. Id. “Because 
Guity did not validly waive his right to counsel prior to the hearing, the results of the hearing were tainted and the Circuit 
Court’s rulings cannot stand.” Id. at *10. 
Thus, with respect to Guity’s plea to a legally 
impossible crime, the ICA remanded to the circuit court with 
instructions to permit Guity to withdraw that plea.  Id. at *10.  
But with respect t o Guity’s plea in the circuit court case, the 
7  
      
   
    
      
 
 
  
     
  
   
  
     
 
  
 II.  Standard of Review *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
ICA remanded to the circuit court with instructions to allow the 
State to exercise one of two options. Id. 
The first option allowed the State to enforce the 
remainder of the plea agreement involving the circuit court 
case. Id. If the State elected that first option, Guity would 
be entitled to a new hearing on his motion to withdraw the 
remaining guilty plea. Id. If his motion to withdraw plea in 
the new hearing was granted, Guity would be able to withdraw the 
plea.  If, however, his motion in the new hearing was denied, 
Guity would be held to his plea in the circuit court case. The 
second option would allow the State to withdraw from the plea 
agreement altogether and pursue all the original charges in both 
cases. Id. 
While it is not entirely clear, the ICA appeared to 
base its articulation of those two options on remand concerning 
the plea in the circuit court case upon the premise that “the 
State did not breach the plea agre ement” and therefore as the 
non-breaching party it “retains” those two options. Id. The 
ICA provided no explanation, and no citation to any legal 
authority, justifying or explaining its adoption of those two 
options. 
A trial court’s denial of a motion to withdraw a plea 
made prior to sentencing is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  
8  
  
  The ICA vacated both convictions  arising from Guity’s 
guilty pleas.  First, the ICA vacated the judgment in the family 
court case based on Guity’s plea to a crime he could not have 
legally committed.  Guity, 2016 WL 6427681  , at *10.  Second,  
with respect to his plea in the circuit court case, the ICA concluded that Guity had not adequately waived his right to 
counsel before proceeding to argue unsuccessfully his pro se  
motion to withdraw pleas.  Id. at *8  -*10.   
    
  
  
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
State v. Garcia, 135 Hawaiʻ i  361, 368, 351 P.3d 588, 595 (2015).  
A court abuses its discretion when, among other things, it “has 
disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.”  Id.  (quoting 
State 
v. Merino, 81 Hawai ʻi 198, 211, 91  5 P.2d 672, 685  (1996)).   
III.  Discussion  
Guity 
challenges the ICA’s failure to direct the 
circuit court to grant his motion to withdraw his plea in the circuit court case. Instead, the ICA’s remand instructions 
require the circuit court to rehear the motion to withdraw the plea, leaving the possibility open that the circuit court could 
deny Guity’s motion to withdraw the remaining plea.  Id. at *10. 
In that event, the State would retain the option of holding him to his plea on the remaining charge or withdrawing from the 
agreement. 
9  
   We conclude 
that the circuit court abused its 
discretion in  denying Guity’s motion  to withdraw his plea in the 
circuit court case .   When a motion to withdraw a plea is made 
prior to sentencing,  “a more liberal approach is to be taken, 
and the motion should be granted  if [1] the defendant has 
presented a fair and just reason for his request and [2] the 
State has not relied upon the guilty plea to its substantial  
prejudice.”  Garcia, 135 Hawaiʻ i at 368, 351 P.3d at 595 
(emphasis added) (quoting State v. Jim
, 58 Haw. 574, 576, 574 
P.2d 521, 523 (1978));  see also State v. Sanney  , 141 Hawai ʻi 14, 
22, 404 P.3d 280, 288 (2017)  (“After entry of a plea of guilty 
or nolo contendere and before sentence, the court should allow the defendant to withdraw the plea for any  fair and just 
reason.” (emphasis added) (quoting Standard 14-2.1. Plea 
Withdrawal and Specific Performance, ABA  Standards for Criminal 
Justice (3d ed. 1999))).  
  In its written “Order Denying Oral Motion to Withdraw 
Guilty Plea,” the circuit court found no fair and just reason to 
permit Guity to withdraw his pleas in both cases:  
 
   
In response to Guity’s challenge to the circuit court’s finding, the State conceded in its briefing before the ICA  that, because  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Based upon the credible evidence, and all reasonable 
inferences to be drawn therefrom, the Court finds that no 
fair and just reason has been shown to permit Defendant to 
withdraw his guilty pleas in the two cases.  The Court 
confirms that Defendant voluntarily, i
ntelligently, and 
knowingly entered his pleas of guilty on May 18, 2011. 
10  
   
 
  
 
 Both the circuit court in its order, and the State in  
its briefing, appear to  confuse  a “fair and just reason” for 
withdrawing a plea with whether a defendant attempting to 
withdraw a plea validly waived or relinquished his or her 
constitutional right to trial  (or other right) when entering the 
plea.  It is true that the failure of a defendant to enter a guilty plea knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily will  
amount to a “fair and just reason” to withdraw the plea.  See  
State v. Krstoth, 138 Hawaiʻ i  268, 276, 378 P.3d 984, 992 (2016)  
(“In this case, the record does not establish that Krstoth knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his rights by 
changing his plea, as required by law.  Therefore, ‘fair and 
just reasons’ existed for granting a withdrawal of his ple
a.”).   
It does not follow, however,  that the only permissible “fair and 
just reason” to withdraw a plea is the defendant’s failure to 
enter the plea knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.   
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
it could not show substantial prejudice, the only remaining 
question before the ICA was the “fair and just reason” 
requirement, which the State characterized as the question 
“whether the Defend ant entered the plea knowingly, 
intelligently, and voluntarily.” 
The State’s argument would convert the well-settled 
“more liberal approach” applicable to motions to withdraw pleas 
prior to sentencing into a more restrictive and demanding 
11  
   This difference between the “fair and just”   standard  
(applied to a motion to withdraw a plea  made before sentencing) 
and the “manifest injustice”  standard (applied when the motion 
is made after sentencing) is based on sound policy.   When a  
motion to withdraw a plea has been made prior to sentencing, as 
opposed to after se ntencing, there is no “ opportunity for the 
defendant to test the severity of sentence before finally committing himself to a guilty plea .”  Jim, 58 Haw. at 576, 574 
P.2d at 523 (quoting  Sherman v. United States, 383 F.2d 837, 840 
(9th Cir. 1967)).  In other words, in a motion to withdraw  a *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
standard.  See Jim  , 58 Haw. at 575-76, 574 P.2d at 522-23 
(contrasting the “manifest injustice” standard for withdrawing a 
plea subsequent to sentencing with “a more liberal approach” to 
plea withdrawals prior to sentencing).   Under Jim, where  the 
State has not relied upon the guilty plea to its substantial 
prejudice, “the motion should be granted if the defendant has 
presented a fair and just r eason for his request[.]”  Id. at  
576, 574 P.2d at 523; see also State v. Costa   , 64 Haw. 564, 565, 
644 P.2d 1329, 1331 (1982)  (noting that a  defendant attempting 
to withdraw a plea prior to sentencing “has the burden of 
establishing plausible and legitimate grounds for the 
withdrawal”); HRPP Rule 32(d)  (providing that a motion to 
withdraw a plea made within ten days of imposition  of sentence  
may be made “to correct manifest injustice”) .    
12  
  
  
 
    
 
 
   
 
  Guity aptly observes that this court has yet to 
consider whether a defendant’s withdrawal of one plea entered 
pursuant to a single plea agreement that encompasses multiple 
charges and/or criminal matters necessarily permits him or her 
to withdraw all of the other pleas that were part of the same 
agreement.  As noted, in so doing we consider whether Guity has 
established a fair and just reason for his request to withdraw 
his plea in the circuit court case.  In Garcia, the failure of  
the government to comply with the terms of a plea agreement was *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
plea made prior to sentencing, the defendant cannot obtain a 
sentence and then move to withdraw the plea if he or she deems 
that sentence too severe.  The effect of allowing a defendant to 
withdraw his or her plea prior to sentencing for any fair and 
just reason is to allow the defendant to pursue his or her 
constitutional right to trial on the original charges.  
Here, Guity knew as he was entering his plea that he 
was pleading to a crime it was impossible for him to have committed.  Guity maintains that he was entitled to withdraw his 
plea in the family court case because “it was legally impossible 
for him to have committed third-degree sexual assault of his 
wife[.]”  Hence, he asserts:   
[Because] the plea in the Family Court Case and the plea in 
the Circuit Court Case cannot be viewed separately or in 
isolation of one another as they were part of a global plea 
agreement . . . which was not divisible . . . his pleas 
should be withdrawn in both the Family Court Case and the 
Circuit Court Case. 
13  
    
                     
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
deemed a fair and just reason for the defendant to withdraw his 
guilty plea prior to sentencing.  By analogy, in the instant 
case, the plea agreement was legally unenforceable through no 
fault of the defendant, thus demonstrating a fair and just 
reason for the withdrawal.  The objective facts surrounding 
Guity’s plea agreement adequately indicate that the agreement 
was meant to be a single agreement.  In this case, the pleas in 
the circuit court case and the family court case were negotiated 
contemporaneously.  The final plea agreement, which contained 
all of the terms and conditions relating to Guity’s  guilty pleas 
in both cases, was contained in one document.   Guity entered, 
and the circuit court accepted, both of his pleas at the same 
change of plea hearing.  Further, at the change of plea  hearing, 
the circuit court conducted most of the colloquy req  uired under 
HRPP Rule 11 with respect to both of Guity’s guilty pleas at the 
same time.  On this record, the plea agreement in this case was 
clearly a global plea agreement.   5 
The ICA held correctly that Guity was entitled to 
withdraw his guilty plea in the family 
court case because “the 
Circuit Court definitively knew that it was legally impossible 
for Guity to have committed third-degree sexual assault of his 
5 Containment of the terms and conditions of both pleas in one 
document is a factor but not a requirement for determination of a global plea 
agreement. 
14  
   As noted by Guity, the Supreme Court of Washington 
applied a similar analysis to analogous circumstances in State 
v. Turley, 69 P.3d 338 (Wash. 2003).  In Turley, the defendant  
pleaded guilty to one count of escape in the first-degree (“escape count”) and one count of conspiracy to manufacture 
methamphetamine (“ conspiracy count”) pursuant to a plea 
agreement.  69 P.3d at 340.  At the plea hearing, the government erroneously represented that mandatory community placement was 
not required as part of the sentence on the conspiracy count.  
Id.   The trial court accepted the defendant’s pleas, and 
sentenced him to seventy-two months of imprisonment for the 
escape count and twelve months of imprisonment for the 
conspiracy count, which were to run concurrently with one 
another.  Id.    
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
wife[.]”  Guity, 2016 WL 6427681 at *7.  As explained above, the  
record in this case supports t hat Guity’s guilty plea in the 
family court case was a component of a single  agreement that 
included his plea in the circuit court case.  Therefore, because 
Guity was entitled to withdraw his plea in the family court 
case, he was also entitled to withdraw his plea in the circuit 
court case.     
Nearly three years after the defendant entered his 
plea, the government learned that the conspiracy count carried a 
mandatory sentence of twelve months of community placement, and 
15  
   
  
  
  
 
  
  
  The Supreme Court of Washington reversed the Court of 
Appeals.  Id.   The Turley  court highlighted that the defendant 
negotiated and pleaded to the two charges contemporaneously, 
that one document contained the plea to and conditions for both 
charges, that the trial court accepted both pleas at one hearing, and that at the hearing, the trial court advised the 
defendant of the consequences of his plea, but did not separate 
the consequences based upon the individual charges.  Id.  at 341-
42.  Consequently, the Supreme Court of Washington concluded that because the plea a greement was “one bargain, or . . . a 
‘package deal[,]’” and the defendant was entitled to withdraw his plea to the conspiracy count, the defendant should have also *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
filed a motion to amend the judgment and sentence to include 
this term.  Id. Subsequently, the defendant moved to withdraw 
both of his pleas.  Id. The defendant argued that he was 
entitled to withdraw his plea to the conspiracy count because he 
was misinformed about the sentence he could receive on that 
offense.  Id. Accordingly, the defendant asserted that because 
the plea agreement covered both the escape count and the 
conspiracy count, he was also entitled to withdraw his plea with 
respect to the escape count.  Id. The trial court allowed the 
defendant to withdraw his guilty plea as to the conspiracy 
count, but not the escape count.  Id. The Washington Court of 
Appeals affirmed.  Id. 
16  
   The Supreme Court of Washington’s analysis in Turley  
is persuasive; we conclude that the  plea agreement in this case 
was a  “package deal.”  Because the ICA correctly held that Guity 
was entitled to withdraw his guilty plea in the family court 
case, the ICA should have also concluded that Guity was entitled 
to withdraw his guilty plea in the circuit court case.   
   
  
 
 IV. Conclusion 
    
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
been allowed to withdraw his plea to the escape count.  Id.   The 
Turley  court thus remanded the case to the trial court with 
instructions to allow the defendant to withdraw his pleas to 
both counts.  Id.      
To conclude, on the facts in this case, the ICA erred 
insofar as it held that Guity is not entitled to withdraw his guilty plea in the circuit court case. Rather, the circuit 
court should have allowed Guity to withdraw both of his pleas. 
For the reasons stated above, we hold the circuit 
court abused its discretion in denying Guity’s motion to 
withdraw both pleas.  We vacate the ICA’s November 21, 2016 
judgment on appeal, the circuit court’s March 5, 2012 judgment 
in the circuit court case, the circuit court’s March 8, 2012 
amended judgment in the family court case, and the circuit 
court’s January 20, 2012 order denying Guity’s motion to 
withdraw pleas. We remand to the circuit court with
