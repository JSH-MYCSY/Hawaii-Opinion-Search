OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAYAMA, J. 
This case concerns a dispute over whether agreements 
between the Petitioner/Union-Appellant Hawai' i State Teachers *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
1
Association (HSTA)  and the Respondent/Employer-Appellee
2
University Laboratory School (ULS)  mandate arbitration of a
grievance filed by the HSTA against the ULS. The HSTA’s
 grievance alleged that the ULS refused to implement a step
 placement chart for a salary schedule agreed to in a supplemental
 agreement negotiated by the HSTA and the School Board. The ULS
 responded that the step placement chart the HSTA sought to
 enforce had never been agreed upon or incorporated into the
 agreement. 
The HSTA filed, as a special proceeding in the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit (circuit court), a motion to compel arbitration of its grievance. The circuit court denied the HSTA’s motion to compel arbitration and the HSTA appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA). The ICA concluded that the Hawai'i Labor Relations Board (HLRB) had primary jurisdiction 
over the issues raised in the HSTA’s grievance and that the HSTA’s motion to compel arbitration was premature. We hold that because the parties agreed to leave questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator, our case law mandated that the circuit court grant the HSTA’s motion to compel arbitration after concluding

that an arbitration agreement existed.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On June 30, 2009, the ULS was transferred from the 
University of Hawai' i College of Education at the University of 
Hawai'i at Manoa to the local school board as a public charter 
school. At that time, the ULS and the HSTA entered into a 
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that memorialized the collective bargaining agreement (Master Agreement) already in effect between the HSTA and the State of Hawai' i Board of Education. The 
parties agreed that the HSTA was thereafter the employees’ bargaining representative and the ULS was the employer. The MOA also stipulated that the parties were subject to future supplemental agreements. 
On June 21, 2010, the HSTA and the ULS signed a
 
supplemental agreement (Supplemental Agreement) governing the
 salaries of the ULS’s unit 5 employees. Appendix XIV of the
 Supplemental Agreement provided:
 
[A]n employee’s appropriate salary placement
designation (class and step) is made onto the unit 5
master agreement salary schedule.  For step placement,
parties shall use the attached chart (Exhibit 1)
indicating negotiated step increments for unit 5
members.
 
(Emphasis added). To calculate a unit 5 teacher’s salary, the
 
salary schedule and the step placement chart from Exhibit 1 were
 required. However, no document entitled Exhibit 1 was attached
 
3
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to the Supplemental Agreement.
 
On October 29, 2010, during an ongoing inquiry into the
 
proper step placement of certain ULS employees, the HSTA informed
 
the ULS via email that “it was brought to [the HSTA’s] attention
 that [it] had inadvertently omitted ‘Exhibit 1’ for Appendix
 XIV.” The HSTA attached a document to its email that was
 purportedly the “inadvertently omitted” Exhibit 1 and it
 instructed the ULS that this document “should be included as part
 
[of] the [S]upplemental [A]greement.”
 
On November 9, 2010, the ULS denied having agreed to
 
the terms of the purported “Exhibit 1,” stating that, although it
 
recalled the chart in the document, “[a]t no time during the
 negotiations did [ULS] assume that [it] would be following that
 
[chart] in setting [teachers’] salaries.” The ULS had assumed
 
that a different chart used during subsequent negotiations was
 
the “missing Exhibit 1” and it had used that other chart when
 calculating teachers’ salaries.
 
On April 13, 2011, pursuant to Article V of the
 
3
Supplemental Agreement , the HSTA filed a grievance alleging that
Appendix XIV and Exhibit 1 were bargained for in good faith and
 
3
 Article V of both the Supplemental Agreement and the Master
 
Agreement contain identical provisions regarding grievances whereby the
parties assented to submit unresolved claims to arbitration and to leave
questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator.
 
4
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that the ULS “refused to implement the proper salary placement
 
for teachers, thereby, repudiating Appendix XIV of the
 supplemental agreement.” Then, on April 21, 2011, the HSTA
 notified the ULS that it wished to proceed to arbitration. 
The ULS contested HSTA’s request for arbitration and 
responded by filing a prohibited practice complaint with the HLRB on April 28, 2011. In its complaint, the ULS alleged that the HSTA refused to bargain in good faith and to comply with the terms of the Supplemental Agreement, in violation of Hawai' i 
Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 89-13(b)(1), (2), (4), and (5) (Supp. 2010).
4 Furthermore, the ULS alleged that the HSTA violated HRS 
5
§ 89-10.8(a)(1) (Supp. 2010)  by attempting to use the grievance
process to alter the Supplemental Agreement.
 
4 HRS § 89-13(b) provided then, as it does now, in pertinent part:
 
It shall be a prohibited practice for a public employee or
for an employee organization or its designated agent
wilfully to:
 
(1) Interfere, restrain, or coerce any employee in the
exercise of any right guaranteed under this chapter;
 
(2) Refuse to bargain collectively in good faith with the
public employer, if it is an exclusive representative, as
required in section 89-9;
 
. . . . 
(4) Refuse or fail to comply with any provision of this
chapter; or 
(5) Violate the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.
 
5
 HRS § 89-10.8(a)(1) provided then, as it does now: “A dispute
 
over the terms of an initial or renewed agreement shall not constitute a
grievance.” 
5
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Before the HLRB, the HSTA filed a motion on May 12,
 
2011 to dismiss the ULS’s complaint and the ULS filed a motion on
 
July 13, 2011 to stay all arbitration proceedings. At a hearing
 on August 12, 2011, the HLRB denied the motion to dismiss the
 complaint and took the motion to stay arbitration under
 advisement.
6
 
Due to the ULS’s continued refusal to enter
 
arbitration, on August 3, 2011, the HSTA filed a motion in a
 special proceeding in the circuit court to compel arbitration of
 its grievance pursuant to HRS § 658A-7 (Supp. 2010).
7 The
 
6 After almost two years of no action from the HLRB, on July 23,
 
2013, the ULS filed a motion for partial summary judgment on its complaint.
On August 14, 2013, the HSTA filed a motion to stay proceedings before the
HLRB until this court’s review was completed.  By order of November 5, 2013,
the HLRB granted in part the ULS’s motion for partial summary judgment and
denied the HSTA’s motion to stay the  proceedings before the HLRB pending this
 court’s review of this case.  The HLRB also granted the ULS’s July 13, 2011
motion to stay the arbitration proceedings.
 
The HLRB’s order is not ripe for review by this court and has no
bearing upon our resolution of this case.  However, we note that the HLRB
cites to no statutory or legal authority granting it the authority to stay a
pending arbitration proceeding or a court’s review of a motion to compel
arbitration.  The HLRB’s powers derive from and are limited by HRS chapter 89.
No provisions in HRS chapter 89 grant the HLRB the power to stay proceedings
before any other body.  Therefore, the HLRB’s purported stay of the
arbitration proceedings is of no legal effect.
 
7 HRS § 658A-7 provided then, as it does now, in pertinent part:
 
(a) On motion of a person showing an agreement to arbitrate
and alleging another person’s refusal to arbitrate pursuant
to the agreement:
 
(1) If the refusing party does not appear or does not
oppose the motion, the court shall order the parties to
arbitrate; and
 
(2) If the refusing party opposes the motion, the
(continued...)

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
circuit court denied HSTA’s motion to compel arbitration by order
 
of March 2, 2012.8 The circuit court did not provide an
 
explanation of its reasoning in denying the motion, although it
 noted during argument on the motion that this case raised novel
 issues regarding the jurisdiction of the HLRB. 
The HSTA appealed the circuit court’s March 2, 2012
 
order, and March 28, 2012 final judgment, to the ICA. In its
 opening brief, the HSTA argued that the circuit court had
 jurisdiction over the agreement and that the HSTA fulfilled the
 conditions to compel arbitration. In response, the ULS argued
 that the matter was unripe for adjudication and that the HLRB had
 original jurisdiction over the dispute.
 
On April 15, 2013, the ICA issued its opinion
 
concluding that the circuit court did not err in denying HSTA’s
 motion to compel arbitration. Haw. State Teachers Ass’n v. Univ.
 
Lab. School, Educ. Lab. Pub. Charter School Local School Bd.
 (HSTA v. ULS), No. CAAP-12-0000295, 2013 WL 1578338 at *1, *4
 (App. Apr. 15, 2013). Referencing the probability of conflicting
 or redundant results, the ICA reasoned that denying the motion
 
7(...continued)
court shall proceed summarily to decide the issue and order
the parties to arbitrate unless it finds that there is no
enforceable agreement to arbitrate.

 The Honorable Patrick W. Border presided.
 
7
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
was proper because HSTA’s motion implicated technical and policy
 
issues over which the HLRB had primary jurisdiction.9 Id. at *4. 
On July 16, 2013, the HSTA timely filed an application
 
for writ of certiorari to this court in which it contended that
 the ICA erred in applying the doctrine of primary jurisdiction
 and in affirming the circuit court’s denial of HSTA’s motion to
 compel arbitration. We accepted certiorari on August 28, 2013,
 and held oral argument on October 17, 2013.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Petition to Compel Arbitration
 
We review a petition to compel arbitration de novo. 
Douglass v. Pflueger Hawai' i, Inc., 110 Hawai' i 520, 524, 135 P.3d 
129, 133 (2006). “The standard is the same as that which would be applicable to a motion for summary judgment, and the trial court’s decision is reviewed ‘using the same standard employed by the trial court and based upon the same evidentiary materials as were before [it] in determination of the motion.’” Id. at 524­
25, 135 P.3d at 133-34 (alterations in original) (quoting Koolau Radiology, Inc. v. Queen’s Med. Ctr., 73 Haw. 433, 439-40, 834 
9
 Rather than affirming the circuit court’s order, the ICA vacated 
the order and remanded the case with instructions to consider whether a stay
or dismissal without prejudice would be appropriate.  HSTA v. ULS , 2013 WL 
1578338 at *4.  The ICA reasoned that under the primary jurisdiction doctrine,without a finding that the parties would not be “unfairly disadvantaged” by adismissal, the circuit court was required to stay the proceedings.  Id. (emphasis omitted) (quoting Pavsek v. Sandvold, 127 Hawai 'i 390, 402, 279 P.3d 
55, 67 (App. 2012).

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
P.2d 1294, 1298 (1992)).
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Parties may reserve questions of arbitrability for the
arbitrator
 
This court has repeatedly acknowledged the general 
enforceability of arbitration agreements. See, e.g., Douglass, 
110 Hawai' i at 530, 135 P.3d at 139; Luke v. Gentry Realty, Ltd., 
105 Hawai' i 241, 247, 96 P.3d 261, 267 (2004); Brown v. KFC Nat’l 
Mgmt. Co., 82 Hawai' i 226, 232, 921 P.2d 146, 152 (1996). The 
Uniform Arbitration Act, adopted in Hawai' i in 2001 and codified 
at HRS chapter 658A, provides that when a court has “jurisdiction 
over the controversy and the parties[, it] may enforce an agreement to arbitrate.” HRS § 658A-26 (Supp. 2010). An arbitration agreement is “valid, enforceable, and irrevocable except upon a ground that exists at law or in equity for the revocation of a contract.” HRS § 658A-6(a) (Supp. 2010). 
Our statutes have delineated the roles of courts and
 
arbitrators in enforcing arbitration agreements; “[t]he court
 shall decide whether an agreement to arbitrate exists or a
 controversy is subject to an agreement to arbitrate” and “[a]n
 arbitrator shall decide whether a condition precedent to
 arbitrability has been fulfilled and whether a contract
 containing a valid agreement to arbitrate is enforceable.” HRS
 
9
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
§§ 658(b)-(c). “When presented with a motion to compel 
arbitration, the court is limited to answering two questions: 1) whether an arbitration agreement exists between the parties; and 2) if so whether the subject matter of the dispute is arbitrable under such agreement.” Koolau, 73 Haw. at 445, 834 P.2d at 1300. 
The second prong of this rule -- “whether the subject matter of the dispute lies within the arbitrator’s jurisdiction” -- is termed the “arbitrability” of the dispute. Hokama v. Univ. of 
Haw., 92 Hawai' i 268, 274 n.6, 990 P.2d 1150, 1156 n.6 (1999). 
We have modified this general rule for cases in which 
the parties have agreed to leave questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator. See Bateman Constr., Inc. v. Haitsuka Bros., 
Ltd., 77 Hawai' i 481, 485, 889 P.2d 58, 62 (1995) (“[T]he 
question of arbitrability is usually an issue to be decided by the courts, ‘unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise.’” (alterations omitted) (quoting FSC Sec. Corp. v. Freel, 14 F.3d 1310, 1312 (8th Cir. 1994)). Where the parties have “clearly and unmistakably” reserved the issue of arbitrability for the arbitrator, courts lack the authority to rule upon this issue because “[a]fter all, ‘it was the arbitrator’s judgment [the parties] had bargained for, not a court’s.’” Id. (alterations omitted) (quoting Morrison Knudsen 
Co. v. Makahuena Corp., 66 Haw. 663, 670, 675 P.2d 760, 766 
10
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(1983)); see also Bronster v. United Public Workers, Local 646, 
90 Hawai' i 9, 14-16, 975 P.2d 766, 771-73 (1999) (“[P]arties are 
free to agree among themselves to vest sole authority in an arbitrator to determine the issue of the arbitrability of a particular subject matter so long as they do so ‘clearly and unmistakably.’” (quoting Bateman Constr., Inc., 77 Hawai' i at 
485, 889 P.2d at 62)). “Parties may contractually excise the court from the determination” of whether the dispute is arbitrable and, in these cases, the court may only consider whether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate. Bronster, 90 
Hawai'i at 15, 975 P.2d at 772; see also In re United Public 
Workers, Local 646, 124 Hawai' i 372, 378, 244 P.3d 609, 615 
(2010) (“When agreements reserve questions of arbitrability for the arbitrator, as they do here, the court may only consider the first prong[ -- whether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate].”) 
1.	 The HSTA and the ULS contracted to leave questions of
arbitrability to the arbitrator
 
The Master Agreement and the Supplemental Agreement
 
contained identical provisions regarding the grievance process:
 
ARTICLE V - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
 
A. DEFINITION. Any claim by the [HSTA] or a teacher that
there has been a violation, misinterpretation or
misapplication of a specific term or terms of this Agreement
shall be a grievance.
 
. . . .
 
11
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
H. ARBITRATION. If a claim made by the [HSTA] or teacher
has not been satisfactorily resolved, the Association may
present a request for arbitration of the grievance within
ten (10) days after the receipt of the decision.
 
. . . .
 
e) If the Employer disputes the arbitrability of any
grievance submitted to arbitration, the arbitrator shall
first determine the question of arbitrability.  If the
 arbitrator finds that it is not arbitrable, the grievance
shall be referred back to the parties without decision or
recommendation on its merits.
 
(Emphasis added). These provisions establish that the HSTA and
 
the ULS agreed to arbitrate grievances and reserved questions of
 arbitrability for the arbitrator.
 
In Bronster, we interpreted similar arbitration 
provisions. In that case, Attorney General Bronster sought a declaration that the Office of the Attorney General was not subject to arbitration pursuant to an agreement between the State of Hawai' i and the United Public Workers Union (UPW). Bronster, 
90 Hawai' i at 9-10, 975 P.2d at 766-67. The circuit court denied 
the UPW’s motions to stay proceedings pending arbitration, to compel arbitration, and for summary judgment and granted Bronster’s motion for summary judgment. Id. On appeal to this 
court, we first concluded that, “as a ‘representative’ or agent of the State, the Attorney General was a ‘party’ to the agreement.” Id. at 10, 975 P.2d at 767. We then interpreted the 
arbitration provision in the agreement between the UPW and the State which provided: “[i]f the Employer disputes the 
12
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
arbitrability of any grievance under the terms of this Agreement,
 
the Arbitrator shall first determine whether he has jurisdiction
 to act; and if he finds that he has no such power, the grievance
 shall be referred back to the parties without decision on its
 merits.” Id. (alteration and emphasis in original). We reasoned
 
that “[w]ithout question, here . . . the agreement calls ‘clearly
 and unmistakably’ for the arbitrator to decide the arbitrability
 of a grievance.” Id. at 15, 975 P.2d at 772. While Attorney
 
General Bronster contended that UPW failed to comply with certain
 provisions of the agreement in bringing its grievance, we
 characterized this as a question of arbitrability. We concluded
 that the issue of arbitrability had been “expressly reserved by
 the parties for determination by the arbitrator” and thus the
 circuit court erred in addressing this question. Id. at 16, 975
 
P.2d at 773. We held that, because there was an arbitration
 agreement between the parties that reserved the question of
 arbitrability for the arbitrator, the circuit court erred in
 granting Bronster’s motion for summary judgment and in denying
 UPW’s motions for summary judgment and to compel arbitration. 
Id. 
Here, it is uncontested that there was an arbitration
 
agreement between the parties. Using similar language to that in
 Bronster, the agreement in the instant case “clearly and
 
13
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
unmistakably” left the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator. 
Therefore, because the question of whether there was a valid
 arbitration agreement between the parties was uncontested, the
 circuit court should have granted the HSTA’s motion to compel
 arbitration. 
2.	 The determination of whether a grievance exists is
a question of arbitrability reserved for the arbitrator
 
The ULS contends that pursuant to the laws for
 
“Collective Bargaining in Public Employment” codified in HRS
 chapter 89, this is a bargaining dispute and therefore it is not
 a grievance subject to the parties’ arbitration agreement. HRS §
 89-10.8 governs the “Resolution of disputes; grievances” and
 states: “A public employer shall enter into written agreement
 with the exclusive representative setting forth a grievance
 procedure culminating in a final and binding decision, to be
 invoked in the event of any dispute concerning the interpretation
 or application of a written agreement.” This statute clarifies
 that “[a] dispute over the terms of an initial or renewed
 agreement” is not a grievance. HRS § 89-10.8(a)(1) (emphasis
 added). HRS § 89-11 (Supp. 2010) governs the “Resolution of
 disputes; impasses” and states that parties may enter into an
 agreement establishing an “alternate impasse procedure” that may
 “be invoked in the event of an impasse over the terms of an
 
14
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
initial or renewed agreement.” (Emphasis added).
 
The ICA erred in stating that pursuant to the parties’ 
agreements, and HRS § 89-10.8, the circuit court may only order 
arbitration after finding that a grievance exists. HSTA v. ULS, 
2013 WL 1578338 at *3. It is immaterial whether this case involves a “grievance” or a “dispute over the terms of an initial or renewed agreement.” “[A]s with any contract, the parties’ intentions control, but those intentions are generously construed as to issues of arbitrability.” Lee v. Heftel, 81 Hawai' i 1, 4, 
911 P.2d 721, 724 (1996) (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 626 (1985)). We have previously classified the issue of whether claims fall within the scope of an arbitration clause to be a question of arbitrability. See Haw. Med. Ass’n v. Haw. Med. Servs. Ass’n, 
113 Hawai' i 77, 92, 148 P.3d 1179, 1194 (2006) (discussing 
whether the disputes fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement as an issue of arbitrability); see also Univ. of Haw. Prof’l Assembly v. Univ. of Haw., 66 Haw. 207, 210, 659 P.2d 717, 719 (1983) (“The arbitration process may only be used when the grievance involves the violation of a provision of the agreement. Thus the questions of arbitrability and whether the agreement is involved are one and the same.”). 
Here, the question of whether the HSTA’s claim
 
15
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
constitutes a grievance subject to the arbitration provisions of
 
the Supplemental Agreement is a question of arbitrability. As
 discussed above, the HSTA and the ULS explicitly agreed to leave
 all questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator. Therefore, it
 was not necessary for the circuit court to determine whether
 HSTA’s claim constituted a grievance before granting the motion
 to compel arbitration. 
B. The doctrine of primary jurisdiction does not apply
 
“The primary jurisdiction doctrine is designed to 
promote uniformity and consistency in the regulatory process.” 
Aged Hawaiians v. Hawaiian Homes Comm’n, 78 Hawai' i 192, 202, 891 
P.2d 279, 289 (1995) (quoting United States v. Western Pac. R.R., 
352 U.S. 59, 64 (1956)). This doctrine recognizes that “‘in 
cases raising issues of fact not within the conventional experience of judges or cases requiring the exercise of administrative discretion, agencies created by [the legislature] for regulating the subject matter should not be passed over.’” Kona Old Hawaiian Trails Group v. Lyman, 69 Haw. 81, 93, 734 P.2d 161, 169 (1987) (emphasis in original) (quoting Far East Conference v. United States, 342 U.S. 570, 574-75 (1952)). “The primary jurisdiction doctrine applies to a claim that is originally cognizable in the courts but which requires the resolution of issues that are within the special competence of an 
16
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
administrative agency.” Fratinardo v. Emps. Ret. Sys. of Haw., 
121 Hawai' i 462, 468, 220 P.3d 1043, 1049 (App. 2009) (quoting 
Jou v. Nat’l Interstate Ins. Co. of Haw., 114 Hawai' i 122, 128­
29, 157 P.3d 561, 567–68 (App. 2007)). 
Here, the ICA concluded that the primary jurisdiction
 
doctrine was applicable because the “HSTA’s motion to compel
 
arbitration implicat[ed] technical and policy issues” within the
 jurisdiction of the HLRB. HSTA v. ULS, 2013 WL 1578338 at *4. 
The ICA reasoned that “the issue which HSTA wishes to compel to
 arbitration is closely related to the issues raised in ULS’s
 prohibited practice complaint” and the HLRB had “exclusive
 original jurisdiction” over the issues raised in the ULS’s
 complaint. HSTA v. ULS, 2013 WL 1578338 at *3.
 
The ICA need not have reached the issue of the HLRB’s 
possible primary jurisdiction over this dispute. Before a court, or an arbitrator, can apply the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, it must first determine that it has jurisdiction over the dispute. Fratinardo, 121 Hawai' i at 468, 220 P.3d at 1049. As 
discussed above, the only issue before the circuit court was whether an arbitration agreement between the HSTA and the ULS existed. This issue was uncontested and, regardless, it did not implicate the expertise of the HLRB. Thus, the ICA erred in applying the doctrine of primary jurisdiction to conclude that 
17
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the HSTA’s motion to compel arbitration was premature. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Because, it is undisputed that the Master Agreement and
 
the Supplemental Agreement contained arbitration clauses that
 
‘clearly and unmistakably’ reserved questions of arbitrability
 for determination by the arbitrator, the circuit court erred in
 failing to grant the HSTA’s motion to compel arbitration. We
 therefore vacate the ICA’s May 17, 2013 Judgment on Appeal filed
 pursuant to its April 15, 2013 opinion and remand this case to
 the circuit court for further proceedings.
