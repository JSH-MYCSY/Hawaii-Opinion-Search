DONALD EDWARD KROG, in his capacity as Trustee of
the Donald Edward Krog Living Trust, Dated March 25, 2010,
Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee,
 
vs.
 
ELEANA UMILANI KOAHOU and YVONNE MOKIHANA KEAHI,
Petitioners/Defendants-Appellants.
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(CAAP-12-0000315; CIV. NO. 11-1-1697-08)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakayama, Acting C.J., McKenna, J.,
and Circuit Judge Nacino, in place of Recktenwald, C.J., recused,
with Acoba, J., concurring separately,
with whom Pollack, J., joins)
 
Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee Donald Edward Krog, in
 
his capacity as trustee of the Donald Edward Krog Living Trust
 
(Respondent) purchased the former home of Petitioners/Defendants-
Appellants Eleana Umilani Koahou and Yvonne Mokihana Keahi
 (Petitioners) from a third party following a non-judicial
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
foreclosure sale. Petitioners refused to vacate the property
 
after the sale. Respondent filed a complaint for trespass and
 ejectment and a motion for summary judgment in the Circuit Court
 of the First Circuit (circuit court). The circuit court granted
 Respondent’s motion for summary judgment, entered its final
 judgment and writ of ejectment in favor of Respondent, and
 ordered Petitioners to pay Respondent damages for their trespass
 and wrongful possession as well as attorneys’ fees and costs
 under the theory of assumpsit.
 
The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed the
 
circuit court’s grant of summary judgment and award of damages
 and attorneys’ fees and costs in a Summary Disposition Order
 (SDO). Petitioners filed an application for writ of certiorari
 to this court challenging the damages and attorneys’ fees and
 costs awards. We conclude that the circuit court’s award of
 damages was not erroneous. However, we hold that the circuit
 court erred in awarding attorneys’ fees and costs to Respondent
 because the court lacked the requisite jurisdiction to order such
 an award and because there was no legal justification for the
 award.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
In 2009, Petitioners received a notice of default from
 
MetLife Bank, N.A. (MetLife) requesting that Petitioners
 
2
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
immediately pay $6,261.06 in past due mortgage payments on their 
property at 1721 Akaakoa Street, Kailua, Hawai' i 96734 (the 
Property). On November 17, 2010, MetLife recorded a notice of mortgagee’s non-judicial foreclosure under power of sale. At a public auction on January 6, 2011, Scott Kim purchased the Property for $521,000.00. Petitioners did not challenge the foreclosure sale. 
Respondent purchased the Property from Kim for
 
$546,677.08 plus all associated costs. Kim deeded the Property
 to Respondent, and escrow closed on February 18, 2011. However,
 Petitioners’ continued occupation of the Property prevented
 Respondent from taking possession.
 
On August 8, 2011, Respondent filed a complaint for
 
ejectment and trespass in the circuit court. Respondent
 requested the ejectment of Petitioners, damages “in an amount
 reflecting the reasonable value of the Property for the time
 [Respondent] ha[d] been deprived of possession,” and costs and
 attorneys’ fees.
 
On November 21, 2011, Respondent filed a motion for
 
summary judgment arguing that there were no genuine issues of
 material fact regarding his possession of legal title to the
 Property. In a declaration attached to his motion, Respondent
 stated: “[I]t is my opinion as the owner of the Property that a
 
3
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
fair and reasonable rental rate for the Property would be
 
$2,500.00 per month.”
 
At a hearing on December 21, 2011, the circuit court1
 
granted Respondent’s motion for summary judgment as to all counts
 contained in the complaint. On January 26, 2012, the court
 entered its order granting Respondent’s motion and concluding
 that Respondent was the owner of the Property. 
On February 17, 2012, Petitioners filed a motion for
 
stay pending appeal to the ICA. Petitioners also stated that
 “[s]hould the Court require the posting of a supersedeas bond,
 said bond should be based upon the reasonably certain damages for
 delay that Plaintiff would incur by being deprived in the future
 of possession of the property during the pendency of this
 appeal.” (Emphasis omitted). To aid in the calculation of these
 damages, Petitioners filed a declaration from real estate broker
 Neil Sauvage stating that his “professional rental valuation
 establish[ed] the fair monthly rental value of the property to be
 $2,200 to $2,400 per month.”
 
On March 5, 2012, Respondent filed a memorandum in
 
opposition to the motion for a stay and additionally argued that
 he was entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and costs. In
 that motion, Respondent contended that Petitioners’ proposed
 
1

4
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
supersedeas bond was insufficient because, as the prevailing
 
party, Respondent was entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and
 costs pursuant to HRS § 667-33(c) (Supp. 2011).
2 Respondent
 
stated, “Although [Respondent] has not yet filed his motion for
 an award of attorneys’ fees and costs, the language of the
 statute makes it clear that such an award is mandatory.” 
(Emphasis added).
 
In their reply memorandum to the motion for a stay,
 
filed March 9, 2012, Petitioners argued that Respondent was not
 entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees because this was not an
 action in assumpsit and HRS chapter 667 was similarly
 inapplicable. 
On March 9, 2012, the circuit court entered its final
 
judgment in favor of Respondent and against Petitioners. The
 circuit court concluded that Respondent was the owner of the
 
2 HRS § 667-33(c) provided then, as it does now:
 
The mortgagor and any person claiming by, through, or under
the mortgagor and who is remaining in possession of the
mortgaged property after the recordation of the affidavit
and the conveyance document shall be considered a tenant at
sufferance subject to eviction or ejectment.  The purchaser
may bring an action in the nature of summary possession
under chapter 666, ejectment, or trespass or may bring any
other appropriate action in a court where the mortgaged
property is located to obtain a writ of possession, a writ
of assistance, or any other relief.   In any such action, the
court shall award the prevailing party its reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs and all other reasonable fees and
costs, all of which are to be paid for by the non-prevailing
party.
 
(Emphasis added).
 
5
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Property and ordered Petitioners to pay Respondent “$26,400 as
 
damages for their trespass and wrongful possession of the
 Property from February 18, 2011 through December 21, 2011” and
 an additional $2,400 a month until Petitioners returned
 possession of the Property to Respondent. The circuit court also
 issued a writ of ejectment against Petitioners. 
On March 13, 2012, the circuit court held a hearing on
 
Petitioners’ motion for a stay. During the hearing, the circuit
 court denied Petitioners’ motion. The circuit court also stated
 that Petitioners’ proposed supersedeas bond of monthly payments
 of $2,400 was insufficient and that attorneys’ fees and costs
 should be included in the calculation. Petitioners responded by
 reiterating their argument that there was no contractual or
 statutory basis for the award of attorneys’ fees and costs. 
Respondent stated: “[W]e’ll be separately filing a motion for an
 award of attorney’s fees and costs. We believe there’s
 
substantial case law that says in actions of this nature, in the
 nature of ejectment, that attorney’s fees and costs are
 awardable.” (Emphasis added). 
By minute order of March 14, 2012, the circuit court
 
set the supersedeas bond at the amount of damages already awarded
 ($26,400), plus rental income for one year ($28,800), plus
 Respondent’s attorneys’ fees and costs incurred from the
 
6
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
initiation of litigation to the entry of final judgment. The
 
circuit court ordered Respondent’s counsel to “turn over the
 information necessary to compute the attorneys’ fees and costs
 component of the supersedeas bond.” (Capitalization omitted). 
On March 23, 2012, Respondent filed a memorandum
 
regarding the calculation of the supersedeas bond in which he
 calculated that he had incurred $38,733.50 in attorneys’ fees and
 $2,775.52 in costs. 
On March 29, 2012, Petitioners filed their notice of
 
appeal to the ICA. 
The circuit court did not enter its order awarding
 
Respondent $40,558.62 in attorneys’ fees and $968.87 in costs
 until April 27, 2012. This order also denied Petitioners’
 February 17, 2012 motion for a stay pending appeal.
 
On appeal to the ICA, Petitioners argued that the
 
circuit court had erred in (1) granting Respondent’s motion for
 summary judgment despite genuine issues of fact, (2) awarding
 damages without a valid legal or evidentiary basis, and (3)
 awarding attorneys’ fees and costs where Respondent failed to
 timely file a motion for attorneys’ fees and costs. 
In its brief SDO, the ICA concluded that Petitioners’
 
appeal was without merit and affirmed the circuit court’s orders
 granting summary judgment and final judgment in favor of
 
7
   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Respondent. Krog v. Koahou, CAAP-12-0000315, 2013 WL 2149717, at
 
*1 (App. May 17, 2013) (SDO).
 
On August 21, 2013, Petitioners filed an application
 
for writ of certiorari with this court arguing that the ICA erred
 
in affirming the circuit court’s award of damages and attorneys’
 fees and costs. 
II. DISCUSSION
 
A. The circuit court’s award of damages to Respondent was not
clearly erroneous
 
In its final judgment, the circuit court awarded
 
Respondent damages due to Petitioners’ “trespass and wrongful
 possession of the Property.” “As in other tort actions, the
 general rule is that the measure of damages in trespass actions
 is such sum as will compensate the person injured for the loss
 sustained, or for damages that have occurred or can with
 certainty be expected to occur.” 87 C.J.S. Trespass § 132 (2013)
 (footnotes omitted). Damages are calculated as “the sum
 necessary to make the victim whole,” including damages for “loss
 of use of the property.” Id.; see also Smith v. Bottomley, 30
 
Haw. 853, 858 (Haw. Terr. 1929) (“‘A wrongdoer is answerable for
 all the injurious consequences of his tortious act’ . . .
 [including] the value of the use and occupation of which the
 lessors have been wrongfully deprived.” (quoting Bergquist v.
 
8
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Kreidler, 196 N.W. 964, 965 (Minn. 1924))). Damages may also be
 
awarded in an ejectment suit “for all lost profits and damages
 allegedly sustained by the plaintiff due to the defendant’s
 wrongful possession of the property in question.” 25 Am. Jur. 2d
 Contracts § 50 (2013).
 
Upon the grant of summary judgment and the issuance of 
the writ of ejectment, Respondent was entitled to damages equal to the value of the use of the Property of which he had been deprived. The trial court’s calculation of the value of Respondent’s loss of use of the Property is a finding of fact that will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Ponce, 105 Hawai' i 445, 453, 99 P.3d 96, 104 
(2004). Findings of fact are “clearly erroneous when, despite evidence to support the finding, the appellate court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.” Id. 
The circuit court calculated damages of $2,400 for each
 
month in which Petitioners maintained possession of the Property. 
Accordingly, the court awarded Respondent $26,400 for the eleven
 months in which Petitioners had wrongfully possessed the
 Property, and additional damages calculated on a per diem basis
 of $2,400 per month until Petitioners returned possession of the
 property to Respondent. The court apparently derived this value
 
9
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
from the declarations submitted by Respondent and Petitioners. 
In his declaration, Respondent stated that a reasonable rental
 rate for the Property would be $2,500.00 per month. The
 declaration Petitioners submitted from real estate broker Neil
 Sauvage stated that “the fair monthly rental value of the
 property [was] $2,200 to $2,400 per month.”
 
The admission of opinion evidence is within the 
discretion of the trial court and will only be reversed for abuse of discretion. State v. Bermisa, 104 Hawai' i 387, 392, 90 P.3d 
1256, 1261 (2004). Opinions of lay witnesses are admissible when they are “rationally based on the perception of the witness, and . . . helpful to a clear understanding of the witness’ testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.” Hawai' i 
Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 701. This court has held that “[a]n owner, by virtue of his ownership and consequent familiarity with the land and real estate market, is generally held to be qualified to give his opinion as to the value of his land.” City 
& Cnty. of Honolulu v. Int’l Air Serv. Co., 63 Haw. 322, 332, 628 P.2d 192, 200 (1981) (holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the opinion testimony of an officer of a corporate owner because that opinion was of less probative value than that of an individual owner). 
Respondent’s evidence regarding the rental value of his
 
10
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
property was based upon his knowledge of the area and his status
 
as the owner of the Property. His opinion appears to have been
 “rationally based” on his perceptions and helpful to the court’s
 calculation of damages. Additionally, as noted by Respondent,
 the damages calculated by the circuit court actually fell within
 the range of values presented in the declaration submitted by
 Petitioners, rather than that of Respondent.
 
The circuit court’s calculation of damages, based upon
 
the declarations submitted by Respondent and Petitioners, was not
 a clearly erroneous estimation of the loss of use value suffered
 by Respondent due to Petitioners’ trespass upon his property. 
B. The circuit court erred in awarding attorneys’ fees and
costs to Respondent
 
1. Jurisdiction
 
The circuit court lacked jurisdiction to award 
Respondent attorneys’ fees subsequent to Petitioners’ filing of the notice of appeal because Respondent failed to file a motion for the award of fees. The filing of motions for the award of attorneys’ fees and costs is governed by Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(d)(2): 
Claims for attorneys’ fees and related nontaxable expenses
shall be made by motion unless the substantive law governing
the action provides for the recovery of such fees as an
element of damages to be proved at trial. . . . Unless
otherwise provided by statute or order of the court, the
motion must be filed and served no later than 14 days after
entry of an appealable order or judgment ; must specify the
judgment and the statute, rule, or other grounds entitling
 
11
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the moving party to the award; and must state the amount or
provide a fair estimate of the amount sought.
 
(Emphasis added). Additionally, pursuant to HRCP Rule 7(b), a
 
motion may be made orally during a hearing:
 
An application to the court for an order shall be by motion
which, unless made during a hearing or trial, shall be made
in writing , shall state with particularity the grounds
therefor, and shall set forth the relief or order sought.
The requirement of writing is fulfilled if the motion is
stated in a written notice of the hearing of the motion. 
(Emphasis added). 
In construing statutes or rules, “‘laws in pari 
materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall be construed with 
reference to each other.’” Aloha Care v. Ito, 126 Hawai' i 326, 
349, 271 P.3d 621, 644 (2012) (alterations omitted) (quoting HRS § 1-16 (1993)). And, “[w]hen faced with ‘a plainly irreconcilable conflict between a general and a specific statute concerning the same subject matter,’ this court invariably favors the specific.” Kinkaid v. Bd. of Review of City & Cnty. of 
Honolulu, 106 Hawai' i 318, 323, 104 P.3d 905, 910 (2004) (some 
internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Metcalf v. Vol. Emps. Ben. Ass’n of Haw., 99 Hawai' i 53, 59, 52 P.3d 823, 829 (2002)). 
Applying this principle to HRCP Rules 7(b) and 54(d)(2)(A), it is apparent that HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(A) sets specific requirements for the filing and serving of motions for attorney fees and is the controlling rule. Pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(A), a motion for attorneys’ fees must be filed and served no later than 
12
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
14 days after entry of the judgment, must specify the judgment
 
and the statute, rule, or other grounds entitling the award, and
 must state the amount or provide a fair estimate of the amount
 sought. 
In Respondent’s opposition to Petitioners’ motion for a
 
stay, and during argument, Respondent stressed that he “had not
 yet” and that he would be filing a motion for attorneys’ fees and
 costs. Respondent himself did not intend his brief
 justifications for the award of attorneys’ fees in his March 5,
 2012 memorandum in opposition to Petitioners’ motion for a stay,
 or his discussion of attorneys’ fees and costs during the March
 13, 2012 hearing, to constitute the requisite “motion” for
 attorneys’ fees and costs. Instead, Respondent was simply
 presenting arguments to justify the inclusion of attorneys’ fees
 in the calculation of a supersedeas bond. Additionally,
 Respondent’s March 23, 2012 memorandum regarding the award of
 attorneys’ fees and costs cannot constitute a motion of
 attorneys’ fees and costs because it was filed after the circuit
 court’s March 14, 2012 minute order awarding attorneys’ fees and
 costs to Respondent.
 
Respondent’s memorandum in opposition to Petitioners’
 
motion for a stay and his arguments during the March 13, 2012
 hearing also fail to meet HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(A)’s requirements
 
13
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
for a motion for attorneys’ fees and costs. Respondent’s
 
memorandum was filed four days prior to the court’s entry of
 judgment on March 9, 2012; therefore it could not identify the
 judgment on which the award was based. Respondent’s opposition
 also identified HRS § 667-33(c) as the grounds for the award and
 made no mention of assumpsit, which was the basis of the circuit
 court’s award. During the March 13, 2012 hearing, Respondent
 argued that the award of attorneys’ fees and costs was justified
 under the theory of assumpsit, but Respondent failed to “state
 the amount or provide a fair estimate of the amount sought,” as
 required under HRCP Rule 54(d)(2)(A). Respondent also failed to
 identify the judgment on which the award of attorneys’ fees and
 costs was based.
 
Because Respondent did not file a timely motion for 
attorneys’ fees and costs prior to the filing of the notice of appeal, the circuit court was without jurisdiction to enter an award of attorneys’ fees and costs subsequent to the filing of the notice of appeal. “The notice of appeal shall be deemed to appeal the disposition of all post-judgment motions that are timely filed after entry of the judgment or order.” HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). “Generally, the filing of a notice of appeal divests the [circuit] court of jurisdiction over the appealed case.” TSA 
Int’l Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai' i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 713, 
14
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
735 (1999). The circuit court only “retains jurisdiction to
 
determine matters collateral or incidental to the judgment, and
 may act in aid of the appeal.” Id. Therefore, the circuit
 
court’s April 27, 2012 order awarding attorneys’ fees and costs
 to Respondent is void for lack of jurisdiction.
 
2. Assumpsit
 Aside from the circuit court’s lack of jurisdiction to 
award Respondent attorneys’ fees and costs, the award was also erroneous because the circuit court based the award on a misapplication of the theory of assumpsit.
3 Hawai'i follows the 
American Rule, which provides that “‘each party is responsible for paying for his or her own litigation expenses’” except where “‘provided for by statute, stipulation, or agreement.’” Ranger 
Ins. Co. v. Hinshaw, 103 Hawai' i 26, 31, 79 P.3d 119, 124 (2003) 
(quoting TSA Int’l Ltd., 92 Hawai' i at 263, 990 P.2d at 734). 
While a prevailing party generally may not recover attorneys’ fees and costs for an action brought under common law tort theories, HRS § 607-14 (Supp. 2011) provides for the recovery of attorneys’ fees and costs for actions brought under the theory of assumpsit. Pursuant to HRS § 607-14, 
3
 While the question of whether the circuit court erred in awarding
 
Respondent attorneys’ fees and costs under the theory of assumpsit is moot, we
address this issue, and the applicability of HRS § 667-33(c), to assist the
trial court on remand.
 
15
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In all the courts, in all actions in the nature of
assumpsit . . . there shall be taxed as attorneys’ fees, to
be paid by the losing party and to be included in the sum
for which execution may issue, a fee that the court
determines to be reasonable; provided that the attorney
representing the prevailing party shall submit to the court
an affidavit stating the amount of time the attorney spent
on the action and the amount of time the attorney is likely
to spend to obtain a final written judgment, or, if the fee
is not based on an hourly rate, the amount of the agreed
upon fee.  The court shall then tax attorneys’ fees, which
the court determines to be reasonable, to be paid by the
losing party; provided that this amount shall not exceed
twenty-five per cent of the judgment.
 
(Emphasis added). “[F]or purposes of HRS § 607-14, the party in 
whose favor judgment was entered is the prevailing party.” Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117 Hawai' i 92, 120, 
176 P.3d 91, 121 (2008). 
Hawaii’s courts have long recognized the common law 
theories of assumpsit and tenancy at sufferance. “‘[A]ssumpsit’ is ‘a common law form of action which allows for the recovery of damages for non-performance of a contract, either express or implied, written or verbal, as well as quasi contractual obligations.’” Blair v. Ing, 96 Hawai' i 327, 332, 31 P.3d 184, 
189 (2001) (quoting TSA Int’l Ltd., 92 Hawai' i at 264, 990 P.2d 
at 734). Under the theory of tenancy at sufferance, the tenant is liable in assumpsit to pay a “fair value of the premises for use and occupation.” Lawer v. Mitts, 238 P. 654, 660 (Wyo. 1925) 
(“‘[A] tenant at sufferance, occupying by permission of the landlord, was liable, upon an implied contract, in assumpsit for use and occupation of the premises.’” (quoting Merrill v. 
16
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Bullock, 105 Mass. 486, 490 (1870))). A tenancy at sufferance is
 
created “‘[w]hen the tenant, whose term has expired by efflux of
 time, instead of quitting the premises, as he ought to do,
 remains in possession, holding over as it is called.’” 
Schimmelfennig v. Grove Farm Co., 41 Haw. 124, 134 (Haw. Terr.
 1955) (alterations in original) (quoting Decker v. Adams, 12
 N.J.L. 99, 100 (1830)). Where the tenant’s continuing occupation
 is tortious, the tort may be waived and the property owner may
 bring an action in assumpsit. See Fountain v. Mackenzie, 32 Haw.
 
45, 49 (Haw. Terr. 1931) (“The rule is firmly established that
 the tort may be waived and an action of contract brought in all
 cases where the law implies a promise on the part of the
 wrongdoer to reimburse the party injured by his act.”); see also
 Herond v. Bonsall, 140 P.2d 121, 123 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1943)
 (“An action will lie for recovery of the reasonable value of the
 use and occupation of real property irrespective of the question
 of whether or not the use thereof by the occupant was tortious or
 wrongful. In such a case the tort, if any, may be waived and an
 action based upon implied assumpsit is maintainable to recover
 the value of the use of the real property for the time of such
 occupation . . . .”)
 
While a tenancy at sufferance gives rise to an action
 
in assumpsit, courts in this and other states have recognized the
 
17
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
common law rule that, where there is no landlord tenant 
relationship, there can be no tenancy at sufferance and no action in assumpsit. See Merrill, 105 Mass. at 490 (“At common 
law . . . [if] the facts would not warrant the inference that [the tenant] ever occupied the premises by contract, express or implied, with the owner, but showed that he asserted an adverse title, he was not liable to such an action.”); Smith v. Stewart, 6 Johns. 46, 48 (N.Y. 1810) (concluding that where a buyer and seller entered into a contract for the sale of property and the buyer took possession of the property but failed to complete the purchase, the seller could bring an action for trespass and ejectment, but not for assumpsit because there was no landlord tenant relationship between the parties). In Fountain, the plaintiff brought an action for the recovery of the reasonable value of the use and occupation of a property in Honolulu. 32 Haw. at 45-46. The defendant alleged that her occupation of the property was “under a claim of right and exercised in good fath.” Id. at 46. The Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawai' i 
reasoned that an action in assumpsit could be brought only where there existed an express or implied contract. Id. at 49. The 
court stated: 
“[W]henever the action of assumpsit for use and occupation
has been allowed, it has been founded and would seem
necessarily to be founded upon contract either express or
implied.  The very term assumpsit presupposes a
 
18
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
contract. . . . To maintain the action for use and
 
occupation, therefore, there must be established the
relation of landlord and tenant, a holding by the defendant
under a knowledge of the plaintiff’s title or claim, and
under circumstances which amount to an acknowledgment of, or
acquiescence in, such title or claim, and an agreement or
permission on the part of the plaintiff.   The action will
 
not lie where the possession has been acquired and
maintained under a different or adverse title, or where it
was tortious and makes the holder a trespasser.”
 
Id. (emphasis added) (quoting Lloyd v. Hough, 42 U.S. 153, 158
 
(1843)). The court concluded that because “there was no implied
 contract on the defendant’s part to pay for the use and
 occupation of the premises” there could be no action in
 assumpsit. Id.
 
Here, Petitioners’ continuing occupation of the
 
Property after its sale to Respondent did not create a tenancy at
 sufferance. Petitioners never occupied the Property as tenants
 and there never existed a landlord tenant relationship between
 Petitioners and Respondent. Additionally, Petitioners’
 continuing occupation of the Property did not create an implied
 promise to pay Respondent for the use of the Property where
 Petitioners maintained that they were the owners of the Property.
 
Respondent brought this suit pursuant to tortious
 
trespass and sought ejectment; Respondent may not now claim that
 this is a suit in assumpsit in order to recover attorneys’ fees
 and costs. To determine whether the action is in the nature of
 assumpsit “‘this court has looked to the essential character of
 
19
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the underlying action in the trial court.’” Blair, 96 Hawai' i at 
332, 31 P.3d at 189 (quoting Leslie v. Estate of Tavares, 93 
Hawai'i 1, 5, 994 P.2d 1047, 1051 (2000)). “The character of the 
action should be determined from the facts and issues raised in the complaint, the nature of the entire grievance, and the relief sought.” Id. (quoting Helfand v. Gerson, 105 F.3d 530, 537 (9th 
Cir. 1997)). This court will determine that an action arises in assumpsit when “the actual factual allegations are such that historically the action would have been brought in assumpsit.” Leslie, 93 Hawai' i at 5, 994 P.2d at 1051 (quoting Helfand, 105 
F.3d at 537). 
Respondent’s original complaint sounded in tort,
 
alleging trespass and seeking the ejectment of Petitioners. 
Respondent stated that he was the rightful owner of the Property
 and that after he had taken possession of the Property,
 Petitioners entered and remained on the Property. Respondent did
 not claim any contractual relationship with Petitioners and
 specifically stated that “there [was] no contractual or statutory
 relationship” between Petitioners and him. This action does not
 arise from any contractual claims and therefore an award of
 attorneys’ fees and costs is not justified under the theory of
 assumpsit.

3. HRS § 667-33(c)
 
The award of attorneys’ fees and costs was also not 
justified under HRS § 667-33(c), which provides limited grounds for the award of attorneys’ fees and costs following non-judicial foreclosure sales. In 1998, Hawai' i enacted non-judicial 
foreclosure laws -- HRS chapter 667, “Foreclosure by Action or Foreclosure by Power of Sale” -- “to streamline the foreclosure process by setting up a non-judicial foreclosure system which a lender can utilize to foreclose on a property without having to file a lawsuit and obtain court supervision.” 1998 House Journal, at 365 (statement of Rep. Menor). A provision of this chapter modified the common law rules regarding tenancy at sufferance and expanded the circumstances in which a prevailing party may recover attorneys’ fees and costs: 
The mortgagor and any person claiming by, through, or under
the mortgagor and who is remaining in possession of the
mortgaged property after the recordation of the affidavit
and the conveyance document shall be considered a tenant at
sufferance  subject to eviction or ejectment.  The purchaser
may bring an action in the nature of summary possession
under chapter 666, ejectment, or trespass or may bring any
other appropriate action in a court where the mortgaged
property is located to obtain a writ of possession, a writ
of assistance, or any other relief.   In any such action, the
court shall award the prevailing party its reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs and all other reasonable fees and
costs, all of which are to be paid for by the non-prevailing
party.
 
HRS § 667-33(c) (Supp. 2011) (emphasis added). 
In interpreting a statute, this court follows
 
established rules:
 
21
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
    First, the fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself. 
Second, where the statutory language is plain and
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain
and obvious meaning.  Third, implicit in the task of
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the
language contained in the statute itself.  Fourth, when
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an
ambiguity exists.
 
Dejetley v. Kaho' ohalahala, 122 Hawai' i 251, 262, 226 P.3d 421, 
432 (2010) (quoting Rees v. Carlisle, 113 Hawai' i 446, 452, 153 
P.3d 1131, 1137 (2007)). 
Here, the plain language of the statute indicates that
 
where a mortgagor remains in possession of a property following a
 
non-judicial foreclosure sale, the “purchaser” may bring an
 action for ejectment or trespass and the prevailing party shall
 receive attorney’s fees and costs, in addition to damages. The
 term “purchaser” is undefined in HRS chapter 667. However, we
 may look to the language in other statutes upon the same subject
 matter to construe the meaning of “purchaser.” See HRS § 1-16
 
(2009). 
The first use of the term “purchaser” in HRS chapter
 
667 occurs in HRS § 667-31(a) (Supp. 2011): “After the purchaser
 completes the purchase by paying the full purchase price and the
 costs for the purchase, the mortgaged property shall be conveyed
 to the purchaser by a conveyance document.” (emphasis added). 
22
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
From this use of the term, it appears that in HRS chapter 667
 
“purchaser” refers specifically to the party who purchases the
 mortgaged property at the non-judicial foreclosure sale. 
Therefore, HRS § 667-33(c) permits to party who purchases a
 property at a non-judicial foreclosure sale to collect attorneys’
 fees and costs after prevailing in an ejectment or trespass
 action.
 
While HRS § 667-33(c) provides for the original
 
purchaser of a property to collect attorneys’ fees in an
 ejectment or trespass action, it is inconsistent with the
 legislative purpose of this statute to extend the attorneys’ fees
 provision to all subsequent purchasers. The purposes of
 simplifying and expediting the foreclosure process are not
 furthered by permitting any purchaser to collect otherwise
 unrecoverable attorneys’ fees and costs from a trespasser, if the
 trespasser was formerly a mortgagor of the property, dispossessed
 through the non-judicial foreclosure process. 
Applying HRS § 667-33(c) to this case, it appears that
 
had the original purchaser of the Property (Scott Kim) prevailed
 in a suit for trespass and ejectment against Petitioners, Kim
 would been entitled to the recovery of attorneys’ fees and costs. 
However, HRS § 667-33(c) is not directly applicable to the
 present situation in which Respondent, a third-party purchaser
 
23
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
having no direct relationship to Petitioners, prevailed in a suit
 
for trespass and ejectment. Therefore, HRS § 667-33(c) does not
 provide a statutory basis for the circuit court’s award of
 attorneys’ fees and cost.
 
III. Conclusion
 
The circuit court lacked jurisdiction to award
 
Respondent attorneys’ fees and costs and, furthermore, there was
 no legal justification for the award of attorneys’ fees and
 costs. The supersedeas bond set by the circuit court was also
 erroneous in that it included the attorneys’ fees and costs the
 circuit court awarded Respondent. Accordingly, we vacate the
 circuit court’s award of attorneys’ fees and costs and the
 circuit court’s order regarding the supersedeas bond and we
 remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings.
