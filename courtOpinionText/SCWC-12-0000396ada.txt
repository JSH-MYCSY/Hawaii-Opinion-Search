CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

(CAAP-12-0000396; CR. NO. 10-1-0819)

December 24, 2013

RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, ACOBA, McKENNA, AND POLLACK, JJ.

OPINION OF THE COURT BY ACOBA, J.

We hold, first, that proof that any part of an offense

occurred on the island of Oahu is sufficient to establish venue

in the first judicial circuit. 
Here, because several witnesses
 
testified that the alleged Kidnapping committed by Petitioner/

Defendant-Appellant Bladesin-Isaiah Bailey (Petitioner) occurred

on the island of Oahu, there was sufficient evidence to

demonstrate that the first judicial circuit was the correct

venue.

        
        
   
         
     
   
       
       
    
         
          
      
      
       
 
            
            
          
             
            
   
          
            
           
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Second, we hold that Respondent-Plaintiff/Appellee 
 
State of Hawai' i (the State) must prove beyond a reasonable doubt 
that substantial bodily injury was caused by the defendant in

order to disprove the mitigating defense that reduces the offense

of Kidnapping, Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-720(3) (Supp. 
2008) 
1  , from a Class A felony2 to a Class B felony,3
 because,
 
inter alia, the victim was not suffering from substantial bodily

injury when released. 
 
Third, we hold that the State must only disprove one of

the three elements of the Class B mitigating defense set forth in

HRS § 707-702(3) beyond a reasonable doubt to establish that a

defendant is not entitled to the defense. In other words, the

1 HRS § 707-720 provides in relevant part as follows:
 
§ 707-720 Kidnapping.
 
(1) 
A 
person commits the offense of kidnapping if the
person intentionally or knowingly restrains another
person with intent to:
 
. . .
  
(
e) T
errorize that person or a third person;
 
. . . .
 
(
2) Except as provided in subsection (3), kidnapping
is a class A felony.
(3) In a prosecution for kidnapping, it is a defense
which reduces the offense to a class B felony that the
defendant voluntarily released the victim, alive and
not suffering from serious or substantial bodily
injury, in a safe place prior to trial.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
2

Kidnapping is a Class A felony. HRS § 707-720(2). The court 
ordinarily must sentence a defendant convicted of a Class A felony to amaximum length of imprisonment of twenty years, without the possibility ofsuspension of sentence or probation. HRS § 706-659 (Supp. 1994). The minimum length of imprisonment is to be determined by the Hawai 'i Paroling Authority. 
Id. 
3

A defendant convicted of a Class B felony ordinarily must be 
sentenced to a maximum length of imprisonment of ten years, with the minimumlength of imprisonment to be determined by the Hawai 'i paroling authority. 
HRS § 706-660 (1993). 
2

        
         
     
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
State must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant

did not voluntarily release the victim, or that the defendant

caused serious or substantial bodily injury to the victim, or

that the victim was not released in a safe place. In this case,
 
Petitioner did not challenge the jury’s special interrogatories

finding that the victim was not voluntarily released, and that

the victim was not released in a safe place. Hence, Petitioner
 
was not entitled to the Class B mitigating defense.

For the reasons stated herein, the August 21, 2013

4
Judgment of the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA)  filed
 
pursuant to its July 10, 2013 Summary Disposition Order (SDO),

and the March 19, 2012 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence of the

5
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (the court)  are affirmed. 
 
I. 
 A. 
 
On the morning of May 15, 2010, Ezra Kualaau,

(Complainant) contacted Andrew Rodriguez (Rodriguez) through

several text messages and phone calls, to buy crack cocaine. 
 After picking up Petitioner, the two defendants headed to

Complainant’s house in a white “Chevy” Impala. 
Complainant,
 
wearing basketball shorts and no shirt or shoes, joined

Petitioner and Rodriguez at a park across the street from his

house. Complainant and his mother testified that their house was 
located on Ka' ahumanu Street in Waiau, on the island of O' ahu. 
Rodriguez sat in the driver’s seat, Petitioner in the

front passenger’s seat, and Complainant in the back seat. After

noticing a police car pass by, Petitioner and Rodriguez “looked

at each other and then Petitioner went to the trunk.” 
 Complainant then started “getting punched[,]” and “whacked on the

side of [his] head in [his] temple and then phased out.” After

getting punched the first time by Petitioner, Complainant

testified that he fell onto his left side, at which time

Petitioner continued to punch him a couple of more times. 
 Rodriguez then got out of the car and handcuffed Complainant

behind his back. Petitioner “grabbed [Complainant] at [his]

ankles . . . and they took [him] to the trunk.” They closed the
 
trunk with Complainant inside and drove off.

Two witnesses, Renante Lagat (Renante) and his wife

Melva Lagat (Melva), were driving on Komo Mai Drive past the

Waiau Park and noticed a white car by itself and “saw two guys

put an individual in the car[,]” with his hands “bound” at his

back. The individual “being thrown into the trunk of the car”

was “[a] white male, fairly skinny” with “no shirt.” Renante

testified that “one of . . . the ones putting the person in the

car” was “wearing a red shirt.” Honolulu Police Department
 
Officer Donn Manzano (Officer Manzano) also testified that he was

patrolling the Pearl City area near Komo Mai Drive on the island 
 
4

        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of Oahu when he noticed a white vehicle in the parking lot of

Waiau District Park.

While in the trunk, Complainant managed to remove his

cell phone from his pocket, and texted his mother to tell her

that he had been kidnapped. Complainant also called 911. At the

end of a cul-de-sac street, the car stopped and the defendants

took Complainant out of the trunk. A plastic bag and cloth were
 
put over Complainant’s head.

Complainant testified that after pulling him out of the

trunk, the two defendants proceeded to walk him up a trail, “or

not a trail, but bushes[,]” during which he was “pushed over

rocks, through bushes.” Complainant further related that
 
Petitioner threatened that Complainant was not to “make noise or

I’m gonna put -- or I’m gonna shoot you.” At the top of the
 
trail, Petitioner and Rodriguez “sat [him] down and started

punching [him] in the face” “multiple times” while the bag was

still over Complainant’s head, and he was still handcuffed behind

[his] back. They then “shoved [Complainant] to the ground[,] 
 . . . ripped the bag off [his] face and ran off.” Complainant,
 
after hearing the car door slam, ran back down the trail to get

help. 
 
Officer Halama Wong (Officer Wong) was patrolling the 
Moanalua Valley area of Oahu when she was dispatched to Onipa' a 
Street, where Complainant had made a call to the police from a nearby house. When Officer Wong arrived, Complainant was handcuffed and crying, with “abrasions” on his face, chest, and 
5

        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
back, as well as what appeared to be a swollen nose. According
 
to Officer Wong, Complainant appeared frightened, and “had a hard

time speaking.”

Complainant was taken to Kaiser Moanalua Emergency Room

by his mother, where he was examined by Dr. Saba Russell (Dr.

Russell). During the examination, Dr. Russell observed “multiple
 
contusions and abrasion throughout [Complainant’s] extremities,

the arms and legs, as well as the face.” She also found that he

had suffered a nasal bone fracture. The age of the fracture was

indeterminable based on the X-ray. However, Dr. Russell opined
 
that the swelling and bruising over the cheek and nose were

consistent with characteristics of a new fracture.

While Complainant was being examined for his injuries, 
Officer Tay Deering (Officer Deering) was dispatched to a possible Kidnapping at Waiau District Park on the island of O'ahu, but, on the way, observed and stopped a white “Impala” on 
Salt Lake Boulevard. Officer Legaee Fatu (Officer Fatu), who was with Officer Deering at the time, identified Petitioner as the passenger in the car and noticed that he was wearing a red shirt. Officer Deering identified Rodriguez as the driver of the car. Both Officer Fatu and Officer Deering testified that neither Rodriguez nor Petitioner appeared to have any injuries, and neither complained of having any. 
B.

The State indicted Petitioner and Rodriguez on May 20,

2010 on one count of Kidnapping (Count I) and one count of

 Assault in the Second Degree (Count II):
 
COUNT  I:   On  or  about  the  15th  day  of  May,  2010,  in  the  City
and  County  of  Honolulu,  State  of  Hawai'i,  [Rodriguez]  and
[Petitioner],  did  intentionally  or  knowingly  restrain
[Complainant],  with  intent  to  terrorize  him,  .  .  .  thereby
committing  the  offense  of  Kidnapping ,  in  violation  of
Section      .  .  .  707-720(1)(e)  of  the  [HRS]. 
COUNT  II:   On  or  about  the  15th  day  of  May,  2010,  in  the
City  and  County  of  Honolulu,  State  of  Hawai'i,  [Rodriguez]
and  [Petitioner]  did  intentionally  or  knowingly  cause
substantial  bodily  injury  to  [Complainant],  and/or  did
recklessly  cause  substantial  bodily  injury  to  [Complainant],
thereby  committing  the  offense  of  Assault  in  the  Second
Degree,  in  violation  of  Section  707-711(1)(a)  and/or  Section
707-711(b)  of  the  [HRS]. 
(Emphases added.) Trial began on January 6, 2012. The witnesses

called in the State’s case were Complainant, Complainant’s

mother, Renante, Melva, Dr. Russell, and Officers Fatu, Deering,

Wong, and Manzano.

At the close of the State’s case, Petitioner moved the

court for a judgement of acquittal. His argument was that the
 
State failed to prove venue. The court denied Petitioner’s

motion. The following discussion occurred:

[Mr.  Luiz  (Counsel  for  Petitioner)]:    Actually,  the
 
State  never  proved  venue  in  this  case.   Not  one  witness  from
 
the  beginning  to  the  end  ever  testified  that  this  occurred
in  the  City  and  County  of  Honolulu.   No  witness  was  asked
 
that.   As  a  matter  of  fact,  I  kept  track  of  all  the
witnesses  who  testified  and  each  officer  who  testified  was
 
never  asked  if  this  occurred  in  the  City  and  County  of
Honolulu  .  .  .  and  because  venue  is  absolutely  essential
that  must  be  proven  that  this  did  in  fact  occur  in  the  City
and  County  of  Honolulu  and  not  the  County  of  Maui,  the
 
6

HRS § 707-711 (provides in relevant part as follows:
 
§ 707-711 Assault in the second degree.
 
(1) A person commits the offense of assault in the second
degree if:
(a) The person intentionally or knowingly causes substantial
bodily injury to another;
(b) 
T
he person recklessly causes serious or substantial
bodily injury to another;

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
County of Big Island. We [are] entitled to a directed
verdict on all counts since the State rested without proving
venue.

THE COURT: You know, my notes show that venue was–the
venue question was asked of [Complainant] regarding him
being in front of his house. And in addition, the venue
question was asked of Officer Manzano regarding the Waiau
District Park. I’m going to look at the evidence in light
more favorable to the Government. I can take judicial
notice, I think, of venue, and I do so. But looking at the
evidence in the light most favorable to the Government and
considering the jury’s right to weigh credibility and draw
all reasonable inferences of fact I believe a reasonable
 
juror can conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to
Kidnapping and the Assault II with regard to [Petitioner]
 
. . . .
 
THE COURT: Let me just note that I’m looking at my
notes  with  regard  to  the  venue  issue.   The  venue  question
was  asked  of  Officer  []  Wong  as  to  Onipa'a  Street  where 
[Complainant]  was  allegedly  found  .  .  .  I  think  there’s  a
reasonable  inference  that  that  car  never  left  this  island,
so venue was established. Okay. All right . . .
[Mr.  Luiz]:  .  .  .
 I never heard the question on City
and County of Honolulu, I heard–
THE  COURT:  W
ell, it just has to be this island .

(Emphases added.)

While Petitioner exercised his right not to testify,

Rodriguez did testify. Rodriguez recounted that Complainant
 
contacted him to buy drugs, but that he and Petitioner met

Complainant in order to retrieve money that a friend claimed

Complainant stole from her. Rodriguez admitted to handcuffing
 
Complainant, putting him in the trunk, as well as driving to

Moanalua with Complainant in the trunk of the car, because

“that’s where [Complainant] said the person who was holding the

money was at.” Moreover, Rodriguez testified that when he
 
stopped the car and opened the trunk, Complainant jumped out of

the trunk and ran into some neighbors’ yard; Rodriguez also

stated that at that point, he drove away. Rodriguez claimed that
 
he did not place a bag over Complainant’s head and he did not

walk Complainant up a trail.

The court instructed the jury in relevant part as

follows:

In  Count  1,  [Petitioner]  is  charged  with  the  offense  of
Kidnapping.
 
. . . .
 
The
re  are  three  material  element  of  the  offense  of
 
[K]idnapping,  each  of  which  the  prosecution  must  prove
beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.
 
. . . .
 
1.   That,  o n  or  about  May  15,  2010,  in  the  City  and
County  of  Honolulu,  State  of  Hawai'i,  [Petitioner] 
restrained  [Complainant];  and
2.   That  [ Petitioner]  did  so  intentionally  or
knowingly;  and
3.   That  [ Petitioner]  did  so  with  the  intent  to
terrorize  [Complainant].
 
In  Count  2,  [Petitioner]  is  charged  with  the  offense  of
Assault  in  the  Second  Degree.
 
. . . .
 
Th
ere  are  two  material  elements  of  the  offense  of  Assault  in
 
the  Second  Degree,  each  of  which  the  prosecution  must  prove
beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.
1. Th
at, on or about May 15, 2010, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawai 'i, [Petitioner] caused 
substantial bodily injury [ 7
] to [Complainant]; and
2. Th
at [Petitioner] did so intentionally, knowingly,
or recklessly.
 
As to the lesser included offense of Assault in the Third Degree,

the court instructed the jury, in part, as follows:

In  Count  2,  as  to  [Petitioner],  if,  and  only  if,  you  find
[Petitioner][]  not  guilty  of  Assault  in  the  Second  Degree,
or  you  are  unable  to  reach  a  unanimous  verdict  as  to  this
offense,  then  you  must  consider  whether  [Petitioner]  is
guilty  or  not  guilty  of  the  included  offense  of  Assault  in
the  Third  Degree.
A p
erson commits the offense of Assault in the Third Degree
if he intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes bodily
injury to another person.
There  are  two  material  elements  of  the  offense  of  Assault  in

“Substantial bodily injury” is defined as bodily injury which
 
causes “(1) A major avulsion, laceration, or penetration of the skin; (2) A
burn of at least second degree severity; (3) A bone fracture; (4) A serious
concussion; or (5) A tearing, rupture, or corrosive damage to the esophagus,
viscera, or other internal organs.” HRS § 707-700 (Supp. 2008).

       ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the Third Degree, [ 8
] each of which the prosecution must prove
be
yond a reasonable doubt.
 
. . . .
 
1. T
ha
t, on or about May 15, 2010, in the City and
County of Honolulu, State of Hawai 'i, [Petitioner] caused 
9
[ ] bodily  i njury  
2. That [Petitioner] did so intentionally, knowingly,
or recklessly.
 
As to accomplice liability, the court’s instructions

stated in relevant part as follows:

A defendant charged with committing an offense may be
guilty because he is an accomplice of another person in the
commission of the offense . The prosecution must prove
accomplice liability beyond a reasonable doubt.
A person is an accomplice of another in the commission
of an offense if, with the intent to promote or facilitate
the commission of the offense, he aids or agrees or attempts
to aid the other person in the planning or commission of the
offense.
 
Mere presence at the scene of an offense or knowledge
that an offense is being committed, without more, does not
make a person an accomplice to the offense. However, if a
person plans or participates in the commission of an offense
with the intent to promote or facilitate the offense, he is
an accomplice to the commission of the offense.
 
(Emphases added.)

D.

In his closing argument, the prosecutor asserted that

Complainant suffered substantial bodily injury when the punches

to his face fractured his nose:

[The prosecutor]: There’s [] no dispute that [Complainant] 
was found on Onipa 'a Street still handcuffed, Officer Wong 
told you that. [Complainant] was crying. He had scratches 
8		HRS § 707-712 provides in relevant part as follows:
 
Assault in the third degree.
 
(1) A person commits the offense of assault in the third
degree if the person:
(a)	 	
I
ntentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes
bodily injury to another person; or
 
. . . .
 
(
2) Assault in the third degree is a misdemeanor unless
committed in a fight or scuffle entered into by mutual
consent, in which case it is a petty misdemeanor.
 
9

“Bodily injury” is defined as “physical pain, illness, or any
 
impairment of physical condition.” HRS § 707-700.
 
10

        
          
           
   
 
     
        
        
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
and cuts, not only to his facial area which corroborated the
punches that he got but also to his body and the shoulder
and the body area.
 
What’s  also  undisputed  is  that  this  is  how
[Complainant]  looked  when  he  was  found  on  Onipa'a  Street  with 
a  swollen  nose,  the  scratches  and  cuts  on  his  face  as  well
as  the  swollen  wrist  where  Officer  Wong  told  you  that's  the
result  after  he  took  off  the  handcuffs  from  [Complainant]  on
Onipa'a  Street. 
There’s  also  no  dispute  that  he  did  suffer  the
substantial  bodily  injury.   Doctor  told  you  that  there  was  a
bone  fracture;  that  that  bone  fracture  was  consistent  with
the  swollen  nose  injury  that  she  observed  on  [Complainant]
on  May  15th,  2010.
 
After  reading  the  x-ray,  she  told  you  that  it  was  a
nasal  bone  fracture.   Although,  as  she  testified,  because  of
the  nature  of  the  fracture  on  the  nasal  bone  she  couldn't
 
tell  exactly  when  that  bone  was  broken.   [Complainant]  told
 
you  that  he  had  no  prior  broken  nose.   So  based  on  all  of
 
that  there’s  a  reasonable  inference  that  that  fracture,  the
nasal  bone  fracture  was  a  result  of  what  happened  on  May
15th,  2010.
 
 
[Complainant] also sustained consistent injuries. The
 
pictures that they took on May 15th, 2010 corroborate
[Complainant’s] statement that he was punched to the face,
mostly to the face .

. . . .

(Emphases added.)

The prosecutor also asserted that Petitioner and

Rodriguez had not met the requirements for the mitigating defense

that would reduce the Kidnapping charge to a Class B felony:

As  to  the  interrogatories  that  you  have  to  answer,
there  are  questions  about  the  release  -- in  the  shape  and
the  form  that  [Complainant]  was  released  by  the  defendant.
  
First,  is  whether  it  was  voluntary.    And,  frankly,  given  the
state  of  the  evidence  on  the  credible  evidence,  yeah,  they
did  let  him  go  in  that  it's  not  like  the  police  had  to  come
and  release  the  trunk  and  let  [Complainant]  out  or  anything
like  that,  okay.   So,  for  what  it's  worth,  it  is  not  in  that
 
kind  of  situation.   So  was  he  released  voluntarily?  Okay,
 
questionable,  but  -- but  as  to  whether  he  was  released  alive
 
"and"  not  suffering  from  serious  or  substantially  bodily
injury.   Now  there's  an  "and"  which  means  that  he  had  to  had
 
not  suffered  any  serious  or  substantial  bodily  injury.   And
 
the  substantial  bodily  injury  we  had  talked  about  is  the
Assault  2,  the  bone  fracture.
 
Also,  safe  place.  Is  releasing  [Complainant]  where  now
we  know  it’s  on  top  of  Onipa'a  Street.   At  this  point,  based 
11

        
           
         
          
          
              
           
           
            
           
            
            
           
         
           
       
        
            
         
     
. . . .
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
on the evidence, we know that it’s near a residential area.But at the time that [Complainant] was released, face downright after having his bag and the cloth taken off, afterhe’s been pushed up the hill, anywhere between 5 to 15minutes -- he told you on the stand it was 5. He might have told, at a prior proceeding, 15 minutes. Is that a safe place where he doesn’t know where to come out? There’s no path. In fact, he goes the other way because he thinks thatthe defendants are gonna come back up the way they came -­they left. State will submit to you that it’s not a safeplace that he was released at. It was not like he was 
released at a hospital, back at his house, back at the WaiauDistrict Park, back at the police station. So State wouldsubmit to you that where he was released is not a safeplace. It’s just that [Complainant], throughout thiskidnapping, throughout this event on May 15th, 2010, wasthinking . . . even when he was released it was his own
thinking, quick thinking that got him out of that secludedarea and down to Onipa 'a Street . 
(Emphases added.)

In his closing argument, Mr. Hawk, counsel for

Rodriguez, asserted that the jury should reduce the Kidnapping

charge to a Class B felony:

[Mr.  Hawk]:  Was  he  voluntarily  released?   Absolutely.   He  ran 
away.   Was  there  serious  bodily  injury?   There’s  no  fracture,  so
there’s  no  serious  or  substantial  bodily  injury.   And  is  Onipa'a 
Street  a  safe  place?   I  would  think  so.   I  mean,  there  was  no 
evidence  that  it  was  a  dangerous  place.   It’s  not  like  he  was 
released  in  the  middle  of  the  ocean  or  in  the  middle  of  the  night
in  some  war  zone.   I  mean,  it’s  just  a  residential  area.   There’s 
nothing  that’s  dangerous  about  that  place. 
Mr. Hawk also maintained that because there was not

proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the fracture was suffered

during the Kidnapping, Rodriguez was only guilty of assault in

the third degree:

What  else  did  he  do?   Well,  he  was  there  when  [Petitioner]  got
 
slapped,  right?   He  admitted  - - not  when  [Petitioner]  got  slapped
but  when  [Petitioner]  slapped  [Complainant].   So  he’s  an
 
accomplice  to  that  slap.   That’s  Assault  in  the  Third  Degree.
  
Slapping  someone  in  the  face  causes  pain,  which  is  bodily  injury,
so  he’s  guilty  of  Assault  in  the  Third  Degree  and  not  guilty  of
Assault  in  the  Second  Degree  because  there’s  no  fracture.

       ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Mr. Luiz, counsel for Petitioner, argued that the jury

should acquit Petitioner of Kidnapping and Assault in the Second

Degree but convict him of Unlawful Imprisonment in the Second

Degree and Assault in the Third Degree. As to the substantial

bodily injury, Mr. Luiz asserted that Dr. Russell did not testify

as to when Complainant fractured his nose and therefore

“[t]here’s no proof beyond a reasonable doubt that [Complainant]

sustained a fracture while he was with [Petitioner].” 
 
Finally, apparently in response to the State’s argument

regarding reducing the Kidnapping offense to a Class B felony,

Mr. Luiz stated that:

They released [Complainant]. He was safe, residential area.
They didn’t drop him off anywhere where he could be hurt.
He just ran to a house and asked for more help from there.
He was released unharmed, and he didn’t have any substantial
bodily injuries.
 
In her rebuttal argument, the prosecutor argued that

Complainant’s testimony that he had not previously broken his

nose demonstrated that the bone fracture resulted from

“[Rodriguez] and [Petitioner] hitting [Complainant] in the face”:

[The  prosecutor]:   [Dr.  R ussell]  saw  injuries  that  are  consistent
with  what  would  have  cause  a  bone  fracture  on  May  15 th
,  2010;  that
they  were  swollen.
 
An
d what did [Complainant] tell you? I’ve never broken my nose.
 
I’ve never had a broken nose. So based on all of that what’s the
 
reasonable inference? That bone fracture happened as a result of
[Rodriguez] and [Petitioner] hitting [Complainant] in the face.
 
(Emphasis added.)

On January 11, 2012, the jury found Petitioner and

Rodriguez guilty as charged of Kidnapping and guilty of the

F.

On January 20, 2012 Petitioner filed a motion for

judgment of acquittal concerning the following issues: (1) “[t]he

State did not properly prove venue in this case. The [i]sland of
 
Oahu was merely mentioned by a police officer. [No] witness

14

        
       
 
          
           
     
      
       
        
         
          
        
          
          
        
          
        
       
        
         
        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
state[d] that any of what they testified to occurred in the City

and County of Honolulu[,]” and (2) “[t]he Class A felony

[Kidnapping] should be reduced to Class B Kidnapping” because “it

is undisputable [sic] that . . . Complainant was released from

the trunk by Rodriguez without serious or substantial injury as

shown by the jury acquitting [him] of Assault in the second

degree . . . .” 
 
During a hearing on the motion for judgment of

acquittal, Petitioner argued that the jury verdicts were

inconsistent, and repeated his argument that the State failed to

prove venue. Before denying Petitioner’s motion, the following

discussion between the Court and counsel for Petitioner occurred:

[Mr.  Luiz]: And I really believe that’s an inconsistent
v
erdict, Your Honor . . . You can’t find–they’re all part of
the same crime, it was all the same time frame, the same
happening. And we have an inconsistency.”
 
THE  COURT:  
Well, not necessarily because there’s another
possibility you folks haven’t discussed. T
he possibility is
that they found substantial bodily injury, the broken nose,
beyond a reasonable doubt but they weren’t sure who actually
broke that nose. Because both of there were, you know, the
testimony was that both of these gentlemen were hitting
[Complainant] at the end, you know, by the rock, where the
nose apparently was broken. And so the jury could have found
there was substantial bodily injury but they didn’t know
which of the two . . .had actually done the deed.
The  Kidnapping  question  is  do  you  believe  that  the
prosecution  has  proven  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that
[Petitioner]  voluntarily  released  the  victim  alive  and  not
suffering  from  substantial  bodily  injury  in  a  safe  place
prior  to  trial  .  .  .  it  doesn’t  call  for  determination  of
which  defendant,  you  know,  broke  the  nose,  it  calls  for  the
defendant  having  left  the  complaining  witness  there  with  a
broken  nose,  a  broken  bone  .  .  .  I  don’t  think  the  verdicts
are  necessarily  inconsistent  so  I  would  have  to  disagree
with  you  there.
 
[Mr.  Luiz]:  Well, if they couldn’t agree on who did the
crime, then that would necessarily acquit both clients
because you can’t prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
 
THE COURT: No but they--they found that each client was
proven beyond a reasonable doubt to have caused physical
 
15

        
         
          
          ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
pain and that’s why they convicted these two gentlemen for
Assault 3. It’s a very interesting verdict. Actually it
may well have been a very intelligent jury. I mean, you
know.
 
(Emphases added.)

With regard to the venue issue, Mr. Luiz insisted that

the prosecution had to establish the incident occurred in “[t]he

City and County of Honolulu” in order to prove venue. The court

stated the following:

THE  COURT:  T he  statutes  say  that  the  prosecution  has  to
prove  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  facts  supporting  venue.  And
venue  of  course  is  on  this  island  of  Oahu  .   .  .  venue  was 
testified  to  by  witnesses  for  the  Waiau  District  Park,  the
complaining  witness’s  home,  and  finally,  Onipa'a  Street 
where  the  complaining  witness  was  eventually  found.  
And  t he  testimony  is  undisputed  that  all  other  times  he  was
in  the  car  trunk  and  they  were  driving  on  roads,  like  they
never  went  on  a  boat,  they  never  went  on  a  plane.  So  can  I,
should  I,  you  know,  find  that  the  government  did  not  prove
facts  supporting  venue  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  on  that
evidence?  I  don’t  think  I  can.
 
On March 19, 2012, Petitioner and Rodriguez were each

sentenced as young adult defendants to an eight-year term of

imprisonment for Kidnapping and a one-year term of imprisonment

for the Assault in the Third Degree. Petitioner appealed.
 
On August 21, 2013 the ICA affirmed the convictions. 
 
II.

In his Application, Petitioner asks whether the

judgments of the ICA and the court should be vacated because (1)

there was a “lack of substantial evidence regarding venue in the

City and County of Honolulu;” and (2) “the verdict was

inconsistent [because] [Petitioner] was not found guilty of

assault in the second degree” but instead was found guilty of the

lesser included offense of assault in the third degree, but

16

        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
nevertheless “was found guilty of Class A felony [K]idnapping.” 
 
A Response was filed on October 2, 2013. No Reply was filed. 
 
III.

With respect to the first question, the ICA observed

that HRS § 603-1 (Supp. 1994) states that “[t]he State is divided

into four judicial circuits . . . and that [t]he first judicial

circuit is the island of Oahu[,]” and that “the Revised Charter

of the City and County of Honolulu (RCCCH) § 1-102 (2000)”

indicates “that the City and County of Honolulu encompasses the

island of Oahu.” State v. Bailey, CAAP-12-0000396, 2013 WL

3776169, at *1 (Haw. App. July 10, 2013) (SDO). The ICA stated

that Petitioner “fails to point to any legal authority . . . that

the phrase ‘City and County of Honolulu’ must be used . . . and

that venue is not established by using the phrase ‘island of

Oahu[.]’” Id. The ICA further held that there was “testimony at

trial . . . establishing that the events took place on . . .

Oahu[,]” and the court “took judicial notice of venue when it

noted that the geographic areas described in various testimony

were all on the island of Oahu[.]” Id. Accordingly, the ICA

concluded that “[v]iewing the evidence in the strongest light for

the prosecution, sufficient evidence was adduced . . . that the

offense took place on . . . Oahu, thus establishing venue beyond

a reasonable doubt.” Id. at *2.

With respect to the second question, Petitioner argued

that “[Complainant] was released from the trunk . . . without

serious or substantial injury[,]” thus Petitioner “is guilty only

17

        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of a [C]lass B Kidnapping felony.” Id. The ICA countered that,

as the court noted, “the jury could have concluded that:

[Complainant] had suffered ‘substantial bodily injury’ (i.e. a

broken nose)[,]” “a jury could find that a person suffered

‘substantial bodily injury,’ even though the jury could not

determine who caused that ‘substantial bodily injury[,]’” and

“the State had not . . . [proven] who caused the broken nose[,]”

but Petitioner “caused lesser ‘bodily injury’ for purposes of the

offense of Assault in the Third Degree.” Id. (emphases

omitted). Accordingly, the ICA concluded thus “there was
 
sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Complainant’s

nose was broken and thus, he suffered ‘substantial bodily

injury.’” Id. at *3. Further, the ICA observed “the jury

rejected [Petitioner’s] argument . . . that the offense should be

reduced to a Class B felony Kidnapping offense . . . [in its

answers to the] . . . special interrogatories[.]” Id.

IV.

In connection with the first question, Petitioner 
maintains that (1) “HRS § 701-114[(1)(d)] [(1993)] provides in relevant part . . . [that] no person may be convicted of an offense unless [facts establishing venue] . . . are proven beyond a reasonable doubt,” (2) “[Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP)] Rule 18, [in part] provides: . . . the prosecution shall be had in the circuit in which the offense or any part of it was committed,” (3) “proof that an event occurred in the City and

           ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
County of Honolulu is proof that it occurred within the first

judicial circuit,” and (4) “[t]he [i]sland of Oahu was merely

mentioned by a police officer” and not “a single witness state[d]

that any of what they [sic] testified to occurred within the

venue of the City and County of Honolulu.” With respect to the
 
ICA’s decision, he maintains that (1) “State v. Puaoi, 78 Haw.

185, 190[, 891 P.2d 272, 277] ([]1995)[,] . . . is

distinguishable because in that case it was the prosecutor who

specifically requested judicial notice of facts establishing

venue, not the court sua sponte taking judicial notice of facts

establishing venue[,]” and (2) “[i]n the absence of proof of

venue, ‘the innocence of the defendant is presumed.’ [(Citing]

HRS § 701-114(2)[ and] State v. Black, 66 Haw. 530, 668 P.2d 32

(1983) (prosecution’s failure to prove venue resulted in

defendant’s acquittal)[)].”
10
 
V.

Under HRPP Rule 18, “the prosecution shall be had in

the circuit in which the offense or any part of it was

committed.” (Emphasis added.) Thus, to establish venue, it must
 
be proven that “any part” of the offense occurred in the circuit

10

In its Answering Brief, the State asserted that the testimony from 
five different witnesses proved that the offenses occurred on the island of
Oahu. The State also contended that the ICA could “take judicial notice that the locations testified to - Kaahumanu Street in Waiau, Waiau District Park,Waiau Fire Station, Komo Mai Drive in Pearl City, Onipaa Street in the SaltLake-Moanalua Valley area, Kaiser Moanalua Emergency Room, and Salt LakeBoulevard - collectively, are located on the island of Oahu, and in the firstjudicial circuit.” (Citing Puaoi, 78 Hawai 'i at 190, 891 P.2d at 277.) In 
its Response, the State asserted that because Petitioner “reiterates his argument [before the ICA], [the State] relies on its answering brief.”

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
in which the case is tried. 11
 
Pursuant to HRS § 701-114(1)(d) , 
“no person may be convicted of an offense unless . . . [venue is] 
proved beyond a reasonable doubt[.]” A defendant may move for a judgment of acquittal “on the grounds that the prosecution has not proved the necessary element of venue.” State v. Kwak, 80 
Hawai'i 297, 305, 909 P.2d 1112, 1120 (1995); see also State v. 
Miyashiro, 3 Haw. App. 229, 232-33, 647 P.2d 302, 304-05 (1982). 
“The standard to be applied by the trial court in 
ruling upon a motion for a judgment of acquittal is whether, upon the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution and in full recognition of the province of the [trier of fact], a reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” State v. Pone, 78 Hawai' i 262, 265, 892 P.2d 
455, 458 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). “An appellate court employs the same standard of review.” Id. 
This case was tried in the first judicial circuit. 
“The first judicial circuit covers the [i]sland of O' ahu, all 
other islands belonging to the state (other than Maui, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, Molokini, Hawai' i, Kauai, and Niihau) . . . .” 
State v. Correa, 5 Haw. App. 644, 650, 706 P.2d 1321, 1325 (1985) 
11

HRS § 701-114(1)(d) provides in relevant part as follows:
 
§ 701-114 Proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
 
(1) Except as otherwise provided in section 701-115, no
person may be convicted of an offense unless the following
are proved beyond a reasonable doubt :

. . .
 
(d) Facts establishing venue [.]
 
(Emphases added.)
 
20

        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(citing HRS § 603-1(1)). “Consequently, proof that an event 
occurred . . . on the [i]sland of O' ahu is proof that it occurred 
within the first judicial circuit.” Id. Here, viewed in the 
light most favorable to the State, a reasonable mind could “fairly conclude” that the offense occurred on the island of O'ahu beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Complainant indicated that he first met the defendants 
in front of his house “on Kaahumanu Street,” “on the island of Oahu[.]” Complainant related that after meeting the defendants, they went to the park that was “directly across the street” from his house. Officer Deering stated that the park was in the same area as Ka' ahumanu Street “on the island of Oahu.” Similarly, 
Officer Manzano testified that the park was near the Waiau Fire Station, and the Fire Station was “on the island of Oahu.” 
At the park, the defendants “whacked [Complainant] on 
the side of [his] head,” handcuffed him, and put him in the trunk of their car. The defendants drove with Complainant in the trunk for “about an hour.” The defendants removed Complainant from their car and took him to a spot on a hill, and then left. Complainant then went down the road to an “old man’s house and asked him to call the police.” Officer Wong then interviewed Complainant. Officer Wong stated that the address of the house was “1720 Onipa' a Street,” and the house was “on the [i]sland of 
Oahu.” 
Based on the foregoing, the evidence adduced at trial

demonstrates that the offense, or at least a “part of it,” see

21

        
          
          
              
          
             
  
          
           
                
              
               
             
           
            
               
     
          
          
             
           
           
                
            
      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
HRPP Rule 18, occurred on the island of O' ahu. The witnesses’ 
testimony indicates that the offense both began and ended on the

island of O' ahu. Moreover, as stated by the court, “the 
testimony is undisputed that at all other times he was in the car

trunk and they were driving on roads, [] they never went on a

boat, they never went on a plane[.]” Thus, viewing the evidence
 
in a light most favorable to the State, a reasonable mind could

have “fairly concluded” that the events occurred on the island of

Oahu and thus, venue in the first circuit was established beyond

a reasonable doubt.

VI.

A.

In connection with the second question in his

Application, Petitioner contends that “Petitioner was [e]ntitled

to a [j]udgment of [a]cquittal as to Class A Felony Kidnapping”

12 Petitioner also asserts that the court and ICA erred in taking
 
judicial notice of venue. However, as discussed supra, sufficient evidence
was adduced to establish that a part of the offense occurred on the island of
Oahu without reference to judicial notice. In any event, Petitioner’s
assertion that the court could not sua sponte take judicial notice of venue is
incorrect.
 
Pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 201 (1993), a
court may take judicial notice of adjudicative facts. “‘Adjudicative facts. . . are the kind of facts that are ordinarily decided by the trier of fact;for example, who did what to whom, when, where, how, and why[.]” Puaoi, 78 
Hawai'i at 190, 891 P.2d at 277. In Puaoi, this court held that under HRE 
Rule 201, “appellate courts may take judicial notice of venue[.]” Id. Under 
HRE Rule 201(c), “[a] court may take judicial notice, whether requested or 
not.” (Emphasis added.) Further, under HRE Rule 201(f), "Judicial notice may 
be taken at any stage of the proceeding.” Thus, the court was entitled to sua 
sponte take judicial notice of venue.
Similarly, in State v. Schnabel , 127 Hawai 'i 432, 279 P.3d 1237
(2012), this court discussed the propriety of sua sponte taking judicial
notice in the context of HRE Rule 202 (1993), which governs judicial notice oflaw. This court held that evidence from prior juvenile convictions should nothave been admitted in a subsequent criminal prosecution under HRS § 571-84(h)(2006 Repl.). Id. at 444, 279 P.3d at 1249. That statute was not raised by
either party; however, this court held that the trial court could have takenjudicial notice of the statute. Id.

      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
because of an “inconsistent verdict.” [Application at 8] As

noted, HRS § 707-720, Kidnapping, provides in relevant part:

. . . .
 
(2) Except as provided in subsection (3), kidnapping is a
Class A felony.
(3) In a prosecution for kidnapping, it is a defense which
reduces the offense to a class B felony that the defendant
voluntarily released the victim, alive and not suffering
from serious or substantial bodily injury, in a safe place
prior to trial.
 
According to Petitioner, he “was acquitted of Assault in the

[S]econd [D]egree but found guilty of the lesser included offense

of Assault in the [T]hird [D]egree.” Petitioner argues that thus
 
“[i]t is undisputable [sic] that . . . [Complainant] was released

from the trunk by Rodri[g]uez without serious or substantial

injury as shown by the jury acquitting [Petitioner] of Assault in

the second degree while finding him guilty of the lesser included

offense of Assault in the [T]hird [D]egree.” (Citing United

States v. Morales, 677 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1982).) Petitioner

concludes then that he “is entitled to a judgment of acquittal as

to Class A felony [K]idnapping[, and a reduction to a conviction

for] . . . Class B felony Kidnapping.” 
 
B.

13
 
In its Answering Brief,  the State maintained that by
 
finding Petitioner guilty of the lesser included offense of

Assault in the Third Degree, the jury found that the State

“proved beyond a reasonable doubt that [Petitioner] caused bodily

injury to [Complainant],” but that “the State did not prove

13

As stated before, in its Response, the State indicated that it
 
“relies on its answering brief.”
 
23

        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
beyond a reasonable doubt that [Petitioner] caused substantial

bodily injury to [Complainant].” The State argues that in
 
finding Petitioner guilty of Kidnapping as a Class A felony, “the

jury found that (1) [Petitioner] did not release [Complainant]

voluntarily, (2) [Complainant] suffered serious or substantial

bodily injury, and (3) [Petitioner] did not release [Complainant]

in a safe place.” (Citing HRS § 707-720(3).) Hence, the State
 
apparently asserts that the verdicts were not inconsistent

because the verdict indicated that “[Petitioner] caused bodily

injury and that [Complainant] suffered substantial bodily

injury.” (Emphases in original.)
 
VII.

First, the court and the ICA incorrectly concluded that

the mitigating Class B felony defense to Kidnapping required only

a finding that “an alleged victim was suffering from substantial

bodily injury,” but did not require a determination as to “who

caused substantial bodily injury to that alleged victim[.]”

Bailey, 2013 WL 3776169, at *2 (emphasis in the original). Such

a rule would preclude a defendant from availing himself or

herself of the Class B mitigating defense available in the

Kidnapping statute even if the injury suffered by the victim was

completely unrelated to the alleged Kidnapping.

The problems created by such an interpretation are

illustrated by the instant case. As explained in greater detail
 
infra, the State asserted that Complainant suffered “substantial

        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
bodily injury” because his nasal bone was fractured.14 However,

Dr. Russell asserted that she couldn’t “determine the age” of the

fracture. Therefore, in closing argument, defense counsel

asserted that no substantial bodily injury occurred because

“there’s no medical testimony as to when that nose was broken.”
15
 
Assuming arguendo that Complainant fractured his nasal

bone prior to the Kidnapping, his nose still could have been

fractured at the time that he was released. At the time of his

release, therefore, he would have been “suffering” from a

fractured nose, and thus “suffering from substantial bodily

injury.” Hence, under the interpretation of HRS § 707-720
 
proposed by the court and the ICA, a defendant could not utilize

the Class B mitigating defense even if the substantial bodily

injury sustained by the victim had nothing to do with the

Kidnapping. 
 
Such a result is clearly contrary to the purpose of the

Class B mitigating defense, to “differentiate according to the

14 In closing argument, the prosecutor asserted that “[t]here’s also
 
no dispute that he did suffer the substantial bodily injury” because Dr.
 
Russell stated that “there was a bone fracture; that that bone fracture was
consistent with the swollen nose injury she observed on [Complainant,]” and
 
that “[Complainant] told you that he had no prior broken nose[.]” Further, in
 
rebuttal argument, the prosecutor stated that the “bone fracture happened as
[Rodriguez] and [Petitioner] [were] hitting [Complainant] in the face.” Thus,
the State relied on the nasal bone fracture to establish substantial bodily
injury.
 
Additionally, when discussing the Class B mitigating defense
specifically, the prosecutor also asserted in closing argument that “ the
 
substantial bodily injury we talked about is the Assault 2, the bone
fracture .” (Emphasis added.) Thus, the State took the position that the same
conduct both negatived the Class B mitigating defense and established the
commission of the offense of assault in the second degree.
 
15

In contrast, the prosecution asserted that it could be determined
 
that the fracture was sustained during the Kidnapping because Complainant
testified that he had not previously broken his nose.
 
25

severity of the actual harm involved,” and to “encourage the

actor to proceed less dangerously once the criminal course of

conduct has begun.” Commentary to HRS §§ 707-720 to 722

(emphases added). Thus, the purpose of allowing a mitigating
 
defense would be undermined by only requiring the State to

demonstrate that the victim was suffering from a substantial

bodily injury at the time of his release. Instead, evidence must
 
have been adduced that demonstrates that the substantial bodily

injury was caused during the course of the Kidnapping by

Petitioner, or by the co-defendant as Petitioner’s accomplice, or

both.
16
 
VIII.

Finally, Petitioner’s assertion that he is entitled to

the benefit of the Class B mitigating defense is incorrect. 
 Here, Petitioner was charged with Kidnapping based on the

unlawful restraint of Complainant with the intent to terrorize

him. The Class B mitigating defense is a non-affirmative

defense
17 that applies to all versions of Kidnapping, see HRS §

16 To reiterate, the State asserted that the substantial bodily
 
injury suffered by Complainant was a broken nose. Complainant testified that
he was punched in the nose while there was a bag over his face, and that
Petitioner and Rodriguez were the only individuals present. Thus, the jury
could infer from the evidence that both Petitioner and Rodriguez struck
Complainant and that either of them or both could have caused Complainant’s
injuries. The court’s instructions stated that “[a] defendant charged with
committing an offense may be guilty because he is an accomplice of another
person in the commission of the offense.” Hence, the jury also could have
concluded that either Petitioner or Rodriguez caused the substantial bodily
injury and that the other defendant was liable as an accomplice.

“Affirmative defenses are those so designated by the [Hawai 'i 
Penal] Code or another statute; or defenses which the Hawai 'i Penal Code or 
another statute plainly require the defendant to prove by a preponderance ofthe evidence.” State v. Gabrillo , 10 Haw. App. 448, 455, 877 P.2d 891, 894 
26

707-720(1), and reduces the severity of every Kidnapping version

from a Class A felony to a Class B felony. HRS § 707-720(3). 
 
As a result, “where the criminal defense is not an

affirmative defense, the ‘defendant need only raise a reasonable

doubt as to his guilt.’” Gabrillo, 10 Haw. App. at 455, 877 P.2d

at 894 (quoting Commentary on HRS § 701-115). The burden then

falls on the prosecution to “‘prove beyond a reasonable doubt

facts negativing the defense.’” Id. (quoting Commentary on HRS §

701-115). Consequently, “‘[t]he prosecution does this when the
 
jury believes its case[.]’” Id. (quoting Commentary on HRS §

701-115). Therefore, to convict Petitioner of Kidnapping as a
 
Class A felony, the State was required to disprove the Class B

mitigating defense beyond a reasonable doubt.

Here, the jury’s response to the special

interrogatories indicated that the jury found that the State

disproved at least two of the three elements of the Class B

mitigating defense beyond a reasonable doubt, i.e., the

requirement that Petitioner released Complainant and the

requirement that Complainant was released in a safe place. 
 Petitioner challenges only the answer to the second special

interrogatory, that Complainant was alive and suffering from

serious or substantial bodily injury as inconsistent with the 
 
(1994) (quoting HRS § 701-115(3)) (internal brackets and punctuation omitted).
Here, the Class B mitigating defense is not designated as an affirmative
defense and there is no statute that requires the defendant to prove the Class
B mitigating defense by a preponderance of the evidence. Hence, the Class B
 
mitigating defense is not an affirmative defense. Id.

jury’s verdict convicting Petitioner of assault in the third

degree. 
 
However, the State would need only to disprove one of

the elements of the Class B mitigating defense beyond a

reasonable doubt to establish that the defense did not apply. 
 State v. Kikuta, 125 Hawai' i 78, 253 P.2d 639 (2011), is 
instructive in this regard. In Kikuta, this court discussed the

trial court’s refusal to give the parental discipline defense.
18
 
125 Hawai' i at 84, 253 P.3d at 645. This court explained that 
“[i]n order to invoke the parental discipline defense a defendant

18 HRS § 703-309 (1993) provides in relevant part as follows:
 
§ 703-309 Use of force by persons with special
responsibility for care, discipline, or safety of
others.
 
The use of force upon or toward the person of another is
justifiable under the following circumstances:
 
(1) The actor is the parent, guardian, or other person
similarly responsible for the general care and supervision
of a minor, or a person acting at the request of the parent,
guardian, or other responsible person, and:

(a) The force is employed with due regard for
the age and size of the minor and is reasonably
related to the purpose of safeguarding or
promoting the welfare of the minor, including
the prevention or punishment of the minor's
misconduct; provided that there shall be a
rebuttable presumption that the following types
of force are not justifiable for purposes of
this subsection: throwing, kicking, burning,
biting, cutting, striking with a closed fist,
shaking a minor under three years of age,
interfering with breathing, or threatening with
a deadly weapon; and
 
(b) The force used does not intentionally,
knowingly, recklessly, or negligently create a
risk of causing substantial bodily injury,
disfigurement, extreme pain or mental distress,
or neurological damage.

is required to make a showing that the record contained some 
evidence supporting [four different] elements.”19 Id.; accord 
State v. Crouser, 81 Hawai' i 5, 10-11, 911 P.2d 725, 730-31 
(1996). Additionally, Kikuta explained that “because the requirements of HRS § 703–309 are set out in the conjunctive, rather than the disjunctive, a defendant need only fail to fulfill any one element in order to fail to sustain the defense.” Id. at 87, 253 P.3d at 648; accord Crouser, 81 Hawai' i at 11, 911 
P.2d at 731. Because some evidence existed in the record as to all four elements, this court held that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury as to the defense. Kikuta, 125 Hawai' i 
at 94, 253 P.3d at 655. 
The requirements of the Class B mitigating defense in

HRS § 707-720(3) are clearly set forth in the conjunctive, i.e.,

a defendant must voluntarily release the victim, the victim must

be alive and not suffer from serious or substantial bodily

injury, and the victim must be released in a safe place. Hence,
 
“a defendant need only fail to fulfill any one element in order

19 The four elements of the parental discipline defense are:
 
(1) [the defendant] was a parent, guardian, or other person
as described in HRS § 703–309(1); (2) [the defendant] used
force against a minor for whose care and supervision he [or
she] was responsible; (3) his [or her] use of force was with
due regard to the age and size of the recipient and
reasonably related to the purpose of safeguarding or
promoting the welfare of the minor, including the prevention
or punishment of misconduct; and (4) the force used was not
designed to cause, or known to create a risk of causing,
substantial bodily injury, disfigurement, extreme pain or
mental distress, or neurological damage.

to fail to sustain the defense.” Kikuta, 125 Hawai' i at 87, 253 
P.3d at 648. Thus, the State was only required to disprove one of the elements of the defense beyond a reasonable doubt to establish that the defendant “failed to fulfill” one element and therefore was not entitled to the defense. 
The jury’s responses to the two special interrogatories

indicated that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that

Petitioner did not release Complainant voluntarily, and that

Petitioner did not release Complainant in a safe place. Hence,
 
the responses to those special interrogatories established that

the State “proved beyond a reasonable doubt facts negativing” the

first and third elements of the Class B mitigating defense. See

Gabrillo, 10 Haw. App. at 455, 877 P.2d at 894. Thus, Petitioner
 
was not entitled to the Class B mitigating defense here.

Based on the foregoing, the ICA’s August 21, 2013

judgment on appeal and the court’s March 19, 2012 Judgment of

Conviction and Sentence of Petitioner are affirmed, but for the

reasons stated herein.
