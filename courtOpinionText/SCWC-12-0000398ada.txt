OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J.
 
This case raises two questions concerning the law of 
workers’ compensation in Hawai
'i as it relates to permanent 
partial disability (PPD) awards. First, must a PPD award for an           
   
   
     
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
unscheduled injury that is not comparable to a scheduled injury
 
be supported by some factual finding of a determinate percentage
 of impairment of a physical or mental function of the whole
 person? This question relates to a required component in the way
 the PPD award for such an injury must be calculated under HRS §
 
386-32(a).
1  Second, may a PPD determination be based on a
 
claimant’s post-injury inability (or reduced ability) to perform
 
the usual and customary work activities in the position the
 
1 HRS § 386-32(a) states:
 
Permanent  partial  disability.   Where  a  work
 
injury  causes  permanent  partial  disability,  the  employer
shall  pay  the  injured  worker  compensation  in  an  amount
determined  by  multiplying  the  effective  maximum  weekly
benefit  rate  prescribed  in  section  386-31  by  the  number  of
weeks  specified  for  the  disability  as  follows:
 
.  .  .
 
Other  cases.   In  all  other  cases  of  permanent
partial  disability  resulting  from  the  loss  or  loss  of  use  of
a  part  of  the  body  or  from  the  impairment  of  any  physical
function,  weekly  benefits  shall  be  paid  at  the  rate  and
subject  to  the  limitations  specified  in  this  subsection  for
a  period  that  bears  the  same  relation  to  a  period  named  in
the  schedule  as  the  disability  sustained  bears
 t
o a
comparable disability named  in  the  schedule.  In cases in
 
which  the  permanent  partial  disability  must  be  rated  as  a
percentage  of  the  total  loss  or  impairment  of  a  physical  or
mental  function  of  the  whole  person,  the  maximum
compensation  shall  be  computed  on  the  basis  of  the
corresponding  percentage  of  the  product  of  three  hundred
twelve  times  the  effective  maximum  weekly  benefit  rate
prescribed  in  section  386-31.  (Emphasis added.)

claimant occupied prior to the injury?2 This question relates to
 
the range of permissible methods by which the degree of partial
 
impairment may be assessed. With the qualifications detailed
 below, we answer both questions in the affirmative. 
II. BACKGROUND
 
In March, 2012, the Labor and Industrial Relations
 
Appeals Board (the LIRAB or the Board) awarded Ihara $250 in
 permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits and found the
 Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) liable for
 vocational rehabilitation services. Both Ihara and DLNR appealed
 to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA). The ICA vacated the
 LIRAB’s award of $250 in PPD and related vocational
 rehabilitation services, and it remanded to the LIRAB for further
 proceedings. On certiorari, Ihara seeks reversal of the ICA’s
 decision to vacate the LIRAB’s award of permanent partial
 disability benefits to Ihara. Ihara contends the ICA erred in
 holding that (1) the LIRAB was required to calculate the award
 based on a percentage-based finding of impairment, and (2) that
 
2
 We consider only the issues raised by Ihara in his
 
application for writ of certiorari. His application presented three
questions: Did the ICA gravely err in ruling that a PPD award requires a
finding of some mental or physical impairment? Did the ICA gravely err in
 ruling that PPD must equal impairment? Did the ICA gravely err in ruling that
PPD should not be based on a claimant’s ability to work? We reformulate his
 first question more precisely above; we combine his second and third questions
in the discussion below.
 
3
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the LIRAB erred when it considered work activities in determining
 
Ihara’s PPD award. 
A. Ihara’s employment and injury
 
Ihara was employed as a Deputy Registrar at the Bureau
 
of Conveyances, a division within DLNR. Although he was a Deputy
 Registrar, Ihara was in charge of operations for the Bureau of
 Conveyances and effectively performed the duties of the
 Registrar. Ihara described the Bureau as being in a state of
 “disarray and dysfunction,” explaining that “the Land Court
 section staff was pitted against the Regular System section
 staff.” Job stress caused Ihara to experience trouble sleeping,
 memory lapses, anxiety, and depression. 
Ihara reported to DLNR that he suffered increased
 
hypertension and stress resulting from the pressures of his
 position, and that this injury occurred on approximately 
February 1, 2007. On March 21, 2007, DLNR filed a Form WC-1:
 Employer’s Report of Industrial Injury, which documented Ihara’s
 claim and the nature of his injury, and on May 17, 2007, Ihara
 filed a Form WC-5: Employee’s Claim for Worker’s Compensation
 Benefits. Ihara’s physician, Dr. Ronald A. Morton, submitted a
 letter stating that Ihara was in reasonably good health with
 controlled hypertension, but that high work stress had caused a
 
4
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
recent and marked elevation in his blood pressure. 
At the request of DLNR, Dr. Ajit Arora performed an
 
Independent Medical Examination and Dr. Jon Streltzer performed
 
an Independent Psychiatric Examination on Ihara. Dr. Arora’s
 report from May 21, 2007 diagnosed Ihara with “[e]ssential
 hypertension, genetically based, with temporary aggravation.” 
Dr. Streltzer’s report from June 19, 2007 stated that Ihara
 suffered from “Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety, Primary
 Insomnia, Occupational Problem (not a mental disorder), and High
 Blood Pressure.” Based on Dr. Arora’s and Dr. Streltzer’s
 Independent Medical Examination and Independent Psychiatric
 Evaluation, DLNR accepted compensability for Ihara’s claim as a
 temporary aggravation. 
The Department of Human Resources Development, Employee
 
Claims Division, instructed the doctors to submit reports and
 statements to the Department of Human Resources Development,
 State Workers’ Compensation Division, documenting the medical
 services rendered in relation to his increased stress and
 hypertension. Various notes from Dr. Morton were submitted, as
 well as from psychiatrist Dr. Dennis Lind, excusing Ihara from
 work and stating that he was disabled for certain dates. Ihara
 was put on unpaid medical leave with his last day at work being
 
5
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
June 12, 2007.
 
On June 19, 2008 the claims manager of the Employee
 
Claims Division wrote to Drs. Lind and Morton requesting their
 
opinions as to whether Ihara could return to work. On June 25,
 2008, Dr. Lind responded that Ihara had reached medical stability
 and could work in other situations, but not at DLNR. Dr. Morton
 wrote on June 27, 2008 that Ihara could return to regular duty
 and had reached medical stability. 
Based on Dr. Lind’s assessment that Ihara had reached
 
medical stability but could only work in other situations, DLNR
 discharged Ihara from his position at the Bureau of Conveyances
 via a letter dated July 11, 2008. Relying on Dr. Lind’s “medical
 assessment,” DLNR determined that Ihara was “medically
 disqualified for continued civil service employment,” not only
 for the Deputy Registrar position but also for “any DLNR
 employment.” 
B. 	Hearings before the Department of Labor and Industrial
Relations and the LIRAB
 
Ihara claimed eligibility for temporary total
 
disability benefits and vocational rehabilitation services. 
Ihara’s employer, DLNR, disputed his eligibility for some of
 those benefits and services. Disputes concerning benefits are
 
6
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
decided by the director of the Department of Labor and Industrial
 
Relations. HRS § 386-86(a)-(b)(1993 & Supp. 2014). The director
 conducts an informal hearing on the claim and issues findings of
 fact and conclusions of law. Id. After an initial hearing in
 
March 2008 and a decision in May 2008, the director, in a
 supplemental decision in October 2009, stated that DLNR was
 required to pay Ihara for “such medical care, services and
 supplies as the nature of the injury may require,” as well as
 weekly compensation for Ihara’s temporary total disability and
 temporary partial disability for the relevant weeks of his leave. 
In addition, the director found that no permanent disability
 resulted from Ihara’s injury. Both Ihara and DLNR appealed the
 decision to the LIRAB.
 
In its March 13, 2012 decision and order, the Board
 
found that Ihara was entitled to certain periods of temporary
 total disability as a result of his work injury and to vocational
 rehabilitation benefits for certain periods. The Board concluded
 that Ihara was entitled to benefits for permanent partial
 disability in the amount of $250 based on its finding that the
 DLNR’s statement in its July 11, 2008 letter that Ihara was
 medically disqualified from his position served as an admission
 that Ihara was permanently disabled.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The Board finds that Employer’s statement that Claimant was
“medically disqualified” for his position was an admission or
acknowledgement that Claimant was permanently disabled. The Board
 finds this to be especially so, because Employer sought out and
received opinions of medical stability from Drs. Morton and Lind
before it sent this letter.
 
The Board credits the opinions that Claimant sustained no
ratable impairment. However, Employer’s July 11, 2008 letter
admitted or acknowledged permanent disability, stated that
Claimant was “medically disqualified” for his position, and
 terminated him therefrom. Therefore, the Board finds that
 Claimant sustained permanent partial disability in the amount of
$250.
 
Both the DLNR and Ihara appealed the LIRAB’s decision to the ICA. 
C. ICA proceedings
 
The ICA vacated the Board’s ruling awarding Ihara $250
 
in PPD benefits on two grounds. First, the ICA held that the
 statute governing PPD benefits requires the assignment of a
 percentage of impairment for unscheduled injuries, i.e., for
 injuries not listed in the statute. More precisely stated, the
 statute requires the assignment of a percentage of impairment for
 injuries not specifically listed in the statute or comparable to
 those listed in the statute. The Board had failed to assign any
 percentage of impairment to Ihara’s injury, instead awarding him
 a lump sum of $250. 
Second, based on its analysis of the statute’s
 
legislative history, the ICA held that PPD may not be based on
 “ability to work,” because, unlike total disability awards, PPD
 benefits are essentially indemnity payments for loss of bodily
 
8
           
        
           
             
      
         
             
         *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
integrity, not compensation to replace loss of wages. The ICA
 
found that the Board improperly awarded Ihara permanent partial
 disability benefits based on his reduced ability to work. The
 ICA noted that the Board’s award of PPD benefits was based on the
 ambiguous position that, though Ihara suffered no ratable
 impairment, nonetheless he was “medically disqualified” to return
 to his position at DLNR, and the Board accordingly awarded him
 PPD benefits, based on his reduced ability to work. 
The ICA found the Board’s position on the extent of
 
Ihara’s impairment ambiguous. Either the Board meant by its
 findings that Ihara suffered no impairment at all, or it meant
 “that he had suffered some impairment, but in an amount incapable
 of being measured.”
3
 
The ICA vacated the Board’s award and remanded “for a
 
determination of whether Ihara had suffered a permanent
 impairment, and if so, the percentage of the impairment and the
 award of PPD benefits based on that percentage.”
4
 
3
 As noted infra, an award of permanent partial disability
 
benefits for an unscheduled injury that is not comparable to a scheduled
injury must be based on a finding of a determinate degree or percentage of
impairment.
 
4
 Vocational rehabilitation services are available for
 
employees who suffer permanent disability. HRS § 386-25(b)(Supp. 2014).
Because the ICA vacated the Board’s award of PPD benefits to Ihara, it also
 vacated the Board’s determination that Ihara was entitled to vocational

III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. 	Appeals from agency determinations relating to workers’
compensation
 
Appellate review of a LIRAB decision is governed by the 
provisions of the Hawai' i Administrative Procedure Act relating 
to judicial review of agency action. HRS § 91-14(g)(1993); 
Bocalbos v. Kapiolani Med. Ctr. for Women & Children, 93 Hawai' i 
116, 123, 997 P.2d 42, 49 (App. 2000). Under those provisions, the reviewing court “may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions for further proceedings.” Id. 
The reviewing court also “may reverse or modify the decision and order if the substantial rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders” (1) violate provisions of the constitution or a statute, (2) are beyond the agency’s statutory authority or jurisdiction, (3) used “unlawful procedure,” (4) were “[a]ffected by other error of law,” (5) were clearly erroneous, or (6) were arbitrary or capricious “or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.” HRS § 91­14(g)(1)-(6). To be reversed as clearly erroneous, the agency’s 
4(...continued)
rehabilitation  services.   The  ICA  then  remanded  that  issue  to  the  Board  “for  a
 
redetermination  consistent  with  its  final  decision  on  the  PPD  issue.”
   
10
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
findings, conclusions, decisions or orders must be clearly 
erroneous “in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.” HRS § 91-14(g)(5); Poe v. 
Hawai'i Labor Relations Bd., 87 Hawai' i 191, 195, 953 P.2d 569, 
573 (1998). As to conclusions of law, the LIRAB’s conclusions will be reviewed de novo, under the right/wrong standard. Tate 
v. GTE Hawaiian Tel. Co., 77 Hawai' i 100, 103, 881 P.2d 1246, 
1249 (1994). As to findings of fact, an “agency’s findings should be ‘sufficient to allow the reviewing court to track the steps by which the agency reached its decision.’” Kauai Springs, 
Inc. v. Planning Comm’n of Cty. of Kauai, 133 Hawai' i 141, 164, 
324 P.3d 951, 974 (2014)(citation omitted); Int’l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, Local 1357 v. Hawaiian Tel. Co., 68 Haw. 316, 328, 713 P.2d 943, 953 (1986)(“A remand pursuant to HRS § 91–14(g) is appropriate if an agency’s findings are incomplete”). “When mixed questions of law and fact are presented, an appellate court must give deference to the agency’s expertise and experience in the particular field. The court should not substitute its own judgment for that of the agency.” In re Water Use Permit 
Applications, 94 Hawai' i 97, 119, 9 P.3d 409, 431 
(2000)(citation, braces, and internal quotation marks omitted). 
11
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B. Statutory interpretation
 
Appellate courts review statutory interpretation de 
novo. Van Ness v. State, Dep’t of Educ., 131 Hawai' i 545, 558, 
319 P.3d 464, 477 (2014), as corrected (Feb. 4, 2014). “When 
construing a statute, our foremost obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute itself.” Id. (citation omitted). The “broad humanitarian 
purpose of the workers’ compensation statute read as a whole requires that all reasonable doubts be resolved in favor of the claimant.” Id. (braces, underscoring, and citation omitted). 
The statute must be “construed . . . liberally” in order to effect its “beneficent purposes.” Puchert v. Agsalud, 67 Haw. 
25, 36, 677 P.2d 449, 457 (1984). 
IV. DISCUSSION
 
On certiorari, Ihara raises as issues (1) whether a PPD
 
award for an unscheduled injury requires a finding of some mental
 or physical impairment and (2) whether a PPD award may reflect a
 claimant’s reduced ability to work. To address these issues, we
 provide a brief overview of the relevant portions of the workers’
 compensation statute. 
12
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
A. 	Legislative and administrative background of permanent
partial disability
 
Workers’ compensation statutes “are highly remedial in 
character. Their paramount purpose is to provide compensation 
for an employee for all work-connected injuries, regardless of questions of negligence and proximate cause.” Flor v. Holguin, 
94 Hawai' i 70, 79, 9 P.3d 382, 391, on reconsideration in part, 
94 Hawai' i 92, 9 P.3d 404 (2000). The Hawai' i workers’ 
compensation statute “is social legislation that is to be interpreted broadly.” Davenport v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 
Honolulu Fire Dep’t, 100 Hawai' i 481, 491, 60 P.3d 882, 892 
(2002). The statute provides “an injured employee’s exclusive remedy for an injury arising out of and in the course of employment.” Iddings v. Mee-Lee, 82 Hawai' i 1, 5, 919 P.2d 263, 
267 (1996). In addition, the statute embodies a presumption of compensability, and that “presumption has been described as one of the ‘keystone principles’ of our workers’ compensation plan.” Flor, 94 Hawai' i at 79, 9 P.3d at 391. 
Various benefit categories exist to meet different
 
workers’ varied circumstances. Two types of permanent disability
 are relevant to our discussion here: total disability and
 permanent partial disability. Total disability benefits
 
13
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
compensate a worker for his or her loss of wage-earning capacity,
 
while PPD benefits compensate a worker for the loss of bodily
 integrity, that is, the loss of a physical or mental function. 
HRS § 386-31(a); HRS § 386-32(a). If an employee is injured on
 the job and is unable to work in any capacity after the injury,
 he or she is eligible for a total disability benefit. H. Stand.
 Comm. Rep. No. 418-70, in 1970 House Journal, at 976. Total
 permanent disability payments are wage replacement benefits meant
 to compensate the worker for the permanent loss of wage-earning
 capacity where the worker is unable to find work on the regular
 labor market. Id. The purpose of a PPD award, on the other
 
hand, is to compensate a worker for the loss or impairment of a
 physical or mental function. Unlike total disability, a PPD
 award is not based on the amount of wages lost. H. Stand. Comm.
 Rep. No. 193, in 1969 House Journal, at 702. A PPD award is
 payable to the worker even if the worker returns to work, and the
 amount of the award derives from the extent of a worker’s
 impairment rather than his or her wage-earning capacity. See HRS
 
§ 386-32(a). 
The distinction between total disability and PPD
 
benefits is further clarified in the legislative history of the
 1970 amendments to the statute. “‘[T]otal disability’ is defined
 
14
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
as ‘disability of such an extent that the disabled employee has
 
no reasonable prospect of finding regular employment of any kind
 in the normal labor market.’  .  .  .  Permanent partial
 disability compensation payments under the law, however, are
 based primarily on impairment of physical or mental function and
 not on ability for work.” H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 418-70, in
 1970 House Journal, at 976. Thus, the legislature intended that
 total disability benefits should compensate a worker for wages
 lost when he or she is unable to find regular employment of any
 kind due to a work-related injury, whereas PPD benefits should
 compensate for the loss or impairment of a mental or bodily
 function, irrespective of wage-earning capabilities.
 PPD injuries divide into two basic classes, scheduled and
 unscheduled. 2 Modern Workers Compensation § 200:10 (Thomson
 Reuters 2017). Scheduled losses or injuries are those
 specifically listed and provided for by statute; unscheduled
 losses or injuries are those not specifically listed. Id. 
Methods for determining or calculating the amount of compensation
 for permanent partial injuries differ depending on whether the
 injury is scheduled or unscheduled. HRS § 386-32(a) illustrates
 the method for determining the amount of compensation for
 scheduled injuries. It includes a schedule of body parts whose
 
15
           
         
        
        
      
       
          
            
             
         
         
        
        
     
       *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
loss is covered by permanent partial disability benefits, with
 
the amount of compensation varying based on the specific body
 part. The schedule lists benefits to be paid for specific
 losses, e.g., a finger or hand. HRS § 386-32(a). 
For loss or impairment of a function that is not listed
 
in the schedule, or is not comparable to a scheduled injury, the
 permanent partial disability is rated as a percentage of the
 total loss or impairment of a physical or mental function of the
 whole person.
5 HRS § 386-32(a). The percentage is used to
 
calculate the dollar amount of the PPD award according to a
 formula in the statute. HRS § 386-32(a) provides that the
 “maximum compensation” for an unscheduled PPD injury “shall be
 computed on the basis of the corresponding percentage . . . .” 
Id. (emphasis added). 
5 The general outline of this “degree of whole person
 
impairment” approach has been described as follows.
 
Under the impairment of the whole person method of
computing workers’ compensation for a permanent partial
disability, the calculation of the workers’ compensation payable
is the result of a multiplication. The multiplicand is the amount
which the statute assigns to the whole person. This may be a flat
dollar amount or a number of weeks or months of compensation . . .
with the per-week compensation figured as a fraction or percentage
of the employee’s pre-injury average weekly wages or earnings or
the statewide average weekly wage. The multiplier is the
proportion, fraction, percentage or degree (figured up to 100
degrees) of the employee’s impairment.
 
2 Modern Workers Compensation § 200:18.
 
16
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In practice, initial PPD ratings for unscheduled 
injuries are typically provided by medical experts using rating 
categories outlined in the various editions of the American Medical Association’s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (AMA Guides), and then the LIRAB may add additional percentage points depending on the magnitude of the impairment 
rating. See Hawai' i Administrative Rules (HAR) § 12-10­
21(a)(“Impairment rating guides issued by the American Medical 
Association, American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, and any other such guides which the director deems appropriate and proper may be used as a reference or guide in measuring a disability.”). See also Ibarra v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co., Case No. AB 2009-504 (2-06-01173); Chi v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, Case No. AB 2006­116 (2-04-01998). 
It is, however, ultimately the director of the
 
Department of Labor and Industrial Relations or the Board, and
 not the physician, that decides the final PPD rating. Cabatbat
 
v. Cty of Hawai' i, Dep’t of Water Supply, 103 Hawai' i 1, 9, 78 
P.3d 756, 764 (2003), as corrected (Dec. 8, 2003). The LIRAB generally places great weight upon a physician’s initial impairment rating, but it is not the only component of the Board’s assessment. Id. The LIRAB’s decisions show a marked 
17
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
pattern in which the Board considers factors other than the
 
physician’s impairment rating, such as whether the complainant is
 able to participate in the same types of hobbies and daily and
 work activities as prior to the accident. See, e.g., Belanio v.
 
State, Case No. AB 2007-532 (1-03-10259) at 8 (claimant’s
 inability to return to customary job resulted in 3% PPD); Deponte
 v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, Case No. AB 97-624 (2-95-11372) at 3­4 (claimant’s inability to perform activities of daily living
 resulted in 2% PPD); Chi, AB 2006-116 at 3 (claimant awarded 3%
 PPD due to inability to engage in recreational and daily living
 activities). 
Disputes concerning compensation under Hawaii’s
 
workers’ compensation law are decided by the director. HRS §
 386-86(a)-(b). The director conducts an informal hearing on the
 claim and issues findings of fact and conclusions of law. Id. 
The decision of the director may be administratively appealed to
 the LIRAB, which conducts a de novo, trial-like hearing on the
 appeal from the director’s determination. HRS § 386-87(a)-(c). 
A LIRAB decision may be appealed directly to the ICA. HRS § 386­73.5; HRS § 386-88.

           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B. 	A PPD award requires a finding of some determinate impairment
of a mental or physical function
 
The ICA held that a PPD award requires a finding of
 
some percentage of mental or physical impairment. The ICA
 
concluded that the Board’s findings as to the extent of Ihara’s
 impairment were ambiguous. Under the Board’s findings, it is
 possible to conclude either that Ihara suffered no permanent
 impairment or that he suffered some impairment, but not in a
 ratable amount. The ICA concluded that under either of the two
 alternative interpretations, the Board erred. As to the first
 alternative, “[i]f the LIRAB’s conclusion was that Ihara suffered
 no impairment, then its interpretation of HRS § 386-32(a) was
 erroneous because a PPD award requires a finding that there is
 some mental or physical impairment.” The ICA explained that the
 definition section of HRS chapter 386 defines disability as “loss
 or impairment of a physical or mental function,” and it concluded
 that an impairment is necessary to support a PPD award because
 the definition of disability explicitly includes a loss or
 impairment. As to the second alternative, that Ihara had
 suffered some impairment, but not in a ratable amount, the ICA
 concluded that the Board had impermissibly imported Ihara’s
 reduced ability to work as a criterion in deciding Ihara’s PPD
 
19
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
impairment. In the ICA’s view, the legislative intent of the
 
statute “makes clear that PPD is solely based on a claimant’s
 physical or mental impairment and not on his ability to work.” 
We consider the ICA’s analysis of the first alternative in this
 section and its analysis of the second alternative in the next
 section.
 
In regard to the first alternative, Ihara argues that 
the ICA failed to “recognize long-standing precedents which did not require a finding of some mental or physical impairment in order to award PPD.” Ihara argues that the Hawai' i workers’ 
compensation statute has an established history of awarding PPD even in the absence of impairment, citing a number of the LIRAB’s administrative adjudications. 
Ihara is mistaken. His analysis of the LIRAB decisions
 
confuses the LIRAB’s impairment rating with a physician’s
 impairment rating. The LIRAB decisions Ihara cites do, in fact,
 serve as instances where a physician gave a 0% impairment rating,
 or found no impairment, and yet the LIRAB awarded a small
 percentage of PPD. However, these decisions merely show that it
 is not necessary for a physician to find a percentage of
 impairment under the AMA Guides in order for the LIRAB to award
 PPD. The LIRAB decisions he cites do not negate the fact that
 
20
           
          
          
            
           
     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the LIRAB must ultimately find impairment before making a PPD 
award. In the decisions Ihara cites, the LIRAB found that the physician’s 0% or low impairment rating based on the AMA Guides did not fully reflect the claimant’s total loss or impairment, and so it further evaluated the record to reach an accurate impairment rating.
6 We approved this practice in Cabatbat when 
we quoted the Arizona Supreme Court’s holding that where the AMA Guides and the physician’s assessment do not give an accurate portrayal of the total loss of impairment, the director or Board should take other factors into account to reach an accurate disability determination. 103 Hawai' i at 9, 78 P.3d at 764 
(“when the AMA Guides do not truly reflect a claimant’s loss, the [administrative law judge] must use his discretion to hear additional evidence and, from the whole record, establish a rating independent of the AMA recommendations.” (quoting Slover Masonry, Inc. v. Indus. Comm’n, 761 P.2d 1035, 1040 (Ariz. 1988))). We later reaffirmed this view when we stated that other factors affecting a PPD assessment include “skills, education, job history, adaptability, age, and environment . . . .” Duque

 See, e.g. , Ibarra, AB 2009-504 at 7-8 (awarding claimant 2%

because lower back injury affected ability to work); Chi, AB 2006-116 at 3-4
(awarding claimant 3% PPD for residual eye problems despite AMA Guides rating
his vision impairment at 0%).

v. Hilton Hawaiian Vill., 105 Hawai' i 433, 439, 98 P.3d 640, 646 
(2004)(quoting the AMA Guides). 
Furthermore, none of the LIRAB decisions Ihara marshals
 
demonstrate circumstances where the LIRAB found the claimant
 
suffered no impairment whatever; on the contrary, in each of
 these cases, the LIRAB found that the complainant’s daily
 activities at home or at work were permanently affected due to
 the injury. For example, in Chi, a police officer who was struck
 in the eye rated at 0% impairment according to the vision test
 outlined in the AMA Guides, but based on testimony that he
 suffered from double vision and was no longer able to engage in
 certain activities of daily living as a result, the LIRAB awarded
 him 3% PPD. AB 2006-116 at 3-4. 
It follows that even where a physician finds there is
 
no impairment under the standards in the AMA Guides, or fails to
 give an impairment rating, the LIRAB has the discretion to
 consider the entire record, even beyond the physician’s
 impairment rating, to determine the most accurate impairment
 rating possible. The AMA Guides itself does not require an award
 of permanent partial disability to be conditioned upon a finding
 of impairment by a physician. Instead, the AMA Guides emphasizes
 that it “is not intended to be used for direct estimates of work
 
22
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
disability. Impairment percentages derived according to the
 
Guides criteria do not measure work disability. Therefore, it is
 inappropriate to use the Guides’ criteria or ratings to make
 direct estimates of work disability.” AMA Guides (Fifth Edition,
 
2000), at 9; id. at 13 (“Impairment percentages estimate the
 extent of the impairment of the whole person functioning and
 account for basic activities of daily living, not including work. 
The complexity of work activities requires individual analysis. 
Impairment assessment is a necessary first step for determining
 disability.”)(emphasis in original)).
 
The cases Ihara cites represent instances where the
 
physician found no percentage of impairment, but after reviewing
 the record, the LIRAB found impairment based on additional or
 other evidence. None of the cases Ihara highlights include a
 scenario where the LIRAB found that there was no impairment
 whatever, yet still awarded PPD. Thus, the ICA accurately held
 that a PPD award requires a finding of some physical or mental
 impairment. 
Following Ihara’s hearing, the Board did not determine
 
Ihara’s PPD using the percentage of impairment, and instead
 directly awarded him a monetary lump sum of $250 with no
 explanation as to how it calculated the amount of the award. 
23
           
 
         
              
            
          
            
            
            
            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The statutory formula uses the impairment percentage to calculate
 
the monetary amount of the PPD award, stating that “[i]n cases in
 which the permanent partial disability must be rated as a
 percentage of the total loss or impairment . . . the maximum
 compensation shall be computed on the basis of the corresponding
 percentage of the product of three hundred twelve times the
 effective maximum weekly benefit rate . . . .” HRS § 386-32(a).
7
 
Given this statutory provision, the LIRAB cannot calculate
 Ihara’s monetary PPD award in accordance with the statute without
 first establishing his percentage of impairment. 
Accordingly, the ICA correctly vacated Ihara’s PPD
 
award. A PPD award for an unscheduled injury that is not
 comparable to a scheduled injury must be based on a finding of
 some determinate percentage of “the total loss or impairment of a
 physical or mental function of the whole person.” HRS § 386­32(a). The percentage may correspond to the percentage of
 impairment found by a physician using the AMA Guides. The
 percentage may also correspond to a physician’s rating of
 
7
 Ihara also contends that HRS § 386-32(a) only requires that
 
a PPD percentage be used to calculate the maximum PPD for which a claimant is
eligible, and that no percentage is required to calculate the PPD a claimant
is actually awarded. Even were Ihara’s interpretation of the statutory
language correct, the statute mandates that the LIRAB still must find a PPD
percentage to set the ceiling of a claimant’s PPD award eligibility. Because
 the LIRAB failed to establish a percentage, it was unable to calculate the
maximum PPD award for which Ihara was eligible.
 
24
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
impairment based on “any other such guides which the director
 
deems appropriate and proper,” and therefore “may be used as a
 reference or guide in measuring a disability.” HAR § 12-10­21(a). Where a physician’s estimate of the permanent impairment
 under the AMA Guides is zero, the Board nonetheless has the
 discretion to find a determinate degree of impairment using
 standards not encompassed by the AMA Guides.
 C. 	A claimant’s loss of wage-earning capacity cannot be
considered in determining permanent partial disability;
however, reduced ability to perform one’s usual and customary
work post-injury can be considered in determining PPD
 
The ICA concluded: “The legislative intent of HRS §
 
386-32(a) makes clear that PPD is solely based on a claimant’s
 
physical or mental impairment and not on his ability to work.” 
As the ICA stated, the legislative history of the statute
 “strengthens the conclusion that awards for PPD are meant to be
 based on the extent of a claimant’s impairment and not on his
 wage-earning capacity or ability to work.” Accordingly, the ICA
 held that inability (or reduced ability) to perform work-related
 activities may never be a factor in determining PPD awards. 
This analysis fails to distinguish with sufficient
 
precision between a post-injury reduced ability to perform the
 work activities of one’s former position (which may be relevant
 
25
           
      
              
      
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to PPD), on the one hand, and loss of future wage-earning
 
capacity (which is relevant only to total disability
 determinations), on the other. While total disability awards
 compensate a worker who has lost his or her wage-earning
 capacity, permanent partial disability awards serve a different
 purpose: to compensate the worker for a loss of bodily integrity. 
Cuarisma v. Urban Painters, Ltd., 59 Haw. 409, 421, 583 P.2d 321,
 327 (1978). 
Stated differently, loss of wages or earning capacity
 
is relevant to total disability (whether temporary total
 disability or permanent total disability), but it is not a
 relevant criterion in determining permanent partial disability. 
Id. (“Permanent partial disability compensation is an indemnity
 payment for the loss or impairment of a physical function and,
 unlike temporary total disability benefits, is not compensation
 to replace current loss of wages.”).

awards, it should not be considered in PPD awards)9. In short,
 
the ICA correctly held that PPD awards may not be based on wage
 
loss or earnings loss, because PPD awards rest on a different
 rationale than awards for total disability, whether permanent or
 temporary total disability. 
However, the ICA mistakenly concluded that eligibility
 
for a PPD award may never be based, even in part, on an inability
 or reduced ability, post-injury, to perform one’s usual and
 customary work. In so concluding, the ICA incorrectly supposed
 that considering the claimant’s post-injury inability to perform
 his or her usual and customary work is the equivalent of
 considering the loss-of-wages rationale appropriate only to total
 disability awards. 
A total disability award provides the injured worker
 
with a replacement income stream because he or she can no longer
 work and therefore cannot earn a living. For that reason, loss
 of income is a necessary component of a total disability award. 
9
 The relevant text reads:
 
[T]otal disability is defined as disability of
such an extent that the disabled employee has no reasonable
prospect of finding regular employment of any kind in the
normal labor market . . . Permanent partial disability
compensation payments under the law, however, are based
primarily on impairment of physical or mental function and
not on ability for work.
 
27
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Determination of a PPD award, in contrast, compensates the worker
 
not for total loss of income but for partial loss of function,
 either physical function or mental function. Phrased another
 way, a total disability award is ultimately income-based; a
 partial disability award is ultimately function-based. 
A reduced ability to perform one’s pre-injury work
 
activities may indicate a permanent partial loss of function,
 that is, an impairment, and a permanent partial loss of function
 is precisely the kind of loss for which PPD awards compensate the
 injured worker. The fact that the loss of function may be
 manifested in a reduced ability to perform one’s pre-injury work
 activities does not make a PPD award income-based rather than
 function-based. 
Our conclusion is buttressed by the Board’s expertise
 
and experience in this complex field. The LIRAB’s administrative
 adjudications consistently follow the distinction between wage-
based total disability awards and function-based partial
 disability awards. In Belanio, the LIRAB awarded permanent
 partial disability based on claimant Belanio’s inability to
 perform his usual and customary work. Belanio suffered injuries
 to his lower back that prevented him from returning to his usual
 and customary job as an equipment operator. LIRAB Case No. AB

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
2007-532, at 6. The LIRAB stated that “[b]ased on Claimant’s
 
testimony and medical evidence restricting Claimant from
 returning to his usual and customary job, the Board finds that
 Claimant sustained some loss or impairment of physical function.” 
Id. In Ibarra, the LIRAB again awarded PPD where an employee
 
hurt his shoulder at work although -- according to the AMA Guides
 -- he was rated at 0% impairment of his whole person. LIRAB Case
 No. AB 2009-504, at 6. The LIRAB awarded a 2% PPD award based on
 its conclusion that “Claimant’s ability to work, even while [the
 doctor] released Claimant to ‘full capacity’ work, was affected
 by Claimant’s injury” where the claimant changed jobs following
 his injury due to his inability to undertake heavy-lifting
 activities. Id. at 7. 
The LIRAB’s decisions stand for the proposition that a
 
claimant’s inability to perform his or her usual and customary
 work activities legitimately may be considered in determining PPD
 awards, especially where the AMA Guides do not present an
 accurate rating of the full extent of the claimant’s impairment
 or loss of a physical or mental function. Additionally, as
 discussed supra, Cabatbat and Duque support the LIRAB’s
 consideration of work activities, in that each holds that other
 factors outside of a physician’s impairment evaluation may

permissibly affect the determination of a claimant’s PPD award. 
Cabatbat, 103 Hawai' i at 9, 78 P.3d at 764; Duque, 105 Hawai' i at 
439, 98 P.3d at 646.
 
In Ihara’s case, the LIRAB appropriately considered his
 
inability to return to his regular course of work when
 determining his PPD award: 
The Board credits the opinions that Claimant sustained no
ratable impairment. However, Employer’s July 11, 2008 letter
admitted or acknowledged permanent disability, stated that
Claimant was “medically disqualified” for his position, and
 terminated him therefrom. Therefore, the Board finds that
 Claimant sustained permanent partial disability in the amount of
$250.
 
However, the LIRAB awarded Ihara a lump sum of $250
 
without explaining its basis for doing so, when it should have
 
first determined his percentage of impairment and then calculated
 the correct dollar amount of the PPD award according to the
 formula in the statute. HRS § 386-32(a). Thus, although the ICA
 incorrectly interpreted the law in holding that work activities
 cannot play a role in determining PPD awards, it properly vacated
 and remanded the LIRAB’s decision awarding Ihara $250 in PPD.
 
We defer to the LIRAB’s expertise in determining that 
Ihara suffered from a permanent partial disability, and do not substitute our judgment for its judgment concerning that determination. In re Water Use Permit Applications, 94 Hawai' i 
30
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
97, 119, 9 P.3d 409, 431 (2000)(“When mixed questions of law and 
fact are presented, an appellate court must give deference to the agency’s expertise and experience in the particular field. The court should not substitute its own judgment for that of the agency.” (citation, braces, and internal quotation marks omitted)). On the other hand, we find the factual basis for the Board’s awarding Ihara a lump sum of $250 for his PPD insufficient to allow us to discern the steps by which the LIRAB reached that decision. Kauai Springs, 133 Hawai' i at 164, 324 
P.3d at 974 (noting that an “agency’s findings should be ‘sufficient to allow the reviewing court to track the steps by which the agency reached its decision.’” (citation omitted)); Int’l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 68 Haw. at, 328, 713 P.2d at 953 (“A remand pursuant to HRS § 91–14(g) is appropriate if an agency’s findings are incomplete”). 
We therefore remand this matter to the LIRAB to
 
determine the relevant percentage of Ihara’s impairment, as well
 as to determine an award of PPD benefits based on that
 percentage. 
V. CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part the ICA’s
 
vacating of the LIRAB’s March 13, 2012 decision awarding $250 in
 
31
           *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
PPD to Ihara. While we affirm in part, we also correct the ICA’s
 
rationale for vacating and remanding. We leave intact the
 LIRAB’s determination that Ihara suffered some permanent partial
 disability. We vacate only the Board’s $250 lump sum award to
 Ihara, and we remand to the LIRAB for it to determine the
 relevant percentage of Ihara’s impairment, as well as an award of
 PPD benefits based on that percentage.
