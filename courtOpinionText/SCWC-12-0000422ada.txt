RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, AND POLLACK, JJ.,
AND CIRCUIT JUDGE ALM, IN PLACE OF ACOBA, J., RECUSED
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY NAKAYAMA, J.
 
Subject to some restrictions, Hawai
'i Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 378-2.5 (Supp. 2007) allows employers to deny employment 
based on an individual’s conviction record “provided that the conviction record bears a rational relationship to the duties and responsibilities of the position.” In 2007, Petitioner Zak K. Shimose (Shimose) applied for employment as a radiological technician (radtech) at Hawai' i Health Systems Corporation (HHSC) *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
dba Hilo Medical Center (HMC) (collectively HHSC/HMC). HHSC/HMC
 
rejected Shimose’s application based solely on his prior
 conviction for possession with intent to distribute crystal
 methamphetamine. The primary issue in this case is whether, as a
 matter of law, HHSC/HMC established the existence of a rational
 relationship between the radtech position and Shimose’s prior
 drug conviction that would entitle it to summary judgment. We
 hold that it did not. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Shimose was convicted of possession with intent to 
distribute crystal methamphetamine on August 28, 2001, and sentenced to 37 months in prison. While in prison, Shimose completed a bachelor’s degree in philosophy at the University of Hawai'i, Hilo, and began investigating the radtech associates 
degree program at Kapiolani Community College (KCC). Shimose was released on March 7, 2003. 
Shimose matriculated into KCC’s radtech program in
 
August of 2005. As part of the program, Shimose was assigned to
 HMC to complete a clinical rotation at HMC’s imaging department. 
Shortly after the rotation began, HHSC/HMC initiated a
 
suitability investigation into Shimose’s background. HHSC/HMC
 concluded that Shimose’s felony drug conviction disqualified him
 from participating in a clinical rotation at an HHSC facility,
 and removed him from the program. Shimose completed his clinical
 
2
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
requirements at another medical facility and graduated from the
 
radtech program in the spring of 2007. 
Shimose applied for a vacant radtech position at HMC on
 
June 15, 2007, and submitted a second application on July 30,
 2007. In August of 2007, HMC verbally indicated that Shimose
 would not be hired for the radtech position. Shimose submitted a
 request for administrative review with HHSC/HMC on November 1,
 2007. On September 16, 2008, HHSC/HMC sent Shimose a letter
 indicating that he was disqualified from consideration for the
 radtech position because of his conviction for possession with
 intent to distribute a controlled substance. 
Shimose filed a complaint with the Hawai' i Civil Rights 
Commission (Commission) on September 6, 2008, alleging a violation of HRS § 378-2 (Supp. 2007).
1 The Commission 
determined that “the medical center was lawfully entitled to consider [Shimose’s] 2001 felony drug conviction in accordance with HRS § 378-2.5(1), and the conviction disqualified [him] from 
1
 HRS § 378-2 (Supp. 2007) provided then as it does now, in relevant
 
part:
 
(a) It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice:
 
(1) Because of . . . arrest and court record . . . :
 
(A) For any employer to refuse to hire or employ or to
bar or discharge from employment, or otherwise to
discriminate against any individual in compensation or
in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.

the position.”2 The Commission issued a notice of dismissal and 
right to sue letter on August 6, 2009. On October 25, 2009, 
Shimose filed suit in the circuit court alleging violations of HRS § 378-2 and article I, section 5 of the Hawai' i 
Constitution.
3
 
The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment in
 
December of 2011. In its cross-motion for summary judgment,
 HHSC/HMC asserted that the following facts were undisputed: (1)
 Radtechs treat vulnerable patient groups including children,
 geriatrics, and disabled patients; (2) many patients receiving
 treatment are in compromised physical and mental states and/or
 are receiving pain medication; (3) radtechs are often alone and
 unsupervised when imaging patients; (4) radtechs have access to
 patient charts that disclose what medications a patient is
 receiving; (5) radtechs have access to “an array of drugs that
 are not readily available to the public, as well as related
 supplies such as syringes and needles.”
4
 
2 HRS § 378-2.5 (Supp. 2007) provided then as it does now, in
 
relevant part:
 
(a) Subject to subsection (b), an employer may inquire about
and consider an individual’s criminal conviction record
 concerning hiring, termination, or the terms, conditions, or
privileges of employment; provided that the conviction
record bears a rational relationship to the duties and
responsibilities of the position.

 The Honorable Glenn S. Hara presided.
 
4 These facts were supported by the declaration of HMC’s facility
imaging director, Reynold Cabarloc.
 
4
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
With respect to pharmaceutical substances and supplies,
 
HHSC/HMC alleged that radtechs have access to crash carts, drug
 
reaction boxes, and anesthesia carts, and it attached exhibits
 that listed the contents of crash carts and drug reaction boxes.
5
 
HHSC/HMC also asserted that radtechs have access to virtually all
 areas of the hospital, and that many of those areas contain
 stored quantities of drugs and related supplies. 
Based on these factual assertions, HHSC/HMC argued that
 
it was entitled to summary judgment because a rational
 relationship existed between Shimose’s conviction and the duties
 of a radtech. First, although HHSC/HMC did not specify what
 controlled substances a radtech might access, it argued that
 individuals with a felony drug conviction are unfit to handle
 controlled substances. Further, HHSC/HMC argued that individuals
 with a felony drug conviction are unfit to handle the non-
controlled pharmaceuticals that were listed on the exhibits
 attached to the declaration of Reynold Cabarloc, as well as
 syringes and needles. Second, HHSC/HMC argued that individuals
 with a felony drug conviction are unfit to interact with patients
 who are currently taking medicine or are otherwise vulnerable. 
HHSC/HMC stated: “[T]here is an opportunity and risk that a
 
5 The following substances were listed: (1) sterile water, (2)
benadryl, (3) lidocaine, (4) zantac, (5) atropine, (6) aromatic ammonia
inhalant, (7) albuterol inhaler, (8) amiodarone, (9) calcium chloride, (10)
dextrose, (11) dopamine, (12) dopram, (13) epinephrine, (14) phenergan, (15)
sodium bicarbonate, (16) solumedrol, (17) vasopressin, (18) zofran, and (19)
0.9% Bact NS.  
5
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
vulnerable patient, who may be taking prescribed drugs and may be
 
in significant pain, would have their medication taken from them
 and/or would be sold an illegal drug.”
 
Shimose disputed several of the material facts that
 
HHSC/HMC had alleged. First, Shimose disputed that radtechs have
 access to controlled substances and/or areas of the hospital
 where controlled substances are kept. Although Shimose admitted
 that radtechs have access to crash carts and drug reaction boxes,
 he asserted that neither crash carts nor drug reaction boxes
 contain controlled substances. Shimose attached the DEA’s list
 of federally controlled substances to his motion and noted that
 none of the substances contained in crash carts or drug reaction
 boxes appeared on that list. See 21 U.S.C. § 812 (2012); 21
 
C.F.R. §§ 1308.11-1308.15 (2014).
6 Shimose asserted that
 
anesthesia carts do not contain controlled substances and that
 they are locked and controlled by an anesthesiologist at all
 times. Shimose also asserted that all controlled substances at
 HMC are strictly secured in the hospital pharmacy and that
 radtechs do not have access to the pharmacy. Finally, Shimose
 contended that even “non-addictive drugs which are not restricted
 . . . are still strictly locked and supervised.”

Enforcement Admin., Off. Diversion Control, http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/
schedules/#list

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Second, Shimose asserted that radtechs do not have
 
greater access to vulnerable patient groups than visitors to the
 
hospital, and that the level of contact with such groups is equal
 to that of any other profession. Specifically, Shimose asserted
 that radtechs are not often alone with vulnerable patients
 because those patients usually require the assistance of one or
 more additional hospital care workers. Shimose also asserted
 that contact with in-patients does not provide access to
 controlled substances because those substances are administered
 exclusively from authorized sources and are never left unattended
 in an in-patient’s room. Finally, Shimose asserted that radtechs
 never administer controlled substances to patients, and that
 their duties are limited to imaging patients and assisting
 radiologists with special procedures.
7
 
Based on these factual assertions, Shimose argued that
 
the asserted relationship between the duties of a radtech and a
 felony drug conviction was irrationally based on biases and
 prejudices. Shimose argued that HHSC/HMC failed to establish
 that radtechs have access to controlled substances, and that
 there was no rational relationship between a felony drug
 conviction and access to non-controlled substances or supplies. 
7
 Shimose attached HMC’s job announcement for the radtech position
 
and HHSC’s six page radtech job description to his motion for summary
judgment.  These documents indicate that the daily responsibilities of a
radtech include diagnostic imaging and related tasks, but do not include the
administration of controlled substances.
 
7
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Shimose also argued that the asserted connection between his
 
conviction and the risk that vulnerable patients would have their
 medication taken from them and/or be sold an illegal drug was
 tenuous and unduly speculative. At a minimum, Shimose argued
 that issues of material fact surrounding HHSC/HMC’s asserted
 rational relationships would preclude summary judgment in its
 favor. 
On March 28, 2012, the circuit court granted HHSC/HMC’s
 
motion for summary judgment and denied Shimose’s cross-motion for
 summary judgment. The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA)
 affirmed. 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
We review a circuit court’s decision to grant a motion 
for summary judgment de novo under the standard that the circuit court should have applied. Fujimoto v. Au, 95 Hawai' i 116, 136, 
19 P.3d 699, 719 (2001) (citation omitted). “Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n v. Castro, 131 Hawai' i 28, 
41, 313 P.3d 717, 730 (2013) (internal quotations and citations omitted). The evidence must be viewed in the light most 
8
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
favorable to the party opposing summary judgment. See Ralston v. 
Yim, 129 Hawai' i 46, 55-56, 292 P.3d 1276, 1285-86 (2013). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
HRS § 378-2 states: “It shall be an unlawful
 
discriminatory practice . . . [f]or any employer to refuse to
 
hire or employ . . . any individual . . . [b]ecause of . . .
 arrest and court record[.]” However, HRS § 378-2.5 allows an
 employer to disqualify a job applicant based on his or her
 history of conviction, “provided that the conviction record bears
 a rational relationship to the duties and responsibilities of the
 position.” The issue in this case is whether, as a matter of
 law, HHSC/HMC established a rational relationship between
 Shimose’s conviction for possession with intent to distribute
 crystal methamphetamine and the duties and responsibilities of a
 radiological technician at HMC. We hold that it did not. 
A. The Plain Language of HRS § 378-2.5
 
Our foremost obligation in construing a statute is to 
“give effect to the intention of the legislature, which is to be 
obtained primarily from the language contained in the statute itself.” Hanabusa v. Lingle, 119 Hawai' i 341, 349, 198 P.3d 604, 
612 (2008) (internal quotations and citations omitted). In so doing, we are bound to give effect to all parts of a statute, “no clause, sentence, or word shall be construed as superfluous, 
9
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
void, or insignificant.” State v. Kaakimaka, 84 Hawai' i 280, 
289-90, 933 P.2d 617, 626-27 (1997). 
Several guidelines define the statutory phrase 
“rational relationship to the duties and responsibilities of the 
position,” HRS § 378-2.5(a), which we previously interpreted in Wright v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc., 111 Hawai' i 401, 142 P.3d 265 
(2006). As stated in Wright, the rational relationship standard is not coextensive with the ultra-deferential rational basis test that is used in some equal protection cases. See Wright, 111 
Hawai'i at 412 n.9, 142 P.3d at 276 n.9. Accordingly, we decline 
to adopt a standard under which virtually any conceivable state of facts could support an adverse employment decision. Rather, “the standard of rationality . . . must find some footing in the realities of the subject.” Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 321 
(1993). As such, an adverse employment action cannot be justified by an asserted relationship that is so remote or “attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational.” Fitzgerald v. Racing Ass’n of Cent. Iowa, 539 U.S. 
103, 106 (2003) (internal quotations and citation omitted). Negative attitudes toward politically unpopular ex-offenders do not, standing alone, justify adverse employment decisions. Cf. 
City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 446-47 (1985) (stating that a bare desire to harm a politically 
10
     
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
unpopular group is not a legitimate state interest); U.S. Dep’t
 
of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528 (1973) (same).8
 
B. The Legislative History of HRS § 378-2.5
 These guidelines are supported by the legislative
 
history of HRS §§ 378-2 and 378-2.5, which reveals that the
 statutory scheme was tailored to balance competing state
 interests. See Life of the Land, Inc. v. City Council of City &
 
Cnty. of Honolulu, 61 Haw. 390, 447, 606 P.2d 866, 899 (1980)
 (“Courts may take legislative history into consideration in
 construing a statute.”). Here, the legislative history of HRS §
 378-2.5 reveals that the legislature chose language broad enough
 to allow reasonable consideration of a record of conviction, but
 narrow enough to place a meaningful restraint on unlawful
 discrimination. See S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 3282, in 1998
 
Senate Journal at 1331 (“The intent of this bill is to provide a
 balanced disclosure taking into account the interest of the
 employee and the employer.”). 
The fundamental restraint on discrimination against
 
persons with conviction records embodied in HRS § 378-2 was
 passed into law in 1974 to reflect the legislature’s recognition
 “that persons who have been in trouble are not inherently and
 permanently bad and that opportunities afforded other citizens

should be made available to them.” S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 862­
74, in 1974 Senate Journal at 1079. The purpose of HRS § 378-2
 “is to encourage the rehabilitation of convicted persons by
 eliminating disqualification from employment . . . solely by
 reason of a prior conviction of a crime.” Id. (emphasis in
 
original). Convicted persons who are rehabilitated through
 meaningful employment show decreased levels of recidivism.
9
 
In 1998, a bill introduced in the House proposed a
 
dramatic policy reversal by deleting the phrase “court record”
 from HRS § 378-2. This would have allowed employers to consider
 criminal convictions without restraint. The House Standing
 Committee Report accompanying the bill stated: 
The purpose of this bill is to repeal the prohibition
against employment discrimination based upon arrest and
court record. 
. . . .
 Your Committee finds that under current law, it is an
unlawful discriminatory practice in connection with
employment to discriminate on the basis of an individual’s
arrest and court record.  Your Committee believes that the
 rehabilitation of individuals who may have run afoul of the
law is essential to society and that gainful employment is
necessary to the rehabilitative process.  Your Committee is
 concerned, however, that broad prohibitions restricting an
employer’s right to question a person regarding criminal
convictions may compromise the safety of customers and
employees.
 
Upon careful consideration, your Committee has amended this
measure by:

Behav. 1377 (2010).
 
12
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(3) Limiting the prohibition against unlawful discriminatory
practices in employment because of “arrest and court record”
under Section 378-2(1), HRS, to “arrest records”;
 
(4) Adding a new definition of “Arrest record” to Section
378-1, HRS, which definition excludes records of criminal
conviction, thereby effectively providing an exception to
the prohibition against unlawful discriminatory practices in
employment on the basis of an applicant’s or current
employee’s record of criminal conviction
[.]”
 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 673-98, in 1998 House Journal at 1300­
01.
 
The House’s proposal was opposed by the Senate
 
Standing Committee, which issued a report that stated:
 
Your Committee is concerned that this measure will diminish
 
the employment opportunities for individuals who have a
conviction record.  Your Committee believes that it is in
 our State’s best interest to see to it that these
 individuals not be discriminated against in their search for
employment.  Should these individuals be unable to secure
 employment and turn to public assistance or return to a life
of crime, the costs will be borne by the public. 
Your Committee has amended this bill by:
 . . . . 
(2) Inserting a provision to allow employers to inquire
about conviction records, provided that it is done so only
after the employer makes a conditional offer of employment
and that the conviction record bears a substantial
 relationship to the employment duties of the position that
has been offered;
 
(3) Inserting a provision that limits the inquiry to the
past five years; 
(4) Inserting a requirement that the employer shall make an
individualized assessment of the circumstances associated
 with the record of conviction and any evidence of
rehabilitation to determine if the person is suitable for
employment[.]
 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2959, in 1998 Senate Journal at 1207­
08. 
13
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Negotiations came down to the final day, and
 
“agreement on th[e] measure was reached approximately one hour
 
before the deadline.” The resulting compromise, enacted as HRS
 § 378-2.5, allows consideration of a criminal conviction that
 bears a “rational relationship to the duties and
 responsibilities of the position.” The statutory language
 adopted did not embody the House’s proposal to allow unfettered
 consideration of criminal convictions. The legislature also
 rejected the Senate’s proposal for a “substantial relationship”
 standard.
10 An overly broad reading of HRS § 378-2.5 would
 
eviscerate the protections afforded to persons with conviction
 records by HRS §§ 378-2 and 2.5, and render the statutory phrase
 “duties and responsibilities” meaningless. That was not the
 bicameral intent of the enacting legislature.
11
  
10 HRS § 378-2.5 also adopted the Senate’s provision that requires
 
employers to make a conditional job offer before inquiring into conviction
history, but rejected the Senate’s proposal that would have required employers
to make an individualized assessment of the circumstances associated with an
 applicant’s conviction history.  
Another compromise embodied in HRS § 378-2.5 is the ten-year limitation
on an employer’s ability to consider convictions, which is five years longer
than the limitation period that the Senate proposed, but decidedly shorter
than the unlimited consideration proposed by the House.  The limitation
 excludes periods of incarceration. See HRS § 378-2.5(c). 
11
 We decline to adopt an unduly broad reading of “rational 
relationship” based on the remarks of individual House members that wouldundermine the compromise position reached by the legislature in full. See 
Wright, 111 Hawai 'i at 411 n.8, 142 P.3d at 275 n.8 (“Stray comments by
individual legislators, not otherwise supported by statutory language orcommittee reports, cannot be attributed to the full body that voted for thebill.”) (internal quotations and citation omitted); see also Dines v. Pac.Ins. Co., Ltd., 78 Hawai 'i 325, 332, 893 P.2d 176, 183 (1995) (“Statements by
legislators . . . need not reflect the purpose which a majority of thelegislators believed is carried out by [a] statute.”) (internal quotations and

C.	 HHSC/HMC Failed to Establish a Rational Relationship
Between Shimose’s Conviction and the Duties and 
Responsibilities of a Radiological Technician
 
When presented with cross-motions for summary judgment
 
in the context of HRS §§ 378-2 and 378-2.5, the court’s task is
 
11(...continued)
citation omitted)).  For example, the following statements of individual
legislators have no bearing on our interpretation of the phrase “rational
relationship”: 
Representative Tom stated:
 
[T]he ‘rational relationship’ between the job and the
conviction is the lowest standard you can look at.  We took
 that standard because ‘rational’ is a lot lower than
 ‘substantial.’  ‘Rational’ is a lot lower than ‘reasonable.’
 ‘Rational’ is a very, very low and fair relationship to
establish.
 
Representative Yamane stated: 
As far as the example that was given earlier, ‘rational
relationship’, if the person is convicted of theft and the
employer is concerned about the fellow employees, then theft
has a definite bearing because employees that you hire you
don’t want them to steal from your fellow employees and not
only from your own business.  I feel there can be a
 ‘rational relationship’ to most things that crimes would
come under. 
Representative Pendleton stated: 
It would be well for us to remember that our floor debate is
 going to be something that attorneys in the future look to. 
We are creating an official record.  The intent of this
 body, and I just wanted to make it clear that, at least for
my thinking, that I think that pretty much any conviction
would bear a ‘rational relationship’ to job qualifications. 
. . . . 
And so I want the record to clearly reflect that just about
any conviction, I think, if a person cannot live up to therules established by the State of Hawai 'i, the rules which
set forth what is acceptable conduct in our State, if youcannot live up to that and you commit a crime and are dulyconvicted, I think that is going to bear on theemployer/employee relationship.   
H. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 79, in 1998 House Journal at 769-771.  
15
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
two-fold. First, the court must apprise itself of the
 
undisputed material facts relating to the duties and
 responsibilities of the position. In so doing, the court is not
 necessarily limited to duties and responsibilities contained in
 a formal job description. Second, the court must analyze the
 rationality of any relationship that the defendant has asserted
 between the conviction and the employee’s ability to perform his
 or her undisputed job duties.
12 Where factual issues bearing on
 
the rationality of an asserted relationship remain, neither
 party is entitled to summary judgment. 
Here, HHSC/HMC has asserted two rational relationships
 
between Shimose’s conviction and the responsibilities and duties
 of a radtech: (1) That radtechs have access to drugs, syringes,
 needles, and patient charts; and (2) that radtechs work with
 vulnerable patient groups who are at risk of having “their
 medication taken from them and/or [being] sold an illegal
 drug.”
13 Before addressing those relationships, we briefly
 
12 This analysis must be tethered to the nature of the conviction. 
For example, a conviction resulting from elder abuse would bear a rational
relationship to the duties and responsibilities of a position that required
close contact with the elderly, but a drug-related conviction might not.
 
13
 Shimose argues that HHSC/HMC’s asserted rational relationships
 
should be disfavored because they were not introduced in response to his
administrative claim before the HCRC.  Although the defendant has the
responsibility to posit rational relationships that motivated its employment
decision, the nature of those relationships may be asserted for the first time
before the trial court.  Hypothetical relationships that did not, in fact,
motivate an employment decision should be disregarded.
 
16
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
discuss the primary duties and responsibilities of a radtech. 
1.	 The Core Duties of a Radtech
 
Both HHSC’s and HMC’s formal job descriptions indicate
 
that radtechs at HMC are primarily responsible for medical
 
imaging and the preparation and maintenance of medical imaging
 equipment. Other duties include preparing patients for imaging
 and making sure that they are comfortable with the imaging
 process. HMC’s radtechs also process, review, and transmit
 radiographic images. There is no indication that radtechs at
 HMC administer or even assist patients with any type of drugs. 
A felony drug conviction simply has no bearing on an
 individual’s ability to perform the primary imaging duties of a
 radtech at HMC. Accordingly, there is no rational relationship
 between Shimose’s drug conviction and the core duties of a
 radtech at HMC that would have entitled HHSC/HMC to disqualify
 Shimose from prospective employment.
14
 
2.	 Access to Controlled Substances, Non-Controlled
Substances, Syringes and Needles, and Patient Charts
 
HHSC/HMC has contended that its radtechs “have access
 
to an array of drugs and related materials such as syringes and
 needles.” Specifically, HHSC/HMC asserted that radtechs at its
 
14
 Shimose argues that because he obtained licensure in radiology,
 
his suitability for employment with HHSC/HMC cannot be questioned.  However,
the fact that an individual has received licensing and/or professional
certification does not conclusively establish the absence of a rational
relationship between a conviction and the duties and responsibilities of a
position. 
17
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
facility have access to crash carts, drug reaction boxes,
 
anesthesia carts, and hospital storage areas. HHSC/HMC also
 asserted that access to patient charts provides information that
 can be used to divert drugs. 
In this case, HHSC/HMC has not presented undisputed
 
facts that establish a rational relationship between a drug
 conviction and an HMC radtech’s proximity to locked crash carts
 and drug reaction boxes. Although crash carts and drug reaction
 boxes at HMC contain syringes and needles, neither syringes nor
 needles are controlled items. Syringes and needles are readily
 and cheaply available to the public. Furthermore, an HMC
 radtech’s potential access to the non-controlled substances
 contained in crash carts and drug reaction boxes does not bear a
 rational relationship to a drug conviction. There is no reason
 why an employee with a drug conviction would pose a risk because
 he or she has access to, among other things, sterile water,
 Benadryl, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), Zantac, or the other
 substances contained in crash carts and drug reaction boxes. 
None of the drugs in the crash cart or the drug reaction boxes
 at HMC are regulated by the federal Controlled Substances Act,
 and HHSC/HMC presented no rebuttal evidence tending to establish
 that these substances are controlled in any way. See 21 U.S.C.
 
§ 812; 21 C.F.R. §§ 1308.11-1308.15.

Additionally, HHSC/HMC failed to establish the
 
rationality of the relationship between a drug conviction and an
 
HMC radtech’s fitness to handle patient charts as a matter of
 law. HHSC/HMC failed to introduce undisputed material facts
 showing that access to a patient’s chart would lead to access to
 controlled substances. 
Finally, the relationship between a drug conviction
 
and access to controlled substances may prove to be rational in
 this case.
15 Drug diversion is a serious problem at some
 
hospitals, and the risk of diversion may, depending on the
 circumstances, rationally be increased by hiring an individual
 with a conviction for the sale of a controlled substance. 
However, diversion depends on access. See Diversion of Drugs
 
Within Health Care Facilities, 87(7) Mayo Clinic Proc. at 674
 (“[D]ata suggest[s] that ready access is a critical component of
 drug diversion from the health care facility workplace.”). 
Issues of material fact remain surrounding HHSC/HMC’s
 allegations that controlled substances might be present in
 anesthesia carts and storage areas. Issues of material fact
 also remain with respect to whether radtechs at HMC have a level
 of access to anesthesia carts, storage areas, and the hospital

pharmacy that is rationally related to a prior felony drug
 
conviction.16
 
3.	 Interaction With Youthful, Elderly, and Otherwise
Vulnerable Patients
 
HHSC/HMC asserts that there is a rational relationship
 
between a drug conviction and the risk that vulnerable patients
 
might have “their medication taken from them.” Although this
 relationship is somewhat speculative, if an HMC radtech’s
 contact with patients involved a legally significant degree of
 access to controlled substances then it might create a rational
 relationship. However, questions of material fact remain
 regarding how a radtech at HMC could obtain controlled
 substances from a patient in the course of his or her duties. 
HHSC/HMC did not introduce undisputed evidence that its patients
 have physical control over controlled substances that might be
 diverted. HHSC/HMC did not assert that its patients have access
 to quantities of pills, or that several doses of medication are
 ever left out in a patient’s hospital room. HHSC/HMC did not
 assert that its patients bring controlled substances with them
 when undergoing radiographic imaging. HHSC/HMC merely asserted
 that there is a risk that vulnerable patients would have their
 medication taken. In the absence of undisputed material facts
 
16
 Shimose contends that a radtech’s access to hospital areas
 
containing controlled substances does not exceed that of the general public, a
fact that if true would call into question the rationality of HHSC/HMC’s
“access” defense.  
20
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
establishing access, HHSC/HMC was not entitled to summary
 
judgment on this theory. 
Additionally, genuine issues of material fact remain
 
regarding the asserted relationship between Shimose’s felony
 conviction and the risk that vulnerable patients “might be sold
 an illegal drug.” If HRS § 378-2.5 extended so broadly that any
 contact with the elderly or young children created a rational
 relationship to a prior drug conviction, then all individuals
 with prior drug convictions could be disqualified from any job
 that dealt with the public at large. But drug convictions often
 have nothing to do with elder/child abuse, and should not serve
 as a blanket disqualification from employment that requires a
 modicum of interaction with children and the elderly. Such a
 broad discriminatory prohibition would contradict the
 legislative compromise of HRS § 378-2.5. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
In conclusion, the circuit court erred when it granted
 
HHSC/HMC’s motion for summary judgment with respect to Shimose’s
 statutory claim. Accordingly, we affirm in part and vacate in
 part the ICA’s December 23, 2013 judgment on appeal and the
 circuit court’s March 28, 2012 order granting HHSC/HMC’s cross­
21
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
motion for summary judgment, and remand to the circuit court for
 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.17

17 We affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of HHSC/HMC with 
respect to Shimose’s constitutional claim because Shimose cannot establish a
liberty or property interest in prospective employment at HHSC/HMC.  See Minton v. Quintal, 131 Hawai 'i 167, 186, 317 P.3d 1, 20 (2013) (“[M]erely
losing one position in a profession without being foreclosed from reenteringthe field is generally not sufficient to demonstrate an infringement of aliberty interest.” (internal quotations and citation omitted)). 
We also note that pursuant to HRS §§ 378-2.5(d) and 78-2.7(b),
HHSC/HMC qualified for a statutory exception that allowed it to make a pre­offer inquiry into Shimose’s conviction history on its general application
form.
