STATE OF HAWAI I, Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee,

STACY E. HARDOBY, Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant.
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
(CAAP-12-0000514; CASE NO. 2DTC-11-014020) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Stacy E. Hardoby (“Hardoby”) 
seeks review of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (“ICA”) April 
15, 2015 Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its February 
23, 2015 Summary Disposition Order, which affirmed the District 
Court of the Second Circuit’s1 (“district court”) April 27, 2012 
Judgment. The district court adjudged Hardoby guilty of 
Operating a Vehicle after License and Privilege Have Been 
Suspended or Revoked for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence 
of an Intoxicant, in violation of Hawai i Revised Statutes 
§ 291E-62 (2007 & Supp. 2010).  
The Honorable Blaine J. Kobayashi presided. 1

On certiorari, Hardoby contends that the ICA erred in  
holding that the district court properly permitted the State to 
amend the charge against Hardoby to allege the required mens  rea  
for the offense.  Hardoby argues that the defective charge rendered the district court without jurisdiction over the case, 
and, therefore, without jurisdiction to permit the State to 
amend the charge. We disagree. In State v. Schwartz, we 
recently held that  “the failure of a charging instrument to 
allege an element of an offense does not constitute a 
jurisdictional defect that fails to confer subject-matter 
jurisdiction to the district court.”  State v. Schwartz, No. 
SCWC-10-199, 2015 WL 7370086, at *21  (Haw. Nov. 19, 2015).  
Accordingly, the ICA correctly concluded that the district court 
properly permitted the State to amend the charge.  
IT IS 
HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s Judgment on A ppeal is 
affirmed.
