CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(CAAP-12-0000535; CIV. NO. 99-1856-05)
 
ORDER ACCEPTING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI, VACATING IN
PART INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS’ JUDGMENT ON APPEAL AND
 
REMANDING TO INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
On August 20, 2013, Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellee 
Mathew S. Mickelson (Mickelson) filed an application for a writ of
 
certiorari seeking review of the June 21, 2013 judgment of the
 Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), including the ICA’s June 20,
 2013 Order Approving Request for Appellate Costs. Mickelson raises
 the following points of error: (1) the ICA erred in deciding
 attorneys’ fees were not awardable under HRS § 431:10-242 for
 arbitration after a lawsuit was required to compel the insurer’s
 participation in the arbitration; and (2) the ICA erred by awarding
 costs pursuant to Rule 39 of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure where no prevailing party was established. 
On June 28, 2013, after the ICA filed its judgment, we 
issued an opinion in Hawaiian Ass’n of Seventh-Day Adventists v. 
Wong, 130 Hawai' i 36, 305 P.3d 452 (2013), which is applicable to 
the second issue raised by Mickelson. In light of the Seventh-Day Adventists opinion, we conclude the ICA should further consider the award of appellate costs in this matter. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for a writ of
 
certiorari is accepted.
 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the June 21, 2013 judgment as
 
it relates to the Order Approving Request for Appellate Costs is
 vacated in part, and this case is remanded to the ICA to reconsider
 its Order Approving Request for Appellate Costs in light of the
 opinion issued in Seventh-Day Adventists, supra. The judgment is
 affirmed in all other respects.
