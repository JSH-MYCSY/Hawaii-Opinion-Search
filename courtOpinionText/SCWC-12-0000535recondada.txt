MATHEW S. MIKELSON,
Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellee,
 
vs.
 
UNITED SERVICES AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION,
Respondent/Defendant-Appellant. 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(CAAP-12-0000535; CIV. NO. 99-1856-05)
 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR PARTIAL RECONSIDERATION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellee
 
Mathew S. Mikelson’s Motion for Partial Reconsideration of
 
Amended Order Accepting Application for Writ of Certiorari,
 
Vacating in Part Intermediate Court of Appeals’ Judgment on
 
Appeal and Remanding to Intermediate Court of Appeals (Motion),
 
filed on October 11, 2013, the documents attached thereto and the
 
record, it is noted that generally a motion for reconsideration
 
of an acceptance of an application for writ of certiorari would
 
be dismissed. See Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) 
Rule 40.1(h). 
However, in light of the nature of the court’s October
 
3, 2013 amended order accepting Mikelson’s application for writ
 of certiorari, the Motion was considered pursuant to HRAP Rule
 
40(a). Accordingly, based upon consideration of the Motion under
 
HRAP Rule 40(a),
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 18, 2013.
