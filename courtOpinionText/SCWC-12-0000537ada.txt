was convicted following a jury trial of assault in the second 
degree.  The prosecutor made at least eight improper statements 
during closing argument

2 himself.  The only witnesses to the 
incident at the time of the 
injury were Conroy and his wife (hereinafter CW).   Therefore,  
in the circumstances of this case, the violation of Conroy’s due 
process right to a fair trial was not harmless  beyond a 
reasonable doubt.   
I. Factual Background 
A.  Circuit Court Proceedings 
  Conroy was indicted for assault in the first degree in 
violation of HRS § 707-710(1) (1993), in connection with an 
incident involving 
CW.  At trial , CW testified that she was 
married to Conroy on the date of the incident and that they were 
CW, on March 14, 2011, she and Conroy had an argument in their 
apartment parking lot; they were struggling over her Camaro car 
keys when Conroy punched her in the face with both of his fists, 
and CW lost consciousness.  CW testified that she could not 
recall the number of times she was struck because she lost 
consciousness.  CW also testified that she did not recall 
hitting Conroy prior to Conroy’s first punch, and that she did 
not kick Conroy prior to being punched.  CW  further stated that 2living together in an apartment in Kīhei, Maui.   According to 1
                     
 1  HRS § 707 -710(1) (1993) provides:  “A person commits the offense 
of assault in the first degree if the person intentionally or knowingly 
causes serious bodily injury to another person.”  
 
2  The Honorable Richard T. Bissen, Jr. presided.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
3 on the day of the incident she was 5'9" and weighed 120 pounds, 
and that Conroy was 6'4" or 6'5" and weighed 240 or 250 pounds.    
  When CW was asked if she told a police officer that 
she slapped Conroy once on his left temple, CW  stated, “I guess.  
I guess that’s what I told him.”   The State entered into 
evidence a photo of CW  six months before the incident, and a 
photo of CW  taken in April 2011 after the incident.  CW 
testified that the two photos demonstrated that her smile was 
different as a result of the incident, and that she can “only 
smile with half [of her] face [because of] the injuries.”   CW 
also stated that she has had nightmares about the incident, 
which have clouded “[her] memorie s of the exact things that 
happened on [the day of the incident].”  
  Dr. Andrew Don (“Dr. Don”) , who supervised CW’s 
follow-up treatment, testified that eight days after the 
incident, CW ’s left cheek and nose were swollen, her eyes were 
swollen and possibl y bloodshot, and that she had a “chip 
fractured on the front of her teeth.”  He further testified that 
CW’s nose was fractured on both sides, and that her cheekbone 
was also fractured and bruised on the left side.  Dr. Don also 
testified that because of CW ’s swelling, a large blood clot was 
coagulating on that side of her face, causing scarring and 
restricting the movement of her face.  According to Dr. Don, 
CW’s condition could be permanent, and surgery would not make *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
4 any difference.  He also stated that 
CW’s injuries were caused 
by at least two “full– force [blows] from the fist.”  
  Officer William Melton (“Officer Melton”) , who 
responded to the incident, testified that CW  appeared to be 
dazed, and had a swollen face, swollen eyes, some blood to the 
left side of her eye, and some cuts on her body.  Officer Melton 
stated that Conroy waived his right to remain silent, and 
recounted Conroy’s statement as follows:  
Basically, [Conroy] stated that he suspected his 
girlfriend, [CW], was fooling around.  [Conroy] saw 
some things in the car that she wanted to drive off 
in.  And further, [Conroy] believed that [CW] was 
going to be with another man, and they fought over a 
set of keys to the Camaro that [CW] wanted to use. 
[Conroy] got struck to the left side of his temple he 
said, and then he responded by punching [CW] twice to 
the face.    
 
Officer Melton also testified that Conroy told him 
that when he punched CW  twice in the face, she was knocked 
backwards onto the hood of the Camaro.   Officer Melton stated 
that Conroy indicated that he had injuries to the left side of 
his temple where he had been struck, and that there was a “red 
linear marking, kind of purplish on the left side of [Conroy’s] 
temple.”  According to Officer Melton, Conroy did not complain 
of any other injuries, such as being kicked in the groin.  
Officer Melton further testified that if Conroy told him that he 
had been kicked in the groin, then he would have indicated it in 
his report because “[a]nytime a guy gets kicked in the groin, 
that’s an attention grabber.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
5   Jon Brammer (“Brammer”) , CW’s and Conroy’s neighbor, 
testified that immediately after the incident, CW  looked like 
she “had hit her head on the steering wheel” in an auto 
accident.  Brammer testified that at that time, CW  was arguing 
and swearing at Conroy, and Conroy was verbally defending 
himself.  Brammer testified that CW  said, “You hit me,” and 
Conroy replied, “Well, you hit me.”  Brammer also testified that 
Conroy stated that “[ CW] asked for it[,]” and that he heard 
Conroy say to CW , “[Y]ou know you had it coming,” and “[D]on’t 
tell me you didn’t deserve it.”  The State then rested its case.  
  The defense then presented its case, and recalled 
Brammer, who testified about a 2010 incident that occurred at 
his home, where CW was allegedly drunk and lying down on the 
floor.  According to Brammer, CW  did not want to be moved, and 
when Conroy attempted to pick CW  up, she “thrashed out” and 
kicked Conroy’s hand twice.  
  Conroy testified on his own behalf at trial.  At the 
beginning of Conroy’s testimony, he was asked about a previous 
incident in 2009 involving an argument with CW .  He testified 
that CW hit him on the side of his head at least three times 
with a television remote control, knocking out his tooth.   
  Conroy testified that on the day of the incident, the 
nature of his relationship with CW  was “more of a roommate *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
6 situation,” and that CW “did her own thing and was in her own 
room, [and] chose not to do anything with [him] in any sense.”  
CW asked him to move his truck and when he approached 
his truck, he saw his personal items in the back seat of the 
Camaro.  Conroy thought that CW  “was trying to rub something in 
[his] face, that she could do what she liked with whatever.”  He 
began to take his personal items from the Camaro and put them on 
the hood of his truck and in the empty adjacent parking stall.   
In response, CW retrieved the items and put them back into the 
Camaro.
  CW then yelled at him, accusing him of acting childish.  
In response, Conroy told CW , “I’m done b eing disrespected. . . .  
I’m done. . . .  I just -- I want you to leave.  I want you to 
leave.  Just please give me the keys.”  
  
He asked CW  to give him the keys to the truck, house, 
mailbox, and Camaro because he owned them all.3  CW swore at him, 
and taunted him by asking, “These keys?” and “yanked” the keys 
back when he attempted to take them.  He asked CW to give him 
the keys several more times, and CW  then kicked him in the 
groin, causing him to bend over.  I mmediately after he was 
kicked, CW hit him on his head on the left side of his temple.   
He then punched CW twice in the face, causing her to fall back 
on the Camaro.  When he tried to help CW  onto her feet, she was 
                     
 3  CW had testified that the Camaro was jointly owned by 
Conroy and herself.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
7 dazed and fell to the ground, and he testified that he was 
“scared,” “shaken,” and thought, “oh my God, I’ve got to get 
help.” 
When Officer Melton arrived at the scene, Conroy 
started to explain that CW  was his wife, and then explained that 
he guessed that CW was “more of a friend now.”  He informed 
Officer Melton that he had injuries to his head and groin.  On 
cross-examination, Conroy also testified that he re- broke the 
metacarpal bone of his little finger when he punched CW.  
  On rebuttal, CW  testified that approximately a year 
before the incident in the instant case, Conroy accused her of 
having a “man’s name in [her] contact list” in her phone, and an 
argument ensued.  According to CW , Conroy punched her in the 
side of the face or head with a fist, and “grabbed [her] by the 
throat and neck and began to squeeze,” ma king it difficult for 
CW to breathe. 
  In the State’s closing argument, the prosecutor sought 
to persuade the jury that Conroy’s intent was not to defend 
himself but to manifest his anger and jealousy by making “ sure 
that she didn’t give that smile to any other man [.]”  The 
prosecutor’s argument was objected to by Conroy’s counsel  three 
times, however the court sustained only one objection and did *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
8 not strike the improper comment, allowing the two other 
statements over the defense’s objections :4 
 [PROSECUTOR:]  Their marriage was going down.  
[CW] no longer gave the Defendant nature’s smile, so 
he was going to make sure that she didn’t give that 
smile to any other man, and she won’t.  She can’t.  
 He was going to teach her a lesson, a lesson 
that she would never, could never forget, a lesson 
she would remember every time she looked in a mirror.  
Look at [CW’s]  eyes.  What do you see in those eyes?  
Resignation, defeat, a woman that’s learned her 
lesson.  We should teach her a new lesson.  I say we 
teach her that there is justice in the world.  I say 
we teach her that there can be justice in this –- 
 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  Your Honor, I would just object.  
Passion, prejudice.  
 
THE COURT:  Sustained, counsel.  
 
 . . . . 
 
[PROSECUTOR]:  Whatever we do here, we’re not going 
to put nature’s smile back on [CW’s]  face, but you 
can put the smile back in her eyes.  What is justice 
in this case?  It’s finding the Defendant guilty of 
the crime that he committed.   Holding him accountable 
for the full extent of what he did.  As a community, 
you come together to formally agree on what he did to 
make a judgment on his actions.  The actions he took 
on March 14, 2011 and what he did on March 14, 2011 
was assault in the first degree.  
 
 . . . . 
 
 So, therefore, what I began in this -- at this 
portion, what is justice?  Justice is going to be 
returning a verdict where that box is checked where 
as to assault in the first degree, you’ll find him 
guilty as charged.  
 
 Consider that, you know, when Defendant broke 
[CW’s] face, when you look at the way she testified, 
consider her demeanor, the pictures of her after the 
scene.  He broke something inside of her as well.  
 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  Your Honor, objection.  Passion, 
prejudice . 
                     
 4  The prosecutor’s statements that are at issue on appeal are 
underlined. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
9  
THE COURT:  I’ll allow this.  
 
[PROSECUTOR]:  We all want [CW’s]  spirit to heal even 
if her face won’t.  But in order for that to happen, 
there has to be justice done.  
 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  Your Honor, same objection.  
 
THE COURT:  So noted, Counsel.  
 
[PROSECUTOR]:  Give [CW] the justice that she needs.  
Give her the justice she deserves.  Most importantly, 
give the Defendant the justice that he deserves.  
Find him guilty of assault in the first degree.  Now, 
there’s going to be -- I would leave with you I think 
we should be curious about whether the Defendant can 
explain two things.   
 One, how does a man who has been kicked 
directly on his right testicle bent over in 
excruciating pain deliver two power punches strong 
enough to break [CW’s] left cheek,  shatter her nose 
and send her 120 -pound body flying onto the hood of 
the Camaro?  Explain that.  Explain also why there 
were no tears on the Defendant’s face when he was 
testifying.   
 
  In Conroy’s closing argument, defense counsel argued 
that CW kicked C onroy in the groin, and then as he bent over, CW  
punched him in his temple.  I n response to CW ’s kick, Conroy 
threw two unaimed punches that were not planned, or conducted in 
retaliation, and were instead for self- defense and to get away 
from CW.  When Conroy realized where he had hit CW , he was 
scared and tried to help her.  Defense counsel told the jury 
that CW was not a credible witness, and that Conroy, even though 
“he had no duty to testify,” told the truth and was credible.  
  In the State’s rebuttal argument, the prosecutor again 
asked the jury to find that Conroy’s intent was to hurt CW, not 
to defend himself.  Defense counsel objected three times; the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
10 court sustained two objections and instructed the jury to 
disregard the improper statements twice:  
[PROSECUTOR]:  You break my heart, I break your face.  
That’s what this case is about.  
 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  Your Honor, I would just object.  
Passion and prejudice.  
 
THE COURT:  All right.  Sustained.  
 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  Move to strike.  
 
THE COURT:  So ordered. The jury will disregard.  The 
Court will order that last statement struck.  
 
 . . . . 
 
 Now, as far as the defense counsel’s statement 
that Defendant’s testimony was the more credible one, 
why then were there no tears on his face?  When he 
was feigning his emotion about, you know, this 
situation and trying to get his keys and frustration 
and then feeling sorry for her after he had hit her.  
And he’s making this crying face.  Why were there no 
tears?  That has not been explained.  
 
 The statement itself, you’ll behold as far as 
credibility, you can consider the probability or 
improbability of a person’s statement.   You know, 
when -- in direct examination of the Defendant, 
defense counsel tried to say in asking him, okay, you 
were kicked on the right side or it was off to the 
side, but in cross -examination, he made it pretty 
clear, that, no, it was a hit to my right testicle.  
If it was a kick to his right testicle and he was 
bent over in excruciating pain, he would not have 
been able to hit anybody. 
 
 I think that’s part of, certainly for the guys 
here -- 
 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  Your Honor, I would just object, 
improper opinion.  
 
THE COURT:  Sustained.  
  
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  Move to strike.  
 
THE COURT:  Stricken. The jury will disregard the 
last remark made by the attorney.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
11   The jury found Conroy guilty of assault in the second 
degree under HRS § 707- 711 (Supp. 2010),5 which was the lesser 
included offense of assault in the first degree for which Conroy 
was indicted.  On May 2, 2012, the circuit court entered its 
Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence, sentencing Conroy 
to sixty days of imprisonment and five years of probation, with 
credit for time served.  The court stayed the jail sentence 
pending appeal. 
B.  ICA Proceedings  
  
Conroy appealed to the ICA, arguing that many of the 
statements the prosecutor made during closing argument and 
rebuttal closing argument constituted misconduct.  Conroy 
broadly contended that the prosecutor’s statements contained a 
“stream of characterizations offered to raise and inflame the 
passions of the jury,” which were not based on evidence adduced 
at trial, and that the prosecutor r epeatedly used “I” to insert 
personal opinion, misstated evidence, and that the error was not 
harmless.  Accordingly, Conroy argued that his conviction should 
                     
 5  HRS § 707 -711(1)(a)- (b) (Supp. 2010) provides in pertinent part:  
(1) A person commits the offense of assault in the 
second degree if:  
 
 (a) The 
person intentionally, knowingly, or 
recklessly causes substantial bodily injury to 
another; [or]  
 
(b) The person recklessly causes . . . substantial bodily 
injury to another[.]  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
12 be reversed, or in the alternative, vacated and remanded for a 
new trial. 
 
 The State argued that the prosecutor’s statements did 
not constitute misconduct because they properly urged the jury 
to hold Conroy responsible for his actions and were reasonable 
inferences drawn from the evidence.  The State further argued 
that even assuming the alleged improper statements constituted 
misconduct, they were harmless.  
  In a summary disposition order, the ICA determined 
that only one of the prosecutor’s statements constituted 
misconduct:  “You break my heart, I break your face.  That’s 
what this case is about.”   State v. Conroy, No. CAAP -12-0000537, 
2016 WL 3524605, at *15 (App. June 27, 2016)(SDO).  However, the 
ICA concluded that any related error was harmless.  Id.  Thus, 
the ICA affirmed the circuit court’s Judgment of Conviction and 
Probation Sentence.   Id.  The ICA filed its Judgment on Appeal 
on July 22, 2016.   
II.  Standard of Review 
  “Allegations of prosecutorial misconduct are reviewed 
under the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard, which 
requires an examination of the record and a determination of 
whether there is a reasonable possibility that the error 
complained of might have contributed to the conviction.”  State 
v. Rogan, 91 Hawai ʻi 405, 412, 984 P.2d 1231, 1238 (1999) *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
13 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)(quoting State 
v. Sawyer, 88 Hawai ʻi 325, 329 n.6, 966 P.2d 637, 641 f.6 
(1998)). 
“Prosecutorial misconduct warrants a new trial or the 
setting aside of a guilty verdict only where the actions of the 
prosecutor have caused prejudice to the defendant’s right to a 
fair trial.”  State v. McGriff, 76 Hawai ʻi 148, 158, 871 P.2d 
782, 792 (1994).  “In order to determine whether the alleged 
prosecutorial misconduct reached the level of reversible error, 
[the appellate court considers] the nature of the alleged 
misconduct, the promptness or lack of a curative instruction, 
and the strength or weakness of the evidence against defendant.”  
State v. Agrabante, 73 Haw. 179, 198, 830 P.2d 492, 502 (1992). 
III.  Discussion  
A. At Least Eight of the Prosecutor’s Statements During 
Closing Argument and Rebuttal Were Improper.  
 
 “The term ‘prosecutorial misconduct’ is a legal term 
of art that refers to any improper action committed by a 
prosecutor, however harmless or unintentional.”  State v. Udo, 
145 Hawai ‘i 519, 
534, 454 P.3d 460, 475 (2019).  Allegations of 
prosecutorial misconduct are first reviewed to determine whether 
the prosecutor’s actions were improper,  and violated the accused *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
14 citizen’s right to a fair trial.6  If so, t he court must then 
determine whether the violation of the right to a fair trial was 
harmless.  State v. Tuua, 125 Hawai
ʻi 10, 14, 250 P.3d 273,  277 
(2011).  
 Having reviewed the proceedings of the trial afforded 
Defendant Conroy, it is apparent the prosecutor committed 
misconduct at least eight times in violation of Conroy’ s right 
to a fair trial — specifically during closing argument.7   
 First, the prosecutor asserted  that Conroy  “was going 
to make sure that [CW ] didn’t give that smile to any other man, 
and she won’t.  She can’t.”  
 Second, the prosecutor told the jury “ we should teach 
her a new lesson.  I say we teach her that there is justice in 
the world.  I say we teach her that there can be justice in 
this. . . .” 
 Third , the prosecutor told the jury they were to find 
Conroy guilty to “ put the smile back in her eyes. ” 
 Fourth, the prosecutor asked the jury to consider that 
Conroy “broke something inside of [CW.]”  
                     
6  See State v. McGhee, 140 Hawaiʻ i 113, 123 f .10, 398 P.3d 702, 712
n.10 (2017) (“The district court in this case plainly erred when it allowed 
the prosecutor to read in closing argument Kearney’s 252 Statement, which was
not in evidence.  This error affected McGhee’s substantial rights because it 
severely compromised McGhee’s right to a fair trial .”).  
 
 
 7  The Dissent agrees that all eight statements were improper.  
Dissent at 2. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
15  
Fifth, the prosecutor noted the jury’s purpose was to
heal CW’s spirit:  “ We all want [CW ’s] spirit to heal even if 
her face won’t.  But in order for that to happen, there has to 
be justice done.”
   
  Sixth , the prosecutor repeated his admonition to the 
jury — previously ruled improper by the trial court - that its 
purpose was to provide justice to CW in order to heal her:  “We 
all want [CW’s] spirit to heal even if her face won’t.   But in 
order for that to happen, there has to be justice done. ” 
 Seventh , the prosecutor asserted that  “You break my 
heart, I break your face.  That’s what this case is about.”  
  A nd eighth, the prosecutor injected personal knowledge 
about the pain caused by a kick to the groin.  
1.  FIRST STATEMENT  
 
 The statement that Conroy “was going to make sure that 
[CW] didn’t give that smile to any other man, and she won’t.  
She can’t[,]” improperly encouraged jurors to sympathize with 
CW, and to consider the effects of CW’s injuries on her future 
relationships and quality of life.  Rogan , 91 Haw aiʻi 
at 414, 984 
P.2d at 1240 (“the statement that the incident was ‘ every 
mother's nightmare ,’ . . . was a blatantly improper plea to 
evoke sympathy for the Complainant's mother and represented an *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
16 implied invitation to the jury to put themselves in her 
position
”).8 
2. SECOND STATEMENT 
  The prosecutor next improperly informed the jury that 
its purpose was to provide justice to CW : 
[Conroy] was going to teach [CW] a lesson, a lesson 
that she would never, could never forget, a lesson 
she would remember every time she looked in a mirror.  
Look at [CW’s] eyes.  What do you see in those eyes?  
Resignation, defeat, a woman that’s learned her 
lesson.  We should teach her a new lesson.  I say we 
teach her that there is justice in the world.  I say 
we teach her that there can be justice in this--. 
 
(Emphasis added). 
  The trial c ourt sustained Conroy ’s objection on the 
grounds that it inflamed the passions and prejudice of the jury, 
that it was not based on evidence, and that the prosecutor 
improperly inserted personal opinion by using the terms, “I” and 
“we.” 
  T he prosecutor’s statement was clearly improper.  In 
State v. Apilando, this court held that it was improper for the 
prosecutor to request that the jury “send a message to the 
community that [the defendant’s] actions were wrong and would 
not be tolerated.”  79 Hawai ʻi 128, 141 -43, 900 P.2d 135, 148 -50 
(1995).  This court reasoned that as a result of this “send a 
                     
8  The Dissent parses Rogan to diminish the importance of prosecutorial 
misconduct deemed “blatantly improper” by this cou rt in Rogan:  namely, an 
appeal to the sympathy of the jury to place themselves in the position of the 
mother of the complaining witness who alleged sexual assault.  Dissent at 5.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
17 message” statement, “there [was] a significant risk that the 
jury might find the defendant guilty simply based on its view 
that the conduct the defendant [was] accused of committing [was] 
intolerable, even though it ha[d] not been proved beyond a 
reasonable doubt.”  Id. at 142 -43, 900 P.2d 149- 50.   
Here, the statement encouraged the jury to teach CW  
that justice exists, which could have “divert[ed] the jury from 
its duty to decide the case on the evidence.”  Id. at 149, 900 
P.2d at 142 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); 
see State v. Mars, 116 Hawai ʻi 125
, 143, 170 P.3d 861, 879 (App. 
2007)(finding that the prosecutor’s comment that “[t]his 
community is measured by how we treat its weakest members” was 
improper because it “appeared to invite the jury to base its 
verdict on considerations other than the evidence in the case”) ; 
United States v. Weatherspoon, 410 F.3d 1142, 1149 (9th Cir. 
2005)(“A prosecutor may not urge jurors to convict a criminal 
defendant in order to protect community values, preserve civil 
order, or deter future lawbreaking.  The evil lurking in such 
prosecutorial appeals is that the defendant will be convicted 
for reasons wholly irrelevant to his own guilt or innocence.” )  
(quoting United States v. Koon, 34 F.3d 1416, 1443 (9th Cir. 
1994)). *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
18 The prosecutor also improperly sought to add the 
imprimatur of his office by asking the jury to join him to teach 
CW a lesson and provide justice to CW:   “We should teach [CW ] a 
new lesson.  I say we  teach [CW] that there is justice in the 
world. . . .  Whatever we  do here, we’re not going to put 
nature’s smile back on [ CW’s] face.”   (Emphasis added).   The 
prosecutor’s use of the inclusive pronoun, “we,” implied that 
the jury and the State had similar interests and were working 
together in convicting Conroy to provide CW  justice.  This 
implication of unity, and the suggestion of an alliance between 
the State and the jury against Conroy, was improper:   
In light of the “prestige associated with the 
prosecutor’s office” and the “significant persuasive 
force” the prosecutor’s argument is likely to have on 
the jury, this court has repeatedly recognized that 
the prosecutor “has a duty to seek justice, to 
exercise the highest good faith in the interest of 
the public and to avoid even the appearance of unfair 
advantage over the accused.”  
State v. Basham, 132 Hawai ʻi 97, 116, 319 P.3d 1105,  1124 (2014) .  
3. THIRD STATEMENT
The prosecutor then continued his improper request to  
the jury by advising them to find Conroy guilty in order to put  
a smile in CW’s eyes:  “Whatever we do here, we’re not going to 
put nature’s smile back on [CW]’s face, but you can put the 
smile back in her eyes.  What is justice in this case?  It’s 
finding the Defendant guilty of the crime that he commi tted.”  
The implication to the jury was that a just verdict is one of *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
19 guilt that would allow CW to smile again.   Again the jury was 
diverted from their duty to decide the case based on the 
evidence in order to consider a verdict that would make the CW 
smile.  See e.g., State v. Klinge, 92 Hawai
‘i 577, 592, 994 P.2d
509, 524 (2000) (“the prosecutor's remark could have ‘ divert[ed]
the jury from its duty to decide the case on the evidence, by 
injecting issues broader than the guilt or innocence of the 
accused under the controlling law.’” ).   
 
4. FOURTH STATEMENT
The improper appeal to the jury to make a decision to 
demonstrate to CW sympathy for her injuries was compounded by 
subsequent statements from the prosecutor:   “Consider that, you 
know, when [Conroy] broke [ CW’s] face, when you look at the way 
she testified, consider her demeanor, pictures of her after the 
scene.  [Conroy] broke something inside of her as well.”   Conroy 
objected to these statements on the basis of “passion, 
prejudice”.  The court overruled the objection, stating, “I’ll 
allow this.” 
The prosecutor’s statement s improperly appealed to the 
passions of the jury, encouraging jurors to make a decision 
based on their sympathies towards CW and to consider any 
emotional injuries that she suffered.  Rogan, 91 Hawai‘i at 414, 
984 P.2d at 1240.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
20 5.  FIFTH AND SIXTH STATEMENTS   
 
 Next, the prosecutor again improperly sought to 
persuade the jury to make a decision based on their sympathy for 
injuries CW suffered and the duty to help her heal :  “We all 
want [CW’s] spirit to heal even if her face won’t.  But in order 
for that to happen, there has to be justice done.”  Conroy 
objected to this statement as an appeal to passion and 
prejudice.  The court responded, “So noted, Counsel.”  
We conclude the statement was improper because, viewed 
in context, it was calculated to “divert the jury from its duty 
to decide this case based on the evidence[.] ”  Apilando, 79 
Hawaiʻi at 149, 9
00 P.2d at 142.  T he prosecutor requested that 
the jurors provide justice to help heal CW ’s spirit, which could 
have encouraged them to make their decision based on sympathy 
for CW or a need to exact retribution on Conroy rather than on 
the evidence.  
6.  SEVENTH STATEMENT 
  After defense counsel’s closing argument, the 
prosecutor began his rebuttal closing argument by stating:  “You 
break my heart, I break your face.  That’s what this case is 
about.”  Conroy objected to this statement on the basis of *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
21 passion and prejudice, and the court sustained the objection, 
struck the statement, and instructed the jury to disregard it.9    
  W e agree with the ICA that this  statement improperly  
referred to facts not in evidence.   Conroy, 2016 WL 3524605, at 
*8. 
7.  EIGHTH STATEMENT 
  Thereafter,  the prosecutor sought to provide 
additional evidence to the jury based on his personal experience 
that if Conroy were kicked in the testicle, he would not have 
been able to strike CW : 
The statement itself, you’ll behold as far as 
credibility , you can consider the probability or 
improbability of a person’s statement. . . .  If it 
was a kick to [Conroy’s] right testicle and he was 
bent over in excruciating pain, he would not have 
been able to hit anybody.  I think that’s part of, 
certainly for the  guys here --   
 
Conroy objected to this statement on the basis of improper 
opinion, and the court sustained the objection, struck the 
statement, and instructed the jury to disregard it.   
  T he statement was improper.  The prosecutor was 
beginning to comment on his personal knowledge of the amount of 
pain a kick to the groin would have caused when he stated, “I 
think that’s part of, certainly for the guys here  --[.]”  While 
                     
 9  The ICA recognized that this statement constituted prosecutorial 
misconduct when it found no evidentiary support for the statement by the 
prosecutor:  “You break my heart, I break your face.  That’s what this case 
is about.”   Conroy, 2016 WL 3524605, at *8.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
22 comments based on the testimony regarding the alleged kick to 
Conroy’s groin would have been proper, the prosecutor’s comment 
regarding his personal knowledge of the severity of pain a man 
experiences when kicked in the groin was improper.  Tuua, 125 
Hawaiʻi at 12, 250 P.3d at 275 (holding that the prosecutor 
engaged in misconduct by stating to the jury during closing 
arguments, without supporting evidence, that the defendant’s 
brother could be convicted of perjury for testifying that he, 
rather than his brother Tuua, committed the offense.); cf. State 
v. Nofoa, 135 Hawai ʻi 220, 227 -30, 349 P.3d 327, 334-37 (2015) 
(holding that it was error for the court to instruct the 
prosecutor that evidence could be offered to the jury during the 
state’s rebuttal argument) . 
B. Prosecutorial Misconduct Affecting  the Issue of Defendant’s 
Intent Was Not Harmless Beyond a Reasonable Doubt Where the 
Only Witnesses to the Altercation W ere the Defendant and 
the CW. 
 
As noted, a three- part test is applied to determine 
whether prosecutorial misconduct is harmless.  “In order to 
determine whether the alleged prosecutorial misconduct reached 
the level of reversible error, [the appellate court considers] 
the nature of the alleged misconduct, the promptness or lack of 
a curative instruction, and the strength or weakness of the 
evidence against defendant.”  Agrabante 73 Haw. at 198, 830 P.2d 
at 502.  The standard the prosecution must meet to prove the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
23 violation of an accused’s constitutional right to a fair trial 
was harmless is whether “there is a reasonable possibility that 
error might have contributed to conviction.  If there is such a 
reasonable possibility in a criminal case, then the error is not 
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and the judgment of 
conviction on which it may have been based must be set aside.”   
 State v. Holbron, 80 Hawaiʻi 27, 32, 904 P.2d 912, 917 (1995).  
The nature of the misconduct committed by the 
prosecutor was one of repeated improper appeal to the jury to 
find Conroy guilty based on sympathy for CW and the need to heal 
her — and to improperly call for the jury to deliver justice not 
based on the facts, but on the need to provide revenge in the 
form of a guilty verdict.   Eight times improper statements were 
made to the jury.  In particular , the prosecutor continued to 
improperly explain to the jury that they should  provide justice 
to CW after the court had previously sustained the objection to 
those same arguments .  
The nature of the misconduct included a statement to 
the jury that lacked any evidentiary support.  The prosecutor 
ascribed to the Defendant the statement “You  break my heart, I 
break your face.”  As the Intermediate Court acknowledged,  there 
was no evidence to support the prosecutor’s claim that Conroy  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
24 “had this thought
[.]”10  However, the assertion constituted
support for the State’s theory that Conroy acted out of jealousy  
to injure CW — rather than to defend himself.11
At the close of trial, the court provided the jury 
with a one sentence instruction to disregard stricken 
statements:  “Instruction number 4, you must disregard entirely 
any matter which the Co urt has ordered stricken.”  The trial 
court’s curative instructions  to disregard the evidence stricken 
by the court were insufficient to cure the risk of prejudice to 
Conroy because “the cumulative effect of prejudicial conduct 
going to the issue of guilt is so strong that it overcomes the 
presumption that the curative remarks of the court have rendered 
10The ICA explained:  
The nature of the statement was improper, however, 
because it was phrased in the first -person point of view —
You break my heart, I break your face —as though Conroy 
either spoke those words or had this thought at some time.  
Yet Conroy never testified that he intended to hurt CW; he 
was not asked, and did not disclose, his emotions regarding 
the divorce or ending relationship, nor did he tell the 
jury anything to support an inference that his actions were 
premeditated (although other witnesses seemed to attribute 
that type of sentiment to him).  Accordingly, it might be 
said that “the statement[] diverted the jury from its duty 
to decide the instant case on the evidence” before it.  
Conroy, 2016 WL 3524605, at *11 (internal citations omitted).  
11The Dissent appears to conflate the fact that some evidence 
supports a characterization that Conroy was jealous that CW was seeing 
another man with the improper introduction of false evidence in the closing 
argument in support of this theory .  Dissent at 6.  Jealousy was indeed the 
motive argued by the prosecutor as a basis for the jury to reject Conroy’s 
claim of self- defense.  The ICA found that the prosecutor committed 
misconduct by making the false statement:  “You break my heart, I break your 
face”—a statement that improperly bolstered the governm ent’s theory and 
contradicted Conroy’s assertion of self -defense.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
25  the prejudicial remarks harmless.”12  State v. Pemberton, 71 
Haw. 466, 476, 796 P.2d 80, 85 (1990)(holding that the 
cumulative effect of prejudicial prosecutorial misconduct was so
pervasive that it overcame the presumption that limiting 
instructions by the trial court could render the prejudicial 
remarks harmless); see also Klinge, 92 Hawai‘ i at 596, 994 P.2d 
at 528 (“We recognize that there are situations in which[] 
although no single prosecutorial act deprive[s] Defendant of a 
fair trial, the cumulative effect of the prosecutor's improper 
conduct [can be] so prejudicial as to deny him [or her] a fair 
trial.”).  
The first two factors relevant to a determination of 
harmless error weigh in favor of a finding that the error was 
harmful:  (1) the prosecutorial misconduct was protracted, 
repeated, and extensive in nature; and 
(2) the trial court ’s 
attempts to cure the 
effects of the misconduct were 
insufficient. 
Under the third factor, the strength of the evidence, 
an error is harmful when  “there is a reasonable possibility that 
the error complained of might have contributed to the 
conviction.”  State v. Pauline, 100 Hawai ‘i 356, 378, 60 P.3d 
12The trial court sustained four objections to the prosecutor’s 
improper statements to the jury, but in only two instances struck the 
evidence and instructed the jury to “disregard the l ast remark by the 
attorney[.]”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
26  
(. . . continued)  306, 328 (2002) (cit
ations and internal quotation omitted); 
Nofoa, 135 Hawai‘ i at 229, 349 P.3d at 336.  Of significance to a 
determination of the strength of the prosecution’s case is that 
there were no witnesses to the altercation other than Conroy and 
CW.13  The credibility of Conroy’s claim that his intent was to 
protect himself when he hit CW was dependent on whether CW 
slapped him in the face and kicked him in the groin.  Their 
testimony was the only evidence presented as to whether CW used 
force against Conroy.  
Conroy’s testimony was that he reacted “[without] a 
thought”14 to protect himself after being kicked in the groin and 
slapped by the CW.15  The force of the kick was sufficient to 
                     
 13  See Rogan at 415, 984 P.2d at 1241 ( “With regard to the third 
factor in determining prosecutorial misconduct, this case essentially turned 
on the credibility of two witnesses —the Complainant and Rogan.  There were no 
independent eyewitnesses or conclusive forensic evidence in this case.  
Instead, the prosecution’ s case against Rogan depended heavily on the 
Complainant's testimony.  Given that Rogan denied having committed any of the 
acts for which he was charged, this case was based on the Complainant’ s 
version of the events ag ainst Rogan’s version.  Under these circumstances, we 
cannot say that the evidence of criminal conduct against Rogan was 
overwhelming.”) (footnote omitted).  
 
14  The Dissent focuses on  the statement “ [without] a thought” to 
conclude Conroy could not have acted to protect himself.  As noted, the full 
record provides the jury  with ample evidence to support a finding that his 
reaction was to protect himself  and that he did so in the immediacy of being 
struck. Dissent at 11.  
 
15  The Dissent cites State v. Culkin, 97 Hawaiʻ i 206, 216, 35 P.3d 
233, 243 (2001), for the proposition that self -defense is not applicable 
where the Defendant is reckless in believing the use of force is necessary or  
in acquiring information material to justify its use .  Dissent at 12.   Culkin 
is instructive. The Culkin court held that under the applicable statutes 
self-defense is available when the defendant's subjective belief is 
objectively reasonable.   Id.  Thus, the court found that the defendant’s  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
27  
(. . . continued)  cause him to experience pain 
that made him bend over.  While 
bent over, he was slapped in the face.  After being slapped, he 
quickly threw two “unaimed” punches  that caused the CW’s 
injuries.  CW’s previous act of violence , as testified to by 
Conroy, in which the CW struck him three times in the head with 
a television remote with sufficient force to break his tooth,  
constitutes further corroboration of his self- defense claim.  
Conroy’s testimony constituted evidence upon which a reasonable 
juror might have found he acted in self-defense.16   
The strength of the evidence in support of self-
defense, the protracted nature of the prosecutorial misconduct,17 
                     
(continued . . . )  
 
claim of self- defense was not preluded although he was charged with reckless 
manslaughter. Id.  As in Culkin, the determination of the applicability of 
self-defense in this case was for the jury .   
 
16  The Dissent argues that the evidence against Conroy was “so 
overwhelming that there is no reasonable possibility his conviction was due 
to the prosecutor’s improper statements” because “there is no dispute that 
Conroy punched [CW] in the face — Conroy testified that he did so, not once, 
but twice.”  Dissent at 14, 16.  While it is not disputed that Conroy punched 
CW in the face, Conroy’s conviction turned on whether he acted in self -
defense.  Therefore, the proper inquiry under the third prong of the 
Agrabante test considers the evidence related to Conroy’s self -defense claim.  
As discussed supra, the question of whether Conroy acted in self -defense was 
dependent on the jury’s evaluation of the conflicting testimony of Conroy and 
CW.  Conroy testified that he reacted without  thought to protect himself 
after being kicked in the groin, the pain caused  him to b end over  and while 
bent over he was slapped in the face, and that he quickly threw two unaimed 
punches that caused the CW’s injuries .  The evidence presented to the jury 
clearly did not overwhelmingly refute self -defense, as also reflected in the 
court providing instruction to the jury on this defense.  
 
17  The Dissent asserts that unlike three cases involving 
prosecutorial misconduct, Rogan, 91 Hawaiʻ i 405, 984 P.2d 1231,  Basham,  132 
Hawaiʻi 97, 319 P.3d 1105,
 and Mainaaupo, 117 Hawaiʻi 235, 117 P.3d 1 (2008), 
in the instant case “ the prosecutor's improper statements did not refer to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
 
28 and the ineffective curative instructions of the court cause us 
to conclude that the misconduct was not harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt.  See State v. Pasene, 144 Hawaiʻ i 339, 364, 439
P.3d 864, 889 (2019) (holding that prosecutorial misconduct may 
provide grounds for a new trial if the prosecutor’s actions 
denied the defendant a fair trial).   
IV.  Conclusion 
The ICA’s July 22, 2016 judgment on appeal and the 
circuit court’s May 2, 2012 judgment are vacated, and the case 
is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings.

that Conroy was guilty, misstate the law, or comment on the defendant ’s 
decision not to testify, ” and therefore the prosecutorial misconduct “did not 
prejudicially affect [Conroy's] substantial rights. ”  Dissent at 4 -6.  With 
respect, nothing in our jurisprudence limits the situations where 
prosecutorial misconduct warrants a new trial to th e specific circumstances 
listed by the Dissent.  In this case, the critical test for whether the 
prosecutorial misconduct is harmless is whether it can be concluded beyond a 
reasonable doubt that the misconduct may have contributed to the conviction.  
As discussed supra, there is a reasonable possibility that the misconduct 
might have affected the jury’s deliberations.
