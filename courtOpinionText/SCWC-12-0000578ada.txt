OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J.  
 
Petitioner/Defendant- Appellee Manaiakalani N.K. Kalua 
(Kalua) was concurrently cited for speeding and excessive 
speeding offenses while driving through two separate speed 
zones.  This case addresses the issue whether the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals (ICA) erred in holding that the entry of Electronically Filed

 judgment on Kalua’s noncriminal speeding infraction failed to 
bar the Respondent/Plaintiff-App ellant State of Hawaiʻi (State) 
from prosecuting him for the crime of excessive speeding.  Kalua 
contends that his prosecution for excessive speeding is barred 
2by Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 701- 109(1) and (2)  (2007) 
and by the double jeopardy clauses of the United States and 
Hawaiʻi Constitutions.   We hold that double jeopardy is 31
                     
 1 HRS § 701 -109(1) provides:  
When the same conduct of a defendant may establish an 
element of more than one offense, the defendant may be  
prosecuted for each offense of which such conduct is an 
element.  The defendant may not, however, be convicted of 
more than one offense if:  
 
(a) One offense is included in the other, as defined in 
 subsection (4) of this section;  
(b) One offense consists only of a conspiracy or 
 solicitation to commit the other;  
(c) Inconsistent findings of fact are required to 
 establish the commission of the offenses;  
(d) The offenses differ only in that one is defined to 
 prohibit a designated kind of conduct generally and 
 the other to prohibit a specific instance of such 
 conduct; or  
(e) The offense is defined as a continuing course of 
 conduct and the defendant’s course of conduct was 
 uninterrupted, unless the law provides that specific 
 periods of conduct constitute separate offenses.  
 2 HRS  § 701 -109(2) provides in relevant part:  
[A] defendant shall not be subject to separate trials for 
multiple offenses based on the same conduct or arising from 
the same episode, if such offenses are known to the 
appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the 
commencement of the first trial and  are within the  
jurisdiction of a single court.   
3  The fifth amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees that 
“[n]o person shall . . . be subject for the same offence to be twice put in 
jeopardy of life or limb[.]”  U.S. Const . amend. V.  Likewise, the Hawaiʻi 
 
(. . . continued)  _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_

 inapplicable to the civil offense of speeding under its current 
statutory framework.  We also hold Kalua is subject to 
prosecution for both excessive speeding and speeding; however, 
if on remand the District Court of the Third Circuit (district 
court) finds at trial that the excessive speeding charge arises 
from the same conduct as the speeding infraction, the “lesser 
included offense” provision of HRS § 701 -109(1)(a) will preclude 
his conviction for excessive speeding.  We thus affirm the ICA’s 
judgment vacating the district court’s dismissal of the 
excessive speeding offense, but for the reasons stated herein, 
and the case is remanded to the district court for further 
proceedings. 
I. Background 
 A. Stipulated Facts 
On September 14, 2011, Kalua was cited for speeding, 
in violation of HRS § 291C
-102,4 and for excessive speeding, in 
violation of HRS § 291C- 105.5  On November 28, 2011, Kalua paid 
                                                                  
(continued . . .) 
 
Constitution provides that  “[n]o person shall . . . be subject for the same 
offense to be twice put in jeopardy[.]”  Haw. Const. art. 1, § 10.  
 4  HRS § 291C -102 (2007) provides in relevant part that “[a] person 
violates this section if the person drives . . . [a] motor vehicle at a speed 
greater than the maximum speed limit other than provided in section 291C -
105.”  HRS § 291C- 102(a)(1).  
 5  HRS § 291C -105 (2007) provides in relevant part, as it did at the 
time of the offense, that “[n]o person sha ll drive a motor vehicle at a speed 
 
(. . . continued)  _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_

 the $137 fine for the speeding infraction after a default 
judgment was entered against him in the district court.  On 
January 5, 2012, in the district court, Kalua pled not guilty to 
the charge of excessive speeding.  Kalua subsequently filed a 
motion to dismiss the excessive speeding charge pursuant to HRS 
§ 701-109(2).  
At the April 19, 2012 hearing6 on the motion to dismiss 
the excessive speeding charge, the parties agreed to stipulate 
to the following relevant facts:  (1) the citing police officer, 
Thomas Koyanagi, used radar to measure Kalua’s speed at a 
“steady speed of 73 miles per hour while entering a 45 miles per 
hour zone”;  (2) Officer Koyanagi observed Kalua pass two 40 
miles per hour signs; and (3) Officer Koyanagi subsequently 
stopped Kalua and cited him for driving 71 miles per hour in a 
55 miles per hour zone in violation of HRS § 291C -102(a)(1)7 and 
for driving 73 miles per hour in a 40 miles per hour zone in 
                                                                  
(continued . . .) 
 
exceeding . . . [t]he applicable state or county speed limit by thirty miles 
per hour or more.”  HRS § 291C -105(a)(1).  The statute further provides, as 
it did at the time of the offense, “[a]ny person who violates [HRS § 291C-
105] shall be guilty of a petty misdemeanor[.]”  HRS § 291C -105(c). 
6 The Honorable Melvin Fujino presided.  
 7 The district court’s finding of fact No. 3 incorrectly states 
that Kalua was cited for traveling 73 miles per hour in a  55 miles per hour 
zone.  DC Dkt. 9/26/12 “Amended Order Granting Deffendant’s [sic] Motion to 
Dismiss Excessive Speeding Charge Under HRS § 701 -109(2)” at 2. _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
5 
 violation of HRS § 291C- 105(a)(1).  Additionally, the parties 
agreed that “at no tim e was there a break in the occurrence from 
the time that . . . Officer Koyanagi saw [Kalua] to the time 
[Kalua] stopped and was cited.  And he was issued both tickets 
upon that stop.” 
  The district court granted Kalua’s motion to dismiss 
the excessive speeding charge.  The court determined that the 
speeding infraction was a lesser included offense of excessive 
speeding.  Because  Kalua had paid the fine for the speeding 
infraction, the court reasoned that prosecuting him for the 
excessive speeding charge would violate HRS § 701- 109(1)(a), 
which prohibits the State from convicting a defendant “ of more 
than one offense” if one offense “is included in the other.”  
The court thus found that HRS § 701-109(1)(a) barred the State 
from prosecuting Kalua on the excessive speeding charge.  The 
court further found that the double jeopardy clause barred the 
State from prosecuting Kalua on the excessive speeding charge.  
  The district court’s order granting Kalua’s motion to 
dismiss the excessive speeding charge was filed on May 21, 2012, 
and later amended on September 26, 2012.  In the amended order, 
the district court cited HRS § 701- 109(2) in concluding that the 
State was barred from prosecuting Kalua on the excessive 
speeding charge.  The district court explained that Kalua’s _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
6 
 conduct consisted of “the operation of his vehicle at a speed in 
excess of the applicable speed limit,” and concluded that his 
conduct “constituted a single episode.”  The court therefore 
concluded that prosecution of the excessive speeding offense was 
barred because HRS § 701- 109(2) bars separate trials for 
offenses based on the same conduct or arising from the same 
episode. 
 B. ICA Proceedings  
  In its opinion, the ICA vacated the district court’s 
order granting Kalua’s motion to dismiss and remanded the case 
for proceedings consistent with its opinion.  State v. Kalua, 
136 Hawaiʻi 181, 189, 358 P.3d 750, 758 (App. 2015).  The ICA 
held that the prior adjudication of Kalua’s speeding infraction 
fails to bar the State from subsequently prosecuting Kalua for 
the crime of excessive speeding.  Id. at 184-86, 358 P.3d at 
753-55.  In the ICA’s view, HRS § 291D -3(d) (2007) “eliminates 
any bar to criminal prosecution that could otherwise arise from 
the separate adjudication of non-criminal traffic 
infractions[,]”  and “permit[s] prosecution of a criminal offense 
where the adjudicated traffic infraction is a lesser included 
traffic infraction of the charged cr ime.”  Id. at 186, 358 P.3d 
at 755.  The ICA also concluded that double jeopardy did not bar 
subsequent prosecution for excessive speeding because double _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
7 
 jeopardy only prohibits successive criminal prosecutions, and 
therefore did not apply to the prior civil adjudication for the 
speeding infraction.  Id.  at 187-89, 358 P.3d at 756- 58. 
II. Standards of Review 
 A. Constitutional  Law 
  “This court reviews questions of constitutional law de 
novo under the right/wrong standard and thus exercises its own 
independent judgment based on the facts of the case.”  State v. 
Curtis, 139 Hawaiʻi 486, 492, 394 P.3d 716, 722 (2017) (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted). 
 B. Statutory Interpretation  
Statutory interpretation is “a question of law 
reviewable de novo .”  State v. Levi, 102 Hawaiʻi 282, 285, 75 
P.3d 1173, 1176 (2003) (internal quotation marks and citations 
omitted).  Statutory construction is guided by established 
rules: 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.  
Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning.  Third, implicit in the task of 
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself.  Fourth, when 
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness 
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an 
ambiguity exists.

(citation omitted). _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_

  C. Conclusions of Law  
  “A trial court’s conclusions of law are reviewed de 
novo under the right/wrong standard.”  State v. Adler , 108 
Hawaiʻi 169, 174, 118 P.3d 652, 657 (2005) (citation omitted). 
III. Discussion 
  Kalua raises a single issue:  does the prior 
adjudication of his civil traffic offense of speeding bar the 
State from subsequently prosecuting Kalua for the criminal 
traffic offense of excessive speeding?  See  HRS § 291C-102 
(penalizing speeding); HRS § 291C- 105 (penalizing excessive 
speeding). 
  Kalua contends the prior adjudication under HRS § 
291C-102 prevents subsequent prosecution for excessive speeding 
under HRS § 291C- 105, and advances three arguments in support of 
his contention.  First, he argues that the State cannot 
prosecute him on the excessive speeding charge because HRS § 
701-109(1)(a) bars convicting a defendant of multiple offenses 
where one offense is included in the other.  Having been 
convicted of the lesser offense of speeding, he argues, he 
cannot later be prosecuted for the greater offense of excessive 
speeding as well, given that both were committed in the same 
course of conduct.  Second, Kalua argues that HRS § 701- 109(2) 
imposes a compulsory joinder requirement barring successive _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
9 
 trials for multiple offenses arising from the same conduct.  In 
other words, he argues the State was required to prosecute both 
offenses together.  Under this analysis, Kalua contends that 
because the speeding charge had already been adjudicated, the 
State was barred under HRS § 701- 109(2) from prosecuting him in 
a later trial on the excessive speeding charge.  Third, Kalua 
argues that the double jeopardy doctrine bars the State from 
prosecuting him for both speeding and excessive speeding.   
  The State contends that it may prosecute Kalua for 
excessive speeding even though the speeding infraction he 
committed during the same course of conduct has been 
adjudicated.  According to the State, HRS § 291D- 3(d) expressly 
prevents HRS § 701- 109 from barring subsequent prosecution of a 
criminal traffic offense, such as excessive speeding, when a 
prior civil traffic offense committed during the same course of 
conduct has already been adjudicated.  Second, as to the 
compulsory joinder requirement of HRS § 701- 109(2), the State 
argues that the statute applies only if both offenses are known 
to the prosecuting officer at the time the first trial begins, 
and that was not the case here.  Finally, the State stresses, 
double jeopardy applies only to successive criminal trials, not 
to a civil adjudication followed by a criminal trial. _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
10 
   
We begin by examining the double jeopardy doctrine and 
conclude it is not applicable.  We then consider the State’s 
arguments that HRS § 291D- 3(d) precludes traffic offenses from 
the prohibitions contained in HRS § 701- 109 regarding separate 
prosecutions and multiple convictions.  We hold that HRS § 291D-
3(d) precludes the compulsory joinder requirement contained in 
HRS § 701-109(2) in the context of traffic infractions.  
Accordingly, Kalua can be prosecuted separately for speeding and 
excessive speeding.  However, we also conclude that HRS § 291D-
3(d) does not preclude a
pplicability of HRS § 701- 109 regarding 
lesser included offenses.8  Thus, Kalua cannot be convicted of 
speeding and excessive speeding if both offenses involve the 
same conduct pursuant to HRS § 701- 109(1), as speeding is a 
lesser included offense of excessive speeding pursuant to HRS §§ 
701-109(1)(a) and 701-109(4). 
 A. The Double Jeopardy Clause Does Not Bar Kalua’s 
Prosecution for Excessive Speeding  
“Double jeopardy protects individuals against:  (1) a 
second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2) a 
second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and 
(3) multiple punishments for the same offense.”  State v. Higa, 
79 Hawaiʻi 1, 5, 897 P.2d 928, 932 (1995).  Kalua argues that the 
                     
 8 HRS §§ 701-109(1)(a) and 701- 109(4). _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
11 
 double jeopardy clauses of the U.S. and Hawaiʻi Con
stitutions bar 
the State from prosecuting the excessive speeding charge.  The 
ICA rejected Kalua’s argument by concluding that because the 
double jeopardy clause only bars successive criminal 
prosecutions and multiple 
criminal  punishments, the prior 
adjudication of Kalua’s noncriminal speeding infraction did not 
act as a bar to the State’s subsequent prosecution for excessive 
speeding.  Kalua, 136 Hawaiʻi at 186 –89, 358 P.3d at 755 –58.  We 
agree. 
  In Tauese v. State, Dep’t of Labor & Indus. Relations , 
113 Hawai ʻi 1, 31, 147 P.3d 785, 815 (2006), we adopted “ a two-
part inquiry for determining whether a statutorily defined 
penalty is civil or criminal:”  (1 ) whether the legislature 
intended the penalty to be civil or criminal and, if so,  (2) 
“whether the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose 
or effect as to negate that intention.”  (Citation omitted).  
Taken together, these factors clearly support the conclusion 
that the sanctions imposed for speeding are a civil remedy 
rather than a criminal punishment.  See id. at 31- 32, 147 P.3d 
at 815-16. 
  With respect to (1), whether the legislature intended 
the penalty to be civil or criminal, here, the punishment for 
speeding is purely monetary:  maximum fines of up to $200 for a _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
12 
 first violation, $300 for a second violation within one year, 
and $500 for a third violation within one year, or community 
service in lieu of a monetary assessment at the court’s 
discretion based on inability to pay.  See  HRS §§ 291D-9  (2007), 
291D-10 (2007), and 291C-161 (2007 & Supp. 2008).   Thus, the 
sanctions imposed for Kalua’s speeding violation did not 
constitute a criminal punishment.  Accordingly, criminal 
prosecution for Kalua’s excessive speeding charge is not barred 
under the double jeopardy clause by the default judgment entered 
on his noncriminal speeding offense.  9
 B. HRS § 291D- 3(d) Precludes Applicability of the  
Compulsory Joinder Provision of HRS § 701 –109(2) in the Context 
of Traffic Offenses, but Does Not Provide an Exception to the 
Provision in HRS § 701 –109(1) 
  Because we have concluded that Kalua’s potential 
prosecution for excessive speeding is not barred by the d
ouble 
jeopardy clauses of the U.S. or Hawaiʻi Constitutions, we turn to 
the statutory provisions relevant to whether he can be 
prosecuted and convicted for excessive speeding as well as 
speeding.  Kalua argues that the State cannot prosecute him on 
the excessive speeding charge because HRS § 701-109(1)(a) bars 
convicting a defendant of multiple offenses where one offense is 
                     
 9  Our discussion in Section III.B below regarding the 
decriminalization of traffic infractions through Chapter 291D further makes 
clear that the legislature intended that the penalties for ordinary speeding 
under HRS § 291C- 102 be civil in nature.  _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
13 
 included in the other.  Having been convicted of the lesser 
offense of speeding, he argues, he cannot later be prosecuted 
for the greater offense of excessive speeding as well, given 
that both were committed in the same course of conduct.  Second, 
he argues that HRS § 701- 109(2) imposes a compulsory joinder 
requirement barring successive trials for multiple offenses 
arising from a continuing course of  conduct.  
  The State contends that it may prosecute Kalua for 
excessive speeding even if the speeding infraction he committed 
is a lesser included offense committed during the same course of 
conduct.  According to the State, HRS § 291D- 3(d) expressly 
prevents HRS § 701- 109 from barring subsequent prosecution of a 
criminal traffic offense, such as excessive speeding, when a 
prior civil traffic offense committed during the same course of 
conduct has already been adjudicated.  Thus, while HRS § 701 -
109(1)(a) forbids convicting a defendant of both a lesser 
included offense and the greater offense, the State argues HRS § 
291D-3(d) creates an exception to that rule.  Second, the State 
rejects Kalua’s argument that prosecuting him for excessive 
speeding would violate the compulsory joinder requirement of HRS 
§ 701-109(2); the State contends that HRS § 291D- 3(d) precludes 
the operation of all provisions in HRS § 701- 109 in the traffic 
offense context, including the compulsory joinder requirement. _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
14 
   Plai nly, the arguments advanced by both the State and 
Kalua turn on the meanings of HRS §§ 701- 109 and 291D -3(d) and 
how they interrelate.  We turn to the State’s argument that HRS 
§ 291D-3(d)10—precluding the compulsory joinder provision of HRS 
§ 701-109(2)—al so precludes application of HRS § 701- 10911 
                     
 10  HRS § 291D -3(d) states that “[i]n no event shall section 70 1 -109 
preclude prosecution for a related criminal offense where a traffic 
infraction committed in the same course of conduct has been adjudicated 
pursuant to this chapter.”   (Emphasis added ).
 
 11  HRS § 701 -109 provides: 
 
 (1) When the same conduct of a defendant may 
establish an element of more than one offense, the  
defendant may be prosecuted for each offense of which such  
conduct is an element.  The defendant may not, however, be  
convicted of more than one offense if:  
 
(a) One offense is included in the other, as defined in 
 subsection (4) of this section;  
(b) One offense consists only of a conspiracy or 
 solicitation to commit the other;  
(c) Inconsistent findings of fact are required to 
 establish the commission of the offenses; 
(d) The offenses differ only in that one is defined to 
 prohibit a designated kind of conduct generally and 
 the other to prohibit a specific instance of such 
 conduct; or  
(e) The offense is defined as a continuing course of 
 conduct and the defendan t’s course of conduct was 
 uninterrupted, unless the law provides that specific 
 periods of conduct constitute separate offenses.  
 
 (2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this 
section, a defendant shall not be subject to separate 
trials for multiple offenses based on the same conduct or 
arising from the same episode, if such offenses are known 
to the appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the 
commencement of the first trial and are within the 
jurisdiction of a single court.  
 
 (3) When a defendant is charged with two or more 
offenses based on the same conduct or arising from the same 
episode, the court, on application of the prosecuting 
attorney or of the defendant, may order any such charge to 
 
(. . . continued)  _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
15 
 barring multiple convictions “[w]hen the same conduct of a 
defendant may establish an element of more than one offense[.]”  
HRS § 701-109(1).  As we explain more fully below, HRS § 291D-
3(d) preempts only HRS § 70
1-109(2) relating to compulsory 
joinder, not, inter alia, HRS § 701-109(1)(a) barring conviction 
for a greater offense as well as its lesser offense.  
  HRS § 701- 109(2), the “compulsory joinder” provision, 
generally prevents the State from exposing a defendant to 
separate trials for separate offenses when the multiple charges 
arise from the same conduct or episode.  It is the only 
provision of HRS § 701- 109 that prevents multiple prosecutions 
“[w]hen the same conduct of a defendant may establish an element  
of more than one offense[.]”  HRS § 701 -109(1).  Under HRS § 
                                                                  
(continued . . .) 
 
be tried separately, if it is satisfied that justice so 
requires.  
 
 (4) A defendant may be convicted of an offense 
included in an offense charged in the indictment or the 
information.  An offense is so included when:  
 
(a) It is established by proof of the same or less than 
 all the facts required to establish the commission of 
 the offense charged;  
(b) It consists of an attempt to commit the offense 
 charged or to commit an offense otherwise included 
 therein; or  
(c) It differs from the offense charged only in the 
 respect that a less serious injury or risk  of injury 
 to the same person, property, or public interest or a 
 different state of mind indicating lesser degree of 
 culpability suffices to establish its commission.  _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
16 
 701-109(2), the separate offenses must generally be joined or 
consolidated in a single trial. 
 (2) Except as provided in subsection (3) of this 
section, a defendant shall not be subject to separate 
trials for multiple offenses based on the same conduct or 
arising from the same episode, if such offenses are known 
to the appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the 
commencement of the first trial and are within the 
jurisdiction of a single co
urt.[12] 
 
See State v. Akau, 118 Hawaiʻi 44, 46, 185 P.3d 229, 231 (2008) 
(referring to HRS § 701 –109(2) as a “compulsory joinder” statute 
and stating that it requires joinder of all criminal offenses 
“based on the same conduct or arising from the same episode”); 
State v. Keliiheleua, 105 Hawaiʻi 174, 181, 95 P.3d 605, 612 
(2004) (noting that HRS § 701 –109(2) reflects “a policy that all 
charges that arise under one episode be consolidated in one 
trial so that a defendant need not face the expense and 
uncertainties of multiple trials based on essentially the same 
episode” (citation omitted)); Model Penal Code and Commentaries 
§ 1.07 cmt. at 116 (Am. Law Inst. 1962) (“Subsection (2) is 
designed to prevent the state from subjecting a defendant to 
separate trials based on essentially the same conduct.  It 
requires the prosecution to join in one trial all offenses based 
                     
 12  As its opening clause indicates, the compulsory joinder provision 
of HRS § 701- 109(2) will not apply if a court finds that justice requires 
separate trials.  “When a defendant is charged with two or more offenses 
based on the same conduct or arising from the same episode, the court, on 
application of the prosecuting attorney or of the defendant, may order any 
such charge to be tried separately, if it is satisfied that justice so 
requires.”  HRS § 701 -109(3). _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
17 
 on the same conduct or arising from the same criminal episode.  
The penalty for failure to do so is a bar to further prosecution 
. . . .”). 
  In 1993, the legislature made an exception to the 
compulsory joinder provision of HRS § 701- 109(2) to provide for 
a bifurcated (or two- track) system featuring separate procedural 
tracks for processing civil and criminal traffic offenses.  
In response to a request by the legislature, the judiciary 
prepared a report in 1987 that recommended, among other 
things, further decriminalization of traffic offenses, 
elimination of most traffic arraignments, disposition of 
uncontested violations by mail, and informal hearings where 
the violation or the proposed penalty is questioned.  The 
legislature finds that further decriminalization of certain 
traffic offenses and streamlining of the handling of those 
traffic cases will achieve a more expeditious system for 
the judicial processing of traffic infractions.  
 
HRS § 291D -1 (2007).  See also 1993 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 214, § 1 
at 365 (“The purpose of this Act is to improve the system by 
which traffic offenses presently are being processed in order to 
dispose expeditiously of these cases and thereby achieve 
efficient and effective use of limited judicial and law 
enforcement resources.”).  Under the then -new system, civil 
traffic offenses could be processed on one track, while the 
generally more complex criminal traffic offenses could be 
processed on a different track, thereby creating a 
“streamlin[ed]” and “more expeditious system for the judicial 
processing of traffic infractions.”  HRS § 291D -1. _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
18 
  
 HRS § 291D- 3(d)13 was therefore a necessary piece of 
the two-track structure.  HRS § 291D- 3(d) negates the Penal 
Code’s general compulsory joinder provision (HRS § 701-109(2)) 
in the specific context of civil and criminal traffic offenses 
committed in the same course of conduct.  That, in turn, allows 
the successive prosecutions envisioned by the two
-track system 
for processing a civil traffic offense and a criminal traffic 
offense arising out of the same course of conduct.14  
  Thus, the ICA correctly concluded that HRS § 291D-3(d) 
“eliminates any bar to criminal prosecution that could otherwise 
arise from the application of HRS § 701 –109(2),” that is, from 
the application of HRS § 701– 109’s compulsory joinder provision.  
Kalua, 136 Hawai ʻi at 186, 358 P.3d at 755 (emphasis added); see 
also HRS § 701–109(2) (requiring that defendants “not be subject 
to separate trials for multiple offenses based on the same 
conduct or arising from the same episode if such offenses are 
                     
 13 HRS § 291D -3(d) provides that “[i]n no event shall section 701 -
109 preclude prosecution for a related criminal offense where a traffic 
infraction committed in the same course of conduct has been adjudicated 
pursuant to this chapter.”  
 14 The two- track system allows separate processing of a civil 
traffic offense and a criminal traffic offense arising out of the same course
of conduct.  But consistent with its underlying purposes of streamlining and 
efficiency, the two- track system also allows a single trial of both types of 
offenses where they arise out of the same course of conduct.  HRS § 291D -2 
(2007) (authorizing a “[c]oncurrent t rial . . . in which the defendant is 
tried simultaneously in a civil case for any charged traffic infraction and 
in a criminal case for any related criminal offense, with trials to be held 
in one court on the same date and at the same time”).  See also HRS § 291D-
13(d) (2007).   _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
19 
 known to the appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the 
commencement of the firs t trial[,]” except under certain 
circumstances). 
  While we agree that HRS § 29 1D-3(d) specifically 
precludes application of the compulsory joinder provisions of 
HRS § 701– 109(2), HRS § 291D-3(d) does not have a generally 
preclusive effect on every provision of HRS § 701 –109.  
Specifically, HRS § 29 1D-3(d) does not have a preclusive effect 
on the provisions of HRS § 701–109(1), including those governing 
lesser included offenses. 
  HRS § 291D- 3(d), by its terms, applies only to HRS § 
701–109(2).  “In no even t shall section 701-109 preclude 
prosecution  for a related criminal offense where a traffic 
infraction committed in the same course of conduct has been 
adjudicated pursuant to this chapter.”  HRS § 291D -3(d) 
(emphases added).  The other provisions of HRS § 701–109, in 
contrast, apply by their terms not to prosecutions but to 
convictions :  “The defendant may not . . . be convicted of more 
than one offense if:  (a) [o]ne offense is included in the other  
. . . .”  HRS § 701 –109(1)(a) (emphasis added).  As we stated in  
State v. Yokota , 143 Hawaiʻi 200, 207, 426 P.3d 424, 431 (2018),  
“the Legislature explicitly provided that a defendant may be  
charged with multiple offenses arising from the same conduct _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
20 
 even when he or she cannot be convicted of more than one 
offense.”  (Emphases in original) (citing HRS § 701-109(1)).  
 
 Stated differently, HRS § 291D- 3(d) authorizes civil 
traffic offenses15 to be adjudicated prior to criminal traffic 
                     
 15 The dissent contends that because the 1993 amendment to the 
Traffic Code described speeding as a non -criminal “infraction,” speeding is 
no longer an “offense”:  “One key element of that effort [the 1993 
legislation establishing the two -track system] was to establish a new 
category of liability called traffic ‘infractions’ and to explicitly provide 
that ‘no traffic infraction shall be classified as a criminal offense.’”   
Dissent at 4.  Under this analysis, speeding infractions cannot be subject to 
HRS § 701- 109 because § 701 -109 only pertains to “offenses.”  With respect, 
this contention is mistaken.  Though speeding is an “infraction,” it remains 
a “decriminalized traffic offense.”  
 
 In referring to non -criminal traffic offenses as “infractions,” 
the legislature in 1993 only created a category within the already existing 
class of “violations,” which themselves are a class of “offenses,” namely, 
non-criminal offenses.  HRS § 291D -2 (“‘Traffic infraction’ means all 
violations of statutes, ordinances, or rules relating to traffic movement and 
control . . . for which the prescribed penalties do not include imprisonment 
and that are not otherwise specifically excluded from coverage of this 
chapter.”). 
  An “infraction” not only “means all violations of statutes, 
ordinances, or rules relating to traffic movement and control[.]”  Id.  Under 
HRS § 701- 107—titled “Grades and classes of offenses” —speeding is included 
within a class of non -criminal “offenses,” termed “a violation.”  A 
“violation”  is defined by the Code in two ways.  A violation is either any 
offense specifically designated as a violation by the Penal Code (or any 
other Hawaiʻ i statute, such as the Traffic Code) or any offense punishable 
only by “a fine, or fine and forfeiture or other civil penalty[.]”  HRS § 
701-107(5) (emphasis added) (“A violation does not constitute a crime[.]”); 
see also  HRS § 701- 107 cmt. (“Subsection (5)  creates a class of non -criminal 
offenses , called violations.” (emphasis added)).  
  Here, ordinary speeding satisfies both prongs of the Penal Code’s 
definition of a “violation,” and a “non -criminal offense[].”  See HRS § 701-
107(5).  First, the ordinary speeding statute provides for no other sentence 
than a fine.  HRS § 291C -102(a)(1); HRS § 291D -9(a)-(b).  Second, speeding is 
expressly defined as a violation by “another statute of this State,” namely, 
the Traffic Code.  See  HRS §§ 291C -102, 291C -161(a) ( “It is a violation  for 
any person to violate any of the provisions of this chapter, except as 
otherwise specified in subsections (c) and (d) and unless the violation is by 
other law of this State declared to be a felony, misdemeanor, or petty 
misdemeanor.”  (emphasis added)).  Thus speeding is an infraction that 
constitutes both a violation and a non -criminal offense.  As a noncriminal 
 
(. . . continued)  _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
21 
 offenses arising from the same course of conduct without thereby 
automatically precluding a later trial for the criminal offense 
occurring in the same course of conduct.  But HRS § 291D- 3(d) 
does not preclude the operation of HRS § 701-109(1)’s provision 
prohibiting convicting a defendant of more than one offense, 
such as when one offense is the lesser included offense of a 
greater offense.  See  HRS §§ 701 -109(1)(a), 701- 109(4). 
 C. Speeding Is a Lesser Included Offense of Excessive 
Speeding 
 
  We have previously ruled that speeding is a lesser 
included offense of excessive speeding in State v. Fitzwater, 
122 Hawai ʻi 354, 
357, 378, 227 P.3d 520, 523, 544 (2010). 
  In Fitzwater, the defendant was charged with driving 
70 miles per hour in a 35 mile s per hour zone, “which was 5 
miles per hour greater than the threshold established by HRS § 
291C–105.”  Id. at 377, 227 P.3d at 543.  Because excessive 
speeding is a criminal offense, the State was required to prove 
the defendant’s speed beyond a reasonab le doubt.  We concluded 
that the State failed to meet that burden.  
Id. at 378, 227 P.3d 
at 544.  The defendant’s speed had been determined by the 
officer pacing the defendant with his vehicle, and the defendant 
                                                                  
(continued . . .) 
 
“offense,” it is subject to the provisions of HRS § 701 -109 other than HRS § 
701-109(2). _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
22 
 challenged the accuracy of the officer’s spe edometer.  The trial 
court had admitted the “speed check” card for the vehicle 
ostensibly showing the accuracy of the speedometer.  We held 
that the State had failed to establish sufficient foundation to 
admit the speed check card as a business record.  
Id. at 374- 77, 
227 P.3d at 540-43.  Because the speed check card lacked 
adequate indicia of reliability regarding calibration testing, 
the card had not been properly authenticated as a business 
record under Hawai ʻi Rules of Evid
ence Rule 803(b)(6).  Id.  at 
369-70, 375, 227 P.3d at 535-36, 541.   
  Without the speed check card, there was insufficient 
evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant’s 
speed exceeded the threshold of 30 miles per hour over the 
posted speed limit required by HRS § 291C -105(a)(1), the 
excessive speeding statute.  Id.  at 377-78, 227 P.3d at 543-44.  
While the officer testified that the defendant had been driving 
70 miles per hour in a 35 miles per hour zone, as measured by 
the officer’s speedometer, we concluded that the officer’s 
testimony alone was not sufficient, “given the relatively small 
margin of error of 5 miles per hour.”  Id. at 378, 227 P.3d at 
544.  However, the defendant himself had admitted in his 
testimony to exceeding the posted speed limit.  Id.  We _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
23 
 therefore remanded for entry of a judgment that the defendant 
had violated HRS § 291C-102(a)(1).  Id.   
  We explained that where an appellate court determines 
evidence is insufficient “to support a conviction of a greater 
offense but sufficient to support a conviction of a lesser 
included offense, the court may remand for entry of judgment of 
conviction on the lesser included offense[.]”  Id. (internal 
quotation marks omitted) (quoting State v. Line, 121 Hawai ʻi 74, 
90, 214 P.3d 613, 629 (2009) (citation omitted)).  The point of 
our remand was to enter judgment on speeding as a lesser 
included offense of excessive speeding pursuant to HRS § 701-
109(4)(a).  Our remand was consistent with HRS § 701-109(4)(a), 
which states, among other grounds, that one offense is the 
lesser included of another when the first offense “is 
established by proof of the same or less than all the facts 
required to establish the commission of the” other offense.  If 
Kalua engaged in the same conduct for both speeding and 
excessive speeding, he cannot be convicted of excessive speeding 
because, pursuant to HRS § 701-109(4)(a), he has been convicted 
of the lesser included offense of speeding. 
  The dissent disagrees that Fitzwater  held speeding to 
be an included offense of excessive speeding, contending instead 
that Fitzwater merely quoted a sentence from Line for the _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
24 
 relevant general rule, and introduced that quotation with a 
“cf.” signal, which the dissent regards as incapable of 
supporting a holding.  Dissent at 5 -6 (quoting Fitzwater, 121  
Hawaiʻi
 at 90, 214 P.3d at 629 for the proposition quoted in 
Line, 121 Hawaiʻ i at 90, 214 P.3d at 629 that “[i]t is 
established that if an appellate court determines that the 
evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support a 
conviction of a greater offense but sufficient to support a 
conviction of a lesser included offense, the court may remand 
for entry of judgment of conviction on the lesser included 
offense” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  However, contrary 
to the dissent’s suggestion, that sentence was not a mere aside.  
It was essential to the disposition of the case.  See Black’s 
Law Dictionary 106 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “holding” as “[a] 
court’s determination of a matter of law pivotal to its 
decision”).  This court specifically stated that, on remand, 
judgment was to be entered against the defendant on the “non -
criminal traffic infr action” of speeding as an included offense 
of excessive speeding
.   The dissent also rejects this court’s 
treatment in Fitzwater of speeding as an included offense based 16
                     
 16 “Accordingly, we remand for entr y of a judgment that [the 
defendant] violated HRS 291C -102(a)(1), in accordance with the applicable 
statutes governing non -criminal traffic infractions.”  Fitzwater, 122 Hawaiʻi 
at 378, 227 P.3d at 544.  _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
25 
 on the incorrect proposition that a civil infraction cannot 
result in a conviction.  As noted, this assumption is directly 
contrary to the language of Fitzwater remanding with 
instructions that the defendant be found to have committed the 
civil infraction of speeding as a lesser included offense of 
excessive speeding.  The dissent’s positio n also directly 
contradicts the penal code’s definition of an offense in HRS § 
701-107(5) (1993) that provides for conviction of civil 
offenses:  “[A]  violation does not constitute a crime, and 
conviction of a violation shall not give rise to any civil 
disability based on conviction of a criminal offense.”  Thus, 
the language of HRS § 291D- 3(c)(1) establishing that a civil 
judgment arises from the commission of speeding clearly does not 
preclude its status as an included offense for purposes of HRS § 
701-109(4). 
  In order for the statutory protections against being 
convicted of both a greater offense and its lesser included 
offense to apply in a given case, the offenses must pertain to 
the same conduct, not separate conduct.  Model Penal Code and 
Commentaries  § 1.07 cmt. at 102, 106 (Am. Law Inst. 1962) 
(noting that the language of the Model Penal Code adopted 
verbatim by HRS § 701-109(1) “specifies the situations in which 
conviction for more than one offense based on the same conduct _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
26 
 is precluded” (emphasis  added)).  See also HRS § 701-118(4)  
(1993) (expressly defining “conduct” to mean “an act or 
omission, or, where relevant, a series of acts or a series of 
omissions, or a series of acts and omissions”).   Conversely, if 
the offenses pertain to separate conduct, both are eligible for 
prosecution and conviction.  See State v. Apao, 95 Hawaiʻi 440, 
446-47, 24 P.3d 32, 38-39 (2001) (contrasting “separate and 
distinct culpable acts” with “an uninterrupted cont inuous course 
of conduct”); State v. Lessary, 75 Haw. 446, 459 -60, 865 P.2d 
150, 156- 57 (1994) (contrasting “the same conduct” test with 
“individuals who perform separate acts that independently 
constitute separate offenses”); State v. Mendonca, 68 Haw. 280, 
284, 711 P.2d 731, 735 (1985) (“Where . . . two different 
criminal acts are at issue, supported by different factual 
evidence even though separated in time by only a few seconds, 
one offense by definition cannot be ‘included’ in the other.” 
(citation omitted)). 
  As noted, we held in Fitzwater that speeding is a 
lesser included offense of excessive speeding.   There was no 
dispute that the lesser included offense of speeding pertained17
 
                     
 17  In Fitzwater, HRS § 701- 109(1) did not apply because the 
defendant was charged with only one offense:  the offense of excessive
speeding.  _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
27 
 to the same conduct as the greater offense of excessive 
speeding, because the defendant had been charged only with the 
offense of excessive speeding.  Here, though, Kalua is charged 
with two offenses:  speeding and excessive speeding. 
  Accordingly, if the district court on remand finds at 
trial both offenses to be grounded in the same conduct, then the 
State is prohibited from convicting Kalua of excessive speeding.  
If, however, the district court finds that the two offenses are 
not grounded in the same conduct but rather in different 
criminal acts, then the State may convict Kalua of both 
offenses. 
 D. Considerations on Remand 
  In sum, on remand the State is not barred from 
prosecuting Kalua for excessive speeding.  At trial, the 
district court must determine whether the two offenses involve 
the same conduct rather than separate criminal acts.  HRS § 701-
109(1)(a)’s prohibition on convicting a defendant of more than 
one offense when one of those offenses is a lesser included 
offense will apply if the conduct is the same.  However, if, on 
the other hand, it is found that speeding and excessive speeding 
arose from separate criminal acts constituting separate conduct, 
Kalua may be convicted of excessive speeding, in addition to the 
speeding offense that was already adjudicated.  _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_
