Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee,
 
vs.
 
EDDY A. ABORDO, 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant.
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
(CAAP-12-0000602; CASE NO. 1DTC-11-082314) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Eddy A. Abordo (Abordo) 
seeks review of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) April 
13, 2015 Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its February 
23, 2015 Summary Disposition Order, which vacated the District 
Court of the First Circuit’s (district court)1 May 30, 2012 
1 The Honorable Linda K.C. Luke presided.    
 
 
   
 
 
 
 On certiorari, Abordo contends, inter alia , that the  
ICA erred in holding that the district court properly permitted 
the State to amend the charge against Abordo to allege the 
required mens rea  for the offense.  Abordo argues that the 
defective charge rendered the district court without jurisdiction over the case, and, therefore, without jurisdiction to permit the State to amend the charge.   We disagree. In 
Schwartz v. State , we recently held that  “the failure of a 
charging instrument to allege an element of an offense does not 
constitute a jurisdictional defect that fails to confer subject-
matter jurisdiction to the district court.”  136 Hawaiʻ i 258,  
282, 361 P.3d 1161, 1185 (2015).  Accordingly, the ICA correctly 
concluded that the district court properly permitted the State 
to amend the charge.

Judgment and remanded the case for a new trial.2 The district 
court found Abordo guilty of Operating a Vehicle after License 
and Privilege Have Been Suspended or Revoked for Operating a 
Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVLPSR-OVUII), in 
violation of Hawai i Revised Statutes § 291E-62 (2007 & Supp. 
2010). 
We further conclude that Abordo’s remaining claims 
lack merit. 
2 The ICA vacated and remanded the case based on the district 
court’s misstatement of the standard of proof.

   IT IS  HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s Judgment on A ppeal 
is affirmed.
