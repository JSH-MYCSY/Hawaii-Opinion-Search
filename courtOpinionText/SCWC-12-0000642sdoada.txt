CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)

and remanded the case for a new trial.1 The district court found 
Gomez guilty of Operating a Vehicle After License and Privilege 
Have Been Suspended or Revoked for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVLPSR-OVUII), in violation of 
Hawaii Revised Statutes § 291E-62 (2007 & Supp. 2010). 
On certiorari, Gomez contends, inter alia, that the 
ICA erred in holding that the district court properly permitted 
the State to amend the charge against Gomez to allege the 
required mens rea for the offense. 
Gomez argues that the 
defective charge rendered the district court without jurisdiction over the case and, therefore, without jurisdiction to permit the State to amend the charge. We recently held in 
State v. Schwartz that “the failure of a charging instrument to 
allege an element of an offense does not constitute a jurisdictional defect that fails to confer subject-matter 
jurisdiction to the district court.” State v. Schwartz, No. 
SCWC-10-0000199, 2015 WL 7370086, at *21 (Haw. Nov. 19, 2015). 
Accordingly, the ICA correctly concluded that the district court properly permitted the State to amend the charge. 
We further conclude that Gomez’s remaining claims lack 
merit. 
1 The ICA vacated the district court judgment and remanded the case
for a new trial b ased on the district court’s apparent erroneous reliance on 
a judgment of a prior conviction, filed January 24, 2012, in finding that
Gomez’s license was revoked at the time of the charged offense, which 
resulted in “ uncertainty over whether the district court would have made the 
same finding based on other properly admitted evidence.”
