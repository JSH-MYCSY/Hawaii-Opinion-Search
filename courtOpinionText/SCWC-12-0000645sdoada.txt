Petitioner/Respondent-Appellee-Cross-Appellant/Appellee 
UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company formerly doing business as
 
Evercare (UnitedHealthcare) applies for writ of certiorari,
 challenging the Intermediate Court of Appeals’s (ICA) August 19,

(circuit court) that were entered on June 20, 2012 in Civil No.
 
11-1-2903-11, Civil No. 11-1-2542-10, and Civil No. 11-1-2533-10. 
Upon consideration of UnitedHealthcare’s appeal, the specific
 facts of these cases, together with all submissions in support
 thereof, we conclude that the circuit court had subject matter
 jurisdiction over each of the consolidated cases. The ICA’s
 judgment vacating the circuit court’s judgments is affirmed.

 Although we affirm the ICA’s disposition in this case, we do not 
endorse the ICA’s interpretation of Hawai 'i Management Alliance Association v. 
Insurance Commissioner, 106 Hawai 'i 21, 100 P.3d 952 (2004).
