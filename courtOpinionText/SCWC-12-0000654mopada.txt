MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.,
and Circuit Judge Nacino, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
This case concerns the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit’s (circuit court) summary denial of Petitioner/Defendant-
Appellant Yoshiro Sanney’s (Sanney) motion to reconsider sentence filed pursuant to the Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) 
Rule 35. We hold that the circuit court erred in denying Sanney’s motion without holding a hearing. *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On September 22, 2010, Sanney was indicted on one count
 
of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of HRS § 707­
1
731(1)(b) (Supp. 2010)  , for “knowingly subject[ing] to sexual
penetration, [Complaining Witness (CW)], who was mentally
 
incapacitated, or physically helpless, by placing his mouth on
 her genitalia.” 
Sanney was also indicted on one count of sexual
 
assault in the second degree in violation of HRS §§ 705-500
 
2
(1993) and 707-731(1)(b), for “intentionally engag[ing] in
part: 1 HRS § 707-731(1)(b) provided then, as it does now, in pertinent 
(1) A person commits the offense of sexual assault in the
second degree if: 
. . . . 
(b) The person knowingly subjects to sexual
penetration another person who is mentallyincapacitated or physically helpless . . . . 
2 HRS § 705-500 provided then, as it does now: 
(1) A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if
the person: 
(a) Intentionally engages in conduct which wouldconstitute the crime if the attendant circumstances were as the person believes them to be; or 
(b) Intentionally engages in conduct which, under the
circumstances as the person believes them to be,constitutes a substantial step in a course of conductintended to culminate in the person’s commission ofthe crime. 
(2) W
hen causing a particular result is an element of the
crime, a person is guilty of an attempt to commit the crimeif, acting with the state of mind required to establishliability with respect to the attendant circumstances

conduct which, under the circumstances as he believed them to be,
 
constituted a substantial step in a course of conduct intended to
 culminate in his commission of the crime of [s]exual [a]ssault in
 the [s]econd [d]egree against [CW].” 
Sanney initially pleaded not guilty. On July 13, 2011,
 
Sanney appeared in the circuit court
3
 at a change of plea hearing
and entered a plea of no contest to the charges of sexual assault
 in the second degree and attempted sexual assault in the second
 degree. Prior to the entry of the change of plea, Sanney’s
 counsel indicated that the circuit court had given an inclination
 of a sentence of probation with up to 18 months in jail. The
 circuit court stated that “an inclination is not a promise” and
 clarified that its final sentencing determination would be based,
 in part, on information provided in the forthcoming presentence
 report (PSI). The circuit court informed Sanney that he was
 facing a maximum sentence of forty years. 
At the sentencing hearing on September 21, 2011, the
 
circuit court stated that it had “concern[s] about some of the
 
2(...continued)
speci
fied in the definition of the crime, the person
intentionally engages in conduct which is a substantial step
in a course of conduct intended or known to cause such a
 result.
 
(3) Conduct shall not be considered a substantial step under
this section unless it is strongly corroborative of the
defendant’s criminal intent.

representations in that PSI which, to [it, were] different from
 
the representations that were made at the time of the change of
 plea and based upon which the court did give its inclination of
 probation with an uncertain jail term.” At the subsequent
 sentencing hearing on September 26, 2011, the circuit court
 stated that in light of the new information in the PSI, it was
 sentencing Sanney to ten years of prison on both counts, with the
 terms to run concurrently. 
On December 22, 2011, Sanney filed a motion to 
reconsider sentence pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP) Rule 35. The grounds for the motion were stated as: 
a. The Defendant was sentenced on September 26, 2011 to
concurrent open ten (10) year terms of incarceration.
Exhibit “A”.
 
b. Defendant has been incarcerated since September 15,
2010 and is now being held at the Halawa Correctional
Facility.
 
c. Since Defendant has been sentenced to prison, he has
had a lot of time to reflect about the incidents that
 
occurred in this case.
 
d. Defendant would like another opportunity to address
the Court regarding his sentence in this case and is
requesting that the Court reconsider the sentence imposed on
September 26, 2011 and sentence him to probation.
 
On January 11, 2012, Sanney’s attorney filed a motion
 
to withdraw as counsel and have substitute counsel appointed; the
 
motion alleged “a break-down in the attorney-client relationship
 between [Sanney] and his defense counsel.” 
The circuit court held a hearing on both motions on
 
4
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
January 23, 2012. After hearing from Sanney and his defense
 
counsel, the circuit court granted the motion for withdrawal. 
The circuit court then allowed Sanney to decide whether to
 proceed with a hearing on the motion to reconsider sentence,
 represented by his former counsel, or whether to delay that
 motion for six months and allow his new counsel to handle it. 
Sanney ultimately decided to allow his new counsel to handle the
 
motion to reconsider sentence and the circuit court scheduled a
 
hearing for six months in the future, June 25, 2012. 
On January 24, 2012, Sanney was appointed new counsel. 
On June 21, 2012, four days before the scheduled hearing, the
 
circuit court entered an order summarily denying Sanney’s motion
 to reconsider sentence. The circuit court stated that “following
 a review of the Motion, attached Declaration of Counsel and the
 records and files of the instant matter, the Court finds that the
 Motion fails to state any new evidence that would warrant the
 Court to reconsider its prior ruling.” 
Sanney appealed to the ICA arguing that the circuit
 
court abused its discretion in summarily denying his motion to
 reconsider sentence without holding a hearing. In a summary
 disposition order, the ICA affirmed the circuit court’s denial of
 Sanney’s motion for reconsideration of sentence. State v.
 
Sanney, No. CAAP-12-0000654, 2013 WL 3776162 (App. July 8, 2013)

(SDO). The court reasoned: 
Sanney cites to no authority that would have entitled him to
a hearing on his motion pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of Penal 
Procedure Rule 35(b), and we find none.  Sanney argues hecould have brought matters to the attention of the circuitcourt if he had a hearing but does not explain why thesematters could not have been brought to the attention of thecourt in his motion for reconsideration or by writtensubmittal in support of his motion. 
Id. at *1.
 
Sanney filed an application for writ of certiorari with
 
this court arguing that the ICA erred in concluding that the
 
circuit court did not abuse its discretion in summarily denying
 the motion to reconsider sentence without holding a hearing. 
II. DISCUSSION
 
On application for writ of certiorari to this court, 
Sanney argues that the circuit court abused its discretion in summarily denying his motion for reconsideration without a hearing.
4 “‘The authority of a trial court to select and 
determine the severity of a penalty is normally undisturbed on review in the absence of an apparent abuse of discretion or unless applicable statutory or constitutional commands have not been observed.’” Barnett v. State, 91 Hawai' i 20, 26, 979 P.2d 
1046, 1052 (1999) (quoting State v. Valera, 74 Haw. 424, 439, 848 
4
 In a tangentially related argument, Sanney claims that the circuit
 
court erred in denying his motion for reconsideration because there was no
“new information” in the PSI to justify the circuit court’s departure from its
initial inclination.  It is unnecessary to address this argument as we resolve
the case on other grounds.

P.2d 376, 383 (1993)). “To constitute an abuse it must appear
 
that the court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or
 disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the
 substantial detriment of a party litigant.” State v. Kahapea,
 
111 Hawai' i 267, 278, 141 P.3d 440, 451 (2006). 
Motions for a reduction or reconsideration of sentence
 
are governed by Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 
35(b). HRPP Rule 35(b) states:
 
The court may reduce a sentence within 90 days after the
sentence is imposed, or within 90 days after receipt by the
court of a mandate issued upon affirmance of the judgment or
dismissal of the appeal, or within 90 days after entry of
any order or judgment of the Supreme Court of the United
States denying review of, or having the effect of upholding
the judgment of conviction.  A motion to reduce a sentence
 that is made within the time prior shall empower the court
to act on such motion even though the time period has
expired.  The filing of a notice of appeal shall not deprive
the court of jurisdiction to entertain a timely motion to
reduce a sentence.
 
HRPP Rule 35(b). The plain language of HRPP Rule 35(b) does not
 
require the trial court to conduct a hearing before denying a
 motion to reconsider or reduce a sentence. This court has yet to
 address the issue of whether the trial court must conduct a
 hearing prior to denying a motion for reconsideration or
 reduction of sentence.
5
 
Regardless of whether an HRPP Rule 35(b) motion always
 
5
 Because HRPP Rule 35(b) contains no requirement of new evidence,
 
the better practice in motions for reconsideration or reduction of sentence
would be to hold a hearing to allow the defendant to explain the reasons a
reconsideration or reduction of sentence is warranted.

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
requires a hearing, the issue at bar may be decided on the narrow
 
facts of this case. Here, the court granted Sanney’s attorney’s
 motion for withdrawal prior to hearing Sanney’s motion to
 reconsider sentence. Had Sanney’s attorney not withdrawn as
 counsel, on January 23, 2012, Sanney would have had the
 opportunity to present arguments in support of his motion to
 reconsider sentence. Instead, Sanney chose to allow his new
 counsel to handle the motion, and the court postponed the hearing
 to June 25, 2012 to allow new counsel to be appointed. Then, on
 June 21, 2012, the circuit court entered its order summarily
 denying Sanney’s motion to reconsider sentence.
 
The circuit court abused its discretion in summarily
 
denying the motion for reconsideration without a hearing after
 allowing substitution of counsel and setting the matter for a
 hearing. The court provided no justification for rescheduling
 the hearing, and then subsequently denying the motion before the
 hearing was held. The court’s only stated reason for denying
 Sanney’s motion was Sanney’s failure to present new evidence. 
However HRPP Rule 35 does not require defendants to present new
 evidence when moving for a reconsideration of sentence. Based on
 the facts of this case, the circuit court erred when it denied
 Sanney’s motion to reconsider sentence without conducting a
 hearing and the ICA erred in affirming the circuit court’s

summary denial. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Due to the errors identified above, we vacate the ICA’s
 
August 21, 2013, judgment on appeal and remand this case to the
 
circuit court for further proceedings.
