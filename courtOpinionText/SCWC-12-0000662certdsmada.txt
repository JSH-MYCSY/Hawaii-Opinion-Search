CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(CAAP-12-0000662; CIV. NO. 11-1-002757)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
On November 5, 2012, petitioner Livia M. Scotto filed a
 
document entitled “Petition for Writ of Certiorari”. To the
 
extent petitioner seeks certiorari review of this court’s October
 31, 2012 order concerning the box of papers and other items
 Scotto delivered to the appellate clerk’s office for filing, a
 copy of which is attached to the petition, such an order is not
 reviewable by the supreme court by application for a writ of
 certiorari. See HRAP 40.1(a) (“A party may seek review of the
 
intermediate court of appeals’ decision by filing an application
 for a writ of certiorari in the supreme court.”); see also Haw.
 Rev. Stat. § 602-5(a) (Supp. 2011). Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of
 
certiorari is dismissed.
