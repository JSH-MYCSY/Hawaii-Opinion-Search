CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS  
(CAAP-12-0000682; CASE NO. 1DTA
-11-05236) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Linn M. Kiyuna seeks review 
of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (“ICA”) May 5, 2015 
Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its April 7, 2015 
Summary Disposition Order, which affirmed the District Court of 
the First Circuit’s (“district court”) July 6, 2012 Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment (“district 
1 court judgment”).   The district court found Kiyuna guilty of 
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant 
(“OVUII”), in violation of Hawai i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) 
1 The Honorable Lono Lee presided.

§ 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (4) (2007).2 This court accepted Kiyuna’s 
Application for Writ of Certiorari, and we now affirm the ICA’s 
Judgment on Appeal and the district court judgment. 
On certiorari, Kiyuna  contends that (1) his  Miranda rights 
under Article I, Section 10 of the Hawai ʻi Constitution were 
violated when, while in custody, he was asked by the police, without Miranda warnings, if he wanted to refuse to take a blood 
alcohol test, which was likely to incriminate himself; (2) his 
statutory right to an attorney was violated; and (3) the 
district court improperly allowed the State to amend its 
complaint to allege the requisite mens rea for the HRS § 291E-
61(a)(1) charge.  
In this court’s recent summar y disposition order in State 
v. Kam, we held that “the ICA correctly concluded that the district court properly permitted the State to amend” an HRS 
§ 291E-61(a)(1) charge to allege the requisite mens rea.  State  
2	 HRS § 291E- 61(a)(1) and (4) provide in relevant part: 
(a)	 A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under 
the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or 
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount 
sufficient to impair the person’s normal mental faculties 
or ability to care for the person and guard against casualty; [or]  
. . . . 
(4) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one hundred 
milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood.

 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s May 5, 2015 Judgment on 
Appeal and the district court judgment are affirmed.

v. Kam, SCWC-12-0000897 (Haw. Feb. 25, 2016) (SDO) at 2. 
Accordingly, the district court properly permitted the State to 
amend Kiyuna’s HRS § 291E -61(a)(1) charge to allege mens rea.  
Kiyuna was convicted for violating both HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) 
and (a)(4). Either subsection can serve as t he basis for a 
conviction under HRS § 291E-61.  See State v. Grindles, 70 Haw. 
528, 530-31, 777 P.2d 1187, 1189-90 (1989); State v. Caleb , 79 
Hawaii 336, 339, 902 P.2d 971, 974 (1995); State v. Mezurashi , 
77 Hawai
i 94, 98, 881 P.2d 1240, 1244 (1994). Insofar as the 
HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge was properly amended, and insofar as Kiyuna does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence 
supporting his conviction for violating HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), his 
OVUII conviction still stands. There is no need for this court 
to address his argument that the blood test results supporting 
his HRS § 291E-61(a)(4) conviction were obtained in violation of 
his Miranda rights and/or his statutory right to counsel.
