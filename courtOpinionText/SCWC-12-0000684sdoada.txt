SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Rick J. Fisher (Fisher) 
seeks review of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) July 
14, 2014 Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its June 16, 
2014 Summary Disposition Order, which affirmed the District 
Court of the First Circuit’s (district court) Notice of Entry of 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment entered on July 20,

2012.1 The district court found Fisher guilty of Operating a 
Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in 
violation of Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) 
and/or (3) (Supp. 2012).2 We accepted Fisher’s Application for 
Writ of Certiorari, and we now affirm the ICA’s Judgment on 
Appeal and the district court’s Judgment . 
On certiorari, Fisher contends (1) he was subject to 
custodial interrogation and should have been informed of his Miranda rights guaranteed by Article I, Section 10 of the Hawaiʻ i 
Constitution; (2) his statutory right to an attorney was 
violated; (3) his due process rights under Article I, Section 5 
of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution were violated when the police told 
him that he “shall” be subject to up to 30 days in jail if he 
did not take a breath, blood, or urine test; and (4) the 
district court improperly allowed the State to amend its 
1 The Honorable Clarence A. Pacarro presided over the proceedings 
that addressed the State’s motion to a mend the complaint.  The Honorable Lono 
J. Lee presided over Fisher’s trial. 
2 HRS § 291E -61 provides in relevant part: 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates 
or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an 
amount suffi cient to impair the person’s normal mental 
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard against casualty; [or] 
. . . 
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two 
hundred ten liters of breath. . . .

complaint to allege the requisite mens rea for the HRS §  291E-
61(a)(1) charge and double jeopardy would bar retrial on that 
charge.    
In this court’s recent summary disposition order in 
State v. Kam , No. SCWC-12-0000897 (Haw. Feb. 25, 2016) (SDO), we 
held that “the ICA correctly concluded that the district court properly permitted the State to amend” an HRS § 291E -61(a)(1) 
charge to allege the requisite mens rea.  Kam, SDO at 2. 
Accordingly, the district court properly permitted the State to  
amend Fisher’s HRS § 291E -61(a)(1) charge to allege mens rea.   
Fisher was convicted for violating both HRS § 291E-
61(a)(1) and (a)(3).  Either subsection can serve as the basis for a conviction under HRS § 291E-61. 
 See  State v. Caleb , 79 
Hawaiʻi 336, 339,  902 P.2d 971, 974 (1995); State v. Mezurashi , 
77 Hawaiʻ i 94, 98 , 881 P.2d 1240, 1244 (1994); State v. Grindles , 
70 Haw. 528, 530-31, 777 P.2d 1187, 1189-90 (1989).  Insofar as the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge was properly amended, and insofar 
as Fisher does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence 
supporting his conviction for violating HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), his 
OVUII conviction still stands. There is no need for this court 
to address his argument that the breath test result   supporting 
his HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) conviction was  obtained in violation of 
his Miranda rights, his statutory right to counsel, and/or  his

due process rights.  Additionally, Fisher’s double jeopardy 
argument is irrelevant because we now affirm his conviction. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s July 14, 2014 
Judgment on Appeal and the district court ’s Judgment are 
affirmed.
