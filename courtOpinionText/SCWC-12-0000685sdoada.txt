SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Natuitasina Cyril Tuia
 
(Tuia) seeks review of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA)
 
July 3, 2014 Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its June 4,
 2014 Summary Disposition Order, which affirmed the District Court
 of the First Circuit’s (district court) July 20, 2012 Notice of
 Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment (district court
 judgment). The district court found Tuia guilty of Operating a
 Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
violation of Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) and 
(a)(3) (Supp. 2012).1 This court accepted Tuia’s Application for 
Writ of Certiorari, and we now affirm the ICA’s Judgment on 
Appeal and the district court’s judgment. 
On certiorari, Tuia contends that (1) his Miranda 
rights under Article I, Section 10 of the Hawai' i Constitution 
were violated when, while in custody, he was asked by the police, without Miranda warnings, if he wanted to refuse to take a blood alcohol test, which was likely to incriminate himself; (2) his statutory right to an attorney was violated; (3) his due process rights under Article I, Section 5 of the Hawai' i Constitution 
were violated when the police told his that he “shall” be subject to 30 days in jail if he did not take a blood alcohol test; and (4) the district court improperly allowed the State to amend its
 complaint to allege the requisite mens rea for the HRS § 291E­
1 HRS § 291E-61(a) states in relevant part:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the
 person operates or assumes actual physical control of
a vehicle:
 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an 
amount sufficient to impair the person’s normal 
mental faculties or ability to care for the 
person and guard against casualty;
 
. . . . 
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath.

61(a)(1) charge and double jeopardy would bar retrial on that
 
charge.
 
In this court’s recent summary disposition order in
 
SCWC-12-897, State v. Kam, we held that “the ICA correctly
 concluded that the district court properly permitted the State to
 amend” an HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge to allege the requisite mens
 rea. State v. Kam, SCWC-12-0000897 (Haw. Feb. 25, 2016) (SDO) at
 
2. Accordingly, the district court properly permitted the State
 
to amend Tuia’s HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge to allege mens rea.
 
Tuia was convicted for violating both HRS § 291E­
61(a)(1) and (a)(3). Either subsection can serve as the basis for a conviction under HRS § 291E-61. See State v. Grindles, 70 
Haw. 528, 530-31, 777 P.2d 1187, 1189-90 (1989); State v. Caleb, 79 Hawai' i 336, 339, 902 P.2s 971, 974 (1995); State v. 
Mezurashi, 77 Hawai' i 94, 98, 881 P.2d 1240, 1244 (1994). 
Insofar as the HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) charge was properly amended, and insofar as Tuia does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction for violating HRS § 291E­61(a)(1), his OVUII conviction stands. There is no need for this court to address his argument that the blood test results supporting his HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) conviction were obtained in violation of his Miranda rights, his statutory right to counsel, and/or his due process rights. Additionally, Tuia’s double

jeopardy argument is irrelevant because we now affirm his
 
conviction.
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s July 3, 2014
 
Judgment on Appeal and the district court’s July 20, 2012 
judgment are affirmed.
