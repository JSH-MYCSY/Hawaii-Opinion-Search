OPINION OF THE COURT  BY M
cKENNA, J.
  
I. Introduction 
This case arises from a contentious 
divorce proceeding 
between Celia Kay Brutsch (“Wife”) and Karl Robert Brutsch   
 
 
     
  
  
 
 
 
   
     
 
 
 
 
 
                         
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
(“Husband”). Wife timely applied for writ of certiorari 
(“Application”) from the Judgment entered by the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals (“ICA”) pursuant to its May 12, 2015 Summary 
Disposition Order (“ SDO”). In relevant part, the ICA vacated in 
part the Family Court of the First Circuit’s (“family 
court[’s]”): (1) “Decree Granting Absolute Divorce and Awarding 
Child Custody” (“divorce decree”) because it denied Husband any 
Category 3 credit for gifts and inheritance, and (2) “Order Re: 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration and for Rule 68 
Attorney’s Fees Filed February 16, 2012” and “Order Denying Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration of Decision Announced 
March 14, 2012, Filed March 21, 2012.” 
In her Application, Wife presents two questions: 
A.  Given [Husband’s] failure to document a consistent 
amount for his inheritance, show it was used for marital 
expenses, or rebut a presumption of gift to the marital 
partnership, did the ICA commit grave error when it 
substituted its own judgment for that of the trial judge, and vacated his ruling rejecting [Husband’s] 
demand for $134,235, $140,000, $190,000, $236,235, or 
$324,235,[
1] in Category 3 credits ?  
B. Given [Husband’s] failure to tender a comprehensive 
settlement offer as to all contested issues, offer to 
settle any one of the contested matters, or justify his 
request for fees with billings or time sheets, did the 
ICA commit grave error when it substituted its own 
judgment for that of the trial judge, and vacated his 
ruling denying [Husband’s] demand for [Hawaiʻi Family 
Court Rules] Rule 68 fees and costs? 
Husband requested $134,235 in Category 3 credits in his motion for 
reconsideration. According to Wife, he had requested these other amounts 
before.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
With respect to the first issue in the Application, we hold 
that the ICA was correct in  ruling that the family court erred 
in stating that the record was “bereft of any competent or 
credib[le] evidence that   . . . monies were actua lly contributed 
to the marriage,” and therefore remanding this issue for further 
proceedings, along with other rulings of  the family court that 
are not at issue in the Application.   Brutsch v. Brutsch, No. 
CAAP-12-0000703, at 7  (App. May 12, 201  5) (SDO).  When the 
family court addresses the issue of Category 3 cre
dits on 
remand, however, it must do so in light of  this court’s rulings 
regarding Category 3 credits in Hamilton v. Hamilton , 138 Hawai ʻi 
185, 378 P.3d 901 (2016).  In addition, at various points in this litigation, Husband argued differing amounts for Category 3  
credits. At oral argument, Husband conceded  that the only 
amounts he claims for Category 3 credits total $134,235, 
consisting of gifts reflected in checks totalling $74,235,  the 
$40,000 total he received as gifts in $10,000 increments, and the $20,000 annuity he inherited used to purchase a Jacuzzi for  
the  Maunawili house. Therefore, the family court’s review of 
possible Category 3 credits will be limited to those amounts, 
totalling $134,235.  In addition, in determining Category 3 
credits, the family court must also address whether Husband 
already received credit for any of the subject amounts through 
Wife’s pre-trial purchase of Husband’s interest in the Maunawili 
3
   
 
 
  
   
   
  
 
   
    
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
home, as Husband has conceded that Wife bought out his interest 
in the home. 
With respect to the second issue in the Application, this 
court recently held that Hawai
i  Family Court Rules (“HFCR”) Rule 
68 does not apply to proceedings governed by Hawai i Revised  
Statutes (“HRS”) § 580 -47 (Supp. 2011) .  See  Cox v. Cox, 138 
Hawaii 476, 382 P.3d 288 (2016)
.  This divorce proceeding is 
governed by HRS § 580-47. We therefore vacate the ICA’s ruling 
vacating the family court’s denial of Husband’s HFCR Rule 68 motion.   In doing so, we further explain why in Cox  we held HFCR 
Rule 68 inapplicable in divorce cases.  
II. Background 
A. Factual Background 
1. Overview 
Husband and Wife (collectively, “ the couple”) were married 
in 1991. 
The couple has a son born in 1996 and a daughter born 
in 2001. Husband filed for divorce on September 8, 2009. 
Although the only issues in the Application concern 
Husband’s alleged Category 3 credits and his HFCR Rule 68 
motion, there were many issues addressed by the family court 
during this contentious divorce and related proceedings.  Five 
days before Husband filed for divorce, Wife filed for and 
obtained a temporary restraining order. There were pre-decree 
4
   
 
 
   
   
  
 
 
 
    
  
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
motions concerning temporary custody, temporary child support, 
occupancy of the marital residence, wasting of assets, 
prohibition against abuse, payment of monthly financial 
obligations, attorney’s fees and costs, sharing of marital 
expenses, and payment of expenses for private school, for psychological evaluations or treatment, and for appointment of 
custody evaluators. There were also multiple pre-trial motions 
concerning the same topics. 
With respect to child custody, before trial, the family 
court appointed a Custody Evaluator. After various studies, the 
Custody Evaluator recommended that Wife be awarded sole legal 
and physical custody of the minor children. 
As Wife had already bought out Husband’s interest in the 
family home before trial, the main issues requiring resolution 
at the October 3–4, 2011 trial were child custody and some 
property division matters.  According to Husband, child custody 
was the most hotly contested dispute. 
After the trial, the family court rendered its oral ruling 
on November 2, 2011. In summary, the family court (1) denied mother’s request for sole custody of the children and instead 
maintained joint legal and joint physical custody and the couple’s time-sharing schedule; (2) addressed child support and 
payment of the children’ s private school and extracurricular 
expenses; (3) deferred decisions to the couple regarding the 
5
   
 
 
   
                         
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
children’s higher education expenses and how to use their 
existing education funds; (4) addressed medical and dental 
insurance and past due amounts; (5) addressed life insurance 
policy requirements; (6) decided how the couple would claim tax 
dependencies of their children; (7) determined how the couple ’s 
retirement funds would be equalized; (8)  ordered that artwork be 
sold and proceeds evenly split; (9) ordered that all joint  
accounts be evenly split, and provided that  each party was to  
take his or her own items  out of the safety deposit box;  (10) 
decided how joint securities and separately titled stock 
accounts were to be divided; (11) determined how to divide 
automobiles and the boat; and (12) awarded Husband all of his  
family business interest and his Kaneohe Yacht Club membership.   
Additionally, as noted,  the property divided between the parties 
did not include the couple’s family home in Maunawili , as Wife  
had purchased Husband’s interest prior to trial . Finally, the 
family court also indicated it would award Wife attorney’s fees 
and costs, and eventually awarded Wife $21,984.46 in fees and costs.    
The court did not address any possible Category 3 credit 
for Husband or whether Husband should receive attorney’s fees 
pursuant to HFCR Rule 68.
2 On February 16, 2012, Husband filed a 
HFCR Rule 68 states: 
(continued . . .)

3   The Motion also refers to an August 29, 2011 lett er, which Husband asserted 
was a second HFCR Rule 68 offer letter. However, Husband does not argue that 
he is entitled to fees based on the August 29, 2011 offer letter, likely 
because Husband explicitly specified that the offer was a “package deal.”  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
“Motion for Reconsideration and for Rule 68 Attorney’s Fees” 
(“Motion”) based on a September 30, 2010, Rule 68 letter offer.3 
The offer was apparently rejected by Wife. 
Husband argued that the primary issue in the divorce 
proceedings was the children’s custody, not property division. 
Accordingly, because Wife did not prevail in her quest for sole 
custody, Husband’s attorney argued that Wife was responsible for 
Husband’s attorney’s  fees that were incurred after the Rule 68 
offer was made for services rendered on the issue of the children’s custody,  and claimed entitlement to $15,500 in 
(. . . continued)  
At any time more than 20 days before any contested hearing 
held pursuant to HRS sections 571 -11 to 14 (excluding law 
violations, criminal matters, and child protection matters) 
is scheduled to begin, any party may serve upon the adverse 
party an offer to allow a judgment to be entered to the 
effect specified in the offer. Such offer may be made as 
to all or some of the issues, such as custody and visitation. Such offer shall not be filed with the court, 
unless it is accepted. If within 10 days after service of 
the offer the adverse party serves written notice that the 
offer is accepted, any party may then file the offer and 
notice of acceptance together with proof of service thereof and thereupon the court shall treat those issues as 
uncontested. An offer not accepted shall be deemed 
withdrawn and evidence thereof is not admissible, except in 
a proceeding to determine costs and attorney’s fees. If 
the judgment in its entirety finally obtained by the 
offeree is patently not more favorable than the offer, the 
offeree must pay the costs, including reasonable attorney’s 
fees incurred after the making of the offer, unless the 
court shall specifically determine that such would be 
inequitable. 
HFCR Rule 68. 
7
   
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
attorneys’ fees in fees under HFCR Rule 68 .   The Rule 68 offer 
letter stated: 
Please consider this an HFCR Rule 68 offer to settle 
all matters relating to this divorce.  As you know, you  
have 10 days from the receipt of this offer to accept it, 
otherwise it is deemed  rejected, and if you do not obtain a 
result that is patently better as to property division or child custody/visitation/support at trial, your client will  
owe  [Husband] costs and attorney’s fees from the date of 
this offer.  
We propose that the property division between the 
parties be as set out in the enclosed  Property Division 
Chart.  Basically, we have divided the marital home and the 
associated mortgage,  so this issue is resolved.  Otherwise, 
the Chart shows that each party keep the assets and debts  
presently in their own names.  Note that I have discounted 
the values of the 401k’ s by 30% (for state  and federal 
taxes) because these are pretax amounts.  [Wife] takes all  
the household effects  presently in the house (except for 
the two rattan chairs and [Husband’s]  personal items).   
Each party shall keep the  children’ s trust monies (which 
derive from [Husband’s]  father’s inheritance) for the 
children’s educational expenses only and be required to 
account for the trust monies upon  demand by the other 
party.  Each party pays their own debts ([Wife]  will, of 
course, be  responsible for payment of the new mortgage on 
the marital residence  which she is acquiring per the 
agreement of the parties).   [Husband]  waives any claim to 
an equalization payment.  
Neither party is seeking alimony.  
As for the children, we propose that the parties 
share joint legal and physical custody of the  children. 
Child support shall be paid per Guidelines.  [Husband]  
shall continue to cover the  children for medical insurance, 
and the parties will split equally all uncovered medical 
expenses,  including orthodontic care.   The parties will 
split the  children’ s tuitions in proportion to their  
incomes (presently the ratio is 59% for [Husband] and 41% 
for [Wife]), and the parties will split equally all other 
children’s educational expenses (e.g., after- school care, 
extracurricular activities, school lunch expense, etc.). The parties will work out a sharing arrangement (e.g., 4-3-
3-4  or 5-2-2- 5) and agree on sharing for school breaks, 
birthdays, holidays, etc.   If the parties cannot agree on 
the sharing arrangement, they shall mediate the issue before filing any court action.  
We believe that this  settles all the issues in this 
case.  We await your reply.  
Husband also argued that he was entitled to $134,235 in 
Category 3 credits based on the evidence at  trial.  In the 
8
   
 
 
     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Motion, Husband cited to  “Plaintiff’s Ex. 10 ”  as evidence.   That 
exhibit included canceled checks from the estate of Husband’s 
late father in the amounts of $50,000, $9,235, and $15,000, and 
an investment statement for a beneficiary annuity  apparently 
valued at $20,000.   Without providing any record citations, 
Husband also asserted that “[he] . . . testified about receiving 
$40,000 in four $10,000 payments as gifts from his father from 
1996 to 2001 just before his father died. . . . [Husband] 
testified that he spent . . . [gifted]  funds on the house (which 
[Wife] now owns), on a boat (which [Husband] now owns), and other expenses during the marriage.” In summarizing his motion, 
Husband argued: 
  
Based on the summary of the above issues, [Wife] owes  
[Husband] at least $13,000 in Rule 68 attorney  ’s fees, and 
probably $15,500.  In addition, the credits to which [Wife] 
is entitled under this Court ’s decision are more than 
cancelled by the credit to which [Husband] is entitled in 
Category 3 credit.  Even though the net of these amounts is 
that [Wife]  owes [Husband] about $50,000 (this is assuming 
that this Court awards [Wife] almost $22,000 in attorney ’s 
fees which, as argued above, is not justified), [Husband] 
is not looking for an award against [Wife] of this amount.  
[Husband] is simply requesting that this Court  ’s final 
decree state that neither party owes the other any amount.  
As [Husband]  offered in his Rule 68 letter over a year ago 
and in his most recent Rule  68 letter (which even threw in 
a $20,000 incentive which is no longer offered as  [Wife]  
chose to go to trial at great expense to the parties and the marital estate), this should simply be a “walk-away”  
marriage with joint custody of the children.  Based on such 
a decree, the only matter left for the parties to end this long unnecessarily drawn out affair will be to sell their 
art collectibles and divide the proceeds as ordered by this 
Court.   
If [Husband] is not awarded his Category 3 credit and 
is required to make payments to [Wife]  for attorney’ s fees 
and an amount from his 401(k), then even the offer to 
settle here as a “walk away”  marriage is withdrawn, and 
[Husband] will seek his full remedies on appeal. 
   
9
   
 
 
  
The family court entered  its  “Decree Granting Absolute 
Divorce and Awarding Child Custody”  on April 2, 2012.  
 
                         
     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
At a hearing on March 14, 2012, the court  orally ruled on 
Husband’s Motion, stating :  
With regard to the motion for reconsideration, the court 
could have and should have perhaps been more precise.  But 
by its omission the court implicitly ruled on the claim for Category 3 reimbursements. The court will explicitly do so 
at this time. The court finds that while it may be 
accurate to state that [Husband] did receive monies, the 
record is bereft of any competent or credibility [sic] 
evidence that monies were actually contributed to the marriage. Therefore the Rule --  the Category 3 claim 
ultimately fails for lack of evidence as far as what’s been presented to the court at this particular juncture. So 
therefore that portion of the motion for reconsideration is 
denied.  
With regard to the other issue as to the attorney’s 
fees, the attorney’s fees [issue] is bound up as part of 
the motion for recon but also as part of the Rule 68. The 
court finds based on the credible evidence that given the 
fact that the motion for recon  is denied as to the Category 
3 claim, with regard to the attorney’s fees and costs 
claimed by defendant respondent  [sic]  is indeed  
appropriate. The Rule 68 is predicated on the entire decree being patently more favorable or unfavorable 
depending upon the offer. [Wife’s attorney’s] argument with regard to the fact that the Rule 68 offer that was 
presented was not a complete offer, that resounds with the 
court.  
On the question of custody, again it was clear that 
[Wife]’s claim was that she wanted full custody. 
[Husband]’s advocating joint, to establish joint. 
However, 
a significant portion of the decree also dealt with the financial issues which would be the portion of the motion  
for reconsideration. In balance the decree is not patently more favorable to one or the other, therefore Rule 68 fails. The court’s prior orders with regard to the $21,900 
[for Wife’s attorney’s fees] stand[].  Court will affirm 
that amount. That order will be signed by the court. [

Husband filed a subsequent motion for reconsideration of  the 
March 14, 2012 oral ruling, which was denied.      
The family court entered its written order on April 2, 2012.

2. Husband’s Inheritance 
In his Motion, Husband did not provide the family court 
with citations to the record regarding each of the gifts or the 
inheritance received by Husband from his father, nor did Husband 
provide citations in his Response to the Application. Husband, 
however, provided some citations in the opening brief for his 
cross-appeal to the ICA.  [100:20–21] The following is a 
summary of Husband’s trial testimony and the citations provided 
in the ICA brief on the inheritance issue. 
Husband testified that i n 1996, Husband’s father gifted 
$10,000 for the purchase of a family home in Waikele. He 
asserted that in 1999 and 2001, Husband’s father gifted $10,000 
three separate times. That money was also used to purchase the 
Waikele house and home furnishings.5 
In 2001, during the marriage, Husband’s father died. 
Husband incrementally received a “substantial inhe ritance” of at 
least $70,000. Because Husband was “very much into boating,” 
about $20,000 of the inheritance funds was used to purchase a 
boat, $10,000 on an SUV to pull the boat, both of which he 
received in the divorce decree. The remainder was “invested 
back into the [Maunawili] house,” for painting the house, a new 
Wife testified the couple sold the Waikele house and received $150,000 in 
proceeds. That money went to state and federal taxes, to pay off a portion 
of Husband’s personal loan, summer school and other educational activities 
for the children, and for repairs on the Maunawili home. 
11

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
bathroom, electrical work, new flooring, a patio, a Jacuzzi, and 
putting in a rock wall. 
Part of Husband’s inheritance included a share of his 
father’s bakery and the building in w hich it was located. 
Husband’s brother received the remaining share in the bakery and 
building. Since 2001, Husband and his brother, in partnership, 
have rented out the building. Husband received his share of the 
monthly rental proceeds, amounting to approximately $10,000 to 
$20,000 a year, depending on the money spent to upkeep the 
building in any given year. For a period , “all the money” was 
used to pay Son’s private school tuition of $16,000.  
Neither the Pennsylvania building nor its rental income was 
the subject of Husb and’s Motion with respect to Category 3 
credits. Despite only claiming an alleged Category 3 credit of 
$134,235 in his Motion, Husband also included the Pennsylvania 
rental income, in the amount of $190,000, as a claimed Category 
3 credit in his cross-appeal to the ICA.  Notably, Husband had argued in his pre-trial Trial Memorandum that he should be 
awarded Category 3 credit for the rental income generated by the 
Pennsylvania building, in addition to the checks and annuity he 
received as an inheritance from his late father. 
At oral argument, however, Husband clarified his Category 3 
claim, and conceded that he is claiming Category 3 credit only 
for the checks totalling $74,235 , the $40,000 total he testified 
12
   
 
 
  
   
 
 
  
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
he received from his father consisting of four $10,000 gifts 
received in 1996, and 1999 to 2001, and a $20,000 annuity he 
testified he inherited and used to purchase a Jacuzzi for the 
Maunawili home. Thus, the maximum amount of the Husband’s 
possible Category 3 credit, as argued by Husband’s counsel , is 
$134,235. 
Pursuant to HFCR Rule 52(a), after the filing of the 
appeals to the ICA, on October 8, 2012, the court issued its “Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.” In its Findings of 
Fact, the family court explained the extensive pre-trial, trial, and post-trial proceedings of this contentious divorce case.  In 
its Conclusions of Law, the family court concluded that its 
“November 2, 2011 oral trial decision was proper, appropriate, 
just and equitable under the circumstances . . . .” It also 
ruled that its “decision to deny . . . [Husband]’s . . . Motion 
. . . was proper, appropriate, just and equitable under the 
circumstances . . . .” 
E.   Appeal to the ICA 
On August 9 and 13  , 2012, respectively, Wife and Husband 
both timely appealed  to the ICA.  The issues we address on 
certiorari arise out of Husband’s cross -appeal.   Before 
addressing that cross-appeal, we note that Wife contended in her 
appeal that the family court erred in:  (1) awarding Wife and 
Husband joint physical legal custody of the parties’ two 
13
   
 
 
   
  
    
 Husband’s cross -appeal raised the two issues that are the  
subject of the Application.  He  argued the family court erred 
in: (1) failing to award Husband any Category 3 credit; (2) 
denying Husband’s request for  Rule 68 attorney’s fees; and (3) 
awarding Wife $21,984.46 in attorney’s fees a nd costs.    
 
   
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
children and continuing the alternating-week custody schedule; 
and (2) its ruling regarding child support, education and 
medical expenses, and reimbursement for pre-decree expenses. 
See Brutsch, SDO at 2. The ICA affirmed the family court with 
respect to issue (1) and concluded that the family court had 
made some errors concerning matters in issue (2), and ordered a 
remand. See id.  at 4–6. 
With respect to the cross-appeal, the ICA held that 
“Husband was not required to trace the money he received in 
gifts and inheritances into specific purchases that contributed 
to the marriage in order to be entitled to a Category 3 credit,” 
and that therefore “the [f]amily [c]ourt erred in denying Husband any Category 3 credit on this basis.” Id. at 7. 
As to the award of Rule 68 attorney’s fees, the ICA 
concluded that, pursuant to Owens v. Owens , 104 Hawai i 292, 310,  
88 P.3d 664, 682 (App. 2004), 
the matter must be remanded to the 
family court for a determination as to “whether its final 
judgment on child custody is patently not more favorable to Wife 
than Husband’s HFCR Rule 68 offer on the custody issue .”   
14
   
 
 
   
 
 
  
    
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Brutsch, SDO at 8–9.   On remand, the family court was also 
directed to 
consider whether HFCR Rule 68 attorney’s fees with 
respect to financial issues would be appropriate, in light of 
the family court’s consideration on remand of Husband’s Category 
3 credits. See id.   at 9.   The ICA noted that “if the [f]amily 
[c]ourt determines that the judgment entered . . . was patently not more favorable to Wife than Husband’s offer, it should 
consider whether the awa rd of fees would be inequitable.”   Id.    
The ICA did not find the family court abused its discretion 
in awarding Wife attorney’s fees, and therefore affirmed the 
award. See id. 
Based in part on the foregoing, the ICA “(1) affirm[ed ] in 
part and vacate[d] in part the [d]ivorce [d]ecree; (2) vacate[d] 
the [f]amily [c]ourt’s denial of Husband’s request for HFCR Rule 
68 attorney’s fees; (3) 
affirm[ed] the Order Awarding Attorney’s 
Fees to Wife; and (4) remand[ed] the case for further 
proceedings consistent with this Summary Disposition Order.” Id. at 9–10. 
F.   Application for Writ of Certiorari 
As noted earlier, Wife presents two questions to this 
court: 
A.  Given [Husband’s] failure to document a consistent 
amount for his inheritance, 
show it was used for marital 
expenses, or rebut a presumption of gift to the marital partnership, did the ICA commit grave error when it 
substitute its own judgment for that of the trial judge, 
and vacated his ruling rejecting [Husband’s] demand for 
15
   
 
 
  
 
 
 
    
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
$134,235, $140,000, $190,000, $236,235, or $324,235, in 
Category 3 credits ? 
B. Given [Husband’s] failure to tender a comprehensive 
settlement offer as to all contested issues, offer to 
settle any one of the contested matters, or justify his request for fees with billings or time sheets, did the 
ICA commit gra
ve error when it substituted its  own 
judgment for that of the trial judge, and vacated his 
ruling denying [Husband’s] demand for HFCR Rule 68 fees 
and costs?  
We accepted certiorari and held oral argument on the 
Application. 
III. Standards of Review 
A. Family Court Decisions 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion 
in making its decisions and those decisions will not be set 
aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion.  
Thus, we will not disturb the family court ’s decision on 
appeal unless the family court disregarded rules or 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant and its decision clearly exceeded the 
bounds of reason.  
Kakinami v. Kakinami , 127 Hawai‘ i 126, 136, 276 P.3d 695, 705 
(2012) (quoting 
Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai ‘i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 
355, 360 (2006)).  
It is well established that a family court abuses its 
discretion where “(1) the family court disregarded rules or 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment 
of a party litigant; (2) the family court failed to exercise its equitable discretion; or (3) the family 
court’s decision clearly exceeds the bounds of reason.”  
Id. at 155-56, 276 P.3d at 724-25 (emphasis omitted) (quoting  
Tougas v. Tougas, 76 
Hawai‘i 19, 26, 868 P.2d 437, 444 (1994)).  
B. Property Division 
Hawaii’s appellate courts “review the family court’s final 
division and distribution of the estate of the parties under the 
16
   
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
abuse of discretion standard, in view of the factors set forth 
in HRS § 580-47 and partnership principles.” Tougas, 76 Hawai ‘i 
at 26, 868 P.2d at   444 (quoting Gussin v. Gussin , 73 Haw. 470, 
486, 836 P.2d 484, 492 (1992)
) (footnote omitted).    “The family 
court’s determination of whether facts present valid and 
relevant considerations authorizing a deviation from the 
partnership model division is a question of law that this court 
reviews under the right/wrong standard of appellate review. ” 
Gordon v. Gordon, 135 Hawai ‘i 340, 348, 350 P.3d 1008, 1016  
(2015) (citing Jackson v. Jackson , 84 Hawai ‘i 319, 332 –33, 933 
P.2d 1353, 1366–67 (App.  1997)).  
C. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law 
The family court’s FOFs are reviewed on appeal under 
the “clearly erroneous” standard. A [n] FOF is clearly 
erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial evidence to 
support the finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence in 
support of the finding, the appellate court is nonetheless 
left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has 
been made. “Substantial evidence” is credible evidence 
which is of sufficient quality and probative value to 
enable a person of reasonable caution to support a 
conclusion. 
On the other hand, the family court’s COLs are 
reviewed on appeal de novo, under the  right/wrong 
standard. 
COLs, consequently, are [ ]not binding 
upon an appellate court and are freely reviewable for their correctness.  
Kakinami, 127 Hawai ‘i at 136, 276 P.3d at 705 (quoting Fisher, 
111 Hawai‘ i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360).

IV. Discussion 
A. Husband’s Claimed Category 3 Credit 
We recently published a comprehensive opinion addressing 
alleged Category 3 credits 
similar to those at issue in this 
case. See Hamilton , 138 Hawaiʻ i 1 85, 378 P.3d 901.  In his 
Motion before the family court, Husband claimed that he should 
have been awarded $134,235 as Category 3 credit, consisting of 
the following:  
	 $40,000 in gifts from Husband’s father prior to his death in 2001 
(spent on couple’s former Waikele home , proceeds from which were 
spent on taxes, paying down Husband’s personal loan, the children’s 
educational expenses, and repairs to the Maunawili home ) 
 $74,235 – sum of checks received from Husband’s father’s estate 
(spent on a boat, an SUV, and improvements to the Maunawili home) 
  $20,000 –  value of an inherited annuity  (spent on installing a 
jacuzzi at the Maunawili home)    
 
Wife testified that she was unaware that Husband received 
funds from his father’s estate other than $10,000 that was 
gifted to each family member, including Husband, totaling 
$40,000. Wife was aware that Husband  “received money to make 
payments for . . . [ S]on’s tuition occasionally.”  
Although the family court was initially silent at the 
November 2, 2011 hearing as to why no Category 3 credit was 
given to Husband, at the March 14, 2012 hearing o n Husband’s 
Motion, the court explained its reasoning as follows: “the record is bereft of any competent or credib[le] evidence that 
[Husband’s inherited or gifted] monies were actually contributed 
to the marriage.” The ICA, however, found the family court 
18
   
 
 
    
   
 On remand, the family court must address Husband’s alleged 
Category 3 credits in light of this court’s rulings in Hamilton . 
In addressing the alleged Category 3 credits  , we also note that 
the parties had reached an outs  ide agreement  
with respect to the 
Maunawili home, with Wife purchasing  Husband’s share prior to  
trial. Accordingly, to the extent Husband may have invested any 
Category 3 credits into this particular marital partnership 
property, Husband may have already received credit for Category 
3 amounts he invested in this home. The family court must also 
address this issue. In addition, the family court must 
therefore address whether, pursuant to Hamilton, any of the 
alleged Category 3 amounts constituted gifts.  
  
 
 
  
 
      
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
erred by denying Category 3 credit on this basis. See Brutsch , 
SDO at 7. 
B. Attorney’s Fees Pursuant to HFCR Rule 68 
The second issue on certiorari concerns the family court’s 
denial of Husband’s HFCR Rule 68 motion for attorney’s fees, 
which the ICA vacated based on its decision in Owens v. Owens, 
104 Hawai i 292, 88 P.3d 664 (App. 2004) . In Owens
, the ICA held 
that the family court was required to address an HFCR Rule 68 
offer issue by issue. See id. at 310, 88 P.3d at 682. If the 
offer on an issue was not sufficiently specific or if the 
parties had settled an issue, Rule 68 fees would not be 
permitted for fees incurred on that issue. See id.  at 308 – 09, 
19
   
 
 
  
  
     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
88 P.3d at 680–81.  Otherwise, to ascertain whether fees should 
be awarded under Rule 68, the family court would need to examine 
the result on each remaining issue to see if the end result 
obtained by the offeree as a whole was patently not more 
favorable than the offer. See id. at 310, 88 P.3d at 682. 
Owens  was decided under a previous version of HFCR Rule 68, 
which required that if all requirements for the award of HFCR 
Rule 68 fees had been met, the court “shall make an award of 
reasonable attorney’s fees  and costs to the offeror unless it 
specifically determines that such an award would be inequitable, considering the provisions of HRS § 580-47.” Id.   Effective 
January 1, 2015, HFCR Rule 68 had been amended to omit the reference to HRS § 580-47.    
We recently held in Cox v. Cox, 138 Hawai i 476, 382 P.3d  
288 (2016), that HFCR  Rule 68 does not apply to proceedings 
governed by HRS § 580  -47.  HFCR Rule 68, which allows for an 
award of attorney’s fees in addition to costs, is quite 
different from Rule 6
8 of the Hawai i Rules of Civil Procedure,  
which only allows for costs. In Cox, in summary, we first ruled 
that HFCR Rule 68 contravenes HRS § 580-47 because while HRS § 
580-47(a) requires that an attorney fee award “shall appear just 
and equitable,” HFCR  Rule 68 mandates the awa rd of attorney’s 
fees to a party unless the court specifically determines that an 
award would be inequitable. See id.  at 481, 382 P.3d at 293.   
20
   
 
 
  
  
  
 
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Second, we concluded that HFCR Rule 68 abridges substantive 
rights of parties in violation of HRS § 602-11 (1985), which 
prohibits rules of practice and procedure from modifying the 
substantive rights of litigants, as the rule contravened the 
dictates of the governing statute, HRS § 580-47.  Finally, we 
pointed out that the operation of HFCR Rule 68 generated 
substantial complications due to inherent difficulties in 
applying its provisions.  See id.   
This divorce proceeding is governed by HRS § 580-47.  
Therefore, pursuant to Cox, Husband is not entitled to fees 
under HFCR Rule 68.  This case further highlights why we 
invalidated HFCR Rule 68 in divorce cases. 
First, the facts of this case illustrate the difficulty in 
applying HFCR Rule 68, as more fully explained in Cox. See  id.  
at 483-89, 382 P.3d at 295-301.  The HFCR Rule 68 offer in this case covers property division, child custody, child visitation, 
and child support. Husband’s 
property division offer includes 
specific offers as to retirement accounts, household effects, 
rattan chairs, personal items, children’s trust monies, the use 
and accounting thereof, payment of debts, child custody, child 
support, medical insurance for the children, uncovered medical 
expenses, orthodontic care expenses, tuition expenses, 
educational expenses, including after school care expenses, 
extracurricular activity expenses, school lunch expenses, time 
21
   
 
 
   
  
   
  
 
 
 
                         
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
sharing arrangements, and time sharing for special days. 
According to Owens, the family court would be required to 
evaluate 
Husband’s  offer issue by issue, and only allow fees for 
those issues on which Husband met HFCR Rule 68 requirements. This would appear contrary to Husband’s Rule 68 offer letter, 
which appears to have been a package deal as it  started by 
stating, “Please consider this a[] HFCR Rule 68 offer to settle 
all matters relating to this divorce.”  
Moreover, the Owens standard is extremely 
difficult to 
apply. Attorney fee billings are not itemized in minutes or 
hours spent on discrete issues such as those included in the 
HFCR Rule 68 offer in this case.6 In fact, in this case, 
Husband’s counsel did not keep hourly records, and estimated the 
time he had spent on child custody issues. As it did in this 
case, HFCR Rule 68 actually leads to substantial appellate 
litigation in divorce cases just on Rule 68 issues, as the 
parties argue its applicability and application.  Such protracted, contentious divorce proceedings are especially 
harmful when the divorcing couple has children. 
Because HFCR Rule 68 has been invalidated in divorce cases and is therefore 
inapplicable in this case, we do not address whether HFCR Rule 68 actually 
requires an evaluation of fees “issue by issue” or whether the offer must be 
compared to the judgment obtained as a whole.  We note that HFCR Rule does 
state that “[i]f the judgment in its entirety finally obtained by the offeree 
is patently not more favorable than the offer, the offeree must pay the costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees incurred after making of the 
offer, unless the court shall specially determine that such would be 
inequitable.”

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
With respect to children, this case illustrates an  
additional concern regarding an award of attorney’s fees under 
HFCR Rule 68 as stated in Cox.  Cox noted   that a threat to 
impose payment of attorney fees may deter a parent from seeking a custody determination that would be in the best interests of 
the child:  
This tendency to potentially coerce a settlement is 
all the more problematic in actions involving child custody   
and visitation, which are both subject to HFCR Rule 68 . .  
. .  Because the determination of the terms of custody and 
visitation is dictated by the “best interests of the 
child,” HRS § 571 -46 (Supp. 2013), . . .  “the possible 
impact on a party ’s pocketbook should have no influence on 
the child custody   issue.” . . . How ever, HFCR Rule 68’s 
threat of penalizing a party -offeree, by requiring payment 
of the party -offeror’ s attorney’ s fees, could “deter a 
party whose genuine concern for the best interests of the 
child is motivating him or her to contest the award of 
child custody   and/or visitation from continuing to contest 
the award of child custody   and/or visitation.”  
Id. at 487-88, 382 P.3d 299 -300 (footnote and some internal 
citations, brackets, and quotation marks omitted).   
Establishing a financial disincentive for a  parent to 
contest custody, when that parent has a legitimate concern for  
the best interests of the child, not only undermines the 
foundational principle of custody award determinations, but 
“[i]t is [also] contrary to societal interests” that such 
decisions are made without financial influence. Id.   In this 
case, Husband argued for HFCR Rule 68 fees on the grounds that 
the main issue at trial was child custody. Thus, the concerns 
expressed in Cox apply  .   
23

   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Importantly, in this case, the Child Custody Evaluator had 
recommended sole legal and physical custody to Wife.  Wife was 
therefore advocating for a decision on child custody which, in 
the court-appointed Child Custody Evaluator ’s view, was in the 
best interests of the minor children.  As factfinder, the family court was well within its discretion to rule otherwise, and we 
in no way question the joint custody ruling made by the family 
court. Yet, HFCR Rule 68 would on its face mandate an attorney 
fee award to Husband when he obtained a ruling contrary to the 
Child Custody Evalu ator’s recommendation . This case therefore 
illustrates how HFCR Rule 68 could not only be coercive, but could also run counter to the best interests of the child in 
child custody disputes. 
Along these lines, it must also be noted that HFCR Rule 68 
has a much more coercive impact on divorcing spouses with less 
financial resources as there exists the threat of having to pay 
a spouse’s attorney’s fees if one does not prevail on an issue 
in a divorce case, including an issue of child custody. In 
divorce cases, it is not unusual for one spouse to have much 
greater financial power.  There are many divorce cases in which 
one spouse remains unrepresented by an attorney.  In those 
cases, only the spouse with an attorney can take advantage of 
HFCR Rule 68. Thus, the spouse that cannot afford an attorney 
could be court ordered to pay the attorney fees of a spouse with 
24
   
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
 Finally, HRS § 580-47(a) and (f) allow  a family court to 
make orders that are “just and equitable,” including orders 
7 awarding attorney’s fees and costs.   Unfortunately, HFCR Rule 68  
                         
 
 
      
 
  
  
 
  
 
 7*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
significantly greater financial resources.  This was the exact 
situation in Cox. 
Even if both spouses 
had attorneys, as in this case, the 
spouse with greater economic power was in a much better position 
to make or reject a HFCR Rule 68 offer, knowing that he or she 
had the financial resources to withstand any later decision on 
fees. For the spouse without economic power, an adverse HFCR 
Rule 68 award could be financially devastating.  Therefore, HFCR 
Rule 68 was a potentially coercive tool for a spouse with 
economic resources to exercise power and control over the spouse 
without economic might. This concern was exacerbated in 
divorces involving domestic violence where the divorce was 
initiated by a battered spouse to end that power and control. 
  HRS § 580- 47 provides in pertinent part: 
§580-47 Support orders; division of property. (a) Upon 
granting a divorce . . .the court may make any further orders as 
shall appear just and equitable . . . (4) allocating, as between 
the parties, the responsibility for the . . . attorney ’s fees . 
. . incurred by each party by reason of the divorce. In making 
these further orders, the court shall take into consideration: 
the respective merits of the parties, the relative abilities of 
the parties, the condition in which each party will be left by 
the divorce, the burdens imposed upon either party for the 
benefit of the children of the parties, the concealment of or 
failure to disclose income or an asset, or violation of a restraining order issued under section 580 -10(a) or (b), if any, 
by either party, and all other circumstances of the case.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’ S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
allowed for the issuance of attorney fee orders in divorce cases 
that were not “just and equitable. ” For examp le, in this case, 
the family court had made an attorney fee and costs award in 
favor of Wife pursuant to HRS § 580-47, awarding her $21,984.46 
in fees and costs, and had denied Husband’s request for $15,500 
in fees under HFCR Rule 68; additional sums could  have been 
requested for subsequent litigation.   Yet, pursuant to its 
interpretations of HFCR Rule 68, the ICA ordered a remand for the family court to consider whether Husband should be entitled 
to HFCR Rule 68 fees. Therefore, the court rule contradicted 
and could have negated the family court’s award of “just and 
equitable” fees and costs  pursuant to the statute.  It is noted 
that even without HFCR Rule 68  being applicable to divorce 
cases, pursuant to HRS § 580-47, a family court  has full

to such motion and hearing as shall appear just and equitable

  The Dissent incorporates its opinion  in Cox  and reiterates 
its position that HFCR Rule 68 can be interpreted in a manner 
consistent with HRS § 580-47.  Based on reasons stated here and  
in Cox, we respectfully disagree. We reiterate that there is significant case precedent holding court rules inapplicable  
where they conflict with legislative mandates,  see Cox , 138 
Hawaii at 482-83, 382 P.3d at 294-95, and we note that pending 
cases are governed by existing rules, even if rule amendments  
8  applicable to future cases can be  made.

authority to be able to make attorney fee orders in divorce 
cases that are in fact just and equitable. 
This case involves an appeal of a family court order 
denying Husband’s motion for HFCR Rule 68 fees.  Husband brought 
the motion after the family 
court had already ordered Husband to 
pay Wife “just and equitable” attorney’s fees pursuant to HRS § 
580-47. Applying the existing language of HFCR Rule 68, the ICA 
vacated the family court’s order denying Husband’s motion , and 
ordered the family court to reconsider its ruling in light of that language. The conflict between the statute and the rule could not be more clear.  We therefore vacate the ICA’s ruling 
  The Family Court Rules Committee is able to propose a revised version of 
HFCR Rule 68 that conforms with HRS § 580 -47 and addresses the concerns 
expressed in Cox and in this case, including the presumptive entitlement to 
fees acknowledged by the Dissent, which conflicts with HRS § 580 -47.

V. Conclusion 
For these reasons
, the ICA’s SDO and Judgment on Appeal 
with respect to Husband’s cross -appeal is affirmed in part and 
vacated in part. The ICA’s ruling vacating in part the family 
court’s “Decree Granting Absolute Divorce and Awarding C hild

for gifts and inheritance, is affirmed pursuant to the 
supplemental instructions in this opinion. The ICA’s order

Reconsideration and for Rule 68 Attorney’s Fees Filed February 
16, 2012” and “Order Denying Plaintiff’s Motion for 
Reconsideration of Decision Announced March 14, 2012, Filed

Category 3 credits, but to the extent the ICA vacated these 
orders for the family court to address Husband’s HFCR Rule 68 motion, the ICA’s SDO and Judgment on A ppeal are vacated. This 
matter is remanded to the family court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
