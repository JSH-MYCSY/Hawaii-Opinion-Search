CITIBANK (SOUTH DAKOTA), N.A., Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee,
vs.
 
DYLAN THEDE, Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant.
  
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(CAAP-12-0000723; CIV. NO. 11-1-0115)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of petitioner/defendant-appellant 
Dylan Thede’s application for writ of certiorari, it appears that 
Thede’s application was due on September 2, 2015, which was 30 days after the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ August 3, 2015 judgment. Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 602-59(c) (Supp. 
2014); Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
40.1(a)(1) (2015). It further appears that Thede requested an extension of time on September 4, 2015, which was untimely and was appropriately denied. HRS § 602-59(c); HRAP Rule 40.1(a)(3). 
Thede’s application was filed on October 2, 2015. The
 
application is untimely and thus, this court lacks appellate
 jurisdiction. Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for writ of 
certiorari is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 20, 2015.
