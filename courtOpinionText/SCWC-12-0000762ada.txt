AND RECKTENWALD, C.J., DISSENTING,

OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J. 
The 2006 and 2015 versions of Hawai
ʻi Family Court 
Rules (HFCR) Rule 68 mandate an award of costs, including 
reasonable attorney’s fees, to a party who offers to settle 
certain classes of family court cases in the amount or upon the 
terms specified in the offer, if the offer is refused by the  
 
 
 
 
   
                                                        
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
offeree and “the judgment in its entirety finally obtained by 
the offeree is patently not more favorable than the offer, unless the court shall specifically determine that such would be 
inequitable.” 
The issue that we resolve in this case is whether 
Bruce Edward Cox (Husband) is entitled to appellate attorney’s 
fees pursuant to HFCR Rule 68. We hold that both the 2006 and 
2015 versions of HFCR Rule 68
1 do not apply to family court cases 
governed by Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 580-47 (Supp. 2011) 
for the following reasons: (1) the rule contravenes HRS § 580­
47; (2) it is analytically problematic with respect to cases 
subject to HRS § 580-47; (3) its application may be unsuited to 
principles of equity and justice inherent in matters commonly resolved in family court proceedings governed by HRS § 580-47; 
and (4) it may improperly coerce settlements. Hence, HRS § 580­
47 exclusively governs the determination of whether to award 
attorney’s fees in all cases to which HRS § 580-47 applies. 
Husband is therefore not entitled to appellate attorney’s fees 
under HFCR Rule 68. 
1 The 2006 and 2015 versions of HFCR Rule 68 are hereinafter 
collectively referred to as “HFCR Rule 68.” When a specific version of HFCR
Rule 68 is referred to, the year in which the version became effective isexpressly stated.

I. BACKGROUND 
This case stems from the divorce action by Bruce 
Edward Cox (Husband) against Carlyn Davidson Cox (Wife). While 
the divorce action was pending in the Family Court of the First 
Circuit (family court), Husband, through counsel, tendered a 
settlement offer to Wife, agreeing to pay Wife a property 
equalization in the amount of $9,000.2 Wife did not agree to the 
offer, the case was tried, and the family court ultimately issued a divorce decree that divided the parties’ property, retirement funds, insurance policies, securities, bank accounts, 
debts, and unpaid taxes. The divorce decree provided a final 
property equalization payment against Wife in the amount of 
$22,223.46. Thereafter, following an unsuccessful appeal by 
wife,
3 Husband moved in the family court for an award of post­
2 In full, the settlement offer was as follows: 
The property division shall be as outlined in this letter
and prior position statements (i.e., everybody keeps theassets and debts they have now, Mr. Cox to refinance the
Hawaiʻi property to remove Mrs. Cox from the mortgage, and
he will own the boat and motor still in storage in
Tennessee) and he will make a property equalization paymentof $9,000. He will also agree to Mrs. Cox’s participating
in the SBP program with her paying the premiums, if she so
elects to participate. 
3 Wife appealed from the divorce decree, and in Cox v. Cox, 125
Hawaiʻi 19, 250 P.3d 775 (2011), this court upheld the Intermediate Court of
Appeals’ affirmance of the divorce decree but held that the family court hadno jurisdiction to rule on an HFCR Rule 68 (2006) motion that had been filed
after Wife’s notice of appeal was filed from the divorce decree. The 
disposition of the appeal allowed Husband to refile his HFCR Rule 68 (2006)motion in the family court.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
offer attorney’s fees and costs, totaling $38,163.39, pursuant 
to HFCR Rule 68 (2006). Husband predicated his request on the fact that the family court’s decree that Wife pay Husband an 
equalization payment of $22,223.46 was patently not more 
favorable than Husband’s offer to pay Wife an equalization 
payment of $9,000. Husband did not address whether his request 
for post-offer fees and costs comported with equity and 
fairness. 
The family court granted the motion as to Husband’s 
post-offer trial fees and costs totaling $18,051.12 and denied the motion as to Husband’s appellate fees and costs (August 6, 
2012 family court order).
4 The family court concluded that 
because Husband’s offer included an equalization payment to Wife but the divorce decree instead ordered Wife to pay Husband an 
equalization payment, “Husband clearly prevailed at trial” and 
“is entitled to an award of fees.” The family court declined to 
award Husband his appellate costs because “[n]o Rule 68 offer 
was presented to Family Court regarding the appeal.” The family 
4 Specifically, the family court decided as follows: 
1) Husband shall be awarded the sum of $18,051.12 for an 
award of attorney’s fees and costs for trial, pursuant to
HFCR Rule 68. Husband shall be awarded a judgment against
Wife in the amount of $18,051.12 for the trial fees and 
costs he incurred at trial.  
2) Husband’s request for appellate costs shall be denied.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
court also opined that “even if Husband contends the appellate 
costs are automatically included in the Rule 69 [sic] offer,” the court would decline to award such costs and advised Husband 
“to consider applying to the appellate court for the award of 
his appellate fees and costs.” Nothing in the August 6, 2012 
family court order indicated that the award of post-offer trial 
fees and costs was consistent with equity or was made after due 
consideration of equitable factors and the totality of the 
circumstances pursuant to HRS § 580-47. 
Husband then appealed from the August 6, 2012 family 
court order, contending that the family court erred in denying his motion as to the appellate fees and costs related to Wife’s 
appeal. The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) vacated the 
August 6, 2012 family court order, concluding that appellate 
fees are recoverable under HFCR Rule 68 (2006) and remanding the 
case to the family court for a determination of whether an award 
of appellate fees to Husband would be inequitable pursuant to 
the provisions of HRS § 580-47.
5 Husband challenges on 
5 Pursuant to Hawaiʻ i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 39(d)
(2007), Husband filed a motion for appellate fees and costs incurred for his 
appeal to the ICA. In an order entered March 12, 2015, the ICA deniedHusband’s motion as follows: as to costs, the ICA concluded that Husband’s
counsel failed to provide supporting documentation, and as to fees, the ICA
reasoned that the denial was “without prejudice to an award by the Family
Court.” After Husband filed the requisite documentation for claimed costs,
the ICA, in an order entered April 9, 2015, awarded appellate costs toHusband; hence, the determination of those costs was not remanded for the
family court’s consideration. 
5
  
 
 
 
 
   The question presented on certiorari is whether 
Husband is entitled to appellate fees as a matter of law 
pursuant to HFCR Rule 68 (2006) because appellate fees, pursuant 
to the terms of 2006 version of HFCR Rule 68, are “incurred 
after the making of the offer.”6 The ICA, relying upon Nelson v. 
                                                        
   
 
 At any time more than 20 days before any contested
hearing held pursuant to HRS sections 571- 11 to 14 
(excluding law violations, criminal matters, and child
protection matters) is scheduled to begin, any party may 
serve upon the adverse party an offer to allow a judgment
to be entered to the effect specified in the offer. Such 
offer may be made as to all or some of the issues, such ascustody and visitation. . .  .  An offer not accepted shall
be deemed withdrawn and evidence thereof is not admissible,except in a proceeding to determine costs and attorney’s
fees. If the judgment in its entirety finally obtained by
the offeree is patently not more favorable than the offer,
the offeree must pay the costs, including reasonable
attorney’s fees incurred after the making of the offer,
unless the court shall specifically determine that such
would be inequitable  in accordance with the provisions of 
HRS section 580- 47 or other applicable statutes, as 
amended.  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
certiorari the ICA’s remand to the family court. He contends 
that he is entitled to appellate fees as a matter of law, that the equitable factors were already considered by the family 
court in awarding post-offer attorney’s fees for the trial 
proceedings, and that the family court’s denial of his request 
for appellate costs and fees deprived him of his constitutional 
rights to due process and equal protection.

University of Hawaiʻ i, 99 Hawai ʻi 262, 265, 54 P.3d 433, 436 
(2002), and Nakasone v. Nakasone, 102 Hawaiʻ i 177, 178, 73 P.3d 
715, 716 (2003), held that “appellate fees and costs . . . are 
necessarily incurred after the making of the Rule 68 offer and 
thus are included within the time frame set forth in the rule.” 
Cox v. Cox, 134 Hawaiʻ i 475, 344 P.3d 359 (App. 2015), cert. 
granted, No. SCWC-12-0000762, 2015 WL 3539785 (Haw. June 3, 
2015) (emphasis omitted).7 We therefore consider the application 
(. . . continued)
  
HFCR Rule 68 
(emphasis added).  The current iteration of Rule 68 (2015),
effective January 1, 2015, omits the reference to “provisions of HRS section
580-47 or other applicable statutes, as amended.”
 
7 Because of our disposition of this case, it is unnecessary to
reach the issue of whether HFCR Rule 68 authorizes the award of reasonable 
appellate fees and costs. However, in response to the dissent’s resolution
of this issue, we note that the plain language of HFCR Rule 68 expresslyobligates a party- offeree that rejected a settlement offer to “pay the costs, 
including reasonable attorney’s fees incurred after the making of the offer.”Hence, the only costs and attorney’s fees excluded by HFCR Rule 68, based on
its plain language, are those incurred prior to the making of the offer. 
According to the dissent, however, reading in pari materia HFCR
Rule 54 and Rule 68 yields the conclusion that HFCR Rule 68 applies only totrial fees and costs incurred by a party
-offeror after the making of the 
offer. But the plain language of HFCR Rule 68 does not state that the costsare limited to those incurred before the family court renders a judgment
within the meaning of that term under HFCR Rule 54(a). 
See  Cox v. Cox, 134 
Hawaiʻi 475, 344 P.3d 359 (App. 2015), cert. granted, No. SCWC- 12-0000762, 
2015 WL 3539785 (Haw. June 3, 2015); Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawaiʻ i 
245, 256, 195 P.3d 1177, 1188 (2008) (“[W]here the statutory language isplain and unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and 
obvious meaning.” (quoting In re Contested Case Hearing on Water Use Permit
Application, 116 Hawaiʻ i 481, 489– 90, 174 P.3d 320, 328– 29 (2007))). 
The dissent uses the definition of “judgment” under HFCR Rule
54(a) to confine the expansive plain language of HFCR Rule 68 to costs and
fees incurred before a judgment is rendered. 
However, the definition of a
“judgment” under HFCR Rule 54(a) states only that it “includes a decree andany order from which an appeal lies.” Reading the definition of a “judgment”
under HFCR Rule 54(a) in pari materia with Rule 68 results only in theconstruction that the term “judgment” under Rule 68 “includes a decree and

A. HFCR Rule 68 Does Not Apply to Cases Governed by HRS § 580-47 
1. HFCR Rule 68 Contravenes HRS § 580-47 
Nothing in HRS § 580-47 mandates the family court to 
award attorney’s fees to a party in a divorce action.8 Indeed, 
(. . . continued)
  
any order from which an appeal lies.” 
Hence, such decrees and orders “in
their entirety” qualify as a “judgment” that must be evaluated by the family
court as to whether they are “patently not more favorable than the offer.”
HFCR Rule 68. HFCR Rule 54 does not delimit fees and costs awardable under 
Rule 68 to those incurred prior to the family court’s judgment.
 
8 HRS § 580- 47 provides, in pertinent part, 
(a)
 Upon granting a divorce, . . . if . . .
jurisdiction . . . is reserved under the decree by
agreement of both parties or by order of court after
finding that good cause exists, the court may make 
any further orders as shall appear just and equitable  
. . . allocating, as between the parties, theresponsibility for the payment of the debts of the
parties whether community, joint, or separate, and
the attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses incurred by
each party by reason of the divorce. In making these
further orders, the court shall take into
consideration: the respective merits of the parties,
the relative abilities of the parties, the condition
in which each party will be left by the divorce, the
burdens imposed upon either party for the benefit ofthe children of the parties, the concealment of or
failure to disclose income or an asset, or violation
of a restraining order issued under section 580- 10(a) 
or (b), if any, by either party, and all other circumstances of the case. . . . 
(b)
 An order as to the custody, management, and
division of property and as to the payment of debts
and the attorney’s fees, costs and expenses incurred
in the divorce shall be final and conclusive as to both parties subject only to appeal as in civil

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
an award of attorney’s fees is discretionary, with the 
significant caveat that such an award “shall appear just and 
equitable.” HRS § 580-47(a); see Owens v. Owens , 104 Hawaiʻ i 
292, 307, 88 P.3d 664, 679 (App. 2004) (“The award of attorney’s 
fees under HRS § 580-47 is discretionary.”). Additionally, HRS 
§ 580-47 instructs the family court, in awarding attorney’s 
fees, to consider the following: 
the respective merits of the parties, the relative
abilities of the parties, the condition in which each party
will be left by the divorce, the burdens imposed upon 
(. . . continued)  
cases. The court shall at all times, including
during the pendency of any appeal, have the power togrant any and all orders  . . . to compel either party 
to advance reasonable amounts for the expenses of the
appeal including attorney’s fees to be incurred by
the other party, and to amend and revise such orders
from time to time. 
. . . . 
(f) Attorney’s fees and costs. The court 
hearing any motion for orders either revising an
order for the custody, support, maintenance, and
education of the children of the parties, or an order
for the support and maintenance of one party by theother, or a motion for an order to enforce any such
order or any order made under subsection (a) of this
section,
 may make such orders requiring either party 
to pay or contribute to the payment of the attorney’sfees, costs, and expenses of the other party relatingto such motion and hearing as shall appear just and
equitable  after consideration of the respective 
merits of the parties, the relative abilities of theparties, the economic condition of each party at the
time of the hearing, the burdens imposed upon either
party for the benefit of the children of the parties,
the concealment of or failure to disclose income or 
an asset, or violation of a restraining order issuedunder section 580- 10(a) or (b), if any, by either 
party, and all other circumstances of the case. 
HRS § 580

either party for the benefit of the children of the
parties, the concealment of or failure to disclose income
or an asset, or violation of a restraining order issued 
under section 580- 10(a) or (b), if any, by either party, 
and all other circumstances of the case. 
HRS § 580-47(a). 
In contrast, HFCR Rule 68 mandates the award of 
attorney’s fees to a party who tenders a settlement offer that 
the other party refuses to accept “[i]f the judgment in its 
entirety finally obtained by the offeree is patently not more 
favorable than the offer . . . unless the court shall 
specifically determine that such would be inequitable.” HFCR 
Rule 68. Absent such a specific finding, the offeree must pay 
the “reasonable attorney’s fees incurred after the making of the offer.” HFCR Rule 68. 
Hence, the framework of the rule appears to be in 
conflict with the statute because, while the statute vests the 
family court with discretion to determine, as shall appear just 
and equitable, whether attorney’s fees should be awarded to a 
party, HRS § 580-47(a) (stating that “the court may make . . 
. orders as shall appear just and equitable . . . allocating . . . the attorney’s fees” (emphasis added)), the rule reformulates 
the family court’s statutory-based discretion and instead requires the family court to award attorney’s fees to a party­
offeror so long as the judgment in its entirety is patently not 
more favorable than the offer, 
see HFCR Rule 68 (specifying that 
10
  
 
 
 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
“the offeree must pay the costs, including reasonable attorney’s 
fees” (emphasis added)), which can be avoided only after a 
court’s specific finding that payment of costs would be 
inequitable. 
Thus, while HRS § 580-47(a) requires the family court 
to consider a host of factors and the totality of the 
circumstances to determine whether it is just and equitable to 
award a party attorney’s fees, consideration of presumably the 
same or similar equitable factors under HFCR Rule 68 are relegated to a mere afterthought,
 see HFCR Rule 68 (mandating an 
award of attorney’s fees “unless the court shall specifically determine that such would be inequitable in accordance with the 
provisions of HRS section 580-47 or other applicable statutes”). 
The 2015 version of HFCR Rule 68 is even more problematic than 
the 2006 version because it omits the phrase “in accordance with 
the provisions of HRS section 580-47 or other applicable 
statutes, as amended.” By deleting the reference to HRS § 580­
47, HFCR Rule 68 now appears to have been decoupled from the statute. Thus, the current form of HFCR Rule 68 does not 
provide any guidance or standard for its mandate that reasonable 
post-offer attorney’s fees should not be awarded if “such would 
be inequitable,” making it susceptible of subjective and 
differing applications. 
11

  
 
 
 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
As stated, HRS § 580-47 directs the family court to 
determine the equity and justice of awarding attorney’s fees 
based on a multifactor analysis in the course of deciding 
whether to award such fees. HFCR Rule 68, on the other hand, 
treats the award of attorney’s fees to a party-offeror as 
presumptively mandatory--a presumption absent from the statute-­
and to be overridden only if the family court specifically finds 
such an award to be inequitable. Viewed another way, while HRS 
§ 580-47 places the burden on the offeror to demonstrate that an award of attorney’s fees is just and equitable, HFCR Rule 68 
inherently places the burden on the offeree to show the 
opposite. Hence, as a practical matter, under HFCR Rule 68, the 
offeror need only show to the family court the terms of the 
offer and illustrate how the judgment obtained is patently not 
more favorable than the terms of the offer. Once the offeror 
makes this showing, the presumption that the offeror is entitled 
to attorney’s fees attaches, and it becomes incumbent upon the 
offeree to demonstrate that an award of post-offer attorney’s fees to the offeror would be inequitable under HRS § 580-47 or 
another statute. The rule creates, in essence, a presumption of 
fairness and equity upon a finding that the judgment is patently 
not more favorable than the offer, whereas the statute requires 
an affirmative showing of fairness and equity. In design and 
12
  
 
 
 
 
   The inconsistency of HFCR Rule 68’s mandate to that of 
HRS § 580-47 is clearly demonstrated in this case. After 
Husband moved for post-offer attorney’s fees and costs, the 
family court determined that he is “entitled to an award of fees 
pursuant to [HFCR] Rule 68” because Wife was ordered “to pay 
Husband the sum of $22,222.36 as an equalization payment” while 
“Husband’s Rule 68 offer to Wife was for Husband to pay Wife the sum of $9,000.00 as an equalization payment.” Thus, the family 
court applied the presumptive mandate of HFCR Rule 68 to award 
Husband his post-offer trial fees and costs because, in the 
family court’s view, Wife obtained a judgment not patently more 
favorable than Husband’s offer. Nothing in the family court’s 
determination indicates that the award of attorney’s fees was 
consistent with principles of fairness and equity and that the 
award was made in consideration of the totality of the 
circumstances. This is to be expected, since the language of HFCR Rule 68--“unless the court shall specifically determine 
that such would be inequitable”--signifies that consideration of 
equitable factors under “HRS § 580-47 or other applicable 
statutes” is subsidiary to the threshold determination of 
whether post-offer fees and costs should be awarded based on the 
“patently not more favorable” test; an assessment of the***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
effect, the test under the rule is different from the test under 
the statute. 
13  
 
 
 
 
   
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
statutory criteria is merely a secondary inquiry meant to 
potentially override the rule’s presumptive mandate to award a party-offeror’s post-offer fees and costs when the “patently not 
more favorable” test has been met. 
On the other hand, had Husband requested attorney’s 
fees pursuant to HRS § 580-47, the cardinal consideration of the 
family court would have been whether such an award appears just 
and equitable, not whether the judgment as a whole is patently 
not more favorable than the settlement offer. In such an instance, the family court’s order in this case would not have 
sufficed because it is silent as to how the attorney fee award 
to Husband is just and equitable in light of the HRS § 580-47 
factors and the totality of the circumstances. 
2.  HFCR Rule 68 Abridges Substantive Rights 
The Hawai
ʻi Constitution accords this court the “power 
to promulgate rules and regulations in all civil and criminal 
cases for all courts relating to process, practice, procedure and appeals, which shall have the force and effect of law.” 
Haw. Const. art. VI, § 7. “However, pursuant to HRS § 602–11 
(1985), ‘[s]uch rules shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify the 
substantive rights of any litigant, nor the jurisdiction of any 
of the courts, nor affect any statute of limitations.’” In re 
Doe, 77 Hawaiʻ i 109, 113, 883 P.2d 30, 34 (1994) (alteration in 
original) (emphasis added). Where a court-made rule affecting
14  
 
 
 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
litigants’ substantive rights contravenes the dictates of a 
parallel statute, the rule must give way. See In re Doe 
Children,  94 Hawai
ʻi 485, 487, 17 P.3d 217, 219 (2001) (holding 
that HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) cannot be construed “in such a way as to modify the requisite deadline for filing an HRS § 571–54 motion 
for reconsideration and the subsequent notice of appeal,” and 
thus, “HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) is inapplicable to family court cases 
governed by HRS § 571–54”). 
Here, HFCR Rule 68 abridges the substantive rights 
of parties in family court proceedings because, as discussed, it 
modifies the standard by which the family court should decide 
whether to award post-offer attorney’s fees to the party­
offeror. 
Cf. Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. Allstate 
Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393, 407 (2010) (“What matters is what the 
rule itself regulates: If it governs only ‘the manner and the 
means’ by which the litigants’ rights are ‘enforced,’ it is 
valid; if it alters ‘the rules of decision by which [the] court 
will adjudicate [those] rights,’ it is not.” (quoting Miss. 
Publ’g Corp. v. Murphree, 326 U.S. 438, 446 (1946))). That HFCR 
Rule 68 modifies the governing standard for awarding post-offer attorney’s fees is even more apparent in the 2015 version of the 
rule, which explicitly decoupled the analytical framework from 
that prescribed by HRS § 580-47. By conferring on a party to a 
family court proceeding a presumptive entitlement to post-offer
15  
 
 
 
 
    
                                                        
   
 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
attorney’s fees, HFCR Rule 68 creates a decisional framework 
that is inconsistent with the legislature’s manifest directive in HRS § 580-47 that attorney’s fees may be discretionarily 
awarded to a party only if such an award “shall appear just and 
equitable” after considering the factors outlined in the statute 
and the totality of the circumstances. See Bank of Haw. v. 
Shinn
, 120 Hawai
ʻi 1, 8, 200 P.3d 370, 377 (2008) (“Allowing a 
party, through reliance on HRCP Rule 5(a), to avoid giving 
notice to a party in default prior to extension of a judgment 
would eviscerate the legislature’s unmistakable mandate in HRS § 
657–5 that ‘[n]o extension shall be granted without notice.’”); 
In re Doe, 77 Hawaiʻ i at 113, 883 P.2d at 34 (resolving the 
conflict between HFCR 59(g)(1) and HRS § 571–54 in favor of the 
statute and holding HFCR Rule 59(g)(1) void as “Rule 59(g)(1) 
mandates an earlier motion deadline than does the statute and consequently infringes on an aggrieved party’s right to appeal 
by curtailing the time in which to file a timely notice of 
appeal”).

9 As a related matter, a bedrock principle of constitutional law is
the recognition that the right to care, custody, and control of one’s
children is a fundamental liberty interest. In re RGB,  123 Hawaiʻ i 1, 229 
P.3d 1066 (2010) (stating “that article 1, section 5 of the Hawaiʻi 
Constitution provides parents a ‘substantive liberty interest in the care,
custody, and control of their children,’ independent of the United States
Constitution” (quoting In re Doe, 99 Hawaiʻ i 522, 533, 57 P.3d 447, 458
(2002))). Although this fundamental right is not involved here because the
parties did not have minor children at the time this divorce action wascommenced, there certainly are cases where application of HFCR Rule 68 could

3. 
Consequently, because HFCR Rule 68 affects substantive 
rights of parties in a divorce proceeding and it is in 
derogation of HRS § 580-47, we hold that HFCR Rule 68 is 
inapplicable to cases governed by HRS § 580-47.10 
Correspondingly, in cases within the purview of HRS § 580-47, 
requests for attorney’s fees and costs must be evaluated 
pursuant to the factors and circumstances set forth in HRS § 
580-47(a) and (f) in order to determine that an award of such 
fees and costs is just and equitable.11 
(. . . continued) 
potentially infringe upon fundamental parental rights by coercing parents to
settle on matters of custody and visitation because of the looming threat of
paying the other party’s attorney’s fees. See 
infra Part II.B.2. In that 
regard, HFCR Rule 68 clearly affects substantive rights. 
10 Because this case is one that is governed by HRS § 580- 47, we 
intimate no opinion as to the applicability of HFCR Rule 68 to family court
cases not governed by HRS § 580- 47. 
11 Although Husband generally argues that the family court violated
his constitutional due process and equal protection rights, he makes nodiscernible argument with respect to each and, aside from making conclusory
allegations, does not attempt to show that the facts and circumstances of
this case satisfy the elements of due process and equal protection claims.
Because this “court is not obliged to address matters for which the appellant
has failed to present discernible arguments,” there is no need for this courtto reach the due process and equal protection issues. 
Haw. Ventures, LLC v. 
Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawaiʻ i 438, 478— 79, 164 P.3d 696, 736— 37 (2007); see  Norton 
v. Admin. Dir. of the Court,
 80 Hawaiʻ i 197, 200, 908 P.2d 545, 548 (1995)
(observing that this court may “disregard [a] particular contention” if
appellant “makes no discernible argument in support of that position”). 
Further, because we hold that HFCR Rule 68 does not apply to
cases governed by HRS § 580- 47, Husband’s argument that he was deprived of 
due process and equal protection rights based on the family court’s alleged
violation of HFCR Rule 68 need not be addressed. 
17
  
 
 
 
 
   In addition to HFCR Rule 68’s inconsistency with HRS § 
580-47, the rule is also often analytically unworkable, commonly 
unsuited to issues typically implicated in family court 
proceedings governed by HRS § 580-47, and may improperly coerce 
parties to settle.  
  HFCR Rule 68 is similar to Hawaiʻ i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (Civil Procedure Rule or HRCP) Rule 68 (1999).12 See

B. The Operation of HFCR Rule 68 Generates Substantial
Complications 
1. The Inherent Difficulties in Applying HFCR Rule 68 
12 Civil Procedure Rule 68 provides as follows: 
At any time more than 10 days before the trial
begins, any party may serve upon any adverse party an offer
of settlement or an offer to allow judgment to be taken
against either party for the money or property or to the 
effect specified in the offer, with costs then accrued. Ifwithin 10 days after the service of the offer the adverseparty serves written notice that the offer is accepted,
either party may then file the offer and notice of
acceptance together with proof of service thereof and
thereupon the clerk shall, in accordance with the
agreement, enter an order of dismissal or a judgment. Anoffer not accepted shall be deemed withdrawn and evidence
thereof is not admissible except in a proceeding to
determine costs. 
If the judgment finally obtained by the
offeree is not more favorable than the offer, the offeree
must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer.
The fact that an offer is made but not accepted does not
preclude a subsequent offer. When the liability of one
party to another has been determined by verdict or order or
judgment, but the amount or extent of the liability remains
to be determined by further proceedings, either party maymake an offer of judgment, which shall have the same effect
as an offer made before trial if it is served within a 
reasonable time not less than 10 days prior to the
commencement of hearings to determine the amount or extent
of liability.   
HRCP Rule 68 (1999) (emphasis 
added).

Criss v. Kunisada,  89 Hawaiʻ i 17, 968 P.2d 184 (App. 1998) 
(noting that Civil Procedure Rule 68 and its family court 
counterpart, HFCR Rule 68, “cover[] the same subject”). 
However, a rule that requires a party-offeree who rejects a settlement offer to pay the party-offeror’s attorney’s fees if 
the judgment obtained is not patently more favorable than the 
offer is frequently problematic in the realm of family court 
proceedings. See In re Marriage of Saunders, 975 P.2d 927, 929— 
30 (Or. Ct. App. 1999) (reasoning that the Oregon civil 
procedure rule similar to HRCP Rule 68 does not apply to 
dissolution cases and that those cases must be governed by a 
statute similar to HRS § 580-47, which requires the family court 
to exercise its discretion to award attorney’s fees after conducting a multifactor analysis and considering the totality 
of the circumstances); Mohr v. Mohr, 573 S.E.2d 729, 731 (N.C. 
Ct. App. 2002) (holding that “offers of judgment are 
inconsistent with [North Carolina’s] framework for determining 
child custody”); Leeming v. Leeming, 490 P.2d 342, 344 (Nev. 
1971) (concluding that Nevada’s version of HRCP Rule 68 is 
“inapplicable to divorce proceedings” because they “involve entirely different social considerations than other civil

actions” and “to hold [Rule] 68 applicable to divorce matters 
would be incompatible with the pattern and policy of our law”).13 
Determining whether “the judgment  in its entirety 
finally obtained by the offeree is patently not more favorable than the offer,” as required by HFCR Rule 68 (emphases added), 
is incompatible with the nature of issues commonly involved in 
family court proceedings subject to HRS § 580-47 and 
consequently results in considerable complications. The ICA has 
held “that an offer of settlement pursuant to [HFCR Rule 68] may be made concerning any item as to which ‘a decree or order’ may 
be entered, and is not required to encompass all issues in a 
divorce proceeding.” Criss, 89 Hawaiʻ i at 18, 968 P.2d at 185.  
The item, for example, may involve custody, visitation, property 
division, or child or spousal support. In comparing an HFCR 
Rule 68 offer to the family court’s final judgment, the ICA has 
explained that the comparison should be done “issue by issue.” 
Owens v. Owens
, 104 Hawaiʻ i 292, 309—10, 88 P.3d 664, 681—82 
(App. 2004). In Criss, the ICA concluded that “Wife’s Rule 68 
offer with respect to custody must be compared ‘as a whole’ to 
13 The North Carolina Court of Appeals, in Mohr, identified Hawaiʻ i 
as an example of a jurisdiction that defies “a clear trend to hold offers of
judgment [pursuant to a civil procedure rule] inapplicable in the context of
domestic relations.” Mohr, 573 S.E.2d at 731 (enumerating Nevada, Colorado, 
Florida, and Massachusetts as examples of jurisdictions that havespecifically exempted domestic relations cases from civil procedure rules
governing offers of judgment and citing Criss  as a case that applied a family 
court rule governing offers of judgment to custody actions).

those terms of the divorce decree to which the offer was 
directed, i.e., custody.” Criss, 89 Hawaiʻ i at 25, 968 P.2d at 
192. The ICA may have reasoned that HFCR Rule 68 required an 
item-by-item comparison because in family court cases, where a 
judgment often resolves issues relating to child custody and 
visitation, child and spousal support, valuation of real and 
personal property, stocks and securities, bank accounts and 
retirement funds, and tax liability, the comparative analysis 
that Rule 68 requires would be analytically unmanageable if 
combinations of nonmonetary variables and monetary variables are 
weighed against each other. See In re Marriage of Saunders,  975 
P.2d at 930 (characterizing the evaluation of the different aspects of a divorce judgment in order to determine whether the judgment is more favorable than a party’s offer as 
“intrinsically impossible”). Although the issue-by-issue 
approach appears practical from a logical standpoint, we note 
that the ICA’s interpretation appears to contravene the plain 
language of HFCR Rule 68, which requires a comparison between a 
“judgment in its entirety” and the offer.
14 HFCR Rule 68. 
Further, severing different aspects of a judgment, as the ICA 
has suggested, in order to compare each item to a corresponding 
14 In light of our disposition in this case, we need not resolve
this question. 
21
  
 
 
 
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
portion of an offer does not simplify the comparative analysis 
required under HFCR Rule 68. 
Consider, under an item-by-item analysis, an offer by 
Party A that provides primary physical custody of the parties’ children to Party A and that allows Party B once-per-week 
visitation rights. If the judgment awards Party B primary 
physical custody and once-per-week visitation rights to Party A­
-that is, the exact opposite of what the offer provided--there 
is little doubt that the judgment is patently more favorable than the offer, and the family court should not award post-offer 
attorney’s fees and costs to Party A. The difficult 
complication arises in cases where an item in the offer differs 
slightly from the parallel item in the final judgment. Suppose 
the judgment awards Party A primary physical custody of the 
children and gives Party B an extra day of visitation in 
alternate months. Is the judgment obtained, despite the 
additional visitation days, “patently not more favorable” than 
the offer even though, in Party B’s view, the extra visitation is critical to the children’s well-being? To what extent must 
the visitation days awarded in the judgment exceed those 
contained in the offer in order for the offeree to surmount the 
“patently not more favorable” threshold and avoid paying the 
offeror’s post-offer attorney’s fees and costs? The obvious 
answer is that it is unclear, for the weight that parties to
22  
 
 
 
 
    
  
 
                                                        
   
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
family court proceedings ascribe to different aspects of the 
judgment undoubtedly differs in every case. See Leeming , 490 
P.2d at 345 (reasoning that “an offer’s ‘favorable’ character 
will often depend on the parties’ personal goals”).15 
In short, the comparative analysis embodied by HFCR 
Rule 68 is analytically problematic given the issues and 
concerns that a family court judgment typically encompasses in 
cases governed by HRS § 580-47, and the ICA’s efforts to make 
the required analysis workable do not resolve difficulties associated with the application of HFCR Rule 68 to nontangible, 
nonmonetary aspects of a family court judgment in such cases. 
2. The Magnitude and Expansive Reach of HFCR Rule 68 
Not only are the sanctions provided for in HFCR Rule 
68 problematic in the context of family court proceedings, the 
rule’s breadth and character are also remarkably more extensive than the parallel Civil Procedure Rule 68, such that, under 
15 The analytical difficulties attendant to the family court’s
obligation to apply the dictates of HFCR Rule 68 are paralleled by the
decisional difficulties that parties to family court proceedings must undergo
once the rule is triggered by a settlement offer. The decision of whether to 
accept an HFCR Rule 68 offer is remarkably complex because, as mentioned, family court judgments encompass the resolution of various issues, many of
which are not readily convertible to purely monetary terms. Since equity and
justice (not hard- and-fast, black- letter rules) permeate judicial decision-
making in family court proceedings, a party- offeree and counsel do not 
necessarily have the informational base to reasonably appraise whether anHFCR Rule 68 offer should be accepted because a subsequent family court
judgment would be patently not more favorable than the offer. 
23
  
 
 
certain facts and circumstances, the rule may coerce, rather 
than just encourage, a settlement. Under Civil Procedure Rule 68, this court has unequivocally held “that ‘costs’ . . . do not 
include attorneys’ fees.” 
Collins v. S. Seas Jeep Eagle , 87 
Hawaiʻi 86, 90, 952 P.2d 374, 378 (1997).  In contrast, HFCR Rule 
68 is unambiguous in its express requirement that a party­
offeree who obtains a judgment not patently more favorable than 
the offer must pay “reasonable attorney’s fees incurred after 
the making of the offer.”16 As this court has recognized in 
Collins, “the inclusion or exclusion of attorneys’ fees within the definition of ‘costs’ will make a significant difference in 
a plaintiff’s consideration of whether to accept or reject an 
offer of judgment.” Id. at 88, 952 P.2d at 376. The express 
inclusion of reasonable attorney’s fees as awardable costs under 
 
 
                                                         
  
  
   
  
 
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
16 The expansiveness of HFCR Rule 68 is further underscored by
comparing it to its federal counterpart. The Supreme Court of the United
States has held that the phrase “judgment . . . obtained by the offeree”
means that the “plain language of [FRCP] Rule 68 confines its effect to . . .case[s] in which the plaintiff has obtained a judgment for an amount less
favorable than the defendant’s settlement offer.” 
Delta Air Lines v. August, 
450 U.S. 346, 351 (1981).  That is, “it is clear that [FRCP Rule 68] applies
only to offers made by the defendant and only to judgments obtained by the
plaintiff.” Id. at 352. 
Because the judgment in August was in favor of the 
defendant- offeror and against the plaintiff- offeree, the Court concluded that 
FRCP Rule 68 was “simply inapplicable to this case because it was the defendant that obtained the judgment.” Id. 
In contrast, the plain language
of HFCR Rule 68 permits an award of post
-offer costs even in instances where 
the judgment obtained favors the defendant- offeror and is against the 
plaintiff- offeree since “any party  may serve upon the adverse party an offer 
to allow a judgment to be entered to the effect specified in the offer.”
HFCR Rule 68 (emphasis added); cf.  Kikuchi v. Brown, 110 Hawaiʻ i 204, 209, 130 
P.3d 1069, 1074 (App. 2006) (holding the same with respect to Civil Procedure
Rule 68). 
24
  
 
 
HFCR Rule 68 renders this rule significantly more potent than 
Civil Procedure Rule 68, since attorney’s fees are generally not insubstantial even in the least contentious of cases. In this 
case, for example, the family court determined that Husband is 
entitled to post-offer trial fees and costs of $18,051.12. 
 
 
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The more potent nature of HFCR Rule 68 is further 
illustrated by a comparison of the respective frameworks in 
which HFCR Rule 68 and Civil Procedure Rule 68 operate. 
Under 
the Civil Procedure Rules, prevailing parties as a matter of 
course are awarded costs. HRCP Rule 54(d)(1) (providing that 
“costs shall be allowed as of course  to the prevailing party” 
unless a statute, Civil Procedure Rule, or the court otherwise directs (emphasis added)). Hence, “[i]f the offer is rejected, 
and the offeree ultimately obtains a judgment that is less 
favorable than the offer, the offeree must pay the offeror’s 
post-offer costs, and the offeree is precluded from obtaining 
his or her post-offer costs.” Collins, 87 Hawaiʻ i at 88, 952 
P.2d at 376. If an offeree “rejects a [Civil Procedure] Rule 68 
settlement offer, he [or she] will lose some of the benefits of 
victory if his [or her] recovery is less than the offer.” 
Id. 
(emphasis added) (quoting  Delta Air Lines v. August,  450 U.S. 
346, 352 (1981)). The prevailing offeree essentially forfeits his or her entitlement to costs under Civil Procedure Rule 54 
and must instead pay the offeror’s respective costs. 
Id. Thus,
25  
 
 
 
 
  
  
                                                        
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
under Civil Procedure Rule 68, the penalty that may encourage 
offerees to settle is the possibility of foregoing some attendant “benefits of victory” that are recoverable as a matter 
of course pursuant to the Civil Procedure Rules. Id. (quoting 
August 
, 450 U.S. at 352); see HRCP Rule 54. 
The same framework does not underlie family court 
proceedings. The Hawai
ʻi Family Court Rules do not include a 
provision requiring a party as a matter of course to pay the 
other party’s costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees. 
Compare HFCR Rule 54(d) (stating that “[c]osts shall be allowed 
where expressly provided by statute, stipulation, agreement, 
order, or these rules”), with
 Civil Procedure Rule 54(d)(1).17 
Thus, the possible penalty, under HFCR Rule 68, for the party­
offeree who declines an offer is not merely to forego something 
that he or she would commonly receive as an incident to winning 
the litigation; instead, the penalty is the payment of something 
that does not normally accrue as a matter of course to a party 
in family court proceedings, i.e., costs and attorney’s fees. 
See HRS § 580-47. Plainly, a party stands to lose more, both in 
17 Indeed, one can posit that HFCR’s lack of a provision that
closely parallels Civil Procedure Rule 54 is due to the fact that, in family
court cases, judgments rendered often contain different aspects and forms of
relief that can make it difficult to identify who is the “prevailing party.”See HRCP Rule 54(d)(1). 
26
  
 
 
 
 
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
kind and in magnitude, under HFCR Rule 68 than under Civil 
Procedure Rule 68. 
Consequently, there may be instances where HFCR Rule 
68 would go beyond merely effectuating the purpose for which it was created--to “encourage settlements . . . before a contested 
matrimonial trial or a contested hearing for an order is 
scheduled to begin.” 
Nakasone v. Nakasone , 102 Hawaiʻ i 177, 181, 
73 P.3d 715, 719 (2003) (quoting Criss, 89 Hawaiʻ i at 22, 968 
P.2d at 189). Decision-making in which parties to a family 
court proceeding engage in the course of litigation too often 
involves “interrelated as well as unrelated motives and 
problems, where far more may be at stake than the mere dollar 
amount of a support award.” Leeming, 490 P.2d at 345. By 
subjecting such sensitive and often emotionally charged decision-making to the threat of paying the other party’s attorney’s fees, under some factual scenarios, HFCR Rule 68 has 
the tendency to coerce a party to settle instead of simply 
encouraging settlements. 
This tendency to potentially coerce a settlement is 
all the more problematic in actions involving child custody and 
visitation, which are both subject to HFCR Rule 68 (stating that 
a judgment offered under the rule “may be made as to all or some 
27

  
 
 
 
 
                                                         
  
 
 
 
   
  
   
     
  
 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of the issues, such as custody and visitation”).18 Because the 
determination of the terms of custody and visitation is dictated 
by the “best interests of the child,” HRS § 571-46 (Supp. 2013), 
the ICA has thoughtfully observed that “the possible impact on a 
party’s pocketbook should have no influence on the child custody 
18 HFCR Rule 68 has been utilized in cases involving child custody
and visitation that illustrate the problematic application of the rule. In 
Criss, a party made an offer of settlement awarding herself “the care, 
custody, and control of the child, . . . subject to [Husband’s] rights of
reasonable visitation.” 89 Hawaiʻ i at 19, 968 P.2d at 186. The issue was 
whether the family court’s judgment, which paralleled the wife’s offer but
provided more details as to the husband’s visitation rights, was patently not
more favorable than the wife’s offer. Because the wife’s offer was prefaced
by the phrase, “The following is [Wife’s HFCR] Rule 68 offer of settlement to 
[Husband] on the issue of child custody,” id., the ICA concluded that the 
more detailed terms on visitation rights in the family court’s decree wereimmaterial and that the decree, having the identical terms on custody as the
wife’s offer, was therefore patently not more favorable than the offer. 
Id.  
at 25, 968 P.2d at 192. 
In Owens, the wife’s offer included terms relating “to custody, 
visitation, amount of child support, monies owed to each other, and
attorney’s fees and costs.” 104 Hawaiʻ i at 308, 88 P.3d at 680. The issues 
were whether the terms of the offer were sufficiently specific and whether 
the family court erred by deciding the HFCR Rule 68 request by comparing all
the issues raised in the wife’s offer to the outcome of those issues as reflected in the family court’s judgment instead of engaging in an issue- by­
issue comparison. Id. at 308—10, 88 P.3d at 680— 82.     
The husband’s offer in 
Brutsch v. Brutch also involved child 
custody, and the family court denied the husband’s request for attorney’sfees after comparing his offer to the entirety of the divorce decree.

resolved by the divorce decree when engaging in the comparative analysisrequired by HFCR Rule 68.

in the original offer but settled pretrial; the ICA answered in the
affirmative. Id. at 118

issue.” Nakasone v. Nakasone , 102 Hawaiʻ i 108, 117 n.5, 73 P.3d 
62, 71 (App. 2002)  rev’d on other grounds , 102 Hawaiʻ i 177, 73 
P.3d 715 (2003). However, HFCR Rule 68’s threat of penalizing a 
party-offeree, by requiring payment of the party-offeror’s 
attorney’s fees, could “deter a party whose genuine concern for 
the best interests of the child is motivating him or her to 
contest the award of child custody and/or visitation from 
continuing to contest the award of child custody and/or visitation.” 
Id. It is contrary to societal interests that 
HFCR Rule 68 should penalize and, thus, dissuade a party from continuing with litigation to contest an offer of settlement 
involving custody or visitation, when a party genuinely believes 
that the offer is not in the best interests of the child. See 
id
. (“[T]he possibility that a party is contesting the award of 
child custody and/or visitation for reasons other than the best interests of the child is insufficient to justify imposition of 
an HFCR Rule 68 type bright line rule that would deter a party 
whose genuine concern for the best interests of the child is 
motivating him or her to contest the award of child custody 
and/or visitation from continuing to contest the award of child 
custody and/or visitation.”). 
In sum, the breadth, scope, and application of HFCR 
Rule 68 may, in certain cases, improperly coerce parties to

settle rights and issues whose resolution should not be driven 
by the threat of monetary penalties. This attribute of HFCR Rule 68, exacerbated in its deleterious effect by its 
application to family court proceedings governed by HRS § 580­
47, provides another reason for our holding that HRS § 580-47 
controls the determination of whether to award attorney’s fees 
and costs in all cases subject to HRS § 580-47.

C. 
The dissent asserts that the issue of appellate fees 
and the applicability of HFCR Rule 68 to cases governed by HRS § 580-47 are distinct issues and that we are therefore engaging in 
plain error review. Because we resolve a properly preserved 
issue by answering, at the threshold, a dispositive question of 
law, the plain error doctrine has no application. In Waldecker 
v. O’Scanlon, one of the issues raised was whether the 
19 The dissent maintains that our decision to limit the application
of HFCR Rule 68 so as not to include cases covered by HRS § 580- 47 “bypasses 
this court’s usual process for amendments to the HFCR.” Dissent at 10. The 
dissent seems to be advocating that this court should be precluded from
directly determining the validity of court rules and instead defer to the
rules committee to address any errors in the rules. However, this court is
authorized to invalidate, or modify the scope of, rules without going through
the “usual process” that the dissent describes, as this court has done in
numerous occasions.  See, e.g., In re Doe Children,  94 Hawaiʻ i 485, 487, 17
P.3d 217, 219 (2001) (rendering “HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) . . . inapplicable to
family court cases governed by HRS § 571– 54” without going through the 
amendment process); In Interest of Doe, 77 Hawaiʻ i 109, 113- 14, 883 P.2d 30, 
34-35 (1994) (voiding HFCR 59(g)(1) without undergoing the amendment 
process); Bank of Haw. v. Shinn, 120 Hawaiʻ i 1, 8, 200 P.3d 370, 377 (2008)
(limiting the scope of HRCP Rule 5(a) without regard to the amendment
process).

petitioner’s relocation was a material change in circumstances 
that would warrant a reexamination of the best interests of the child. No. SCWC-14-0000780, 2016 WL 3364695, at *7 (Haw. June 
17, 2016). The dispositive argument that this court chose to 
resolve, even though neither party asserted it, was the 
continued application of the material change of circumstances 
standard as a prerequisite to modifying a custody order. Id.
 at 
*8—*12. The Waldecker  court did not utilize the plain error 
doctrine. In Akamine & Sons, Ltd. v. Hawaii National Bank,
 the 
issue of attorney’s fees was raised, but the parties failed to 
advance a dispositive legal argument contained in the provisions 
of the promissory notes and mortgage involved in that case. 54 
Haw. 107, 114—15, 503 P.2d 424, 429 (1972). The court resolved 
the issue by answering the dispositive legal argument, and plain 
error was not invoked. Id. 
at 114—20, 503 P.2d at 429—31. 
Thus, in cases similar to  Waldecker
 and Akamine,
 where this 
court resolves a properly preserved issue by answering a 
threshold or dispositive question of law, even though the argument is not advanced by the parties, the plain error 
doctrine simply has no application. 
Here, the overarching issue is whether Husband should 
have been awarded appellate attorney’s fees under HFCR Rule 68, 
an issue that Husband raised and properly preserved. A 
foundational and dispositive question of law that the parties
31  
 
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
did not advance is whether HFCR Rule 68 applies to family court 
cases governed by HRS § 580-47. In resolving this dispositive legal question in this case, plain error review is not 
triggered. 
Id.; Waldecker, 2016 WL 3364695, at *8—12. To not 
address this threshold question regarding the application of HFCR Rule 68 to cases governed by HRS § 580-47 because neither 
party advances this argument would mean employing a legal 
principle that is not applicable in this case to resolve the 
issue on appeal, a course of action that this court has repeatedly rejected. See, e.g., Hawaiian Ass’n of Seventh-Day 
Adventists v. Wong, 130 Hawaiʻ i 36, 46, 305 P.3d 452, 462 (2013) 
(holding that “the parties’ stipulation as to a question of law is not binding on the court, and does not relieve us from the obligation to review questions of law de novo”); Chung Mi Ahn v. 
Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 126 Hawaiʻ i 1, 10, 265 P.3d 470, 479 
(2011) (disregarding the parties’ agreement that the statute 
involved had retrospective effect and instead holding that the 
statute was not retroactive); State v. Schnabel, 127 Hawaiʻ i 432, 
445, 279 P.3d 1237, 1250 (2012) (judicially noticing on appeal 
an unraised statute because “[i]t is axiomatic that a court must 
‘know’ the law within its jurisdiction; hence a court is 
required to ‘notice’ applicable law and to instruct the jury 
thereon” (quoting State v. West

sponte overturning prior appellate decisions that required a 
showing of a material change of circumstances as a prerequisite 
to modifying a custody order because that standard deviated from 
HRS § 571-46(a)(6)). 
III.
 CONCLUSION 
Our process in crafting court rules is not infallible, 
and this infallibility generated occasions where this court, in the context of litigation, had to invalidate or limit the scope of rules that it promulgated based upon their dissonance with 
statutes enacted by the legislature. 
See, e.g. , In re Doe 
Children, 94 Hawaiʻ i 485, 487, 17 P.3d 217, 219 (2001); In 
Interest of Doe
, 77 Hawaiʻ i 109, 113-14, 883 P.2d 30, 34-35 
(1994); Bank of Haw. v. Shinn,  120 Hawaiʻ i 1, 8, 200 P.3d 370, 
377 (2008). These cases illustrate this court’s obligation not to knowingly ignore errors in the rules that it promulgated, 
especially when those errors, brought to light by litigation, 
produce unintended consequences detrimental to the substantive 
rights of litigants subject to the rules. As Justice Frankfurter once said, “Wisdom too often never comes, and so one 
ought not to reject it merely because it comes late.”

v. Union Planters Bank, 335 U.S. 595, 600 (1949) (Frankfurter, 
J., dissenting) (quoted with approval by

Retail Clerks Union, Local 770,  398 U.S. 235, 255 (1970) 
(Stewart, J., concurring)). 
The dissent’s preferred alternative 
is to allow HFCR Rule 68 to continue to be applied in cases 
governed by HRS § 580-47 even if the rule contains a presumption 
of entitlement to fees and costs that is plainly absent from the 
statute. Employing this approach will jeopardize the fairness, 
integrity, and public reputation of family court proceedings in 
this jurisdiction and penalize Wife and similarly situated 
parties. See Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461 (1997). We 
therefore elect not to follow this course. 
We hold that both the 2006 and 2015 versions of HFCR 
Rule 68 do not apply to family court cases governed by HRS § 
580-47 because they are contrary to the provisions of HRS § 580­
47 and abridge substantive rights of litigants; because HFCR 
Rule 68’s breadth, magnitude, and application is inconsistent 
with the concepts of fairness and equity inherent in family 
court proceedings subject to HRS § 580-47; because HFCR Rule 68 
requires a comparative analysis of nontangible, nonmonetary aspects of family court judgments, a process unsuited to the 
host of issues that the family court is routinely called upon to 
resolve; and because the rule’s penalty has a potential to 
coerce settlement of rights and issues whose resolution should 
not be driven primarily by financial motivations. 
Hence, the 
provisions of HRS § 580-47 must govern in all instances where a

party to a family court proceeding seeks an award for attorney’s 
fees and costs subject to this statute.20 
Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal to 
the extent it vacated the portion of the August 6, 2012 family court order denying appellate fees and costs. The ICA’s 
Judgment on Appeal is also vacated as to the ICA’s March 12, 
2015 order that denied Husband’s HRAP Rule 39 motion for 
appellate costs “without prejudice to an award by the Family 
Court” and the April 9, 2015 order that awarded appellate costs to Husband pursuant to HRAP Rule 39(d). The case is remanded to 
the family court for consideration, as appropriate, of appellate 
fees and costs under HRS § 580-47.

20 Because we are proscribing the application of HFCR Rule 68 to
family court cases governed by HRS § 580- 47, our decision announces a new 
rule. See Schwartz v. State
, 136 Hawaiʻ i 258, 272— 73, 361 P.3d 1161, 1175— 76 
(2015) (“The prototypical manner in which this court creates a new rule is
when it . . . announces a superseding principle of law.”).  “As such, thisdecision applies only to this case and to all cases pending on direct appeal
or not yet final at the time that this decision is rendered. By final, we
mean those cases in which the judgment . . . has been rendered and the
availability of appeal and certiorari has elapsed.”
