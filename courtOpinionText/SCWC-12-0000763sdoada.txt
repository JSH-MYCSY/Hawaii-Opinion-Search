review of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) July 9, 2015

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment 
entered on July 31, 2012.1 The district court found Franco 
guilty of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an 
Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2012).2 We accepted Franco ’s 
Application for Writ of Certiorari, and we now vacate the ICA’s 
Judgment on Appeal and the district court ’s Judgment and remand 
the case to the district court for further proceedings. 
After being arrested for OVUII, Franco was read an 
implied consent form.3 Franco elected to take a breath test, 
1 The Honorable Blaine J. Kobayashi presided over Franco’s motion 
to suppress evidence and the Honorable Kelsey T. Kawano presided over 
Franco’s trial. 
2 HRS § 291E -61(a)(3) provides in relevant part: 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates 
or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
. . . 
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two 
hundred ten liters of breath. . . . 
3 The form, titled “Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an 
Intoxicant Implied Consent ,” stated in relevant part: 
1.___ Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public 
way, street, road or highway or on or in the waters of the 
State shall be deemed to have given consent to a test or 
tests for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration 
or drug content of the person ’s breath, blood, or urine as 
applicable. 
2. ___ You are not entitled to an attorney before you 
submit to any test or tests to determine your alcohol and/or drug content. 
3. ___ You may refuse to submit to a breath or blood test, 
or both for the purpose of determining alcohol

which resulted in a breath alcohol content reading of 0.081 
grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.  Franco filed a 
motion to suppress the breath test result on the basis that his 
Fourth Amendment rights (among other constitutional rights) were 
violated. The district court denied the motion.  The ICA 
affirmed the district court’s denial of Franco’s motion to 
suppress, relying on its opinion in State v. Won , 134 Hawai ʻi 59, 
332 P.3d 661 (App. 2014). On certiorari, Franco contends that 
(1) his breath test result was obtained in violation of his 
constitutional and statutory rights to counsel; (2) the district 
court’s admission of certain foundational exhibits violated Franco’s confrontation rights; (3) the ICA erred in holding 
Franco waived his right to be present at trial; and (4) Franco’s 
breath test result 
was insufficient to sustain an OVUII 
conviction.  Franco noted in his Application that this court had 
accepted certiorari in State v. Won , SCWC-12-0000858.  
In State v. Won , No. SCWC-12-0000858, 2015 WL 
10384497, at *16 (Haw. Nov. 25, 2015), we held that “coercion 
engendered by the Implied Consent Form runs afoul of the constitutional mandate that waiver of a constitutional right may 
concentration and/or blood or urine test, or both for the 
purpose of determining drug content, none shall be given, 
except as provided in section 291E -21.  However, if you 
refuse to submit to a breath, blood or urine test, you 
shall be subject to up to thirty days imprisonment and/or a 
fine of up to $1,000 or the sanction of 291E- 65, if 
applicable. In addition, you shall also be subject to the 
procedures and sanctions under Chapter 291E, part III.

only be the result of a free and unconstrained choice,” and, 
thus, a defendant’s decision to submit to testing after being 
read the implied consent form “is invalid as a waiver of his 
right not to be searched.” In accordance with Won, the result 
of Franco’s breath test was the product of a warrantless search, and the ICA erred in concluding that the district court properly 
denied Franco’s motion to suppress the breath test result . 
Accordingly, Franco ’s OVUII conviction cannot be upheld. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s July 9, 2015 
Judgment on Appeal and the district court ’s 
Judgment are 
vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this court’s opinion in 
Won.
