OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J.  
 
In this case we consider the issue 
first addressed in 
Nordic PCL Constr., Inc. v. LPIHGC, LLC , 136 Hawaiʻ i 29, 358 P.3d  
 
     
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
   
   
 

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HA WAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
1 (2015), of whether under the Hawai ʻi Uniform Arbitration Act 
(HUAA) (codified at Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) chapter 658A), 
a decision of a neutral arbitrator must be vacated due to 
evident partiality.  
The case arises from the arbitration of a construction 
contract dispute between homeowners Ramon Romero and Cassie 
Romero (the Romeros) and contractor Noel Madamba Contracting LLC 
(Madamba). The main question before us is whether arbitrator 
Patrick K.S.L. Yim’s (Yim) failure to disclose his possible 
attorney-client relationship with the Romeros’ counsel’s law 
firm constituted evident partiality requiring vacatur of the 
arbitration award by the circuit court. 
Following Yim’s issuance of a partial final 
arbitration award, the parties learned that Cades Schutte LLP 
(Cades)—the law firm representing the Romeros throughout the 
arbitration—had been retained by the administrator of Yim’s 
personal retirement accounts to ensure that the accounts 
complied with state and federal laws. Based on this previously 
undisclosed information, Madamba moved to vacate the arbitration 
award. The Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court) 
denied Madamba’s motion to vacate, determining that Yim’s 
failure to disclose did not constitute evident partiality. The 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed. 
2
  
 
    We hold that Yim’s failure to disclose his 
relationship with Cades created a reasonable impression of 
partiality, and as such, resulted in a violation of the 
disclosure requirements enumerated  in HRS § 658A -12.  As we 
recently held in Nordic, for neutral arbitrators, a violation of 
the disclosure statutes results in evident partiality as a  
matter of law.   136 Hawaiʻ i at  50,  358 P.3d at 22.   Thus, the 
circuit court’s determination that there was no showing of 
evident partiality was clearly erroneous.   We also clarify 
Nordic  and hold that pursuant to the plain language of HRS 
§ 658A-23(a)(2)(A), where there is evident partiality on the  
part of a neutral arbitrator, the award shall be vacated. 
Accordingly, we vacate the  ICA and the circuit court’s judgment s  
and remand to the circuit court with instructions to  vacate the 
arbitration award.         
  
  
  On June 1, 2009, the Romeros and Madamba entered into 
a contract in which the Romeros agreed to pay $425,000 for 
Madamba to complete a new construction for a two-story home in 
Honolulu, Hawai i. Over a year later, in November 2010, Keith Y. 
Yamada (Yamada) , an attorney   from the law firm Cades, sent a

demand letter to Madamba and A&B Green Building LLC (A&B)1 
notifying them that Cades had been retained by the Romeros and 
that legal action would be taken against them for breach of 
contract as the project had been abandoned. 
On February 28, 2011, the Romeros filed a demand for 
arbitration against Madamba and A&B alleging seven separate 
counts, including breach of contract.2 The demand was submitted 
to Dispute Prevention & Resolution, Inc. (DPR).  The Romeros 
continued to be represented by Yamada of Cades along with Andrew 
L. Salenger, also of Cades. The parties provided ranked lists 
of proposed third-party neutrals to DPR and based on the lists 
received, Yim was appointed as arbitrator on May 31, 2011.  On 
June 1, 2011, Yim provided his disclosures through DPR Case 
Manager Kelly Bryant (Bryant).  The disclosures noted, inter 
alia, that while Yim was a judge,3 “counsel and members of their 
firms appeared before [him]” and that “[s]ince retirement, [he 
1 A&B was hired by the Romeros to provide design services in 
relation to the project. A&B did not participate in the arbitration at 
issue. 
2 Both the agreement between the Romeros and Madamaba and the 
agreement between the Romeros and A&B provided for arbitration for disputes . 
The agreement with Madamaba noted that disputes should first be submitted to the architect in charge of the project prior to submitting them to 
arbitration. In their demand for arbitration, the Romeros stated that the 
agreement provided “that disputes may f irst be submitted to [the architect] 
for decision before being referred to arbitration,” but noted that “in light 
of the number and pervasiveness of the disputes herein ,” referring the matter 
to the architect would not “assist in reaching a resolution.” 
3 Yim is a former judge of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit .

had] served as a [n]eutral for counsel and members of their 
firms.” Yim made no disclosures regarding his relationship with 
Cades in connection with his personal retirement accounts. 
The arbitration hearings took place on November 2-4, 
2011. On January 26, 2012, Yim issued his Partial Final Award 
of Arbitrator (Partial Final Award).  Yim concluded that Madamba 
breached the construction contract and that the Romeros were 
entitled to recover $154,476.51 in compensatory damages.  Yim 
retained jurisdiction to address attorneys’ fees and costs. 
In February and March 2012, following the issuance of 
the Partial Final Award, Yim made three supplemental disclosures 
to the parties regarding his relationship with Cades in 
connection with his personal retirement accounts.  All three 
supplemental disclosures were transmitted to party counsel by 
Bryant via email. 
Bryant sent the first supplemental disclosure to party 
counsel on February 22, 2012, almost a month after Yim issued his Partial Final Award.  The disclosure informed the parties 
that Cades had been recently retained by the administrator of 
Yim’s personal retirement accounts to handle compliance 
documentation related to his accounts.  The disclosure stated 
that Yim hired Pension Services Corporation (PSC) in the 1990s 
to manage his personal retirement accounts and PSC’s role 
5
  
 
    
  
 
  On February 24, 2012, Madamba objected to Yim serving 
as arbitrator based on the supplemental disclosure, and 
requested more information regarding Yim’s rel ationship with 
Cades. The Romeros also responded to the disclosure. 
Specifically, the Romeros’ counsel, Yamada, stated that he 
confirmed with the firm’s pension benefits counsel, Ellen 
Kawashima (Kawashima)  , that Cades had done “ no  work for PSC on 
Judge Yim’s account and will not do so if at all until the  
 

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HA WAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
included ensuring that Yim’s accounts were “comp liant with all 
state and federal laws.” PSC hired Cades to assist in the legal 
review of Yim’s accounts  and  according to the disclosure,  Yim’s 
role in Cades’s  retention was limited  :   
Recently, PSC retained two law firms in Honolulu to handle 
their clients’ compliance documentation. Judge Yim’s 
account was in the group given to Cades Schutte.  
Please note that Judge Yim is PSC’s c lient, Judge Yim did 
not select or retain Cades Schutte personally, and he had 
no input as to who PSC selected. The Judge was advised 
that his accounts were  given to Cades after the fact.  
Judge Yim will sign documents drafted by Cades, and Cades 
will invoice Judge Yim directly for any compliance work 
done on his account.  
Bryant’s email also noted that Yim “[did] not feel this 
disclosure will in any way affect his ability to serve in a 
neutral and unbiased manner, but felt it was best to disclose 
this newly discovered information. ” DPR requested that any 
comments regarding the disclosure be filed in writing by February 24, 2012.

completion of the Romero arbitration.” Yamada further noted 
that “[t]here is no existing relationship that is in place and  
no engagement letter signed.” Yamada also stated  that he  
personally had no knowledge of the “proposed relationship” prior 
to Yim’s disclosure and stated that “[a ]ll rulings prior to 
th February 24  must remain undisturbed because no one (neither 
Judge Yim nor Cades Schutte) could have foreseen during the 
Madamba arbitration that th is relationship might develop.”  
On February 29, 2012, Bryant provided a second 
supplemental 
disclosure regarding Yim’s relationship with Cades. 
Bryant stated that Yim first spoke with Kawashima “a day or a 
couple days before this most recent disclosure was sent out”4 and 
that “[h]e instructed [Kawashima] to run a conflict check 
through her firm.” Bryant also stated that Cades had not 
provided Yim with any services nor had Yim signed an engagement 
letter with Cades or paid any fees to Cades.  Finally, the 
disclosure noted that Yim had instructed PSC to withdraw his file from Cades and send the work to another law firm. DPR 
requested any comments before March 2, 2012. In response, 
Madamba’s counsel requested additional information and 
clarification regarding the disclosures. 
4 In the third supplemental disclosure it was clarified that “this 
most recent disclosure” referred to the February 22, 2012 first supplemental 
disclosure.

  The disclosure further noted that Cades’s involvement  
became more definite several months later when Kiwada informed 
Yim that his accounts would likely be reviewed by Cades: “On 

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HA WAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
The third and final supplemental disclosure, emailed 
to party counsel on March 5, 2012, provided additional details 
about Yim’s relationship with Cades. The disclosure stated that 
“Yim advised DPR that Nobuo Kiwada [(Kiwada)] handles his account at [PSC]” and that Kiwada could provide an “accurate 
timeline” of the relevant events. According to the disclosure, 
Kiwada first raised the possibility of Cades’ s review of Yim’s 
retirement account
s with Yim in May 2011—the month Yim was 
confirmed by the parties as a neutral arbitrator —and Yim 
deferred to Kiwada as to which firm would be involved: 
In May 2011, Mr. Kiwada advised Judge Yim  that certain 
amendments would need to be done to all pension documents 
to comply with all new state and federal laws.  Mr. Kiwada 
was considering various attorneys of which Roger Fonseca 
[of Cades] was one. Judge Yim advised Mr. Kiwada that he 
would defe r to Mr. Kiwada’s judgment as to who to send his 
file to, and Judge Yim was not involved in PSC’s decision as to which law firms would be selected.   
According to the disclosure, “[n] othing further was done on this 
issue until December 30, 2011 when PSC sent a letter to all 
their clients advising them that their files would be sent to a law firm (no law firm was named in the letter) to handle 
[certain statutory] requirements. ”

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HA WAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
January 30, 2011, [5] Mr. Kiwada advised Judge Yim that his file 
would be sent to a law firm, probably Cades. ” At this point, 
Yim again 
“advised Mr. Kiwada that he would leave it up to Mr. 
Kiwada to determine which law firm would receive his file.” 
Regarding Yim’s contact with Cades in relation to his r etirement 
accounts, the disclosure stated: “Judge Yim first spoke with 
Ellen Kawashima at the Cades firm one or two days days [sic] 
prior to his  February 22, 2012  disclosure.  Until his 
conversation with Ellen, he did not know his file was with 
Cades.” Finally, the disclosure stated that Bryant confirmed 
with Kiwada that Yim’s file had “been reassigned to another law 
firm.” 
Madamba responded to the third disclosure, requesting 
additional information related to the communications between Yim 
and Kiwada that occurred in May 2011. 
Madamba also argued that 
the Partial Final Award should be vacated due to Yim’s violations of the disclosure rules. Despite Madamba’s 
objections and its request for additional discovery, DPR 
affirmed Yim’s role as arbitrator and informed the parties that 
6Yim would issue a final arbitration award. 
5 Kiwada later testified that the meeting at issue took place on 
January 20, 2012 and not in 2011.  
6 Madamba’s counsel notified DPR that Madamba had filed a Motion to 
Vacate the Partial Final Award along with a Motion to Stay Arbitration 
(continued . . .)  
9
  
 
    On April 25, 2012, Yim issued the Final Award of 
Arbitration (Final Award), which incorporated the Partial Final  
Award and awarded the Romeros  approximately $42,000 in  
attorneys’ fees, based on work performed by Cades.

B. Circuit Court Proceedings 
Following Yim’s supplemental disclosures, Madamba 
filed pleadings in the circuit court to disqualify Yim, stay the 
arbitration proceeding, and vacate the Partial Final Award. 
However, 
prior to the circuit court’s hearing on Madamba’s 
motion to vacate the Partial Final Award, Yim issued the Final Award. 
Accordingly
, after Yim issued the Final Award, Madamba 
filed a Motion to Vacate Final Award, arguing, inter alia,  that 
Yim failed to disclose his relationship with Cades and that “there was evident partiality of the [a]rbitrator.” In support, 
Madamba cited several provisions of 
HRS chapter 658A7 as well as 
DPR Rule 9, which required that arbitrators disclose “any past, present, or possible future relationship with the parties, their 
Proceedings and Disqualify Yim in 
the circuit court and that the arbitration 
should be stayed pending the resolution of the motions. DPR responded that 
since there was no court order to stay arbitration and no mutual agreement 
between the parties, Yim would proceed to issue a final award.  
7 Pursuant to HRS § 658A -3(c) (Supp. 2001), “[a]fter June 30, 2004, 
[chapter 658A] governs an agreement to arbitrate whenever made.”

witnesses, their counsel or another arbitrator including any 
bias or any financial or personal interest in the result of the 
arbitration.” The Romeros filed a Motion to Confirm Final 
Award. 
Madamba also requested additional discovery related to 
Yim’s relationship with Cades. Specifically, Madamba subpoenaed 
and, as a result, received records from DPR.8 Madamba also 
deposed three PSC employees: Kiwada, the president of PSC; 
Julie Kiwada (Julie ), Kiwada’s daughter who was being trained as 
a consultant at PSC; and Bruce Lee (Lee), a pension consultant.  Madamba also deposed Kawashima, the Cades pension benefits 
attorney who had been mentioned in the disclosures.
9 
Kiwada’s deposition testimon y confirmed that Kiwada 
met with Yim in May 2011 —more than seven months before Yim 
issued the January 26, 2012 Partial Final Award —and advised Yim 
that PSC would be negotiating with Cades and the law firm 
Carlsmith Ball LLP (Carlsmith) to potentially handle compliance 
work related to his retirement accounts. Kiwada also testified 
8 Madamba filed a motion to compel production of the DPR files, and 
DPR objected on the grounds that HRS § 658A -14(d) “preclude[d] the production 
of documents by DPR or any arbitration association unless you can show 
basically a prima facie ground to vacate the award.” The circuit court 
disagreed with DPR, stating that a prima facie showing had been made and ordered DPR to produce certain records from the arbitration. 
9 Kawashima’s deposition transcript was not included in the record 
on appeal and, thus, was not considered by this court. 
11
  
 
   
 
 
   
  
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
     

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HA WAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
that he informed Yim he would eventually recommend one of the 
two firms to represent him. The DPR documents revealed that the 
next month, in June 2011, PSC sent an email to Kawashima at 
Cades providing the names of several clients, including Yim, so 
that Cades could research potential conflicts of interest. 
Kawashima responded to PSC, stating that that there was no 
conflict between Cades and Yim. 
Approximately six months later, in December 2011, PSC 
sent a letter to Yim stating that it “had made arrangements with two [Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)] law firms 
in Honolulu” to complete wor k related to his pension plan. 
Specifically, the law firms would be ensuring that Yim’s plans complied with the requirements of the Economic Growth & Tax 
Relief Reconciliation Act prior to submission to the Internal 
Revenue Service.  The letter noted that the fee charged by the 
law firm would be “approximately $2,500.” 
Both Kiwada and Julie also testified that they met 
with Yim in January 2012 regarding his retirement plan.  Kiwada and Julie stated that this meeting occurred on January 20, 2012.  
The meeting date was corroborated by handwritten notes taken by 
Julie. Their testimony that the meeting date was January 20th — 
six days before Yim issued the Partial Final Award—did not match 
the date in Yim’s third supplemental disclosure, which stated 
12
  
 
      
 
 
   
 
   
 
 
 
  

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HA WAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
that Yim and Kiwada met on January 30th. Yim’s disclosure stated 
that, “Kiwada advised Judge Yim that his file would be sent to a 
law firm, probably Cades.” However, Kiwada did not remember 
whether he had specifically mentioned Cades during the meeting, and Julie testified that she thought “[they] did talk about it” 
but could not “ recall the details.” 
Four days following the meeting, on January 24, 2012 — 
and two days before issuance of the January 26, 2012 Partial 
Final Award—Julie emailed documents related to Yim’s retirement 
plan to Kawashima at Cades.  The transmittal email noted: “We 
spoke to the client and he knows the fee and that your 
engagement letter should be coming soon.” 
Following transmission of the files to Cades, it 
appears that Yim, PSC, and Kawashima discussed the issue of a potential conflict between Cades and Yim. A February 15, 2012 
internal PSC email from Kiwada to Julie, Lee, and others states: 
“Pat Yim will resolve his situation directly with Cades. Ellen 
[Kawashima] will get back to us in a couple of days if Cades can 
still represent Pat Yim.” On February 21, 2012, Yim sent an 
email to Bryant at DPR explaining the situation with PSC and Cades and stating that Kiwada “made the decision to refer [his] 
compliance work with a group of his clients to the Cades firm.” 
Yim stated that he would be billed directly by Cades for the

“work performed” but that other than providing signatures as 
necessary he did “ not expect[] to interact with the firm.” The 
first supplemental disclosure was sent to the parties the 
following day. Thus, when Yim sent this supplemental disclosure 
on February 22, 2012, he was aware Cades would be acting as his 
personal attorney. 
On June 12, 2012, Madamba filed a motion to continue 
the hearing on the Motion to Vacate Final Award and Motion to Confirm Final Award which had been set for June 19, 2012. 
Madamba stated that it needed additional time to conduct 
discovery on the disclosure issue, including taking the 
depositions of Yim and Bryant.
10 The circuit court granted 
Madamba a continuance to introduce evidence in support of its 
Motion to Vacate Final Award. 
On June 18, 2012, Madamba noticed Yim’s deposition as 
well as the depositions of Bryant and DPR’s Chief Ex ecutive 
Officer, Keith Hunter (Hunter). DPR’s counsel filed a motion 
for a protective order, stating that Yim and the DPR employees 
were immune from testifying pursuant to HRS § 658A-14(d)(2).11 
10 In the motion, Madamba also argued that it had the right to a 
jury trial on the disclosure issue. The circuit court denied Madamba’s 
request for a jury trial but discussed Madamba’s right to an evidentiary 
hearing. The court determined, however, that because Madamba had failed to 
make a prima facie showing of evident partiality, an evidentiary hearing was 
not warranted. This issue was not raised on certiorari.  
11 HRS § 658A- 14(d)(2) (Supp. 2001) provides: 
(continued . . .)

  Madamba then filed a memorandum in support of its  
motion to vacate, arguing, inter alia , that Yim breached his 
duty to disclose under the DPR rules and HRS § 658A-12(a), which 
requires an arbitrator to disclose “any known fact s that a

The motion for protective order was set for hearing on August 1, 
2012, the same date the circuit court had scheduled to hear the 
Romeros’ Motion to Confirm and Madamba’s Motion to Vacate. 
Madamba filed an ex parte motion to shorten time on the motion for protective order, claiming there were numerous disputed 
issues of facts which required further discovery from Bryant, 
Hunter, and Yim. The motion to shorten time was denied by the 
circuit court on July 2, 2012.

 The circuit court  heard  the Motion to Vacate Final 
Award, Motion to Confirm Final Award, and DPR’s motion for a 
12 protective order on August 1, 2012.   After hearing from the 
parties, the circuit court orally denied Madamba’s Motion to 
Vacate and granted the Romeros ’  Motion to Confirm Final Award, 
explaining its reasoning on the record.  The  court determined 
that the relationship between Yim  and Cades was a “possible 
future relationship” and thus  DPR Rule 9 had been viola  ted. 
However, the court indicated that there was no violation of HRS 
§ 658A-12 citing to the language in HRS § 658A-12(a)(2), which specifically refers to disclosures of  “existing or past 
relationship[s] .” In this respect, the court stated:

reasonable person would consider likely to affect the 
impartiality of the arbitrator in the arbitration proceeding.” 
On this basis, Madamba maintained that Yim’s failure to disclose 
resulted in evident partiality and that accordingly, the arbitration award should be vacated. The Romeros filed a 
response to Madamba’s motion , arguing that Madamba failed to 
meets its burden in demonstrating evident partiality. 
What we have here, we have a particular situation which, 
under the DPR, Rule 9 speaks to a possible future relationship and a disclosure.  There is no dispute that 
under 658 A-12, it speaks to existing or past relationship.  
Now, both parties had agreed to be bound by the DPR rules regarding whatever rules DPR sets forth which includes 
disclosure of a possible -- possible -- future

relationship.  What we have here is the existence of a 
possible future relationship. 
The court next considered whether there was evident 
partiality pursuant to HRS § 658A-23.  First, the court 
reiterated that the relationship between Cades and Yim “was a 
potential” or “possible” future relationship that was never “formulated,” whereas relevant caselaw finding evident 
partiality for a failure to disclose considered “prior” or 
“current” relationships. T he court additionally addressed 
Madamba’s claim t hat “particular instances” in the record 
demonstrated evident partiality. In this regard, the court 
determined Madamba failed to demonstrate evident partiality.  
Accordingly, the court denied Madamba’s motion to vacate and 
granted the Romeros’ motion to c onfirm. 
The circuit court additionally determined that DPR’s 
motion for protective order was moot, given its confirmation of 
the Final Award. 
C. ICA Appeal 
Madamba raised several issues before the ICA.  Of 
relevance on certiorari, Madamba argued that the circuit court’s 
finding that Yim failed to disclose his relationship with Cades 
in violation of DRP Rule 9 —in and of itself —required the 
circuit court to vacate the award.  Further, Madamba contended 
that Yim violated his duty to disclose under HRS § 658A-12(a), 
17
  
 
    In response, the Romeros argued that the circuit court 
properly denied Madamba’s motion to  vacate because Madamba 
failed to demonstrate evident partiality. In this regard, the 
Romeros claimed  that a nondisclosure does not  alone constitute 
evident partiality  and that the potential relationship between 
Cades and Yim, which was never consummated, did not create the 
impression of bias warranting vacatur. Regarding the 
depositions of Bryant, Hunter, and Yim, the Romeros argued that 
the reason the depositions were never taken was that Madamba 
delayed in scheduling them.   The Romeros further contended that 
there were no additional facts to be gained through these 
depositions.

which he claimed encompasses  a requirement to disclose potential 
future relationships that “a reasonable person would consider likely to affect the impartiality of the arbitrator in the 
arbitration proceeding.” (Quoting HRS § 658A -12(a)).   Madamba 
additionally argued that the circuit court erred in refusing to  
allow additional discovery, including the depositions of Bryant, 
Hunter, and Yim.   
In its Summary Disposition Order, the ICA rejected 
Madamba’s argument that 
Yim’s failure to disclose required the 
circuit court to vacate the arbitration award.  Noel Madamba

at *3 (App. May 23, 2014) (SDO). The ICA concluded that 
although Yim violated the DPR rules because he failed to 
disclose a possible future relationship with C ades, he was “not 
necessarily in violation of HRS § 658A-12(a)(2),” which only applies to disclosure of “past or present relationships.” 
Id. 
Turning to the question of whether the failure to disclose resulted in evident partiality, the ICA determined that it did 
not because the relationship between Yim and Cades “remained 
inchoate during the pendency of arbitration”; “was anticipated 
to be minimal at best”; and “lacked the significance, actuality, 
and contemporaneous nature” discussed in the relevant case law. 
Id. at *3-4. 
The ICA also found no error in the circuit court’s 
decision to rule on Madamba’s motion to v acate prior to the 
depositions of Yim and the other DPR personnel. 
Id. at *4. In 
this regard, the ICA held that a prima facie case for vacating the award did not exist, and thus, the depositions were barred pursuant to HRS § 658A-14(d)(2), which provides immunity for 
arbitrators and representatives of arbitration organizations.

B. Motion to Vacate Based on Evident Partiality 
As stated in Nordic,

court concluded that based on the facts surrounding Yim’s 
failure to disclose, there was no demonstration of evident partiality. Because this conclusion presents a mixed question 
of law and fact, we review it under the clearly erroneous 
standard. See, e.g., Panado v. Bd. of Trs., Emps. ’ Ret. Sys. ,

III. Discussion 
A. Evident Partiality and Failure 
To Disclose 
1)  The Circuit Court Clearly Erred in Determining  
that Yim’s Failure To Disclose Did Not Result in 
Evident Partiality  
21
  
 
    In Nordic , we laid out the legal frame work relevant to 
an arbitrator’s failure to disclose under HRS chapter 658A.     
Specifically, as acknowledged in Nordic, 136 Hawaiʻ i at 44-45,  
358 P.3d at 16-17, pursuant to the disclosure requirements 
enumerated in HRS §   658A-12, prior to accepting appointment and  
“after making a reasonable inquiry,” arbitrators are required to 
“disclose to all parties . . . any known facts that a reasonable 
person would consider likely to affect the impartiality of the arbitrator[.]” HRS § 658A-12(a).  Arbitrators also have a 
“continuing obligation to disclose . . . any facts . . .  
learn[ed] after accepting app  ointment which a reasonable person 
would consider likely to affect the impartiality of the 
13  arbitrator.” HRS §  658A-12(b).  If an arbitrator discloses 
                         
     In full, HRS § 658A -12(a)-(b) (Supp. 2001) states: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HA WAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
13 
(a) Before accepting appointment, an individual 
who is requested to serve as an arbitrator, after making a reasonable inquiry, shall 
disclose to all parties to the agreement to 
arbitrate and arbitration proceeding and to any 
other arbitrators any known facts that a 
reasonable person would consider likely to 
affect the impartiality of the arbitrator in 
the arbitration proceeding, including:  
(1) 
A financial or personal interest in the 
outcome of the arbitration proceeding; and 
(2) An existing or past relationship with any 
of the parties to the agreement to arbitrate or 
the arbitration proceeding, their counsel or 
representatives, a witness, or another arbitrator. 
(b) 
An arbitrator has a continuing obligation

facts that a reasonable person would consider likely to affect 
the impartiality of the arbitrator in the arbitration proceeding 
pursuant to HRS § 658A-12(a) or (b) “and a party timely objects 
to the appointment or continued service of the arbitrator based 
upon the fact disclosed, the objection may be a ground under 
section 658A-23(a)(2) for vacating” the awa rd. HRS § 658A-12(c) 
(Supp. 2001). Similarly, if an arbitrator does not disclose a 
fact required to be disclosed under HRS § 658A-12(a) or (b), 
“upon timely objection by a party, the court under section 658A -
23(a)(2) may vacate an award.” HRS § 658A -12(d) (Supp. 2001). 
In turn, HRS § 658A-23(a)(2) provides that the court “shall 
vacate an award made in the arbitration proceeding” upon a 
motion by a party 
to the proceeding if,  inter alia, there was 
“[e]vident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral 
14arbitrator.” 
( . . . continued) 
to disclose to all parties to the agreement to 
arbitrate and arbitration proceeding and to any 
other arbitrators any facts that the arbitrator learns after accepting appointment which a 
reasonable person would consider likely to 
affect the impartiality of the arbitrator.

    Our court first established an evident partiality  
standard for cases involving an arbitrator’s failure to disclose 
in Daiichi Hawai i Real Estate Corp. v. Lichter  , where we 
acknowledged that  “[w]hat constitutes ‘evident partiality’ 
sufficient to vacate an arbitration award is a difficult 
question.” 103 Hawai i at 339  , 82 P.3d at 42  5 (quoting  Valrose 
Maui, Inc. v. Maclyn Morris, Inc. , 105 F. Supp. 2d 1118, 1124 
(D. Haw. 2000)).   In Daiichi, we considered the circuit court’s 
granting of a motion to vacate an arbitration award pursuant to 
HRS § 658-9(2), which has since been repealed. Id.  at 327-28, 
82 P.3d at 413-14.  Under HRS § 658-9(2) (1993), a court could vacate an arbitration award “u pon the application of any party 
to the arbitration . . . [w]here there was evident partiality 
.  . . in the arbitrators.” We held that  evident partiality is 
“present when undisclosed facts show ‘a reasonable impression of 
partiality.’” Daiichi, 103 Hawai  ʻi at 339, 82 P.3d   at 425

There was:

(emphasis added) (quoting  Schmitz  v. Zilveti , 20 F.3d 1043, 1046 
(9th Cir. 1994)). Under this analysis, a finding of evident 
partiality related to a failure to disclose is not dependent on 
a showing that the arbitrator was actually biased, but instead 
stems from the nondisclosure itself. Id.  
at 352, 82 P.3d at 438 
(citing Schmitz, 20 F.3d at 1045

United States Supreme Court had “emphasized the manifest 
importance of a neutral arbitrator disclosing ‘to the parties 
any dealings that might create an impression of possible bias,’” 
id.
 at 341, 82 P.3d at 427 (quoting Commonwealth Coatings Corp. 
v. Cont’l Cas.  Co

acknowledged that “not all dealings rise to the level of 
creating the impression —or reality —of possible bias so as to 
warrant” vacatur, id. Finally, we stated that “[t]he burden of 
proving facts which would establish a 
reasonable impression of 
partiality rests squarely on the party challenging the award.” 
Id. at 339, 82 P.3d at 425 (citation omitted) (internal

As noted supra, we recently reiterated in Nordic, that 
evident partiality is established where “undisclosed facts 
demonstrate a reasonable impression of partiality.” 136 Hawai ʻi

the first time, explained the relationship between the standards 
for disclosure established in HRS § 658A-12 and a finding of 
evident partiality.  In this respect, we determined that in the 
context of neutral arbitrators, “a failure to meet disclosure 
requirements under HRS § 658A-12(a) or (b) is equivalent to, or constitutes, ‘evident partiality’ as a matter of law.” 
Id. at 
50, 358 P.3d at 22. Thus, in Nordic
, we interpreted the 
standard required for disclosure under § 658A-12(a) and (b), i.e, “facts a reasonable person would find likely to affect an 
arbitrator’s impartiality,” as equivalent to the Daiichi
 evident 
partiality standard previously adopted by our court, i.e., undisclosed facts demonstrating a 
reasonable impression of 
15 
15 Our standard for evident partiality as well as that of the Ninth 
Circuit (and some other federal and state courts), requires only a 
“reasonable impression of partiality,” and as such, is more expansive than 
the standard proposed by a majority of federal circuit courts of appeal, 
which limit findings of evident partiality to situations “where a reasonable 
person would have to conclude that an arbitrator was partial to one party to 
the arbitration.” Andersons, Inc. v. Horton Farms, Inc.,  166 F.3d 308, 325 
(6th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted); see 
also Freeman v. Pittsburgh Glass Work s, LLC,
 709 F.3d 240, 253 (3d Cir. 2013)

to conclude that she was partial to one side.”);  Ometto v. ASA Bioenergy 
Holding A.G., 12 CIV 1328 (JSR), 2013 WL 174259, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 
2013) (“The requirement that this Court must perceive partiality so clearly 
that it ‘would have  to conclude’ the arbitrator was biased before vacating 
the awards differs from the standard elaborated by the Ninth Circuit, which looks only for ‘an imp
ression of possible bias.’”) , aff’d , 549 F. App’x 41

26
  
 
    Under this framework, w e now consider whether Yim’s 
failure to disclose his relationship with Cades resulted in a 
violation of HRS §  658A-12(a) or (b), or stated otherwise, 
whether the failure to disclose resulted in evident partiality, defined in our jurisdiction as a reasonable impression of 
partiality. In considering this question, we recognize that 
judicial review of arbitration awards is limited. 
Daiichi,  103 
Hawaiʻi at 339 , 82 P.3d at 422.  However, because review of an 
arbitration award is limited, an arbitrator’s impartiality and 
appearance of impartiality is paramount. As a corollary, the

( . . . continued) 
Indeed, in 
the federal courts, there is an “absence of a 
consensus on the meaning of ‘evident partiality.’” Montez v. Prudential 
Sec., Inc., 260 F.3d 980, 983 (8th Cir. 2001).  The confusion stems from the 
United States Supreme Court’s decision in Commonwealth Coatings.  In 
Commonwealth Coatings, Justice Black, writing for at least four justices of 
the Court, held that an arbitrator’s failure to “disclose to the parties any 
dealings that might create an impression of possible bias” was sufficient to 
support vacatur. 393 U.S. at 147-49 .  Accordingly, the court vacated an 
award where a neutral arbitrator of a three -arbitrator panel failed to 
disclose his ongoing business relationship with one of the parties. Id. at 
146-47.  
Justice White joined the majority opinion but concurred 
separately, adopting a narrower view of the 
standard.  Justice White noted 
that arbitrators should not be held to the same standards as judges, id. at 150 (White, J., concurring), but found that “for present purposes” it was 
sufficient to “hold . . . that where the arbitrator has a substantial 
interest in a firm which has done more than trivial business with a party, 
that fact must be disclosed,” id. at 151 -52 (White, J., concurring).  Justice 
White’s concurrence has opened the door for many of the federal circuit 
courts of appeal —and some state courts —to adopt a more stringent definition 
of evident partiality, requiring a s howing beyond “an impression of possible 
bias.” Our court’s approach follows Justice Black’s reasoning.

disclosure process is of utmost import. The Daiichi court  
recognized as much, quoting the United States Supreme Court  for 
the proposition that “we should, if anything, be even more 
scrupulous to safeguard the impartiality of arbitrators than 
judges, since the former have completely free rein to decide the 
law as well as the facts and are not subject to appellate 
review.” Id.  at 341, 82 P.3d at 427 (quoting Commonwealth 
Coatings, 393 U.S. at 149); see also  Kay v. Kaiser Found. Health 
Plan, Inc., 119 Hawaiʻ i 219, 229,  194 P.3d 1181, 1191 (App. 2008)  
(acknowledging that the “judiciary should play a minimal rule in reviewing impartiality” but noting that “the sine qua non for 
minimal review must be the arbitrator’s fidelity to the disclosure obligation”). Based on these principles, we hold 
that Yim’s  failure to disclose his relationship with Cades 
created a reas onable impression of partiality, and accordingly, 
the circuit court’s findings that there was no violation of Yim’s duty to disclose under HRS chapter 658A and no showing of 
16  evident partiality are clearly erroneous.    
16 In Nordic , we remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing 
because “the circuit court did not explain the basis of its rulings on the 
record or enter findings of fact or conclusions of law” and material facts 
were in dispute. 136 Hawaiʻ i at 31, 358 P.3d at 3 .  Here, however, the 
material facts were undisputed and the circuit court explained its reasoning 
for determining there was no evident partiality, as discussed supra
 and 
infra. Accordingly , we are able to review the circuit court’s findings.

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HA WAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
The key facts in this case establish that Yim was in 
discussions concerning his representation by Cades during the 
arbitration proceedings.  In summary, in May 2011, Yim met with 
the administrator of his retirement plan, who informed him that 
either Cades or Carlsmith would eventually handle compliance 
work related to his personal retirement accounts.  Yim was 
appointed as arbitrator in the underlying contract dispute the 
same month, and in June 2011 made a disclosure to the parties 
regarding his relationship with both law firms, but did not 
disclose that Cades might be representing him in connection with 
his personal retirement accounts.  Approximately six months 
later, in December 2011, Yim received a letter from his 
retirement plan administrator, explaining that arrangements had 
been made with two local ERISA law firms to review documents 
related to his retirement accounts, for a fee of “approximately 
$2,500.” 
In January 2012, after the arbitration hearing, but 
while the arbitration was pending, PSC, the administrator of Yim’s retirement account s, met with Yim and informed him that 
his files would probably be sent over to Cades. Also at this time, PSC transmitted Yim’s files to Cades . A few days after 
the files were transmitted, Yim issued his Partial Final Award on January 26, 2012.  Yim made no disclosure regarding his 
29
  
 
    Based on these facts, the circuit court determined 
that Yim’s failure to disclose his relationship with Cades 
resulted in a violation of DPR Rule 9 insofar as the rule 
requires the disclosure of certain possible future 
relationships.   Despite having found a violation of the DPR 
rule, and based, in part, on its description of the relationship between Yim and Cades as yet-to-be “formulated,” “potential,” 
“possible,” and “future,” the circuit court determined there was 
17 no evident partiality.   In reaching t his conclusion, the court 
stated,  “[t]here is no dispute that under 658A -12[(a)(2)], it 
speaks to existing or  past relationship[s] ”  as opposed to 
potential and future relationships.  
                         
   
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HA WAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
involvement with Cades until almost a month after issuing the 
Partial Final Award, when Yim learned that his file had been 
sent to Cades.   It was only when Madamba raised concerns 
regarding Cades’ s  representation of Yim, that Yim’s account was 
assigned to another law firm. Yim continued to serve as the 
arbitrator and issued the Final Award over Madamba’s objections .  
17 As discussed supra, the circuit court also appeared to consider 
evidence in the record of Yim’s actions during the arbitration that Madamba 
claimed demonstrated Yim was partial to the Romeros.  Such a consideration 
might be appropriate to the extent Madamba raised an actual bias claim. However, we note that for claims of evident partiality based on a failure to 
disclose “an arbitrator’s nondisclosure of facts showing a potential conflict 
of interest creates evident partiality warranting vacatur even when no actual 
bias is present.” Daiichi, 103 Hawai i at 352, 82 P.3d at 438 (quoting 
Schimitz, 20 F.3d at 1045) (internal quotation marks omitted).  
30  
 
    The ICA similarly determined that Yim violated the DPR  
rules, but stat ed that he did “not necessarily [violate] HRS 
§ 658A-12(a)(2), as the latter expressly limits disclosure  
obligations to past or present relationships.”   Madamaba, SDO, 
2014 WL 2180001, at *3.  The ICA   affirmed the circuit court on 
the basis that  Yim’s  failure to disclose did not amount to 
evident partiality because 1) his relationship with Cades was 
prospective in nature, and 2) the anticipated relationship would 
have been minimal and indirect.   Id. at *3-4.      
  
 

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HA WAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
At the outset, we address the circuit co
urt and the 
ICA’s conclusion in relation to the disclosure requirements in 
HRS § 658A-12. In this respect, both the circuit court and the ICA specifically referred to HRS § 658A-12(a)(2), which provides 
an example of information that must be disclosed under HRS 
§ 658A-12(a), namely, “[a]n existing or past relationship with 
any of the parties . . . , their counsel or representatives, a 
witness, or another arbitrator.” However, notwithstanding whether the nondisclosure at issue here falls under the 
definition of HRS § 658A-12(a)(2), the nondisclosure may still 
result in a violation of the more general disclosure requirement 
in both HRS § 658A-12(a) and (b) of facts that “a reasonable 
31
  
 
    
   
  
  
  
  
   
 
                         
   
 
  
   
 
  
 

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HA WAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
person would consider likely to affect the impartiality of the 
18arbitrator.” 
Thus, even if the relationship at issue is a 
prospective or future relationship, a failure to disclose may 
result in a reasonable impression of partiality, and 
accordingly, a violation of HRS § 658A-12(a) or (b).  Here, the 
fact that the relationship between Cades was —to a certain 
extent—prospective in nature is not determinative, particularly 
given the broad view of the reasonable impression of partiality 
standard employed in the relevant case law. For example, in 
Valrose, the United States District Court for the District of 
Hawaii vacated  an arbitration award in a construction dispute 
where the arbitrator and one of the party’s counsel had an ex 
parte discussion regarding the possibility of the arbitrator 
serving as the mediat
or in an unrelated malpractice case.  105

was pending, but the arbitrator failed to disclose the 
discussion. Id. The only evidence in the record of work on the 
malpractice case that occurred during the pendency of the 
construction arbitration, however, was one conversation between 
the arbitrator and the attorneys in the malpractice case.  Id.  
at 1123. The court acknowledged that there was no evidence that party counsel acted with “improper motive” or was attempting to 
bias the arbitrator , but nonetheless concluded that “the 
nondisclosure of the discussion and appointm
ent . . . was 
clearly a serious failing” resulting in a reasonable impression 
of partiality and requiring vacatur.  Id. at 1123-24.  
Similarly, in   New Regency Prods., Inc. v. Nippon 
Herald Films, Inc., the Ninth Circuit affirmed a decision to 
vacate an arbitration award based on the undisclosed fact that 
the arbitrator was a senior executive of a film company that was 
in negotiations with an executive of one of the parties to co-
produce a movie.  501 F.3d 1101, 1103 (9th Cir. 2007). The arbitrator started his employment with Yari Film Group in mid-
July 2004, during the pendency of the arbitration, and in late 
July 2004 it was reported that Yari Film Group was in 
negotiations to finance a film that would be produced by a 
production executive at New Regency, one of the parties to the 
arbitration. Id. at 1107. Rather than focusing on the finality

of the deal between Yari Film Group and New Regency, the court 
emphasized the fact that the negotiations  occurred during the 
arbitration. 
the arbitrator had actual knowledge of the negotiations, the 
court held that his failure to disclose demonstrated a 
“reasonable impression of partiality . . . sufficient to support 
vacatur.” Id.  at 1111. Recently, in In re Sussex, based in 
part on New Regency ’s  holding, the Ninth Circuit stated that 
evident partiality could be demonstrated not only in cases where there was a “direct financial connection[] between a part y and 
an arbitrator or its law firm” but also when there is a “concrete possibility of such connections .” In re Sussex, 781 
F.3d 1065, 1074 
(9th Cir. 2015) (emphasis added) (citing

cert. denied sub nom.  Turnberry/MGM Grand Towers, LLC, v. 
Sussex
, 136 S. Ct. 156 (2015).    
The facts in the instant case are analogous to Valrose 
and New Regency , and comport with the Ninth Circuit’s 
explanation that a failure to disclose a “concrete possibility” 
of a connection between an arbitrator and a party or party law 
firm can result in a reasonable impression of partiality.  In re 
Sussex
, 781 F.3d at 1074.  Although it appears that Cades did 
not begin to formally represent Yim during the arbitration, it 
34
  
 
    
 
 
  
 
   

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HA WAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
is clear that PSC, serving as Yim’s agent, had discussions 
during the pendency of t he proceedings related to Cades’s  
potential representation of Yim. Indeed, Cades completed a 
conflict check for Yim in June 2011 after Yim’s appointmen t as 
arbitrator. Cades actually received Yim’s files prior to the issuance of the Partial Final Award, indicating that the 
attorney-client  relationship was —at the least —close to being 
consummated.   Additionally, Yim still planned on being 
represented by Cades in February 2012, prior to the release of  
his Final Award. In an email he sent to DPR the day prior to 
the first supplemental disclosure, Yim indicated that he would 
be billed directly by Cades for its work but would have minimal  
direct interaction with the firm.   Relatedly, per Yim’s first 
supplemental disclosure,  Yim anticipated “sign [ing] documents  
drafted by Cades” and receiving invoices directly from Cades for 
“compliance work done on his account.”  
In sum, the timing of the undisclosed relationship 
lends to our conclusion that the circuit court clearly erred in 
determining that Yim’s failure to disclose did not result in 
evident partiality, because the communications between PSC — 
acting on Yim’s beha lf—and Cades occurred during the pendency of 
the arbitration, or otherwise stated, were not “distant in time, 
but rather ongoing during the arbitration.” New Regency, 501

  Other courts have found  a failure to disclose 
resulting in a reasonable impression of partiality based on more  

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HA WAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
F.3d at 1110. The operative facts demonstrate that —at the 
least—there was a concrete possibility that an attorney-client 
relationship would develop between the arbitrator and the law 
firm of party counsel. 
We are further persuaded that the circuit court’ s 
conclusion regarding evident partiality was erroneous, given the 
substantive nature of the undisclosed relationship. In this 
respect, we also disagree with the ICA’s conclusion that Yim’s 
failure to disclose did not result in a reasonable impression of 
partiality based on the indirectness and insignificance of his 
relationship with Cades. The ICA noted that Yim did not plan on 
having direct interaction with Cades other than paying legal 
bills, and on this basis described the relationship as “arms -
length.” Madamba, SDO, 2014 WL 2180001, at *4 (internal 
quotation marks omitted). However, the fact that PSC would have acted as an intermediary between Yim and Cades is not 
determinative. Indeed, had Cades ultimately completed the work 
on Yim’s retirement account s, Cades would have been acting as 
Yim’s personal attorney, resulting not only in a business and 
financial relationship, but also an attorney-client 
relationship, which carries with it heightened import.

distant relationships than the one at issue here. In  New 
Regency
, as discussed supra
, the undisclosed relationship at 
issue was between a film company at which the arbitrator had 
been made a senior executive and an executive employed at New 
Regency. 501 F.3d at 1103. The arbitrator had no direct role 
in the negotiations between the two companies, and in fact, the 
record lacked evidence that the arbitrator was even aware of the 
potential relationship. Id. at 1107-08.  Moreover, the New 
Regency executive who communicated with the arbitrator’s film 
company did not appear to be “directly representing New Regency 
in the negotiations.”  at 1110-11.  Nonetheless, the court 
concluded the executive’s ties to New Regency were of sufficient 
import to distinguish the relationship as more than attenuated. 
Id. The court’s determination in this regard contributed to its 
holding that the district court properly vacated the arbitration 
award. Id.; see also   Olson v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & 
Smith, Inc. , 51 F.3d 157, 159 (8th Cir. 1995
) (holding that the 
arbitrator’s failure to disclose his company’s busines s dealings 
with one of the parties required vacatur although the arbitrator 
was not “personally involved” in the relationship); Schmitz
, 20

105 S.W.3d 28, 34 (Tex. App. 2003) (stating that the 
arbitrator’s “ongoing service as counsel” for a trade 
association of which parties were members “might create a 
reasonable impression of partiality toward” those parties). 
Similarly, in Nordic, we cited favorably to a 
Texas 
Supreme Court case in which the court —adopting the reasonable 
impression of partiality standard —found evident partiality, 
based on an arbitrator’s failure to disclose a more indirect 
relationship than the one at issue here. 136 Hawaiʻ i at 48-49, 
358 P.3d at 20-21. In the Texas case, each party to the 
arbitration at issue selected an arbitrator to serve as a party 
arbitrator, i.e., a non-neutral arbitrator.  Burlington N. R.R.  
Co. v. TUCO Inc. , 960 S.W.2d 629, 630 (Tex. 1997).  The two 
party arbitrators then selected the third arbitrator, meant to 
“act as the only neutral decision maker.” It was later 
revealed that during the arbitration, the neutral arbitrator accepted “a substantial referral from the law firm of [one of 
the] non-neutral co-arbitrator[s].” Id. The arbitrator failed 
to disclose his acceptance of the work during the arbitration. 
Id.  Despite arguments that the “relationship [was] too indirect 
because [the law firm at issue] was neither a party in the 
arbitration proceedings nor counsel for a party,” the court 
determined 
“that a reasonable person could conclude that the 
38
  
 
    
 
  
  
   
 
  
  
 
 
 
 

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HA WAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
referral might  affect [the neutral arbitrator’s] impartiality” 
and accordingly, “trigger[ed] the duty to disclose.” Id. at 
638, 639. The court further noted, that although neither the 
non-neutral arbitrator nor the attorney who made the referral 
was aware of the other ’s relationship with the neutral 
arbitrator, “[a] n objective observer could still reasonably 
believe that a person in [the neutral arbitrator’s] position, 
grateful for the referral, may have been inclined to favor [the 
law firm] as an entity,” and accordin gly, may have been partial 
toward the position of the co-arbitrator whose firm referred him. Id. at 637. 
Here, in contrast to 
Burlington,  the law firm with 
whom Yim had an undisclosed relationship —i.e., Cades—
was 
representing a party to the arbitration and accordingly, functioned as an agent to one of the parties to the arbitration. 
Cf. id.
 at 640 (Enoch, J., dissenting) (noting that the non-
neutral arbitrator “was chosen” by one of the parties but was “not their agent”). Further, the nature of the undisclosed 
relationship between Yim and Cades was more significant than the 
relationship between the arbitrator in
 Burlington  and the law 
firm of his co-arbitrator.  In Burlington, another attorney at 
the co-arbitrato r’s law firm had merely facilitated a meeting 
between the neutral arbitrator and the potential client. Id. at 
39
  
 
   
 
 
  
   
    
 
 
 

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HA WAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
631. Notably, although the referring attorney “attended the 
meeting and briefed the other participants” on certain issues 
regarding the litigati on, “he had no authority to determine 
whether [the neutral arbitrator] should be hired.” Id.   
Further, there was no indication in Burlington  that the law firm 
would be involved in the litigation, beyond the initial referral. In contrast, in the instant case, Yim failed to 
disclose a relationship that could have resulted in the Romeros’ 
counsel
’s law firm directly  representing Yim in his personal 
capacity. As previously noted, this would include signing documents that Cades prepared and paying Cades directly for its 
work. 
In sum, based on this record, we conclude that the 
circuit court clearly erred in its determination that Yim’s 
failure to disclose did not result in evident partiality.  We recognize that whether a failure to disclose creates a 
reasonable impression of partiality is a fact-driven question requiring a close analysis of the circumstances at issue. Here, 
the communications between PSC —acting as Yim’ s agent—and Cades 
were not distant in time, but instead were ongoing during the 
arbitration. In terms of substance, the anticipated 
relationship between Cades and Yim would have resulted in an 
attorney-client relationship with Cades representing Yim in his 
40
  
 
   
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HA WAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
personal capacity. Moreover, Yim’s relationship with Cades was 
more than merely a  prospective one, as Cades received the files 
related to Yim’s retirement accounts during the pendency of the 
arbitration.   It is also significant that Yim did not begin to  
disclose his relationship with Cades until after he issued the Partial Final Award.    
Yim
’s failure to disclose his potential relationship 
with Cades prior to accepting appointment resulted in a violation of HRS § 658A-12(a) and his failure to disclose “facts 
. . . [he] learn[ed] after accepting appointment ” resulted in a 
violation of HRS § 658A-12(b).  If Yim had disclosed there was a 
fifty percent chance Cades would be retained to review his 
retirement accounts prior to the arbitration, it would have been 
reasonable for a litigant in Madamba’s position to reject Yim as 
an arbitrator. See Kay, 119 Hawaiʻ i at 230, 194 P.3d at 1192 
(“It would have been perfectly reasonable and rational for a 
person in [the relevant party’s ] position to have rejected an 
arbitrator who had such connections —if disclosure had been 
made.”); see also Schmitz, 20 F.3d at 1047 (“ The parties can 
choose their arbitrators intelligently only when facts showing 
potential partiality are disclosed. ”). Moreover, throughout the 
arbitration proceedings, while Cades and PSC continued to work towards finalizing the attorney-client relationship between

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HA WAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Cades and Yim, Yim did not make any related disclosures.  Under 
these circumstances, we conclude that a reasonable impression of 
partiality was established. 
2) A Finding of Evident Partiality R
equires Vacatur 
As explained supra
, the undisclosed facts demonstrated 
a reasonable impression of partiality, and accordingly, resulted in a violation of the HUAA’s disclosure requirements. Because 
Yim was a neutral arbitrator, evident partiality was established 
as a matter of law. See Nordic , 136 Hawaiʻ i at 22, 358 P.3d at 
50. Thus, the arbitration award must be vacated pursuant to HRS 
§ 658A-23(a)(2)(A), which provides that the court “ shall vacate 
an award made in the arbitration proceeding” upon a motion b y a 
party to the proceeding if there was “[e]vident partiality by an 
arbitrator appointed as a neutral arbitrator[.]” (Emphasis 
added). 
As noted supra, HRS § 658A-12(c) and (d) provide that 
if an arbitrator fails to disclose a fact required under 
subsections (a) or (b) of the statute, or if the arbitrator does 
disclose such a fact but continues to serve as arbitrator — 
following timely objection —the award “may” be vacated under HRS 
§ 658A-23(a)(2). The function of the “may” language in the 
statutes is to provide reference to the different circumstances 
that require vacatur under HRS § 658A-23(a)(2), i.e., a neutral 
42
  
 
   
    
  In Nordic, because we remanded the case to the circuit 
court for an evidentiary hearing, 
we did not directly address 
the effect of a finding of evident partiality on a motion to 
vacate. However, we stated that the circuit court “has 
discretion under HRS § 658A-12(d) to decide whether or not to 
grant the motion to vacate.” Nordic, 136 Hawai  ʻi  at  53, 358 P.3d  
20  at 25.  We now clarify that   pursuant to the plain language of 
                         
    
  
 
  
    
 
    
 

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HA WAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
arbitrator’s evident partiality, and any arbitrator’s corruption 
or misconduct. Supra note 14.  For example, if a non-neutral 
arbitrator fails to make a disclosure required under  HRS § 658A  -
12(a) or (b), although the award would not be vacated based on 
evident partiality —as evident partiality only applies to neutral 
arbitrators—it could be vacated based on the corruption and 
19  misconduct provisions in HRS §  658A-23(a)(2).   
19 The HUAA is based on the Uniform Arbitration Act (UAA), drafted 
by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform Laws in 2000. The 
comment to section 12 of the UAA, which mirrors HRS § 658A -12 states as 
follows: “A party -appointed, non- neutral arbitrator’s failure to disclose 
would be covered under the corruption and misconduct provisions of Section 
23(a)(2) because in most cases it is presumed that a party arbitrator is 
intended to be partial to the side which appointed that person.” Unif. 
Arbitration Act § 12 cmt. 4 (2000), available at  
http://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/arbitration/arbitration_final_00.pdf . 
For a non- neutral arbitrator, the award would only be vacated if the 
arbitrator “fails to disclose information that amounts to ‘corruption’ or to ‘misconduct prejudicing the rights of a party.’” Id. cmt. 5.   
20 In Nordic , we noted that the commentary to UAA section 12 
provides that “[c]ourts also are given wider latitude in deciding whether to 
vacate an award under Section 12(c) and (d) that is permissive in nature (an 
award ‘may’ be vacated) rather than Section 23(a) whic h is mandatory (a court 
(continued . . .) 
43
  
 
   
    
    
  Because we find that based on the record before us 
Yim’s failure to disclose  requires vacating the arbitration 
award, we need not address the  circuit court ’s disposition of 
Madamba’s request for additional discovery. However, we note 
that the ICA’s determination that Madamba was not entitled to 
take Yim and DPR staff depositions based on DPR’s claim of 
immunity was incorrect.   See  Madamba, SDO, 2014  WL 2180001, at 
 *4.   Pursuant to  HRS § 658A-14(d)(2) , an arbitrator or a 
representative of an arbitration organization is immune from

HRS § 658A-23(a)(2), if a neutral arbitrator demonstrates 
evident partiality, the arbitration award shall be vacated.21 
B. Discovery Issues 
‘shall’ vacate an award).” 136 Hawai i at 53 , 358 P.3d at 2 5  (alteration in 
original) (footnote omitted) (quoting Unif. Arbitration Act § 12 cmt. 4).  
However, the comment also note s  that “[c]hallenges based upon a lack of 
impartiality, including disclosed or undisclosed facts, interests, or relationships are subject to the developing case law under Section 23(a)(2).” Unif. Arbitration Act § 12 cmt. 4.  Thus, the comment takes into account the 
fact that jurisdictions have developed  different views regarding what 
constitutes evident partiality. As discussed supra, our standard for evident 
partiality based on a failure to disclose is equivalent to the standard laid 
out in HRS § 658A  -12’s disclosure provisions 
.  Accordingly, in this context, 
once evident partiality is established, the arbitration award must be vacated.  ʻ
21 We note that in the instant case, there was no issue as to 
whether Madamba waived his right to challenge Yim’s role as arbitrator. A 
party’s right to challenge an arbitration award based on a failure to 
disclose and evident partiality may be waived under certain circumstances. 
See Nordic, 136 Hawai ʻi at 52-53, 358 P.3d at 24 -25; Daiichi, 103 Hawaiʻ i at 
346-47, 82 P.3d at 432- 33.

 For the foregoing reasons, we vacate  the ICA’s June  
20, 2014 judgments on appeal   in CAAP-12-0000778 and CAAP-12-

testifying unless the testimony is related “[t]o a hearing on a
