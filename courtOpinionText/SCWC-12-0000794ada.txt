 in violation of Hawai i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 712- 1240.8.1  
The Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) September 23, 2015 
Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its August 17, 2015 
Memorandum Opinion
, affirmed Subia’s conviction .  On appeal, 
Subia argues the ICA erred in  holding 1) the Circuit Court of 
the First Circuit (circuit  court) did not abuse its discretion 
by permitting Jeanette Ardiente (Ardiente), a criminalist with 
the Honolulu Police Department (HPD), to testify that the 
results of the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) 
conclusively established that the substances the police 
recovered from Subia contained methamphetamine ; and 2) Subia’s 
conviction was based on sufficient evidence.2  We conclude a 
proper foundation was not laid to introduce the FTIR test 
results and therefore, Ardiente should not have been permitted 
to testify regarding the FTIR test results.  Further, there is a 
reasonable possibility that the admission of the test results  
contributed to Subia’s conviction.  Because the circuit court’s 
error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we vacate the 
Judgment on Appeal of the ICA and the judgment of conviction of the 
                     
1  HRS § 712- 1240.8 (2014) provides in part, as it did at the time 
relevant here: 
(1) A person commits the offense of methamphetamine trafficking 
in the second degree if the person knowingly distributes 
methamphetamine in any amount.  
 
2  In arguing t his first point, Subia also asserts Ardiente’s 
testimony was inadmissible because her testimony violated the best evidence 
rule.  (Citing H awaiʻi Rules of Evidence (HRE ) Rule 1002) .  In light of our 
disposition, we do not address this argument.   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____

 circuit court, and remand to the circuit court for a new trial. 
I.  Background 
A. Circuit  Court Proceedings 
On October 5, 2011, Subia was charged with committing 
methamphetamine t rafficking in the s econd degree.  The “Felony 
Information” filed by the State charged Subia with violating HRS 
§ 712-1240.8: 
On or about the 4th day of October, 2011, in the City and 
County of Honolulu , State of Haw aii, ZALDY SUBIA did 
knowingly distribute the dangerous drug methamphetamine in 
any amount , thereby committing the offense of 
Methamphetamine Trafficking in the Second Degree in 
violation of Section 712 -1240.8 of the Hawaii Re vised 
Statutes. 
 
A jury trial3 commenced on June 13 , 2012.   
At trial, t he State presented testimony from HPD  
Officer Brett Doronila, who testified that on October 4, 2011, 
as part of an undercover operation, he approached Subia and 
sought to purchase methamphetamine.  Officer Doronila described 
his interaction with Subia as follows:  
Well, I approached him.  I asked him if “ You get,”  which 
is, through my training and appearance  [sic], is street 
vernacular to see if you have any illegal  drugs to sell.  
He said, “What you looking for?”  I said “ Clear.”  Which is 
street vernacular for crystal methamphetamine.  He said, 
“How much you looking for? ”  I said “Forty.”  Forty 
dollars.  He said, “Okay, wait here.”   
 
After this conversation, Subia left to collect the alleged 
drugs.  Subia returned with two clear Ziploc bags, which he 
handed to Officer Doronila, who then paid Subia.  Officer 
                     
3  The Honorable Colette Y. Garibaldi presided.  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
4 
 Doronila testified that each of the bags contained “a white 
crystalline- like substance” that he asserted resembled 
methamphetamine.   
Subia’s description of his encounter with Officer 
Doronila substantially corresponds with Officer Doronila’s 
testimony.  Subia explained that Officer Doronila asked Subia if 
he had drugs, and Subia replied, “no, but I could get [] some 
drugs that somebody get[.]”  On cross examination, Subia agreed 
that he sold Officer Doronila drugs, and that he knew “clear 
means crystal meth.”  Subia also agreed that he “went to get the 
meth,” spoke with the drug dealer and told him “[s]omebody want 
to buy forty, forty dollar worth” of “[c]rystal meth.”  In 
response, the drug dealer “gave [Subia] the drugs,”  Subia 
returned to Officer Doronil a and “holding the meth, [] put it in 
[Officer Doronila’s] hands.”  To the State’s question asking 
whether Subia  had “[done] this before,” Subia replied, “Yeah, 
some.”   
  Ardiente, a criminalist with HPD who conducted tests 
to identify the substances at issue, was presented by the State 
as an expert in the field of drug analysis and identification.  
She testified that she is trained in the “use” of the FTIR.  
Defense counsel did not object to Ardiente as an expert and the 
court determined Ardiente was an expert in the field of drug 
analysis and identification.   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
5 
   Ardiente testified that she analyzed the substances to 
determine if the bags contained controlled substances.  To 
perform her analysis, Ardiente  conducted a color test, a crystal 
test, and the FTIR test.  The color and crystal tests are 
presumptive tests, meaning the tests indicate, but do not 
confirm, the presence of methamphetamine.  Ardiente testified 
that the color and crystal tests indicated methamphetamine was 
present in both bags.   
The FTIR test is a confirmatory test, meaning it 
identifies a particular substance, to the exclusion of all 
others, within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.  
Ardiente explained that the substances are placed on the FTIR, 
which shines a beam of infrared light on the substance.  The 
light causes the molecules of the substance to vibrate.   The 
FTIR reads the vibrations and creates a graph.  Ardiente ran the 
test and compared the graphs created by the substances with a 
known graph of methamphetamine run on the same instrument.  
Ardiente testified the graphs of the substances matched the 
known graph  of methamphetamine, indicating both substances 
tested positive for methamphetamine.   
  To lay a foundation to introduce the FTIR test 
results, Ardiente testified how the FTIR is checked  to ensure it 
is in proper working order.  Ardiente explained  the FTIR has an 
“inbuilt validation  program” provided by the manufacturer.  She ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
6 
 stated that to d o a performance check, you “run” the validation 
program and “it will print out a piece of paper saying whether 
or not the performance check passed.”  The performance check is 
run daily before the first use of an instrument that day.  
Ardiente explained tha t HPD’s procedure is to keep the printout 
of the performance check and require criminalists to examine and 
initial the printout for each instrument.  This establishes that 
the criminalist  “did check it and ensure that [the FTIR] was in 
proper working condi tion.”   
Ardiente testified that a performance check was 
conducted on the FTIR prior to her testing of the substances on 
October 4, 2011.  She  was not the first criminalist to use the 
instrument and therefore did not run the performance check.  
Defense counsel objected to Ardiente’s testimony  on the basis of 
hearsay, and the court initially sustained the objection.  After 
the State reframed its  question , defense counsel again objected 
based on hearsay.  The State explained the line of questioning 
was foundational.  T he court overruled the objection and 
permitted Ardiente to explain how she knew a check was performed 
on the instrument used.  Ardiente testified  she reviewed the 
printout of the performance check results for that instrument.   
Based on the October 4, 2011 printout, Ardiente asserted the 
FTIR was operating in accordance with the manufacturer’s 
specifications.  She also testified  she would not have used the ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
7 
 FTIR if it were  not in proper working condition.   
Defense counsel asked to voir dire the witness after 
the State asked Ardiente, “based on all three of the tests that 
you had run on the evidence that was submitted, what were the 
results of all the tests?”  On voir dire, defense counsel 
inquired whether the FTIR “should be checked and calibrated each 
time it is used.”  Ardiente responded that the FTIR “does have 
performance checks” but did not state whether the FTIR is 
calibrated.   
After conducting voir dire of Ardiente, defense 
counsel objected to admission of her testimony regarding the 
test results based on hearsay,  lack of foundation, and the 
Confrontation Clause.  Defense counsel explained that because 
she did not conduct the performance check , her testimony was 
hearsay.  Defense counsel argued that to lay a proper foundation 
to introduce the FTIR test results, the State was required to 
demonstrate the FTIR was accurate through the testimony of the 
analyst who conducted the test or by introducing  the printouts 
of the performance check.  The court overruled defense counsel’s 
objections because Ardiente testified she was trained by the 
FTIR manufacturer in quality cont rol and followed  the 
manufacturer’s procedure of reviewing the results of the 
performance check prior to using the machine.  In addition, the 
court based its ruling on Ardiente ’s testimony that she  found ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
8 
 the FTIR to be in proper working condition even though she did 
not conduct the performance check.  Thereafter,  Ardiente 
testified,  “[b]ased on the results of all the tests, I concluded 
that the substance[s] contained methamphetamine . . . .”  She 
also said  she had no reason to believe the FTIR was not working 
accurately.   
Subia raised the defense that he acted as a procuring 
agent for the buyer of methamphetamine, Officer Doronila.  The 
jury was instructed that “[a] person who is the procuring agent 
for the buyer cannot be found guilty of distributing the 
unlawful drug because the act of buying falls outside the 
definition of to distribute.”   Subia argued in closing that the 
evidence demonstrated that he acted on behalf of the buyer 
because he did not seek out a buyer and did not receive any 
compensation for assisting the transaction.  According to the 
State, the evidence demonstrated that Subia acted on behalf of 
the seller.  The State based its argument on the following 
evidence: 1) it would be unusual for a person not acting on 
behalf of a seller to “help” a stranger find  drugs; 2) Subia 
“went straight to”  the seller  after Officer Doronila asked Subia 
if he had drugs; and 3) the seller  trusted Subia.    
The circuit court instructed the jury that Subia was 
charged with the offense of methamphetamine trafficking in the 
second degree.  The court stated that “[a] person commits the ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
9 
 offense of methamphetamine trafficking in the second degree if 
he knowingly distributes methamphetamine in any amount.”  The 
court explained there are “two material elements” of the 
offense: “1, that on or about October 4th, 2011, in the City and 
County of Honolulu, State of Hawai ʻi, the defendant, Zaldy Subia, 
distributed methamphetamine in any amount.  And 2, that the 
defendant Zaldy Subia, did so knowingly.”  The court defined 
distribution to the jury as follows:  “[t]o distribute” means to 
“sell, transfer, prescribe, give, or deliver to another, or to 
lead, barter or exchange with another, or to offer or agree to 
do the same.”   
The jury convicted Subia of methamphetamine 
trafficking in the second degree.  Subia was sentenced on August 
22, 2012 to ten years in prison with a mandatory minimum of one 
year, and he was ordered to pay monetary assessments and fines.   
B. ICA Appeal 
  In a m emorandum o pinion, the ICA affirmed the circuit 
court’s judgment convicting Subia.  State v. Subia , No. CAAP- 12-
0000794, at 18 (Haw. Aug. 17, 2015) (mem.).  The ICA concluded 
Ardiente’s testimony was sufficient to lay a proper foundation 
to admit the results of the color, crystal, and FTIR tests.  Id.  
at 12-13.  The ICA emphasized that in State v. Manewa , 115 
Hawaii 343, 167 P.3d 336 (2007), this court did not cite to any 
testimony that the expert himself performed the daily check of ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
10 
 the instrument, “rather it was [the expert’s] knowledge that the 
laboratory followed a routine procedure to ensure that the 
[instrument] was in proper working order that was important.”  
Id. at 11.  According to the ICA, Manewa 
established “testimony 
showing compliance with established procedures that provide 
assurance that the instrument is in proper working order is 
sufficient to lay the foundation for admission of the results of 
the instrument’s use.”  Id. at 11.  Ardiente testified the 
laboratory had a policy of conducting a performance check in 
accordance with the manufacturer’s recommended procedure , and 
required criminalists to check the printout of the performance 
test results to ensure the instrument was in good working order.  
Id. at 9, 11.  T he ICA interpreted Manewa to conclude that a 
proper foundation was laid to admit the test results and 
Ardiente’s testimony.  Id. at 11- 12.   
II.  Standards of Review 
A. Evidentiary Foundation 
When a question arises regarding the necessary foundation 
for the introduction of evidence, the determination of 
whether proper foundation has been established lies within 
the discretion of the trial court, and its determination 
will not be overturned absent a showing of clear abuse.  
 
State v. Eid , 126 Hawai i 430, 440, 272 P.3d 1197, 1207 (2012) 
(quoting State v. Assaye , 121 Hawai i 204, 210, 216 P.3d 1227, 
1233 (2009)). 
B. Evidence Admissibility  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
11 
 [D]ifferent standards of review must be applied to trial 
court decisions regarding the admissibility of evidence, 
depending on the requirements of the particular rule of 
evidence at issue.  When application of a particular 
evidentiary rule can yield only one correct result, the 
proper standard for appellate review is the right/wrong 
standard.  However, the traditional abuse of discretion 
standard should be applied in the case of those rules of 
evidence that require a “judgment call ” on the part of the 
trial court. 
 
State v. Heggland, 118 Hawaiʻ i 425, 434, 193 P.3d 341, 350  
(2008) (citation omitted). 
III.  Discussion 
Subia asserts the State did not lay a sufficient 
factual foundation to admit the results of the FTIR test.  “[A] 
fundamental evidentiary rule is that before the result of a test 
made out of the court may be introduced into evidence, a 
foundation must be laid showing that the test result can be 
relied on as a substantive fact.”  State v. Wallace , 80 Hawai i 
382, 407, 910 P.2d 695, 720 (1996) (citation omitted).  A proper 
foundation for introducing a test result “would necessarily 
include expert testimony regarding: (1) the qualifications of 
the expert; (2) whether the expert employed ‘ valid techniques ’ 
to obtain the test result; and (3) whether ‘ the measuring 
instrument is in proper working order.’”  State v. Long , 98 
Hawaii 348, 355, 48 P.3d 595, 602 (2002).  It is undisputed that 
Ardiente was a qualified expert and used valid techniques in 
conducting her test of the substances.  As a result, the crux of 
Subia’s foundational issue is whether the FTIR was in proper ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
12 
 working order.   
  Ardiente testified that the FTIR was working properly 
based upon the performance check that was conducted by another 
criminalist.  She explained that every day an “inbuilt 
validation program ” is used to check whether the FTIR is 
operating in accordance with manufacturer specifications.   She 
stated that after you run the program, “it will print out a 
piece of paper saying whether or not the performance check 
passed.”  Because the printout stated the FTIR passed the 
performance check, Ardiente concluded the FTIR was in proper 
working condition.  The State did not introduce the printout 
into evidence.  Thus, a s Subia notes, “the only evidence that 
the FTIR was in proper working order was Ardiente’s testimony 
regarding the contents of the performance based printout.”  
  T his case is  factually similar to Manewa, 115 Hawaiʻ i 
343, 167 P.3d 336 .  In analyzing the admission of the test 
results of a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS) in 
Manewa, we focused on the expert’s testimony that the laboratory 
applied an accepted manufacturer’s procedur e to verify the 
instrument was in proper working order.  The expert in Manewa 
testified, “‘a routine check’ was done of the [instrument] ‘each 
and every morning’ ‘to ensure that all the parameters are within 
manufacturer specifications .’”  Id. at 354, 167 P.3d at 347.  
The expert explained that “if any parameter is out of spec,” the ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
13 
 instrument is not used.  Id.  We determined that the expert’s 
testimony that he would not have used the instrument if it had 
not been in proper working order indicated he had personal 
knowledge that the instrument was in proper working condition.  
Id. at 354, 167 P.3d at 347.   
  Likewise, in this case, Ardiente explained a daily 
check is conducted using a program provided by the manufacturer 
to determine whether the FTIR is in proper working order.  
Ardiente testified she would not have used the FTIR if it had 
not been working properly.  The ICA therefore determined that 
Ardiente’s testimony laid a sufficient foundation to introduce 
the FTIR test results.  Subia, mem. op. at 11.  The ICA 
explained that in Manewa “it was [the expert’s] knowledge that 
the laboratory followed a routine procedure to ensure that the 
[the instrument] was in proper working order that was 
important.”  Id.   Because Ardiente testified a pe rformance check 
was routinely conducted and she had knowledge that the 
performance check was conducted, the ICA concluded  that it was 
irrelevant that Ardiente did not personally perform the 
4performance check.   Id.   
  However, the distinction that the ICA did not consider 
is that Ardiente lacks personal knowledge that the performance 
                     
 4  The ICA did not consider whether the printout of the performance 
check could have been introduced into evidence.  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
14 
 check was accurate.  Although Manewa does not clearly state the 
expert ran the routine check, this court explicitly explained in 
Wallace that personal knowledge is an essential factor in laying 
a sound factual foundation.  In Wallace, the expert could not 
testify that the calibration was accurate if the expert lacked 
personal knowledge that the instrument “had been  correctly 
calibrated and merely assumed that the ma nufacturer’s service 
5representative had done so.”   Wallace , 80 Hawaiʻi at 412, 910 
P.2d at 725 (emphase s added).   In Wallace, the service 
representative did not testify at trial and no business record 
was introduced indicating the instrument was correctly 
calibrated.  Id.   We explained that “testimony based on 
information supplied by another person that is not in evidence 
is inadmissible.  The rationale is that the witness’ knowledge 
is based on hearsay evidence and the trier of fact is unable to 
test the source’s trustworthiness.”  Id. at 411, 910 P.2d at 724  
(citing State v. Bannister , 60 Haw. 658, 659- 60, 594 P.2d 133, 
134 (1979)).  We therefore concluded the expert’s testimony as 
to the accuracy of the balance was based on inadmissible 
hearsay.  Id.  Thus, we held the pro secution failed to lay an 
adequate factual foundation that the results of an electronic 
                     
5  We came to this conclusion even though the person conducting the 
check was the manufacturer’s service representative, who presumably would be 
the person most likely to properly follow the manufacturer’s procedure.  
Wallace, 80 Hawai i at 412, 910 P.2d at 725.   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
15 
 balance used to weigh cocaine were accurate.  Id. at 412, 910 
P.2d at 725.   
  Similarly, in Manewa, we also considered that the 
expert knew the electronic balance was calibrated semi-annually, 
but had no personal knowledge that the balance was “ correctly 
calibrated.”  115 Hawaiʻi at 355, 167 P.3d at 348 (emphasis 
added).  The individual calibrating the balance “fill [ed] out a 
form and indicate[d] that it was in proper working condition.”  
Id.  The forms were not admitted into evidence.  Id.  We found 
an “inadequate foundation was laid to show that the weight 
measured by the balance could ‘be re lied on as a substantive 
fact[.]’”  Id. at 356, 167 P.3d at 349 (citing Wallace, 80 
Hawaiʻi at 412, 910 P.2d at 725).  Therefore, we concluded the 
expert’s “assumption that the balance was accurate was based on 
inadmissible hearsay.”   Id.    
Likewise, as Subia argues, Ardiente’s testimony that 
the FTIR was in proper working condition is based on 
inadmissible hearsay.  Ardiente had knowledge of the procedures 
used to test the FTIR, but her testimony that the FTIR was in 
proper working order was not based on her personal knowledge 
because she did not conduct the performance check. Because the 
printout was not admitted into evidence and the criminalist who 
conducted the performance check did not testify at trial, it is 
unknown whether the performance check was conducted as required ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
16 
 by the manufacturer.  To assert the FTIR was in proper working 
condition, Ardiente had to assume the other criminalist 
correctly conducted the performance check.  As Subia notes, the 
printout may have been admissible as a regularly conducted 
activity pursuant to HRE Rule 803(b)(6).  However, because the 
State did not introduce the printout or the testimony of the 
criminalist who conducted the performance check, the State 
failed to establish the performance check had been conducted 
correctly.  Because there is no reliable evidence demonstrating 
the FTIR  was in proper working order, the State failed to lay a 
factual foundation that the FTIR was in proper working 
condition.   
Subia also argued there is no evidence that the FTIR 
was calibrated.  We recognize “ Manewa imposes the additional 
requirement that [the State] show ‘that the [instrument] had 
been properly calibrated by the manufacturer’s service 
representatives[.]’”  Assaye, 121 Hawai ʻi at 217, 216 P.3d at 
1240 (Acoba, J ., concurring) (citing Manewa, 115 Hawaiʻi at 354, 
167 P.3d at 347).  In Manewa, we determined the evidence failed 
to establish reliability of the analytic balance where the 
record lacked evidence of  the expert’s training in calibrating 
the balance and the prosecution failed to demonstrate “the 
balance had been properly calibrate[d] .”  Manewa, 115 Hawaiʻi at 
354, 167 P.3d at 347.   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
17 
 A sufficient foundation is not laid when the only 
evidence of the working status of an instrument is  that the 
instrument was “checked. ”  State v. Long , 98 Hawaiʻi 348, 355, 48 
P.3d 595, 602 (2002).  In Long, the prosecution asked its expert 
about the calibration of the machine.  Id.  In response, the 
expert failed to answer in the affirmative as to the 
calibration, and stated o nly that “all instruments are checked.”  
Id.  We therefore concluded the prosecution did not lay a 
foundation “confirming that ‘the test result [could] be relied 
on as a substantive fact. ’”  Id. (citing Wallace, 80 Hawai ʻi at 
407, 910 P.2d at 720).   
Here, the record is inconclusive as to whether 
calibration was conducted.  On voir dire, defense counsel asked 
Ardiente whether the FTIR “should be checked and calibrated each 
time it is used, right?”  In response, Ardiente did not 
explicitly state whether the FTIR was calibrated .  She stated 
only that “[i]t does have performance checks, yes.”  This 
response is ambiguous as to whether the performance check 
constituted a calibration of the FTIR.  Ardiente did not explain 
on direct examination or on voir dire how a performance check is 
conducted.  Ardiente stated only that the FTIR has “an inbuilt 
validation program” that is “run” and that will “print out a 
piece of paper saying whether or not the performance check 
passed.”  Based on the record, it is unclear whether the daily ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
18 
 performance check constituted calibration of the FTIR or whether 
it constituted a verification of the accuracy of the machine 
that would render calibration of the FTIR superfluous.  Assuming 
the FTIR requires calibration, the fact that the instrument ’s 
performance was, as a matter of routine, checked prior to use is 
insufficient when there is no evidence that the instrument was 
ever calibrated.  Simply stating that a daily performance check 
was conducted  does not necessarily mean the checks involved a 
calibration of the FTIR.  Without evidence that the FTIR 
received periodic calibration  or that such calibration was 
unnecessary, it is unknown whether the instrument or  the 
performance check program was working properly.   Accordingly, we 
hold the circuit court abused its discretion in admitting 
Ardiente’s testimony regard ing the test results. 
Under the harmless error standard, the appellate court 
“must ‘determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that 
the error complained of might have contributed to the 
conviction.’ ”  State v. Pauline , 100 Hawai i 356, 378, 60 P.3d 
306, 328 (2002) (citation omitted) .  “If there is such a 
reasonable possibility in a criminal case, then the error is not 
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and the judgment of 
conviction on which it may have been based must be set aside.”  
State v. Gano, 92 Hawai i 161, 176, 988 P.2d 1153,  1168 (1999) 
(citation omitted).   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____  
 
19 
 Ardiente’s testimony  regarding the FTIR test results  
was central to the State’s argument that Subia was guilty of 
distributing methamphetamine and had sold methamphetamine on 
behalf of the seller.  As noted, Subia’s defense theory was 
posited on the argument that he was the procuring agent for the 
buyer.  The strength of the State’s c ase would have been 
significantly lessened had the test results demonstrating that 
the substances were methamphetamine, to the exclusion of all 
other substances, not been admitted .  Without the test results 
proving that the substances were methamphetamine, the State had 
limited evidence to support its theory that Subia was an agent 
for the seller:  Subia received no monetary payment or payment-
in-kind in return for his alleged service to the seller; further 
Subia did not approach the buyer,  rather, the buyer approached 
Subia.  Without the test results, the State’s ability to counter 
Subia’s procuring agent defense would ha ve been substantially 
reduced and Subia may have been able to raise a reasonable doubt 
in the minds of the jury.  Accordingly, there  is a reasonable 
possibility that admission of the test results contributed to 
the jury’s conclusion that Subia intended to distribute 
methamphetamine in collaboration with the seller.  In other 
words, the fact that the j ury received evidence that the 
substance given to Officer Doronila was methamphetamine may have 
persuaded the jurors that Subia acted on behalf of the seller ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____

 and was not the procuring agent for Officer Doronila.  Thus,  
admission of the FTIR test results was not harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt.  
IV. Conclusion 
  Based on the foregoing, we vacate the judgment of the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals and  the judgment of conviction of 
the circuit court and  remand the case to the circuit court for a 
new trial.
