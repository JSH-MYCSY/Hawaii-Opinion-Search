judgment).1 The district court found Shimkus guilty of Operating 
a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in 
violation of Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(3) 
(Supp. 2010).2 This court accepted Shimkus’s Application for 
Writ of Certiorari, and we now vacate the ICA’s Judgment on 
Appeal and the district court judgment and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings. 
After being arrested for OVUII, Shimkus was taken to 
the police station, where he was read an implied consent form.

1 The Honorable Shirley M. Kawamura presided. 
2 HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2010) provides in relevant part: 
(a)	 A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under
the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
. . . 
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten
liters of breath. . . . 
3 The form read in relevant part: 
1. ___ 	 Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public way,
street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of the State
shall be deemed to have given consent to a test or tests forthe purpose of determining alcohol concentration or drugcontent of the persons [sic] breath, blood or urine as
applicable. 
2. ___ 	 You are not entitled to an attorney before you submit to
any tests [sic] or tests to determine your alcohol and/or drug

3. ___ 	 You may refuse to submit to a breath or blood test, or
both for the purpose of determining alcohol concentrationand/or blood or urine test, or both for the purpose ofdetermining drug content, none shall be given [sic], except asprovided in section 291E-21. However, if you refuse to submit

Shimkus elected to take a breath test, which resulted in a 
breath alcohol content reading of 0.178 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. In his motion to suppress the breath test results before the district court and on certiorari, Shimkus 
contends that (1) his Miranda rights under Article I, Section 10 
of the Hawai ʻi Constitution were violated when, while in custody, 
he was asked by the police, without Miranda warnings, if he 
wanted to refuse to take a blood alcohol test, which was likely 
to incriminate himself; (2) his statutory right to an attorney was violated; and (3) the wording of the implied consent form misinformed Shimkus of the sanctions.

In State v. Won, 136 Hawai ʻi 292, 312, 361 P.3d 1195, 
1215 (2015), we held that “coercion engendered by the Implied Consent Form runs afoul of the constitutional mandate that waiver of a constitutional right may only be the result of a free and unconstrained choice,” and, thus, a defendant’s 
(. . . continued) 
to a breath, blood, or urine test, you shall be subject to up
to thirty days imprisonment and/or fine up to $1,000 or the
sanctions of 291E-65, if applicable. In addition, you shall
also be subject to the procedures and sanctions under chapter291E, part III. 
4 Included in this third argument raised before the district court
and the ICA, Shimkus contended that the police officers’ warnings and
advisements based on the implied consent form were coercive and that he did
not knowingly and voluntarily submit to the breath alcohol testing. The district court denied his motion to suppress, and the ICA affirmed thedistrict court’s ruling.

 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
decision to submit to testing after being read the implied 
consent form “is invalid as a waiver of his right not to be searched.” In accordance with State v. Won, the result of Shimkus’s breath test was the product of a warrantless search, 
and the ICA erred by concluding that the district court properly 
denied Shimkus’s motion to suppress the breath test result. Accordingly, Shimkus’s OVUII conviction cannot be upheld. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s July 16, 2014 
Judgment on Appeal and the district court judgment are vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this court’s opinion in 
State v.
