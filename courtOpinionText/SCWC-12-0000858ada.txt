CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
(CAAP-12-0000858; CASE NO. 1DTA-11-01903) 

NOVEMBER 25, 2015 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J.
  
Under our law, a person has a statutory and 
constitutional right to refuse to consent to a bodily search 
unless an exception to the search warrant requirement is 
present. 
In this case, the defendant was informed by the police 
of his right to refuse to consent to a search, but he was also  
 
 
    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
told that if he exercised that right, his refusal to consent 
would be a crime for which he could be imprisoned for up to 
thirty days. 
Yong Shik Won was stopped by police while driving his 
vehicle on April 20, 2011. After his arrest for operating his 
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant, Won was given a 
choice. He could either submit to a test for the purpose of 
determining alcohol concentration, or if he did not submit, he 
would be arrested, prosecuted, and subject to thirty days of imprisonment for the crime of refusal to submit to a breath, 
blood, or urine test. After being given this choice, Won 
elected to undergo a breath test, the result of which provided 
the basis for Won’s conviction for the offense of operating a 
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant. 
We consider whether Won’s election to submit to the 
breath test was consensual under the circumstances presented. We hold that it was not. 
I. Introduction 
The prohibition against operating a vehicle under the 
influence of an intoxicant (OVUII) provides that all drivers are 
deemed to have given consent to submit to a test of their 
breath, blood, or urine, for the purpose of determining alcohol

concentration or drug content.1 Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 291E-11(a) (Supp. 2006). Before administering a test, the 
officer must inform the person that “the person may refuse to 
submit to testing.” Id. 
If a person arrested for OVUII refuses to submit to a 
test to determine blood alcohol concentration (BAC test), the law provides that “none shall be given,” HRS §§ 291E-15 (Supp. 
2010)
2 and 291E-65 (Supp. 2009),3 except in circumstances 
1 The relevant portions of the “Implied consent of operator of
vehicle to submit to testing to determine alcohol concentration and drug
content” section provides as follows: 
(a)	 Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public way,
street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of
the State shall be deemed to have given consent,
subject to this part, to a test or tests approved by
the director of health of the person’s breath, blood, or urine for the purpose of determining alcohol
concentration or drug content of the person’ s breath, 
blood, or urine, as applicable. 
(b)	 The test or tests shall be administered at the 
request of a law enforcement officer having probablecause to believe the person operating a vehicle . . . 
is under the influence of an intoxicant . . . only 
after: 
(1)	 A lawful arrest; and 
(2)	 The person has been informed by a law
enforcement officer that the person may refuse
to submit to testing under this chapter. 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes § 291E-11 (Supp. 2006). 
2 HRS § 291E-15 provides: 
If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a breath,blood, or urine test, none shall be given, except as
provided in section 291E

officer’s determination that the person under arrest has
refused to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, ifapplicable, then a law enforcement officer shall:

involving a “collision resulting in injury to or the death of 
any person.” HRS § 291E-21(a) (2007).4 
Hawaiʻi law provides two categories of penalties for 
drivers that refuse to submit to a BAC test.5 The first is an 
extended revocation period of the person’s driver’s license in an administrative process applicable to all persons arrested for 
OVUII. HRS § 291E-41(d) (Supp. 2010); see generally HRS Chapter 
(. . .continued)
(1) Inform the person under arrest of the sanctions under
section 291E- 41, 291E- 65, or 291E- 68; and 
(2) Ask the person if the person still refuses to submit to
a breath, blood, or urine test, thereby subjecting the
person to the procedures and sanctions under part III
or section 291E- 65, as applicable; 
provided that if the law enforcement officer fails tocomply with paragraphs (1) and (2), the person shall not be
subject to the refusal sanctions under part III or IV. 
(Emphasis added). 
3 HRS § 291E-65 provides, in relevant part: 
If a person under arrest for operating a vehicle after
consuming a measurable amount of alcohol, pursuant to
section 291E- 64, refuses to submit to a breath or blood 
test, none shall be given, except as provided in section 
291E
-21 . . . . 
(Emphasis added). 
4 HRS §  291E-21(a) provides:  
Nothing in this part shall be construed to prevent a lawenforcement officer from obtaining a sample of breath,
blood, or urine, from the operator of any vehicle involved
in a collision resulting in injury to or the death of any 
person, as evidence that the operator was under the
influence of an intoxicant. 
5   The two areas of sanctions provided for refusal to submit to a
BAC test are separate from the criminal prosecution prescribed for the OVUIIoffense.

291E, Part III. The administrative license revocation process 
is “civil in nature.” State v. Severino, 56 Haw. 378, 380, 537 
P.2d 1187, 1189 (1975). This court has upheld civil license revocation on several occasions. See, e.g., Dunaway v. Admin. 
Dir. of Courts 
, 108 Hawaiʻ i 78, 87, 117 P.3d 109, 118 (2005); 
Kernan v. Tanaka, 75 Haw. 1, 22, 856 P.2d 1207, 1218 (1993); 
Severino, 56 Haw. at 380-81, 537 P.2d at 1189. 
The civil 
revocation of driver’s licenses under HRS Chapter 291E, Part III, is not an issue in this case. 
In contrast, the second category of penalties for 
refusing to submit to a BAC test is a criminal sanction. “Except as provided in section 291E-65, refusal to submit to a 
breath, blood, or urine test as required by part II is a petty 
misdemeanor.”
6 HRS § 291E-68 (Supp. 2010). A petty misdemeanor 
is punishable by up to thirty days in jail,7 a fine not exceeding 
$1,000,8 and imposition of community service and payment of other 
assessments and fees.9 
6 The criminal sanction became effective on January 1, 2011. 2010 
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 166, § 26 at 415. 
7 “A crime is a petty misdemeanor if it is so designated in this
Code or in a statute other than this Code enacted subsequent thereto, or if
it is defined by a statute other than this Code that provides that persons
convicted thereof may be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not to exceedthirty days.” HRS § 701- 107(4) (Supp. 2005).

II. Arrest and proceedings through trial 
During the early morning hours of April 20, 2011, Won 
was observed driving at a high rate of speed by an officer of 
the Honolulu Police Department (HPD). After pulling Won over, 
the officer detected the odor of alcohol on Won’s breath and 
observed that Won’s eyes were “red” and “watery.” Based on this information, the officer concluded that Won was likely 
intoxicated. A standard field sobriety test and preliminary 
alcohol screen test were administered, both of which Won failed. 
Won was arrested for OVUII in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) 
and transported by police to the local police station.
10 
At the police station, an officer read to Won a form 
entitled “Use of Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle Implied Consent for Testing” (Implied Consent Form).
11 Of foremost 
relevance to this case, the Implied Consent Form informs arrested persons of certain information, in three sections. 
10 HRS § 291E- 61(a)(3) (Supp. 2010) provides: 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operatesor assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
. . . 
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten
liters of breath . . . . 
11 The police report apparently refers to the Implied Consent Form
as the “ADLRO form,” as the report notes, “I read Won the ADRLO form. He elected the breath test.” The Implied Consent Form is identified as “HPD­
396K (R- 01/11)” at the bottom left of the form.

                     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Pursuant to chapter 291E, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), 
Use of Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle, you are being
informed of the following: 
1.___ Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public way, 
street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of
the State shall be deemed to have given consent to a
test or tests for the purpose of determining alcoholconcentration or drug content of the persons breath,
blood or urine as applicable. 
2.___ You are not entitled to an attorney before you submit to any tests [sic] or tests to determine your alcohol
and/or drug content. 
3.___ You may refuse to submit to a breath or blood test, 
or both for the purpose of determining alcohol
concentration and/or blood or urine test, or both for
the purpose of determining drug content, none shall
be given [sic], except as provided in section 291E­21. 
However, if you refuse to submit to a breath,
blood, or urine test, you shall be subject to up tothirty days imprisonment and/or fine up to $1,000 or
the sanctions of 291E- 65, if applicable.  In 
addition, you shall also be subject to the procedures
and sanctions under chapter 291E, part III.[12] 
(Emphasis added). Thus, the Implied Consent Form has three 
principal provisions: an informational section, a denial of the 
right to counsel section, and a refusal to submit section. 
The Implied Consent Form includes space so that the 
person can initial each section to indicate acknowledgement. Won initialed both the refusal to submit section, which informed 
him that refusing to submit to the BAC test is punishable by up 
to thirty days of imprisonment and a fine of up to $1000, and 
the informational section. He did not initial the denial of the 
12   HRS § 291E- 65 applies to a person under the age of twenty- one at 
the time of the offense. HRS Chapter 291E, Part III addresses the
administrative revocation process which provides for suspension of the
person’s license and privilege to operate a vehicle.

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
right to counsel section.13 The Implied Consent Form separately 
has space for the person to indicate which BAC test--breath, 
blood, or urine--the person has agreed or refused to submit and 
also contains space for both the person and the officer 
administering the Implied Consent Form to sign. Won initialed 
next to “AGREED TO TAKE A BREATH TEST AND REFUSED THE BLOOD 
TEST” and signed the form with his name at the bottom. 
A breath test was performed on Won using an 
Intoxilyzer 8000. 
Won’s BAC was 0.17 grams of alcohol per two 
hundred ten liters of breath, which is above the limit of 0.08 
grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath under which a person 
may legally operate a vehicle. See HRS § 291E-61(a)(3). Won 
was charged in the District Court of the First Circuit (district court) in an amended complaint with OVUII, in violation of HRS 
§ 291E-61(a)(3) and HRS § 291E-61(b)(1), as a first offense.
14 
13 Handwritten notes under the right to counsel section state, “said
he does not agree with this one, and was not going to initial.” 
14 The original complaint charged Won with violation of HRS “§ 291E­
61(a)(1) and or (a)(3).”  Won filed a motion to dismiss the original
complaint for failure to allege the requisite mens rea. Subsequent to Won’s
motion but prior to the district court’s ruling on it, this court issued
State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawaiʻ i 48, 276 P.3d 617 (2012), which held that mens 
rea must be included in a complaint alleging violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) 
but that it need not be alleged in a charge under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3). 
The district court denied the motion to dismiss and granted the State’s
motion to amend the complaint.  The amended complaint included the requisite
mens rea for the HRS § 291E
-61(a)(1) charge.  At trial, Won orally moved the
court to reconsider its decision denying the dismissal of the HRS § 291E­
61(a)(1) charge. The State did not object to the dismissal of the HRS§ 291E-61(a)(1) charge, and the court granted the motion.

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Won filed a “Motion to suppress statements and 
evidence of [Won’s] breath or blood test” (Motion). The 
following grounds were asserted for suppression of the BAC test: 
(1) Won was misled and inadequately advised as to his rights 
“surrounding the chemical test, in violation of not only 
existing Hawaiʻ i appellate precedent but also his Due Process 
rights”; (2) Won’s constitutional right to be adequately 
apprised of his rights was violated; (3) Won was deprived of an 
attorney in violation of HRS § 803-9;15 and (4) Won “was 
presented with a Hobson’s Choice, either remain silent or commit a crime.” 
The State disputed each of Won’s arguments, stating in 
response that (1) Won was adequately advised in regard to his rights prior to the breath test, (2) the breath test did not 
implicate a right to be advised of one’s constitutional rights, 
(3) the breath test did not implicate a Sixth Amendment right to

It shall be unlawful in any case of arrest for examination:  
(1)
 To deny to the person so arrested the right of seeing
. . . counsel . . . ; 
(2) To unreasonably refuse or fail to make a reasonable
effort . . . to send a . . . message . . . to the counsel 
. .. ; 
(3) To deny to counsel . . . the right to see or otherwise 
communicate with the arrested person at the place of the 
arrested person’s detention . . . .

counsel, and (4) the breath test did not implicate a statutory 
right to counsel under HRS § 803-9. 
On September 20, 2012, the district court heard Won’s 
Motion.16 The district court denied the Motion without making 
specific findings of fact or conclusions of law, and the case immediately proceeded to trial. The parties stipulated into 
evidence the facts as set forth above, as well as that the 
intoxilyzer result was accurate. Based on the stipulated facts, 
the district court found Won guilty of violating OVUII, HRS § 291E-61(a)(3).
17 Following conviction, Won’s sentence was 
stayed pending appeal of the judgment of conviction. Won timely appealed the judgment to the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
(ICA). 
III. Appellate Proceedings 
While this case was pending before the ICA, the 
Supreme Court of the United States decided Missouri v. McNeely, 
133 S. Ct. 1552 (2013). In that case, the Supreme Court held 
that the natural metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream 
does not present a per se exigency that qualifies as an 
16 The Honorable David W. Lo presided. 
17 The judgment of conviction indicates that Won violated “HRS [§]
291E–61(a)(1)(3)(b)(1).”  However, as noted  supra, the (a)(1) portion of the 
charge was dismissed, and the State proceeded to trial only on the (a)(3)
portion of the charge. An amended judgment of conviction was subsequentlyfiled reflecting “HRS [§] 291E- 61(a)(3)(b)(1)” presumably pursuant to a 
directive included in the Judgment on Appeal issued by the Intermediate Courtof Appeals. 
-10 ­ 
 
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
exception to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement for 
nonconsensual blood testing in all drunk-driving cases. Id.
 at 
1556. Won argued that  McNeely  requires nonconsensual blood or 
breath alcohol tests be justified by exigent circumstances or 
other exceptions to the warrant requirement in order to comport 
with the Fourth Amendment. Thus, Won asserted that the State 
must demonstrate that he consented to the breath test freely and 
voluntarily, a burden he claims the State failed to discharge 
because his exercise of the statutory and constitutional right to refuse consent was criminalized. That is, according to Won, 
his consent was coerced out of him by the threat of criminal 
prosecution and penalties. 
Relatedly, Won reasoned that the “claim and exercise 
of a constitutional right cannot . . . be converted into a 
crime.” 
“Under Hawaii’s current implied consent laws, a person 
must consent to an alcohol concentration test or face criminal 
prosecution”; thus, according to Won, “HRS § 291E-68 is 
unconstitutional on its face and as applied.” 
In response, the State construed the principle 
articulated by McNeely as “blood draws for alcohol concentration 
testing did not justify a per se exigent circumstances exception to the search warrant requirement.” The State submitted that it 
is an “overly expansive reading” of McNeely’s holding to suggest 
that a police officer cannot “coerce an OVUII arrestee to submit 
-11 ­ 
 
 
    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to a breath or blood test” by means other than force. 
Specifically, according to the State, if it can forcibly compel 
OVUII testing by acquiring a valid search warrant, the State 
could similarly coerce OVUII arrestees by employing less 
physically intrusive methods like criminal penalties. 
A. Decision of the ICA 
The ICA described the Supreme Court’s decision in 
McNeely as “address[ing] the narrow question of whether the 
dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream establishes a per se 
exigent-circumstances exception to the warrant requirement for 
nonconsensual blood draws for OVUII arrests.” State v. Won
, 134 
Hawaiʻi 59, 77, 332 P.3d 661, 679 (App. 2014).  According to the 
ICA’s reading of McNeely, it did not involve “other potential 
exceptions to the warrant requirement, the Fourth Amendment implications of breath tests, the validity of implied consent 
statutes, or the validity of breath tests conducted pursuant to 
such statutes.” 
Id. Hence, the ICA distinguished McNeely from 
this case because “Won agreed to submit to a breath test 
pursuant to Hawaii’s implied consent statute,” and he “was not 
subjected to a compelled nonconsensual blood draw.” Id. 
In upholding Won’s BAC test and the statutory scheme 
imposing sanctions for withdrawing consent, the ICA relied on a 
balancing analysis through which it was found that the search 
was reasonable due to its minimal invasiveness and the 
-12 ­ 
 
 
                        
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
overriding governmental interest in preventing OVUII violations. 
The ICA declared, citing Maryland v. King , 133 S. Ct. 1958, 1969 
(2013), that “the ultimate measure of the constitutionality of a 
governmental search is ‘reasonableness.’” Won, 134 Hawaiʻ i at 
77, 332 P.3d at 679. The ICA referenced a Hawaiʻ i appellate 
decision involving a search of a student at a school and stated, 
“In determining whether a warrantless search or seizure is 
reasonable, the court must balance the government’s need to 
search against the intrusion on the individual’s privacy­
interests.”18 Id. at 78, 332 P.3d at 680 (In re Doe, 77 Hawaiʻ i 
435, 444, 887 P.2d 645, 654 (1994)). 
The ICA also held that because “driving is a 
privilege, not a right,” id. at 78, 332 P.3d at 680, “[a]s a 
matter of law, a person who exercises the privilege to drive and 
operates a vehicle on a public road is deemed to have given his 
or her consent to submit to testing of the person’s breath, 
blood, or urine for alcohol or drugs.” Id. The ICA theorized 
that “[t]he Legislature presumably could have sought to make the 
implied consent to breath testing completely irrevocable.” Id. 
Thus, the ICA concluded that the statutory right to refuse to submit to testing does not take precedence over the driver’s 
implied consent to testing. 
The ICA similarly held that the 
18 See  infra  note 37. 
-13 ­ 
 
 
    
  
                     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
implied consent to testing is not rendered invalid by rights 
provided by the Hawaiʻ i Constitution.  As stated by the ICA, the 
statutory implied consent prevails over the statutory right to 
refuse to submit to testing and is not invalidated by article I, section 7 rights. Consequently, while the ICA recognized a 
“limited statutory right” to refuse a BAC test, it held that 
this limited right cannot invalidate the consent deemed by 
statute. 
Finally, the ICA found that the statutory implied 
consent could not be withdrawn, reasoning that “the purpose of 
the implied consent statute would be defeated if a driver could freely withdraw his or her consent to submit to a breath test 
after being arrested for OVUII.”  Id. at 79, 332 P.3d at 681.  
Accordingly, the ICA affirmed Won’s conviction and sentence.
19 
Id. at 80, 332 P.3d at 682. Won timely filed an application for writ of certiorari seeking review of the ICA’s judgment, which 
this Court accepted. 
19   Additionally, the ICA held as follows: (a) McNeely  did not render 
HRS § 291E– 68 unconstitutional, Won, 134 Hawaiʻ i at 80, 332 P.3d at 682; (b)
the administration of the Implied Consent Form was not an interrogation and,
thus, there was no requirement to advise Won of his constitutional rights,
id.  at 73,  332 P.3d at 675; (c) the administration of the Implied Consent 
Form does not confer a right to an attorney under HRS §  803-9, id.  at 74, 332 
P.3d at 676; and (d) the Implied Consent Form was not inaccurate ormisleading, id.  at 75—76, 332 P.3d at 677— 78, thus rejecting Won’s arguments.

B. Arguments on Certiorari 
Won argues that the BAC evidence in this case was 
obtained in an unconstitutional manner and should have been 
suppressed because no exception to the warrant requirement was 
applicable under the circumstances. He contends that the search 
incident to arrest exception and the special law enforcement needs exception to the warrant requirement are not applicable in 
this case. 
Won also asserts that the Implied Consent Form’s 
statement that a person “‘shall’ be subject to 30 days jail 
unless he consented” is coercive and precludes a finding of 
voluntary consent under article I, section 7 and the Fourth 
Amendment. According to Won, “[t]here is no Implied Consent exception to the warrant requirement,” which means that even if 
law enforcement officers comply with the State’s implied consent 
statute, it would not validate a warrantless BAC test in 
impaired driving cases.
20 
20 Won’s Application was supported by two briefs of amici curiae.
The National College for DUI Defense, Inc. argued that the criminal sanctions
of HRS § 291E-68 were an unconstitutional infringement on the Fourth 
Amendment, and assuming the criminal sanctions were constitutional, those 
sanctions entitled Won to be advised of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights
before consenting. The Hawaiʻ i Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers argued 
that the administration of the Implied Consent Form implicated Won’s right to
counsel under both article I, section 5 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution and HRS 
§ 803-9, and the violation of Won’s right to counsel required suppression of 
the results of the breath test.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The State, on the other hand, submits that “under the 
totality of the circumstances rule[,] . . . Won’s consent to 
provide a breath sample was given freely and voluntarily.” 
Although the State acknowledged that Won was not permitted to 
consult an attorney, the State emphasizes that “[t]he police 
officers followed the proper procedures, there is nothing in the 
record to indicate that Won’s will was overborne . . . , and he 
was informed by the Implied Consent Form that he could refuse to 
provide a breath or blood sample.” The State’s position is that it is not against the Constitution “for the [S]tate to enforce

for those drivers who chose to renege on their side of the 
bargain by refusing to provide a breath or a blood sample when 
it has been determined that they are OVUII.”

IV. Discussion 
A. A breath test is a search subject to constitutional
constraints 
“An invasion of bodily integrity implicates an 
individual’s ‘most personal and deep-rooted expectations of 
privacy.’” Missouri v. McNeely, 133 S. Ct. 1552, 1558 (2013) 
21 The State’s position was also supported by amicus curiae briefs
from the Attorney General of the State of Hawaiʻ i (AG).  The AG argued that
the breath test does not implicate a requirement to inform arrestees of their
constitutional rights. The AG further argued that the holding of McNeely 
applied only to blood tests and that Won’s breath test was excepted from the
requirements of a warrant by the exigency, search incident to arrest, and
special law enforcement needs exceptions.

(quoting Winston v. Lee, 470 U.S. 753, 760 (1985)). The Supreme 
Court has “never retreated . . . from [its] recognition that any 
compelled intrusion into the human body implicates significant, 
constitutionally protected privacy interests.” Id.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Ass’n,  489 U.S. 
602 (1989), defines a breath test as a search. 
In light of our society’ s concern for the security of one’ s 
person, . . . it is obvious that this physical intrusion, 
penetrating beneath the skin, infringes an expectation of
privacy that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. . . . 
Subjecting a person to a breathalyzer test, which generallyrequires the production of alveolar or 
“deep lung” breath 
for chemical analysis
about bodily integrity and, like the blood- alcohol test 
.  .  .  , should also be deemed a search
. 
Id. at 616-17 (emphases and paragraph break added). Thus, 
production of deep lung breath is a search under well-settled 
law.22 
22 The Supreme Court eliminated any implication in its prior case
law that warrantless BAC testing is permissible without regard to the
circumstances . McNeely,  133 S. Ct. at 1560.  McNeely  revisited Schmerber  to 
make it clear that the warrantless BAC search was permissible under the
exigency exception to the warrant requirement. 
Thus, our analysis in Schmerber  fits comfortably within 
[Supreme Court] case law applying the exigent circumstances
exception. In finding the warrantless blood test
reasonable in Schmerber, we considered all of the facts and
circumstances of the particular case and carefully based
our holding on those specific facts.  
McNeely,
 133 S. Ct. at 1560.  Thus, McNeely overruled any reading of 
Schmerber  that may have indicated that an individual may be forced to submit 
to a warrantless BAC test when no exception to the warrant requirement is
present. 
Further, although the BAC test in McNeely was a blood test, 
McNeely, 133 S. Ct. at 1558, the Supreme Court has applied McNeely to a case

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The right to be free of warrantless searches and 
seizures is a fundamental guarantee of our constitution. 
The right of the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches,seizures and invasions of privacy shall not be violated;
and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause,
supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly
describing the place to be searched and the persons or
things to be seized or the communications sought to beintercepted. 
Haw. Const. art. I, § 7. “We have repeatedly recognized that, 
if anything is settled in the law of search and seizure, it is 
that a search without a warrant issued upon probable cause is 
unreasonable per se.” State v. Ganal , 81 Hawaiʻ i 358, 368, 917 
P.2d 370, 380 (1996). 
As early as 1922, this court expressed protection of 
such constitutional rights in terms of personal autonomy: 
[I]t would not be possible to add to the emphasis with
which the Supreme Court . . . has declared the importance 
of keeping unimpaired the rights secured to the people by
[the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the U.S.
Constitution]. . . . [I]t is said that such rights are 
indispensable to the full enjoyment of personal security,personal liberty and private property.  
Territory v. Ho Me , 26 Haw. 331, 335 (Haw. Terr. 1922) (emphasis 
added) (ruling as inadmissible contraband that was seized by an 
officer after requiring a defendant to open his residence to a 
search). Accordingly, this court has cast the constitutional 
right to be free of “unreasonable searches, seizures and

involving other forms of BAC testing. See  Brooks v. Minnesota, 133 S. Ct. 
1996 (2013) (reversing case regarding blood and urine BAC tests “for further
consideration in light of [
McNeely]”).

   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
invasions of privacy” in the light of “the important fourth 
amendment values of individual dignity and integrity of the 
person.” State v. Kaluna, 55 Haw. 361, 366, 520 P.2d 51, 57 
(1974). 
These fundamental values are ensured preservation by 
the Hawaiʻ i Constitution: “The integrity of one’s person-­
including the right to be free of arbitrary probing by 
government officials . . . is at least as significant in terms 
of human dignity as the right to be free of externally imposed 
confinement.” Kaluna, 55 Haw. at 366, 370-71, 520 P.2d at 57, 
59-60. Thus, the proscription against “unreasonable searches, 
seizures and invasions of privacy” in the Hawaiʻ i Constitution 
draws individual dignity and personal autonomy within its 
protections. 
We have also recognized that “the warrant requirement 
is subject to a few specifically established and well-delineated 
exceptions.” Ganal, 81 Hawaiʻ i at 368, 917 P.2d at 380.  One of 
the specific exceptions is a search conducted pursuant to 
consent.23 Id. The district court rejected Won’s arguments 
23 No exception to the warrant requirement based on exigency can be 
gleaned from the facts and circumstances of this case. See  State v. Clark , 
65 Haw. 488, 494, 654 P.2d 355, 360 (1982) (generally defining an exigency as
“when the demands of the occasion reasonably call for an immediate police
response”). 
Nor has the State argued that an exigency is present. Further,
an exigency is not sufficient to validate a warrantless search in this case
because a legislature may not establish a per se exigency by statute.

“consent” both to the ICA and this court. In rejecting Won’s 
challenge, the ICA based its balancing analysis, in part, on its 
determinations that a driver has impliedly consented to 
submission to testing, id. at 78, 332 P.3d at 680; the 
(. . .continued)
The AG has argued that the special law enforcement needs
exception applies. However, where the purpose of the search is to generate
evidence for law enforcement purposes, it does not fall within that exception
as defined by the Supreme Court. See  City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 
U.S. 32, 41- 42 (2000) (where “the primary purpose of the . . . program is to 
uncover evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing, the program contravenes theFourth Amendment”)
; Ferguson v. City of  Charleston, 532 U.S. 67, 84 (2001) 
(“Such an approach is inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment.”);  see also  
William E. Ringle,  Searches and Seizures, Arrests and Confessions  § 10:13 
(2d. ed.) (“Under the special needs doctrine, exceptions to the warrantrequirement are permitted . . . . when police are engaged in activities 
unrelated to crime- solving.”); Wayne R. LaFave, 3 Search & Seizure: A 
Treatise on the Fourth Amendment § 5.4(c) (5th ed.). 
It is manifest that the purpose of the BAC test administered to 
Won was to gather evidence for criminal prosecution and, in fact, was soused. 
The State has not asserted that the purpose of the BAC test was for a
purpose other than to gather evidence for a criminal prosecution. 
This court has not been called upon to determine whether the
Hawaiʻi Constitution recognizes a “special law enforcement needs” exception to
the warrant requirement. In light of the fact that the search in this casewas for the purpose of collecting evidence for a criminal prosecution, we
conclude that under the Supreme Court’s definition, the special needs 
exception is not applicable to the circumstances of this case, and thus it is
unnecessary to address whether a “special law enforcement needs” exception to
the warrant requirement is in accordance with the Hawaiʻ i Constitution. 
The search incident to arrest exception is also inapplicable as
it is “limited in scope to a search of the arrestee’s person and the area
within his immediate control from which he could obtain a weapon or destroy
evidence.”  State v. Paahana, 66 Haw. 499, 506, 666 P.2d 592, 597) (internal
quotation mark omitted).  “[T]he exception for searches incident to a lawful 
arrest ‘implies the exigent circumstances of imminent danger to the arrestingofficer or others and of imminent concealment or destruction of evidence or 
the fruits of the crime from the circumstances of a lawful arrest.’”   Id.  
(quoting State v. Clark, 65 Haw. 488,  496, 654 P.2d 355, 361 (1982)).   As 
noted, McNeely  held that the natural metabolization  of alcohol does not 
qualify as a per se exigency, and the record indicates no other exigency that
necessitated the breath test.

legislature could have made that consent irrevocable, id.; and 
the purpose of the implied consent statute would be defeated if 
a driver could freely withdraw his or her consent, id. at 79, 
332 P.3d at 681. We examine the doctrine of consent: first 
generally and then as applied to the facts of this case. 
B. The consent exception to the warrant requirement 
Consent to be searched is a waiver of one’s right not 
to be searched. Nakamoto v. Fasi
, 64 Haw. 17, 21, 635 P.2d 946, 
951 (1981). Thus, in the context of a request by police to 
submit to a BAC test, consent and waiver have the same result. 
This court has repeatedly recognized that an individual has a 
constitutional right to refuse consent to a search when consent 
is requested by the State. State v. Kearns, 75 Haw. 558, 570, 867 P.2d 903, 909 (1994).
24
 “Consent” in the constitutional sense means more than 
the absence of an objection on the part of the person to be 
searched; it must be shown that such consent was voluntarily 
given. State v. Bonnell , 75 Haw. 124, 147-48, 856 P.2d 1265, 
24 Accord State v. Quino , 74 Haw. 161, 174, 840 P.2d 358, 364
(1992); Nakamoto,  64 Haw. at 21, 635 P.2d at 951; State v. Patterson, 58 Haw. 
462, 470, 571 P.2d 745, 750 (1977); State v. Price, 55 Haw. 442, 443, 521
P.2d 376, 377 (1974);  see also  Trainor, 83 Hawaiʻ i at 255, 925 P.2d at 823; 
Ganal

, 75 Haw. at 147- 48, 856

of course, superseded by a warrant or an exception to the warrant
requirement.

1277 (1993). Voluntariness means a “free and unconstrained 
choice.” State v. Shon
, 47 Haw. 158, 166, 385 P.2d 830, 836 
(1963) (quoting Schneckloth v. Bustamonte,  412 U.S. 218, 225-26 
(1973)); accord State v. Trainor, 83 Hawaiʻ i at 261, 925 P.2d 
829; 
State v. Ramones, 69 Haw. 398, 405, 744 P.2d 514, 517 
(1987). 
In Hawai
ʻi, consent is measured under an analysis 
examining the totality of the circumstances. Ganal, 81 Hawaiʻ i 
at 368, 917 P.2d at 380. 
Whether consent to a search was freely and voluntarily
given, as in a case where custodial interrogation may be
implicated, must be determined from the  totality of
circumstances  surrounding the defendant’s purported 
relinquishment of a right to be free of unreasonable 
searches and seizures. 
State v. Russo,  67 Haw. 126, 137, 681 P.2d 553, 562 (1984) 
(emphasis added). 
Additionally, it is well settled “that when 
the prosecution seeks to rely upon consent to justify the 
lawfulness of a search, it has the burden of proving by the 
preponderance of the evidence that the consent was, in fact, 
freely and voluntarily given.” State v. Patterson, 58 Haw. 462, 
468, 571 P.2d 745, 749 (1977). 
The question of whether the facts as found amount to 
legally adequate “consent” is a question of constitutional law that a court answers by exercising its “own independent 
constitutional judgment based on the facts of the case.” 
Trainor
, 83 Hawaiʻ i at 255, 925 P.2d at 823 (quoting State v. 
-22 ­ 
 
 
    
                     
    
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Lee, 83 Hawaiʻ i 267, 273, 925 P.2d 1091, 1097 (1996)).  This is 
because there is “no talismanic definition of ‘voluntariness,’ 
mechanically applicable to the host of situations where the 
question has arisen.” Trainor, 83 Hawaiʻ i at 261, 925 P.2d at 
829 (quoting Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 224). 
“In other words, application of constitutional 
principles to the facts as found requires [a court] to ‘examine 
the entire record and make an independent determination of the 
ultimate issue of voluntariness based upon that review and the 
totality of the circumstances.’” Id. (alteration omitted) 
(quoting State v. Kelekolio, 74 Haw. 479, 502, 849 P.2d 58, 69 (1993)). Therefore, the ultimate issue of whether the defendant 
provided “consent” is reviewed de novo. Id. 
1. Consent may not be coerced 
This court has stated unambiguously that for consent 
to be “in fact, freely and voluntarily given,” the consent “must be uncoerced.” Nakamoto, 64 Haw. at 21, 635 P.2d at 951 
(emphasis added). Thus, consent may not be gained by explicit or implicit coercion, implied threat, or covert force. State v. 
Price, 55 Haw. 442, 443, 521 P.2d 376, 377 (1974).
25 While 
coercion may be indicated where a person’s “will has been overborne,” Shon, 47 Haw. at 166, 385 P.2d at 836, ultimately, 
25 Accord Trainor, 83 Hawaiʻ i at 261, 925 P.2d at 829; Ganal, 81 Haw.
at 368, 917 P.2d at 380; Patterson, 58 Haw. at 468, 571 P.2d at 749.

     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
this court “equate[s] voluntary with uncoerced.” Price, 55 Haw. 
at 443, 521 P.2d at 377. 
“For, no matter how subtly the 
coercion was applied, the resulting ‘consent’ would be no more 
than a pretext for the unjustified . . . intrusion against which 
the fourth amendment is directed.” Trainor, 83 Hawai
ʻi at 261, 
925 P.2d at 829 (quoting Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 228). 
Thus, under circumstances where coercion is present, a 
search dependent upon consent for legitimacy violates the 
constitutional proscription of article I, section 7 and offends 
the values of individual dignity and personal autonomy that it 
protects. 
Accordingly, searches alleged by the State to be 
consensual are subject to “the most careful scrutiny” because neglect of such an examination “would sanction the possibility 
of . . . coercion,” Trainor, 83 Haw. at 262, 925 P.2d at 830, 
which this court has unstintingly protected against. This court 
has concluded that the contamination of coercion extends even to 
coercion by private actors: “although no state action is 
involved where an accused is coerced into making a confession by 
a private individual, we find that the state participates in that violation by allowing the coerced statements to be used as 
evidence.” State v. Bowe, 77 Hawaiʻ i 51, 59, 881 P.2d 538, 546 
(1994). 
-24 ­ 
 
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Our decisions demonstrate that the totality of the 
circumstances may indicate that an alleged waiver of a 
constitutional right was not voluntary even when there is a 
manifestation of assent by the defendant. For instance, mere 
acquiescence “in and of itself, is insufficient to establish 
consent.” Kearns, 75 Haw. at 571, 867 P.2d at 909; accord 
Trainor, 83 Hawaiʻ i at 260, 925 P.2d at 828; State v. Quino
, 74 
Haw. 161, 175, 840 P.2d 358, 364 (1992);  Nakamoto,  64 Haw. at 
22, 635 P.2d at 951; 
Kaluna, 55 Haw. at 371, n.7 520 P.2d at 60 
n.7. 
Verbal expression also may not be determinative of 
whether submission to a search is voluntary when the totality of circumstances surrounding the purported waiver is implicitly or 
subtly coercive. 
Russo, 67 Haw. at 137, 681 P.2d at 562. In 
Russo, despite the fact that the defendant stated “I gave you verbal consent” in response to the police request to search, the 
court stated that “[w]hile assent could be inferred from these 
words, the context in which they were uttered leads us to 
believe they did not represent an essentially free and 
unrestrained choice.” 67 Haw. at 138, 681 P.2d at 562; see also 
Trainor,  83 Hawaiʻ i at 253, 925 P.2d at 821 (finding submission 
to a search was nonconsensual despite defendant’s statement of “Okay” and opening his arms in response to police request for a 
pat down);

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(1992) (finding submission to a search was nonconsensual despite 
defendant’s assent); State v. Merjil, 65 Haw. 601, 606, 655 P.2d 
864, 868 (1982) (finding that “consent for [the search] was . . 
. given under duress”). 
In Nakamoto , we considered whether a search by a 
security guard of a bag of a concert attendee was consensual. 
Nakamoto
, 64 Haw. at 19, 635 P.2d at 949. The court 
distinguished between not being informed of the right to refuse 
consent and the person’s belief that he or she had no right to refuse. The court first noted that 
while there is no requirement that the person searched be
first informed of his right to refuse consent to the
search, the fact that he was not so advised is neverthelessa factor to be considered in evaluating the totality of the
circumstances as they bear upon the question of whether
such consent was freely and voluntarily given. 
Id. at 21, 635 P.2d at 951. Thus, although the constitution 
does not require that individuals be expressly informed of their 
right to refuse a search, whether they were so informed remains 
a relevant factor in a determination of whether consent was, in 
fact, free and voluntary under the totality of the 
circumstances. 
Further, 
when it is clear that the search will be conducted 
regardless of the consent of the party searched, there can
be no voluntary waiver of his right to be free from
unreasonable searches and seizures. So that even where he 
is asked directly whether he objects to the search, there
must be at least some intimation that his objection wouldbe meaningful or that the search is subject to his consent. 
-
26 ­ 
 
 
    
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Id. (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Thus, the process by 
which the consent to search is obtained must be meaningful and 
substantive; the request by the State that an individual waive 
the protections of the constitution must be more than a mere 
formality. See Price,
 55 Haw. at 444, 521 P.2d at 377 (“[W]hen 
the accused is directly asked whether he objects to the search, there must be at least some suggestion that his objection is 
significant or that the search waits upon his consent.”); Pauʻ u, 
72 Haw. at 511, 824 P.2d at 836 (holding that a search was 
invalid where the defendant “felt the futility of withholding 
any consent or confession”). 
After examining the totality of the circumstances of 
the plaintiff’s case, the Nakamoto court concluded that 
[the plaintiff] was not informed by the guard that she had
the right to refuse the inspection. She simply assumedthat the security guard was acting under an ordinance,
statute, or regulation authorizing the inspection.  So that 
while she was unwilling to submit to the inspection of her
personal effects, she believed that she had no other
alternative but to comply . . . . 
In these circumstances, there was no valid consent to the
inspection of her handbag by the security officer. She was 
not aware of her right to object and she reasonably
believed that she had no other alternative but to submit. Consent given in the belief that one would forfeit herright to attend the concert, if she refused to be searched,
is an inherent product of coercion and will not validate an
otherwise improper intrusion.  
Nakamoto , 64 Haw. at 22, 635 P.2d at 951 (emphases and paragraph 
break added). 
Therefore, although it is not necessary to inform 
a person of his or her right to refuse consent, if the person 
submits to the search under the belief that the search will 
-27 ­ 
 
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
occur regardless of an objection to the search or the person 
reasonably believed that there was no other alternative to 
prevent forfeiture of a right, that consent is coerced. 
In Trainor
, this court considered, inter alia, whether 
a pat-down search was consensual when a defendant contested his 
arrest and search following a “walk and talk investigation” at 
the Honolulu Airport. 83 Hawaiʻ i at 252, 925 P.2d at 820.  At 
the outset of the “encounter,” it was “represented” to the 
defendant that “he was not under arrest and was free to leave at 
any time.” Id. at 253, 925 P.2d at 821. After concluding that 
the encounter was an investigative seizure of the defendant 
notwithstanding the representation that he was free to leave, 
id.
 at 256, 925 P.2d at 824, the court also considered whether 
the encounter and the subsequent pat down of the defendant’s 
person could nonetheless be considered consensual considering 
that the defendant did not leave the encounter and verbally 
assented to the search. Id. at 260, 925 P.2d at 828. 
This court held that the investigative encounter could 
be deemed “consensual” only if, prior to the start of 
questioning, the person was informed of the right to decline to participate in the encounter and of the right to leave at any 
time
 and thereafter, the person voluntarily participated in the 
encounter. Id.
 at 260, 925 P.2d at 828. 
-28 ­ 
 
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
[T]he determination as to whether the person consented to
the questioning is a subjective one. By its very nature,
however, the subjective component of the inquiry regarding
consent cannot be a matter of whether the seized person has
been informed that he or she has the right to decline to
participate in the encounter and is free to leave at any
time. 
 After all, the person either has or has not been so
informed. Accordingly,  the subjectivity of the “consent” 
determination springs by definition from the question
whether,  after being given the prerequisite advice by the 
police, the person voluntarily participates in theencounter.  
Id. at 260-61, 925 P.2d at 828-29 (emphases added) (alterations 
and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Kearns, 75 Haw. 
at 573–74, 867 P.2d at 910 (Levinson, J., concurring)). 
Therefore, based on the distinction between the 
notification of the right to decline and the subjective component of “consent,” a court is required to resolve whether 
the circumstances demonstrate that the submission was 
consensual. “[E]ven if a seized person is given the 
prerequisite advice by the police, the court must still 
determine on the record before it whether the person has 
participated in the encounter voluntarily.” Id. at 261, 925

at 573–74, 867 P.2d at 910 (Levinson, J., concurring)). That 
is, a defendant’s objective knowledge of his or her 
constitutional rights is not a substitute for free and 
unconstrained consent. 
Further, when an individual is in the custody of the 
government, it is the State’s “particularly heavy” burden to 
-29 ­ 
 
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
demonstrate that such consent was “freely and voluntarily 
given,” free of covert force, explicit or implicit coercion, and 
implied threat. Ganal, 81 Hawaiʻ i at 368, 917 P.2d at 380; 
Russo, 67 Haw. at 137, 681 P.2d at 562. Although the “mere fact 
that a suspect is under arrest does not negate the possibility 
of [] voluntary consent,” proof of voluntary consent remains 
“important.” Price, 55 Haw. at 443-44, 521 P.2d at 377. When 
the “coercive atmosphere” of state custody is persistent, it is not dispelled merely by provision of other constitutional 
protections to the defendant, such as being advised of “Miranda 
warnings shortly before being asked for consent to a search.” 
See id. 
Thus, when a court examines the totality of the 
circumstances to determine whether a person consented to a 
search, the decisions of this court provide significant 
guidance. 
These decisions protect the free and unconstrained 
choice to retain or waive the rights afforded by article I, section 7, without compromise of the individual dignity and 
personal autonomy that inhere within that provision. 
The court is obliged to undertake the “most careful 
scrutiny” of the circumstances in which consent has been alleged to ensure that the State’s burden to demonstrate consent has 
been met, a burden that increases when the person is in custody 
at the time the purported consent was obtained. Informing the 
-30 ­ 
 
 
    
Dyer***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
person of the right to refuse consent is a relevant factor, but 
it cannot decide the matter. Similarly, acquiescence or a 
manifestation of assent may nonetheless be insufficient to 
demonstrate consent when coercive elements are present. 
Finally, the request by the State for consent or waiver of the 
rights expressed by article I, section 7 must be more than 
perfunctory and provide the individual with a genuine and 
meaningful choice; that is, there must be some intimation that 
an objection to the search would be significant or that to withhold consent would not be futile. 
2. Consent may be withdrawn 
As a corollary of the requirement that consent to a 
search must be voluntary, consent to a search may be revoked or withdrawn at any time before the search has been completed. “A 
suspect may of course delimit as he chooses the scope of the 
search to which he consents.” Florida v. Jimeno
, 500 U.S. 248, 
252 (1991). “Clearly a person may limit or withdraw his [or her] consent to a search, and the police must honor such 
limitations.” 
United States v. Dyer , 784 F.2d 812, 816 (7th 
Cir. 1986); see also Burton v. United States, 657 A.2d 741, 746 
(D.C.
 1994) (citing Jimeno and  to conclude, “We think these 
authorities compel the conclusion that when the basis for a 
warrantless search is consent, consent may be withdrawn any time 
prior to completion of the search.”); 
United States v. McWeeney,

   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
454 F.3d 1030, 1034 (9th Cir. 2006) (“A suspect is free . . . to 
delimit or withdraw his or her consent at anytime.”); United 
States v. Ho, 94 F.3d 932, 936 n.5 (5th Cir. 1996) (“A consent which waives Fourth Amendment rights may be limited, qualified, 
or withdrawn.”); United States v. Carter, 985 F.2d 1095, 1097 
(D.C.
 Cir. 1993) (recognizing a constitutional right to withdraw 
consent to a search); LaFave,  supra note 23, § 8.1(c).   
Additionally, “as the ultimate judicial tribunal with 
final, unreviewable authority to interpret and enforce the 
Hawai
ʻi Constitution,” we recognize our state constitution as an 
independent source of protection for our citizens. Kaluna, 55 
Haw. at 369, 520 P.2d at 58. Accordingly, the right provided by 
article I, section 7 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution to be free of 
warrantless searches, when no exception to the warrant 
requirement is present, carries with it the right to withdraw consent to a search. 
In this case, two forms of consent to a bodily search 
are relevant to the discussion: (1) irrevocable consent 
allegedly deemed by statute and (2) informed and voluntary 
consent under the totality of circumstances.

C.	 Irrevocable consent to a search allegedly deemed by statute
is contrary to our law 
Every person who drives on the roads of Hawaiʻ i is 
deemed to have given consent to a BAC test when suspected of 
OVUII. 
Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public way,
street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of theState 
shall be deemed to have given consent  . . . to a test 
or tests approved by the director of health of the person’sbreath, blood, or urine for the purpose of determining
alcohol concentration or drug content of the person's
breath, blood, or urine, as applicable. 
HRS § 291E-11(a) (emphasis added). However, before 
administering a BAC test, police must inform the driver that his or her “deemed” consent may be withdrawn by refusing to submit 
to testing. 
The test or tests shall be administered  at the request of a 
law enforcement officer having probable cause to believe
the person operating a vehicle . . . is under the influence 
of an intoxicant or is under the age of twenty
-one and has 
consumed a measurable amount of alcohol,  only after: 
A lawful arrest; and  
The person has been informed  by a law enforcement officer 
that the person may refuse to submit to testing under this
chapter.  
HRS § 291E-11(b) (emphases added). The requirement that police 
must inform the person that consent may be withdrawn is in 
accordance with other provisions of the implied consent law: 
“[i]f a person under arrest refuses to submit to a breath, 
blood, or urine test, 
none shall be given, except as provided in

§ 291E-65(a) (“If a person under arrest . . . refuses to submit 
to a breath or blood test, none shall be given . . . .” 
(emphasis added)). “Thus, as the statutory language makes 
clear, a driver’s ‘implied consent’ to an evidentiary chemical 
alcohol test is qualified by his or her implied right to refuse 
such a test . . . .” State v. Wilson
, 92 Hawaiʻ i 45, 49, 987 
P.2d 268, 272 (1999) (emphasis added). 
This court has upheld the State’s OVUII “implied 
consent scheme” only when the driver is “afforded . . . the 
opportunity to make a knowing and intelligent decision whether to take an evidentiary [BAC] test.”
27 Id. at 49-50, 987 P.2d at

and accurately inform drivers of their implied right to consent

26 A warrantless BAC test may be required by police pursuant to HRS
§ 291E-21 from the operator of any vehicle involved in a collision resulting 
in injury to or the death of any person. Such a test does not offend the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution “so long as (1) the police have probable cause to believe 
that the person has committed a DUI offense and that the blood sample will
evidence that offense, (2) exigent circumstances are present, and (3) the
sample is obtained in a reasonable manner.” State v. Entrekin,  98 Hawai‘ i 
221, 232, 47 P.3d 336, 347 (2002). In Entrekin, “exigent circumstances were 
clearly present.” Id. at 233, 47 P.3d at 348.

driver arbitrary, false, or misleading information regarding a driver’srights under the implied consent law and still compel the admission of theresults in the criminal context”).

   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Thus, we have recognized that the State’s statutory consent 
scheme carries with it a right to withdraw that consent, such 
that when the State requests that an individual submit to a BAC 
test, that individual must be afforded an opportunity to decide 
whether to submit to testing. Id. 
For a person to be deemed by the implied consent law 
to have irrevocably  consented to be searched also conflicts with 
this court’s decision in 
Nakamoto. In Nakamoto
, this court 
found that consent given under the “belie[f] that she had no other alternative but to comply,” or a “reasonabl[e] belie[f] 
that she had no other alternative but to submit” could “not 
validate an otherwise improper intrusion.” 
 64 Haw. at 
22, 635 P.2d at 951. Accordingly, if a person waives the right to refuse to be searched under the belief that he or she must 
waive that right, then the waiver is invalid. Similarly, if the 
right to refuse is foreclosed by statute, then there is no 
(.  .  .continued) 
under section 291E
-41, 291E- 65, or 291E- 68” as a necessary condition for the 
sanction of the specified statute to be imposed. See  HRS § 291E- 15(1) 
(utilizing the disjunctive connector “or” in enumerating the penalties that a
police officer must inform a driver); HRS § 291E- 15(2) (a person’s refusal of 
a BAC test will subject that “person to the procedures and sanctions underpart III or  section 291E- 65, as applicable” (emphases added)).  Further, the
legislative history of HRS § 291E- 15 indicates that police are obliged to 
inform an arrestee only of the sanctions that may be sought to be imposed.
See  H. Stand. Comm. Rep. 762- 06, in 2006 House Journal, at 1391- 92 (noting 
that the legislative intent for the notice requirement is to “inform an
arrested driver of sanctions that may be imposed  for refusing to take” a BAC 
test (emphasis added)). For instance, HRS § 291E- 65 is only applicable to a 
person under twenty- one years of age; it is accordingly unnecessary to inform 
a person over twenty- one years of age of the sanctions provided by that 
section.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
alternative but to comply and submit; it follows that a waiver 
of the right to refuse, given under the belief that one’s 
consent is mandated by the statutory consent scheme, will always 
be invalid as a basis to conduct a search. 
Based on the statutory provisions of the implied 
consent law, see HRS §§ 291E-11(b), 291E-15, 291E-65(a), and the 
protections of the Hawai‘ i Constitution as interpreted by the 
decisions of this court, a person may refuse consent to submit 
to a BAC test, and the State must honor that refusal. 
Therefore, in order to legitimize submission to a warrantless 
BAC test under the consent exception, consent may not be predetermined by statute, but rather it must be concluded that, 
under the totality of the circumstances, consent was in fact 
freely and voluntarily given.
29 
29 “It is apparent that a constitutional prohibition cannot be
transgressed indirectly by the creation of a statutory presumption any more
than it can be violated by direct enactment. The power to create
presumptions is not a means of escape from constitutional restrictions.”
Bailey v. Alabama, 219 U.S. 219, 239 (1911) (holding that under the
Thirteenth Amendment, a state could not criminalize the failure to performunder a contract) (quoted approvingly in Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513,
526 (1958) (holding that a tax exemption could not be based on a state’s
infringement of a veteran’s First Amendment rights)). Here, if a personcould not withdraw one’s implied consent, the prohibition against warrantless 
searches would be transgressed by the creation of a statutory conclusive
presumption.

D. Informed and voluntary consent under the totality of
circumstances is not present in this case 
1. Inherent coercion of a request to search conditioned on
imprisonment 
The decisions of this court jealously protect our 
citizens from coerced submission to a search, because no matter 
how subtly the coercion was applied, the resulting “consent” is 
no more than a pretext for the intrusion forbidden by article I, 
section 7 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution.  See Trainor, 83 Hawaiʻ i 
at 261, 925 P.2d at 829; see also Patterson
, 58 Haw. at 467, 571 
P.2d at 748-49 (“voluntary” equates to “uncoerced”); Price, 55 
Haw. at 443, 521 P.2d at 377 (“We equate voluntary with 
uncoerced.”). Where a search may not be accomplished without consent, a request for consent that subjects the person to 
imprisonment for refusal is calculated to overbear a defendant’s 
will in order to impel submission. Balogh v. Balogh, 134 Hawaiʻ i 
29, 45, 332 P.3d 631, 647 (2014) (referencing Black’s Law 
Dictionary to define “coercion” as “[c]ompulsion of a free agent 
by . . . threat of physical force”); see also Bailey v. Alabama, 
219 U.S. 219, 244-45 (1911) (striking a state statute that 
provided criminal penalties for failure to pay a contractual 
debt because the “natural operation of the statute . . . 
furnishes a convenient instrument for [] coercion” forbidden 
under the Federal Constitution); Gompers v. Buck’s Stove & Range 
Co.
, 221 U.S. 418, 442 (1911) (noting in the context of a

vindicate the authority of the law . . . but . . . is intended 
to coerce the defendant to do the thing required”); Delia v. 
City of Rialto, 621 F.3d 1069, 1077 (9th Cir. 2010) (finding consent to search was coerced when defendant “was cautioned 
. . . that his failure to cooperate . . . could result in 
charges of insubordination and possible termination of his 
employment”), rev’d on other grounds sub nom., Filarsky v. 
Delia, 132 S. Ct. 1657 (2012); Inouye v. Kemna, 504 F.3d 705, 713 (9th Cir. 2007) (finding state action requiring 
participation in a religious program “clearly coercive” based on 
the threat of imprisonment); United States v. Ocheltree, 622 
F.2d 992, 994 (9th Cir. 1980) (finding consent was not voluntary 
where a government agent informed a defendant “that if consent 
was not forthcoming [the agent] would attempt to secure a search 
warrant, [with] a clear implication that appellant would be retained in custody until the warrant was obtained”). 
As noted, the Implied Consent Form that was presented 
to Won informed him, pursuant to HRS § 291E-68, that “if you 
refuse to submit to a [BAC] test, you shall be subject to up to 
thirty-days imprisonment and/or a fine up to $1,000.” See
 HRS 
§§ 291E-68; 701-107. Failing to submit to a search pursuant to HRS § 291E-68 is a petty misdemeanor offense, for which other 
sanctions in addition to a jail term and a fine may be imposed, 
-38 ­

including the payment of other court assessments and fees. HRS 
§§ 706-605(1)(d), (6); 706-640(1)(e). 
Where arrest, conviction, and imprisonment are 
threatened if consent to search is not given, the threat 
infringes upon and oppresses the unfettered will and free choice 
of the person to whom it is made, whether by calculation or 
effect.30 See id. at 261-63, 925 P.2d at 829-31 (finding that a 
permissive response to a request to search the defendant resulted only from “inherently coercive” circumstances that were 
“calculated to overbear [the defendant’s] will”); Pau
ʻu, 72 Haw. 
at 508, 824 P.2d at 835 (same).  Thus, the threat of the criminal 
sanction communicated by the Implied Consent Form for refusal to 
submit to a BAC test is inherently coercive.31  
30 The ICA characterized HRS § 291E-68 as a “threat” designed to 
increase submission: “the Hawaii Legislature has chosen to use the threat of
. . . criminal sanctions to encourage arrestees to submit to testing.”  Won,
134 Hawaiʻ i at 65, 332 P.3d at 667.  Notably, the legislature was cognizant of
the fact that “to criminalize refusal to submit to a breath, blood, or urine
test infringes upon important personal rights.” 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No.
907-10, in 2010 House Journal, at 1343; see also 2010 House Journal, at 838
(statement of Rep. Karamatsu) (mentioning that criminal refusal sanctions“make criminals of people who exercise their right to refuse” and could
“result[] in situations where the arrestee is convicted of refusal when the
test result would have indicated that the arrestee was not guilty of
[OVUII]”). 
It is noted that, according to the dissent, a significant
majority of states have not adopted a statute providing for criminal
sanctions for OVUII arrestees who refuse BAC testing. Dissent at 12 n.3. 
31 In concluding that the consent given in Nakamoto was involuntary 
and an “inherent product of coercion,” this court emphasized the fact 
that it 
was “given in the belief that [she] would forfeit her right to attend theconcert[] if she refused to be searched.” Nakamoto, 64 Haw. at 22, 635 P.2d 
at 951 (citing Gaioni v. Folmar, 460 F. Supp. 10 (M.D. Ala. 1978); Wheaton v.
Hagan, 435 F. Supp. 1134 (M.D.N.C. 1977)).  Thus, the court held that
Nakamoto’s consent did not “validate an otherwise improper intrusion.” Id.

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
2. Coercion inherent in conditioning the preservation of
fundamental rights on the waiver of other constitutional rights 
Article I, sections 5 and 7 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution 
provide a fundamental right not to be arrested except for 
probable cause.32 State v. Barnes, 58 Haw. 333, 335, 568 P.2d 
1207, 1209 (1977) (“[A]n arrest without a warrant will be upheld 
only where there was probable cause for the arrest.”). Probable 
cause exists when the arresting officer has reasonable grounds 
to believe, from facts and circumstances personally known to the 
officer, or of which the officer has trustworthy information, 
that the person arrested has committed or is committing an 
(. . .continued)
If, in Nakamoto, this court found as inherently coercive the 
threat of being barred from entering a government- owned arena if a 
concertgoer refuses a warrantless search, the threat of being subjected to
criminal sanctions if a suspected OVUII offender refuses a BAC test producesa significantly more severe level of coercion.  
32 Section 5 of article I provides as follows: 
No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property
without due process of law, nor be denied the equal
protection of the laws, nor be denied the enjoyment of theperson’s civil rights or be discriminated against in the
exercise thereof because of race, religion, sex or
ancestry. 
Haw. Const. art. I, § 5. Article I, section 7 provides as follows: 
The right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches,
seizures and invasions of privacy shall not be violated; 
and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause,
supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly
describing the place to be searched and the persons orthings to be seized or the communications sought to be
intercepted. 
Haw. Const. art. I, § 7.  
-

   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
offense. State v. Lloyd , 61 Haw. 505, 509, 606 P.2d 913, 916 
(1980). Thus, as an arrest may be effectuated only when there 
is reason to believe that a person has committed or is 
committing an offense, it is self-evident that a person has a 
right not to be arrested for lawful behavior. 
In situations in which police have not obtained a 
warrant and no other exception to the warrant requirement is 
present, the choice presented by the Implied Consent Form forces 
a defendant to elect between fundamental rights guaranteed by 
the Hawaiʻ i Constitution.  On the one hand, the person may 
exercise the constitutional right to refuse to be searched, thus 
relinquishing the constitutional right to not be arrested for 
conduct that is authorized by the constitution. 
Alternatively, the person may “choose” to be searched 
in order to prevent being arrested for the refusal crime, thus 
forfeiting the constitutional right to not be subject to a 
search absent a warrant or an exception to the warrant 
requirement. 
That is, with respect to both alternatives, a person 
must surrender one constitutional right for preservation of another. 
However, the government may not condition a right 
guaranteed in our constitution on the waiver of an equivalent 
-41 ­ 
 
 
    
                     
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
constitutional protection.33 State v. Joseph,  109 Hawaiʻ i 482, 
497, 128 P.3d 795, 810 (2006). “[I]t [is] intolerable that one 
constitutional right should have to be surrendered in order to 
assert another.” Id. (quoting Simmons v. United States, 390 
U.S.
 377 (1968)). 
It is manifestly coercive to present a person with a 
“choice” that requires surrender of the constitutional right to 
refuse a search in order to preserve the right to not be 
arrested for conduct in compliance with the constitution. It is 
equally coercive to “allow” the person to preserve the 
fundamental right to refuse a search by requiring the person to relinquish the right to not be arrested for conduct that does 
not violate the constitution. 
3. Significant punishment magnifies coercion 
In exercising the constitutional right to refuse to be 
searched, a driver is forced to manifest to the police a 
willingness to commit a crime. That is, the driver must commit a crime in police presence in order to exercise the refusal 
allowed by statute and the right to withdraw consent provided by 
the constitution. The coerciveness present in such 
33 Similarly, a state “cannot abridge [the] constitutional rule
[that police may not arrest a person except on probable cause] by making it a
crime” to refuse to answer police requests for identification, “any more than
it could abridge the protections of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments by making it a crime to refuse to answer police questions once a suspect has been taken
into custody.” 
Kolender v. Lawson , 461 U.S. 352, 366- 67 (1983) (Brennan, J., 
concurring). 
-42 ­ 
 
 
    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
circumstances, requiring commission of a new crime in order to 
preserve the right not to be searched, is enhanced by the 
severity of the statutory penalty for the refusal offense. 
The statute criminalizing refusal to submit to a BAC 
test, HRS § 291E-68, authorizes imprisonment that is six times 
greater than that provided by the OVUII offense for a first-time 
offender. 
Specifically, the refusal offense is punishable for 
up to thirty days in jail, whereas a first OVUII offense carries a maximum of five days of imprisonment. 
Compare HRS §§ 701-107, 
with 291E-61 (b)(1)(C)(ii). Thus, the coercion produced by the 
mandated criminal sanction for refusing to waive a 
constitutional right is increased as a result of the serious 
penalties authorized for refusing to waive this right. 
4. Under the totality of the circumstances, Won’s election to
submit to the BAC test was not voluntary 
Our de novo review of the record indicates that while 
in custody, Won was informed both of his right to refuse to 
consent and of the fact that should he exercise his right to 
refuse to submit to a BAC test, his refusal would constitute the 
commission of a crime: he would be subject to re-arrest for the 
additional crime of refusal to consent, and he would be subject 
to up to thirty days of imprisonment, a fine not to exceed 
$1,000, as well as other sanctions. 
Under these circumstances, 
Won marked the Implied Consent Form with a manifestation of 
-43 ­ 
 
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
assent. However, as in Trainor,  the fact that the right to 
refuse the test was communicated and that there was a 
manifestation of assent by Won does not reduce our duty to 
determine whether Won voluntarily consented to the search. See 
Trainor
, 83 Hawai i at 260, 925 P.2d at 828. 
The circumstances further indicate that the election 
presented by the Implied Consent Form forced Won to select between fundamental constitutional rights and that refusal to 
provide consent carried with it a significant punishment. 
As in Russo, it is apparent that “[w]hile assent could 
be inferred from” Won’s election on the Implied Consent Form, the context in which it was made “leads us to believe [that it] 
did not represent an essentially free and unrestrained choice.” 
See Russo, 67 Haw. at 138, 681 P.2d at 562. Directed to sign a 
form in the presence of a police officer to indicate either 
submission to a search or willingness to commit a crime, it is 
clear that the “circumstances begat an obligation on [the

Implied Consent Form. See Trainor, at 262, 925 P.2d at 830 
(alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). 
Where the 
Trainor court found that “it would be simply 
wrong to suggest that” the defendant was actually able to walk 
away from the encounter, id., here it would be simply wrong to 
conclude that an instruction that a person’s refusal to consent

to a BAC test was a crime, with stated penalties of up to thirty 
days of incarceration and a $1,000 fine, would not interfere 
with a person’s free and unconstrained choice. The threat of 
imprisonment is inherently coercive, see State v. Brooks, 838 
N.W.2d 563, 573-74 (Minn. 2013, Stras, J., concurring), 
cert. 
denied, 134 S. Ct. 1799 (2014); thus, the present case is more coercive than the circumstances in Trainor and 
Nakamoto because 
rather than speculate whether a refusal to consent to a search might carry unwanted consequences, Won was informed in no uncertain terms that the consequence of his refusal made him 
subject to imprisonment. 
Thus, as in Nakamoto, it is clear that Won had no 
other alternative to avoid prosecution for the refusal offense 
but to submit to the search; as in Puaʻ a, withholding consent was 
futile, as any other course would have resulted in Won’s 
commission of a crime. 
Consequently, the position in which Won 
was placed, because of the criminal sanction for refusal, the forced selection between constitutional rights, and the 
potential significant punishment the sanction entailed, was 
inherently coercive.
34 See Trainor, 83 Hawaiʻ i at 263, 925 P.2d 
34 It bears repeating here that this opinion does not concern the
civil administrative penalties attendant to a driver’s refusal of BAC
testing. See HRS § 291E -41(d) (Supp. 2010); see generally  HRS Chapter 291E, 
Part III. Those types of sanctions are not affected in any way by our
decision. Because we conclude only that the threat of being subjected to
criminal sanctions inherently coerces a suspected OVUII offender into giving

at 166, 385 P.2d at 836. 
As the coercion engendered by the Implied Consent Form 
runs afoul of the constitutional mandate that waiver of a 
constitutional right may only be the result of a free and 
unconstrained choice, the choice presented to Won compromised 
the values of individual dignity and personal autonomy protected 
by article I, section 7 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution.  For this 
reason, Won’s election on the Implied Consent Form to submit to 
a BAC test is invalid as a waiver of his right not to be 
searched . 
Therefore, with little or no indication in the record 
to demonstrate that Won’s election to submit to the BAC test was the result of his free and unconstrained choice, the State has 
consent, if a police officer does not inform the offender of the criminal
sanctions because they were omitted from the notice given by the officer, see 
HRS § 291E- 15; supra  note 28, then proving OVUII through evidence of a 
defendant’s blood alcohol content, see HRS § 291E -61(a)(3)— (4), will remain a 
viable option for purposes of prosecution. Further, in cases where BAC
evidence is inadmissible because it was obtained in the absence of valid consent, the State is free to rely upon “other relevant evidence of
intoxication in order to prosecute” an accused OVUII offender pursuant to
“the criminal offense of [OVUII], e.g., the manner in which [the accused] was
observed to have driven his vehicle, his conduct in performing the requisite
alcohol tests, his appearance, demeanor, and other valid police observations
of signs of intoxication.” State v. Wilson, 92 Hawaiʻ i 45, 54 n.14, 987 P.2d 
268, 277 n.14 (1999); see  HRS § 291E- 61(a)(1)— (2) (OVUII can be proven by 
evidence that a person is operating a vehicle “[w]hile under the influence of
alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair the person’s normal mentalfaculties or ability to care for the person and guard against casualty” or
“[w]hile under the influence of any drug that impairs the person’s ability to
operate the vehicle in a careful and prudent manner”).

not met its particularly heavy burden to demonstrate the 
voluntary waiver of a constitutional right.35 Accordingly, Won’s 
election to submit to the BAC test was not based on voluntary consent.
36 
E. The ICA’s analysis was in error 
The protections guaranteed in article I, section 7 of 
the Hawaiʻ i Constitution “against unreasonable searches and 
seizures and invasions of privacy” are preserved by the 
fundamental principle in our law that warrantless searches are 
unreasonable per se, absent “a few specifically established and 
well-delineated exceptions.” Ganal, 81 Hawaiʻ i at 368, 917 P.2d 
at 380. Hence, under Hawaiʻ i law, it is not accurate to say that 
35 Our decision is consistent with this court’s recognition of our
constitution’s protection in article I, section 7 against the impairment of
voluntary consent by coercion. See, e.g., Trainor , 83 Hawai i at 263, 925
P.2d at 831; 
Nakamoto
, 64 Haw. at 22, 635 P.2d at 951. Thus, the decisions
of other jurisdictions that have not found the threat of imprisonment for
failing to submit to a BAC test to be inherently coercive,  see, e.g., State 
v. Smith, 
849 N.W.2d 599 (N.D. 2014); State v Brooks, 838 N.W.2d 563 (Minn.
2013); Burnett v. Municipality of Anchorage,  806 F.2d 1447 (9th Cir. 1988), 
are at odds with the preservation of voluntary choice and respect for human 
dignity embodied by Hawaiʻ i law.  See, e.g., Kaluna, 55 Haw. at 366, 520 P.2d 
at 57. 
36 The dissent takes issue with this opinion for not considering the
facial constitutional validity of the criminal refusal sanctions under theimplied consent statutory scheme. Dissent at 31— 32.  However, Won agreed to
take a breath test and, therefore, was not subjected to any criminal
sanctions attendant to a refusal of a BAC test. Thus, we resolve this case
on the question of whether Won acceded to the breath test voluntarily and
without coercion in accordance with the requirements of consent embodied by
article I, section 7 of the Hawai i Constitution. This is consistent with the 
longstanding canon counseling “courts [to] avoid reaching constitutional
questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.” Hawaii Gov’t

“the ultimate measure of the constitutionality of a governmental 
search is ‘reasonableness,’” as stated by the ICA. Won, 134 
Hawaiʻi at 78, 332 P.3d 680 (citing King, 133 S. Ct. at 1969).  
The Hawaiʻ i Constitution does not determine whether bodily 
intrusions are lawful under an indeterminate balancing test for 
“reasonableness,” 
Won, 134 Hawaiʻ i at 78, 332 P.3d at 661; 
instead, a warrantless search is precluded where no exception 
rooted in our law is present.37 Wallace, 80 Hawai i at 393, 910 
P.2d at 706. 
The ICA asserted that “the Legislature presumably 
could have sought to make the implied consent to breath testing 
completely irrevocable.” Won, 134 Hawaiʻ i at 78-79, 332 P.3d at 
680-81. Consequently, the ICA acknowledged the existence of a 
statutory right to refuse consent under our law, but it 
concluded that it is ineffective and cannot invalidate the 
consent deemed by statute. Under the ICA’s analysis, it is not clear what remains of a “right” to refuse to submit to a BAC 
37 The ruling in  In Interest of Doe , 77 Hawaiʻ i 435, 444, 887 P.2d
645, 654 (1994), relied upon the ICA for its “reasonableness” analysis, was
specifically confined to the particular circumstances presented in that case. 
We emphasize that the exception to the warrant requirement
of article I, section 7 of the Hawai
ʻi Constitution, and the
relaxation of the probable cause standard to one of
reasonable suspicion that we prescribe in the present case,
are strictly limited to the school context and the unique 
balance of interests present therein.

test when that right is “modified.” As discussed above, it is 
well settled that an individual retains the right to consent or 
to decline to consent to a BAC test at the time the State makes 
its request. Garcia, 96 Hawaiʻ i at 207, 29 P.3d at 926; Wilson, 
92 Hawaiʻ i at 49-50, 987 P.2d at 272-73; 
Nakamoto, 64 Haw. at 21, 
635 P.2d at 951. Thus, contrary to the ICA’s assertion, the 
right to refuse to submit to a BAC test is not rendered 
ineffectual by the statutory implied consent. HRS §§ 291E­
11(b), 291E-15, 291E-65(a). 
The ICA also appears to extend the consent allegedly 
deemed by statute into the protections secured by the Federal 
and Hawaiʻ i Constitutions, stating that “[t]he limited statutory 
right to refuse testing also does not mean that the driver’s 
implied consent is not valid for purposes of the Fourth 
Amendment and Article I, Section 7.” Won, 134 Hawaiʻ i at 78, 332 
P.3d at 680. That is, the ICA asserts that the driver’s implied 
consent is recognized by or affirmed under the constitution, and 
therefore, there is no right to withdraw consent. However, the 
right to refuse consent to a BAC test is not merely a right 
provided by statute; rather, the right to refuse to consent to 
be searched and the right to withdraw consent are intrinsic in our constitution. Nakamoto, 64 Haw. at 21, 635 P.2d at 951; 
Price, 55 Haw. at 443, 521 P.2d at 377.

The ICA’s balancing approach to determine 
reasonableness has not been adopted in our State and does not 
comport with an individual’s rights against warrantless searches 
guaranteed by the Hawaiʻ i Constitution.  Further, this approach 
discounts the statutory and constitutional rights to refuse to 
submit to a BAC test and does not account for the coercive 
nature of the threat of imprisonment communicated by the Implied 
Consent Form, the forced selection between constitutional 
rights, or the significant punishment authorized for the refusal 
offense. Accordingly, we conclude that the ICA’s analysis is in 
error.38 
The dissent’s analysis is erroneousF. 
1. The doctrine of unconstitutional conditions does not apply 
The dissent employs the doctrine of unconstitutional 
conditions,39 a different balancing test than that used by the 
38 The ICA opinion also implies that counsel would be of no benefit
to a person determining whether to sign the HPD- 396K Consent Form because 
“counsel could not have directly advised Won to refuse to submit to testing.”
Won, 134 Hawaiʻ i at 74, 332 P.3d at 676.  Even under the ICA premise that
there is no right to refuse consent to a BAC test, an important function of
counsel is to explain to a client the choices that may be presented andramifications that may flow from the election of one course of action as
opposed to another. We thus reject any implication by the ICA Opinion of
narrowing the role and importance of counsel. 
39 This doctrine “limits the government’s ability to exact waivers
of rights as a condition of benefits, even when those benefits are fullydiscretionary.” 
United States v. Scott, 450 F.3d 863, 866 (9th Cir. 2006).
It also ensures that constitutional rights are not eroded “by preventing thegovernment from coercing people into giving them up.”

ICA, in concluding that the legislature was authorized to 
criminalize the refusal by a suspected OVUII offender of a BAC 
test as a condition of the privilege of driving on public roads. 
Dissent at 16—29. Significantly, this Court has never applied 
this doctrine in criminal cases,40 for when law enforcement 
conducts a warrantless search with the intention to discover evidence of a crime, article I, section 7 governs. And as 
already made clear, the proper inquiry in those instances is 
whether the State has proven that the warrantless search falls within an exception to the warrant requirement recognized by 
(. . .continued)
Analysis under this doctrine consists of two parts. 
First, the
court must identify the condition imposed by the government in exchange for
the benefit. Nakamoto, 64 Haw. at 23, 635 P.2d at 952.  Second, a balancing
test must be conducted to determine whether the governmental interest in
imposing the condition is so compelling as to clearly outweigh the burdens 
that the condition levies upon constitutional guarantees. Id. at 23—24, 635 
P.2d at 952. 
40 This court has utilized or at least mentioned this doctrine only
in civil cases. See  Nakamoto v. Fasi,
 64 Haw. 17, 22, 635 P.2d 946, 951
(1981); Perry v. Planning Comm’n of the Cnty. of Haw. , 62 Haw. 666, 682, 619 
P.2d 95, 106 (1980); The King v. Lau Kiu, 7 Haw. 489, 492 (Haw. Kingdom1888). At least one state appellate court has explicitly rejected a
balancing approach in the context of a case similar to ours, reasoning that
the fundamental inquiry is whether the implied consent statute creates animpermissible per se exception to the warrant requirement, not whether the
legislature is authorized to enact such a statute. See  Weems v. State, 434 
S.W.3d 655, 665 (Tex. App. 2014), pet. granted  (Aug. 20, 2014). 
Further, this doctrine was not used in any of the other state
appellate cases where criminal refusal sanctions were found not to be
inherently coercive.  See, e.g., People v. Harris,  184 Cal. Rptr. 3d 198, 213 
(Cal. Ct. App. 2015) (applying the totality of the circumstances test todetermine whether the consent exception to the warrant requirement validated
the warrantless blood test), review denied (June 10, 2015); State v. Brooks, 
838 N.W.2d 563, 569 (Minn. 2013), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 1799 (2014)

this Court. See Ganal , 81 Hawaiʻ i at 368, 917 P.2d at 380.  
Thus, there is a presumption of invalidity when a warrantless 
search is at issue, State v. Heapy , 113 Hawai i 283, 307, 151 
P.3d 764, 788 (2007), which can be rebutted by the State not by 
proving that the governmental interest outweighs the 
unauthorized privacy intrusion, dissent at 17, but by demonstrating that a well-recognized and narrowly defined 
exception to the warrant requirement applies. 
Ganal, 81 Hawaiʻ i 
at 368, 917 P.2d at 380. 
Under the dissent’s theory--that the government can 
criminalize the exercise of the constitutional right to withhold 
or revoke consent because of the government’s compelling 
interest in protecting the public from OVUII offenders--there is 
nothing to proscribe the government from branding as a crime the 
exercise of other constitutional rights. 
The government need 
only cite dire statistics resulting from a particular crime to claim that there is a serious societal problem, find or create a governmentally provided privilege, attach to that privilege a 
condition waiving a constitutional right, and then rationalize 
such a waiver by referring to published reports or articles that 
have identified its possible benefits. 
That is, the dissent relegates constitutionally 
guaranteed rights to a position in which they may be eliminated

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
doing so and the exercise of that right can be associated with a 
negative societal impact. For example, in the OVUII context, 
the dissent’s analytical rubric could potentially allow the 
government to eviscerate all constitutionally guaranteed rights 
of motorists.41 If the compelling interest of the government 
trumps the constitutional right not to be searched without a warrant, it can be extended to similarly defeat the Miranda 
rights or the right to counsel of an OVUII defendant by making 
their exercise a criminal offense if it can be statistically shown that instances of OVUII-related incidents or casualties 
are diminished when Miranda rights and the right to counsel are 
waived.
42    
41 The elimination of constitutional rights in the criminal arena,
through the application of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine that the
dissent endorses, would facilitate convictions, the attendant consequences of
which include incarceration, criminal fines, and the stigma of being branded
a criminal. These consequences are significantly more serious than those
exacted in the civil arena, where this doctrine was designed to operate in.
See  Zap v. United States , 328 U.S. 624, 628 (1946) (holding that Fourth and 
Fifth Amendment rights could yield as a condition of a contractor’s agreementwith the government); Yin v. California, 95 F.3d 864, 872 (9th Cir. 1996)
(holding that a state employee’s union “contract may under appropriate
circumstances diminish (if not extinguish) legitimate expectations ofprivacy”); Wyman v. James,  400 U.S. 309, 317— 18 (1971) (conditioning receipt 
of welfare benefits upon home visits found valid). 
42 Implicit in the dissent’s argument is that by criminalizing the
right to refuse to submit to a breath or blood test, OVUII arrestees will becoerced into taking such a test, increasing the conviction rate of arrestees,and in turn decreasing OVUII- related casualties.  See 
Dissent at 2
0—24.  The 
same outcome could reasonably be anticipated by eliminating Miranda  rights or 
the right to counsel of OVUII defendants. 
-53 ­ 
 
 
     
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
validity of a warrantless search is a particularly dubious 
enterprise, because “the needs of law enforcement stand in 
constant tension with the Constitution’s protections of the 
individual against certain exercises of official power. It is 
precisely the predictability of these pressures that counsels a 
resolute loyalty to constitutional safeguards.” Almeida-Sanchez 
v. United States,  413 U. S. 266, 273 (1973). As one state 
appellate court aptly recognized when it refused to apply a 
balancing approach in a similar case, “the primary purpose of the search . . . is for investigation of a crime based on a 
discretionary determination by a law-enforcement officer that 
there is probable cause of intoxication.” State v. Villarreal, 
No. PD-0306-14, 2014 WL 6734178, at *17 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014), reh’g granted (Feb. 25, 2015). Because the governmental 
interest when a search is at issue is intertwined with a 
criminal investigative purpose, the need for a warrant is intensified to preserve the constitutional rights of the person 
to which the investigation is directed. 
Even assuming that the doctrine of unconstitutional 
conditions could somehow be considered applicable in this case, 
the dissent’s analysis would remain flawed. 
The condition 
imposed by the government in this case is implied consent to a warrantless search, in the form of a BAC test on a motorist 
suspected of OVUII, for the privilege of driving on public

roads. See HRS § 291E-11(a)—(b); cf. Nakamoto, 64 Haw. at 23, 
635 P.2d at 952 (stating that the governmentally levied 
condition was the “submission [by concertgoers] to a search of 
their persons” in exchange for the privilege of entering a 
government-owned arena to attend a concert). 
According to the dissent, however, the condition 
imposed by the government is the criminalization of the 
withdrawal of implied consent. Dissent at 15—16. This is a 
misidentification of the condition implicated, since the criminal refusal sanctions here are akin to the exclusion in 
Nakamoto of a concertgoer from a government-owned arena if he or 
she had refused a warrantless search of his or her bag. 
Plainly, the criminal refusal sanctions here and the exclusion 
from entry in
 Nakamoto are merely the consequences of a person’s 
refusal to abide by the governmentally imposed condition--a warrantless search--and are not the conditions from which an unconstitutional conditions analysis must proceed
.43 
43 The dissent also seems to be using the unconstitutional
conditions doctrine to conclude that actual consent  procured from a suspected 
OVUII offender under HRS § 291E
-11(b) is always valid if the requirements of 
the implied consent statute is adhered to, but this doctrine applies only
when “a government seeks to achieve its desired result by obtaining
bargained- for consent  of the party whose conduct is to be restricted.”  
Richard A. Epstein, Unconstitutional Conditions, State Power, and the Limits
of Consent, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 4, 7 (1988) (emphasis added). The bargained-
for consent here is a motorist’s implied consent to warrantless BAC testing 
under HRS § 291E- 11(a) in exchange for the privilege of driving on public 
roads. Hence, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine is meant to determine
the validity of implied consent under HRS § 291E- 11(a).  The doctrine is not 
calibrated to measure the validity of actual, non- bargained- for consent 
required by HRS § 291E- 11(b) because, as already explained, consent is

Further, even if one were to find that the correctly 
identified condition is criminalizing the withdrawal of implied 
consent and that it passes muster under the unconstitutional 
conditions doctrine,44 these findings are not determinative of 
the legal propriety of the search.45 What is dispositive is 
subject to an inquiry into the totality of the circumstances to determine
voluntariness. 
At the very outset, therefore, the dissent’s analysis is flawed
as is it inconsistent with the unconstitutional conditions framework that it purportedly follows. 
44 But see  Villarreal, 2014 WL 6734178, at *18 (concluding that “a 
DWI suspect’s privacy interest outweighs the State’s interest in preventing
drunk driving through warrantless searches” and quoting the McNeely  plurality 
in “stating that ‘the general importance of the government’s interest in this
area does not justify departing from the warrant requirement without a
showing’ that some established exception . . . applies”). 
45 The dissent concludes that the intrusion into privacy resulting
from a warrantless BAC test is “minimized” by the fact that OVUII arresteesare already “in custody, and thus, have a diminished expectation of privacy.”
Dissent at 27.  This justification is plainly contrary to our law as
promulgated by Kaluna and its progeny.  In 
 Kaluna, this Court reiterated that 
the state constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and
seizures “requires that governmental intrusions into the personal privacy ofcitizens of this State be no greater in intensity than absolutely necessary
under the circumstances.” State v. Kaluna, 55 Haw. 361, 369, 520 P.2d 51,
58
-59 (1974).  In effectuating this overarching principle, this Court refused 
to follow the Supreme Court’s allowance “of a complete body search of an
individual conducted as an incident to his lawful custodial arrest,” id. at 
367, 520 P.2d at 57, in order to avoid “lend[ing] unprecedented power to the
police to subject individuals under custodial arrest for even the most
trivial offenses to the indignities of an exhaustive body search when no
articulable reason supports such an intrusion other than the bare fact that
the arrestee is in custody.” Id. at 369, 520 P.2d at 59.  Simply, Kaluna
refused to hold “that since a lawful custodial arrest is a significant
intrusion into an individual’s privacy, further, ‘lesser’ intrusions may be
made without regard for their justifications.” Id. at 370, 520 P.2d at 59.  
Accordingly, the statement by the dissent that intrusion into the privacy ofOVUII arrestees from a warrantless BAC test is “minimized” because arrestees are already “in custody” and “have a diminished expectation of privacy” is
contrary to our law.

circumstances that make securing a warrant impractical in a 
particular case”). Thus, Won’s agreement to take the 
warrantless breath test in this case must be examined under an independent constitutional inquiry. 
As already made clear, the government must comply with 
the constitutional requirements undergirding the procurement and 
validity of consent and cannot, by statute, alter or reshape the 
doctrine of consent by rendering meaningless or short-circuiting 
its constitutional underpinnings--the most essential among which 
is voluntariness.
 See State v. Bonnell,
 75 Haw. 124, 147-48, 856 
P.2d 1265, 1277 (1993) (reasoning that consent “means more than 
the absence of an objection”; rather, “it must be shown that 
-57 ­ 
 
 
    
  
State,***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
such consent was voluntarily given”). Accordingly, contrary to 
the dissent’s view, actual consent under HRS § 291E-11(b) cannot 
be secured without regard to the constitutional principles 
fundamental to the doctrine of consent. See State ex rel. Anzai 
v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 99 Hawaiʻ i 508, 522, 57 P.3d 433, 
447 (2002) (stating that the legislature is without power to 
limit constitutional guarantees by way of legislation). 
2. The dissent creates an indefensible per se exception to the
warrant requirement 
The dissent’s conclusion that Won’s consent was valid 
rests solely upon its finding that the implied consent statute is a legitimate exercise of legislative authority. 
Dissent at 
27—28. However, this court has never held that the implied 
consent statute qualifies as one of the “specifically 
established and well[-]delineated exceptions” to the warrant 
requirement under article I, section 7. State v. Phillips,  67 
Haw. 535, 539, 696 P.2d 346, 349 (1985); see also Aviles v. 
 443 S.W.3d 291, 294 (Tex. App. 2014) (holding that 
implied consent statutes are not permissible exceptions to the warrant requirement), pet. filed (Aug. 8, 2014); State v. 
Fierro, 853 N.W.2d 235, 243 (S.D. 2014) (emphasizing that the court has never held South Dakota’s implied consent statute as a 
recognized exception to the warrant requirement). The dissent 
asserts that “cooperation with a criminal implied consent regime 
-58 ­ 
 
 
     
                     
  
    
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
yields real and voluntary consent that excuses officers from 
obtaining a warrant.” Dissent at 14. This assertion 
essentially treats compliance with the implied consent statute 
as one and the same as the constitutionally valid, voluntary 
consent required by HRS § 291E-11(b).46 However, the question of 
whether the implied consent statute is adhered to is separate and distinct from the constitutional inquiry into whether there 
is actual consent to BAC testing under HRS § 291E-11(b). 
Williams v. State,  771 S.E.2d 373, 376-77 (Ga. 2015). The 
constitutional dimension of consent, therefore, overlays the inquiry into whether the implied consent statute is technically 
complied with. 
Id. 
The dissent effectively renders every warrantless BAC 
test automatically valid for purposes of the Fourth Amendment 
and article I, section 7 so long as it is conducted in 
conformity with the implied consent statute and even if other facts and circumstances would otherwise preclude a finding of 
actual consent. See
 Dissent at 27—28. By ignoring the salient 
constitutional component of the inquiry, the dissent thus creates a per se exception to the warrant requirement.
47 Dissent 
46 Such treatment is incorrect especially because implied consent
statutes do “not take into account the totality of the circumstances present
in each case, but only consider certain facts.” Weems, 434 S.W.3d at 665.

at 27—28. The categorical nature of the dissent’s exception is 
incompatible with the principle that the validity of warrantless 
searches is contingent upon “all of the facts and circumstances 
of the particular case.” McNeely, 133 S. Ct. at 1560; see 
Weems, 434 S.W.3d at 665 (holding that Texas’ implied consent statute created an impermissible categorical exception to the 
warrant requirement). 
Additionally, the dissent’s per se exception is 
irreconcilable with an authoritative understanding of the 
that mere compliance with an implied consent statute per se satisfies the
requirements of actual consent. The inquiry in those cases still redounded
to whether, based on the totality of the circumstances, actual consent was
freely and voluntarily provided. See, e.g., People v. Harris, 184 Cal. Rptr. 
3d 198, 213 (Cal. Ct. App. 2015), 
review denied  (June 10, 2015) (holding that 
criminal penalties by themselves do not coerce consent, but determining“whether defendant’s submission in this case was freely and voluntarily given
under the normal totality of the circumstances analysis”); State v. Brooks, 
838 N.W.2d 563, 569 (Minn. 2013) (holding that the implied consent statute 
was complied with, but still analyzing the totality of the circumstances todetermine whether consent was voluntarily procured), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct.
1799 (2014); State v. Modlin, 867 N.W.2d 609, 619 (Neb. 2015) (stating “that 
a court may not rely solely on the existence of an implied consent statute to
conclude that consent to a blood test was given for Fourth Amendment purposes
and that the determination of whether consent was voluntarily given requiresa court to consider the totality of the circumstances”); State v. Smith, 849
N.W.2d 599, 606 (N.D. 2014) (holding that consent is not coerced because
refusing a chemical test is criminally punishable, but proceeding to an
examination of “the totality of the circumstances” to determinate whether
consent was voluntarily given). 
To reiterate, searches contended by the State to be consensual
under Hawai i law are subject to “the most careful scrutiny” because failure
to adhere to this standard “would sanction the possibility of . . . 
coercion.” Trainor, 83 Haw. at 262, 925 P.2d at 830. 
Hence, to the extent
that the foregoing cases from other jurisdictions did not find criminal
refusal sanctions inherently coercive, they are inconsistent with the right, 
under article I, section 7, to free, voluntary, and meaningful decision-making when waiver of constitutional rights is solicited, and they are in
derogation of such values embodied by Hawai i law as respect for human dignity
and the integrity of one’s person. See  Kaluna
 , 55 Haw. at 366, 371 & n.7, 
520 P.2d at 57, 60 & n.7; see also supra note 
35.

consent exception under both the Fourth Amendment and article I, 
section 7, which requires a case-specific inquiry into the 
totality of the circumstances to evaluate voluntariness. See 
Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 227; State v. Russo, 67 Haw. 126, 137, 
681 P.2d 553, 562 (1984); Ganal, 81 Hawaiʻ i at 368,  917 P.2d at 
380. This case-specific analytical framework underlying consent 
means that mere compliance with the dictates of the implied 
consent statute does not necessarily, much less automatically, 
equate to a finding of actual, voluntary consent under HRS § 
291E-11(b). Williams, 771 S.E.2d at 377. Beyond mere statutory 
compliance, it is clear that an approach that accounts for the 
totality of the circumstances is invariably required to 
determine the voluntariness and validity of consent. Cf. State 
v. Wulff, 337 P.3d at 581 (Idaho 2014) (concluding that “irrevocable implied consent operat[ing] as a per se rule . . . 
cannot fit under the consent exception because it does not 
always analyze the voluntariness of that consent”). 
V. Conclusion 
In this case, Won sought to suppress evidence 
recovered in a warrantless search. 
The State has not contested 
that the search was warrantless, but argued, inter alia, that it 
was nonetheless consensual. However, the State has not met its 
burden to demonstrate that Won’s consent to be searched and the 
-61 ­ 
 
 
    
                     
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
waiver of his constitutional right to be free of warrantless 
searches was the product of his free and unconstrained choice. 
Under article I, section 7 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution, 
where no “specifically established and well-delineated 
exception[]” is present, a warrantless search is per se 
unreasonable, and any results of that search must be excluded 
from evidence. Ganal, 81 Hawaiʻ i at 368, 917 P.2d at 380.  Here, 
because voluntary consent has not been demonstrated and no other 
exception to the warrant requirement is applicable, the result 
of Won’s breath test, the product of the warrantless search, is 
not admissible into evidence.48 
48 Won additionally argued to the ICA and later to this Court that
he should have been informed of his rights under Miranda before the Implied 
Consent Form was read to him, that he was denied his right to an attorney in
violation of HRS § 803- 9 and that the Implied Consent Form misinformed him of 
the sanctions for refusing to consent to a breath, blood, or urine test.  In 
light of our disposition in this case, we do not address these arguments or
that portion of the decision of the ICA addressing these arguments.

Based on the foregoing analysis, the district court 
erred in not suppressing the result of Won’s breath test. The 
judgment on appeal of the ICA and the district court’s amended 
judgment of conviction are vacated, and the case is remanded to 
the district court for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion.49

generally have the authority to determine the retroactivity of their own
decisions.” Garcia, 96 Hawaiʻ i at 211, 29 P.3d at 930. This is the first 
time that we announce the constitutional principle that the threat of
criminal sanctions inherently precludes a finding of voluntariness in the
context of the consent exception to the warrant requirement. As such, this
decision applies only to this case and to all cases pending on direct appeal
or not yet final at the time that this decision is rendered. By final, wemean those cases in which the judgment of conviction has been rendered and 
the availability of appeal and certiorari has elapsed. Id. at 214, 29 P.3d
