(Haw. Terr. 1939), we held that a personal property mortgagee 
seeking to enforce a non-judicial foreclosure sale bears the 
burden of establishing that the sale was conducted in a manner 
that is fair, reasonably diligent, and in good faith and that an 
adequate price was procured for the property. In the years ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J. 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
                         
 1   Compare  Lima v. Deutsche Bank Nat’ l Trust Co. , 943 F. Supp. 2d 
1093 (D. Haw. 2013), with  Field v. Bank of Am. , N.A. (In re Gibbs), 522 B.R. 
282 (Bankr. D. Haw. 2014).  
 2   All references to  “non-judicial foreclosures ” in this opinion do 
not encompass non -judicial foreclosures conducted pursuant to Hawai i Revised 
Statutes (HRS) Chapter 667, Part II.  When referring to this  type of 
foreclosure, a specific statutory designation  is  included.   Similarly, the
use of “foreclosure statute” in this opinion, when not modified by a specificstatutory section, excludes HRS Chapter 667, Part II.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
after Ulrich was decided, the legislature made several 
amendments to the non-judicial foreclosure statute, and the 
viability of Ulrich in light of these amendments, as well as 
Ulrich’s applicability to real property non-judicial 
foreclosures, has recently been questioned, with federal courts 
in Hawai i reaching conflicting results.1    
We hold that the duties set forth in Ulrich remain 
viable law and are applicable to non-judicial foreclosures of 
real property mortgages.2 Additionally, in situations where a 
mortgagee acts as both the seller and the purchaser of the subject property at a non-judicial foreclosure sale, that 
mortgagee, or its quitclaim transferee or non-bona fide successor, bears the burden of proving compliance with the 
requirements of Ulrich. 
I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND/PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
A. The Underlying Mortgage and Related Proceedings 
In February 2007, Jun Matsuyoshi and others conveyed a 
residential property located in Līhuʻ e, Kauaʻ i (Property) by 
2
  
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
warranty deed to Leigh Matsuyoshi (Matsuyoshi). The following 
month, Matsuyoshi signed a mortgage on the Property (Mortgage) 
and a promissory note (Note) promising to pay $500,000 to Resmae 
Mortgage Corporation (Resmae) in return for a loan that 
Matsuyoshi had received. 
Resmae recorded the Mortgage with the Bureau of 
Conveyances (Bureau). The Mortgage listed Matsuyoshi as the 
borrower of $500,000, and it included an acceleration and power of sale clause, which provided, among other things, that 
Matsuyoshi would be given at least 30 days to cure a default of 
payment. 
In May 2008, Lester K.M. Leu (Leu), an attorney 
authorized to act on behalf of Resmae Liquidation Properties LLC 
(RLP), sent a Notice of Intent to Foreclose to Matsuyoshi 
(notice of default). The notice of default stated that 
Matsuyoshi’s loan was in default because scheduled payments had 
not been made since April 1, 2008, and that the amount due was $9,704.34. The notice of default stated further that Matsuyoshi 
must pay this amount by June 20, 2008, or the loan would be 
accelerated and the Property referred for foreclosure action. 
In August 2008, an assignment of the Mortgage from 
Resmae to RLP was recorded. Matsuyoshi was personally served 
with a Notice of Mortgagee’s Non-Judicial Foreclosure Under 
Power of Sale (Notice of Sale). The Notice of Sale stated that 
3
  
 
 
 
                          ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
RLP intended to sell the Property at an auction to be held in 
Honolulu on November 13, 2008. The Notice of Sale also stated 
that the Property would be sold “AS IS” and “WHERE IS.” 
Thereafter, the Property was auctioned off at a 
foreclosure sale in Honolulu. In the Mortgagee’s Affidavit of 
Foreclosure Under Power of Sale (Affidavit of Sale), Leu 
certified that in compliance with Hawai’ i Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§§ 667-5 through 667-103 and the Note and Mortgage, Mortgagee or 
its representative, or Affiant, conducted the public auction 
sale on November 13, 2008, “at the date, time, and place set 
forth in the Notice and under the conditions stated therein, and 
Affiant, or her representative, declared the Property sold to [RLP] for $416,900.20, which was the highest bid at said sale.” 
Leu stated that the default remained uncured at the time of 
sale. On November 17, 2008, the Affidavit of Sale was recorded 
in the Bureau. 
In January 2009, RLP executed a quitclaim deed, which 
was subsequently recorded, conveying the Property to itself. In 
July 2010, a quitclaim deed was executed by RLP conveying the Property to Kondaur Capital Corporation (Kondaur).
4 The 
3   HRS §§ 667- 5 to 667- 10 governed the process of foreclosure by 
power of sale (i.e., non- judicial foreclosure) and were within Part I of 
Chapter 667. HRS  §§ 667-5 to 667- 8 were repealed by the legislature in 2012.

quitclaim deed expressly stated that “[n]otwithstanding anything 
in this deed to the contrary, [RLP] makes no representations, 
warranties or promises regarding any claims by LEIGH MATSUYOSHI, 
her heirs, successors or assigns.” Kondaur recorded its 
quitclaim deed the following year, in February 2011. 
Thereafter, Kondaur gave Matsuyoshi notice to vacate; Matsuyoshi 
did not leave the Property. 
B. Kondaur’s Ejectment Action Against Matsuyoshi 
On June 5, 2012, Kondaur filed a complaint for 
possession of the Property against Matsuyoshi in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (circuit court). The complaint 
requested a judgment for immediate and exclusive possession of 
the Property and a writ of possession. The complaint stated 
that Kondaur had “acquired title and current ownership of the 
(. . . continued) 
for ONE AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($1.00) and other valuable
consideration paid by [Kondaur], the receipt of which ishereby acknowledged, [RLP] does hereby release, remise and
quitclaim unto [Kondaur], as TENANT IN SEVERALTY, his/her
heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns,
all of that certain real property described in Exhibit “A”
attached hereto and made a part hereof.  
Exhibit A to the quitclaim deed refers to  
[a]ll of that certain parcel of land situate at Kalapaki,
Lihue, District of Puna, Island and County of Kauai, State
of Hawaii, being LOT 148 of the “LIHUE TOWN ESTATES”, as
shown on File Plan Number 1408, filed in the Bureau ofConveyances of the State of Hawaii, and containing an area
of 6,000 square feet, more or less.  
Exhibit A further indicates Matsuyoshi  as the previous owner.   
5
  
 
 
 
   
                         
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Property through a Quitclaim Deed recorded on February 24, 
2011.” 
On June 27, 2012, Kondaur filed a Motion for Summary 
Judgment Against All Defendants on Complaint filed June 5, 2012 
(MSJ). Kondaur requested that the circuit court grant the MSJ 
and enter a Judgment for Possession of the Property for Kondaur 
and against Matsuyoshi, issue a Writ of Possession, enter the 
judgment as final, and set a time and date for a trial on damages. A declaration by Ann Pham (Pham) attached to the MSJ 
stated that she was an asset manager for Kondaur and a custodian 
of Kondaur’s records. Pham declared that according to regular 
business records maintained by Kondaur, Kondaur owned the 
Property pursuant to Kondaur’s quitclaim deed. Pham also 
declared that Kondaur had given Matsuyoshi notice to vacate, and 
Matsuyoshi “has so far continued to reside at the Property and 
has otherwise failed or refused to leave.” Also attached to the 
MSJ were several exhibits.
5 
5   Exhibit A was a certified copy of Kondaur’s quitclaim deed.  
Exhibit B was a certified  copy of RLP’s quitclaim deed.  
Exhibit C was a certified copy of the Mortgagee’s Affidavit of
Foreclosure Under Power of Sale. Exhibit C also included a copy of the deed
from Jun Matsuyoshi, et al., to Matsuyoshi; the Note; the Mortgage; the
Assignment of Mortgage and Note from Resmae to RLP; the notice of default;
the Notice of Sale; a list of parties “who have recorded encumbrances, liens,
and/or other claims against the Property or who have requested notice” and received the Notice of Sale; the returns and acknowledgments of service from
those parties listed; an Affidavit of Posting of the Notice of Sale on the
Property; an Affidavit of Publication of the Notice of Sale in the Honolulu
(continued . . .)

                                                                                ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In its memorandum in support of the MSJ, Kondaur 
asserted that it had undisputed title to the Property and that 
Matsuyoshi was residing on the Property as a trespasser. 
Kondaur argued that its quitclaim deed was prima facie evidence 
of the conveyance to it from RLP, and that, therefore, it was 
the owner of the Property and entitled to immediate and 
exclusive possession. 
Kondaur also contended that the Affidavit of Sale was 
evidence that the power of sale was duly executed. Kondaur maintained that the foreclosure sale extinguished Matsuyoshi’s 
interest in the Property and that RLP “subsequently conveyed the 
Property to Kondaur by virtue of the Quitclaim Deed dated July 
14, 2010.” 
Kondaur asserted that because Matsuyoshi failed to 
cure her default in payments prior to the sale, “she is without 
standing to contest the validity of the foreclosure conducted by 
[RLP] and the superior title to the Property subsequently acquired by Kondaur.” Kondaur concluded that Matsuyoshi had no 
interest in the Property, Matsuyoshi must vacate it immediately, 
and a judgment for possession and writ of ejectment should be 
issued.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
On July 6, 2012, Kondaur requested an entry of default 
against Matsuyoshi pursuant to Hawai i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) Rule 55(a) “for her failure to answer or otherwise 
respond” to Kondaur’s complaint. Default was entered by the 
clerk of the circuit court on the same day. 
On August 15, 2012, Matsuyoshi filed, through counsel, 
her opposition to the MSJ, which was later amended on August 21, 
2012. Matsuyoshi acknowledged that she “fell behind on her 
mortgage payments,” but she maintained that technical violations 
of HRS § 667-5 voided the foreclosure sale. Matsuyoshi argued 
“that all notices and acts required by the power contained in 
the [M]ortgage shall be complied with.” According to Matsuyoshi, RLP’s foreclosure against her was void because RLP 
did not comply with the notice requirement under the Mortgage 
and because the auction sale was conducted on O ahu rather than 
on Kaua
i, the county where the Property is located. Finally, 
Matsuyoshi noted that Kondaur stood in privity of contract with 
RLP based on the quitclaim deed that Kondaur received from RLP. 
In its reply, Kondaur contended that Matsuyoshi’s 
“failure . . . to establish by admissible evidence that the Note 
and Mortgage were not in default at the time of the non-judicial 
foreclosure is dispositive.” Kondaur maintained that Matsuyoshi 
8

  
 
 
 
  
                         
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
presented no admissible evidence showing that she did not 
receive notice of her default under the terms of the Mortgage. 
At the hearing on the MSJ,6 Matsuyoshi argued that the 
foreclosure sale violated the foreclosure statute because it was 
carried out on Oʻ ahu when the Property was on Kauaʻ i. Matsuyoshi 
contended that the sale on Oʻ ahu precluded her from exercising 
her right to redeem the Property. Matsuyoshi also emphasized 
that RLP “was the only bidder” at the foreclosure sale. 
Kondaur replied that, in 2008, “there was no 
prohibition in . . . [HRS] Chapter 667 . . . that prohibited a 
lender from doing a foreclosure sale [for a property located on 
Kauaʻi] on the island of Oahu.”  According to Kondaur, there was 
no prejudice because the purpose of a judicial sale is to get 
the highest price possible, and “the market on Oahu is obviously 
much bigger than the market on Kauai in terms of prospective 
purchasers.”7 
At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court 
granted Kondaur’s MSJ. On September 18, 2012, the circuit court 
6 The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided.  
7 In relation to this point, Matsuyoshi argued:  
And if Plaintiff’s argument is Oahu  has a bigger market, 
then why aren’t these foreclosure sales uniformly conducted
in Los Angeles? Why aren’t they conducted in New YorkCity? Why aren’t they conducted right next to the bank
that has the ability to pay for these large mortgages in
the first place and out bid [sic] each other?  
9
  
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
entered its “Order Granting [Kondaur’s] [MSJ]” (MSJ Order), 
which included an order for a writ of possession to issue. The 
circuit court also issued its judgment (MSJ Judgment). On 
September 20, 2012, the circuit court issued a writ of 
possession. 
After the MSJ Judgment was rendered, Matsuyoshi 
submitted a declaration averring that she was “absolutely 
positive that the [M]ortgage . . . was not signed by [her] before a notary public” and that the notarization on the 
Mortgage is false. Further, Matsuyoshi claimed that the 
mortgage documents were not explained to her, nor was she given 
copies of the documents that she signed. Finally, Matsuyoshi 
declared that she did not sign the mortgage application and that 
the amounts listed as her income in the application are false. 
Matsuyoshi filed post-judgment motions, including a Motion to 
Set Aside the MSJ Judgment and a Motion to Set Aside Entry of 
Default pursuant to HRCP Rule 55(c). Matsuyoshi contended that the entry of default should be set aside because her post-
judgment declaration presented a meritorious defense to 
Kondaur’s action. The circuit court denied the Motion to Set 
Aside Entry of Default. 
Matsuyoshi timely filed a Notice of Appeal from the 
MSJ Judgment, but she did not appeal from the circuit court’s 
order denying her post-judgment motions.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
II. APPELLATE PROCEEDINGS 
A. Initial Disposition of the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
Matsuyoshi’s Opening Brief maintained that the circuit 
court erred in granting Kondaur’s MSJ. Matsuyoshi argued that 
where the mortgagee is also the purchaser of a foreclosed property, the mortgagee should be held to the strictest standard 
of good faith and diligence. Consistent with these 
requirements, Matsuyoshi reasoned that the mortgagee has a duty 
“to obtain for the [P]roperty as large a price as possible.” 
Matsuyoshi contended that “[t]he sale of property located on 
Kauaʻi at the front entrance to the First Circuit Courthouse did 
not show reasonable diligence and good faith in an endeavor to 
obtain the best possible prices [sic] consistent with such 
diligence and good faith.” 
In its Answering Brief, Kondaur argued that, because 
“Matsuyoshi never set aside the default that was entered against her,” she was “barred” from challenging Kondaur’s MSJ or 
defending the complaint. Kondaur recognized that Matsuyoshi did 
eventually file a motion to set aside the default, but argued 
that Matsuyoshi “failed to present any discernible argument to 
the [circuit court] that her default should be set aside” and 
that, therefore, the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) should 
not consider her untimely arguments. 
11
  
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Kondaur further contended that the circuit court 
properly granted its MSJ because it presented undisputed 
evidence of title to the Property and that Matsuyoshi was thus 
residing there unlawfully and without permission. Kondaur 
maintained that Matsuyoshi’s contention that the foreclosure 
sale was void because it occurred on Oʻ ahu must fail because at 
the time of the sale, Hawaii’s foreclosure statute did not prohibit the sale of the Property on Oʻ ahu, the power of sale 
contained in the Mortgage did not prohibit the lender from conducting the auction on Oʻ ahu, and “the decision to have the 
public auction on Oʻ ahu was consistent with the stated purposes 
of the . . . foreclosure statute.” Kondaur additionally contended that conducting the auction on Oʻ ahu was reasonable 
because Oʻ ahu was a larger market, Matsuyoshi failed to establish 
that she was prejudiced by the occurrence of the foreclosure 
sale on Oʻ ahu, and Matsuyoshi presented no evidence that she 
intended to or could have bid at the auction. 
In her Reply Brief, Matsuyoshi maintained that, 
regardless of the effect of the entry of default, “the MSJ 
should not have been granted because the material facts did not 
show that Kondaur was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Matsuyoshi argued that she was not bound by the recitations in 
Kondaur’s quitclaim deed because she was not a party to the 
12
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
                         
   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
conveyance. Further, Matsuyoshi contended that Kondaur’s 
quitclaim deed “establishes only that Kondaur obtained whatever 
interest, if any, that [RLP] . . . had in the [P]roperty.” 
Concerning the sale on Oʻ ahu, Matsuyoshi asserted that 
merely following the foreclosure statute was not sufficient and 
that the sale on Oʻ ahu was unreasonable.  Matsuyoshi argued that 
she did not need to demonstrate that she was prejudiced by the sale on Oʻ ahu and contended that this would be impossible to 
prove without a comparable sale occurring on Kauaʻ i. 
On March 7, 2014, the ICA issued its Memorandum 
Opinion (Opinion). The ICA concluded that because Matsuyoshi 
“raise[d] genuine issues as to the validity of the Mortgage” in 
her post-judgment declaration, summary judgment for Kondaur was erroneously granted. The ICA also held that as a consequence of 
the default, it could consider whether the factual allegations 
in Kondaur’s complaint were “well-pled,” and the ICA concluded 
that they were not. The ICA declined “to reach further issues 
raised by the parties,” vacated the MSJ Judgment, and remanded 
the case for proceedings consistent with its Opinion. 
Kondaur filed an application for writ of certiorari to 
this court on May 15, 2014, challenging the ICA’s decision.
8 
8 The following questions were presented: 
I. Whether the ICA erred by reversing the Circuit
Court’s decision to grant summary judgment in favor
(continued  . . .)  
13
  
 
 
 
  
                                                                               
 
 
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
This court granted certiorari, and in an opinion published on 
October 23, 2014, we held that the ICA erred in treating the 
entry of default as if it were a default judgment and then 
evaluating whether the allegations in the complaint were well­
pled. Kondaur Capital Corp. v. Matsuyoshi, 134 Hawaiʻ i 342, 351— 
52, 341 P.3d 548 (2014). 
This court additionally held that 
“[w]hen reviewing a summary judgment, an appellate court’s 
consideration of the record is limited to those materials that 
were considered by the trial court in ruling on the motion.” 
Id. at 350, 341 P.3d at 556. 
Because the ICA relied on “the 
post-judgment Matsuyoshi Declaration as a basis to find disputed material facts” that would preclude summary judgment, we concluded that the ICA erred, vacated the ICA’s Judgment on 
Appeal, and “remand[ed] the case to the ICA to consider the 
further issues that it ‘decline[d] to reach’ that were ‘raised 
by the parties’ on appeal.” Id. at 352, 341 P.3d at 558. 
B. The ICA’s Post-Remand Summary Disposition Order 
On November 19, 2014, the ICA issued its post-remand 
summary disposition order (SDO), which affirmed the MSJ Judgment. 
(. . . continued) 
of Petitioner based on evidence that was not a matter 
of record at the time the Circuit Court considered 
the motion. 
II.	 Whether on de novo review this Court should affirm 
the Circuit Court’s judgment granting a summaryjudgment in favor of Petitioner.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In particular, the ICA held that summary judgment in favor of 
Kondaur was properly granted, explaining that Kondaur met its 
initial burden of demonstrating a prima facie case of ejectment 
by submitting “admissible evidence of ownership and title to the 
[Property] in the form of exhibits attached to its MSJ, which 
included a certified copy of its quitclaim deed and Ann Pham’s 
affidavit.” 
The ICA rejected Matsuyoshi’s arguments concerning the 
alleged invalidity of Kondaur’s title as a result of the foreclosure sale being conducted in a different county than where 
the Property is located. The ICA reasoned that the applicable 
version of HRS § 667-5 did not require the “foreclosure sale be 
held in the county where the subject property is located, and 
nothing in the record indicates that the mortgagee failed to 
fulfill its duty to exercise reasonable diligence to secure the 
best price for the Property” “when it sold the Property for 
$416,900.20.”
9 
C. Matsuyoshi’s Application for Writ of Certiorari 
On April 6, 2015, Matsuyoshi filed an application for 
writ of certiorari seeking review of the ICA’s post-remand SDO. 
9 Matsuyoshi also raised to the ICA a second point of error on 
appeal—whether the circuit court erred in denying Matsuyoshi’s Motion to Set 
Aside the MSJ Judgment. The ICA held that it “lack[ed] jurisdiction to
address Matsuyoshi’s second error raised on appeal” “because Matsuyoshi did
not appeal the November 14, 2012 Post- Judgment Order denying her HRCP Rule 
60(b) Motion.” 
15
  
 
 
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Matsuyoshi argues that the ICA misapplied the summary judgment 
standard by requiring her to present evidence when Kondaur—the 
movant in this case—had failed to present a prima facie case 
establishing that the sale of the Property was valid. Relying 
on Ulrich and analogous authorities setting forth the common law 
governing fiduciaries and quasi-fiduciaries, Matsuyoshi argues that, because Kondaur has “the ultimate burden of proof both as 
a plaintiff and as the direct quitclaim privy of [RLP] who 
carried out the Oʻ ahu-Self-Sale,” it “was required to establish 
in its moving papers that the sale was properly and fairly 
conducted and that the price was adequate,” particularly when 
the mortgagee is self-dealing in a manner that creates an inherent conflict of interest. Applying this principle, 
Matsuyoshi contends that Kondaur failed to present any evidence 
that it acted diligently to secure the best price for the 
Property. 
Matsuyoshi additionally argues that even if Kondaur 
satisfied its initial burden, genuine issues of material fact 
existed as to whether RLP violated the foreclosure statute and its duties under the power of sale contained in the Mortgage. 
Matsuyoshi maintains that the auction sale conducted on O
ʻahu was 
itself evidence that RLP did not act diligently, “as potential 
bidders on Kauaʻ i necessarily would have had to purchase an 
airplane ticket and travel to Oʻ ahu for the sale, while potential 
16
  
 
 
 
  
  
                         
   
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
bidders on Oʻ ahu could not view the [P]roperty unless they 
traveled to Kauaʻ i.” According to Matsuyoshi, this dilemma was 
exacerbated by the fact that one of RLP’s sale terms was to 
convey the Property to the winning bidder “AS IS.”10 
In response, Kondaur argues that the ICA correctly 
affirmed the circuit court’s grant of its MSJ because Kondaur 
satisfied its initial burden to demonstrate a prima facie case of ejectment, while Matsuyoshi correspondingly failed to raise a 
genuine issue of material fact. Kondaur contends that requiring 
a third-party successor-in-interest such as Kondaur to establish 
a predecessor-in-interest’s reasonable diligence is tantamount 
to requiring such a successor-in-interest to disprove every 
possible defense to an ejectment action, which a summary 
judgment movant is not required to do. Further, Kondaur argues that Ulrich is consistent with the view that the mortgagor is 
the party who must introduce “credible evidence to support [his 
or] her alleged defense that the sale price at auction was 
10 Matsuyoshi also identifies technical defects that allegedly
voided RLP’s non- judicial foreclosure of the Property.  Matsuyoshi argues
that the notice of default that RLP sent did not comply with the notice 
requirements of the Mortgage and was therefore defective. Additionally,
Matsuyoshi contends that the Honolulu Star- Bulletin— the newspaper in which 
the notice of sale for the Property was published— was not a newspaper of 
general circulation in Kauaʻ i County in 2008, thus violating the publication
requirement of HRS § 667- 5(a)(1).  In light of our disposition of other
issues raised by Matsuyoshi, we do not address the asserted technical
defects. 
17
  
 
 
 
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
fraudulent”—a burden that Matsuyoshi failed to satisfy in this 
case. 
Finally, Kondaur argues that Matsuyoshi’s challenge to 
the venue of the non-judicial foreclosure auction is without 
merit because neither the applicable version of the foreclosure 
statute nor the power of sale contained in the Mortgage required 
the sale to be conducted in the same county as where the 
Property is located. 
Matsuyoshi asserts in her reply that assigning the 
burden to Kondaur of proving the validity of the non-judicial foreclosure sale is consistent with the burden-shifting approach 
employed in a summary judgment analysis, and that Kondaur is not 
being asked to disprove every possible defense that Matsuyoshi 
may have. Matsuyoshi maintains “that where the ejectment 
plaintiff is the mortgagee (or its non-bona fide purchaser 
transferee standing in its shoes),” this requirement “is not a 
‘defense’ at all, but rather an element of the plaintiff’s claim.” 
III. DISCUSSION 
A.	 Ulrich
 and the Division between Federal Courts in Hawai i as 
to Its Continued Vitality 
More than 70 years ago, in Ulrich v. Security 
Investment Co., 35 Haw. 158 (Haw. Terr. 1939), this court 
detailed legal principles governing the burden of proof in cases 
18

  
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
arising from foreclosure sales. At stake in Ulrich was the 
mortgagor’s interest in his law firm and chattels. 35 Haw. at 
159—60. Pursuant to the power of sale in the underlying 
mortgage, and after the mortgagor defaulted on the loan, the 
mortgagee commenced non-judicial foreclosure proceedings. Id. 
at 162—64. However, the mortgagee “kept the sale as quiet as possible,” did not give adequate personal or public notice to 
the mortgagor of the impending foreclosure, and acted both as the auctioneer and the purchaser during the auction. Id. at 
172, 174. In addition, the description of the property to be sold was such that it failed to “inform the public of the nature 
of the property to be offered for sale,” and prospective buyers 
were not afforded the opportunity to inspect the property. Id. 
at 173. 
This court held that a mortgagee is required to “use 
all fair and reasonable means in obtaining the best prices for the property on sale,” such that where “the sale [i]s not made in good faith, that the amount received upon the sale was 
inadequate and that the mortgagee took a wrongful and unfair 
advantage of the mortgagor, the foreclosure sale must be set 
aside.” Id. at 168. Further, this court declared that “where 
the mortgagee himself purchases at the sale, the burden is on him to show that the sale was regularly and fairly conducted in 
every particular, and that an adequate price was paid for the 
19
  
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
goods sold.” Id. (citation omitted) (internal quotation mark 
omitted). 
These requirements were promulgated by the court 
while fully recognizing that their application may sometimes 
mean obligating a mortgagee to act above and beyond the 
statutory requirements. See id. at 172—73 (recognizing that the 
foreclosure statute did not require that the foreclosure sale be publicized, but in any event finding that the mortgagee failed 
to act reasonably by failing to do so). 
Under the facts of Ulrich, the court ultimately 
determined that the mortgagee “failed to exercise reasonable diligence and good faith in an endeavor to obtain the best 
possible prices consistent with such diligence and good faith.” 
Id. at 170. 
Accordingly, the court vacated and set aside the 
foreclosure sale. Id. at 185—86. 
Ulrich has never been overruled by this court. 
But 
because HRS § 667-5 has been amended several times since Ulrich was decided in 1939, a federal district court has raised doubts as to the continued vitality of its holding. In Lima v. 
Deutsche Bank Nat’l Trust Co., 943 F. Supp. 2d 1093 (D. Haw. 
2013), the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaiʻ i ruled 
that Ulrich was not applicable to the facts of that case for two 
reasons: first, because Ulrich involved a chattel mortgage, 
while Lima involved a real property mortgage; and, second, 
because none of the principles laid out in Ulrich
 were included

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
by the Hawaiʻ i legislature in its amendment to HRS § 667-5 in 
2008.11 Id. at 1099-1100. Hence, although not directly so 
11 HRS § 667- 5 (Supp. 2008) provides as follows: 
(a) When a power of sale is contained in a mortgage, and
where the mortgagee, the mortgagee’s successor in interest,
or any person authorized by the power to act in thepremises, desires to foreclose under power of sale upon
breach of a condition of the mortgage, the mortgagee,
successor, or person shall be represented by an attorney
who is licensed to practice law in the State and is
physically located in the State. The attorney shall: 
(1) Give notice of the mortgagee’s, successor’s, or 
person’s intention to foreclose the mortgage and of 
the sale of the mortgaged property, by publication of the
notice once in each of three successive weeks (three
publications), the last publication to be not less thanfourteen days before the day of sale, in a newspaper
having a general circulation in the county in which the
mortgaged property lies; and 
(2) Give any notices and do all acts as are authorized or
required by the power contained in the mortgage. 
(b) Copies of the notice required under subsection (a)
shall be: 
(1) Filed with the state director of taxation; and 
(2) Posted on the premises not less than twenty- one days 
before the day of sale. 
(c) Upon the request of any person entitled to notice
pursuant to this section and sections 667- 5.5 and 667- 6, 
the attorney, the mortgagee, successor, or personrepresented by the attorney shall disclose to the requestor
the following information: 
(1) The amount to cure the default, together with the
estimated amount of the foreclosing mortgagee’sattorneys’ fees and costs, and all other fees and costs 
estimated to be incurred by the foreclosing mortgageerelated to the default prior to the auction within fivebusiness days of the request; and 
(2) The sale price of the mortgaged property once
auctioned. 
(continued . . .)

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
stating, the district court essentially held that Ulrich had 
been overruled by the legislature by virtue of its silence—by 
failing to expressly include any of Ulrich’s requirements in the 
language of HRS § 667-5.12 
On the other hand, in Field v. Bank of Am., N.A. (In 
re Gibbs), 522 B.R. 282 (Bankr. D. Haw. 2014), the Bankruptcy 
Court for the District of Hawai
ʻi disagreed with the Lima court, 
held that Ulrich continued to be good law, and applied its 
requirement that a mortgagee must use all fair and reasonable 
means to maximize the sale price of the property sold at a 
foreclosure sale. Id. at 289—91. The fact that Ulrich 
(. . . continued)
(d) Any sale, of which notice has been given as aforesaid,
may be postponed from time to time by public announcement
made by the mortgagee or by some person acting on the
mortgagee’s behalf. Upon request made by any person who is
entitled to notice pursuant to section 667- 5.5 or 667- 6, or 
this section, the mortgagee or person acting on the
mortgagee’s behalf shall provide the date and time of a
postponed auction, or if the auction is cancelled,
information that the auction was cancelled. The mortgagee
within thirty days after selling the property in pursuance
of the power, shall file a copy of the notice of sale andthe mortgagee’s affidavit, setting forth the mortgagee’s
acts in the premises fully and particularly, in the bureau
of conveyances. 
(e) The affidavit and copy of the notice shall be recorded 
and indexed by the registrar, in the manner provided inchapter 501 or 502, as the case may be. 
(f) This section is inapplicable if the mortgagee is foreclosing
as to personal property only. 
12 The Lima court judge held similarly in  Bald v. Wells Fargo Bank, 
Civil No. 13— 00135 SOM/KSC, 2013 WL 3864449 (D. Haw. July 25, 2013), appeal 
filed, No. 13- 16622, 2013 WL 3864449 (9th Cir. Aug. 12, 2013), which involved 
a self-dealing foreclosure sale of real property by the mortgagee.  Id. at

concerned a chattel mortgage instead of a real property mortgage 
was immaterial, according to the bankruptcy court, because the 
foreclosure statute in effect at that time did not expressly 
exclude from its provisions chattel mortgages.13 Id. at 290. 
Further, the bankruptcy court was unpersuaded by the reasoning of the district court in Lima concerning the legislative history 
of HRS § 667-5. 
In the bankruptcy court’s view, the legislature 
approved of the principles embodied by Ulrich because the 
subsequent amendments it made to HRS § 667-5 did not expressly 
overrule Ulrich
. Id. 
1. The Amendments to the Foreclosure Statute are Not 
Inconsistent with Ulrich 
At the time that Ulrich was decided, the statutory 
provisions governing non-judicial foreclosures were RLH §§ 4724­4728 (1935). Ulrich, 35 Haw. at 163.
14 Subsequent amendments to 
13 The bankruptcy court cited Chapter XXXIII of the Acts of 
1874 as the operative statute. In re Gibbs  , 522 B.R. at 290 n.24.  Although
the applicable statutory provisions were “sections 4724 to 4728, [Revised
Laws of Hawaiʻ i (RLH)] 1935,” Ulrich, 35 Haw. at 163,  the bankruptcy court’s
reasoning is equally supported under RLH §§ 4724- 4728 (1935), which also did 
not differentiate between chattel mortgages and real property mortgages. 
14 The relevant parts of RLH § 4724 (1935), the former version of
HRS § 667- 5, provided as follows: 
Sec. 4724. Notice of foreclosure; affidavit after
sale. When a power of sale is contained in a mortgage, the
mortgagee, or any person having his estate therein, or
authorized by such power to act in the premises, may, upon 
a breach of the condition, give notice of his intention to
foreclose the mortgage, by publication of such notice . . . . He shall, within thirty days after selling the property
in pursuance of the power, file a copy of the notice of
sale and his affidavit, setting forth his acts in the
(continued . . .) 
23
  
 
 
 
     
                                                                               
 
  
 
   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the foreclosure statute support the view that Ulrich remains 
viable law.15 After Ulrich was decided in 1939, RLH § 4724 was 
not amended until 1967, and that amendment concerned only a requirement that the affidavit and copy of the notice of the 
foreclosure sale be recorded and indexed. 
1967 Haw. Sess. Laws 
Act 256, § 1 at 383. Both the accompanying House Standing Committee Report and the Senate Standing Committee Report 
reflected that the purpose of the 1967 amendment was “to standardize the recording procedures in the Bureau of 
Conveyances,” and neither Ulrich nor its holding was 
referenced.
16 
A substantive amendment was effectuated in 1972, and 
it was at this time that HRS § 667-5 was made inapplicable to 
foreclosures of personal property mortgages. 1972 Haw. Sess. 
Laws Act 90, §9 at 362. The legislative history related to the 
1972 amendment did not touch upon Ulrich, and the committee 
reports stated only that the amendments were intended “to 
(. . . continued)
premises fully and particularly, in the bureau of
conveyances, in Honolulu. The affidavit and copy of the
notice shall be recorded by the registrar, with a notice ofreference thereto in the margin of the record of the
mortgage deed, if recorded in his office.   
15 Kondaur apparently does not contest Ulrich’s application to this 
case, and, therefore, the initial dispute concerns the correctness of the
ICA’s assignment between the parties of the burden of proving thesatisfaction of the Ulrich  requirements. 
16 H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 828, in 1967 House Journal, at 801; S.
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 450, in 1967 Senate Journal, at 1051.

eliminate inconsistencies with the rules of court; delete 
outmoded provisions; make improvements of a technical nature; 
and transfer procedural matters to rules of court.”17 The Report 
of Committee on Coordination of Rules and Statutes, referenced by the legislative reports accompanying the 1972 amendment,
18 
stated that the addition to HRS § 667-5 of the paragraph excluding personal property foreclosures from the foreclosure 
statute was meant “to clarify the relationship of this section to the Uniform Commercial Code, 490: 9-501(4).” Report of 
Committee on Coordination of Rules and Statutes Vol. 2, § 667-5 
(1971). Thus, the exclusion of personal property foreclosures 
was not precipitated by the decision in 
Ulrich, but instead it 
was intended to conform HRS § 667-5 to the law governing secured transactions of personal property. 
The 1984 amendment also did not affect the substance 
of HRS § 667-5, as it functioned only to authorize the revisor 
of statutes to “change statutory language by removing gender-specific terminology without altering the sense, meaning, or 
effect of any act,” whenever the revisor supplements or replaces

volumes of the HRS.19 The 1989 amendment merely added a 
requirement that copies of foreclosure sale notices should be 
filed with the state director of taxation. 1989 Haw. Sess. Laws 
Act 20, § 5 at 56—57. Again, the underlying legislative history 
was silent about Ulrich and the requirements that it set forth.20 
The last amendment to HRS § 667-5 before its repeal 
was in 2008. 2008 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 138, § 1 at 370—71. That 
amendment expanded the protections it guaranteed mortgagors by, among other things, requiring mortgagees to retain an attorney 
who is licensed to practice and physically present in the State. 
Id. This requirement was meant to “ensure that interested 
parties have means to obtain information from a person with a local presence and the ability to provide useful information.”
21 
This rationale was echoed by the accompanying Senate Standing Committee Report and the House Standing Committee Report.
22 
Again, there was no indication that the principles set forth in Ulrich were to be nullified or modified.

   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The foregoing amendments do not indicate that the 
legislature explicitly or implicitly disapproved of Ulrich. If 
the legislature had sought to express disapproval of Ulrich, it 
could have fashioned, for example, a presumption of validity, 
conclusive or otherwise, in instances where a foreclosure sale 
is conducted in accordance with the foreclosure statute and the 
underlying mortgage, as the legislature did with regard to HRS § 
667-34 (Supp. 2008) (“[A]ny foreclosure sale held in accordance with this part shall be conclusively presumed to have been 
conducted in a legal, fair, and reasonable manner.”).
23 See, 
23 HRS § 667- 34 is encompassed by Part II of Chapter 667 of the HRS, 
which sets forth an alternative power of sale process with more exacting
standards, compliance with which would provide greater finality to a
mortgagee’s foreclosure sale. See HRS §§ 667- 21 to 667- 42 (Supp. 2008).  
Those standards include, under HRS § 667- 22 (Supp. 2008), a more detailed 
notice of intention to foreclose than that required by HRS § 667- 5.  
Additionally, HRS §§ 667- 25, 667- 29, 667- 30, and 667- 31 (Supp. 2008) specify 
requirements that a mortgagee must follow in conducting the foreclosure sale,including a requirement that the sale must be in the same county as where the
property is located, unless the parties consent upon a different- county sale.  
The alternative power of sale process requires the mortgagee to conduct two
open houses of the property before the foreclosure sale. HRS § 667- 26 (Supp. 
2008). A public notice with very detailed specifications is also requiredunder HRS § 667- 27 (Supp. 2008).  HRS § 667- 32 (Supp. 1998) requires the 
affidavit after public sale to contain particularized recitals and sets forth
a form that the mortgagee’s affidavit must substantially follow. These 
requirements, among others, do not appear in HRS §§ 667- 5 to 667- 10, under 
whose authority RLP’s foreclosure sale was conducted. 
The advantage to electing the alternative power of sale process
under Part II of Chapter 667 is that, once the affidavit after public sale
and the conveyance documents have been recorded, the mortgagor and other
claimants “
shall be forever barred of and from any and all right, title,
interest, and claims at law or in equity in and to the mortgaged property,”HRS § 667- 33(b)(2), an assurance that HRS 
§§ 667-5 to 667- 10 do not guarantee. Further, as already mentioned, a
conclusive presumption arises as to the legality, fairness, andreasonableness of the foreclosure sale conducted pursuant to the alternative
power of sale process. HRS § 667- 34.

e.g., Hawaiʻi Gov’t Employees Ass’n, AFSCME Local 152, AFL-CIO v. 
Lingle, 124 Hawaiʻ i 197, 203—04, 239 P.3d 1, 7—8 (2010) (finding 
that a previous ICA decision, with which the legislature 
disagreed, was overruled by a statutory amendment); Lee v. 
United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO, 125 Hawai
ʻi 317, 
322—23, 260 P.3d 1135, 1140—41 (App. 2011) (accord).24 Instead 
of prescribing a conclusive presumption or a provision of similar import, HRS § 667-8 (1993) states only that an affidavit 
averring that the non-judicial foreclosure “has in all respects complied with the requirements of the power of sale and the 
statute . . . shall be 
admitted as evidence  that the power of 
sale was duly executed.” (Emphasis added).25 Hence, there is no 
24 These two cases involved a previous decision by the ICA that the
Hawaiʻi Labor Relations Board (HLRB) and the circuit courts had concurrent
jurisdiction over complaints arising under previous versions of HRS sections
89-14 and 377- 9.  Lee
, 125 Hawaiʻ i at 322.  The subsequent statutory amendment
explicitly conferred HLRB with exclusive original jurisdiction over such
complaints, which this court viewed as an express overruling by the
legislature of the ICA’s previous decision. Lingle, 124 Hawaiʻ i at 203- 04.  
25 This provision dates back to the inception of the foreclosure
statute in 1874, when its language read: 
If it appears by such affidavit that he has in all respects
complied with the requisitions of the power 
of sale, in relation to all things to be done by him before 
selling the property, and has sold the same in the manner
required by such power, the affidavit, or a duly certified
office copy of the record thereof, shall be admitted as
evidence that the power of sale was duly executed.  
1874 Haw. Sess. Laws Act XXXIII, § 2, at 31. 
This language was not
significantly modified by post- Ulrich amendments.  
See 1972 Haw. Sess. Laws 
Act 90, § 9(g), at 363 (setting forth the version of the statute that was 
valid until its repeal in 2012). 
28
  
 
 
 
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
indication that the legislature intended to overrule Ulrich, 
circumscribe its application, or otherwise modify its effect in 
the realm of non-judicial foreclosures. Cf. Lingle,
 124 Hawaiʻ i 
at 203—04, 239 P.3d at 7—8; Lee
, 125 Hawaiʻ i at 322—23, 260 P.3d 
at 1140—41. 
2. The Amendments to HRS § 667-5 Expanded the Rights of
Mortgagors, Further Buttressing Ulrich’s Vitality 
The amendments to HRS § 667-5, through 76 years of 
Ulrich’s existence, have added requirements that mortgagees must 
fulfill in order to accomplish a valid foreclosure sale. See, 
e.g., 1967 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 256, § 1 at 383 (requiring 
mortgagees to record and index the affidavit and copy of the 
notice of sale); 1989 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 20, § 5 at 56—57 
(requiring mortgagees to file copies of foreclosure sale notices 
with the state director of taxation). The benefits of some of these added statutory requirements, such as those derived from 
the 2008 amendments, were meant to accrue to mortgagors so as to 
expand and bolster the protections to which they are entitled. 
See 2008 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 138, § 1 at 370—71 (amending HRS § 
667-5 to require mortgagees to hire local attorneys who could  
facilitate a greater and more convenient transfer of information about foreclosure to mortgagors, and requiring mortgagees to 
disclose more particularized information upon a mortgagor’s 
request). 
29

  
 
 
Hence, it is inconsistent to assume that the 
legislature overruled Ulrich and the rights it promulgated at 
the same time as when the legislature expanded the rights of 
mortgagors.
 See In re Gibbs, 522 B.R. at 290 (holding that the 
increase in mortgagors’ rights effectuated by the 2008 amendment to HRS § 667-5 was consistent with the view that the legislature 
approved of Ulrich). The more logical conclusion, consistent 
with the expansion of the rights of mortgagors in the foreclosure statute, is that the legislature approved of Ulrich 
and supplemented it with more robust statutory protections. See 
id. 
 
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
3. Ulrich is Applicable to Real Property Non-Judicial
Foreclosures 
When Ulrich
 was decided, the version of the 
foreclosure statute then existing was contained in RLH §§ 4724— 
4728. RLH § 4724, the 1935 counterpart of HRS § 667—5, was 
applicable to all mortgage foreclosure sales regardless of 
whether the subject matter was real property or chattels. The exclusion of chattels from HRS § 667—5 was not effectuated until 
its 1972 amendment. 
See 1972 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 90, §9 at 362. 
Even then, there is no indication that the legislature excluded chattels from the application of HRS § 667—5 in order to 
circumscribe Ulrich’s application to chattels only. See Report 
of Committee on Coordination of Rules and Statutes Vol. 2, § 
30

  
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
667-5 (1971). The apparent rationale of the 1972 amendment was 
merely to conform HRS § 667-5 to UCC article 9, which governs 
secured transactions of personal property. See id. 
Ulrich similarly did not limit its holding to chattel 
mortgages, although the facts of that case involved chattels 
only. 
Restricting it would have been illogical, not only 
because the foreclosure statute involved in 
Ulrich
 did not 
differentiate between chattels and real property, RLH §§ 4724— 4728; 
see In re Gibbs , 522 B.R. at 290 (reasoning similarly), 
but also because Ulrich’s rationale applies with equivalent, if not greater, force in the foreclosure sale of real property. 
The motivation for the requirements set forth in 
Ulrich is to protect the mortgagor from being wrongfully and 
unfairly taken advantage of by the mortgagee, Ulrich, 35 Haw. at 168, and this purpose is not rendered irrelevant merely because 
the subject matter of a foreclosure sale is real property rather 
than chattels. To the contrary, where, as here, the property at issue is the primary residence of an individual, the rationale 
underlying Ulrich’s requirements is only strengthened. 
Cf. 
Ulrich, 35 Haw. at 159—60 n.1 (concerning the foreclosure sale 
of office property, interest in law practice, share in earned 
attorneys’ fees, and household belongings). 
Thus, reasoning 
that Ulrich
’s application is confined to only chattel mortgages, 
31
  
 
 
 
  
                         
  
  
  
  
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
see, e.g., Lima, 943 F. Supp. 2d at 1099, is not analytically 
persuasive. 
4. The Duties of Mortgagees under Ulrich 
To summarize, Ulrich requires mortgagees to exercise 
their right to non-judicial foreclosure under a power of sale in a manner that is fair, reasonably diligent, and in good faith, 
and to demonstrate that an adequate price was procured for the 
property.
26 Ulrich, 35 Haw. at 168. In instances where the 
mortgagee assumes the role of a purchaser in a self-dealing transaction, the burden is on the mortgagee, or its quitclaim 
transferee or non-bona fide successor,
27 to establish its 
compliance with these obligations. Id. Its failure to do so 
would render the foreclosure sale voidable and could therefore 
be set aside at the timely election of the mortgagor. See id. 
26 A more generalized articulation of these duties may be found in
Silva v. Lopez, 5 Haw. 262 (Haw. Kingdom 1884), which states “that the law 
requires the mortgagee, in the exercise of his power, to use discretion in an 
intelligent and reasonable manner, not to oppress the debtor or to sacrifice
his estate.” Id. at 265. 
27 A non-bona fide purchaser is one who does not pay adequate 
consideration, “takes with knowledge that his transferor acquired title byfraud[,] or . . . buys registered land with full notice of the fact that it
is in litigation between the transferor and a third party.” Akagi v. Oshita, 
33 Haw. 343, 347 (1935); Achiles v. Cajigal, 39 Haw. 493, 499 (1952); see generally
 92A C.J.S. Vendor and Purchaser  § 547 (2010) (defining a bona fide 
purchaser as “one who acquires an interest in a property for valuable 
consideration, in good faith, and without notice of any outstanding claimswhich are held against the property by third parties”).

B. Summary Judgment in Favor of Kondaur was Erroneously 
Granted 
1.  Summary Judgment and the Elements of Ejectment 
Under settled law, “[t]his court reviews a circuit 
court’s grant or denial of summary judgment de novo.” Price v. 
AIG Hawaiʻ i Ins. Co.
, 107 Hawaiʻ i 106, 110, 111 P.3d 1, 5 (2005); 
see Thomas v. Kidani
, 126 Hawaiʻ i 125, 128, 267 P.3d 1230, 1233 
(2011). “[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, 
together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no 
genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party 
is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Price, 107 Hawaiʻ i 
at 110 (quoting Haw. Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Keka, 94 Hawaiʻ i 
213, 221, 11 P.3d 1, 9 (2000)). Further, all evidence and 
inferences therefrom “must be viewed in the light most favorable 
to the non-moving party.” Id. (quoting Keka, 94 Hawaiʻ i at 221, 
11 P.3d at 9). 
The moving party has the initial burden of 
“demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.” 
Exotics Hawaii-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co.
, 116 
Hawaiʻi 277, 301, 172 P.3d 1021, 1045 (2007) (emphasis omitted) 
(quoting Young v. Planning Comm’n of the Cnty. of Kauaʻ i, 89 
Hawaiʻi 400, 407, 974 P.2d 40, 47 (1999)).  This burden may be 
discharged “by demonstrating that . . . if the case went to 
33

  
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
trial[,] there would be no competent evidence to support a 
judgment for his or her opponent.” Id. (alteration in original) 
(quoting Young, 89 Hawaiʻ i at 407, 974 P.2d at 47).  Only with 
the satisfaction of this initial showing does the burden shift 
to the nonmoving party to respond “by affidavits or as otherwise 
provided in HRCP Rule 56[,] . . . set[ting] forth specific facts 
showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.” Id. (quoting 
Young, 89 Hawaiʻ i at 407, 974 P.2d at 47).   
In order to maintain an ejectment action, the 
plaintiff “must necessarily prove that [he or she] owns the parcel[] in issue,” 
State v. Magoon , 75 Haw. 164, 175, 858 P.2d 
712, 718—19 (1993); see State v. Midkiff, 49 Haw. 456, 460, 421 P.2d 550, 554 (1966), meaning that he or she must have “the 
title to and right of possession of” such parcel, Carter v. Kaikainahaole, 14 Haw. 515, 516 (Haw. Terr. 1902). 
Additionally, the plaintiff must establish that “possession is 
unlawfully withheld by another.” 
Id. In this case, Kondaur 
submitted a certified copy of its quitclaim deed from RLP as part of its MSJ. 
The quitclaim deed recited that RLP conveyed 
the Property to Kondaur but made “no representations, warranties 
or promises regarding any claims by LEIGH MATSUYOSHI, her heirs, 
successors or assigns.” The certified copy of the quitclaim 
deed and all of its attachments suffice to establish only that Kondaur has an ownership interest in and right of possession of 
34

  
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the Property, subject to Matsuyoshi’s title and ownership 
interest in the same Property. This conditional status of 
Kondaur’s title originates from the language of Kondaur’s 
quitclaim deed, which specifically carves out from Kondaur’s 
interest any claims that Matsuyoshi may still have on the 
Property. It is therefore clear from the language of the deed 
that it does not convey a title superior to that of Matsuyoshi’s 
title and interest because it goes so far as acknowledging that Matsuyoshi may have some ownership claim on the Property. 
Moreover, the very nature of a quitclaim deed also 
circumscribes the interest that Kondaur could have in the 
Property. Because a quitclaim deed is capable of conveying only 
that which the predecessor-in-interest already possessed in the 
first place, Kondaur has whatever rights RLP had on the 
Property, and the quitclaim deed in no way indicates that 
Kondaur has an absolute and unassailable interest in the 
Property. See 
 Hustace v. Kapuni, 6 Haw. App. 241, 245, 718 P.2d 
1109, 1112 (1986) (stating that the grantee “acquired whatever 
interest the [grantors] may have had in the property”); 
see also
 
Hagan v. Gardner,  283 F.2d 643, 646 (9th Cir. 1960) (stating 
that a quitclaim deed “operates to transfer only what right, 
title and interest the grantor may have”). 
Thus, Kondaur’s title to and interest in the Property 
depends on whether RLP actually had valid title and interest in 
35
  
 
 
 
  
                         
   
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the Property to convey. Because the title to the Property 
deeded by RLP to Kondaur derives from a non-judicial foreclosure 
sale of the Property, the strength and validity of Kondaur’s 
title is unavoidably intertwined with the validity of the 
foreclosure sale. See Lee v. HSBC Bank USA,
 121 Hawaiʻ i 287, 
292, 218 P.3d 775, 780 (2009) (holding that an agreement created 
at a defective and invalid foreclosure sale is void and 
unenforceable and that, in such a case, the purchaser is 
“entitled only to return of his or her downpayment plus accrued 
interest”). It therefore became incumbent upon Kondaur to 
demonstrate that the foreclosure sale was conducted in 
accordance with Ulrich to prove that its quitclaim deed is valid 
and superior to any claims that Matsuyoshi may have on the 
Property.28   
2. Kondaur Failed to Satisfy its Initial Burden 
Kondaur’s quitclaim deed carries with it all of the 
infirmities that the prior non-judicial foreclosure might have occasioned upon the deed. 
Hustace, 6 Haw. App. at 245, 718 P.2d 
at 1112; Hagan, 283 F.2d at 646. Pursuant to the principles 
embodied by Ulrich, RLP’s self-dealing of the Property triggered 
28 Similarly, because a non- bona fide purchaser does not take title 
free and clear of all interests, see 92A C.J.S., supra, § 547, that 
purchaser, in order to enforce its interest and defeat a mortgagor’s claim,
would have to prove that the mortgagee- transferor complied with the 
requirements of 
Ulrich. 
36
  
 
 
 
  
                         
    
 
   
 
   
   See  
Ulrich,
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
its burden to prove in the summary judgment proceeding that the 
foreclosure “sale was regularly and fairly conducted in every 
particular.” Ulrich, 35 Haw. at 168. This burden was 
transferred to Kondaur by virtue of its quitclaim deed, the validity of which, vis-à-vis Matsuyoshi’s interest in the 
Property, is dependent on the validity of the foreclosure sale. 
Accordingly, Kondaur, as a quitclaim transferee of a 
self-dealing mortgagee (i.e., RLP), was required under Ulrich to introduce evidence that RLP exercised its right to non-judicial 
foreclosure under a power of sale in a manner that was fair, 
reasonably diligent, and in good faith, and to demonstrate that 
an adequate price was procured for the Property. Ulrich, 35 
Haw. at 168.
29 A prima facie case demonstrating compliance with 
the foregoing requirements would have shifted the burden to 
Matsuyoshi to raise a genuine issue of material fact. 
29 Compliance with the Ulrich  requirements is an ingredient of a 
valid non
-judicial foreclosure. In turn, a quitclaim deed derived from a 
valid non- judicial foreclosure would divest the mortgagor of all ownership 
claims to a disputed property. See  Cooper v. Island Realty Co., 16 Haw. 92, 
103 (Haw. Terr. 1904) (stating that foreclosure of a mortgage extinguishes
the equity of redemption and the legal estate held by the mortgagor); 74
C.J.S. Quieting Title § 35 (2010) (“Foreclosure of the mortgage divests the 
mortgagor . . . of title or interest in the property covered by the
mortgage.”). 
Conversely, if the Ulrich requirements were not satisfied, a 
quitclaim deed would convey 
only a voidable interest in the property. 
 35 Haw. at 168 (reasoning that an unfair mortgage foreclosure sale 
was voidable at the timely election of the mortgagor); cf.  Lee, 121 Hawaiʻ i at 
292, 218 P.3d at 780 (concluding that “an agreement created at a foreclosure
sale . . . is void and unenforceable where the foreclosure sale is invalid 
under the statute”).

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The only evidence produced by Kondaur with respect to 
the manner in which the sale was conducted was derived from 
RLP’s Affidavit of Sale prepared by Leu, RLP’s attorney. The 
Affidavit of Sale merely “certifies that in compliance with and 
pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes 667-5 through 667-10 and 
th[e] . . . Mortgage, Mortgagees or its representative, or 
Affiant or her representative” conducted the non-judicial 
foreclosure sale in compliance with all statutory requirements and the terms of the Mortgage.
30 But the Affidavit of Sale fails 
to provide any averments as to the fairness and regularity of the foreclosure sale or as to whether RLP conducted the 
30 HRS § 667- 7 (Supp. 2008) provides: 
(a) The notice of intention of foreclosure shall contain: 
(1) A description of the mortgaged property; and 
(2) A statement of the time and place proposed for the
sale thereof at any time after the expiration of four
weeks from the date when first advertised. 
(b) The affidavit described under section 667- 5 may 
lawfully be made by any person duly authorized to act forthe mortgagee, and in such capacity conducting the
foreclosure. 
HRS § 667- 9 (1993) states: 
If the mortgage was executed by a man having at the time no
lawful wife, or if the mortgagor being married, his wife
joined in the deed in token of her release of dower, the
sale of the property in the mode aforesaid shall be
effectual to bar all claim and possibility of dower in the
property. 
The full text of HRS § 667- 5 (Supp. 2008) is stated in note 
11, and the relevant portion of HRS § 667- 8 (1993) can be found on 
pages 28 and 39-40.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
foreclosure sale in a diligent and reasonable manner.31 This 
document does not even speak of any reason as to why the 
foreclosure sale was conducted on Oʻ ahu when the Property is on 
Kauaʻi.32 Although the Affidavit of Sale states that the Property 
was sold for $416,900.20 at the foreclosure sale, it does not 
make any declaration concerning the adequacy of this price.33 
While HRS § 667-8 at that time provided that an 
affidavit averring that the non-judicial foreclosure “has in all respects complied with the requirements of the power of sale and 
31 The foreclosure statute required mortgagees to file in the Bureau
“the mortgagee’s affidavit, setting forth the mortgagee’s acts in the
premises fully and particularly.”  HRS § 667- 5(d) (emphasis added). 
32 Kondaur asserted in the circuit court and the ICA that 
“conducting the public sale on the island of Oahu [made it possible for] theforeclosing mortgagee . . . to conduct the sale in a larger market with more
prospective purchasers.” This assertion fails to establish that the 
foreclosure sale satisfied the requirements of Ulrich, not only because it is 
conclusory but also because evidence substantiating this assertion was not
submitted in support of the MSJ. See  Thomas v. Kidani
, 126 Hawaiʻ i 125, 132—
33, 267 P.3d 1230, 1237— 38 (2011) (conclusory assertions as to essential 
elements are insufficient to satisfy summary judgment burden); Exotics 
Hawaii-Kona, Inc., 116 Hawaiʻ i at 316 n.4, 172 P.3d at 1060 n.4 (stating that 
a conclusion must be supported by a “factual basis and the process of
reasoning which makes the conclusion viable” (internal quotation mark and 
emphasis omitted) (quoting Hayes v. Douglas Dynamics, Inc., 8 F.3d 88, 92 
(1st Cir. 1993)); Kondaur Capital Corp. v. Matsuyoshi, 134 Hawai i 342, 352,
341 P.3d 548, 558 (2014) (consideration of a circuit court’s summary judgment
award is limited to evidence presented to and considered by the circuit
court). 
In any event, because the Property is located on Kauaʻ i and the 
terms of the sale included a clause requiring the buyer to take the Property
“AS IS” and “WHERE IS,” it is at least a question of fact whether the
foreclosure sale actually benefited from the larger pool of potential real
estate buyers on Oah
ʻu. The record simply is insufficient to prove or
disprove the advantages or disadvantages of selling an “as is” residential 
property on a different island. 
33 A 2008 tax assessment of the Property placed its total net value
at $473,000.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the statute . . . shall be admitted as evidence that the power 
of sale was duly executed,” the Ulrich requirements are not 
statutorily or contractually based. Instead, they are separate 
and distinct from the requirements of the foreclosure statute 
and the operative mortgage. See Ulrich, 35 Haw. at 172—73 
(recognizing that the foreclosure statute did not require that the foreclosure sale be publicized, but in any event finding 
that the mortgagee failed to act reasonably by failing to do so). Hence, a mortgagee’s minimal adherence to the statutory 
requirements and the terms of the mortgage under which the 
foreclosure sale is conducted—the only facts that RLP’s 
Affidavit of Sale supports—does not establish that the 
foreclosure sale similarly satisfied the Ulrich requirements.
34   
See id. 
34 For example, the fact that HRS § 667-5 does not contain a 
requirement that a foreclosure sale must be conducted in the same county as 
where the Property is located does not automatically mean that a self- dealing 
mortgagee may always conduct a different- county sale.  While a different-
county sale does not violate HRS § 667- 5, it does not mean that such a sale 
will similarly be valid under Ulrich, which sets forth duties independent of 
those imposed by the statute. The Ulrich requirements, depending on the 
circumstances of a particular property and the foreclosure sale, could 
necessitate a foreclosure sale to be held in the county in which the propertyis located. Hence, a different- county sale may or may not comport with 
Ulrich  depending on, among other things, the type, value, and location of the 
property; sale or auction conditions (e.g., clause stating that the sale is 
“as is,” “where is,” etc.); amount and type of notification to the mortgagor;
and amount and type of publicity regarding the sale. Thus, we rejectKondaur’s assertion that it was not required to conduct the foreclosure sale
in the same county as where the Property is located because HRS § 667- 5 did 
not contain such a requirement. 
40
  
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Since Kondaur failed to satisfy its initial burden of 
showing that RLP conducted the foreclosure sale in a manner that 
was fair, reasonably diligent, in good faith, and would obtain 
an adequate price for the Property, the burden never shifted to 
Matsuyoshi and summary judgment was erroneously granted. See 
Morinoue v. Roy, 86 Hawaiʻ i 76, 81, 947 P.2d 944, 949 (1997) 
(vacating grant of summary judgment because movant failed to 
establish prima facie case of adverse possession). As a result, 
Matsuyoshi did not have to raise any genuine issue of material 
fact and, contrary to Kondaur’s argument, was not preliminarily 
obligated to establish that she suffered actual prejudice from 
the foreclosure sale being conducted on Oʻ ahu rather than on 
Kauaʻi. 
Kondaur maintains that bearing the burden of proving 
compliance with Ulrich is tantamount “to disprov[ing] every 
possible 
defense that may or may not be raised by the opposing 
party . . . [to] a non-judicial foreclosure sale”—a task that a summary judgment movant is not required to discharge. We disagree. The Ulrich requirements are not meant to serve as a 
mortgagor’s defense against a self-dealing mortgagee or, as 
here, that mortgagee’s quitclaim transferee, but the 
requirements were crafted to serve as affirmative obligations 
that mortgagees must fulfill when utilizing the process of non­
judicial foreclosure. See Ulrich, 35 Haw. at 168 (requiring the 
41

  
 
 
 
  
                         
   
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
mortgagee to affirmatively act in a manner that is not wrongful 
and unfair to the mortgagor, and assigning the burden to the 
self-dealing mortgagee to prove compliance with this 
requirement). Here, since a prima facie case of ejectment 
requires Kondaur to prove ownership of the subject property, see 
Magoon, 75 Haw. at 175, 858 P.2d at 718—19; Midkiff, 49 Haw. at 
460, 421 P.2d at 554, and Kondaur’s ownership depends on the 
validity of RLP’s self-dealing foreclosure sale, RLP’s adherence to the 
Ulrich requirements is merely an element of, and not a 
defense to, Kondaur’s ejectment action. Therefore, the burden of proving compliance with the Ulrich requirements is properly 
assigned to Kondaur, the quitclaim transferee of RLP. Further, 
as already discussed, HRS §§ 667-5 to 667-10 do not provide a 
conclusive presumption as to the validity of a foreclosure sale 
once it has been proven that the mortgagee complied with the 
mortgage terms and the statute. Cf. HRS § 667-34. The absence 
of such a conclusive presumption is consistent with requiring a 
self-dealing mortgagee, or its quitclaim transferee or non-bona 
fide successor, to prove compliance with Ulrich.
35 
35 It also bears noting that it would be unduly onerous to require a
mortgagor to prove that the self- dealing mortgagee disregarded  Ulrich’s 
requirements since, as a practical matter, the facts that bear upon the
conduct of the foreclosure sale are most likely in the possession and
knowledge of the self- dealing mortgagee, or its quitclaim transferee or non-
bona fide successor, not the mortgagor.
