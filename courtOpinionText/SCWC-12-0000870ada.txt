            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.
 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant, Patsy Naomi Sakuma 
(“Sakuma”) seeks review of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ 
January 11, 2013 order dismissing Sakuma’s appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
Sakuma appealed from the Circuit Court 
of the First Circuit’s May 29, 2012 judgment on the order confirming the sale of a foreclosed property. The Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) dismissed the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction because it determined that Sakuma’s appeal 
was untimely under Rule 4(a)(1) and 4(a)(3) of the Hawai' i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure (“HRAP”).
 
For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the ICA
 
had jurisdiction. Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s dismissal
 
order and remand to the ICA for further proceedings consistent
 with this opinion. 
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
 
In 2007, the Association of Condominium Homeowners of
 
Tropics at Waikele (“AOAO”) commenced a judicial foreclosure on
 Sakuma’s condominium unit after she failed to pay her maintenance
 fees and other association dues. On June 10, 2008, the Circuit
 Court of the First Circuit (“circuit court”) entered a default

        *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
judgment and foreclosure decree.1 The circuit court confirmed
 
the sale to a third-party bidder on August 31, 2010. The winning
 
bidder subsequently withdrew his offer due to a delay in closing. 
The circuit court permitted the auction to be reopened and
 confirmed the sale to a new third-party purchaser by order and
 judgment entered on May 29, 2012.

On June 7, 2012, Sakuma timely filed a Hawai' i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (“HRCP”) Rule 59 motion for reconsideration on the May 29, 2012 order and judgment confirming the foreclosure sale. The circuit court did not rule on the motion within ninety days. On October 16, 2012, Sakuma appealed the May 29, 2012 judgment. 
On January 11, 2013, the ICA dismissed Sakuma’s appeal
 
for lack of jurisdiction because it determined that her appeal
 was untimely under HRAP Rules 4(a)(1) and 4(a)(3). According to
 the ICA, Sakuma failed to timely appeal following the deemed
 denial of a post-judgment tolling motion. The circuit court did
 not issue a decision on Sakuma’s motion for reconsideration
 within ninety days. As a result, the motion was automatically

deemed denied under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) on September 5, 2012. The
 
ICA determined that HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) required Sakuma to file her
 notice of appeal by October 5, 2012, thirty days after the deemed
 denial of her motion; she filed her appeal on October 16, 2012,
 which it deemed untimely. 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Jurisdiction 
“The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law 
that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard.” State v. 
Bohannon, 102 Hawai' i 228, 232, 74 P.3d 980, 984 (2003) (quoting 
Amantiad v. Odum, 90 Hawai' i 152, 158, 977 P.2d 160, 166 (1999)) 
(internal citation and quotation marks omitted). B. Interpretation of Court Rules
 
“The interpretation of a rule promulgated by the courts 
involves principles of statutory construction.” Cresencia v. 
Kim, 85 Hawai' i 334, 335-36, 944 P.2d 1277, 1278-79 (1997) 
(citing Price v. Obayashi Hawaii Corp.,  81 Hawai' i 171, 176, 914 
P.2d 1364, 1369 (1996)). “[T]he interpretation of a statute . . . 
is a question of law reviewable de novo.” Bohannon, 102 Hawai' i 
at 232, 74 P.3d at 984 (2003) (citations omitted).

Under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), a timely post-judgment motion
 
tolls the time to file a notice of appeal until thirty days after
 
the entry of an order disposing of the motion. When Sakuma filed
 her June 7, 2012 motion for reconsideration within ten days after
 entry of the May 29, 2012 judgment, she extended the thirty-day
 time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) for filing a notice of
 appeal. Pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3), the deadline was extended
 until thirty days after 
entry of an order disposing of the
 
motion. 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
III. DISCUSSION
 
The time for filing a notice of appeal is governed by
 
HRAP Rule 4 (as amended in 2012), which provides in relevant
 part: 
(a) Appeals in Civil Cases.
(1) W
hen a civil appeal is permitted by law, the notice of
appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the
judgment or appealable order.
 
. . .
 
(
3) If any party files a timely motion for judgment as a
matter of law, to amend findings or make additional
findings, for a new trial, to reconsider, alter or amend the
judgment or order, or for attorney’s fees or costs, the time
for filing the notice of appeal is extended until 30 days
after entry of an order disposing of the motion; provided,
that the failure to dispose of any motion by order entered
upon the record within 90 days after the date the motion was
filed shall constitute a denial of the motion.
 
(emphasis added).

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The ICA determined that Sakuma’s appeal was untimely
 
because she did not file the notice of appeal within thirty days
 
after her motion for reconsideration was deemed denied. However,
 HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) requires an entry of an order to trigger the
 thirty-day appeal period in HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). 
“The fundamental starting point for statutory
 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.” Awakuni
 
v. Awana, 115 Hawai' i 126, 133, 165 P.3d 1027, 1034 (2007) 
(citation omitted). “[C]ourts are bound to give effect to all parts of a statute, and that no clause, sentence, or word shall be construed as superfluous, void, or insignificant if a construction can be legitimately found which will give force to and preserve all words of the statute.” Keliipuleole v. Wilson, 
85 Hawai' i 217, 221, 941 P.2d 300, 304 (1997) (citations 
omitted). In defining “entry of judgment or order,” HRAP Rule 4(a)(5) clearly states, “a judgment or order is entered when it
 is filed in the office of the clerk of the court.” The deadline
 to file Sakuma’s appeal was suspended until such entry was made.
 
Therefore, we hold that when a timely post-judgment
 
tolling motion is deemed denied, it does not trigger the thirty-
day deadline for filing a notice of appeal until entry of the

*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
judgment or appealable order pursuant to HRAP Rules 4(a)(1) and
 
4(a)(3). 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the ICA’s January 11,
 
2013 dismissal order and remand to the ICA for further
 proceedings. Patsy Naomi Sakuma,
