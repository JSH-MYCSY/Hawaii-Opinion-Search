CERITORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(CAAP-12-0000870; CIV. NO. 07-1-1487)
 
ORDER ACCEPTING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI,
VACATING THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS’ JUDGMENT ON APPEAL,
AND REMANDING THE CASE TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(By: Nakayama, Acting C.J., McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.
and Circuit Judge Kubo, in place of Recktenwald, C.J, recused)
 
On September 28, 2015, Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant
 
Patsy Naomi Sakuma (Sakuma) filed an application for a writ of
 
certiorari seeking review of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’
 (ICA) September 23, 2015 judgment on appeal. 
Although it is
 
understandable that the ICA presumed it had jurisdiction and
 addressed Sakuma’s appeal after the majority’s opinion in Ass’n
 
of Condo. Homeowners of Tropics at Waikele ex rel. Bd. of Dirs.
 v. Sakuma, 131 Hawai' i 254, 318 P.3d 94 (2013) was issued, our 
recent decision in Deutsche Bank Nat’l Trust Co. v. Amasol, 135 Hawai'i 357, 351 P.3d 584 (2015) clarified that the ICA did not 
have jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for writ of
 
certiorari is accepted. The ICA’s September 23, 2015 judgment on
 appeal is vacated for lack of jurisdiction. The case is remanded
 to the ICA with instructions to temporarily remand the case to
 the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court) to enter a
 written order disposing of Sakuma’s June 7, 2012 motion for
 reconsideration, and direct the circuit court to supplement the
 record on appeal with the written order.
