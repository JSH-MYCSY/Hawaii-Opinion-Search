SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna,
Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
  
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Cierra Ann Kam seeks
 
review of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) January 20,
 
2015 Judgment, entered pursuant to its November 26, 2014 Opinion,
 affirming the District Court of the First Circuit’s September 28,
 2012 Judgment and Notice of Entry of Judgment.
1 The district
 
court found Kam guilty of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence

of an Intoxicant (OVUII) as a repeat offender, in violation of 
Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61; and Operating a Vehicle 
after License and Privilege Have Been Suspended or Revoked for Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVLPSR-OVUII) as a first-time offender, in violation of HRS § 291E-62. 
On certiorari, Kam contends, inter alia, that the ICA
 
erred in holding that the district court properly permitted the
 State to amend the charge against Kam to allege the required mens
 rea for the offense. Kam argues that the defective charge
 rendered the district court without jurisdiction over the case,
 and, therefore, without jurisdiction to permit the State to amend
 the charge. We disagree. In Schwartz v. State, we recently held
 that “the failure of a charging instrument to allege an element
 of an offense does not constitute a jurisdictional defect that
 fails to confer subject-matter jurisdiction to the district
 court.” No. SCWC-10-199, 2015 WL 7370086, at *21 (Haw. Nov. 19,
 2015). Accordingly, the ICA correctly concluded that the
 district court properly permitted the State to amend the charge. 
We further conclude that Kam’s remaining claims lack
 
merit.
