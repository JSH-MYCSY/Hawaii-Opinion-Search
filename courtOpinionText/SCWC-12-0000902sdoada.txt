16, 2014 Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its May 28,

(district court judgment).1  The district court found Shigemura 
guilty of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an 
Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawai #i Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2010).2  This court accepted 
Shigemura’s Application for Writ of Certiorari, and we now 
vacate the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal and the district court judgment and remand the case to the district court for further 
proceedings. 
 After being arrested for OVUII, Shigemura was taken to 
the police station, where he was read an implied consent form.3  
                     
1  The Honorable Clarence A. Pacarro presided. 
2  HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2010) provides in relevant part: 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under 
the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or 
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
. . . 
 (3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten 
liters of breath. . . . 
3  The form read in relevant part: 
1. ___  Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public way, 
street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of the State 
shall be deemed to have given consent to a test or tests for 
the purpose of determining alcohol concentration or drug content of the persons [sic] breath, blood or urine as applicable. 
2. ___  You are not entitled to an attorney before you submit to 
any tests [sic] or tests to determine your alcohol and/or drug 
content. 
3. ___  You may refuse to submit to a breath or blood test, or both for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration and/or blood or urine test, or both for the purpose of 
determining drug content, none shall be given [sic], except as 
provided in section 291E-21.  However, if you refuse to submit

 State v. Won,Shigemura elected to take a breath test, which resulted in a 
breath alcohol content reading of 0.105 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.  In his motion to suppress the breath test results before the district court and on certiorari, Shigemura 
contends that (1) his Miranda rights under Article I, Section 10 
of the Hawai ʻi Constitution were violated when, while in custody, 
he was asked by the police, without Miranda warnings, if he 
wanted to refuse to take a blood alcohol test, which was likely 
to incriminate himself; (2) his statutory right to an attorney was violated; and (3) the wording of the implied consent form misinformed Shigemura of the sanctions.
4  Shigemura also noted in 
his Application that this court had accepted certiorari in State 
v. Won, SCWC-12-858, and he contended that the court’s ruling in Won would “ultimately decide what happens in the present case.” 
 In  136 Hawai ʻi 292, 312, 361 P.3d 1195, 
1215 (2015), we held that “coercion engendered by the Implied Consent Form runs afoul of the constitutional mandate that waiver of a constitutional right may only be the result of a 
                                                                  
to a breath, blood, or urine test, you shall be subject to up 
to thirty days imprisonment and/or fine up to $1,000 or the sanctions of 291E-65, if applicable.  In addition, you shall 
also be subject to the procedures and sanctions under chapter 
291E, part III. 
4  Included in this third argument raised before the district court, 
Shigemura contended that the police officers’ warnings and advisements based on the implied consent form were coercive and that he did not knowingly and 
voluntarily submit to the breath alcohol testing.  The district court denied 
his motion to suppress, and the ICA affirmed the district court’s ruling. ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
free and unconstrained choice,” and, thus, a defendant’s 
decision to submit to testing after being read the implied consent form “is invalid as a waiver of his right not to be searched.”  In accordance with 
State v. Won,  the result of 
Shigemura’s breath test was the product of a warrantless search, and the ICA erred by concluding that the district court properly denied Shigemura’s motion to suppress the breath test result.  Accordingly, Shigemura’s OVUII conviction cannot be upheld.   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s July 16, 2014 Judgment on Appeal and the district court judgment are vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court for further  proceedings consistent with this court’s opinion in 
State v. 
Won.
