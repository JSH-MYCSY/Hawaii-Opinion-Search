whether the admission of the complaining witness ’s preliminary 
hearing testimony at trial violated Nofoa’s right to 
confrontation, and 3) whether the circuit court erred in 
admitting the 911 call at trial.  We conclude that the circuit 
court committed error in regards to the first two issues.  
Because the circuit court ’s errors were not harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt, we vacate the judgment of the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals (ICA) and remand to the circuit court for a new 
trial. 
I. Background 
A. Pretrial Proceedings 
In September 2008, Nofoa was charged by complaint in 
the District Court of the First Circuit (district court) with 
terroristic threatening in the first degree in violation of 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-716(1)(e)1 and kidnapping in 
violation of HRS § 707-720(1)(e).2 The complaining witness (CW) 
was Nofoa’s former girlfriend. 
The district court issued a “Judicial Determination of 
1 At the time of the offense at issue in this case, HRS § 707 ­
716(1)(e) (Supp. 2007) stated, “[a] person commits the offense of terroristic 
threatening in the first degree if the person commits terroristic threatening 
. . . [w] ith the use of a dangerous instrument.” 
2 HRS § 707 -720(1)(e) (2014) states, as it did at the time of the 
offense, “[a] person commits the offense of kidnapping if the person 
intentionally or knowingly restrains another person with intent to . . . 
[t]errorize that person or a third person[.]”

Probable Cause for the Extended Restraint of Liberty of 
Warrantless Arrestee ” (JDPC) stating that there was probable 
cause to arrest Nofoa for the offense of kidnapping.  An 
affidavit along with an addendum from the Honolulu Police 
Department (HPD) supported the JDPC.  The addendum to the 
affidavit contained hearsay statements relaying what CW told a 
HPD officer and detective regarding the alleged kidnapping and 
terroristic threatening incidents. 
In March 2009, six months after Nofoa was charged with 
kidnapping and terroristic threatening in the first degree, 
Nofoa was arrested and charged with CW’s murder. A trial 
followed and Nofoa was acquitted of the murder and related 
charges. 
Following the murder acquittal, the State filed 
notices of intent to introduce at Nofoa’s terroristic 
threatening and kidnapping trial 1) a transcript of CW ’s 
preliminary hearing testimony in the instant case, and 2) a 
recording of CW ’s 911 call.  Nofoa opposed the admission of this 
evidence, arguing that it contained inadmissible hearsay 
statements and that use of the evidence during trial would 
result in confrontation clause violations.  Following a hearing,

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court)3 ruled in 
the State’s favor and allowed the admission of both the 
preliminary hearing testimony and the 911 call. 
The contents of the preliminary hearing testimony and 
the 911 call, along with the circuit court’s disposition of the 
related pretrial motions are discussed further below. 
1. Preliminary Hearing 
On September 19, 2008, about a week following the 
incident in question, CW testified at a preliminary hearing 
before the district court4 regarding the events of the evening 
leading up to Nofoa’s arrest. 
CW testified that she and Nofoa were in a relationship 
for two and a half years.  On September 11, 2008, about a month 
after Nofoa and CW ’s relationship ended, CW was working at the 
Ko Olina resort.  While CW was at work, Nofoa called her and 
asked if she “was seeing another guy.” CW responded that it 
“was none of his business.” At approximately 7:00 p.m., CW 
finished work and proceeded to her car in the hotel parking lot.  After entering her car, she saw Nofoa approaching. Nofoa asked 
to speak with CW and she complied.  CW agreed to walk Nofoa to 
3 The Honorable Randal K.O. Lee presided over the hearing and over 
all other circuit court proceedings discussed herein.  The Honorable Randal 
K.O. Lee also presided over Nofoa’s murder trial. 
4 The Honorable Leslie Hayashi presided over the preliminary 
hearing.

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
his car and during the walk, Nofoa became verbally aggressive 
and pulled her by the hand.  When she attempted to turn around 
and walk away, he grabbed her from the back and started pulling 
her by the neck with his forearm.  He then reached into a 
backpack that he had been carrying, grabbed a gun, and shoved it 
into her neck. He held the gun to her neck, told her he was 
going to shoot her, and ordered her to get into his car. 
Nofoa then drove toward the North Shore.  While he was 
driving, Nofoa asked CW why she wouldn ’t “give him a chance ” and 
get back with him and while doing so, cried and hit himself, 
saying that CW had made him this way.  Eventually, Nofoa stopped 
at a gas station in Hale iwa to buy alcohol.  Nofoa told CW to 
stay in the car and walked toward the gas station sundry shop. 
CW “jumped out the door” of the car and walked toward the store.  
She saw a male working at the gas station and whispered to him 
to call the police. Nofoa noticed CW exit the car and told her 
to get back in the car or he would shoot the people in the 
store. When CW refused, Nofoa picked her up and carried her 
back into the car. As Nofoa was shoving CW into the car, she 
began yelling and screaming. CW testified that because she was 
resisting, Nofoa tried slamming the door while her hands and 
feet were sticking out of the car.  The male she had whispered 
to, later identified as James Garcia, approached Nofoa ’s car and 
5
  
   
 
 
   
 
  
  
 
    
    
 
 
 
 
  
   
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
yelled at him to leave CW alone.  Nofoa then jumped on CW’s lap 
and tried to close the door while he sat on her. 
A female at the gas station, later identified as Ruby 
McNeil, also yelled at Nofoa, telling him to leave CW alone and 
informing him that she had called the police.  Nofoa then 
released CW, ordered her out of the car, and drove away from the 
gas station. Shortly after, Nofoa returned to the gas station 
and said to CW, “this is not my ending, this is not how it’s 
supposed to end.” He then left the gas station.  The police 
arrived approximately ten minutes later. 
Defense counsel’s cross-examination of CW at the 
preliminary hearing spanned twenty-one pages of the transcript. Defense counsel asked CW the reason for CW and Nofoa ’s break up 
and CW responded that it was because she suspected he was seeing another woman. Defense counsel then questioned CW further about 
the incident. Regarding the gun, CW stated: “I don’t know if 
. . . it was a toy gun, a plastic gun, a play gun.  I knew it 
was a gun.” CW also stated that Nofoa did not hit her during 
the altercation. Defense counsel asked if Nofoa told her their 
final destination when they got into his car, to which she 
answered: “He just said we were going to die.”  Neither the 
court nor the prosecutor interrupted the cross-examination of CW during the preliminary hearing. 
6
  
    Prior to trial, the State filed a notice of intent  
to use CW’s preliminary hearing   testimony based on her 
unavailability. Nofoa opposed the motion and filed a motion in 
limine to exclude the testimony, claiming that the hearing  
offered insufficient opportunity for cross-examination.  At the  
hearing on the motions, Nofoa ’s prior defense counsel, who  
represented him at the preliminary hearing,  testified that the 
only materials available to him to prepare for the hearing were the complaint and the JDPC.  Defense counsel had not received 
and was not aware of 1) a three-page written statement by CW 
(known as an HPD-252), 2) a thirty-two-page recorded interview 
3 of CW, and 3) a five -page police report that included an oral 
statement by CW. 
It also appears that  defense counsel did not 
have access to the recording of the 911 call at this time.   
Nofoa argued that he did not have a meaningful opportunity for 
cross-examination at the preliminary hearing for two reasons: 1) 
because preliminary hearings in Hawai i are confined to the issue  
of probable cause, and 2) because he was not given  CW’s 
statements to police prior to the preliminary hearing.  
   
                         
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
The court allowed the admission of the preliminary 
hearing testimony, and 
rejected Nofoa’s argument that he was not 
afforded a full and thorough cross-examination.  In reaching its

until after the preliminary hearing.

decision, the court noted that Nofoa ’s defense counsel did not 
specifically request additional discovery and that Nofoa failed 
to demonstrate how the additional documents would have affected 
his cross-examination.  
2. 911 Call 
The State also sought a pretrial ruling that the 911 
call was admissible at trial. The 911 call reflects that 
McNeil—one of the gas station employees —called the police right 
after Nofoa initially left the gas station, stating, “[w]e need 
a police here for this domestic dispute, please.” McNeil told 
the 911 operator that a girl had been kidnapped.  CW then took the phone and stated : “That’s my ex and he just kidnapped me all 
the way from work and brought me all the way up here.” She then 
noted: “I jumped out the car over here. And then I tried to get 
away, but he was slamming the door on me.  And these guys over 
here called the cops.” The 911 dispatcher asked what kind of 
car Nofoa had been driving, the license plate number, and in what direction the car was heading.  The dispatcher concluded 
the call by stating that someone would be sent to CW ’s location. 
CW did not mention that Nofoa had a gun during the 911 call. 
At the hearing regarding the 911 call, both 
Garcia and McNeil testified about what they witnessed at the 
8
  
   
 
 
 
   
 
 
  
   
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Haleiwa gas station. Garcia testified that he saw CW outside of 
the gas station through the store window and that he saw Nofoa 
grab CW from behind and lift her up while she shouted “‘help me, help me.’”  Garcia approached Nofo a’s car and witnessed Nofoa 
pulling CW onto his lap while she screamed “‘[y]ou’re smashing my hand.’”  Garcia grabbed the passenger door and said to Nofoa: 
“‘Braddah, braddah, let her go, let her go. ’”  Nofoa then 
released CW, and Garcia took CW to the store instructing McNeil to call 911. Garcia described CW as “hysterical,” “scared,” and 
“crying.” Garcia testified that Nofoa returned to the store and 
tried to calmly convince CW to leave with him. At this point, 
CW was “pissed off” and refused to leave with Nofoa.  Before 
Nofoa left, he told CW: “‘Sole, I ’m not done with you yet. ’”  
McNeil’s testimony corroborated Garcia ’s testimony. 
McNeil described CW ’s emotional state as “hysterical” and “in 
pain” while she was making the 911 call. McNeil testified that 
after the 911 call but before the police arrived at the store, 
Nofoa said in a “very threatening” manner, something like, 
“‘Sole, I’m gonna come back for you. ’”  
After arguments from the parties, the court granted 
the State’s request to admit the 911 call, stating that it was admissible under the excited utterance hearsay exception and was 
nontestimonial in nature.

  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
B. Trial 
During jury selection, the court noted that it did not 
want references made to the prior case in which Nofoa was 
acquitted of CW ’s murder. Based on the concern that CW ’s 
identity might remind the jury of the murder case, defense counsel requested that the court question the jury panel to 
determine if they were familiar with the facts surrounding the 
prior case. Specifically, defense counsel sought to determine 
whether the jury panel may have heard about a “Hummer” or 
“Humvee” that had been reported in the media as being at the 
scene of CW’s murder: 
I understand the Court ’s position that the Court doesn ’t 
want to refer to the murder case and I understand why, 
. . . and the reason why I ’m concerned about it is last 
time when we had voir dire during the murder, the thing 
that struck me that people seemed to remember was the 
Hummer, the incident with the Hummer, and they associated 
that with [CW ’s] name. 
On this basis, defense counsel requested that the court make a 
statement to the jury panel to determine if they recalled “‘ an 
incident in the Ewa Beach area which involved a Humvee or Hummer 
type sports utility vehicle.’”  The court refused, noting: “[I] n 
this particular case, no humvee was involved. . . . I don ’t want 
the jurors to associate -- this case occurred in 2008, so . . . 
four years have elapsed. I don ’t want the jurors to, one, refer 
to the homicide -- but we’ll play it by ear, we ’ll see how it 
goes, okay?”

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Following jury selection, the State began its case by 
calling Garcia and McNeil, whose testimonies were similar to 
their testimonies at the motion hearing. Both witnesses 
identified Nofoa as the male they saw with CW on September 11, 
2008 and testified that they saw Nofoa pushing CW into the car 
and slamming the door on her hand because she would not let go. 
Garcia testified that CW appeared “scared” when she first 
approached the window of the gas station store and that she was 
in a “pissed-off state” and “[r]eal mad” after the 911 call . 
Garcia also testified that Nofoa told CW before he left the gas station: “‘Sole, I going get you. We not done yet. I not done 
with you yet.’”  
A CD of the 911 call was played for the jury and 
admitted into evidence. A CD of CW ’s preliminary hearing 
testimony was also played for the jury and admitted into evidence over the defense’s objection. Before the preliminary 
hearing CD was played, the court instructed the jury not to speculate regarding CW ’s unavailability: 
[U]nder certain circumstances the law permits the court to 
receive into evidence the testimony given by a witness in 
another hearing or proceeding who is u navailable to testify 
at trial. In this case the court has determined that [CW] 
is unavailable to testify at trial. 
You are not to speculate as to the reason why [CW] is 
unavailable to testify at trial. The testimony given by 
[CW] in another hearing or proceeding h as been received 
into evidence. Please bear in mind it is your exclusive 
right to determine whether and to what extent a witness 
should be believed and give weight to his or her testimony 
accordingly.

   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Nofoa was the only defense witness.  He contended that 
CW contrived the charges to punish him for his infidelity. 
Nofoa testified that he met with CW, his ex-fiancé, on September 
11, 2008 to drop off a birthday card for her niece. They 
decided to go to the North Shore, and during the ride, CW became 
angry with Nofoa, asking him if he was “‘taking us to where you 
took those sluts ’” in reference to CW’s volleyball teammates he 
had “mess[ed] around with” in the past at Turtle Bay.  Nofoa and 
CW continued arguing, cursing, and yelling at each other in the 
car and eventually arrived at the gas station in Hale iwa. CW 
then stated to Nofoa, “‘[y]ou going to jail, [a]sshole,’” and 
walked out of the car headed to the store. Nofoa saw CW making a gesture to the gas station store attendants to call 911 and he 
then “panicked . . . grabbed her , [and] picked her up” in order 
to bring her back to the car. As he was trying to put CW into 
the passenger seat, the cashier came to hold the door and told 
Nofoa to let CW go. Nofoa complied and CW went back to the 
store with the cashier. Nofoa drove away from the gas station 
but then returned and told CW, “‘[w]e go home already ’” and 
“‘[y]ou causing too much dramas. ’” Nofoa denied saying to CW, 
“‘[t]his isn’t over, ’” and testified that he did not have a gun 
on the day of the incident. The defense rested following 
Nofoa’s testimony. 
12
  
    
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Prior to closing arguments, the court repeated the 
instruction it had given the jury regarding the preliminary 
hearing CD, again stating: “You are not to speculate as to the 
reason why [CW] is unavailable to testify at trial.” The court 
also informed the jury that the attorneys ’ comments during 
closing arguments should not be considered evidence.  
During the prosecutor ’s closing argument, he 
emphasized the importance of the jury ’s credibility 
determination in deciding the case.  Regarding Nofoa ’s 
testimony, the prosecutor stated: “So when you talk about 
credibility, you have to ask yourself if that makes sense, or is 
he telling a cockamamy story . . . .” The prosecutor stated 
that the jury should think about Nofoa ’s “demeanor” and “tone of 
voice” during his testimony and stated that Nofoa was “an 
arrogant guy.” The prosecutor also argued: “[Nofoa] had no good 
intentions for [CW] at all.  He was there because he wanted her to be fearful that she ’s going to die.  And she had no way out.” 
Finally, the prosecutor urged the jury to believe CW ’s testimony 
from the preliminary hearing, highlighting the testimony that 
Nofoa intended to kill CW with his gun: “If you listen to what 
[CW] says, he was going to kill her, and himself.  And he put 
the gun to her neck.” 
13
  
   And the question that we need to ask at this point 
is, if what [CW] is saying is true, okay, if it  ’s  all true, 
then why does absolutely nothing back up her story?  Not a 
single witness.  Not a single scrap of physical evidence. 
Nothing.   Okay.  If her horrible kidnapping story is true, 
then why does [CW] not have any physical injuries?   
 
 
 
 The reason why nothing backs up her story is because 
she’s not telling the truth about how this night went down. 
You got to see [Nofoa].  You got to hear him when he  
testified.  He had to answer questions from [the 
prosecutor ].  And he told you what happened on that night. 
Okay.  
 
 On the other side of that coin, what do we know about 
[CW]?  What do we know about her credibility?  Okay.  We 
know what kind of car she drives. We know she got a new 
boyfriend a month after she broke up her two and a half -­  
well, her two and a half year, long -term relationship broke 
up.  That’s about all we know.  
 
 Okay.  Because you don ’t know anything about her and 
her credibility, the only thing that you can do to judge 
her credibility is to compare her story to any other 
evidence presented in the trial.  That’s the only thing you 
can do, because you didn ’t get to see, hear, you  know, like 
you did with [Nofoa].  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Defense counsel also emphasized the issue of 
credibility during his closing argument.  Specifically, defense 
counsel stated  that CW’s 911 call, in which she did not mention 
a gun, was more credible than her preliminary hearing testimony , 
during which she did mention  the gun.  Defense counsel also 
illustrated CW ’s motives for lying, including the fact that CW 
and Nofoa had recently ended their engagement after CW 
discovered that Nofoa was unfaithful.   Defense counsel then 
asked the jury to determine whether CW or Nofoa was telling the  
truth, based in part, on the fact that they were able to see 
Nofoa testify in person:  
. . . . 
14
  
   
 
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
   
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
At this point, the circuit court interrupted defense 
counsel’s closing argument and asked the attorneys to approach 
the bench. The circuit court informed defense counsel that he 
could not “comment on the fact that they w ere unable to see 
[CW]” and because defense counsel did so, the jurors should be 
informed why CW was not present. The court found it necessary 
to inform the jury regarding CW ’s unavailability because it 
concluded that defense counsel opened the door by raising the 
issue of unavailability during his closing argument: 
THE COURT:  And she ’s deceased. The fact of the 
matter is, you made it an issue, because you said, you said 
that he was here. You could see him testify. He could 
answer questions. She -- when you said that there was no 
evidence to back her up, that was fine. But you went over 
the line when you said you never see her testify. You couldn’t see how she testified. 
The court stated that the appropriate remedy was to 
allow the prosecutor to inform the jury in rebuttal that CW was 
“deceased” without saying “how she got deceased.”  Defense 
counsel objected, asserting that he did not believe he opened the door to the issue of CW ’s availability and that his 
statements related to “ar guing about the nature of the hearsay 
testimony.” Defense counsel also objected on the basis that the 
court sua sponte raised the issue and recommended as an alternative remedy to strike his comment and order the jury to 
disregard it. The court responded that “throughout the entire 
trial [the court ] indicated that nobody should say why” CW was 
15
  
    
  
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
   
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
not at trial and that by stating that the jury was unable to see 
CW, defense counsel was “commenting that she’s available.”  
Defense counsel continued his closing argument, and at 
the end of the argument, the court initiated another bench 
conference to further discuss its concern that defense counsel 
referred to CW ’s absence from trial. The court told counsel 
that the defense ’s comment could allow for the inference that 
Nofoa was more credible than CW, because the jury was able to see him at trial, but did not see CW.  Defense counsel again 
objected, noting that his intention in making the argument at 
issue was to comment on the weight the jury should place on CW ’s 
out-of-court statements in comparison to other evidence adduced at trial. Defense counsel repeated his request that the court 
strike his comment and give a curative instruction instead of 
allowing the prosecutor to state that CW was dead.  The court 
denied defense counsel ’s request, and invited the prosecutor to 
tell the jury that CW was dead: “[The prosecutor] is allowed to 
say that [CW] was not available because she ’s deceased. But not 
why and how she ’s deceased.”  
Consistent with the court ’s direction, the prosecutor 
then delivered his rebuttal.  He began by introducing to the jury an additional fact not in evidence: “[CW] is not here 
because she’s dead.”  After telling the jury CW was dead, the

        ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
prosecutor immediately drew the jury ’s attention to Nofoa’s use 
of a gun to threaten CW, citing CW ’s preliminary hearing 
testimony. 
The jury found Nofoa guilty of kidnapping and 
terroristic threatening in the second degree (as an included 
offense of terroristic threatening in the first degree). The 
circuit court sentenced Nofoa to 20 years imprisonment for the 
kidnapping count and 1 year imprisonment for the terroristic 
threatening count, terms to be served concurrently.  
C. ICA Appeal 
In a Su
mmary Disposition Order (SDO), the ICA affirmed 
Nofoa’s conviction and sentence.  State v. Nofoa , No. CAAP-12­
984, 2014 WL 406564, at *4 (App. Jan. 31, 2014) (SDO).  The ICA 
held, inter alia, that 1) the circuit court did not display 
judicial bias by instructing the prosecutor to inform the jury 
that CW was dead; 2) Nofoa’s confrontation rights were not 
violated when CW ’s preliminary hearing testimony was admitted 
into evidence because Nofoa had an adequate opportunity to 
cross-examine CW at the hearing and had the same motives at 
trial as he had at the hearing; and 3) the 911 call was properly 
admitted under the excited utterance hearsay exception and was 
nontestimonial.  Id. at *1-3.

  A trial judge has broad discretion  to control the  
scope of closing arguments.  See  State v. Adams,  61 Haw. 233, 
234, 602 P.2d 520, 521 (1979)  (per curiam).  However, as with 
other aspects  of a trial in which the judge is granted great 
latitude, an abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has 
“clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a  
party litigant.” Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co.,

II. Discussion 
A.	 The Circuit Court Abused Its Discretion by Instructing the 
Prosecutor To Introduce a Fact Not in Evidence and the Error Was Not Harmless Beyond a Reasonable Doubt 
Nofoa asks us to find judicial bias because the 
circuit court’ s actions rendered his trial fundamentally unfair.  
We need not reach the question of judicial bias, however, 
because we hold that the circuit court abused its discretion by 
instructing the prosecutor during closing argument to introduce 
the fact of CW ’s death to the jury, and the resulting error was 
not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

United States v. Diaz,  961 F.2d 1417, 1418 (9th Cir. 1992) 
(same); 
Adams, 61 Haw. at 234, 602 P.2d at 521 (same). 
Here, the circuit court abused its discretion because 
its actions permitted the prosecutor to present to the jury a 
fact not in evidence that resulted in substantial prejudice to 
Nofoa. To support this conclusion, we draw from our court ’s 
jurisprudence analyzing the consequence of a prosecutor 
introducing facts outside the evidence during closing argument.  
Although these cases examine the issue under the framework of 
prosecutorial misconduct, they are informative here, where the 
effect of the court ’s instruction was to allow the State to 
introduce to the jury a fact not in evidence. 
During closing arguments, prosecutors are “permitted 
to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence and wide latitude is allowed in discussing the evidence.”
 State v. 
Clark
, 83 Hawai i 289, 304, 926 P.2d 194, 209 (1996) (citing 
State v. Apilando , 79 Hawai i 128, 141–42, 900 P.2d 135, 148 
(1995)).  However, we have held that a prosecutor ’s comments are 
improper when they go beyond the record to discuss “matters 
outside the evidence adduced at trial.” State v. Tuua,  125 
Hawaii 10, 14, 250 P.3d 273, 277 (2011).  Thus, in State v. 
Tuua
, we held that a prosecutor ’s comments were improper because 
they referred to the consequences of the jury ’
s verdict. Id.  
19
  
    
  
 
   
 
 
   
  
  
  
   
 
   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Specifically, during closing arguments, the prosecutor stated 
that the defendant ’s brother could not be successfully 
prosecuted at a subsequent proceeding.  Id. at 15, 250 P.3d at 
278. The prosecutor ’s apparent purpose in making this comment 
was to dissuade the jurors from concluding that if they found 
the defendant not guilty, his brother could be held responsible 
for the assault at issue.  Id. The court concluded that the 
prosecutor’s comments, although “couched . . . as an attack on 
. . . credibility ” were improper because they “were not based on 
the evidence in the recor d.” Id. 
More recently, in State v. Basham, we determined that 
a prosecutor
’s comment during closing arguments that the 
defendant lied to the police bypassed evidentiary rules and was 
thus improper. 132 
Hawaii 97, 114-15, 319 P.3d 1105, 1122-23 
(2014). We noted with concern that the defendant’s fundamental 
right to confront the State ’s evidence may be compromised when a 
fact not presented at trial is referenced by the prosecutor during closing. Id. at 112-13, 319 P.3d at 1120-21 (citing 
United States v. Klebig, 600 F.3d 700, 721 (7th Cir. 2009)).    
Here, as in Tuua and Basham, the prosecutor ’s comment 
that CW was deceased caused the jury to hear a fact —for the 
first time—which had intentionally not been presented during 
trial by either party. Indeed, the circuit court specifically 
20
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
    
 
     
   
  
   
 
                         
    
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
told the jury both prior to playing CW ’s preliminary hearing 
testimony and again at the close of evidence “not to speculate 
as to the reason why [CW] is unavailable to testify at trial .” 
In addition, during jury selection, the court demonstrated 
concern that the jurors would associate CW’s death with the 
instant case, noting that he did not want any reference to the 
Humvee involved in CW ’s murder case to be raised before the 
prospective jurors.  Nonetheless, the circuit court reversed its 
position during closing arguments, instructing the prosecutor to 
inform the jury of CW ’s death in an apparent attempt to cure the 
defense’s “opening the door” on the issue of CW’s availability.5 
The court directed the prosecutor to inform the jurors of a 
prejudicial fact not in evidence despite defense counsel ’s 
repeated objections, and in doing so, abused its discretion. 
Because we cannot conclude that the introduction of 
the fact not in evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we remand the case for a new trial. Under the harmless error standard, we “ must ‘determine whether there is a reasonable 
possibility that the error complained of might have contributed 
to the conviction. ’” State v. Pauline , 100 Hawai i 356, 378, 60 
P.3d 306, 328 (2002) (quoting State v. White , 92 Hawai i 192, 
We need not reach the question of whether defense counsel opened 
the door during his closing argument . Even assuming the “opening the door” 
doctrine would be applicable in this context, the remedy of introducing CW’s 
death was inappropriate.

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
198, 990 P.2d 90, 96 (1999)).  If there is such a reasonable 
possibility, then the error is not harmless beyond a reasonable 
doubt, and the conviction must be set aside. State v. Gano, 92 
Hawaii 161, 176, 988 P.2d 1153, 1168 (1999) (citing State v. 
Pulse, 83 Hawai i 229, 248, 925 P.2d 797, 816 (1996)); see also 
Tuua, 125 Hawai i at 16, 250 P.3d at 279 (“An improper comment 
warrants a new trial if ‘there is a reasonable possibility that 
the error complained of might have contributed to the 
conviction.’” (quoting State v. Hauge , 103 Hawai i 38, 47, 79 
P.3d 131, 140 (2003)). Here, several factors evince a 
reasonable possibility that the circuit court ’s error 
contributed to Nofoa ’s conviction. 
For one, there is a reasonable possibility that the 
introduction of the fact not in evidence allowed the jury to 
infer that Nofoa played a role in CW’s death, resulting in 
substantial prejudice to Nofoa.  The State contends such an 
inference was unlikely. However, given the evidence adduced at 
trial and the content of the State’s closing arguments, we 
disagree. See Gano, 92 Hawai i at 176, 988 P.2d at 1168 (stating 
error “‘
must be examined in light of the entire proceedings and 
given the effect to which the whole record shows it is 
entitled’” (quoting State v. Heard , 64 Haw. 193, 194, 638 P.2d 
22
  
    
 
    
    
  
  
 
  
 
  
   
 
   
 
 
  
  
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
307, 308 (1981))).  At trial, the jury heard evidence that Nofoa 
used a gun to threaten his ex-girlfriend during the incident: he 
“shoved” a gun into her neck; told her that they “were going to 
die”; and said to her, “‘Sole, I going get you. . . . I not done 
with you yet.’” Such evidence coupled with hearing that CW was 
in fact dead, would allow the jury to improperly infer that Nofoa indeed acted on his threat to fatally harm CW. 
Moreover, during the State ’s closing argument, the 
prosecutor emphasized the testimony regarding Nofoa ’s threats to 
kill CW, stating : “[Nofoa] had no good intentions for CW at all.  
He was there because he wanted her to be fearful that she ’s 
going to die. And she had no way out.” The prosecutor also 
highlighted the presence of the gun, noting: “If you listen to 
what [CW] says, he was going to kill her, and himself.  And he 
put the gun to her neck.” Thus, when the jurors heard that CW 
was deceased during the prosecutor ’s rebuttal argument, they had 
fresh in their minds Nofoa’s purported desire to kill CW as well as his apparent ability to carry out the threats by using the 
gun in his possession. 
Under these circumstances, it would have been 
reasonable for the jury to conclude —or at least consider the 
possibility—that Nofoa caused CW’s death. Accordingly, the 
circuit court’ s error resulted in a risk of undue prejudice to 
23
  
   
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Nofoa, because it “divert[ed] [the jurors], by injecting an 
issue wholly unrelated to [Nofoa ’s] guilt or innocence into 
their deliberations, from their duty to decide the case on the 
evidence.” State v. Pacheco , 96 Hawai i 83, 95, 26 P.3d 572, 584 
(2001); cf. Hawai i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 404(b) (Supp. 
1994) (“Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not 
admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show 
action in conformity therewith.”). 
The timing of the introduction of the fact not in 
evidence is also relevant. We have previously noted t hat “‘the 
prosecutor’s argument is likely to have significant persuasive 
force with the jury. ’”  Basham , 132 Hawai i at 115, 319 P.3d at 
1123 (quoting State v. Klinge , 92 Hawai
i 577, 592, 994 P.2d 509, 
524 (2000)).  Here, introduction of CW’s death during the 
prosecutor’s rebuttal distinguished it as one of the last facts 
heard by the jury prior to deliberations, further exacerbating 
the risk of prejudice. That CW ’s death was introduced during 
the State’s rebuttal precluded Nofoa from confronting it, for example, by informing the jury that as a matter of law, he was 
not responsible for CW ’s death. 
See, e.g., Lucas v. United 
States
, 102 A.3d 270, 279 (D.C. 2014) ( “‘[I]mproper 
prosecutorial comments are looked upon with special disfavor 
24
  
   
    
    
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
                         
   
 
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
when they appear in the rebuttal because at that point defense 
counsel has no opportunity to contest or clarify what the 
prosecutor has said.’” (quoting   Anthony v. United States,  935 
A.2d 275, 284 (D.C. 2007))). 
The lack of 
a limiting instruction also compounded the 
effect of the prosecutor ’s comment.  Specifically, the court 
failed to instruct the jurors that CW ’s death should not be 
considered as evidence of Nofoa ’s guilt in the terroristic 
threatening and kidnapping case.6 Cf.  State v. Murray , 116 
Hawai
i 3, 19, 169 P.3d 955, 971 (2007) (holding “[t] he potential 
for undue prejudice is so great that failure to give a limiting 
instruction with regard to prior convictions ” results in error 
“even if the defendant has not requested one ” (citing Evans v. 
Cowan
, 506 F.2d 1248, 1249 (6th Cir. 1974))); State v. Cordeiro , 
99 Hawai
i 390, 416, 56 P.3d 692, 718 (2002) (holding potential 
for unfair prejudice related to evidentiary issue “dispelled by the circuit court ’s limiting instruction to the jury ”). 
6 Prior to closing arguments, the circuit court did instruct the 
jury that arguments of counsel were not evidence. However, given the generic 
nature of the instruction and that the court provided no specific instruction 
in relation to the prosecutor commenting on C W’s death, the court’s 
instruction failed to mitigate the prejudice to Nofoa. See State v. Rogan , 
91 Hawai
i 405, 415, 984 P.2d 1231, 1241 (1999) (holding instruction to jury 
that counsels’ arguments were not evidence did not “negate[] the prejudicial 
effect” of the prosecutor’s inflammatory comments); State v. Marsh , 68 Haw. 
659, 661, 728 P.2d 1301, 1302 -03 (1986) (holding prejudicial effect of 
prosecutor’s comment not “rendered harmless” by court’s general instruction 
“that the arguments o
f counsel are not evidence”).  
25
  
    Moreover, the circuit court ’s direction to the 
prosecutor to present a fact not in evidence refuted the court  ’s 
prior unavailability instruction —twice given —that the jury not 
speculate as to the reason for CW ’s unavailability.  The 
contrast between the prior instruc tion and the reference to CW’s 
death in closing heightened the potential for juror confusion 
and prejudice to Nofoa.  
  
   
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the 
circuit court 
abused its discretion in instructing the State to 
introduce a fact not in evidence and there is a reasonable 
possibility that the error might have contributed to Nofoa ’s 
conviction. 
B.	 Admission of CW ’s Preliminary Hearing Testimony at Trial 
Resulted in a Confrontation Clause Violation Requiring 
Remand 
Nofoa additionally contends that the ICA erred when it 
found that the preliminary hearing provided him with an 
opportunity to effectively cross-examine CW.  In this regard, 
Nofoa asks that we create a “bright -line rule ” barring the use 
of preliminary hearing testimony at trial.  We decline to do so.  
Instead we hold that in this case, because only limited 
discovery was provided to Nofoa at the preliminary hearing, and 
later discovery contained significant inconsistencies, the 
preliminary hearing did not provide a meaningful opportunity for 
26
  
   
 
  
     
   
 
 
  
  
  
  
 
                         
   
 
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
cross-examination, resulting in a violation of Nofoa ’s right to 
confrontation under article I, section 14 of the Hawai i 
Constitution and the sixth amendment of the United States 
Constitution. Because this error was not harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt, it provides an independent basis for vacating 
the ICA’s judgment and remanding to the circuit court for a new 
7trial.
The confrontation clauses of article I, section 14 of 
the Hawai i Constitution and the sixth amendment of the United 
States Constitution require that “[i]n all criminal 
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against ” him or her. In Crawford 
v. Washington, the Supreme Court of the United States held that 
testimonial out-of-court witness statements are barred under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment, unless the witness 
is 1) unavailable; and 2) the defendant had a prior opportunity 
for cross-examination.  541 U.S. 36, 59 (2004).  In State v. 
Fields, we explained that under Crawford, “the admissibility of 
testimonial hearsay [is] governed by the following standard: 
where a hearsay declarant ’s unavailability has been shown, the 
testimonial statement is admissible for the truth of the matter 
7 “‘We review questions of constitutional law de novo, under the 
right/wrong standard.’ ”  State v. Kalaola , 124 Hawaii 43, 49, 237 P.3d 1109, 
1115 (2010) (quoting Jou v. Dai– Tokyo Royal State Ins. Co. , 116 Hawaii 159, 
164–65, 172 P.3d 471, 476 –77 (2007)).

  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
asserted only if the defendant was afforded a prior opportunity 
to cross-examine the absent declarant about the statement. ” 115 
Hawaii 503, 516, 168 P.3d 955, 968 (2007) (citing Crawford, 541 
U.S. at 68). We additionally determined that Crawford does not 
prohibit the admission of a prior out-of-court statement where 
“the hearsay declarant is cross -examined at trial about the out-
of-court statement .” Id. at 523, 168 P.3d at 975.  In so 
holding, we noted that even prior to Crawford , our jurisprudence 
supported the proposition that “ sufficient cross-examination of 
the hearsay declarant at trial terminated the [
confrontation 
clause] inquiry.” Id. (emphasis added). 
Ultimately, we 
concluded that Fields was “afforded a meaningful  opportunity” to 
cross-examine the witness at trial 
regarding the subject matter 
of the out-of-court statement. Id. at 528, 168 P.3d at 9
80 
(emphasis added). Unlike Fields, here CW did not appear at 
trial to testify as to her out-of-court statement.  Nonetheless, 
our discussion in Fields  acknowledges that the right to confront 
a witness is not satisfied simply by any cross-examination, but 
instead, that the cross-examination must be sufficient and 
meaningful.
 
Preliminary hearing testimony constitutes testimonial 
hearsay and is thus subject to 
the two-part test of 
admissibility laid out in Crawford and Fields.  Fields, 115 
28
  
     
  
 
    
  Post-Crawford  and Fields, our court has not  developed  
a standard to determine under what circumstances  cross-
examination at  a preliminary hearing provides the defendant with 
a sufficient opportunity to confront a witness.  To advance such 
a standard, we are guided by our pre-Crawford  cases as well as 
cases from other jurisdictions that examined the issue   post-
Crawford.     
  
  
  
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Hawaii at 513, 168 P.3d at 965. Here, because there is no 
question as to CW ’s unavailability at trial, the admissibility 
of CW’s preliminary hearing testimony rests on whether the 
preliminary hearing provided Nofoa with a sufficient and 
meaningful opportunity for cross-examination. 
In State v. Faafiti , for example, we determined that a 
preliminary hearing transcript was admissible at trial where 
cross-examination of the witness 
at the preliminary hearing had 
been extensive and thorough. 54 Haw. 637, 641, 513 P.2d 697, 701 (1973). In so holding, we rejected the defendant ’s argument 
that the cross-examination was not sufficient because a 
“‘preliminary hearing in Hawai[ ]i is limited to [the] question 
of probable cause. ’”  
Id.  However, we recognized the importance 
of allowing unrestricted  cross-examination at the preliminary 
hearing stage, stating: “We also advise the district judges to 
permit the counsel for a defendant t
o examine fully and 
29
  
   
  
     
 
 
   
 
   
 
  
 
  
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
thoroughly witnesses at all preliminary hearings.” Id. at 641­
42 n.4, 513 P.2d at 701 n.4.  
In Toledo v. Lam,  67 Haw. 20, 22, 675 P.2d 773, 775 
(1984), we questioned the admissibility of preliminary hearing 
testimony at trial where the defendant did not have access to 
relevant discovery during the preliminary hearing.  In Toledo, 
during the preliminary hearing at issue, 
the trial judge denied 
the defendant’ s request to produce a statement relied upon by a 
State witness. Id.  Toledo filed a writ of prohibition mid-
hearing arguing, inter alia, that she was denied the opportunity to effectively cross-examine the State’s witness because her 
counsel did not have access to the relevant statement.  Id. at 
21-22, 675 P.2d at 774-75.  While we denied the extraordinary 
writ, we noted that “[n]ormally, a cross -examination cannot be 
full and thorough unless counsel is permitted access to the 
witness’ [sic] previous statements on the matters on which the 
witness is testifying . . . .” 
Id. 
at 22, 675 P.2d at 775.  We 
acknowledged that while discovery issues are within the judge ’s 
discretion, typically, such “disclosure will be necessary to the 
exercise of the right of effective cross-examination.” Id.   
Finally, we stated that “ withholding of such matters by the 
State may well prevent its later use of the witness ’ [sic] 
30
  
        
   
  
 
  
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
preliminary hearing testimony if the witness is unavailable at 
trial.” Id. at 22-23, 675 P.2d at 776.   
In Faafiti and Toledo , we recognized two relevant 
factors in determining the admissibility of preliminary hearing 
testimony at trial: 1) the restrictions placed on the cross-
examination by the trial court, and 2) the discovery available 
to counsel at the time of the hearing in relation to the 
effectiveness of cross-examination.  These factors have also 
been recognized by other jurisdictions post- Crawford as relevant 
in determining whether sufficient opportunity for cross-examination is afforded during preliminary hearings, and in turn 
whether preliminary hearing testimony is admissible at trial. 
In Chavez v. State , for example, the Nevada Supreme 
Court considered the admissibility of preliminary hearing 
testimony at trial, and found that the testimony was admissible 
where the defendant was able to engage in “wide -ranging cross-
examination” during the preliminary hearing when “nearly all the 
discovery was complete.” 213 P.3d 476, 485 (Nev. 2009) (per 
curiam). The court specifically noted that during the 
preliminary hearing, the defendant “had a copy of [the 
witness’s] videotaped statements to police” and used this to 
question the witness about the alleged incident of sexual abuse. Id.  The court also recognized that the magistrate judge who 
31
  
    
  
  
  
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
presided over the preliminary hearing provided the defendant 
with a full opportunity to cross-examine the relevant witness, 
specifically noting that there was no evidence of any 
“inappropriate restrictions on the scope” of the cros s-
examination placed by the judge. Id. Accordingly, the court 
held that the defendant was permitted to exercise his right to 
confrontation: “Therefore, in this instance, because the 
discovery was almost entirely complete and the magistrate judge 
allowed [the defendant] unrestricted opportunity to confront 
[the witness] on all the pertinent issues, we conclude that [the 
defendant’s] [c]onfrontation [c]lause rights were not violated 
by the admission of [the witness ’s] preliminary hearing 
testimony at trial.” Id. at 485-86. 
Similarly, in  People v. Torres,  the Supreme Court of 
Illinois considered several factors in determining that the defendant did not have an adequate opportunity for cross-
examination of the prosecution ’s key witness during the 
preliminary hearing.  962 N.E.2d 919, 932-34 (Ill. 2012).  
First, the court considered the motive and focus of the 
examination at the preliminary hearing, concluding that at both 
the hearing and at trial, “the focus of questioning is whether 
the evidence supports a finding that the defendant committed the 
charged crime.” Id. at 931.  The court noted, however, that 
32
  
   
    
   
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
 
   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
“the motive-and-focus test” could not be the “ sole guide to a 
resolution” of the case. Id. at 932. 
Thus, t
he court considered two additional factors: 
defense counsel ’s knowledge at the time of the cross-
examination, including access to discovery; and the court’s 
restrictions on defense counsel ’s cross-examination.  Id. at 
932-33.  On the issue of defense counsel’s knowledge at the time 
of the preliminary hearing, Torres argued that his counsel did 
not have an adequate opportunity for cross-examination, because 
he did not have access to certain discovery, “namely police 
reports,” which contained the prosecution witness ’s statements 
to police. Id. at 923.  Defense counsel referenced several 
statements the witness made to police that were inconsistent 
with his preliminary hearing testimony. Id. The court agreed 
with Torres on this issue, stating that the defendant “was not 
privy to the inconsistent statements [the prosecution ’s witness] 
gave to police, statements that counsel might have used to 
confront [the witness] and see if further changes in [his] 
version of events might be forthcom ing.” Id. at 933. The court 
additionally took issue with the trial court ’s restrictions on 
counsel during the cross-examination, noting that the trial 
court had sustained objections to defense counsel ’s cross-
examination that inhibited his ability to adequately cross­
33
  
    
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
    
  
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
examine the witness. Id. Accordingly, the court concluded that 
the trial court erred in admitting the preliminary 
hearing 
testimony at trial. Id.  
We recognize that some 
jurisdictions have endorsed a 
complete ban on the use of preliminary hearing testimony at 
trial, while others have been more permissive of the inclusion 
of such testimony, based on the nature of the proceedings.  See, 
e.g.
, People v. Fry,  92 P.3d 970, 972 (Colo.   2004) (en banc)   
(holding preliminary hearings in Colorado do not provide adequate opportunity for cross-examination); State v. Lopez, 258 
P.3d 458, 463 (N.M. 2011) (holding admission of preliminary hearing testimony did not violate the sixth amendment where 
defendant’s motive during cross-examination was the same as at 
trial). However, guided by our pre-
Crawford  cases, we adopt the 
approach of Chavez
 and Torres  and consider the admissibility of 
preliminary hearing testimony at trial on a case
-by-case basis.  
Drawing from these cases, in order to determine 
whether Nofoa had a sufficient and meaningful opportunity for 
cross-examination at the preliminary hearing, we consider the 
following factors: 1) the motive and purpose of the cross-
examination, 2) whether any restrictions were placed on Nofoa ’s 
cross-examination during the preliminary hearing, and 3) whether 
34
  
   
   
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Nofoa had access to sufficient discovery at trial to allow for 
effective cross-examination of CW.  
The first two questions weigh in favor of 
admissibility. First, the motive and purpose of Nofoa’s cross-
examination of CW at the preliminary hearing was sufficiently 
similar to the motive and purpose Nofoa would have had to cross-
examine CW at trial, i.e., to discredit the State ’s case and 
accordingly CW ’s testimony. Second, it does not appear that the 
court restricted Nofoa ’s cross-examination of CW at the 
preliminary hearing. The cross-examination spanned twenty-one 
pages of the transcript and the court did not interrupt during 
the questioning nor did the State make any objections. 
However, we agree with Nofoa that in relation to the 
third factor, he was denied the opportunity for meaningful 
cross-examination because he did not have access to relevant 
discovery materials that would have assisted in the cross-
examination of CW.  We have recognized that access to witness statements may be relevant to determine whether the opportunity 
for cross-examination at a preliminary hearing was sufficient.  
See Toledo
, 67 Haw. at 22, 675 P.2d at 775 (“Normally, a cross -
examination cannot be full and thorough unless counsel is 
permitted access to the witness ’ [sic] previous statements on 
the matters on which the witness is testifying . . . .”); see 
35
  
   
 
   
  
 
 
   
    
   
  
  
 
 
   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
also Torres, 962 N.E.2d at 933 (noting defense counsel at the 
preliminary hearing was “not privy” to certain statements given 
by the witness to support holding that preliminary hearing 
testimony was inadmissible at trial).  Here, at the preliminary 
hearing, the only materials in Nofoa’s counsel ’s possession were 
the JDPC and the complaint.  He lacked several of CW’s statements, including her handwritten HPD-252 statement, a 
thirty-two-page recorded interview, and a five-page police 
report that included CW ’s oral statement. It also does not 
appear that Nofoa ’s counsel had access to or knowledge of the 
911 call at the time of the preliminary hearing. 
Access to these discovery materials would have enabled 
Nofoa’s defense counsel to pose questions relevant to a central 
issue of the defense—CW’s credibility —particularly because 
there were inconsistencies and/or discrepancies between CW’s 
preliminary hearing testimony and her earlier statements.  For 
example, at the preliminary hearing, CW testified that Nofoa 
used a gun to threaten her.  However, during the 911 call, no 
gun is mentioned. Further, during the preliminary hearing, CW 
stated that on the day of the incident, Nofoa called her at work 
to ask her if she was seeing another man, to which she responded 
it was “none of his business.” However, in her HPD-252 
statement and the thirty-two-page recorded interview, CW stated 
36
  
   
  
   
  
  
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
  Thus, we hold that the circuit court erred in allowing 
admission of CW ’s preliminary hearing testimony  at trial.  We 
additionally hold  that the error was  not harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt.  See State v. Mundon , 121 Hawai i 339, 368, 219  
P.3d 1126, 1155 (2009)  (holding constitutional error may be ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
that when Nofoa asked her if she “was with the [g]uy” or “with 
another guy,” she answered Nofoa in the affirmative.  
Had Nofoa’s counsel been aware of these discrepancies, 
he “might have used [them] to confront [CW] and see if further 
changes in [CW ’s] version of events might be forthcoming.” 
Torres, 962 N.E.2d at 933. However, because Nofoa only had access to the JDPC and the complaint, he was unable to engage in 
“effective cross -examination, ” Toledo, 67 Haw. at 22, 675 P.2d 
at 775, of two critical defense issues: CW ’s credibility and his 
use of a gun. In light of the unrebutted fact of CW ’s death 
improperly admitted during the prosecutor’s rebuttal argument, 
the latter issue was of particular importance, as discussed 
supra. In sum, given the lost opportunity to confront CW in 
relation to the unavailable discovery, the admission of the 
preliminary hearing testimony at trial violated Nofoa’s right to 
confrontation as guaranteed by article I, section 14 of the 
Hawaii Constitution and the sixth amendment of the United States 
Constitution. 
37
  
   
  
  
 
    
 
  
   
  
  
                         
  
 
 
 
  
  Notwithstanding, the importance that the State placed on the 
preliminary hearing testimony is evinced by its decision to charge Nofoa with 
the first degree crime.  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
harmless if court can “‘declare a belief that it was harmless 
beyond a reasonable doubt ’” (quoting State v. Napeahi , 57 Haw. 
365, 373, 556 P.2d 569, 574 (1976))).  We are unable to say the 
error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because CW’s 
preliminary hearing testimony was a crucial piece of evidence 
presented by the State. It was the only evidence at trial that 
mentioned Nofoa ’s possession of a gun and accordingly was the 
only evidence to support the State ’s first degree terroristic 
threatening case.8 Although Garcia ’s and McNeil ’s testimony and 
the 911 call provided evidence corroborating some of the 
preliminary hearing testimony, we believe there is at least a 
reasonable possibility that the preliminary hearing testimony 
might have contributed to Nofoa ’s conviction. See Pauline , 100 
Hawaii at 378, 60 P.3d at 328.  This is particularly true 
because the case involved a credibility determination between CW 
and Nofoa, and CW ’s preliminary hearing testimony directly 
conflicted with Nofoa ’s testimony at trial. Accordingly, 
because there is a reasonable possibility that the admission of 
8 The jury found Nofoa guilty of the lesser included offense of 
terroristic threatening in the second degree , which did not require the use 
of “a dangerous instrument.” Compare HRS § 707- 716(1)(e) (Supp. 2007) (“A 
person commits the offense of terroristic threatening in the first degree if 
the person commits terroristic threatening . . . [w]ith the use of a 
dangerous instrument.”) with HRS § 707 -717(1) (2014) (“A person commits the 
offense of terroristic threatening in the second degree if the person commits terroristic threatening other than as provided in section 707 -716.”).

the preliminary hearing testimony at trial might have

9court for a new trial.
C.	 The 911 Call Was Properly Admitted as a Hearsay Exception 
and Did Not Result in a Confrontation Clause Violation 
With the purpose of providing guidance to the circuit 
court and the parties on remand, we address Nofoa ’s claim 
regarding the admissibility of the 911 call. See Basham, 132 
Hawaii at 112, 319 P.3d at 1120.  
Nofoa contends that the circuit court erred in 
admitting the 911 call because 1) it did not qualify under the 
excited utterance hearsay exception; and 2) it was testimonial 
in nature and not subject to cross-examination, and thus 
violated his right to confrontation.10 We disagree. 
Pursuant to HRE Rule 803(b)(2) (1993), “[a] statement 
relating to a startling event or condition made while the 
9 Because we find error in the court’s admission of the preliminary 
hearing testimony, we need not reach Nofoa’s argument that the court abused 
its discretion in providing a recording of the preliminary hearing testimony 
to the jury during deliberations. However , we note that the trial court is 
not required to provide all evidence admitted at trial to the jury during 
deliberations. See, e.g., State v. Kassebeer , 118 Hawai i 493, 506, 193 P.3d 
409, 422 (2008) (reviewing trial court’s decision to allow handgun that was 
admitted into evidence into jury room for abuse of discretion) . 
10 We review both questions de novo under the right/wrong standard.  
See State v. Moore , 82 Hawai i 202, 217, 921 P.2d 122, 137 (1996) (“[W]here 
the admissibility of evidence is determined by application of the hearsay 
rule, there can be only one correct result, and ‘the appropriate standard for 
appellate review is the right/wrong standard.’ ” (quoting Kealoha v. County of 
Hawaii, 74 Haw. 308, 319, 844 P.2d 670, 675 (1993))); Kalaola, 124 Hawai i at 
49, 237 P.3 d at 1115 (holding constitutional questions reviewed de novo under 
the right/wrong standard).

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event 
or condition” is admissible hearsay.  In State v. Machado , we 
explained that to qualify under this hearsay exception (i.e., an 
“excited utterance ”), “the proponent of the statement must 
establish that: (1) a startling event or condition occurred; (2) the statement was made while the declarant was under the stress 
of excitement caused by the event or condition; and (3) the 
statement relates to the startling event or condition. ” 109 
Hawai
i 445, 451, 127 P.3d 941, 947 (2006). Nofoa only disputes 
the second requirement, claiming that CW was not in fact “under 
the stress of excitement” during the call. Garcia’s and 
McNeil’s testimony at the hearing regarding the 911 call refute 
Nofoa’s claim.  Garcia described CW as “hysterical,” “scared,” 
and “crying” at the time of the incident and said that CW was 
“pissed” when she was on the phone. Similarly, at the time 
McNeil passed the phone to CW so that she could speak to the 911 
dispatcher, McNeil described CW ’s emotional state as 
“hysterical” and “in pain.” Considered along with the other 
circumstances surrounding the 911 call, this testimony 
demonstrates that CW ’s statement was not the product of 
reflective thought and instead constituted an excited utterance.  
See State v. Delos Santos, 124 Hawai i 130, 138, 238 P.3d 162, 
170 (2010) (citing evidence that complainant was “‘shaken’” 
40
  
   
  
   
    
    
 
 
   
  
 
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
“‘crying’” and “‘in a lot of pain ’” to determine that 
complainant’s “mental and physical condition supports the 
prosecution’s argument that her statement was an excited 
utterance”). 
Nofoa’s claim that the 911 call violated his right to 
confrontation is also unavailing. To be subject to the 
confrontation clause analysis discussed above, the out-of-court 
statement must be testimonial in nature. Fields, 115 Hawai i at 
516, 168 P.3d at 968. Statements are considered 
“‘nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation 
under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary 
purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.’”  Id. 
at 514, 168 P.3d at 966 
(quoting Davis v. Washington,  547 U.S. 813, 822 (2006)).  
Testimonial statements, in contrast, involve circumstances that 
“‘objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, 
and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to 
establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later 
criminal prosecution. ’”  Id.  (quoting Davis
, 547 U.S. at 822). 
CW
’s statements during the 911 call were 
nontestimonial because “any reasonable listener would recogniz e 
that [CW] . . . was facing an ongoing emergency ” and the purpose 
of the call was to request police assistance. Davis, 547 U.S. 
41
  
   
  
 
  
    
  
 
  
    
 
 
    
 
 
   
                         
     
  
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
at 827. At the beginning of the 911 call, McNeil told the 
operator: “We need a police here for this domestic dispute, 
please.” CW’s statements occurred outside the presence of 
police protection and CW was still facing the threat of violence 
from Nofoa when the call was placed, as Nofoa had just left the 
gas station. Moreover, the questions asked by the dispatcher, 
i.e., the type of car Nofoa was driving, the direction in which 
he was heading, and the car’s license plate number, demonstrate 
a purpose of finding Nofoa to prevent further harm or stated 
otherwise, to “resolve the present emergency, rather than simply 
to learn . . . what had happened in the past.” Davis, 547 U.S. 
at 827. 
Because CW ’
s statements were nontestimonial, the two-
part test from Ohio v. Roberts,  448 U.S. 56 (1980), applies. 
See Fields
, 115 Hawai i at 516, 168 P.3d at 968 (“We therefore 
reaffirm Roberts ’ continued viability with respect to 
nontestimonial 
hearsay.”).11 Under Roberts, a nontestimonial 
out-of-court statement is admissible if “(1) the declarant is 
‘unavailable,’ and (2) the statement bears some indicia of 
reliability.” Fields, 115 Hawai i at 528, 168 P.3d at 980. As 
previously noted, CW ’s unavailability is undisputed.  Regarding 
11 Roberts was abrogated by Crawford but is still applicable in 
relation to nontestimonial hearsay.  Fields, 115 Hawai i at 516, 168 P.3d at 
968.

the second requirement, CW’s 911 call statements were 
sufficiently reliable because they fell “‘within a firmly rooted

12911 call was admissible.
