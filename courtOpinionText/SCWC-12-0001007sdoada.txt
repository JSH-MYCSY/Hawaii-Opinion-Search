 Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant William A. Kernstock 
seeks review of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) August 
19, 2014 Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its July 15,

(district court judgment).1 The district court found Kernstock 
guilty of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an 
Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawai #i Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2010).2 This court accepted 
Kernstock’s Application for Writ of Certiorari, and we now 
vacate the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal and the district court judgment and remand the case to the district court for further 
proceedings. 
After being arrested for OVUII, Kernstock was taken to 
the police station, where he was read an implied consent form.

1 The Honorable Paul B.K. Wong presided. 
2 HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2010) provides in relevant part: 
(a)	 A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under
the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
. . . 
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten
liters of breath. . . . 
3 The form read in relevant part: 
1. ___ 	 Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public way,
street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of the State
shall be deemed to have given consent to a test or tests for
the purpose of determining alcohol concentration or drugcontent of the persons [sic] breath, blood or urine asapplicable. 
2. ___ 	 You are not entitled to an attorney before you submit to
any tests [sic] or tests to determine your alcohol and/or drugcontent. 
3. ___ 	 You may refuse to submit to a breath or blood test, or
both for the purpose of determining alcohol concentrationand/or blood or urine test, or both for the purpose of
determining drug content, none shall be given [sic], except as
provided in section 291E-21. However, if you refuse to submit

Kernstock elected to take a breath test, which resulted in a 
breath alcohol content reading of 0.131 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. In his motion to suppress the breath test results before the district court and on certiorari, Kernstock 
contends that (1) his Miranda rights under Article I, Section 10 
of the Hawai ʻi Constitution were violated when, while in custody, 
he was asked by the police, without Miranda warnings, if he 
wanted to refuse to take a blood alcohol test, which was likely 
to incriminate himself; (2) his statutory right to an attorney was violated; and (3) the wording of the implied consent form misinformed Kernstock of the sanctions.
4 Kernstock noted in his 
Application that this court had accepted certiorari in State v. Won, SCWC-12-858, and he contended that the court’s ruling in Won
 would “ultimately decide what happens in the present case.” 
In State v. Won
, 136 Hawai ʻi 292, 312, 361 P.3d 1195, 
1215 (2015), we held that “coercion engendered by the Implied Consent Form runs afoul of the constitutional mandate that waiver of a constitutional right may only be the result of a 
to a breath, blood, or urine test, you shall be subject to up
to thirty days imprisonment and/or fine up to $1,000 or thesanctions of 291E-65, if applicable. In addition, you shallalso be subject to the procedures and sanctions under chapter
291E, part III. 
4 Included in this third argument raised before the district court
and the ICA, Kernstock contended that the police officers’ warnings and
advisements based on the implied consent form were coercive and that he didnot knowingly and voluntarily submit to the breath alcohol testing. The 
district court denied his motion to suppress, and the ICA affirmed the
district court’s ruling.

free and unconstrained choice,” and, thus, a defendant’s 
decision to submit to testing after being read the implied consent form “is invalid as a waiver of his right not to be searched.” In accordance with State v. Won, the result of 
Kernstock’s breath test was the product of a warrantless search, 
and the ICA erred by concluding that the district court properly denied Kernstock’s motion to suppress the breath test result. Accordingly, Kernstock’s OVUII conviction cannot be upheld. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s August 19, 2014 
Judgment on Appeal and the district court judgment are vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this court’s opinion in State v. 
Won.
