MICHAEL A. BAYUDAN,
  
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant.
  
(CAAP-12-0001025; CASE NO. 1DTA

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ., 
with Wilson, J., concurring separately, 
and Nakayama, J., dissenting, with whom Recktenwald, C.J., joins )
 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Michael A. Bayudan seeks 
review of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (“ICA”) October 28, 
2015 Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its September 28, 
2015 Summary Disposition Order, which affirmed the District 
Court of the First Circuit’s (“district court ”) October 25, 2012 
Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment (“district court judgment”).
1 The district court found Parker 
1 The Honorable David W. Lo presided.

guilty of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an  
Intoxicant (“OVUII”) , in violation of Hawai i Revised Statutes 
2 (“HRS”) § 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2010).   We accepted Bayudan’s 
Application for Writ of Certiorari, and  we now vacate the ICA’s 
Judgment on Appeal and the district court judgment and remand 
the case to the district court  for further proceedings.  
After being arrested for OVUII, Bayudan was taken to the 
3  police station, where he was read an implied consent form.  
Bayudan elected to take a breath test, which resulted in a 
2 HRS § 291E- 61(a)(3) (Supp. 2010) provides in relevant part: 
A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under the 
influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or assumes 
actual physical control of a vehicle: . . . [w]ith .08 or more 
grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of breath. . . . 
3 The form read in relevant part: 
1. ___ 	 Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public way, 
street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of the State 
shall be deemed to have given consent to a test or tests for 
the purpose of determining alcohol concentration or drug 
content of the persons [sic] breath, blood or urine as applicable. 
2. ___ 	 You are not entitled to an attorney before you submit to 
any tests [sic] or tests to determine your alcohol and/or drug 
content. 
3. ___ 	 You may refuse to submit to a breath or blood test, or 
both for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration and/or blood or urine test, or both for the purpose of 
determining drug content, none shall be given [sic], except as 
provided in section 291E -21.  However, if you refuse to submit 
to a breath, blood, or urine test, you shall be subject to up 
to thirty days imprisonment and/or fine up to $1,000 or the 
sanctions of 291E -65, if applicable.  In addition, you shall 
also be subject to the procedures and sanctions under chapter 291E, part III.

breath alcohol content reading of 0.117 grams of alcohol per 210 
liters of breath. 
The State charged Bayudan with OVUII in violation of HRS § 
291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3).  At a hearing before trial, the 
State told the district court that it would be proceeding 
against Bayudan only on the HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) charge.  
Bayudan then orally moved to suppress the breath test results, 
arguing that he did not voluntarily consent to breath testing. 
The district court denied the motion. The district court 
ultimately found Bayudan guilty of violating HRS § 291E -
61(a)(3). 
Bayudan appealed, raising points of error that are not 
necessary to consider upon certiorari.4 The ICA affirmed the 
district court’s judgment. On certiorari, Bayudan asks this 
court to consider the following question: 
Whether [Bayudan’s] election to submit to the breath test 
was consensual after his arrest for [OVUII] when [he] was 
given a choice that he could either submit to a test for 
the purpose of determining alcohol concentration, or if he 
did not submit, he would be arrested, prosecuted, and subject to thirty days of imprisonment for the crime of 
refusal to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, in 
light of this Court’s Opinion in State v. Won , SCWC-12
 -
0000858 (2015)?

  One of Bayudan’s points of error was, “There [wa]s insufficient 
evidence that the intoxicant control roadblock was established and  
implemented in accordance with the minimum standards and guidelines provided in H.R.S. § 291E- 19 and H.R.S. § 291E -20.” The ICA rejected the argument. 
State v. Bayudan, CAAP- 12-0001025 (App. Sept. 28, 2015)(SDO) at 3.  Although 
Bayudan raises this issue again on certiorari, we dispose of this appeal 
under Won   and therefore do not need to reach, and do not reach, this issue.

In State v. Won , 136 Hawaiʻ i 292, 312, 361 P.3d 1195, 1215 
(2015), we held that “coercion engendered by the Implied Consent 
Form runs afoul of the constitutional mandate that waiver of a 
constitutional right may only be the result of a free and 
unconstrained choice,” and, thus, a defendant’s decision to 
submit to testing after being read the implied consent form “is 
invalid as a waiver of his right not to be searched.” In 
accordance with State v. Won , the result of Bayudan’s breath 
test was the product of a warrantless search, and the district 
court erred in denying Bayudan’s motion to suppress the breath 
test result. Accordingly, Bayudan’s OVUII conviction cannot 
stand. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s October 28, 2015 
Judgment on Appeal 
and the district court judgment are vacated, 
and the case is remanded to the district court for further 
proceedings consistent with this court’s opinion in State v. 
Won.
