CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS  
(CAAP-
12-0001072; CASE NO. 1DTA-11-05472) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ., 
with Wilson, J., concurring separately, 
  
and Nakayama, J., dissenting, 
with whom Recktenwald, C.J., joins ) 
 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Kevin K.T. Guard seeks 
review of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) July 2, 2015 
Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its May 29, 2015 Summary 
Disposition Order, which affirmed the District Court of the 
First Circuit’s (district court) Notice of Entry of Judgment     
  
 
    
 
    
 
 
 
 
  
                     
     
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and/or Order and Plea/Judgment entered on November 15, 2012.1 
The district court found Guard guilty of Operating a Vehicle 
Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of 
Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2012).2 We 
accepted Guard’s Application for Writ of Certiorari, and we now 
vacate the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal and the district court’s 
Judgment and remand the case to the district court for further 
proceedings. 
After being arrested for OVUII, Guard was taken to the 
police station, where he was read an implied consent form.3 
1 The Honorable David W. Lo presided.
 
2 HRS § 291E -61(a)(3) provides in relevant part:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates 
or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
. . . 
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two 
hundred ten liters of breath. . . . 
3 The form, titled “Use of Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle 
Implied Consent for Testing ,” stated in relevant part: 
1. ___ Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public 
way, street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of the 
State shall be deemed to have given consent to a test or 
tests for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration 
or drug content of the persons [sic] breath, blood, or 
urine as applicable. 
2. ___ You are not entitled to an attorney before you 
submit to any tests or tests to determine your alcohol 
and/or drug content. 
3. ___ You may refuse to submit to a breath or blood test, 
or both for the purpose of determining alcohol 
concentration and/or blood or urine test, or both for the 
purpose of determining drug content, none shall be given,

 4   Included in this third argument  raised before the district court, 
Guard contended that the police officers’ warnings and advisements based on 
the implied consent form were coercive and Guard did not make a knowing and 
intelligent decision to submit to breath alcohol testing. The district court 
denied his motion to suppress, and the ICA affirmed the district court’s 
ruling.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Guard elected to take a breath test, which resulted in a breath 
alcohol content reading of 0.184 grams of alcohol per 210 liters 
of breath. In his motion to suppress the breath test results 
before the district court and on certiorari, Guard contends that 
(1) he was subject to custodial interrogation and should have 
been informed of his Miranda rights guaranteed by Article I, 
Section 10 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution; (2) his statutory right 
to an attorney was violated; and (3) the wording of the implied 
4consent form misinformed Guard of the sanctions.
In State v. Won , 136 Hawaiʻ i 292, 312, 361 P.3d 1195, 
1215 (2015), we held that “coercion engendered by the Implied 
Consent Form runs afoul of the constitutional mandate that 
waiver of a constitutional right may only be the result of a 
free and unconstrained choice,” and, thus, a defendant’s 
decision to submit to testing after being read the implied 
consent form “is invalid as a waiver of his right not to be 
searched.” In accordance with Won
, the result of Guard ’s breath 
test was the product of a warrantless search, and the ICA erred 
except as provided in section 291E -21.  However, if you 
refuse to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, you 
shall be subject to up to thirty days imprisonment and/or 
fine up to $1,000 or the sanctions of 291E -65, if 
applicable. In addition, you shall also be subject to the 
procedures and sanctions under chapter 291E, part III.

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
by concluding that the district court properly den ied Guard’s 
motion to suppress the breath test result. Accordingly, Guard’s 
OVUII conviction cannot be upheld. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s July 2, 2015 
Judgment on Appeal and the district court ’s Judgment are 
vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court for 
further proceedings consistent with this court’s opinion in 
Won.
