OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.  
 
I. Introduction  
 This case arises from a personal injury lawsuit filed by 
Gary Alan Mobley (“Mobley”) against the drivers of two vehicles Electronically Filed

 in two separate accidents
, from which Mobley alleges injuries.  
The accidents occurred on June 8, 2005,  and January 12, 2008.  
Mobley filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit (“circuit court”) against Leslie S. Ching (“Ching”)  for 
the 2005 accident and Lyanne Kimura (“Kimura”)  for the 2008 
accident.  Kimura then impleaded Dennis K. Espaniola 
(“Espaniola”) as a third-party defendant because of  his 
involvement in the 2008 a ccident.   
Hawaiʻi Revised S
tatutes (“HRS”) § 431:10C -306(a) (2005) 
abolishes tort liability with respect to accidental harm arising 
from motor vehicle accidents occurring in this State unless an 
exception under subsection (b) applies.  Mobley’s complaint 
alleged he was able to assert tort liability for the 2005 and 
2008 accidents under either or both of two exceptions: (1)     
HRS § 431:10C-306 (b)(4), which provides an exception to the 
abolition of tort liability if a person has incurred at least 
$5,000 in personal inj ury protection (“PIP”) benefits  (sometimes 
“tort threshold” or “tort threshold exception” ); and/or (2)   
HRS § 431:10C-306(b)(2), which provides an exception for an 
injury that consists, in whole or in part, “in a significant 
permanent loss of use of a part or function of the body” 
(sometimes “significant permanent loss of use exception”).  
The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of 
Kimura and Espaniola with respect to the 2008 accident, ruling ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 Mobley failed to satisfy either exception.  Before granting the 
defense motions, the circuit court 
also ruled Mobley failed to 
lay sufficient foundation for the admission and consideration of 
a doctor’s report and letter attached to his opposition 
memorandum, then denied Mobley’s  oral request for a Hawaiʻi Rules 
of Civil Procedure (“HRCP”)  Rule 56(f) continuance to obtain 
admissible evidence of the contents of the doctor’s documents .   
 In its August 15, 2019 memorandum opinion, the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals (“ ICA”) ruled, inter alia, that the circuit 
court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Kimura and 
Espaniola for the 2008 a ccident.  We accepted Espaniola ’s 
application for a writ of certiorari, which presents two 
questions, summarized as follows:  
1. Did the ICA err in ruling the circuit c ourt erred  in 
granting Espaniola’s motion for partial summary judgment 
based on Mobley’s failure to satisfy the tort threshold?  
 
2. Did the ICA err in ruling that the c ircuit c ourt’s 
grant of Espaniola’s motion for partial summary judgment  
was premature because evidence had not established that, by 
the time of trial, Mobley would not be able to demonstrate 
satisfaction of the tort threshold or prove that his injury 
constitutes , in whole or in part , a significant permanent 
loss of use of a part or function of the body ? 
  
Espaniola ’s questions on certiorari relate to the ICA’s 
application of the following portion of Ralston v. Yim , 129 
Hawaiʻi 46, 292 P.3d 1276
 (2013): ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 In sum, this court's case law indicates that a 
summary judgment movant may satisfy [their][
1] initial burden 
of production by either (1) presenting evidence negating an 
element of the non -movant's claim, or (2) demonstrating 
that the nonmovant will be unable to carry 
[their] burden 
of proof at trial.   Where the movant attempts to meet 
[their] burden through the latter means, [they] must show 
not only that the non -movant has not placed proof in the 
record, but also that the  movant will be  unable to offer 
proof at trial .  Accordingly, in general, a summary 
judgment movant cannot merely point to the non -moving 
party's lack of evidence to support [their] initial burden 
of production if discovery has not concluded.  (“[M]erely 
asserting that the non -moving party has not come forward 
with evidence to support its claims is not enough.”).  
 
129 Hawai ʻi at 60- 61, 292 P.3d at 1290- 91 (last alteration in 
original) (citations omitted). 
For clarity, w e address the ICA’s rulings on  the tort 
threshold and significant permanent loss of use exceptions 
separately, rather than through the questions presented by 
Espaniola. 
With respect to Mobley’s alleged failure to satisfy the 
tort threshold exception, Espaniola’s motion was based on  the 
first Ralston prong, as Kimura and Espaniola allegedly 
“present[ed] evidence negating  an element of [Mobley’s] claim” 
by submitting a declaration stating that no PIP benefits had 
been paid for the 2008 accident.  Yet, the ICA ruled Espaniola 
was not entitled to summary judgment because of a failure to 
show that Mobley would be unable to offer proof at trial that he 
met the tort threshold.  As indicated in the passage from 
                                                           
1  In this opinion, “they, them, and their” are used where (1) those are 
the pronouns used by a specific person; or (2) the gender identity of a 
person referred to is unknown, unspecified, or immaterial.    ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
5 (continued. . .)  
 Ralston above, however, t he “unable to offer proof at trial”  
factor applies only when a movant seeks summary judgment based 
on the second Ralston prong, by “demonstrating that the 
nonmovant will be unable to carry [their] burden of proof at 
trial.”  According to Hawai ʻi law, when a plaintiff asserts 
applicability of the tort threshold exception, satisfaction of 
the exception is jurisdictional to the filing of a lawsuit.  
Therefore, the ICA erred to the extent it ruled Espaniola could 
not obtain summary judgment on the to
rt threshold exception 
unless he could show Mobley could not demonstrate he could meet 
the tort threshold at the time of trial. 
We also hold, however, that the ICA did not err in vacating 
the circuit court’s grant of summary  judgment as to the 2008 
accident based on the tort threshold exception.  This is because 
Espaniola failed to meet his initial burden under the first 
Ralston prong of “negating an element of [Mobley’s] claim .”  The 
tort threshold exception of HRS § 431:10C-306(b) (4) requires 
that a plaintiff have “incurred” PIP benefits of $5,000,  and 
reviewing the record de novo, Mobley ’s amended  answers to 
interrogatories, attached to Kimura’s motion for summary 
judgment,2 raised a genuine issue of material fact on the 
applicability of the exception. 
                                                           
2  HRCP Rule 56(e) (2000) provides in relevant part that “[s]upporting and 
opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
6 
 The ICA also did not er r with respect to its application of 
Ralston with respect to the significant permanent loss of use 
exception.  Espaniola presented no evidence to negate this 
exception to the abolition of tort liability.  Espaniola’s 
motion for partial summary judgment was, therefore, based on the 
second Ralston prong.  The ICA properly concluded Espaniola did 
not meet his burden of establishing that Mobley would be unable 
to offer proof of this exception at trial; based on the record, 
whether Mobley could meet the exception was not “so clear that 
reasonable minds could only come to one conclusion .”   
We therefore affirm the ICA’s August 29, 2019 judgment on 
appeal, which vacated the circuit court’s March 6, 2013 judgment 
and remanded the case for reinstatement of Mobley’s claims 
related to both the 20053 and 2008 a ccidents, but as modified by 
the analysis in this opinion.

the affiant is competent to testif y to the matters stated therein[,]” and 
HRCP Rule 56(c) provides in relevant part that “ [t]he judgment sought shall 
be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to 
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if 
any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the 
moving party is entitled t o a judgment as a matter of law.”

 II. Background 
A. HRS § 431:10C- 306 
 HRS § 431:10C- 306,4 entitled “Abolition of tort liability,” 
will be continually referenced.  It states in relevant part as 
follows: 
(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), this article 
abolishes tort liability of the following persons with 
respect to accidental harm arising from motor vehicle 
accidents occurring in this State:  
 
(1) Owner, operator, or user of an insured motor 
vehicle; or  
 
(2) Operator or user of an uninsured motor vehicle 
who operates or uses such vehicle without reason to believe 
it to be an uninsured motor vehicle.  
 
(b) Tort liability is not abolished as to the following 
persons, their personal representatives, or their legal 
guardians in the following circumstances:  
 
(1)
 Death occurs to the person in such a motor 
vehicle accident;  
 
(2) Injury occurs to the person which  consists, in 
whole or in part, in a significant permanent loss of use of 
a part or function of the body;  
 
(3) Injury occurs to the person which consists of a 
permanent and serious disfigurement which results in 
subjection of the injured person to mental or emotional 
suffering; or  
 
(4) Injury occurs to the person in a motor vehicle accident 
and as a result of such injury that the personal injury 
protection benefits incurred by such person equal or exceed 
$5,000;[5] provided that in calculating this amount:  
                                                           
4  HRS § 431:10C- 306 has not been amended since 2001.  
 
5  At all times relevant to this case, HRS § 431:10C- 103.5(a) (2005) 
defined “personal injury protection benefits” as follows: 
 
(a) Personal  injury protection benefits , with respect to 
any accidental harm, means all appropriate and reasonable 
treatment and expenses necessarily incurred as a result of 
the accidental harm and which are substantially comparable 
to the requirements for prepaid health care plans, 
including medical, hospital, surgical, professional, ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
8 . . . . 
  
(A)
 The following shall be included:  
 
(i) Personal injury protection benefits 
incurred by, paid to or payable to, or on behalf 
of, an eligible injured person including amounts 
paid directly by or on behalf of the eligible 
insured because of the accidental  harm or similar 
benefits under social security, worker's 
compensation, or public assistance laws;  
 
(ii) The applicable amounts of deductible or 
copayment paid or incurred;  
 
(iii) Amounts paid by or on behalf of an 
injured person who is not entitled to personal 
injury protection benefits, by health insurance or 
other funds; provided that payment in excess of 
the charges or services allowable under this 
chapter shall not be included;  
 
(iv) Where an eligible injured person 
receives coverage on other than a  fee for service 
basis including, but not limited to, a health 
maintenance organization operating on a capitation 
basis, the value of services provided shall be 
determined in accordance with the fee schedules 
allowable under this chapter for purposes of 
threshold determination;  
 
(B) When a person has optional coverage, 
benefits received in excess of the maximum basic 
personal injury protection limits set forth 
in section 431:10C -103.5 shall not be included. 
  
(c) Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply whether or not the 
injured person is entitled to receive personal injury 
protection benefits.  The party against whom the 
presumption under this section is directed shall have the 
burden of proof to rebut the presumption.

 B. Factual background  
 Mobley  was born on July, 23, 1952, and served in the United 
States Army.  After leaving the military, Mobley became a junior 
ROTC instructor on Maui,  then on Oahu.  As of the 201 1 motions 
at issue in this appeal, Mobley ha d been a junior ROTC 
instructor at Punahou School since August 2000 and  had been 
married to his wife, Susan, for over thirty- eight years, with 
whom he had two children.   
 The 2005 accident occurred on June 8, 2005.  Ching rear-
ended Mobley on the H- 1 freeway.   Mobley’s motor vehicle 
insurance company, GEICO , classified Mobley’s truck a total 
loss, and paid him $14,050.   
 The 2008 accident occurred on January 12, 2008.  Mobley was 
rear-ended in a chain-reaction collision on the H -1 freeway.   
Espaniola was directly behind Mobley when Kimura rear- ended 
Espaniola’s vehicle, pushing it into Mobley’s truck.   
C. Procedural background 
 1. Circuit court proceedings 
  a.  Pleadings and pre-trial 
 On November 13, 2009, Mobley filed a complaint against 
Ching and Kimura, alleging their negligence caused him injuries.  
Mobley alleged the 2005 accident caused pain in his neck, back, 
and shoulder; numbness in his hands and leg; and headaches.  He 
also claimed he was no longer able to run or march with his ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
10 
 students.  He alleged
 the 2008 accident aggravated his injuries 
from the 2005 accident.  Mobley ’s complaint  also asserted his 
claims against Ching and Kimura were exempted from the abolition 
of tort liability because he met the required “medical 
threshold” and had “permanent injury and significant loss of use 
of a body part and function and continues to require medical 
attention.”   
Ching’s December 10, 2009 answer asserted Mobley’s 
complaint was barred by HRS § 431:10C ( sometimes “ no-fault 
law”).  Ching later admitted liability for the 2005 accident, 
but disputed causation of Mobley’s injuries  and the nature and 
extent of Mobley’s  damages.   
On March 3, 2010, Kimura answered, also alleging  Mobley’s 
complaint was barred by HRS § 431:10C.  Kimura also filed a 
third-party complaint against Espaniola, which was not served 
until September 24, 2010.
  Ching, Kimura, and Espaniola then 
filed claims against each other, but  Mobley did not “amend over” 
to assert a direct claim against Espaniola.6   
On June 13, 2011, Kimura moved to continue the original 
September 12, 2011 trial date, which had been set before 
                                                           
6  HRCP Rule 14(a) (2000) provides in part that “ [t]he plaintiff may 
assert any claim against the third -party defendant arising out of the 
transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim 
against the third- party plaintiff, and the  third-party defendant thereupon 
shall assert any defenses as provided  in Rule 12 and any counterclaims and 
cross-claims as provided in  Rule 13.” ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
11 
 Espaniola appeared as a party.  T he circuit court extended the 
trial week to April 16, 2012, and  vacated all previous  
deadlines.  
b. Kimura and Espaniola’s motions for summary 
judgment  
 
i.  Kimu ra’s motion for summary judgment 
 On September 29, 2011, Kimura moved for summary judgment,  
alleging Mobley failed to satisfy the tort threshold exception 
of HRS § 431:10C-306(b)(4) with respect to the 2008 accident 
(“MSJ”).  Kimura cited 
Parker v. Nakaoka, 68 Haw. 557, 722 P.2d 
1028 (1986), and Walsh v. Chan, 80 Hawai ʻi 188, 907  P.2d 774 
(App. 1995), rev’d on other grounds, 80 Hawaiʻi 212, 908 P.2d 
1198 (1995), discussed in Section IV.A below.  Kimura contended 
there was no evidence Mobley received PIP benefits to satisfy 
the tort threshold.  To her motion, Kimura attached  the 
complaint, the third- party complaint, Mobley’s amended answers 
to interrogatories, and a declaration from Ku ʻulei Aina (“Aina 
Declaration”), Mobley’s  GEICO no- fault claims representative for 
the 2008 accident.  The Aina Declaration stated that “as of the 
date of this Declaration [September 26, 2011],” no PIP benefits 
had been paid on behalf of Mobley.   
Mobley’s amended answers to interrogatories, on the other 
hand, contained the following response: 
The following represents the total amount of medical 
expenses incurred by Plaintiff Gary Mobley as the result of ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
12 
 the motor vehicle accident on June 8, 2005 and in the motor 
vehicle accident on January 12, 2008:  
 
Tripler Army Medical Center    $3,976.12
Hawaii Diagnostic Fluoroscopy      $900.00
Dr. Chai Health Center     $3,634.80
Dr. Simon Kim, MD        $216.02
Kaimuki Chirop tactic [sic] Center  $2,260.00
First Physical & Functional Rehab   $2,490.72
TOTAL:          $13,477.66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Formatting altered.)  Kimura argued that under Celotex Corp. v. 
Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986), HRCP Rule 56(c) (2000) 
mandated entry of summary judgment,  after an adequate time for 
discovery, against a party who fails to make a showing 
sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to 
that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden 
of proof at trial.7  As such, Kimura asserted Mobley could not 
prove he met the tort threshold or significant permanent loss of 
use exceptions to the abolition of tort liability, making 
summary judgment proper. 
Kimura did not present any evidence regarding the 
significant permanent loss of use exception.  
ii.  Espaniola’s motion for partial summary 
judgment  
 
On September 30, 2011, Espaniola moved for partial summary 
judgment also based on Mobley’s alleged failure to satisfy the 
tort threshold exception under HRS § 431:10C-306(b)(4)  (“MPSJ”) .  
Espaniola also joined Kimura’s MSJ.  In addition to asserting 
                                                           
7  We rejected this ruling of Celotex in Ralston.  129 Hawaiʻi at 62, 292 
P.3d at 1292.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
13 
 arguments similar to Kimura, Espaniola cited to Ho v. Leftwich, 
88 Hawaiʻ i 251, 965 P.2d 793 (1998), also discussed in Section 
IV.A below.   
Like Kimura, Espaniola did not submit any evidence 
regarding the significant permanent loss of use
 exception.  
iii. Mobley’s  consolidated oppositio n memorandum  
Mobley filed a consolidated memorandum oppos ing Kimura’s 
MSJ and Espaniola’s  MPSJ.8  He contended he met the significant 
permanent loss of use exception of  HRS § 431:10C- 306(b)(2), 
alleging there was a genuine issue of material fact created by 
his inability to run or march with his students at work.  In 
support, Mobley attached an independent medical evaluation 
(“IME”) report and letter written by Dr. Peter Diamond (“Dr. 
Diamond”) (collectively, “Dr. Diamond’s documents”) .  Dr. 
Diamond’s documents  were attached to a declaration in which 
Mobley’s counsel attested  as to their authenticity.  
Substantively, Dr. Diamond’s letter stated, “ [a]s regards Mr. 
Mobley’s inability to run or march with the students, this would 
represent a significant, and likely permanent functional loss. ”  
Dr. Diamond’s IME report also provided a chronology of Mobley’s 
treatment by the providers listed in his amended answers to 
interrogatories.  In  both the letter and the IME report, Dr. 
                                                           
8  Ching filed state ments of no position as to both Kimura’s and 
Espaniola’s motions.   ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
14 
 Diamond indicated his opinions were expressed to a reasonable 
degree of medical probability.  Dr. Diamond also apportioned 
Mobley’s injuries as 50% secondary to the 2005 accident and 50% 
to the 2008 accident.  
Then, in a supplemental memorandum, Mobley assert ed he also 
satisfied the tort threshold exception of                     
HRS § 431:10C-306(b)(4).  
He stated he had filed a PIP claim 
with GEICO to pay for medical treatments for  the 2008 accident, 
but that GEICO had denied all payments and that an arbitration 
decision was pending.  He stated his medical service providers 
had billed GEICO for treatment provided in the 2008 accident.  
He also contended that 
[i]f the arbitrator orders GEICO to make payments, then 
several thousands of dollars in PIP payments will be made 
in Mr. Mobley’s second accident PIP file.  Ms. Aina’s 
declaration . . . may mislead the Court as it gives the 
appearance that not only were no bills paid but also that 
no treatment services were provided to Mr. Mobley under the 
second accident PIP file.  The Court should be aware that 
Mr. Mobley did in fact treat his injuries from the second 
accident and those bills were submitted to GEICO PIP claims 
for payment.  
 
(Footnote omitted.)  In support, he attached a letter dated 
October 17, 2011, from a GEICO staff attorney, which  confirmed 
that an arbitration hearing had taken place on June 3, 2011, 
regarding Mobley’s PIP payments from the 2008 accident but that 
the arbitration decision was still pending.

 iv. Kimura and Espaniola’s repl ies 
 In her reply, Kimura argued  Mobley had not presented 
evidence to establish he had “incurred” PIP benefits of $5,000 
or that GEICO had paid any PIP benefits.  
Kimura also argued Parker , discussed in Section IV.A below, 
permits a court to rule on the significant permanent loss of use 
exception before trial, and that “pain” that precludes  running 
or marching does not qualify under that exception.9  Kimura also 
attached Mobley’s May 3, 2011 deposition  to her reply .  In the 
deposition, Mobley testified at length regarding injuries from 
the 2008 accident, including neck and back pain, headaches, and 
numbness; that he was not running at all; that driving became 
harder because it hurt to bend his neck and head;  and that it 
had become difficult to sit or perform physical activities with 
his students.  Kimura argued Mobley had been unable to specify 
whether he stopped running and marching before or after the 2008 
accident.  Kimura argued that if Mobley’s pain while running or  
marching qualified as a significant permanent loss of use, 
however, 
“practically any injury” would fall into th at 
exception, which would defeat the purpose of Hawai ʻi’s no-fault 
law.  
                                                           
9  Kimura also cited Licari v. Elliot, 441 N.E.2d 1088 (N.Y. 1982), a case 
Parker cited in its holding that trial judges are not precluded from 
determining whether a plaintiff met the threshold requirement, which is also 
discussed in Section IV.A  below. ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 Kimura did not contest the admissibility of Dr. Diamond’s 
documents attached to Mobley’s  consolidated opposition 
memorandum. 
 In his October 21, 2011 reply, Espaniola argued Dr. 
Diamond’s documents were not admissible in evidence, as Mobley’s 
counsel was not competent to lay a foundation as to Dr. 
Diamond’s documents .  Further,  he argued that even if Dr. 
Diamond’s documents were  admissible, Mobley’s injuries did not 
constitute the kind of “significant permanent loss of use of a 
part or function of the body ” the Hawai ʻi legislature sought to 
exempt from tort liability.   
 As to the tort threshold exception, Espaniola argued no PIP 
benefits had been paid on behalf of Mobley for the 2008 
accident.  Espaniola argued Mobley stated “several thousands of 
dollars in PIP payments will be made,” but failed to meet the 
specific requirement of a minimum of $5,000.  Espaniola argued 
Mobley “clearly [knew] exactly how much he is alleging is due 
pursuant to the alleged injuries arising out of [the 2008 
accident], but fails to state what that amount is.”   
   v . Circuit court’s oral ruling  
 On October 26, 2011, the circuit court10 held a hearing on  
Kimura’s MSJ and Espaniola’s MPSJ.  When the circuit court asked 
                                                           
10  The Honorable Rom A. Trader presided.   ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 Mobley’s counsel
 whether he was maintaining that Mobley 
qualified under the
 tort threshold exception,  Mobley’s counsel  
stated he was “conced[ing] that point.”11  
The circuit court questioned the admissibility of Dr. 
Diamond’s documents.  The circuit court ruled that Dr. Diamond’s 
documents were inadmissible through Mobley’s counsel’s 
declaration, citing to Pacific Concrete Federal Credit Union v. 
Kauanoe, 62 Haw. 334, 614 P.2d 936 (1980) (holding  that facts 
set forth in summary judgment motion affidavits must be 
admissible in evidence) , and Nakato v. Macharg, 89 Hawai ʻi 79, 
969 P.2d 824 (App. 1998) (holding that exhibits attached to a 
summary judgment motion must be authenticated by and attached to 
an affidavit of a person through 
whom the exhibits could be 
admitted into evidence) .   
                                                           
11  Mobley brought to the circuit court’s attention this court’s October 4, 
2011 opinion in Ahn v. Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co., 126 Hawaiʻi 1, 265 P.3d 
470 (2011), which held that insureds are real parties in interest in actions 
against insurers for PIP benefits, overruling a prior decision holding 
otherwise except for an insurer’s non -payment of PIP benefits required to 
meet the tort threshold, for which the insured qualified as a real party in 
interest.    
 
Mobley raised Ahn to argue insurance companies were  denying PIP 
benefits to their insureds, and that he was pursuing  arbitration against 
GEICO for payment of PIP benefits for the 2008 accident, (see 1SP101000121 in 
the circuit court, in which on April 15, 2010, another circuit court judge 
granted Mobley’s petition for appointment of an arbitrator and appointed 
Donald Fisher as arbitrator), stating that a favorable outcome would result 
in a “minimum of [$]3,500” in PIP benefits payable for the 2008 accident.  
However, Mobley’s counsel  then again orally conceded a failure to meet the  
tort threshold exception for the 2008 accident.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
18 
 Mobley’s counsel orally requested a HRCP Rule 56(f) 
continuance to have Dr. Diamond testify as to the opinions in 
his documents.  The circuit court ruled, however, that Mobley 
did not meet the HRCP Rule 56(f) requirement that a party show 
why the evidence could not be presented by the time of the 
hearing.  The circuit court orally granted Kimura’s MS J and 
Espaniola’s MPSJ.   
 
 vi. Motion for r econsideration, etc. 
On January 18, 2012, Mobley filed a motion for 
reconsideration of the circuit court’s  October 26, 2011 oral 
orders, now attaching an affidavit from Dr. Diamond opining that 
due to Mobley’s
 injuries and inability to march or run with his 
students, it appeared to a reasonable degree of medical 
probability that Mobley had
 suffered “a significant , and likely 
permanent functional loss ” because of the injuries sustained in 
the 2008 accident.  Mobley asserted the circuit court had 
applied erroneous summary judgment and evidentiary standards.  
In the alternative, Mobley requested a HRCP Rule 54(b ) 
certification to allow an interlocutory appeal.  Instead, the 
circuit court12 filed orders  granting Kimura’s MSJ and denying 
Mobley’s HRCP Rule 56(f) request  on February 6, 2012, denying

 Mobley’s motion for r econsideration  on February 14, 2012, and 
granting Espaniola’s MPSJ On February 17, 2012.   
After Mobley’s October 2012 jury trial for h is claims 
against Ching,13 on March 6, 2013, the circuit court entered its 
judgment, and Mobley timely appealed to the ICA.14  
2. ICA proceedings15 
 On appeal, M obley contended the circuit court erred when it 
granted Kimura’s MSJ and Espaniola’s MPSJ. 
 On August 15, 2019, the ICA  filed its memorandum opinion.  
Mobley v. Ching, No. CAAP-12-0001090 (App. Aug. 15, 2019) 
(mem.).  In relevant part, the ICA concluded the circuit court 
                                                           
13  The April 2012 trial week was further continued to October 16, 2012, 
when Mobley proceeded to a jury trial on his claims against Ching, the 
remaining defendant.  Various fact and medical experts testified.  At the 
conclusion of Mobley’s case, Ching moved to strike  the testimonies of 
Mobley’s medical experts on the grounds their testimonies had not been 
rendered to a reasonable degree of medical probability.  On October 19, 2012, 
the circuit court orally granted this motion.  Ching then immediately orally 
moved for a HRCP Rule 50 judgment as a matter of law (“JMOL”).   Based on its 
striking of the medical experts ’ testimonies, th e circuit court ruled there 
was no evidence regarding causation and insufficient foundation for Exhibit 
47 regarding PIP payments that had previously been admitted in evidence, 
which alternatively meant that the tort threshold had not been met against 
Ching, which meant jurisdiction was lacking, and granted the motion for JMOL.  
On January 29, 2013, Mobley moved for a new trial, directed verdict on 
causation and/or reconsideration.  On April 23, 2013, the circuit court 
orally denied Mobley’s motion.  
  
14  In addition to the issues we currently address on certiorari,  Mobley 
also appealed the circuit court’s trial rulings and grant of JMOL in favor of 
Ching to the ICA.  See  Ching, mem. op. at 1- 2, n.1.  Generally, Mobley also 
argued error in the circuit court’s rulings regarding the requirement of 
“reasonable medical probability” testimony and the grant of the motion for 
JMOL.  See id. 
  
15  Only issues relevant to this certiorari proceeding are discussed.  See 
supra notes 11 and 14.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 erred in granting Kimura’s  MSJ and Espaniola’s MPSJ regarding 
the 2008 accident.  Ching, mem. op. at 8.   
 In reaching its conclusion, the ICA relied on this court’s 
burden shifting paradigm in Ralston .  Ching , mem. op. at 9.  The 
ICA observed that in cases in which the non- moving party bears 
the burden of proof at trial, Ralston set forth a burden 
shifting paradigm in which the moving party may fulfill the 
initial burden on summary judgment of demonstrating there is no 
genuine issue of material fact by either 
“(1) presenting evidence negating an element of the non -
movant’s claim, or (2) demonstrating that the non -movant 
will be unable to carry [their] burden of proof at trial.”  
Ralston v. Yim, 129 Hawaiʻ i 46, 56 -57, 60, 292 P.3d 1276, 
1286-87, 1290 (2013) (quoting and citing French v. Hawai ʻi 
Pizza Hut, Inc., 105 Hawaiʻ i 462, 470, 472, 99 P.3d 1046, 
1054, 1056 (2004)).  In regards to the latter method, the 
movant “must show not only that the non -movant has not 
placed proof in the record, but also that the movant will 
be unable to offer proof at trial.”  Id. at 60-61, 292 P.3d 
at 1290- 91 (emphasis omitted)  (citing French, 105 Hawai ʻi at 
472, 99 P.3d at 1056).  This consideration is contingent 
upon whether discovery has concluded or not.  See  id. at 
61, 292 P.3d at 1291 (“[I]n general, a summary judgment 
movant cannot merely point to the non -moving party’s lack 
of evidence to support its initial burden of production if 
discovery has not concluded .” (emphasis added) (citing 
French, 105 Hawai ʻi at 472, 99 P.3d at 1056)).  
 
Id. (second alteration in original).  The ICA  noted discovery 
had not yet closed when the circuit court held its October 26, 
2011 hearing on Kimura’s MSJ and Espaniola’s  MPSJ.  Ching, mem.

21 
 of Hawai
ʻi (“RCCH”)  Rule 12(r) (2007),16 the ICA stated discovery 
would not have been cut off until February 16, 2012.  Id. 
As to the tort threshold exception of  
HRS § 431:10C-306(b)(4), the ICA concluded the circuit court 
erred in granting Espaniola’s MPSJ as it was “premature”  because 
“evidence had not established that Mobley could not demonstrate 
satisfaction of [HRS § 431:10C-306(b)(4)] at the time of trial .”  
Ching, mem. op. at 8.  Noting that although the circuit court’s 
“only explanation” in concluding Mobley did not meet the tort 
threshold exception of HRS § 431:10C-306(b)(4) was that Mobley 
conceded he did not meet the threshold, the ICA also noted that, 
in moving for summary judgment, the only support Kimura and 
Espaniola offered was the Aina Declaration, which stated no PIP 
benefits had been paid to Mobley for the 2008 accident .  Ching , 
mem. op. at 10.  The ICA reasoned that “[a]lthough it may be 
correct that Mobley had not met [HRS § 431:10C- 306(b)(4)] at the 
time of the hearing on the summary judgment motions, this does 
not establish that Mobley would be unable to prove that he could 
meet the threshold at the time of trial as discovery had not yet 
concluded when the Circuit Court granted summary judgment and 
partial summary judgment.”   Ching, mem. op. at 11.  Therefore, 
citing Ralston, the ICA concluded Kimura and Espaniola did not

assigned trial date.” ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
22 (continued. . .)  
 satisfy their initial burden of production, and the circuit 
court erred in granting summary judgment in their favor because 
a genuine issue of fact existed as to whether Mobley could meet 
HRS § 431:10C-306(b)(4).  Id. 
The ICA also concluded the circuit court erred in granting 
Kimura’s MSJ and Espaniola’s MPSJ based on Mobley’s alleged 
failure to satisfy the significant permanent loss of use 
exception of HRS § 431:10C-306(b)(2).  Id.  As in its analysis 
of HRS § 431:10C-306(b)(4), the ICA concluded that although 
Mobley may not have met the “exception under HRS section 
431:10C-306(b)(2) when the defendants moved for summary 
judgment, this does not establish that Mobley would have been 
unable to prove at trial that he met the threshold,” citing 
Ralston.  Ching, mem. op. at 12.  Thus, the ICA concluded Kimura 
and Espaniola failed to carry their initial burden of 
production, and the circuit cour t erred in granting Kimura’s MSJ  
and Espaniola’s MPSJ.17  Id.  
                                                           
17  The ICA also concluded the circuit court erred in awarding JMOL at 
trial in the 2005 accident case.  See Ching, mem. op. at 12 -23.  
Specifically, the ICA concluded: (1) the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion when it considered Ching’s motion to strike Mobley’s medical 
experts’ testimonies; (2) the circuit court did not abuse its discretion when 
it determined Dr. Kientz did not testify to a “reasonable medical 
probability,” but did abuse its discretion when it determined Dr. Kaan failed 
to express his opinion to that same standard and (3) the circuit court did 
not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit Dr. Kaan’s report at trial on 
the basis that it was cumulative and was contrary to the circuit court’s 
ruling on a prior motion in limine.  Id.   Because of its rulings, the ICA did 
not address Mobley’s remaining point s of error .  Ching, m em. op. at 12, 17, 
23, 24. ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
23 
 The ICA therefore vacated the circuit court’s  judgment, 
reinstated Mobley’s claims as to both the 2005 and 2008 
accidents, and remanded the case to the circuit court for 
further proceedings consistent with its decision.  Ching, m em. 
op. at 24.  On August 29, 2019, the ICA filed its j udgment on 
appeal. 
3. Certiorari a pplication  
 Espaniola  presents  two questions on certiorari, summarized 
as follows: 
1. Did the ICA err in ruling the circuit c ourt erred  in 
granting Espaniola’s motion for partial summary judgment  
based on Mobley’s failure to satisfy the tort threshold ? 
 
2. Did the ICA err in ruling that the c ircuit c ourt’s 
grant of Espaniola’s motion for partial summary judgment  
was premature because evidence had not established that, by 
the time of trial, Mobley would not be able to demonstrate 
satisfaction of the tort threshold or prove that his injury 
constitutes , in whole or in part , a significant permanent 
loss of use of a part or function of the body ? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                          
(. . .continued)  
In discussing whether medical experts should state their conclusions to 
a “reasonable medical probability” or “reasonable medical certainty,” the ICA 
cited several cases from other jurisdictions.  Ching, mem. op. at 15 (citing 
Moses v. Drake, 109 A.3d 562, 558 (Del. 2015); Griffin v. Univ. of Pittsburgh 
Med. Ctr.- Braddock Hosp., 950 A.2d 996, 1000 (Pa. Super Ct. 2008).  In 
Bachran v. Morishige, 52 Haw. 61, 469 P.2d 808 (1970), this court has also 
stated that “for the purpose of apportioning damages between two accidents, 
there is no necessity that an expert witness’ testimony be limited or 
restricted by labels such as ‘certainty,’ ‘reasonable medical certainty,’ 
‘probability,’ ‘possibility,’ etc.”  52 Haw. at 67, 469 P.2d at 812.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 III.  Standards of review
 
A. Summary judgment 
The circuit court’s grant or denial of summary judgment is 
reviewed de novo.  Ralston, 129 
Hawaiʻi at 55, 292 P.3d at 1285.  
Furthermore, 
[S]ummary  judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on 
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there 
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the 
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  A 
fact is material if proof of that fact would have the 
effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential 
elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the 
parties.  The evidence must be viewed in the light most 
favorable to the non- moving party.   In other words, we must 
view all of the evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in 
the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.  
 
129 Hawaiʻ i at 55- 56, 292 P.3d at 1285- 86 (alteration in 
original).  Ralston also provides:  
In sum, this court's case law indicates that a 
summary judgment movant may satisfy [their] initial burden 
of production by either (1) presenting evidence negating an 
element of the non -movant's claim, or (2) demonstrating 
that the nonmovant will be unable to carry [their] burden 
of proof at trial.   Where the movant attempts to meet 
[their] burden through the latter means, [they] must show 
not only that the non -movant has not placed proof in the 
record, but also that the  movant will be  unable to offer 
proof at trial .  Accordingly, in general, a summary 
judgment movant cannot merely point to the non -moving 
party's lack of evidence to support [their] initial burden 
of production if discovery has not concluded.   (“[M]erely 
asserting that the non -moving party has not come forward 
with evidence to support its claims is not enough.”).   
 
129 Hawai ʻi at 60- 61, 292 P.3d at 1290- 91 (last alteration in 
original) (citations omitted). 
B. Statutory interpretation  
Statutory interpretation is reviewed de novo by [the 
appellate] court.  When construing a statute, our foremost 
obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the intention ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
25 (continued. . .)  
 of the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from 
the language contained in the statute itself.  Moreover, it 
is a cardinal rule of statutory interpretation that, where 
the terms of a statute are plain, unambiguous and explicit, 
we are not at liberty to look beyond that language for a 
different meaning.  Instead, our sole duty is to give 
effect to the statute's plain and o
bvious meaning.

IV. Discussion 
A. Nature of the exceptions to the abolition of tort 
liability in HRS § 431:10C- 306(b) 
 
 According to HRS § 431:10C- 306, Mobley was required to  
satisfy one of the exceptions to the abolition of tort liability
in HRS § 431:10C-306(b) quoted in Section II.A above.  18 
                                                           
18  Before enacting HRS Chapter 294, the predecessor to HRS Chapter 
431:10C, the Hawaiʻi legislative  auditor had found , in relevant part , in a 
study of Hawaiʻ i’s motor vehicle liability insurance system , that: (1) 
relatively minor losses were being overcompensated, serious injuries were  
being undercompensated, and many automobile accident victims were not being 
compensated at all; (2) due to the high administrative costs and legal 
expenses underlying the adversary procedure, victims received only a fraction 
of the benefits; (3 ) there were long delays in receiving benefits due to the 
“machinery” of the fault -finding process, with an average claim being settled 
between nine and twelve months; (4 ) there was duplication among the 
liability, medical,
 wage loss,  and property damage compensation systems; and 
(5) the
 costs of obtaining automobile liability insurance were high and  
continually rising.  Parker, 68 Haw. at 558- 59, 722 P.2d at 1029
-30 (citing 
Legislative Auditor, A Study of Hawaii’s  Motor Vehicle Insurance Program  5 
(1972)). 
 
The legislature enacted HRS Chapter 294 “to create a system of 
reparations for accidental harm and loss arising from motor vehicle 
accidents, to compensate these damages without regard to fault, and to limit 
tort liability for these accidents .”  1973 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 203, § 1 at 
381.  It stated 
 
[e]lements  of the old tort system have been retained for 
the serious cases involving death, disfigurement, and when 
medical- rehabilitative expenses reach a certain ‘threshold’ 
amount set by the insurance commissioner.  Any person whose ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 In Ho, construing a prior version of HRS § 431:10C- 306, 
this court upheld the trial court’s grant of  the defendant’s 
motion for directed verdict at the end of the plaintiff’s case, 
holding: 
Because Ho neither presented (1) evidence that the 
medical expenses that she claimed in her motor vehicle tort 
lawsuit against  Leftwich were paid, thereby triggering the 
statutory presumption that they were reasonable and 
necessary, nor (2) expert testimony establishing that the 
expenses were reasonable and necessary, we hold that she 
did not satisfy the minimum level of qualifying expenses 
necessary to maintain her action pursuant to the provisions 
of HRS § 431:10C –306. 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                          
(. . .continued)  
expenses exceed that threshold  within the statute of 
limitations may sue for recovery.  The threshold is set at 
a level to ensure that approximately 90 per cent of such 
cases are resolved by the no -fault system.  
 
1983 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 245 , § 1 at 519.  
  
HRS § 294- 6 was revised and recodified in HRS § 431:10C -306.  1987 Haw. 
Sess. Laws Act 347, § 2 at 148, 167.  Both HRS § 294-6 and  
HRS § 431:10C- 306 sought to abolish tort liability for accidental harm 
arising from motor vehicle  accidents, limiting tort liability to specific 
situations.  See 1973 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 203 , § 1 at 381 (“The purpose of 
this chapter is to create a system of reparations for accidental harm and 
loss arising from motor vehicle accidents, to compensate these damages 
without regard to fault, and to limit tort liability for these accidents”); 
1974 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 168, § 1 at 317 ( repeating the  purpose as stated in  
1973); 1983 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 245, § 1 at 521 (“[T]he purpose of this Act 
is to expressly restate, reiterate, and clarify the intent of the legislature 
in enacting sections 294 -6(a) and 294- 36(b), Hawaii Revised Statutes, 
concerning the barring of suits by uninsured  motorists for injuries sustained 
in motor vehicle accidents was originally, and is now: (1) To prevent a 
person who is ineligible for no -fault benefits from bringing a civil action 
if the medical rehabilitative limit is not reached within two years of the  
dates of the motor vehicle accident”); 1987 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 347, § 2  at 1 
(“[T]he legislature hereby declares that the purpose of this chapter is to 
recodify, without substantive change, the insurance law in effect immediately 
prior to the effective d ate of this chapter.”);  1987 Haw. Sess. Laws  Act 347,

reparations for accidental harm and loss arising from motor vehicle

In Parker, a post- jury trial case, this court, construing 
HRS § 294-6, stated: 
Although the no- fault law is silent on this point, 
the scheme and objec tives of the law suggest that meeting 
[a] threshold requirement is an essential condition and 
element of [a plaintiff’s] claim.  [The plaintiff] is the 
one who has personal knowledge and information  as to 
whether the threshold condition is met.  Therefore, it 
stands to reason that  in order to achieve fairness and 
efficiency in implementing the objectives of the law, [the 
plaintiff] should have the burden of proving that the claim 
is one that has escaped the general abolition of tort 
liability decreed by HRS § 294 -6. 
 
. . . . 
  
Allegations alone are not sufficient to meet the threshold 
requirements.   Appellee must carry the burden of proving 
that her injury meets or exceeds the threshold requirement 
in question.  
   . . . . 
 
Hawaii's no -fault law does not give any guidance as 
to whether the  judge, as a matter of law, should determine 
if the threshold requirement had been met, or whether the 
jury should determine that question.   We hold that whether 
Appellee met the threshold requirement is for the jury to 
determine inasmuch as the facts relating to Appellee's 
injury are in dispute and reasonable minds could differ on 
whether Appellee sustained an injury which consists, in 
whole or in part, in a significant permanent loss of use of 
a part or function of her bod y. 
 
This is not to say, however, that a trial judge is 
precluded from determining, as a matter of law, whether a 
plaintiff met the threshold requirement. When the evidence 
is so clear that reasonable minds could only come to one 
conclusion, it is not error for the trial judge to remove 
the threshold question from the jury and to determine that 
question as a matter of law . 
 
As to Appellant's proposed special verdict 
interrogatory number 5, we hold that the trial court erred 
in refusing to submit the proposed interrogatory to the 
jury in view of our holding that the threshold requirement 
is a necessary  condition and element of Appellee's cause of 
action.  It is essential that the triers of fact make a 
finding that Appellee did in fact sustain an injury which 
consists, in whole or in part, in a significant permanent 
loss of use of a part or function of her body in order for ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

 Appellee to maintain her negligence tort claim against 
Appellant.

(emphases added) (internal 
citations and quotation marks omitted).    
In Walsh, also construing a previous version of          
HRS § 431:10C-306(b), the ICA stated: 
The intent of the legislature in establishing the 
medical- rehabilitative limit in the no -fault law was to 
provide a jurisdictional requirement similar to the then 
$10,000 jurisdictional amount in diversity suits in the  
federal court: “In order to maintain an action, the 
claimant must show that the amount in controversy exceeds 
$5,000 (this amount being intended by your committee to be 
a jurisdictional requirement similar to the $10,000 
jurisdictional requirement in fede ral diversity suits).” 
Hse.Stand.Comm.Rep. No. 187, 1973 House Journal, at 837.  
 
80 Hawai ʻi at 192, 907 P.2d at 778.  The ICA ruled that 
because 
the plaintiff had introduced in evidence medical-rehabilitative 
expenses well exceeding the $7,600 in “paid or accrued” medical -
rehabilitative expenses in effect at the relevant time, the 
circuit court erred in entering judgment in favor of the 
defendant on the grounds the jury awarded less than that 
amount.19  Id. 
Finally, in Savini v. Univ.  of Haw., 113 Hawai ʻi 459, 153 
P.3d 1144 (2007), this court ruled that a plaintiff ’s claim, if 
brought under the tort threshold exception, does not accrue 
                                                           
19  At that time, HRS § 431:10C- 306(b)(2) provided that tort liability is 
not abolished where “[i]njury occurs to such person in a motor vehicle 
accident in which the amount paid or accrued exceeds the medical -
rehabilitative limit established  in section 431:10C –308 for expenses provided 
in section 431:10C– 103(10)(A) and (B) ; provided that the expenses paid shall 
be presumed to be reasonable and necessary in establishing the medical -
rehabilitative limit[.]”  As discussed by the ICA in its memorandum opinion 
in this case, this language differs from the current HRS § 431:10C -306(b)(4). ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
29 
 until the plaintiff meets that threshold, holding  that “under 
Hawaiʻi law, a plaintiff who relies on the medical- expense 
threshold as opposed to a verbal threshold,[20] . . . has no claim 
at all . . . until the plaintiff has actually received the 
requisite amount of ‘reasonably necessary’ medical -
rehabilitative treatment, as manifested through bills received 
or paid.”  113 Hawaiʻi at 465, 153 P.3d at 1150 (emphasis added).  
The tort threshold exception of HRS § 431:10C-306(b) at the time 
provided: 
(b) Tort liability is not abolished as to the following 
persons . . . in the following circumstances:  
 
. . . . 
 
(2) Injury occurs to such person in a motor vehicle
accident in which the amount paid or accrued exceeds the 
medical- rehabilitative limit established in  
[HRS § ] 431:10C –308 for expenses provided in  
[HRS § ] 431:10C –103(10)(A) and (B)[ (concerning personal
injury protection benefits) ]

113 Hawai ʻi at 461 n.2, 153 P.3d at 1146 n.2 (alterations in 
original). 
Savini stated that “HRS § 431:10C -306 enables, indeed 
requires, would-be plaintiffs to ‘wait and see’ whether their 
expenses will be great enough to shift responsibility to another 
party.”  113 Hawai ʻi at 466, 153 P.3d at 1151.  This court stated 
                                                           
20  Savini described the “verbal threshold” as HRS § 431:10C -306(b)(1), 
(2), and (3) (Supp. 2001), in which “sufficiently serious and permanent 
injuries (or death) are deemed to trigger tort liability without proof that 
the monetary threshold has been exceeded.”  113 Hawaiʻi at 462 n.4, 153 P.3d 
at 1147 n.4.

 this was necessary to effectuate the legislature’s intent to 
abolish most motor vehicle tort lawsuits.  113 Hawaiʻi at 465, 
153 P.3d at 1150.  Savini  also stated:  
In sum, construing HRS §§ 431:10C –306(b)(2) (1993) 
and 431:10C –315(b) so as to postpone “accrual”  of claims 
based upon the medical -rehabilitative limit is necessary to 
effectuate the legislature's “aboli[tion]” of most motor 
vehicle tort lawsuits.  For a plaintiff to sue based on the 
mere expectation that expenses might  exceed the medical -
rehabilitative threshold would be to pursue a claim that 
the legislature has expressly abolished.   Moreover, the 
possibility of an eventually ripe claim does not justify a 
premature complaint: not even the best expert witness can 
ensure that such an inchoate claim will accrue before the 
plaintiff convalesces or dies due to causes unrelated to 
the alleged tort.  
 
. . . .  
 
We recognize that today's holding might inconvenience 
future parties who would prefer to litigate early under 
circumstances where it is virtually certain that the 
plaintiff's injuries will give rise to medical expenses 
over $5,000.00 (the current threshold, see               
HRS § 431:10C –306(b)(4) (2005)), but will not do so until 
considerable time has elapsed.  Such a scenario would be 
exceptional and  capable of amelioration by the legislature.  
 
113 Hawaiʻ i at 466-67 , 153 P.3d at 1151-52  (footnote  omitted).   
 Under this backdrop, we address the issues on certiorari. 
B. The ICA correctly ruled the circuit court erred in granting 
Espaniola’s MPSJ, but it erred in applying the second 
Ralston prong to Espaniola’s MPSJ to the extent it was 
based on Mobley’s alleged failure to meet the tort 
threshold ; rather, Espaniola failed to meet his burden 
under the first Ralston prong  
 
This section addresses Espaniola’s assertions with respect 
to the tort threshold exception.   
Pursuant to Ralston,  quoted in Section III .A above, 
Espaniola had the option of either (1) putting forth evidence 
negating an element of Mobley’s claim , or (2) demonstrating ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
31 
 Mobley could not carry his burden of proof at trial.  Espaniola 
argues he met his initial burden of production by satisfying the 
first Ralston prong , namely, by “presenting evidence negating an 
element of the non- movant’s claim.”   
As discussed in Section IV .A, when a plaintiff’s claim is 
based on the tort threshold exception, pursuant to Walsh and 
Savini, meeting the threshold is a jurisdictional requirement to 
the filing of a lawsuit.21  The ICA ruled, however,  that 
Espaniola could not obtain summary judgment on the tort 
threshold exception even if he had met a movant ’s burden under 
the first Ralston prong.  Espaniola moved for summary judgment 
based on the first prong by introducing evidence that GEICO had 
not paid any PIP benefits for the 2008 accident.  According to 
language within the ICA ’s memorandum opinion , however, the 
circuit court was required to wait until trial to ascertain 
whether Mobley could meet the tort threshold exception .   
                                                           
21  HRS § 431:10C- 315(b) (2005) governs the statute of limitations for 
lawsuits arising out of motor vehicle accidents, and accordingly extends the 
limitations period for filing a lawsuit as follows:  
 
(b) No suit arising out of a motor vehicle accident 
shall be brought in tort more than the later of:  
 
. . . . 
 
(2) Two years after the date of the last 
payment of motor vehicle insurance or optional 
additional benefits; or  
(3) Two years after the date of the  last 
payment of workers' compensation or public assistance 
benefits arising from the motor vehicle accident.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
32 Thus, the ICA appears to have conflated the first and 
second Ralston prongs with respect to its tort threshold 
exception analysis.  Because Espaniola only moved for summary 
judgment under the first Ralston prong, the circuit court and 
the ICA should not have considered the second Ralston prong to 
determine whether Mobley would be able to meet his burden at 
trial.22
With respect to the first  Ralston prong upon which 
Espaniola’s MPSJ was based, construing the statutory language of 
the tort threshold exception at that  time, Savini ruled that a 
plaintiff’s claim must have “accrued” under the tort threshold 
exception for a cause of action to exist allowing a lawsuit to 
be filed.  We turn now to address whether Espaniola actually met 
his burden under the first Ralston prong by presenting evidence 
negating an element of Mobley’s claim.  
To satisfy the first Ralston prong, Espaniola was required 
to present evidence negating that Mobley met the tort threshold.  
In this regard, however, Espaniola presented evidence that GEICO 
had not paid any PIP benefits for the 2008 accident.  In fact, 
Espaniola focuses on the payment of PIP benefits as an exception 
to tort liability.  Yet, as the ICA pointed out, 
22We do not preclude parties from moving for summary judgment under both
the first and second Ralston prongs.  In that case, it would be appropriate 
for courts to consider both prongs.
  Here, however, Espaniola only moved for
should not have considered the requirements of the second  prong.  
 
summary judgment under the first prong, and so the circuit court and the ICA *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
33 HRS § 431:10C-306(b) now states in subsection (b)(4)(A)(i) that 
PIP benefits incurred are to be included in the $5,000 tort 
threshold amount.  
In any event, the record before the circuit court on 
summary judgment showed Mobley had incurred $13,477.66 in 
medical expenses for the June 2005 and January 2008 
accidents.  At the time of summary judgment, there was no 
evidence in the record apportioning that amount between the two 
accidents.  Accordingly, viewing the evidence in the light most 
favorable to Mobley for purposes of the MPSJ, these PIP expenses 
should have been apportioned between the two accidents equally, 
with $6,738.83 attributed to the 2008 accident at issue.  
See Montalvo v. Lapez, 77 Hawai ʻi 282, 297, 884 P.2d 345, 360 
(1994) (explaining that when a rough apportionment between two 
accidents is not possible, damages are apportioned 
equally).  Because this amount was sufficient to meet the tort 
threshold exception, 
the Aina Declaration stating that no PIP 
benefits had been paid to-date for the 2008 accident was 
insufficient to show there was no genuine issue of material 
fact, and thus, summary judgment should not have been granted on 
this basis.  
Therefore, although based on incorrect reasoning, the ICA 
reached the correct result by concluding the circuit court erred ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
34 
 by granting Espaniola’s MPSJ as to HRS § 431:10C- 306(b)(4) ’s 
tort threshold exception.23 
C. The I CA correctly ruled the circuit court ’s grant of 
Espaniola’s MPSJ was premature on the grounds that 
Mobley would be unable to prove that his injury 
constitutes , in whole or in part,  a significant 
permanent loss of use of a part or function of the 
body at the time of trial 
 
 This section addresses the significant permanent loss of 
use exception.  It also addresses another argument raised by 
Espaniola with respect to the significant permanent loss of use 
exception: whether the injuries alleged by Mobley can qualify as 
a significant permanent loss of use of a part or function of the 
body.  
 With respect to the significant permanent loss of use 
exception to the abolition of tort liability, neither Espaniola 
nor Kimura, whose MSJ Espaniola joined, presented any evidence 
to “negate” this exception , as required by the first Ralston 
prong.  Thus, this part of Espaniola’s MPSJ was necessarily 
based on the second Ralston prong.   
                                                           
23  Satisfaction of the tort threshold exception is a jurisdictional 
requirement to the filing of a lawsuit “ similar to the [amount in 
controversy] jurisdictional requirement in federal diversity suits .”  H. 
Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 187,  in 1973 House Journal, at 837.  In a federal 
court, if the “amount in controversy threshold” of 28 U.S.C. 1332 is not met, 
the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, and a complaint must be 
dismissed in its entirety.  Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 514 -15 
(2006).  Likewise, HRCP Rule 12(h)(3) (2000) requires dismissal when subject 
matter jurisdiction is lacking.  See HRCP Rule 12(h)(3) (“Whenever it appears 
by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction 
of the subject matter, the court shall dismissal the action.”).  To the 
extent the circuit court disposed of Mobley’s complaint based on an alleged 
failure to meet the tort threshold, its order should have indicated a 
“dismissal” rather than a “partial summary judgment.”  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
35 
 In Parker, this court stated a plaintiff has the burden of 
proving their injury meets or exceeds the “significant permanent 
loss of use of a part or function of the body.”  68 Haw. at 561, 
722 P.2d at 1031.  Parker  also stated allegations alone are not 
sufficient and that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving an 
exception to the general abolition of tort liability.  Id.  
Parker was a post-trial case, however, and as noted in Section 
IV.A above, this court indicated that the question of whether a 
plaintiff has suffered a significant
 permanent  loss of use of a 
part or function of the body is a jury question to be submitted 
to the jury in a special interrogatory.   
In addition, in Ralston , this court stated that “in 
general, a summary judgment movant cannot merely point to the 
non-moving party’s  lack of evidence to support its initial 
burden of production if discovery has not concluded.”  129 
Hawaiʻi at 61, 29
2 P.3d at 1291.  As discovery had not yet 
concluded as to the significant permanent loss of use exception, 
the ICA correctly analyzed Espan iola’s MPSJ under the second 
Ralston prong.   
Thus, the  ICA correctly ruled that, pursuant to Ralston, 
the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment as to this 
exception to the abolition of tort liability, as neither 
Espaniola nor Kimura had presented any evidence negati ng the 
exception and discovery had not yet concluded.  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
36 
 The circuit court alternatively  ruled that even if Dr. 
Diamond’s documents were considered, Mobley’s injuries, in any 
event, did not constitute injuries that would qualify him for 
the significant permanent loss of use exception.  C iting Licari 
and Falcone v. Branker, 342 A.2d 875 (N.J. Super. Ct. Law Div. 
1975), Parker indicated that judges are not precluded from 
determining, as a matter of law, whether a plaintiff met the 
significant permanent loss of use exception.   68 Haw. at 562, 
722 P.2d at 1031.  As the circuit court alternatively ruled on 
this basis and Espaniola continues to argue the issue, we 
briefly address it. 
In addition to Licari  and Falcone, Parker cited to Murray 
v. Walter,  269 N.W.2d 47 (Minn. 1978),  and Fleet Transport Co. 
v. Holland, 304 S.E.2d 76 (Ga. Ct. App. 1983) , regarding whether 
an injury can qualify as a significant permanent loss of use of 
a part or function of the body.  68 Haw. at 562, 722 P.2d at 
1031.  
The statutory language of t he exceptions discussed in these 
cases differ from the language of HRS § 431:10C- 306(b)(2), which 
provides an exception to the abolition of tort liability for an 
“[i]njury [] which consists, in whole or in part, in a ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

24  In Licari, the  New York Court of Appeals upheld a trial court 
ruling that the personal injuries alleged did not constitute a “serious 
injury” within the meaning of New York’s no -fault law.  441 N.E.2d at 1092-
93.  New York’s no- fault law required a “serious injury” for there to be an 
exception to the abolition of tort liability.  441 N.E.2d at 1090.  “Serious 
injury” was defined as  
 
“a personal injury which results in death; dismemberment; 
significant disfigurement; a fracture; permanent loss of 
use of a body organ, member, function or system; permanent 
consequential limitation of use of a body organ or member; 
significant limitation of use of a body function or system; 
or a medically determined injury or impairment of a non -
permanent nature which prevents the injured person from 
performing substantially all of the material acts which 
constitute such person's usual and customary daily 
activities for not less than ninety days during the one 
hundred eighty days immediately following the occurrence of 
the injury or impairment. ” 
 
Id. (emphases added) ( quoting N.Y. Ins. Law, § 671, subd. 4).  The New York 
Court of Appeals, examining the legislative intent of the no -fault law, held 
that the question of whether a plaintiff suffered a serious injury is not 
always a fact question for the jury.  441 N.E.2d at 1091.  It noted that even 
if the plaintiff’s contention that he suffered a “significant limitation of 
use of a body function or system” was taken in a light most favorable to him, 
the plaintiff did not offer any evidence “as to the extent of the limitation 
of movement.”  441 N.E.2d at 1092.   
 
In Falcone, the New Jersey Superior Court held the plaintiff’s argument 
that the small scars on his nose and knee that resulted from a three -car 
automobile collision were not exempt from New Jersey’s no -fault law as a 
“permanent significant disfigurement.”  34 2 A.2d at 882.  The defendant 
“move[d] for summary judgment dismissing the [plaintiff’s] complaint for 
failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted”; the New Jersey 
Superior Court granted the motion in favor of the defendant.  342 A.2d at 
877, 884.  It found the associated words  of New Jersey’s no -fault law  all 
connoted injuries of a substantial nature; thus, it found the term 
“significant” within the “permanent significant disfigurement” exemption to 
be synonymous with “serious” as used in w orkers’ compensation cases dealing 
with serious disfigurement.  342 A.2d at 880.  
 
In Murray, the Minnesota Supreme Court held a party satisfied the 
“permanent injury” threshold of Minnesota’s no -fault law by pleading and 
proving facts that he suffered “permanent injuries, including but not limited 
to permanent injury to his neck and back.”  269 N.W.2d at 50.  It also held 
that party “met, by means of Dr. Johnson’s testimony, [its] burden of proving 
‘permanent injury.’”  Id.  It also stated, however, that because the opposing 
party failed to argue satisfaction of the “permanent injury” threshold, it 
resulted in a waiver of that issue.  Id.   ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***  
 
38 (continued. . .)  
 Although  the circuit court alternatively ruled that even if 
Dr. Diamond’s documents were considered, Mobley did not suffer a 
“significant permanent loss of use of  a part or function of the 
body” as a matter of law, e ven without Dr. Diamond’s documents, 
based on Mobley’s deposition, the evidence was not  so clear that 
reasonable minds could only come to one conclusion.  A t minimum, 
whether Mobley’s inability to run or march with the students 
presents a genuine issue of material fact on whether Mobley’s 
injuries qualify for the HRS § 431:10C-306(b)(2) exception to 
the abolition of tort liability arising from motor vehicle 
accidents.  Reasonable minds could differ on whether an 
inability to “march” or  “run” is a “significant permanent loss 
of use of a [] function of the body,” if proximately caused by  
the 2008 accident.25  Thus, the circuit court also erred in 
granting Espaniola’s MPSJ on this alternative  basis.26 
                                                                                                                                                                                          
(. . .continued)  
Finally, in Holland, the Georgia Court of Appeals held that the jury 
was properly instructed on whether a plaintiff, who alleged  a “whiplash” type 
of injury but also had preexisting neck and back problems, had  sustained a 
“serious injury” under Georgia’s no -fault law.  304 S.E.2d at 77.   
 
25  The issue was whether the injury alleged could constitute a 
“significant permanent loss of use of a part of function of the body,” not 
whether the injuries alleged were proximately caused by the 2008 accident.  
 
26  The circuit court also abused its discretion by not granting Mobley’s 
request for a HRCP Rule 56(f) continuance to present and then consider 
admissible evidence from Dr. Diamond that Mobley’s inability to march an d run 
was a “significant permanent loss of use of  a part or function of his body.”  
 
HRCP Rule 56(f) provides:  ***     FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER     ***

When Affidavits are Unavailable.  Should it appear from the 
affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party 
cannot for reasons stated presented by affidavit facts 
essential to justify the party’s opposition, the court may 
refuse the application for judgment or may order a 
continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or 
depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make 
such other order as is just.  
 
 In Ralston, we stated, “HRCP Rule 56(f) is the proper procedure to 
request and obtain additional time to respond to a motion for summary 
judgment that is filed prior to the  discovery deadline. ”  129 Hawai ʻi at 62, 
292 P.3d at 1292.  We stated that, “Had Dr. Yim provided a proper expert 
affidavit in support of his motion, Ralston [ ,the non- movant plaintiff ,] 
would have been required to submit his expert’s affidavit or request a  
HRCP Rule 56(f) continuance to allow more time to produce an admissible 
affidavit.”  Id.  In Ralston, we also rejected the ruling in Celotex that 
summary judgment may be appropriate before a discovery deadline if the non -
movant had “adequate time to conduct discovery and to identify experts.”  129 
Hawaiʻi at 62, 292 P.3d at 1292.  In rejecting that ruling, we stated such an 
approach would be inconsistent with French v. Hawaii Pizza Hut, Inc., 105 
Hawaiʻi 462, 99 P.3d 1046 (2004), as “the clear import of French is that 
summary judgment should not be granted when there is still time for the non -
movant to develop evidence for use at trial, unless there is a basis for 
concluding (as was the case in Celotex) that such an effort would be futile.”  
129 Hawaiʻ i at 63, 292 P.3d at 1293.  Further, we stated HRCP Rule 56(f) 
provides non- movants with protection against a premature grant of a motion 
for summary judgment.  Id.  We also noted it was generally recognized that:  
 
The purpose of subdivision (f) is to provide an additional 
safeguard against an improvident or premature grant of 
summary judgment and the rule generally has been applied to 
achieve that objective.   Consistent with this purpose, 
courts have stated that technical rulings have no place 
under the subdivision and that it should be applied with a 
spirit of liberality .

(1998)).  
 
As noted, Mobley did not “amend over” against Espaniola, who Kimura 
impleaded as a third- party defendant regarding the 2008 accident.  Kimura, 
the only party against whom Mobley had a direct claim with respect to the 
2008 accident, did not object to the admissibility of Dr. Diamond’s 
documents.  Although HRCP Rule 14 entitled Espaniola to assert defenses 
available to Kimura against Mobley (“The third -party defendant may assert 
against the plaintiff any defenses which the third -party plaintiff has to the 
plaintiff’s claim. ”), especially because Kimura did not raise the 
admissibility of Dr. Diamond’s documents as an issue, the circuit court 
abused its discretion by denying Mobley’s request for a HRCP Rule 56(f) 
continuance.  Also, although Mobley proposed to bring Dr. Diamond to testify, 
Dr. Diamond would not have had to testify; all that was  required was a

 V. Conclusion 
 Based on the reasons above, w e affirm the ICA’s August 29, 
2019 judgment on appeal, which vacated the circuit court’s March  
6, 2013 judgment and remanded the case for reinstatement of 
Mobley’s claims rel ated to both the 2005 and 2008 accidents, but 
as modified by the analysis in this opinion.

declaration or affidavit from Dr. Diamond to cure the foundational 
deficiency, which Mobley’s counsel was able to obtain after the hearing  and 
presented in his motion for reconsideration.  As indicated above, Mobley was 
able to later secure an admissible affidavit from Dr. Diamond creating a 
genuine issue of material fact as to the significant permanent loss of use 
exception.  But even if Mobley had amended over against Espaniola, the 
circuit court’s refusal of the Rule 56(f) continuance request constituted an 
abuse of discretion.
