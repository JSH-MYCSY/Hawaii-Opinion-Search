MAY 15, 2017  
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J.  
 
This case 
concerns the admissibility of two 
Intoxilyzer Supervisor ’s Sworn Statements to prove that the 
Intoxilyzer used to test Raymond S. Davis ’s breath alcohol 
content was in proper working order.  The State relied on these 
out-of-court statements in establishing the reliability of 
Davis’s breath alcohol test results, which in turn served as a  
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
  
  The State of Hawaiʻ i filed a compl aint  in the District 
Court of the First Circuit (district court), charging that,  on 
March 3, 2012, Raymond S. Davis committed the offense of 
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant 
(OVUII), in violation of Hawaii  Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-
1 61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3)  (Supp. 2011).   At the commencement of the  
2 bench trial,  the State orally arraigned Davis   only under HRS §  
291E-61(a)(3)  for operating or assum  ing actual physical control  
                     
   
 
    
 
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
basis for his conviction for the offense of operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant. We consider whether the 
Intoxilyzer Supervisor’s Sworn Statements were admissible given 
the facts of this case under the Hawaii Rules of Evidence. 
I. BACKGROUND 
1 HRS § 291E -61(a) provides in relevant part: 
A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under 
the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or 
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount 
sufficient to impair the person’s normal mental faculties or ability to care for the person and guard 
against casualty; [or]  
. . . . 
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred 
ten liters of breath . . . . 
HRS § 291E- 61(a) (Supp. 2011).

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway with 
.08 or more grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Davis 
entered a plea of not guilty to the charge. 
The State’s first witness was Officer Russell 
Maeshiro, who testified that on March 3, 2012, around 2:10 a.m., 
he stopped Davis’s car after observing Davis weave in and out of 
marked lanes without using his blinkers or hand signals.  
Officer Maeshiro approached the driver’s side of the vehicle and 
observed that Davis had red, bloodshot, glassy eyes and noted 
that Davis spoke with an apparent slight slur. The officer 
stated that he asked Davis to complete a field sobriety test 
after smelling the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the 
interior of Davis’s car . At this point in the testimony, Davis 
stipulated that, based on Officer Maeshiro’s obse rvations, the 
officer had reasonable suspicion to stop Davis and probable 
cause to arrest him for OVUII. 
Officer Kimberly Ann Chaney testified that she 
transported Davis from the location of the stop to the Kalihi police station. Officer Chaney related that she informed Davis 
of the implied consent law by reading him form HPD-396K.
3 After 
3 Davis has not challenged the validity of his consent to take the 
breath test. See  State v. Won, 137 Hawai ʻi 330, 372 P.3d 1065 (2015).

   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Davis elected to take a breath test, Officer Chaney testified 
that she turned on the Intoxilyzer 8000, identified as serial 
number 80-003486 (Intoxilyzer), and that the machine proceeded 
to conduct and pass an internal self-check. 
After questioning Officer Chaney regarding the 
internal self- check, the State asked whether “based on [Officer 
Chaney’s] training and experience in operating the Intoxilyzer 
8000,” the instrument “appear[ed ] to be operating properly and 
accurately on the date in question.” Before Officer Chaney 
responded, the State showed to defense counsel two Intoxilyzer 
8000 Accuracy Test Supervisor’s Sworn Statements, dated February 
29, 2012, and March 16, 2012 (Sworn Statements 1 and 2, 
respectively). The State, however, asked no questions of 
Officer Chaney regarding Sworn Statements 1 and 2. Rather, the 
State informed the court that Sworn Statements 1 and 2 “show[ed] 
that the instrument was working properly” and that it sought to 
admit the documents into evidence as proof of the Intoxilyzer’s 
condition and accuracy. 
The top half of Sworn Statements 1 and 2 includes a 
machine printout of the calibration testing data from the Intoxilyzer. The bottom half of Sworn Statements 1 and 2 
includes a pre-printed text block in which a person by the name 
of Woo Kang is identified as the Intoxilyzer supervisor.  As to

   The pre-printed text block located in the bottom half  
of Sworn Statements 1 and 2  contains the following statement  :  
 
  Davis  objected to Sworn Statements 1 and 2  being 
entered into evidence based upon, inter alia: (1) lack of  
                     
 4  It appears that “g/210L BrAC” denotes a measurement of alcohol 
concentration, which Hawaiʻ i Administrative Rules (HAR)  §  11-114-4 defines as 
“grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of breath.”  See  HAR § 11- 114-4 
(1993).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the machine printout of the  calibration  testing data, there is  a 
table listing the following information in this order: (1) air 
blank; (2) simulator temperature; (3) reference sample #1; (4) 
air blank; (5) air blank;  (6) simulator temperature; 
(7) reference sample #2; (8) air blank; (9) ITP check; and (10) air blank. Next to each category of information  , except 
the simulator temperatures, is a data entry based on “g/210L 
4 BrAC.”  Next to each data entry is a time stamp.  
I, Woo KANG, swear that the aforementioned information is 
true and correct and that I am a duly licensed Intoxilyzer 
8000 supervisor trained to maintain and perform accuracy tests on the Intoxilyzer 8000. The Intoxilyzer 8000 is a 
breath alcohol testing instrument approved for use in the 
State of Hawaii pursuant to section 321 -161 of the Hawaii 
Revised Statutes as amended. The Intoxilyzer was operating accurately in compliance with the State of Hawaii Department of Health Administrative Rules, Title Eleven, 
Chapter 114 -7, on the date indicated below, when I 
conducted the accuracy test recorded on this document. 
Below this pre-printed language are the date, Woo Kang’s 
signature, and his license number and its expiration date.

foundation; (2) hearsay; and (3) hearsay within hearsay.  Davis  
argued that Sworn Statements 1 and 2 did not substantively 
comply with the requirements of Hawaii Rules of Evidenc  e (HRE) 
Rule 803(b)(6)  (1993 & Supp. 2002), which is the hearsay 
exception for records of regularly conducted activity (i.e., 
business records).  Further, Davis maintained that  without more 
information or testimony as to Sworn Statements 1 and 2,  the  
data printout  reflecting the calibration test result  s was  
meaningless to the court; he  noted, for example, that  there was 
no evidence presented as to  what known reference samples were 
used in the calibration testing and what their “target values” 
or output shou ld have been in the machine’s data printout .  
Additionally, Davis contended that there was no information 
presented as to  the specifics of the  calibration procedure 
performed by Kang, which  apparently  differed from the 
Intoxilyzer’s internal self -check.  Davis also objected to the  
admission of Sworn Statements 1 and 2 into evidence under the 
public records exception. Davis argued that Sworn Statements 1 
and 2 lacked reliability on their face because the State failed 
to present the circumstances of how the information was 
obtained, given that Kang did not testify at trial.  
 
  
  
    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The State 
contended that there was sufficient legal 
basis under HRE Rule 803(b)(8) (1993 & Supp. 2002) for the

  Over the defense’s  objection, the district court 
5received into evidence  Sworn Statements 1 and 2.   The district 
court, also over object ion, admitted  into evidence the March 3, 
2012 Sworn Statement of Intoxilyzer Operator (Operator 
                     
  
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
admission of Sworn Statements 1 and 2 into evidence because they 
were public records made in the course of a regularly conducted 
activity. The State maintained that each document was a self-
authenticating copy of the original log, which was kept in the 
custody of the Honolulu Police Department (HPD), a public 
office, and that each document contained a data compilation. 
The State further argued that the criteria for admitting Sworn 
Statements 1 and 2 into evidence were met because each document, 
on its face, complied with the requirements prescribed in the 
Hawaiʻi Administrative Rules (HAR), and each document indicated 
that the Intoxilyzer was “operating accurately” when calibrated.  
The State maintained that the district court did not need to 
look at the data printout set forth in Sworn Statements 1 and 2 
to determine whether or not the device was operating accurately 
because Kang swore that the machine was operating accurately in 
compliance with the HAR. 
5 The district court did not expressly indicate on what basis it 
was admitting Sworn Statements 1 and 2 into evidence, but it appears that the 
court’s ruling was based on HRE Rules 902(4) (1993 & Supp. 2002 ), 1005 
(1993), and 803(b)(8) (1993 & Supp. 2002) .

  Davis appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
(ICA), challenging the district court’s admission of Sworn 
Statements 1 and 2 into evidence on the grounds that  they did  
not meet the foundational requirements and failed to comply with ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Statement), which indicated that the breath alcohol content 
measured by the Intoxilyzer for Davis was .139 grams of alcohol 
per 210 liters of breath. 
Based on the evidence presented, the district court 
concluded that the State met the three foundational requirements 
to show that Davis’s breath test results could be relied on as 
substantive evidence: (1) the Intoxilyzer was in proper working 
order; (2) its operator was qualified; and (3) the test was 
properly administered. The court also determined that the State showed strict compliance with the requirements of the HAR. 
Consequently, the district court concluded that the State proved 
beyond a reasonable doubt that Davis had .08 or more grams of 
alcohol per 210 liters of breath at the time he was driving on 
March 3, 2012. Accordingly, the district court found Davis 
guilty of the offense charged and entered its Order and Notice 
of Entry of Order on November 29, 2012.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the requirements of the business records exception.6 Davis noted 
that he had objected at trial to the admission of Sworn 
Statements 1 and 2 under the Hawaii Rules of Evidence as 
inadmissible hearsay. Davis further contended that because the 
district court erred in admitting Sworn Statements 1 and 2, the 
State failed to present any evidence that the Intoxilyzer used 
to test his breath alcohol content was in proper working order 
and thus failed to lay a proper foundation for the admission of 
his breath test results. In response, the State maintained that the district court properly admitted Sworn Statements 1 and 2 
into evidence as public records under HRE Rule 803(b)(8).  The 
State therefore argued that the district court did not err in 
admitting Davis’s breath test results into evidence. 
In a Summary Disposition Order, the ICA ruled that the 
district court did not err by admitting Sworn Statements 1 and 2 
into evidence because they were admissible as self-authenticating public records under HRE Rules 803(b)(8) and 
902(4). The ICA reasoned that because Intoxilyzer calibration 
tests by the HPD are required, pursuant to HAR § 11-114-12,
7 to 
6 Davis also contended that Sworn Statements 1 and 2 were 
inadmissible because both documents were meaningless and irrelevant due to 
the absence of essential information and because their admission violated his 
confrontation rights under the Hawai ʻi Constitution. 
7 HAR § 11 -114-12 provides, 
(continued. . .) 
9
  
 
 
 
   
 
  
   
  “When application of a particular evidentiary rule can 
yield only one correct result, the proper standard for appellate  
review is the right/wrong standard.” State v. Jhun , 83 Hawai ʻi  
                                                                               
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 8  The ICA also concluded that Davis’s objection for lack of 
foundation was without merit and noted that Davis’s obje ction based on 
relevance was waived pursuant to Hawai ʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
28(b)(4). In the alternative, with regard to the relevancy argument, the ICA 
indicated that because Sworn Statements 1 and 2 state that “[t]he Intoxilyzer 
was operating accurately in compliance with the State of Hawai ʻi Department of 
Health Administrative Rules, Title Eleven, Chapter 114 -7,” these documents 
were relevant to demonstrate that the Intoxilyzer was working properly during 
Davis’s  breath test on March 3, 2012.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
be kept and maintained by the Intoxilyzer supervisor for at 
least three years, Sworn Statements 1 and 2 are public records 
or reports of a public agency and, therefore, an exception to 
hearsay within the meaning of HRE Rule 803(b)(8).8 Accordingly, 
the ICA affirmed the district court’s Order and Notice of Entry 
of Order entered on November 29, 2012. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
(. . .continued) 
(a) Records shall be kept and maintained at the direction 
of a supervisor. 
(b) Records shall include information on:
 
. . . .
  
(2) Accuracy tests;

(c) Records maintained pursuant to subsection (a) shall be 
retained by the jurisdiction for at least three years.

  In his Application for  Writ of Certiorari, Davis 
contends that the ICA erred in concluding that the district 
court properly admitted into evidence Sworn Statements 1 and 2  
9under the Hawaii  Rules of Evidence.   Davis maintains that 
because Sworn Statements 1 and 2 were improperly admitted, 
evidence of his  breath alcohol content obtained from  the 
                     
  
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
472, 477, 927 P.2d 1355, 1360  (1996) (quoting  Kealoha v. Cty. of  
Hawaiʻi, 74 Haw. 308, 319-20, 844 P.2d 670, 676 (1993)).  
However, in cases where the rules of evidence require a 
“judgment call” by the trial court, “the traditional abuse of discretion standard should be  applied.” Id.   Thus, in Jhun, in  
reviewing the trial court’s ruling with respect to hearsay and HRE Rule 803(b)(8), this court applied the right/wrong standard 
because the trial court did not have to make a “judgment call ”  
when it determined that the proffered evidence failed to qualify 
under the public records exception  , as the report   did not set 
forth factual findings resulting from an investigation.  Id.  at 
477-81, 927 P.2d at 1360-64.  
III. DISCUSSION 
9 Davis also challenges the admissibility of Sworn Statements 1 and 
2 based on lack of relevance, lack of trustworthiness, and a violation of his 
confrontation rights under the Hawai ʻi Constitution. In light of our 
disposition of this case, it is not necessary to address these arguments.

  “[I]n meeting the foundational prerequisites for the 
admission of the Intoxilyzer test result[,] there must be a 
showing of strict compliance with those provisions of the 
[Hawaiʻi Administ rative] Rules  [governing the testing of blood, 
breath, and other bodily substances for alcohol concentration]  
which have a direct bearing on the validity and accuracy of the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Intoxilyzer was also improperly received and thus there was 
insufficient evidence to support his OVUII conviction. 
In State v. Thompson , 72 Haw. 262, 814 P.2d 393 
(1991), this court noted that to admit a specific Intoxilyzer 
breath alcohol test result into evidence, the prosecution must 
lay a proper foundation “ to establish the accuracy of the 
alcohol concentrations used in breath tests.” Id. 
at 263, 814 
P.2d at 394. The foundation must show that “(1) the intoxilyzer 
was in proper working order; (2) its operator was qualified; and 
(3) the test was properly administered.” Id. at 263, 814 P.2d 
at 394-95 (quoting State v. Souza , 6 Haw. App. 554, 558, 732 
P.2d 253, 257 (1987)). This foundation is necessary to prove 
the reliability of the test result that establishes intoxication 
before the test result can be relied on as a substantive fact.

 Title 11, chapter 114 of the HAR provides the relevant rules and 
regulations for the “Testing of Blood, Breath, and Other Bodily Substances 
for Alcohol Concentration.” It applies to “individuals or laboratories wh o 
collect samples for or conduct forensic alcohol testing for the purpose of introduction of the alcohol test results into evidence in . . . criminal 
proceedings under applicable State driving under the influence of alcohol statutes.” HAR § 11 -114-1(b) (1993).  
   
  (a)  Every accuracy test procedure shall be approved by the DUI 
coordinator in writing and shall include, but not be limited to the following requirements:

test result.”10 State v. Kemper , 80 Hawaiʻ i 102, 105, 905 P.2d 
77, 80 (App. 1995) (quoting State v. Matsuda, 9 Haw. App. 291, 
293, 836 P.2d 506, 508 (1992)). This includes establishing that 
the calibration procedure used to test the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer strictly complied with the HAR because the 
calibration test has a “direct bearing on the validity and 
accuracy of the test result obtained from that Intoxilyzer. ” 
Souza, 6 Haw. App. at 562, 732 P.2d at 259. Accordingly, in order “to fulfill the foundational prerequisites of 
admissibility” of the test result in this case, the State was 
required to show that the Intoxilyzer calibration test, which 
has a direct bearing on the validity and accuracy of Davis’s 
breath test result, was in compliance with HAR § 11-114-7
11 and 
11 HAR § 11 -114-7 provides the following: 
(1)	 The test shall be conducted by a supervisor; 
(2)	 At least two different reference samples and an 
air blank shall be run with each accuracy test;

was therefore in proper working order on the calibration testing 
dates. See id . 
A. Admissibility under Public Records Exception,
 
HRE Rule 803(b)(8)
 
The State contended at trial, and the ICA agreed, that 
Sworn Statements 1 and 2 were admissible public records under HRE Rule 803(b)(8) (1993 & Supp. 2002) and thus demonstrated 
that the Intoxilyzer was in proper working order on the dates of 
the calibration testing.

(. . .continued) 
(3) Reference samples shall be chosen so that their 
target values are not less than 0.04gm alcohol/210 
liters and not greater than 0.25gm alcohol/210 
liters; 
(4) Reference sample target values shall differ from 
each other by at least 0.04gm alcohol/210 
liters; 
(5) Reference sample test results which vary from the target value by more than plus or minus 0.0/gm 
alcohol/210 liters or plus or minus ten percent, 
whichever is greater, shall be cause for the breath alcohol testing instrument used to be 
removed from service until the fault has been 
corrected; and 
(6) An accuracy test shall be performed on an operating instrument at intervals not to exceed thirty-one days. 
HAR § 11- 114-7 (1993). 
12 At oral argument, counsel for the State maintained that Sworn 
Statements 1 and 2 would not be admissible hearsay under the public records 
exception, but that they would instead be admissible under the business 
records exception. See Oral Argument at 20:10 -26, 23:25 -58, State v. Davis, 
SCWC-12-0001121 (argued Dec. 17, 2015), http://oaoa.hawaii.gov/jud/oa

 HRE Rule 803(b)(8) sets forth the public records  
hearsay exception:  
 
   
 
    
  
   
                                                                               
 
 
 
  Id.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
i. Analysis of “Matters Observed,” HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B) 
Records, reports, statements, or data compilations, in any 
form, of public offices or agencies, setting forth (A) the 
activities of the office or agency, or (B) matters observed 
pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which matters there 
was a duty to report, excluding, however, in criminal cases 
matters observed by police officers and other law enforcement personnel, or (C) in civil proceedings and 
against the government in criminal cases, factual findings 
resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority 
granted by law, unless the sources of information or other 
circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness. 
HRE Rule 803(b)(8) (1993 & Supp. 2002)  .   
Thus, the public records exception 
to the hearsay rule 
allows for the admission of records, reports, statements, or 
data compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies if those documents contain certain categories of information and 
meet other requirements of this hearsay exception. 
Id.  Under 
HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B), a public record may be admissible if it 
sets forth “matters observed pursuant to a duty imposed by law 
as to which there was a duty to report.” A record or report 
will not be admissible under the public records exception, however, if it falls within the exclusion clause of HRE Rule 
803(b)(8)(B), which prohibits the admission in criminal cases of 
(. . .continued) 
counsel changed his position and argue d that the public records exception 
would be a basis for admitting Sworn Statements 1 and 2 into evidence. 
15
  
 
 
 
  
  Therefore, determining whether proffered hearsay 
evidence falls within HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B)  requires a two-part 
inquiry. First, the proponent of the evidence must   establish  
that the record or report presents  “matters observed ”  and that  
there existed a duty to make and report the observations.  Id.   
Second, the proffered evidence must  not fall within the criminal 
case exclusion  clause as a matter observed by law enforcement  
13 personnel.   Id.; see also Addison M. Bowman, Hawaii Rules of

“matters observed by police officers and o ther law enforcement 
personnel.” Id. 
As to the first inquiry , the phrase “
matters observed ” 
“could reach virtually everything, but apparently it was 
intended to have [a] narrower meaning .” Christopher B. Mueller 
& Laird C. Kirkpatrick, Evidence § 8.50, at 910 (5th ed. 2012).  
That is, the term “matters observed” narrows the coverage of 
subsection (B) “to information that is concrete and simple in 
nature,” rather than encompassing all “records describing an 
almost endless variety of acts, events, and conditions in the

half of Sworn Statements 1 and 2 does not constitute a “matter observed,” we 
need not reach the issue of whether Sworn Statements 1 and 2 fall within the 
public records exclusion for criminal cases as matters observed by law 
enforcement personnel. See HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B).

world observed and depicted by public officials .” Id. at 910. 
Indeed, “matters observed” are “routine recordations not 
resulting from analysis or judgment ” and do not encompass 
“conclusions, opinions, and evaluative findings .” Bowman,

, § 803-3[8][D], at 8-44 (emphasis added); see also Pool v.  
Wade
, 685 N.E.2d 791, 793 (Ohio Ct. App. 1996) (analyzing 
“matters observed” subsection of similar Ohio public records 
exception and stating that “[n]otably, the Rule does not include 
records, or portions of records, that may be characterized as 
‘evaluations’ or ‘interpretations’ of . . . events or 
transactions.” (quoting Weissenberger’s Ohio Evidence  § 803.105, 
at 409 (1996))). 
Examples of 
data or information compilations that do 
constitute “matters observed” include official weather 
observations, Village of Evanston v. Gunn,  99 U.S. 660, 666-67 
(1878) (meteorological observations by U.S. Signal Service);

and “observations in an accident report that  
describe the scene

observable damage or destruction,” Mueller & Kirkpatrick, supra,

ii. Comparison to “Factual Findings,” HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(C) 
Comparing the term “matters observed” w ithin 
subsection (B) of HRE Rule 803(b)(8) and the term “factual 
findings” within subsection (C) 
further demonstrates the 
former’s limited scope.  “Factual findings from an 
investigation” admissible under HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(C)’s federal 
counterpart14 have been interpreted by the United States Supreme

Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) 803(8) and provides in relevant part:

Court to include “conclusions or opinions that flow from a 
factual investigation.” See  Beech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey , 488 
U.S. 153, 164 (1988); see also  State v. Jhun , 83 Hawaiʻ i 472,  
481, 927 P.2d 1355, 1364  (1996)  (noting that “independent 
conclusions or opinions” may be admissible as “factual findings” 
under HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(C)). Notably, the legislative history 
of the federal public records exception  suggests that its 
drafters envisioned the “factual findings” subsection--rather 
than the “matters observed” or “activities of an office o r 
agency” subsections--as providing the gateway for admission of “evaluative reports ”  that would otherwise constitute hearsay.   
See Beech Aircraft Corp. , 488 U.S.  at 164-67  (discussing 
legislative history of FRE 803(8)(A)(iii) and   determining that

19
  
 
 
 
   
  In keeping with this distinction, t he term “matter s 
observed” within the federal public records exception  has been 
interpreted as excluding evaluative findings and opinions. See  
Baker v. Elcona Homes Corp. , 588 F.2d 551, 556-57 (6th Cir. 
1978). In Baker
, a defendant in a vehicular negligence lawsuit 
sought to introduce a police accident report to settle the  
disputed fact of whether a traffic light was  red or green at the 
time of an accident.  Id. at 555.  The police report included  
(1) the responding off icer’s visual description of the accident 
scene upon arrival, including measurements and physical 
markings, (2) a transcript of the officer’s subsequent interview 
with one of the parties, (3) a notation that “apparently unit #2 
(the Valiant) entered the in tersection against a red light,” and 
(4) notations that “unit #2” failed to yield the right -of-way 
and that both drivers were “preoccupied.” Id.  at 554-55.  The 
police report was admitted into evidence over the plaintiff’s 
hearsay objection. Id. at 555.   On appeal, the Sixth Circuit 
Court of Appeals  determined that the “matters observed” and 
“factual findings” subsections of FRE 803(8)  were applicable.   
Id. at 555-56.   The Court of Appeals first concluded that “the 
direct observations and recorded data” o f the responding officer ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the Advisory Committee “surely” intended that “factual findings” 
subsection would allow for admission of “evaluative reports” ). 
20
  
 
 
“clearly” constituted “matters observed” within t he meaning of 
FRE 803(8)(A)(ii).  Id.  at 556.  The Sixth Circuit ’s “principal 
concerns,” however, related to , inter alia,   whether the traffic 
light and fault notations were properly admissible under either 
the “matters observed” or “factual findings” subsections . Id.   
The Court of Appeals   concluded that the traffic light and fault 
notations were more appropriately characterized as “factual 
findings” falling under FRE 803(8)(A)(iii), because they related 
to “whether the light was red or green for one driver or the other at the time of the accident.” 
Id. at 557.   In so 
deciding, the Sixth Circuit made the following distinction 
between the “matters observed” and “factual findings” 
subsections:  
Applying the rule and its background to the facts here, it 
is apparent that whether the light was red or green for one 
driver or the other at the time of the accident is 
distinctly a factual finding within the meaning of the rule  
. . . .  It is also clear from the construction of the rule 
itself that factual findings  admissible under Rule 
803(8)[(A)(iii)]  may be those which are made by the 
preparer of the report from disputed evidence, as contrasted to those facts which are “matters observed pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which matters there 
was a duty to report”  called for under Rule 
803(8)[(A)(ii)] .  
Id. at 557–58.  Thus, the court considered that the “matters 
observed” subsection of the public records exception encompassed  
the  “direct obser
vations and recorded data”  included by the 
officer in his accident report,  whereas the “factual findings” 
subsection applied to conclusions or evaluations  (i.e., whether 
21
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
the light was red or green at the time of the accident)  based on 
those observations or  data.  Id.; see also  Bradbury v. Ford 
Motor Co., 358 N.W.2d 550,  552 (Mich. 1984) (noting the 
distinction between the “concepts” in the “matters observed” and 
“factual findings” subsections of the public records   hearsay  
exception). 
 
   In this case, to  meet  the requirements under HRE Rule 
803(b)(8)(B),  Kang’s statement  in the bottom half of Sworn 
Statements 1 and 2  that the “ Intoxilyzer was operating 
15 accurately” must constitute a “matter  []  observed.”   See HRE  
Rule 803(b)(8)(B). In his sworn statement, Kang   indicated that 
he was a “duly licensed Intoxilyzer 8000 supervisor trained  to 
maintain and perform accuracy tests on the Intoxilyzer 8000.” 
Indeed, HAR § 11-114-7 requires that an Intoxilyzer supervisor 
16 conduct the calibration tests, and HAR  § 11- 114-9 prescribes 
                     
 15  The machine printout of the calibration testing data included 
within the top half of Sworn Statements 1 and 2 may constitute a collection 
of “routine recordations” qualifying as “matters observed” within the meaning  
of HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B). Bowman, supra,  § 803-3[8][D], at 8 -44.  Because 
this court concludes that the sworn statement of Kang included within the bottom half of Sworn Statements 1 and 2 does not constitute a “matter 
observed,” we do not analyze HRE Rul e 803(b)(8)(B) with respect to the 
testing data.  
  
 (b)  No person shall serve as a supervisor without a 
valid license issued by the DUI coordinator or the chief of police.

the training and licensing requirements for Intoxilyzer 
supervisors. Thus, based on the record and the qualification 
requirements for Intoxilyzer supervisors, Kang was required to 
have specialized knowledge, experience, and training in 
Intoxilyzer calibration testing. Kang’s sworn statement that 
the “Intoxilyzer was operating accurately” was based upon his 
technical analysis of the data included within the top half of 
Sworn Statements 1 and 2, which he collected in conducting the 
Intoxilyzer calibration tests. Therefore, Kang’s sworn

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
statement that the “Intoxilyzer was operating accurately” is an 
expert conclusion based on his technical proficiency in 
Intoxilyzer calibration testing. 
Kang’s conclusion that the Intoxilyzer was functioning 
accurately is similar to the responding officer’s conclusion in 
Baker that a driver ran a red light and was at fault for a resulting accident. 588 F.2d at 556-57.  The responding officer 
in Baker gathered data by observing the physical circumstances 
of the accident scene and conducting other investigative measures; then, based on that data, the officer made a 
conclusion that the light was red at the time of the accident. 
Id. at 554-55.  Here, Kang gathered data by conducting 
calibration testing on the Intoxilyzer; then, based on the data 
he recorded in the top half of Sworn Statements 1 and 2 and 
using his training and specialized knowledge, he rendered a 
conclusion that the Intoxilyzer was functioning accurately and included this conclusion in the bottom half of Sworn Statements 
1 and 2. 
As in Baker
, Kang’s interpretive conclusion cannot be 
characterized as a “matter observed” because it is not a “direct 
observation,” a “routine recordation,” or “recorded data” reflecting observations that are concrete and simple. 588 F.2d 
at 556; Bowman, 
supra, § 803-3[8][D], at 8-44. Kang’s

  The dissenting opinion  relies primarily  on an ICA 
decision, State v. Ofa , 9 Haw. App. 130, 828 P.2d 813 (1992), in  
support of its position.  Initially, it is noted   that the 
dispositive issue in Ofa  was whether the State’s failure to 
include the known temperature of the solutions used to test an 
Intoxilyzer rendered the resulting calibration tests 
insufficient to lay a foundation for Ofa’s breath test results. 
                     
   
 
  
 
   
 
  
 
 
 17 conclusion therefore does not constitute a “matter observed .”  
Accordingly, the ICA and the district court erred in   admitting  
Sworn Statements 1 and 2  into evidence as public records under  
18  HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B).***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
iii.  State v. Ofa Does Not Provide for a Different Result 
17 The dissent seeks to distinguish Baker by describing Sworn 
Statements 1 and 2 as “routine determination[s] that a piece of equipment 
works properly,” or alternatively, as “record[s] of the direct observations 
of the Intoxilyzer supervisor” and thus “plainly . . . ‘matter[s] observed.’” 
Dissent at 6 , 8. Even assuming Kang’s testing of the Intoxilyzer may be 
characterized as “routine” in the sense that HAR § 11 -114-7(6) requires that 
such equipment be tested for accuracy by a qualified professional “at 
intervals not to exceed thirty -one days ,” Kang’s statement as set forth in 
the bottom half of Sworn Statements 1 and 2 is not a “direct observation []” 
or simple “determination that a piece of equipment works properly.” Dissent 
at 6, 8. Rather, for the reasons described above, the statement reflects an 
evaluative opinion that was based on Kang’s specialized knowledge of 
Intoxilyzer calibration procedures. See HAR § 11- 114-7(6) (1993), supra note 
11. 
18 Kang’s conclusion contained in Sworn Statements 1 and 2 is not 
admissible under HRE Rule 803(b) (8)(C) as a “factual finding[] resulting from 
an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law” because HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(C) is restricted in criminal cases to use only against the 
government and thus may not be used against Davis in this case. HRE Rule 
803(b)(8)(C); see also Jhun, 83 Hawai ʻi at 477, 927 P.2d at 1360 (quoting 
same).

Id. at 139, 828 P.2d at 818.  The ICA answered this question in 
the affirmative and reversed Ofa’s conviction on that basis 
alone. Id. at 141, 828 P.2d at 820. As such, the ICA’s other 
rulings in the case are dicta.  Although one of those rulings 
addressed whether a log book was admissible under HRE Rule 
803(b)(8)(B), it is not contrary to our decision in this case. 
In Ofa, the defendant was charged with driving under 
the influence of intoxicating liquor.  Id. at 132, 828 P.2d at 
815. At trial, the State sought to introduce evidence of the 
defendant’s Intoxilyzer breath test result.  Id. 
at 133, 828 
P.2d at 816. As foundational evidence that the relevant Intoxilyzer was functioning accurately on the date that the 
breath test was administered, the State offered into evidence a 
copy of a page of a “log book” (Log) maintained by HPD.  
Id. at 
132-33, 828 P.2d at 815-16.  HPD criminalist Gilbert Chang, a 
certified Intoxilyzer operator-supervisor, testified that “certified operator -supervisors periodically test or calibrate 
the HPD’s intoxilyzers for accuracy” and that “the date and results of the testing for accuracy” were entered into the Log. 
Id.  Chang testified that the initials “JW” appearing on the Log 
signified that John Wadahara “had tested the Intoxilyzer for 
26

  
 
 
 
     
 
  
  
  
   
 
  
 
 
   
                     
    
   
   
  
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
accuracy on [the noted] dates.”19 Id. at 133, 828 P.2d at 816.  
Chang further testified that “the Log indicated that the 
Intoxilyzer was operating accurately on May 31 and June 28, 
1990.” Id. 
Over the defendant’s objection, the trial cou rt 
admitted the Log 
as a public record under HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B).  
Id. at 135, 828 P.2d at 816.  Ofa raised several issues in 
appealing his subsequent conviction, including that the Log 
constituted hearsay and that the trial court erred in admitting it into evidence. Id. at 134, 828 P.2d at 816. 
The ICA concluded that “the only issue” on appeal with 
respect to the admissibility of the Log was “whether the Log 
[was] excludable from the public records and reports exception 
to the hearsay rule as ‘matters observed by . . . law 
enforcement personnel ’ in a criminal case. ” Id. at 135, 828 
P.2d at 817.  Thereafter, the ICA devoted its analysis to the 
issue of whether the Log fell within HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B)’s 
exclusion clause.
20 Id. at 135-137, 828 P.2d at 817.  There was 
19 The Ofa opinion provides no additional information on the 
contents of the Log.  9 Haw. App. at 133, 828 P.2d at 815. The ICA noted 
that Wadahara did not testify in the case.  Id. at 133, 828 P.2d at 816. 
20 In determining whether the Log fell within the exclusion clause, 
the ICA discussed the Log’s nonadversarial and trustworthy n ature. Ofa, 9 
Haw. App. at 136, 828 P.2d at 817.  As in Ofa, issues of the adversarial 
nature or trustworthiness of evidence proffered under the “matters observed”

no discussion with respect to the first step of the inquiry 
under HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B) regarding whether the Log’s contents 
constituted “matters observed .”  Accordingly,  Ofa 
does not 
speak to the issue in this appeal--whether evaluative opinions 
and analyses constitute “matters observed .”21 
In this case, the State sought to lay a foundation for 
Davis’s breath test results through a document that contained 
both data and evaluative opinion.  Although the numerical data included in the top half of Sworn Statements 1 and 2 may be admissible under HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B), Kang’s opinion regarding 
the Intoxilyzer’s accuracy included in the bottom half is not.  
(. . .continued) 
subsection of the public records hearsay exception often arise under this 
second part of th e inquiry rather than the rule’s definitional clause. See, 
e.g.
, United States v. Wilmer , 799 F.2d 495, 500 -01 (9th Cir. 1986) 
(concluding that “maintenance operator’s calibration report” of breathalyzer 
machine did not fall within exclusion clause because it was a routine act of 
a nonadversarial nature); United States v. Hernandez -Rojas, 617 F.2d 533, 
534-35 (9th Cir. 1980) (concluding that deportation warrant with signed and 
dated notation “deported to Mexico, Calexico, California” did not fall within exclusion clause because it was a “ministerial, objective observation”). 
21 Thus, neither the holding nor the reasoning of Ofa is “directly 
applicable to this case,” dissent at 5, as Davis does not argue that Sworn 
Statements 1 and 2 fall within the rule’s exclusion clause. 
However, although dicta, Ofa does provide an example of the 
intersection of data, evaluative opinion, and hearsay evidence in OVUII 
prosecutions in laying a proper foundation for a defendant’s breath test 
results: “[b]ased on the Log and other exhibits in evidence, [the certified 
Intoxilyzer operator -supervisor] gave his opinion testimony regarding the 
accuracy of the Intoxilyzer.” 9 Haw. App. at 137, 828 P.2d at 817.  This 
combination of evidence, the Ofa 
court determined, was sufficient to support 
the admission of the breath test results under the Hawaii Rules of Evidence.

See Bowman, supra , § 803-3[8][D], at 8 -44 (“matters observed” 
falling within HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B)  do not include 
“conclusions, opinions, and evaluative findings” ).   Thus, Sworn
Statements 1 and 2 are not admissible   hearsay under HRE Rule 
803(b)(8)(B).   
iv. 
Use of Sworn Statements in Administrative Driver’s License 
Revocation Proceedings 
Our determination that Kang’s evaluative conclusions 
as included within the bottom half of Sworn Statements 1 and 2 do not fall within HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B) is also consistent with statutory provisions relating to administrative driver’s license 
revocation proceedings following an OVUII arrest. In the administrative revocation process, which is civil in nature, the 
State is specifically authorized by statute to rely on evaluative conclusions virtually identical to those contained in 
Sworn Statements 1 and 2 in this case.  See HRS § 291E-37(c)(3) 
(Supp. 2012); HRS § 291E-38(g) (Supp. 2012).  Although written 
statements including conclusions on an Intoxilyzer’s accuracy 
are permitted in a civil process designed to expeditiously 
revoke the license of the arrestee-driver, reliance on such 
relaxed evidentiary procedures in criminal proceedings against 
an individual facing penal sanctions is neither authorized nor 
called for by time considerations. 
29
  
 
 
 
   Under the Hawaii Revised Statutes, administrative 
driver’s license revocation procedures  may be initiated 
following an OVUII arrest  when the arresting officer issues  a 
notice of administrative revocation.  HRS § 291E-33(a), (c)  
(Supp. 2012). Where the officer has administered a breath  , 
blood, or urine  test  establishing the driver’s alcohol 
concentration, the relevant authority is required to immediately  
22  forward to the director the “sworn statement of the person 
responsible for maintenance of the testing equipment” to 
23 establish, pursuant to HRS § 321-161  and rules adopted 
thereunder, the following information:

22 See HRS § 291E-1 (2007) (defining “director” as “the 
administrative director of the courts or any other person within the 
judiciary appointed by the director to conduct administrative reviews or 
hearings or carry out other functions relating to administrative revocation 
under part III”). 
23 See HRS § 321- 161 (2010) (authorizing the department of health to

HRS § 291E-36(a), (a)(2) (2007 & Supp. 2012) (emphasis added).24 
The director is then required to  review the issuance of the 
notice of revocation, which must include consideration  of the 
sworn statement regarding the working condition of the machine 
at the time the breath, blood, or urine  test was conducted.  HRS 
§ 291E-37(a), (c)(3)  (Supp. 2012).  
If the director administratively revokes the 
individual’s driver’s license, the driver may request an 
administrative hearing to 
seek review of the decision to revoke 
the driver’s license . HRS § 291E-38(a) (Supp. 2012).  At the 
hearing, the sworn statements relating to the accuracy and condition of the testing equipment must be admitted into 
evidence, and the director “shall” consider the statements 
24 We note that the requirements for accuracy testing of breath 
testing machines as set forth in HAR § 11 -114-7(a) (see supra 
note 11) apply 
to all “individuals or laboratories who collect samples for or conduct 
forensic alcohol testing for the purpose of introduction of the alcohol test 
results into evidence in either civil or criminal proceedings  under 
applicable State driving under the influence of alcohol statutes.” HAR § 11 -
114
-1(b) (emphasis added).  This suggests that Sworn Statements 1 and 2, like 
the sworn statements contemplated by the administrative driver’s license 
revocation statute , are completed pursuant to the accuracy testing procedures 
of HAR § 11- 114-7(a).  See Park v. Tanaka,
 75 Haw. 271, 278 -79, 859 P.2d 917, 
920-21 (1993).  In fact, at least with respect to the predecessor revocation 
statute, Sworn Statements 1 and 2 are substantively identical to the sworn 
statements used in revocation proceedings, in that the top half contains a 
machine printout from the calibration testing data of the Intoxilyzer, and 
the bottom half includes a pre -printed text block of the Intoxilyzer 
supervisor regarding the machine’s accuracy. See 
Ige v. Admin. Dir. of the 
Court, 93 Hawaiʻ i 133, 139-40, 997 P.2d 59, 65 -66 (App. 2000) (detailing 
contents of sworn statement s used in driver’s license revocation proceedings 
under HRS chapter 286 (repealed 2000)).

without requiring the testimony of a law enforcement officer or 
other person. See  HRS § 291E-38(a) (Supp. 2012); HRS § 291E  -
38(g). However, should the individual request to “examine a law enforcement officer or other person who made a sworn statement,” 
the director is required to issue a subpoena for that person to 
appear at the hearing.  HRS § 291E-38(g).   Thus, the 
administrative driver’s license revocation procedures require 
admission and consideration of sworn statements regarding  a  
breath test equipment’s accuracy and condition , while also 
mandating that, upon request, the officer or other qualified person be subpoenaed to give testimony at an  administrative 
hearing. 
 
   Specifically with respect to the administrative 
revocation of a driver’s license, part III of HRS chapter 291E 
therefore allows for the submission of documen    tary evidence to 
prove that breath test equipment was operating accurately at the 
time that the test  was administered to the individual whose 
license the State seeks to revoke. Permitting  relaxed 
evidentiary procedures in this civil setting is in keeping with 
the purpose of the administrative revocation process itself, 
which is to “provide for the public safety by establishing a 
quick, administrative procedure for revoking the licenses of 
drunk drivers while they are awaiting trial on criminal DUI ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

charges.” State v. Toyomura , 80 Hawaiʻ i 8, 20, 904 P.2d 893, 905 
(1995) (quoting Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 137, in 1990 House Journal, 
at 824, 1990 Senate Journal, at 825)  (analyzing predecessor 
administrative driver’s license revocation procedures under HRS 
§ 286-260 (repealed 2000))  .   In fact, the key benefit of  
administrative revocation procedures is the ability to bypass those protections afforded to criminal defendants at trial:  
[T]he main benefit of administrative revocation is that it 
allows the State to remove a drunk driver’ s license before 
the culmination of a lengthy prosecution under the criminal 
statute. Currently, a person charged with driving under 
the influence must be allowed to continue driving until he 
or she is found guilty in a court of law. This process 
takes an average of seven or eight months in Hawaii, and 
even longer, and while this process is going on, the dangerous driver, who quite likely is an inveterate repeat 
offender, remains on the road. 
State v. Higa , 79 Hawaiʻ i 1, 6, 89 7 P.2d 928, 933 (1995) (quoting 
Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 137, in 1990 House Journal, at 824-25, 1990 
Senate Journal, at 825). Deeming sufficient a sworn statement 
regarding maintenance testing on a breath or other test machine, 
rather than requiring a qualified person to testify at a 
hearing, is thus one way the administrative revocation process 
avoids evidentiary and other procedural rules in an effort to 
prevent “potentially threatening drivers” from continuing to 
drive “between the time [they] are cited and their criminal 
adjudication.” Id. at 6, 897 P.2d at 933.

Significantly, unlike the “legitimate, nonpunitive, 
and purely remedial functions” of the administrative driver’s 
license revocation process, see Higa, 79 Hawai ʻi at 7, 897 P.2d 
at 934, a defendant in an OVUII prosecution faces criminal 
penalties and loss of the constitutional right to liberty. 
HRS § 291E-61(b) (Supp. 2011) (providing imprisonment penalties 
for the offense of operating a vehicle under the influence of an 
intoxicant).  An individual subject to an OVUII prosecution is 
guaranteed the protections afforded 
to criminal defendants by 
the Hawaiʻ i Const itution, the United States Constitution, and the
Hawaii Revised Statutes  (which includes the Hawaii Rules of 
Evidence).  Misconstruing HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B) to allow into  
evidence in an OVUII criminal prosecution out-of-court 
evaluative opinions and conclusions similar to those contained 
within the sworn statements deemed admissible in the civil driver’s license revocation proces s would essentially allow  
procedures designed specifically for a civil administrative process to be used  in a criminal trial.   
v. Davis’s Breath Test Results Lacked Sufficient Foundation 
As Professor Bowman explains in his 
evidence treatise, 
evaluative opinions that constitute hearsay may not be admitted into evidence under HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B). Bowman, supra, § 
803-3[8][D], at 8-44. Public records that include “information 
34
  
 
 
that is concrete and simple in nature” or “routine recordations  
not resulting from analysis or judgment”  may constitute “matters 
observed” within the meaning of HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B) and merit 
25 admission into evidence under the rule.   Mueller & Kirkpatrick, 
supra, § 8.50, at 910; Bowman, supra, § 803- 3[8][D], at 8-44.   
Public records that do not constitute “matters observed” because 
they include “conclusions, opinions, and evaluative findings”  
26 will not be admissible under the public records exception.

25 Our opinion does not preclude any “document or record that 
requires any sort of training or specialized knowledge” from being admitted 
into evidence under HRE Rule 803(b)(8). Dissent at 9.  Rather, a record 
prepared using training or specialized knowledge may be admissible under the rule provided that its contents constitute “matters observed,” in that it 
does not contain conclusions, opinions, or evaluative findings. Bowman, 
supra, § 803-3[8][D], at 8 -44.  
26 Though the dissent states that our decision is inconsistent with 
those of other federal and state courts on “this issue,” dissent at 2 , 7, it 
appears that the trial courts of other jurisdictions have routinely utilized 
a combination of testimony and written data to lay a foundation for 
evaluative opinions and reports, thereby avoiding the precise issue in this 
case. See, e.g., Best v. State,  328 A.2d 141, 142 -43 (Del. 1974) 
(Intoxilyzer calibration tests by state chemist introduced in conjunction 
with testimony of police officer/record -keeper regarding “[the Intoxilyzer’s] 
proper operation and condition at the time of [the defendant’s] arrest and 
testing”); United States v. Gilbert , 774 F.2d 962, 964 (9th Cir. 1985) (card 
containing impression of fingerprint and “notation that the fingerprint had 
been ‘lifted’ from one of the wooden statuettes by Criminologist Sally Jones” 
introduced in conjunction with testimony of different criminologist that the print on the card was a match to defendant’s left thumb); People v. Black, 
406 N.E.2d 23, 24 -25 (Ill. App. Ct. 1980) (testimony of evidence technician 
that decal affixed to breathalyzer machine “indi cated that it had been 
recently tested and proven accurate” was sufficient to establish machine’s 
accuracy); State v. Jensen , 351 N.W.2d 29, 31, 32 -33 (Minn. Ct. App. 1984) 
(breathalyzer certification records introduced in conjunction with testimony 
of operator who administered defendant’s breath test regarding “the 
administration and the reliability of the [breath] test”).

In order to render evaluative opinions or conclusions 
based on “matters observed,” other evidence may be introduced in 
conjunction with data properly admitted under HRE Rule 
803(b)(8)(B).27 This additional evidence may come in a variety 
(. . .continued) 
Further, the dissent has not identified a case in which this 
specific issue--i.e., whether evaluative opinions and conclusions constitute 
“matters observed” within the meaning of HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B) or its state 
or federal analogs--has been explicitly considered, reasoned, and ruled on in 
the affirmative. See, e.g., State v. Smith, 675 P.2d 510, 511 -12 (Or. Ct. 
App. 1984) (concluding that “two documents certifying that the breathalyzer 
equipment 
was in proper operating order” were admissible into evidence under 
state law public records exception but declining without explanation to 
address defendant’s argument that the two documents “ encompass[ed] expert 
testimony”). 
27 To the extent that the dissent suggests that such a combination 
of evidence is inconsistent with 24 years of practice in Hawai ʻi courts, 
dissent at 2, we note that in numerous cases, the State has laid a foundation 
for test results in OVUII prosecutions in part by introducing testimony of a 
qualified Intoxilyzer supervisor or other professional familiar with test 
equipment calibration procedures. See, e.g., State v. Werle , 121 Hawaiʻi 274, 
278, 218 P.3d 762, 766 (2009) (testimony from licensed medical technologist 
that he tested the defendant’s blood for alcohol concentration and “outlin[ing] his training and experience in the use and calibration of . . . 
the device he used to test [the defendant’s] blood sample” (internal 
quotations omitted)); State v. Kemper
, 80 Hawai
ʻi 102, 104 -05, 905 P.2d 77, 
79-80 (App. 1995) (testimony from qualified HPD criminalist that she 
calibrated the Intoxilyzer and that “the test was perform ed properly and that 
the results are accurate” (internal quotations omitted)); State v. Young,  8 
Haw. App. 145, 148, 795 P.2d 285, 288 (1990) (testimony from HPD certified 
Intoxilyzer operator -supervisor that, based on her accuracy checks, the 
Intoxilyzer was working “properly and accurately” on the date it was 
administered to the defendant); State v. Ofa, 9 Haw. App. 130, 132 -33, 828 
P.2d 813, 815- 16 (1992) (testimony from HPD criminalist and certified 
Intoxilyzer operator -supervisor that calibration checks of an Intoxilyzer 
were periodically performed and that results were reflected in a 
concurrently- admitted record book); State v. Matsuda, 9 Haw. App. 291, 293, 
836 P.2d 506, 507 (1992) (testimony from “HPD evidence specialist” and 
certified Intoxilyzer supervisor that “he tested the Intoxil yzer . . . for 
accuracy” prior to and following its use on the defendant); State v. 
Hamasaki
, 7 Haw. App. 542, 542, 783 P.2d 1235, 1236 (1989) (testimony from 
HPD criminalist and certified Intoxilyzer operator -supervisor that he 
conducted calibration testing of the Intoxilyzer). 
36
  
 
 
of forms, and our decision in this case  will not require the 
State in every  OVUII prosecution to bring to the trial the  
Intoxilyzer supervisor who conducted the machine’s most recent 
calibration testing. In this particular case, however, no 
admissible evidence was adduced  in conjunction with the 
calibration testing data to establish the Intoxilyzer’s accuracy, therefore rendering Davis’s breath test results 
inadmissible for lack of the requisite foundation.  
 
            
  
 
  The State also sought to admit Sworn Statements 1 and  
2 as business records under HRE Rule 803(b)(6)  (1993 & Supp. 
2002).  “Although ordinarily the proponent of hearsay is 
entitled to ‘shop around’ among the exceptions, the public 
records exception of [the Federal Rules of Evidence] preempts 
this subject matter [of business records] and forecloses access 
to business records admissibility.” Addison M. Bowman, Hawaii 
Rules of Evidence Manual  § 803-3[6][F], at 8-41 (2016-2017 ed.)   .  
Thus, it is generally understood that records excluded by HRE Rule 803(b)(8)  cannot be admitted through the “back door” as a 
business record  under HRE Rule 803(b)(6). 
 See United States v.  
Weiland, 420 F.3d 1062, 1074  (9th Cir. 2005) (“The government 
may not circumvent the specific requirements  of [Federal] Rule  
[of Evidence]  803(8) by seeking to admit public records as ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

business records under Rule 803(6). Nor may the government 
attempt to combine Rules 803(6) and 803(8) into a hybrid rule to 
excuse its failure to comply with either.”); United States v. 
Orellana-Blanco , 294 F.3d 1143, 1149 (9th Cir. 2002) (“When 
public records are used against a defendant in a criminal 
prosecution, the public records exception is the exclusive 
applicable hearsay exception.”) ; 
United States v. Cain, 615 F.2d 
380, 382 (5th Cir. 1980) (“[S]tatements inadmissible as public agency reports under Rule 803(8) may not be received merely because they satisfy Rule 803(6)  . . . section (6) does not open 
a back door for evidence excluded by section (8).”) .  
As discussed above, Sworn Statements 1 and 2 were not 
admissible as 
public records under HRE Rule 803(b)(8).  The 
State may not “circumvent the requirements” of HRE Rule 
803(b)(8)(B) by seeking their admission under HRE Rule 803(b)(6). Bowman, supra, § 803-3[6][F], at 8-41; Weiland, 420 
F.3d at 1074 (indicating that the business records hearsay 
exception is not an avenue for admitting evidence that is 
inadmissible under the public records exception). Therefore, 
Sworn Statements 1 and 2 were not admissible as business records 
under HRE Rule 803(b)(6).

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
IV. CONCLUSION 
Sworn Statements 1 and 2 were improperly admitted 
under the public records exception, as they contained an 
evaluative opinion that does not constitute a “matter observed” 
within the meaning of HRE Rule 803(b)(8). Because there was no other evidence presented in this case as to the Intoxilyzer 
calibration testing, the State failed to lay a sufficient 
foundation that the Intoxilyzer was in proper working order when 
the breath test was administered to Davis. The district court thus erred in admitting the Operator Statement (which contained 
the result of Davis’s breath test) into evidence in light of the 
improper introduction of the calibration records.  As the breath test result was wrongly admitted, the State failed to show that 
Davis’s breath alcohol concentration was .08 or more grams of 
alcohol per 210 liters of breath, an essential element of the 
offense of OVUII under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3).

Accordingly, the ICA erred in affirming the district 
court’s November 29, 2012 Order and Notice of Entry of Order.  
We therefore vacate the ICA’s July 29, 2015 Judgment on Appeal 
and the district court’s November 29, 2012 Order and Notice of 
Entry of Order and remand the case for a new trial.
