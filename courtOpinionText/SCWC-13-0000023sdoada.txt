17, 2012.1 The district court found Elberson guilty of Operating 
a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in 
violation of Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(3) 
(Supp. 2012).2 We accepted Elberson’s Application for Writ of 
Certiorari, and we now vacate the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal and 
the district court ’s Judgment and remand the case to the 
district court for further proceedings. 
After being arrested for OVUII, Elberson was taken to 
the police station, where he was read an implied consent form.3 
1 The Honorable David W. Lo presided. 
2 HRS § 291E -61(a)(3) provides in relevant part: 
A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates 
or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
. . . 
(3)  With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two 
hundred ten liters of breath
. . . . 
3 The form, titled “Use of Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle 
Implied Consent for Testing ,” stated in relevant part: 
1. ___ Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public 
way, street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of the 
State shall be deemed to have given consent to a test or 
tests for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration or drug content of the persons [sic] breath, blood, or 
urine as applicable. 
2. ___ You are not entitled to an attorney before you 
submit to any tests or tests to determine your alcohol 
and/or drug content. 
3. ___ You may refuse to submit to a breath or blood test, 
or both for the purpose of determining alcohol 
concentration and/or blood or urine test, or both for the purpose of determining drug content, none shall be given, 
except as provided in section 291E -21.  However, if you 
refuse to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, you 
shall be subject to up to thirty days imprisonment and/or

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
On the form, Elberson indicated that he refused to take either a 
breath test or a blood test.   The police officer then read 
Elberson a second form, titled “Sanctions for Use of Intoxicants 
While Operating a Vehicle & Implied Consent for Testing.” After 
being informed of the sanctions for refusal, Elberson elected to take a breath test. The breath test resulted in a breath 
alcohol content reading of 0.167 grams of alcohol per 210 liters 
of breath. On certiorari, Elberson contends (1) the State did 
not prove the elements of the crime; (2) the ICA erred in  
affirming the district court’s admission of the breath test 
results based on 
State v. Won , 134 Hawai ʻi 59, 332  P.3d 661 (App. 
2014); (3) the State failed to lay a sufficient foundation to 
admit the breath test; and (4) the State was not permitted to 
file foundational documents with the trial court that it then 
relied on to request judicial notice.  As part of his second 
argument, Elberson asserts he was coerced to agree to the breath 
test by the threat   of imprisonment for refusal to submit to a 
breath, blood, or urine test.  
In State v. Won , 136 Hawaiʻ i 292, 312, 361 P.3d 1195, 
1215 (2015), we held that “coercion engendered by the Implied 
Consent Form runs afoul of the constitutional mandate that 
waiver of a constitutional right may only be the result of a 
fine up to $1,000 or the sanctions of 291E -65, if 
applicable. In addition, you shall also be subject to the 
procedures and sanctions under chapter 291E, part III.

free and unconstrained choice,” and, thus, a defendant’s 
decision to submit to testing after being read the implied 
consent form “is invalid as a waiver of his right not to be 
searched.” In accordance with Won, the result of Elberson’s 
breath test was the product of a warrantless search, and the ICA erred by concluding that Elberson’s claim that the br eath test 
results should have been suppressed lacked merit.   Accordingly, 
Elberson’s OVUII conviction cannot be upheld.  
IT IS 
HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s July 9, 2015 
Judgment on Appeal and the district court ’s Judgment are 
vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court for 
further proceedings consistent with this court’s opinion in 
Won.
