(OVUII). On appeal, Villena asserts the Intermediate Court of 
Appeals (ICA) erred in holding that  the State laid a sufficient 
foundation to introduce the results of Vi llena’s blood alcohol 
test results. Specifically, Villena raises four grounds  for the  
State’s failure  to lay a sufficient foundation for introduction 
into evidence of the blood test results:  
1.  Whether the ICA  gravely erred in  affirming the tria l 
court's admission of Villena's blood alcohol test result  
without first requiring the State  to  (1) introduce  its 
scientific evidence  via a duly  qualified expert; (2)  prove  
satisfaction of the three Montalbo factors in arriving at  
the test  result; and (3) demonstrate compliance with the 
Souza requirements  for test  results produced  by  an  
instrument;  
 
2.  Whether the ICA  gravely erred in  affirming the trial 
court's admission of Villena's  blood alcohol test  result  
without first requiring the State to  demonstrate strict  
compliance with HAR §11 -114-23(b) and (a)(3)  requirements  
which have  a direct  bearing on  the accuracy  of  the alcohol 
test result;  
 
3.  Whether the ICA  gravely erred in  affirming the trial 
court's admission of State's Exhibit#1 (the Letter License)  
as  hearsay,  inadmissible  under either  HRE 803(b)(6) or  (8),  
and in violation of Villena's Confrontation rights; and  
 
4.  Whether the ICA gravely erred in  ruling  that  the trial 
court's  erroneous admission of State's Exhibit#2 (MT 
Perry's Sworn Statements) was mere harmless error.  
 
We affirm the ICA’s judgment and hold that  the State laid a 
proper foundation to introduce the results of Villena’s blood 
test because the State’s licensing letter was admissible as 
nonhearsay.

I.  Background 
A. District Court Proceedings 
On March 6, 2012, Villena was charged by complaint 
with OVUII, in violation of Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 
291E-61(a)(4) (2011).1 Villena pled not guilty to the charge. 
The bench trial commenced on October 18, 2012, continued on 
December 6, 2012, and ended on December 19, 2012.2 
1. Testimony of Officer Wade Ikehara 
The State presented testimony from Honolulu Police 
Department (HPD) Officer Wade Ikehara that on February 22, 2012, he observed Villena driving at 75 miles per hour, 25 miles per 
hour over the speed limit of 50 miles per hour. Officer Ikehara 
next noticed that Villena’s vehicle crossed over the dashed 
lines separating two of the lanes. Although Officer Ikehara 
activated his lights, Villena’s vehicle did not stop until he 
reached a DUI roadblock. At the DUI roadblock, Officer Ikehara 
approached Villena’s vehicle and noted that Villena’s eyes were 
“red, bloodshot, and glassy,” his appearance was disheveled, and 
1 HRS § 291E -61(a)(4) (2011) provides: 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under the 
influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or assumes actual 
physical control of a vehicle: 
. . . 
(4) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters 
or cubic centimeters of blood. 
2 The Honorable Clarence A. Pacarro presided.

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
he detected “a strong odor of an alcoholic type beverage on his 
breath.” Defense counsel stipulated that Villena performed the 
field sobriety test and Officer Ikehara subsequently made the 
arrest. Villena was then transported to the Kalihi Police 
Station.   
At the police station, Officer Ikehara read Villena an 
implied consent form and Villena elected to take a blood test. 
Because Villena selected that option, Officer Ikehara 
transported Villena to the Alapai Police Station to have his 
blood drawn. Officer Ikehara waited with Villena for 20-30 
minutes until the arrival of medical technologist Karla Perry 
(Perry). Upon her arrival, Officer Ikehara listened to her 
explain the procedures and observed her withdraw blood from 
Villena. 
2. Testimony of Medical Technologist Karla Perry 
The State presented testimony from Perry.  This 
testimony was presented out of order, prior to the completion of 
Officer Ikehara’s testimony, due to Perry’s scheduling 
conflicts. 
Perry testified as to her qualifications as a medical 
technologist. She stated she was employed as a medical 
technologist with the City and County of Honolulu since 2004. 
She graduated from the University of Hawaiʻ i at Mānoa with a 
bachelor of science in medical technology, was board certified

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
by the American Society of Clinical Pathologists, and was state 
certified by the state Department of Health (DOH). 
Perry asserted that she was qualified under Hawaiʻ i 
Administrative Rules (HAR) Title 11, chapter 114, which 
regulates blood alcohol testing, to draw blood and perform 
alcohol analysis. Over defense counsel ’s objection for lack of 
foundation, the court allowed the State to lay additional 
foundation to support Perry’s testimony . 
The State sought to lay a foundation for Perry’s 
qualification as a medical technologist under HAR Title 11, 
chapter 114. Perry explained that Title 11 requires an alcohol 
analyst or supervisor to be a medical technologist licensed by the state. With her bachelor of science degree and as a state-
licensed medical technologist, Perry asserted that she fulfilled 
the requirement to be an alcohol analyst under HAR Title 11, 
chapter 114.  Perry also explained that she qualified as an 
alcohol testing supervisor because she fulfilled the sole 
requirement that she have four years of experience as an alcohol 
analyst.
3 
3 Perry’s assertion that four years of experience is sufficient to 
be an alcohol testing supervisor was incorrect.  The minimum number of years 
of experience is five years. HAR § 11 -114-19(b)(3) (1993).  Nonetheless 
Perry was qualified to be a supervisor as she had eight years of experience 
at the time she tested Villena’s blood sample.

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
To gain admission of the results of the blood alcohol 
test results, the State then attempted to introduce evidence to 
establish that the City and County of Honolulu Health Services 
Division Laboratory (Laboratory) where Perry worked was a 
licensed laboratory under Title 11.4 Defense counsel objected 
for lack of foundation. Perry testified that she had personal knowledge that the Laboratory was licensed as of November 2011.  
As the laboratory supervisor, Perry received a licensing letter 
from DUI coordinator Dr. Tam Nguyen stating that the Laboratory 
was licensed under HAR Title 11, chapter 114. Perry testified 
that the letter was kept in the regular course of the 
4 Under HAR Title 11, chapter 114, laboratories conducting alcohol 
tests are required to be licensed by the director of health. A license is 
granted if the laboratory meets the following requirements: 
(1) Is physically located in this State; 
(2) Is licensed by the department as a clinical laboratory; 
(3) Has adequate facilities, personnel, equipment, and 
instrumentation; 
(4) Includes in its staff an alcohol testing supervisor who 
is qualified under section 11 -114-19; 
(5) Uses alcohol testing procedures approved in writing by 
the DUI coordinator or previously approved by the director 
of health as required by section 11- 114-22 and demonstrates 
proficiency in those procedures; 
(6) Has a quality assurance program approved in writing by 
the DUI coordinator which includes a chain of custody 
procedure; and 
(7) Participates in and meets the requirements of a 
performance evaluation program for alcohol testing approved 
in writing by the DUI coordinator as required by section 11-114-21 at no cost to the department. 
HAR § 11- 114-18(b).

  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Laboratory’s business. The State moved to enter the DUI 
coordinator’s licensing letter, marked as State’s Exhibit 1, 
into evidence in order to establish the reliability of the 
laboratory, methods, and instrument used to measure Villena’s 
blood alcohol content.  Defense counsel objected on the basis of 
authentication, lack of foundation, hearsay, and violation of 
Villena’s rights under the Confrontation Clause. The court took 
the letter’s admission into evidence under advisement. 
Perry next testified regarding the enzymatic method 
used to analyze blood samples. She testified that this method 
was approved by Dr. Tam Nguyen, the statewide DUI coordinator, 
in September 2009. Over objections from defense counsel for 
lack of foundation, Perry stated that the enzymatic method is 
accepted in the scientific community as being accurate and 
reliable. 
Perry identified the instrument used to test the blood 
samples as the “Ace Alera. ” Again, over defense counsel’s 
objection for lack of foundation, Perry stated that the Ace 
Alera was approved by the DUI coordinator.  Perry testified she 
was trained to calibrate and operate the Ace Alera by her then-
supervisor in September 2009. As part of her training, Perry 
reviewed the manufacturer’s manual, which explained how to 
calibrate and operate the Ace Alera.  She testified that 
calibration is conducted by placing the reagents and the 
7
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
appropriate samples on the instrument; once the instrument runs 
it informs the technician “whether it passed or failed.” Perry 
testified that she calibrated the Ace Alera prior to testing the 
samples and the instrument passed.  
Following Perry’s testimony regarding the Ace Alera 
instrument’s calibration, t he State sought to prove Villena’s 
blood alcohol content by introducing the blood test result 
measured by the Ace Alera.  Perry testified that Villena’s blood 
alcohol content was “0.16 grams of alcohol per 100 cubic 
centimeters of whole blood.” Defense counsel objected to 
Perry’s testimony on the basis that the State laid an insufficient foundatio n to introduce Villena’s blood test 
result. Defense counsel also asserted that the State failed to 
demonstrate that the testing of Villena’s blood was conducted in 
accordance with the requirements of HAR Title 11, chapter 114. 
The district court clarified that because Perry was testifying 
out of order, Perry was allowed to testify but the testimony and exhibits would not be admitted until the State established 
proper foundation through Perry and its other witnesses.  
The State then sought to move into evidence the blood 
alcohol testing statement —marked as State’s Exhibit 2 —which 
contained Villena’s blood alcohol content results of 0.16.  The 
court took admission of the exhibit under advisement.

   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
3. Admission of the DUI Coordinator’s Licensing Letter 
Following the testimonies of Officer Ikehara and 
Perry, the court heard argument as to the admission of the DUI 
coordinator’s licensing letter and the blood alcohol testing 
statement. 
As noted previously, t he DUI coordinator’s licensing 
letter is a letter to Perry, dated November 5, 2011, from the 
DUI coordinator. The letter states that it “constitutes a 
license for the City and County of Honolulu Health Services 
Division Laboratory to conduct blood alcohol testing in 
accordance with Hawaii  Administrative Rules, Title 11, Chapter 
114 (HAR-11-114).” The letter explains that the licensure of the Laboratory was  based on the Laboratory “having fulfilled 
requirements of HAR-11-114-18(b).”   In addition, the letter 
confirms that the Ace Alera instrume  nt  was approved “to be used 
for the determination of blood alcohol concentration.”   
Specifically, the letter states that “[t]he addition of the ACE -
ALERA Clinical Chemistry analyzer . . . to the ‘Quantitative 
Enzymatic Determination of Alcohol’ procedure [] has been  
evaluated” as meeting the requirements of HAR § 11 -114-22.  The 
letter bears the seal of the State of Hawaiʻ i,  states that it “is 
a true and correct copy of a public document on file in the Department of Health,” and is signed by the DUI coordi nator, who 
is also designated as the custodian of records.   
9
  
 
 
                                                            
   
 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
    
      
      
    
     
    
    
  
 
 
 
     
      
      
    
  
 
     
     
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
The State argued that the DUI coordinator ’s licensing 
letter was admissible because it fell within two hearsay  
exceptions: HRE Rule 803(b)(6), as a record of a regularly 
conducted activity, and HRE Rule 803(b)(8), as a public record 
5  with a self-authenticating seal.  Over defense counsel ’s 
arguments that neither of the hearsay exceptions applied  and 
that admission of the letter would violate Villena ’s 
confrontation rights, the  court admitted the DUI coordinator’s 
5 HRE Rule 803 (2012) provides in relevant part: 
The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even 
though the declarant is available as a witness: 
. . . (b) Other exceptions. . . . 
(6) Records of regularly conducted activity. A 
memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any 
form, of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, 
made in the course of a regularly conducted activity, at or 
near the time of the acts, events, conditions, opinions, or 
diagnoses, as sho wn by the testimony of the custodian or 
other qualified witness, or by certification that complies 
with rule 902(11) or a statute permitting certification, 
unless the sources of information or other circumstances 
indicate lack of trustworthiness. 
. . . 
(8) Public records and reports. Records, reports, 
statements, or data compilations, in any form, of public 
offices or agencies, setting forth (A) the activities of 
the office or agency, or (B) matters observed pursuant to 
duty imposed by law as to which matters there was a duty to 
report, excluding, however, in criminal cases matters 
observed by police officers and other law enforcement 
personnel, or (C) in civil proceedings and against the 
government in criminal cases, factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to au thority granted by 
law, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.

   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
licensing letter into evidence. The State also sought to admit 
a blood alcohol testing statement containing a sworn statement 
from Perry that she followed applicable procedures in testing 
Villena’s blood (the State’s “Exhibit 2”). Over defense 
counsel’s objections based on hearsay and lack of foundation, the court admitted the blood alcohol testing statement into 
evidence based on Perry’s testimony . 
4. Closing Arguments 
In closing argument, the State argued it laid a 
sufficient foundation to admit the blood test result. The State pointed to Perry’s testimony , which demonstrated that the 
enzymatic method is an approved method and that Perry was trained in accordance with state regulations.  The State also 
referenced the DUI coordinator’s licensing letter, which 
licensed Perry’s Laboratory and confirmed the DUI coordinator’s 
approval of the procedure and equipment use d to test Villena’s 
blood. The State argued that Perry’s testimony and the 
licensing letter were sufficient to lay an adequate foundation 
to introduce the blood test result. 
Defense counsel argued that the State did not lay a 
sufficient foundation to introduce scientific evidence because Perry was not qualified as an expert  as required by HRE Rule   
702. Thus, defense counsel argued that Perry’s testimony did not 
11
  
 
 
   
 
   
  
      
   
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
constitute sufficient foundation to prove that the enzymatic method is a sound scientific procedure. 
5. Motion for Judgment of Acquittal 
Following closing arguments, Defense counsel made a 
motion for judgment of acquittal again asserting that the State 
did not lay an adequate foundation to admit evidence of the 
blood test results. The district court denied defense counsel’s 
motion for judgment of acquittal. 
The district court found Villena guilty and sentenced 
Villena to a $400 fine plus court costs, and other mandatory conditions. 
B. ICA Proceedings 
The ICA, in its May 19, 2015 Summary Disposition 
Order, affirmed the Judgment of the district court.  The ICA 
concluded: 1) evidence of Villena’s blood test result was 
properly admitted because the record shows that the DUI coordinator approved the testing procedure and the instrument; 
2) the DUI coordinator licensing letter  was properly admitted as 
a self-authenticated public record; and 3) the blood alcohol 
testing statement was improperly admitted into evidence but that 
error was harmless in light of Exhibit 1 and Perry’s testimony . 
The ICA also determined that Villena waived the argument that 
the State failed to strictly comply with HAR § 11-114-23(a)(3) 
and (b) because Villena did not timely object. As to Villena’s 
12
  
 
 
  
 
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
confrontation rights, the ICA held that the DUI coordinator’s 
licensing letter was a nontestimonial record and therefore not 
subject to the Confrontation Clause. 
II.  Standards of Review 
A. Admissibility of Hearsay 
“[W]here the admissibility of evidence is determined 
by application of the hearsay rule, there can be 
only one 
correct result, and the appropriate standard for appellate 
review is the right/wrong standard. ”   State v. Moore, 82 Hawaiʻ i  
202, 217, 921 P.2d 122, 137 (1996) (internal quotation marks and 
citation omitted).   
B. Evidentiary Foundation 
Before a test result may be introduced into evidence,  
“a foundation must be laid showing that the test result can be 
relied on as a substantive fact.” State v. Werle , 121 Hawaiʻ i  
274, 280, 218 P.3d 762, 768.    “When a question arises regarding 
the necessary foundation for the introduction of evidence, the 
determination of whether proper foundation has been established 
lies within the discretion of the trial court, and its 
determination will not be overturned absent a showing of clear 
abuse.” State v. Eid , 126 Hawai i 430, 440, 272 P.3d 1197, 1207 
(2012) (quoting State v. Assaye , 121 Hawai i 204, 210, 216 P.3d 
1227, 1233 (2009)).  
13

  
 
 
  
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
III.  Discussion 
A.	 The Trial Court Did Not Err in Admitting Villena’s Blood 
Test Results 
To introduce blood test results proving intoxication, 
the State must lay a proper foundation. Werle, 121 Hawai ʻi at  
282, 218 P.3d at 770. “As part of the foundation, the 
prosecution must establish the reliability of the test results 
which establish intoxication.” Id.; see also   State v.   Wallace,  
80 Hawai ʻi 382, 4  07,  910 P.2d 695, 720     (1996) (explaining   “[a]  
fundamental evidentiary   rule is that    before the result    of a test    
made out of court     may be introduced    into evidence, a foundation     
must be laid showing     that the test result     can be relied    on as a    
substantive  fact”  (citation omitted)).       
To determine the reliability of the enzymatic blood 
testing method used here  , the State must show compliance with  
the factors we laid out in  State v. Montalbo .  73 Haw. 130, 828 
P.2d 1274 (1992). Under Montalbo, whether a scientific 
procedure—such as the enzymatic method, which Perry used to test 
Villena’s blood—is reliable depends on  three factors:  (1) the 
validity of the underlying principle, (2) the validity of the 
testing method applying the principle, and (3) the proper 
application of the testing method.  Id. at 136, 828 P.2d at  
1279. To demonstrate the validity of the scientific evidence, 
expert testimony is needed.  Werle, 121 Hawai i at 282, 218 P.3d   
14

  
 
 
   
   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
at 770.  Montalbo requires that the expert’s opinion “have a 
reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of his or her 
discipline.” Werle, 121 Hawaiʻ i at 283, 218 P.3d at 771. 
However, we have recognized a “shortcut” to 
establishing Montalbo  reliability for blood testing procedures 
when the State proves “that the DUI coordinator gave written 
approval of the procedure and instrument used to test 
[defendant’s] blood.”  Werle, 121 Hawai i at 284, 218 P.3d at  
772.  Such written approval by the DUI coordinator “relieves th e 
prosecution of the burden of presenting expert testimony to 
establish the reliability ” of the instrument and procedure  used.  
Id. at 285, 218 P.3d at 773. In other words,  written approval  
from the DUI coordinator  is a shortcut for  the first two factors 
of Montalbo—which  require the State to demonstrate the validity 
of the underlying principle and the validity of the testing method applying the principle.   Accordingly, to lay a foundation 
to admit Villena’s blood test results under the shortcut method, 
the State needed to show 1) that the DUI coordinator gave  
written approval of the enzymatic method and the blood testing instrument (the Werle  shortcut), and 2) that Perry properly 
conducted the enzymatic method on Villena’s blood (the  third 
Montalbo factor).   
15

  
 
 
  
    ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
1. The DUI Coordinator’s Licensing Letter Was Admissible 
Nonhearsay as a Document of Independent Legal 
Significance and Satisfied the Werle Shortcut 
In order to satisfy the  Werle  shortcut, the State  must  
establish that the DUI coordinator gave “ written  approval” of 
the procedure and instrument used.  Werle, 121 Hawaiʻ i  at 283-4, 
218 P.3d at 771-2.  This is in accord  with the statutory 
requirement for blood alcohol testing procedures to “have been 
approved in writing by the DUI coordinator.” HAR § 11 -114-
22(a). Here, the written approval   of the procedure and 
instrument is a letter to Perry, dated November 5, 2011, from 
the DUI coordinator. The letter states that it “constitutes a 
license for the City and County of Honolulu Health Services 
Division Laboratory to conduct blood alcohol testing in 
accordance with Hawaii  Administrative Rules, Title 11, Chapter 
114 (HAR-11-114).” The letter explains that the licensure of 
the Laboratory was  based on the Laboratory “having fulfilled 
requirements of HAR-11-114-18(b).”   In addition, the letter 
confirms that the Ace Alera instrument   was approved “to be used 
for the determinat ion of blood alcohol concentration.” 
Specifically, the letter states that “[t]he addition of the ACE -
ALERA Clinical Chemistry analyzer . . . to the ‘Quantitative 
Enzymatic Determination of Alcohol’ procedure [] has been  
evaluated” as meeting the requiremen ts of HAR § 11-114-22.  This 
letter is precisely the type of evidence the Werle  shortcut 
16

  
 
 
  
  
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
requires. Unlike the licensing letter at issue in Werle which 
we found deficient for failing to mention the precise testing 
method and instrument used, the licensing letter here 
specifically approves the instrument and method used to test 
Villena’s blood. See Werle, 121 Hawai ʻi at 284, 218 P.3d at 772.  
Accordingly, the licensing letter satisfies the Werle shortcut 
to show that the DUI coordinator gave written approval of the 
method and instrument used to test the defendant’s blood. 
However,  Villena asserts the court erred in admitting 
the letter because it was inadmissible hearsay.  Hearsay is a 
“statement, other than one made by the declarant while 
testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.” HRE Rule 801  (2012).   This 
definition is identical to that contained in the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) Rule 801(c).   Hearsay “is not admissible 
except as provided by these rules[.]” HRE Rule 802  (2012).  It 
is well-settled that statements  of independent legal  
significance are not hearsay. 
See  FRE Rule 802(c) cmt.  (“If the 
significance of an offered statement lies solely in the fact that it was made, no issue is raised as to the truth of anything 
asserted, and the statement is not hearsay. ”); see also   A. 
Bowman, Hawaiʻ i R ules of Evidence Manual 8-7 (2016)   
(characterizing as nonhearsay statements with “ independent legal 
significance” which “are not offered to prove the truth of the 
17

matter asserted”). This type of evidence is  considered 
nonhearsay because  the statements are not  “offered to prove the 
truth of the matter stated ” but  instead are  “offered simply to 
show that the statement was made.” West Coast Truck Lines, Inc. 
v. Arcata Community Recycling Center, Inc. , 846 F.2d 1239, 1246 
n.5 (9th Cir. 1988); see also Gonzales v. City of San Jose  , 2015 
WL 2398407, *6 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (noting that admission of a copy 
of a driver’s license into evidence was “hearsay to the extent 
offered to establish Plaintiff's height, weight, and appearance 
on February 13, 2012, as asserted in the license, but not 
hearsay to the extent offered to show the identifying 
information in the Department of Motor Vehicle's records and 
available to Defendants on that day”) . This doctrine is often 
applied to evidence of contractual agreements. See Island  
Directory Co. Inc. v. Iva’s Kinimaka Enterprises, Inc. , 10 Haw. 
App. 15, 21-22, 859 P.2d 935, 939 (1993).  In Island Directory , 
two parties disputed  the existence of a valid contract.  Id. at  
20, 859 P.2d at 939. One party sought to introduce a written 
document which the  other party admitted signing.  Id.   The ICA 
held that the document was nonhearsay  because it “was not 
offered into evidence to prove the truth of its contents, but to 
prove that it was made, signed by Iva, and expressed the legal 
relationship of the parties.” Id.  at 22, 859 P.2d at 939-40.   
The existence of the document was  “highly rel evant because its

  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
legal effect [was]  at issue in the case.” Id.   Similarly, 
Professor Bowman uses as an illustration 
of a nonhearsay 
statement of independent legal significance a declaration by an 
insured that “I hereby cancel my insurance policy.” A. Bowman, 
Hawaiʻi Rules of  Evidence Manual 8-7 (2016).   Because these words 
effect a cancellation, they are “not only evidence, but 
accomplish the legal event. The words effect  the cancellation 
as surely as words of slander produce a tort.” Id.    
Likewise here, the licensing letter was not being 
introduced to prove the truth of its contents, but rather because its legal effect (
that the lab had received written 
approval from the DUI coordinator licensing its instruments and 
methods) was at issue in the case.6 To satisfy the Werle 
shortcut for laying a proper foundation to introduce blood test results, the State must show “that the DUI coordinator gave 
written approval of the procedure and instrument used to test 
[the defendant’s] blood.” Werle, 121 Hawaiʻ i at 284, 218 P.3d at 
772. The State introduced the licensing letter to show that the 
DUI coordinator had given written approval of the enzymatic 
method and the blood testing instrument used to test Villena’s 
blood. 
6 In seeking to admit the letter into evidence, the State described 
it as “a letter, um, which from them [the State] went to Ms. Karla Perry 
which purports to establish – uh, constitute a license that the City and 
County of Honolulu is licensed to conduct the blood alcohol testing.”

Accordingly, we hold that the licensing letter was 
admissible as nonhearsay and conclude that the trial court did 
not err in admitting the letter.7 Because we find the letter 
admissible, we also conclude that the State met its burden under the Werle shortcut to demonstrate that the State gave written 
approval of the enzymatic method and Ace Alera instrument. 
2. Perry’s Testimony Satisfied the Third Montalbo Factor and 
Therefore the State Laid a Proper Foundation to Admit the 
Results of Villena’s Blood Test R esults 
Having found that the State met its burden under the 
Werle shortcut to satisfy the first two Montalblo factors, we 
next look to the final Montalbo 
factor, which requires the State 
to demonstrate “the proper application of the technique on the particular occasion.” 
Montalbo , 73 Haw. at 136, 828 P.2d at 
1279. Perry testified that she was employed as a medical 
technologist with the City and County of Honolulu and was 
qualified under HAR Title 11, chapter 114, which regulates blood 
alcohol testing, to draw blood and perform alcohol analysis.  
She testified that she was licensed by the State as both an 
alcohol analyst and an alcohol testing supervisor. Perry 
testified that she used the “Ace Alera” instrument manufactured 
by Alpha Wasserman 
to conduct blood tests based on the 
7 Because we conclude that the licensing letter is not hearsay, we 
do not reach Villena’s asserted error th at admission of the letter violated 
his right to confrontation. However, this does not connote our agreement 
with the ICA conclusion that, as nontestimonial hearsay, the licensing letter 
was “not subject to the Confrontation Clause.”

“enzymatic method,” the instrument and method approved by the 
DUI coordinator in the licensing letter. Perry’s testimony that 
she was licensed by the State and tested Villena’s blood using 
the approved instrument and method satisfies the third Montalbo 
requirement to demonstrate “the proper application of the 
technique on the particular occasion.” 
Accordingly, we 
conclude that the State met the burden 
laid out in Werle and Montalbo to establish a foundation to 
8introduce Villena’s blood test results.
IV.  Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the ICA’s June 
16, 2015 Judgment on Appeal but for the reasoning set forth 
herein.

Appellant     /s/ Paula A. Nakayama

8 Villena raises two additional issues in his application for 
certiorari, both of which are without merit. We affirm the ICA in concluding 
that Villena waived any objection regarding strict compliance with HAR § 11-
114-23(b) and (a)(3) by failing to timely object at tria l. 
We also affirm the ICA in concluding that the erroneous admission 
of the State’s Exhibit 2 (a sworn statement by Perry providing additional 
detail regarding the procedures used to test Villena’s blood) was harmless 
error. Perry’s oral testimony and the licensing letter provided sufficient 
foundation for the State to admit the results from Villena’s blood test. Accordingly, any error in admitting Exhibit 2 was harmless.
