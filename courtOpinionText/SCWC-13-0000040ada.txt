 Association of Condominium Homeowners of Tropics at 
  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”). In light of our 
decision in 
Waikele v. Sakuma, 131 Hawai i 254, 318 P.3d 94 (2013), which was 
issued about one month after the Dismissal Order, we hold that 
the ICA erred in dismissing as untimely the Amasols’ appeal from 
the December 31, 2012 order denying their April 16, 2012 motion 
for reconsideration and the decisions for which reconsideration 
had been sought. Clarifying our opinion in Sakuma
, however, we 
also hold that the ICA did not err in dismissing as premature  
any attempted appeal of the Amasols’ July 13, 2012 amended 
reconsideration motion, because the circuit court has not 
entered an order disposing of that motion. We therefore vacate the ICA’s Dismissal Order in part, and remand to the ICA for 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  
I. Background 
The Amasols fell behind on their mortgage payments
, 
and their lender, “Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, a 
National Banking Association, as Trustee of the Indymac INDX 
Mortgage Loan Trust 2006-AR12, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates Series 2006-AR12, Under the Pooling and Servicing 
Agreement Dated July 1, 2006” (“the Bank”) commenced a non -
judicial foreclosure sale of the property. The Bank 
subsequently acquired the property at auction, and filed an 
ejectment action in the district court.  The district court

    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
denied the Bank’s summary judgment motion for lack of 
jurisdiction in light of a title challenge raised by the 
Amasols, and the action was re-filed in the Circuit Court  of the 
First Circuit (“circuit court”).    
On April 12, 2012, the circuit c
ourt1 entered an order 
granting summary judgment in favor of the Bank, Judgment for Possession, and a Writ of Possession (collectively, “the April 
12th orders”). On April 16, 2012, the Amasols, proceeding pro 
se, timely filed a “Motion to Reconsider Ruling” (“Motion to 
Reconsider”). On July 13, 2012, the Amasols, represented by 
counsel, filed their “Defendants’ Amended Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief from Judgment; for Evidentiary Hearing and for Leave To 
File Amended Answer” (“Amended Rule 60(b) Motion”). On December 
31, 2012, approximately 260 days after the Motion to Reconsider was filed, the circuit court entered an “Order Denying 
Defendant’s [sic] Motion to Reconsider Ruling.” The circui t 
court has not, however, entered any order disposing of the Amended Rule 60(b) Motion. 
On January 23, 2013, the Amasols filed their notice of 
appeal. On November 20, 2013, the ICA filed its Dismissal 
Order. The ICA determined that the appeal from the April 12th 
orders and the Motion to Reconsider was untimely because the 
appeal was not filed within 30 days of the date the motion was

  The time for filing a notice of appeal is governed by 
HRAP Rule 4, which provides in relevant part:  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
deemed denied under Rule 4(a)(3) (2012) of the Hawai i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (“HRAP”). With respect to the Am ended Rule 
60(b) Motion, the ICA ruled that the appeal was premature 
because the circuit court had not entered a written order 
denying the motion. 
II. Standard of Review 
“The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law 
that we review de novo under 
the right/wrong standard.” State 
v.
 Bohannon, 102 Hawai i 228, 232, 74 P.3d 980, 984 (2003) 
(citations omitted). 
III. Discussion 
Rule 4. APPEALS -WHEN TAKEN.
 (a) Appeals in civil cases.
 (1) TIME AND PLACE OF FILING . When a civil appeal is permitted 
by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after 
entry of the judgment or appealable order. . . .
 (2) PREMATURE FILING OF APPEAL . If a notice of appeal is filed 
after announcement of a decision but before entry of the judgment or order, such notice shall be considered as filed immediately 
after the time the judgment or order becomes final for the 
purpose of appeal.
 (3) T
IME TO APPEAL AFFECTED BY POST -JUDGMENT MOTIONS . If any party 
files a timely motion for judgment as a matter of law, to amend findings or make additional findings, for a new trial, to 
reconsider, alter or amend the judgment or order, or for 
attorney’s fees or costs, the time for filing the notice of 
appeal is extended until 30 days after entry of an order 
disposing of the motion; provided, that the failure to dispose of 
any motion by order entered upon the record within 90 days after 
the date the motion was filed shall constitute a denial of the 
motion. 
On December 17, 2013, shortly after the ICA issued its 
Dismissal Order, we announced our opinion in Sakuma, 131 Hawai i 
4

      
 
   
  
 
  
 
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
254, 318 P.3d 94.  In Sakuma, we held that when a timely post-
judgment tolling motion is deemed denied, the 30-day deadline 
for filing a notice of appeal is not triggered until entry of 
the judgment or appealable order pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) 
(2012) and (a)(3). 131 Hawai i at 256, 318 P.3d at 96.  
In the instant case, the written order disposing of 
the Motion to Reconsider was filed on December 31, 2012, and the 
Amasols filed their appeal of that order within 30 days, on 
January 23, 2013. Therefore, pursuant to Sakuma, the ICA had 
appellate jurisdiction over the denial of the Motion to Reconsider, as well as of the underlying April 12th orders. We 
therefore vacate that portion of the ICA’s Dismissal Order that ruled to the contrary, and remand to the ICA for consideration 
of the relevant issues on appeal. 
There was, howe ver, no order disposing of the Amasols’ 
July 13, 2012 Amended Rule 60(b) Motion. In addition, there was 
no announcement of a decision on that motion that could have 
triggered HRAP Rule 4(a)(2) (2012). Therefore, the ICA properly 
ruled that the notice of appeal was premature with respect to the Amended Rule 60(b) Motion. 
We also write to clarify Sakuma to the extent the 
dictum that the “ICA had jurisdiction,” 131 Hawaii at 255, 318 
P.3d at 95, may have caused confusion. In Sakuma, as in this 
case with respect to the Amended Rule 60(b) Motion, the notice 
5
      
 
    
  
  
 
   
       
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
of appeal was premature. The ICA therefore properly held that 
it lacked jurisdiction over this portion of the appeal. 
IV. Conclusion 
We vacate the portion of the ICA Dismissal Order 
holding that it lacked appellate jurisdiction over the appeal of 
the April 12th orders and the Motion to Reconsider. We affirm 
the portion of the ICA Dismissal Order dismissing any appeal of 
the Amended Rule 60(b) Motion, and remand for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
