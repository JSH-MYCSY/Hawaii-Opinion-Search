ORDER DISMISSING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
On September 26, 2014, Petitioner/Claimant-Appellant
 
Shirley Piso Pico filed a “Motion for Reconsideration and
 
Declaration” of the September 17, 2014 order rejecting her
 application for writ of certiorari. The rejection of an
 application for writ of certiorari is not subject to a motion for
 reconsideration in the supreme court. See HRAP 40.1(h) (“Neither
 
acceptance nor rejection of an application for writ of certiorari
 shall be subject to a motion for reconsideration in the supreme
 court.”). Moreover, there is no basis for clarification of the 
September 17, 2014 order. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Petitioner’s motion is 
dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, October 6, 2014.
