RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, POLLACK, AND WILSON, JJ.  
  
OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J.
 
The sole issue raised in 
Petitioner Ikaika Reed’s 
application for writ of certiorari is whether the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals (ICA) gravely erred in holding that the trial 
court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Reed ’s motion  
  
  
 
 
  
  
   
  
     
  
                         
   
 
  
 
 
  
   
  
     
 
 
    
     
 
 
 
  
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
to substitute retained counsel in place of his court-appointed 
counsel. We agree with Reed that the circuit court abused its 
discretion, resulting in a denial of his right to privately 
retained counsel of choice under article 1, section 14 of the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution.  Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s June 9, 
2014 judgment on appeal affirming the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit’s (circuit court)1 judgment of conviction and sentence 
for assault in the first degree. 
I. Background 
Reed was arraigned on June 21, 2012 for the charge of 
assault in the first degree2 in violation of Hawaiʻ i Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 707-710.3 At that time he was assigned the 
trial week of August 20, 2012.4 If convicted, Reed faced a ten -
1 The Honorable Dexter D. Del Rosario presided. 
2 The allegations against Reed stemmed from an incident that 
occurred at Waianae Boat Harbor. In the early morning of June 10, 2012, 
Alvin Kalahiki and a few of his family members and friends were “talking 
story” at the boat harbor following a fundraiser they attended at a bar 
nearby. Kalahiki testified that while at the boat harbor, he and Reed were involved in an altercation, wherein Reed punched him in the face while 
holding a knife.  Kalahiki suffered a laceration that extended from “ the tip 
of his ear to the tip of his nose. ” 
3 HRS § 707- 710 (2014) provides, as it did at the time of the 
offense: 
(1) A person commits the offense of assault in the 
first degree if the person intentionally or knowingly causes serious bodily injury to another person. 
(2) Assault in the first degree is a class B felony. 
4 Following the arraignment, the State filed a notice of 
eligibility for sentencing pursuant to HRS §§ 706-661 and 706 -662(1).  Under 
(continued. . .)

  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
year sentence with a possible mandatory minimum of three years 
and four months without the possibility of parole, based on his 
potential status as a repeat offender.5 The Office of the Public 
Defender was appointed as his counsel on July 5, 2012.  
Twenty-seven days later, on August 1, 2012, Reed ’s 
deputy public defender (DPD) orally made his first motion to continue trial because he had not yet received a recording of 
the grand jury proceedings. The State did not object and 
informed the court that it had not yet provided Reed with all 
discovery. The circuit court granted the continuance and set 
trial for October 1, 2012.  
On September 25, 2012 —approximately ninety days after 
his arraignment —Reed filed a second motion to continue.  The 
DPD’s declaration filed along with the motion stated that the death of one of Reed’s percipient witness es, the State’s recent 
disclosure of three witnesses and release of additional 
these statutes, based on Reed’s previous convictions, he could be s ubject to 
a twenty
-year term of imprisonment.  See HRS §§ 706- 661(3), 706-662(1) 
(2014). The State did not pursue such an extended sentence following Reed’s 
conviction.
 
5 Class B felonies, such as assault in the first degree, are 
subject to a maximum indeterminate sentence of ten years imprisonment.  HRS § 
706-660(1)(a) (2014).  Pursuant to HRS § 706-606.5(1) -(2) (2014), individuals 
convicted of Class B felonies, who have certain previous felony convictions 
within the relevant time period, will be subject to mandatory minimum periods of imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Here, Reed had a previous 
conviction that qualified him for “a mandatory minimum period of imprisonment 
without possibility of parole” of three years and four months. HRS § 706-
606.5(1)(a)(iii).

  The next day, at the September 26, 2012  trial call,   the 
circuit court inquired as to the State’s position  on Reed’s 
request for a continuance.  The State informed the court  that it 
was ready for trial, noted that the DPD  ’s declaration was 
accurate, and made no objection to Reed ’s second motion to 
continue. The circuit court proceeded to ask the parties about 
Reed’s terroristic threatening  case, which was also before the 
7 court.   Ultimately, the court granted Reed ’s second motion to 
                         
   
 
  
    
  
    
  
    
  
   
   
     
   
 
   
   
  
 
  
 
 
   
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
statements from the complaining witness, and the need to 
interview recently discovered defense witnesses required a 
6continuance.
6 Specifically, the declaration stated in relevant part: 
b. On September 19, 2012, I learned that one of 
the defense’s percipient witnesses . . . was 
murdered the week before; 
c. On September 20, 2012, the State provided 
notice and contact information for at least two (2) 
additional witnesses. At that time, the State also 
disclosed additional statements from the complaining 
witnesses [sic] that were not previously known and 
that contradict his prior statements; 
d. On September 24, 2012, the State provided 
contact information for a third new witness; e. I recently received information for additional 
defense witnesses that I have not had the opportunity 
to confirm or disclose to the State; 
f. I need additional time to investigate this 
case, to obtain additional evidence, and to locate 
and interview witnesses[.] 
7 The record indicates that Reed was represented by private counsel 
in the terroristic threatening case.

 Two weeks later, at the trial call on October 10, 
2012, the DPD notified the court that Reed was  “in the process 
of potentially retaining other counsel.”   On this basis and the 
declaration that Reed was “still in the process of obtaining 
witness information,”  including contacting a potential 
percipient witness,  the DPD requested a third continuance with 
8 no objection from the State.   The court did not address the 
DPD’s statement regarding Reed ’s intent to substitute  counsel.  
It denied the third motion to continue, after concluding 
sufficient time had transpired for identification and 
preparation of defense witnesses:  
 
 
 
                         
  
 
 
    ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
continue and reset the trial for October 15, 2012 with a trial 
call on October 10, 2012. The court stated that the first 
degree assault case would function as the “prime case ” and the 
terroristic threatening case as the “backup” case, noting that 
if the assault case were continued, the court would proceed on 
the terroristic threatening case.  
THE COURT: In exercising the [c]ourt ’s discretion on 
whether to grant the continuance on the eve of trial, the 
[c]ourt will follow the criteria that the Supreme Court had 
made out in State v. Reid .[9]  First of all, as a matter of 
policy, continuance [ ] made on the eve of trial is viewed 
with disfavor, and when it ’s done on the basis for absence 
of witnesses, the [c]ourt must make a determination as to 
who is this witness, the substance of their testimony, 
whether a diligent effort was made to secure the attendance 
8 The circuit court did not inquire as to the State’s position on 
the continuance prior to making its ruling.  
9 It is unclear which case the circuit court was referring to.

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
of this witness, the likelihood of the availability of this 
witness in the future. And based on the record before this 
court it is speculative at this point what that witness 
would have, so the continuance is denied.  I should note 
that this case has been continued from -- twice already, 
and this would be a third continuance.  So the [c]ourt believes that there’ s been sufficient time to inform these 
witnesses. The motion is denied . . . . 
At the same hearing, the court addressed Reed ’s previously-filed 
motion to continue his terroristic threatening case.  The court 
granted the motion to continue the terroristic threatening case 
and reset the trial for February 19, 2013.  
Five days later, on the day of trial and prior to jury 
selection, Reed appeared with retained counsel and renewed his 
request for a trial continuance.  The DPD moved to withdraw as trial counsel, stating that Reed retained private attorney 
Clayton Kimoto to represent him. Again, the court did not 
inquire as to the State’s position on Reed ’s motion, and the 
State made no objection.  The circuit court appeared to be about 
to deny Reed’s request for substitution of his privately 
retained counsel when Reed addressed the court.  He explained to 
the court that he lost confidence in his attorney because the 
DPD did not engage in timely preparation of defense witnesses, 
did not return phone calls regarding witnesses, and failed to 
timely inform Reed of the State’s disclosure of additional 
witnesses before trial. On this basis, Reed asked the court to permit his retained counsel to represent him so that he could 
receive a fair trial: 
6
  
  THE COURT:  Should I grant this motion, will new 
counsel be ready to pick a jury this morning and to proceed 
to trial?  
 
  
 
  
   
  
  
   
 
 
 
   
   
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 And I told him that I have like ten more witnesses, 
and he no even call. I call his phone, everything, he no return my call, then he return’ em like what, five days 
later.  He get --  he has three more witnesses --  them have 
three more witnesses. He contacted him, he didn ’t even 
tell me  they had three more witnesses.  Just like he ’s 
misrepresenting me all this time. That’ s how I feel, 
that’s why I like withdraw. All I ask is for one fair 
trial, Your Honor.  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
MR. KIMOTO:  May I speak, Your Honor? 
THE COURT:  Yes, you may. 
MR. KIMOTO:  Thank you. 
THE COURT:  And could you just state your name for the 
record. 
MR. KIMOTO: Oh, yes. 
Clayton Kimoto, Your Honor. 
[Reed] was in conversation with me, and I told him that I ’d 
represent him, but it was contingent of course upon the 
[c]ourt granting a continuance. I am not ready to proceed 
to trial at this time, Your Honor, because I have not had a 
chance to interview him. 
I believe just in my conversation with [Reed
], there 
are a number of witnesses that he intends to call for his case, and I have not had a chance to interview any of them. 
THE COURT:  When were you contacted? 
MR. KIMOTO:  I was first contacted 
-- pardon me, Your 
Honor, if I may look at my notes. It was sometime last 
week, Your Honor, it was just before -- the day before last 
week’s trial call, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Okay, 
the [c]ourt is prepared to rule.  
This issue has [] already been addressed by the appellate 
court. I believe there ’s a case in which under identical 
circumstances the defendant had sought to replace counsel on the eve of trial, and the [c]ourt -
-
[DPD]: I
’m sorry for interrupting, Your Honor. I 
believe that [Reed] did want to speak to the [c]ourt as 
well, if the [c]ourt wants to entertain [Reed]. 
[REED]: The reason for my withdrawing my counsel is 
because the first time we went continue the case, he was on vacation, he couldn ’t talk to my witnesses, nothing.  
So he 
went continue that one, and the next one he went continue ’em, he end up calling my witnesses two days before 
trial call just last week. 
7
  
    
  
THE COURT:   
 
 
 
 [DPD]: Given that there is no ethics complaint, I 
don’t believe that there ’s an appropriate forum in which to  
address attorney/client communications, Judge.  
 
  Notwithstanding the lack of response to Reed’s 
complaints regarding his counsel and without asking the State 
its position on the motion, the court found Reed ’s request 
“dilatory,”  denied Reed’s motion for withdrawal and 
substitution, and elected to proceed with trial:  
 THE COURT: Again, I ’m not going to --  well, the case 
I was talking about, let me address the first issue 
regarding whether new counsel is ready to proceed.  The  
appellate court ’s already addressed that issue, and they ’ve 
left it in  the discretion of the [c]ourt, and  [the] [c]ourt  
looks with disfavor on the replacement of counsel and 
motion to withdraw on the eve of trial, as it may be at 
times and I think in this  case it can be considered as a 
dilatory tactic.  
 However, the courts have allowed withdrawal when new 
counsel is ready to proceed to trial; however, that ’s not 
the case here. And I had indicated on more than one 
occasion that the [c]ourt  wanted to start this case.  
Because [Reed]  has several cases, the [c]ourt wanted to 
start trying these cases, so the record was clear and it ’s 
clear to all the parties that the [c]ourt was going to  
proceed with these cases, so I ’m going to deny the motion  
to withdraw as counsel.   
 
  Following a short recess, the parties conducted voir 
dire and a jury was impaneled. That afternoon, the State called   
its first two witnesses. After the second trial day,  the jury 
found Reed guilty of assault in the first degree.  The circuit 
court sentenced Reed to ten years in prison with a mandatory ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
The DPD did not respond to Reed’s allegations: 
[DPD], do you wish to respond? 
. . . . 
We have a jury ready to proceed, we ’ll take a recess 
and bring in the jury. The [c]ourt will stand in recess.

minimum of three years and four months without the possibility 
of parole. See supra note 5. 
Reed appealed the 
judgment of conviction and sentence 
to the ICA, contending the circuit court abused its discretion 
in denying his motion for withdrawal and substitution of 
counsel. The ICA held that there were “factors supporting as 
well as weighing against Reed’s request,” and noted that it 
could not “conclude that the [c]ircuit [c]ourt’s asses sment that 
Reed’s request was made for dilatory purposes was clearly 
wrong.”  State v. Reed , No. CAAP-13-0000069, 2014 WL 1658569, at 
*5 (App. Apr. 25, 2014) (mem. op.). The ICA therefore affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence.  Id.   
II. Discussion 
Reed contends that 
the circuit court abused its 
discretion in denying his motion for withdrawal and substitution of counsel. As explained below, we agree and conclude that Reed 
was denied his right to privately retained counsel of choice 
under the Hawai ʻi Constitution. 
In State v. Maddagan,  we recognized that the right to 
counsel provided by the sixth amendment to the United States 
Constitution and article 1, section 14 of the Hawaiʻ i 
Constitution “ encompasses a right to privately retained counsel 
of choice.” 95 Hawaiʻ i 177, 179-80 , 19 P.3d 1289, 1291-92

 11  In Gonzalez -Lopez, the United  States  Supreme Court also  quoted  
from Arizona v. Fulminate  to explain  structural errors as follows:  
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
(2001).10 The right to retained counsel of choice is among those 
constitutional rights deemed of such importance that deprivation 
of the right is recognized as amounting to structural error. 
See State v. Cramer,  129 Hawai ʻi 296, 303, 299 P.3d 756, 763 
(2013) (citing United States  v. Gonzalez-Lopez , 548 U.S. 140, 
150 (2006)). A structural error “affect[s] the framework within 
which the trial proceeds ” as opposed to “an error in the trial 
process itself. ” State v. Ortiz , 91 Hawaiʻ i 181, 193, 981 P.2d 
1127, 1139 (1999) (
quoting Arizona v. Fulminate, 499 U.S. 279, 
310 (1991)) (internal quotation mark omitted).11 Accordingly, 
10 The sixth amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees 
that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . 
to have the [a]ssistance of [c]ounsel for his defen[s]e.” Similarly, article 
1, section 14 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution provides that “[i]n all criminal 
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the assistance 
of counsel for the accused’s defense.” 
The second class of constitutional error we called  
“structural defects.”  These “defy analysis by 
‘harmless- error’  standards”  because they “affec[t] 
the framework within which the trial proceeds, ”  and 
are not “ simply an error in the trial process 
itself.” [Fulminate , 499 U.S. at 309  -10.]  See also  
Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 7 –9 (1999).   Such 
errors include the denial of counsel, see  Gideon v. 
Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335  (1963), the denial of the 
right of self- representation, see McKaskle v.  
Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168,  177–178, n.8  (1984), the 
denial of the right to public trial, see Waller v.  
Georgia, 467 U.S. 39, 49, n.9  (1984), and the denial 
of the right to trial by jury by the giving of a 
defective reasonable -doubt instruction, see Sullivan 
v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275 (1993).   
 
548 U.S. at 148- 49 (first alteration in original) (footnote omitted).  Our 
court has also recognized that structural errors are not subject to harmless 
(continued. . .) 
10
  
   
 
  
    
                         
  
  
   
  
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
    ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
structural errors, including the denial of the right to retained 
counsel of choice, are not subject to harmless error review.  
This is because the integrity of our system of justice requires 
that the accused receive retained counsel of choice. As Justice 
Scalia noted in Gonzalez-Lopez , the sixth amendment right to 
counsel of choice 
commands,  not that a trial be fair, but that a particular 
guarantee of fairness be provided —to wit, that the accused 
be defended by the counsel he believes to be best.   “The 
Constitution guarantees a fair trial through the Due 
Process Clauses, but it defines the basic elements of a 
fair trial largely through the several provisions of the 
[s]ixth [a]mendment, including the [c]ounsel [c]lause.”   
548 U.S. at 146 (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 
684-85 (1984)).  It is beyond cavil that the accused ’s access to 
justice depends on his or her right to retained counsel of 
choice. Indeed, inherent in the right to retained counsel of 
choice is the recognition that the accused should have  
confidence and trust in his or her counsel, and accordingly, in 
12 the judicial system as a whole.    
(. . . continued)
  
error analysis. See, e.g.
, Ortiz, 91 Hawaiʻ i at 193, 981 P.2d at 1139 
(holding that the denial of a public trial is considered a structural defect 
and on this basis vacating the conviction).  
There has been criticism of the dichotomy created between 
structural errors subject to automatic reversal and trial errors subject to a 
harmless error analysis. See, e.g. , Cramer, 129 Hawai ʻi at 304-12, 299 P.3d 
at 764-71 (Acoba, J., concurring).  We need not resolve this issue, however, 
in deciding the instant case. 
12 As articulated by Justice Stevens, courts should acknowledge the 
importance of “the function of the independent lawyer as a guardian of our 
freedom.” Wheat v. United States , 486 U.S. 153, 172 (1988) (Stevens, J., 
dissenting) (citation omitted) (internal quotation mark omitted) . 
11
  
   Commensurate with the importance of the right to 
retained counsel of choice, a presumption in its favor arises 
that must be overcome before it is denied.  Wheat v. United 
States, 486 U.S. 153, 164 (1988).  Thus, in Maddagan, we held 
that in consider
ing a motion for withdrawal and  substitution of 
counsel, a trial court must give “[d]ue regard  for [the]   
proposition”  that “in light of the right  to counsel, and in the 
absence of countervailing considerations, a criminal defendant 
should have his,  her, or its choice of retained counsel.” 95 
Hawaiʻi at 180, 1  9 P.3d at 1292.  
  
       
 
  
      
   
                         
   
    ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
In Cramer , this court “examine[d] the 
countervailing 
governmental interests that should be balanced against the right 
to counsel of choice. ”13 129 Hawaiʻ i at 301, 299 P.3d at 761. 
Cramer was found guilty of several drug-related charges and at 
his sentencing hearing, his privately retained counsel appeared 
on his behalf, seeking to step in for the deputy public defender 
and requesting a three-week continuance to prepare.  Id. at 296 -
97, 299 P.3d at 756-57.  The trial court denied Cramer ’s motion 
for substitution of counsel and a continuance, stating that it 
was “untimely. ” Id. at 298, 299 P.3d at 758.   
To review the trial court’s ruling, we looked to cases 
from other jurisdictions that identified countervailing 
13 Cramer was decided approximately six months after the trial in 
the instant case. 
12
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
    
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
interests that should be balanced against the right to private 
counsel of choice.  First, we cited a California case that 
determined the following factors should be considered by the 
trial court in deciding a motion for substitution of counsel 
made on the day of trial: 
(1) length of the continuance; (2) whether there was a 
dilatory motive for the continuance; (3) whether the 
prosecution knew of the motions beforehand and whether the 
prosecution objected; (4) whether the delay would have 
inconvenienced the prosecution or its witnesses; (5) 
whether current court -appointed counsel was prepared to 
proceed; (6) whether the defendant had already retained private counsel; and (7) whether the continuance would 
interfere with the efficient administration of justice [.] 
Id. at 301, 299 P.3d at 761 (citing People v. Butcher , 79 Cal. 
Rptr. 618, 621 (Cal. Ct. App. 1969)).  We also discussed a 
Wisconsin case in which the appellate court affirmed the trial 
court’s denial of a request for substitution of counsel one week 
prior to trial, after considering: (1) “the length of the delay 
requested”; (2) “whether competent counsel was presently 
available” and ready to proceed; (3) prior continuances; (4) 
inconvenience to the court, parties, and witnesses; and (5) 
“whether the delay was for legitimate reasons or whether its 
purpose was dilatory. ” Id. 
at 301-02, 299 P.3d at 761-62 
(citing State v. Prineas , 766 N.W.2d 206, 212 (Wis. Ct. App. 
2009)). 
Turning to the facts of Cramer ’
s case, we noted that 
the circuit court only considered one factor —the “timeliness of 
13
  
     
 
 
 
 
  As in Cramer, the record here does not reflect that 
the circuit court properly balanced Reed ’s right to counsel of 
choice against countervailing interests.  The circuit court 
supported its denial of Reed ’s motion for withdrawal and 
substitution of counsel by stating  that the  request was made “on 
the eve of trial ”  and new counsel was not ready to proceed ;  and  
by invoking the  efficient administration of justice, given that   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
the request”— and failed to address other relevant factors, 
including “the length of the delay requested, the impact of the 
delay on the prosecution, witnesses or the court, and whether the delay was for a dilatory purpose.” Id. at 302, 299 P.3d at 
762. We held that consideration of such factors led to a conclusion that Cramer’s right to retained counsel was violated, 
citing the lack of prejudice to the State, the absence of 
evidence that delay would inconvenience witnesses or the court, 
and the fact that a previous continuance was stipulated:  
The State took no position on the request and there was no 
apparent prejudice to the State.  The record does not 
establish that the circuit court would have been inconvenienced by the request, particularly given that it subsequently ordered a one -week continuance of the 
sentencing hearing. The record also does not establish that there were witnesses present at the initial hearing 
who would be inconvenienced by a continuance.  Furthermore, 
there had been only one prior continuance in the 
proceeding, which was a stipulated continuance of the trial 
from September 16, 2010 to November 4, 2010. Under the 
circumstances, the court ’s summary denial of the motion for 
substitution and a continuance as untimely was an abuse of discretion.

Reed had another criminal case pending and a jury was ready.  
The court also concluded, without explanation, that Reed ’s 
motion could be considered a “dilatory tactic. ” 
However, these factors were either unsupported by the 
record or insufficient to outweigh Reed ’s constitutional right 
to retained counsel of choice.  For one, as to the circuit 
court’s consideration of the purpose behind the request, Reed ’s 
contention that “[n]othing in the record . . . supports the 
conclusion that [his] request to retain private counsel was simply a ploy to delay his trial ” is persuasive. At no time did 
the State express concern that Reed engaged in tactics of delay. All continuances were justified efforts by Reed and the State to 
obtain grand jury transcripts, discovery, and potential 
witnesses. The DPD informed the court at the trial call the 
week before trial of Reed ’s intention of obtaining substitute 
counsel and Reed continued to seek new counsel despite the court’s denial of his motion to continue. At the time of trial, Reed had procured private counsel, and his statements regarding 
appointed counsel ’s failure to prepare adequately for trial 
provided justification for his desire to substitute counsel, even at that late stage of the proceeding. 
Regarding the issue of timeliness, while the court 
noted the motion for substitution was made “ on the eve of 
15
  
  
 
 
    
   
  Although the circuit court’s concern that new counsel 
was not ready to proceed to trial was a pertinent  consideration, 
the court did not establish an additional crucial fact —the 
length of the continuance being requested.  Absent that 
information, the court could not properly weigh this factor. 
Moreover, the court could not reasonably expect Reed’s private 
counsel to be ready for trial prior to his formal entry into the 
case.

trial,” it failed to consider that Reed had previously notified 
the court of his desire to substitute his counsel.  Specifically, at the trial call held the week before trial, Reed 
moved for a continuance because he was “in the process of 
potentially retaining other counsel”
14 and because he was 
obtaining additional witness information. The circuit court denied Reed’s motion. Because there were only two business days 
between the trial call and the start of trial, Reed was left 
with little opportunity to renew his request for substitution of 
counsel after the court denied his request for a continuance. 
The remaining factor the circuit court relied on — 
inconvenience to the court, because a jury was ready to proceed 
and Reed had another criminal case pending —was an appropriate 
circumstance for the court to consider.  We are mindful that the

  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
efficient administration of justice is an important issue for 
the trial court to address when deciding on a motion for 
withdrawal and substitution of counsel. However, there is 
nothing in the record to explain the extent of the inconvenience 
to the court and nothing that indicates the court would not have 
been able to accommodate Reed’s trial at a later date . 
Moreover, the court failed to consider several factors 
that weighed in favor of granting Reed ’s motion.  As in Cramer , 
the State did not take a position on Reed ’s request, and there 
is no evidence in the record that the State would be prejudiced by a delay or that witnesses would have been inconvenienced. In 
addition, the court did not consider the length of the delay 
requested, as it made no inquiry as to how much time private 
counsel would need to be ready for trial.  In terms of prior 
case delay, while the court previously granted Reed two 
continuances, both were brief, justified, and unopposed. The 
first continuance was granted because discovery had not been completed and the second continuance was granted after the death 
of one of Reed ’s witnesses and the State’s recent disclosures of 
three additional witnesses, among other reasons.  
Further, Reed evinced a lack of confidence in his 
appointed counsel through statements to the court in support of his request for substitution and by actually retaining counsel,

  This case requires us to consider  whether 
countervailing considerations outweighed Reed’s presumptive ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
who was prepared to enter an appearance if allowed a 
continuance.  Indeed, Reed’s explanation that he sought to 
substitute counsel because he was looking for  “one fair trial ”  
and because the DPD was “misrepresenting ” him, aligns with the 
reasoning behind the constitutional right to private counsel of 
choice, i.e.,  to promote confidence between client and counsel  
and accordingly protect the integrity of the judicial process:  
The right to retain private counsel serves to foster the 
trust between attorney and client that is necessary for the 
attorney to be a truly effective advocate.  Not only are 
decisions crucial to the defendant ’s liberty placed in 
counsel ’s hands, but the defendant ’s perception of the 
fairness of the process, and his [or her] willingness to acquiesce in its results, depend upon his [or her] 
confidence in his [or her] counsel ’s dedication, loyalty, 
and ability.

  Accordingly, the court abused its discretion in  
denying Reed’s motion for withdrawal and substitution  of his 
retained counsel.  Because the denial of  the  right to counsel of 
choice is a structural error, we need not subject the court’s 
abuse of discretion to a harmless error analysis.  Cramer, 12 9  
Hawaiʻi at 303 , 299 P.3d at 763.

right to privately retained counsel of choice. Here, the record 
reflects that the only supported justification for denying 
Reed’s motion for substitution of counsel was the efficient 
administration of justice. However, as noted above, the record does not indicate that a delay would have been unduly 
problematic for the circuit court. In turn, several factors 
weighed in favor of granting Reed’ s request, including the lack 
of apparent pr ejudice to the State and Reed’s motivation for 
obtaining new counsel.  Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the need for judicial efficiency justified denying 
Reed his right to retained counsel of choice. As stated by the 
United States Supreme Court, “a myopic insistence upon 
expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay 
can render the right to defend with counsel an empty formality .”

  For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the ICA’s June 9, 
2014 judgment on appeal and the circuit court ’s January 11, 2013  
judgment of conviction and sentence, and remand to the circuit 
court for a new trial.
