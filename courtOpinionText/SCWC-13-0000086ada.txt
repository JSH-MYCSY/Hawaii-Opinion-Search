OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J.  
Petitioner/Defendant
-Appellant June-June Mas Abdon 
appeals from the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) judgment 
on appeal entered pursuant to its memorandum opinion.  The ICA’s  
 
 
judgment vacated the Circuit  Court of the First Circuit’s 
(circuit court) January 16, 2013 judgment of conviction and 
sentence for sexual assault in the first degree  based on the 
circuit court’s failure to instruct on the lesser included offense of sexual assault in the third degree.  
    Abdon does not challenge the ICA’s determination 
regarding the lesser included offense instruction, but asserts 
that the ICA gravely  erred in rejecting his claim that his post-
verdict motion for judgment of acquittal  should have been 
granted by the circuit court.  In the  post-verdict motion, Abdon  
contended that the State failed to adduce evidence at trial of 
the date his prosecution commenced, and accordingly, the State 
did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt “ [f]acts establishing 
that the offense was committed within” the statute of 
limitations as required by Hawaiʻ i  Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§§ 701-114(1)(e) and 701  -108.  Abdon’s claim is unavailing 
because the date the prosecution commenced —i.e., the date of the 
indictment —was subject to judicial notice as requested by the 
State.   Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in denying 
his motion for judgment of acquittal. We additionally hold that 
the circuit court erred in failing to instruct the jury that the 
State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt  facts establishing 
the timeliness of the prosecution.  However, this error was ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____

harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Accordingly, we affirm the 
ICA’s judgment on appeal.

I. Background 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings 
On April 24, 2012, the State of Hawai i filed an 
indictment charging Abdon with sexual assault in the first 
degree
—a class A felony —in violation of HRS § 707-730(1)(b).1 
According to the indictment, “[o]n or about the 1st day of June, 
1997, to and including the 30th day of June, 1997,” Abdon “did 
knowingly subject to sexual penetration, [the complaining 
witness (CW)], who was less than fourteen years old, by 
inserting his penis into her genital opening.” The indictment 
stated that CW was born on April 26, 1988; turned eighteen on 
April 26, 2006; and is still alive, citing to HRS 
§ 701-108(6)(c), which provides that the statute of limitations 
for felony sexual offenses is tolled while the victim is under 
eighteen.2 The foreperson of the grand jury and the deputy 
1 At the time of the offense, HRS § 707 -730(1)(b) ( 1993) provided 
that “[a] person commits the offense of sexual assault in the first degree if 
. . . [t]he person knowingly subjects to sexual   penetration another person 
who is less than fourteen years old[.]”   “Sexual assault in the first degree 
is a class A felony.” HRS § 707 -730(2) (1993 ).       
 
HRS § 701
-108 governs time limitations for prosecutions.  See 
infra note 6.   HRS § 701-108(6)(c) (2014) states, as it did at the time 
relevant here, that “[t]he period of limitation does not run . . . [f]or any 
felony offense under chapter 707, part V or VI [sexual offenses and child 
abuse], during any time when the victim is alive and under eighteen years of 
age.”  The statute was amended in 1995 to add this subsection on the basis 
“that i[t] is likely to take much longer for child victims of crime to report 
(continued. . .)

prosecuting attorney signed the indictment and indicated the 
date the indictment was found: “A True Bill found this day: 
April 24, 2012.” The indictment also was signed by the clerk of 
the circuit court with the filing date of April 24, 2012.    
At trial,3 CW testified that her date of birth was 
April 26, 1988. CW identified Abdon as her uncle, who was 
living with her and her family in Hawai ʻi after moving from the 
Philippines. In June 1997, when CW was nine, CW testified that 
Abdon sexually assaulted her in a bedroom the two shared by 
touching her vagina with his hand and forcing his penis into her 
vagina. CW did not report the incident until 2010, when she was 
attending college. Abdon testified at trial and denied having ever touched CW inappropriately.  
Following the evidence, the court and the parties 
discussed jury instructions. Abdon requested an instruction on 
the lesser included offense of third degree sexual assault.

court rejected Abdon’s request over the objection of both Abdon and the State, concluding that there was no rational basis upon

relevant here, that “ [a] person commits the offense of sexual assault in the

another person who is less than fourteen years old or causes such a person to 
have sexual contact with the person[.]”

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
which a reasonable juror could acquit Abdon of the charged 
offense but convict him of sexual assault in the third degree.  
The jury found Abdon guilty of sexual assault in the 
first degree, as charged. 
At the close of the proceedings, the circuit court 
ordered counsel to return later in the afternoon to discuss “a 
matter having to do with [the] case.” It appears from the 
pleadings that at this post-trial meeting, the court instructed 
the defense to file a motion for judgment of acquittal based on 
the statute of limitations. 
Accordingly, Abdon filed a post-verdict motion for 
judgment of acquittal contending that the State failed to prove 
beyond a reasonable doubt, as required by HRS § 701-114,5 that 
the six-year statute of limitations for class A felonies 
5 HRS § 701- 114 (2014), entitled “ Proof beyond a reasonable doubt ,” 
provides as follows, as it did at the time relevant here : 
(1) Except as otherwise provided in section 701 -115, no 
person may be convicted of an offense unless the following 
are proved beyond a reasonable doubt: 
(a) Each element of the offense; 
(b) The state of mind required to establish each element of the offense; 
(c) Facts establishing jurisdiction; 
(d) Facts establishing venue; and 
(e) Facts establishing that the offense was committed 
within the time period specified in section 701 -108. 
(2) In the absence of the proof required in subsection (1), 
the innocence of the defendant is presumed.

  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
enumerated in HRS § 701-108(2)(b) was tolled. According to the 
indictment, the offense was committed in June 1997. Thus, 
absent tolling, the statute of limitations expired in July 2003, 
long before the commencement of the prosecution on April 24, 
2012. However, tolling is provided for in HRS § 701-108(6)(c) 
where the victim is alive and under eighteen.6 Abdon argued 
before the circuit court that in the instant case, the State 
failed to meet the mandate of HRS §§ 701-114(1)(e), 701 -
108(2)(b), and 701-108(6)(c) to prove beyond a reasonable doubt 
that the prosecution commenced within six years of the date CW 
turned eighteen years old.  Abdon acknowledged that the State 
6 HRS § 701- 108 (2014), entitled “ Time limitations,” provides in 
relevant part as follows, as it did at the time relevant here: 
(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, 
prosecutions for other offenses are subject to the 
following periods of limitation: 
. . . . 
(b) A prosecution for a class A felony must be commenced 
within six years after it is committed [.] 
. . . . 
(5) A prosecution is commenced either when an indictment is 
found or a complaint filed, or when an arrest warrant or 
other process is issued, provided that such warrant or process is executed without unreasonable delay. 
(6) The period of limitation does not run: 
. . . .  
(c) For any felony offense under chapter 707, part V or VI, 
during any time when the victim is alive and under eighteen 
years of age.

adduced evidence “sufficient to establish that CW turned 18 on 
April 26, 2006” and as such, the limitations period expired “on 
or about April 26, 2012 ”—two days after the indictment was found 
and filed.   However, Abdon argued that the State failed to 
produce any evidence of when the prosecution commenced, that is, 
“when the indictment was ‘found.’” Abdon stated that evidence 
“[f]or the commencement of prosecution was critical” because the 
trial began “almost six months after the expiration of the 
limitation[s] period  .”    
    
 
 
   
   
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
The State filed a memorandum in opposition to Abdon’s 
motion for judgment of acquittal, arguing that 
it did not have 
to produce evidence that the indictment was found before April 26, 2012 because it “is a legal fact that did not need to be 
adduced at trial or go before the jury.” The State also argued 
that Abdon waived any statute of limitations defense to the 
third degree sexual assault charge by requesting an instruction 
on the lesser included offense, and accordingly, even if the 
court granted his motion for judgment of acquittal for sexual 
assault in the first degree, it must enter a conviction for third degree sexual assault. In the alternative, the State 
asked the circuit court to take judicial notice of the fact that 
the indictment was filed on April 24, 2012.  The State 
maintained that it had furnished sufficient facts to allow the 
7
  
 
 
   
  
   
 
 
 
  
  
 
     
  
 
 In this case, I do believe that the date of birth of 
the complainant and, of course, the fact that she was continuously alive during the applicable period also  
needed to go to the jury, and it didn’t. But evidence was  
adduced at trial upon which the jury could have made that  
finding if they had been presented with it in the jury  
instructions, which  I think they should have been.  And I  
continue to believe that’s error in this case, plain error,  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
court to take judicial notice of the date of the indictment and 
that when taken together with the trial testimony, judicial 
notice that the date of the indictment was April 24, 2012 “is 
sufficient to prove timeliness.” 
At the hearing on Abdon’s motion , the court expressed 
uncertainty regarding the timeliness issue, but ultimately 
denied the motion. The court agreed with the State that 
evidence of the date of the indictment need not be adduced, 
noting specifically that in a typical case, where no tolling 
exception applies, the date of commencement of prosecution is 
not a jury issue. Because the circuit court ruled that the 
State was not required to provide evidence of the date of the 
indictment, the court did not address the State’s request that 
it take judicial notice of that fact. 
In denying Abdon’s motion, the court also stated that 
its failure to instruct the jury that it must find beyond a 
reasonable doubt CW’s date of birth and that she was continuously alive during the relevant time period resulted in 
“plain error.” However, the court noted that evidence on these 
issues had been adduced at trial: 
8
  
 
 
   
 
  
  On appeal before the ICA, Abdon argued that  1) the 
circuit court erred in denying his post-verdict motion for  
judgment of acquittal, and 2) the circuit court erred in denying  
his request to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense  
of sexual assault in the third degree.  
   
   
  
 
     
   
                         
    
    ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
that they were not so instructed. 
B. ICA Proceedings 
The ICA vacated Abdon’s conviction and sentence based 
on the circuit court’s failure to instruct the jury on sexual 
assault in the third degree. State v. Abdon, No. CAAP-13-
0000086, 2014 WL 4800994, at *7 (App. Sept. 26, 2014) (mem. 
op.), as corrected (Oct. 27, 2014).7 The ICA’s ruling on the 
failure to instruct on the lesser included offense is not raised 
by the parties as an issue before this court. Instead, at issue 
on certiorari is the ICA’s conclusion that the circuit court did 
not err by denying Abdon’s post-verdict motion for judgment of 
acquittal. See id. at *5. 
In this regard, Abdon argued before the ICA that “the 
Indictment did not allege, and the State did not prove” that the date the prosecution commenced was within six years from the 
date CW turned eighteen.  Abdon further noted that “the jury was

instruct the jury on the lesser included offense because a rational juror 
could infer that there was sexual contact prior to the penetration alleged by 
CW. Id. 
9
  
 
 
not instructed that the State had to prove that the prosecution 
commenced within the allowable time limitation period” and thus 
did not have to find that the “prosecution had been timely 
beyond a reasonable doubt[,]” resulting in “a denial of due 
process.”    
    
 
  
 
                         
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
In response, the State argued that Abdon waived the 
statute of limitations defense because, inter alia, he failed to 
raise the defense before or during the trial. 
In the 
alternative, the State contended that relevant precedent 
supported its position that evidence of the date the prosecution 
commenced need not be adduced at trial.  Finally, as it did 
before the circuit court, the State maintained that even if it 
were required to prove the date when the prosecution commenced, 
the court may take judicial notice of the date the indictment 
was found. The State contended that to the extent that the 
circuit court erred in reasoning that the State did not need to 
prove the date when the prosecution commenced as required under HRS § 701-114(1)(e), the circuit court’s error was harmless 
because the ICA should take judicial notice that the date of the 
indictment was April 24, 2012, pursuant to Hawai ʻi Rules of 
Evidence (HRE) Rule 201(c), (d), or (f).
8 
8 HRE Rule 201(c) provides that “[a] court may take judicial 
notice, whether requested or not” whereas HRE Rule 201(d) states that “[a] 
court shall take judicial notice if requested by a party and supplied with 
(continued. . .)

State v. Timoteo,
                         
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
The ICA rejected Abdon’s argument regarding the post— 
verdict motion for judgment of acquittal. In this respect, the 
ICA found it unnecessary to decide whether evidence presented 
was sufficient to establish the timeliness of the prosecution 
because Abdon waived such a challenge by requesting an 
instruction on the lesser included offense of sexual assault in 
the third degree, an offense barred by the statute of 
limitations. Abdon, mem. op., 2014 WL 4800994, at *5. Sexual 
assault in the third degree is a class C felony, and thus, a 
three-year statute of limitations applies.  See 
HRS § 707-732(2) 
(2014); HRS § 701-108(2)(c) (1993).  Accordingly, the statute of limitations for sexual assault in the third degree expired on 
April 26, 2009, three years fo llowing CW’s eighteenth birthday.  
Under this analysis, the ICA concluded that once Abdon sought the benefit of an instruction on the lesser included offense, he 
waived not only the statute of limitations for sexual assault in 
the third degree, but also any claim based on the statute of limitations for the charged offense, i.e., sexual assault in the 
first degree. To support this conclusion, the ICA cited to 
 
in which this  court held that “Timoteo waived 
the statute of limitations for the time-barred lesser included 
(. . . continued) 
the necessary information.” Under HRE Rule 201(f), a court may take judicial 
notice “at any stage of the proceeding.” 
11
  
 
 
    
 
   
   
  
 
  
  
 
 
    
 
   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
offense of simple trespass by requesting that the trial court 
instruct the jury on [the lesser included offense].” Abdon, 
mem. op., 2014 WL 4800994
, at *5 (quoting State v. Timoteo,  87 
Hawai
ʻi 108, 116, 952 P.2d 865, 873 (1997)). The ICA determined 
that “[b]y waiving proof . . . for the lesser in cluded crime 
that was otherwise time-barred, it follows that Abdon similarly 
has waived his statute of limitations challenge as to the 
charged crime that was not, in fact time barred.” Id. The ICA 
further noted that Abdon failed to raise the statute of 
limitations challenge before trial or at trial. Id. Finally, 
the ICA determined that the facts establishing the timeliness of the indictment were not in dispute, and thus the failure to present the issue of timeliness to the jury “by way of 
instructions . . . is harmless error.” 
Id. 
(citing State v. 
Iuli,
 101 Hawaiʻ i 196, 207, 65 P.3d 143, 154 (2003)). The ICA 
did not address the State’s request that it take judicial notice of the date of the indictment.  
The concurring opinion 
presented a different analysis 
of the timeliness issue.  According to the concurrence, the 
State does not need to “present evi dence at trial of the 
incontestible [sic], judicially-known date of when the prosecution was commenced and the limitations period stopped 
running.” 
Id. at *8 (Nakamura, C.J., concurring). The 
12
  
 
 
   
      
 
   
  
 
  
  
  
 
 
   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
concurrence reasoned that HRS § 701-114(1)(e)’s requirement that 
the State prove beyond a reasonable doubt facts establishing 
that the offense was committed within the statutory time period 
prescribed in HRS § 701-108 is satisfied by adducing evidence of 
when the limitations period began to run (the day after the 
offense was committed) and any period during which the statute 
of limitations is tolled. Id. (Nakamura, C.J., concurring). 
“Because the date on which the prosecution was commenced is 
always known and indisputable, proof of when the limitations 
period began to run (and any tolling-period) will necessarily 
serve to establish whether the offense was committed within the 
limitations period.” Id. (Nakamura, C.J., concurring).  The 
concurrence noted that in the instant case, the State presented 
evidence of the date of CW’s eighteenth birthday and the 
indictment “indisputably shows . . . [it] was found and filed 
within the six-year limitations period.” Id. at *9 (Nakamura, 
C.J., concurring). Accordingly, the State’s failure to present 
evidence of when Abdon’s prosecution commenced was not grounds 
for overturning the conviction. Id. (Nakamura, C.J., 
concurring). 
The concurrence additionally concluded that Abdon 
waived his statute of limitations claim by failing to raise an 
objection before trial, citing to Hawai ʻi Rules of Penal 
13
  
 
 
    
   
 
 
 
   
  
  
 
  On certiorari, Abdon reasserts his claim that the 
circuit court erred by denying his post-verdict motion for 
judgment of acquittal because the State failed to prove beyond a 
reasonable doubt that his prosecution was timely.   We disagree.  
  Post-verdict motions for judgment of acquittal  are 
reviewed using the same standard applied by the circuit court,  
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Procedure (HRPP) Rule 12(b), which states that “ defenses and 
objections based on defects in the institution of the 
prosecution” must be raised prior to trial . Id. at *11 
(Nakamura, C.J., concurring) (quoting HRPP Rule 12(b) (2007)). Further, according to the concurrence, the statute of 
limitations argument should be “characterized as a defense” and 
Abdon failed his burden of producing evidence “to support the 
defense” as is required “before the trial court i s required to 
instruct on it.” Id. (Nakamura, C.J., concurring). 
II. Discussion 
A. Post-Verdict Motion for Judgment of Acquittal 
namely, whether, upon the evidence viewed in the light most 
favorable to the prosecution and in full recognition of the province of the trier of fact, the evidence is sufficient 
to support a prima facie case so that a reasonable mind 
might fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case requires 
substantial evidence as to every material element of the 
offense charged.  Substantial evidence as to every material 
element of the offense charged is credible evidence which 
is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a 
person of reasonable caution to support a conclusion. 
Under such a review, we give full play to the right of the fact finder to determine credibility, weigh the evidence, 
and draw justifiable inferences of fact.

v. Jhun, 83 Hawaiʻ i  472, 481, 927 P.2d 1355, 1364 (1996)).   Here, 
Abdon would prevail on the motion for judgment of acquittal  if  
either the record lacked substantial evidence as to the elements 
of sexual assault in the first degree,  HRS § 701-114(1)(a),   or 
it lacked substantial evidence as to  one of the following:

(b) The state of mind required to establish each element of 
the offense; 
(c) Facts establishing jurisdiction; 
(d) Facts establishing venue; and 
(e)
 Facts establishing that the offense was committed

HRS § 701-114(1); see also Timoteo  , 87 Hawai ʻi at 113 , 952 P.2d 
at 870.   
At issue here is Abdon’s claim, pursuant to HRS § 701-
114(1)(e), that the State failed to present 
evidence, and that 
the jury failed to specifically find, that his prosecution 
complied with the time limitations laid out in HRS § 701-108.  
As noted supra, sexual assault in the first degree is a class A felony, and accordingly, at the time relevant here, the 
prosecution had to “be commenced within six years after” 
commission of the crime. HRS § 701-108(2)(b).
9 Pursuant to HRS 
§ 701-108(6)(c), however, for felony sexual and child abuse 
9 HRS § 701- 108(2)(b) (2014) states, as it did at the time relevant 
here, that “[a] prosecution for a class A felony must be commenced within six 
years after it is committed[.]” However, in 2014, the legislature amended 
HRS § 701- 108(1) to provide that “ [a] prosecution for . . . sexual assault in 
the first and second degrees . . . may be commenced at any time.” HRS § 701-
108(1) (2014).  This amendment does not apply to the instant case .

offenses, the limitations period is tolled “during any time when 
the victim is alive and under eighteen years of age. ” HRS 
§ 701-108(5) (2014) provides, as it did at the time relevant 
here, that “[a] prosecut ion is commenced either when an 
indictment is found or a complaint filed, or when an arrest warrant or other process is issued[.]” 
Here, the indictment charging Abdon with sexual 
assault in the first degree averred that CW was less than fourteen years old at the time of the offense. The indictment 
further averred that CW “was born on April 26, 1988, became 
eighteen years of age on April 26, 2006, and is still alive” 
with reference to the applicable tolling statute, HRS § 701 -
108(6)(c). At trial, CW’s testimony supporting these averments 
was undisputed. Specifically CW testified that she was nine 
years old in June 1997 when the alleged sexual assault occurred 
and that her date of birth was April 26, 1988.  Because CW was a 
minor at the time of the crime, the six-year limitations period was tolled during the time CW was alive and under eighteen years 
old. See HRS § 701-108(6)(c).  Thus, the six-year limitations 
period did not commence until the date of CW’s eighteenth 
birthday on April 26, 2006.  The indictment was filed and found 
on April 24, 2012, two days prior to the expiration of the 
16
  
 
 
   
  
  
  
  
 
 
   
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
statute of limitations, on April 26, 2012.  Accordingly, the 
prosecution was timely. 
Abdon does not dispute the timeliness of his 
prosecution, but instead argues that HRS § 701-114(1)(e) 
required the State to present evidence to the jury of the date 
the prosecution commenced. Pursuant to HRS § 701-114(1)(e), the 
State is statutorily required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt 
“[f]acts establishing that the offense was committed within” the 
relevant time period. HRS § 701-114(1)(e).  If the State fails 
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt any of the requirements under 
HRS § 701-114(1), then “the innocence of the defendant i s 
presumed.” HRS § 701 -114(2). For purposes of proving that the 
offense was committed within the relevant limitations period, 
the State had to present facts establishing the date of the 
offense, the CW’s date of birth or her eighteenth birthday, that 
she was alive on her eighteenth birthday, and the date of the 
commencement of the proceedings. 
Hawaiʻi case law has repeatedly 
confirmed the State’s obligation to prove timeliness and has 
determined that timeliness is a factual issue. See State v.  
Stan’s Contracting, Inc. , 111 Hawai
ʻi 17, 33, 137 P.3d 331, 347 
(2006) (stating that the timely commencement of the prosecution “constitutes a baseline substantive component that the 
prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt at trial ”);

Iuli, 101 Hawaiʻ i at 207, 65 P.3d at 154 (stating that HRS § 701 – 
114 “requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each element of 
the offense, the state of mind required to establish each 
element of the offense, and fa
cts establishing jurisdiction, 
venue, and timeliness ”); State v. Correa , 5 Haw. App. 644, 650, 
706 P.2d 1321, 1325 (1985) (“Evidence is merely the means of 
proving a fact. The trier of fact still must find the fact. 
Where timeliness of the prosecution and venue are issues of 
fact, the jury must be so instructed.” ). 
Here, the State presented evidence of the date of the 
offense
—June 1997 —through CW’s testimony . As to the tolling 
period, as noted above, the State adduced substantial evidence regarding CW’s date of birth (and accordingly, her eighteenth 
birthday), as well as evidence that she was alive during the 
applicable period, the latter by virtue of her live trial 
testimony. However, there was no evidence presented regarding 
the date of the commencement of the proceedings, and thus, the 
record lacked substantial evidence that the prosecution was 
commenced within the six-year statute of limitations period. 
Because the circuit court ruled that the State was not 
required to provide evidence of the date of the indictment, the 
court did not address the State’s request that it take judicial 
notice of that fact. The State also requested on appeal that 
18
  
 
 
   
  Hawaiʻi Rules of Evidence Rule 201 governs judicial 
notice of adjudicative facts; it provides that “[a] judicially 
noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in 
that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial 
jurisdiction of the trial court, or (2) capable of accurate and 
ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot 
reasonably be questioned.” “[T]he purpose of the judicial 
notice rule . . . is to eliminate the necessity of taking the time of the court and the jury to make formal proof of a fact 
which cannot be disputed.”

the ICA take judicial notice of the fact that the indictment was 
found, and the prosecution was commenced, on April 24, 2012, two 
days before the expiration of the statute of limitations. The 
ICA affirmed the circuit court’s denial of Abdon’s motion for 
judgment of acquittal, finding, inter alia, that the indictment 
was timely because it was filed on April 24, 2012, and Abdon 
waived any challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence 
regarding the statute of limitations. Abdon, mem. op., 2014 WL

the State’s request to take judicial notice of the date of the 
indictment.

then, dispenses with the need for evidence and enables a court 
to declare the existence of a relevant fact so long as it is a 
fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute. See HRE Rule 
201. 
“The m
ost frequent use of judicial notice of 
ascertainable facts is in noticing the content of court 
records.” State v. Akana , 68 Haw. 164, 165, 706 P.2d 1300, 1302 
(1985). Because an indictment is a court record and thus an 
official document, it qualifies as a “source[] whose accuracy 
cannot be reasonably questioned.” See Addison M. Bowman, Hawai
ʻi 
Rules of Evidence Manual   § 201-5[4] (2014-2015 ed.).  This court 
has noted that “taking judicial notice of the records and files of a case may or may not be proper, depending upon the type of 
record at issue and the purpose for which it is considered.” 
State v. Kotis,  91 Hawaiʻ i 319, 34 3, 984 P.2d 78, 102 (1999).  
Where a trial court seeks to take judicial notice of “its  own 
acts or of the existence of records on file in the same case,” a 
number of other jurisdictions have held that judicial notice 
under this circumstance is proper.  Id.  at 341, 984 P.2d at 100.  
And other jurisdictions have specifically taken judicial notice 
of the filing date of certain documents, as well as the dates 
when certain hearings are held in the case. See, e.g., Deicher 
v. City of Evansville, 545 F.3d 537, 541-42 (7th Cir. 2008)

(holding that the court properly took judicial notice of the 
complaint filing date, which was not admitted into evidence); 
State v. Blow,  602 A.2d 552, 557 (Vt. 1991) (affirming the trial 
court’s decision to take judicial notice of the date of the 
defendant’s arraignment). 
Under HRE Rule 201(d), a court shall 
take judicial 
notice when a party requests that the court take judicial notice 
of a fact and supplies the court with the necessary information. 
In this case, Abdon was found guilty of sexual assault in the 
first degree after a jury trial. He filed a post-verdict motion 
for judgment of acquittal, contending that the State failed to 
adduce evidence and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
prosecution commenced within si x years of the victim’s 
eighteenth birthday, as required by statute. In its opposition memorandum, the State requested that the trial court take 
judicial notice that the filing date of the indictment was April 
24, 2012, which was within six years of the v ictim’s eighteenth 
birthday and therefore before the expiration of the statute of 
limitations on April 26, 2012.
10 The indictment, dated April 24, 
2012, was in the circuit court’s file and in the court’s 
immediate possession as it was attached to Abdon’s post -verdict 
10 The State made this argument in the alternative. The State’s 
primary argument was that it did not need to adduce evidence regarding the 
date of the indictment, or in other words, the date the prosecution 
commenced.

motion and part of the court records of this case. The ready 
availability and accuracy of the indictment, which neither party 
contested, thus could not be questioned, and under these 
circumstances, the circuit court was mandated to take judicial 
notice of the date the indictment was found and filed.  See HRE 
Rule 201(d). 
Because a court is required to take judicial notice if 
requested by a party and supplied with the necessary information 
and because a court may take judicial notice “at any stage of 
the proceeding,” including on appeal, the ICA also should have 
taken judicial notice of the indictment in light of the State’s similar request to the circuit court. See HRE Rule 201(f). The 
indictment was in the record on appeal and was in the ICA’s 
immediate possession.  Further, neither party disputed on appeal 
the validity and accuracy of the date of the indictment, and 
therefore the accuracy of the indictment could not be reasonably 
questioned. Under the circumstances of this case, the ICA erred in failing to take judicial notice of the date the indictment 
was found and filed.  See HRE Rule 201(d), (f).  
In order to correct the circuit court’s and the ICA’s 
error, this court takes judicial notice that the date the 
indictment was found and filed in this case was April 24, 2012.  
Taking judicial notice of this fact establishes that the

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
prosecution was timely commenced two days before the expiration 
of the statute of limitations, on April 24, 2012, when the 
indictment was found. On this basis, we affirm the circuit 
court’s denial of Abdon’s post -verdict motion for judgment of 
acquittal. 
We additionally determine that the ICA erred in its 
conclusion that Abdon waived his timeliness challenge under HRS 
§ 701-114(1)(e).  See Abdon, mem. op., 2014 WL 4800994, at *5.  
Specifically, the ICA concluded that pursuant to Timoteo, Abdon 
waived his statute of limitations challenge to the charged 
offense by requesting a jury instruction on a lesser included 
time-barred offense, i.e., sexual assault in the third degree. 
Id. (citing Timoteo , 87 Hawai
ʻi at 115-16, 952 P.2d at 872-73).  
However, Timoteo’s  waiver holding does not extend to the facts 
of Abdon’s case, and accordingly, the ICA’s conclusion is 
incorrect. 
In 
Timoteo, the petitioner was charged with burglary 
in the first degree. 
87 Hawaiʻ i at 111, 952 P.2d at 868.  While 
the parties and the court were settling jury instructions, 
Timoteo requested an instruction on simple trespass, a lesser 
included offense. Id. The court granted Timoteo’s request and 
the jury proceeded to find Timoteo guilty of the lesser included 
offense. Id.  Timoteo filed a “motion to dismiss” two days 
23
  
 
 
   
    
  
    
  
   
   
  
  
    
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
following the verdict, arguing that the court should enter a 
judgment of acquittal because the one-year statute of 
limitations on simple trespass had expired prior to the date of 
the indictment. Id. The prosecution argued that Timoteo waived 
the statute of limitations challenge by “request[ing] the jury 
instruction for the time
-barred lesser included offense of 
simple trespass.” Id. The circuit court granted Timoteo’s 
motion, dismissing his conviction. Id. 
We construed Timoteo’s motion as a post -verdict motion 
for judgment of acquittal and considered the prosecution’s 
waiver argument. Id. In this regard, we determined that 
statutes of limitations for prosecutions in 
Hawaiʻi are waivable 
and agreed with the State that Timoteo waived his statute of 
limitations challenge under the circumstances of the case.  Id. 
at 114, 952 P.2d at 871. Specifically, we held that by 
“request[ing] the jury instruction on simple trespass, [Timoteo] 
effectively waived the statute of limitations and agreed that 
the jury could convict him of simple trespass, rather than the 
more serious initially charged offense of burglary in the first degree, because he preferred the less serious of the two 
possible conviction s.” 
Id. 
at 116, 952 P.2d at 873. 
In the instant case, the ICA determined that Abdon 
waived his statute of limitations defense for the lesser 
24
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
  Id.   The ICA’s conclusion does not follo w

included offense of sexual assault in the third degree by 
requesting an instruction on the lesser included offense, which 
“would have been time barred,”  Abdon , mem. op., 2014 WL 
4800994, at *5, as explained supra. The ICA’s conclusion in 
this regard is a correct reading of Timoteo. The ICA, however, 
went further to hold that because Abdon waived a statute of limitations defense for the third degree sexual assault charge, 
“it follows that Abdon similarly has waived his statute of 
limitations challenge as to the charged crime that was not, in 
fact time barred.
” 
from Timoteo’s  holding. Indeed, the Timoteo 
court made no 
reference to the effect of its waiver holding on the charged 
offense. Moreover , the reasoning supporting Timoteo’s holding 
does not extend to cases where the statute of limitations challenge is to the charged offense. As we noted in Timoteo, by 
requesting an instruction on a lesser included offense, in effect, a defendant is agreeing that it is possible that he or 
she may be found guilty of 
that offense.  87 Hawaiʻ i at 116, 952 
P.2d at 873.  Other courts have similarly explained that where a defendant seeks the benefit of being convicted of a less serious 
crime, he or she cannot proceed to attack a conviction for that 
same crime on statute of limitation grounds.  
See, e.g., United 
States v. Williams
, 684 F.2d 296, 299 (4th Cir. 1982) (holding 
25
  
 
 
   
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
   
                         
    ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
that where the defendant requested the charge for the lesser 
included offense and “in all probability, benefited from the 
charge[,]” the defendant “cannot now complain of the result”); 
People v. Brocksmith,  604 N.E.2d 1059, 1065 (Ill. App. Ct. 1992) 
(“If a defendant wishes to seek a lesser offense and try for the 
possible compromise verdict, he must be willing to accept the 
consequences of that decision, even if it means conviction of a 
crime for which the statute of limitations has expired. ”), 
aff’d
, 642 N.E.2d 1230 (1994); Weber v. State,  602 So.2d 1316, 
1319 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1992) (holding that following a guilty 
verdict “based on the requested [lesser included offense] 
instruction, defense counsel cannot be allowed to change legal positions in midstream and seek a reversal based on that 
error”).11 Abdon did not request to be charged with sexual 
assault in the first degree, the charge at issue for his statute 
of limitations challenge.  Thus, unlike in Timoteo and the other 
cases mentioned above, Abdon did not seek the benefit of being 
convicted of a lesser crime and then take the inconsistent 
position—after conviction of that lesser crime —that such a 
conviction was invalid. 
We also disagree with the ICA’s conclusion that Abdon 
waived his statute of limitations challenge by failing to raise 
11 These cases were also cited in Timoteo.

it before or at trial.  Abdon, mem. op., 2014 WL 4800994, at *5. 
As noted supra, statutes of limitations for criminal 
prosecutions can be waived in certain situations.  Specifically, 
we have held that a statute of limitations challenge to a lesser 
included offense is waived by requesting an instruction on the 
lesser included offense, as in Timoteo; and that the statute of 
limitations may be waived by pleading no contest to the charge 
at issue, as in Adams v. State , 103 Hawai ʻi 214, 226, 81 P.3d 
394, 406 (2003).  However, unlike in the instant case, both 
Timoteo
 and Adams
 presented situations in which the defendant 
acted affirmatively to imply acquiescence to being convicted of 
a time-barred offense. See Timoteo
, 87 Hawaiʻ i at 116, 952 P.2d 
at 873 (distinguishing State v. Black , 66 Haw. 530, 531, 668 
P.2d 32, 34 (1983), in which we held that a defendant did not 
waive his right to proof of venue by failing to raise the issue 
prior to a motion for judgment of acquittal, because “unlike 
Timoteo, the defendant in Black 
did not affirmatively act in any 
manner indicating that he was waiving the right at issue”).12 We 
have not yet decided whether a statute of limitations challenge can be waived based solely on the timing of the challenge. 
To determine this issue, we are mindful that while 
12 Timoteo also distinguished Black on the basis that proof of 
venue, unlike the statute of limitations, 
involves a constitutional right.  
Id.  
27
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
   
  
 
  
    
   
                         
   
    
 
   
  
 
 
  
   ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
statutes of limitations “may be invoked, and waived, as 
affirmative defenses, that is not the sum total of their nature 
or function.” Stan’s, 111 Hawaiʻ i at 33, 137 P.3d at 347 
(emphasis added). We emphasized in Stan’s that pursuant to “ HRS 
§ 701–114(1)(e), the timeliness of the prosecution in 
satisfaction of HRS § 701 –108 constitutes a baseline substantive 
component that the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable 
doubt at trial” and that “ silence by the defendant on the issue 
of timeliness does not relieve the prosecution of its burden of 
proving that component .” Id. (emphasis added). Here, based on 
our holding in Stan’s , Abdon’s statute of limitations challenge 
was timely, despite first raising it in a post-verdict motion for judgment of acquittal.
13 As Abdon contends, a pretrial 
motion would have been premature,14 and HRPP Rule 29(c) (1977) 
allows for post-verdict motions for judgment of acquittal within 
ten days of the verdict withou t requiring a “similar motion 
. . . [to be] made prior to the submission of the case to the 
13 Notably, in Timoteo, the defendant raised the statute of 
limitations challenge to the lesser -included offense at issue post -verdict, 
but the court made no mention of the timing of the challenge in determining 
that the claim had been waived.  87 Hawaiʻ i at 113- 16, 952 P.2d at 869 -73. 
14 The ICA concurrence determined that pursuant to HRPP Rule 12(b), 
Abdon waived his statute of limitations claim by failing to raise it in a 
pretrial motion. Abdon, mem. op., 2014 WL 4800994 , at *10-11 (Nakamura, 
C.J., concurring).  However, HRPP Rule 12(b), governing pretrial motions, 
applies to defenses and objections “which [are] capable of determination without the trial of the general issue. ” Here, Abdon’s challenge was to the 
State’s failure to prove at trial that the prosecution was timely. 
Accordingly, HRPP Rule 12(b) is inapplicable. 
28
  
 
 
   
    
  
 
 
   
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
     
 
         
15                   
 The jury was instructed regarding the date of the offense and 
CW’s age at the time of the offense. Specifically, the court informed the 
jury that the prosecution must prove that the offense occurred “on  or about 
the 1st  day of June, 1997, to and including the 30th  day of June, 1997” and 
that CW “was less than fourteen years old at that time.”  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
jury.” 
B. Jury Instructions 
Abdon additionally takes issue with the circuit 
court’s failure to instruct the jury regarding the timeliness of 
the prosecution. We agree with Abdon insofar as the circuit 
court erred by failing to instruct the jury that the State must 
prove beyond a reasonable doubt the facts necessary to support 
the statutory tolling period. Specifically, the jury should 
have been instructed that the prosecution had to prove beyond a 
reasonable doubt (1) the date of the offense, (2) CW’s birth 
date or the date of her eighteenth birthday, (3) that CW was 
alive on her eighteenth birthday, and (4) the date the 
indictment was found.15 As discussed supra, this comports with 
HRS § 701-114(1)(e)’s requirement that timeliness of the 
prosecution be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. See Stan’s , 
111 Hawaiʻ i at 33, 137 P.3d at 347 (noting “ the timeliness of the 
prosecution in satisfaction of HRS § 701 –108 constitutes a 
baseline substantive component that the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt at trial ”); Correa, 5 Haw. App. at 
649-50, 706 P.2d at 1325 (citing HRS § 701-114(1)(e) in 
determining that the circuit court should have instructed the 
29
  
 
 
     
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
jury regarding timeliness and venue). 
Where jury instructions are at issue on appeal, “ once 
instructional error is demonstrated, we will vacate, without 
regard to whether timely objection was made, if there is a 
reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the 
defendant’s conviction, i.e., that the erroneous jury 
instruction was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt .” State 
v. Nichols, 111 Hawai ʻi 327, 337, 141 P.3d 974, 984 (2006).  
Here, the circuit court’s failure to instruct the jury regarding the timeliness of the prosecution was harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt, because as previously discussed, we take 
judicial notice of the date of the indictment, and thus there is sufficient evidence in the record that the prosecution was 
timely commenced. In Iuli, 101 Hawai ʻi at 207, 65 P.3d at 154, 
we reached a similar determination based upon the record in that 
case. On appeal, Iuli argued that the “jury instructions were 
insufficient because they did not instruct the jury as to venue, 
jurisdiction, and timeliness of prosecution. ” Id. While 
acknowledging that HRS § 
701-114 requires proof beyond a 
reasonable doubt of “facts establishing jurisdiction, venue, and 
timeliness,” we held that “ where uncontradicted and undisputed 
evidence of timely prosecution, jurisdiction, and proper venue 
is contained in the record, the trial court’ s failure to

____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
instruct the jury is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. ” Id.  
Because the prosecution in Iuli presented evidence of 
timeliness, jurisdiction, and venue at trial, we concluded that 
“the trial court’s failure to instruct the jury on these matters 
was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. ” Id.; see also  Correa, 
5 Haw. App. at 650, 706 P.2d at 1325 (holding failure to instruct on timeliness and venue was harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt where the evidence was “uncontradicted and 
undisputed . . . that the offenses occurred on November 24, 1982 
in Pearl City, Oʻ ahu”). Here, in light of the judicially-noticed 
indictment date, the record, as in Iuli and Correa, contains 
undisputed evidence regarding the timeliness of the prosecution. 
Accordingly, the circuit court’s instructional error was 
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
III. Conclusion

judgment on appeal is affirmed.
