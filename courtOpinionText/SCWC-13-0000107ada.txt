OPINION  OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.  
 
I. Introduction 
This case is a landlord
-tenant dispute between 
Petitioner/Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-Appellant Philip  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Did the ICA commit grave error of fact and is its 
summary decision inconsistent with Hawai i  case and 
statutory law by finding —  in direct contradiction to 
the district court’s determination of bifurcation and 
record of proceedings —  that the district court afforded 
Petitioner the opportunity to present affirmative defenses pursuant to HRS 521 -42 and HRS 521 -64, as they 
concerned repairs made and/or reported, that went unresolved and unpaid?   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Cedillos (“Cedillos”), pro se, and 
Respondent/Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff-Appellee Patricia 
Masumoto (“Masumoto”). Cedillos timely applied for  writ of 
certiorari on August 31, 2015 from a July 2, 2015 Judgment entered by the Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) pursuant to 
its May 27, 2015 Summary Disposition Order (“SDO”). The ICA 
affirmed the District Court of the Second Circuit’s (“district  
court[’s]”) “January 17, 2013 Judgment for Possession and Writ 
of Possession” in favor of Masumoto.  
In his Application 
for Writ of Certiorari 
(“Application”), Cedillos presents three questions: 
A.  Did the ICA commit grave error of law and fact by 
determining that despite the harmless error, the grant 
of summary possession was still correct because Petitioner did not set forth any evidence or establish 
retaliatory eviction in accordance with the provisions 
and restrictions of HRS 521 -74, HRS 521 -21 and HRS 521  -
71?  
B. 
C.  Did the ICA commit grave error of fact by wrongfully 
affirming the denial of a rent trust fund and 
incorrectly asserting that Petitioner’s request for 
establishment of a rental trust fund was improper?  
For the reasons discussed herein, the ICA erred in 
affirming the district court’s Judgment for Possession and Writ 
of Possession based on an October 6, 2012 45-day notice to 
2

  
 
 
 
           
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
vacate. Furthermore, there were no grounds to remove Cedillos 
based on a failure to pay rent for November 2012. 
II. Background 
A. Factual Background 
Cedillos and Masumoto entered into an agreement for 
the rental of “271 Makaena Place, back unit” (“property”) on 
November 1, 2011 for a period of six months. The written rental  
agreement and two addenda did not include an attorney’s fee 
provision. Rent was $800 per month with Cedillos performing 
yard service worth $150 per month. The lease ended on May 31, 
2012, and automatically converted to month-to-month terms 
thereafter.  
During the initial lease period, Masumoto e-mailed 
Cedillos on February 19, 2012 stating: (1) a prior tenant had 
issues with the legality of the rental units at 271 Makaena 
Place; (2) to Masumoto’s knowledge, she had “brought all 
building construction a nd risk hazards up to code,” and (3) the 
only “remaining illegality” was the stove in Cedillos’s rental 
unit. She asked Cedillos to remove the stove by the end of 
February. 
After the lease converted to month-to-month terms, on 
August 2, 2012, Masumoto e-mailed Cedillos: “Beginning September 
1, 2012, there will be a rent increase of $25/month.” By letter 
dated August 6, 2012, Cedillos asserted to Masumoto that: 
3
  
 
 
 
   
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Hawaii Revised Statute[s] chapter 521 -74 prohibits you from 
raising the rent or evicting me from my particular unit until you have brought the unit into compliance with 
applicable building and rental housing law. 
On February 12, 2012 you informed me via email 
that the unit you rented to me was not a legal rental unit under Hawaii landlord- tenant law. 
Even if you were able to legally raise the rent 
at my unit, your notice is defective and unenforceable 
under Hawaii Revised Statute 521 -21. . . .  
Additionally, I have submitted, with 
this 
correspondence, an itemized invoice billing you, in part, 
for the mandated firewall installation between the separate 
dwellings at this address. Please refer to the applicable 
provision in Hawaii Revised Statute 521  -64 if you have 
questions about this billed item.  
 
(Emphasis added).  Masumoto replied by e-mail dated August 7, 
2012 stating that the unit’s illegality was due to a stove that 
was left in Cedillos’s unit “to accommodate [him] and [despite] 
knowing it was an illegal stove, [Cedillos] chose to use it 
anyway.” Thus, the e -mail served to give Cedillos “1 month’s 
notice that [Masumoto was] going to change the lease to mention, 
‘No stove included.’” Masumoto then intended to remove the 
stove after the notice period, and thereafter raise  the rent by 
“$25/ per month, or 85 cents per day, prorated.” Masumoto also took issue with Cedillos’s invoice for erecting a firewall in 
another tenant’s unit, as she was unaware Cedillos took such 
action until she received Cedillos’s invoice. Masumoto noted 
that “[Cedillos’s] having done such a thing constitutes reasons 
for an eviction.”  
Masumoto e
-mailed Cedillos on August 28, 2012, stating 
that she would “respond to each [of Cedillos’s invoices] soon,” 
and asking for “September rent, without deducti ons [for 
4
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Cedillos’s invoices], and add the $25.” Cedillos paid $825 to 
Masumoto by checks dated September 1, 2012 and October 1, 2012. 
According to the stamps on the checks, the first check was 
deposited on or around September 12, 2012, and the second check 
was cashed on October 1, 2012.  
By letter dated September 1, 2012, among other things, 
Cedillos (1) identified that Masumoto’s notice of the $25 rent 
increase did not comply with HRS § 521-21 (2006), because it did 
not provide forty-five consecutive days of notice, and (2) 
asserted that after numerous notices to Masumoto of safety 
deficiencies in the rental units, he repaired the firewall in 
his unit and the upstairs unit pursuant to HRS § 521-64(c) 
(2006), and submitted receipts for the repair.     
The first time Masumoto informed Cedillos that she 
wished him to leave the premises was on October 1, 2012. 
She 
gave him 30-days’ notice. Cedillos responded by e -mail dated 
October 1, 2012, stating that the eviction notice violated HRS § 521-71 (2006) and was retaliatory under HRS § 521-74, and that 
he planned to initiate legal proceedings to protect himself.  
Cedillos filed a complaint in district court on October 5, 2012. 
It was served on Masumoto the same day. 
See infra   Part II.B. 
On October 6, 2012, 
Masumoto served a 45-day eviction 
notice on Cedillos, which stated the lease would be terminated 
November 20, 2012. 
5
  
 
 
 
   
 
  
                         
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
On October 30, 2012, Cedillos mailed his November rent 
to Masumoto at her P.O. Box address by way of USPS certified 
mail. According to Masumoto, she did not pick it up because she 
often “pick[s] up [her] mail at night” in Pukalani due to her 
spending a lot of time in Lahaina taking care of her mother. 
Because Masumoto did not pick up and sign for the certified mail 
during business hours, the post office stamped the certified 
envelope as being routed for return to Cedillos on November 19, 
2012. 
Through her attorney, Masumoto sent a “Five -Day Notice 
to Pay Rent or Quit [Premises]” letter dated November 26, 2012 
to Cedillos. The letter stated that if Cedillos challenged the 
45-day lease termination notice, rent for the month of November 
2012 amounting to $950 ($800 plus $150 for non-performed yard 
work) was past due, and that payment in full was required within 
five days or else the lease would be terminated.  If Cedillos 
did not challenge the 45-day lease termination notice, rent was due for the period of November 1 to November 20, 2012 ($633.33) 
plus $31.66 per day starting November 21, 2012.
1 Masumoto 
emphasized: “[P]lease note that it is our position that the 
rental agreement has been terminated based upon the 45 days 
1 The letter stated that the prorated amount would begin October 21, 2012, 
although that date appears to be a typographical error given the letter’s 
content.

   Please contact me immediately if you have any 
questions or desire to be the recipient of the refused 
certified mail that contained the November rent.  
    
 
                         
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
notice. Still, if you dispute this fact, this notice is to 
provide you notice that your rental agreement will be terminated 
due to past due rent if payment is not made in a timely manner.”   
The “Five -Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit [Premises]” 
2 letter was received by Cedillos on November 27, 2012.   By letter 
dated November 27, 2012, Cedillos informed Masumoto’s attorney that he received the letter that morning; that the deliverer 
threatened Cedillos and therefore a police report was filed to 
document the harassment; and that  
I dispute your assertions that rent has not been paid and I 
have enclosed here copies of certified mail sent to 
[Masumoto] that she refused to pick up and collect.  The 
content of the certified mail was the rent for November. I will be also sending December rent in a timely manner using 
the same certified process. 
I also dispute the assertion that yard 
maintenance was not performed during this period. 
. . . . 
On November 27, 2012, Masumoto’s attorney e -mailed 
Cedillos stating: 
We have not [received] rent payment for the month of 
November that you are now alleging was mailed on October 
30, 2012. If the check has been returned to you, please 
forward it to my office within five business days from 
November 26, 2012. If the check has not been returned, please re- issue a new check and place a stop order on the 
prior check as we have not received it, and deliver the new 
check on or before five business days from November 26, 
2012. 
2 Although no specific finding was made by the trial court with respect to the 
date Cedillos received the five- day notice, there is no dispute in the record 
that Masumoto’s attorney sent Cedillos the notice on November 26, 2012, the 
date of the letter, but Cedillos did not receive the notice until November 
27, 2012. 
7
  
 
 
 
  
 
   
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
In addition, to prevent further issues, please 
forward all rent payments to [Masumoto] c/o my 
office . . . . 
Cedillos did not receive the returned certified mail 
envelope containing the November rent until November 29, 2012. 
Cedillos did not re-mail the returned envelope upon receipt.  
Having written out a new check, on November 29, 2012, Cedillos 
again submitted rent to Masumoto at her P.O. Box address by 
certified mail. The mailing receipt from USPS indicated the 
expected delivery date was November 30, 2012. There is no record of the actual delivery date. The check was for $825 and 
the memo line stated “Rent 12/12.” According to a bank stamp on 
the check and Masumoto’s endorsement, it was deposited by Masumoto on December 4, 2012. 
On December 12, 2012, Cedillos responded to the 
November 27 e-mail by letter addressed to Masumoto’s attorney 
stating: 
[I]n my Opposit ion to Defendant’s Motion for Leave to File 
Counterclaim  [filed on December 4, 2012], I informed the 
court that I would be in possession of the unclaimed and 
returned certified mail of November rent for 271 Makaena 
Pl, Makawao 96768 sent to Patricia Masumoto.  Now that the hearing is concluded I am giving you possession of the mail 
as you have previously requested. I will also be 
submitting further rent payments directly to your office.  
 
The certified envelope containing the November rent was included 
with the December 12, 2012 letter.  The attorney received the 
letter and November rent envelope on or around December 12, 
2012. Masumoto’s attorney did not give the certified envelope 
8

  
 
 
 
  
   
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
                         
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
to Masumoto until the date of trial, January 7, 2013. Masumoto 
acknowledged receipt of the letter and certified envelope.  
On December 31, 2012, Cedillos sent his January 2013 
rent payment of $825 to Masumoto by certified mail, which was 
received by Masumoto. 
Cedillos asserted he performed the requisite monthly 
yard maintenance on November 3 and November 24, 2012
, so his 
rent was $800, not $950. Masumoto disputed this assertion. 
B. District Court Proceedings3 
As noted earlier, on October 5, 2012, Cedillos filed a 
complaint in district court alleging claims for retaliatory 
eviction, fraudulent misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, 
failure to disclose, unfair or deceptive acts and practices, bad 
faith, and injunctive relief. The specific violations alleged 
by Cedillos included, among others: 
20. In early May of 2012, [ Masumoto] entered [Cedillos’s] 
rental premises, in violation of HRS 521 -53, and demanded 
that [Cedillos] fix her other neighboring (271A) rental 
unit’s broken washing machine hose. [ Cedillos] complied 
and executed the repair immediately.
 
. . . .
  
25. On August 2, 2012 [
Masumoto] sent to [Cedillos] a 
demand for rental increase in violation of HRS 521 -21 and 
HRS 521- 74. . . .
 
. . ..
 
34. [O]n October 1, 2012, [
Cedillos] was served with an 
eviction notice that was not in conformity with the law.
 
Cedillos requested “damages and civil penalties,” “punitive 
damages,” and “establishment of a rental trust fund, pursuant to 
3 Presided by the Honorable Blaine J. Kobayashi. 
9
  
 
 
 
    
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
HRS 666-21, in which the court shall direct [Masumoto] to 
deposit all disputed rental overpayments and for [Cedillos] to 
deposit future rental payments to be secured by the court until 
all litigation has concluded in this case.” 
At a hearing on October 15, 2012, the district court 
(1) denied Cedillos’s request for a rental trust fund, (2) 
referred the parties to mediation, and (3) continued the matter 
for a status conference on December 10, 2012. Cedillos filed a 
Motion for Reconsideration on October 29, 2012, urging the court 
to establish a rental trust fund and to “order [Masumoto] to 
deposit rental overpayments into the Fund and [Cedillos’s] deposit of future rental payments, until the conclusion of the 
litigation.” Cedillos also asked that Masumoto be “enjoin[ed] . 
. . from further statutory violations and from further 
attempting to illegally dispossess [Cedillos] during the 
duration of [Cedillos’s] litigation against [Masumoto] for 
retaliatory eviction.”     
On October 22, 2012, Masumoto filed a non-hearing 
motion for leave to file a counterclaim for summary possession. Cedillos opposed the motion, and asserted that Masumoto’s m otion 
was premature as he had not yet “overstayed the deadline of any 
legal eviction notice and post-deadline notices,” and that 
Masumoto’s counterclaim can become actionable “only if the court 
does not enjoin [Masumoto] in [Cedillos’s] retaliatory eviction 
10
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
case from further pursuing the illegal dispossession, and the 
time and notice requirements of statutory rules fulfilled.” 
Further, Cedillos contested Masumoto’s assertion that Cedillos 
refused to mediate. Thus, in addition to responding to 
Masumoto’s motion, Cedillos moved for  Rule 11 sanctions against 
Masumoto and her attorney, arguing that there were “outrageous misstatements of fact” in Masumoto’s motion. Cedillos point ed  
to a letter from Mediation Services of Maui dated October 25, 
2012 (which did not indicate when Cedillos contacted the 
mediator’s office), stating that “[Cedillos] has contacted our 
office and would like to invite you in to mediation. . . . 
Please contact our office . . . by Friday, November 9, 2012 for 
more information.” In reply, Masumoto’s attorney dec lared that 
Cedillos previously stated, “mediation will be an exercise of futility,” in an e-mail dated October 1, 2012, which was prior 
to the district court’s October 15, 2012 order requiring 
mediation. The district court denied Masumoto’s motion on November 13, 2012.  
At a hearing on November 26, 2012, the district court 
denied Cedillos’s motion for reconsideration and motion for 
sanctions. The district court also noted that 45 days had   
passed since Masumoto  issued the October 6, 2012 eviction  
notice. On November 27, 2012, Masumoto filed a motion for leave 
to file a summary possession counterclaim, asserting that 
11

  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Cedillos had not yet vacated the property despite the 45-day 
notice terminating the lease, and that Cedillos had not paid any 
rent required under the lease. Cedillos’s written opposition to 
the motion focused on Masumoto’s failure to pick up the November 
rent envelope, stated that he would bring the returned certified 
mail to court on December 10, 2012, and asserted that because 
Masumoto’s rental unit was “illegal,” she could not avail 
herself of legal remedies. In his opposition, Cedillos did not 
specifically challenge the 45-day notice terminating the lease 
based on the fact that it was issued after he notified Masumoto 
of various violations  of the Landlord-Tenant code and filed and 
served his district court complaint against Masumoto for those violations; he did, however, assert: “[T]here is no new evidence 
or cause to grant [Masumoto’s] motion. Circumstances have not 
changed since the denial by this court of the original non-
hearing motion . . . .” The district court granted the motion 
on December 10, 2012, and set a hearing on various pre-trial motions and trial on possession for January 7, 2013. The 
hearing and trial proceeded as scheduled.  
At the hearing preceding the trial, the district court 
heard arguments on three motions filed by Cedillos (Motion for 
Alternative Dispute Resolution, Motion for Pre
-Trial Admission 
of Evidence, and Motion to Compel Discovery) and a Motion to Compel filed by Masumoto. Without providing any specific 
12
  
 
 
 
   
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
rationale on the record, the court denied each of the motions. 
The court also granted Masumoto leave to submit a request for 
attorney’s fees associated with defending against Cedillos’s 
three motions.     
At trial, Masumoto’s attorney called as witnesses 
Masumoto and another tenant of a unit near the property.   
Cedillos, pro se, called Masumoto as a witness.  Cedillos  
questioned Masumoto about the $25 per month rental increase beginning September 2012, and the court accepted Exhibit 4, 
which contained an e-mail communication between Cedillos and 
Masumoto about the rent increase, into evidence. When Cedillos 
attempted to submit evidence with respect to whether Masumoto 
agreed to compensate Cedillos for purchasing and pouring  caustic 
soda into the cesspool, the court and Cedillos had the following colloquy: 
THE COURT:  What’s the relevance? 
	
[CEDILLOS]: As far as rent, rental payments[?]
 
THE COURT: You understand the issue in this case is 
you didn’t pay November rent in a timely fashion. 
[CEDILLOS]:  Yes, I do, your Honor. But I’m still a 
little confused[.] 
THE COURT:  Okay, so. 
[CEDILLOS]:  [B]ecause [Masumoto ’s attorney] indicated 
at the outset that there’s two separate issues here, and we’re only concent rating on whether or not rent was paid 
for the unit and/or if the 45 day notice was, in fact, 
legal.  
 We’re only concentrating on whether rental payments 
were, in fact, made in a timely manner, then I’ll confine 
my questioning to that. But I think that the issues [. . .] the issues are intertwined and you can’t really separate 
them if the Court is going to consider whether or not her 
45 day notice to me was, in fact, legal.  
THE COURT:  All right. I don’t see what the problem 
is or the confusion. It’s either you did or didn’t pay the November rent in a timely fashion; and secondly, whether or 
13
  
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
not notice was given to you. So I don’t know why showing 
me evidence of payments and correspondence concerning rent 
and deductions for January 2012 is relevant to that issue.  
[CEDILLOS]:   Okay.  So the issue that the Court is 
considering is whether or not I, in fact, did pay rent in a 
timely manner, and as counsel and as [Masumoto] has putting forth, that the reason for the counterclaim is because of 
nonpayment of rent.  
THE COURT:  Okay. You sat through her testimony this 
morning; right?  
[CEDILLOS]:  Correct.  
THE COURT:  And the testimony that came out from the 
witness was that you didn’t timely pay November 2012’s 
rent; right?  
[CEDILLOS]:  Okay.  Yes.  
THE COURT:  So that’s the basically the thrust of her 
testimony.  
[CEDILLOS]:  All right.  There were issues brought up, 
your Honor, concerning repairs made. Is the Court 
considering that?  
THE COURT:  Not at this time. That’s not relevant to 
the issue of possession as far as the  Court’s concerned for 
today.  
 
Ultimately, of the nine exhibits identified on Cedillos’s 
exhibit list, only two pages of Exhibit 1 (cancelled rental 
checks for September and October 2012) and Exhibit 4 
(communication regarding the $25 monthly rental increase) were 
admitted. At the end of Cedillos’s case -in-chief the court and 
Cedillos exchanged the following:  
[CEDILLOS]:  No more witnesses, your Honor. 
  
THE COURT:  Okay. Are you going to be testifying?
  
[CEDILLOS]: No, your   Honor. I’d like to rest on my 
declarations and the exhibits I’ve submitted in my answer 
and all previous filings. Unless [Masumoto’s attorney] 
wants to call me as a witness.  
THE COURT:  You had questions you want to ask him?
  
[MASUMOTO’S ATTORNEY]:  No.
  
THE COURT:  Okay. So the Court will take the matter 
under advisement. Give the Court an opportunity to review the exhibits that were submitted to the Court.  
  Court will continue the matter to January 
14 at 10:00 o’clock a.m. for ruling by the Court on the 
issue of possession.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
On January 14, 2013, the district court ruled in favor 
of Masumoto, stating that Masumoto was “entitled to the 
property” and ordering the issuance of a writ of possession and 
judgment for possession. Cedillos requested a stay of the writ, 
which was denied. The writ and judgment for possession issued 
on January 17, 2013, and a status conference was set for 
February 11, 2013. 
Masumoto filed “Defendant’s Declaration in Support of 
Fees” on January 14, 2013. On January 23, 2015, the d istrict 
court issued a Judgment against Cedillos awarding Masumoto 
$1,755.00 in attorney’s fees “based upon the Court denying 
Plaintiff’s Motions for Alternative Dispute Resolution, Motion 
for Pre-Trial Admission of Evidence and Motion to Compel 
Discovery.” Both the January 23 Judgment and  Masumoto’s 
attorney’s  Declaration in Support of Fees  failed to indicate the 
legal basis for fees.             
After granting Cedillos’s non-hearing motion for 
findings of fact and conclusions of law, the district court 
filed its “Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Decision and 
Order” on January 31, 2013. The Findings of Fact state in the 
entirety: 
1.	 [Masumoto] is the owner of property located at 271 
Makaena Street, Makawao, Maui, Hawai i (“the Subject 
Property”).  
2.
	 [Masumoto] was the landlord, and [Cedillos] was the 
tenant, of the Subject Property pursuant to a Rental

Agreement dated November 1, 2011 (Defendant’s Exhibit 
A).  
3.
	 Pursuant to the terms of the Rental Agreement, the 
rental term commenced on December 1, 2011, and ended 
on May 31, 2012, after which the Rental Agreement 
would automatically convert to a month -to-month 
tenancy. Rent was $800.00/month. 
4.	 Within two (2) days of the written notice dated October 5, 2012, [Masumoto] hand delivered [Cedillos] 
a 45-day notice to vacate the Subject Property 
(Defendant’s Exhibit C). 
5.	 Defendant testified that she did not receive rent from Plaintiff for the month of November 2012. 
6.	 By letter dated November 26, 2012, counsel for [Masumoto] informed [Cedillos] that he was in default 
of rent for November, 2012, specifically, the time 
period of November 1-20, 2012 (Defendant’s Exhibit 
D). [Cedillos] was also informed that if he did not 
believe that the rental agreement had been terminated 
via the written notice dated October 5, 2012, he was 
required to pay [Masumoto] the amount of rent in default in five (5) business days otherwise the 
rental agreement would be terminated. 
7.	 In response to [Cedillos’s] claim that he had mailed 
November’s rent to [Masumoto] (which [Masumoto] 
testified that she never received in the mail) on October 30, 2012, counsel for [Masumoto] informed 
[Cedillos] to make payment to counsel for [Masumoto] 
within five (5) business days from November 26, 2012 
(Defendant’s Exhibit E). 
8.	 [Masumoto] testified that to date, she has not 
received rent for the month of November 2012. 
9.	 The Court finds the testimony of [Masumoto] to be 
more credible than [Cedillos]. 
10.	 If any of the foregoing Findings of Fact are Conclusions of Law, they shall be so deemed. 
The Conclusions of Law state in the entirety: 
1.	 Section 521 -71(a) f [sic] the Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(“HRS”) states, in pertinent part: 
When the tenancy is month -to-month, the 
landlord may terminate the rental agreement by notifying the tenant, in writing, at least 
forty-five days in advance of the anticipated 
termination. . . . 
2.	 The term of the Rental Agreement ended on May 31, 2012. Thereafter, the Rental Agreement automatically 
converted to a month -to-month tenancy. 
3.	 [Masumoto] notified [Cedillos] in writing, of the 
termination of the tenancy via notices dated October 5, 2012, and/or November 26, 2012. Despite receiving 
said written notices, [Cedillos] continued to remain 
on the Subject Property.

On January 25, 2013, Cedillos filed a motion for 
continuance of the February 11 status conference, explaining 
that he was “currently on O ahu until February 19, 2013 [and was] 
unable to return before that date due to [his] father’s illness 
who is currently in a care home.” The district court denied the 
motion on February 5, 2013.  By an e-mail dated February 8, 2013 
to Masumoto’s attorney, Cedillos stated: “[I] will not [be] 
deter[red] . . . from the appeal of the possession and the 
continuation of the retaliatory suit. . . . As you know Judge 
Kobayashi denied my request for a continuance and it will be 
impossible for me to be at hearing on Monday. I have not 
received or been able to pick up any mail to my po box since 
1/20/13. I will not return until the 19th.” At the February 11 
status conference, Cedillos did not appe ar. Masumoto’s attorney 
represented that Cedillos notified him that the district court 
had denied Cedillos’s motion to continue the status hearing and 
that Cedillos presently lived on O ahu. Pursuant to the court 
minutes, the court then stated that it “w ill dismiss 
[Cedillos’s] claim with prejudice as to case -in-chief.  Court 
will enter default on [Cedillos] as to the counterclaim.” The *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

Subject Property. 
5.	 If any of the foregoing Conclusions of Law are 
Findings of Fact, they shall be so deemed.

court minutes and court document summary do not indicate that 
default was actually entered by the district court. 
After Cedillos filed a Notice of Appeal with the ICA 
in February 2013, see infra Part II.C., on March 6, 2013, 
Masumoto filed a Non-hearing Motion for Default Judgment.  
Masumoto’s requested attorney’s fees included fees already 
approved and granted by way of the January 23, 2013 Judgment. 
Masumoto’s motion included a “Declaration Regarding Attorney’s 
Fees and Costs” stating that the request for these fees was 
pursuant to “[HRS] § 607 -14 (assumpsit)” and “[HRS] § 666 -14 
(summary possession).” The Notice of Motion stated: “Any response to this Motion must be in writing . . . and filed with 
the Court no later than . . . 12 days [from the date shown on 
the Certificate of Service below] when the Motion is mailed.” 
The Motion was mailed to Cedillos on March 6, 2013. 
On March 12, 2013, the district court granted the  
motion and entered Default Judgment in favor of Masumoto and against Cedillos for $16,439.30, where $2,813.67 was attributed 
to “Total Rent, Holdover & Damages,”  $373.13 to other filing and 
service fees, and $13,352.50 to attorney’s fees. On March 13, 
2013, a First Amended Judgment was filed, and listed the same 
award amount as the March 12, 2013 order. On March 18, 2013, 
Cedillos timely filed his response to Ma sumoto’s Motion for 
Default Judgment. On March 22, 2013, both the March 6 Default 
18
  
 
Judgment and March 13 First Amended Judgment were sua sponte  set 
aside by the court as Cedillos’s March 18 response was timely. 
No specific reference was made to the Januar
y 23, 2013 Judgment.   
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
                         
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
The record on appeal does not reflect further ruling 
on the issue of default or default judgment of claims raised in 
Cedillos’s case-in-
chief.4 Notably, the district court did 
subsequently issue orders denying Cedillos’s Motion for Stay of 
Proceedings Pending Appeal and his Motion for Stay of Execution of Judgement Awards and Attorney Fees Pending Appeal. 
C.  Appeal to the ICA 
Cedillos filed a Notice of Appeal on February 22,  
2013. Cedillos stated he wished to appeal from:  
the Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession filed on 
January 17, 2013; Judgment filed on January 23, 2013; 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Decision and Order 
filed January 31, 2013; Order Denying Plaintiff’s Stay of 
Writ of Possession received  by the court January 14 and 
filed January 31, 2013; Order Denying Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Discovery filed January 23, 2013; Order Granting 
Defendant’s Motion For Leave to File Counterclaim filed 
unknown; Order Denying Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration filed December 7, 2013 and Order Denying 
Motion for Continuance filed January 25, 2013.  
In his opening brief, Cedillos asserted five points of 
error by the district court: 
1. 	[The court e]rred in granting leave to [Masumoto] to 
bring a summary possession counter claim. 
2.	 [The court e]rred and abused its discretion in 
allowing the counterclaim for summary possession to 
4 There has been recent activity in the district court, however, that is not 
included in the record on appeal. As reflected in the Ho ohiki database for 
Case No. 2RC12-1- 002171, Masumoto filed a “Motion for Entry of Default 
Judgment Against Plaintiff” on September 8, 2015. A hearing on the motion 
occurred on October 19, 2015. A status hearing is set for December 21, 2015.

(citations omitted). Cedillos did not present any specific 
argument with respect to the district court’s entry of Judgment 
dated January 23, 2013 for attorney’s fees related to certain pre-trial motions.    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
be heard before [Cedillos’s] original underlying 
claim of retaliatory eviction was adjudicated and in 
bifurcating and refusing to consider [Cedillos’s] 
affirmative defenses to the possession counterclaim. 
The original complaint and defenses directly affected 
[Cedillos ’s] right of possession and would have 
precluded [Masumoto] from recovering possession. 
3.	 [The court e]rred in not establishing a rental trust fund pursuant to HRS 521- 78. 
4.	 [The court e]rred in granting summary possession and finding and concluding that [Cedillos] did not pay rent for November 2012. 
5.	 [The court e]rred in denying a stay of the writ of possession. 
The ICA found each of Cedillos’s five contentions to 
be without merit.  
As to the first point of error, the ICA stated that 
Cedillos “failed to provide any argument as to how the 
[d]istrict [c]ourt abused its discretion in allowing [Masumoto] 
to file a counterclaim or state how he was prejudiced when the [d]istrict [c]ourt allowed the counterclaim to be filed.” 
Cedillos v. Masumoto, No. CAAP-13-0000107, at 2 (App. May 27, 
2015) (SDO).    
With respect to the second issue, the ICA noted that 
“[c]ontrary to Cedillos’s contention, the [d]istrict [c]ourt did 
not prevent him from presenting evidence of retaliatory eviction as a defense to [Masumoto]’s claim for possession.” 
Id.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Further, citing to KNG Corp. v. Kim, 107 Hawai i 73, 79 n.10, 110 
P.3d 397, 403 n.10 (2005), the ICA concluded the district court 
“did not abuse its discretion by adjudicating Masumoto’s summary possession claim prior to considering Cedillos’s complaint.” 
Cedillos,
 SDO at 3. 
The ICA observed that Cedillos did not 
present any evidence of retaliatory eviction under HRS § 521-74, and that any repairs made by Cedillos “were [already] resolved 
to Cedillos’s satisfaction.” 
Id. at 4. 
The ICA found the third issue to be without merit 
because Cedillos’s request for a rent trust fund that also 
required Masumoto to deposit money into it was not required 
under the law. Id. (citing HRS § 521-
78(a) (2006)). 
As to the fourth issue, the ICA concluded that any 
error by the district court with respect to finding that Cedillos did not pay November 2012 rent was harmless because 
Cedillos did not properly leave the premises in accord with the 
forty-five-day notice to vacate.  
Id. at 5. 
Lastly, with respect to whether the district court 
erred by denying Cedillos’s motion to sta y the writ of 
possession, the ICA noted the record was bare of transcripts of 
the hearing at which the court orally denied Cedillos’s request, 
and therefore there was no support for Cedillos’s assertion that 
the district court refused to hear arguments wit
h respect to the 
motion to stay. Id. The ICA also noted that Cedillos was not

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
entitled to a stay because he did not comply with the 
requirements of HRS § 666-14 (1993), which requires that 
Cedillos actually pay Masumoto for past due rent, including 
interest, and costs and expenses related to the summary 
possession proceedings prior to the issuance of the writ in 
order to obtain a stay. Id. at 6. 
Based on the foregoing, the ICA affirmed “the 
[d]istrict [c]ourt’s Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession, both filed on January 17, 2013.” Id. The ICA did 
not address the Judgment dated January 23, 2013. The three questions raised by Cedillos in his Application relate 
to issues 4, 2, and 3, respectively, as addressed by the ICA.

IV. Discussion 
As a preliminary matter, the following facts were 
undisputed at trial: 
1.	 As of June 1, 2012, Cedillos was on a month-to-month 
tenancy of the property. 
2.	 On August 2, 2012, Masumoto notified Cedillos that 
monthly rent for the property would increase by $25 as of 
September 1, 2012. 
3.	 On August 6, 2012, Cedillos contested the rent 
increase with Masumoto as forty-five-days’ notice was not 
provided as required by HRS § 521-21.  Cedillos also 
tendered an invoice to Masumoto for work performed on the 
property. 
4.	 As of August 28, 2012, Masumoto continued to demand 
that the rent due in September 2012 include the $25 
increase. Masumoto also had not yet responded to 
Cedillos’s request to be reimbursed f or tendered invoices. 
5.	 Cedillos timely tendered rent payments in the amount 
of $825 to Masumoto for September 2012 and October 2012. 
6.	 On October 1, 2012, Masumoto notified Cedillos that 
she wanted him to leave in 30 days. 
7.	 On October 5, 2012, Cedillos filed a complaint in 
district court, alleging among other things that Masumoto violated HRS § 521-53 (2006) (requiring “at least two days 
23

notice of the landlord’s intent to enter”), HRS § 521 -21 
(2006) (requiring “written notice given forty -five 
consecutive days prior to the effective date of [any rent] 
increase” for month -to-month tenancies), and HRS § 521-74 
(prohibiting retaliatory evictions and rent increases). 
8. Also on October 5, 2012, Masumoto was served with 
Cedillos’s complaint. 
9.	 On October 6, 2012, Masumoto issued a forty-five-day 
eviction notice to Cedillos, terminating the lease as of 
November 20, 2012. 
10.	 On October 30, 2012, Cedillos submitted his November 
rent to Masumoto at her P.O. Box via USPS certified mail. 
11.	 As of November 19, 2012, the November rent envelope 
was not picked up by Masumoto. It was then returned by 
USPS to Cedillos, who received it on November 29, 2012. 
12.	 On November 27, 2012, Cedillos received Masumoto’s 
“Five-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit [Premises].” The notice required Cedillos to pay November rent within “five 
. . . business days of receipt of this notice / posting,” 
else the “rental will be terminated.”
5 Five business days 
from November 27, 2012 was December 4, 2012. 
5  The district court made no finding with respect to the date Cedillos 
received the “Five- day Notice to Quit” letter. Rather, the court found: “ By 
letter dated  November 26, 2012, counsel for [Masumoto] informed [Cedillos] 
that he was in default of rent for November, 2012, . . . .” Th e date of

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
13.	 By December 4, 2012, Masumoto had received and cashed 
a check from Cedillos in the amount of $825. 
14.	 On or around December 12, 2012, Masumoto’s attorney 
received the November rent envelope from Cedillos. 
15.	 Masumoto’s attorney handed the November rent envelope 
to Masumoto on January 7, 2013, the date of trial. 
The sequence of events is important because it impacts 
whether various statutory rights and obligations under the 
Residential Landlord-Tenant Code, HRS Chapter 521 (“Landlord -
Tenant Code”), are triggered. The following discussion examines 
the issues raised by Cedillos in the order he presents them in 
his Application: (1) whether the ICA erred in determining that 
the trial court’s determination that Cedillos was required to 
vacate due to his failure to pay November rent was harmless 
error, (2) whether the ICA erred in determining that the trial 
court did not err in the manner in which it handled the trial such that Cedillos was prevented from presenting evidence 
relating to repairs, and (3) whether the ICA erred in affirming 
actual receipt of the notice, as opposed to the date of issuance, is the date 
from which the five- business -day period commences.  See HRS § 521
-68(a) (“A 
landlord . . . may, any time after rent is due, demand payment thereof and 
notify the tenant in writing that unless payment is made within a time 
mentioned in the notice, not less than five business days after receipt 
thereof, the rental agreement will be terminated.” (emphasis added)).

the trial court’s denial of Cedillos’s request to set up a 
rental trust fund. 
A. The Forty-five-day Notice to Vacate 
The record shows that it is undisputed that at a 
minimum, Cedillos was current on his rent payments through 
October 31, 2012. 
The record also shows that on October 5, 
2012, Cedillos filed his complaint alleging  Masumoto violated 
various sections of HRS Chapter 521 —  including issuing an 
eviction notice on October 1, and raising his monthly rent by 
$25, both without adequate notice —  and served Masumoto with the 
complaint the same day. Thus, the filing and service of the complaint occurred prior  to Cedillos being served on October 6, 
2012 with Masumoto’s 45 -day notice to vacate.   
HRS § 521-74(a) states in relevant part
: 
[S]o long as the tenant continues to tender the usual rent 
to the landlord . . . , the landlord [shall not] otherwise 
cause the tenant to quit the dwelling unit involuntarily . 
. . after: 
(1) The tenant has complained in good faith to 
the . 
. . landlord, . . . or any other governmental agency [6]  
  The legislature, in amending HRS 
§ 521-74 to include complaints to “the 
landlord, . . . or any . . . governmental agency,” stated: 
The provisions of section 521 -74 are expanded by 
prohibiting the landlord from evicting or raising the rent 
of a tenant who has complained in good faith to the 
landlord, building department, Office of Consumer 
Protection, or any other governmental agency. Presently, 
the landlord is prohibited from raising the rent or 
evicting a tenant who has complained to the Department of 
Health. This section is expanded because there exists 
other problems not restricted to health which could lead to these actions following a dispute between the landlord and 
tenant. 
(continued . . .)

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
concerned with landlord -tenant disputes of conditions in or 
affecting the tenant’s dwelling unit which constitutes a violation of . . . any provision of this chapter . . . .  
In sum, pursuant to HRS § 521-74, a tenant need not demonstrate 
actual retaliation. Rather, absent certain exceptions, so long 
as the tenant continues to submit rent, once a tenant has 
“complained in good faith” to the landlord or a governmental 
agency, the landlord is expressly  prohibited from (1) 
maintaining an action or proceeding to recover possession of the premises, (2) otherwise causing the tenant to quit involuntarily, (3) raising the tenant’s rent, and (4) decreasing 
the services to which the tenant is entitled. 
See  HRS § 521 -74.    
By concluding that “[d]espite receiving [the] written 
notice[] [to vacate on October 6, 2012], [Cedillos] continued to 
[improperly] remain o
n the Subject Property,” the district court 
determined as a matter of law that the October 6, 2012 notice was valid, and that Cedillos’s failure to comply and vacate the 
Property was grounds for granting Masumoto a writ and judgment for possession as a matter of law. To arrive at this determination, the district court implicitly determined that HRS 
§ 521-74 did not apply to alter the legal efficacy of the 
October 6, 2012 notice.  We examine this issue, beginning with 
whether Cedillos’s complaint was submitted in good faith.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Cedillos’s complaint had alleged various violations of 
the Landlord-Tenant Code. The allegations included that 
Masumoto: (1) raised Cedillos’s rent without giv ing the 
statutorily required 45-day’s notice; (2) Masumoto had failed to 
respond to Cedillos’s request for reimbursement for repairs done 
on the property; and (3) on October 1, 2012, had given him only 
thirty days’ notice of eviction in violation of HRS § 521 -71. 
At trial, Masumoto testified as to the first and third matters, 
acknowledging: (1) that on August 2, 2012, she imposed a $25 
rent increase beginning September 1, 2012;7 and (2) that she had 
“ask[ed] . . . Cedillos to move out in 30 days” on October 1. There was no submission of evidence regarding payment for 
repairs as the court declined to consider that issue. 
Thus, Masumoto acknowledged by her own trial 
testimony, which the district court credited, that she gave 
Cedillos insufficient notice of both the $25 rent increase and 
initial request to vacate. These facts together with Cedillos’s 
continued timely rent payments, leave no room to dispute whether 
Cedillos’s complaint, which was filed in district court and 
served on Masumoto on October 5, 2012 (prior to Cedillos’s 
  Masumoto also testified that Cedillos agreed that despite her giving him 
less than the statutorily mandated amount of notice prior to the rent 
increase, “he would agree to pay a higher rent amount of $25.00 per month” as 
of October 1 so long as she paid his submitted repair invoices .7 However, the 
record is bare as to whether Cedillos and Masumoto had resolved the rent 
increase issue prior to the filing of his complaint because the court 
declined to consider the issue of payment for repairs .

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
receipt of a 45-day notice to vacate), was made in good faith, 
thereby satisfying HRS § 521-74(a)(1).8 Accordingly, when 
Masumoto issued her October 6, 2012 45-day notice to vacate to 
Cedillos, HRS § 521-74(a) rendered the notice ineffective 
because Masumoto was prohibited from “caus[ing] . . . [T]enant 
to quit the dwelling unit involuntarily.”9 
Cedillos has consistently argued before the district 
court, ICA, and this court, that the October 6, 2012 notice to vacate was “illegal.” For example, in Cedillos’s “Response and 
Declaration in Support of Denial of Defendant’s Motion for Leave 
to File Counterclai m” dated October 29, 2012, Cedillos argued, 
“The current, and latest, notice of eviction was dated October 6, 2012. Only if, and when, [Cedillos] has overstayed the 
deadline of any legal eviction notice and post-deadline notices, 
will [Masumoto] have any actionable cause for summary 
possession.” In his opening brief before the ICA, Cedillos 
elaborated on the issue of the timing of a landlord’s notice of 
8 Cedillos’s August 6, 2012 letter to Masumoto wou ld also appear to satisfy 
the requirements of HRS § 521- 74(a)(1), as Masumoto’s testimony also 
corroborates Cedillos’s allegations of improper notice as to the rent 
increase. 
9 Additionally, the exception identified in HRS § 521- 74(b)(7), did not apply 
to Masumoto. See HRS § 521 -74(b)(7) (“Notwithstanding subsection (a), the 
landlord may recover possession of the dwelling unit if . . . [t]he landlord 
is seeking to recover possession on the basis of a notice to terminate a periodic tenancy, which notice was given to the tenant previous to the 
complaint or request of subsection (a).” (emphasis added)).

 [T]he record is clear that [Masumoto] had already violated  
HRS 521- 21 concerning rent increases as detailed in 
Argument #1. Both HRS 521 -74(a)(1) and HRS 521 -71(f) 
restricted [Masumoto’s] right to issue a notice of termination and sue for possession. Consider the result 
should this court . . . agree with the district court . . . 
. The implication would lead to an open house on tenants 
who initiate statutory Code proceedings against a landlord and then continue to timely pay rent to the landlord in a 
most proof positive and secured manner [certified mail] 
only to have the landlord knowingly refuse to collect. 
[The] [l]andlord  then falsely claims non payment of rent 
and sues for possession.

termination with respect to a tenant’s complaint against a 
landlord: 
(Emphasis in original). 
Accordingly, as consistently argued by Cedillos , the 
October 6, 2012 45-
day notice to vacate was invalid because it 
was issued while Cedillos was current with his rent payments, 
and after Cedillos filed a complaint in good faith in district 
court and served it on Masumoto.  No other 45-day notice to 
vacate was issued following Cedillos’s alleged failure to pay November rent. 
Thus, the ICA erred in concluding that even if the 
district court erred in determining that Cedillos failed to pay 
rent for November 2012, that such error was harmless because 
Masumoto was entitled to summary possession pursuant to the 45-
day notice to vacate and Cedillos’s “fail[ure] to establish 
retaliatory eviction.”   Cedillos , SDO at 5.      
First, such error would not have been harmless, as 
there was no basis to grant summary pos
session to Masumoto 
30
  
 
 
 
 Partners v. Delos Santos*** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
pursuant to the October 6, 2012 45-day notice, which was filed 
after the October 5, 2012 good-faith complaint.  Additionally, 
to the extent the ICA faulted Cedillos for failing to “testify 
[]or present other evidence that he made a complaint that 
constituted a violation of a health law, regulation, or any 
provision of HRS Chapter 521,” the ICA’s observation is 
inaccurate for two reasons.  One, the court proceeding was 
itself initiated by Cedillos’s October 5, 2012 complaint that 
alleged violations by Masumoto of HRS Chapter 521, and therefore 
a copy of the complaint was not required to have been submitted 
as evidence for the purpose of determining the validity of the 
October 6, 2012 45-day notice.   And two, Exhibit 4, which was 
admitted into evidence by the district court, included pre-
October 6, 2012 communications between Cedillos and Masumoto, 
indicating that Cedillos complained to Masumoto about her 
violations of the Landlord-Tenant code, including the lack of 
requisite notice prior to  the increase in rent and Cedillos’s 
request for reimbursement for required repairs.  
Second, to clarify, the ICA’s reference to Windward 
, 59 Haw. 104, 117, 577 P.2d 326, 334 
(1978), when concluding that Cedillos  had the “burden of proving 
retaliatory eviction under HRS § 521-74 by a preponderance of 
the evidence,” was misplaced. That case concerned the use of 
the affirmative defense of retaliatory eviction in equity, and 
31

  
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
not pursuant to HRS § 521-74.  See id. at 114, 577 P.2d at 333 
(concerning alleged retaliation by landlord for tenant’s 
exercise of rights outside the Landlord-Tenant code).       
B. The Five-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit Premises Based on 
Cedillos’s Alleged Failure to Pay November 2012 Rent 
The ICA did not directly address Cedillos’s fourth 
point of error: “The district court . . . [e]rred in granting 
summary possession and finding and concluding that [Cedillos] 
did not pay rent for November 2012.” (citation omitted). 
Instead, as previously noted, the ICA concluded any such error 
was harmless as Masumoto “was entitled to possession of the 
premises, regardless of whether [Cedillos] tendered or paid rent 
for November 2012” pursuant to the October 6, 2012 45 -day notice 
to vacate. As discussed supra Part IV.A., the ICA erred in so 
concluding. The record compels a contrary result. 
Cedillos accurately pointed out to the ICA that the 
district court’s finding of fact #8, “[Masumoto] testified that to date, she has not received rent for the month of  November 
2012,” is clearly erroneous. Indeed, Masumoto testified that as of the date of the hearing, she was in receipt of the November 
rent envelope and that her attorney had the November rent 
envelope in his possession since on or about December 12, 2012.   
Further, even if this court were to disregard the fact 
that the November rent envelope sat for nearly three weeks at 
32
  
 
 
 
  
   
  
  
                         
   
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
the post office housing Masumoto’s post office box, uncollected 
by Masumoto, Cedillos properly tendered rent in compliance with 
Masumoto’s five-day notice.  Although the five-day notice 
demanded $950 for November rent, the district court determined 
that “[r]ent was $800.00/month”  and made no findings with 
respect to the effect of lawn maintenance on the rent amount.   
Neither party challenged this finding.  By the fifth-business-
day deadline, December 4, 2012, Masumoto had received a check 
from Cedillos in the amount of $825 and deposited it. 
Accordingly, it appears Cedillos timely satisfied the rent 
demanded in the five-day notice.    
The district court, however, did not make this 
finding. Instead, it emphasized that Masumoto did not receive 
rent for November  2012.10 Thus, presumably the court determined 
as a matter of fact that the check deposited on December 4, 2012 
applied to December rent. With the money going toward December 
rent, it would appear that Cedillos remained in default and subject to eviction because Masumoto did not receive November 
10 We note that Hawai i Rules of Evidence Rule 303 states: 
A presumption established  to . . . facilitate the 
determination of the particular action in which the 
presumption is applied imposes on the party against whom it 
is directed  the burden of producing evidence. . . .  [One 
such presumption is that] [t]he payment of earlier rent or 
installments is presumed from a receipt for later rent or 
installments[.]  
HRE Rule 303(a), (c)(5). 
The presumption does not apply in this case because 
Cedillos informed the court that the rent received by Masumoto in December 
was for the “December rental payment.”  
33
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
rent by the five-day deadline of December 4.  Indeed, this is 
what Masumoto’s attorney appeared to assert during trial when 
examining Masumoto. 
Q. 	. . . You received December’s rent in December from 
[Cedillos]; correct? 
A. 	Yes. 
Q. 	And the first time you received November’s rent was . . . basically today when your attorney handed you. 
A. Right, right, today. 
Yet, even if this were the case, Masumoto would still not be 
entitled to summary possession based on the five-day notice  as a 
matter of law.  
As a preliminary matter, because summary possession 
proceedings cannot be initiated until after the expiration of 
the five-day notice period and termination of the agreement, 
Masumoto did not “bring” any legal proceedings against Cedil los 
until December 10, 2012, when the district court granted her leave to file a claim for summary possession. 
See  HRS § 521-
68(a) (2006) (“A landlord . . . may, any time after rent is due, demand payment thereof and notify the tenant in writing that unless payment is made within a time mentioned in the notice, 
not less than five business days after receipt thereof, the 
rental agreement will be terminated. . . .   If the tenant 
remains in default, the landlord may thereafter  bring a summary 
proceeding for possession of the dwelling unit or any other 
proper proceeding, action, or suit for possession. ”  (Emphasis 
added)). Thus, HRS § 666-5 (1993), did not apply to Masumoto at 
34

  
 
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
the time she accepted Cedillos’s check on December 4, 2015 and 
does not affect how the court construes that payment.  The  
statute provides: 
When any legal proceedings are brought   by a landlord to 
evict a tenant, whether by summary possession proceedings 
or an action in the nature of an action of ejectment or 
otherwise, the acceptance of rent by the landlord during 
the litigation shall not be construed as a recognition of 
the tenancy and shall be without prejudice to the 
landlord’s legal rights at the inception of the 
proceedings.  
 In the event the eviction proceedings of whatever 
nature are successful any rent so paid shall be construed 
as damages for withholding the occupancy 
of the premises 
involved from the landlord. 
HRS § 666-5 (emphasis added)  .  Accordingly, any payments made by 
Cedillos to Masumoto prior to December 10, 2012 can be construed 
as Masumoto’s recognition of some form of tenancy.  
Here, pursuant to the five-day notice, the rental 
agreement would not terminate until after December 4, 2012, 
i.e., December 5, 2012. See  HRS § 521-68(a).  Thus, as of 
December 4, 2012, when Masumoto accepted Cedillos’s check for 
“December rent” and deposited it, the rental agreement was still 
in effect. By accepting Cedillos’s rental payment, Masumoto 
extended his periodic tenancy through at least December 31, 
2015. Therefore, although Masumoto may not have waived her 
right to collect rent for November 2012, she did waive her right 
to evict Cedillos —  based on Cedillos’s alleged failure to pay 
November rent by December 4, 2012 —  during the extended tenancy 
35

  
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
                         
   
 
 
    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
under the existing rental agreement.11 Further, on December 12, 
2012, during the continued tenancy, Masumoto, through her 
attorney, received the November rent envelope, thus resolving 
any issues of late rent and leaving no cause of action for 
Masumoto to pursue under HRS § 521-68.     
Thus, regardless of whether the rent check deposited 
by Masumoto on December 4, 2012 was applied to November rent or 
December rent, Masumoto was not entitled to summary possession 
based on Cedillos’s alleged failure to pay November rent. 
C. Whether the District Court Erred in Its Handling of the 
Trial 
The ICA correctly stated that “‘[t]he court has the 
discretion in a summary possession case to sever the issue of a 
determination of the landlord’s right to summary possession from 
other issues.’” Cedillos , SDO at 2 (quoting KNG Corp., 107 
Hawaii at 79 n.10, 110 P.3d at 403 n.10).   Indeed, that the 
district court first set trial for summary possession was not 
illogical. If Cedillos had failed to pay rent and the rental 
agreement was accordingly terminated, HRS § 521-74 (retaliatory 
11 Notably, as of the date of trial, Masumoto had received a $825 rent payment 
for January 2013. According to an image of the cashed January 2013 check, 
which was submitted as an exhibit attached to a post -trial motion, the check 
was deposited on January 4, 2013, prior to trial. Although HRS 
§ 666-5 applies to the January payment (because it was made after Masumoto 
filed her summary possession counterclaim), it has no practical effect on how the payment is construed. This is because Masumoto h ad no “legal right” to 
evict Cedillos based on either his rental payment history or the 45 -day 
notice to vacate delivered to Cedillos on October 6, 2012. Accordingly, 
Masumoto’s acceptance of the January 2013 rent payment further extended 
Cedillos’s periodic tenancy under the rental agreement. 
36
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
eviction) would not be at issue because the statute applies only 
to those tenants who “continue[] to tender the usual rent”; 
therefore, a determination that Masumoto was entitled to summary 
possession for Cedillos’s failure to pay rent could then follow. 
Similarly, if Cedillos had timely tendered rent, Masumoto would 
not be entitled to summary possession. See supra   Parts IV.A —B.  
Some of the issues raised by Cedillos in his complaint 
directly related to both whether November rent was timely paid, and whether he met the elements of HRS § 521-74 thereby 
prohibiting his eviction. For example, at trial Cedillos 
attempted to submit evidence “concern[ing] repairs made and/or 
reported, that went unresolved and unpaid,” but such attempts 
were limited or denied by the district court.  Cedillos had 
billed Masumoto for  such repairs on August 6, 2012, yet as of 
August 28, 2012, the cost of the repairs had not been credited 
to Cedillos’s rent. This is relevant to: (1) Cedillos’s 
affirmative defense under HRS § 521-74 that Masumoto’s  October 
6, 2012 notice to vacate was issued in retaliation for 
Cedillos’s request for reimbursement for property repairs; and 
(2) the amount of rent for November 2012 required of Cedillos by 
the end of the five-day-pay-or-quit period, if any, if offsets 
for repairs were considered.  Thus, the district court abused 
its discretion when it determined that it would not consider 
evidence of communication regarding “repairs made” as that issue 
37

  
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
                         
   
 12 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
was “not relevant to the issue of possession as far as the 
Court’s concerned for today.” 
In his second point of error before the ICA, Cedillos 
challenged this decision of the district court.12 The ICA’s 
conclusions with respect to this issue, however, which were 
based on the district court’s discretion, were erroneous. The 
district court’s discretion in deciding the order in which it 
addresses claims raised in a landlord-tenant dispute does not 
permit it to preclude Cedillos from presenting evidence that is 
relevant to both Masumoto’s summary possession counterclaim an d 
Cedillos’s own claims filed on October 5, 2012. Indeed, the district court appeared to steer Cedillos into only offering 
evidence regarding actual payment of rent or receipt of the 
forty-five-day notice to vacate.  For example, in response to 
Cedillos expressing confusion as to why he could not present 
evidence regarding “whether or not [the] 45 day notice . . . 
was, in fact, legal,” an apparent affirmative defense unrelated to the testimony presented by Masumoto, the court stated, “I 
2. The district court . . . [e]rred and abused its 
discretion in allowing the counterclaim for summary 
possession to be heard before [Tenant’s] original 
underlying claim of retaliatory eviction was adjudicated 
and in bifurcating and refusing to consider [Tenant’s] 
affirmative defenses to the possession counterclaim. The 
original complaint and defenses directly affected [Tenant’s] right of possession and would have precluded [Landlord] from recovering possession .  
(Emphasis added).  
38  
 
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
don’t see what the problem is or the confusion. It’s either you 
did or didn’t pay the November rent in a timely fashion; and 
secondly, whether or not notice was given to you. ” 
Additionally, the district court did not clearly state whether it would consider the exhibits att ached to certain of Cedillos’s 
pre-trial filings.  
Accordingly, the ICA incorrectly noted that 
“[c]ontrary to [Cedillos’s] contention, the [d]istrict [c]ourt 
did not prevent him from presenting evidence of retaliatory 
eviction as a defense to [Masumoto’s]  claim for possession.”   
Cedillos , SDO at 2.   Indeed, the ICA’s observation — that “while  
there was some evidence introduced that repairs were made to the 
property, the record demonstrates that those issues were 
resolved to [Cedillos’s] satisfaction” —  demonstrates why the 
district court’s refusal to admit Cedillos’s evidence or to 
clarify that some or all of Cedillos’s exhibits and declarations 
submitted pre-trial was error: the ICA’s observation was wholly based on evidence submitted by Masumoto, with no consideration 
of Cedillos’s evidence because none was specifically admitted at 
trial. Cedillos, SDO at 4 (referring to Exhibits F and Q).  
For the foregoing reasons, the ICA erred in 
determining that the district court did not prevent Cedillos 
from fully presenting evidence 
(specifically evidence about 
39
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
repairs) for the court’s consideration on the issue of summary 
possession. 
D.  Whether the ICA Erred In Affirming the District Court’s 
Decision to Deny the Establishment of a Rent Trust Fund 
In his October 5 complaint, Cedillos requested the 
“establishment of a rental trust fund, pursuant to HRS § 666-21, 
in which the court shall direct [Masumoto] to deposit all 
disputed rental overpayments and for [Cedillos] to deposit 
future rental payments to be secured by the court until all litigation has concluded in this case.” (Emphasis added).  The 
district court denied both the initial request and Cedillos’s motion for reconsideration of that denial. The record is bare 
as to the court’s reasons for denying Cedillos’s request. 
Notably, however, the court’s minutes focused on Cedillos’s 
request that Masumoto deposit alleged overpayments into the 
fund: “[Cedillos’s] request for [Masumoto] to deposit monies 
into rental trust fund denied by court.” 
HRS § 666-21 (1993) and HRS § 521-78 (2006) are 
identical and provide: 
(a) At the request of either the tenant or the landlord in 
any court proceeding in which the payment or nonpayment of 
rent is in dispute, the court shall order the tenant to 
deposit any disputed rent as it becomes due into the court 
as provided under subsection (c), and in the case of a proceeding in which a rent increase is in issue, the amount 
of the rent prior to the increase; provided that the tenant 
shall not be required to deposit any rent where the tenant 
can show to the court ’s satisfaction that the rent has 
already been paid to the landlord; provided further that if 
the parties had executed a signed, written instrument 
agreeing that the rent could be withheld or deducted, the 
40
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
court shall not require the tenant to deposit rent into the 
fund. 
No deposit of rent into the fund ordered under this 
section shall affect the tenant ’s rights to assert either 
that payment of rent was made or that any grounds for 
nonpayment of rent exist under this chapter. 
. . .  
(c)  
The court in which the dispute is being heard shall 
accept and hold in trust any rent deposited under this 
section and shall make such payments out of money collected 
as provided herein. The court shall order payment of such 
money collected or portion thereof to the landlord if the court finds that the rent is due and has not been paid to 
the landlord and that the tenant did not have any basis to 
withhold, deduct, or otherwise set off the rent not paid. 
The court shall order payment of such money collected or 
portion thereof to the tenant if the court finds that the 
rent is not due or has been paid, or that the tenant had a 
basis to withhold, deduct, or otherwise set off the rent 
not paid. 
HRS §§ 521-78, 666-21.  
Thus, the ICA did not err in stating: “The plain 
language of HRS § 521-78 allows the [d]istrict [c]ourt to order 
a tenant, not a landlord, to deposit disputed rent into the rent 
trust fund.” Cedillos , SDO at 4.  Accordingly, neither HRS § 
521-78 nor HRS § 666-21 require the district court to “establish[] . . . a rental trust fund, pursuant to HRS 666 -21, 
in which the court shall direct [Masumoto] to deposit all disputed rental overpayments and  for [Cedillos] to deposit 
future rental payments to be secured by the court until all 
litigation has concluded in this case.”  (Emphasis added).   
Although the district court could have exercised its discretion to grant in part Cedillos’s  request, and require that his rent 
payments be deposited with the court, Cedillos’s memorandum in 
41

  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
support for his motion for reconsideration shows that Cedillos’s 
primary concern was over Masumoto’s payments, not his own. 
Given the limitations of the record and the nature of 
Cedillos’s request in the conjunctive, it does not appear that 
the ICA erred in affirming the district court’s denial of the 
establishment of a rent trust fund for the purposes requested by 
Cedillos. 
E. Judgment dated January 23, 2013 Relating to Attorney’s Fees 
Associated with Certain Pre-trial Motions 
The February 22, 2013 Notice of Appeal filed by 
Cedillos identified the “Judgment filed on January 23, 2013” as 
one of the district court judgments or orders from which he was 
appealing to the ICA.  Although the district court had initially 
granted the motion on March 12, 2013, and filed a First Amended 
Judgment on March 13, 2013, it subsequently sua sponte  set aside  
those judgments. In his August 25, 2013 opening brief before 
the ICA, Cedillos noted that it was his understanding that 
Masumoto’s March 6, 2013 Non -hearing Motion for Default Judgment 
sought “to amend the Judgment dated January 23, 2013” in addition to seeking allegedly unpaid rent. He also argued that 
since the district court failed to rule on the motion following 
the filing of his timely opposition, that the motion was deemed 
denied pursuant to HRAP  Rule 4(a)(3).  The ICA did not address  
the January 23, 2013 Judgment in its SDO.  
42

  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Although Cedillos’s  Application does not raise a 
specific issue regarding the January 23, 2013 Judgment, the 
Judgment should nevertheless be vacated. Neither Masumoto’s 
“Declaration in Support of Fees” or the January 23, 2013 
Judgment reflect the legal basis for which the fees were 
granted. Even if it could be assumed the district court granted 
fees to Masumoto for defending against Cedillos’s Motion to 
Compel Discovery pursuant to District Court Rule of Civil 
Procedure 37(a)(4), there is no indication as to what grounds 
justified the award of fees with respect to defending against 
Cedillos’s other motions. Notably, the rental agreement did not 
include an attorney’s fee provision, and therefore fees were 
unavailable under HRS § 521-35 (2006) (permitting rental 
agreements to include an attorney’s fee provision within certain 
parameters). Additionally, the record does not reflect that the 
fees were issued as a sanction against Cedillos, or that the 
district court found Cedillos’s motions to have been frivolous. 
See, e.g. , HRS § 607-14.5 (Supp. 1999).  
In the light of the district court’s lack of 
explanation, it appears from the record that the district court 
granted fees for the pre
-trial motions due to Masumoto having 
“prevailed” on the summary judgment proceeding, as the Ja nuary 
23 Judgment issued after the district court issued the Writ of 
Possession and Judgment for Possession. That Masumoto requested 
43
  
 
 
 
   
                         
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
attorney’s fees (including those already awarded by the January 
23, 2013 Judgment) on March 6, 2013 and indicated that it was 
13 in-part pursuant to HRS § 607-14 (Supp. 1997),  underscores this 
interpretation. Under these circumstances, the January 23 
Judgment should be vacated as a matter of course when the Writ 
of Possession and Judgment for Possession are also vacated.  
V. Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, the ICA’s July 2, 2015 
Judgment on Appeal entered pursuant to its May 27, 2015 SDO is 
vacated. The district court’s “January 17, 2013 Judgment for 
Possession and Writ of Possession” and Judgment dated January 
23, 2013 are vacated. This matter is remanded to the district 
court for (1) for a determination of damages under HRS § 521-
14 74(c) (2006),  owed to Cedillos on account of  his improper 
removal from the property on January 20, 2013, and (2) a re-

HRS § 607- 14. 
Masumoto also checked the box for “[HRS] § 666 -14 (summary possession)” as a 
basis for attorney’s fees. However, that statute concerns the payment of 
attorney’s fees by a party requesting a stay of the execution of a writ of 
possession, which was not at issue in March 2013 given that the writ was 
already executed in January 2013.

otherwise involuntarily dispossessed, in violation of this section, is 
entitled to recover the damages sustained by the tenant and the cost of suit,
