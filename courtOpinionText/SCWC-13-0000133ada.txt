2 foreclosure proceedings affecting the property  prior to the 
entry of a new certificate of title.  However, a fter a new 
certificate of title has been entered, no judgment  recovered on 
the mortgage note for any balance due shall operate to open the 
foreclosure or affect the title to the registered property (with 
some exceptions for fraud).  
  This case concerns whether a certificate of title is 
entered when a deed is accepted  by the O ffice of the Assistant 
Registrar of the Land C ourt and stamped with a new certificate 
of title number.  Because we conclude that assignment  of a new 
certificate of title number is not the statutory equivalent of 
an entry of a certificate of title, we hold that the evidence 
did not establish that a certificate of title had been entered.  
Accordingly, the plaintiff in this case was not barred from  
maintaining an action against the purchaser- defendant for 
recovery of the foreclosed property.  Additionally, because the 
evidence presents an  issue of material fact as to whether the 
foreclosure sale was conducted through reasonable means to 
secure an adequate purchase price, we vacate the grant of 
summary judgment and remand the case for further proceedings. 
I. BACKGROUND 
  Wells Fargo, N.A. (Wells Fargo) foreclosed via a non-
judicial foreclosure sale on its mortgage lien against apartment  
unit 1731 (Property), located in the Ilikai Apartment Building ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
3 in Honolulu, Hawai i.  Wells Fargo paid $318,750.00 for the 
Property, and a mortgagee quitclaim deed was recorded in the 
Office of the Assistant Registrar
 of the Land Court in favor of 
Wells Fargo on March 30, 2009.   
  
Thereafter, another non-judicial foreclosure sale was 
held on August 18, 2010 by the Association of Apartment Owners 
of Ilikai Apartment Building (AOAO) at which Daniel Tsukasa 
Omiya purchased the Property for $15,000.1  According to the 
filings, the AOAO foreclosed on the Property to recover 
maintenance fees the AOAO claimed it was owed.2  The AOAO 
executed a quitclaim deed to Omiya which was accepted in the 
Office of the Assistant Registrar on September 15, 2010 and 
bears a stamp that reads in relevant part as follows: 
STATE OF HAWAII

on Cert(s) 940,974  
                     
 1 The record does not indicate if there were competing bids to 
purchase the Property.  
 2 The quitclaim deed that the AOAO executed to Omiya after the 
foreclosure sale states that the AOAO had exercised foreclosure rights under 
a power of sale based, in part, on Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §  514B-146.  
That section provides in relevant part that “[a]ll sums ass essed by the 
association but unpaid for the share of the common expenses chargeable to any 
unit shall constitute a lien on the unit with priority over all other liens” 
with some enumerated exceptions.  HRS §  514B-146(a) (Supp. 2016).  The 
statute further specifies that “[t]he lien of the association may be 
foreclosed by action or by nonjudicial or power of sale foreclosure 
procedures set forth in chapter 667.”  Id. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
4 Issuance of Cert(s) 996,234 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings 
1. Wells Fargo’s  Complaint  
  On November 3, 2010, Wells Fargo filed a complaint 
against Omiya and the AOAO 
in the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit (circuit court), alleg ing that the sale of the Property 
to Omiya was not conducted in accordance with applicable Hawai i 
law because, inter alia, Omiya did not pay reasonable value for 
the Property.3  The complaint also stated that Omiya 
claims to the be owner of the Property by virtue of that 
certain Quitclaim Deed filed on September 15,  2010 .
 . . in 
the Office of the Assistant Registrar  of the Land Court, 
State of Hawaii which resulted in the issuance of Transfer 
Certificate of Title No. 996,234 registering title in the 
name of Defendant Omiya.  
In addition to other relief, Wells Fargo asked that the 
Assistant Registrar of the Land Court be directed to take such 
action as necessary to restore legal title to Wells Fargo, 
including but not limited to, cancellation of Transfer 
Certificate of Title (TCT )4 No. 996,234.  Omiya answered and 
filed a cross-claim against the AOAO.   
                     
 3 The Honorable Edwin C. Nacino presided.  
 4 HRS Chapter 501 refers to the initial certificate of title issued 
pursuant to the Land Court’s decree of registration as an “original 
certificate of title,” see, e.g., HRS § 501 -75 (2006), and refers to a 
subsequent certificate of title issued to a new owner following the 
conveyance of previously regis tered property as a “new certificate of title.”  
See, e.g., HRS § 501- 108 (2006 & Supp. 2016).  Although the term s do not 
appear in HRS Chapter 501 , the Rules of the Land Court  refer in some 
instances to a new certificate of title as a “transfer certificat e of title” 
or TCT.  See Rules of the Land Court (RLC) Rules 14, 26 (1989).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
5 2. Omiya’s Summary Judgment  Motion  
  
On December 21, 2011, Omiya filed a motion for summary 
judgment asserting that the quitclaim deed to Omiya was recorded 
and the Land Court had issued TCT  No. 996,234.   Thus, according 
to Omiya, Wells Fargo’s arguments to invalidate the AOAO’s 
foreclosure sale were untimely because they were not raised 
before the issuance of the new certificate of title, which was 
final and binding.  (Citing Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores , 107 
Hawaii 95, 103, 110 P.3d 1042, 1050 (2005).)  As a result, Omiya 
argued, no relief could be obtained against him or the Property 
because he was statutorily protected as a subsequent purchaser 
for value.5  (Citing Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS ) § 501-82 
(Supp. 2016).)6 
  
In its opposition to the summary judgment motion, 
Wells Fargo asserted that there was a genuine issue of material 
fact as to whether a new certificate of title had issued.  Wells 
Fargo pointed to the 
declaration of its counsel Anya Perez 
                     
 5 In the alternative, Omiya argued that Wells Fargo should be 
barred from opposing the motion for summary judgment or that the court should 
dismiss Wells Fargo’s complaint based on its failure to comply with its 
discovery obligations.   
 6 HRS § 501 -82(a) provides in relevant part as follows: “Every 
applicant receiving a certificate of title in pursuance of a decree of 
registration, and every subsequent purchaser of registered land who takes a 
certificate of title for value and in good faith, hold the same free from all 
encumbrances except those noted on the certificate” subject only to 
enumerated exceptions that are not relevant here.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
6 (Perez Declaration), wh ich stated that she went to the Office of 
the Assistant Registrar of the Land Court and, after searching 
its computer records, was able to see that the new certificate 
of title was only partially prepared.  The certificate of title  
was not complete and not certified, Perez averred, because the 
legal description was missing.  Perez further declared that a 
staff person at the office initially 
told her that a new TCT No. 
996,234 had been issued, “because it is certified by [the 
quitclaim deed].”  The staff member went on to explain, Perez 
averred, that the 
certificate of title had not been checked and 
signed by an assistant registrar, which was required 
for the 
certificate of title to be certified. 
Wells Fargo also asserted that there was a genuine 
issue of material fact as to whether the sale price was 
adequate.  Wells Fargo again pointed to the Perez Declaration, 
which stated that, based on a 2012 tax assessment found in an 
online search of the City and County
 of Honolulu’
s Real Property 
Assessment and tax billing i nformation website, the assessed 
value of the Property as of October 1, 2011 was $308,300.00.  A 
copy of the search results was attached to the Perez 
Declaration.7 
                     
 7 Wells Fargo additionally submitted that there were genuine issues 
of material fact as to the following: whether Wells Fargo  was paying fees for 
the Property; whether the AOAO gave proper notice of foreclosure; whether 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
7   Omiya countered that the tax assessed value of the 
Property found on the internet was inadmissible hearsay and an 
unqualified expert opinion.  As to whether a new certificate of 
title was issued, 
Omiya maintained that the complaint admitted 
that the filing of the quitclaim deed in the Office of the 
Assistant Registrar resulted in the issuance of TC T No. 996,234 , 
registering title in Omiya’s name.  Additionally, Omiya asserted 
that the lack of a physical hard copy of a certificate of title 
was merely the result of clerical or bureaucratic delay and that 
“treating an issued certificate of title as ineffective ” would 
result in arbitrary and inconsistent Land Court protections, 
which was contrary to the intent of the Land Court statute.8  
  
Omiya submitted a supplemental declaration by Sandra 
Furukawa, a title insurance provider who formerly served as 
Registrar of the Bureau of Conveyances and Assistant Registrar 
                                                                               
(. . . continued) 
 
Omiya was the highest bidder; whether the auction took place in a manner as 
required by law; and whether the sale was commercially reasonable.  
 8 The hearing on the motion was scheduled for January 19, 2012.  At 
the hearing, the court questioned Wells Fargo regarding its position as to 
whether there was a judicial admission in the complaint.  Wells Fargo 
acknowledged the language in the complaint cited by the court and orally 
requested leave to amend the complaint, arguing that the record was clear 
that a new certificate of title had not been issued.  The court stated that 
it was not going to allow Wells Fargo to amend the complaint for the purpose 
of the summary judgment motion because the motion to amend was not before the 
court.  The court continued the hearing to allow additional briefing.  Wells 
Fargo then filed a non -hearing motion for leave to amend its complaint on 
January 23, 2012, so as  to remove the language referring to the issuance of a 
TCT number.  On February 1, 2012, the court denied the motion.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
8 of the Land Court (Furukawa Declaration).   Furukawa  stated that 
the Office of the Assistant Registrar of the Land Court at that 
time was nearly four years behind in physically producing and 
certifying new certificates of title for properties registered 
in the Land Court system.  
  Wells Fargo filed a supplemental memorandum, asserting 
that the rule that the c ertificate of t itle is conclusive is 
predicated on the ability of  an interested person to inspect the 
actual, physical document at will.  Wells Fargo argued that 
Omiya had not presented a certificate of t itle as defined by the 
Rules of the Land Court (RLC) Rule 52 (1989), which provides 
that a “ [c]ertificate means  a certificate of title showing  the 
owner’s name, a description of the land and a summary of 
encumbrances affecting the land, if any .”  Because a certificate 
of title had not been issued, Wells Fargo contended,  it was not 
prevented from challenging the non- judicial foreclosure.   
Following a further hearing on the summary judgment 
motion, the circuit court framed the dispositive issue as 
whether “ the issuance of the TCT number is sufficient” to 
provide Omiya with statutory protection.  The court concluded 
that “there’s no genuine issue of material fact regarding ” 
whether Omiya was protected and thus granted the summary 
judgment motion in favor of Omiya.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
9   The court issued an order granting summary judgment  
and an amended partial final judgment.  Wells Fargo filed a 
timely notice of appeal
 to the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
(ICA). 
B. ICA Proceedings 
  
On appeal,  Wells Fargo contended that the circuit 
court erred in (1) concluding that because a certificate number 
had been issued, this court’s precedent prevented Wells Fargo 
from challenging the AOAO’s foreclosure of the Property and (2) 
granting the summary judgment motion because the sale price of 
the Property shocked the conscience.9   
  In a memorandum opinion, t
he ICA held that the circuit 
court did not err in granting summary judgment because there was 
no genuine issue of material fact as to Omiya’s ownership of the 
Property.10  The ICA cited  RLC Rule 59(d)  (1989), which provides 
that in recording a deed, “the purchaser presents  the deed which 
contains the proper number of the certificate of the land 
affected and also contains or has endorsed upon it a full 
                     
 9 Wells Fargo also contended that the circuit court erred in 
granting the summary judgment motion as Wells Fargo provided evidence that it 
had been current in its payment to the AOAO for the condominium association 
fees at the time of the foreclosure.  This point of error is not raised in 
the application for a writ of certiorari and is therefore not further 
addressed. 
 10 The ICA’s memorandum opinion can be fou nd at Wells Fargo Bank, 
N.A. v. Omiya , No. CAAP -13-0000133, 2017 WL 3140895 (Haw. App. July 24, 
2017). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
10 memorandum of all encumbrances affecting the land, if any. ”  The 
ICA noted that Omiya followed this procedure by presenting the 
quitclaim deed to t he Land Court .  Pursuant to HRS §  501-107 
(Supp. 2016), the ICA stated, the instrument is stamped with the 
date, hour, and minute of reception, and, w ith that, the 
instrument is regarded as registered from the date and time 
noted.   
 
 The ICA then pointed to HRS § 501-118 (2006),  which 
precludes a mortgagor or other person in interest from 
impeaching foreclosure proceedings after the entry of a new 
certificate of title.  The ICA concluded that Omiya was required 
only to show a TCT number stamped on the quitclaim deed record 
at the Land Court and not a physical certificate of title.   
  The ICA acknowledged that Wells Fargo’s argument that 
issuance of a TCT number does not have the same effect as 
issuance of a physical TCT was not unreasonable.  However, the 
ICA determined that, “under the circumstances of the Land 
Court’s current operations” and in view of Wells Fargo
’s 
judicial admission that issuance of the TCT number had the 
effect of registering title in Omiya’s name, any challenge to 
Omiya’s title should have been initiated before the TCT number 
was issued to Omiya.  The ICA accordingly held that Wells 
Fargo’s purchase price argument was untimely because title ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
11 became conclusive and unimpeachable when the TCT number was 
issued.  
  Judge Ginoza dissented, arguing that there was 
conflicting evidence as to whether the transfer had been 
certified by the Land Court process, including (1) the quitclaim 
deed with a notation of the “Issuance of Cert(s) 996,234” ; (2) 
the Perez Declaration attest ing that Perez retrieved the 
certificate of title on a computer screen and that it was onl y 
partially prepared and not complete or certified  because the 
legal description was missing; and (3) the Furukawa Declaration 
averring that the Office of the Assistant Registrar of the Land 
Court was nearly four years behind in physically producing and 
certifying new  certificates of title.   As to any judicial 
admission, the dissent reasoned  that the statement in the 
complaint was not dispositive as  the pertinent question under 
HRS § 501-118 is whether there has been entry of a new 
certificate of title.  Thus, the dissent contended that there 
was a genuine issue of material fact that precluded summary 
judgment on this issue. 
  The dissent further concluded that there was a genuine 
issue of  material fact as to whether the price was grossly 
inadequate.  The dissent explain ed that mortgagees must 
“exercise their right to non- judicial foreclosure under a power 
of sale in a manner that is fair, reasonably diligent, and in ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
12 good faith, and to demonstrate that an adequate price was 
procured for the property. ”  (Quoting Kondaur Capital Corp. v. 
Matsuyoshi , 136 Hawai ʻi 227, 240, 361 P.3d 454, 467 (2015). )  In 
this case, the dissent contended, the quitclaim deed submitted 
by Omiya included an attachment indicating that in 2010 the 
assessed net value of the Property was $281,100.
  Based on this 
evidence, the dissent concluded there was a genuine issue of 
material fact as to the adequacy of the purchase price.11  
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
  This court reviews a  court’s grant or denial of 
summary judgment de novo.  Querubin v. Thronas , 107 Hawai ʻi 48, 
56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005).   
III.  DISCUSSION 
  Wells Fargo present s two questions in its  application 
for a writ of certiorari.  The first question concerns whether 
the ICA gravely erred in affirming summary judgment 
when a new 
certificate of title had not been entered prior to Wells Fargo 
initiating this case.  The second question involves whether the 
ICA gravely erred in affirming summary judgment as to the 
adequacy of the price paid by Omiya for the Property at the 
                     
 11 The ICA majority responded that the 2010 tax assessment was not 
argued by Wells Fargo as a basis for establishing that the foreclosure price 
was inadequate, and that the value of the Property in the separate 2012 tax 
assessment relied upon by Wells Fargo had “no bearing on the value of the 
Property at the time of Omiya’s purchase in 2010.”  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
13 foreclosure sale.  To address these questions, we first consider 
the framework of the Land Court system.   
A. Certificate of Title  
1. The Land Court System 
  Hawai i has two systems for recording title to real 
property, the Bureau of Conveyances and the Land Court.   
GGS (HI), Inc. v. N. Y. Diamond, Inc.  (In re 2003 Ala Wai Blvd. ), 
85 Hawai i 398, 405, 944 P.2d 1341, 1348 (App. 1997), overruled 
on other grounds, Knauer v. Foote , 101 Hawai ‘i 81, 63 P.3d 389 
(2003).  The legislature created the Land Court with the passage 
of the Torrens Land Act (Act) in 1903, which is today codified 
in HRS Chapter 501 as amended .  1903 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 56, § 2 
at 279.  The purpose of the system created by the Act “is to 
conclusively establish title to land through the issuance of a 
certificate of title.”  Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores , 107 Hawai ‘i 
95, 101, 110 P.3d 1042, 1048 (2005).  The holder of a 
certificate of title holds it “ free from all encumbrances except 
those noted on the certificate in the order of priority of 
recordation” and other statutor ily enumerated encumbrances.  HRS 
§ 501-82(a) (Supp. 2016).  Thus, “ a land court certificate of 
title is ‘conclusive and unimpeachable ’ with regard to ‘all 
matters contained therein, ’” which is “[t]he fundamental 
difference between a certificate of title issued by the land ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
14 court and a recordation of title at the bureau of conveyances .”  
In re 2003 Ala Wai Blvd. , 85 Hawai‘i at 405, 944 P.2d at  1348.   
  Initial r egistration of property in Land Court “is not 
a simple matter” and “has often been compared to an action to 
quiet title.”  11 Thompson on Real Property , § 92.10( c) (David 
A. Thomas ed., 3d ed. 2015); 3 Patton and Palomar on Land 
Titles, § 682 (3d ed. 2003).  A party first files an application 
with the registrar.  HRS § 501-22 (2006); see HRS § 501-21 
(2006) (specifying who may file an application); HRS § 501- 23 
(2006) (listing requirements of contents of application).  After 
an application is filed, the court enters an order referring the 
application to an examiner of title who searches records,  
investigates facts,  and files a report, “ concluding with a 
certificate of the examiner’ s opinion upon the title .”  HRS 
§ 501-32 (2006) .  If the opinion of the examiner is adverse to 
the applicant, the applicant may elect to proceed further or 
withdraw the application.  Id.  If, in the examiner’s opinion, 
the applicant has good title or if the applicant elects to 
proceed notwithstanding an adverse opinion, the registrar 
publishes notice of the application by order of the court in a 
newspaper of general circulation; the notice must include the 
names of all persons known to have an adverse interest
 in the 
property and the adjoining owners and occupants, so far as 
known.  HRS § 501-41 (2006).  The notice is also mailed to any ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
15 person named in the notice and is posted in a conspicuous place 
on the property.  HRS § 501-42 (2006).  Those claiming an 
interest in the property may appear and file an answer.  HRS 
§ 501-45 (2006).  If no person answers within the time allowed, 
the court may order a default to be recorded, enter a decree 
confirming the title of the applicant, and order registration of 
the title.  HRS § 
501-46 (2006) . 
  If an answer is filed, the case is set for hearin
g on 
motion of a party, HRS § 501-51 (2006), at which  time a judge of 
the Land Court decides whether the applicant has proper title 
for registration.  HRS § 501-71 (Supp. 2016).  If the court 
finds proper title, the court issues a decree of confirmation 
and registration subject to any encumbrances or interests found.  
HRS § 501-71(a)- (b).  Decrees of registration of absolute title 
bind the property and quiet title to it, and they are thus 
conclusive upon and against all persons.12  HRS § 501-71(d); see 
also HRS § 501- 73 (2006) (“The court may remove clouds on titles 
and may find and decree in whom the title or any interest, legal 
or equitable, in land is vested, whether in the applicant or in 
any other person.”).  The decree must contain certain 
                     
 12 Types of non -absolute title are possessory title and qualified 
title.  HRS § 501-72 (2006).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
16 information, including any known encumbrances.  HRS § 501 -74 
(2006). 
 
 After entry of the court decree, the registrar sends a 
certified copy of the decree to the assistant registrar.  HRS 
§ 501-75 (2006); RLC Rule 55 (1989).  The assistant registrar 
then “transcribes  the decree in a book to be called the 
registration book, in which a leaf or leaves in consecutive 
order shall be devoted exclusively to each title. ”  HRS § 501-
75.  “The entry made by the assistant registrar in this book in 
each case shall be the original certificate of title, and shall 
be signed by the assistant registrar and sealed with the seal of 
the court.”  HRS §  501-75; RLC Rule 55.  The certified copy of 
the decree of registration is  “filed and numbered by the 
assistant registrar with a reference noted on it to the place of 
record of the original certificate of title. ”  HRS § 501-75. 
  “The certificate first registered in pursuance of a 
decree of registration in regard to any parcel of land ” is 
“entitled in the registration book ‘original certificat e of 
title, entered pursuant to decree of the land court, dated at ’ 
(stating time and place of entry of decree and the number of the 
case).”  HRS §  501-83 (2006).  The certificate “ shall take 
effect from the date of the transcription of the decree.”  HRS 
§ 501-83.  Decrees of registration and the entry of certificates 
are agreements running with the land
 and are binding upon the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
17 applicant and his or her successors, and the property “ shall be 
and forever remain registered land, ” HRS § 501-86 (Supp. 2016), 
unless deregistered by the owner of record.  See HRS § 501- 261.5 
(Supp. 2016).   
  Owners of registered land “ may convey, mortgage, 
lease, charge, or otherwise deal with the same as fully as if it 
had not been registered .”  HRS §  501-101 (2006).  An owner of 
registered land who wants to convey it in fee executes a deed of 
conveyance, which the grantor or grantee presents to the 
assistant registrar.13  HRS § 501-108(a) (Supp. 2016) ; see also 
HRS § 501-105 (Supp. 2016) (listing requirements of voluntary 
instruments).  If the instrument contains the requisite 
information, then the assistant registrar shall record the deed, 
mortgage, or other voluntary instrument.14  RLC Rule 58 (1989); 
HRS § 501-108(a).  “The act of registration shall be the 
operative act to convey or affect the land .”  HRS § 501-101. 
  Following tender of 
the deed of conveyance , “in

and time so noted” and are “numbered and indexed, and indorsed with a

transfer on the original certificate, and stamp “canceled” on 
the original certificate.   HRS § 501-108(a); RLC Rule 59 (1989) 
(after recording the instrument of transfer, “[t] he assistant 
registrar shall thereupon, in accordance with the rules and 
instructions of the court, enter a new certificate in the name 
of the grantee”); see also HRS § 501-83 (prescribing that 
“[s]ubsequent certificates relating to the same land shall be in 
like form” as that of the certificate first registered pursua nt 
to a decree of registration).  At the “time of any transfer, ” if 
there are encumbrances or claims adverse to the title of the 
registered owner upon the registration book, “they shall be 
stated in the new certificate or certificates, except as far as 
they may be simultaneously released or discharged .”  HRS §  501-
110 (2006).  The “ new certificate  . . . shall be binding upon 
the registered owner and upon all persons claiming under the 
registered owner, in favor of every purchaser for value and in 
good faith.”15  HRS § 501-106(b) (2006).   
  
Owners of registered land may also mortgage the 
property.  HRS § 501-116 (Supp. 2016).  With some exceptions for 
                     
 15 In “cases of registration procured by fraud the owner may pursue 
all the owner’s remedies against the parties to the fraud, without prejudice 
however to the rights of any innocent holder for value of a certificate of 
title.”  HRS § 501-106(b) (2006). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
19 land deregistered pursuant to HRS Chapter 501, part II, all 
instruments dealing with the mortgage must be registered and 
“take effect upon the title of the mortgaged property only from 
the time of registration. ”  HRS §  501-116; see also HRS § 501-
117 (2006) (prescribing procedure to register a mortgage).  
“Mortgages of registered land may be foreclosed like mortgages 
of unregistered land[,]” and nothing in HRS Chapter 501 “shall 
be construed to prevent the mortgagor or other person in 
interest from directly impeaching by action or otherwise, any 
foreclosure proceedings affecting registered land, prior to the 
entry of a new certificate of title.”  HRS §  501-118 (2006).  
“After a new certificate of title has been entered, no judgment 
recovered on the mortgage note for any balance due thereon shall 
operate to open the foreclosure or affect the title to 
registered land.”  HRS § 501-118.   
  With some exceptions,16 HRS § 501-212 provides a 
statutory remedy to any person who, without negligence on the 
person’s part, sustains loss as a result of the registration of 
any other person as owner of such land through fraud, “or in 
consequence of any error, omission, mistake, or misdescription 
in any certificate of title . . . in the registration book. ”  
                     
 16 The State shall not be liable for a wrongful non -judicial 
foreclosure or for loss caused by a breach of trust by a registered owner 
trustee.  HRS § 501- 216 (2006).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
20 HRS § 501-212  (2006).  The claim may be brought as a contract 
claim “for the recovery of compensation for such loss or damage 
or for such land or estate, or interest therein.”  HRS § 501-
212.17 
  
If the harm arises “wholly through fraud, negligence, 
omission, mistake, or misfeasance of the registrar, assistant 
registrar, or of any of the examiners of title . . . , or of any 
of the assistants or clerks”  in the performance of their 
respective duties, the action shall be brought against the state 
director of finance, as sole defendant.  HRS § 501-213 (2006).  
If the harm arises solely through misfeasance of some person 
other than the officers and assistants, or arises jointly , “then 
the action shall be brought against both the director and such 
other person as joint defendants.”  HRS §  501-213.  If judgment 
is in favor of the plaintiff and if damages cannot be recovered 
from other defendants, then any amount due is to be paid out of 
the general fund.  See
 HRS § 501 -214 (2006) .   
  Thus, in many instances the statutory framework 
essentially renders the S tate as a guarantor of the certificate 
of title issued by the Land Court .  
                     
 17 When the person who has been deprived of land or of any estate, 
or interest therein, from conduct described in HRS § 501-212, has a remedy to 
recover the land or interest, the person shall exhaust this remedy before 
resorting to the statutory contract claim.  HRS §  501-212.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
21 2. Defining “Entry of a Certificate of Title”  
  Omiya presented the quitclaim deed for registration to 
the assistant registrar on September 15, 2010 , according to the 
stamp on the deed, and Wells Fargo filed its complaint on 
November 3, 2010.  Omiya contends that HRS § 501-118 and Aames 
Funding Corp. v. Mores , 107 Hawaii 95, 110 P.3d 1042 (2005), bar 
Wells Fargo from impeaching the foreclosure proceedings because 
Wells Fargo filed its complaint after he presented the quitclaim 
deed for registration.  Wells Fargo argues that the statute and 
Aames do not bar its claims because no certificate of title was 
issued to Omiya.  
  HRS §  501-118 provides in relevant part as follows: 
 In case of foreclosure by exercising the power of 
sale without a previous judgment, the affidavit required by 
chapter 667 shall be recorded with the assistant registrar.  
The purchaser or the purchaser’s assigns at the foreclosure 
sale may thereupon at any time present the deed under the 
power of sale to the assistant registrar for recording and 
obtain a new certificate.  Nothing in this chapter shall be 
construed to prevent the mortgagor or other person in 
interest from directly impeaching  by action or otherwise, 
any foreclosure proceedings affecting registered land, 
prior to the entry of a new certificate of title . 
 
After a new certificate of title has been entered , no 
judgment recovered on the mortgage note  for any balance due 
thereon shall operate to open the foreclosure or affect the 
title to registered land . 
HRS § 501-118 (emphases added).  Under this section, a 
mortgagor’s right to directly impeach a foreclosure proceeding 
is “expressly limited to the period before entry of a new 
certificate of title.”  Aames, 107 Hawai i at 101, 110 P.3d at 
1048.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
22   HRS §  501-118 specifies “entry of a new certificate of 
title” as the determinative point when foreclosure proceedings 
may no longer be impeached.  T o determine what constitutes a new 
certificate of title and entry thereof, we consider principles 
of statutory construction, the legislative history of the 
provision, and the structure of the statut es. 
a. Statutory Construction 
  “The fundamental starting point of statutory 
interpretation is the language of the statute itself, ” and 
“where the statutory language is unambiguous, our duty is to 
give effect to its plain and obvious meaning. ”  State v. 
Alangcas , 134 Hawai‘i 515, 525, 345 P.3d 181, 191 (2015).  To 
effectuate a statute’s plain language, its words “ must ‘be taken 
in their ordinary and familiar signification, and regard is to 
be had to their general and popular use.’”  See State v. Guyton , 
135 Hawai‘ i 372, 378, 351 P.3d 1138, 1144 (2015) (quoting In re 
Taxes of Johnson , 44 Haw. 519, 530, 356 P.2d 1028, 1034 (1960)); 
see also  HRS § 1–14 (2009).  “In conducting a plain meaning 
analysis, ‘this court may resort to legal or other well accepted 
dictionaries as one way to determine the ordinary meaning of 
certain terms not statutorily defined.’”  Guyton, 135 Hawai ‘i at 
378, 351 P.3d at 1144 (quoting State v. Pali , 129 Hawai ʻi 363, 
370, 300 P.3d 1022, 1029 (2013)). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
23   It is also “ a canon of construction that statutes that 
are in pari materia may be construed together .”  State v. 
Kamanaʻo, 118 Hawai‘i 210, 218, 188 P.3d 724, 732 (2008) (quoting 
Black’s Law Dictionary  806 (8th ed. 2004)).  “Thus, ‘[l]aws in 
pari materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall be 
construed with reference to each other.  What is clear in one 
statute may be called upon in aid to explain what is doubtful in 
another.’”  Id. (alteration in original) (quoting Barnett v.  
State, 91 Hawaiʻ i 20, 31, 979 P.2d 1046, 1057 (1999)) ; see also  
HRS § 1-16 (2009).   
  The plain meaning of “ prior to the entry of a new 
certificate of title ” clearly contemplates the transcription of 
information into some common repository, and not merely the 
acceptance or stamping of an existing document.  See Entry , 
Black’s Law Dictionary  (10th ed. 2014) (“An item written in  a 
record; a notation.”  (emphasis added)).  This plain meaning 
reading of HRS § 501-118 is underscored by other statutes 
pertaining to the same subject matter in HRS Chapter 501. 
  Following the Land Court’s decision to grant an 
application to register property in Land Court, the Land Court 
issues a decree.18  HRS 501-71(a)-(b).  A copy of that decree is 
                     
 18 The required contents of a decree include information as to the 
names of the owner and spouse , if married, a description of the land, and a 
description of “the estate of the owner, and also, in such manner as to show 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
24 then sent to the assistant registrar.  HRS § 501-75.  The 
assistant registrar “transcribe [s] the decree ” in the 
registration book “in which a leaf or leaves in consecutive 
order shall be devoted exclusively to each title .”  Id.  
“The 
entry made by the assistant registrar in this book in each case 
shall be the original certificate of title ,” id., and the 
certificate “take[s] effect from the date of the 
transcription[,]” HRS §  501-83.  Thus, the act of transcribing 
the decree into the registration book results in creation of the 
original certificate of title , which is retained in the 
registration book with all other certificates.  The original 
certificate in the registration book is entitled “original 
certificate of title, entered pursuant to decree of the land 
court, dated at,
” followed by the “ time and place of entry of 
decree and the number of the case .”  HRS §  501-83. 
  An o wner desiring to convey in fee registered land, or 
any portion thereof, execute s a deed of conveyance, which is 
then presented to the assistant registrar.  HRS § 501 -108(a).  
If the instrument contains the requisite information, then the 
                                                                               
(. . . continued) 
 
their relative priority, all particular estates, mortgages, easements, liens, 
attachments, and other en cumbrances.”  HRS §  501-74; cf. HRS § 501-82 (Supp. 
2016) (providing that holder of certificate of title holds “free from all 
encumbrances except those noted on the certificate” and statutorily 
enumerated encumbrances).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
25 assistant registrar records it.   RLC Rule 58; HRS § 501-108(a).  
Following recording and in accordance with prescribed procedures 
involving a review and certifying process, the assistant 
registrar “make[s] out in the registration book a new 
certificate of title to the grantee, ” and the original 
certificate of title is stamped “canceled.”19  HRS § 501-
108(a)(1); see RLC Rule 59 (“The assistant registrar shall 
thereupon, in accordance with the rules and instructions of the 
court, enter a new certificate in the name of the grantee. ”).  
The assistant registrar also lists any encumbrances or claims 
adverse to the title of the owner on the new certificate of 
title, unless they can be simultaneously released or discharged.  
HRS § 501-110. 
  Thus, p rovisions of HRS C hapter 501 provide the 
original and new certificates of title as being with in the 
registration book-- the decree is “transc ribe[d] in the 
[registration] book ,” which “shall be the original certificate 
of title,” and new certificates of title are “ma[d]e out in the 
registration book. ”  HRS §§ 501-75, 501-108(a); see HRS § 501-
196 (2006) (disallowing, with some exceptions, erasures, 
alterations, or amendments “ upon the registration book after the 
                     
 19 It is not clear if certificates  that follow the original are also 
stamped “canceled.”  See HRS § 501-108(a)(2).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
26 entry of a certificate of title . . . thereon”).  Original 
certificates of title are therefore created  when they  are 
transcribed in the registration book and do not exist prior to 
this transcription, and similarly, new certificates  of title are 
created when they are made out in  the registration book.  
  
Additionally, HRS §  501-83 provides that certificates 
of title subsequent to the original certificate--i.e., new 
certificates--“shall be in like form” to the original 
certificate.  HRS § 501-83.  RLC Rule 52 (1989) defines 
“certificate” as “ a certificate of title showing the owner ’s 
name, a description of the land and a summary of encumbrances 
affecting the land, if any. ”  Thus, a new certificate  of title 
has information referencing the original registration, the 
owner’s name, a description of the property, and a summary of 
encumbrances.20  None of this information is contained in a TCT 
number. 
  
Further, when statutory provisions in HRS Chapter 501 
refer to a certificate of title , that is precisely what is 
                     
 20 It appears that, as the name implies, a certificate of title must 
also be certified with the signature or initials of the assistant registrar.  
HRS § 501-75 expressly provi des that an original certificate of title “shall 
be signed by the assistant registrar and sealed with the seal of the court,”  
and, as stated, new certificates of title “shall be in like form” to the 
original certificate.  HRS § 501 -83.  Perez, in her declaration, averred that 
the new certificate of title in this case had not yet been signed by an 
assistant registrar and that for the new certificate “to be certified, it 
would have to be signed by an assistant registrar” according to a st aff 
person at the Office of the Assistant Registrar.  See infra note 31 and 
accompanying text. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
27 meant;21 when provisions in HRS Chapter 501 reference t he number 
of the certificate of title, that is also what is meant.22  If 
the legislature intended for the issuance of the  number of the 
certificate of title to be the determinative point for when 
parties could no longer impeach foreclosure proceedings, the 
legislature would have so provided .  Cf. Hyland v. Gonzales , 139 
Hawai‘i 386, 391, 390 P.3d 1273, 1278 (2017) (“If the legislature 
                     
 21 See, e.g. , HRS § 501-83.5 (2006) (“[T]he assistant registrar 
shall accept for filing any deed or other voluntary instruments without 
requiring the presentation of the outstanding duplicate certificate.”); HRS 
§ 501-84 (2006) (“Any conveyance of fee simple interest in registered land 
shall be recorded with the assistant registrar, who shall note the same on 
the certificate . . . [and] cancel all the certificates affecting the whole 
land . . . .”); HRS §  501-88 (2006) (“The original certificate in the 
registration book . . . shall be received as evidence in  all the courts of 
the State and shall be conclusive as to all matters contained therein.”); HRS 
§ 501-108(a)(3) (“The original certificate shall be stamped 
‘canceled’ . . . .”); HRS §  501-144 (2006) (“Every new certificate entered 
under this section shall  contain a memorandum of the nature of the proceeding 
on which it is based . . . .”); HRS § 501-156 (2006) (“[A]ny new certificate 
entered in pursuance of partition proceedings  . . . shall contain a reference 
to the final judgment of partition  . . . .”). 
 22 See, e.g. , HRS § 501-102(a) ( 2006) (“Every conveyance, lien, 
attachment, order, decree, instrument, or entry affecting registered 
land . . . shall . . . contain a reference to the number of the certificate 
of title . . . .”); HRS §  501-108(a) (“[N]o deed , mortgage, lease, or other 
voluntary instrument shall be accepted by the assistant registrar for 
registration unless a reference to the number of the certificate of title of 
the land affected by such instrument is incorporated in the body of the 
instrument . . . .”); HRS §  501-131 (2006) (“The assistant registrar shall 
note upon the original instrument creating or declaring the trust or other 
equitable interest a reference by number of the certificate of title to which 
it relates.”); HRS § 501-136 (2006) (“In addition to any particulars required 
in such papers for recording with records of deeds, it shall also contain a 
reference to the number of the certificate of title of the land to be 
affected . . . .”); HRS §  501-151 (Supp. 2016) (“No writ of entry, ac tion for 
partition, or any action affecting the title to real property  . . . and no 
judgment, nor any appeal or other proceeding to vacate or reverse any 
judgment, shall have any effect upon registered land as against persons other 
than the parties thereto, unless a full memorandum thereof, containing also a 
reference to the number of the certificate of title of the land affected is 
filed or recorded and registered.”).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
28 intended that local boards of registration’s jurisdiction would 
be so limited, then the legislature would have used language to 
indicate that delivery was required.”) .   
Accordingly, the plain language
 of HRS § 501-118, 
statutes in pari materia, and other principles of statutory 
construction underscore that the issuance of a new certificate 
of title number is not the statutory equivalent of an entry of a 
new certificate of title 
under HRS § 501-118.23 
b. Legislative History 
  “The legislative history of a statute remains relevant 
‘even when the language appears clear upon perfunctory review.’”  
State v. Alangcas
, 134 Hawai i 515, 526, 345 P.3d 181, 192 (2015) 
(quoting Richardson v. City & Cty. of Honolulu , 76 Hawai i 46, 
68–69, 868 P.2d 1193, 1215 –16 (1994) (Klein, J., dissenting)); 
                     
 23 We note that, although a certificate of title is created upon 
transcription in the “registration book,” HRS §§ 501 -75, 501- 108(a)(1), the 
statutory scheme indicates “registration” is a distinct act occurring prior 
to the entry of a certificate of title.  In the context of newly registered 
land, registration occurs when the land court ente rs a “decree of 
confirmation and registration.”  HRS § 501- 71(a).  Entry of an original 
certificate of title occurs later, when the assistant registrar transcribes 
the decree into the registration book, HRS § 501 -75, with the certificate 
taking effect upon transcription.  HRS § 501 -83.  Subsequent registrations of 
conveyances and other instruments affecting registered land occur “during 
office hours,” HRS § 501 -101, and are effective from the time the instrument 
is received by the assistant registrar.  HRS § 501- 107.  Thus, registration 
of a subsequent instrument occurs when the instrument is received by the 
assistant registrar, and this delivery acts to transfer the applicable 
interest.  See HRS § 501 -101 (“The act of registration shall be the operative 
act to convey or affect the land . . . .”).  The transfer is not made 
unimpeachable under HRS § 501 -118, however, until a new certificate of title 
is issued.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
29 see State v. Entrekin , 98 Hawai i 221, 227, 47 P.3d 336, 342 
(2002) (using legislative history to confirm interpretation of 
statute).  “Were this not the case, a court may be unab le to 
adequately discern the underlying policy which the legislature 
seeks to promulgate and, thus, would be unable to determine if a 
literal construction would produce an absurd or unjust result, 
inconsistent with the policies of the statute.”  Survivors of  
Medeiros v. Maui Land & Pineapple Co. , 66 Haw. 290, 297, 660 
P.2d 1316, 1321 (1983).   
  According to the Furukawa Declaration,  there was  a 
backlog of nearly four years at the Land Court in certifying new 
certificates of title for properties registered in L and Court.  
Over time, there have been legislative efforts to alleviate the 
backlog.  As early as 1985, there was a backlog at the Land 
Court of which the legislature was aware.  See, e.g., S. C. Rep. 
No. 38, in 1985 Senate Journal, at 921 (“Testimony by the 
Department of Land and Natural Resources and confirmation from 
practitioners in this area indicate that there is currently a 
seven month delay in processing land court documents.”) .  The 
following year, the legislature appropriated funds to 
computerize the Land Court in an effort to reduce the backlog.  
See 1986 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 246, §§ 26-28 at 441-42; S.C. Rep. 
No. 38, in 1985 Senate Journal, at 921.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
30   More recently, the legislature pass ed a pair of acts 
aimed to alleviate the backlog , one in 2009 and the other in 
2012.  The first act’s stated purpose was to “ease the backlog” 
in Land Court by, inter alia, allowing an owner of a fee 
interest in registered land to transfer it to the regular 
system, allowing electronic recording of instruments, and 
transferring fee simple timeshare interests from the Land Court 
to the regular system.  2009 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 120,  § 1 at 
304.  The stated purpose of the second act was also to “ease the  
backlog” by requiring that fee timeshare interests be recorded 
in the regular system rather than Land Court and “streamlining 
the procedure for deregistering” remaining fee timeshare 
interests.  See 2012 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 121, § 1 at 426.  This 
change was a result of the legislature finding that the process 
required to transfer fee timeshare interests to the regular 
system had “exceeded the capacity of the land court, 
particularly in light of the approximately three year backlog of 
land court recordings and registration.”  See
 2012 Haw. Sess. 
Laws Act 121, §  1 at 425- 26; see also  HRS § 501-261 (Supp. 
2016).   
  Other changes made to Land Court procedures have 
included eliminating the issuance of duplicates of certificates ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
31 of title to mortgagees and lessees,24 making issuance of a new 
certificate discretionary upon the appointment of a new trustee 
of registered land,25 eliminating the need for a duplicate 
owner’s certificate of title,26 eliminating the requirement that 
leasehold timeshare interests be registered with the Land 
Court,27 and allowing money judgments recorded in the Bureau of 
Conveyances to encumber registered property.28   
  
The act creating Land Court and enacting the precursor 
to HRS § 501-118 was passed in 1903.  1903 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 
56.  The statute read in relevant part as follows: “[N]othing 
contained in this Act shall be construed to prevent the 
mortgagor or other person in interest from directly impeaching, 
by bill in equity or otherwise, any foreclosure proceedings 
affecting registered land, prior to the entry of a new 
certificate of title.”  1903 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 56, § 63 at 
307.  This provision is virtually identical to the current 
iteration of HRS § 501-118 and has remained unchanged in

32 substance from the inception of the Land Court.  Compare id., 
with HRS § 501- 118.  Indeed, in 1998, the legislature 
specifically “[r]etain[ed] the original statutory language in 
[HRS § 501-118],  which refers to the ability for the mortgagor 
to directly impeach any foreclosure proceeding affecting 
registered land, prior to the entry of a new certificate of 
title.”  Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 75, in 1998 Senate Journal, at 
774; see also Aames Funding Corp. , 107 Hawai ‘i at 102, 110 P.3d 
at 1049 (noting that amendments were made to HRS § 501-118, but 
that the cutoff to impeach foreclosure proceedings was retained 
(quoting Conf. Comm . Rep. No. 75, in 1998 House Journal,  at 
980)).   
  Throughout the many legislative amendments to HRS 
Chapter 501, including those made for the express purpose of 
reducing the backlog, the legislature has 
consistently 
maintained the entry of a new certificate of title as the 
deadline for impeaching foreclosure proceedings.  Omiya contends 
that “the Land Court’s pra ctice is to hold that a new TCT is 
‘entered’ when the new TCT number is stamped on the recorded 
deed.”29  The legislature, however,  has not enacted the multiple 
amendments throughout HRS Chapter 501 necessary to adopt this 
                     
 29 Omiya cites  Gary W.B. Chang, Land Court: Demystifying an Enigma , 
Haw. B. J. 4 (Sept. 2017 ), which states that the Land Court’s practice was 
the result of “a pragmatic decision.”  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
33 practice.  Instead, the legislature has sought to alleviate the 
backlog by increasing resources, streamlining certain 
procedures, and reducing the need to issue certificates and 
duplicate certificates.   
  
Thus, despite various statutory changes made to HRS 
Chapter 501 since its enactment, HRS § 501-118 has remained 
virtually identical, evincing the legislature’s intent to 
maintain the entry of a new certificate as the pivotal juncture 
after which foreclosure proceedings may no longer be impeached.  
This conclusion is underscored by the legislature’s response to 
the Land Court backlog
.  The legislature enacted the amendments 
discussed above for the express purpose of addressing the Land 
Court’s workload
, but at no point did the legislature amend HRS 
§ 501-118 to prohibit foreclosure proceedings from being 
directly impeached prior to the entry of a new certificate.30  
Any change in Land Court practice  that implemented such a bar 
was clearly inconsistent with the legislative history and 
statutory provisions of HRS Chapter 501. 
c. Structural Considerations 
  As stated, the primary purpose of the Torrens Land 
Act, codified in HRS Chapter 501,  “is to conclusively establish 
                     
 30 HRS § 501-118 has not been amended since 1998.  See 1998 Haw. 
Sess. Laws Act 122, §  3 at 477. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
34 title to land through the issuance of a certificate of title .”  
Aames Funding Corp. , 107 Hawai ‘i at 101, 110 P.3d at 1048 
(emphasis added).  Thus, a land court certificate of title  is 
“conclusive and unimpeachable ” with regard to “all matters 
contained therein. ”  In re Bishop Tr.  Co., 35 Haw. 816, 825 
(Haw. Terr. 1941).  The circuit court and ICA decisions , 
however, make a recorded deed stamped with an assigned TCT 
number the equivalent of a new certificate of title.    
  P reparation of a new certificate of title involves a 
verification process as  the document is intended to be a 
conclusive, comprehensive listing of every interest in the 
property.31  See id.  The certifying process is key to the 
issuance of a new certificate of title both to maintain the 
integrity of the Land Court system by ensuring the registration 
                     
 31 In the article cited by Omiya, Judge Chang explains that the 
current Land Court practice is to subject registered conveyances to a 
“secondary review” prior to “the final act of certifying the new TCT as being 
recognized by the assistant registrar.”  Chang, supra note 29, at 13 n.18.  
During this review, “the document and the content of the superseded TCT can 
be studied and examined to determine whether the new transaction meets the 
requirements of land court” and to verify that there are no typographical 
errors in the document.  Id.  
  Judge Chang states that “TCT numbers are assigned on a random, 
chronological order depending upon when a document is recorded,” and a single 
mistyped digit in a seven digit TCT number can result in the document 
applying “to a completely different parcel of property.”  Id. at 18 n.35.  
The article also notes that complex mortgage and lending documents may 
contain drafting errors that preclude issuance of a certificate of title.  
Id. at 10 n.16.  Judge Chang indicates that a registered conveyance may be 
pending secondary review if the corresponding entry in the registration book 
“is not initialed by the assistant registrar, or . . . the list of 
encumbrances/memorials . . . are left totally blank.”  Id. at 13 n.18.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
35 book is completely accurate and to avoid the potential adverse 
consequences that can result
 if the information entered on a 
certificate is incorrect.  Aames Funding Corp. , 107 Hawai ‘i at 
101, 110 P.3d at 1048 (explaining that the purpose of the 
registration “is to conclusively estab lish title to land through 
the issuance of a certificate of title”) .   
  In many circumstances , the State is statutorily liable 
to any non-negligent person who sustains loss or damage, or is 
deprived of land or of any estate or interest therein, “in 
consequence of any error, omission, mistake, or misdescription 
in any certificate of title,” by Land Court personnel in the 
performance of their duties.32  HRS § 501-212.  This liability 
even extends to situations in which the misfeasance is wholly 
the result of some person other than Land Court personnel, or 
arises from joint misfeasance, and the judgment shall be paid by 
the State when amounts due by other defendants are not 
satisfied.  HRS § 501-213.   The State is not liable, however, 
when the aggrieved person is able to recover the property.  HRS 
§ 501-212. 
                     
 32 Although “[t]he State shall not be liable to pay for any loss , 
damage, or deprivation occasioned . . . by the improper exercise of any power 
of sale in a mortgage,” HRS § 501 -216, the effect of an entry of a 
certificate of title with respect to the State’s role as guarantor has 
implications in other contexts involving registered land.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
36   T reating a stamped deed with an assigned  TCT number as 
a certificate of title that precludes an aggrieved person from 
recovering property would thus pose a significantly  increased 
liability risk for the State.  See Legis. Reference Bureau, Two 
Land Recording Systems , H.R. 47 -7, at 20  (1987) (“[T]he single 
claim of $110,000 paid in 1986 by the State,  pursuant to the 
provisions of [HRS § 501-212] has nearly depleted the total 
amount of fees estimated to have been collected for the 
fund . . . .”).  If the statutory  determinative point when title 
becomes unimpeachable is to be made effective prior to the 
issuance of a certificate of title, it must be the result of  
legislative amendments  to HRS Chapter 501, and not of a change 
in practice of the Land Court.  
3. Wells Fargo’s Admission  
  Omiya asserts that Wells Fargo admitted in the 
complaint that a new certificate number was issued in favor of 
Omiya.  The ICA, after concluding that a TCT number has the same 
effect as issuance of an actual certificate of title , then 
determined that Wells Fargo ’s complaint contained a judicial 
admission that issuance of the TCT number in this case had the 
effect of registering title in  Omiya’s name.   
  A judicial admission is a formal statement, either by 
a party or his or her attorney, in the course of a judicial 
proceeding that removes an admitted fact from the field of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
37 controversy.  Lee v. Puamana Cmty. Ass ’n, 109 Hawai‘ i 561, 573, 
128 P.3d 874, 886 (2006).   “It is a voluntary concession of fact 
by a party or a party’s attorn ey during judicial proceedings. ”  
Id.  Omiya points to two paragraphs in the complaint that he 
argues contains judicial admissions.  The first reads as 
follows: 
[Plaintiff]  . . . alleges and avers, as follows:  . . . .  
 3. That Defendant DANIEL TSUKASA OMIYA (“Omiya”), 
husband of Sandra Sachiko Omiya, whose address is 1314 
South King Street, Suite 1052, Honolulu, 96814 also claims 
to the be owner of the Property by virtue of that certain 
Quitclaim Deed filed on September 15,  2010 as Document No. 
3999421 in the Office of the Assistant Registrar of the 
Land Court, State of Hawaii which resulted in the issuance 
of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 996,234 registering  
title in the name of Defendant Omiya . 
(Emphasis added.)  The other paragraph Omiya points to states 
the following: 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays, as follows:  
 1. As to Count One, the Court declare the 
foreclosure sale of the Property conducted by Defendant 
Ilikai null and void; that all parties claiming by, through 
or under said foreclosure sale, including but not limited 
to Defendant Omiya, have no legal interest in the Property; 
that Plaintiff be declared the legal owner of the Property; 
and the Assistant Registrar of the Land Court, State of 
Hawaii, be directed to take such action as necessary to 
restore legal title to Plaintiff, including but not limited 
to, cancellation of TCT No. 996,234 issued to Defendant 
Omiya. 
(Emphasis added.)  Omiya specifically references the underscored 
language in both paragraphs as constituting judicial admissions.   
  HRS §  501-118 allows impeachment of non -judicial 
foreclosure proceedings of registered land “prior to the entry 
of a new certificate of title. ”  HRS §  501-118.  The first ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
38 purported admission states that the filed quitclaim deed 
“resulted in the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 
996,234 registering title in the name of Defendant Omiya .”  The 
statement does not admit that a new certificate of title  was 
issued and then entered;  rather, it admits only that a new 
certificate number was issued.33  The second contended admission 
requests that the circuit court cancel the TCT number that was 
issued.  It does not request that a certificate of title be 
cancelled.  Neither of Wells Fargo’s state ments in the complaint 
admits that a new certificate  of title was issued.   
4. Erroneous Grant of Summary Judgment 
  In  this case, Omiya presented a quitclaim deed to the 
assistant registrar, who stamped it with the date and time.  
That stamp registered the quitclaim deed, making it effective as 
a conveyance.  See  HRS §§ 501-101, 501-107 (Supp. 2016); supra 
note 23.  For the reasons discussed , register ing a quitclaim 
deed is not equivalent to the creation or entry of a new 
certificate of title
.  As Wells Fargo argued, the evidence does 
not show that a new certificate of title was 
entered; had one 
been created, a certified and sealed copy of the certificate 
would have been admissible as evidence.  See
 HRS § 501-88 (2006) 
                     
 33 Judge Ginoza’s dissent aptly observe d that the complaint was not 
dispositive: “Rather, the pertinent question under HRS §  501-118 is whether 
there has been ‘entry of a new certificate of title.’”   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
39 (certified and sealed copies of certificates “shall be received 
as evidence in all the courts of the State”); cf. Aames Funding 
Corp. v. Mores , 107 Hawai ʻi 95, 97, 110 P.3d 1042,  1044 (2005) 
(“Trial began with both parties stipulating to the authenticity 
of . . . a certified copy of TCT No. 587,098,” which was 
accepted into evidence).    
  In addition, t he stamp on the quitclaim deed in this 
case reads “Issuance of Cert(s) 996,234.”   Based on this stamp, 
Omiya argued that a new certificate had been issued.  But, as 
explained, assignment of a new TCT number does not demonstrate 
that a new certificate of title has been duly prepared and 
entered.  Thus, the record in this case does not show that “ a 
new certificate of title has been entered,” which is required to 
invoke the statutory protec tion provided by HRS § 501-118.34 
  In affirming the circuit court’s grant of summary 
judgment, the ICA adopted the circui t court’s interpretation 
that the assignment of a TCT number has the same effect as  a new 
certificate of title.  As explained, this conclusion is 
contradicted by the plain language of HRS § 501- 118, statutes 
and rules that are in pari materia, the legislative history of 
HRS Chapter 501, and the statutory scheme underlying the Land 
                     
 34 Wells Fargo argued that Omiya did not present a certificate of 
title meeting the definition of RLC Rule 52.  Omiya does not contend that he 
presented such a document.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
40 Court system.  Accordingly, equating a TCT number to issuance 
and entry of a new certificate of title was error, and the grant 
of summary judgment in favor of Omiya on this ground  was 
improper. 
B. Adequacy of Purchase Price 
  Wells Fargo also contends that the circuit court 
erroneously granted summary judgment in favor of Omiya because  
there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the 
AOAO used reasonable means to obtain the best price for the 
Property.  Omiya counters that Wells Fargo’s challenge is barred 
by HRS § 501- 118 and that, even if it were not, Wells Fargo did 
not submit admissible evidence of the value of the Property.  
Because we have concluded that Wells Fargo ’s complaint is not 
barred by HRS § 501- 118, its  contention as to the adequacy of 
the price for the Property may be considered.  
  
Mortgagees exercising their right to non- judicial 
foreclosure under a power of sale must do so “in a manner that 
is fair, reasonably diligent, and in good faith, and to 
demonstrate that an adequate price was procured for the 
property.”  Kondaur Capital Corp. v. Matsuyoshi , 136 Hawai ‘i 227, 
240, 361 P.3d 454, 467 (2015) (citing Ulrich v. Sec . Inv. Co., 
35 Haw. 158, 168 (Haw. Terr. 1939)); see also id. at 239–40, 361 
P.3d at 466–67 (holding that duties under Ulrich apply to non-***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
41 judicial foreclosures of real property).35  Although “the 
mortgagee’s duty to seek the best price under the circumstances 
does not require the mortgagee to obtain the fair market value 
of the property[,]” “ the mortgagee nonetheless has a duty to use 
fair and reasonable means to conduct the foreclosure sale in a 
manner that is conducive to obtaining the best price under the 
circumstances.”  Hungate v. Law Office of David B. Rosen , 139 
Hawai‘i 394, 408 –09, 391 P.3d 1, 15 –16 (2017) .  
  “[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, 
together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no 
genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party 
is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Kondaur, 136 
Hawai‘i at 240, 361 P.3d at 467 (quoting Price v. AIG Haw. Ins. 
Co., 107 Hawai i 106, 110, 111 P.3d 1, 5 (2005)).  All evidence 
and inferences therefrom are to  be viewed in the light most 
favorable to the non-moving party.  Id.  
                     
 35 The foreclosure by the AOAO was conducted under power of sale 
pursuant to, inter alia, HRS §§  667-5 to 667 -10.  The AOAO was therefore 
subject to the requirements of Ulrich and Kondaur .  See Hungate v. Law Office 
of David B. Rosen, 139 Hawai i 394, 408, 391 P.3d 1, 15 (2017); see also  
Kondaur, 136 Hawai i at 230 n.3, 361 P.3d at  457 n.3 (“HRS §§ 667–5 to 667– 10 
governed the process of foreclosure by power of sale (i.e., non -judicial 
foreclosure) and were within Part I of HRS Chapter 667.  HRS §§ 667 –5 to 667–
8 were repealed by the legislature in 2012.” (citing 2012 Haw. Sess. Law s Act 
182, § 50 at 684)). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
42   Before this court, Wells Fargo cites the 2010 tax-
assessed value that was included with the quitclaim deed 
submitted by Omiya to support its contention that summary 
judgment was improperly granted.  Omiya contends that we should 
not consider the 2010 tax-assessed value because Wells Fargo did 
not make that argument or specifically point to that evide
nce 
before the circuit court, therefore waiving use of that 
evidence.  
  
Omiya cites in support of its argument Munoz v. Yuen , 
which noted that “ in reviewing a summary judgment, this court 
will not examine evidentiary documents, such as depositions and 
admissions, not specifically called to the attention of the 
trial court, even though they may be on file in the case.”  66 
Haw. 603, 606, 670 P.2d 8 25, 827 (1983).  In Munoz, none of the 
documents filed in support of and in opposition to the motion 
for summary judgment cited the depositions that the appellant 
sought to rely upon on appeal to establish a genuine issue of 
material fact.  Id.   Nor were the depositions referenced during 
the hearing.  Id.  In contrast, Omiya included the quitclaim 
deed and the 2010 tax- assessed value as an exhibit to his  
summary judgment motion.  Accordingly, the 2010 tax -assessed ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
43 value would have been within the circuit court’s attention 
during the summary judgment proceedings.36 
  The 2010 tax- assessed value as of June 22, 2010, 
before the August 18, 2010 foreclosure sale, was $281,100.  
Omiya paid $15,000 at the foreclosure sale.  The difference 
between the assessed value and the purchase price, viewed in the 
light most favorable to Wells Fargo as the non- moving party, 
creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the AOAO 
used reasonable means to obtain the best price for the Property.  
Therefore, the grant of summary judgment as to the adequacy of 
the bid price for the Property was erroneous.37 
                     
 36 Additionally, Omiya argues that the internet printout showing a 
2012 tax assessment that Wells Fargo submitted with the Perez Declaration was 
inadmissible hearsay and not relevant, as the tax -assessed value was for a 
time period after the foreclosure took place.  In light of our conclusion 
with regard to the evidence of the 2010 tax -assessed value of the Property 
before the circuit court, this argument is not addressed.  
 37 Omiya raises other arguments that are unavailing.  Omiya  contends 
that because Wells Fargo stipulated to receiving foreclosure -related notice, 
Wells Fargo “waiv[ed] any challenge to the underlying foreclosure notice, 
process, or conduct that resulted in the foreclosure sale price.”  Aside from 
the fact that Omiya raises this argument for the first time in his  response 
to the application for a writ of certiorari, it is without merit.  Hungate, 
which Omiya relies upon for its contention, does not indicate that 
stipulating to notice precludes any challenge to a foreclosure sale.  After 
discussing the common -law duty addressed in Kondaur and Ulrich, this court 
held that what had to be proven was “that the sale was fairly conducted and 
resulted in an adequate price under the circumstances.”  Hungate, 139 Hawai i 
at 408-09, 391 P.3d at 15 -16 (citing Kondaur , 136 Hawai i at 240- 42, 361 P.3d 
at 467-69).   
  Omiya also argues for the first time before this court  that “a 
defective non- judicial foreclosure process results in merely voidable title, 
not void,” and, accor dingly, “Wells Fargo’s remedy is limited to monetary 
damages against the alleged wrongful foreclosing party, [the AOAO ,] not the 
foreclosure buyer,” because “an innocent purchaser like [himself] is 
protected.”  (Citing Mount v. Apao, 139 Hawai i 167, 169, 384 P.3d 1268, 1270

44 IV. CONCLUSION 
  For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the ICA’s August 
29, 2017 Judgment on Appeal; the circuit court’s Order Granting 
Defendant Daniel Tsukasa
 Omiya’s Motion for Summary Judgment or, 
Alternatively, to Dismiss for Failure to Comply with Discovery 
Order, Filed December 21, 2011, filed March 29, 2012; the Order 
Granting Defendant Daniel Tsukasa Omiya’s Motion for Entry 
of Rule 54(b) Final Judgment, Filed April 18, 2012, filed June 
6, 2012; and the Amended Partial Final Judgment In Favor of 
Defendant Daniel Tsukasa Omiya, filed February 5, 2013.   The 
case is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings 
consistent with this opinion.

In his motion for summary judgment, Omiya argued only that he was statutorily 
protected because a certificate of title had issued, and this was the sole 
basis of the circuit court’s ruling.  The circuit court did not consider 
whether an innocent purchaser of property registered in the Land Court system 
is protected when a certificate of title has not issued, nor did the court 
make any finding that Omiya was in fact an innocent purchaser.  Accordingly, 
we do not address these issues.
