 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J. 
I. Introduction 
This appeal raises an issue of first impression in Hawai i: 
what standard applies in reviewing the enforceability of an 
arbitrator-selection provision? We adopt the “fundamental 
fairness” standard set forth by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in McMullen v. Meijer, Inc., 355 
F.3d 485 (6th Cir. 2004), and we hold that the arbitrator-
selection provision at issue in this appeal was fundamenta
lly 
unfair, because it gave the defendant’s agent “sole discretion” to select an arbitration service to resolve a dispute between the plaintiffs and defendant. In the instant case, the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit (“circuit court”)
1 properly severed 
and struck the arbitrator-selection provision and ordered the parties to meet and confer to select an arbitration service. 
The circuit court also properly reserved for itself the 
authority to appoint an arbitration service if the parties could 
not come to an agreement. Therefore, we vacate the ICA’s judgment on appeal, which vacated the circuit court’s “Order 
Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendant Gentry Homes, 
Ltd.’s Motion to Compel Arbitration Filed August 29, 2012,” and 
its “Order Denying Gentry Homes’ Motion for Reconsideration of 
the Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Gentry Homes, 
1 The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Ltd.’s Motion to Compel Arbitration [Filed August 29, 2012], 
Filed on November 13, 2012.” The circuit court’s orders are 
affirmed. 
II. Background 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings 
1. The First Amended Class Action Complaint 
On October 12, 2011, Petitioners/Plaintiffs-Appellees 
Thomas Nishimura and Colette Nishimura, individually and on 
behalf of a class of all persons similarly situated 
(“Nishimuras”), filed their First Amended Class Action 
Complaint. The Nishimuras alleged that Gentry Homes, Ltd. 
(“Gentry”) constructed the Nishimuras’ home without adequate 
high wind protection. 
2. Motion to Compel Arbitration 
On August 29, 2012, Gentry filed its Motion to Compel 
Arbitration, pursuant to the following provision in the Home Builder’s Limited Warranty (“HBLW”) between Gentry and the Nishimuras (with emphasized portions relevant to this appeal): 
VIII. Binding Arbitration Procedure  
Any disputes between YOU and US, or parties acting on OUR 
behalf, including PWC, [2]  related to or arising from this 
LIMITED WARRANTY, the design or construction of the HOME or 
the COMMON ELEMENTS or the sale of the HOME or transfer of 
title to the COMMON ELEMENTS will be resolved by binding 
arbitration. Binding arbitration shall be the sole remedy 
for resolving any and all disputes between YOU and US, or OUR representatives.  
 
 
. . . . 
 
2 “PWC” stands for “Professional Warranty Service Corporation,” the 
company administering the HBLW pursuant to a contract with Gentry. 
3
  
 
 
  
  
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The arbitration shall be conducted by Construction 
Arbitration Services, Inc., or such other reputable 
arbitration service that PWC shall select, at its sole 
discretion, at the time the request for arbitration is 
submitted. The rules and procedures of the designated arbitration organization, that are in effect at the time the request for arbitration is submitted, will be followed.  
A copy of the applicable rules and procedures will be 
delivered to YOU upon request. 
This arbitration agreement shall be governed by the United 
States Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1 -16) to the exclusion 
of any inconsistent state law, regulation or judicial decision. The award of the arbitrator shall be final and 
binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. . . . 
The Nishimuras ’ Opposition to Gentry Homes’ Motion to 
Compel Arbitration drew the circuit court’s attention to a 
notice on Construction Arbitration Services, Inc.’s website, 
announcing that it had “permanently  exit[ed] from the binding 
construction arbitration dispute case administration business effective July 1, 20 09.” (Emphasis in original.) Thus, under 
the HBLW’s arbitrator -selection provision, PWC was authorized to 
“select, at its sole discretion” “such other reputable 
arbitration service” to conduct the arbitration. “Reputable” 
was not defined in the HBLW. The Nishimuras argued that the 
instant arbitrator-selection provision contained no safeguards 
against “potential bias,” and that PWC was empowered to choose 
any arbitrator, including one with a pro-defense view.    
The Nishimuras 
feared that PWC would select an arbitration 
service aligned with developers, because PWC marketed its “close 
relationship” with Zurich, the parent of the insurance company 
for Haseko Homes, Inc. and Haseko Construction, Inc., which at 
4

  
 
 
     
  
     
    

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that time was also being sued for the same construction defect 
as in the instant case. The Nishimuras alleged that PWC would 
have a “strong financial incentive in helping secure an outcome 
in favor of Gentry in the instant action. . . .” They noted 
that another circuit court judge had severed and stricken the arbitrator-selection provision in the Haseko case “on the ground 
of PWC’s conflict of interest. . . .” The Nishimuras argued, 
“Allowing a party so closely aligned with the defendants in a 
similar case involving similar 
claims before this Court to 
unilaterally select the arbitrator would deprive Plaintiffs of a 
fair and effective forum in whi ch to vindicate their claims.” 
In support of their argument, the Nishimuras cited, inter alia, 
McMullen , 355 F.3d 485. 
In its Reply, Gentry argued 
that the Nishimuras set forth 
“no evidence of bias with the ultimate arbitrator,” b ecause none 
had been selected. Gentry pointed out that the arbitration-selection provision authorized PWC to choose an arbitration service, not the ultimate arbitrator.  Gentry also argued that a 
party who does not consent to the other party’s choice of 
arbitrator can petition the court to appoint an arbitrator. 
Gentry also argued that a party must await the conclusion of 
arbitration to raise a challen ge of “evident partiality” in the 
arbitrator.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
At a hearing on the Motion to Compel Arbitration, counsel 
for the Nishimuras asked the circuit court to sever and strike 
the arbitrator-selection provision, order the parties to agree 
to a local arbitrator, or appoint one itself, as another circuit 
court had done in the Haseko case. Counsel for Gentry countered 
that he did not believe the circuit court had the authority to 
order the parties to agree to an arbitrator. The circuit court, 
on the other hand, s tated that “just on the face of” the HBLW 
arbitrator-selection provision, “there is a potential conflict 
. . . .” The circuit court stated to Gentry’s counsel, “[T]he 
less you have to reserve in the future as possible appealable 
issues, the better. . . . ” 
The circuit court therefore granted in part and denied in 
part Gentry’s Motion to Compel Arbitration. While it ordered 
the Nishimuras to arbitrate their claims against Gentry, the circuit court found the following: 
The Motion is DENIED to the extent that this Court finds 
that there is a potential conflict of interest with 
Professional Warranty Services, Inc. (“PWC”) selecting the 
arbitration service as set forth under the Home Builder’s 
Limited Warranty. Accordingly, the method by which the 
arbitration service is to be selected under the Home Builders’ Limited Warranty is severed and stricken. 
Pursuant to Hawaii Rules of the Circuit Courts Rule 12.2
3, 
3 Hawaii Rules of the Circuit Courts (“RCCH”) Rule 12.2(a) (2012) 
provides the following, in relevant part: 
Authority to order.  The court, sua sponte or upon motion by 
a party, may, in exercise of its discretion, order the 
parties to participate in a non -binding Alternative Dispute 
Resolution process (ADR or ADR process) subject to terms 
and conditions imposed by the cour
t. ADR includes 
mediation, summary jury trial, neutral evaluation, non - 
(continued. . .)

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
this Court orders that Plaintiffs and Gentry shall meet and 
confer on the selection of a local arbitration service 
within forty -five (45) days of entry of this Order.  If 
Plaintiffs and Gentry are unable to agree, the Court shall select a local arbitration service for this matter. 
3. Motion for Reconsideration 
Gentry filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the circuit 
court’s order asking the court to set aside the provision 
severing and striking the arbitrator-selection provision.  In 
addition to reiterating arguments that the time to challenge 
arbitrator bias is post-award and that the Nishimuras had 
presented no evidence of bias or potential bias, Gentry argued 
that RCCH Rule 12.2 did not authorize the circuit court to 
“modify the parties’ agreement for binding arbitration. . . .”  
Gentry argued that RCCH Rule 12.2 authorizes court-mandated non-
binding arbitration, not binding arbitration, which is what the 
parties had agreed to in the HBLW. 
In the Nishimuras’ Opposition to Gentry’s Motion for 
Reconsideration, they argued that the circuit court had “broad 
discretion to appoint an arbitration service (or here, order the 
parties to meet and confer to appoint one) when the specified 
arbitration service is no longer in business or the arbitrator 
3  (. . .continued)  
binding arbitration, presentation to a focus group, or 
other such process the court determines may be helpful in 
encouraging an economic and 
fair resolution of all or any 
part of the disputes presented in the matter.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
is partial to one of the par ties.” The Nishimuras then cited to 
9 U.S.C. § 5 (2009),4 which states the following: 
If in the agreement provision be made for a method of 
naming or appointing an arbitrator or arbitrators or an 
umpire, such method shall be followed; but if no method be provided therein, or if a method be provided and any party 
thereto shall fail to avail himself of such method, or if 
for any other reason there shall be a lapse in the naming 
of an arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire, or in filling a 
vacancy, then upon the application of either party to the controversy the court shall designate and appoint an 
arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire, as the case may 
require, who shall act under the said agreement with the 
same force and effect as if he or they had been 
specifically named therein; and unless otherwise provided 
in the agreement the arbitration shall be by a single 
arbitrator. 
The circuit court denied Gentry ’s Motion for 
Reconsideration. Gentry then timely appealed the circuit 
court’s order granting in part and denying in part its Motion to 
Compel Arbitration, as well as the circuit court’s o rder denying 
its Motion for Reconsideration. 
B. ICA Appeal 
1. Opening Brief 
In its Opening Brief, Gentry raised the following Points of 
Error: 
1. Whether the trial court erred in denying, in part, 
Gentry’s Motion to Compel Arbitration and ordering Gentry 
and Plaintiffs to meet and confer on the selection of the 
arbitration service in contravention of the express terms 
of the parties’ arbitration agreement as set forth in the 
[HBLW] that Plaintiffs rely upon in bringing their claims 
against Gentry. 
2. Whether the trial court erred in denying Gentry’s 
Motion for Reconsideration. 
4 9 U.S.C. § 5 is a provision in the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 
U.S.C. §§ 1- 16 (2009) (“FAA”). The parties do not dispute that the FAA 
governs their arbitration agreement.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
3. Whether the trial court erred in finding that PWC had a 
potential conflict of interest in selecting the arbitration 
service pursuant to the terms of the parties’ arbitrati on 
agreement as set forth in the [HBLW]. 4. Whether the trial court erred in finding that PWC’s 
potential conflict in selecting the arbitration service was 
a sufficient basis to strike that portion of the parties’ 
arbitration agreement requiring PWC to select the 
arbitration service in order to avoid a future appealable 
issue. 
5. Whether the trial court erred in relying upon Hawai ʻi 
Rules of the Circuit Court s Rule 12.2 as the basis to order 
the parties to meet and confer on the selection of a local 
arbitration service in contravention of the express terms 
of the parties’ arbitration agreement as set forth in the [HBLW] requiring PWC to select the arbitration service. 
Gentry first argued that RCCH Rule 12.2 governs non-binding 
arbitration and did not authorize the circuit court to order the 
parties into binding arbitration. 
Gentry next argued that the circuit court “lacked 
jurisdiction under the FAA to entertain the Nishimuras[’] pre -
arbitration challenge to the partiality of the not yet selected 
arbitrator.” Gentry cited to 9 U.S.C. § 10  (2009) 5 as authority 
for its position that the time to challenge the arbitrator’s 
partiality is after the issuance of the arbitration award, when 
the court is authorized to vacate an arbitration award “where 
there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them.” 
Gentry argued that, even if the circuit court had 
jurisdiction to entertain the Nishimura’s pre -arbitration 
5 9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(2) (2009) provides the following, in relevant 
part: “[T]he United States court in and for the district wherein the award 
was made may make an order vacating the award upon the application of any 
party to the arbitration -- . . . where there was evident partiality or 
corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them.” 
9
  
 
 
    
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“challenge to the partiality of the not -yet-selected 
arbitrator,” the Nishimuras did not establish that any 
arbitration service selected by PWC pursuant to the HBLW would 
be biased toward Gentry. Gentry cited Phillips v. Assocs.  Home 
Equity Servs., Inc. , 179 F.Supp.2d 840, 845 (N.D. Ill. 2001)  ,  
for the following proposition : “In the absence of credible 
evidence of actual bias   in favor of the lenders, we ‘decline to 
indulge the presumption that the parties and arbitral body conducting a proceeding will be unable or unwilling to retain 
competent, conscientious and impartial arbitrators.’”   (Emphasis 
added.) Gentry also cited Doctor’s Assocs., Inc. v. Stuart , 85 
F.3d 975, 981 (2d Cir. 1996), for its rejection of the 
defendants’ argument that an arbitration agreement was 
unconscionable, because the defendants “failed to present  any 
credible evidence indicating bias on the part of the 
[arbitration service or its arbitrators,] particularly because 
[d]efendants’ claims have not yet gone to arbitration.”  
2. Answering Brief 
In their Answering Brief, the Nishimuras disagreed wit
h 
Gentry’s argument that a challenge to the arbitrator -selection 
process must be raised after the arbitrator has issued an arbitration award. 
The Nishimuras cited McMullen , 355 F.3d 485, 
and Walker v. Ryan’s Family Steak Houses, Inc. , 400 F.3d 370, 
385 (6th  Cir. 2005), for the proposition that “the general rule 
10  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
prohibiting pre-arbitration challenges to an allegedly biased 
arbitration panel does not extend to an allegation that the 
arbitrator-selection process itself is fundamentally unfair. In 
such a case, ‘the arbitral forum is not an effective substitute 
for a judicial forum,’ and, therefore, the party need not 
arbitrate first and then allege bias through post arbitration 
judicial review.” The Nishimuras argued that once a court 
determines that the arbitrator-selection process is 
fundamentally unfair, then 9 U.S.C. § 5 authorizes the court to 
“choose an alternative method for selecting the arbitrator.” 
Next, the Nishimuras argued that there was sufficient 
evidence to support the circuit court’s findin g that PWC had a 
conflict of interest rendering the arbitration-selection 
provision fundamentally unfair, based upon PWC’s relationship 
with insurance companies and builders, as well as the language 
of the HBLW. The Nishimuras pointed out that “the arbitr ator 
selection process contains no safeguards against potential 
bias,” and that PWC, acting on Gentry’s behalf, “can literally 
choose any arbitration service it unilaterally deems to be 
‘reputable. . . .’” 
As to Gentry’s argument that RCCH Rule 12.2 did not 
authorize the circuit court to order the parties to meet and 
confer to select a local arbitration service, the Nishimuras 
counter-argued that the circuit court relied on that rule only 
11
  
 
 
  
   
 
  
   
  
 
  

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
for the limited purpose of ordering the parties to attempt to 
agree on an arbitration service; it did not order the parties 
into binding arbitration under the rule. 
3. The ICA’s Published Opinion 
The ICA issued a published opinion. Nishimura v. Gentry 
Homes, Ltd., 133 Hawai i 222, 325 P.3d 634 (App. 2014). The ICA 
asserted that the HBLW provision stating that PWC “act[s] on 
[Gentry’s] behalf” merely served to “put a distance between 
Gentry’s interest and the arbitrator,” but did not authorize PWC 
to potentially “select an arbitration service that would res olve 
arbitration in favor of Gentry.” 133 Hawai i at 228, 325 P.3d at 
640. As such, the ICA concluded that the HBLW’s language “does 
not establish PWC’s improper motives or evident partiality.” 
Id. 
The ICA then distinguished Walker, 400 F.3d 370, and 
McMullen , 355 F.3d 485, from the instant case. 133 Hawai i at 
228, 325 P.3d at 640. The ICA distinguished Walker
, stating 
that the plaintiff employees in Walker entered into an 
arbitration agreement with the very entity that would arbitrate 
their disputes with their employer, unlike the instant case, 
where PWC “would not itself serve as an arbitrator and was 
required to select a reputable arbitration service.” Id. The 
ICA distinguished McMullen , stating that the arbitration clause 
12

  
 
 
  
  
  
   
     
 
  
 
 
   

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
at issue in that case gave the defendant employer unilateral 
control over the pool of potential arbitrators, unlike the 
instant case, where PWC, not Gentry, selects an arbitration 
service. Id. The ICA then “decline[d] to conclude that PWC’s 
potential conflict of interest constitutes bias rendering the arbitrator-selection process under the [HBLW] so ‘fundamentally 
unfair’ as to be unenforceable.” Id. The ICA then concluded 
that the circuit court’s actions in invalidating the arbitrator -
selection provision before PWC selected the arbitration service were premature and improper. Id. According to the ICA, 
“Nishimura Plaintiffs are not precluded from challenging the 
arbitration service designated by PWC or the neutral arbitrator 
selected by that service for bias upon appropri
ate proof before 
the start of the arbitration proceedings.” Id. 
Although its discussion up to this point in the opinion 
focused on the fundamental fairness of the arbitrator
-selection 
process, the ICA’s opinion then shifted to a discussion on unconscionability. 
Id. Specifically, the ICA held, “In order 
to avoid enforcement of an allegedly unconscionable arbitration clause, Nishimura Plaintiffs were required to present evidence 
of actual partiality or bias of the arbitration service 
designated by PWC or the neutral arbitrator selected.” Id.  
(citing Doctor’s Assocs. Inc. , 85 F.3d at 981) (emphasis added). 
The ICA then cited Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp. , 500 
13

  
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
U.S. 20, 30 (1991), to conclude that the Nishimuras’ 
contentions, “based on circumstances of PWC’s business 
relationships,” constituted merely a “‘generalized attack’ on 
PWC’s impartiality,” resting on a suspicion of arbitration out 
of step with the United States Supreme Court’s endorsement of 
this method of dispute resolution. 133 Hawai i at 229, 325 P.3d 
at 641. Without proof of “actual partiality or bias,” the ICA 
held, “the circuit court should have confined judicial review to 
the fairness of the completed arbitration award, at which time 9 
U.S.C. § 10 could provide for vacating the award upon a finding 
that the arbitrators acted with evident partiality.” Id.  
The ICA then concluded that the circuit court should have 
enforced the HBLW’s arbitrator -selection provision. Id. The 
ICA vacated the order granting in part and denying in part 
Gentry’s motion to compel arbitration, as well as the order 
denying Gentry’s motion for reconsideration. Id.
 The ICA then 
remanded the case to the circuit court for further proceedings. Id.    
III. Standard of Review 
An appellate court reviews a trial court’s order granting 
or denying a motion to compel arbitration de novo, using the 
“same standard employed by the trial court and based upon the same evidentiary materials ‘as were before [ it] in determination 
14

  
 
 
  
 
   
   
 
 
 
  	
	

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
of the motion.” Koolau Radiology, Inc. v. Queens Med. Ctr., 73 
Haw. 433, 440, 834 P.2d 1294, 1298 (1992) (citations omitted). 
IV. 	Discussion 
A. 	The “Fundamental Fairness” Standard in Challenges 
to the Arbitrator-Selection Process 
Preliminarily, we note that the parties agree that the HBLW 
is governed by the FAA. 9 U.S.C. § 2 (2009) provides the  
following: 
A written provision in any maritime transaction or a 
contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to 
settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform 
the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing 
to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising 
out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be 
valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, 
save upon such grounds 
as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any 
contract.  
(Emphasis added). Thus, under the FAA, invalidation of an 
arbitration provision is authorized.  In determining whether an 
arbitrator-selection provision is enforceable, we adopt the 
“fundamental fairness” standard set forth by the Sixth Cir cuit 
in McMullen , 355 F.3d 485.  
In McMullen, on the eve of arbitration, after an arbitrator 
had been selected, a plaintiff employee (“McMullen”) brought an 
action challenging the fairness of the arbitrator
-selection 
process. 355 F.3d at 488. The arbitration agreement granted her employer “exclusive control over the pool of potential 
arbitrators from which the arbitrator is selected.” 355 F.3d at 
487. From that pool of potential arbitrators, the employer and 
15
  
 
 
  
 
  
  
   
 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
employee each struck an arbitrator until only one remained.  355 
F.3d at 488. 
McMullen’s employer counter -argued that the bias McMullen 
“fears will manifest itself during her arbitration hearing is, 
at this point, merely potential  bias.” 355 F.3d at 494 
(emphasis in original). Quoting 
Gilmer, the Sixth Circuit 
acknowledged that the United States Supreme Court, “when 
presented with an allegation of hypothetical bias, ‘decline[d] 
to indulge the presumption that the parties and arbitral body 
conducting a proceeding will be unable or unwi
lling to retain 
competent, conscientious and impartial arbitrators.’” Id. 
(citing 
Gilmer
, 500 U.S. at 30). The Sixth Circuit recognized, 
however, that McMullen’s claim went “beyond an allegation of a 
potentially biased arbitrator because McMullen cites a lack of 
fairness inherent in the arbitrator-selection process.” Id. 
The Sixth Circuit explained that the employer’s arbitration agreement “grants one party to the arbitration unilateral control over the pool of potential arbitrators. This procedure 
prevents [the employer’s arbitration program] from being an 
effective substitute for a judicial forum because it inherently 
lacks neutrality.” 
Id. (footnote omitted). 
Like Gentry, McMullen’s employer also argued that “ Gilmer 
clearly establishes that the pr
eferred method of challenging 
allegations of bias is to pursue the underlying claims through 
16
  
 
 
   
 
  
  
 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the arbitration process and then seek review only ‘[w]here there 
was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators [under 9 
U.S.C. § 10].’” 355 F.3d at 494 n.7. The Sixth Circuit 
disagreed. The court stated, “While this is true for allegations of potential or hypothetical bias among the 
arbitrators, it does not apply to an allegation, as is present 
here, that the arbitrator-selection process is fundamentally 
unfair. . . . [P]rocedural unfairness inherent in an 
arbitration agreement may be challenged before the arbitration.” 
Id. As such, the Sixth Circuit recognized, “When the process 
used to select the arbitrator is fundamentally unfair, as in this case, the arbitral forum is not an effective substitute for 
a judicial forum, and there is no need to present separate 
evidence of bias or corruption in the particular arbitrator 
selected.” Id.   
Several cases since McMullen have also explored fundamental 
fairness in arbitrator-selection clauses.  In Walker, 400 F.3d 
370, plaintiff employees filed a complaint for FLSA violations 
against the defendant employer, Ryan’s Family Steak Houses, Inc. 
(“Ryan’s”). 400 F.3d at 373. Ryan’s moved to compel 
arbitration and to dismiss the complaint. Id. The district 
court denied the motion, concluding, inter alia, that the 
arbitration forum outlined in the arbitration agreements between employer and employees did not provide for effective vindication 
17
  
 
 
   
 
  
  
 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
of statutory claims and was an inappropriate substitute for the 
judicial forum. Id. The Sixth Circuit affirmed. 400 F.3d at 
372. 
In the Walker case, the employees signed arbitration 
agreements with Employment Dispute Services Inc., (“EDSI”), not 
their employer, Ryan’s. 400 F.3d at 374.  Ryan’s had entered 
into a contract with EDSI to have EDSI administer an employment 
dispute resolution program. Id. By entering into the 
arbitration agreements with EDSI, the employees agreed to submit 
all employment disputes with Ryan’s t o binding arbitration with 
EDSI. 400 F.3d at 375. The arbitration rules provided that EDSI would select a panel of three potential arbitrators from 
the following separate pools: 
“(1) supervisors or managers of 
an employer signatory to an agreement with 
EDSI; (2) employees 
who are non-exempt from the wage and hour protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act; and (3) attorneys, retired judges, or 
other competent legal professional persons not associated with either party.” 
Id. From the pool of potential arbitrators 
selected by EDSI, the employee and employer would alternately strike names until only one name remained. 400 F.3d at 376. 
In 
Walker, the Sixth Circuit again acknowledged the general 
rule, set forth in Gilmer, that a party cannot avoid the 
arbitration process simply by alleging the arbitration panel will be biased, because 9 U.S.C. § 10 allows for the vacation of 
18
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
   
 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
an arbitration award, post-arbitration, for evident partiality 
in the arbitrator. 400 F.3d at 385. The Walker  Court also 
recognized the exception set forth in McMullen
 for pre-
arbitration challenges to the fundamental fairness of the 
arbitrator-selection process. Id.  The Walker court then held 
that EDSI’s arbitral forum was not neutral and, therefore, the arbitration agreements wer
e unenforceable.  400 F.3d at 385-86. 
The specific evidence the Walker
 court considered was that 
EDSI was a for-profit business, and Ryan’s annual fee accounted for over 42% of EDSI’s gross income in the year the employees 
filed their complaint. 400 F.3d at 386. Thus, “[g]iven the 
symbiotic relationship between Ryan’s and EDSI, Ryan’s effectively determines the three pools of arbitrators, thereby 
rendering the arbitral forum fundamentally unfair to claimants 
who are applicants or employees.” 
Id. The Sixth Circuit 
ultimately concluded that “EDSI’s and Ryan’s arbitration scheme does not allow for the effective vindication of Plaintiffs’ FLSA claims.” 400 F.3d at 388. The Sixth Circuit thus declined to 
enforce the arbitration agreements. Id. 
In Geiger 
v. Ryan’s Family Steak Houses, Inc. , 134 
F.Supp.2d 985 (S.D. Ind. 2001), the United States District Court 
for the Southern District of Indiana also had occasion to 
consider the arbitration agreement between EDSI and employees of 
Ryan’s. 
In that case, plaintiff employees sued Ryan’s under 
19
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 134 F.Supp.2d at 
988. As with Walker , the plaintiff employees’ arbitration 
agreement with EDSI allowed EDSI to select the three pools of 
arbitrators, and the employer and employee would alternately 
strike names from the pools of arbitrators until only one name 
remained. 134 F.Supp.2d at 990-91.  The district court held, 
“[T]here is a strong potential for bias in the selection of the 
arbitration panel.” 134 F.Supp.2d at 995. This was because 
EDSI received payment from its agreements with Ryan’s and “thus 
clearly has an incentive to maintain its contractual 
relationship with Ryan’s . . . while applicants or employees . . . have no leverage. . . .” 
Id. Further, the court noted, 
“EDSI also retains full authority to select both the Rules for 
arbitration as well as the pools of potential arbitrators. 
Such 
power in the face of the potential for bias on the part of EDSI in favor of employers such as Ryan’s renders it unlikely that 
applicants/employees will participate in an unbiased forum.” Id.
 (footnote omitted). 
McMullen
, Walker , and Geiger all hold that courts may 
entertain pre-arbitration challenges to the arbitrator-selection 
process, because such claims are the exception to the general 
rule that challenges to arbitrator bias must await the 
completion of arbitration under 9 U.S.C. § 10. Further,

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
McMullen and Walker hold that the standard by which a court 
analyzes arbitrator-selection clauses is fundamental fairness.6 
B. The ICA’s “Actual Bias” Holdings 
The ICA initially properly analyzed the Nishimuras’ case 
for fundamental fairness under McMullen  and Walker.  133 Hawai i 
at 228, 325 P.3d at 640. The ICA then distinguished those two 
cases and held that the Nishimuras did no
t present facts showing 
that the arbitrator-selection clause in the HBLW was 
fundamentally unfair. Id. The ICA then proceeded, however, to 
hold, “In order to avoid enforcement of an allegedly unconscionable arbitration clause, Nishimura Plaintiffs were 
required to present evidence of actual partiality or bias  of the 
arbitration service designated by PWC or the neutral arbitrator 
selected.” Id. (emphasis added). Later in the opinion, the ICA 
also held, “Because Nishimura Plaintiffs failed to prove that 
the arbitration selection process would necessarily result in 
actual partiality or bias , the circuit court should have 
6 We note that “fundamental fairness” in arbitration is a concept 
our appellate courts have already recognized. In In re Arbitration between 
United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL- CIO & City & Cnty. of Honolulu , 
119 Hawai i 201, 210, 194 P.3d 1163, 1172 (App. 2008), the ICA quoted the 
Prefatory Note to the revised Uniform Arbitration Act (2000), the basis of 
HRS Chapter 658A, for the proposition that “arbitration is a consensual 
process in which autonomy of the parties who enter into arbitration 
agreements should be given primary consideration, so long as their agreements 
conform to notions of fundamental fairness . . . .” (Emphasis added). See  
also Kay v. Kaiser Found. 
Health Plan, Inc.
, 119 Hawai i 219, 229, 194 P.3d
 
1181, 1191 (App. 2008) (“Arbitrators wield great power over the scope and 
nature of the arbitration proceedings and all determinations of fact and law, 
with virtually no appellate review of their decisions.  The fundamental 
‘fairness
’ of these expansive powers must be grounded in the assurance that 
neutral arbitrators are indeed neutral. . . .”) (Emphasis added). 
21
  
 
 
   
  
  
 
 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
confined judicial review to the fairness of the completed 
arbitration award, at which time 9 U.S.C. § 10 could provide for 
vacating the award upon a finding that the arbitrators acted 
with evident partiality.” 133 Hawai i at 229, 325 P.3d at 641 
(emphasis added). 
In support of this “actual bias” standard, the ICA cited to 
Doctor’s Assocs., Inc. , 85 F.3d 975.  Doctor’s Assocs., Inc. , 
however, did not involve a pre-arbitration challenge to the 
fundamental fairness of an arbitrator-selection provision.  
Rather, in that case, the defendants alleged that the 
arbitration service named in the arbitration agreement (American 
Arbitration Associati on or “AAA”) “relies on [the plaintiffs] to 
provide it with repeat business and thus has a bias in favor of 
[that party].” 85 F.3d at 980. The Second Circuit in that case 
rejected the argument, stating, “Defendants have failed to 
present any credible evidence indicating bias on the part of the 
AAA –- or its arbitrators –- in favor of [the plaintiffs] in 
this case, particularly because Defendants’ claims have not yet gone to arbitration.” 85 F.3d at 981 (citing 9 U.S.C. § 10(a)). Importantly, nowhere in the Doctor’s Assocs., Inc. opinion does 
the “actual bias” standard appear. 
Although not cited in the ICA’s published opinion, it 
appears that the “actual bias” language comes from Phillips , 179 
F.Supp.2d 840, which Gent
ry cited in its Opening Brief.  
22
  
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Phillips is also a case in which the fundamental fairness of an 
arbitrator-selection provision was not at issue. In that case, 
the arbitration agreement called for AAA to arbitrate the 
dispute. 179 F.Supp.2d at 843. The plaintiff in Phillips 
argued that “arbitration is inappropriate because the American Arbitration Association is biased in favor of the defendants,” 
and analogized her case to the series of cases involving EDSI. 
179 F.Supp.2d at 845. The United States District Court for the 
Northern District of Illinois rejected the argument, holding, 
“[The EDSI] cases are clearly distinguishable; in those cases, 
the defendants had ongoing service contracts with ESDI [sic] and 
paid ESDI [sic] to maintain an employment dispute resolution 
forum. Here, [the plaintiff] provides no evidence that the AAA, 
one of the country’s leading non -for-profit dispute resolution 
organizations, is on defendants’ payroll or any other evidence 
of actual bias on the part of the AAA.” Id. (emphasis added). 
In Phillips, only the bias of AAA was alleged, not the 
process by which AAA was selected as the arbitrator; nevertheless, the plaintiff and the district court analyzed the 
bias claim using the EDSI line of cases. While the financial 
interest linking EDSI to Ryan’s in Walker and Geiger arguably 
demonstrates “actual bias,” Phillips overstates the holding in 
those cases to conclude that only “actual bias” rendered the 
arbitrator-selection provisions fundamentally unfair. 
23
  
 
 
  
 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“Actual bias” need not be proven in a pre -arbitration 
challenge to an arbitrator-selection provision, where, as in 
McMullen, the mere fact of one party’s “exclusive control over 
the pool of potential arbitrators from which the arbitrator is 
selected” renders the arbitrator -selection process fundamentally 
unfair. 355 F.3d at 487, 494. In other words, an arbitrator-selection provision “grant[ing] one party to the arbitration 
unilateral control over the pool of potential arbitrators” 
prevents arbitration “from being an effective substitute for a 
judicial forum because it inherently lacks neutrality.” 355 
F.3d at 494. 
Further, contrary to Gentry’s argument and the ICA’s 
holding, the Nishimuras did not need to await PWC’s selection of 
the arbitration service and arbitrator before challenging the 
enforceability of the HBLW’s arbitrator -selection provision. We 
note that in McMullen
, the Sixth Circuit focused on the process 
of arbitrator selection, not any actual arbitrator or his or her alleged bias, even though an arbitrator had been selected in 
that case. 
See 355 F.3d at 488. Accordingly, the Sixth Circuit 
did not conclude that “actual bias” must be shown to render an 
arbitrator-selection process unfair; rather, the Sixth Circuit 
held, “When the process used to select the arbitrator is 
fundamentally unfai
r, . . . there is no need to present separate 
24
  
 
 
  
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 	 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
evidence of bias or corruption in the particular arbitrator 
selected.” 355 F.3d at 494 n.7.  
In short, we adopt the “fundamental fairness” standard 
under McMullen to review pre-arbitration challenges to the 
arbitrator-selection process. There is no requirement for a 
party challenging the arbitration-selection process to show 
“separate evidence of bias,” and, therefore, no requirement to 
show “actual bias” on the part of any particular arbitrator. 
Hence, the ICA erred in its holding that the Nishimuras needed 
to demonstrate “actual bias” in order to invalidate the HBLW’s 
arbitrator-selection provision. 133 Hawai i at 228-29, 325 P.3d 
at 640-41. 
C.	 Application of the “Fundamental Fairness” Standard to 
the Instant Case 
The HBLW arbitration provision states, in relevant part, 
the following: 
VIII. Binding Arbitration Procedure 
Any disputes between YOU and US, or parties acting on OUR 
behalf, including PWC, related to or arising from this 
LIMITED WARRANTY, the design or construction of the HOME or 
the COMMON ELEMENTS or the sale of the HOME or transfer of 
title to the COMMON ELEMENTS will be resolved by binding 
arbitration. Binding arbitration shall be the sole remedy for resolving any and all disputes between YOU and US, or 
OUR representatives. . . .  
The arbitration shall be conducted by Construction 
Arbitration Services, Inc., or such other reputable arbitration service that PWC shall select, at its sole 
discretion, at the time the request for arbitration 
is 
submitted. 
Ordinarily, an arbitration agreement is valid unless there is 
some basis to refuse to enforce it. 9 U.S.C. § 2.  In this 
25
  
 
 
  

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
case, PWC’s identification with Gentry provides a basis for 
finding the arbitrator-selection provision unenforceable as 
fundamentally unfair. The plain language of the arbitration 
agreement shows that PWC acts on Gentry’s behalf in 
administering the HBLW, which would include selecting an 
arbitration service, at PWC’s “sole discretion,” now that 
Construction Arbitration Services, Inc. is no longer available.  
As PWC acts on Gentry’s behalf under the HBLW, the Nishimuras’ 
concern that PWC’s exercise of its sole discretion is akin to 
Gentry’s exercise of such discretion is legitimate. As such, under McMullen, the HBLW’s ar bitrator-selection provision, which 
“grants one party to the arbitration unilateral control over the pool of potential arbitrators . . . prevents [arbitration under 
the parties’ agreement] from being an effective substitute for a judicial forum because it inherently lacks neutrality”; 
therefore, the arbitrator
-selection process is fundamentally 
unfair. 355 F.3d at 494, 494 n.7. Accordingly, the circuit court properly severed and struck the arbitrator-selection 
provision. Although the circuit court severed and struck the 
arbitrator-selection provision due to “potential conflict of 
interest,” and not expressly due to “fundamental unfairness,” we 
may “affirm a judgment of the lower court on any ground in the 
record that supports affirmance.”

(citations omitted). 
D. 	Fashioning Relief for an Unenforceable Arbitrator-
Selection Provision 
We next address whether the circuit court had the authority 
under RCCH Rule 12.2 to order the parties to meet and confer to 
select a local arbitration service. As Gentry points out, RCCH 
Rule 12.2(a) authorizes the circuit court to order non-binding 
arbitration, and the parties have agreed to binding arbitration under the HBLW: 
Authority to order. The court, sua sponte  or upon motion by 
a party, may, in exercise of its discretion, order the 
parties to participate in a non -binding Alternative Dispute 
Resolution process (ADR or ADR process) subject to terms 
and conditions i
mposed by the court. ADR includes 
mediation, summary jury trial, neutral evaluation, non -
binding arbitration, presentation to a focus group, or 
other such process the court determines may be helpful in 
encouraging an economic and fair resolution of all or any 
part of the disputes presented in the matter .  . . .   
(Emphasis added). On the other hand, as the Nishimuras 
point out, the circuit court did not order the parties into 
binding arbitration under RCCH Rule 12.2 to settle the construction defect dispute.  Rather, the circuit court 
ordered the parties to meet and confer to select a local 
arbitration service, which constitutes such other “process 
the court determines may be helpful in encouraging an 
economic and fair resolution of all or any part of the 
disputes presented in the matter.” Thus, pursuant to RCCH 
Rule 12.2, the circuit court’s action was appropriate. 
27
  
 
 
  Further, the circuit court’s order provided, “If 
Plaintiffs and Gentry are unable to agree, the Court shall 
select a local arbitra tion service for this matter.” This 
part of the order followed the Nishimuras’ counsel’s request to the circuit court: “If we cannot come to an 
agreement [about who we want to arbitrate this case], you 
select somebody.” Whether or not RCCH Rule 12.2 appl ied, 9 
U.S.C. § 5 provided authority for the circuit court to 
select an arbitrator in such a situation:  
 
 
  The ICA erred in requiring a party challenging an 
arbitrator-selection provision to show evidence of “actual 
bias.” In resolving a challenge to an arbitrator -selection 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
If in the agreement provision be made for a method of 
naming or appointing an arbitrator or arbitrators or an 
umpire, such method shall be followed; but if no method be 
provided therein, or if a method be provided and any party 
thereto shall fail to avail himself of such method, or if 
for any other reason there shall be a lapse in the naming 
of an arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire, or in filling a 
vacancy, then upon the application of either party to the 
controversy the court shall designate and appoint an 
arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire, as the case may 
require, who shall act under the said agreement with the 
same force and effect as if he or they h ad been 
specifically named therein; and unless otherwise provided in the agreement the arbitration shall be by a single 
arbitrator.  
 
Therefore, we affirm in toto the circuit court’s order granting 
in part and denying in part Gentry’s motion to compel arbitration, as well as its order denying Gentry’s motion for 
reconsideration of that order.

provision, we apply the “fundamental fairness” standard 
articulated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth 
Circuit. In the instant case, we conclude that the arbitrator-
selection provision is fundamentally unfair because it 
authorized one party’s agent to exercise its sole discretion in 
selecting an arbitration service to hear  a dispute between that 
party and the plaintiffs. We therefore vacate the ICA’s 
Judgment on Appeal, and affirm the circuit court’s “Order 
Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendant Gentry Homes, 
Ltd.’s Motion to Compel Arbitration Filed on August 29, 2012” 
and its “Order Denying Gentry Homes’ Motion for Reconsideration 
of the Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Gentry Homes, 
Ltd.’s Motion to Compel Arbitration [Filed August 29, 2012], 
Filed November 13, 2012.”
