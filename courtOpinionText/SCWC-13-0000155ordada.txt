JIMMY ROBINSON, JR.,
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant.
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(CAAP-13-0000155; CR. NO. 11-1-1014)
 
ORDER AFFIRMING JUDGMENT ON APPEAL
 
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Petitioner Jimmy Robinson, Jr. (Robinson) seeks review
 
of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ November 26, 2014 Judgment
 
on Appeal, entered pursuant to its October 31, 2014 Summary
 Disposition Order, which affirmed the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit’s November 28, 2012 Notice of Entry and Judgment. The
 Circuit Court adjudged Robinson guilty of Robbery in the First
 Degree, in violation of Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-840. 
We accepted Robinson’s application for writ of certiorari and now
 affirm the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal.
 On certiorari, Robinson contends that the ICA gravely
 
erred in holding that substantial evidence supporting the verdict
 
was adduced at trial because he did not have the intent to commit
 Robbery in the First Degree. This court has held that
 “‘[s]ubstantial evidence’ as to every essential element of the
 crime charged is credible evidence which is of sufficient quality
 and probative value to enable a man of reasonable caution to
 reach a conclusion.” State v. Naeole, 62 Haw. 563, 565, 617 P.2d
 
820, 823 (1980). The evidence adduced at trial in this case,
 including witness testimony and video evidence, was sufficient to
 enable a person of reasonable caution to conclude that Robinson
 had the requisite intent to commit Robbery in the First Degree.
 Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal 
is affirmed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, August 25, 2015.
