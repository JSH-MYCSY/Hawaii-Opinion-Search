RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, POLLACK, AND WILSON, JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J. 
This case presents the question of whether the phrase 
“residence, including yard and garage” in an injunction order 
encompasses the outer area of the protected person’s 1,000-acre property, far removed from the vicinity of the person’s home. 
We hold that it does not.

I. BACKGROUND 
A. The Injunction Order and the Alleged Violation 
John Varel owns, and lives with his wife on a one-
thousand-acre property in Waiheʻ e, Maui County.  On September 14, 
2009, the District Court of the Second Circuit (district court)1  
granted a petition for injunction against harassment (Injunction 
Order) filed by Varel, pursuant to Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 604-10.5(b) (Supp. 1999). The Injunction Order was directed 
against Evans Guyton, and it was effective for three years from 
the issuance date. The Injunction Order stated as follows: 
IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED THAT: 
1.	 The Petition is granted.
2.	 The Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order herein is
made absolute as of July 21, 2009
3.

Todd Arnold (Arnold), a private contractor farmer for 
Varel, also resides on Varel’s property. On February 19, 2012, 
at around 10:30 a.m., Arnold was hiking with his family on the 
ridges located on Varel’s property. As they reached the area 
toward the top of the ridges, Arnold observed Guyton dirt biking 
in the company of other riders. 
As a result of this incident, the State filed a 
complaint charging Guyton, pursuant to HRS § 604-10.5(h),3 with 
the offense of violation of a restraining order or injunction. 
Specifically, the complaint charged Guyton with “entering and/or 
visiting the premises including yard and garage of the 
residence, and/or place of employment” of Varel on February 19, 
2012.4 
3 HRS § 604- 10.5(h) states in relevant part as follows: 
A knowing or intentional violation of a restraining order
or injunction issued pursuant to this section is a
misdemeanor. 
4 The Complaint stated as follows: 
That on or about the 19th day of February, 2012, in the
Division of Wailuku, County of Maui, State of Hawaii, EVANS
NATHAN GUYTON did intentionally or knowingly violate a
restraining order or injunction, to wit, an Order Granting
Petition for Injunction Against Harassment, issued in DC­TRO 09-1- 0199, on September 14, 2009, by entering and/or 
visiting the premises including yard and garage of theresidence, and/or place of employment of the other, thereby
committing the offense of Violation of Restraining Order or
Injunction in violation of Section 605- 10.5 of Hawaii 
Revised Statutes. 
It should be noted that the charge in the complaint differs 
from the language stated in the Injunction Order, in that the word

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
B. Bench Trial 
A bench trial commenced on February 22, 2013. Varel 
described his 1,000-acre property as consisting of a commercial 
macadamia nut farm, conservation land, and his residence. In 
describing the expanse of his property, Varel testified that it 
“runs about a mile and a quarter parallel to the highway and 
then a mile and a quarter back all the way up to the watershed.” 
According to Varel, his “residence is off to the right end” of 
the 1,000-acre parcel. 
Varel testified that he did not give permission to 
anyone to use any portion of his property for dirt biking, that he and his wife had been living on the property, and that he 
sought and was awarded an injunction against Guyton in 2009. On 
the day of the incident, he was on the mainland for a business 
trip. 
Arnold testified that he was working as a private 
contractor farmer for Varel and that he was residing on Varel’s property. At around 10:30 a.m. on February 19, 2012, after 
three to four hours of hiking around the property, he came upon 
Guyton as he and his family reached the “ridge area of the 
property”--the “top ridges, not all the way, but up on the 
(.  .  .continued)
  
“premises” appears only in the complaint and not in the Injunction

Order.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
mountain side”--located on the outer limits of Varel’s property. 
According to Arnold, he recognized and was familiar with Guyton 
because Guyton is generally known in the dirt biking community, 
he had seen Guyton around town riding his truck and in areas 
where Guyton rides his bike, and because of an earlier 
encounter. 
On the day in question, Arnold indicated that one of 
the riders approached and told him that they had permission to 
ride on that portion of Varel’s property. Arnold controverted this claim, testifying that nobody ever had permission to ride 
dirt bikes on Varel’s property. Arnold acknowledged that in the 
vicinity of the area in which he observed the riders, there were 
no “no trespassing” signs, since such signs are located only on 
the front entrance of the property. 
When asked how he was certain that the riders and 
Guyton were on Varel’s property, Arnold answered, “Just being out there as long as I had, I know where the ridge lines are. . 
. . I know where [Varel] has pointed out to me.” Additionally, 
Arnold also stated that he had seen the map of Varel’s property 
and walked its boundary lines. 
Varel was recalled by the State, at which point he 
testified that the area where Arnold observed Guyton is about 
half a mile into his property from the boundary line between his 
property and the neighboring property. Varel also stated that 
5 
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
during the injunction hearing, Guyton was shown a blown-up map 
of his property indicating its perimeters, the area that it 
covered, and neighboring properties. According to Varel, the 
map indicated that the ridge where Arnold saw Guyton is part of 
his property. Varel also confirmed that there were no “no 
trespassing” signs in the area in which Guyton was seen. 
The defense called Ryan Stewart as a witness. Stewart 
testified that he had known and been acquainted with Guyton 
through the motocross community and because they had previously ridden dirt bikes together. According to Stewart, while he was 
watching a motocross race on February 19, 2012, he observed 
Guyton at the racetrack from between 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. 
until about 3:00 p.m. or 4:00 p.m. Stewart indicated that he 
did not see Guyton leave the racetrack, but he acknowledged that 
he saw Guyton only intermittently--about three to six times-­
that day. 
Guyton testified that he was a construction worker and 
lived on Maui for approximately thirty years before retiring about ten years earlier. Guyton stated that, on February 19, 
2012, he watched a motocross race at a location about five or 
six miles from Varel’s property. Guyton stated that he was at 
the race from around 8:30 a.m. until approximately 4:00 p.m. and 
then left to do some shopping. He denied ever going to Varel’s 
6 
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
property and testified that he had never “seen [Arnold] in [his] 
entire life.” 
Guyton recognized a copy of the Injunction Order. He 
indicated that he was shown a map of Varel’s property during the 
2009 injunction hearing, but he stated that the map did not 
specify the boundary lines of Varel’s property and that, in any 
event, he was unable to comprehend it. Guyton stated that he 
was not given a copy of the map that was presented during the 
injunction hearing. He further testifed that he was familiar with the portions of Varel’s property that are not enclosed by a 
fence, the area of which constitutes about 75% of Varel’s 
property. According to Guyton, the limited fencing around 
Varel’s property is located “over where [Varel] lives,” with the 
rest of the property having “no fence at all,” no “[n]o 
trespassing signs, no posted nothing.” Guyton stated that 
Varel’s property was previously owned by “Wailuku Ag” and was a recreation area in which dirt biking was allowed. Guyton 
acknowledged that he “know[s] now that it’s . . . Varel[’s 
property], and it’s off limits . . . from the [injunction 
hearing] three years ago. [He] know[s] that it’s his land, not 
to go on it.” 
In its closing argument, the State viewed the fact 
that Guyton was shown a blown-up zoning map of Varel’s property 
during the 2009 injunction hearing as constituting adequate 
7 
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
notice of the area in which he was prohibited from entering. 
The State also emphasized Guyton’s admission of his knowledge 
that he was not allowed to go on Varel’s property. 
During his closing argument, defense counsel contended 
that Guyton was not aware that he entered Varel’s property 
primarily because there were no “no trespassing” signs or fences 
in the vicinity of the area in which he was allegedly seen by 
Arnold. Further, defense counsel disputed the State’s claim 
that the map shown to Guyton during the injunction hearing was sufficient to inform Guyton of exactly where he was prohibited 
from being present, arguing that the immensity of Varel’s 
property made it impossible for Guyton to keep track of all of 
the property’s boundary lines. In addition, defense counsel 
argued that the Injunction Order did not clearly outline the 
location of the property’s boundary lines, making it impossible 
for Guyton to have had the necessary mental state required by the offense with which he was charged. Defense counsel also 
maintained that the entire 1,000 acres of Varel’s property 
should not be considered as constituting the “yard” of Guyton’s 
residence. 
After the closing arguments, the district court stated 
that it was having an issue with the term “yard” as used in the 
Injunction Order, so the State provided a dictionary definition 
of “yard” as “the grounds of a building or group of buildings; 
8 
 
 
 
   
 
                     
  
 
 
 
  
 
   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the grounds immediately surrounding a house; an area with its 
buildings and facilities set aside for a particular business or 
activity; an assembly or storage area as for drydocked boats.”5 
The State also responded to defense counsel’s arguments, urging the district court to hold that the entire 1,000-acre land 
surrounding Varel’s house “is his yard. The fact that his yard 
is bigger and some people have a small yard, there’s nothing 
prohibiting that.” 
C. Judgment 
At the conclusion of the trial, the district court 
found that Guyton violated the Injunction Order and imposed a 
fine of $500, which was stayed pending the outcome of Guyton’s 
appeal. Judgment was entered on February 22, 2013. Thereafter, 
the district court issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions 
of Law (FFCL) on April 1, 2013.
6 In relevant part, paragraphs 3 
and 4 of the FFCL indicated that the district court found Arnold 
and Varel to be credible witnesses.7 In paragraphs 5 and 6, the 
5 The State did not specify the dictionary from which it obtained
this definition. In his Opening Brief to the ICA, Guyton identifies the 
Merriam- Webster Dictionary as the source of the State’s definition, which the 
State confirmed in its Answering Brief. 
6 The district court did not clearly differentiate in the FFCL its
findings of fact from its conclusions of law, both of which were aggregatedunder one heading. 
7 Paragraph 3 referred to a “John Barel,” not Varel. However,
based on the Injunction Order and trial transcript, this appears to be atypographical error. 
9 
 
 
 
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
district court found Guyton and Stewart not to be credible 
witnesses. In addition, the district court concluded, in 
paragraph 7 of the FFCL, that “[t]he language of the [Injunction 
Order] is sufficiently broad to include in its prohibition[] the 
place of the property where” Arnold saw Guyton. 
II. APPELLATE PROCEEDINGS 
On March 19, 2013, Guyton filed a Notice of Appeal 
from the Judgment. In his Opening Brief, Guyton contended that the district court erred in adjudging him guilty of intentionally or knowingly entering or visiting Varel’s 
“residence, including yard and garage.” Specifically, Guyton 
argued that the most reasonable construction of the term “yard,” 
as used in the Injunction Order, should not encompass the entire 
1,000 acres of Varel’s property. Guyton contended that, because 
“yard” is clear and unambiguous and was not defined by the 
Injunction Order or statute, its plain, generally accepted meaning must control and such meaning does not contemplate the 
farm and conservation land within Varel’s property. 
Additionally, relying on the rule of lenity, Guyton 
argued that any ambiguity that the ICA might find in the term 
“yard” must be resolved in the light most favorable to him. 
Recognizing that the canons of statutory interpretation upon 
which he relied do not directly apply to the Injunction Order 
because it is not a statute, Guyton asserted that these canons 
10 
 
 
 
   
   
 
                     
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
are equally applicable because “the injunction assumed the role 
of a statute by having the same function as law.” 
Guyton also argued that the State failed to prove that 
he acted with the requisite state of mind, that he knowingly or 
intentionally visited or entered Varel’s property, since the 
precise location of its boundary lines was not known to him with 
certainty.8 
In its Answering Brief, the State responded that there 
was sufficient evidence at trial to support Guyton’s conviction. The State argued that Guyton’s actual understanding of the acts 
prohibited by the Injunction Order–-as could be gleaned from his 
testimony at trial that he was aware that Varel’s property was 
off limits to him–-undermined his claim that he should not be 
expected to understand the term “yard.” The State also asserted 
that even though the dictionary definition of “yard” that the 
State provided at trial was incomplete, the district court properly relied on it. Finally, the State contended that Guyton 
acted with the requisite mental state based on his testimony 
that he was very familiar with Varel’s property coupled with the 
fact that a map of Varel’s property was shown to Guyton during 
the 2009 injunction hearing. 
8 Guyton, however, conceded that his conduct might have been
reckless, a state of mind that falls short of what is required by the offense
with which he was charged. See HRS § 605- 20.6(h). 
11 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
                     
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
On Febuary 5, 2015, the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
(ICA) issued its Summary Disposition Order (SDO), which affirmed 
the Judgment. The ICA majority held that Guyton’s conviction 
was based on sufficient evidence, reasoning that the seventh 
paragraph9 of the district court’s FFCL 
is not wrong because (1) the District Court convicted
Guyton based on his conduct of entering or visiting . . .
Varel’s . . . ‘residence’; and (2) there is substantial
evidence showing Guyton (a) knew that ‘residence,’ as used
in the injunction, encompassed Varel’s entire property . .. and (b) knowingly entered or visited Varel’s property. 
The Honorable Katherine G. Leonard, in her dissent, 
concluded that “the State failed to establish that the area 
where Guyton was observed “was part of ‘the premises including 
yard and garage of the residence, and/or place of employment of 
[John Varel].’” 
In his Application for Writ of Certiorari, Guyton 
reasserts the arguments that he made before the ICA. 
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
The interpretation or construction of a judgment, 
decree, or order “presents a question of law for the courts.” 
Cain v. Cain,  59 Haw. 32, 39, 575 P.2d 468, 474 (1978). 
Questions of law are reviewed under the right/wrong standard of 
9 The seventh paragraph of the FFCL provides, “The language of the
[2009 Injunction] Order . . . is sufficiently broad to include in its
prohibition, the place on the property where the witness testified that he
saw Defendant on the day of the offense.” 
12 
 
 
 
   The standard of review in determining the sufficiency 
of the evidence is “not whether guilt is established beyond a 
reasonable doubt, but whether there is substantial evidence to 
support the conclusion of the trier of fact.” State v. 
Matavale,
 115 Hawaiʻ i 149, 157—58, 166 P.3d 322, 330–31 (2007); 
accord State v. Monteil, 134 Hawaiʻ i 361, 368, 341 P.3d 567, 574 
(2014). Substantial evidence as to every material element of 
the charged offense means “credible evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of 
reasonable caution to support a conclusion.” Monteil, 134 
Hawaiʻi at 368, 341 P.3d at 574 (quoting Matavale, 115 Hawaiʻ i at 
158, 166 P.3d at 331) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
review. State v. Higa, 79 Hawaiʻ i  1, 3, 897 P.2d 928, 930 
(1995). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
A. Overarching Principles 
The Injunction Order in this case prohibited Guyton 
from “[e]ntering or visiting [Varel’s] residence, including yard 
and garage.” The words “residence” and “yard” are not defined 
in the Injunction Order. 
The primary issue is the meaning of 
the phrase “residence, including yard” and whether it 
encompasses the area in which Arnold observed Guyton. 
In LeMay v. Leander,  92 Hawaiʻ i 614, 994 P.2d 546,  
(2000), this court held that to hold a party in civil contempt, 
13 

 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
“there must be a court decree that sets forth in specific detail 
an unequivocal command that the contemnor violated.” 92 Hawaiʻ i 
at 625, 994 P.2d at 557. While LeMay involved a civil contempt 
violation, its requirement of particularity and clarity in the 
language of an order applies with at least the same force to 
injunction orders prohibiting harassment, especially since the 
violation of such an injunction order exposes the defendant to a 
one-year jail sentence, see HRS §§ 604-10.5(h), 706-663 (1993)-­
a consequence of greater seriousness than that carried by a 
civil contempt citation. See Murray v. Murray, 60 Haw. 160, 
162, 587 P.2d 1220, 1222 (1978) (“The significant and essential 
characteristic of a sanction imposed for civil contempt is that 
the penalty can be avoided by compliance with the court 
order.”). 
Thus, a prerequisite to punishing a person for 
violating an injunction order issued under HRS § 604-10.5 that 
protects against harassment is a court order that is “clear and 
unambiguous,” LeMay, 92 Hawaiʻ i at 625, 994 P.2d at 557, so as to 
allow a person of ordinary intelligence to “ascertain from the 
four corners of the order precisely what acts are forbidden,” 
id. (quoting Dystar Corp. v. Canto, 1 F. Supp. 2d 48, 54 (D. 
Mass. 1997)) (internal quotation marks omitted). This requirement is no more than a rule of reason because, as it is 
for statutes, fairness and due process dictate that a court 
14 

 
 
 
   
                     
    
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
order must be sufficiently particular and definite so as to 
clearly identify the conduct that it prohibits. See United 
States v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 882 F.2d 656, 659 (2d Cir. 1989) (noting that criminal contempt sanctions may be 
levied only if predicated on a violation of “the specific and 
definite terms of a court order”); 
17 Am. Jur. 2d Contempt § 140 
(stating that a court order that could support a contempt sanction is one that describes, in “certain, clear, and definite 
terms[,] . . . the duties thereby imposed or the actions 
required or forbidden”); cf. State v. Xiao, 123 Hawaiʻ i 251, 261, 
231 P.3d 968, 978 (2010) (Acoba, J., concurring and dissenting) 
(reasoning that statutes must be construed in a manner as to 
clearly enunciate “what conduct is prohibited” so that 
individuals subject to them “may choose between lawful and 
unlawful conduct”).
10  
B. The plain meaning of the words “residence” and “yard” 
The phrase “residence, including yard” in the 
Injunction Order is clear and unambiguous on its face. 
As such, 
it leaves no room for interpretation, and its plain language 
must control. Shade v. Kirk , 420 N.W.2d 284, 286 (Neb. 1988) 
(“When the language of a . . . decree is plain and unambiguous, 
10 See also In re Doe, 96 Hawaiʻ i 73, 82, 26 P.3d 562, 571 (2001) 
(stating that before a minor could be held in criminal contempt of court, the
“terms and operation” of the underlying court order must be readily
understandable to the minor). 
15 
 
 
 
    
                     
  
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
there is no room for construction . . . .”); Callan v. Callan, 
468 P.2d 456, 458 (Wash. Ct. App. 1970) (accord); 50 C.J.S. 
Judgments
 §§ 744-45 (accord); see Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United 
Agri Products, 86 Hawaiʻ i 214, 259, 948 P.2d 1055, 1100 (1997) 
(according “plain meaning” to this court’s remand order in 
construing its scope). 
In effectuating its plain language, the words 
“residence, including yard” must “be taken in their ordinary and 
familiar signification, and regard is to be had to their general 
and popular use.” See In re Taxes of Johnson,  44 Haw. 519, 530, 
356 P.2d 1028, 1034 (1960) (quoting Advertiser Publ’g Co. v. 
Fase, 43 Haw. 154, 160 (Haw. Terr. 1960)); see Sierra Club v. 
Castle & Cooke Homes Haw., Inc.
, 132 Hawaiʻ i 184, 191—92, 320 
P.3d 849, 856—57 (2013) (noting that courts must “give words their ordinary meaning unless something in the statute requires a different interpretation” (quoting 
Saranillo v. Silva , 78 
Hawaiʻi 1, 10, 889 P.2d 685, 695 (1995)) (internal quotation mark 
omitted)); see also HRS § 1-14 (2009) (“The words of a law are 
generally to be understood in their most known and usual 
signification.”).11 
11 This court explained that looking to the common usage of words 
when they are clear and unambiguous reflects 
a rule of common sense, for it must be supposed that
the legislature, in enacting a statute, intended that
the words used therein should be understood in the

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
In conducting a plain meaning analysis, “this court 
may resort to legal or other well accepted dictionaries as one 
way to determine the ordinary meaning of certain terms not 
statutorily defined.” State v. Pali , 129 Hawaiʻ i 363, 370, 300 
P.3d 1022, 1029 (2013) (quoting State v. Kikuta, 125 Hawaiʻ i 78, 
96, 253 P.3d 639, 658 (2011)) (internal quotation marks 
omitted); see Travelocity.com, L.P. v. Dir. of Taxation,
 135 
Hawaiʻi 88, 106—07 , 346 P.3d 158, 175—76 (2015) (considering 
dictionary definitions in conducting a plain meaning analysis). 
The Oxford Dictionaries defines “residence” as “[a] 
person’s home; the place where someone lives.”12 “Yard” is 
defined by the Oxford Dictionaries as “[a] piece of ground 
(. . .continued)
sense in which they are ordinarily and popularly 
understood by the people, for whose guidance and
government the law was enacted, unless there is
something in the statute showing that the words in
question were used in some other sense.

adjoining a building or house” or “[a]n area of ground 
surrounded by walls or buildings.”13 
Based on its plain and generally known meaning, it is 
clear that the phrase “residence, including yard,” as it is used 
in the Injunction Order, is the house in which Varel lives and 
the adjacent area surrounding it.14    
13 Oxford Dictionaries,

(emphasis added) (last visited April 13, 2015) .  Yard may also refer to “[a]n
area of land used for a particular purpose or business,” e.g., a storage yard 
or a dump yard. Id. This variation of the definition of yard is not
applicable in this case. 
The Merriam- Webster Dictionary defines yard as “a small usually 
walled and often paved area open to the sky and adjacent to a building”; “the
grounds of a building or group of buildings”; or “the grounds immediately
surrounding a house that are usually covered with grass.” Merriam- Webster, 
http://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/yard (last visited Apr. 13, 2015).
At trial, the State defined “yard” for the district court as “the groundsimmediately surrounding a house” in accordance with the Merriam- Webster 
Dictionary. 
14   This result is the same regardless of whether the word
“including” is interpreted as a word of expansion or a word of limitation.
See  Hawaiian Ass’n of Seventh— Day Adventists, 130 Hawaiʻ i 36, 46, 305 P.3d
452, 462  (2013).  As previous cases from this court have recognized, 
“including” means either “an enlargement and has the meaning of and  or in 
addition to, or merely specifies a particular thing already included within
the general words theretofore used.”  Id.  (quoting Lealaimatafao v. Woodward—
Clyde Consultants, 75 Haw. 544, 556, 867 P.2d 220, 226 (1994))  (internal 
quotation marks omitted). If “including” were taken to mean as merely 
specifying “a particular thing already included within the general words
theretofore used,” the definition of residence--the house where Varel 
actually lives--would serve as the outer limit of what “yard” means, which 
would exclude the outer ridges of Varel’s property where Guyton was seen.  On 
the other hand, if “including,” in this context, were taken to mean “and orin addition to,” “yard” would be in addition to “residence”; however, theplain meaning of “yard” would nonetheless exclude the outer ridges of Varel’s
property in which Guyton was present.  
Additionally, under the “and or in addition to” definition of
“including,” “yard and garage” may be illustrative of other places that could
be added to “residence.” Id.   This latter interpretation is the most far-
reaching and would render the phrase “residence, including yard and garage”
ambiguous in that it could encompass unidentified or remote locations on an
expansive property. Faced with ambiguity in such an instance, the phrase

Accordingly, an interpretation that would place the 
entire 1,000 acres of Varel’s property within the ambit of the 
phrase “residence, including yard” would run contrary to its 
“ordinary and familiar signification,” and such application is 
therefore erroneous.   In re Taxes of Johnson, 44 Haw. at 530, 
356 P.2d at 1034.15  
C.	 The interpretation by the district court of the phrase
“residence, including yard” was incorrect. 
The district court and the ICA applied a strained and 
unnatural interpretation to the phrase “residence, including yard” instead of applying its plain meaning. Consequently, the 
words “residence, including yard” were interpreted to encompass 
even the ridges located at the outer limits of Varel’s 1¼­square-mile property, which could be accessed either by hiking 
from within the property or by motorcycle through the 
neighboring property. 
Rather than enforcing the clear and unambiguous 
language of the Injunction Order, the district court’s 
interpretation expanded the meaning of “residence, including 
yard” well beyond the ordinary and familiar signification of 
(.  .  .continued) 
“residence including yard” should be interpreted consistent with the known
and usual signification of these terms. See 
infra Part IV.B 
15 The State’s use of the word “premises” in its complaint against
Guyton--a word that does not appear in the Injunction Order, see  supra note 
4--
may be an implicit acknowledgement that the phrase “residence, including 
yard” does not encompass the area in which Arnold observed Guyton.

these words.16 The district court’s interpretation deviated 
from, rather than furthered, the requirement of specificity and 
clarity in court orders, particularly because the violation 
involved could carry criminal sanctions. See LeMay, 92 Hawaiʻ i 
at 625, 994 P.2d at 557. 
Because the phrase “residence, 
including yard” is clear, the duty of the district court was to 
enforce, and not to overextend, its plain meaning. See State v. 
Palama, 62 Haw. 159, 161—62, 612 P.2d 1168, 1170 (1980) (explaining that “when the language is plain and unmistakable, 
the court is bound by” it, leaving “no room for judicial 
construction”). 
Even if we were to assume that the phrase “residence, 
including yard” is ambiguous, the district court’s interpretation was erroneous under comparable principles of 
statutory interpretation used in resolving ambiguities within a 
statute. 
The first of such principles states that “[w]here the 
meaning of a word is unclear in one part of a statute but clear 
in another part, the clear meaning can be imparted to the 
unclear usage on the assumption that it means the same thing 
16 The preprinted, standard form used for the Injunction Order
provided a space for “[s]pecial conditions or modifications,” which would 
have allowed the district court to indicate that the entire 1, 000 acres of 
Varel’s property were intended to be within the scope of the Injunction
Order.

throughout the statute.” Kam v. Noh, 70 Haw. 321, 325, 770 P.2d 
414, 416 (1989). 
This means that, “[i]n the absence of an 
express intention to the contrary, words or phrases used in two 
or more sections of a statute are presumed to be used in the 
same sense throughout.” Id. at 325—26, 770 P.2d at 417 (quoting 
Gaspro, Ltd. v. Comm’n of Labor & Indus. Relations, 46 Haw. 164, 172, 377 P.2d 932, 936 (1962)) (internal quotation marks 
omitted). 
In this case, paragraph 3(a) of the Injunction Order 
restrained and enjoined Guyton from contacting, threatening, or physically harassing Varel “and 
any person(s) residing at 
[Varel’s] residence.” (Emphasis added). To reside at one place means “to live in a particular place” or “to exist or be 
present.”
17 The phrase “reside at” contemplates living, existing 
or being present in a specific and identifiable physical structure, as compared to the phrase “reside in,” which is used to refer to a general area or locality within which a person 
lives.

Thus, it is clear from the phrase “person(s) residing 
at [Varel’s] residence” that paragraph 3(a) specifically refers 
to “residence” as a structure in which one could reside, such 
that “[Varel’s] residence” could only mean the house where Varel 
actually lives in--and not the entire 1,000 acres of property 
within which his house is located. Under the rule elucidated by 
Kam, therefore, the meaning of “residence,” as it is used in the 
phrase “residence, including yard,” in paragraph 3(c) of the 
Injunction Order is the same as the meaning of “residence” in paragraph 3(a)-–the house in which Varel actually lives. 
Cf. 
Kam, 70 Haw. at 325—26, 770 P.2d at 417 (holding that the word 
“use” has the same meaning throughout the statute). 
In addition, “the instant case arises under the penal 
law, where the basic canons of statutory construction counsel in 
favor of a less expansive definition” according to the rule of 
lenity. State v. Bayly, 118 Hawaiʻ i 1, 15, 185 P.3d 186, 200 
(2008). This longstanding precept of statutory interpretation 
states that “[w]here a criminal statute is ambiguous . . . the 
statute must be strictly construed against the government and in 
favor of the accused.” State v. Shimabukuro
, 100 Hawaiʻ i 324, 
327, 60 P.3d 274, 277 (2002); see Staples v. United States,  511 
U.S.
 600, 619 n.17 (1994). The rule of lenity can be considered 
as a natural extension of the principle that the language of a 
court order must be sufficiently particularized, clear, and 
22 
 
 
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
unequivocal before its violation could be punished. See supra 
Part IV.A. 
If the court order is ambiguous and not readily 
understandable, its language should be construed in favor of the 
defendant. See State v. Sakamoto
, 101 Hawaiʻ i 409, 413 n.3, 70 
P.3d 635, 639 n.3 (2003) (stating that a criminal statute will 
not be interpreted expansively so as to increase the penalty 
“when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a 
guess as to what the legislature intended” (quoting Simpson v. 
United States, 435 U.S. 6, 15 (1978)) (internal quotation mark omitted) (alteration omitted)). In NBA Properties, Inc. v. Gold, 895 F.2d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 1990), for example, the court 
stated that ambiguities or omissions in a court order will be 
read in favor of the person charged with contempt. Hence, any 
ambiguity in the language of the Injunction Order must be 
resolved in favor of Guyton. See State v. Woodfall, 120 Hawaiʻ i 
387, 396, 206 P.3d 841, 850 (2009) (concluding that an ambiguous 
statute must be strictly construed against the government and in 
favor of the accused); State v. Aiwohi, 109 Hawaiʻ i 115, 129, 123 
P.3d 1210, 1224 (2005) (accord). 
Applying the rule of lenity, the meaning of the phrase 
“residence, including yard”--construed in favor of Guyton-­
should be the same as its plain and popularly understood 
meaning--i.e., the place in which Varel actually lives and its 
23 

 
 
 
   
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
immediate vicinity, and not inclusive of Varel’s entire 1,000­
acre property, particularly as to the remote area of the 
property in which Arnold observed Guyton. Thus, even if the 
phrase “residence, including yard” is considered to be 
ambiguous, the district court’s unduly expansive interpretation 
of the phrase was erroneous in light of the principles embodied 
by both Kam and the rule of lenity. 
D. The conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence 
Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to 
the State, State v. Kalaola
, 124 Hawaiʻ i 43, 49, 237 P.3d 1109, 
1115 (2010), and according appropriate deference to the district 
court’s credibility determinations, Monteil, 134 Hawaiʻ i at 368, 
341 P.3d at 574, the record demonstrates that Guyton was 
observed by Arnold on the outer limits of Varel’s 1,000-acre 
property. This area is outside of the meaning of “residence, including yard,” which, interpreted under its plain meaning or 
under principles of statutory construction, encompasses only the 
house where Varel lives and the area directly adjacent to it. 
See supra Part IV.A-C. Therefore, the conviction in this case 
was not supported by sufficient evidence and must be reversed.
