GALINA OGEONE, Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellant,
 
vs.
 
DENTIST W. RUTH YANG, Respondent/Defendant-Appellee.
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(CAAP-13-0000391; CIV. NO. 12-1-3278)
 
ORDER REJECTING PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI 
 
(
By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, McKenna, and Pollack, JJ.)
 
On August 28, 2013, petitioner/plaintiff-appellant
 
Galina Ogeone filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to review
 
the ICA’s June 28, 2013 order dismissing her appeal for lack of
 jurisdiction. The ICA dismissed the appeal for lack of
 jurisdiction upon the conclusion that the circuit court’s April
 5, 2013 “Order Granting Defendant Dentist W. Ruth Yang’s Motion
 to Set Aside Entry of Default of February 25, 2013 (Filed March
 19, 2013)” (“Order Setting Aside Default”) was not an order,
 judgment, or decree from which an appeal can be taken. The ICA
 correctly concluded that the Order Setting Aside Default is not
 an appealable order. More importantly, we note that the ICA 
lacked jurisdiction because the case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Hawai' i on the same day 
that the notice of appeal was filed and no remand order has been filed. See Mathewson v. Aloha Airlines, Inc., 82 Hawai' i 57, 70, 
919 P.2d 969, 982 (1996) (“[A]fter removal, a federal court acquires full and exclusive jurisdiction over the litigation.”). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for writ of
 
certiorari, filed on August 28, 2013, is rejected.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, October 10, 2013.
