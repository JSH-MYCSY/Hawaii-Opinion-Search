ELIAS A.M. PARKER,
  
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant.
  
 
(CAAP-13-0000410; CASE NO. 1DTA-11-04895) 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ., 
with Wilson, J., concurring separately, 
and Nakayama, J., dissenting, with whom Recktenwald, C.J., joins )
 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Elias A.M. Parker seeks 
review of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (“ICA”) September 
2, 2014 Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its May 28, 2014 
Summary Disposition Order, which affirmed the District Court of 
the First Circuit’s (“district court”) March 19, 2013 Judgment 
of Guilty Conviction and Sentence (“district court judgment”).1 
The district court found Parker guilty of Operating a Vehicle 
1 The Honorable Michael A. Marr presided.   
 
  After being arrested for OVUII, Parker was taken to 
3   the police station, where he was read an implied consent form.
Parker elected to take a breath test, which resulted in a breath 
alcohol content reading of 0.162 grams of alcohol per 210 liters

Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (“OVUII”), in violation of 
Hawai2   i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 291E -61(a)(3) (Supp. 2010).
We accepted Parker’s Application for Writ of Certiorari, and  we 
now vacate the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal and the district court 
judgment and remand the case to the district court for further  
proceedings.  
2 HRS § 291E- 61(a)(3) (Supp. 2010) provides in relevant part: 
A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under the 
influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or assumes 
actual physical control of a vehicle: . . . [w]ith .08 or more 
grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of breath. . . . 
3 The form read in relevant part: 
1. ___ 	 Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public way, 
street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of the State 
shall be deemed to have given consent to a test or tests for 
the purpose of determining alcohol concentration or drug 
content of the persons [sic] breath, blood or urine as applicable. 
2. ___ 	 You are not entitled to an attorney before you submit to 
any tests [sic] or tests to determine your alcohol and/or drug 
content. 
3. ___ 	 You may refuse to submit to a breath or blood test, or 
both for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration and/or blood or urine test, or both for the purpose of 
determining drug content, none shall be given [sic], except as 
provided in section 291E -21.  However, if you refuse to submit 
to a breath, blood, or urine test, you shall be subject to up 
to thirty days imprisonment and/or fine up to $1,000 or the 
sanctions of 291E -65, if applicable.  In addition, you shall 
also be subject to the procedures and sanctions under chapter 291E, part III.

of breath. Parker filed a motion to suppress the breath test 
results, arguing that he did not knowingly or voluntarily 
consent to breath or blood testing. The district court denied 
the motion. The ICA affirmed the district court ’s denial of 
this motion to suppress. On certiorari, Parker contends, inter alia, that he did not constitutionally consent to the breath 
test because “[t]elling someone that [he or she] must consent to 
a 4th Amendment search or face 30 days in jail simply is not 
consent under the 4th Amendment.” 
In State v. Won,  136 Hawaiʻ i 292, 312, 361 P.3d 1195, 
1215 (2015), we held that “coercion engendered by the Implied 
Consent Form runs afoul of the constitutional mandate that waiver of a constitutional right may only be the result of a 
free and unconstrained choice,” and, thus, a defendant’s 
decision to submit to testing after being read the implied 
consent form “is invalid as a waiver of his right not to be 
searched.” In accordance with State v. Won , the result of 
Parker’s breath test was the product of a warrantless search, and the ICA erred by concluding that the district court properly denied Parker’s motion to suppress the breath test result. 
Accordingly, Parker’s OVUII conviction cannot stand. 
IT IS 
HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s September 2, 2014 
Judgment on Appeal and the district court judgment are vacated, 
and the case is remanded to the district court for further
