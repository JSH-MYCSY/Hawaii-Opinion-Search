RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, POLLACK, AND WILSON, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J.
 
This case arises from the administration of two
 
irrevocable trusts established by Richard and Rachel Ishida: 
the
 
Ishida-Waiakamilo Legacy Trust (Waiakamilo Trust), and the
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Ishida-Winant Legacy Trust (Winant Trust) (collectively, “the
 
Trusts”). The Trusts name as beneficiaries the Ishidas’
 daughters Jeri S. Wilson (Jeri) and Juney M. Ishida (Juney), and
 their granddaughter Kauialohaokalani R. Wilson (Kaui), but they
 expressly exclude the Ishidas’ third daughter, Richardeen Kimura
 (Deenie). Six years after the creation of the Trusts, the
 Ishidas filed petitions in Probate Court of the First Circuit
 (probate court) requesting rescission of both Trusts. The
 Ishidas alleged that they never intended to make the Trusts
 irrevocable, and that Jeri had wrongfully transferred ownership
 of property from the Waiakamilo Trust to herself. Jeri and Juney
 opposed the petitions. 
The probate court found that the transfer of property
 
to Jeri had violated the terms of the Waiakamilo Trust, ordering
 the property returned to the Trust; it declined to rescind or
 reform the Trusts. The Ishidas appealed to the Intermediate
 Court of Appeals (ICA), which affirmed the probate court’s denial
 of their petitions. 
The Ishidas’ Application for Writ of Certiorari
 
presents two issues to this court: 1) whether that the probate
 court’s failure to return the Waiakamilo Trust property to the
 Ishidas was an abuse of discretion in light of alleged wrongdoing
 by Jeri, and 2) whether the ICA improperly discounted the
 evidentiary value of the Ishidas’ petitions, which were verified
 
2
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
pursuant to Hawai' i Probate Rules (HPR) Rule 5(a). 
First, we hold that the probate court did not err in
 
denying the Ishidas’ requested relief, as the matter was within
 
the court’s equitable discretion. Second, we affirm the ICA’s
 holding that the probate court was not required to accept the
 Ishidas’ petitions at face value, and in doing so we clarify the
 status of HPR Rule 5(a) statements in relation to other types of
 testimonial evidence. 
I. Background 
The Ishidas hired an attorney to draft documents
 
creating the Trusts, which they executed on June 27, 2006. The
 Ishidas settled each Trust with a single residential and/or
 commercial property. Jeri and Juney were named as trustee for
 the Waiakamilo Trust and Winant Trust, respectively. The
 Waiakamilo Trust designates Jeri as beneficiary, with full
 ownership of the Trust’s property passing to Jeri’s daughter Kaui
 upon Jeri’s death. The Winant Trust provides that its property
 will be distributed to Juney as beneficiary upon the death of the
 Ishidas, with full ownership passing to Kaui upon Juney’s death. 
The Trusts are irrevocable, with both including the following
 provision:
 
Section 3. Irrevocable Trust
 
Our T
rust is irrevocable.  Except as expressly herein
provided to the contrary, no Trustor or any other
person shall have any right or power to alter, amend,
or in any manner whatsoever modify any of the
provisions hereof.
 
3
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Additionally, both the Waiakamilo Trust and the Winant
 
Trust specifically exclude the Ishidas’ third daughter, Deenie,
 
with both Trusts including the following provision: 
c. Exclusions
 
We hereby exclude RICHARDEEN R. KIMURA and such
person’s descendants as beneficiaries under our Trust
Agreement, including without limitation for the
purposes of intestate succession.  For the purposes of
our Trust Agreement, all excluded persons shall be
treated as having died prior to the execution of our
Trust Agreement.
 
On March 28, 2007, Jeri and the Ishidas executed a
 
series of deeds, transferring ownership of the Waiakamilo Trust
 
property (Waiakamilo Property) from the trust to Jeri personally. 
On May 4, 2012, the Ishidas filed in probate court a
 
Petition for Rescission of Warranty Deed, Imposition of
 Constructive Trust and an Order for Disgorgement related to the
 Waiakamilo Trust (Waiakamilo Petition), and a Petition for
 Reformation of Trust and/or Order Setting Aside the Ishida-Winant
 Trust (Winant Petition). The Ishidas alleged that, although they
 had asked their attorney to make simple wills and revocable
 trusts as part of their estate planning, their attorney went
 against their wishes and designed the Waiakamilo and Winant
 Trusts to be irrevocable. The Ishidas further claimed that Jeri
 had schemed with their attorney to transfer the Waiakamilo
 Property to Jeri personally in the March 28, 2007 deeds. 
Accordingly, the Ishidas asked the probate court to rescind the
 
4
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
deed transferring the Waiakamilo Property to Jeri, and to set
 
aside both Trusts and restore ownership of Trust properties to
 the Ishidas. In apparent compliance with HPR Rule 5(a),
1
 both
petitions included the following text above the Ishidas’
 signatures:
 
THE UNDERSIGNED UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS DOCUMENT IS
 
DEEMED TO INCLUDE AN OATH, AFFIRMATION, OR STATEMENT
TO THE EFFECT THAT ITS REPRESENTATIONS ARE TRUE AS FAR
 AS THE UNDERSIGNED KNOWS OR IS INFORMED, AND PENALTIES
FOR PERJURY MAY FOLLOW DELIBERATE FALSIFICATION.
 
Jeri and Juney (Respondents) disputed the Ishidas’
 
account of the Trusts’ creation, claiming that the Ishidas
 
intentionally made the trusts irrevocable because they had
 disinherited Deenie. Respondents further contended that Deenie

Rule 5. SIGNING OF PLEADINGS.
 
(a) Verification of Pleadings; Affidavits. All
pleadings (other than those signed by a party’s
attorney) shall include a statement at the end and
before the signature of the person presenting the
pleading to the effect that the person understands
that the document is deemed to include an oath,
affirmation, or statement to the effect that its
representations are true as far as the person
executing or filing it knows or is informed, and that
penalties for perjury may follow deliberate
falsification.  Such a statement shall be accepted in

 pleading.  The signature of an applicant in informal
proceedings shall be notarized.

it shall be supported by affidavit, signed by the
person having knowledge of the facts and competent to

of an affidavit to support facts outside of the
record.

     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
had recently reconciled with their parents, and that she was
 
behind the petitions. Respondents also alleged that the transfer
 of property from the Waiakamilo Trust to Jeri personally had been
 done with the Ishidas’ knowledge in order to avoid “issues”
 raised by the Ishidas’ accountant. Respondents concluded that
 “further discovery into the Ishidas’ allegations is required as
 they raise issues of material fact,” asking that both petitions
 be assigned to the civil trials calendar pursuant to HPR Rule
 20(a).
2
 
The Ishidas replied to Respondents’ objections,
 
asserting, “[w]hile the allegations against Deenie are absolutely
 untrue, they are irrelevant and the Ishidas will not address
 them.” The Ishidas urged the probate court to grant their
 petitions forthwith, arguing that “the equities of the case, as
 well as public policy” required immediate relief. The Ishidas
 opposed discovery or otherwise prolonging the proceedings in
 court, asserting that “the Court has all the information it needs
 to declare the transfer void and return the [Trust properties] to
 [their] rightful owners, the Ishidas.” 
After a hearing, the probate court issued an order
 
rescinding the March 28, 2007 deeds and restoring the Waiakamilo

 HPR Rule 20(a) (1995) provides: 
(a) Assignment.  The court by written order may retain
a contested matter on the regular probate calendar or
may assign the contested matter to the civil trials

6
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Property to the Waiakamilo Trust, finding that the transfer had
 
violated the terms of the Waiakamilo Trust. However, the probate
 court denied all other relief requested. The Ishidas filed
 petitions for reconsideration of the orders, which the probate
 court denied, and final judgment was entered for both petitions
 on May 2, 2013. 
The Ishidas appealed to the ICA, arguing that the
 
probate court erred in 1) failing to “right the injustice done to
 the Ishidas” by refusing to set aside the Trusts and restore the
 Properties to the Ishidas, and 2) failing to reform the Trusts
 because they “were a mistake.” Accordingly, the Ishidas urged
 the ICA to reform or set aside the Waiakamilo and Winant Trusts,
 or in the alternative, to impose constructive trusts on the
 Waiakamilo and Winant Trust properties. 
In a published opinion, the ICA examined each of the 
Ishidas’ arguments in turn, finding that the Ishidas had failed to show by clear and convincing evidence circumstances warranting the reformation of the Trusts or other equitable relief. In re 
Ishida Waiakamilo Legacy Trust, 138 Hawai' i 98, 103–09, 377 P.3d 
39, 44–50 (App. 2016). Regarding the evidence presented by the Ishidas, ICA stated: 
On appeal, the Ishidas refer to “compelling evidence”
and “the clear testimony of the Settlors regarding
their own intent and the mistake that was made,” in
apparent reference to the Ishidas’ signatures on the
Waiakamilo Petition following a statement that:
 
7
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
THE UNDERSIGNED UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS DOCUMENT
 
IS DEEMED TO INCLUDE AN OATH, AFFIRMATION, OR
STATEMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT REPRESENTATIONS ARE
 TRUE AS FAR AS THE UNDERSIGNED KNOWS OR IS
 INFORMED, AND PENALTIES FOR PERJURY MAY FOLLOW
DELIBERATED FALSIFICATION. 
. . . .
 
As set forth in HPR Rule 5(a), this attestation is
accepted in lieu of a sworn affidavit to the sameeffect, i.e., that the information contained thereinis true as far as the affiant knows or is informed ,
and thus satisfied the requirements of the rule. It isnot, however, identical in every way to testimony thathas been subject to cross-examination, or a swornaffidavit, or a declaration made under penalty of law,that specified factual statements are true andcorrect. It is within the province of the trial courtto determine the credibility of a witness and theweight to be given to a witness’s testimony.See, e.g., Tamashiro v. Control Specialist, Inc., 97
Hawai'i 86, 92, 34 P.3d 16, 22 (2001).  Written 
testimony that could be based upon limited memory orknowledge, or information and belief, rather thanpersonal knowledge, particularly testimony thatpurports to reflect the joint recollection and intentof two people, without distinction, might reasonablybe viewed as less reliable or less convincing thanother forms of evidence. 
Id. at 106–07, 377 P.3d at 47–48.
 
The ICA also determined that the creation of the
 
irrevocable trusts was not “so inherently improvident and
 
unreasonable” that the probate court was required to infer that
 it was the product of delusion or mental infirmity. Id. at 109,
 
377 P.3d at 50 (citing 
Love v. Love , 17 Haw. 206, 215 (1905)). 
Accordingly, the ICA concluded that the probate court did not
 abuse its discretion when it declined to impose a constructive
 trust on the Trust properties or otherwise return them to the
 
8
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Ishidas. Id. The ICA thus affirmed the probate court’s
 
judgments. Id. 
II. Standards of Review
 
A. Equitable Relief 
“The relief granted by a court in equity is 
discretionary and will not be overturned on review unless the 
circuit court abused its discretion by issuing a decision that clearly exceeds the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of the appellant.” Aickin v. Ocean View Invs. Co., Inc., 84 Hawai' i 
447, 453, 935 P.2d 992, 998 (1997) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted). B. Interpretation of Court Rules
 
The interpretation of a court rule is reviewed de novo. 
Sierra Club v. Dep’t of Transp., 120 Hawai' i 181, 197, 202 P.3d 
1226, 1242 (2009). 
III. Discussion
 
In their Application for Writ of Certiorari, the
 
Ishidas argue that the ICA erred in 1) holding that the probate
 court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to impose a
 constructive trust on the Waiakamilo Property or otherwise return
 it to the Ishidas; and 2) concluding that the Ishidas’ statements
 in their petitions were “less reliable and less convincing,” even
 though those statements were verified pursuant to HPR Rule 5(a).
 
9
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
A. Denial of Equitable Relief 
The ICA did not err in finding that the Ishidas failed
 
to produce clear and convincing evidence that the Trusts were the
 
result of mistake or other grounds justifying equitable relief. 
“A constructive trust arises where a person holding 
title to property is subject to an equitable duty to convey it to another on the ground that he would be unjustly enriched if he were permitted to retain it.” Kam Oi Lee v. Fong Wong, 57 Haw. 
137, 139, 552 P.2d 635, 637 (1976) (citation omitted). Hawai' i 
courts will impose a constructive trust “where the evidence is clear and convincing” that the grantee will be unjustly enriched if allowed to retain the entire property. Maria v. Freitas, 73 
Haw. 266, 274, 832 P.2d 259, 264 (citation omitted). The Restatement (Third) of Property explains the rationale for this high standard: 
When a donative document is unambiguous, evidence
suggesting that the terms of the document vary from
intention is inherently suspect but possibly
correct. . . .  Only high-safeguard allowance of
extrinsic evidence achieves the primary objective of
giving effect to the donor’s intention. 
Restatement (Third) of Property § 12.1 cmt. b (Am. Law Inst.
 
2003) (emphasis added).
 
Here, the Waiakamilo Trust is unambiguous, stating in
 
bold type that it is an irrevocable trust. The Ishidas thus had
 to offer clear and convincing evidence that Jeri would be
 unjustly enriched if the Waiakamilo Trust remained unaltered. 
10
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
They failed to do so. The Waiakamilo Petition made a colorable 
argument that the Ishidas did not intend to make the Waiakamilo Trust irrevocable, but Respondents made an equally plausible argument that the Ishidas simply changed their minds regarding the Trusts as a result of their alleged reconciliation with Deenie. Moreover, the Ishidas provided little evidence to support their arguments beyond the bare assertions in the Waiakamilo Petition, and they opposed discovery or assignment of their case to the civil trials calendar–-steps which might have allowed them to adduce additional evidence in support of their position. Faced with two competing stories and scant evidence, it was well within the probate court’s discretion to deny equitable relief. See, e.g., Aickin 84 Hawai' i at 449 n.1, 935 
P.2d at 994 n.1 (“Equity is a discretionary remedy; the trial court was not obligated to grant it.”). Thus, the ICA did not err in affirming the probate court’s denial of the Ishidas’ request to impose a constructive trust upon the Waiakamilo Property. B. Verification
 
The Ishidas argue that the ICA erred “because it should
 
have treated the Ishidas’ account of their intent and experiences
 as personal, and thus constituted personal knowledge.” In
 support of this contention, the Ishidas cite HPR Rule 5(a),
 arguing that pursuant to this rule their petitions “had the
 
11
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
effect of an affidavit.” The Ishidas also assert that the ICA
 
displayed “uncritical reliance” on similarly verified statements
 from Respondents’ briefs, arguing that there is “no principled
 reason to treat the Ishidas’ and Jeri/Juney’s Rule 5(a)
 statements differently, as the ICA did.”
3 Lastly, the Ishidas
 
argue that the ICA’s position “will undermine the Rule 5(a)
 verification” routinely relied upon in probate filings. 
We agree with the Ishidas’ argument to the extent that
 
a portion of the ICA’s opinion does have the potential to
 “undermine Rule 5(a) verification.” 
Referring to the
 
verification language in the Ishidas’ petitions,4
 the ICA stated: 
It is not, however, identical in every way to
testimony that has been subject to cross-examination,
or a sworn affidavit, or a declaration made under
penalty of law, that specified factual statements are
true and correct .
 
In re Ishida Waiakamilo Legacy Trust, 138 Hawai' i at 107, 377 
P.3d at 48 (emphasis in original). 
To the extent that this sentence suggests that a 
statement verified pursuant to HPR Rule 5(a) has less evidentiary 
3 Although the ICA refers to claims made in Respondents’ verified 
statements, it does not make findings regarding the veracity of these claims.
See, e.g., In re Ishida Waiakamilo Legacy Trust, 138 Hawai 'i at 108, 377 P.3d 
at 49 (“in her objection, Jeri averred that . . . .”)  
4
 As noted above, the following text based on HPR Rule 5(a) is
 
printed above the signature block on the Waiakamilo and Winant Petitions:  
THE UNDERSIGNED UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS DOCUMENT IS
 DEEMED TO INCLUDE AN OATH, AFFIRMATION, OR STATEMENT
TO THE EFFECT THAT ITS REPRESENTATIONS ARE TRUE AS FAR
 AS THE UNDERSIGNED KNOWS OR IS INFORMED, AND PENALTIES
FOR PERJURY MAY FOLLOW DELIBERATE FALSIFICATION.
 
12
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
weight than a sworn affidavit, it is in error. HPR Rule 5(a)
 
provides that a verified statement “shall be accepted in lieu of
 an affidavit as to the facts stated in the document.”
5 A court
 
must thus accord a statement verified pursuant to HPR 5(a) the
 same evidentiary weight it would a sworn affidavit of identical
 content.
 
However, on the whole the ICA’s analysis is correct in
 
its affirmance of the probate court’s judgments. The ICA did not
 display “uncritical reliance” on Jeri and Juney’s verified
 petitions, but rather reviewed the record in accordance with the
 relevant standard. As stated in the ICA’s opinion: 
We consider the Ishidas’ verification in the context
 
of the clear and convincing evidence standard
applicable to their request for equitable relief from
the unambiguous terms of the Waiakamilo Trust.
 
In re Ishida Waiakamilo Legacy Trust, 138 Hawai' i at 107, 377 
P.3d at 48. 
The ICA correctly noted that “it is within the province
 
of the trial court to determine the credibility of a witness and
 
the weight to be given to a witness’s testimony.” Id. Whether
 
or not the Ishidas’ statements in their petitions constituted
 
5
 As noted by the commentary to HPR Rule 5: 
Because the Registrar processes a large number of
informal applications filed by pro se applicants, it
is important to provide an easy mechanism for the
Registrar to determine that the applicant is who he or
she claims to be.  A notarized signature gives the
Registrar this proof without adding any significant
cost to the probate process.
 
13
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
clear and convincing evidence was a question clearly within the
 
probate court’s discretion. The ICA carefully considered the
 record, and it correctly concluded that the probate court did not
 abuse its discretion in declining to impose a constructive trust
 or other otherwise modify the Trusts in light of the evidentiary
 burden the Ishidas were required to satisfy. 
IV. Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, the ICA did not err in
 
affirming the probate court’s judgment. Thus, the ICA’s
 September 6, 2016 judgment on appeal is affirmed.
