 ORDER ACCEPTING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
 
  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
The application for writ of certiorari filed by 
Petitioners/Defendants/Appellees/Cross-Appellants, Sato and 
Associates, Inc. and Daniel S. Miyasato, on August 7, 2015, is hereby accepted and will be scheduled for oral argument.  The parties will be notified by the appellate clerk regarding scheduling. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that each of the parties listed 
below shall file a supplemental brief by October 5, 2015, not to exceed ten pages in length, addressing the following two issues: 
(1) Is the duty to defend presented in Sato’s non -
insurance, construction contract with KIC coextensive with 
Sato’s duty to indemnify? 
(2) Given case law and legislative history, does Hawaii 
Revised S tatutes § 431:10- 222 (2005), render void any 
provision in a construction contract requiring the promisor 
to defend “the promisee against liability for bodily injury 
to persons or damage to property caused by or resulting from the sole negligence or wilful misconduct of the 
promisee, the promisee’s agents or employees, or 
indemnitee?” 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai i, September 18, 2015.
