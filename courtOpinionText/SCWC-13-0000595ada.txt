OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J. 
 
 This case concerns a long -running landlord -tenant 
dispute involving the eviction of a tenant from a landlord’ s 
condominium.  The district court  issued a writ of possession to 
the landlord in 2008, which was then executed against the 
tenant.  Having been evicted, the tenant appealed to the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) on various grounds.  In an 
unpublished decision, t he ICA vacated the district court’s 
ruling in part and remanded .  Ryan v. Herzog , 126 Hawaiʻi 25, 265 Electronically Filed

 P.3d 494 (2011).  The distric t court’s decision  on remand, in 
turn, was appealed by the tenant to the ICA, which affirmed the 
district court except as to an award of attorney fees to the 
landlord, which the ICA reversed.  Ryan v. Herzog , 136 Hawai
ʻi 
374, 362 P.3d 807 (2015).  We accepted the tenant’s application 
for a writ of certiorari.   
   On certiorari John Herzog,  the tenant,  pro se, 
raises essentially one issue.  He contends that in the second 
appeal the ICA failed to adequately address the d istrict court’s 
denial of what Herzog calls his “implicit counterclaim” for 
retaliatory eviction.  We agree.   
 Although it addressed other issues raised by the 
parties, the ICA on the second appeal did not determine whether 
Herzog properly raised a counterclaim of retaliatory eviction in 
his original answer.   We hold that Herzog did properly raise 
such a counterclaim in his answer, even though it was not 
denominated as such.  Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the 
ICA and the district court, and remand to the district court 
with instructions to allow Herzog to proceed on the counterclaim 
in his original answer and to allow the landlord to assert any 
relevant defenses.    
I.  Background 
  This appeal stems from a landlord -tenant dispute 
arising in February 2008 between John Herzog (Herzog, or the _***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_

 Tenant) and Ruth Ryan ( Ryan, or the Landlord).  Herzog had been 
a month-to- month tenant residing under an oral agreement at 
Ryan’s condominium  on Maui from June 2007 through the beginning 
of May 2008.  In early 2008, Ryan and Herzog  apparently began to 
have disagreements regarding cleaning and upkeep of the 
condominium.  In February 2008, Herzog emailed Ryan alleging 
that she had engaged in violations of the Residential Landlord -
Tenant Code, Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes (HRS)  chapter 521  (2006).  
Specifically, he alleged that she had abused her right as 
Landlord to access the apartment in order to harass him,1 failed 
to provide two days ’ notice of her intent to enter the 
apartment,2 and obligated him to comply with substantial 
modifications to the rental agreement without his written 
consent.3  Ryan subsequently served on Herzog a 45 -day notice to 
                                                           
 1  Abuse of access is prohibited by HRS § 521- 53(b)(2006), which  
provides that “[t]he landlord shall not abuse this right of access nor use it 
to harass the tenant.”     
 
 2  Failure to provide notice of intent to enter an apartment 
violates HRS § 521- 53(b), which provides that “[e] xcept in case of emergency  
or where impracticable to do so, the landlord shall give the tenant at least 
two days notice of the landlord ’s intent to enter and shall enter only during 
reasonable hours.”  
 
 3  Requiring a tenant to comply with substantial modifications 
to the rental agreement without written consent is prohibited by HRS 
§ 521-52 (2006).  HRS § 521 -52 provides in relevant part:   
(a) The tenant shall comply with all obligations or 
restrictions, whether denominated by the landlord as rules, 
or otherwise, concerning the tenant ’s use, occupancy, and 
maintenance of the tenant’ s dwelling unit, appurtenances 
thereto, and the premises of which the dwelling unit is a 
part, if:  . . . (2) Such obligations or restrictions, if 
not so known by the tenant at the time of the tenant ’s

 vacate on March 4, 2008.   See HRS § 521 -71(a)(“When the tenancy 
is month-to- month, the landlord may terminate the rental 
agreement by notifying the tenant, in writing, at least forty -
five days in advance of the anticipat ed termination.”) .  Herzog 
continued to tender the usual rent to Ryan through April.   See 
HRS § 521-74(a). 
A.  District Court Proceedings 
  
 The Landlord filed a complaint for summary possession 
against the Tenant on April 21, 2008.4  Acting pro se, the Tenant 
filed his answer, which was pa rt of the same document as hi s 
motion to dismiss,5 on April 30, 2008, alleging that the 
Landlord’s notice to vacate and complaint for summary possession 
were retaliatory and thus barred under HRS § 521- 74(a).6  In his 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
entry into the rental agreement, are brought to the 
attention of the tenant and, if they work a substantial 
modification of the tenant’s bargain under the rental 
agreement, are consented to in writing by the tenant.  
 
 4 Because legal rights and duties in landlord- tenant law are role -
based, it will be convenient to refer to the parties from now on  mainly by 
reference to their legal roles rather than their surnames.   
  
 5 The Tenant filed a  document titled “Answer to Complaint & Motion 
to Dismiss.”   
  
 6 HRS § 521 -74 provides in relevant part:  
 
(a) Notwithstanding that the tenant has no written rental 
agreement or that it has expired, so long as the tenant 
continues to tender the usual rent to the landlord or 
proceeds to tender receipts for rent lawfully withheld, no 
action or proceeding to recover possession of the dwelling 
unit may be maintained against the tenant, nor shall the 
landlord otherwise cause the tenant to quit the dwelling 
unit involuntarily, nor demand an increase in rent from the 
tenant; nor decrease the services to which the tenant has

 answer, the Tenant requested that the Landlord’s c omplaint be 
dismissed based on the L andlord’s acts of retaliatory eviction : 
24. Defendant has been subjected to multiple instances that 
constitute violations of the Landlord Tenant Act [sic] and 
therefore the Complaint attempts to evict Defendant in 
violation of HRS 521 -74 Retaliatory Eviction for 
complaining regarding his rights under HRS 521 et. seq., 
harassment by Landlord, and Landlord ’s repeated demand that 
Defendant spend additional monies over and above the 
monthly rental rate, an actual rent increase without proper  
notification.  
 
25. If the Court does not uphold Defendant ’s request for 
dismissal for failure to notify, Defendant requests that 
the Court rule that the current actions of providing notice 
to vacate and all future actions within a reasonable period 
of time represents  [sic] a retaliatory eviction and is 
contrary to HRS 521 -74 and the Complaint should be 
dismissed with Prejudice.  
 
The district court struck 
the Tenant’s answer on  May 2, 2008 for 
failure to timely serve the Landlord’s  counsel with a copy of 
his answer.7  The court ordered j udgment of  possession and issued 
a writ of possession on May 6, 2008.   The writ of possession was 
executed against the Tenant the same day, evicting the Tenant  
from the Landlord’s condominium.   
  The Tenant filed a motion for reconsideration or new 
trial on May 19, 2008.   The district court dismissed the 
Tenant’s motion bec ause the court found that the T enant 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
been entitled, after: (1) The tenant has complained in good 
faith to the department of health,  landlord, building 
department, office of consumer protection, or any other 
governmental agency concerned with landlord- tenant disputes 
of condit ions in or affecting the tenant’ s dwelling unit 
which constitutes [sic] a violation  of a health law or 
regulation or  of any provision of this chapter [.]

 demonstrated no basis to reconsider based on District Court 
Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 60.8  In particular, the 
court stated that the T enant did not demonstrate that the 
judgment of possession and w rit of possession should be 
reconsidered due to “mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect, 
newly discovered evidence, [or] fraud.”    
 Following the oral dismissal of the T enant’s motion, 
but during the same hearing on the motion for reconsideration or 
new trial, the Tenant raised a new issue: whether  his answer 
contained a cognizable counterclaim.   The Tenant did not 
properly caption the putative  counterclaim as a “counterclaim” 
in his original April 30, 2008 answer.   Nonetheless, on page two 
of that answer, the T enant had explicitly referred to a section 
“presented below,” titled “Retaliatory Eviction,” bolded and 
underscored.  That section was comprised of 26 numbered 
paragraphs.  In addition, a
t the hearing on his motion for 
                                                           
 8 DCRCP Rule 60 provides that the court may relieve a party “from a 
final judgment, order, or proceeding”  for: 
 
(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; 
(2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could 
not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial 
under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated 
intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other 
misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; 
(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or 
discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has 
been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer 
equitable that the judgment should have prospective 
application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from 
the operation of the judgment.   
 
DCRCP Rule 60(b)( 2006). _***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_

 reconsideration or new trial, the Tenant asserted that the 
following statement in his answer constituted a counterclaim:  
“Defendant requests lost wages for having to address plaintiff’s 
action of retaliatory eviction, the filing of the complaint, the 
answering of the complaint by filing of this [answer and motion 
to dismiss] and appearing at [the hearing on L andlord’s 
complaint].”  The court explained to the Tenant that a request, 
such as the one asserted by the 
Tenant, is not a counterclaim.   
The court then informed the Tenant, “ if you feel that you need 
to file a counterclaim, you can follow the rules in doing so.  
All right?”  The Tenant, appearing pro se, apparently 
interpreted the court’s words as an oral grant of leave to file 
a counterclaim, and further relying on the minutes 
from the 
motion hearing,9 proceeded to file a counterclaim on July 22, 
2008.  The Landlord filed a motion to strike the Tenant’s 
counterclaim on August 6, 2008.   
 The district court orally dismissed the T enant’s 
counterclaim on August 22, 2008 for failure to request leave to 
amend the counterclaim and for failure to request a hearing on 
the matter.  The order granting the Landlord’s motion to strike 
the T
enant’s counterclaim was filed on September 4, 2008.   
                                                           
 9 The minutes from the hearing state : “DEFENDANT STATES THAT HE HAS 
FILED A COUNTERCLAIM AFTER REVIEW OF COURT RECORDS CRT [sic] FINDS THAT NO 
COUNTER CLAIM WAS FILED AND IF DEFT [sic] WANTS TO FILE A COUNTER CLAIM MAY 
DO SO.” 
 _***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_

  The Tenant subsequently filed a non- hearing motion for 
leave to amend or in the alternative to file a counterclaim on 
November 5, 2008.  The district court on November 10, 2008, 
denied the motion for filing without a hearing and for failure 
to notify the Landlord.  
B.  First Appeal 
 On November 14, 2011, the T enant appealed the district 
court’s summary possession decision in favor of the Landlord to 
the ICA.   The Tenant argued the district court erred when it 
struck the Tenant’s answer.  The Tenant also argued that his 
answer contained a request for damages that should be considered 
a counterclaim.   
In the first appeal, the ICA held that the T enant’s 
answer was properly and timely served on the Landlord’s  counsel 
in the district court proceedings and consequently held that the 
district court’s May 2, 2008 oral order to strike the Tenant’s 
answer was error .  The ICA vacated the oral order striking the 
Tenant’s answer and remanded for further proceedings.  Because 
the Tenant’s month-to-month tenancy expired when he 
involuntarily vacated the apartment, the ICA dismissed as moot 
any additional challenges to the May 6, 2008 j udgment of  
possession and writ of possession.  _***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_

 C.  Trial Proceedings on Remand from First Appeal 
  
 On remand, the district court held a hearing and 
listed the subject of the hearing as “‘Defendant’s  [Tenant’s] 
Motion to Dismiss’ and ‘ Counterclaim. ’”10  The district court 
acknowledged that the ICA had vacated the district court’s 
previous order striking the Tenant’s answer to the Landlord’s 
complaint as untimely.  Therefore, the district court ruled that 
the Tenant had properly filed his answer on April 30, 2008. 
However, the district court construed the ICA’s opinion to state 
that any challenges to the writ of possession and judgment were 
moot at this point.  As a consequence, the district court 
concluded “that aside from the Court’s acknowledging that the 
defendant has filed an answer and properly filed his answer on 
April 30, 2008, there’s no further action  that needs to be taken 
with regard to the answer.”   The district court then solicited 
comments from the T enant.    
 The Tenant, appearing pro se, drew the court’s 
attention to the fact that he had filed a motion for leave of 
court to amend the implicit counterclaim contained in his answer 
of April 30, 2008 or, in the alternative, to file a 
counterclaim.  In response, the Landlord’s attorney asserte d 
that since the issue of possession is moot, “no further action 
                                                           
 10 The Honorable Blaine Kobayashi presided.   _***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
10 
 is required . . . regardless of what affirmative defenses might 
have been asserted,” a position with w hich the district court 
agreed.  The district court then ruled that the T enant’s answer, 
which contained a motion to dismiss (and also what the T enant 
now describes as an “implicit  counterclaim ” for retaliatory 
eviction) “is essentially moot,” and the court therefore denied 
that motion. 
 The district court then addressed the Tenant’s motion 
for leave of court to amend the counterclaim or in the 
alternative file a counterclaim.  The court denied the T enant’s 
motion for leave to amend his counterclaim or in the alternative 
to file a counterclaim.  The court concluded that because the 
Tenant’s counterclaim was stricken in the original action, on 
September 4, 2008, 
and because the Tenant was denied leave to 
amend his counterclaim in the original action, on November 10, 
2008, “there was no counterclaim.”   The court  then concluded 
that “no further actio n” needed to be taken in regard  to the 
answer.    
 The district court further explained  that it was 
rejecting the T enant’s motion to amend his counterclaim because 
“the Court doesn’t believe there’s anything to amend given the 
Court’s prior ruling s that were made in this case.”   The 
district court apparently believed that the ICA’s vacating of 
the district court’s prior ruling did not affect the district _***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
11 
 court’s analysis on remand, even though the vacated prior ruling 
was that the Tenant’s answer (containing in substance a 
counterclaim for retaliatory eviction) was untimely.  Instead, 
the district court interpreted the ICA to hold that “there’s no 
further issues with regard” to the  case.  Concluding that “we’re 
several years removed from a judgment of possession and writ of 
possession,” the district court denied the T enant’s motion for 
leave of court to amend his counterclaim or, in the alternative, 
to file a counterclaim.   The dist rict court denied the Tenant’s 
motion, issued an order dismissing any and all remaining claims 
with prejudice, and awarded attorney’s fees and costs to  the 
Landlord.   
D.  Second Appeal 
 On the second appeal, the 
Tenant contended  that the 
district court erred by depriving him of his due process and 
statutory rights by denying his right to be heard on his 
retaliatory eviction claim and by denying his motion for leave 
of court to amend his existing counterclaim or in the 
alternative to file a counterclaim.   As to the Tenant’s 
contention that the district court denied his procedural due 
process right to have his claims reviewed on the merits, the 
Landlord raised three points: (1) The Tenant had an opportunity 
to have his arguments for leave to amend his counterclaim heard 
on August 2, 2012; (2) in order to allege procedural due _***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
12 
 process, the Tenant was required  to have a property  interest in 
the condominium at the time of his motion for leave to file a 
counterclaim; and (3) any pending claims pertaining  to the issue 
of possession were rendered moot by the ICA’s summary 
disposition order in the first appeal.  
 As to whether the d
istrict court erred in denying the 
Tenant’s motion for leave of court to amend counterclaim or in 
the alternative to file a counterclaim, the Landlord countered: 
(1) the Tenant failed to preserve this issue for appeal, and (2) 
the Tenant failed to follow the DCRCP rules to amend his 
counterclaim.  
In reply, the Tenant reiterated  arguments raised 
in his opening brief.   In response to the L andlord’s argument  
that the Tenant failed to preserve the issue as to whether he 
could amend his counterclaim, the Tenant claimed that he raised 
objections in his subsequent filings.   
 In its summary disposition order, the ICA explained 
that any 
defenses contained in the Tenant’s original answer were  
moot on remand because all of the Landlord’s  claims were 
completely resolved.  As to the Tenant’s arguments regarding his 
counterclaim, the ICA considered only the Tenant’s July 22, 2008 
counterclaim and his November 5, 2008
 motion for leave to file a 
counterclaim in the original action.   
 However, t he ICA failed to address whether the 
Tenant’s April 30, 2008 answer contained a counterclaim.  _***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
13 
 Rather, the ICA reasoned that because the Tenant did not raise 
any objections to the striking of his July 22, 2008 counterclaim 
or the district court’s denial of his November 5, 2008 motion 
for leave to file a counterclaim in his first appeal, he waived 
any claims regarding the July 22, 2008 counterclaim or the 
November 5, 2008 motion.  Finally, the ICA affirmed the 
remainder of the district court’s rulings but reversed the award 
of attorney’s fees to the Landlord.  
II.  Standards of Review 
 
A.  Motion to Dismiss 
  A trial court’s ruling on a motion to dismiss is 
reviewed de novo.  Wright v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. , 111 Hawai ʻi  
401, 406–07, 142 P.3d 265, 270 –71 (2006); Kamaka v. Goodsill 
Anderson Quinn & Stifel , 117 Hawai ʻi 92, 104, 176 P.3d 91, 103 
(2008), as corrected (Jan. 25, 2008). 
B.  Statutory Interpretation 
   
  “Statutory interpretation is a question of law 
reviewable de novo.”   Kaleikini v. Yoshioka , 128 Hawai ʻi 53, 67, 
283 P.3d 60, 74 (2012) . 
III.  Discussion 
  
 The Tenant’s main argument on certiorari centers on 
his claim that the ICA erred by failing to recognize that his 
April 30, 2008 answer and motion to dismiss included a 
cognizable counterclaim for retaliatory eviction against the _***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
14 
 Landlord.  Before we address that argument, however, it will be 
helpful to provide a brief overview of the relevant law.  
A.  Summary Possession Proceedings, Evictions, and Retaliatory    
Acts by Landlords  
 
  
Eviction of the Tenant occurred as a result of the  
summary proceeding initiated by the Landlord for possession of 
the dwelling unit in district court.  See HRS § 666-1 
(1972)(providing for summary possession proceedings); HRS § 521 -
68 (1984)(providing for summary proceedings for possession in 
the context of the Residential Landlord- Tenant Code); HRS § 666-
6 (1984)(stating that venue for summary possession proceedings 
is in the district court where the premises are situated).  Such 
summary proceedings for recovery of possession of leased 
property exist in every state.  Restatement (Second) of 
Property, Land. & Ten. § 14.1 (Am. Law Inst. 1977).   
  Retaliatory evictions, retaliatory rent increases, and 
retaliatory decreases in services  are prohibited by the 
Residential Landlord- Tenant Code.  HRS § 521 -74(a).  These 
retaliatory actions are prohibited  if they occur subsequent to 
any one of three different statutorily- specified events.  First,  
retaliatory actions are prohibited if they occur after the 
tenant complains “ in good faith ” to the landlord or to a 
governmental agency specified in the statute regarding 
“conditions in or affecting the tenant’s dwelling unit”  which _***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
15 
 constitute a violation of a health law or regulation or “any 
provision” of the Residential Landlord -Tenant Code.  HRS § 521 -
74(a)(1).  Second, retaliatory actions are prohibited if they 
occur after the department of health or any other governmental 
agency “has filed a notice of complaint of a violation of a 
health law or regulation of any provision” of the Residential 
Landlord-Tenant Code.  HRS § 521-74 (a)(2).  Third, retaliatory 
actions are prohibited if they occur after a  tenant in good 
faith requests repairs under HRS § 521-63 or HRS § 521-64.  HRS 
§ 521-74(a)(3).   
  
Once one of those three triggering events occurs and 
the tenant continues to pay rent, the landlord is prohibited 
from retaliating by evicting the tenant, raising the rent, or 
decreasing services.  HRS § 521 -74(a).  Specifically, once one 
of the triggering events occurs, “no action or proceeding to 
recover possession of the dwelling unit may be maintained 
against the tenant, nor shall the landlord otherwise cause the 
tenant to quit the dwelling unit involuntarily, nor demand an 
increase in rent from the tenant; nor decrease the services to 
which the tenant has been entitled . . .”  HRS  § 521-74(a);11 see
 
                                                           
 11  The statutory provisions protecting tenants  from retaliatory  
actions by the landlord apply “so long as the tenant continues to tender the 
usual rent to the landlord or proceeds to tender receipts for rent lawfully 
withheld . . . .”  HRS § 521 -74(a).   _***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
16 
 Cedillos v. Masumoto , 136 Hawaiʻi 430, 442, 363 P.3d 278, 290 
(2015).    
  For the tenant to be protected from retaliatory 
actions by the landlord, the tenant’s complaint to the landlord 
(or to a relevant government agency) must be made “ in good 
faith.”  HRS § 521- 74(a)(1); HRS § 521-74(a)(3).  See also HRS § 
521-10 (“Every duty imposed by this chapter and every act which 
must be performed as a condition precedent to the exercise of a 
right or remedy under this chapter imposes an obligation of good 
faith in its performance or enforcement. ”); 1978 Haw. Sess. Laws 
Act 75, § 1 at 98 (stating that under the Residential Landlord-
Tenant Code, “One of the most basic duties imposed upon 
landlords and tenants is that they act in good faith.”).   One of 
the factors bearing on whether a  tenant made a complaint in good 
faith is “whether the tenant made reasonable efforts to bring 
the alleged violations to the landlord’s attention[.]”  
Restatement (Second) of Property, Land. & Ten. § 14.8.  A 
“tenant need not demonstrate actual retaliation .”  Cedillos , 136 
Hawaiʻi at 442, 363 P.3d at 290 .  Instead, “ absent certain 
exceptions, so long as the tenant continues to submit rent, once 
a tenant has ‘complained in good faith’  to the landlord or a 
governmental agency, the landlord is expressly prohibited from 
(1) maintaining an action or proceeding to recover possession of 
the premises, (2) otherwise causing the tenant to quit _***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
17 
 involuntarily, (3) raising the tenant ’s rent, and (4) decreasing 
the services to which the tenant is entitled. ”  Id. 
  Tenants  also have various obligations under the 
Residential Landlord- Tenant Code.  These include complying with 
applicable building and housing laws affecting health and 
safety, keeping premises occupied or used by the tenant clean 
and safe, disposing in a clean and safe manner of the tenant’s 
rubbish, garbage, and organic and flammable waste, and other 
obligations specified by the Code.  HRS § 521-51(1) -(8)(1989) .  
Tenants must comply with a landlord’s obligations or 
restrictions relating to the tenant’s use, occupancy, and 
maintenance of the dwelling unit if appropriate notice has been 
given by the landlord and certain other conditions have all been 
met.  HRS § 521-52(a)-(d) (2003); HRS § 521- 52(b)(1) -(4).   
  Landlords, in turn,  have various remedies for tenants’  
failure to meet their statutory obligations.  HRS § 521- 69(a)-
(c)(1984).  Where a tenant makes a prior, good faith complaint 
to the landlord or a relevant government agency about violations 
of the Code, a landlord may nonetheless maintain an action to 
recover possession of the dwelling unit, without committing 
retaliatory eviction, if the landlord meets one or more of seven 
requirements specified in the Code.  HRS § 521- 74(b)(1)- (7).  
Similarly, where a tenant makes a prior, good faith complaint to 
the landlord or a relevant government agency about violations of _***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
18 
 the Code, a landlord may nonetheless increase the rent without 
committing a retaliatory rent increase if the landlord meets one 
or more of five requirements specified in the Code.  HRS § 521-
74(d)(1)- (5).   
B.  Construed Liberally, the T enant’s Answer Contained a     
Counterclaim for Retaliatory Eviction 
  The Tenant argues that his April 30, 2008 answer 
incorporated a counterclaim for retaliatory eviction against the 
Landlord and that the ICA erred by failing to address the 
tenant’s counterclaim arguments in the second appeal.  He 
contends that language in his answer states  a counterclaim for 
retaliatory eviction, namely, that he had been subjected to 
violations of the Resident ial Landlord- Tenant Code.   
  T he Tenant titled a lengthy section of his answer, 
“Retaliatory Eviction.”  At the close of that section, he asked 
the district court to find that “the current actions of 
providing notice to vacate and all future actions 
within a 
reasonable period of time represents [sic] a retaliatory 
eviction and is contrary to HRS 521-74  and the Complaint should 
be dismissed with prejudice.”   In addition, the T enant requested 
“lost wages for having to address Plaintiff’s acts of 
retaliatory eviction, the filing of Complaint, answering of 
Complaint by filing of this [answer and motion to dismiss] and 
appearing at [the hea ring on Landlord’s complaint].”   Although _***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
19 
 the Tenant admits that these statements were not captioned as a 
counterclaim, he contends the court should have nonetheless 
recognized that his answer included a counterclaim.  Moreover, 
the Tenant argues that his attempt to assert a counterclaim 
should be held to “less stringent standards than formal 
pleadings drafted by lawyers.”  
  We agree.  “Pleadings prepared by pro se litigants 
should be interpreted liberally.”  Dupree v. Hiraga , 121 Hawaiʻi 
297, 314, 219 P.3d 1084, 1101 (2009).  “The rules do not require 
technical exactness or draw refined inferences against the 
pleader; rather, they require a determined effort to understand 
what the pleader is attempting to set forth and to construe the 
pleading in his favor.”  Id. (citing Giuliani v. Chuck , 1 Haw. 
App. 379, 385-86, 620 P.2d 733 , 737-38 (1980)).  This 
“determined effort” to understand the pleading s is particularly 
necessary “when a court is dealing with a complaint drawn by a 
layman unskilled in the law.”  Id.  See  also DCRCP Rule 
8(c)(1996)(“When a party has mistakenly designated a defense as 
a counterclaim or a counterclaim as a defense, the court, i f 
justice so requires, shall treat the pleading as if there had 
been a proper designation.” ); DCRCP Rule 8(f)( “All pleadings 
shall be construed so as to do substantial justice .” (emphasis 
added)).  Interpreting the Tenant’s pro se answer  liberally and 
“so as to do substantial justice,” we hold that the Tenant _***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
20 
 sufficiently stated a counterclaim alleging retaliatory eviction 
in his answer.  
As noted above, retaliatory eviction is governed by 
HRS § 521-74.   We interpreted  this statutory provision in 
Cedillos, 136 Hawai ʻi 430, 363 P.3d 278.  In Cedillos, the tenant 
filed a complaint for various violations of the Landlord -Tenant 
Code in district court the day before the landlord issued a 45 -
day notice to vacate.  Id. at 442, 363 P.3 d at 290 .  Several 
weeks later, the landlord sought leave to file a counterclaim 
for summary possession, and the circuit court granted the 
motion.  Id. at 435 -36, 363 P.3d at 283 -84.  We noted that the  
“sequence of events is important because it impacts whether 
various statutory rights and obligations . . . are triggered ” 
under the Residential Landlord -Tenant Code .  Id. at 441, 363 
P.3d at 289.  We held the tenant’s complaint rendered the 
landlord’s 45-day notice ineffective because “after” that 
triggering event, the landlord was prohibited from “causing the 
tenant to quit the dwelling unit involuntarily[.]”   Id. at 442, 
363 P.3d at 290 (quoting HRS § 521 –74(a))(braces omitted) .  
Analyzing the language of HRS § 521 -74(a), we held that “ absent 
certain exceptions, so long as the tenant continues to submit 
rent, once a tenant has ‘complained in good faith’ to the 
landlord or a governmental agency, the landlord is expressly 
prohibited from . . . maintaining an action or proceeding to _***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
21 
 recover possession of the premises [.]”  Id. at 442, 363 P.3d at 
290.   
  We have long recognized retaliatory eviction as an 
affirmative defense to summary possession actions.  Windward 
Partners v. Delos Santos , 59 Haw. 104, 116, 577  P.2d 326, 333 
(1978)(holding that “where  a tenant asserts a statutory right, 
in the protection of his property interest as a tenant, and as a 
result the landlord seeks to dispossess the tenant through 
summary possession proceedings, the tenant can assert an 
affirmative defense of retaliatory eviction ”); id. (premising 
that holding “not only on safeguarding the effectiveness of the 
statutes involved, but substantially on the recognition of the 
salutary policy of protecting the property interests of the 
tenants from retaliating landlords ”).   
  A  tenant, as a party in an action for summary 
possession, can also counterclaim for violations of the various 
statutory rights and protections guaranteed to tenants under the 
Residential Landlord
-Tenant Code.  See generally, Cedillos , 136 
Hawaiʻi 430, 363 P.3d 278 ; see also  S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 223,  
in 1972 Senate Journal, at 834 (noting that the legislature 
enacted HRS chapter 521 “to codify recent legislative, judicial, 
and administrative trends in equalizing the bargaining power of 
landlord and tenant and to treat fairly the interests 
involved”); 99 Am. Jur. Trials 289, § 8  (Supp. 2018)(“Most _***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
22 
 courts have acknowledged the tenan t’s right to assert 
retaliatory eviction as a defense or counterclaim to a 
landlord’s action for possession or unpaid rent. ”).  Other 
states have also recognized that retaliatory eviction may be 
asserted as a counterclaim.  
See, e.g., Aweeka v. Bonds , 20 Cal. 
App. 3d 278, 281 (Cal. App. 1971) (holding there was no 
discernible rational basis for allowing retaliatory eviction as 
a substantive defense while denying it as an affirmative cause 
of action); Morford v. Lensey Corp ., 
442 N.E.2d 933, 938 (Ill. 
App. Ct. 1982); Jablonski v. Clemons , 803 N.E.2d 730 , 734 (Mass. 
App. Ct. 2004); Paullin v. Sutton , 724 P.2d 749, 750 (Nev. 
1986); Sims v. Century Kiest Apartments , 567 S.W.2d 526 (Tex. 
App. 1978); Murphy v. Smallridge , 468 S.E.2d 167 (W. Va. 1996). 
  In addition, in Hawaiʻi the district court has 
jurisdiction “in civil actions involving summary possession or 
ejectment,” and in those actions, “the district court shall have 
jurisdiction over any counterclaim otherwise properly brought  by 
any defendant in the action if the counterclaim arises out of 
and refers to the . . .  premises the possession of which is 
being sought, regardless of the value of the debt, amount, 
damages, or property claim contained in the counterclaim.”  HRS 
§ 604-5(a)(emphasis added). 
  We hold that, liberally construed, the Tenant here 
stated a counterclaim f or retaliatory eviction in his answer .  _***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
23 
 While continuing to tender the usual rent, the T enant complained 
to the Landlord regarding her alleged violations of the 
Residential Landlord- Tenant Code.  HRS § 521- 74(a)(1)(requiring 
as a condition for a claim of retaliatory eviction that the 
tenant complained “in good faith to the . . . landlord . . . of 
conditions in or affecting the tenant’s dwelling unit” 
constituting “a violation of . . . any provisio n of this 
chapter” prior to the landlord’s maintaining of an action or 
proceeding to recover possession of the dwelling unit).  Whether 
the contents of all the Tenant’s complaints were as he claims, 
and whether the complaints were made in good faith, are issues 
of fact that were never established because no trial was held 
below.  Similarly, the L andlord was never provided with an 
opportunity to plead or prove the defenses to retaliatory 
eviction detailed in HRS § 521 -74(b)(1) -(7). 
  On remand the Tenant will have the opportunity to 
establish that he made the complaints to the Landlord alleged in 
his “implicit” counterclaim, and the L andlord will have the 
opportunity to present any evidence rebutting that.   Both the 
Tenant and the Landlord will have the opportunity to present 
evidence as  to whether the T enant’s complaint s were made in good 
faith.  In addition, on remand the Landlord  and the Tenant will 
have the opportunity to present or rebut any evidence that the 
Landlord was entitled to maintain the action to recover _***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
24 
 possession of the dwelling unit for any of the seven reasons 
specified in HRS § 521- 74(b)(1) -(7).  If he is successful in his 
counterclaim, the T enant will have the opportunity to present 
evidence of damages.  HRS § 521 -74(c).   
IV.  Conclusion 
 
The ICA on the second appeal failed to address the 
issue of the Tenant’s “implicit” counterclaim for retaliatory 
eviction.  We hold that, liberally construed, the pro se 
Tenant’s “Answer to Complaint & Motion to Dismiss” contained a 
counterclaim for retaliatory eviction.  Accordingly, we vacate 
the ICA’s judgment on app eal, except as to its reversal of the 
earlier award of attorney’s fees to the Landlord, and vacate the 
judgment of the district court.   We remand to the district court 
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
