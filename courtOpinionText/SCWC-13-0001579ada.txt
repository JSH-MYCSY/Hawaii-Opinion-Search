(CAAP-13-0001579) 
JUNE 28, 2018 
RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, POLLACK, AND WILSON, JJ. 
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J.  
 
  Bernard Kuamoo, Denise Gabriel, Arasi Mose, Kelii Lau, 
and Fiafia  Sataraka (the employees or applicants) are employed 
by the Department of Public Safety as Adult Correction Officers .  
Each applied for promotion to open supervisory positions, and 
each was rejected based on an unwritten department policy.  
Under the unwritten policy, the department precludes from 
promotion to supervisory positions all employees who have been 
suspended for violation of the department’s standards of conduct 
in the prior two years.  The unwritten policy applies without 
exception.  Each applicant had passed the relevant examination 
and was otherwise qualified for the supervisory position
 prior 
to being deemed “unsuitable” under the unwritten policy .   
  At issue is whether the department’s  policy violates 
aspects of the merit principle on which the Hawaiʻ i  civil service 
system is founded.  See
 Haw. Const. art. XVI, § 1 (mandating 
that the “employment of persons in the civil service, as defined _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
4 
 by law . . . shall be governed by the merit principle ”); HRS § 
76-1.  As explained below, we hold the department’s unwritten 
policy violates the merit principle.   
I.  BACKGROUND 
  The applicants are Adult Corrections Officers  (ACO) 
employed by the Department of Public Safety (PSD or the 
department).  Each applied for a promotion to an open 
supervisory position, either ACO IV (sergeant) or ACO V  
(lieutenant) positions.  Each was informed by department letter 
that his or her application had been denied.  The letters noted 
that a background check revealed the applicant had violated the 
department’s standards of conduct and been suspended, sometimes 
for as little as one day.  According to the letters, the 
department deemed each applicant “unsuitable” for promotion for 
the following two reasons: 
1. Inadequate amount of elapsed time from the effective 
date of your suspension to show rehabilitation.  
2. Your decision to violate or  disregard the Standards of 
Conduct. 
The department characterized its decision 
as a determination 
that the applicant is deemed “temporarily unsuitable” for the 
position.   
  The employees individually challenged PSD’s denial of 
their application for promotion to the Merit Appeals Board 
(MAB).  According to testimony before the MAB, the selection _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
5 
 process for ACO IV and V positions consists of several stages.  
The department first administers a written examination to 
applicants.  Applicants must receive a minimum score of 70 
percent on the examination
 in order to be considered qualified 
for the positions.  Those applicants who pass the written 
examination are then ranked by seniority.  Depending on how many 
vacancies are available, the department contacts applicants by 
seniority and solicits permission to conduct a background check 
regarding the applicant’s “suitability ,” which includes a review 
of employment records.  If review of an applicant’s employment 
records reveals a suspension within the prior two years, the 
applicant is deemed “temporarily unsuitable.”   
  T he department’s unwritten policy deems as unsuitable 
any applicant for promotion into a supervisory position who has 
been suspended within the prior two  years.  That policy was 
developed in 2005 to address concerns by wardens about ACOs with 
recent suspensions being promoted.  A department personnel 
specialist conceded there is no written documentation of the 
concerns giving rise to the policy.  But the specialist asserted 
that the policy attempted to “make sure that whoever we’re 
promoting [is] going to follow the same Standards of Conduct 
that they’re going to enforce upon whoever they supervise.”  
ACOs receiving a suspension were never informed that the 
suspension would act as a bar on promotions for the next two _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
years.  While applicants to supervisory ACO positions were 
informed about the other minimum qualifications before applying, 
they were never informed of the existence of the suspension 
policy until after their application was denied.  The MAB denied 
each of the employees ’ appeals .   
6 
  
 The applicants individually appealed the MAB decisions 
1to the First Circuit Court.
  The circuit court consolidated the 
five appeals, affirmed the MAB’s findings of fact and 
conclusions of law, and dismissed the applicants’  consolidated 
appeals.  The court explained that the department had advanced a 
reasonable basis for the suspension policy, namely, “that 
suspensions for violations of the Department’s Standards of 
Conduct specifically correlate to both the ability to properly 
and safely perform this very demanding job and supervise others 
who do so.”  The circuit court found that the same reasons 
explained why the department treated suspensions “as a bright 
line barrier to future promotions for two years, as opposed to 
looking at each violation on a case by case basis, as is done by 
the Department with regard to pre- employment past criminal 
convictions.”  The applicants appealed to the ICA, and the ICA 
affirmed the circuit court.  Matter of Kuamoo , 138 Hawaiʻi 494, 
505, 382 P.3d 306, 317 (App. 2016) .   
                                                           
 1 The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided.  _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
  The ICA held that the circuit court correctly ruled  
that the MAB’s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous, that 
the MAB’s conclusions of law were supported by its findings of 
fact, and that the conclusions of law were not errors of law.  
Id. at 500-03, 382 P.3d at 312-15.  In particular, the ICA 
concluded that the department’s suspension policy did not 
violate the merit principle.  The ICA noted that the department 
is vested with authority to make “suitability determinations” 
under the Hawaiʻ i Administrative Rules (HAR).  Id. at 502–03, 382 
P.3d at 314–15 (citing HAR § 23- 10-2(b)).  According to the 
department, suspensions on an ACO’s record indicate that the ACO 
could “not follow their own Standards of Conduct.”  Id. at 503, 
382 P.3d at 315.  As the ICA explained, “PSD wanted to ‘ make 
sure that whoever [PSD is] promoting [is] going to follow the 
same Standards of Conduct that they ’re going to enforce upon 
whoever they supervise. ’”  Id. (citing PSD testimony).   
7 
   Given the department’s authority to make  suitability 
determinations, as well as the department’s proffered  rationale 
for the suspension policy, the ICA concluded that the policy did 
not violate the merit principle of impartial selection of 
individuals based on objective criteria.  
PSD’s suspension policy is objective and speaks directly to 
PSD's responsibility to ensure that whomever it promotes to 
the Supervisory Positions has the necessary fitness and 
character to fulfill the duties of the Supervisory 
Position, which includes ensuring that other ACOs do not _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
8 
 violate the Standards of Conduct.  PSD’s suspension policy, 
therefore, does not violate the “merit principle” pur suant 
to HRS § 76– 1. 
 
Id.    
  The ICA also rejected the employees’ argument that the 
selection process was not “fair and impartial,” as required by 
the merit principle.  The employees had argued that applicants 
for the supervisory position with prior criminal records were 
given case-by-case suitability determinations.  In contrast, 
applicants who were merely suspended for as little as a day for 
violating one of the department’s standards of  conduct within 
the two-year window were uniformly denied promotion rather than 
afforded a case-by-case suitability determination.  The ICA 
rejected the applicants’ argument, observing that the 
department’s regulations give it the authority to decide a 
prospective employee’s fitness for department positions. 
 Id. 
(citing HAR § 23-10-6).  HAR § 23- 10-6 authorizes suitability 
determinations to be made based on “fitness for employment.”  
The regulation allows the department’s  suitability determination 
to draw on information from criminal history records, employment 
records, or other sources of information.  The purpose of the 
suitability determination is to “ensure that staff members and 
prospective staff members are of reputable and responsible 
character, and are capable of performing the duties of the job.”

   On certiorari, the employees argue that the ICA’s 
opinion sanctions “the use of undisclosed criteria” in hiring, 
which could “in turn sanction the retroactive use of similar 
secret standards in a way that is antithetical to the merit 
2principle.”    
II.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
  Under Hawaii’s Administrative Procedure Act, we review 
agency decisions and orders for constitutional or statutory 
violations, actions beyond the agency’s authority or 
jurisdiction, clearly erroneous findings of fact, unlawful 
procedure or other errors of law, arbitrary and capricious 
decisions or orders, and abuses of discretion or clearly 
unwarranted exercises of discretion.  HRS § 91– 14(g)(1)-(6) 
(2012).  We review conclusions of law presenting mixed questions 
of fact and law “under the clearly erroneous standard because 
the conclusion is dependent upon the facts and circumstances of 
the particular case.”  Save Diamond Head Waters LLC.

 2 In their application, the employees assert that the ICA 
“mistakenly construed the present dispute as one over whether the Employer’s 
duty to negotiate with the Union when that contention was never addressed by 
the Union or the Appellants.”  Instead, the employees assert, they “simply 
contended that the ban and its non- disclosure violated  the openness, 
fairness, and objectivity mandated by the merit principle as defined in HRS §  
76-1.  Accordingly, we do not address any implications of the suspension 
policy for collective bargaining.  See Kuamoo, 138 Hawaiʻ i at 500 -502, 382 
P.3rd at 312- 314.    _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_

 appellate capacity, we apply “the same standard of review as 
that applied upon primary review by the circuit court.”  
AlohaCare v. Ito, 126 Hawai ʻi 326, 341, 271 P.3d 621, 636 (2012) 
(citation omitted).  
III.  DISCUSSION 
  The employees argue that the department’s policy, and 
the ICA’s affirmance of the MAB orders upholding the policy, 
“sanction 
the use of undisclosed criteria” in hiring, which 
could “in turn sanction the retroactive use of similar secret 
standards in a way that is antithetical to the merit principle.”   
A. The merit pr inciple 
  
 “The employment of persons in the civil service, as 
defined by law . . . shall be governed by the merit principle.”  
Haw. Const. art. XVI, § 1.  As embodied in the 
Hawaiʻi 
Constitution, the merit principle “simply means that the civil 
service, however defined, is to be governed by merit 
principles.”  Konno v. Cty. of Hawai ʻi
, 85 Hawaiʻi 61, 70, 937 
P.2d 397, 406 (1997).  The Hawaiʻ i  Constitution does not itself 
“establish an independently enforceable right to the protection 
of merit principles.”  Id.  Rather, the constitution “expressly 
refers to other sources for a definition of ‘civil service,’”  
such as statutory and case law.  Id.    
  The civil service statute defines the merit principle 
broadly as “the selection of persons based on their fitness and _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
11 
 ability for public employment and the retention of employees 
based on their demonstrated appropriate conduct and productive 
performance.”  HRS § 76-1 (2000).  In order to achieve the broad 
purpose of selecting
 civil service employees based on fitness 
and ability, the statute requires, among other things, 
“[i]mpartial selection of individuals for public service by 
means of competitive tests which are fair, objective, and 
practical[.] ”  HRS § 76 -1(2).  As we have explained, our civil 
service system “embodies positive principles of public 
administration such as openness, merit, and independence.  
Openness is served through public announcement of job vacancies, 
clear articulation of qualifications, open application to all 
persons, and selection according to objective criteria. ”  Konno, 
85 Hawaiʻ i at 68, 937 P.2d at 404 (citations omitted); Salera v. 
Caldwell, 137 Hawai ʻi 409, 417, 375 P.3d 188, 196 (2016). 
B.  The unwritten “brightline”  suspension policy violates the 
merit principle of openness in the application process for civil 
service positions 
  The employees assert that the department’s  “complete 
failure to disclose the two-year bar on suspensions for 
employees seeking promotion is the antithesis of the openness 
and public articulation of objective standards required by the 
merit principle.”  We agree that the failure to disclose the 
two-year bar violates the merit principle. _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
12 
   As a general matter, the merit principle requires 
“clear articulation of qualifications” and “ open application to 
all persons[.]”
  Konno, 85 Hawaiʻi at 68, 937 P.2d at 404 
(citations omitted).  Here, the department failed at the outset 
of the application process to make known to applicants for the 
supervisory positions a critical requirement for the positions.  
If an applicant had been suspended for any reason and for any 
length of time in the prior two years, the applicant was deemed 
by the department’s unwritten suspension policy to be 
“temporarily unsuitable ” for the supervisory position s, even if 
the applicant was otherwise qualified for the positions.   
  T he suspension policy was a brightline ru le applied 
without exception.  For that reason, the absence of a suspension 
within the prior two years was the functional equivalent of a 
significant minimum qualification for the position.  Yet that 
qualification (or disqualifying factor) was never included in 
any announcement of the position openings
, and the applicants 
were made aware of that qualification only at the end of the 
process, by the department’s letters rejecting the applicants 
for the positions.  Moreover,  as embodied in an unwritten 
policy, the additional qualification for the position was not 
articulated at all.  This lack of openness regarding a 
significant qualification (or disqualifying factor) for the 
supervisory positions was compounded by the “notice of _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
13 
 disposition of application”  sent to the applicants.  It states: 
“You have met the minimum qualification and other requirements 
for this vacancy.”  (Emphasis added).  The notice then provides 
instructions on taking the written examination, which each of 
the applicants later  passed.  
  T he language in the “ notice of disposition of 
application” is inaccurate; there were, in fact,  additional 
“other requirements” for the supervisory positions.  However, 
those other requirements, embodied in the unwritten brightline  
suspension policy, remained unarticulated and unannounced.  
Applicants were given no notice of the full set of significant 
minimum requirements for the position until after they were 
rejected for the positions.3  In sum, the silent imposition of a 
de facto minimum qualification for the supervisory positions  
violated the merit principles  of openness and clear articulation 
of qualifications.   
  We hold that an unwritten policy which imposes a 
significant qualification or disqualification for a position, 
and which is not otherwise made known to applicants at or near 
the outset of the application process, violates the merit 
                                                           
 3  We recognize there is a difference between meeting the minimum 
requirements for an ACO IV or V position and the further step of receiving a 
positive suitability determination.  See HAR § 23 -10-2(b).  Here, however, 
precisely because the suitability determination was based on the brightline 
suspension policy and was applied without exception, the unwritten policy 
operated as a minimum requirement for the supervisory positions.  
 _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***_  
 
14 
 principle of openness.   HRS § 91 -14(g)(4)(authorizing an 
appellate court to reverse an agency decision or order if 
substantial rights of petitioners may have been prejudiced 
because the administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or 
orders are affected by an error of law). 
IV.  CONCLUSION 
  For the reasons stated above, we vacate the ICA’s 
opinion and judgment on appeal, as well as the circuit court’s 
order dismissing the applicants’ consolidated appeal.  We remand 
to the circuit court with instructions to remand to the Merit 
Appeals Board for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
