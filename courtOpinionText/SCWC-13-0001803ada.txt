(“Kristerpher”),   who  died  while  riding  as  a  passenger  in  a

bring  its  claim  of  negligence  against  Zelo’s.   The  Circuit  Court  
of  the  Fifth  Circuit  (“circuit  court”)  granted  summary  judgment  
to  Zelo’s  because  Kristerpher  was  also  intoxicated  at  the  time  
of  the  accident,  and  therefore  not  an  “innocent  third  party”  
with  standing  to  bring  a  dram  shop  claim.    The  Intermediate

the complicity defense, i.e. “whether Kristerpher actively 
contributed to or procured the intoxication of Solomon and thus, 
whether Kristerpher falls within the protected class of innocent 
third parties entitled to bring a dram shop cause of action.” 
Kuahiwinui v. Zelo’s Inc.
, 141 Hawaiʻi 368, 379, 409 P.3d 772, 
783 (App. 2017). Because the complicity defense is inconsistent 
with application of the defense of contributory negligence, the 
judgment of the ICA is affirmed, but on the grounds that there 
are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Kristerpher’s 
contributory negligence exceeded the negligence of Zelo’s. 
I.
 Background 
On
 April 1, 2006 on the island of Kauaʻi, Solomon was 
driving his cousin, Kristerpher, and friend, Christopher 
Ferguson (“Ferguson”), home after having dinner and alcoholic 
drinks at Sushi & Blues—a restaurant owned and operated by 
Zelo’s. When their vehicle failed to negotiate a left turn, it 
tumbled down an embankment and landed in the Hanalei River 
upside-down. Solomon survived, but Kristerpher and Ferguson 
were unable to escape from the vehicle, and died. 
Solomon
 testified in his deposition as to the events 
that occurred leading up to the accident. When Solomon, 
Ferguson, and Kristerpher stopped at a bank to deposit their 
checks in the late afternoon on March 31, 2006, Ferguson 
purchased a twelve-pack of beer from a nearby store. They drove 
4            
             
         
          
         
           
           
        
         
           
         
       
        
            
            
           
           
           
           
          
          
                     
           
      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to Hanalei Bay, where they remained for two hours drinking beer. 
Kristerpher also purchased marijuana from a group of people 
nearby. Solomon drank two beers and smoked marijuana during 
this time. Solomon then drove himself, Kristerpher, and 
Ferguson from Hanalei Bay to Sushi & Blues, where they had 
dinner and drinks. They were served by Zelo’s’ employee Serge 
Bullington (“Bullington”) who later stated in his deposition 
that Solomon did not appear intoxicated. Bullington recalled 
serving Solomon two beers and two shots. According to Solomon, 
Kristerpher also purchased a mixed drink with “strong tequila” 
which the three men shared. 
Solomon, Kristerpher, and Ferguson left Sushi & Blues 
and Solomon drove them to a nearby bar called Tahiti Nui. 
Solomon ordered one beer at Tahiti Nui, but after a few sips, 
the security guard asked Solomon and Kristerpher to leave.3 When 
they left Tahiti Nui around midnight, Solomon was driving. As 
the car approached the Hanalei Bridge, it failed to negotiate a 
left turn, hit a guard rail, rolled down an embankment, and 
plunged into the river upside down. Kristerpher and Ferguson 
drowned and Solomon escaped. Blood tests later revealed that 
3 Solomon speculated that they were asked to leave Tahiti Nui 
because Kristerpher was underage.

      *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Solomon’s blood alcohol content (“BAC”) was 0.13, or one and a 
half times the legal limit for driving.4 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings 
As noted, Kristerpher’s Estate filed a dram shop claim 
against Zelo’s.5 It argued that Zelo’s breached its duty to 
refrain from serving alcohol to patrons that it knew, or had 
reason to know, were under the influence of an intoxicant. 
Zelo’s moved for summary judgment with respect to the dram shop 
claim, arguing that “[i]ntoxicated persons . . . are simply not 
afforded the right to assert civil liability against a 
commercial seller of alcohol[.]” Because Kristerpher was 
intoxicated at the time of his death,6 Zelo’s argued that he did 
not fall within the class of persons intended to be protected by 
dram shop liability. The circuit court granted Zelo’s’ motion 
for summary judgment, finding that Kristerpher’s Estate lacked 
4 Pursuant to HRS § 291E-61(a)(4) (Supp. 2005), the legal limit for 
driving is 0.08 grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters or cubic 
centimeters of blood: 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates 
or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
. . . . 
(4) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one hundred 
milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood. 
5 Kristerpher’s Estate also brought a dram shop claim against 
Tahiti Nui, but it was dismissed with prejudice pursuant to a stipulation 
entered into by the parties. 
6 Kristerpher’s BAC at the time of the accident was 0.16—twice the 
legal limit for driving. 
6            
    B. ICA Proceedings 
  On  appeal,  Kristerpher’s  Estate  argued  that  the  
circuit  court  erred  in  holding  that  Kristerpher  was  not  an  
“innocent  third  party”  intended  to  be  protected  by  the  dram  shop  
law.   It  claimed  that  only  individuals  who  injure  themselves  as  
a  result  of  drunk  driving  are  precluded  from  asserting  dram  shop  
causes  of  action,  and  since  Kristerpher  was  a  passenger  in  a  
vehicle  driven  by  a  drunk  driver,  Kristerpher’s  Estate  is  not  
barred  from  raising  the  claim.    
 
 The  ICA   vacated  the  circuit  court’s  order  granting  
summary  judgment  to  Zelo’s.   Zelo’s,  141  Hawaiʻi  at  379,  409  P.3d  
at  783.   It  described  the  duty  owed  by  a  liquor  licensee  “not  to  
serve  alcohol  to  a  person  it  knows  or  reasonably  should  know  is  
under  the  influence  of  alcohol”  and  noted  that  the  class  of  
people  intended  to  be  protected  by  this  legal  duty  are  “innocent  
third  parties.”   Id.  at  369,  409  P.3d  at  773.   The  ICA  stated  
that  “an  innocent  third  party  injured  by  a  drunk  driver  has  a  
negligence  cause  of  action  against  a  liquor  licensee  that,  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
standing  to  assert  the  claim  because  Kristerpher  was  intoxicated   
at  the  time  of  the  accident.   It  held  that  Zelo’s  did  not  owe  a  
duty  to  Kristerpher  to  refrain  from  serving  alcohol  to  Solomon,  
the  driver,  because  Kristerpher  was  not  an  “innocent  third  
party”  protected  by  the  dram  shop  law.   Kristerpher’s  Estate  
appealed  to  the  ICA.  
7            
   To  determine  what  constitutes  an  “innocent  third  
party,”  the  ICA  applied  a  complicity  defense  analysis  that  has  
been  adopted  in  several  other  jurisdictions.   Id.  at  378,  409  
P.3d  at  782.   Under  a  complicity  defense,  an  injured  third  party  
is  excluded  from  the  class  of  “innocent  third  parties”  that  may  
bring  a  dram  shop  claim  against  a  liquor  licensee  when  he  or  she  
“actively  contributed  to  or  procured  the  intoxication  of  the  
drunk  driver  who  injured  him  or  her.”   Id.  at  370,  409  P.3d  at  
774.   Here,  because  Kristerpher  was  not  the  driver  of  the  
vehicle,  the  ICA  determined  that  he  was  not  automatically  
excluded  from  the  class  of  “innocent  third  parties.”   Id.  at  
376-77,  409  P.3d  at  780-81.   However,  it  held  that  genuine  
issues  of  material  fact  existed  concerning  whether  Kristerpher  
“actively  contributed  to  or  procured”  Solomon’s  intoxication,  
which  would  remove  him  from  the  class  of  “innocent  third  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
preceding  the  injury,  served  alcohol  to  the  drunk  driver,  who  it  
knew  or  reasonably  should  have  known  was  intoxicated.”   Id.   The  
ICA  held  that  an  injured  third  party  that  is  intoxicated  “is  not  
automatically  excluded  from  the  class  of  innocent  third  parties  
entitled  to  pursue  a  dram  shop  cause  of  action.”   Id.  at  372,  
409  P.3d  at  776.   Rather,  only  an  individual  “who  injures  
himself  or  herself  while  driving  drunk”  is  precluded  from  
raising  such  a  claim.   Id.  at  376,  409  P.3d  at  780  (emphasis  in  
original).

parties”  and  thereby  bar  him  from  raising  a  dram  shop  claim  
against  Zelo’s.   Id.  at  379,  409  P.3d  at  783.   The  ICA  vacated  
the  circuit  court’s  judgment  and  remanded  to  the  circuit  court  
for  further  proceedings  consistent  with  its  opinion  that  the  
complicity  defense  was  available  to  Zelo’s.   Id.  
C. Supreme Court Filings 
Zelo’s
  raised  three   issues  in  its  Application  for  Writ  
of  Certiorari:   (1)  generally,  whether  a  party  asserting  a  dram  
shop  cause  of  action  must  establish  its  “standing  as  an  
‘innocent  third  party’  within  the  protected  class  of  individuals   
for  which  the  claim  is  reserved[;]”  (2)  whether  Kristerpher  is  
an  “innocent  third  party;”  and  (3)  whether  the  ICA  erred  in  
applying  the  complicity  defense  to  determine  that  there  are  
genuine  issues  of  material  fact  with  regard  to  Kristerpher’s  
status  as  an  “innocent  third  party.”   In  response,  Kristerpher’s  
Estate  argued  that  the  ICA  properly  applied  the  complicity  
defense  doctrine  and  correctly  found  that  there  are  genuine  
issues  of  material  fact  regarding  whether  Kristerpher  is  an  
“innocent  third  party”  in  this  case.    
The
  appellate  court  reviews  “the  circuit  court’s  grant  
or  denial  of  summary  judgment  de  novo.”   Querubin  v.  Thronas,

Aloha Plastic Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawaiʻi 490, 501 , 100 P.3d 60, 
71 (2004)). This
 court has often articulated that: 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on 
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there 
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the 
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A 
fact is material if proof of that fact would have the 
effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential 
elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the 
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light most 
favorable to the non-moving party. In other words, we must 
view all of the evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom 
in the light most favorable to the party opposing the 
motion.

100  P.3d  at  71).  
III. Discussion
 
A. Kristerpher’s Estate has standing to assert a dram 
shop claim against Zelo’s. 
Kristerpher’s  Estate  has  standing  to   raise  a  dram  shop  
claim  against  Zelo’s  pursuant  to  Hawaiʻi’s  liquor   control  
statute,  HRS  §  281-78,  which  imposes  a  duty  upon  liquor  
licensees  to  refrain  from  serving  individuals  that  the  licensees   
know,  or  have  reason  to  know,  are  under  the  influence  of  an  
intoxicating  liquor.   See  Ono,  62  Haw.  at  138,  612  P.2d  at  539.   
Although  a  dram  shop  owes  no  duty  to  a  customer  who  injures  
himself  or  herself  after  drinking,  it  owes  a  duty  to  innocent  7
7  At  the  time  of  the  accident,  HRS  §  281-78(b)(1)(B)  (Supp.  1996)  
stated  “[a]t  no  time  under  any  circumstances  shall  any  licensee  or  its  
employee  .  .  .  [s]ell,  serve,  or  furnish  any  liquor  to,  or  allow  the  
consumption  of  any  liquor  by:  .  .  .  [a]ny  person  at  the  time  under  the  
influence  of  liquor[.]”

injured  third  parties.   Bertelmann,   69  Haw.  at  101,  735  P.2d  at  
934.    8 
Bertelmann  does
  not  provide  a  dispositive  resolution  
to  the  question  raised  by  this  case.   Bertelmann  involved  a  
consumer  of  alcohol  who  died  from  injuries  he  received  while  
driving  his  car  alone  after  drinking  at  a  hotel.   Id.  at  96,  735  
P.2d  at  931.   This  court  held  that  “merely  serving  liquor  to  an  
already  intoxicated  customer  and  allowing  said  customer  to  leave  
the  premises,  of  itself,  does  not  constitute  actionable  
negligence”  “in  the  absence  of  harm  to  an  innocent  third  party,”  
id.  at  101,  735  P.2d  at  934,  but  did  not  expound  on  who  counts  
as  an  “innocent  third  party.”   In  our  view,  “an  innocent  third  
8  In  Bertelmann  v.  Taas  Assocs.,  this  court  “emphatically  
reject[ed]  the  contention  that  intoxicated  liquor  consumers  can  seek  recovery  
from  the  bar  or  tavern  which  sold  them  alcohol”  in  the  absence  of  
“affirmative  acts  which  increase  the  peril  of  an  intoxicated  customer.”   69  
Haw.  95,  100-01,  735  P.2d  930,  933-34  (1987).   In  doing  so,  we  created  an  
inconsistency  between  our  dram  shop  liability  rules  and  our  general  modified  
comparative  negligence  statute,  HRS  §  663-31  (2016),  under  which  “an  injured  
plaintiff  may  recover  against  a  defendant  even  if  her  negligence  contributed  
to  her  own  injury,  as  long  as  her  negligence  is  not  greater  than  that  of  the  
defendant.”   Steigman  v.  Outrigger  Enters.,  Inc.,  126  Hawaiʻi  133,  135,  267  
P.3d  1238,  1240  (2011).   It  has  accordingly  been  suggested  that  our  holding  
in  Bertelmann,  which  was  later  reaffirmed  in  Feliciano  v.  Waikiki  Deep  Water,  
Inc.,  69  Haw.  605,  752  P.2d  1076  (1988),  and  extended  to  preclude  underage  
drinkers  from  recovering  from  commercial  liquor  sellers  in  Winters  v.  Silver  
Fox  Bar,  71  Haw.  524,  797  P.2d  51  (1990),  should  be  reassessed.   See  Reyes  v.  
Kuboyama,  76  Hawaiʻi  137,  147,  870  P.2d  1281,  1291  (1994)  (Levinson,  J.,  
concurring).   However,  in  2003,  the  legislature  implicitly  acknowledged  this  
inconsistency  by  enacting  HRS  §  663-41  (2016),  which  imposes  the  same

beverages  to  persons  under  the  age  of  twenty-one  are  “liable  for  all  injuries

party” would, under our law of comparative negligence, be a 
person whose negligence does not exceed that of the tortfeasor. 
Because
  Kristerpher’s  Estate  is  a   third  party  
representing  an  individual  who  sustained  injuries  allegedly  due  
to  the  negligent  conduct  of  Zelo’s,  it  has  standing  to  bring  a  
dram  shop  claim  against  Zelo’s.   See  Ono,  62  Haw.  at  134-41,  612  
P.2d  at  537-41.   Under  the  facts  of  this  case  and  the  holding  of  
Bertelmann,  only  Solomon,  the  driver,  would  be  precluded  from  
recovering  from  Zelo’s.   9
B. The complicity defense is not applicable in this 
jurisdiction because it conflicts with the comparative 
negligence statute. 
The
  complicity  defense  bars   an  individual  from  
asserting  a  dram  shop  claim  if  the  individual  “actively  
contributed  to  or  procured  the  intoxication  of”  the  drunk  
driver.   Zelo’s,  141  Hawaiʻi  at  379,  409  P.3d  at  783.   The  
comparative  negligence  defense  applicable  in  this  jurisdiction  
is  inconsistent  with  the  complicity  defense.   Pursuant  to  HRS   
§  663-31(a),  claims  arising  from  acts  of  negligence  that  result  
“in  death  or  in  injury  to  person  or  property”  are  not  barred  by  
the  negligence  of  the  injured  plaintiff  unless  his  or  her  
That is not to say, however, that a passenger injured in a drunk 
driving accident is precluded as a matter of law from being found to be more 
responsible than a commercial supplier of liquor under our general modified 
comparative negligence rules. Accordingly, we agree with the ICA that a 
passenger’s own intoxication does not “automatically exclude[] him from the 
class of innocent third parties protected by the dram shop cause of action.”

negligence  is  greater  than  that  of  the  individual  against  whom  
recovery  is  sought.    The  complicity  defense  conflicts  with  HRS  
§  663-31(a)  because  it  bars  a  potential  plaintiff  from  asserting   
a  negligence  claim  against  a  liquor  licensee  per  se  if  the  
plaintiff  “actively  contributed  to  or  procured  the  intoxication  
of”  the  individual  that  caused  the  plaintiff’s  injury,  10
10  HRS  §  663-31   provides:  
(a)   Contributory  negligence  shall  not  bar  recovery  in  any  
action  by  any  person  or  the  person’s  legal  representative  
to  recover  damages  for  negligence  resulting  in  death  or  in  
injury  to  person  or  property,  if  such  negligence  was  not  
greater  than  the  negligence  of  the  person  or  in  the  case  of  
more  than  one  person,  the  aggregate  negligence  of  such  
persons  against  whom  recovery  is  sought,  but  any  damages  
allowed  shall  be  diminished  in  proportion  to  the  amount  of  
negligence  attributable  to  the  person  for  whose  injury,  
damage  or  death  recovery  is  made.  
 
(b)   In  any  action  to  which  subsection  (a)  of  this  section  
applies,  the  court,  in  a  nonjury  trial,  shall  make  findings  
of  fact  or,  in  a  jury  trial,  the  jury  shall  return  a  
special  verdict  which  shall  state:  
 
(1)   The  amount  of  the  damages  which  would  have  been  
recoverable  if  there  had  been  no  contributory  
negligence;  and  
 
(2)   The  degree  of  negligence  of  each  party,  
expressed  as  a  percentage.  
 
(c)   Upon  the  making  of  the  findings  of  fact  or  the  return  
of  a  special  verdict,  as  is  contemplated  by  subsection  (b)  
above,  the  court  shall  reduce  the  amount  of  the  award  in  
proportion  to  the  amount  of  negligence  attributable  to  the  
person  for  whose  injury,  damage  or  death  recovery  is  made;  
provided  that  if  the  said  proportion  is  greater  than  the  
negligence  of  the  person  or  in  the  case  of  more  than  one  
person,  the  aggregate  negligence  of  such  persons  against  
whom  recovery  is  sought,  the  court  will  enter  a  judgment  
for  the  defendant.  
 
(d)   T he  court  shall  instruct  the  jury  regarding  the  law  of  
comparative  negligence  where  appropriate.

14 regardless of whether the plaintiff’s negligence is greater tha
n 
that of the liquor licensee.  Zelo’s, 141 Hawai ʻi at 379, 409 
P.3d at 783.  Therefore, the complicity defense would bar 
recovery to an injured individual who would otherwise be able to 
recover pursuant to the comparative negligence statute, HRS § 
663-31.  Accordingly, evidence that Kristerpher “actively 
contributed to or procured the intoxication of Solomon” is 
relevant to the jury’s comparison of the degree of negligence 
between Kristerpher and Zelo’s, but any “active” contribution by 
him does not bar Kristerpher’s Estate from raising a dram shop 
claim against Zelo’s.  Id. 
C. There are genuine issues of material fact regarding 
whether Kristerpher’s negligence exceeded that of Zelo’s. 
Summary judgment is required if, viewing the evidence 
in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, “there is 
“no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving 
party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Querubin, 
107 Hawai ʻi at 56, 109 P.3d at 697 (quoting Durette, 105 Hawai ʻi 
at 501, 100 P.3d at 71).  Per Zelo’s’ comparative negligence 
defense—and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to 
Kristerpher’s Estate—genuine issues of material fact exist as to 
whether Zelo’s’ negligence exceeded Kristerpher’s.  The record 
contains evidence that could support a finding that Zelo’s was 
negligent.  Before arriving at Sushi & Blues, Solomon drank two            
   IV. Conclusion 
  Viewing  the  evidence  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  
the  non-moving  party,  there  are  genuine  issues  of  material  fact  
as  to  whether  Kristerpher’s  negligence  was  greater  than  that  of  
Zelo’s.   Therefore,  we  affirm  the  ICA’s  January  30,  2018  
judgment  on  appeal  vacating  the  circuit  court’s  June  7,  2013  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
beers  and  smoked  marijuana.   Evidence  that  Solomon  had  been  
drinking  and  smoking  before  he  arrived  at  Sushi  &  Blues  
indicates  that  Zelo’s  may  have  known,  or  had  reason  to  know,  
that  Solomon  was  under  the  influence  of  an  intoxicant  when  it  
served  him  alcohol.   See  Ono,  62  Haw.  at  140,  612  P.2d  at  540.   
The  record  also  contains  evidence  that  Kristerpher  may  have  been  
negligent.   Solomon  testified  in  his  deposition  that  Kristerpher  
purchased  and  smoked  marijuana  and  drank  beers  with  Solomon  at  
Hanalei  Bay  and  purchased  one  “strong”  mixed  drink  which  he  
shared  with  Solomon  at  Sushi  &  Blues  before  riding  as  a  
passenger  in  a  car  driven  by  Solomon.   Because  Kristerpher  
accepted  a  ride  from  an  individual  with  whom  he  had  been  
consuming  intoxicants,  a  jury  could  find  that  Kristerpher  was  
negligent.   However,  viewed  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  
Kristerpher’s  Estate,  the  evidence  in  the  record  contains  a  
genuine  issue  of  material  fact  as  to  the  degree  of  negligence  
attributable  to  Kristerpher  and  Zelo’s,  and  whether  Kristerpher  
engaged  in  conduct  that  was  more  negligent  than  that  of  Zelo’s.
