SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ., 
with 
Nakayama, J., dissenting, with whom Recktenwald, C.J., joins)  
 
Petitioners/Plaintiffs-Appellants John Hasircoglu 
(“Hasircoglu”) and Maria Hasircoglu  seek review of the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (“ICA”) July 26, 2016 Judgment on 
Appeal, entered pursuant to its June 30, 2016 Memorandum 
Opinion.  
 
 
  FOPCO was the general contractor on the project through an 
August 27, 2008 Prime Contract with a department of the State of 
Hawaii.  On that date, along with the signed contract, a 
representative for the State of Hawai i sent a letter to FOPCO, 
asking it to submit the “[n]ame of superintendent or qualified 
representative on the job site” as required by contract 
specifications.   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(“Clark”) when a large spool holding cables weighing 2,500 
pounds fell off its spool holder, hitting Hasircoglu’s head, 
neck, and back. 
In response, on its letterhead, FOPCO identified the 
following three people as the “PROJECT SUPERINTENDENT AND KEY PERSONNEL”: Dennis McElrath, as the “Project Manager,” Clark as 
“Project Superintendent,” and Michael Estes as “QA/ QC Health and 
Safety Manager.” McElrath was the President of FOPCO; Estes was 
the President of and was employed by T&M.  Clark was also a T&M 
employee. Neither Estes nor Clark were employees of FOPCO.   The 
subcontract between FOPCO and T&M  was executed by McElrath for 
FOPCO and Estes for T&M.  The October 8, 2008 subcontract called 
for T&M to undertake “complete performance” of the work FOPCO 
was to provide under the Prime Contract, and refers back to 
FOPCO’s Prime Contract and its supplemental documents.

  ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The Circuit Cour t of the Second Circuit (“circuit court”)1 
granted summary judgment in favor of FOPCO on all claims. The 
ICA affirmed on the grounds that Estes and Clark were not agents 
of FOPCO and that FOPCO could therefore not be held vicariously 
liable for their alleged negligence.  Hasircoglu v. FOPCO, Inc., 
CAAP-13-0002064 (App. June 30, 2016) (mem.)  We conclude that the circuit court and ICA erred under standards applicable to 
summary judgment motions. 
FOPCO’s response to the State of Hawaii identifying Clark 
and  Estes as “project superintendent and key personnel” raises a 
genuine issue of material fact as to whether there was an agency 
relationship between FOPCO and Estes and/or Clark based on actual express or implied authority. 
See  Cho Mark Oriental Food, 
Ltd. v. K&K Intern. , 73 Haw. 509, 515-16, 836 P.2d 1057, 1061-62 
(1992). Although Clark and Estes were employed by T&M, pursuant 
to Section 226 of the Restatement (Second) of Agency (1958), “A 
person may be the servant of two masters, not joint employers, 
at one time as to one act, if the service to one does not 
involve abandonment of the service to the other.” Accordingly, based on the instant record showing a lack of a genuine issue of 
material fact, summary judgment was proper as to plaintiffs’ 
product liability claims in Counts III, IV, and V; it was error  
to grant summary judgment in favor of FOPCO on the negligence

claims in Counts I and II of the February 22, 2011 complaint as 
well as on Maria Hasircoglu’s emotional distress and consortium 
claims in Count VII. As there was no genuine issue of material 
fact, summary judgment was proper on the claim for punitive 
damages in Count VIII. Therefore,  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s July 26, 2016 Judgment 
on Appeal, filed pursuant to its June 30, 2016 Memor
andum 
Opinion, is vacated in part as to Counts I, II, and VII of the 
complaint, and otherwise affirmed, and the case is remanded to 
the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this 
summary disposition order.
