RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, POLLACK, AND WILSON JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J. 

At issue in this case is the authority of a trial 
court to condition the voluntary dismissal of a complaint upon 
the plaintiff’s payment of the defendant’s attorney’s fees and 
costs. 
We hold that such authority exists under the Hawai i 
District Rules of Civil Procedure (HDCRCP) Rule 41(a)(2) (1996),  
 
 
   
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
but it is subject to certain procedural requirements. 
Additionally, the exercise of this authority must comport with 
equitable factors to accord substantial justice to the parties. 
I. BACKGROUND 
1. District Court Complaint 
On October 26, 2012, Lettie Tagupa, pro se, filed a 
standard form one-page complaint (Complaint) against VIPDesk in 
the District Court of the Third Circuit (district court). The Complaint asserted that “[o]n or about Jun 2010-Sep 2011, 
Defendant(s) owed money to Plaintiff(s) as follows: For time 
spent taking photos, creating, researching and writing blogs on 
travel recommendations and travel information for the sole 
purpose of supporting VIPdesk’s marketing efforts.” The 
Complaint stated that the district court “ha[d] jurisdiction 
over this matter and venue [was] proper.” 
In the Complaint, Tagupa initially indicated that the 
amount claimed was $35,000 and asked for judgment in that amount, but a handwritten amendment to her Complaint reduced the 
amount to $25,000.

2. Tagupa’s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of
Subject Matter Jurisdiction 
On May 8, 2013, Tagupa, with newly acquired legal 
representation,1 filed a motion to dismiss the case for lack of 
subject matter jurisdiction (motion to dismiss) pursuant to 
Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rules 7, 9, and 
12(b)(1).2 Tagupa asserted that the district court did not have 
jurisdiction “over the subject matter of th[e] case” because her 
claims “derive from violations of federal law--the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 [FLSA], 29 USC 201 et. seq.” Tagupa 
acknowledged that she filed the case, pro se, in the wrong 
court, and attached a “draft lawsuit for the correct court,” 
i.e., the United States District Court for the District of 
Hawaii, to her motion to dismiss. 
VIPdesk filed a memorandum in opposition to Tagupa’s 
motion to dismiss in which it argued that the district court had 
jurisdiction over Tagupa’s claims. VIPdesk maintained that

was filed on May 8, 2013. 
2 HRCP Rule 7 (2000) pertains to the form of motions, and HRCP Rule
9 (2000) pertains to pleading special matters. HRCP Rule 12(b) (2000)
provides in relevant part: 
Every defense, in law or fact, to a claim for relief in anypleading, whether a claim, counterclaim, cross- claim, or 
third-party claim, shall be asserted in the responsive 
pleading thereto if one is required, except that thefollowing defenses may at the option of the pleader be made 
by motion: (1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter
. . . .

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Tagupa’s Complaint alleged claims that could arise solely out of 
Hawaii state law and that even if Tagupa intended to pursue a 
FLSA claim, the district court had subject matter jurisdiction 
over such a claim. Alternatively, VIPdesk requested, pursuant 
to the HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2),3 that if the Court granted Tagupa’s 
motion to dismiss, the dismissal should be with prejudice and conditioned upon Tagupa’s payment of the attorney’s fees and 
costs incurred by VIPdesk in the case. 
3. District Court’s Orders and Judgment 
At a hearing on May 23, 2013, the district court 
granted Tagupa’s motion to dismiss without prejudice, basing its decision not on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, but, rather, “on [Tagupa] wanting to file [the] case in federal court 
instead of state court.”
4 
3 HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2) provides as follows: 
Except as provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision of
this rule, an action shall not be dismissed at the
plaintiff’s instance save upon order of the court and upon
such terms and conditions as the court deems proper. If a 
counterclaim has been pleaded by a defendant prior to the
service upon that defendant of the plaintiff’s motion todismiss, the action shall not be dismissed against the
defendant’s objection unless the counterclaim can remain
pending for independent adjudication by the court. Unless 
otherwise specified in the order, a dismissal under this
paragraph is without prejudice.

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
At the hearing, Tagupa’s counsel requested that no 
attorney’s fees and costs be awarded to VIPdesk in light of 
Tagupa’s pro se status at the time that she filed the Complaint. 
The district court found that Tagupa “admittedly filed [the 
case] in the wrong court” and expressed concern that “if pro se 
plaintiffs file complaints [and] the defendant hires an attorney 
to defend and spends a lot of time on the case [and] then 
plaintiff decides to get counsel [and] . . . then states that they would like to file this claim in federal court, the 
defendant has incurred the expense of hiring an attorney to 
prepare it’s [sic] defense.” The court concluded, “Defendant 
should not have to bear the expense because [Tagupa] filed in 
the wrong court.” 
At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court 
awarded VIPdesk attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to HDCRCP 
Rule 41(a)(2). The district court subsequently filed its order 
granting Tagupa’s motion to dismiss on June 4, 2013. The order stated that VIPdesk “is to be awarded reasonable attorney’s fees 
and costs incurred in defending this case in this Court” and 
instructed VIPdesk to file a declaration with its attorney’s 
fees incurred by June 3, 2013, and for Tagupa to file a response 
or objection within ten days of receipt of VIPdesk’s 
declaration. The order stated that the court would “decide the 
5
  
 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
issue of [VIPdesk’s] attorney fees and costs to be awarded via 
non-hearing motion.” 
On June 5, 2013, VIPdesk filed its motion for 
attorney’s fees (attorney’s fees motion) in which it maintained 
that it “incurred a total of $16,800.41 in attorney’s fees 
(inclusive of general excise taxes) and $288.87 in costs 
defending this case in this Court.” Tagupa filed her memorandum 
in opposition on June 12, 2014. In her memorandum, Tagupa argued that VIPdesk should not be awarded attorney’s fees as 
VIPdesk had not prevailed in the action, and there “ha[d] been 
no determination by this Court that [Tagupa’s] legal claims are 
unreasonable, frivolous, meritless or vexatious.” Tagupa 
contended that the “work performed by [VIPdesk] will be used by 
[VIPdesk] in the furtherance of this case in Federal Court,” 
VIPdesk “will use the same discovery in the Federal Court case,” 
and VIPdesk was not prejudiced by the dismissal. 
On June 17, 2013, the district court issued an Order 
Awarding Attorney’s Fees, in which it granted VIPDesk’s nonhearing attorney’s fees motion and awarded VIPdesk the entire 
amount requested in the amount of $
16,800.41 “as reaasonable 
attorney’s fees” and $288.87 in costs, for a total amount of $17,089.28. The district court handwrote on the Order Awarding 
Attorney’s Fees that “pursuant to HDCRCP 41(a)(2) and [Hawaiʻ i 
Revised Statutes (HRS)] § 607-14.5[, the] Court finds that the 
6
  
 
 
    
                         
      
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Plaintiff’s claim for jurisdiction amount was frivolous under 
Section 607-14.5(b).”5  On July 18, 2013, Tagupa filed a notice 
of appeal to the ICA from the Judgment filed on June 17, 2013. 
II. Appellate Proceedings 
A. Briefs 
In her Opening Brief, Tagupa argued that the district 
court erred in its Order Awarding Attorney’s Fees. 
Tagupa 
contended that the district court granted VIPdesk’s attorney’s fees and costs prematurely, before the merits of the case had 
been decided and before a prevailing party was properly 
identified. 
Tagupa noted that the district court awarded 
attorney’s fees pursuant to HDCRCP 41(a)(2) and HRS § 607-14.5 
(Supp. 2013) even though VIPdesk “cited only rules 7(b) and 
41(a)(2) [of the HDCRCP] as the basis for granting attorney’s 
fees.” Tagupa argued that to award attorney’s fees under HRS § 
5 HRS § 607-14.5(b) (Supp. 1999) provides, in relevant part: 
(b) In determining the award of attorneys’ fees and costs
and the amounts to be awarded, the court must find in
writing that all or a portion of the claims or defenses
made by the party are frivolous and are not reasonably
supported by the facts and the law in the civil action. In
determining whether claims or defenses are frivolous, thecourt may consider whether the party alleging that the 
claims or defenses are frivolous had submitted to the partyasserting the claims or defenses a request for their
withdrawal as provided in subsection (c). If the court
determines that only a portion of the claims or defensesmade by the party are frivolous, the court shall determine
a reasonable sum for attorneys’ fees and costs in relation
to the frivolous claims or defenses. 
7
  
 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
607-14.5, the court must find, in writing, that all or a portion 
of the claims or defenses made by the party were frivolous and 
not reasonably supported by the facts and the law in the civil 
action. Tagupa contended that despite the district court’s 
authority to award attorney’s fees and costs, the fact that she 
revised her Complaint prior to filing “does not, in and of 
itself, demonstrate that [her] claim against [VIPdesk] was 
‘manifestly and palpably without merit.’” 
Tagupa stated that her Complaint had been refiled in 
the federal district court as a FLSA class action and that it was, at that time, pending trial. Tagupa argued that based on 
the pending nature of the claim in federal court, the district 
court had no basis to make a determination as to whether her 
claim was frivolous, and, therefore, the district court abused 
its discretion in granting attorney’s fees pursuant to HRS § 
607-14.5. 
Tagupa further claimed that the district court was 
“simply penalizing [Tagupa], a pro se party, for filing her complaint in the wrong court” and that this was not a proper 
purpose for an award of attorney’s fees. Lastly, Tagupa argued 
that, as a general rule, each party is responsible for paying 
his or her own litigation expenses. 
VIPdesk filed its Answering Brief, which requested 
that the Order Awarding Attorney’s Fees and Judgment be upheld 
8
  
 
 
                           
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
and affirmed on appeal.6 VIPdesk argued that the district court 
did not err in awarding VIPdesk’s attorney’s fees and costs 
under HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2). VIPdesk maintained that in 
considering a dismissal under HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2), a trial 
court should consider the totality of the circumstances, 
including equitable factors such as prejudice to the parties. 
VIPdesk contended that courts typically impose costs and 
attorney’s fees upon the plaintiff in such cases. Thus, VIPdesk argued that the district court was well within its discretion to 
award VIPdesk’s attorney’s fees and costs under HDCRCP Rule 
41(a)(2), based on the record and its findings that VIPdesk 
should not have to bear the expense of preparing its defense 
because Tagupa filed in the wrong court. 
VIPdesk next argued that the district court did not 
err in awarding VIPdesk’s attorney’s fees and costs under HRS § 
607-14.5. VIPdesk noted that the district court satisfied the 
requirements of HRS § 607-14.5 by making a specific finding that Tagupa’s claim regarding the jurisdiction amount in her 
Complaint was frivolous under HRS § 607-14.5(b), and VIPdesk 
asserted that this finding was sufficiently supported by the 
6 Tagupa identified the district court’s Order Awarding Attorney’s
Fees as the alleged error in this case. Attorney’s fees had previously been
awarded by the district court’s June 4, 2013 order granting Tagupa’s motionto dismiss, although no amount had been specified. VIPdesk presented a
counterstatement of Tagupa’s point of error: “Whether the [district court]
erred in awarding [VIPdesk’s] attorney’s fees and costs.” 
9
  
 
 
    
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
record because Tagupa admitted that she intentionally reduced 
the amount of her claim to fall within the jurisdiction of the 
district court. 
VIPdesk also argued that the pendency of Tagupa’s 
federal court claim had no bearing on the issue of attorney’s 
fees because the Order Awarding Attorney’s Fees “was not based 
on the merits of [Tagupa’s] FLSA claim but on the 
‘jurisdictional amount’ of the claims that she brought in the [district court].” Lastly, VIPdesk contended that even if the 
district court erred by awarding VIPdesk attorney’s fees and 
costs under HRS § 607-14.5(b), such error was harmless and did 
not warrant setting aside the Order Awarding Attorney’s Fees 
because the district court was within its discretion to award 
VIPdesk’s attorney’s fees and costs under HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2). 
B. ICA Summary Disposition Order 
The ICA issued its Summary Disposition Order (SDO) on 
August 12, 2014, which affirmed the Judgment and the Order 
Awarding Attorney’s Fees. 
The ICA found that Tagupa’s appeal lacked merit, 
specifically because the district court was expressly authorized under HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2) to condition dismissal of the 
Complaint “upon such terms and conditions as the court deem[ed] 
proper.” The ICA noted that Tagupa provided no argument against 
10
  
 
 
    
  
                         
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the district court’s award of attorney’s fees and costs pursuant 
to HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2). 
The ICA held that “in imposing conditions under HRCP 
Rule 41(a)(2),[7] the court should endeavor to insure that 
substantial justice was accorded to both parties.” In determining whether a plaintiff’s motion for voluntary dismissal 
is proper under HRCP Rule 41(a)(2), the ICA stated that a trial 
court “will consider the expense and inconvenience to the defendant and will deny the motion if the defendant will be 
prejudiced seriously by a dismissal.” (Quoting Moniz v. 
Freitas, 79 Hawaiʻ i 495, 500—01, 904 P.2d 509, 514—15 (1995)) 
(internal quotation mark deleted). The ICA explained that a 
court may additionally examine whether “any harm to the 
defendant may be avoided by imposing terms and conditions on the 
dismissal.” (Quoting id.) (internal quotation mark deleted). 
The ICA concluded that the district court acted within its 
discretion in awarding VIPdesk’s attorney’s fees and costs in 
order to alleviate any prejudice resulting from the dismissal. 
Finally, based on its conclusion that there was no 
abuse of discretion in the award of attorney’s fees pursuant to HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2), the ICA found that it need not reach 
7 The ICA noted that HRCP Rule 41(a)(2) contains text identical to
that of HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2) and that, therefore, case law interpreting HRCP
Rule 41 informed the court in its application of HDCRCP Rule 41 to this case.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Tagupa’s argument that the district court erred by awarding 
VIPdesk’s attorney’s fees and costs under HRS § 607-14.5 because 
any alleged error in the district court’s application of HRS § 
607-14.5 would be harmless based on HDCRCP Rule 61.8 The ICA’s 
Judgment on Appeal affirmed the Order Awarding Attorney’s Fees. 
C. Application for Writ of Certiorari 
On October 30, 2014, Tagupa filed her Application 
seeking review of the ICA’s SDO. Tagupa argues that there is no 
supporting authority under Hawai i law providing that HDCRCP Rule 
41(a)(2) constitutes authorization for an award of attorneys’ 
fees and costs and that the rule only “applies to a ‘voluntary 
dismissal’ initiated by a plaintiff.” Tagupa contends that VIPdesk, rather than Tagupa, invoked HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2) in 
this case and that the court sua sponte converted her motion to 
dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under 
HDCRCP Rule 12(b)(1) to a motion for dismissal under Rule 
41(a)(2). Tagupa argues that, in awarding attorney’s fees under 
8 HDCRCP Rule 61 (1996) provides: 
HARMLESS ERROR. 
No error in either the admission or the exclusion of 
evidence and no error or defect in any ruling or order orin anything done or omitted by the court or by any of the
parties is ground for granting a new trial or for vacating,
modifying, or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order,
unless refusal to take such action appears to the court
inconsistent with substantial justice. The court at everystage of the proceeding must disregard any error or defect
in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial
rights of the parties.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Rule 41(a)(2), the district court appeared “to confuse or 
conflate the issue of ‘prejudice’ to VIP[d]esk with that 
concerning its request for litigation expenses already 
incurred.” 
Tagupa further argues that, contrary to HDCRCP Rule 
78,9 the district court “reserved the question of the amount of 
attorney’s fees to a non-hearing motion after appropriate submissions by the parties on the issue only.” Tagupa contends that had the district court conducted an “in-person hearing on 
the amount of attorney’s fees and costs,” it would have had “the 
opportunity to withdraw [its] converted ‘voluntary’ dismissal 
motion or otherwise have the Order set aside on the grounds that 
the amount of the fees and costs imposed would be too onerous.” 
Tagupa also asserts that the district court erred by ruling that 
her downward adjustment of her monetary claim was frivolous.
10 
9 HDCRCP Rule 78 (1996) states as follows: 
Unless local conditions make it impracticable, each
district court shall establish regular times and places, atintervals sufficiently frequent for the prompt dispatch of 
business, at which motions requiring notice and hearing maybe heard and disposed of; but the judge at any time or
place and on such notice, if any, as the judge considers
reasonable may make orders for the advancement, conduct,and hearing of actions. 
To expedite its business, the court may make provisions by
rule or order for the submission and determination of 
motions without oral hearing upon brief written statements
of reasons in support and opposition. 
10 Tagupa also contends that permitting attorney’s fees for non­
movants in voluntary dismissal actions without any specific limitation on theamount awarded is contrary to public policy. Tagupa maintains that no

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
VIPdesk filed a Response to Tagupa’s Application, 
asking that Tagupa’s Application be denied. VIPdesk argues that 
the ICA did not err in affirming the district court’s award of 
attorney’s fees and costs under HDCRCP 41(a)(2). VIPdesk 
maintains that while there are not any Hawai i cases that discuss 
an award of attorney’s fees and costs under HDCRCP 41(a)(2), 
there is ample authority for a court’s ability to impose 
conditions on a plaintiff’s voluntary dismissal of her case. 
VIPdesk argues that federal courts applying FRCP Rule 41(a)(2), 
which is virtually identical to HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2), have held 
that the rule affords courts broad discretion in imposing 
appropriate conditions in the dismissal of a case, including the payment of attorney’s fees and costs. 
III. DISCUSSION 
Tagupa’s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter 
jurisdiction was converted by the district court into a voluntary dismissal by order of the court pursuant to HDCRCP 
(. . . continued)
limitation will discourage otherwise meritorious voluntary dismissals by
plaintiffs, resulting in an unnecessary cluttering of the district court
docket. We do not address this contention because it was not raised at the district court or the ICA, as Tagupa acknowledges in her Application, and,
therefore, was waived. See Kemp v. State of Haw. Child Support Enforcement 
Agency, 111 Hawaiʻ i 367, 391, 141 P.3d 1014, 1038 (2006) (holding that an
argument not raised at the trial court “will be deemed to have been waived on
appeal”); Enoka v. AIG Haw. Ins. Co., 109 Hawaiʻ i 537, 546, 128 P.3d 850, 859
(2006) (accord).

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Rule 41(a)(2).11 The district court granted the motion upon the 
condition that Tagupa pay VIPdesk’s attorney’s fees. 
In 
imposing this condition, the district court relied upon HDCRCP 
Rule 41(a)(2) and HRS § 607-14.5. 
Three issues are presented to this court: (1) whether 
the district court, after converting Tagupa’s motion to a 
request for a voluntary dismissal under HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2), 
possessed the authority to impose payment of attorney’s fees as a condition of the dismissal; (2) whether Tagupa was improperly 
deprived of the opportunity to withdraw her motion to dismiss or 
otherwise have the Order set aside on the grounds that the 
amount of the fees and costs imposed would be too onerous; and 
(3) whether the Complaint was frivolous under HRS § 607-14.5, 
which triggered a separate basis for the award of attorney’s 
fees and costs. 
11 Initially, Tagupa moved, “pursuant to rules 7, 9, [and] 12(b)(1)”
of the HRCP, to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
However, Rule 12, under both the HRCP and the HDCRCP, governs defenses that
may be asserted in pleadings responsive to a complaint and does not providerelief for a plaintiff seeking to dismiss one’s own claim. In any event, as
VIPdesk argued, the district court did have jurisdiction over Tagupa’s claim 
because the Complaint did not allege any federal causes of action, and the
district court had subject matter jurisdiction over Tagupa’s state law causes
of action. See, e.g., HRS § 387- 12(c) (Supp. 1999) (wage and hour claims 
“may be maintained in any court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more
employees”). Even if Tagupa had alleged a claim under the FLSA, as she
argued in her motion to dismiss, FLSA claims may be pursued in both federal
and state courts and, thus, the district court would maintain subject matter
jurisdiction over her purported FLSA claim. See 29 U.S.C. § 216(b) (2012) (a 
FLSA action may be “maintained against any employer . . . in any Federal or
State Court of competent jurisdiction”). Thus, Tagupa’s motion to dismiss 
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction could have been denied on the merits.

A. Payment of Attorney’s Fees as a Condition for Voluntary
Dismissal under HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2) 
HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2),12 in relevant part, provides 
that “an action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff’s 
instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper.” Dismissal under HDCRCP 
Rule 41(a)(2) is without prejudice “[u]nless otherwise specified 
in the order.” 
  Generally, in evaluating a motion for voluntary 
dismissal under Rule 41(a)(2), the court “will consider the expense and inconvenience to the defendant and will deny the 
motion if the defendant will be prejudiced seriously by a 
12 HDCRCP Rule 41(a) (1996) provides the following: 
(a) Voluntary dismissal: Effect thereof. 
(1) By plaintiff; by stipulation. An action may be dismissed by
the plaintiff without order of court (i) by filing a notice
of dismissal at any time before the return date as provided
in Rule 12(a) or service by the adverse party of an answer or
of a motion for summary judgment, or (ii) by filing a
stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared in the action. Unless otherwise stated in the notice
of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without
prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal operates as an
adjudication upon the merits when filed by a plaintiff who
has once dismissed in any court of the United States, or ofany state, territory or insular possession of the United
States an action based on or including the same claim. 
(2) By order of court. Except as provided in paragraph (1) of
this subdivision of this rule, an action shall not be
dismissed at the plaintiff’s instance save upon order of thecourt and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems
proper. If a counterclaim has been pleaded by a defendant
prior to the service upon that defendant of the plaintiff’ s 
motion to dismiss, the action shall not be dismissed against the defendant’s objection unless the counterclaim can remainpending for independent adjudication by the court. Unless
otherwise specified in the order, a dismissal under this
paragraph is without prejudice.

Procedure § 2364 (2d ed. 1994) [hereinafter Federal Practice 2d]). Alternatively, if the court finds that the defendant will 
be prejudiced by dismissal, in lieu of denying the motion to 
dismiss, “[t]he court will examine the possibility that any harm 
to the defendant may be avoided by imposing terms and conditions 
on the dismissal.” Id. The trial court has discretion to 
impose “such terms and conditions as the court deems proper,” considering the totality of the circumstances “to insure that 
substantial justice is accorded to both parties.” Id. (emphasis 
added); HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2). 
While this court has not previously addressed whether 
attorney’s fees may be imposed as a term or condition of voluntary dismissal under HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2), there is 
abundant authority interpreting comparable provisions of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP),
13 and, to a lesser 
extent, the Hawai i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP),14 which 
addresses this issue. 
13 FRCP Rule 41(a)(2) states, in relevant part, “Except as provided 
in Rule 41(a)(1), an action may be dismissed at the plaintiff’s request only 
by court order, on terms that the court considers proper.” (Emphasis added). 
14 HRCP Rule 41(a)(2) and HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2) are identical and
state, in relevant part, “Except as provided in paragraph (1) of this
subdivision of this rule, an action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff's
instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Since HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2) is identical to HRCP Rule 
41(a)(2) (2012) and essentially identical to FRCP Rule 41(a)(2) 
(2010), cases interpreting and applying HRCP Rule 41(a)(2) and 
FRCP Rule 41(a)(2) may be consulted for guidance in interpreting 
HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2). See Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri 
Prods., 86 Hawai i 214, 252, 948 P.2d 1055, 1093 (1997) (holding 
that authorities interpreting a federal rule of civil procedure 
are highly persuasive in interpreting an essentially identical 
Hawaiʻi rule of civil procedure where there is an absence of case 
law interpreting the latter); accord State v. Shannon, 118 
Hawaii 15, 40, 185 P.3d 200, 225 (2008). 
Although the two Hawai i cases that address the 
imposition of terms and conditions under HRCP Rule 41(a)(2) did 
not consider whether attorney’s fees may be imposed as a 
condition of voluntary dismissal, both support the conclusion 
that attorney’s fees may be properly imposed as a condition of 
dismissal under HRCP Rule 41(a)(2). See Sapp v. Wong, 3 Haw. 
App. 509, 654 P.2d 883 (1982); Moniz, 79 Hawai i 495, 904 P.2d 
509 (1995).

dismissal under HRCP Rule 41(a)(2) and noted in a supporting

memorandum that they intended to pursue their claims in federal 
court rather than in state court. Id. at 511, 654 P.2d at 885. 
Although the plaintiffs submitted a proposed order to dismiss the case without prejudice, the trial court ultimately ordered 
that the case be dismissed with prejudice. Id. at 512—13, 654 
P.2d at 885—86. In ordering this disposition, the trial court 
considered the circumstances of the case and found that the 
defendant would be unduly prejudiced if the plaintiffs were permitted to refile the case in state court. Id. The 
plaintiffs appealed, arguing that the trial court erred by imposing a “with prejudice” condition on their voluntary 
dismissal. Id. The ICA concluded that the trial court was 
permitted to order, as a condition under HRCP Rule 41(a)(2), the case to be dismissed with prejudice; however, the ICA remanded 
the case to the trial court to allow the plaintiffs the 
opportunity to withdraw their motion.
15 Id. at 514, 654 P.2d at 
887. 
15 In finding that dismissal with prejudice was warranted by the
circumstances of the case, the ICA noted the following facts: 
[P]laintiffs had identical actions pending in federal and
state courts since 1973 and 1974, respectively. . . . Lis 
pendens were filed by plaintiffs in 1974 and since then
have encumbered 44 parcels of real property owned bydefendants. The matter was tried once below and plaintiffs
lost. After reversal and remand, defendants were prepared
to go to trial again when plaintiffs made their [Rule
41(a)(2)] motion. Defendants have undoubtedly been put to
great expense in this matter alone. We find that these circumstances amount to a quantum of prejudice to the 
defendant that supports the action of the court below.

In Moniz, this court considered whether the trial 
court had the authority to reinstate an arbitration award as a 
condition of voluntary dismissal under HRCP Rule 41(a)(2). 
Moniz, 79 Hawai i at 500—01, 904 P.2d at 514—15. The court noted 
that “when imposing such conditions, a trial court should 
consider the totality of the circumstances consistent with 
substantial justice, taking into account equitable factors such 
as prejudice to either party.” Id. Under the facts of that 
case, we held that the trial court had discretion to reinstate an arbitration award as a condition of dismissal under HRCP Rule 
41(a)(2). Id. 
In light of the conditions imposed under Sapp and 
Moniz, including dismissal with prejudice, which is the harshest of sanctions,
16 we hold that it is within the discretion of the 
trial court to require the payment of attorney’s fees as a condition of dismissal under HRCP Rule 41(a)(2). This 
conclusion is consistent with federal courts that have held that 
attorney’s fees may be properly awarded as a term of voluntary 
dismissal under FRCP Rule 41(a)(2). See 9 Charles Alan Wright &

3d]).17 
We note that although the trial court is permitted to 
award attorney’s fees upon voluntary dismissal under FRCP Rule 
41(a)(2), the court is not obligated to do so. See Stevedoring 
Servs. of Am. v. Armilla Int’l B.V., 889 F.2d 919, 921 (9th Cir. 
1989) (payment of attorney’s fees is not a prerequisite to an order granting voluntary dismissal); DWG Corp. v. Granada Inv., 
Inc., 962 F.2d 1201, 1202 (6th Cir. 1992) (noting that “no 
requirement or rule” mandating the award of attorney’s fees for 
voluntary dismissals “exists in this or in any other Circuit”

awarded”); N.Y., C & St. L.R. Co. v. Vardaman, 181 F.2d 769,

B. Notice and Opportunity to Withdraw 
While a trial court has discretion to impose terms and 
conditions when granting a motion for voluntary dismissal under 
Rule 41(a)(2), courts of Hawaiʻ i and other jurisdictions provide 
the plaintiff with an opportunity to withdraw the motion to 
17 See also Westlands Water Dist. v. United States, 100 F.3d 94, 97
(9th Cir. 1996) (stating that the “defendants’ interests can be protected by
conditioning the dismissal without prejudice upon the payment of appropriate 
costs and attorney fees”); Pontenberg v. Bos. Scientific Corp., 252 F.3d 
1253, 1260 (11th Cir. 2001) (district court acted within its discretion by
conditioning the dismissal on the payment of costs to defendant should 
plaintiff refile the case).

dismiss in light of the conditions imposed “to insure that 
substantial justice is accorded to both parties.” Moniz, 79 
Hawaii at 500, 904 P.2d at 514 (quoting 9 Wright & Miller, 
Federal Practice 2d § 2364) (emphasis added). 
When a plaintiff requests voluntary dismissal but does 
not mention conditions, the trial court can specify conditions 
on which it will allow dismissal, and “[i]f the conditions are 
too onerous, the plaintiff need not accept the dismissal on 
those terms.” Id. Not affording the plaintiff an opportunity 
to withdraw the motion for voluntary dismissal is tantamount to an abuse of discretion. See Sapp, 3 Haw. App. 509, 654 P.2d 
883. In Sapp, discussed supra, the plaintiffs had identical 
actions pending in both state and federal courts for nearly a 
decade. Sapp, 3 Haw. App. at 512—13, 654 P.2d at 885—86. In 
the state action, the plaintiffs lost at trial and appealed. 
Id. On appeal, the judgment was vacated and the case was 
remanded for a new trial. Id. On remand, the plaintiffs 
opposed the defendants’ motion to set a trial date and 
subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the action without prejudice under HRCP Rule 41(a)(2). Id. The trial court 
granted the plaintiffs’ Rule 41(a)(2) motion but conditioned the dismissal as being with prejudice. Id. The plaintiffs 
appealed, arguing that the trial court erred by imposing a “with prejudice” condition on the dismissal. Id.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The ICA found that the “defendants ha[d] undoubtedly 
been put to great expense in this matter” and “that [the] 
circumstances [of the case] amount to a quantum of prejudice to 
the defendant.” Id. Thus, the ICA concluded that the trial 
court was permitted to order, as a condition under HRCP Rule 41(a)(2), that the case be dismissed with prejudice. Id. 
However, the ICA found that the “conditions imposed were not requested by [the] plaintiffs and they were not given the opportunity to choose between accepting the condition or 
proceeding with the case.” Id. at 514, 654 P.2d at 887. The 
ICA “deem[ed] this omission to be an abuse of discretion” and 
remanded the case “to allow [the] plaintiffs to withdraw their 
[Rule 41(a)(2)] motion if they [felt] the condition [was] too 
onerous.”
18 Id. 
The legal principle enunciated by the Sapp court--that 
plaintiffs should be given notice of the conditions that the 
court intends to impose upon dismissal, if any, and the opportunity to withdraw the request for dismissal if a plaintiff 
finds the conditions to be unacceptable--is broadly supported by 
cases from other jurisdictions. See Lau v. Glendora Unified 
18 Although the ICA noted that “[i]t is a better practice when 
imposing conditions under Rule 41(a)(2), HCRP, to allow [the] plaintiff the
option not to dismiss if he feels that the conditions are too onerous,”Sapp, 3 Haw. App. at 514, 654 P.2d at 887, the ICA determined that it was an 
abuse of discretion not to have allowed the plaintiff an opportunity to 
withdraw the motion to dismiss.

fees and costs, when granting a motion for voluntary dismissal

In this case, during the hearing on Tagupa’s motion to 
dismiss, the court inquired as to Tagupa’s position on VIPdesk’s 
motion for attorney’s fees should the court grant the motion to dismiss. Tagupa requested that she not be required to pay 
VIPdesk’s attorney’s fees because she inadvertently commenced 
her action in the wrong court. Tagupa’s attorney represented to 
the district court that the action would be reinstituted in 
federal court once it was dismissed by the district court. The

1229, 1240 n.16 (2002) (“[T]he power to stay proceedings is incidental to the

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
district court granted the motion to dismiss and awarded VIPdesk 
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to Rule 41. 
After the hearing, the court filed its order granting 
Tagupa’s motion to dismiss, in which the court noted, inter 
alia, that VIPdesk “is to be awarded reasonable attorney’s fees 
and costs incurred in defending this case in this court.” 
Thereafter, VIPdesk indicated that it incurred a total of 
$16,800.41 in attorney’s fees (inclusive of general excise taxes) and $288.87 in costs defending the case in the district 
court. Tagupa filed an opposition pleading, and the court 
awarded the full amount of VIPdesk’s requested fees and costs. 
As Tagupa argued in her Application, because the court 
did not conduct a hearing on the amount of attorney’s fees and 
costs it imposed upon dismissal of the case, Tagupa did not have 
“the opportunity to withdraw her converted ‘voluntary’ dismissal 
motion or [to] have the Order set aside on the grounds that the 
amount of the fees and costs would be too onerous.” Thus, the district court abused its discretion in the manner of its 
dispostion of the motion to dismiss, and this case must be 
remanded to provide Tagupa with the opportunity to reject the 
terms and conditions of the dismissal order, withdraw the 
motion, and continue litigating the case at the district court, 
or accept the terms and conditions that may be imposed upon 
remand and have the case dismissed without prejudice. See Sapp,

C.	 Attorney’s Fees for Frivolous Claims under HRS § 607-14.5 
As an additional ground for awarding attorney’s fees 
in this case, the judge hand-wrote on the Order Awarding Attorney’s Fees that the fees were awarded “pursuant to HDCRCP 
41(a)(2) and §§ 607-14.5 HRS” and that the “court finds that the 
Plaintiff [sic] claim for jurisdiction amount was frivolous under Section 607-14.5.”
21 
Pursuant to HRS § 607-14.5(a) and (b), to award 
attorney’s fees for a frivolous claim, the court must make “a 
specific finding” in writing “that all or a portion of the 
21	 HRS section 607- 14.5 states, in relevant part:
 
Attorneys' fees and costs in civil actions.
 
(a) In any civil action in this State where a party seeks
money damages or injunctive relief, or both, against
another party, and the case is subsequently decided, the
court may, as it deems just, assess against either party,whether or not the party was a prevailing party, and enter
as part of its order, for which execution may issue, a 
reasonable sum for attorneys’ fees and costs, in an amount to be determined by the court upon a specific finding that 
all or a portion of the party’s claim or defense was
frivolous as provided in subsection (b). 
(a) In determining the award of attorneys’ fees and costs 
and the amounts to be awarded, the court must find in 
writing that all or a portion of the claims or defenses
made by the party are frivolous and are not reasonablysupported by the facts and the law in the civil action. 
(Emphases added). 
27
  
 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
claims . . . made by the party are frivolous and are not 
reasonably supported by the facts and law in the civil action.” 
A frivolous claim is a “claim so manifestly and 
palpably without merit, so as to indicate bad faith on the 
[pleader’s] part such that argument to the court was not 
required.” Coll v. McCarthy, 72 Haw. 20, 29—30, 804 P.2d 881, 
887 (1991) (quoting Kawaihae v. Hawaiian Ins. Cos., 1 Haw. App. 
355, 361, 619 P.2d 1086, 1091 (1980)). A finding of frivolousness is a high bar; it is not enough that a claim be 
without merit, there must be a showing of bad faith. See 
Canalez v. Bob’s Appliance Serv. Ctr., Inc., 89 Hawaiʻ i 292, 300, 
972 P.2d 295, 303 (1999) (in a personal injury action, even 
assuming that the plaintiff’s counsel made untrue or inaccurate 
statements regarding the plaintiff’s injuries, the claim was not 
deemed frivolous because there was no showing of bad faith); Lee 
v. Hawaii Pac. Health, 121 Hawaiʻ i 235, 246—47, 216 P.3d 1258, 
1269—70 (App. 2009) (although the plaintiff’s arguments were 
without merit, the commencement of the action was not frivolous 
because the plaintiff did not act in bad faith). 
Here, other than the court’s handwritten one-sentence 
notation on its order finding Tagupa’s “jurisdiction amount” to 
be frivolous, the court made no other finding, written or 
otherwise, that Tagupa’s claim was frivolous. Additionally, prior to the court’s ruling on this ground, VIPdesk had never 
28
  
 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
claimed that Tagupa’s claim was frivolous; in fact, VIPdesk 
itself asserted that the claim could be brought in either the 
district court or federal court. 
When Tagupa filed her Complaint, pro se, she reduced 
the amount in controversy from $35,000 to $25,000 to bring her 
claim within the district court’s jurisdiction. Although there 
is authority intimating that an excessive and unreasonable 
amount of damages may be an “indication of the frivolous and bad faith nature” of an action, Bright v. Superior Court, 780 F.2d 
766, 722 n.8 (9th Cir. 1986), VIPdesk cites no authority to 
suggest that choosing--for reasons of strategy, expense, or 
otherwise--to claim a lesser amount of damages than Tagupa may 
otherwise be entitled indicates frivolousness or bad faith. 
There is simply no evidence in the record that Tagupa 
filed her complaint and pursued her case in bad faith or that 
the amount of her claim was otherwise frivolous. Inasmuch as 
the record does not support the district court’s conclusion that Tagupa’s claim was frivolous so as to indicate bad faith on the 
pleader’s part such that argument to the court was not required, 
the district court abused its discretion in granting attorney’s 
fees pursuant to HRS § 607-14.5. 
29
  
 
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
D. Remand to the District Court and Guidance in Determining
Fees and Costs 
The district court erred in failing to provide Tagupa 
with the opportunity to withdraw her motion to dismiss. 
Accordingly, we vacate the district court’s Judgment and the ICA 
Judgment on Appeal. Upon remand, the district court must 
determine the amount of attorney’s fees and costs, if any, that 
is justified by the relevant equities in this case so as to 
accomplish substantial justice. See Moniz, 79 Hawai i at 500, 
904 P.2d at 514; McCants v. Ford Motor Co., 781 F.2d 855, 857 
(11th Cir. 1986). Upon being informed of the conditions of a 
dismissal, if any, including the amount of attorney’s fees and 
costs that she must pay VIPdesk, Tagupa will have the opportunity to withdraw the motion to dismiss if she finds the 
conditions unacceptable. See Moniz, 79 Hawai i at 500, 904 P.2d 
at 514; Sapp, 3 Haw. App. at 514, 654 P.2d at 8879; 9 Wright & 
Miller, Federal Practice 3d § 2366, at 522—23. 
Because we vacate the judgment of the district court 
and remand this case to that court in order to provide Tagupa 
with the opportunity to withdraw the motion to dismiss, to 
provide guidance on remand, we briefly discuss the approach that 
should guide a trial court in setting the amount of attorney’s 
fees and costs when they are made a condition of voluntary 
dismissal. See, e.g., Gap v. Puna Geothermal Venture, 106 
30
  
 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Hawaiʻi 325, 341—43, 104 P.3d 912, 928–30 (2004) (offering 
guidance to circuit court on remand as to setting appropriate 
sanction); Nelson v. Univ. of Haw., 97 Hawaiʻ i 376, 385 n.6, 38 
P.3d 95, 104 n.6 (2001) (addressing evidentiary issues to 
provide guidance to the court on remand). 
Payment of attorney’s fees and costs to a defendant is 
merely a species of the various terms and conditions that a trial court may impose upon a plaintiff’s motion for voluntary 
dismissal. See 9 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice 3d § 2366, 
at 540 (stating that, aside from the “payment of money,” 
conditions may include a requirement “that the plaintiff produce 
documents or agree to allow any discovery in the dismissed 
action to be used in any subsequent action or otherwise reduce 
the inconvenience to the defendant caused by the dismissed 
case”); see, e.g., Moniz, 79 Hawaiʻ i at 500—01, 904 P.2d at 514— 
15 (conditioning voluntary dismissal on the reinstatement of an 
arbitration award); In re Wellbutrin XL, 268 F.R.D. 539, 544 
(E.D. Pa. 2010) (conditioning voluntary dismissal on the plaintiff’s compliance with a previous court-ordered discovery). 
Before imposing attorney’s fees and costs (as is the case when 
imposing any other condition), a court should strive “to insure 
that substantial justice is accorded to both parties.” Moniz, 
79 Hawaiʻ i at 500, 904 P.2d at 514 (emphasis added) (quoting 9

Wright & Miller, Federal Practice 2d § 2364); HDCRCP Rule 
41(a)(2). 
Because the substantial justice standard is not 
susceptible to exact exposition, its application necessarily 
will produce different results depending on, and tailored to, 
the particular circumstances present in a case. The trial court 
should balance all of the “relevant equities” so as to “do 
justice between the parties in each case,” and if attorney’s fees and costs are to be imposed, they should be reasonable and 
“deemed appropriate.” McCants, 781 F.2d at 857. 
For example, there might be instances where 
substantial justice is most effectively realized if the amount 
of attorney’s fees and costs awarded excludes “expenses for 
items that will be useful in another action.” 9 Wright & 
Miller, Federal Practice 3d § 2366, at 532; see Westlands Water 
Dist., 100 F.3d at 97—98 (holding that “the defendants should 
only be awarded attorney fees for work which cannot be used in any future litigation of these claims”); McLaughlin v. Cheshire, 
676 F.2d 855, 856—57 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (“[W]here a plaintiff 
seeks voluntary dismissal in one forum to pursue pending 
litigation against the defendant in another forum, the defendant 
is not entitled to reimbursement for expenses incurred in 
preparing work product that has been or will be useful in the 
continuing litigation.”); Davis v. USX Corp., 819 F.2d 1270,

1276 (4th Cir. 1987) (holding that there is no reason to award 
attorneys’ fees for work and resources that “will be easily 
carried over to litigation of the plaintiff’s cause of action” 
in another jurisdiction); Thoubboron v. Ford Motor Co., 809 A.2d 
1204, 1211 (D.C. 2002) (“Attorney’s fees and costs are limited 
to the amount expended for work that cannot be applied to the 
subsequent lawsuit concerning the same claims . . . .”).22 
The justification for excluding expenses for items 
that will be useful in another action is grounded in the twofold purpose of awarding attorney’s fees and costs as a term or 
condition of voluntary dismissal: “to compensate the defendant 
for the unnecessary expense that the litigation has caused,” 
Cauley v. Wilson, 754 F.2d 769, 772 (7th Cir. 1985), “and to 
deter vexatious litigation,” Bishop v. W. Am. Ins. Co., 95 
F.R.D. 494, 495 (N.D. Ga. 1982) (citing 5 J. Moore, J. Lucas & 
J. Wicker, Moore's Federal Practice §§ 41.05[1], 41.06 (2d ed. 
1982)). Where the plaintiff is voluntarily dismissing an action 
22 Some courts have allowed the defendant to recoup all litigation-
related expenses from the plaintiff even if some of the work and materials 
could be used in a subsequent litigation of the same case.  See, e.g., 
LeBlang Motors, Ltd. v. Subaru of Am. , Inc., 148 F.3d 680, 685— 86 (7th Cir. 
1998) (allowing defendant to recoup all trial- preparation expenses because 
plaintiff moved for voluntary dismissal at the eve of trial, court informed
plaintiff that it would consider granting the motion only if plaintiff agrees
to the condition, and plaintiff expressly agreed); Am. Cyanamid Co. v. 
McGhee, 317 F.2d 295, 297— 98 (5th Cir. 1963) (condition requiring plaintiff 
to pay defendant’s costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, without limiting the
award to only those that had been rendered useless by the voluntarydismissal, was not an abuse of discretion because trial court considered
“elements[] traditionally called upon to underpin our concepts of
reasonableness and fairness”).

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
in order to commence the same action in a different forum or 
jurisdiction, the defendant faces the risk of incurring 
duplicative litigation costs. See Cauley, 754 F.2d at 772; 
Taragan v. Eli Lilly & Co., 838 F.2d 1337, 1340 (D.C. Cir. 
1988). At the same time, because the defendant inevitably will 
have to defend against the same action, it would generally be 
inequitable to allow the defendant to recoup all attorney’s fees 
and costs because some of them were expended for work and materials that can be carried over to, and utilized in, the 
subsequent litigation.
23 
We therefore hold that in applying the substantial 
justice standard to the amount of attorney’s fees and cost 
imposed as a condition to voluntary dismissal, the court should 
consider such factors as (1) the reasonableness of the amount of 
attorney’s fees and costs; (2) whether another cause of action 
concerning the same subject matter is contemplated by the 
plaintiff against the defendant; (3) whether some work or materials produced for the case subject to dismissal could be 
utilized in the litigation of the later-filed case; and (4) the 
23 In such a case, recoupment of all attorney’s fees and costs not
only would compensate the defendant for the prejudice that the voluntary
dismissal would cause, which is fair and proper, see Cauley, 754 F.2d at 772, 
but would also provide the defendant with a p otentially unjust windfall, see
GAF Corp., 665 F.2d at 369— 70 (holding that payment for “expenses incurred in 
preparing work product that will be useful in the ongoing litigation in”
another jurisdiction “would amount to a windfall to” the defendant).

prejudicial effect of dismissal to the defendant beyond the 
prospect of subsequent litigation. 
In its motion for attorney’s fees, VIPDesk submitted a 
summary of its fees and expenses incurred in defending against 
Tagupa’s claims, totaling $16,800.41 in attorney’s fees and 
$288.87 in costs. The court granted the full amount of 
VIPdesk’s requested fees and costs, and it appears that the 
court simply accepted VIPdesk’s accounting of fees and costs and did not engage in the requisite weighing of the relevant 
equities to arrive at its award to VIPdesk. See McCants, 781 
F.2d at 857. The district court’s order reflects no finding 
that the amount of attorney’s fees and costs were calculated to 
accomplish substantial justice in light of the facts and 
circumstances of this case.
24 Hence, upon remand, the district 
court should also consider the foregoing approach in setting the amount of attorney’s fees and costs if the court, in its 
discretion, decides to impose such a condition for voluntary dismissal. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
Although we find that the trial court has discretion 
to impose attorney’s fees as a term or condition of voluntary dismissal under HDCRCP Rule 41(a)(2), in this case the district 
24 Further, the district court could not have conducted an in- court
balancing of the factors in this case because no hearing was ever held.

court abused its discretion by not providing Tagupa with an 
opportunity to choose between accepting this condition or 
withdrawing her motion to dismiss. Finally, we find that the 
district court abused its discretion by failing to evaluate, and 
make findings on, whether the award and amount of attorney’s 
fees and costs accords substantial justice to both parties. 
Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the ICA and the district 
court’s June 17, 2013 Judgment and June 17, 2013 Order Granting Defendant’s Motion for Award of Attorney’s Fees and Costs and 
remand the case to the district court for proceedings consistent 
with this opinion.
