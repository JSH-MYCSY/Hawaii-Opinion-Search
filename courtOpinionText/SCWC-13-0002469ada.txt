OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J. 
 
 A fair trial by an impartial jury is a basic 
protection provided by the United States Constitution and the 
Hawaiʻi State Constitution to the accused in a criminal case.  
State v. Keliiholokai , 58 Haw. 356, 357, 569 P.2d 891, 893 
(1977).  Inherent in this protection is the defendant’s right to 
receive a fair trial by an impartial jury, free from improper 
prejudice resulting from outside influences or juror misconduct.  Electronically Filed

 Id.  Where the existence of an outside influence such as juror 
misconduct is brought to the attention of the trial court, the 
court must ascertain the extent of the influence and then, in 
its sound discretion, take appropriate measures to assure a fair 
trial.  Id.  In this case, we are called upon to consider the 
circumstances in which a court is required to investigate an allegation of inappropriate communication between a juror and a 
witness during the pendency of a criminal trial.  
I.  BACKGROUND 
 On February 28, 2012, a grand jury indicted Susan Chin 
with two counts of theft in the first degree, one count of 
attempted theft in the first degree, and three counts of money laundering.
1  The charges related to conduct allegedly engaged 
in by Chin when she was acting as a caregiver for the complainant.  The alleged conduct involves theft of the proceeds 
from the sale of the complainant’s home, use of the 
complainant’s annuities and money from a joint account held by Chin and the complainant, transfer of money from the 
complainant’s account to Chin’s relatives, and change of 
beneficiaries of the complainant’s annuities.  
                         
 1 Counts I a nd II charged The ft in the First Degree, Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) §§ 708-830.5(1)(a) a nd 708-830(1); Count III charged Attempted 
Theft in the First Degree, HRS §§ 705-500(1)(b), 708- 830.5(1)(a) and 708-
830(1)); and Counts IV–VI charged Money Launde ring, HRS § 708A-3 
(1)(a)(ii)).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 A. Trial 
 Jury trial in the case began on March 15, 2013 .2  
Charles Bowen was the neighbor and friend of the complainant in 
this case.  Bowen introduced the complainant to Chin, who he had 
been friends with for over twenty years.   
  After the passing of her husband and as she advanced 
into her eighties, the complainant had difficulty caring for 
herself.  There were concerns that the complainant was being 
taken advantage of financially by a couple, which eventually came 
to the attention of Adult Protective Services (APS).  The APS 
caseworker consulted Bowen regarding the complainant and asked 
whether the complainant had any relatives who could assist her.  
The caseworker was not confident that the complainant’s niece, 
who lived in California, would be able to adequately care for the complainant.  Accordingly, the APS caseworker sought out a third-
party caregiver, and Chin, who had become close friends with the 
complainant, was allowed to assist as her caregiver. 
  The complainant lived with Chin for several months in 
2010.  During that time, Bowen saw them on a weekly basis at 
barbecues and other functions.  When the father of Chin’s 
children died, Chin had to travel to New York, and during this timeframe, the complainant moved back to her home in Aiea.  Bowen

trial proceedings in this case.    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 testified that Chin received a check in the amount of $500,000 on 
a life insurance policy sometime in 2010.   
  The complainant later moved back in with Chin.  In 
February 2011, the complainant revoked the power of attorney 
appointing her niece and executed a new power of attorney 
appointing Chin as her agent.3  Also in February 2011, the 
complainant closed her bank account that she had shared with her deceased husband, and she opened a new account jointly held by herself and Chin.  Around this time, Chin emailed a realtor 
regarding potentially selling the complainant’s house and finding 
her a place in an assisted living community.   
  Chin introduced the complainant to her financial 
advisor after the complainant complained about her prior 
financial advisor in front of Bowen, Chin, and others.  The 
complainant cashed in one of her annuities, receiving about 
$30,000.  The complainant requested to name Chin as a beneficiary 
of her remaining two annuities; however, the financial advisor counseled her to instead add Chin as a contingent beneficiary and 
to designate a family member as the primary beneficiary.  Chin 
subsequently withdrew approximately $8,000 from the joint account 
in the complainant and Chin’s name to pay off the loan on Chin’s 
car.  
                         
 3 The complainant’s attorney testified that he did not believe that 
the complainant was under the undue influence of Chin. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
5 
   The complainant’s home sold for $639,000, and she 
received $605,114.67 from escrow.4  The complainant and Chin went 
to the bank to deposit the proceeds of the sale of the property.  They deposited the proceeds into several joint accounts:  
$200,000 into an account held by Chin and her older son, $200,000 
into an account held by Chin and her younger son, $100,000 into 
an account held by the complainant and Chin, and $100,000 into an 
account held by Chin and her mother.
5 
  On August 9, 2011, Chin was returning from a trip with 
the complainant at which time the complainant’s grandniece was 
waiting for them at the airport in Honolulu to take the 
complainant home with her.  Six days later, with her grandniece’s 
assistance, the complainant revoked the power of attorney held by 
Chin and withdrew the remaining money from the bank account which 
she held with Chin.  They also reported to the bank authorities 
that there was a problem with all of Chin’s accounts.   
  When Chin approached the bank to inquire about the missing funds on August 16, 2011, she was told that the 
complainant had withdrawn the money from the account held by Chin 
and the complainant.  At that point, Chin attempted to withdraw 
the bulk of the funds from the two accounts she held with her 
                         
 4 The realtor who listed the property testified that the 
complainant appeared competent during the transaction. 
 5 Individual bank accounts were insured up to $250,000. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 sons but was told that she could not do so, as the bank had 
frozen the accounts.  Chin removed her name from her son’s joint 
accounts and added her sister’s name instead.  Also on August 16, 
2011, Chin filed a missing persons report with the Honolulu 
Police Department (HPD), declaring that the complainant’s 
grandniece had taken the complainant away and that money was 
stolen money from Chin’s personal, preexisting account.  On 
August 30, 2011, HPD officers seized the accounts held by Chin.     At the conclusion of the evidence, the jury found Chin 
guilty of theft of the proceeds from sale of complainant’s home 
(Count I), changing the name of ownership of two joint accounts 
(Count IV) , and taking $8,000 from the joint account to pay off 
Chin’s car (Count VI) ; the jury found Chin not gu ilty of Count 
III and were unable to reach a unanimous verdicts on Counts II 
and V. 
B. Chin’s Motion for a New Trial 
 Chin timely filed a Motion for New Trial (motion) 
based upon an asserted violation of her right to due process, 
confrontation of witnesses, and a fair trial as guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions.  The motion was supported 
by a declaration of Charles Bowen (Declaration) who explained 
that he had been called to testify as a witness at Chin’s trial because as a person who was previously a neighbor to the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
7 
 complainant, he had information to share regarding some of the 
events that took place between the complainant and Chin.  His Declaration stated that, during trial, a juror approached him in 
the men’s room and spoke to him about possible employment:  
3.  During the course of my testimony I explained my job 
status and the fact that I was a civilian employee of the 
United States government.  I also explained that I had a top secret security clearance. 
4.  After I testified I was approached in the men’s room by 
a gentleman.  He inquired about the possibility of 
employment and handed me a business card.  Attached hereto 
as Exhibit “A” is a true and correct copy of the business card provided by the man.  
5.  I realized later that the individual who handed me his 
business card was one of the jurors in Susan Chin’s case;   6.  Upon this realization I told Susan about the encounter 
and gave her the card;  
7. I never called or communicated any further with the 
juror after that encounter in the men’s room.  
8.  After learning of the verdict in this case I spoke with 
Susan’s attorney by telephone and told him about the 
encounter . . . . 
Attached as Exhibit “A” to the Declaration was a photocopy of a 
business card with the following information:

 The memorandum in support of the motion for new trial indicated 
that the juror who had provided the business card was the 
foreperson of the jury in Chin’s case.7  The memorandum contended 
that the juror “sought a favor from Ms. Chin’s witness Charles Bowen, which was not forthcoming.”  The favor involved 
“approach[ing] Charles Bowen for a job.”  The defense 
maintained, “The fact that Mr. Bowen did not respond to his 
advance may have had a significant inappropriate influence on the deliberative process in this case.”  Therefore, Chin argued 
that the actions of the juror “in communicating with Mr. Bowen 
was highly prejudicial warranting a new trial.” 
 In its response to the motion, the State noted that 
the granting or denial of a motion for new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial court and would not be disturbed 
absent a clear abuse of discretion.  The State submitted that 
the legal framework for determining whether a defendant in a 
criminal case has been denied a fair trial by an impartial jury is for the trial court initially “to determine whether the 
nature of the alleged deprivation rises to the level of being 
                                                                               
(continued . . .) 
blacked out information contained the juror’s address, phone numbers and 
email address.   
 7 According to the defense’s memorandum supporting the motion, the 
foreperson “is a retired United States Navy service member,” which would 
appear to coincide with the notation on the business card indicating “USN 
Ret.” ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
9 
 substantially prejudicial.”  “The defendant bears the burden of 
making a prima facie showing” of the deprivation.  The State 
maintained that, if the defendant fails to meet her burden, the 
court is under no duty to investigate the totality of 
circumstances surrounding the alleged deprivation to determine 
its impact on jury impartiality. 
 The State argued it was “pure speculation” that Mr. 
Bowen “may have had a significant inappropriate influence upon 
the deliberative process.”  The State contended that “the 
defendant must establish that the jury was ‘influenced by the 
alleged misconduct.’”  The State also noted that the contact and 
communication did not involve inadmissible evidence or any 
aspect of the case itself.  “Instead it involved an 
insignificant ‘background witness’ who admitted that he had no 
knowledge of the disposition of the proceeds from the sale of 
the victim’s house-the main disputed issue during the trial.”  
Consequently, the State asserted that the defendant failed to present, specific, substantial evidence of possible juror 
misconduct,” and the court would not abuse its discretion in 
denying the motion for new trial. 
 On May 24, 2013, the circuit court held a hearing on 
the motion.
8  The court issued written findings of fact,

10 
 conclusions of law, and an order on June 5, 2013.  The court 
found Chin’s argument that the improper communication may have 
had an inappropriate influence on the deliberative process to be 
“pure speculation.”  The court concluded that, based on the 
record, “the nature of the alleged deprivation did not rise to 
the level of being ‘substantially prejudicial.’”  The court 
reasoned that the timing and mixed nature of the verdicts 
undermined Chin’s argument that she was deprived of a fair trial by an impartial jury. 
  The circuit court also noted that defense counsel requested the court to interrogate the jurors or give defense 
counsel permission to do so.  However, the court concluded that 
under State v. Furutani, 76 Hawaiʻ i 172, 180, 873 P.2d 51, 59 
(1994), the trial court is under no duty to interrogate the jury 
unless the defendant presents evidence demonstrating a 
substantially prejudicial deprivation.  Accordingly, the circuit 
court denied Chin’s motion.  
 The circuit court  sentenced Chin to a ten-year term 
of imprisonment for Counts I and IV  and a five-year term of 
imprisonment for Count VI, all terms to run concurrently, and the 
court ordered restitution in the amount of $523,762.15 less any 
amounts recovered from accounts or by law enforcement.  The circuit court entered its Judgment of Conviction and Sentence on 
July 19, 2013 .  Chin filed a timely notice of appeal. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 C. Appeal to the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
 On appeal to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), 
Chin contended that the trial court abused its discretion in 
denying her motion for new trial.9  Chin argued that she 
satisfied her initial burden of making a prima facie showing of 
a deprivation that “could substantially prejudice [her] right to a fair trial” by an impartial jury .  Chin maintained that 
although the “foreperson of her jury was ordered not to have contact with any witnesses in this case,” the juror approached 
“the main defense witness in the case to seek a job.”  Chin 
argued that because the job did not materialize, it is not “pure 
speculation,” to conclude that the “juror possibly sought a 
quid pro quo, and not receiving any  response from Mr. Bowen was 
upset.”   Chin 
 reasoned that o nce she provided the Declaration 
and the juror’s business card to the court, a rebuttable 
presumption of prejudice was raised and it was the State’s 
burden to prove harmlessness.  Chin contended that any private 
communication or contact with a juror during a criminal trial 
about the matter pending before the jury is presumptively 
prejudicial and requires a hearing to determine the 
                         
 9 Chin also contended that there was insufficient evidence to 
support the guilty verdicts in Counts I, IV and VI.  Chin has not raised 
these issues in her Application for Writ of Certiorari.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
12 
 circumstances of the improper contact and the extent of any 
prejudice to the defendant.  Chin argued that the State failed 
to meet its burden  to overcome the rebuttable presumption 
because no evidence of harmlessness was proffered.  Chin 
concluded that the inappropriate contact by the foreperson in 
this case undermined the concept of a fair trial and was highly 
prejudicial. 
 In its Answering Brief, the State contended that Chin 
failed to make a prima facie showing that her right to a fair 
trial by an impartial jury was substantially prejudiced.  The State maintained that Bowen’s Declaration did not indicate that 
the foreperson made any reference to the evidence in this case, 
that Bowen’s conversation with the foreperson was communicated 
to the other jurors, or that the other jurors were influenced by 
the alleged misconduct.  The State argued that because Chin 
failed to demonstrate that the juror’s actions rose to the “level 
of being substantially prejudicial,” the circuit cou rt was under 
no duty to recall the jury for questioning, and the court did not 
abuse its discretion in denying her motion for a new trial. 
 In her Reply Brief, 
 Chin contends that the State’s 
argument with regard to the sufficiency of the evidence 
presented by Chin “is fundamentally flawed” because Chin was 
prohibited from establishing such facts.  Chin noted that she 
requested permission to question the jurors or to have the court ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
13 
 do so, but the request was denied.   Chin noted that Rule 
3.5(e)(4)(ii) of the Hawaiʻ i Rules of Professional Conduct 
required her to obtain permission from the court to conduct an 
inquiry of the jury regarding juror misconduct.  Chin argued that 
once she documented what had occurred to the court, a rebuttable 
presumption of prejudice arose and it was the burden of the State to prove that the inappropriate contact was harmless.    
 The ICA issued its Summary Disposition Order (SDO) on 
October 29, 2014.   The ICA found that Chin was required to “make 
a prima facie showing of a deprivation that could substantially 
prejudice his or her right to a fair trial by an impar tial jury.”  
According to the ICA, “ Had the circuit court ‘determine[d] that 
the alleged deprivation [was] substantially prejudicial, the 
[circuit] court then [would become] duty bou nd to further 
investigate the totality of circumstances surrounding the alleged deprivation to determine its impact on jury impartiality.’”  
(Quoting State v. Yamada, 108 Hawai ʻi 474, 479, 122 P.3d 254, 259 
(2005)).  The ICA pointed out that the circuit court found that 
the nature of the deprivation alleged by Chin did not rise to the 
level of substantial prejudice, and the ICA further noted that 
the timing and mixed nature of the verdicts undermined Chin’ s 
argument that she was deprived of a fair trial.  The ICA 
concluded that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
14 
 denying the motion for new trial and affirmed the J udgment of 
Conviction and Sentence. 
II. DISCUSSION 
 In her Application for Writ of Certiorari, Chin  
contends that she satisfied her initial burden of making a prima 
facie showing of a deprivation that could substantially prejudice 
her right to a fair trial by an impartial jury.  Chin maintains 
that when evidence is provided to the court that an extrinsic influence may have tainted the trial, the court should hold a 
hearing to determine the extent of the prejudice to the 
defendant.  Chin asserts that she is entitled to a new trial 
because the trial court refused to conduct an appropriate 
inquiry. 
The State responds that Chin failed to meet her burden 
of showing that her right to an impartial jury was substantially prejudiced.  Thus, the State argues that the circuit court was 
under no duty to recall the foreperson for questioning, and 
consequently the court did not abuse its discretion in denying 
the motion for new trial. 
A. The Williamson Test  
The Hawaiʻ i Constitution requires, as a fundamental 
protection of an individual in a criminal case, trial by an 
impartial jury.  State v. Pokini, 55 Haw. 640, 641, 526 P.2d 94, 99 (1974).  
The defendant bears the initial burden of making a ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
15 
 prima facie showing of a deprivation that “could substantially 
prejudice [his or her] right to a fair trial” by an impartial 
jury.10  State v. Williamson, 72 Haw. 97, 102, 807 P.2d 593, 596 
(1991) (emphasis added); see also Furutani, 76 Hawaiʻ i at 181, 
873 P.2d at 60.  Once the defendant makes a prima facie showing 
of a deprivation, “a rebuttable presumption of prejudice is 
raised.”  Williamson, 72 Haw. at 102, 807 P.2d at 596.  
Therefore, the analysis in Williamson initially focuses on the 
general nature of the outside influence and whether it “could” 
substantially prejudice a defendant; if the court so finds, then 
a rebuttable presumption of prejudice is raised that triggers 
the court’s obligation to investigate the totality of the circumstances.  Id.  
The circuit court and the ICA applied an incomplete 
formulation of the Williamson test in examining the juror 
misconduct in this case.  Instead of applying the Williamson 
analysis--which requires that the trial court first determine 
whether the misconduct “could substantially prejudice the 
defendant’s right to a fair trial”--the circuit court and the 
                         
10 That prima facie case includes a presentation by the defendant of 
“some specific, substantial evidence” showing the occurrence of the outside 
influence that may have possibly biased the juror.  State v. Yamada, 108 
Hawaiʻi 474, 479, 122 P.3d 254, 259 (2005); State v. Pauline, 100 Hawaiʻ i 356, 
381, 60 P.3d 306, 331 (2002); Furutani, 76 Hawaiʻ i at 181, 873 P.2d at 60. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
16 
 ICA considered whether Chin presented evidence demonstrating 
that she was substantially prejudiced.11    
Under the circuit court and the ICA’s interpretation, 
the first step considers whether the alleged misconduct 
substantially prejudiced the defendant’s right to a fair trial.  
In this formulation, the focus of the defendant’s initial burden 
is to demonstrate that the specific misconduct rises to the 
level of being substantially prejudicial in order to trigger the court’s duty to investigate.  This interpretation is 
inconsistent with Williamson.   
The origin of the test used by the circuit court and 
the ICA is the following passage from Keliiholokai: “the initial 
step for the trial court to take . . . is to determine whether the nature of the [outside influence] rises to the level of 
being substantially prejudicial.”  Keliiholokai, 58 Haw. at 359, 
569 P.2d at 895.  When viewed in isolation, this passage does not reflect the actual holding of the Keliiholokai decision or 
the law as pronounced in our subsequent cases.   
In Keliiholokai, the issue was whether the jury had 
been improperly influenced by a newspaper article.  Id. at 361, 
                         
 11 The circuit court stated, “Because [Chin] has failed to meet her 
burden of presenting sufficient evidence of a deprivation that rises to the 
level of being ‘substantially prejudicial[,]’ the [ ] motion for new trial is 
denied.”  Similarly, the ICA indicated that the trial court would be bound to 
investigate the circumstances of the misconduct only if the trial court 
“determined that the alleged deprivation was substantially prejudicial.” ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
17 
 569 P.2d at 893.  This court explained that the first 
consideration was whether the contents of the article were of a 
nature that could be substantially prejudicial. 
Thus, the initial step for the trial court to take, once a 
claim of prejudicial news accounts is made, is to determine whether the nature of the news accounts rises to the level 
of being substantially prejudicial.  
Id. at 359, 569 P.2d at 894-95 (citation omitted) (quoting 
United States v. Jones, 542 F.2d 186, 194 (4th Cir. 1976)).  
Thus, in the context of the question of whether a jury received 
improper information through a news article, the initial evaluation is to examine the “nature” of the improper influence 
or alleged misconduct. 
The Keliiholokai court ruled that the news account 
disclosed the defendant’s prior convictions.  Id. at 360, 569 
P.2d at 895.  As the defendant in Keliiholokai had not testified 
in his own behalf and there was “no indication of any relevant 
and proper purpose for which evidence of [his] prior convictions 
would have been admissible at trial,” the convictions should not 
have been before the jury.  Id.   
[W]e hold that the nature of the article containing 
appellant’s prior convictions was substantially prejudicial 
and rose to “ that degree of prejudice” which “triggered the 
court’s responsibility to investigate further by 
specifically questioning the jury.”  All of the factors 
present in the instant case should have prompted the trial 
court to conduct “an immediate voir dire inquiry to 
determine if the jurors had read the offensive articles 
and, if they had, whether they could nonetheless render a fair and true verdict.”  This, the trial court failed to 
do.  Accordingly, we conclude that appellant was denied a fair trial.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
18 
 Id. at 360, 569 P.2d at 896 (emphases added) (citations omitted) 
(quoting Jones, 542 F.2d at 194, and United States v. Thomas, 
463 F.2d 1061, 1063 (7th Cir. 1972)) (alteration omitted).  The 
Keliiholokai court first examined the general “nature” of the 
outside influence, and having determined that it had the potential to substantially prejudice him, applied a presumption 
of prejudice in favor of the defendant.  Id. 
Accordingly, although the nature of the news article 
was “substantially prejudicial,” the court in Keliiholokai did 
not require the defendant to show that he had been prejudiced.  
Indeed, it was unknown if any of the jurors had read the 
article.  Id. at 361, 569 P.2d at 893.  The error by the trial 
court was in failing to recognize that the article was of a nature that, if read by a juror, could be substantially 
prejudicial to the defendant, and therefore the trial court was 
required to investigate whether any of the jurors had been 
exposed to the contents of the article. 
Subsequently, this court’s decision in Williamson 
considered whether a defendant was prejudiced by a dictionary discovered in the jury room following deliberations.  
Williamson, 72 Haw. at 98, 807 P.2d at 594.  Similar to 
Keliiholokai, the Williamson decision first considered whether 
the influence was of a nature that could substantially prejudice 
the defendant’s right to a fair trial.  Id. at 102-04, 807 P.2d ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
19 
 at 596.  The court observed, “During the course of a trial, a 
juror’s obtaining of extraneous definitions or statements of law 
differing from that intended by the court is misconduct which 
may result in prejudice to the defendant’s constitutional right 
to a fair trial.”  Id. at 102-03, 807 at 596 (emphasis added).  
Also parallel to Keliiholokai, once the nature of the misconduct 
was determined to have the potential to substantially prejudice the defendant, this court charged the trial court with a duty to adequately investigate the misconduct.  “[B]y not inquiring into 
the identity of the juror who brought the dictionary and 
obtaining a personal explanation from him or her as to its use, 
the trial court did not have before it the totality of 
circumstances surrounding the misconduct to decide whether it 
was harmless.”  Id. at 104, 807 P.2d at 597.  
Williamson and Keliiholokai require the same procedure 
of the trial court when an improper influence is raised: (1) an 
initial determination that the outside influence is of a nature that could substantially prejudice a defendant’s right to a fair 
trial and, once that general nature has been established, (2) an 
investigation of the totality of the circumstances.  The 
Williamson and Keliiholokai formulations are equivalent because 
both refer to “the nature” of the outside influence, indicating that the initial test looks at the general type of improper 
conduct alleged.  Thus, Keliiholokai instructs a trial court to ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
20 
 examine whether the nature of the outside influence “rises to 
the level of being substantially prejudicial,” Id. at 359, 569 
P.2d at 895, and Williamson recognizes that this directive 
requires that the trial court determine whether “such influence 
is of a nature which could substantially prejudice the 
defendant’s right to a fair trial.”  72 Haw. at 102, 807 P.2d at 
596. 
Since Williamson, this court has most frequently cited 
the Keliiholokai and Williamson formulations together.  For 
example, State v. Bailey, 126 Hawaiʻ i 383, 271 P.3d 1142 (2012), 
recently cited the following passage from Furutani: 
[W]hen a defendant in a criminal case claims a deprivation 
of the right to a fair trial by an impartial jury, the 
initial step for the trial court to take is to determine 
whether the nature of the alleged deprivation rises to the 
level of being substantially prejudicial.  If it does not 
rise to such a level, the trial court is under no duty to interrogate the jury.  And whether it does rise to the 
level of substantial prejudice is ordinarily a question 
committed to the trial court’ s discretion. 
Where the trial court does determine that such 
alleged deprivation is of a nature which could 
substantially prejudice the defendant’s right 
to a fair trial, a rebuttable presumption of 
prejudice is raised.  The trial judge is then 
duty bound to further investigate the totality of circumstances surrounding the alleged deprivation to determine its impact on jury 
impartiality.  The standard to be applied in 
overcoming such a presumption is that the 
alleged deprivation must be proved harmless 
beyond a reasonable doubt. 
The defendant bears the initial burden of making a prima facie showing of a deprivation 
that could substantially prejudice his or her 
right to a fair trial by an impartial jury.  
But once a rebuttable presumption of prejudice is raised, the burden of proving harmlessness 
falls squarely on the prosecution. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 Bailey, 126 Hawaiʻ i at 399-400, 271 P.3d at 1158-59 (emphases 
added) (quoting Furutani, 76 Hawaiʻ i at 180–81, 873 P.2d at 59–
60).  Similar passages setting forth both formulations were 
stated in State v. Keohokapu, 127 Hawaiʻ i 91, 102, 276 P.3d 660, 
671 (2012), Yamada, 108 Hawaiʻ i at 478-79, 122 P.3d at 258-59, 
and State v. Samonte, 83 Hawaiʻ i 507, 523-24, 928 P.2d 1, 17-18 
(1996).12  Thus, the decisions of this court have most frequently 
cited the Keliiholokai and Williamson formulations together as a 
single test that first examines whether the general nature of 
the misconduct could substantially prejudice the right to a fair 
trial.  This test does not require a defendant to prove 
substantial prejudice before a court has a duty to investigate 
the circumstances. 
For instance, in Bailey, the issue presented was 
whether a juror’s statements to the other members of the jury concerning the defendant’s prior convictions warranted a new 
                         
12 When only the Keliiholokai formulation has been cited, this court 
determined that the nature of the misconduct was of a type that could not 
substantially prejudice a defendant.  See State v. Gabalis, 83 Hawaiʻ i 40, 45-
46, 924 P.2d 534, 540- 41(1996) (citing only the Keliiholokai formulation and 
affirming denial of new trial based on a general rule that “information 
regarding the reputation of an establishment or a community location is, in 
and of itself, insufficiently prejudicial to warrant the grant of a new 
trial”); see also State v. Kim, 103 Hawaiʻ i 285, 291, 81 P.3d 1200, 1206- 07 
(2003) (citing only the Keliiholokai formulation and affirming trial court’s 
denial on motion for new trial because allegedly improper juror comments did 
“not constitute information from outside sources, and, thus, were not 
improper”); Pauline, 100 Hawaiʻ i at 381- 82, 60 P.3d at 331- 32 (citing only the 
Keliiholokai formulation and affirming trial court’s denial of motion for new 
trial based on paucity of evidence demonstrating that the alleged misconduct 
occurred).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
22 
 trial.  Bailey, 126 Hawaiʻ i at 385, 271 P.3d at 1144.  This court 
cited both the Keliiholokai and Williamson formulations and 
concluded that the defendant “met his burden of ‘making a prima 
facie showing of a deprivation that could substantially 
prejudice his or her right to a fair trial by an impartial jury.’”  Id. at 399-400, 271 P.3d at 1158-59 (emphasis added) 
(quoting Furutani, 76 Hawaiʻ i at 180–81, 873 P.2d at 59–60).  We 
concluded in Bailey that the trial court’s “decision to 
investigate the impact of [the juror’s] statements on juror impartiality was proper.”
13  Id. at 400, 271 P.3d at 1159.  Thus, 
Bailey applied the test, as stated in Williamson, that the court 
first examines the general nature of the misconduct, and if such 
misconduct is generally of a nature that could substantially 
prejudice a defendant, the trial court is required to investigate the totality of the circumstances surrounding the 
outside influence. 
Consequently, the circuit court should not have denied 
Chin’s motion for new trial on the basis that she failed to 
present sufficient evidence of a deprivation that rose to the 
level of being substantially prejudicial.  The ICA similarly 
erred when it indicated that the trial court would be bound to 
                         
13 Following a review of the trial court’s investigation, this court 
reversed the trial court’s denial of a new trial because the juror’s 
statements were “insurmountably prejudicial” and thus were not harmless 
beyond a reasonable doubt.  Bailey, 126 Hawaiʻ i at 403, 271 P.3d at 1162 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
23 
 investigate the circumstances of the misconduct only if the 
trial court “determined that the alleged deprivation was 
substantially prejudicial.”14 
B. The Alleged Misconduct 
  Turning to the present case, Chin alleged contact 
occurred between a witness and a juror that may have had a 
significant, inappropriate influence upon the deliberative 
process.  Whether contact between a juror and a witness during 
trial represents an outside influence of a nature that could 
substantially prejudice a defendant has not been expressly 
addressed by this court.  The United States Supreme Court has 
stated, “Private communications, possibly prejudicial, between 
jurors and . . . witnesses . . . are absolutely forbidden, and 
invalidate the verdict, at least unless their harmlessness is made to appear.”  Mattox v. United States, 146 U.S. 140, 150 
(1892) (ordering a new trial based, in part, on improper comments made by the court bailiff in the presence of the 
jurors).  The Court has also stated, 
                         
14 If the test applied by the trial court and the ICA were correct, 
in order for the presumption of prejudice to be invoked, the court would 
first have to find that substantial prejudice was already present.  It would 
not be logical to apply a presumption of prejudice when prejudice has already 
been found.   
It is equally incongruous that the nature of the outside 
influence must be shown to rise to “substantial” prejudice when the 
rebuttable presumption invokes mere “prejudice.”  That is, under the trial court’s and ICA’s formulation, substantial prejudice, a higher standard, 
would have to be present in order to create a rebuttable presumption of mere 
“prejudice,” a lower standard.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
24 
 In a criminal case, any private communication, contact, or 
tampering directly or indirectly, with a juror during a 
trial about the matter pending before the jury is, for obvious reasons, deemed presumptively prejudicial, if not 
made in pursuance of known rules of the court and the instructions and directions of the court made during the trial, with full knowledge of the parties.  
Remmer v. United States, 347 U.S. 227, 229 (1954) (emphases 
added) (remanding to the trial court with directions to hold a 
hearing to determine whether a communication between an unknown 
person and a juror was harmful to the defendant).  Contact 
between witnesses and jurors is “generally improper” because it raises a fundamental concern of whether the jury reached “their 
verdict based solely on the evidence presented at trial” or was 
“improperly influenced by inappropriate contacts.”  Dillard v. 
State, 3 A.3d 403, 408-09 (Md. Ct. App. 2010) (quoting Jenkins 
v. State, 375 Md. 284, 301, 825 A.2d 1008, 1018 (2003)).   
This court has made similar pronouncements indicating 
a strong policy of preventing outside influence on a jury.  “The law . . . zealously protects the efficacy of the right to jury 
trial by erecting a strong presumption of prejudice when the 
integrity of jury deliberations has been compromised by 
unauthorized contact with non-jurors.”  Pokini, 55 Haw. at 656, 
526 P.2d at 108 (citing to Remmer, 347 U.S. at 229, and Mattox, 
146 U.S. at 148-150).  “The outside influence need not touch 
directly on the guilt or innocence of the defendant to trigger 
the presumption of prejudice--it is enough that during the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
25 
 crucial period of jury deliberations there was a private 
communication bearing even remotely on the trial or the jury’s 
functions in it.”  Id. 
Similarly, in State v. Messamore, the ICA considered a 
possibly prejudicial conversation overheard in the hallway by 
one of the jurors during a trial recess.  2 Haw. App. 643, 652, 
639 P.2d 413, 420 (1982), abrogated on other grounds by State v. 
Moore, 82 Hawaiʻ i 202, 921 P.2d 122 (1996).  The ICA found it 
“inherent” in the protection of the right to a fair trial “that 
a defendant receive a trial by an impartial jury free from 
outside influences” and ordered a new trial.  Id. at 652, 639 
P.2d at 419-20.  
Thus, in accordance with the decisions of the Supreme 
Court and of this court, we hold that any contact or private 
communication, unless trivial,15 during trial between a juror and 
a witness represents an outside influence of a nature that could substantially prejudice a defendant’s right to a fair trial.  
See Williamson, 72 Haw. at 102, 807 P.2d at 596.   
 Chin also alleged that the witness-juror contact was 
in violation of a specific court instruction to the jury to not 
                         
 15 A court may find that brief salutations, such as good morning or 
good afternoon, are trivial when there are no circumstances present 
indicating that the communication was anything other than benign.  However, 
if the court is not aware of the substance of the contact, the court has a 
duty to investigate the nature of the communication, including whether it 
concerned a matter pending before the jury.   See Remmer, 347 U.S. at 229.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
26 
 talk to witnesses.  Conduct of a juror that is contrary to the 
instructions of the court may constitute grounds for a finding 
of juror misconduct.16  In Furutani, the jury’s disregard of the 
court’s instruction that they were not to “draw any inference unfavorable to [the defendant] because he did not testify in 
this case, or give any consideration to this fact in your 
deliberation” was one factor in this court’s determination that 
the State had not overcome the rebuttable presumption of 
prejudice.  76 Hawaiʻ i at 177, 186-87, 873 P.2d at 56, 65-66.   
 While we do not consider whether a violation of any 
court instruction may warrant investigation, here, the court’s 
instruction to the jury specifically directed “Do not talk to the defendant, lawyers, witnesses or anybody else connected with 
this case.”  As the instruction here is consistent with our 
historical policy of preventing outside influence on a jury, the 
violation of that instruction provides additional evidence that 
the influence is of a nature that could substantially prejudice 
a defendant’s right to a fair trial.  See Pokini, 55 Haw. at 
657, 526 P.2d at 108 (articulating a policy to “zealously 
protect[] the efficacy of the right to jury trial by erecting a 
strong presumption of prejudice when the integrity of jury 
                         
 16 “‘Juror misconduct’ does not necessarily mean a juror’s bad faith 
or malicious motive but means a violation of or departure from an established 
rule or procedure for production of a valid verdict.”   Oahu Publ’ ns Inc. v. 
Ahn, 133 Hawaiʻ i 482, 490 n.8, 331 P.3d 460, 468 n.8 (2014).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
27 
 deliberations has been compromised by unauthorized contact with 
non-jurors”). 
The circuit court was provided substantive evidence 
that there was contact between Bowen and the jury foreperson 
that was of a nature that could substantially prejudice Chin’s 
right to a fair trial.  Accordingly, Chin made a prima facie 
showing of juror misconduct that required the court to ascertain 
the extent and effect of the improper influence. 
C. The Court’s Duty to Investigate 
When there is juror misconduct that presents a 
potential for substantial prejudice to a defendant’s right to a fair trial, there is a “rebuttable presumption of prejudice,” 
and “[t]he trial judge is then duty bound to further investigate 
the totality of circumstances surrounding the outside influence 
to determine its impact on jury impartiality.”  Williamson, 72 
Haw. at 102, 807 P.2d at 596 (emphasis added).  An investigation into the totality of circumstances includes an “individual 
examination of potentially tainted jurors, outside the presence 
of the other jurors, to determine the influence, if any, of the 
extraneous matters.”  Id. 
For example, in Williamson, the trial court did “not 
inquir[e] into the identity of the juror who brought the dictionary and obtain[] a personal explanation from him or her 
as to its use”; thus, “the trial court did not have before it ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
28 
 the totality of circumstances surrounding the misconduct to 
decide whether it was harmless.”  Id. at 104, 807 P.2d at 597.  
In contrast, in State v. Amorin, 58 Haw. 623, 574 P.2d 895 
(1978), the trial court had effectively investigated the 
totality of the circumstances, including examination of the 
relevant juror.  Id. at 626, 574 P.2d at 898.  Accordingly, this 
court affirmed the finding of the trial court that the misconduct “did not infect the rest of the jury” and was “satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the juror misconduct . 
. . was harmless and a new trial was properly denied.”  Id. at 
631, 574 P.2d at 900.   
Thus, where a prima facie case of improper influence 
has been shown, raising a presumption of prejudice, the totality of the circumstances includes, at a minimum, the court’s 
examination of the juror or jurors involved in the misconduct.  
In short, there must be sufficient findings such that a 
reviewing court “can determine whether the [outside influence] was harmless or not.”  Messamore, 2 Haw. App. at 652, 639 P.2d 
at 420 (finding reversible error in the trial court’s failure to inquire into the totality of the circumstances surrounding 
statements overheard by a juror). 
To overcome the presumption of prejudice, the State 
must prove that the outside influence on the jury was harmless 
beyond a reasonable doubt.  Williamson, 72 Haw. at 102, 807 P.2d ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
29 
 at 596; see Furutani, 76 Hawaiʻ i at 181, 873 P.2d at 60 (“[T]he 
burden of proving harmlessness falls squarely on the 
prosecution.”).  The trial court’s investigation of the totality of the circumstances is a necessary prerequisite to finding that 
the misconduct was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  See 
Amorin, 58 Haw. at 631, 574 P.2d at 900.     
Therefore, in this case the circuit court was required 
to investigate the totality of circumstances surrounding the outside influence to determine its impact on the jury’s 
impartiality.  See Williamson, 72 Haw. at 102, 807 P.2d at 596.  
The court’s investigation should have included, at a minimum, an examination of the foreperson.  In such an examination, the circuit court might have inquired as to whether the foreperson 
had heard and understood the court’s instruction not to “talk to 
the . . . witnesses”; whether there was a reason for not 
complying with this instruction; whether the foreperson gave the 
witness a business card with personal contact information in 
expectation of a response; whether the foreperson had approached 
any other witness; and whether the foreperson told other jurors or talked to other persons about his contact with Bowen.  The 
court might have also considered whether it was advisable to ask 
other jurors whether the contact between the foreperson and the 
witness was discussed during deliberations. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
30 
 Because Chin made a prima facie showing of juror 
misconduct of a nature that had the potential to substantially 
prejudice her right to a fair trial, the burden was on the State 
to rebut the presumption of prejudice by showing that the 
contact was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  In light of the 
absence of an inquiry by the circuit court as to the totality of 
the circumstances surrounding the potential misconduct, there 
was no showing by the State that such misconduct was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Therefore, it was error for the 
trial court to deny Chin’s motion for new trial without 
investigation into the totality of the circumstances surrounding 
the outside influence.   
III. CONCLUSION  
We reaffirm the procedure set forth in Williamson that 
applies when there is an allegation of an improper influence upon a jury.  This procedure calls for a court to initially 
determine whether the improper influence is generally of a 
nature that could substantially prejudice a defendant’s right to 
a fair trial.  Williamson, 72 Haw. at 102, 807 P.2d at 596.  If 
a court finds that the improper influence could be substantially prejudicial, then a rebuttable presumption of prejudice is raised, and the trial court must investigate the totality of the 
circumstances surrounding the outside influence.  Id.  When the 
alleged improper influence involves nontrivial contact between a ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
 
31 
 juror and a witness during trial, we hold that such contact 
raises a rebuttable presumption of prejudice, and a court is 
required to investigate the totality of the surrounding 
circumstances.   
  In this case, the circuit court was required to 
investigate the circumstances surrounding the nontrivial 
communication between a defense witness and the jury foreperson.  
Because the circuit court did not conduct such an investigation, we cannot conclude that Chin’s fundamental right to a fair trial 
by an impartial jury was not compromised.  Accordingly, the 
ICA’s December 5, 2014 Judgment on Appeal and the circuit 
court’s July 19, 2013 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence are 
vacated, and the case is remanded to the circuit court for a new 
trial.
