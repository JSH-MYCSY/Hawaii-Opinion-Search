OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.  
I. Introduction 
This consolidated appeal 
arises from an ejectment action 
initiated after a nonjudicial foreclosure on real property 
pursuant to Hawai‘ i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 667 -5 (Supp. 
2008), which was repealed in 2012.1 The Circuit Court of the 
First Circuit (“circuit court”) entered a Final Judgment in 
favor of Gerald Mount Jr. and Jane R. Mount (“the Mounts”), 
purchasers of the property through the nonjudicial foreclosure 
sale, and mortgagee U.S. Bank National Association, a National 
Association as Trustee for Structured Asset Securities Corp. 
Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2005-SC1 (“U.S. Bank”). The Final Judgment was entered against Margaret Apao 
(“Margaret”), sister of decedent Rose Marie Alvaro (“Alvaro”), 
and Dirk Apao, Margaret’s son , as personal representative of 
Alvaro’s estate (“Dirk”) (Margaret and Dirk are sometimes 
collectively referred to as “the Apaos”). 
With respect to the issues we address on certiorari, the 
circuit court ruled that a nonjudicial foreclosure conducted 
pursuant to HRS § 667-5 is a “proceeding to enforce a mortgage” 
under HRS § 560:3-803(d)(1), exempt from the time limits for 
presentation of claims against a decedent’s estate, set out by 
1 HRS § 667- 5 was in Part I of chapter 667 and was repealed by the 
legislature in 2012. 2012 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 182, § 50 at 684.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
other subsections of HRS § 560:3-803. The circuit court also 
ruled that U.S. Bank did not violate HRS § 667-5(c)(1) by 
failing to provide Dirk’s former co-personal representative 
Sesha Lovelace (“Lovelace”) with information she had requested 
regarding the funds that would be required to reinstate the loan 
and thereby cure the default (“reinstatement figures”). The 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) affirmed. 
The Apaos raise various issues on certiorari, including the 
following: 
1. Is a nonjudicial mortgage foreclosure under HRS § 667 -5 a 
“proceeding to enforce a mortgage” under HRS § 560:3-803(d)(1), 
and if not, did U.S. Bank fail to comply with HRS § 560:3 -
803(c)’s requirements for presentation of claims, thereby barring 
its claims? 
2.  Was the nonjudicial foreclosure conducted in violation of 
HRS § 667- 5(c)(1), when U.S. Bank failed to provide Lovelace with 
loan reinstatement figures? 
With respect to the first issue, we hold that a 
nonjudicial mortgage foreclosure conducted pursuant to HRS § 
667-5 is not a “proceeding to enforce a mortgage” under HRS § 
560-3-803(d)(1).  Therefore, a nonjudicial foreclosure conducted pursuant to HRS § 667-5 is not exempt from the time limits under 
HRS § 560:3-803 for presentation of claims against a decedent’s 
2 estate. 
2 HRS § 560-3- 803(c), the subsection at issue in this case, 
provides in relevant part: 
(c) All claims against a decedent’ s estate which arise at 
or after the death of the decedent [] are barred []unless 
presented as follows: 
(continued. . .)

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
With respect to the second issue, we hold that U.S. Bank’s 
failure to provide reinstatement figures to Lovelace violated 
HRS § 667-5(c)(1)’s requirement that “[u]pon the request of any 
person entitled to notice, the attorney [or] the mortgagee . . . 
shall disclose to the requestor . . . information . . . 
[regarding] the amount to cure the default. . . .” We further 
hold that this failure rendered the nonjudicial foreclosure sale 
voidable at the Est ate’s election, unless the Mounts are 
innocent purchasers for value; if the Mounts are innocent 
purchasers for value, then the circuit court must determine an 
appropriate remedy, which generally would be an award of 
damages. Santiago v. Tanaka, 137 Hawai i 137, 158, 366 P.3d 612, 
633 (2016) (holding that where the nonjudicial foreclosure of a 
property is wrongful, the sale of the property is invalid and 
voidable at the election of the mortgagor, who shall then regain 
title to and possession of the property, except where the 
property has passed into the hands of an innocent purchaser for 
value, under which circumstances, an action at law for damages 
is generally the appropriate remedy).

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Our resolution of the second issue resolves the Apaos’ 
remaining four issues on certiorari, which we therefore do not 
3address.
Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal and the 
circuit court’s Final Judgment along with all the orders, writs, 
and/or judgments referenced in the Final Judgment, and we remand 
the case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent 
with this opinion. 
II. Background 
A. The Estate and the Nonjudicial Foreclosure Proceeding 
In 1999, Alvaro obtained a loan for $500,000, secured by a 
mortgage (“the Mortgage”) and promissory note (“the Note”) on 
the subject real property located on the slopes of Diamond Head 
at 2979 Makalei Place, Honolulu, Hawai ‘i 96815 (“the Property”).4 
The Property was appraised in 2013 to have a fair market value 
of $3,535,000. 
3 Issues 3 through 6 on certiorari concerned whether: (3) the entry 
of the writ of possession prior to a separate, final judgment resulted in an 
unlawful splitting of the ejectment claim in violation of this court’s Separate Judgment Rule; (4) the award of attorneys’ fees and costs was 
erroneous because this case was not an action in the nature of assumpsit; (5) the damages award based in part on the amount the Mounts paid to rent an 
alternate property was clearly erroneous; and (6) the supplemental damages 
award for actual costs incurred in carrying out the eviction was erroneous.  
An assignment of Mortgage from Fremont Investment & Loan, the 
original mortgagee, to Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. as 
nominee for First Union National B ank (“MERS”) was recorded on August 30, 
2001, and, a second assignment from MERS to U.S. Bank was recorded on 
December 17, 2009.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Alvaro passed away on December 18, 2002.   On January 23, 
2003, a petition seeking informal probate of her will and  for 
appointment of personal representatives   was filed with the 
probate court in In the Matter of the Estate of Rose Marie 
Alvaro (“the Estate”) , Probate Case No. 03-1-0018.  Margaret  and 
Dirk were appointed  co-personal representatives of the Estate.  
A death certificate was filed in the informal probate  
proceeding. 
  
Margaret and Dirk 
apparently did not notify U.S. Bank or 
its mortgage servicer, American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc. 
(“AHMS”), of Alvaro’s deat h, but began making payments on the 
Note with the Estate’s funds . The Note apparently went into 
arrears around November of 2004.  A notice of Alvaro’s death 
and regarding the informal appointment of Margaret and Dirk as 
co-personal representatives in an unsupervised administration 
was published in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin on three dates in 
May 2005. The notice did not notify creditors of any deadlines to present their claims. 
Margaret apparently began living at the Property and 
collecting the mail in 2006 or 2007. By an order entered on 
July 11, 2007, the informal probate was converted to a formal 
probate proceeding. Dirk and Margaret remained as co-personal 
representatives.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Letters asserting default under the Note, addressed to  
Alvaro, were mailed  to the Property in 2008 and 2009; Margaret 
disputed receiving  them.   By March 1, 2009, the Note  was clearly 
in default. AHMS sent a letter addressed t  o Alvaro dated April  
16, 2009 (“Default Notice”) .   The Default Notice provided the 
amount to cure the default, $11,606.14, and stated that the loan 
would be accelerated if not cured within 30 days.    
Five months later, o
n August 5, 2009, Lovelace, as an 
Estate beneficiary, petitioned the probate court to remove Margaret and Dirk as co-personal representatives.  She alleged a 
conflict of interest between the Apaos and the Estate because 
they had been living on the Property rent-free for years.  
Lovelace also asserted: 
The current personal representatives would appear to have 
neglected their duties by failing to process this matter 
expeditiously. . . . Also, the Estate may owe additional 
penalties and taxes since the tax returns have not been 
filed on time. The estate may have claims against the current personal representatives for a surcharge. The 
current personal representatives are not in a position to 
handle fairly any such claims that the estate has against 
them. 
By the end of 2009, U.S. Bank was clearly aware of Alvaro’s 
death. On December 14, 2009, the law firm of Routh Crabtree 
Olson (“Routh Crabtree ”), as counsel for U.S. Bank, sent a 
“Notice Under Fair Debt Collection Practices Act” to the “Heirs 
and/or Devisees of Rose Marie Alvaro,” stating it had been 
retained to initiate foreclosure proceedings.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
On February 1, 2010, U.S. Bank recorded a Notice of Mortgagee’s 
Intent to Foreclose Under Power of Sale (“Notice of Intent to 
Foreclose”) in the Hawai ‘i Bureau of Conveyances, setting an 
auction date of April 1, 2010.  According to Routh Crabtree, 
the Notice of Intent to Foreclose was forwarded to all parties 
who had recorded encumbrances, liens and/or other claims against 
the Property. These parties included the “Heirs and/or Devisees 
of Rose Marie Alvaro,” “Dirk Apao Personal Representative for Rose Marie Alvaro,” and “Sesha Lovelace ,” apparently in her 
personal capacity as a beneficiary of the Estate.  
Later that month, pursuant to an order filed February 23, 
2010, Lovelace’s petition to remove the personal representatives 
was partially granted by the probate court, and Lovelace was 
substituted as a co-personal representative in place of Margaret 
to serve with Dirk.  This change in co-personal representatives 
was handwritten on a document entitled “Second Amended Letters 
Testamentary,” on which Margaret’s name was crossed out and 
Lovelace’s name was written above, and which was signed and certified by the clerk of the probate court.
5 
Although U.S. Bank was aware of Alvaro’s death, it 
continued to send correspondence addressed to Alvaro to the Property, which Margaret apparently received. Then, despite the 
5 Hawaii Probate Rules Rule 48 pertains to the “Delegation of 
Powers to Clerk and Deputy Clerks.” The fact that the letters were signed by 
the clerk and not the judge is not raised as an issue in this case.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
order two days earlier officially removing her as a co-personal 
representative, on February 25, 2010, Margaret, claiming to be 
Alvaro, called AMHS and obtained a verbal reinstatement quote of 
$72,645.42, valid until March 3, 2010,   which AHMS confirmed by 
a letter of the same date addressed to Alvaro and mailed to the Property. The following day, March 31, 2010, Margaret faxed 
this reinstatement amount and mortgage balance to Dirk.  
The day before, o
n March 30, 2010, Margaret had called AHMS 
again, asking for an updated reinstatement quote, first pretending to be Alvaro and then claiming to be a personal 
representative of the Estate. It appears that in order to 
establish her authorization to receive loan information, 
pursuant to AHMS’s request, Margaret faxed the first page of the 
July 11, 2007 probate court’s “Order Granting Petition to Transfer from Informal to Formal Proceeding and to Renew Letters 
Testamentary,” which had continued her and Dirk as co-personal 
representatives. 
U.S. Bank postponed the foreclosure    sale scheduled for  
April 1, 2010.  On April 19, 2010, AHMS mailed updated 
reinstatement figures to Margaret, reflecting a reinstatement 
amount totalling $80,138.32, which she appears to have also 
forwarded to Dirk. 
Ten months later, on February 3, 2011, 
U.S. Bank officially 
served the original  Notice of Intent to Foreclose on Lovelace as 
9

     
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
“as personal representative .” It also served Dirk “as personal 
representative” on February 5, 2011. This notice still 
reflected the foreclosure sale date of April 1, 2010, which had 
already passed. 
In any event, pursuant to the Notice of Intent to 
Foreclose, which directed inquiries to AHMS, Lovelace began 
requesting reinstatement figures soon after she was served.  
Although Routh Crabtree had served Lovelace with the Notice of 
Intent to Foreclose as a personal representative, AHMS 
questioned Lovelace’s authority to receive the reinstatement 
figures. Based on emails between Lovelace and her attorney, it appears that on February 9, 2011, her attorney faxed to AHMS the 
Second Amended Letters Testamentary of February 23, 2010.  On 
February 18, 2011, Lovelace emailed her attorney, however, 
stating, “The company will not accept this document because it 
doesn’t appear to be original with the na mes scratched out and 
hand written in. Is there another copy that is more 
professional and credible?” Lovelace also emailed her attorney 
that she was attempting to obtain the mortgage account number from Dirk because “[t]hey will not provide any informat ion 
without [it].” Lovelace made the following request to her 
attorney: 
Let me know once the documentation is faxed to American 
Home Mortgaging so I can follow -up with a phone call to 
determine the specifics on what is happening with [the Property]. I want to know exactly what we owe and how long 
10
     
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
they have been extending the issue before we make a final 
decision. I am concerned that the 6 month extention [sic] 
for the $250,000 would set us up for failure if [the 
Property] is foreclosed on. 
On February 23, 2011, Lovelace sent a follow-up email to 
Routh Crabtree. The next day, Routh Crabtree billing assistant 
Julie Cihak (“Cihak”) responded to Lovelace’s email, stating , “I 
need the borrower to send in a signed auth [sic] for us to give you the figures, also I have requested the reinstatement figures 
3 times and they have only supplied payoff figures I have 
requested again.” 
AHMS mailed two payoff  statements dated February 19 and 24, 
2011 to the Property,  reflecting payoff amounts of $567,635.26 
and $573,146.86. Margaret forwarded at least one of them to 
Dirk.  
On March 2, 2011, Lovelace provided the Estate account 
number to Cihak. 
On March 3, 2011, Cihak responded that AHMS 
still had not provided the reinstatement figures to her, but 
that she would send them to Lovelace as soon as they did. In 
addition, Routh Crabtee foreclosure analyst Candice Yoo (“Yoo”) 
emailed Lovelace to ask if she had received her quote and 
stated, “It looks like the sale is still set for 3-7-11.  I 
believe our fees and costs department have been working on 
obtaining a reinstatement quote for you.” Lovelace responded 
that she had not received the figures , and that “AHMSI is 
insisting that the auction is not scheduled because our property 
11
     
 
 
  
   
   
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
is not listed on their website. Can I trust that this is true? 
They are also saying that [Routh Crabtree]  is a third party and 
does not have the most updated information.”  
Yoo responded the following day
, March 3, 2011, to explain 
that the “sale is sti ll scheduled for 3-7-11, but I am having 
the sale postponed for two weeks for your reinstatement quote.” 
On March 7, 2011, Yoo informed Lovelace that the sale had been 
postponed to March 21, 2011, and asked if she had received the 
quote, to which Lovelace replied that she had not. 
On or about March 7, 2011, AHMS apparently posted a 
reinstatement  quote to LPS, a service that lenders and their 
attorneys use to facilitate communications between each other. According to this reinstatement quote, the reinstatement figure  
as of March 7, 2011 was $145,486.69. According to AHMS, this reinstatement quote was intended to be released to Lovelace “if 
and when she provided the required authorization.”  
Neither Lovelace, Margaret, or Dirk ever 
received 
reinstatement  figures at any time after April 2010, despite 
assurances to Lovelace that the March 7, 2011 continued 
foreclosure sale was being postponed in order to provide her 
with those figures. Despite these assurances, U.S. Bank 
conducted a foreclosure auction on April 4, 2011.  At the 
12

     
 
 
  
    
 
 
   
 
  
  
 
                         
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
auction, the Mounts purchased the Property through their 
company, Fair Horizon LLC,6 for approximately $1.21 million. 
On April 6, 2011, Lovelace emailed Cihak to state that she 
had not received the reinstatement information, but that the 
Property had been sold. On April 7, 2011, Routh Crabtree lead 
foreclosure analyst Monica Woodward told Lovelace that “Julie 
Cihak no longer works on Hawaii files[,]” and invited her to 
call regarding questions. On April 10, 2011, Lovelace emailed 
her attorney regarding her conversation with Woodward, stating, 
“[Woodward] explained to me that the lender would not accept the 
document in question which is why I never received the 
reinstatement amount. She emphasized that even though [Routh 
Crabtree] forwarded them the same document they wouldn’t accept 
it as reliable because of the handwritten notes.” 
Thus, U.S. Bank failed to provide Lovelace reinstatement 
figures, alleging she had failed to provide sufficient evidence 
of her status as a personal representative, despite having served her on February 3, 2011 with the Notice of Intent to 
Foreclose specifically identifying her as a personal 
representative of the Estate. 
6 The Mounts were identified as the nominee for Fair Horizon LLC.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
B. The Mounts’ Ejectment Action Against the Apaos 
The Mounts received a limited warranty deed to the Property 
from U.S. Bank, which was recorded on July 22, 2011. On 
September 7, 2011, the Mounts filed a Complaint in the circuit 
court against Margaret individually and Dirk and Lovelace as co-
personal representatives, asserting claims for ejectment (Count 
I) and quiet title (Count II) (“Complaint”) . 
On October 11, 2011, the Apaos filed a joint answer, 
asserting that the nonjudicial foreclosure and sale were illegal and void.  Dirk also filed a “Counterclaim and Third -Party 
Complaint for Wrongful Foreclosure, Quiet Title, and Damages ” 
against the Mounts and U.S. Bank for violation of the Probate 
Code, HRS § 560:3-803 (Count I), violation of HRS § 667-5 (Count 
II), violation of the Mortgage (Count III), and defective and 
fraudulent transfer of the Mortgage (Count IV) 
(“Counterclaim and Third-Party Complaint”) . On October 31, 
2011, Lovelace filed an answer alleging invalidity of the 
foreclosure sale and incorporating by reference the Apaos ’ 
pleadings. 
On May 16, 2012, Lovelace filed a motion to substitute Dirk 
or, in the alternative, to dismiss any and all claims by and against her pursuant to a “Stipulated Settlement and Release 
Agreement and Order” filed in the probate court proceeding on 
November 23, 2011 (“Stipulated Settlement”). The Stipulated

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Settlement allowed Lovelace to resign as a co-personal 
representative, but also required her to cooperate and assist 
the Estate in its defense of the ejectment and foreclosure 
7 proceedings involving the Property.   8 Although the circuit court  
denied Lovelace’s  motion  by order dated August 8, 2012,   claims 
against Lovelace were later dismissed by stipulation.   
The Mounts and the Apaos  filed various cross-motions for 
summary judgment on the Complaint, Counterclaim, and Third Party  
9 Complaint.   A consolidated hearing on the various motions was 
held on May 21, 2013. The circuit court first ruled that HRS § 
560:3-803(d)(1) exempted any proceeding to enforce a  mortgage  
7 Pursuant to the Stipulated Settlement, the named beneficiaries of 
Alvaro’s will agreed to an interim partial distribution of the assets of the 
Estate.” As part of the interim partial distribution, the Lovelace family 
received two apartment units owned by the Estate, $100,000 in cash paid to her attorney- client trust account, and a guarantee that the Estate would 
perform its obligations, including the payment of taxes. In exchange, the parties agreed to “waive and release any and all claims relating to the Estate and/or to any assets of the Estate against the Estate and against each 
other, including any claims that any of the Parties failed to perform any 
duties owed to the Estate or to each other as Beneficiaries or Co -Personal 
Representatives . . . .” 
8 The Honorable Karen T. Nakasone presided over the circuit court 
proceedings. 
9 With respect to their Complaint, the Mounts filed motions for (1) 
summary judgment on Count I for ejectment, and (2) partial summary judgment on the Count II for quiet title regarding (a) their status as bona fide 
purchasers for value, and (b) the validity of the nonjudicial foreclosure 
sale. The Mounts also filed a motion for summary judgment on the 
Counterclaim in its entirety. With respect to the Apaos’ Third-Party 
Complaint, U.S. Bank filed a motion for partial summary judgment on Count I 
alleging a violation of HRS § 560:3- 803’s presentation of claim requirement 
and Count IV alleging defective and fraudulent transfer of the Mortgage . 
Count IV was there after dismissed by stipulation. U.S. Bank also filed a 
substantive joinder in the Mounts’ motion for partial summary judgment as to 
Count II (quiet title) of their Complaint. The Apaos filed motions for (1) summary judgment on the Mounts’ complaint, and (2) partial summary judgment 
on the Counterclaim and Third -Party Complaint as to wrongful foreclosure and 
quiet title.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
from presentation of claims requirements, and that a nonjudicial 
foreclosure is such a “proceeding” under HRS § 560:1-201.  The 
circuit court also ruled that HRS § 667-5(c)(1) was not violated 
because Lovelace failed to establish her entitlement to the 
reinstatement figures, and that, therefore, the foreclosure sale 
was valid. The circuit court alternatively ruled that even if 
HRS § 667-5 had been triggered, U.S. Bank had complied with the 
requirement to provide the amount to cure because Dirk had 
received reinstatement figures through Margaret. Based on its 
ruling that the foreclosure sale was valid, the circuit court 
granted the Mounts and U.S. Bank partial summary judgment 
quieting title, granted the Mounts summary judgment on their 
ejectment claim and on the Counterclaim, and denied the Apaos’ 
cross-motions for summary judgment on the Complaint and for partial summary judgment on the Counterclaim and Third-Party 
Complaint. In light of its ruling, the circuit court deemed 
moot the Mounts’ motion for partial summary judgment alleging 
bona fide purchaser status, and the Mounts withdrew that motion. 
These rulings were memorialized in orders filed on July 25 and 
26, 2013.  
The circuit court entered a writ of ejectment on July 25, 
2013, granting the Mounts possession of the Property. Four days 
later, the circuit court entered a Judgment, reserving the issue 
of the Mounts’ alleged damages.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
On August 6, 2013,  the Apaos appealed the July 29, 2013  
Judgment, as well as the orders (1) granting the Mounts summary 
judgment as to Count II of the C omplaint and U.S. Bank’s 
joinder, (2) granting the Mounts summary judgment as to Count I of the Complaint, (3) granting the Mounts summary judgment as to 
the Counterclaim, (4) denying the Apaos summary judgment as to 
the Complaint and partial summary judgment on the Counterclaim 
and Third-Party Complaint , (5) denying the Apaos’ request for 
judicial notice of their motion to dismiss filed in the district 
court, and (6) granting U.S. Bank partial summary judgment on 
Counts I and IV of the Third-Party Complaint.  This appeal  
initiated CAAP-13-2610.  On August 9, 2013, the Apaos were apparently served with a writ of execution, and were informed 
that they had 48 hours to vacate the property.   The Apaos 
appealed the Writ of Possession  on August 22, 2013, initiating 
CAAP-13-2977.  After a hearing on the Mounts ’  request for 
damages, the circuit court awarded the Mounts damages against 
the Apaos in the amount of $237,504.81 as well as attorneys ’  
fees and costs in the amount of $208,592.23.  The circuit court also awarded U.S. Bank attorneys’ fees and costs of $175,423.45. 
On March 13, 2014, the circuit court entered a  Final Judgment  
reflecting its various rulings.   The Apaos appealed the circuit 
court’s Final Judgment , initiating CAAP-14-556

 10  The Apaos presented four additional points of error, arguing that 
(1) the award of attorneys’ fees and costs to U.S. Bank and the Mounts was 
erroneous because this case was not an action in the nature of assumpsit; (2) 
the circuit court erred in entering the writ without first entering a 
separate judgment, and further, that its July 29, 2013 judgment violates the 
Separate Judgment Rule, resulting in an unlawful splitting of the ejectment 
claim; (3) the award of damages was clearly erroneous and inequitable where 
the Mounts failed to timely file their request, were not entitled to damages 
based on their rental of another unidentified property, and received a 
windfall from the extremely low sale price, and the dispute was not in the 
nature of assumpsit; and (4) the award of supplemental damages was clearly 
erroneous.

C. Appeal to the ICA 
The ICA consolidated the three appeals (CAAP-13-2610, CAAP-
13-2977, and CAAP-14-556) under CAAP-13  -2977 by orders dated 
November 13, 2013 and November 18, 2014.  
With respect to the issues on certiorari, the Apaos’ first 
point of error argued that the circuit court erred in granting 
judgment in favor of the Mounts and U.S. Bank and against the 
Apaos because the nonjudicial foreclosure was conducted in 
violation of (1) the Hawai ‘i Probate Code, because U.S. Bank  
failed to make a proper claim against the Estate by raising it 
in the probate case or filing a judicial foreclosure action, and 
(2) HRS § 667-5, because  reinstatement information was not 
10 provided to Lovelace after her  request.  
The ICA rejected the Apaos’ points of error as “witho  ut 
merit.”   Mount, SDO at 4.   First, the ICA  affirmed the circuit 
The ICA determined that a sixth point of error, that the circuit court 
abused its discretion in setting an outrageously high supersedeas 
bond, was 
waived under Hawai‘ i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(7) because the 
Apaos made no argument to support it. Mount v. Apao,  CAAP-13-2977, at 3 n.3 
(App. Jan. 9, 2015) (SDO).

  U.S. Bank, through American Home Mortgage Servicing 
(AHMS), provided Alvaro’ s Estate (Estate) with 
reinstatement information over the phone with Margaret on 
February 25, 2010, and by letters dated February 25, 2010 
and April 19, 2010 and mailed to the Property where 
Margaret was residing, and also through two pay -off 
statements in February 2011, at least one of which Margaret 
received and shared with Dirk. The fact that Margaret 
received the information after resigning as co  -personal 
representative (Co –PR) is irrelevant because Margaret 
misrepresented herself to AHMS as a Co –PR of the Estate and 
shared the reinstatement information she received with Dirk. Also, U.S. Bank informed Lovelace  that it would 
provide her with the reinstatement information she 
requested if she could provide U.S. Bank with the Estate ’s 
account number and a credible document showing that she was a Co–PR, but Lovelace did not provide U.S. Bank with 
either. U.S. Bank did not violate HRS § 667 –5(a)(2) because 
it provided the Apaos with reinstatement information, and did not violate HRS § 667 –5(c)(1) because Lovelace failed 
to establish that she was a “person entitled to notice” under HRS § 667 –5.

court’s ruling that “[t]he non  -judicial foreclosure was an 
exempt proceeding under HRS § 560:3-803(d)(1) because it was a 
proceeding to enforce a mortgage.” Mount, SDO at 6.   Next, with 
respect to the alleged HRS § 667-5 violation, the ICA ruled that

Judgment in favor of the Mounts and U.S. Bank on all claims.  
D. The Apaos’ Application for Writ of Certiorari 
As noted, we address the first two issues raised by the 
Apaos because they are dispositive  of the remaining issues.  The 
Apaos argue that the ICA  gravely erred  in (1) holding that a   
nonjudicial mortgage foreclosure  conducted  under HRS § 667-5 is 
exempt from the Hawai i Probate Code limitation of claims 
requirements; (2) affirming the Final Judgment in favor of the 
Mounts and U.S. Bank and against the Apaos on all claims because

Standards of Review 
A. Statutory Interpretation 
The standard of review for statutory construction is well -
established. The interpretation of a statute is a question 
of law which [the appellate] court reviews de novo. Where the language of the statute is plain and unambiguous, our 
only duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious 
meaning. 
Sierra Club v. Dep’ t of Transp.,  120 Hawai i 181, 197, 202 
P.3d 1226, 1242 (2009)  (internal citations omitted).  
B. Motion for Summary Judgment 
[An appellate] court reviews a trial court’s grant of 
summary judgment de novo. Oahu Transit Servs., Inc. v. 
Northfield Ins. Co. , 107 Hawaii 231, 234, 112 P.3d 717, 720 
(2005).  The standard for granting a motion for summary 
judgment is well settled:  
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and 
admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if 
any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled 
to judg
ment as a matter of law.  A fact is material 
if proof of that fact would have the effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential 
elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The evidence must be viewed in the 
light most favorable to the non -moving party.  In 
other words, [the appellate court] must view all of the evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in 
the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.

IV. Discussion 
A.	 A nonjudicial f oreclosure is not a “proceeding to enforce a 
mortgage” exempt from HRS § 560:3-803, which sets time 
limitations for the presentation of claims against a decedent’s estate . 
In their first question on certiorari, the Apaos assert 
that U.S. Bank was prohibited from pursuing its claim because a 
HRS § 667-5 nonjudicial foreclosure is not a “proceeding to 
enforce a mortgage” exempt from HRS § 560:3-803(c)’s bar against 
claims against a decedent’s estate not presented within a 
prescribed time limit. The Apaos also assert that U.S. Bank’s 
claim was not timely filed against the Estate. 
HRS § 560:3-803 (1997), provides in relevant part as 
follows: 
§560:3-803 Limitations on presentation of claims. 
(c) All claims against a decedent's estate which arise at 
or after the death of the decedent []are barred [] unless 
presented as follows: 
. . . . 
(2) . . . [W]ithin []four months after it 
arises. . . . 
(d) Nothing in this section affects or prevents: 
(1) Any proceeding to enforce any mortgage, pledge, 
or other lien upon property of the estate. . . . 
Whether a nonjudicial foreclosure conducted pursuant to HRS 
§ 667-5 is a “proceeding to enforce a mortgage” under HRS § 
21
     
 
 
  
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
560:3-803(d)(1) exempt from the presentation of claims time  
limits reflected in other subsections of HRS § 560:3-803 is a 
matter of first impression  in Hawai i.  Both the circuit court 
and ICA ruled that a  nonjudicial foreclosure conducted pursuant 
to HRS § 667-5 so qualifies  .  The Apaos assert that this ruling 
was in error. For the following reasons, we agree.  
According to HRS § 560:1-201, “`Proceeding’ includes an 
action at law or a suit in equity. ” Black’s Law Dictionary  
defines an “action at law” as “[a] civil suit stating a legal 
cause of action and seeking only a legal remedy.” Black’s Law 
Dictionary
 35 (10th ed. 2014). It defines “suit in equity” as 
“A civil suit stating an equitable claim and asking for an exclusively equitable remedy.” Id. at 1663.  “Suit” is defined 
as “[a]ny proceeding . . . in a court of law.” Id.  
Historically, before the merger of legal and equitable 
actions, actions at law were triable by a jury, while suits  in 
equity were heard by a judge. Mehau v. Reed, 76 Hawai i 101,  
110, 869 P.2d 1320, 1329 (1994). 
Both actions at law and suits 
in equity, however, were presented in courts.  Yet, a  
nonjudicial foreclosure, by its very nature, avoids the court 
system. See  Lee v. HSBC Bank USA , 121 Hawai ‘i 287, 289, 218 P.3d 
775, 777 (2009) (explaining that HRS § 667-5 “authorizes 
nonjudicial foreclosure under a power of sale clause contained

12   See also County of Haw. v. C&J Coupe Family Limited Partnership  , 
119 Hawai i  352, 365, 198 P.3d 615, 628 (2008), referring to 
Dictionary  Black’s Law 
to define “proceedings” in the context of HRS § 101 -27.   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
in a mortgage”); Santiago , 137 Hawai‘ i at 155, 366 P.3d at 630 
(“HRS § 667–5 does not provide the nonjudicial power of 
foreclosure but only allows its creation, if the parties choose to do so, within the four corners of a contract. ”) (citations 
omitted). Thus, a nonjudicial foreclosure is in the nature of a 
contractual self-help remedy, Lee, 121 Hawai ‘i at 292, 218 P.3d 
at 780, and is not “an action in law or a suit in equity.” 
U.S. Bank correctly argues, however, that according to HRS 
§ 1-201, a “proceeding” includes “an action in law or a suit in 
equity.” Thus, a “proceeding,” by definition, is not limited to 
“an action in law or a suit in equity.” Therefore, if a 
nonjudicial foreclosure conducted pursuant to HRS § 667-5 is a 
“proceeding,” it could be a “proceeding to enforce a mortgage 
even if it does not qualify as “an action in law or a suit in 
equity.” 
“Proceeding” is not further defined by HRS § 560:1-201. 
“Because the term is not statutorily defined, this court ‘ may 
resort to legal or other well accepted dictionaries as one way to determine [its] ordinary meaning.’” Gillan v. Government 
Employees Ins. Co., 119 Hawai i 109, 116, 194 P.3d 1071, 1078 
12 (2008).  
23
     
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
         
13   Although another state’s interpretation of similar statutes 
would not be binding on this court , it could be persuasive.  In this regard, 
we note that HRS §§ 560:1  -201 and 560:3  -803 are  part of the Hawai i Uniform 
Probate Code and that the Uniform Probate Code has been adopted by many other 
states. Despite the many nonjudicial foreclosures nationwide, U.S. Bank does 
not cite a single case construing “proceeding to enforce a mortgage” under 
the probate code to include a nonjudicial foreclosure.                    
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Black’s Law Dictionary  defines “proceeding” as follows : 
1. The regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit, including 
all acts and events between the time of commencement and entry of 
judgment. 2. Any procedure means for seeking redress from a 
tribunal or agency. 3. An act or step that is part of a larger 
action. 4. The business conducted by a court or other official 
body; a hearing. 5. Bankruptcy. A particular dispute or matter 
arising within a pending case – as opposed to the case as a 
whole. . . . 
“Proceeding” is a word much used to expr ess the business 
done in courts. A proceeding in court is an act done by 
the authority or direction of the court, expr ess or 
implied. It is more comprehensive than the word ‘ action,’ 
but it may include in its general sense all the steps taken 
or measures adopted in the prosecution or defense of an 
action, including the pleadings and judgment. . . . 
The  definition continues to further explain “action,” making it 
clear that “action” also means a lawsuit brought in court. Id. 
The definition lists  various types of “proceedings.” With one 
exception, “administrative proceeding,” all of the examples 
concern matters in court.   
A nonjudicial foreclosure conducted pursuant to  HRS § 667-5 
is a contractual self-help remedy and is not conducted under the 
auspices of or supervised by any court or administrative agency. 
Therefore, it is not a “`proceeding’ to enforce a mortgage”  
13 under HRS § 560:1-803(d)(1).   Thus, U.S. Bank’ s nonjudicial 
foreclosure against the Estate was  not exempt from  the 
24
     
 
 
                          
   
    
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
presentation of claim requirement and deadline under HRS § 
560:3-803.   
U.S. Bank alternatively argues that even if a nonjudicial 
foreclosure is not a “proceeding to enforce a mortgage,” it met 
the presentation of claims requirement of HRS § 560:3-803(c)(2).  
It asserts that the April 16, 2009 Default Notice, which was 
mailed to the Property, where Margaret resided,  satisfied HRS § 
14 560:3-804(1),  and was timely presented  within four months of 
the  Estate’s default in early  2009, as required by HRS § 560:3-
803(c)(2).  
The circuit court did not address this alternative 
argument, which involves  factual issue s.  We therefore do not  
decide whether U.S. Bank  met the presentation of claim  
14 HRS § 560:3 -804(1) provides: 
§560:3-804 Manner of presentation of claims. Claims 
against a decedent's estate may be presented as follows: 
(1) The claimant may deliver or mail to the personal 
representative a written statement of the claim indicating its 
basis, the name and address of the claimant, and the amount claimed, or may file a written statement of the claim, in the 
form prescribed by rule, with the clerk of the court. The claim 
is deemed presented on the first to occur of receipt of the 
written statement of claim by the personal representative, or the 
filing of the claim with the court. If a claim is not yet due, the date when it will become due shall be stated. If the claim 
is contingent or unliquidated, the nature of the uncertainty 
shall be stated. If the claim is secured, the security shall be 
described. Failure to describe correctly the security, the 
nature of any uncertainty, and the due date of a claim not yet due does not i nvalidate the presentation made. . . .

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
requirement with respect to the nonjudicial foreclosure and, if 
not, the effect of any such failure. These issues are not 
before us. We merely address the question of law raised in the 
certiorari application and hold that a nonjudicial foreclosure 
conducted pursuant to HRS § 667-5 is not a “proceeding to 
enforce a mortgage” under HRS § 560:3-803(d)(1), as further 
defined by HRS § 560:1-201, exempt from HRS § 560:3-803’s time 
limits for presentation of cla ims against a decedent’s estate . 
B.	 The nonjudicial foreclosure sale was conducted in violation 
of HRS § 667-5(c)(1), which requires that information to reinstate a loan be provided within five days of a request, rendering the sale voidable, unless the Mounts are innocent 
purchasers for value. 
We next address the second issue on certiorari, whether the 
nonjudicial foreclosure sale was conducted in violation of HRS § 
667-5(c)(1), based on U. S. Bank’s failure to provide 
reinstatement figures to Lovelace in 2011 and, if so, the appropriate remedy. 
1.	 As personal representative, Dirk has standing 
to assert U.S. Bank’s failure to provide Lovelace 
with reinstatement figures, as Lovelace was acting 
as a co-personal representative when she made the request. 
As a preliminary matter, U.S. Bank asserts that the Apaos 
lack standing to raise the issue of its alleged failure to 
provide Lovelace with reinstatement figures in 2011. As 
explained above, although U.S. Bank served Lovelace with a 
Notice of Intent to Foreclose in February 2011 as a personal 
26
     
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
                         
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
representative of the Estate, it refused to provide her with the 
reinstatement figures. We therefore address U.S. Bank’s 
threshold argument that the Apaos lack standing to raise a HRS § 
667-5(c)(1) violation.  Keahole Def. Coal., Inc. v. Bd. of Land 
& Nat. Res., 110 Hawai ‘i 419, 427, 134 P.3d 585, 593 (2006), as 
amended  (May 26, 2006)  (standing may be addr essed at any stage 
of a case).   
As noted, in the Final Judgment, all claims against 
Lovelace were dismissed, and the Counterclaim and Third
-Party 
Claim were brought only by Dirk.  At all relevant times, Dirk 
was a co-personal representative of the Estate with Lovelace.  
Dirk now remains as sole personal representative of the Estate. He asserted claims against U.S. Bank and the Mounts as a co-
personal representative on behalf of the Estate. U.S. Bank 
asserts that Dirk also lacks “standing ” because Lovelace’s 
request allegedly was not made on behalf of the Estate, but rather, to evaluate a settlement in the probate proceeding in 
which she and her family were adverse to the Estate.
15 We 
disagree. 
15 In her deposition, Lovelace testified that she hired an attorney 
in 2008 to bring the probate case against Margaret and Dirk due to “[y]ears 
of non- action on their part and mismanagement of the estate[,]” includ ing 
non-payment of taxes, and failure to make any effort to distribute assets to 
the beneficiaries. 
27
     
 
 
  
  
   
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
With respect to U.S. Bank’s assertion, whether or not 
Lovelace asserted claims against the Estate before being 
appointed a co-personal representative, there is no dispute that 
Lovelace requested reinstatement information beginning in 
February 2011 only after she was served with the Notice of 
Intent to Foreclose, and that she requested reinstatement in her 
capacity as co-personal representative, acting on behalf of the 
Estate. 
A personal representative is a fiduciary acting on behalf 
of an estate. HRS § 560:3-703(a)(1997).  Actions taken by a 
personal representative that are beneficial to an estate inure 
to the benefit of the estate. HRS § 560:3-701 (1996).  As 
Lovelace’s requests for reinstatement figures were made on 
behalf of the Estate, any rights that inure to the Estate based 
upon her requests for reinstatement figures belong to the 
Estate. Dirk, as the current sole personal representative  of 
the Estate, therefore has standing to raise the  HRS § 667-
5(c)(1) violation on behalf of the Estate.   
2.	 U.S. Bank violated HRS § 667-5(c)(1) by not providing 
Lovelace with reinstatement figures. 
HRS § 667-5(c)(1) provides in relevant part: 
(c) Upon the request of any person entitled to notice 
pursuant to this section and sections 667 –5.5 and 667– 6, 
the attorney, the mortgagee, successor, or person 
represented by the attorney shall disclose to the 
requestor the following information: 
(1) The amount to cure the default, together with the 
estimated amount of the foreclosing mortgagee’s 
28
     
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
attorneys’ fees and costs, and all other fees and 
costs estimated to be incurred by the foreclosing 
mortgagee related to the default prior to the auction 
within  five business days of the request[.]  
In Santiago, 137 Hawai i 137, 366 P.3d 612, we stated: 
The purpose that prompted the addition of HRS § 667 – 
5(c)  to the foreclosure statute in 2008 was to “ensure that 
the different nonjudicial foreclosure processes include 
provisions for interested parties to receive sufficient 
notice and obtain information  about the intent to foreclose 
[and] amounts to cure the mortgage default .” Conf. Comm. 
Rep. No. 3– 08, in 2008 House Journal at 1710, 2008 Senate 
Journal at 793. Evident from the legislative history of HRS § 667– 5(c)  is the recognition that the right to cure a 
default is intrinsic in the law and that, therefore, HRS § 
677–5(c) merely codified this right to ensure that 
interested parties were adequately apprised of it.  
The common -law right to cure a default originated 
from the fundamental premise that mortgage foreclosure is a 
proceeding equitable in nature and is thus governed by the 
rules of equity.  Because equity abhors forfeitures, and 
regards and treats as done what ought to be done, it is typical in foreclosure cases that a right to cure a default 
and stop the foreclosure continues up to the day of the confirmation of the sale. T hus, Hawaii’ s courts 
would not 
prevent a mortgagor from curing the default  and halting the 
foreclosure prior to the entry of a written order 
confirming the foreclosure sale.  Accordingly, our 
interpretation that HRS § 667– 5(c)  provides a right to cure  
is directed by HRS § 667– 5(c)’s codification of the same 
right under the common law. To hold otherwise would be to 
disregard the emanating purpose of HRS § 667– 5(c) and to  
indirectly nullify the common -law right to cure as 
incorporated in HRS § 667– 5(c).   
Id., 137 Hawai i at 631-32, 366 P.3d 156-57 (emphases in 
original, internal footnotes, case citations, and case quotation 
marks omitted). The circuit court and the ICA ruled that HRS § 
667-5(c)(1) was not triggered because Lovelace failed to 
establish herself as entitled to notice. They alternatively 
ruled that U.S. Bank had complied with the requirement to 
provide reinstatement figures because Dirk had received 
reinstatement figures on two occasions through Margaret in 
29
     
 
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORT AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
February and April of 2010, and two payoff statements in 
February 2011.  U.S. Bank also argues that it did not have a 
“continuing obligation to provide reinstatement figures at the 
whim of the Estate after having previously complied.”  
Dirk, on the other hand, 
argues that U.S. Bank’s failure to 
provide reinstatement  figures to Lovelace after her repeated 
requests from February 2011 until the foreclosure sale on April 
4, 2011 render the nonjudicial foreclosure sale void.  
Even if U.S. Bank had provided reinstatement figures to 
Margaret in February and April  of 2010, there is no dispute that 
U.S. Bank, for whatever reason, aborted  the original nonjudicial 
foreclosure sale scheduled for April 1, 2010.  Ten months later, 
on February 3, 2011, it served the Notice of Intent to Foreclose 
on Lovelace as a personal representative (which still reflected  
a foreclosure sale date of April 1, 2010).   Reinstatement 
figures from early 2010 which were less than $90,000, were 
obviously no longer valid in early 2011, and were not the amounts required to “cure” the default. As conceded by AHMS, 
the reinstatement figure was  actually  $145,486.69 as of March 7, 
2011. This was the amount required to “cure” the default. The 
fact that AHMS mailed two 
payoff  statements dated February 19 
and 24, 2011 to the Property,  reflecting payoff amounts of 
$567,635.26 and $573,146.86 is immaterial, because these amounts 
were not necessary to “cure” the default.

  After U.S. Bank ’s  attorneys served Lovelace with the  
Notice of Intent to Foreclose as personal representative of the 
Estate, AHMS refused to provide her with reinstatement figures,  
alleging that she had to provide proof that she was a personal representative entitled to reinstatement figures. Her alleged 
failure to provide sufficient authorization to receive the 
figures was the sole reason given by AHMS for refusing to 
provide Lovelace with the reinstatement figures.  HRS § 667-
5(c)(1), however, explicitly obligated U.S. Bank and/or its 
attorney to provide Lovelace with information regarding the 
amount required to cure the default. Therefore, Routh Crabtree 
repeatedly attempted   to secure reinstatement figures to provide 
to Lovelace. Even though Routh Crabtree had explicitly 
acknowledged Lovelace as a personal representative and informed 
AHMS that she was entitled to reinstatement figures, AHMS 
ignored Routh Crabtree and told Lovelace it would not provide 
her with reinstatement figures unless  she provided satisfactory 
evidence that she was a personal representative. She therefore 
emailed the order appointing her  as co-personal representative, 
yet AHMS refused to accept it on the grounds it had handwritten  
information on it.

was entitled to receive the reinstatement figures she was 
requesting and repeatedly postponed the foreclosure sale. Yet, 
for whatever reason, the foreclosure sale took place on April 4, 
2011. 
As a co-personal representative of the Estate, Lovelace 
requested  reinstatement figures after U.S. Bank’s decis ion to 
proceed with the nonjudicial foreclosure sale in early 2011. 
Dirk’s receipt of reinstate ment figures in  early 2010 did  not 
eliminate U.S. Bank’s  obligation to provide “cure” or 
reinstatement figures in early 2011, after it chose to abort  the 
April 2010 foreclosure sale, then rescheduled it in 2011. In 
addition, whether or not Margaret received  payoff  figures in 
February 2011, and whether she provided those figures to Dirk is 
immaterial, as the “amount to cure the default” under HRS § 667 -
5(c)(1) were the reinstatement  figures, as clearly acknowledged 
by AHMS and Routh Crabtree.  
Based on the undispute
d factual chronology and record of 
this case, U.S. Bank’s argument that it did not have a 
“continuing obligation to pro vide reinstatement figures at the 
whim of the Estate after having previously complied ” is devoid 
of merit.  Even its law firm acknowledge d U.S. Bank’s obligation 
to provide reinstatement figures to Lovelace before proceeding with a foreclosure sale. Therefore, U.S. Bank failed to comply 
with its obligation under HRS § 667-5(c)(1).

The Mounts and U.S. Bank argue that the Apaos’ 
interpretation of HRS § 667-5(c) is pre-empted by the federal 
Gramm Leach Bliley Act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 6801 et seq. (“GLBA”) “to 
the extent it required the mortgagee to provide reinstatement information to anyone other than the customer on the account, 
unless the person requesting the information established that 
he/she was legitimately entitled to receive the information.” 
Regarding the protection of nonpublic personal information, the 
GLBA provides, in pertinent part, “I t is the policy of the 
Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers 
and to protect the security and confidentiality of those 
customers’ nonpublic personal information.” 15 U.S.C.A. § 
6801(a). In addition, the GLBA pre-empts state laws that are 
inconsistent with the GLBA “only to the extent of the 
inconsistency.” 15 U.S.C.A. § 6807(a). This argument lacks 
merit because Lovelace was obviously entitled to receive the 
information, as clearly acknowledged by U.S. Bank’s law firm . 
3.	 The foreclosure sale is voidable, unless the Mounts 
are innocent purchasers for value. 
Based on U.S. Bank’s failure to provide reinstatement or 
cure information to Lovelace, as required by HRS § 667-5(c)(1), 
the nonjudicial foreclosure sale was conducted in violation of 
HRS § 667-5.

As far back as 1884, this court voided a mortgage sale of 
real estate and livestock because the mortgagee had not complied 
with the conditions of the power of sale by scheduling the 
foreclosure sale one day too early. Silva v. Lopez , 5 Haw. 262 
(1884) In Lee, 121 Hawai i at 296, 218 P.3d at 784, we held that  
“an agreement created at a foreclosure sale conducted pursuant 
to HRS section 667-5 is void and unenforceable where the 
foreclosure sale is invalid under the statute. The Ninth 
Circuit Court of Appeals has noted that  , under Hawai i law,  
“[m]ortgagee violations of the nonjudicial foreclosure 
requirements of HRS § 667-5, whether those violations are 
grievously prejudicial or merely technical, voids a subsequent 
foreclosure sale. . . .”  In re Kekauoha-Alisa, 674 F.3d 1083, 
1089-90 (9th Cir. 2012).  
The facts in Lee  and Kekauoha-Alisa  differ from the facts 
in this case. In Lee, the high bidder at the nonjudicial  
foreclosure sale had not completed the sale. 121 Hawai i  at 289.  
Under those facts, we held that the sale was void and that the 
high bidder was entitled only to return of his down payment plus  
accrued interest. Id.   In Kekauoha-Alisa, the lender itself had 
purchased the property through a credit bid, so no third party 
was involved.   674 F.3d at 1086.

In this case, however, the Mounts completed the sale, took 
possession of the Property, and have now had the Property for 
some time, similar to the facts in Santiago . In Santiago, we 
held that “[w]here it is determined that the nonjudicial  
foreclosure of a property is wrongful, the sale of the property 
is invalid and voidable at the election of the mortgagor, who 
shall then regain title to and possession of the property .”   137 
Hawai‘i at 158, 3 66 P.3d at 633.  We also held that  where the 
property has passed into the hands of an innocent purchaser for 
value, rendering the voiding of a foreclosure sale 
impracticable, an action at law for damages is generally the  
appropriate remedy.   Id.  
As noted earlier, based on its other rulings in favor of 
the Mounts, the circuit court deemed moot their motion for 
partial summary judgment alleging bona fide purchaser status, 
and the Mounts withdrew that motion. Therefore, the circuit 
court never addressed whether the Mounts qualify as “inn ocent 
purchasers for value” under the Santiago rule. Upon remand, the 
circuit court is to apply Santiago to determine an appropriate 
remedy for the wrongful foreclosure. 
U.S. Bank’s nonjudicial foreclosure was conducted in 
violation of the requirements of HRS § 667-5(c)(1).16 Because 
As stated in footnote 1 , HRS § 667 –5 was repealed in 2012, before 
the filing of the Final Judgment.  The repeal of HRS § 667 –5, however, does

the foreclosure sale was wrongful we need not address the 
additional issues raised by the Apaos concerning the writ of 
possession, damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs , as those 
rulings are also vacated. 
V. Conclusion 
Based on the foregoing, we vacate the ICA’s Judgment on 
Appeal and the circuit court’s Final Judgment along with all the 
orders, writs, and/or judgments referenced 
in the Final 
Judgment, and we remand the case to the circuit court for 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

law shall not affect any act done, or any right accruing, accrued, acquired, 
or established, or any suit or proceedings had or commenced in any civil 
case, before the time when the repeal takes effect.” See Graham Constr.

Because the nonjudicial foreclosure was conducted pursuant to HRS § 667 -5, 
its repeal does not affect this appeal.
