SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
I. Introduction 
On January 19, 2013, Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant 
Colin Gardner (“Gardner”) was cited by Officer Carl Eguia 
(“Officer Eguia” or “Citing Officer”) for excessive speeding.  
At a bench trial in the District Court of the Second Circuit, 
Wailuku Division (“district court”),1 Gardner orally moved to 
suppress the Citing Officer’s laser gun reading on the basis

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
that proper foundation for the gun had not been laid. The 
district court denied the motion and found Gardner guilty. 
Gardner timely applied for writ of certiorari 
(“Application”) on September 29, 2015 from an August 3, 2015 
Judgment entered by the Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) 
pursuant to its June 30, 2015 Summary Disposition Order (“SDO”). 
Although the State submitted a confession of error in its 
Answering Brief, the ICA affirmed the district court ’s “Notice 
of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed on 
July 19, 2003.”2 State v. Gardner , No. CAAP-13-0002852, at 7 
(App. June 30, 2015) (SDO). 
In his Application, Gardner presents the following 
question: “Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that the 
prosecution established a sufficient foundation for the 
admission of the speed reading generated by the Laser Technology 
Incorporated 20-20 TruSpeed laser gun.” Gardner argues two 
points: (1) “the State failed to establish that the nature and 
extent of Officer Eguia’s training in the operation of the laser 
gun met the requirements set forth by the manufacturer,” and (2) 
“the State did not prove that the specific laser device used was 
properly calibrated either through inspection or servicing by 
the manufacturer’s representatives.” Gardner asks that the 
2 After the Notice of Appeal was filed, the district court amended the 
judgment on May 6, 2014 with respect to the value of the fine and imposition 
of community service.

district court’s judgment be reversed. The State did not 
respond to the Application. 
This court accepted Gardner’s Application on November 
10, 2015. For the following reasons, this court holds the ICA 
erred in concluding that the laser speed reading was admissible. 
II. Background 
A. Factual Background 
Around 4:00 p.m. on January 9, 2013, Officer Carl 
Eguia tested his LTI 20/20 TruSpeed laser gun (“laser gun”) to see if it was working properly.   The laser gun passed the 
requisite tests. Around 6:43 p.m. that same day, Officer Eguia observed a vehicle traveling north on Mokulele Highway “at a 
high rate of speed” in a 45 -miles-per-hour zone.  He used his 
laser gun to take a reading of the vehicle’s speed  by aiming at 
the vehicle’s front “license plate area .”   The laser gun 
indicated that the vehicle was traveling at 76 miles per hour. 
Officer Eguia then conducted a traffic  stop on the vehicle, and  
issued the driver of the vehicle, Gardner, Citation No. 2DTC-13-
004202, for violating “HRS 291C -105(a)(1) Excessive Speeding –  
3  30+ MPH over speed limit.”   
3 “No person shall drive a motor veh icle at a speed exceeding . . . [t]he 
applicable state or county speed limit by thirty miles per hour or more.” 
HRS § 291C- 105(a)(1) (2007).

B. District Court Proceedings 
A bench trial was held on July 19, 2013.   Officer 
Eguia testified as to the events of January 9, 2013, and the 
extent of his training with respect to the laser gun. 
Specifically, Officer Eguia was trained on August 24, 2012 to 
“test[] and operate[]” the laser gun by way of classroom 
instruction and written and practical tests. As part of the  
training, Officer Eguia  was given and read the “LTI 20 -20 
TruSpeed laser manual,” which the course “went through.” The 
training covered topics such as “the utilization of the laser, 
how to test and make sure that it’s working properly[,] . . . 
how to get speeds of vehicles[,] . . .  what to do if the laser 
is not working properly[,]  and how to down [take out of 
commission] the laser itself.” During the course, Officer Eguia  
“practiced . . . doing the four tests that have to be conducted  
[prior to taking the laser on the roadway, and upon returning] ”  
to ensure the laser gun was working properly.     
Officer Eguia’s instructor was f ellow Officer Dennis 
Arns (“Officer Arns” ), who was certified as an instructor by Bob 
Long (“Mr. Long”), a representative of LTI, the laser gun’s 
manufacturer.4 Officer Eguia was subsequently also instructed by 
Mr. Long on how to instruct a course on the laser gun’s use. 
4 Mr. Long was not an employee with LTI, however. Officer Eguia had testified 
that he “[n]ever met anybody actua lly from LTI who is employed by LTI .”

  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
After Officer Eguia was excused, Gardner moved to 
suppress the reading from the laser gun on the basis that the 
proper foundation pursuant to State v. Gonzalez , 128 Hawai i 314,  
288 P.3d 788 (2012), State v. Manewa, 115 Hawai i 343, 167 P.3d 
336 (2007), State v. Assaye , 121 Hawai i 204, 216 P.3d 1227   
(2009), and State v. Wallace , 80 Hawai i 382, 910 P.2d 695  
(1996), was not laid, as    
there [was]n’t  any competent evidence in the record as to 
the nature and extent of the training or as to the proper 
use and the manufacturer’s recommendations  [of the laser 
gun] . . . . All of [Officer Eguia’s] information and 
testimony as to the testing that he did as  to his training 
was based on hearsay information obtained strictly from the 
manual that he received and not from any  direct knowledge 
he has from L TI  itself. ”  
He further argued that there was no expert testimony regarding 
the margin of error of the laser gun, as required by  State v. 
Fitzwater, 122 Hawai i 354, 227 P.3d 520 (2010) .  The district 
court denied the motion, relying on State v. Stoa , 112 Hawai i  
260, 145 P.3d 803 (App. 2006), for the proposition that the LTI  
was “specifically . . . approve[d] . . . as a laser speed gun.”  
The district court acknowledged that Stoa  was overruled by 
Assaye, but that it was on other grounds. The district court 
then stated: “Admissibility in the test results then depend upon 
a foundation [that] assures the accuracy of the particular 
application[] [of the laser gun].  And in this phase of the 
proceedings, I’m going to find the [S]tate has met its burden  
5

  
 
 
  
       
 
 
  
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
under that [standard] .” Gardner then moved for a judg ment of 
acquittal based on the S tate’s failure to meet its burden beyond 
a reasonable doubt as to each and every element of the crime, 
which was largely based upon Gardner’s assertion that an 
improper foundation was laid for the admission of the laser gun speed reading with respect to Officer Eguia’s training. After 
the court denied the motion, Gardner was called to the stand. 
Gardner testified that he had turned on the cruise 
control function of his car prior to turning on to Mokulele 
Highway where Officer Eguia spotted him. His speedometer read 
that he was traveling at 45 miles per hour. To his knowledge, 
his car’s speedometer and cruise control function were working 
properly. There was a steady stream of traffic that day, both 
in front of and behind Gardner’s vehicle. Mokulele is a two -
lane highway in each direction. Gardner drove in the right 
lane, and vehicles passed him on the left. Gardner’s vehicle 
did not have a front license plate. In his closing argument, 
Gardner’s counsel argued, among other things, 
[N]otwithstanding the laser gun readout, there just isn’t 
evidence in the record to support specifically what speed 
Mr. Gardner was going . . . .  
[Gardner] was going 45 miles per hour based on the 
fact that his car was functioning properly on the day that he did set his cruise control at the legal speed limit as 
well as kept it at that speed. It’s not enough to show 
what his speed was, and we’re no t conceding that there is 
credible evidence in the record or that the record has been 
made to lay the foundation properly to get the laser gun 
reading in.

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
The district court ultimately adjudged Gardner guilty, 
and imposed a fine of $500 and a thirty-day suspension of his 
driver’s license. The district court also imposed a mandatory 
driver retraining course, and ordered that fines, fees, and 
assessments be paid within six months.         
C.  Appeal to the ICA 
Gardner timely filed a Notice of Appeal to the ICA.   
Gardner argued that the district court’s “Notice of Entry of 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment filed on July 19, 2013” 
be reversed because:  
The district court erred in denying Gardner’s motion to 
strike/suppress the reading of Off icer Eguia’s laser gun 
because the State failed to establish that (1) the laser 
gun was tested according to the manufacturer’s recommended 
procedures and found to be working properly, (2) the nature 
and extent of Officer Eguia’s training in the use of the 
laser gun met the requirements indicated by the 
manufacturer, (3) the laser gun had been inspected and 
serviced as required by the manufacturer, and (4) Officer 
Eguia was []  qualified to testify as to the speed reading  
of the laser gun.  
. . . .  
. . . Absent Officer Eguia’s testimony [regarding the 
speed reading of his laser gun], the State adduced no other evidence at trial sufficient to prove that Gardner drove at 
a speed exceeding the applicable speed limit by 30 miles 
per hour or more.  
 
The State agreed that “the district cour t erred in concluding 
that the State laid sufficient foundation for the speed reading 
given by the laser gun, and in denying Gardner’s Motion to 
Suppress the speed reading of 76 miles per hour.” Among other 
things, the State noted that “the record is silent”  as to (1) 
“what type of training is recommended by the manufacturer”  of 
7

  
 
 
  
 
  
   
    
   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
the laser gun, (2) what procedures the manufacturer required in 
determining a particular gun’s margin of error , and (3) whether 
Officer Eguia received training from an employee or authorized 
representative of the laser gun manufacturer. The State 
“respectfully request[ed] that [the ICA] reverse Gardner’s 
conviction and sentence entered in the district court’s Notice 
of Entry of Judgment and/or Order Plea/Judgment filed on July 
19, 2013.”   
In its June 30
, 2015 Summary Disposition Order upon 
reviewing the merits, the ICA held that “evidence [showing] 
Officer Eguia was trained and certified by the manufacturer’s 
representative as an instructor in the use of the laser gun, 
together with the evidence of the extent of his training” was 
sufficient to show that the Citing Officer’s training met the 
manufacturer’s require ments. Gardner, SDO at 5 (citing State v. 
Amiral, 132 Hawai i 170, 179, 319 P.3d 1178, 1187 (2014)); see 
also id. at 3–5 (quoting Officer Eguia’s trial testimony). The 
ICA further held that, pursuant to Gonzalez , 128 Hawai
i 314, 288 
P.3d 788, inspection or service   of the laser gun  by the  
manufacturer was not necessary  , and that the laser gun was  
working properly based on Officer Eguia’s testimony that (1) he 
read the manufacturer’s manual for the laser gun several times, 
(2) his training was based on and conducted in conformance with the manual, (3) the manual contained instructions for four 
8

  
 
 
     
  
      
 
    
 
 
 
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
accuracy tests, and (4) he conducted those four tests before and 
after using it to read Gardner’s speed. See id.  at 6. Based on 
the foregoing, the ICA concluded that the district court did not 
abuse its discretion in admitting the 
laser gun speed reading, 
and that therefore “the State adduced sufficient evidence to 
prove every element of Gardner’s offense beyond a reason able 
doubt.” Id. at 7 ( citing 
Assaye, 121 Hawai i at 216, 216 P.3d at 
1239). 
Accordingly, the ICA affirmed the “Notice of Entry of 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed on July 19, 
2013.” Id.  
III. Standard of Review 
“When a question arises regarding the necessary 
foundation for the introduction of evidence, ‘[t]he 
determination of whether proper foundation has been established 
lies within the discretion of the trial court[,] and its 
determination will not be overturned absent a showing of clear 
abuse.’” State v. Loa , 83 Hawai i 335, 348, 926 P.2d 1258, 1271 
(1996) (quoting State v. Joseph , 77 Hawai i 235, 239, 883 P.2d 
657, 661 (App. 1994)) (brackets in original). 
IV. Discussion 
To establish the requisite foundation for the 
admission of a speed reading from a laser gun, the prosecution 
9
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
must present evidence demonstrating two requirements: (1) the 
operator of the laser gun received training, the nature and 
extent of which meet  the laser gun manufacturer’ s requirements, 
and (2) that prior to making the at-issue reading, the laser gun was tested and determined to be operating properly according to 
the manufacturer’s established procedures.   
See Amiral , 132 
Hawaii at 178, 319 P.3d  at 1186 (quoting   Assaye,  121 Hawai i at  
215, 216 P.3d at 1238); Assaye, 121 Hawai i at 213, 216 P.3d at  
1236 (citing Manewa , 115 Hawai i at 354,    167 P.3d at 347).      
With respect to the first requirement   that the laser 
gun operator receive training that meets the laser gun manufacturer’s requirements , the ICA stated that the State  
“could . . . establish[] the type of training the 
manufacturer recommended ” by providing the court with 
evidence that course instructors were “actually certified 
by the manufacturer or had been trained by the 
manufacturer, ” “that the training course itself was 
approved by the manufacturer or was consistent with the manufacturer’s requirements, ” and that “the [operator] 
learn[ed] to perform the four tests ” set forth in the laser 
gun’s manual to verify its accuracy. 
Gardner, SDO at 3 (quoting dicta from Amiral , 132 Hawai i at 179, 
319 P.3d at 1187) (alterations in original).   The ICA noted that 
the Citing Officer received both training to operate the laser 
gun (“user training”), and training to instruct on the use of 
the laser gun (“instructor training”). Although the user 
training was conducted by a fellow police officer, Dennis Arns  
(who was certified as an instructor by Bob Long, a 
10

  
 
 
  
    
 
 
   
  
   
  
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
representative of the manufacturer), the instructor training was 
conducted by Mr. Long. Officer Eguia received instructor 
certification from Mr. Long that stated “LTI certification.” 
The ICA also noted the scope of Officer Eguia’s user training pursuant to his testimony.  See Gardner , SDO at 5. The ICA 
concluded that “the evidence presented, which included that Officer Eguia was trained and certified by the manufacturer’s 
representative as an instructor in the use of the [l]aser [g]un, 
together with the evidence of the extent of his training, was 
sufficient to show that Officer Eguia’s training met the 
requirements indicated by the manufacturer.” Id. at 5 (citation 
and internal quotation marks omitted). 
In sum, the evidence shows 
that Mr. Long was a 
representative of the laser gun manufacturer; both Officers Arns and Eguia received instructor training from Mr. Long; Officer 
Arns conducted Officer Eguia’s user training; and Officer Eguia 
learned how to conduct the manufacturer’s acc uracy tests through 
his training with Officer Arns. There is no evidence that the user training course taught by Officer Arns, which was completed 
by Officer Eguia, was “itself . . . approved by the manufacturer 
or was consistent with the manufacturer’s r equirements.” The 
ICA homed in on the fact, however, that the instructor training 
was conducted by Mr. Long, the laser gun manufacturer ’s 
representative. Thus, presumably, with respect to 
how to 
11

  
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
  
 
  
     
 
  
  
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
instruct on the use of the laser gun, the prosecution could 
establish that Officer Eguia was taught by the manufacturer 
through its representative, Mr. Long, and that Mr. Long’s 
instructor course was approved by the manufacturer. 
Lacking, however, is any evidence regarding the nature 
and extent of Officer Eguia’s instructor training from the 
manufacturer. Specifically, there is no evidence that Mr. Long 
taught Officer Eguia how to execute the manufacturer’s required 
tests to verify the accuracy of the laser gun. Additionally, 
Officer Eguia did not testify that he executed those tests 
pursuant to what he learned from Mr. Long. Without such a 
showing, the prosecution failed to demonstrate that the 
instructor training Officer Eguia received from Mr. Long 
satisfies the first requirement. 
It is possible that Officer Eguia may have had 
personal knowledge as to whether Officer Arn’ s user course 
(which Officer Eguia took to learn how to use the laser gun) 
complied with the manufacturer’s requirements for such a co urse 
(as Officer Eguia was taught by Mr. Long as to how to instruct such a user course). The record is bare of any testimony, 
however, that the user training Officer Eguia received from 
Officer Arns comported with the manufacturer’s requirements. 
As the requirement regarding the nature and extent of 
Officer Eguia’s training was not met, the State failed to lay a 
12
  
 
 
  
 
  
    
  
   
  
 
 
    
        
    
         
  
         
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
proper foundation for the admission of the laser gun reading. 
This requirement is well established in our case law. 
Accordingly, the ICA erred in determining that the district 
court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the laser gun 
reading. Reversal of the judgment, as requested by both Gardner 
and the State, is warranted. 
V. Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that 
the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal is reversed and the district 
court’s “Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and 
Plea/Judgment, filed on July 19, 2003” is reversed.
