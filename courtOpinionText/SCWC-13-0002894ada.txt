OPINION  OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.
  
I. Introduction 
The primary

the State, in seeking to sentence a defendant to a mandatory 
Also raised on certiorari were questions as to whether the ICA gravely 
erred when it (1) determined that a “highly prejudicial hearsay statement was 
admissible against” the petitioner at trial, and (2) when it “allow[ed] 
prosecutors to use the opening statement to argue that essential elements of 
the offense [would] be met[.]” With respect to ( 1), based on the ICA’s 
ruling that even if the statement was hearsay, Auld’s counsel did not object, 
and there may have been a reason for the lack of objection, we do not further address the issue at this time.  With respect to (2),seeing no error in the 
ICA’s disposition of the issue, we do not further address it. 1

 Recently, the United States Supreme Court extended the 
Apprendi rule to mandatory minimum sentencing.  See  Alleyne v. 
United States
, 133 S.Ct. 2151 (2013). Alleyne  held  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
jury, beyond a reasonable doubt. We answer both questions in 
the affirmative. 
This appeal surfaces in the wake of the sea change in state 
sentencing procedure brought on by the United States Supreme 
Court’s decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).  
In that case, the Court held, “ Other than the fact of a prior 
conviction, any fact that increases the 
penalty for a crime 
beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a 
jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” 530 U.S. at 489. 
We adopted this holding in State v. Maugaotega , 115 Hawai i 432, 
447, 168 P.3d 562, 577 (2007), with respect to our state’s 
extended sentencing procedures, 
which were subsequently codified 
at HRS §§ 706-661, -662, and -664 (2014).  
Any fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is 
an “element” that must be submitted to the jury and found 
beyond a reasonable doubt. See  [Apprendi , 523 U.S. at 483, 
n.10, 490] Mandatory minimum sentences  increase the 
penalty for a crime. It follows, then, that any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an “element” that must 
be submitted to the jury.  
 
133 S.Ct. at 2155. Our appellate case law currently holds that 
the Apprendi rule does not apply to mandatory minimum 
sentencing. See State v. Gonsalves , 108 Hawai i 289, 297, 119 
P.3d 597, 605 (2005) (“ Apprendi  does not apply to mandatory 
5

  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
minimums[.]”); State v. Loher , 118 Hawai i 522, 534 n.8, 193 P.3d 
438, 450 n.8 (App. 2008) (“Apprendi only applies to penalties 
that increase the maximum statutory incarceration period, not 
set a mandatory minimum like HRS § 706-606.5.”). This holding 
has now been implicitly called into question by Alleyne. 
We acknowledge that Alleyne did not involve mandatory 
minimum sentencing based on prior convictions, as Auld’s case 
does. We also acknowledge that the Apprendi rule contains an 
exception for the “fact of prior conviction” to its requirement 
that a jury find, beyond a reasonable doubt, those facts 
enhancing a defendant’s sentence. It was not until this case, 
however, that we have had the opportunity to directly address whether Apprendi’s “fact of prior conviction ” exception has a 
place within our repeat offender mandatory minimum sentencing scheme. We hold that it does not. 
This is because repeat offender sentencing under HRS 
§ 706-606.5 requires more than just a finding of the “fact” of 
prior conviction. In order to sentence a defendant as a repeat 
offender, the State must prove (1) that the defendant has a prior conviction (or convictions); (2) that a prior conviction 
is specifically enumerated under HRS § 706-606.5(1) or (4); (3) 
that a prior conviction occurred within the time frame set forth 
under HRS § 706-606.5(2), (3), or (4); and (4) that the 
defendant was represented by counsel, or had waived such 
6
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
                     
  
 
 Article I, section 10 of the Hawai i Constitution provides, in relevant 
part, the following:  
 3 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
representation, at the time of the prior conviction.  See  State 
v. Caldeira
, 61 Haw. 285, 290, 602 P.2d 930, 933 (1979) (per 
curiam);  State v. Afong,  61 Haw. 281, 282, 602 P.2d 927, 929 
(1979) (per curiam). Therefore, as a matter of state law, the 
Apprendi 
“fact of prior conviction” exception does not apply to 
prior convictions forming the basis of repeat offender 
sentencing pursuant to HRS § 706-606.5.  As a result, a 
defendant is entitled to have a jury find, beyond a reasonable 
doubt, those facts necessary to show that he or she is subject 
to repeat offender sentencing under HRS § 706-606.5.  
Further, our case law interpreting article I, sections 5 
and 10 of the Hawai i Constitution3 requires “a charging 
instrument, be it an indictment, complaint, or information,  
[to] include all ‘allegations, which if proved, would result in 
the application of a statute enhancing the penalty of the crime 
committed.’” State v. Jess , 117 Hawai i 381, 398, 184 P.3d 133, 
150 (2008) (citations omitted). Five years after we issued 
Article I, section 5 of the Hawai i Constitution provides, “No person 
shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, 
nor be denied the equal protection of the laws, nor be denied the enjoyment 
of the person’s civil rights or be discriminated against in the exercise 
thereof because of race, religion, sex or ances try.” 
No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or 
indictment of a grand jury or upon a finding of probable 
cause after a preliminary hearing held as provided by law or upon information in writing signed by a legal 
prosecuting officer under conditions and in accordance with 
procedures that the legislature may provide. . . .

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Jess, the United States Supreme Court in Alleyne clearly held 
that “[m]andatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for a 
crime.” 133 S.Ct. at 2155. In the wake of Alleyne, then, we 
are compelled to hold that repeat offender sentencing under HRS § 706-606.5 “enhanc[es] the penalty of the crime committed.” 
Consequently, under article I, sections 5 and 10 of the Hawai i 
Constitution, a defendant’s predicate prior conviction(s) must 
be alleged in the charging instrument. 
We are aware that our holdings today announce new rules for 
repeat offender charging and sentencing in Hawai i pursuant to 
HRS § 706-606.5.  Consequently, our new holdings take effect 
prospectively only. The ICA’s judgment on appeal, which 
affirmed the Circuit Court of the Secon d Circuit’s
4 (“circuit 
court”) judgment of conviction and sentence, is therefore 
affirmed. 
II. Trial Court Proceedings 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Jayson Auld was charged by 
indictment with committing Robbery in the Second Degree.  It is 
undisputed that Auld’s indictment did not allege that he had any 
prior convictions. A jury found Auld guilty as charged.  That 
jury was not asked to find, and did not find, beyond a 
reasonable doubt, that Auld had any prior convictions. After 
The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Auld was convicted, the State filed its Motion for Imposition of 
Mandatory Minimum Period of Imprisonment. The State requested 
that Auld be sentenced, as a repeat offender, to a mandatory 
minimum period of imprisonment of “SIX (6) YEARS, and, EIGHT (8) 
MONTHS without the possi bility of parole,” pursuant to HRS 
§ 706-606.5(1)(b)(iii).  The State averred that Auld had been convicted in 2011 of one count of Unauthorized Control of a 
Propelled Vehicle and one count of Promoting a Dangerous Drug in 
the Third Degree. The State attached as an exhibit to its 
motion a copy of Auld’s judgment of conviction and probation 
sentence reflecting both prior convictions. 
Auld’s Opposition to the State’s motion did not argue that 
his prior convictions were required to be found by a jury beyond 
a reasonable doubt (or charged in the indictment); instead, he 
argued that strong mitigating circumstances warranted a lesser 
mandatory minimum period of imprisonment. 
At the sentencing hearing, the State ca lled Auld’s 
probation officer. The State introduced into evidence the “self-authenticating sealed and certified judgment for Jayson 
Auld” for his prior convictions. Auld’s counsel did not object, 
and the circuit court received the document into evidence.  
Auld’s probation officer testified as to what the underlying 
offenses were, and Auld’s coun sel did not cross-examine him.  
The circuit court also took judicial notice of the records on 
9
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
   
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
file for both of Auld’s prior cases, and asked the State and 
Auld if they objected; neither did.  The circuit court also 
noted that it was the court that presided over those prior 
cases.  
The circuit court granted the State’s Motion for Imposition 
of Mandatory Minimum Period of Imprisonment, sentencing Auld to 
ten years of incarceration, with credit for time served, subject 
to the mandatory minimum of six years and eight months as a 
repeat offender. Auld timely appealed. 
III. ICA Appeal 
A. Opening Brief 
Relevant to the issues presented on certiorari, Auld argued 
for the first time on appeal that the circuit court “violated 
[his] Sixth Amendment and Due Process Rights when it granted the 
prosecution’s post-verdict motion for the mandatory minimum term 
of imprisonment.” Auld cited Alleyne as authority for his 
argument that a jury should have considered the facts alleged in 
the prosecution’s motion for imposition of a mandatory minimum 
sentence; he cited Jess as authority for his argument that those 
facts should have also been alleged in the indictment. He asked 
the ICA to remand his case for resentencing consistent with the 
jury’s verdict, i.e., without the mandatory minimum s entence. 
10
  
 
   
 
   
  
  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B.  Answering Brief 
The State distinguished Alleyne, factually and legally, 
from the instant case. The State correctly pointed out that 
Alleyne involved 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), which requires a 
mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment of five years for a 
person who “uses or carries” a firearm in relation to a crime of 
violence, seven years if the firearm is “brandished,” and ten 
years if the firearm is “discharged.” 133 S.Ct. at 2155 -56. 
Although the jury found that Alleyne had “used or carried,” but 
not “brandished” a firearm, the district court found that 
Alleyne brandished a firearm and sentenced him to a mandatory 
minimum of seven years imprisonment. 133 S.Ct. at 2156. The 
United States Supreme Court held that the district court’s 
judicial fact-finding of “brandishing” violated Alleyne’s Sixth 
Amendment right to have a jury find, beyond a reasonable doubt, 
those facts aggravating the punishment for a crime.  133 S.Ct. 
at 2161-62. The State also noted that the Alleyne court stated 
that its holding “d[id] not mean that any fact that influences 
judicial discretion must be found by a jury.” 133 S.Ct. at 
2163. In the instant appeal, the State appeared to argue that 
Auld’s prior convictions did not need to be found by a jury 
beyond a reasonable doubt in order for the circuit court to have 
sentenced him to a mandatory minimum sentence as a repeat 
offender.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Citing State v. Drozdowski, 9 Haw. App. 583, 585, 854 P.2d 
238, 240 (1993), the State also argued that “ordinary sentencing 
procedures apply to the mandatory minimum sentencing hearing.” 
Under State v. Mara , 102 Hawai i 346, 368, 76 P.3d 589, 611 (App. 
2003), the State argued, such “ordinary sentencing procedures” 
include the “abuse of discretion” standard as the standard for 
appellate review of the trial court’s imposition of a mandatory 
minimum sentence. 
C.  Reply Brief 
Auld contended that the State appeared to be “relying on 
the so-called prior-convictions exception to Apprendi,”5 which he 
argued “no longer holds sway in light of Alleyne and our own 
supreme court’s precedent.” Auld traced the prior conviction 
exception to Almendarez-Torres v. United States , 523 U.S. 224 
(1998), which he claimed “underwent great scrutiny in Apprendi ,” 
with the United States Supreme Court noting that the case was 
“arguabl[y] . . . incorrectly decided.” 530 U.S. at 489. He 
then ci
ted Justice Thomas’s concurrence in DesCamps v. United 
States
, 133 S.Ct. 2276 (2013), as evidence that the prior 
conviction exception is inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment. 
Justice Thomas stated, “Under the logic of Apprendi, a court may 
The Apprendi holding sets forth the prior conviction exception as 
follows: “ Other than the fact of a prior conviction,  any fact that increases 
the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be 
submitted to a jury, 
and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” 530 U.S. at 489 
(emphasis added).

 The ICA affirmed Auld’s judgment of conviction and sentence 
in a summary disposition order  (SDO).  State v. Auld, CAAP-13-
0002894 (App. Jan, 27, 2015) (SDO) at 2. 
The ICA found “without 
merit” Auld’s sentencing arguments, relying on the prior 
conviction exception. Auld, SDO at 3-4.  The ICA noted that the 
prior conviction exception remained undisturbed in Alleyne  and 
was “expressly recognized” by this court in Maugaotega, 115 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
not find facts about a prior conviction when such findings 
increase the statutory maximum. This is so whether a court is 
determining a prior conviction was entered, or attempting to 
discern what facts were necessary to a prior conviction.” 133 
S.Ct. at 2294 (Thomas, J., concurring).    
Auld also asserted that this court has “ never carved out an 
exception for facts relating to prior convictions” in requiring 
that “a charging instrument, be it an indictment, complaint, or 
information, . . . include all allegations, which if proved, 
would result in the application of a statute enhancing the 
penalty of the crime committed.” Jess, 117 Hawai
i at 398, 184 
P.3d at 150 (citations and quotation marks omitted). In other 
words, Auld argued that a defendant’s prior conviction s must be 
alleged in a charging instrument in order for him to be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment as a 
repeat offender.

States Supreme Court has always exempted prior convictions from

requirement of proof beyond a re asonable doubt.”). Id.

prior convictions be alleged in the indictment, the ICA noted 
that this court in Jess
, 117 Hawai i at 397-98, 184 P.3d at 149 -
50, “cited favorably to the federal standard that prior 
convictions are an exception to the mandate to include sentence 
enhancements in the charging instrument.” Auld
, SDO at 4. The 
ICA also concluded that State v. Freitas,  61 Haw. 262, 277, 602 
P.2d 914, 925 (1979), requires only that a defendant sentenced under HRS § 706-606.5 be given “reasonable notice and afforded 
the opportunity to be heard,” and that due process “does not 
require that notice be given prior to the trial of the 
underlying offense. . . .” 
Auld
, SDO at 4. In the instant 
case, the ICA reasoned that Auld had an opportunity to oppose 
the State’s motion for imposition of a mandatory minimum 
sentence, was represented by counsel at the hearing on that 
motion, and did not object to the circuit court’s receiving his 
sealed and certified judgment of conviction into evidence and taking judicial notice of the record in both prior convictions.

were not violated. Id. 
IV.  Standard of Review 
This court reviews questions of constitutional law under 
the right/wrong standard of review. See  State v. Toyomura , 80 
Hawai
i 8, 15, 904 P.2d 893, 900 (1995). 
V. Discussion 
On certiorari, Auld raises the following question: 
Did the Intermediate Court of Appeals gravely err in 
concluding that an exception to Apprendi v. New Jersey  
allows sentencing courts to impose mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment based on facts that were never established 
with proof beyond a reasonable doubt, found by a jury, and adequately pleaded in the indictment? 
[App. at PDF p. 2] On certiorari, Auld criticizes the ICA’s 
reliance on Apprendi ’s prior conviction exception. Auld again 
traces the prior conviction exception to  Almendarez-Torres 523 
U.S.
 224, and argues that the exception has “fallen out of favor 
in federal courts and its continued viability there is 
uncertain.” To demonstrate the decline of the Almendarez-Torres  
holding, Auld first points to the dissent in that case, which 
stated that “there is no rational basis for making recidivism an exc
eption” to the requirement that sentencing facts be proven to 
a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. 523 U.S. at 258 (Scalia, J., dissenting). He again points to the Apprendi 
opinion itself, 
which declined to revisit the Almendarez-Torres  prior conviction 
exception, but nevertheless noted, “[I]t is arguable that 
15

  
 
  
 
 
 
     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Almendarez-Torres  was incorrectly decided, and that a logical 
application of our reasoning today should apply if the 
recidivist issue were contested, [but] Apprendi does not contest 
the decision’s vali
dity and we need not revisit it[.]”  530 U.S. 
at 489. Auld again cites to Justice Thomas’s concurrence in 
DesCamps
, 133 S.Ct. 2276 (Thomas, J., concurring), as well as 
Shepard v. United States,  544 U.S. 13, 27-28 (Thomas, J., 
concurring) (“Almendarez-Torres . . . has been eroded by the 
Court’s subsequent Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, and a majority 
of the Court now recognizes that  Almendarez-Torres  was wrongly 
decided. . . . Innumerable criminal defendants have been unconstitutionally sentenced under the flawed rule of 
Almendarez-Torres[.]”) (citation omitted); and United States v. 
Torres-Alvarado, 416 F.3d 808, 810 (8th Cir. 2005) (“[I]t is 
unclear whether Almendarez-Torres  and its felony exception will 
remain good law[.]”) (citation omitted). 
Auld argues that this court should grant greater  
protections to criminal defendants under Article I, Section 14 
of the Hawai i Constitution, which provides, in relevant part, 
“In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right 
to a speedy and public  trial by an impartial jury . . . [and] be 
informed of the nature and cause of the accusation. . . .”   He 
contends that a prior conviction “must be treated like any other 
fact –- the prosecution must establish it beyond a reasonable 
16

  
 
  
   
 
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
doubt before a jury and include it in the indictment before a 
sentencing court can use it to impose a mandatory minimum term 
of imprisonment.” Auld cites Jess, 117 Hawai i 381, 184 P.3d 
133, for the proposition that prior convictions must be pleaded 
in the indictment before they can form the basis of a mandatory 
minimum sentence. He cites Alleyne and the Hawai i Constitution 
for the proposition that a predicate prior conviction is a fact 
that must be submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable 
doubt. 
Auld’s arguments are persuasive, primarily because of the 
change to our case law that Alleyne now compels. To provide the 
backdrop for the new rules we announce today, we take a closer look at that case. In Alleyne, the sentencing statute at issue 
was 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), which states the following: 
Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is 
otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law, 
any person who, during and in relation to 
any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime  
(including 
a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides 
for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a 
deadly or dangerous weapon or device) for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or 
carries a firearm, 
or who, in furtherance of any such 
crime, possesses a firearm, shall
, in addition to the 
punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime--(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 
5 years; 
(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a term 
of imprisonment of not less than 7 years
; and  
(iii
) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a term 
of imprisonment of not less than 10 years. 
(Emphases added).  The jury who convicted Alleyne found only 
that he “used or carried” a firearm, and did not find that he 
17
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“brandished” a firearm, beyond a reasonable doubt; therefore, 
based on these jury-found facts, Alleyne was subject to only the 
five-year mandatory minimum term.  133 S.Ct. at 2156. The 
district court judge, on the other hand, found that Alleyne 
brandished the firearm by a preponderance of the evidence and 
sentenced him to the seven-year mandatory minimum term.  Id.   In 
holding that the district court violated Alleyne’s Sixth 
Amendment right, the United States Supreme Court extended the 
Apprendi rule to mandatory minimum term sentencing as follows:   
Any fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is 
an “element” that must be submitted to the jury and found 
beyond a reasonable doubt. See [Apprendi , 530 U.S. at 483, 
n.10, 490] Mandatory minimum sentences increase the 
penalty for a crime. It follows, then, that any fact that 
increases the mandatory minimum is an “element” that must 
be submitted to the jury. 
133 S.Ct. at 2155. In other words, “ Apprendi ’s definition of 
‘elements’ necessarily includes not only facts that increase the 
ceiling [i.e., the statutory maximum sentence a defendant can 
receive], but also those that increase the floor [i.e., the mandatory minimum sentence a defendant can receive].” 133 S.Ct. 
at 2158. 
Alleyne
’s holding extending the Apprendi rule to mandatory 
minimum sentences calls into question two of our appellate 
decisions, Loher, 118 Hawai i 522, 193 P.3d 438, and Gonsalves , 
108 Hawai
i 289, 119 P.3d 597. In Loher, the ICA observed in a 
18

  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
118 Hawai i at 534 n.8, 193 P.3d at 450 n.8 (citations omitted).  
This observation is consistent with this court’s earlier holding 
in Gonsalves , 108 Hawai i at 297, 119 P.3d at 605, that “ Apprendi  
does not apply to mandatory minimums[.]” The Gonsalves court  
drew upon Harris v. United States , 536 U.S. 545 (2002), for its 
holding, which it summarized as follows:  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
footnote that a Rule 40 petitioner’s repeat offender mandatory 
minimum sentence did not violate the rule in Apprendi: 
Loher was also sentenced to a mandatory minimum of thirteen 
years and four months, pursuant to HRS § 706-606.5, as a 
repeat offender. Apprendi and its progeny are not 
applicable to HRS § 706-606.5 because only facts other than 
a finding of prior convictions must be found by a jury. 
Only a finding of prior convictions is required to apply 
HRS § 706-606.5.  In addition, Apprendi only applies to 
penalties that increase the maximum statutory incarceration 
period, not set a mandatory minimum like HRS § 706-606.5.  
Gonsalves’s argument that somehow the jury’s verdict did 
not authorize sentencing him to a mandatory minimum term as 
a repeat offender is unfounded. Apprendi  pronounced a rule 
regarding the judge -imposed penalties that increase 
statutory maximum sentences, not mandatory minimum 
sentences, because the judicial factfinding “that gives 
rise to a mandatory minimum sentence . . . does not expose a defendant to a punishment greater than otherwise legally 
prescribed.”  
Gonsalves, 108 Hawai i at 296, 119 P.3d at 604 (citing Harris, 
536 U.S. at 565). Harris, however, was overruled by Alleyne. 
Alleyne, 133 S.Ct. at 2155. In fact, the United States Supreme 
Court specifically accepted certiorari in Alleyne to consider 
overruling Harris.  Id.  In overruling Harris, the United States 
Supreme Court explained, “ Harris  drew a distinction between 
facts that increase the statutory maximum and facts that 
19

  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  Maugaotega,
  
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
increase only the mandatory minimum.  We conclude that this 
distinction is inconsistent with our decision in Apprendi . . . 
and with the original meaning of the Sixth Amendment.” Id.  
Thus, this court’s statement in Gonsalves , as well as the ICA’s 
footnote in 
Loher, that Apprendi does not apply in mandatory 
minimum term sentencing is no longer true. 
Our analysis does not end here, however, as repeat offender 
sentencing under HRS § 706-606.5 is based solely on a 
defendant’s prior conviction(s), and the Apprendi rule excepts 
the “fact of prior conviction” from the requirement that a jury find, beyond a reasonable doubt, those facts increasing the 
penalty for a crime. Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 489. We have 
favorably cited to Apprendi’s general rule and its prior 
conviction exception in the context of extended term sentencing 
under HRS §§ 706-661, -662, and -664.  See  115 Haw. 
at 446 n.15, 168 P.3d at 576 n.15 (citations omitted): 
The United States Supreme Court has always exempted prior 
convictions from the Apprendi 
rule: “[T]he Federal 
Constitution’ s jury-trial guarantee proscribes a sentencing 
scheme that allows a judge to impose a sentence above the 
statutory maximum based upon a fact,  other than a prior 
conviction, not found by a jury or admitted by the 
defendant.” 
The Court bases the exception on the fact that 
prior convictions have themselves been subject to the sixth 
amendment right to a jury trial and the accompanying 
requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt . 
(Emphasis in original; citations omitted). See also Jess  , 117 
Hawaii at 394, 184 P.3d at 146 (“[E]xcept for prior convictions, 
multiple convictions, and admissions, ‘any fact , however

labeled, that serves as a basis for an extended term sentence 
must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt to the trier of 
fact.’”) (citing Maugaotega , 115 Hawai i at 447 & n.15, 184 P.3d 
at 577 & n.15) (emphasis in original)
; State v. Keohokapu,  127 
Hawaii 91, 108, 276 P.3d 660, 677 (2012) (citing Maugaotega , 115 
Hawai
i at 442, 168 P.3d at 572; and Jess , 117 Hawai i at 394, 184 
P.3d at 146). 
It was not until this case, however, that we scrutinized 
Apprendi
’s “fact of prior conviction” exception. This may be 
because Maugaotega , Jess
, and Keohokapu  all involved extended 
term sentencing under HRS §§ 706-661, -662, and -664.  Under HRS 
§ 706-662, a defendant convicted of a felony may be subject to 
an extended term of imprisonment if a jury finds, beyond a 
reasonable doubt, the primary fact that an extended term of 
imprisonment is “necessary for the protection of the public” and 
that the convicted defendant satisfies one or more of the following criteria, most of which involve factual findings other 
than prior convictions:  
(1) The defendant is a persistent offender in that the 
defendant has previously been convicted of two or more felonies committed at different times when the defendant 
was eighteen years of age or older; 
(2) The defendant is a professional criminal in that: 
(a) The circumstances of the crime show that the defendant has knowingly engaged in criminal activity as a major source of livelihood; or 
(b) The defendant has substantial income or resources 
not explained to be derived from a source other than 
criminal activity; 
(3) The defendant is a dangerous person in that the 
defendant has been subjected to a psychiatric or

psychological evaluation that documents a significant 
history of dangerousness to others resulting in criminally 
violent conduct, and this history makes the defendant a 
serious danger to others. Nothing in this section precludes 
the introduction of victim -related data to establish 
dangerousness in accord with the Hawaii rules of evidence; 
(4) The defendant is a multiple offender in that: 
(a) The defendant is being sentenced for two or more felonies or is already under sentence of imprisonment 
for any felony; or 
(b) The maximum terms of imprisonment authorized for each of the defendant's crimes, if made to run 
consecutively, would equal or exceed in length the 
maximum of the extended term imposed or would equal 
or exceed forty years if the extended term imposed is 
for a class A felony; 
(5) The defendant is an offender against the elderly, 
handicapped, or a minor eight years of age or younger in 
that: 
(a) The defendant attempts or commits any of the following crimes: murder, manslaughter, a sexual offense that constitutes a felony under chapter 707, 
robbery, felonious assault, burglary, or kidnapping; 
and 
(b) The defendant, in the course of committing or 
attempting to commit the crime, inflicts serious or substantial bodily injury upon a person who has the 
status of being: 
(i) Sixty years of age or older; 
(ii) Blind, a paraplegic, or a quadriplegic; or 
(iii) Eight years of age or younger; and the person's status is known or reasonably should be 
known to the defendant; or 
(6) The defendant is a hate crime offender in that: 
(a) The defendant is convicted of a crime under 
chapter 707, 708, or 711; and (b) The defendant intentionally selected a victim or, 
in the case of a property crime, the property that 
was the object of a crime, because of hostility 
toward the actual or perceived race, religion, 
disability, ethnicity, national origin, gender identity or expression, or sexual orientation of any 
person. For purposes of this subsection, "gender 
identity or expression" includes a person's actual or 
perceived gender, as well as a person's gender 
identity, gender- related self -image, gender- related 
appearance, or gender -related expression, regardless 
of whether that gender identity, gender -related self -
image, gender -related appearance, or gender -related 
expression is different from that traditionally associated with the person's sex at birth. 
Amidst this comprehensive list of other facts to be found by a 
jury, perhaps adopting the “fact of prior conviction” exception 
22

  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
in the extended term context was just a natural consequence of 
adopting Apprendi’s ge neral rule. See Maugaotega, 115 Hawai i at 
446 n.15, 168 P.3d at 576 n.15 (positing that the prior 
conviction exception would apply to multiple concurrent 
convictions under HRS § 706-662(4), while acknowledging that 
“the [Hawai i Supreme] Court has never directly addressed the 
issue” of the application of Apprendi’s prior conviction 
exception.) 
Because a mandatory minimum sentence as a repeat offender 
under HRS § 706-606.5 is warranted solely on the basis of prior 
convictions, however, whether the Apprendi “fact of prior 
conviction” exception truly fits within our state’s statutory sentencing scheme comes into sharper focus in this appeal. We 
hold that repeat offender sentencing under HRS § 706-606.5 
involves more than a simple finding of the “fact” of pri or 
conviction, thereby removing it from Apprendi ’s “fact of prior 
conviction” exception. First, it must be proven that a prior 
conviction belongs to the defendant. Second, the prior 
conviction must be enumerated under HRS § 706-606.5(1) or (4).  
Third, the prior conviction must have occurred within the time 
frame set forth under HRS §§ 706-606.5(2), (3), or (4).  Lastly, 
Hawaii case law requires proof that a defendant subject to 
mandatory minimum sentencing as a repeat offender was 
23

represented by counsel, or had waived such representation, at 
the time of the prior conviction.  See  Caldeira, 61 Haw. at 290, 
602 P.2d at 933; 
Afong, 61 Haw. at 282, 602 P.2d at 929. 
Therefore, as a matter of state law, the Apprendi “fact of prior 
conviction” exception does not apply to prior convictions 
forming the basis of repeat offender sentencing pursuant to HRS 
§ 706-606.5.6 
Loher and Gonsalves  are hereby overruled to the extent each 
held that the 
Apprendi rule applies only to extended term 
sentencing under HRS §§ 706-661, -662, and -664, and not to 
repeat offender mandatory minimum term sentencing under HRS 
§ 706-606.5.  Loher , 118 Hawai i at 534 n.8, 193 P.3d at 450 n.8 
(citations omitted); Gonsalves, 108 Hawai i at 297, 119 P.3d at 
605. Loher is further overruled to the extent it held that 
Apprendi
’s prior conviction exception would obviate any need for 
a defendant’s predicate prior convictions to be found by a jury.   
Loher
, 118 Hawai i at 534 n.8, 193 P.3d at 450 n.8 (citations 
omitted). As a result, a defendant is entitled to have a jury 
find beyond a reasonable doubt that his or her prior convictions 
Consequently, although we agree with Auld (and with amicus curiae the 
Office of the Public Defender) that the United States Supreme Court will 
eventually overturn  Almendarez -Torres  and sweep away the prior conviction 
exception, we reach our holding today based on “adequate and independent 
state grounds.” See Michigan v. Long , 463 U.S. 1032, 1041 -42 (1983).  
24

(Emphasis added). With regard to repeat offender sentencing 
under HRS § 706-606.5, proof of prior conviction  must be found 
by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, not by the court under a “reasonabl[e] satisf[action]” standard.  
 On the issue of whether the prosecution must allege in  the 
charging instrument  that the defendant has prior convictions for *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
trigger the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence as a 
repeat offender under HRS § 706-606.5.  
With these protections in place, repeat offender sentencing 
under HRS § 706-606.5, like extended term sentencing under HRS 
§§ 706-661, -662 and -664, cannot be considered an “ordinary 
sentencing” situation. Consequently, to the extent it held 
otherwise, Drozdowski , 9 Haw. App. at 585, 854 P.2d at 240, is 
hereby overruled. 
Further, whether a defendant was sentenced as 
a repeat offender consistent with the protections afforded him 
under the Hawai i Constitution shall be reviewed under the 
right/wrong standard. Lastly, we note that our holding affects 
HRS § 706-
666 (2014), titled, “Definition of proof of 
conviction.” That statute provides 
(1) An adjudication by a court of competent 
jurisdiction that the defendant committed a crime 
constitutes a conviction for purposes of sections 706 -
606.5, 706- 662, and 706- 665, although sentence or the 
execution thereof was suspended, provided that the defendant was not pardoned on the ground of innocence. 
(2)
 Prior conviction may be proved by any evidence, 
including fingerprints records made in connection with arrest, conviction, or imprisonment, 
that reasonably 
satisfies the court that the defendant was convicted. 
25

  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
purposes of repeat offender sentencing, our case law 
interpreting article I, sections 5 and 10 of the Hawai i  
Constitution requires “a charging instrument, be it an 
indictment, complaint, or information, [to] include all 
‘allegations, which if proved, would result in the application 
of a statute enhancing the penalty of the crime committed.’” 
Jess, 117 Hawai i at 398, 184 P.3d at 150 (citations omitted).  
Alleyne clearly held that “[m]andatory minimum sentences 
increase the penalty for a crime.” 133 S.Ct. at 2155. In the 
wake of Alleyne, then, we are compelled to hold that repeat 
offender sentencing under HRS §  706-606.5 “enhanc[es] the 
penalty of the crime committed.” Therefore, under article I, 
sections 5 and 10 of the Hawai i Constitution, the predicate  
prior conviction(s) must be alleged in the charging instrument 
in order for the defendant  to ultimately be  sentenced as a 
repeat offender. 
Our case law on HRS § 706
-606.5 has consistently emphasized 
that due process requires the State to give a defendant 
reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard on the issue of 
mandatory minimum sentencing as a repeat 
offender.  State v. 
Schroeder
, 76 Hawai i 517, 880 P.2d 192 (1994) (citing Freitas, 
61 Haw. at 277, 602 P.2d at 915; State v. Caldeira, 61 Haw. 285, 
289, 602 P.2d 930, 933 (1979); and State v. Melear , 63 Haw. 488, 
26

  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
499, 630 P.2d 619, 627-28 (1981)).  Freitas, however, held 
“While due process does not require that notice be given prior 
to the trial of the underlying offense, it does require that a 
defendant to be sentenced under Act 181 [codifying the repeat 
offender statute] be given reasonable notice and afforded the 
opportunity to be heard.” 61 Haw. at 277, 602 P.2d at 925) 
(citations omitted). See also   Caldeira , 61 Haw. at 289-90, 602 
P.2d at 933 (following Freitas  and holding the notice 
requirements were satisfied when each defendant was apprised of the  State’s intent to seek repeat offender sentencing days  
before the sentencing hearing); Melear, 63 Haw. at 499, 630 P.2d 
at 628 (following Freitas  and holding that the notice 
requirement was satisfied when defendant received the State’s 
motion for repeat offender sentencing a month and a half before 
the first sentencing hearing); Schroeder , 76 Hawai i at 531, 880 
P.2d at 206 (following Freitas  and noting that the defendant  
received notice before sentencing of only the State’s intent to 
seek a single mandatory minimum term).  Under Jess, as clarified 
by Alleyne, we now hold that the State provides “reasonable 
notice” to a defendant it seeks to sentence as a repeat offender 
when it alleges the defendant’s predicate prior convictions in a 
charging instrument. To the extent the aforementioned cases 
hold that due process requires only that notice be given prior 
to sentencing, they are hereby overruled.

We are cognizant of the fact that we announce new rules  in 
this case. As such, we consider whether these new rules will be 
given 
(1) purely prospective effect, which means that the rule is 
applied neither to the parties in the law -making decision 
nor to those others against or by whom it might be applied 
to conduct or events occurring before that decision; (2) 
limited or “pipeline” retroactive effect, under which the 
rule applies to the parties in the decision and all cases 
that are on direct review or not yet final as of the date of the decision; or (3) full  retroactive effect, under 
which the rule applies both to the parties before the court 
and to all others by and against whom claims may be 
pressed.  
 
Jess, 117 Hawai i at 401, 184 P.3d at 153 (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted). The “paradigm case” warranting a 
prospective-only application of a new rule arises “when a court 
expressly overrules a precedent upon which the contest would otherwise be decided differently and by which the parties may 
previously have regulated their conduct.” 117 Haw aii at 400,

In this case, Alleyne has compelled changes to our 
appellate precedent regarding whether the Apprendi rule applies 
to repeat offender mandatory mini
mum charging and sentencing 
under HRS § 706-606.5.  Absent Alleyne , Auld’s sentence would 
have been affirmed under Loher, 118 Hawai i 522, 193 P.3d 438, 
and Gonsalves, 108 Hawai i 289, 119 P.3d 597, as the Apprendi 
rule had no application to repeat offender mandatory minimum

sentencing under HRS § 706-606.5, and, even if it did, the prior 
conviction exception would have applied. In other words, we 
expressly overrule precedent upon which the “contest would 
otherwise be decided differently,” which counsels i n favor of a 
prospective-only application.  Jess, 117 Hawai i at 400, 184 P.3d 
at 152 (citation omitted). 
In the wake of Alleyne, Loher 
and Gonsalves  are now 
overruled to the extent each held that the Apprendi 
rule did not 
apply to mandatory minimum sentencing of repeat offenders under 
HRS § 706-606.5.  As the first consequence of that overruling, 
we have had occasion to further scrutinize whether Apprendi ’s 
“fact of prior conviction” exception applies to mandatory 
minimum sentencing of repeat offenders under HRS § 706-606.5, 
and we hold that, as a matter of state law, it does not. The 
second consequence of overruling Loher and Gonsalves  by 
extending the 
Apprendi rule to repeat offender sentencing is 
that we also hold that Jess
’s rule requiring a charging 
instrument to include “all ‘allegations, which if proved, would result in the application of a statute enhancing the penalty of the crime committed,’” now requires the State to allege the 
prior convictions it seeks to use as a basis for
defendant  as a repeat offender, because “[m]andatory minimum 
sentences increase the penalty for a crime.” Jess
, 117 Hawai i 
at 398, 184 P.3d at 150;  Alleyne,  133 S.Ct. at 2155.  In so 
29

  
 
  
  
  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
doing, we overrule Freitas (and those cases drawing on Freitas ’s 
holding), which concluded that due process in repeat offender 
sentencing “does not require that notice be given prior to the 
trial of the underlying offense[.]” Thus, prior to this case, 
the “parties may previously have regulated their conduct” consistently with the rules set forth in Freitas, Loher 
and 
Gonsalves that did not require a charging instrument to allege 
predicate prior convictions, or a jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a defendant’s prior convictions subject 
him or her to a mandatory minimum sentence as a repeat offender under HRS § 706-606.5.  This further counsels in favor of a 
prospective-only application.  Jess
, 117 Hawai i at 400, 184 P.3d 
at 152 (citation omitted). 
As to how repeat offender sentencing procedures would look 
in the future, this court has suggested that information 
pertaining to sentencing may be introduced after the guilt phase  
of the trial has concluded. See Maugaotega , 117 Hawai i at 412, 
184 P.3d at 164 (citing State v. Janto , 92 Hawai i 19, 34- 35, 986 
P.2d 306, 321-22 (1999).  This is apparently the procedure 
described in Keohokapu , where the jury heard testimony 
concerning the offenses leading to defendant’s prior convictions 
during the extended term sentencing phase of the trial. 127 
Hawaii at 96-101, 276 P.3d at 665-70.  As with other 
30

  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
constitutional rights, the defendant would also have the option 
of waiving a jury trial for repeat offender sentencing fact-
finding, similar to the waiver option for extended term 
sentencing fact-finding.  See HRS § 706-664(1) (“[T]he defendant 
shall have the right to hear and controvert the evidence against 
the defendant and to offer evidence upon the issue [of extended 
term sentencing] before a jury; provided that the defendant may 
waive the right to a jury determination under this subsection, 
in which case the determination shall be made by a court.”). We 
do not foresee future changes to repeat offender sentencing 
procedures to be markedly different from extended term 
sentencing procedures. 
VI.  Conclusion 
We hold that, under article I, sections 5 and 10 of the 
Hawaii Constitution, the State must allege the predicate prior 
conviction(s) in a charging instrument in order to sentence the 
defendant to a mandatory minimum sentence as a repeat offender 
under HRS § 706-606.5.  We further hold that, as a matter of 
state law, Apprendi ’s “fact of prior conviction” exception does 
not apply to repeat offender sentencing under HRS § 706-606.5, 
and that a jury is required to find that the defendant’s prior 
conviction(s) have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt to 
trigger the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence under 
that statute. As these new rules result from the express

overruling of prior appellate precedent holding that the 
Apprendi rule did not apply to mandatory minimum sentencing and 
that notice of repeat offender sentencing did not need to be 
given in a charging instrument, they are given prospective 
effect only. 
Therefore, the ICA’s judgment on appeal, which 
affirmed the circuit court’s judgment of conviction and 
sentence, is affirmed.
