STATE OF HAWAI ʻI,  Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellee,
  
  
vs.
  
 
VICENTE KOTEKAPIKA HILARIO, Respondent/Defendant-Appellant.
  
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS  
(CAAP
-13-0003039; CR. NO. 11-1-0023) 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ. )
 
I. Introduction 
On January 19, 2011, Vicente Kotekapika Hilario  
(“Defendant” or “Hilario”)  was charged with five counts related 
to the December 17, 2010 shooting death of Aureo Moore  
(“Moore”): Murder in the First Degree in violation of Hawai ʻi 
Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 707 -701(1)(c)  (2014) (Count 1),  
Murder in the Second Degree in violation of HRS § 707-701.5   
 
 
 
   
    
 
   
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
                         
  
 
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
(2014) (Count 2), Retaliating Against a Witness in violation of 
HRS § 710-1072.2 (2014) (Count 3), Intimidating a Witness in 
violation of HRS “Section 710-1071(1)(a/b/c) [sic]” (2014) 
(Count 4), and Bribery of a Witness in violation of HRS “Section 
710-1070(1)(a/b/c) [sic]” (2014) (Count 5).  After a jury found 
Hilario guilty of all counts except Count 2,1 a “Judgment Guilty 
Conviction and Sentence” (“Judgment”) was entered by the Circuit 
Court of the Fifth Circuit (“circuit court” or “trial court”) on 
July 25, 2013. Hilario was sentenced to life imprisonment.2 
Hilario timely appealed the Judgment to the ICA, arguing, 
among other things, that the circuit court erred when it denied 
his Motion to Dismiss based on Hawai ʻi Rules of Penal Procedure 
(“HRPP”) Rule 48 (“Rule 48”)  (2000).  The rule states, in part:  
Except in the case of traffic offenses that are not 
punishable by imprisonment, the court shall, on motion of 
the defendant, dismiss the charge, with or without prejudice in its discretion, if trial is not commenced 
within 6 months [i.e., 180 days] . . . from the date of 
arrest if bail is set or from the filing of the charge, 
whichever is sooner, on any offense based on the same 
conduct or arising from the same criminal episode for which the arrest or charge was made[.] 
HRPP Rule 48(b)(1); see State v. Jackson , 81 Hawaiʻ i 39, 50, 912 
P.2d 71, 82 (1996) (construing 6 months as 180 days) (citing 
State v. Hoey, 77 Hawai ʻi 17, 28, 881 P.2d 504, 515 (1994)).  
1 The jury did not reach the charge in Count 2, Murder in the Second Degree, 
as it found Hilario guilty as to Count 1, Murder in the First Degree. 
2  For the purposes of sentencing, Counts 3 and 4 were merged with Count 1.  
As to Count 1, Hilario was sentenced to life imprisonment without the 
possibility of parole. As to Count 5, Hilario was sentenced to five years of 
imprisonment. The terms are to run consecutively .

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
According to Hilario, even when considering permissible 
“excluded periods,”   the delay of his trial to  January 7, 2013 
caused a violation of  Rule 48.  A majority of the judges on the  
ICA panel agreed, noting that the period from September 17, 2012   
(the trial date that was set prior to January 7, 2013)  to 
December 20, 2012 (the date Hilario filed his Motion to Dismiss)  
(“the relevant time period”)  should not have been excluded for 
Rule 48 purposes because the delay resulted from the circuit 
court’s erroneous determination that a defense witness was an 
alibi witness, consequently  requiring additional time to make 
necessary disclosures; thus, Hilario’s trial commenced beyond the prescribed period in Rule 48, and should have been dismissed 
upon Hilario’s motion.    
Accordingly, the ICA “vacate[d] [the] July 25, 2013 
Judgment and remand[ed] [the case] for dismissal of the charges 
with or without prejudice in the discretion of the Circuit Court 
of the Fifth Circuit.” State v. Hilario , No. CAAP-13-0003039, 
at 17 
–18 (App. Mar. 18, 2016) (mem.). Associate Judge Lisa M. 
Ginoza dissented, stating that the circuit court correctly excluded the relevant time period from the 180-day limit imposed 
by Rule 48 because the delay was caused by Hilario’s decision to 
3
  
 
 
 
   
    
 
 
 
[2])  Even assuming that the ICA correctly determined that 
a percipient witness can never be deemed an alibi witness, 
the ICA nevertheless gravely erred by failing to determine 
whether the trial court abused its discretion in continuing 
the trial, and charging the delay to the defense, due to 
the parties’ anticipated alibi disclosures, and outstanding 
unrelated discovery.  
 
   
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
                         
   
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
file a Notice of Alibi, and not any error of the circuit court. 
See id. at 193 (Ginoza, J., dissenting). 
On April 21, 2016, the State of Hawai ʻi (“State”) timely 
applied for writ of certiorari (“Application”), presenting two 
questions: 
[1])  Whether the ICA gravely erred by rejecting the trial 
court’s 
determination that a witness might give alibi 
testimony, where he was expected to testify that he was 
present at the shooting, and could have reasonably 
testified as to the defendant’s whereabouts nearby.  
We granted the Application on June 1, 2016. 
Upon review, we conclude the ICA erred in vacating the July 
25, 2013 Judgment and remanding the case for dismissal on the 
basis that the delay in trial was not properly excluded under 
HRPP Rule 48 because the circuit court incorrectly characterized 
a defense witness as an alibi witness. For the following 
reasons, we conclude that it was not clearly erroneous for the 
circuit court to exclude the relevant time period for Rule 48 purposes.

II. Background 
A.   Circuit Court Proceedings 
1. 	Proceedings Prior to the Setting of the September 17, 
2012 Trial Date 
Hilario was arrested on December 17, 2010 and arraigned on 
January 25, 2011. Trial was then set for April 25, 2011.  For 
reasons not now at issue, trial was continued to May 14, 2012.  
It is uncontested that 129 days elapsed between December 17, 
2010 and May 14, 2012 that are included in the 180-day “speedy 
trial” limitation set forth by Rule 48.  See Hilario, mem. op. 
at 17. 
The State estimated the trial to be between four to six 
weeks long. At a hearing on April 12, 2012, the circuit court 
judge4 informed the parties that he would be off-island from June 
13 to June 26, 2012. Because of the estimated duration of the 
trial, he asked the parties how they would like to proceed given 
that he may need to be out of town prior to the trial’s 
conclusion. Both parties opposed having a substantial break during the course of the trial. As Hilario did not wish to 
advance the trial, and because defense counsel was unavailable 
The Honoroable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided.

 4  	Proceedings Related to the February 23, 2012 Defense  
Investigator’s Report  Containing Jens Kyler Hansen- 
Loo’s Statement

from August 9 to 20, 2012, given the court’s availability, trial 
was re-set for September 17, 2012.5 
2.  
A February 23, 2012 defense investigator’s report —  which 
recounted the investigator’s January 12, 2012 conversation with  
Jens Kyler Hansen-Loo (“Hansen -Loo”) —  stated that Hansen-Loo 
saw a family friend, David Manaku (“Manaku”), shoot Moore:  
[O]n the morning of the shooting, [Hansen- Loo] was at his 
grandmother’s home in Anahola. When he awoke, . . . 
Hilario and David Manaku had returned from Kapaa and were 
making plans of going fishing. They all left in 
[Hilario’s] car and both [Hansen -Loo]  and Manaku were 
dropped off on the back road between Anahola Beach and the Hawaiian Homes. They walked down the road  a short distance 
then went over the metal guard rail and were standing in 
the bushes. A short while later [Hansen -Loo] heard [a]  
vehicle stop, a door slam[,] and a Caucasian male got out and the car drove off towards the beach. The male stood 
under a tree next to the road. [Hansen -Loo] added that  
Manaku took out a handgun from his waist band and walked 
towards the male from the back and the next thing he knew, 
Manaku shoots the guy a couple of times and the guy 
crouches down and Manaku shoots him again.  The male falls 
to the ground and they run back up the road and head into a dirt road. [Hansen -Loo] stated that he was shocked and  had  
no idea that Manaku was going to shoot the guy.  
The February 2012 statement was at odds with Hansen  -Loo’s 
statement to police in 2010 , which indicated he “didn’t know 
what had happened.”       
The State received a copy of the investigator’s report in 
March 2012.  According to the State, because Hansen-Loo, a 
6
   The ICA determined that the period between May 14 and September 17, 2012, 
was excludable for the purposes of Rule 48. See  Hilario,  mem. op. at 12. 
Hilario does not contest this conclusion   in his Application; therefore, it is 
not further discussed in this memorandum.   
 
 
 
  
      
 
 
 
   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
“self-proclaimed percipient witness to Moore’s murder,” “refused 
to speak to [Kauaʻ i Police Department] investigators about the 
facts of this case since the January 12, 2102 [sic], statement 
to [the defense investigator],” the State filed a “Motion for an 
HRPP 15 Deposition of Kyler Hansen Loo” on May 3, 2012. The 
circuit court orally granted the motion on May 22, 2012.     
At the scheduled June 14, 2012 deposition of Hansen
-Loo, 
without the benefit of counsel, Hansen-Loo declined to answer many of the State’s questions, a sserting his Fifth Amendment 
right against self-incrimination.  The State then filed a “Motion for an Order Compelling Discovery” on June 22, 2012 , 
requesting that the circuit court issue an order compelling 
Hansen-Loo to answer deposition questions and produce documents.  
At the July 3, 2012 hearing on the matter, the court appointed 
counsel for Hansen-Loo.  At a July 17, 2012 status conference, 
Hansen-Loo’s counsel stated that Hansen -Loo would be invoking 
his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent at any future depositions. This in fact occurred at Hansen-Loo’s rescheduled 
deposition on August 3, 2012. 
On August 10, 2012, the State filed a “Motion for a Court 
Order Preventing Jens Kyler Hansen-Loo from Testifying at Trial, or, in the Alternative[,] Disqualifying [Hilario’s Counsel,] 
Keith Shigetomi” (“Motion to Prevent”). According to the State, 
Hansen-Loo’s February 2012 statement to the defense investigator

  6 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
“is simply a legally inadequate attempt to provide HRPP [Rule] 
12.1, ‘hip pocket’ alibi evidence for Hilario.”   The State 
explained:  
If the defense wishes to argue Hilario was somewhere 
else, doing something else, e.g., something other than 
murdering Moore . . . , HRPP [Rule] 12.1  controls.  Hilario 
must state --  in writing --  where he was when Moore was 
murdered, if not, the law allows no alibi evidence.  
 
Hilario cannot rely upon [Hansen -]Loo to establish a 
phony alibi; Hilario must comply with HRPP [Rule] 12.1. 
The State argued that for Hilario’s non -compliance with the 
6 notice and disclosure requirements of HRPP Rule 12.1,  the 
Rule 12.1 NOTICE OF ALIBI 
(a) Notice by defendant.  If a defendant intends to rely 
upon the defense of alibi, the defendant shall, within the 
time provided for the filing of pretrial motions or at such 
later time as the court may direct, notify the prosecutor 
in writing of such intention and file a copy of such notice 
with the court. 
(b) Disclosure of information and witnesses.  Upon 
receipt of notice that the defendant intends to rely upon 
an alibi defense, the prosecutor shall inform the defendant 
in writing of the specific time, date, and place at which 
the offense is alleged to have been committed. The 
defendant shall then inform the prosecutor in writing of the specific place at which the defendant claims to have 
been at the time of the alleged offense and the names and 
addresses of the witnesses upon whom the defendant intends 
to rely to establish such alibi. The prosecutor shall then 
inform the defendant in writing of the names and addresses 
of the witnesses upon whom the government intends to rely 
to establish defendant’s presence at the scene of the 
alleged offense. 
(c) Time of giving information. The court may fix the 
time within which the exchange of information referred to 
in section (b) shall be accomplished. 
(d) . . . 
(e) 
Failure to comply.  Upon the failure of either party 
to comply with the requirements of this rule, the court may 
exclude the testimony of any undisclosed witness offered by 
such party as to the defendant’s absence from, or presence 
at, the scene of the alleged offense
.  This rule shall not 
limit the right of the defendant to testify in the 
defendant’s own behalf. 
(f)
	 Exceptions.  For good cause shown, the court may

7   The State also  argued in the alternative that Hilario’s counsel “be 
disqualified from representing Hilario because he is a witness relevant to 
Loo’s credibility.”  This issue is not before the court .

    
 
 
 
    *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
circuit court should sanction Hilario by excluding Hansen- Loo’s 
testimony.7 
On August 21, 2012, the State requested a chambers 
conference. At the conference, the trial court indicated that 
it was inclined to require a notice of alibi before permitting 
Hansen-Loo to testify.8 Hilario then filed a “Notice of Alibi” 
(“Notice”) on August 22, 2012, stating that he “hereby gives 
notice pursuant to Rule 12.1 of the Hawaii Rules of Penal 
Procedure of his intention to rely upon the defense of alibi.” 
Two days later on August 24, 2012, a hearing was held on 
several motions as well as Hilario’s August 22, 2012 Notice of 
Alibi. The court opened the hearing by stating that it “would like to address first . . . the notice of alibi.” 
Hilario’s counsel explained that he filed the Notice 
because of the trial court’s statements at the chambers 
conference following the filing of the State’s Motion to 
Prevent: 
Your Honor, I received the State ’s motion for court 
order preventing Jens Kyler Hansen -Loo from testifying at 
(. . . continued) 
grant an exception to any of the requirements of this rule.  
HRPP Rule 12.1 (emphasis added). 
8 Content of the chambers conference is inferred from references by counsel 
at the August 24, 2012 hearing.

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
trial, or in the alternative, to disqualify me on Tuesday 
the 22nd, or the 21st. And upon my review, although I 
disagree with it, I don ’t believe that -- one of the basis 
that they’ re saying to prevent Hansen -Loo from testifying 
is that he is an alibi witness and that proper notice was 
not given as to I guess his status as an alibi witness. And I disagree with that. 
But in the abundance of caution, I filed that  notice 
of alibi.  The purpose of the notice of alibi is to give  
notice of a witness, and they are fully aware of Hansen -
Loo’s  status as a witness from March of this year.  So, 
it’s not as if   we were hiding that witness or anything like 
that.  They knew  about that witness, and the purpose of the 
rule is that they have  notice of the witness.  
So, we gave them that a long time ago.  Now, I still  
-- my position is still that he ’s not an alibi witness.  
However, I’ m not about to tell the Court that I want him  
prevented from testifying, because obviously he is a critical witness.   But 
our position as to the notice of 
alibi is that it’s not necessary. N ow, I know from our 
discussions in chambers, the Court disagrees. And the Court finds that Hansen -Loo is an alibi witness, that the 
Court is going to require that the steps set forth in Rule 12.1 be followed. And so our position is that although he’s not  -- we don’t consider him an alibi witness, 
obviously we’re not going to forego calling him as a 
witness.  
(emphasis added). Hilario’s counsel repeatedly emphasized 
that the defense did not view Hansen-Loo as an alibi 
witness: 
And I just want to put on the record our position is that 
we don’t believe he’s an alibi witness.  
 
 Because this witness will not say or is unable to say 
where Vicente Hilario was on the day in question. What that witness does say, however, is that he was present at 
the time of the shooting, that he witnessed the shooting, and that it was not Vicente Hilario who did the shooting. . 
. .  
Over defense counsel’s objection s, the court explained that 
10
  
 
 
 
   
 
    
                         
 
  
   But wouldn’t that be absence, which is absence of a  
person, which is an alibi? Because when you look at 
12.1(e) about the testimony, it talks about not only the 
absence, but  also the presence at the scene.  So, absence 
from the scene, presence at the scene, those all pertain to 
the alibi defense.  
 
    
 
[T]he first issue for the Court is whether to strike it  
and not allow any testimony regarding the alibi.  And that,  
from the Court’s perspective . . . would be detrimental to 
Mr. Hilario in the presentation of his defense to not allow 
him to present a defense that is available to him.     *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Hansen-Loo’s testimony could support an alibi defense,9 and 
therefore disclosures pursuant to Rule 12.1, starting with the 
Notice, were required. 
Despite the Notice’s untimeliness, t he court then declined 
to strike it, as the court wished to allow Hilario the 
10  opportunity to present every available defense.  Having allowed 
the Notice of Alibi to stand, the court noted that once 
exchanges were made pursuant to Rule 12.1(b), “the Prosecutor 
has the discretion to conduct an investigation on any 
information that’s being exchanged, so that’s going to take 
time. And the reality is that with the trial date set for 
September 17th, pursuing this defense is not going to allow the 
trial to start within that time frame. ”   In other words, the 
court reasoned that “by allowing the Defendant to pursue the alibi defense, there has to be a continuance of the trial date.” 
The court was inclined to charge the delay to the defense  
9 The circuit court stated: 
10 The circuit court explained: 
11
  
 
 
 
  
        
 
                         
 
 
 
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
because the delay was “gen erated by th[e] notice of alibi, ” but 
heard argument before making its decision. 
The State asserted that it was “prepared and ready to 
proceed . . . on September 17th.” After expl aining that she 
understood the court’s inclination to permit Hilario to pursue 
an alibi defense despite the tardily filed Notice, the 
11prosecutor argued that “Rule 48 [(c)(4)(ii) ] . . . indicates 
that if there is a continuance granted to allow the Prosecutor additional time to prepare the Prosecutor’s case, and additional 
time is justified because of the exceptional circumstances . . . 
that time should be excluded.” The State expressed  that after 
necessary disclosures we re made pursuant to Rule 12.1, it “would 
need additional time to follow up to do further investigation.”  
Hilario’s counsel did not directly address the 
Rule 
48(c)(4)(ii) issue that was raised by the State, but instead 
11  Excludable periods under Rule 48 include: 
periods that delay the commencement of trial and are caused 
by a continuance granted at the request of the prosecutor if:
 (i) the continuance is granted because of the 
unavailability of evidence material to the prosecution’s 
case, when the prosecutor has exercised due diligence to 
obtain such evidence and there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that such evidence will be available at a later 
date; or  
 (ii) the continuance is granted to allow the 
prosecutor additional time to prepare the prosecutor’s case 
and additional time is justified because of the exceptional 
circumstances of the case[.]   
HRPP Rule 48(c)(4). 
12
  
 
 
 
  So, our position is it’s not an alibi. And we don’t 
feel that a continuance is generated because of that, but I understand the Court’s position. We just want to make it 
clear that that’s our p osition.  
 
  
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
reiterated his argument that Hansen-Loo was not an alibi 
witness: 
Your Honor, we just want to be clear that our 
position again is that it’s not an alibi, that [Hansen -Loo] 
simply is an eyewitness. He’s also going to impeach David 
Manaku, who says he saw Mr. Hilario do the shooting; 
whereas, the witness is saying he saw David Manaku do the  
shooting.  
 
Having heard the parties’ arguments, the court set 
disclosure deadlines that extended past September 17, 2012, 
re-set trial for January 7, 2013, and excluded the period 
of continuance for Rule 48 purposes. 
In sum, the circuit  court concluded  at the hearing: (1) 
Hansen-Loo was an alibi witness  because he would testify that 
Hilario was absent from the scene; (2) the Notice of Alibi was untimely filed on August 22, 2012; (3)  precluding Hansen-Loo’s 
testimony was not an appropriate sanction for the untimely filing of the Notice, as Hilario should be permitted  to present 
an available defense; (4) the Notice triggered mandatory HRPP 
Rule 12 disclosures and deadlines, thereby preventing trial from 
commencing on September 17, 2012 ; and (5) accordingly, “[f] or 
purposes of Rule 48 and for speedy and public trial, time is  
charged to Mr. Hilario .” Trial was re-set to begin with jury  
selection on January 7, 2013.

determination that Hansen Loo’s proffered testimony to be 
alibi evidence;  
 
 
 
 
  
     
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
On September 18, 201 2, Hilario filed a “Motion for 
Reconsideration of Determination of Alibi Defense ” (“Motion to 
Reconsider”), asserting the following based on the records and 
files of the case: 
b. . . . Hansen Loo has stated that he was present at the 
scene of the shooting of decedent, that he did not see 
Defendant at the scene of the shooting and that David Manaku shot the decedent; 
c. Hansen Loo is unable to say where Defendant was at the 
time of the shooting [and therefore his testimony does not 
comprise an alibi defense] ; 
. . . 
j. Defendant has no witness to say where Defendant was at 
the time of the alleged incident other than Defendant [and 
he has a right under the federal and State constitutions against self -incrimination, and should not be required to 
make pre- trial statements pursuant to HRPP Rule 12].  
The State argued in response that Hansen-Loo would testify that 
“Hilario was not at the murder scene,” which is an alibi. The 
State further argued that because “Hilario has filed a notice of 
intent to rely upon alibi[,] HRPP 12.1 applies and must be 
enforced.” At an October 2, 2012 hearing, the trial court 
denied the Motion to Reconsider, stating that Hansen-Loo would 
be permitted to testify so long as Hilario complied with HRPP 
Rule 12.1. The denial order was entered on October 12, 2012. 
On December 20, 2012 , Hilario filed a “Motion to Dismiss 
for Violation of: (1) Rule 48 of the Hawaii Rules of Speedy 
Trial and (2) Right to Speedy Trial ” (“Motion to Dismiss”),

arguing, among other things, that the delay in trial caused by 
the court’s decision that Hansen -Loo was an alibi witness should  
have been charged to the State, not Hilario. According to 
Hilario, this non-excludable time period, coupled with the non-
excludable period from the date of Hilario’s arrest to the date 
of the first trial setting, exceeded the 180-day speedy trial 
period required under HRPP Rule 48.  Moreover, “the delay in 
bringing Defendant to trial . . . has crippled defense 
preparation through loss of recall and possible loss of 
witness(es). Because of the substantial and irreversible 
prejudice caused by the delay  . . . [,]  [d]ismissal with 
prejudice is mandated.” The State filed a response on December 24, 2012.  
The circuit court held a hearing on the motion on December 
27, 2012. 
Hilario argued several periods should not have been 
excluded for Rule 48 purposes. He did not provide a specific argument with respect to whether any portion of the relevant time period was excludable, other than to recount the 
circumstances leading to the trial’ s continuation.
12 After 
hearing argument, the court explained: 
12  Defense counsel stated : 
[T]he Court had set for [sic] the trial date for August  
27th.  And then again, there were motions filed.  And I  
believe it was the State’s motion to strike or to prohibit  
the calling of Jens Kyler Hansen -Loo based on the fact that 
the State --  the State’s position was that he was an alibi

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
[W]hat happens is when we get to the August 24 date, this 
is where we get into the discussion regarding the alibi 
defense and the requirements of the alibi defense and Rule 
12.1. The option for the Court at that time was to not 
allow it, because, first of all, the Court made a ruling 
over the objection of the Defendant that the testimony presented was, in essence, an  alibi type defense.  
 
And so, that --  the objection was already noted.  
Once the Court made that ruling, the options for the Court was to not allow it or to do Weinberg versus Dixon -Weinberg 
type analysis where you look for other options. And the 
other option was to move the trial to give the Defendant an 
opportunity to comply with 12.1, which was a less drastic 
measure. And so, that is what the Court did to give Mr. 
Hilario the opportunity to present an alibi defense and to 
comply with the requirements of 12.1, which are rather 
specific. And whether Mr. Hilario chooses to use that or 
chooses not to use that, those are within his discretion at 
time of trial.  
And so, the Court finds from the August 24 date to 
the trial date that is set is also not a violation or it 
doesn’t come towards Rule 48 for speedy and public trial.  
The court ultimately denied the Motion to Dismiss. 
Trial commenced on January 7, 2013. On March 8, 2013, a  
jury found Hilario guilty of Counts 1, 3, 4, and 5. Judgment 
was entered by the circuit court on July 25, 2013. Hilario was 
sentenced to life imprisonment.   
B. Appeal to the ICA 
Hilario timely filed a Notice of Appeal with the ICA. In 
his opening brief before the ICA, Hilario argued, among other 
witness for which no notice was given. 
And on August 24th, 
the Court ruled over our objection that Mr. Hansen -Loo was 
an alibi witness, and therefore, necessitated the filing of 
a notice of alibi as well as the required responses under 
the rule. 
And at that point, the Court continued the trial to 
January 7th.

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
things, that Hansen-Loo was not an alibi witness, and “[t]he 
trial court erroneously denied Hilario’s Motion to Dismiss” 
because it failed to count the period “from September 19, 
2012[13] to December 20, 2102 [sic][14]” against the State , as the 
delay was due to alibi disclosure procedures erroneously imposed on Hilario. 
The State entertained the argument in its answering brief 
that under certain circumstances Hansen-Loo may not be an alibi witness: 
If [Hansen- Loo] was the only defense witness to establish 
that [Hilario] was not at the shooting  —  via [Hansen- Loo’s] 
testimony that he was present and [Hilario] was not  —  then 
the State does not believe this is technically alibi 
testimony because under Rule 12.1  , there would be nothing 
to disclose: a witness who is present at the crime and saw 
that the defendant was not there, cannot establish the location of the defendant at the time the crime was 
committed.  
(emphasis added). Nevertheless, the State countered that the 
continuation of trial from September 17, 2012 to January 7, 2013 
was made with Hilario’s consent because , with respect to the 
issue of Hansen-Loo’s testimony, Hilario failed to object “to the January 7, 2013 trial date 
or the fact that the delay would 
be charged to the defense for Rule 
48 purposes .”  (emphasis 
added). 
13 It is unclear why Hilario argued the non -excludable period began on 
September 19, 2012, when trial had been previously set for September 17, 
2012. 
14  December 20, 2012 was the date Hilario filed his Motion to Dismiss.  
According to Hilario’s Motion, 115 non -excludable days elapsed from August 
27, 2012 to December 20, 2012.

  In Hawai i, an alibi defense is “an attempt by 
the defendant to demonstrate he did not commit the 
crime because, at the time, he was in another place 
so far away, or in a situation preventing his doing 
the thing charged against him.” State v. Cordeira, 
68 Haw. 207, 210, 707 P.2d 373, 376 (1985) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). . . . See 
also  Black’s Law Dictionary ,  [sic]  87 (10th ed. 2014) 
(“1. A defense based on the physical impossibility of a defendant’s guilt by placing the defendant in a 
location other than the scene of the crime at the 
relevant time. . . . 2. The quality, state, or 
condition of having been elsewhere when an offense 
was committed.”).  
 
  
  
   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
The ICA concluded that the trial court erred in determining  
that Hansen-Loo was an alibi witness:  
Hilario, mem. op. at 14. “As Hansen -Loo was not an alibi 
witness, the procedure set out in HRPP Rule 12.1 did not apply 
and Hilario’s trial should not have been delayed on this basis.” 
Id. at 15 (footnote omitted). 
The ICA also noted that “it was the State that first 
characterized Hansen-Loo as an alibi witness, a characterization 
that the defense never adopted and actively contested. Absent 
this characterization, there would be no reason for the defense 
to file a notice of alibi.”   Id. at 15.    Accordingly, the ICA 
determined the State’s argument that Hilario had consented to 
continuing the trial to January 7, 2013 was not founded in the 
record. See id.   at 16.       
Judge Ginoza dissented, reasoning that  
the Circuit Court correctly determined[] the delay in trial   
was a result of Hilario filing his Notice of Alibi, which 
was filed on August 22, 2012 (less than a month before the 
scheduled September 17, 2012 trial date). . . . Although 
Hilario’s counsel later argued that he did not believe 
18
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
     
  
  
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Hansen-Loo was an alibi witness and that he filed the 
Notice of Alibi “in an abundance of caution,” Hilario 
nevertheless chose to file the Notice of Alibi and never 
withdrew it .” 
Id. at 19 (Ginoza, J., dissenting) (first emphasis in original; 
second emphasis added). 
III. Standard of Review 
The appellate court reviews a trial court’ s denial of a 
HRPP Rule 48 motion to dismiss under both the “clearly 
erroneous” and “right/wrong” tests: 
A trial court’s findings of fact (FOFs) in deciding an HRPP 
48(b) motion to dismiss are subject to the clearly 
erroneous standard of review. An FOF is clearly erroneous when, despite evidence to support the finding, the 
appellate court is left with the definite and firm 
conviction that a mistake has been committed. However, 
whether those facts fall within HRPP 48(b)’s exclusionary 
provisions is a question of law, the determination of which is freely reviewable pursuant to the “right/wrong” test.  
State v. Samonte, 83 Hawai ʻi 507, 514, 928 P.2d 1, 8 (1996) 
(quoting State v. Hutch, 75 Haw. 307, 328 –29, 861 P.2d 11, 22 
(1993)). 
IV. Discussion 
The circuit court  and Judge Ginoza 
correctly observed that  
the issue of whether Hilario’s case should be dismissed on Rule 
48 grounds is distinct from the question of whether the trial 
court erred in determining that Hansen-Loo’s testimony could 
present an alibi defense.   The circumstances on August 24, 2012 
at the time the circuit  court continued the trial from September 
17, 2012 to January 7, 2013 included: the trial court’s 
19
  
 
 
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
evidentiary determination that Hansen- Loo’s testimony supported 
an alibi defense; Hilario’s filing  of a Notice of Alibi  just two 
days prior; the State’s ongoing and known difficulties in 
interviewing Hansen-Loo; and the State’s representation that it 
would need time to investigate any new information that might be 
contained in ensuing Rule 12.1 disclosures.  Under the 
circumstances of this case, the trial court was not wrong in 
determining that granting  an additional investigatory period to 
the State was a justifiable excludable period  under Rule 48.    
HRPP Rule 48(c)(8) allows for exclusion  of “periods of delay for 
good cause.”  This court has  held that the “good cause” 
provision of Rule 48(c)(8) is “provided to take care of 
unanticipated circumstances,” “and that “good cause means a 
substantial reason that affords legal excuse.”  State v. 
Abregano,  136 Hawai ʻi 489, 497, 36 3 P.3d 838, 846 (2015)  
(citations omitted). 
Whether a period of time is excludable as 
“good cause” under HRPP Rule 48(c)(8) is dependent on the facts 
of each case.    See  State v. Herrera, 63 Haw. 405, 409, 629 P.2d  
626, 629 (1981) (“‘Exceptional circumstances,’ like ‘good 
cause,’ is dependent on the facts of each case.”); Abregano, 136 
Hawaiʻi at 498, 3 63 P.3d at 847  (citing id.).   The facts and 
circumstances of this case, as outlined in Part II.A.2. above   , 
were unanticipated, and constituted substantial reason that 
affords legal excuse.

[O]n the morning of the shooting, [Hansen- Loo] was at his 
grandmother’s home in Anahola. When he awoke, . . . 
Hilario and David Manaku had returned from Kapaa and were 
making plans of going fishing. They all left in 
[Hilario’s] car and both [Hansen -Loo] and Manaku were 
dropped off on the back road between Anahola Beach and the 
Hawaiian Homes.   They walked down the road a short distance 
then went over the metal guard rail and were standing in 
the bushes. A short while later [Hansen -Loo] heard [a]  
vehicle stop, a door slam[,] and a Caucasian male got out 
and the car drove off towards the beach. The male stood 
under a tree next to the road.  [Hansen -Loo] added that  
Manaku took out a handgun from his waist band and walked 
towards the male from the back and the next thing he knew, 
Manaku shoots the guy a couple of times and the guy 
crouches down and Manaku shoots him again.  . . .  
 
(emphasis added).   Although the crux of the statement is that Hansen -Loo 
observed someone other than Hilario shoot Moore, the statement contains other 
information regarding Hilario’s whereabouts at the time of the shooting. 
Hansen-Loo stated  that Hilario was “in a location other than the scene of the 
crime at the relevant time.” Black’s Law Dictionary  87 (10th ed. 2014) 
(defining “alibi”); see also  id.  at 1838 (defining an “alibi witness” as “[a] 
witness who testifies that the defendant was in a location other than the 
scene of the crime at the relevant time; a witness who supports the 
defendant’s alibi”); Hilario , mem. op. at 14 (citing State v. Cordeira, 68 
 15 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Hilario repeatedly argues that the trial court erred when 
it determined that Hansen-Loo’s testimony could support an alibi 
defense. According to Hilario, without such a determination, 
Rule 12.1 disclosures need not have been made, and therefore 
trial could have occurred on September 17, 2012. We need not 
and do not determine whether Hansen-Loo’s testimony as reflected 
in the defense investigator’s report actually presente d an alibi 
defense.15 Whether or not it was, the circuit court was not 
Although we do not decide whether Hansen -Loo’s testimony presented an alibi 
defense, we note that at the time of the August 24, 2012 hearing on the 
State’s Motion to Prevent, Hansen -Loo had already declined multiple times to 
answer any of the State’s deposition questions regarding the shooting. Thus, 
the only evidentiary basis for Hansen -Loo’s proffered t estimony was contained 
in the February 2012 defense investigator’s report. 
The report stated in relevant part:

wrong in excluding the relevant time period for good cause under 
HRPP Rule 48(c)(8) for Rule 48 purposes.  We also note that the 
time period of the continuance for these purposes was also 
reasonable. 
V. Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the ICA’s April 15, 
2016 Judgment on Appeal entered pursuant to its March 18, 2016 
Memorandum Opinion, and remand this matter to the ICA for 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Haw. 207, 210, 707 P.2d 373, 376 (1985)). Specifically, 
Hansen- Loo’s 
statement that Hilario “dropped off” Hansen- Loo and Manaku on the “back road” 
a short distance from where the shooting took place minutes before the 
shooting could create a reasonable inference that Hilario had proceeded to a 
fishing spot in the area.  Such an inference could support an alibi defense, 
but we do not decide this issue as it is not necessary to do so.
