KENNETH A. MONIZ, Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant.
  
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS  
(CAAP-13-0003064; CR. NO. 12

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ., 
with Wilson, J., concurring separately,  
and Nakayama, J., dissenting, with whom Recktenwald, C.J., joins )

 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Kenneth A. Moniz seeks 
review of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (“ICA”) May 15, 
2015 Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its April 17, 2015 
Summary Disposition Order, which affirmed the Circuit Court of 
the Third Circuit’s (“circuit court”) August 5, 2013 Judgment of 
Conviction and Probation Sentence (“circuit court judgment”).1 
After entering into a conditional guilty plea, Moniz was 
1 The Honorable Glenn S. Hara presided.

convicted of Habitually Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence 
of an Intoxicant (“HOVUII”), in violation of Hawai i Revised 
Statutes (“HRS”) § 291E -61.5 (2007).2 We accepted Moniz’s 
Application for Writ of Certiorari, and we now vacate the ICA’s 
Judgment on Appeal and the circuit court judgment and remand the 
case to the circuit court for further proceedings. 
After being arrested for suspicion of operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant, Moniz was taken to the 
police station, where he was read an implied consent form.3 
2 HRS § 291E- 61.5 provides in relevant part: 
A person commits the offense of habitually operating a 
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if:  (1) The 
person is a habitual operator of a vehicle while under the 
influence of an intoxicant; and (2) The person operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: (A) While 
under the influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to 
impair the person’s normal mental faculties or ability to 
care for the person and guard against casualty; . . . [or] 
(C) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of breath[.] 
3 The form read in relevant part: 
1. ___  	Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public 
way, street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of 
the State shall be deemed to have given consent to a 
test or tests for the purpose of determining alcohol 
concentration or drug content of the persons [sic] 
breath, blood or urine as applicable. 
2. ___ 	 You are not entitled to an attorney before you 
submit to any tests [sic] or tests to determine your alcohol and/or drug content. 
3. ___ 	 You may refuse to submit to a breath or blood test, 
or both for the purpose of determining alcohol 
concentration and/or blood or urine test, or both for the purpose of determining drug content, none shall be 
given [sic], except as provided in section 291E -21.  
However, if you refuse to submit to a breath, blood, or

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Moniz elected to take a breath test, which resulted in a breath 
alcohol content reading of 0.165 grams of alcohol per 210 liters 
of breath. Moniz filed a motion to suppress the breath test 
results, on the basis that his Fourth Amendment rights (among 
other constitutional rights) were violated.  The circuit court 
denied the motion. The ICA affirmed the circuit court’s denial 
of this motion to suppress, relying on its opinion in State v. 
Won, 134 Hawai i 59, 332 P.3d 661 (App. 2014). On certiorari, 
Moniz contends that (1) the police improperly advised him that 
he was not entitled to an attorney in violation of HRS § 803-9; 
and (2) the ICA erred when it ruled that a Miranda warning was 
not required to be given to him before he decided whether to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test.  Moniz noted in his 
Application that this court had accepted certiorari in State v. 
Won, SCWC-12-0000858.  
In State v. Won,  136 Hawaiʻ i 292, 312, 361 P.3d 1195, 1215 
(2015), we held that “coercion engendered by the Implied Consent 
Form runs afoul of the constitutional mandate that waiver of a 
constitutional right may only be the result of a free and 
unconstrained choice,” and, thus, a defendant’s decision to 
(continued. . .)  
urine test, you shall be subject to up to thirty days 
imprisonment and/or fine up to $1,000 or the sanctions of 291E- 65, if applicable.  In addition, you shall also 
be subject to the procedures and sanctions under chapter 
291E, part III.

submit to testing after being read the implied consent form “is 
invalid as a waiver of his right not to be searched.” In 
accordance with Won , the result of Moniz’s breath test was the 
product of a warrantless search, and the ICA erred by concluding that the circuit court properly denied Moniz’s motion to 
suppress the breath test result. Accordingly, Moniz’s HOVUII 
conviction cannot stand. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s May 15, 2015 Judgment 
on Appeal and the circuit court judgment are vacated, and the 
case is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings 
consistent with this court’s opinion in Won.
