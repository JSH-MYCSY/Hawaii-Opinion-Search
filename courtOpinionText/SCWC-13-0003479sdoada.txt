Disposition Order, which affirmed the District Court of the

and/or Order and Plea/Judgment entered on August 20, 2013.1 The 
district court found Reilly guilty of Operating a Vehicle Under 
the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaiʻ i 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(4) (Supp. 2012).2 We 
accepted Reilly’s Application for Writ of Certiorari, and we now 
vacate the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal and the district court’s 
Judgment and remand the case to the district court for further 
proceedings. 
After being arrested for OVUII, Reilly was read an 
implied consent form.3 Reilly elected to take a blood test, 
1 The Honorable David W. Lo presided.
 
2 HRS § 291E -61(a)(4) provides in relevant part:
 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates 
or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
. . . 
(4) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one 
hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood. . . . 
3 The form, titled “Use of Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle 
Implied Consent for Testing ,” stated in relevant part: 
1.___ Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public 
way, street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of the 
State shall be deemed to have given consent to a test or 
tests for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration 
or drug content of the persons [sic] breath, blood, or 
urine as applicable. 
2. ___ You are not entitled to an attorney before you 
submit to any tests or tests to determine your alcohol 
and/or drug content. 
3. ___ You may refuse to submit to a breath or blood test, 
or both for the purpose of determining alcohol 
concentration and/or blood or urine test, or both for the 
purpose of determining drug content, none shall be given,

   In State v. Won , 136 Hawaiʻ i 292, 312, 361 P.3d 1195, 
1215 (2015), we held that “coercion engendered by the Implied 
Consent Form runs afoul of the constitutional mandate that  
waiver of a constitutional right may only be the result of a free and unconstrained choice,” and, thus, a defendant’s 
decision to submit to testing after being read the implied 
consent form “is invalid as  a waiver of his right not to be 
searched.” In accordance with Won, the result of Reilly’s blood  
test was the product of a warrantless search, and the ICA  erred  
in concluding that Reilly’s Fourth Amendment rights were not 
violated. Accordingly, Reilly’s OVUII conviction cannot be 
upheld.

which resulted in a blood alcohol content reading of 0.10 grams 
of alcohol per 100 milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood.  
In his motion to suppress the blood test results before the 
district court and on certiorari, Reilly contends, inter alia, 
that the blood test results were obtained based on his 
involuntary consent in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the 
United States Constitution and Article I, Section 7 of the 
Hawaiʻi Constitution. 
except as provided in section 291E -21.  However, if you 
refuse to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, you 
shall be subject to up to thirty days imprisonment and/or fine up to $1,000 or the sanctions of 291E -65, if 
applicable. In addition, you shall also be subject to the procedures and sanctions under chapter 291E, part III.
