OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J. 
 
In 2013, Timmy Hyun Kyu Akau (Akau) filed a petition 
with the District Court of the First Circuit (district court) 
pursuant to Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 to 
vacate, set aside, or correct his 1987 conviction for driving 
while under the influence of an intoxicating liquor (DUI).  The Electronically Filed

 district court1 denied Akau’s petition, and the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed the district court’s denial of 
his petition in an unpublished memorandum opinion .2  The ICA 
observed that Akau had waited over twenty- five years to 
challenge his DUI conviction.  As a result of the intervening 
delay, no transcripts of any of the proceedings in Akau’s DUI 
case were available.  The ICA affirmed the denial of Akau’s  HRPP 
Rule 40 petition on the basis of the equitable doctrine of 
laches. 
We conclude that Akau’s right to counsel was violated 
in 1987.  We also hold that the equitable doctrine of laches 
does not apply to HRPP Rule 40 petitions. 
I.  BACKGROUND 
In June 2013, Akau filed a petition to vacate, set 
aside, or correct judgment or to release petitioner from custody 
in accordance with HRPP Rule 40.  In his petition, Akau sought 
to have the court set aside a conviction stemming from a charge 
of DUI dating from 1987. 
Where an HRPP Rule 40 petition for post- conviction 
relief states a colorable claim, an evidentiary hearing on the 
petition is required.  HRPP Rule 40(f); Wilton v. State, 116

State, CAAP- 13-0003754 (App. Jan. 31, 2017) (mem.).  _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***_

 Hawaiʻi 106, 122– 23, 170 P.3d 357, 373 –74 (2007) ( citing Hutch v. 
State, 107 Hawaiʻ i 411, 414, 114 P.3d 917, 920 (2005) for the 
holding that “a hearing on a Rule 40 petition is required 
whenever the allegations in a petition, if taken as true, (1) 
would change the verdict rendered or (2) would establish the 
illegality of custody follo wing a judgment[]”  (internal 
citations and quotation marks omitted)).  If the factual 
allegations of the petition, taken as true, “would entitle the 
petitioner to relief,” the petition states a colorable claim.  
HRPP Rule 40(f).  Here, after examining the petition, the 
district court concluded that Akau had stated a colorable claim
for post-conviction relief in his petition and, accordingly, an
evidentiary hearing was held in July 2013.  
 
After hearing Akau’s testimony, the district court 
entered findings of fact and conclusions of law.  Although the 
shorthand notes of Akau’s arraignment and trial were destroyed 
in the late 1990s pursuant to the court’s record retention 
policy, the district court reviewing Akau’s petition was able to 
make findings of fact based on the surviving minimal original 
court records combined with Akau’s testimony at the evidentiary 
hearing. 
In its findings of fact, the court found that on July 
26, 1987, Akau was arrested and charged with DUI.  Two days 
later, he appeared before the District Court, Ewa Division, and _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***_ 
4 
 pled not guilty.  He was referred to the Office of the Public 
Defender, and trial was scheduled for December 23, 1987.  On 
December 23, 1987, Akau appeared in court without counsel and 
requested a continuance.  As he later testified at the 
evidentiary hearing on his Rule 40 petition, he requested the 
continuance “[b]ecause I wanted to get an attorney present at 
the time.”  His request for a continua nce was denied.  After 
3trial,
 Akau was convicted of DUI.  He was sentenced to a small 
fine, a DUI class, and a 90-day license suspension.  
In 2013, Akau filed an  HRPP Rule 40 petition to 
vacate, set aside, or correct judgment.  In his petition, Akau 
asserted that at the time of his 1987 arrest for DUI, he was not 
familiar with court procedures or with the purposes behind his 
appearances.  He asserted that he did not have the assistance of 
counsel at arraignment, trial, or sentencing.  He did not recall 
ever being informed that he had a constitutional right to a jury 
trial, or that he had a right to have an attorney represent him, 
at public expense, if necessary.  Nor did he recall being 
informed that he had a right to appeal his conviction.  He could 
not recall a judge ever explaining the nature of the offense, 
the pleas and defenses available, or the punishment that might 
                                                           
 3 Trial was conducted before the Honorable Francis Yamashita.  At 
the time, a defendant charged with DUI was entitled to a jury trial.  
Subsequently, in 1990, the legislature reduced the maximum penalty for the 
offense such that a jury trial was no longer constitutionally required.  See
State v. Nakata, 76 Hawai ʻi 360, 364- 65, 878 P.2d 699, 703 -04 (1994).   _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***_

 be imposed; he did not recall the judge informing him concerning 
the risks of self-representation.
 
In its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order 
filed September 11, 2013, the district court denied Akau’s 
petition, concluding that the passage of twenty- five years 
between Akau’s trial in 1987 and his petition in 2013 “is an 
inordinate amount of time leading to the nonexistence of Court 
records.”  As a result, the court ruled that it would be 
“inequitable to grant the Petition because the passage of 
twenty-five (25) years has resulted in the unavailability of 
records, and unusually handicaps the State in meeting its burden 
and preparing a response to the Petition.”  
The ICA affirmed the district court’s ruling, which 
the ICA characterized as “[r]elying in part on principles from 
the doctrine of laches[ .]”  In addition, the ICA noted that a 
number of other jurisdictions apply laches in denying petitions 
for post-conviction relief, citing seven out-of-state or federal 
cases.  The application of laches in such circumstances, the ICA 
surmised, recognizes “the importance of finality in our criminal 
justice system[.]
” 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
“A proceeding under HRPP Rule 40 is similar to a civil 
bench trial in that the court is required to enter findings of 
fact and conclusions of law in support of its decision.”  Raines _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***_ 
6 
 v. State, 79 Hawai ʻi 219, 222, 900 P.2d 1286, 1289 (1995).  An 
appellate court reviews a lower court’s interpretation of a 
court rule de novo.  Sierra Club v. Dep’t of Transp. , 120 Hawaiʻi 
181, 197, 202 P.3d 1226, 1242 (2009). 
III.  DISCUSSION 
Under the Sixth Amendment to  the United States 
Constitution, an accused has the right to counsel appointed at 
public expense because the right to counsel is “fundamental and 
essential to a fair trial[.]”  Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 
335, 342-44 (1963) (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted) (explaining that the assistance of counsel “is one of 
the safeguards of the Sixth Amendment deemed necessary to insure 
fundamental human rights of life and liberty” ( quotation marks 
and citation omitted) and that the right to counsel is one of 
those “constitutional principles established to achieve a fair 
system of justice”).  “ Article I, Section 14 of the Hawaiʻi 
Constitution also guarantees the accused the right to counsel.”  
State v. Pitts, 131 Hawaiʻi 537, 541, 319 P.3d 456, 460 (2014) 
(“‘In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall en joy the 
right to . . . have the assistance of counsel for the accused’s 
defense.’” (citation omitted)).  “A ‘critical stage’ of the 
prosecution is any stage where ‘potential substantial prejudice 
to defendant’s rights inheres.’”  Id. (citation omitted).  Trial 
is obviously a critical stage of the prosecution.  Wong v. _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***_ 
7 
 Among, 52 Haw. 420, 423 –24, 477 P.2d 630, 633 (1970) (“The right 
to assistance of counsel is so fundamental and essential to a 
fair trial that it has been absorbed into the due process clause 
of the Fourteenth Amendment.”).  “It is well settled that the 
sentencing phase is a critical stage of the prosecution, during 
which the right to counsel attaches.”  Pitts, 131 Hawai ʻi at 544, 
319 P.3d at 463.  Akau (a) had never been represented either by 
court-appointed or privately-retained counsel with respect to 
the charge, (b) had received no prior continuance in the case, 
and (c) requested a continuance at the commencement of trial 
because he “wanted to get an attorney present . . . .”  He was 
denied his right to assistance of counsel (whether court-
appointed or privately retained) at trial and also at 
sentencing. 
We have recognized that the erroneous deprivation of 
the right to counsel under article I, section 14 of the Hawai ʻi 
Constitution is a structural error not subject to harmless error 
analysis; no showing of prejudice is required in part because 
the denial of counsel is “so likely to prejudice the accused 
that the cost of litigating [its] effect in a particular case is 
unjustified[,]” United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 658-59 
(1984), and because these “circumstances involve impairments of 
the Sixth Amendment right that are easy to identify and . . . 
easy for the government to prevent.”  Strickland v. Washington, _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***_ 
8 
 466 U.S. 668, 692 (1984); see also State v. Loher, 140 Hawaiʻi 
205, 221, 398 P.3d 794, 810 (2017) (quoting Strickland , 466 U.S. 
at 692); State v. Reed , 135 Hawaiʻ i 381, 389, 351 P.3d 1147, 1155 
(2015) (“Because the denial of the right to counsel of choice is 
a structural error, we need not subject the court’s abuse of 
discretion to a harmless error analysis.”).  Thus, an erroneous 
deprivation of the right to counsel , as occurred in this case, 
constitutes an abuse of discretion not subject to harmless error 
analysis. 
The ICA affirmed the district court’s decision to deny 
Akau’s Rule 40 petition based on laches.  We hold that the 
doctrine of laches does not apply in the context of HRPP Rule 40 
petitions. 
HRPP Rule 40(a)(1) contains no statute of limitations 
for bringing petitions and, instead, explicitly states that Rule 
40 petitions seeking relief from a judgment of conviction may be 
brought “[a]t any time” so long as they are not brought “prior 
to final judgment[.]”  This lack of a statute of limitations 
appears to be deliberate, as the drafters of HRPP Rule 40 
rejected the use of an Illinois statute as the template for a 
statute of limitations on post- conviction petitions.  Comm. For 
Penal Rules Revision of the Judicial Council of Haw., Proposed 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal Procedure  at 206 (June 1975) (commenting 
on proposed Rule 40 and citing but then rejecting an Illinois _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***_ 
9 
 statute that imposed a time limit of 20 years for post-
conviction petitions).  We therefore decline to impose a kind of 
judicially-crafted statute of limitations on Rule 40 petitions 
seeking relief from a judgment of conviction when that rule as 
promulgated explicitly states that such petitions may be brought 
“[a]t any time” so long as they are not brought “prior to final 
judgment[.]”  HRPP Rule 40(a)(1); see also
 HRPP Rule 40(a)(2) 
(allowing any person to “seek relief under the procedure set 
forth in this rule from custody based upon a judgment of 
conviction” on specified grounds but not imposing a time 
limitation on seeking that relief). 
We also note that HRPP Rule 40(a) governs all 
extraordinary writs, including writs of coram nobis.  A writ of 
coram nobis acts as a “remedy to correct errors of the most 
fundamental character where the petitioner has completed his [or 
her] sentence or is otherwise not in custody and circumstances 
compel such action to achieve jus tice.”  Carvalho v. Olim, 55 
Haw. 336, 344, 519 P.2d 892, 898 (1974).  Application of laches 
to writs of coram nobis would have precluded consideration by 
the United States District Court of the Northern District of 
California of the writ of coram nobis brought by Fred Toyosaburo 
Korematsu to overturn his conviction in 1942 for remaining in a 
military area in violation of Civilian Exclusion Order No. 34 
issued by the Commanding General of the Western Command, U.S. _*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***_ 
10 
 Army, which ordered all persons of Japanese ancestry to leave 
the area.  Korematsu v. United States, 584 F. Supp. 1406, 1409 
(N.D. Cal. 1984). 
IV. CONCLUSION 
For the reasons stated above, we vacate the ICA’s 
judgment on appeal, Akau’s 1987 conviction for DUI, and the 
district court’s findings of fa ct, conclusions of law, and order 
dated September 11, 2013 concerning his HRPP Rule 40 petition. 
We remand to the district court for further proceedings 
consistent with this opinion.
