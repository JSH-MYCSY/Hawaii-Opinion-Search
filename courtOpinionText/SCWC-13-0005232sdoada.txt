Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment (district court 
judgment).1 The district court found Cheek-Enriques guilty of 
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant 
(OVUII), in violation of Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-
61(a)(3) (Supp. 2010).2 We accepted Cheek-Enriques’s Application 
for Writ of Certiorari, and we now vacate the ICA’s Judgment on 
Appeal and the district court judgment and remand the case to 
the district court for further proceedings. 
After being arrested for OVUII, Cheek-Enriques was 
taken to the police station, where he was read an implied 
consent form.3 Cheek-Enriques elected to take a breath test, 
1 The Honorable David Lo presided. 
2 HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2010) provides in relevant part: 
(a)	 A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under
the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
. . . 
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten
liters of breath. . . . 
3 The form read in relevant part: 
1. ___ 	 Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public way,
street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of the State
shall be deemed to have given consent to a test or tests for
the purpose of determining alcohol concentration or drugcontent of the persons [sic] breath, blood or urine asapplicable. 
2. ___ 	 You are not entitled to an attorney before you submit to
any tests [sic] or tests to determine your alcohol and/or drugcontent. 
(continued . . .)

 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
which resulted in a breath alcohol content reading of 0.155 
grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Cheek-Enriques filed a motion to suppress the breath test results based on a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States 
Constitution and Article I, Section 7 of the Hawai ʻi 
Constitution, which the district court denied. The ICA affirmed 
the district court’s denial of this motion to suppress. On 
certiorari, Cheek-Enriques contends, inter alia, that he did not 
constitutionally consent to the breath test because “[t]elling someone that [he or she] must consent to a 4th Amendment search or face 30 days in jail simply is not consent under the 4th Amendment.” 
In State v. Won, 136 Hawai ʻi 292, 312, 361 P.3d 1195, 
1215 (2015), we held that “coercion engendered by the Implied Consent Form runs afoul of the constitutional mandate that waiver of a constitutional right may only be the result of a 
(. . . continued) 
3. ___ 	 You may refuse to submit to a breath or blood test, or
both for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration
and/or blood or urine test, or both for the purpose of
determining drug content, none shall be given [sic], except as
provided in section 291E-21. However, if you refuse to submitto a breath, blood, or urine test, you shall be subject to upto thirty days imprisonment and/or fine up to $1,000 or thesanctions of 291E-65, if applicable. In addition, you shall
also be subject to the procedures and sanctions under chapter
291E, part III.

free and unconstrained choice,” and, thus, a defendant’s 
decision to submit to testing after being read the implied consent form “is invalid as a waiver of his right not to be searched.” In accordance with State v. Won, the result of 
Cheek-Enriques’s breath test was the product of a warrantless 
search, and the ICA erred by concluding that the district court properly denied Cheek-Enriques’s motion to suppress the breath test result. Accordingly, Cheek-Enriques’s OVUII conviction may not be upheld. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s June 3, 2015 
Judgment on Appeal and the district court judgment are vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court for further 
proceedings consistent with this court’s opinion in
 State v.
