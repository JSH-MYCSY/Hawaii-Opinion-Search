court judgment).1 Lee entered a conditional plea to the charges 
of Habitually Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an 
Intoxicant (HOVUII), in violation of Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 291E-61.5 (2007),2 and of Driving While License Suspended 
or Revoked, in violation of HRS § 286-132 (2007).3 We accepted 
Lee’s Application for Writ of Certiorari, and we now vacate the 
ICA’s Judgment on Appeal and the circuit court judgment as to 
both charges and remand the case to the circuit court for 
further proceedings. 
1 The Honorable Glenn S. Hara presided.
 
2 HRS § 291E- 61.5 (2007) provides in relevant part:
 
(a)	 A person commits the offense of habitually operating
a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if: 
(1)	 The person is a habitual operator of a vehicle
while under the influence of an intoxicant; and 
(2)	 The person operates or assumes actual physical
control of a vehicle: 
. . . . 
(C)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath. . . . 
3 HRS § 286- 132 (2007) states in pertinent part: 
Except as provided in section 291E- 62, no resident or 
nonresident whose driver’s license, right, or privilege to
operate a motor vehicle in this State has been canceled,
suspended, or revoked may drive any motor vehicle upon the
highways of this State while the license, right, orprivilege remains canceled, suspended, or revoked. 
Although no specific issue concerning HRS § 286- 132 was raised in the 
Application for Writ of Certiorari, the record indicates that Lee entered a 
conditional plea to both charges.

  After being arrested for HOVUII and Driving While 
License Suspended or Revoked, Lee was taken to the police 
station, where he was read an implied consent form.4 Lee elected 
to take a breath test, which resulted in a breath alcohol content reading of 0.091 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of 
breath. Lee filed a motion to suppress evidence of the breath 
test based on, inter alia, a violation of the Fourth Amendment 
of the United States Constitution, which the circuit court 
denied. Lee subsequently entered a conditional guilty plea as to both charges that allowed him to appeal the denial of his 
motion to suppress the breath alcohol test. The ICA affirmed 
the circuit court’s denial of the motion to suppress.

  ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
On certiorari, Lee contends, inter alia, that he did 
not constitutionally consent to the breath test under the Fourth 
Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article I, 
Section 7 of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution because his consent was 
coerced by the implied consent form, which conveyed a threat of 
imprisonment and significant punishment for refusal to submit to 
a breath, blood, or urine test, under HRS § 291E-69 (Supp. 
2010). 
In State v. Won, 136 Hawaiʻ i 292, 312, 361 P.3d 1195, 
1215 (2015), we held that “coercion engendered by the Implied 
Consent Form runs afoul of the constitutional mandate that 
waiver of a constitutional right may only be the result of a 
free and unconstrained choice,” and, thus, a defendant’s 
decision to submit to testing after being read the implied 
consent form “is invalid as a waiver of his right not to be searched.” In accordance with State v. Won, the result of Lee’s 
breath test was the product of a warrantless search, and the ICA 
erred by concluding that the circuit court properly denied Lee’s 
motion to suppress the breath test result. Accordingly, Lee’s 
conviction as to both charges cannot be upheld. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s June 5, 2015 
Judgment on Appeal and the circuit court judgment are vacated, and the case is remanded to the circuit court with instructions 
to enter an order granting Lee’s motion to suppress and to allow
