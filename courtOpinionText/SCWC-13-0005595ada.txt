DECEMBER 22, 2015
  
OPINION BY McKENNA, J.  
  
 
I. Introduction 
Petitioner/Defendant-
Appellant Jonathan Henley (“Henley”) 
appeals from the ICA’s judgment, which affirmed the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit’s1 (“circuit court”) Judg ment of 
Conviction and Sentence, which adjudged Henley guilty of Assault 
in the Third Degree, sentenced him to 30 days’ imprisonment, and 
The Honorable Patrick W. Border presided. 1         
 
  
  
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
increased bail from $200.00 to $2,000.00 cash only pending 
execution of sentence. On certiorari, Henley asserts (1) that 
insufficient evidence supported his conviction; (2) that the 
circuit court abused its discretion in increasing his bail 
pending appeal; and (3) that the circuit court abused its 
discretion in sentencing him to jail for a first offense. Upon 
reviewing the record, we conclude (1) that the circuit court 
plainly erred in failing to instruct the jury on mutual affray; 
and (2) that the district court abused its discretion in 
increasing Henley’s bail from $200.00 to $2,000.00 cash only 
pending appeal. We do not reach the issue of whether the 
circuit court abused its discretion in sentencing Henley to jail 
for a first offense. Because there was sufficient evidence for 
the conviction, this matter is remanded to the circuit court for 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
II. Background 
A. Proceedings in Circuit Court 
1. Complaint and Jury Demand 
Henley was charged by Complaint with “intentionally, 
knowingly, or recklessly caus[ing] bodily injury to Gary K. 
Massey, thereby committing the offense of Assault in the Third 
Degree, in violation of Section 707-712(1)(a) of the Hawaii 
2
         
 
   
   
 A two-day jury trial took place.  The State called two 
witnesses: 
the complaining witness, Gary Massey (“Massey”), and 
a police officer who responded to the scene of the alleged 
assault. Henley called one witness, his friend Kalanikapu Copp 
(“Copp”), who was with him at the time of the alleged assault. 
Henley also testified in his own defense.

Revised Statutes.”2 He was represented by court-appointed 
counsel. Henley demanded a jury trial and was bound over to the 
circuit court. 
2. Jury Trial 
a. Testimony of Gary Massey 
The complaining witness, Massey, testified that he was 68 
years old and worked as a security officer for the Colony Surf 
Hotel on the evening of November 9, 2012. He arrived at 10:30 
p.m. to relieve another security officer, who told him that 
there was a party in Room 205 that generated two noise 
complaints and reports of graffiti in the stairwell. The other security officer had called the Honolulu Police Department. 
When police officers arrived, they and Massey went to Room 205 
and dispersed the party guests. The police officers left, and 
Massey went to the 19th floor and walked down the stairwell, as 
part of his normal duties. Around 12:30 a.m., he heard more 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 707 -712(1)(a) (2014) provides, as it 
did at the time of the alleged offense, “A person commits the offense of 
assault in the third degree if the person . . . [i]ntentionally, knowingly, 
or recklessly causes bodily injury to another person[.]”

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
party noise coming from Room 205 and called the police again. 
Together, they cleared the room once more. 
Massey testified that an officer told him to escort two 
individuals off the property. Those individuals were Henley, 
who had a guitar strapped onto his back, and Copp, Henley’s 
friend. As the two were descending the stairs, they called 
Massey a “fucking faggot haole” and told him to “go back to 
[his] gay country.” According to Massey, as Copp exited the 
stairwell, Massey held the door open, and Henley head-butted 
Massey above the right eye, causing Massey to feel pain. Massey 
fell backwards and hit the ground, while Henley threw punches at 
him. When Massey was on the ground, Henley stood over him with 
a foot on either side of him; Massey then reached up and grabbed 
Henley’s left testicle and squeezed it. Henley screamed and 
jumped off of Massey. At some point during this encounter, 
Massey was kicked or punched in the left ear. 
Henley and Copp then ran into Kapiolani Park, and Massey 
alerted the police officers, who were still upstairs on the second floor, that he had been assaulted. The police officers 
drove through Kapiolani Park and located Henley and Copp. 
Massey then positively identified Henley as his assailant. On 
cross-examination, Massey admitted that Henley and Copp were 
voluntarily leaving the premises when Massey was following them, 
and that Massey could have remained behind them at a distance.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
b. Testimony of Officer Nicholas Muna 
The State also called Honolulu Police Department patrol 
officer, Nicholas Muna, who testified that he was called to Room 205 twice on the night of November 9, 2012 to disperse a loud 
party. After the second call, as he was talking to the renter 
of Room 205, he heard a yell for help coming from downstairs.  
He ran downstairs to find the security officer flagging him down 
and pointing towards Kapiolani Park, saying, “[T]hose two guys, 
they just attacked me.” Officer Muna got into his patrol car 
and drove through the park. When two males ran out from behind a tree, Muna detained them. 
Later, Muna spoke with Massey, who related that he escorted 
the two males off the property when they started arguing with 
him. The argument escalated, and Massey was punched and head-
butted. Muna testified that Massey told him that after Massey 
fell onto his back, he was punched again in the left ear. 
Massey reported pain to his face, and Muna observed a small cut above Massey’s left ear. On cross-examination, Muna testified 
that he would never direct Massey to escort people off the property because he would not want to be responsible if Massey 
were injured. 
c. Testimony of Kalanikapu Copp 
Henley called Copp, his classmate and friend of two or 
three years, to testify in his defense. Copp testified that, on 
5
         
 
   
  
  
   
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
   
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
the night in question, he and Henley were at the Colony Surf 
Hotel for a friend’s birthday party. They were taking turns 
playing Henley’s guitar at the party. The first time the party 
was dispersed, Massey and four or five police officers showed 
up.  Copp stayed behind to use the bathroom, and Henley left the 
party. Copp testified that the police officers gave him 
permission to stay, and Copp called Henley to return to Room 
205. Henley returned, accompanied by a few other people. They 
were playing music on the speakers when Massey and the police 
officers returned and told Henley and Copp to leave. 
Copp and Henley exited Room 205 and passed Massey, who had 
a “real smug look on his face.” Henley told Massey, “I bet you 
feel real big right now just bossing us around,” and Copp told 
Massey “F you.” Copp’s comment “kind of set [Massey] off,” so 
Massey followed them as they were descending the stairwell and 
called them “hippies” and “faggots.” Copp went through the 
doorway at the bottom of the stairs first. He turned back and 
saw Massey grab Henley “on the arm and . . . kind of jerk him 
forward.” Henley then turned around and pushed Massey in the 
solar plexus. Massey fell. When he got up, he told Henley, 
“[Y]ou’re going to get it now,” and tried to tackle Henley. 
Massey tried to put Henley in an “arm bar or a choke.” At this 
point, Copp punched Massey once, but Massey did not let Henley go, so Copp jabbed Massey three more times. Copp also saw

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Massey grab Henley’s testic les. Massey let go of Henley but was 
still clinging onto Henley’s shirt as Henley attempted to leave. 
Copp “karate chopped” Massey’s hand, causing Massey to finally 
let go of Henley. 
Copp and Henley then ran into Kapiolani Park. Massey 
continued to pursue them, so Copp gave Massey “a little push 
kick just right to his midsection[.]” Copp and Henley hid from 
Massey in a banyan tree and were ultimately discovered by the 
police. Copp testified that he did not see Henley head-butt 
Massey, although he did see Henley push Massey in the solar 
plexus. Copp testified that he was the one who punched Massey, 
probably causing the scratch to Massey’s left ear. 
d. Testimony of Jonathan Henley 
Henley took the stand. He testified that he worked in 
telecommunications. According to Henley, he had just turned 19 on November 8, 2012, and he was at the Colony Surf Hotel to 
celebrate multiple birthdays, including his own. He had brought along his guitar that he constantly carries around with him.  
Henley stated that there was no alcohol at the get-together. He 
and Copp were planning on sleeping over. After arriving at the 
party, they “jammed” for at least two hours. The police and a 
security officer ended the party, and Henley left by himself. 
He saw the security officer arguing with a large group of 
people. Copp then called Henley and told him they had 
7
         
 
  
  
  
  
    
  
 
 Copp and Henley were leaving the property when they heard 
Massey yelling for help.   They ran towards a tree in order to 
talk and regroup. There they were apprehended by the police.    
Henley emphasized in his testimony that he did not head-butt or 
hit Massey, but that he did push Massey in the chest.   After 
Henley’s testimony, the defense rested.    
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
permission to return to Room 205 and stay the night.  Henley 
returned with five others, and they played music on the stereo 
system before the police and security officer returned.   The 
security officer accused Copp and Henley of “br[inging] the party back, . . . start[ing] up the music, . . . [and] hanging 
off the [lanai.]”   Copp and Henley were directed to leave.   
Copp and Massey started arguing, and Mass
ey followed Copp 
and Henley out of the room and to the stairwell. Massey called Copp and Henley “faggots,” “hippies,” “punks,” and “ignorant 
children,” and Copp told Massey to “fuck off.” Copp exited the 
door at the bottom of the stairs, and Henley was about to exit when Massey “grabbed [Henley] from the back but like on the 
upper arm.” Henley “just react[ed]” and “shoved [Massey] 
away[.]” Massey let go but then tried to tackle Henley. Massey 
did not succeed, so he then “bailed towards the ground and 
grabbed [Henley’s] balls.” Copp saw what was happening, so he 
hit Massey a few times until Massey released Henley. 
8
         
 
    
 The State requested a jury instruction based on the Hawai i 
Standard Jury Instructions Criminal (“HAWJIC”) 9.21 jury 
instruction on Assault in the Third Degree.   The requested 
instruction stated the following:  
 
 
 A person commits the offense of Assault in the Third 
Degree if he intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes 
bodily injury to another person.  
 There are two material elements of the offense of 
Assault in the Third Degree, each of which the prosecution 
must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I  REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
3. Jury Instructions 
In the Complaint, the Defendant, Jonathan Henley, is 
charged with the offense of Assault in the Third Degree. 
These two element s are: 
1. That, on or about November 10, 2012 in the City 
and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, the Defendant caused bodily injury to another person; and 
2. That the Defendant did so intentionally, 
knowingly, or recklessly. 
The requested instruction was eventually withdrawn in favor of 
the submission of an almost identically worded “Court’s General 
Instruction No. 23,” by agreement of the partie s.   The Court’s 
General Instruction No. 23 simply identified the person bodily 
injured as “Gary K. Massey.”   No instruction on mutual affray 
was given to the jury; that standard jury instruction (HAWJIC 9.21A) states the following:  
If you find that the prosecution has proven the offense of 
Assault in the Third Degree beyond a reasonable doubt, then you must also determine whether the prosecution has proven 
beyond a reasonable doubt that the fight or scuffle was not 
entered into by mutual consent. This determination must be 
unanimous and is to be indicated by answering “Yes” or “No” 
on a special interrogatory which will be provided to you.  
No special interrogatory on mutual affray (HAWJIC 9.21C) was 
given to the jury, either.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
4. Verdict and Sentencing 
The jury found Henley guilty as charged. Henley’s 
sentencing hearing was held the day after trial concluded.  The 
State sought a sentence of 30 days’ imprisonment, one year 
probation, and anger management treatment. Defense counsel 
sought a sentence of probation because Henley had no prior 
criminal record. He counter-argued that there was “no rational 
basis in the evidence that [Henley] has any anger management 
problems.” The circuit court then questioned defense counsel as 
to why probation would be necessary, if a probation officer would have “nothing to supervise,” given that there did not seem 
to be a need to impose any special conditions involving drug, 
alcohol, or mental health treatment; or anger management.  
Defense counsel responded that a probation officer would still 
monitor whether Henley had further contacts with law enforcement 
or was working or in school. 
At that point, defense counsel remarked that he noticed 
that the court had “three individuals from Public Safety in the courtroom[.]” That observation prompted defense counsel to 
point out that, under HRS § 804-4(a), “the right to bail shall 
continue after conviction of a misdemeanor”; defense counsel 
argued that Henley’s $200.00 bail must continue. Defense 
counsel stated that he intended to appeal Henley’s conviction. 
10
         
 
  The State then asserted that Henley’s bail should be 
increased to $11,000.00 pending appeal.   The State reasoned, 
“[Henley] is not from here. Appeals take a long time. . . I 
don’t know what his living situation is now, however, there’s 
obviously the possibility over on the course of a lengthy appeal 
that a defendant may not --”   Although the State did not finish 
its sentence, the circuit court interrupted, “It’s happened 
quite often.”   The State responded, “Exactly.”   The State and  
the circuit court seemed to imply that Henley would likely leave 
Hawaii during the course of his appeal. Defense counsel 
corrected the implication, stating  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
[T]hat’s not true. . . [Henley] and his father moved here 
from Arkansas. . . [H]is father started his construction 
business over here so that –  that’s where they live now, 
this is where they remain. And this is where he will be over the next several years . . . . [R]ight now the only 
indication is his father says they intend to stay here.  
The State insisted that Henley’s $200.00 bail be increased 
pending appeal. The circuit court disagreed with the State’s 
assertion that “bail can be increased,” stating, “No, but the bail can be adjusted to the risk. He’s now a convicted 
misdemeanant and the risk of flight is very high in these cases.”   Defense counsel again argued that HRS § 804-4 supported 
his contention that the circuit court could not increase Henley’s bail; the circuit court responded, “Okay. I know 
you’re wrong on that one, but okay.”   Accordingly, defense  
counsel argued that if the circuit court was going to increase 
11

         
 
  
  
 
 After defense counsel concluded his sentencing arguments, 
the circuit court sentenced Henley to 30 days’ imprisonment, 
with credit for any time  served.   Although the circuit court 
stayed mittimus pending Henley’s appeal, it also increased 
Henley’s bail from $200.00 to $2,000.00 cash only, with no 
further hearing on bail.   Therefore, Henley was taken into 
custody and not released until his father paid the $2,000.00 
3 cash only bail three days later.     
  
  
 
 
 
                     
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
bail, he asked it to limit the increase to $2,000.00, the 
maximum fine for a misdemeanor, “because [Henley’s] father can 
post the bond today.”   The court remarked tha t Henley’s father’s 
ability to pay the bond was “useful information.”  
At this point, Henley was al
lowed his right to allocution.  
Henley stated that he was focused on school and work and “get[ting] his life together[.]” He stated that was trying to 
avoid jail time, which would cause him to lose his job, which 
would further hamper his ability to save for school. 
B. ICA Appeal 
On appeal, Henley raised the following points of error: 
(1) There was insufficient evidence to convict [Henley] of 
Assault in the Third Degree.
 
. . . . 
(2) The trial court abused 
its discretion in raising 
[Henley’]s bail pending appeal in a misdemeanor case. 
. . . .  
We note that the procedure in this case was unusual
, as sentencing 
should precede any discussion of bail pending appeal. Procedurally, trial 
courts should address sentencing before addressing any issues regarding bail 
on appeal. 
12
 3         
 
  
 
 
 
  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
(3) The trial court abused its discretion in sentencing 
[Henley] to 30 days jail as a first time offender. 
In a summary disposition order (“SDO”), the ICA affirmed th e 
circuit court’s judgment of conviction and sentence. State v. 
Henley, CAAP-13-0005595 (App. Jan. 29, 2015) (SDO) at 1.  As to 
the first point of error, the ICA held that sufficient evidence 
supported Henley’s conviction, based on the jury’s apparent 
determination that Massey’s testimony (that Henley head -butted 
him without provocation) was more credible than Copp’s and 
Henley’s. Henley, SDO at 3. 
The ICA concluded that the second point of error was 
“without merit.” Id. The ICA stated that Henley “p lainly 
misreads HRS § 804- 4” in arguing that the trial court is 
prohibited from changing the amount of bail after a defendant is 
convicted of a misdemeanor. Id.
 The ICA reasoned 
A defendant who is pending trial and is clothed with the 
presumption of innocence is in a different position than a defendant who has been adjudged guilty of a crime. A 
defendant who is pending sentencing is also in a different 
position than a defendant who has been sentenced to a term 
of incarceration. In addition, evidence adduced during the 
trial or sentencing may affect the trial court’s evaluation of the appropriate bail amount and conditions for a 
defendant. We conclude that the Circuit Court did not 
abuse its discretion in raising Henley’s bail from $200 to 
$2000 (cash only) pending his appeal.  
 
Henley, SDO at 4. To support its conclusion, the ICA also cited 
to HRS § 804-9 (2014) for the following language: “The amount 
of bail rests in the discretion of the justice or judge. . . .”; 
and HRS § 804-6 (2014) for the following language (with emphasis 
added): “ Unless otherwise ordered by the court  the bail bond 
13
         
 
  As to the third point of error, the ICA noted that the 
circuit court is vested “with wide discretion” in imp osing 
sentence, and that 30 days’ incarceration was not an abuse of 
discretion, given the evidence adduced at trial that “Henley 
assaulted Massey, a sixty-eight-year-old man, by head-butting 
Massey above the right eye and . . . thr[owing] punches at 
Massey.” Id.  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
given by any defendant prior to the defendant’s conviction, 
shall, in cases where bail after conviction is permitted either 
absolutely or by order of the court,  be continued as the bail of 
the defendant after conviction, and until the final determination of any subsequent proceedings in the cause.” Id.    
III. Standards of Review 
A. Unrequested Jury Instructions 
As a general rule, jury instructions to which no objection 
has been made at trial will be reviewed only for plain 
error. An error will be deemed plain error if the 
substantial rights of the defendant have been affected adversely. Additionally, this court will apply the plain 
error standard of review to correct errors which seriously 
affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of 
judicial proceedings, to serve the ends of justice, and to 
prevent the denial of fundamental rights. 
State v. Kikuta, 125 Hawai i 78, 95, 253 P.3d 639, 656 (2011) 
(citing State v. Nichols , 111 Hawai i 327, 334, 141 P.3d 974, 981 
(2006)) (quotations marks and brackets omitted). 
14
         
 
   
 “Plain  errors or defects affecting substantial rights may 
be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of 
the court.” Hawai i Rules of Penal Procedure (“HRPP”) Rule 52(b) 
(1977). 
  
 
 
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
B. Plain Error 
C. Bail 
“It is settled that the determination of the amount of ba il 
rests peculiarly within the discretion of the trial court. An 
appellate court should not disturb or interfere with the 
exercise of such discretion, unless it is clearly abused.” 
Sakamoto v. Won Bae Chang,
 56 Haw. 447, 451, 539 P.2d 1197, 1200 
(1975) (citation omitted). 
D. Sentencing 
This court has stated: 
[a] sentencing judge generally has broad discretion 
in imposing a sentence. The applicable standard of 
review for sentencing or resentencing matters is 
whether the court committed plain and manifest abuse 
of discretion in its decision. Factors which indicate a plain and manifest abuse of discretion are 
arbitrary or capricious action by the judge and a 
rigid refusal to consider the defendant’s 
contentions. And, generally, to constitute an abuse 
it must appear that the court clearly exceeded the 
bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles 
of law or practice to the substantial detriment to 
the litigant.  
State v. Kong, 131 Hawai i 94, 101, 315 P.3d 720, 727 (2013) 
(quoting State v. Rivera , 106 Hawai i 146, 154-55, 102 P.3d 1044, 
1052-53 (2004)).

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
IV. Discussion 
On certiorari, Henley raises the following questions 
presented: whether “(1) there was insufficient evidence to 
support his conviction; (2) the Circuit Court abused its 
discretion in raising his bail pending appeal; and (3) the 
Circuit Court abused its discretion in sentencing him to jail 
for a first offense.” As a preliminary matter, we agree with 
the ICA that the standard for appellate review compels the 
conclusion that sufficient evidence supported Henley’s 
conviction as the jury apparentl y credited Massey’s testimony, 
and credibility determinations are for the trier of fact. Henley, SDO at 3.  We accepted certiorari in this case, however, 
because the circuit court plainly erred in failing to instruct 
the jury on mutual affray, and we cannot say that this error is 
harmless. Therefore, we vacate the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal, 
which affirmed the circuit court’s judgment of conviction and 
sentence, and remand this case for further proceedings. Although a retrial obviates the need for this court to address 
the second and third issues, we address the second issue to 
provide the circuit court with guidance on remand. We do not 
address the third issue.

 See, e.g., 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
A. 	The Circuit Court Plainly Erred in Failing to Instruct the Jury on Mutual Affray 
Although neither the State nor Henley has raised the issue, 
we note that the circuit court in this case was required to 
instruct the jury on mutual affray. 
“[I]n our judicial system, 
the trial courts, not parties, have the duty and ultimate 
responsibility to insure [sic] that juries are properly 
instructed on issues of criminal liability.” State v. Adviento, 
132 Hawai
i 123, 137, 319 P.3d 1131, 1145 (2014)(citations 
omitted); see also Nichols, 111 Hawai i at 339, 141 P.3d at 986 
(“[I]t is the duty of the trial court to see that the jury is properly instructed.”). HRPP Rule 30, titled “Instructions to 
the Jury,” also reflects that ultimate responsibility for 
instructing the jury lies with the trial court.  
subsection (c), which authorizes the trial court to refuse, approve, or modify requested instructions; and subsection (d), 
which authorizes the trial court to revise and/or combine 
instructions that were approved and/or not objected to, and which authorizes the trial court to prepare its own instructions 
if no written requests for instructions are made.  
Henley was charged with Assault in the Third Degree under 
HRS § 707-712(1)(a), which states, “A person commits the offense 
of assault in the third degree if the person . . . [i]ntentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes bodily injury 
17

         
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
to another person[.]”  HRS § 707-712(2) goes on to state, 
“Assault in the third degree is a misdemeanor unless committed 
in a fight or scuffle entered into by mutual consent, in which 
case it is a petty misdemeanor.” “Mutual affray” is a 
“mitigating defense” to Assault in the Third Degree, reducing 
the offense from a misdemeanor to a petty misdemeanor. Kikuta, 
125 Hawai i at 95-96, 253 P.3d at 656-57.  
The circuit court, by agreement of the parties, gave the 
jury the standard HAWJIC 9.21 jury instruction, which covers the elements of Assault in the Third Degree enumerated in HRS 
§ 707-712(1)(a).  The circuit court did not give the jury the 
standard HAWJIC 9.21A jury instruction on mutual affray, which tracks the language of HRS § 707
-712(2), or the standard HAWJIC 
9.21C special interrogatory regarding mutual affray. We held in Kikuta that a trial court “must submit a mutual affray 
instruction to the jury where there is any evidence in the 
record that the injury was inflicted during the course of a 
fight or scuffle entered into by mutual consent. . . .” Kikuta, 
125 Hawai i at 96, 253 P.3d at 657 (emphasis added). The notes 
to HAWJIC 9.21A contain the s ame recommendation: “When an 
Assault in the Third Degree instruction [HAWJIC 9.21] is submitted to the jury, the court must also submit a mutual 
affray instruction [HAWJIC 9.21A] and special interrogatory [HAWJIC 9.21C] where there is any evidence that the fight or

    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
scuffle was entered into by mutual consent.” We have previously 
found this recommendation to be “prudent,” notwithstanding the 
introduction to the HAWJIC, which states, “Nothing herein 
contained shall be construed as an approval by the Supreme Court 
of the State of Hawai i . . . of the substance of any of said 
instructions.” Kikuta, 125 Hawai i at 96 n.12, 253 P.3d at 657

“[M]utual affray requires both parties to have approved of, 
or agreed to, a fight or scuffle, whether expressly or by 
conduct.” Id. In this case, there was evidence that Massey was 
injured “during the course of a fight or scuffle entered into by 
mutual consent. . . .” Kikuta
, 125 Hawai i at 96, 253 P.3d at 
657. First, the testimony may have suggested that Massey’s 
decision to follow Copp and Henley caused an already tense 
situation to deteriorate. Massey admitted on cross-examination 
that Henley and Copp were voluntarily leaving the premises when Massey decided to follow them, and that Massey could have 
remained behind them at a distance. There was evidence that 
Copp, Henley, and Massey had already engaged in a few rounds of 
insults and name-calling. Officer Muna testified that Massey 
told him the verbal argument escalated as they all headed down 
the stairs.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Second, Copp and Henley testified that Massey initiated 
aggressive physical contact and attempted several fighting 
maneuvers upon Henley. Both testified that Massey grabbed 
Henley’s arm and jerked him forward as Henley was exiting the 
stairwell. It was at this point that Henley shoved Massey away.  
Undeterred, Massey stated, “[Y]ou’re going to get it now,” 
according to Copp’s testimony. Then, Massey tried to “tackle” 
Henley and put him in an “arm bar or choke.” 
Third, there was evidence to suggest that Massey persisted 
in his attempts to hurt Henley, even after Henley disengaged 
from the fight. According to both Copp and Henley, when Massey 
was unable to tackle Henley or get him into an armbar or 
chokehold, Massey grabbed Henley’s testicles. Even after Henley 
sprang off of Massey, Copp testified that Massey “was still clinging onto Henley’s shirt as Henley attempted to leave,” 
which caused Copp to “karate chop” Massey’s hand. 
This testimony provided the evidence in the record that 
Massey’s “injury was inflicted during the course of a fight or scuffle entered into by mutual consent. . . .” Kikuta, 125 
Hawaii at 96, 253 P.3d at 657 (emphasis added). Consequently, 
the circuit court should have given the jury an instruction and 
special interrogatory on mutual affray; the circuit court 
plainly erred in failing to do so.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Further, we cannot say that the omission of the mutual 
affray instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, as it 
is possible, on this record, that given a choice between 
convicting Henley on misdemeanor Third Degree Assault and the 
mitigated offense of petty misdemeanor assault, the jury could 
have convicted Henley on the latter.  See Kikuta, 125 Hawai i at 
97, 253 P.3d at 658 (“Inasmuch as it is the duty of the trial 
court to properly instruct the jury, the judgment of conviction 
must be vacated, without regard to whether timely objection was 
made, because there is a reasonable possibility that the error 
contributed to [the] conviction for misdemeanor assault in the 
third degree.”) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the ICA’s judgment on appeal, which affirmed 
Henley’s conviction, is vacated, and this case is remanded to 
the circuit court for a new trial. 
B. 	The Circuit Court Abused its Discretion in Increasing 
Henley’s Bail from $200.00 to $2,000.00 Cash Only . 
On certiorari, Henley argues that that the circuit court 
abused its discretion in increasing his bail pending appeal.  We 
agree. 
Article I, section 12 of the Constitution of the State of 
Hawaii provides, “Excessive bail shall not be required. . . . 
The court may dispense with bail if reasonably satisfied that the defendant . . . will appear when directed, except for a 
21
         
 
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
defendant charged with an offense punishable by life 
imprisonment .” Under HRS § 804-9, “[t]he amount of bail . . . 
should be so determined as to not suffer the wealthy to escape 
by the payment of a pecuniary penalty, nor to render the 
privilege useless to the poor.” Further, under that statute, 
“the officer letting to ba il should consider the punishment to 
be inflicted on conviction, and the pecuniary circumstances of 
the party accused.” In setting bail, we have held that the 
determination of bail under HRS § 804- 9 must be made “on an 
individualized basis. . . .” Pelekai, 75 Hawai i at 366, 861 
P.2d at 1210. 
In Sakamoto,  56 Haw. at 451, 539 P.2d at 1200, 
this court noted that bail is to be fixed in a reasonable amount, considering the financial status of the defendant and 
the punishment to be imposed upon him on conviction.  
The circuit court abused its discretion in this case by not 
tailoring the bail to Henley’s individual circumstances. 
The police initially set Henley’s $200.00 bail pursuant to the 
chief of police’s authority under HRS § 804 -
5 (2014) (“[W]here 
the punishment for the offense charged may not exceed two years’ 
imprisonment with or without a fine, . . . the chief of police 
or any person name by the chief of police . . . may admit the 
accused person to bail.”). Apparently, $200.00 bail was seen as 
an appropriate amount of bail under the circumstances, as 
22
         
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
   
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
neither the district nor circuit court judges that handled 
Henley’s case changed the amount. 
As this court recently noted in State v. Kiese , 126 Hawai i 
494, 510, 273 P.3d 1180, 1196 (2012), HRS § 804-4 provides that 
“[t]he right to bail shall continue after conviction of a 
misdemeanor,” and our case law holds “an accused misdemeanant 
. . . is entitled to bail as a matter of right after conviction 
and pending appellate review.” (Citing State v. Ortiz, 74 Haw. 
343, 356, 845 P.2d 547, 553 (1993)). Although Henley’s right to 
bail continued post
-conviction, the circuit court had the 
authority to change the amount of bail post-conviction pursuant 
to its discretionary authority under HRS ' 804-9.  In exercising 
its discretion, it was required by HRS § 804-9, governing the 
amount of bail, to “consider the punishment to be inflicted on 
conviction, and the pecuniary circumstances of the party 
accused.” 
First, regarding the “punishment to be inflicted,” bail w as 
initially set at $200.00 when Henley was facing the possibility 
of one year in jail
. The circuit court ultimately sentenced 
Henley to 30 days’ imprisonment. Despite that, the circuit 
court multiplied the amount of bail tenfold.  Moreover, that the increased bail amount was to be paid in cash only was equivalent 
to increasing bail up to $20,000.00, because a bond normally may 
be obtained for five to fifteen percent of the bail amount in 
23
         
 
  Second, regarding Henley’s “pecuniary circumstances,” 
Henley was 19 years old. Although he was apparently working in 
telecommunications, he was determined to be indigent and was 
represented by court-appointed counsel throughout his trial.   
The circuit court did not find any specific facts about Henley’s 
individual circumstances that would have  justified an increase 
in bail. The State and the circuit court seemed to assume that 
a bail increase was necessary because Henley was a flight risk.  
This assumption was based merely on the fact, however, that 
Henley and his father had apparently recently moved to Hawai i. 
In other words, the increase of  bail was premised upon recency 
of arrival and not risk of flight.   Defense counsel interjected 
that Henley and his father had moved to Hawai  i from Arkansas, 
that his father started a construction business in Hawai i, and 
that the family intended to stay.   Nevertheless, the circuit *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Hawaii.   National Conference of State Legislatures, Bail Bond 
Agent Business Practices, available at 
http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/bail-bond-agent-business-practices.aspx (last visited Dec. 15, 2015).   
Because the issue was not raised, we do not address whether “cash only” bail is permissible under the law, but this case 
highlights the unfairness in conditioning bail on payment in 
cash only.  
24
         
 
  
  
  
 
 
    
 Rather, the circuit court apparently increased Henley’s 
bail amount based on Henley’s father’s ability to pay. D efense 
counsel argued at sentencing that Henley’s increased bail should 
be limited to $2,000.00, the maximum fine for a misdemeanor, “because [Henley’s] father can post the bond today.”   Defense 
counsel represented that Henley’s father could post the 
bond  
(i.e., $100.00 to 350.00, or five to fifteen  percent of the 
proposed bail amount). The circuit court remarked that that was “useful information.” In setting bail at $2,000.00 cash only, 
the circuit court actually set bail even beyond what Henley’s father  stated he could pay that day. Indeed, Henley’s father *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
court persisted in raising Henley’s bail simply because Henley 
was a recent arrival. This approach overtly discriminates  
against recent arrivals, with no indication as to the length of 
time one must live in this state such that  bail will not be 
elevated on that basis.   
The increase in bail was 
also directly contradicted by the 
court’s comments. The circuit court refused to place defendant 
on probation, despite defense counsel ’s request . The circuit 
court did not believe anger management, drug and/or alcohol 
treatment, or mental health treatment was appropriate.  That 
Henley had no other apparent problems reaffirms that the 
increase in bail was simply based on the fact of conviction and 
not determined on an individualized basis. 
25
         
 
  There is also evidence on the record that the circuit court 
used the maximum amount of the fine ($2,000.00) to determine  the 
amount of bail, as that is what defense counsel requested as a 
last resort. Lacking any other justification based on Henley’s 
individual circumstances, this method of increasing bail to 
match the maximum fine is improper. Instead, at its core, the 
bail increase was based simply on the fact that defendant had 
been convicted, sentenced to jail  , and had allegedly “recently” 
arrived in Hawai i, despite his family having settled here.  This 
is clearly contrary to the intent of our bail statutes  with 
respect to misdemeanants.  In short, the circuit court clearly 
abused its discretion in increasing Henley’s bail from $200.00 
to $2,000.00 cash only.   
 The circuit court plainly erred in failing to instruct the 
jury on mutual affray. Based on this error, Henley’s judgment 
of conviction for Assault in the Third Degree must be vacated. For future guidance, however, we also note that the circuit 
court abused its discretion in increasing Henley’s $200.00 bail 
to $2,000.00 cash only bail pending appeal.  Therefore, the 
ICA’s Judgment on Appeal, is vacated, as is the circuit court’s 
judgment of conviction and sentence. This case is remanded to *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
was not able to pay the $2,000.00 cash only bail until three 
days later.
