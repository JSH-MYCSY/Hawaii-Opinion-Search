DISSENTING
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J.
 
Leon Makanalani Faamama was charged with Theft in the
 
First Degree. 
After a jury trial in the Circuit Court of the
 
First Circuit, he was found guilty as charged. Faamama appealed,
 
arguing inter alia that the circuit court erred in not
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
instructing the jury on the lesser-included offense of Theft in
 
the Second Degree. The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA)
 affirmed, and Faamama now seeks review from this court. 
We find that the court erred in failing to instruct the
 
jury on the lesser-included offense. There was a rational basis
 in the evidence for a verdict acquitting Faamama of Theft in the
 First Degree and convicting him of Theft in the Second Degree,
 and this error was not harmless. 
Accordingly, Faamama’s judgment of conviction is
 
vacated and the case remanded for a new trial. 
I. Background
 
A. Trial Proceedings
 
On October 2, 2012, Faamama was charged with Theft in
 
the First Degree in violation of Hawai  'i Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§§ 708-830.5(1)(a)1 and 708-830(2) 2
. 
1 HRS § 708-830.5(1)(a) (2006) provides: 
(1) A person commits the offense of theft in the first
degree if the person commits theft:
 
(a) Of property or services, the value of which
exceeds $20,000[.]
 
2
 HRS § 708-830(2) (2006) provides: 
A person commits theft if the person does any of the

At trial,  the State relied heavily on the testimony of
Pastor John Vaughn, the alleged victim. 
Vaughn met Faamama
 
during the course of his ministry and developed a friendship with
 
him. 
Prior to October 2011, Faamama told Vaughn that he was 
participating in the Hawai
'i Drug Court program, but was being 
harassed by the Drug Court administrator, Janice Bennett. Faamama told Vaughn that he was routinely forced to move from one clean-and-sober house to another and each time pay the first month’s rent and a security deposit. Faamama also told Vaughn that Bennett was extorting money from him by making him pay large fees that other participants were not made to pay. Faamama asked Vaughn for money for the rent, security deposits, and fees, and Vaughn began giving him money on a weekly basis. 
Faamama told Vaughn that he was going to sue Bennett
 
for harassment, and that once the lawsuit was resolved, Vaughn
 would get all of his money back. Faamama continued asking for
 larger amounts of money, claiming that Bennett kept extorting him
 for more fees and threatening him with imprisonment if he did not
 pay.

deception.  A person obtains, or exerts control over,
the property of another by deception with intent to
deprive the other of the property.

 The Honorable Glenn J. Kim presided.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Vaughn testified that, between October 2011 and
 
February 2012, he gave Faamama $54,000. Vaughn testified that
 
all of this money came from twenty-six withdrawals on his home
 equity line of credit. 
Eventually, Vaughn became concerned that he would not
 
be repaid. Vaughn attempted to go to the Drug Court to talk to
 the presiding judge, Judge Steven Alm, but Faamama told him that
 the lawsuit against Bennett was confidential and therefore Vaughn
 could not enter the court. Faamama told Vaughn that Judge Alm
 was aware of the lawsuit and that, as soon as the outstanding
 fees were paid, the suit could be set for trial. Faamama also
 told Vaughn that Judge Alm had a friend in the Treasury
 Department and that it was assured that the money would be
 returned to Vaughn once the lawsuit was finished. 
Vaughn gave Faamama money by writing checks on his home
 
equity credit line, cashing the checks, and then directly giving
 the cash to Faamama. Vaughn also withdrew around $7,000 by
 maxing out three of his credit cards. Vaughn testified that he
 also received some money from the Veterans Administration after
 his father had passed away, and that he “gave it all”––around
 “three to four thousand dollars”––to Faamama. In addition,
 Vaughn testified that he borrowed approximately $47,000 from his
 friends and relatives that was given to Faamama. 
4
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The State introduced into evidence numerous exhibits to
 
corroborate that the money had been withdrawn by Vaughn. Exhibit
 
18A was data from Vaughn’s checking account, showing that he had
 written a $500 check to Faamama on September 5, 2012. Exhibit
 18B was a spreadsheet showing that Vaughn had withdrawn $53,575
 from his home equity line of credit. Exhibit 18C showed the
 history of Vaughn’s home equity line of credit from September 19,
 2011, to May 8, 2012, and Vaughn testified that all of the cash
 withdrawals were for Faamama. Exhibits 18D and 18E were lists of
 people that had loaned Vaughn roughly $47,000 to help Faamama. 
Exhibit 18F was a spreadsheet of the amount of money that Vaughn
 took for cash advances on his credit cards, totaling $6,395.75. 
The State then introduced Exhibits 1A and 2, which were
 
letters that had been written by Vaughn and given to Faamama to
 give to Judge Alm. In the first letter, dated March 8, 2012,
 Vaughn expressed concern about the “drug court staff . . .
 requiring large sums of money from [Faamama] and threatening that
 he would go to jail if he did not pay.” Vaughn stated that he
 was “concerned about [his] own finances” and that he loaned
 “[Faamama] about $56,000 that the drug court has required of him
 for various things.” 
In the letter dated March 22, 2012, Vaughn wrote to
 
Judge Alm again “out of continued concern and frustration”
 
5
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
because “the Drug Court staff keeps finding new charges that Leon
 
Faamama must pay or go to jail.” He also mentioned that he
 loaned Faamama “over $60,000 over the last several months.” He
 wrote that he had “additional debts at 25% interest” which he was
 “carrying for [Faamama].” 
The State next introduced Exhibit 12, which were
 
receipts dated August 3, 2012, August 22, 2012, August 27, 2012,
 and August 30, 2012. Vaughn testified that he started making
 receipts only toward the “very end,” after his wife told him that
 he should do so, both for his benefit as well as for Faamama’s. 
The total amount of these receipts was approximately $18,000. 
On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Vaughn
 
as to whether Faamama’s Drug Court claims made sense to him.
 Vaughn replied that it did not anymore, but back then he was more
 focused on quickly getting the money to Faamama than asking
 questions. Vaughn also admitted that before he started giving
 money to Faamama, he had run up the debt on his home equity line
 of credit to $134,000. Vaughn also testified that he did not
 keep accounts of his spending or of the money he gave to Faamama. 
He also testified that he “co-mingled his personal money” with
 the money that he received from his friends and relatives by
 putting it in his checking account. 
Vaughn further testified on cross that he never mailed
 
6
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the letters to Judge Alm because he thought Faamama would give
 
them to him. He testified that he did not follow up, despite not
 getting a response, because Faamama told him that the case was
 pending and thus Judge Alm could not talk about it. He said that
 he did go to the Drug Court, but waited outside and never spoke
 to anyone. 
The State introduced several other witnesses at trial,
 
including Judge Alm and Bennett who both testified that the Drug
 Court participants paid a “one-time flat fee” of $250 and that
 Faamama paid nothing more. Further, Bennett testified that she
 did not tell Faamama that he would go to jail if he did not pay
 large sums of money to Drug Court, nor did she require him to pay
 fees that other participants were not paying. 
Faamama did not testify, and the defense did not
 
present any witnesses. At the end of trial, Faamama moved for a
 judgment of acquittal, arguing that the State failed to make a
 prima facie case. The court denied the motion. 
B. Jury Instructions
 
At the end of trial, defense counsel requested that a
 
Theft in the Second Degree instruction be given to the jury
 
because “it’s possible the jury could believe that the State did
 not prove that he took over $20,000 but that [the State] did
 prove, based on the receipts, that he did receive $18,000.” The
 
7
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
circuit court initially agreed, noting that he was going to make
 
the same suggestion. The court stated that a reasonable juror
 may be convinced that the rest of the money was a gift or was not
 proven, and thus would want to convict Faamama only on the basis
 of $18,000, the amount for which there were receipts signed by
 Faamama. 
The State disagreed, arguing that “in order to find
 
[Faamama] guilty of stealing that amount, they would have to
 reject that idea or claim that it was given as a loan, and if
 they reject that idea or claim, I don’t see any rational basis
 for them to reject the rest of the money.” The State also argued
 that significant evidence was presented to corroborate Vaughn’s
 testimony. 
The State argued that the letters written by Vaughn to
 
Judge Alm were the “same sorts of evidence” as the receipts
 because Vaughn had written the amount of money he had given to
 Faamama. The court agreed with this argument, noting that the
 letters were in writing and that the jury could look at them as
 well. 
The court denied defense counsel’s request, concluding
 
that there was no “rational basis for a reasonable juror” to
 believe that Faamama took less than $20,000 from Vaughn. Defense
 counsel then requested an instruction of Theft in the Fourth
 
8
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Degree, but the court denied the request on the same basis. 
Accordingly, the jury was only instructed on Theft in
 
the First Degree.
 
C. Jury Verdict and Sentencing 
On September 16, 2013, the jury found Faamama guilty of
 
Theft in the First Degree. The Court sentenced Faamama to prison
 
for ten years, ordered him to pay restitution of $158,910.75 to
 Vaughn, and also $105 to the Crime Victim Compensation Fund. 
D. ICA Proceedings
 
Faamama appealed to the ICA, alleging four points of
 
error: (1) the court violated his constitutional right to
 
testify by failing to administer a proper Tachibana colloquy; (2)
 the court erred in failing to instruct the jury on
 lesser-included theft offenses; (3) the DPA committed
 prosecutorial misconduct in his opening statement and closing
 argument; and (4) the court erred in denying his motion for
 judgment of acquittal as there was insufficient evidence in
 support of his conviction. 
In a summary disposition order, the ICA rejected
 
Faamama’s arguments and affirmed the judgment. The ICA held that
 (1) there was ample and compelling evidence to support the jury’s
 verdict finding Faamama guilty of Theft in the First Degree; (2)
 any error in the court’s failure to instruct on lesser-included
 
9
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
theft offenses was harmless; (3) the court engaged in two
 
colloquies with Faamama that both complied with the Tachibana
 requirements, which constituted valid on-the-record waivers by
 Faamama of his right to testify; and (4) the DPA’s remarks in
 opening statement and closing argument did not constitute
 prosecutorial misconduct because they were “reasonable
 inferences” from the evidence that was introduced at trial. 
II. Standards of Review 
B. Jury Instructions
 
“The standard of review for a trial court’s issuance or 
refusal of a jury instruction is whether, when read and considered as a whole, the instructions given are prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading.” State v. 
Kassebeer, 118 Hawai' i 493, 504, 193 P.3d 409, 420 (2008) 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
III. Discussion 
Faamama’s application presents the following questions: 
1. Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that there
was substantial evidence to support Fa 'amama’s 
conviction? 
2. Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that any
error by the Circuit Court in failing to instruct the
jury on the lesser-included theft offenses was
harmless?
 
3. Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that the
Circuit Court complied with the Tachibana requirementsand obtained a valid on-the-record waiver of Fa'amama’s right to testify? 
10
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
4. Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that the
DPA’s remarks in opening statement and closing
arguments did not constitute prosecutorial misconduct?
 
We conclude that the circuit court erred in refusing to
 
instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of Theft in the
 
Second Degree (Theft 2). Accordingly, we vacate Faamama’s
 conviction on this basis and do not address his remaining points
 of error. 
To support a conviction for Theft in the First Degree
 
(Theft 1), the State was required to prove, among other things,
 that Faamama had committed theft of “property or services, the
 value of which exceeds $20,000.” HRS § 708-830.5. 
During the settling of jury instructions, defense
 
counsel asked for a Theft 2 instruction, arguing that “it’s
 possible the jury could believe that the State did not prove that
 [Faamama] took over $20,000 but that [the State] did prove, based
 on the receipts, that [Faamama] did receive $18,000.” The court
 declined to give the instruction, finding that there was not “a
 rational basis for a reasonable juror to acquit of the Theft 1
 and convict only of Theft 2.” The court also rejected defense
 counsel’s proposed instruction on Theft in the Fourth Degree
 (Theft 4) for the same reason. 
Faamama argued to the ICA that the court erred in
 
failing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included theft
 offenses. Passing on that issue, the ICA concluded that any
 
11
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. It noted that
 
Faamama did not present a plausible motive for Vaughn to testify
 falsely or any significant evidence to contradict his testimony,
 and that the State presented evidence that the amount of money
 far exceeded the $20,000 minimum for Theft 1. Accordingly, there
 was “no reasonable possibility that the Circuit Court’s failure
 to instruct the jury on lesser-included theft offenses affected
 the outcome of this case or contributed to Faamama’s first-degree
 theft conviction.” 
Faamama’s application argues that there was a rational
 
basis for a verdict acquitting Faamama of Theft 1 and convicting
 him of the lesser-included offenses, and as such, the court was
 required to give the requested jury instruction. The State
 responds that, based on the record, there “existed no rational
 basis to acquit of the charged offense and to convict [Faamama]
 of any lesser-included theft offense.” 
We agree that there was a rational basis for the jury
 
to acquit Faamama of Theft 1 and find him guilty of Theft 2. 
Further, this failure to instruct the jury on the lesser-included
 offense was not harmless. Accordingly, the judgment of
 conviction as to Theft 1 is vacated and the case remanded for a
 new trial.
 
12
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
A.	 The Circuit Court was Required to Give the Requested Jury
Instruction on the Lesser-Included Offense of Theft 2.
 
The initial question is whether the court erred in 
failing to give the Theft 2 jury instruction. In State v. 
Haanio, we mandated that “trial courts must instruct juries as to any included offenses when ‘there is a rational basis in the evidence for a verdict acquitting the defendant of the offense charged and convicting the defendant of the included offense.’” 94 Hawai' i 405, 413, 16 P.3d 246, 254 (2001) (quoting HRS § 701­
109(5) (1993)), overruled on other grounds by State v. Flores, 131 Hawai' i 43, 314 P.3d 120 (2013). The rationale behind the 
rule is that the public interest is best served by the jury assessing criminal liability if it exists in the evidence. See 
Flores, 131 Hawai' i at 51, 314 P.3d at 128. 
A Theft 1 conviction requires theft “[o]f property or 
services, the value of which exceeds $20,000.” HRS § 708-830.5. A Theft 2 conviction requires theft “[o]f property from the person of another” or “[o]f property or services the value of which exceeds $300.” HRS § 708-831. Here, neither party disputes that Theft 2 is a lesser-included offense of Theft 1. See State v. Stenger, 122 Hawai' i 271, 293, 226 P.3d 441, 463 
(2010); HRS § 701-109(4)(a). 
Because Theft 2 is a lesser-included offense of Theft
 
13
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
1, the critical question is “whether any view of the evidence in
 
this case presented a rational basis for the jury to acquit”
 Faamama of Theft 1, and, alternatively, to convict him of Theft
 2. Flores, 131 Hawai' i at 53, 314 P.3d at 130 (emphasis added). 
The difference between Theft 1 and Theft 2, as charged in this case, is the value of what was stolen. Theft 1 involves theft exceeding $20,000, while Theft 2 involves theft exceeding $300. Compare HRS § 708-830.5 with HRS § 708-831. 
In this case, the court should have given a Theft 2
 
instruction. At trial, Vaughn testified that he gave Faamama
 somewhere between $134,560 and $164,000. This amount was
 established primarily through Exhibits 18B, 18C, 18D, 18E, and
 18F, which were spreadsheets reflecting all of the money that
 Vaughn said he gave to Faamama. 
However, there is a lack of direct evidence
 
corroborating Vaughn’s testimony that he gave Faamama amounts
 totaling over $20,000. Vaughn testified that he would give
 Faamama cash by writing checks out to “cash,” except for one
 check in the amount of $500. Moreover, Vaughn did not write
 anything in the notation section of the checks and did not start
 generating receipts until the “very end,” after his wife told him
 that he should do so. Only four receipts were created by Vaughn
 and signed by Faamama, which were introduced by the State as
 
14
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Exhibit 12. Adding the four receipts to the $500 check that was
 
written out to Faamama results in a total of $19,175––$825 less
 than the $20,000 required for a Theft 1 conviction.
 
On cross-examination, Vaughn testified that he did not
 
keep an accounting of the money he gave to Faamama. Vaughn also
 admitted that he had taken out thousands of dollars during the
 charged period for his personal use. He could not specify which
 amounts were for personal use and which he gave to Faamama. 
“Because the jury was the exclusive judge of the value 
of evidence and credibility of witnesses, it had the ultimate discretion to decide to what extent a witness should be believed and whether to discredit testimony.” Stenger, 122 Hawai' i at 
295, 226 P.3d at 465 (internal quotation marks omitted). On this record, a juror could rationally have chosen not to believe, beyond a reasonable doubt, that all of the transactions had occurred. A juror could have decided to credit the receipts that were signed by Faamama, as well the check written out to him, but have a reasonable doubt as to the validity of the amounts that did not have similar corroboration. Accordingly, a juror would have a rational basis in the evidence to acquit Faamama of Theft 1, and convict him of Theft 2. 
In its decision to deny giving the Theft 2 instruction,
 
the court reasoned that the two letters Vaughn wrote to Judge Alm
 
15
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
were the “same sorts of evidence” as the receipts. However, the
 
receipts were signed by Faamama, whereas the letters were not. A
 juror could have found that Vaughn’s stated amounts in the
 letters––$56,000 and $60,000––were not credible.
 
The State argues that this case is similar to State v. 
Nichols, 111 Hawai' i 327, 141 P.3d 974 (2006), and State v. 
Sneed, 68 Haw. 463, 718 P.2d 280 (1986). In both cases, we upheld the court’s decision to not give a lesser-included offense instruction. Neither case is analogous to the instant case. 
In Nichols, whether the defendant should have been 
convicted of first or second degree terroristic threatening hinged on whether the accused acted with the requisite state of mind with respect to the attendant circumstance of “public servant.” 111 Hawai' i at 327, 141 P.3d at 974. The only 
evidence regarding “public servant” came from an officer’s uncontradicted testimony that: (1) in the course of his official duties as a police officer, he had been involved in a confrontation with the defendant; and (2) the defendant made a statement that indicated he knew that he was threatening a police officer. Id. at 342, 141 P.3d at 989. Accordingly, the “only 
rational inference that could be drawn . . . is that [the defendant] knew that he was threatening a police officer.” Id. 
In contrast, the evidence presented at trial would
 
16
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
allow another rational inference to be drawn--that Faamama had
 
committed theft, but not in an amount in excess of $20,000. This
 is distinguishable from Nichols, where there was no other
 evidence presented on the question of whether the defendant knew
 he was threatening a police officer. 
In Sneed, the defendant, who had been found guilty of
 
Theft 1, argued that the court committed plain error by failing
 to instruct the jury as to lesser-included theft offenses. See
 
68 Haw. at 463, 718 P.2d at 280. We held that since the only
 defense advanced by the defendant was a “flat denial” of
 committing theft, there would not have been a factual basis in
 the evidence for the jury to acquit on Theft 1, but convict on
 lesser-included theft offenses. Id. at 464, 718 P.2d at 281. In
 
contrast here, the State presented direct physical evidence––four
 receipts signed by Faamama and a check written out to
 Faamama––that corroborated $19,175 of Vaughn’s alleged losses.
 The State did not present similar evidence to substantiate the
 additional losses claimed by Vaughn. Therefore, unlike Sneed,
 there was a rational basis for a verdict acquitting Faamama of
 Theft 1 and convicting him of Theft 2.
4

 Faamama also argues that the court should have given a Theft 4 
instruction, which involves theft not in excess of $100.  See HRS § 708-833 
(2014).  We disagree, insofar as there was not a rational basis in theevidence for a verdict acquitting Faamama of Theft 1 and convicting him ofTheft 4.  See Haanio , 94 Hawai 'i at 413, 16 P.3d at 254.  The State introduced 
(continued...)
 
17
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Accordingly, the court was required to give the 
requested jury instruction. See Stenger, 122 Hawai' i at 295-96, 
226 P.3d at 465-66. 
B.	 The ICA was Incorrect to Conclude that the Circuit Court’s
 
Failure to Instruct on Theft 2 was Harmless Beyond a
Reasonable Doubt.
 
The ICA concluded that any error in the court’s failure
 
to instruct on lesser-included theft offenses was harmless beyond
 
a reasonable doubt because there was no reasonable possibility
 that it affected the outcome of the case. We respectfully
 disagree. 
In Flores, this court overruled the portion of Haanio 
holding that an error in failing to instruct on a lesser-included offense was always harmless when the jury convicted of the charged offense. See Flores, 131 Hawai' i at 44, 314 P.3d at 121. 
We noted that holding such errors harmless as a matter of law is inconsistent with the function of the jury in rendering an accurate verdict and upholding the “truth seeking function of the judicial system.” Id. at 56, 314 P.3d at 133 (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted). 
In Flores, we pointed out that when jury instructions
 
4(...continued)
Exhib
it 12, which showed four receipts, generated by Vaughn and signed by
Faamama, in the amount of approximately $18,000.  The State also introduced
 
Exhibit 18A, a check written by Vaughn to Faamama in the amount of $500. 
18
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
or their omission are at issue on appeal, “the standard of review 
is whether, when read and considered as a whole, the instructions given are prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent or misleading.” Id. at 57-58, 314 P.3d at 134-35 (quoting State v. 
Sawyer, 88 Hawai' i 325, 329, 966 P.2d 637, 641 (1998)). Since 
the instructions in Flores did not include the lesser-included offense, they were thus insufficient. See Flores, 131 Hawai' i at 
58, 314 P.3d at 135. Similarly here, the court’s jury instructions in this case were prejudicially insufficient, inasmuch as they did not include the lesser-included offense of Theft 2. 
The effect of not giving the lesser-included offense
 
instruction was to force the jury to choose between two options,
 conviction of Theft 1, or acquittal. It is precisely this “all
 or nothing” strategy that was rejected in Flores:
 
Holding such errors harmless perpetuates the risk that
the jury in any given case did not actually reach the
result that best conforms with the facts, because the
jury was only presented with two options—guilty of the
charged offense or not guilty—when in fact, the
evidence may admit of an offense of lesser magnitude
than the charged offense.
 
131 Hawai' i at 56, 314 P.3d at 133. 
Accordingly, because there was a rational basis for the
 
jury to acquit Faamama of Theft 1 and to find him guilty of Theft
 
2, his conviction must be vacated. See id. at 58, 314 P.3d at
 
135 (“The failure to instruct the jury on a lesser included
 
19
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
offense for which the evidence provides a rational basis warrants
 
vacation of the defendant’s conviction.”). 
IV. Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, the circuit court erred in
 
failing to instruct the jury on Theft in the Second Degree, and
 this error was not harmless. 
Accordingly, the ICA’s April 22,
 
2016 judgment on appeal and the circuit court’s December 4, 2013
 judgment of conviction as to Theft in the First Degree are
 vacated, and the case is remanded to the circuit court for a new
 trial.
