OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J. 
This appeal  arises from a challenge by Ritalynn Moss 
Celestine to her conviction based on the validity of her waiver 
of the right to testify
 at trial.  We hold that the record does 
not support a conclusion that Celestine’s waiver of the right to 
testify was voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly made.

 vacate the conviction and remand  the case for further 
proceedings. 
I. BACKGROUND  
 
 On February 24, 2013, around 2:40 a.m., an officer of 
the Honolulu Police Department driving along Meheula Parkway saw 
Celestine’s vehicle in the “planter area.”1  It appeared to  the 
officer that the vehicle had jumped the curb.  After Celestine 
exited her vehicle, the officer noticed a strong odor of alcohol 
emitting from Celestine ’s breath  and that her eyes were red, 
bloodshot, and glassy.  The officer requested that Celestine 
perform three field sobriety tests.  According to the responding 
officer, Celestine demonstrated clues suggesting intoxication on 
all three tests
, and she was subsequently placed under arrest.2   
At the police station, an officer read Celestine the 
implied consent form for testing, which p
rovided, inter alia, as 
follows: “if you refuse to submit to a breath, blood or urine 
test, you shall be subject to up to 30 days imprisonment and/or 
a fine of up to a thousand dollars.”  Celestine refused the 
blood test but opted to take the breath test.  About 3:15 a.m., 
                     
 1 Celestine explained to the officer that her GPS had led her there 
and that she was looking for Makapipipi Street.   
 2 The officer acknowledged that it is possible to fail the field 
sobriety tests without being under the influence of alcohol or drugs and that 
the tests provide “clues” to further the investigation.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 Celestine underwent an Intoxilyzer 8000 breath test.  
Celestine’s breath alcohol content was 0.098 grams of alcohol 
per 210 liters of breath.   
A. District Court Proceedings 
On March 12, 2013, Celestine was charged by complaint 
in the District Court of the First Circuit (district court) with 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant in 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1)3 
and/or (a)(3).4  Celestine pleaded not guilty to the charge.   
  At trial,5 prior to the presentation of evidence,  the 
district court advised Celestine as follows:  
THE COURT: Okay.  Miss Celestine, to advise you of 
your rights at trial, at some point in time the State will 
rest, okay, and you ’ll have an opportunity to testify or 
remain silent.  Should you choose to remain silent, the 
                     
 3 HRS § 291E -61(a)(1) ( Supp. 2012) provides as follows:  
A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under 
the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or 
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:  
. . .  
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount 
sufficient to impair the person’s  normal mental faculties 
or ability to care for the person and guard against 
casualty[.]   
 4 HRS § 291E -61(a)(3) ( Supp. 2012) provides as follows: “A person 
commits the offense of operating a vehicle under the influence of an 
intoxicant if the person operates or assumes actual physical control of a 
vehicle: . . . [w]ith .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters 
of breath.”   
 5 The Honorable Lono J. Lee presided.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 Court can infer no guilt because of your silence.  
Basically, you’ ll be invoking your Fifth Amendment right 
against self -incrimination.   
 
Okay, you understand?  
 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.  
 
THE COURT: However, if you do wish to testify, you 
need to be s worn in, you’ re also subject to  cross-
examination by the State’ s attorney.  Okay?  
 
THE DEFENDANT[6]: Okay.  And when the State does rest, 
okay, I’ ll remind you again, okay, I have to finish this 
even though  we’re doing this piece -- piecemeal today.  All 
right.  Any questions?  Okay.  Thank you.  
After the State rested,7 the defense advised the court 
that it would not be presenting evidence.  The court then 
proceeded with the Tachibana colloquy: 
THE COURT: Okay.  For defense case, okay, Miss Moss 
Celestine?  
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.  
THE COURT: Okay.  Just in caution, okay, I had 
explained to you, okay, on the 12th that you had the right 
to testify and the right to remain silent, okay.  They call 
this your Tachibana rights.  It ’s based on a case law that 
the appellate court found that the trial court needed to 
inform you of your rights, okay.  If you chose not to 
testify, the Court could infer no guilt because of your 
silence; basically you would be invoking your Fifth 
Amendment right against self -incrimination.  Okay.  On the 
other hand, if you do wish to testify, you need to be sworn 
in, you also will be subject to  cross-examination by the 
State’s attorney. 
Okay.  Your attorney just indicated to the  Court that 
you will not be testifying.  Is that correct?  
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.  
                     
 6 It appears this statement was made by the district court and 
incorrectly attributed to Celestine in the transcript of the proceedings.  
 7 The State’s evidence included the events described in the 
introductory paragraphs of the Background section, see supra. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
5 
 THE COURT: Okay.  Is anybody forcing you not to 
testify?  
THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.  
THE COURT: Okay.  It’s your own decision?  
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.  
THE COURT: Okay, very goo d . . . . 
Following the colloquy, th e district court heard Celestine’s  
motion to suppress her breath test results, which the court 
denied.   
The 
district court found Celestine guilty as charged 
under HRS § 291E- 61(a)(1) and HRS § 291E- 61(a)(3) and imposed 
sentence.8  Celestine timely filed a n otice of a ppeal to the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) .   
B. ICA Proceedings   
In her 
opening brief, Celestine set forth two points 
of error: (1) the district court erred in denying her motion to 
suppress, and (2) the district court violated her constitutional 
right to testify when it failed to conduct a proper Tachibana  
colloquy.  The State responded that the court’s  Tachibana  
colloquy was adequate and that, in the alternative, any error 
was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.    
                     
8 The district court sentenced Celestine to the following: pay a 
fine in the amount of $500; pay fees totaling $162; participate in a 14 -hour 
substance abuse rehabilitation program; and participate in a substance abuse 
assessment and treatment program if necessary.  The district court further 
ordered that Celestine’s license be r evoked for a period of one year.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
6 
   In a summary disposition order, the ICA affirmed 
Celestine’s conviction .9  The ICA concluded  that the district 
court’s end-of-trial Tachibana  colloquy was adequate and that 
Celestine’s waiver of the right to testify was validly made.10   
Chief Judge Nakamura dissented, concluding that the 
district court erred by failing to adequately advise Celestine 
that if she wanted to testify, no one could prevent her from 
doing so.  Because Celestine did not testify at trial, the 
dissent concluded that the error was not harmless. 
  
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
  The validity of a defendant’s waiver in a criminal 
case of the right to testify is a question of constitutional law 
reviewed by this court under the right/wrong standard.  See 
State v. Gomez- Lobato, 130 Hawaiʻi 465, 468-69, 312 P.3d 897, 
900-01 (2013).  
III.  DISCUSSION  
Hawaiʻi law has historically protected both the right 
to testify and the right not to testify.  State v. Monteil , 134 
                     
 9 The ICA’s summary disposition order can be found at State v. 
Celestine , No. CAAP -14-0000335, 2016 WL 3573992 (Haw. App. June 29, 2016) 
(SDO). 
 10 The ICA also concluded that it need not resolve whether the 
district court erred in denying Celestine’s motion to suppress the breath 
test results because the district court’s finding of guilt under HRS § 291E -
61(a)(1) (impairment of driver’s mental faculties or abilities while under 
the influence of alcohol) could independently serve as a basis for the 
conviction in this case.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
7 
 Hawaiʻi 361, 369, 341 P.3d 567, 575 (2014).  The right to testify 
is guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments  to the United 
States Constitution;  the Hawaiʻi Constitution’s parallel 
guarantees under a rticle I, sections 5, 10, and 14;  and HRS § 
801-2.  State v. Pomroy , 132 Hawaiʻ i 85, 91, 319 P.3d 1093, 1099 
(2014).  The right not to testify is guaranteed by the United 
States Constitution ’s Fifth Amendment guarantee against 
compelled testimony and the Hawai ʻi Constitution ’s parallel 
guarantee under a rticle I, section 10.  Monteil , 134 Hawaiʻi at 
369, 341 P.3d at 575. 
To protect the fundamental right to testify, this 
court in Tachibana v. State established 
the requirement that 
when a defendant in a criminal case indicates an intention not 
to testify, the trial court must advise the defendant of the 
right to testify and must obtain an on- the-record waiver of this  
right.  79 Hawai ʻi 226, 236, 900 P.2d 1293,  1303 (1995) 
(footnotes omitted).  An on-the-record waiver assures that the 
defendant is “aware of [the] right to testify and that [the 
defendant] knowingly and voluntarily waive[s] that right.”  Id. 
at 234-37, 900 P.2d at 1301-04 .  The Tachibana  court also 
determined that “the ideal time to conduct  the colloquy is  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
8 
 immediately prior to the close of the defendant’s case .”11  Id. 
at 237, 900 P.2d at 1304.  
  There are two components of  a Tachibana  colloquy.  The 
first is informing the defendant of fundamental principles 
pertaining to the right to testify and the right not to testify.  
Id. at 236 n.7, 900 P.2d at 1303 n.7.  We stated that this 
advisement should consist of the following information:  
that he [or she] has a right to testify, that if he [or 
she] wants to testify that no one can prevent him [or her] 
from doing so, [and] that if he [or she] testifies the 
prosecution will be allowed to cross -examine him [or her].  
In connection with the privile ge against self -
incrimination, the defendant should also be advised that he 
[or she] has a right not to testify and that if he [or she] 
does not testify then the jury can be instructed about that 
right. 
Id. (alterations in original) (citation omitted). 
  T he second component of the Tachibana  colloquy 
involves the court engaging in a true “colloquy”  with the 
defendant.  State v. Han , 130 Hawai i 83, 90 -91, 306 P.3d 128, 
135-36 (2013).  This portion of the colloquy consists of a 
verbal exchange between the ju dge and the defendant “in which 
                     
 11 In addition to requiring a Tachibana colloquy when a defendant 
has indicated an intent not to testify, we stated that trial courts must 
conduct a pretrial advisement in which the defendant is informed of his or 
her personal right to testify or not to testify; alert the defendant that if 
he or she has not testified by the end of trial, the court will question the 
defendant to ensure it was his or her own decision not to testify; and advise 
the defendant that the exercise of the right not to testify may not be used 
by the factfinder against the defendant.  State v. Lewis , 94 Hawai i 292, 297, 
12 P.3d 1233, 1238 (2000); Monteil, 134 Hawai i at 373, 341 P.3d at 579.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
9 
 the judge ascertains the defendant’s understanding  of the 
proceedings and of the defendant’s rights.”  Id. at 90, 306 P.3d 
at 135 (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary  300 (9th ed. 2009)).   
  The verbal  exchange is to ensure that the information 
conveyed by the judge has been understood by the defendant and 
that the defendant’ s decision not to testify has been made with 
an understanding of the defendant’s rights .  Id. at  90-91, 306 
P.3d at 135- 36 (“[T]he transcript does  not indicate that a true 
‘colloquy’ took place.  Instead, the court simply advised 
Petitioner of his rights, without any ‘discussion, ’ ‘exchange ’ 
or ascertainment that Petitioner understood his rights. ”); 
Pomroy, 132 Hawai ʻi at 93, 319 P.3d at 1101 (holding that the 
Tachibana  colloquy was “defective” in part because the district 
court merely “recited a litany of rights” and then asked the 
defendant “if he ‘understood that,’” without clarifying  “which 
right ‘that’ referenced” ).   
To accomplish the purposes of a  true colloquy , we have 
suggested that the trial court engage in a verbal exchange with 
the defendant at least twice during the colloquy in order to 
ascertain the defendant’s “ understanding of significant 
propositions in the advisement.”  Han, 130 Hawaii at 90, 306 
P.3d at 135.  The first time is  after the court informs  the 
defendant of the right to testify and of the right not to ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
10 
 testify and the protections associated with these rights.  Id.   
The purpose of this exchange is for the court to ascertain the 
defendant’s understanding of these important principles.  
  The second time we suggested a verbal exchange should 
occur is after the court indicates to the defendant its 
understanding that the defendant does not intend to testify.12  
Id. at 91, 306 P.3d at 136.  This inquiry enables the court 
to 
determine whether the defendant’s decision to not testify is 
made with an understanding of the principles that have been 
explained to the defendant.  Id.  As part of this inquiry, the 
trial court elicits responses as to whether the defendant 
intends to not testify, whether anyone  is forcing the defendant 
not to testify,  and whether the decision to not testify is  the 
defendant’s.  Id.   
The constitutiona l right to testify is violated when 
the Tachibana colloquy is inadequate to provide an “objective 
basis” for finding the defendant “knowingly, intelligently, and 
voluntarily” relinquished his or her right  to testify.  Id.  In 
determining whether a waiver of the right to testify was 
                     
 12 The fact that the court is conducting the Tachibana colloquy with 
the defendant generally indicates that defense counsel has informed the court 
that the defendant does not intend to testify.  See Lewis, 94 Hawai i at 296 -
97, 12 P.3d at 1237 -38 (“[W]e hold the court need not engage in a Tachibana  
colloquy except where the defendant has indicated that he or she will not 
testify[.]”). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
11 
 voluntarily and intelligently made , this court looks  to the 
totality of the facts and circumstances of each particular case.  
Id. at 89, 306 P.3d at 134.  
In this case, the Tachibana  colloquy was deficient 
because the district court did not adequately fulfill the second 
component of the Tachibana  colloquy.  
A. The District Court Did Not Engage Celestine I n A True Colloquy 
Celestine argues that the district court’s 
Tachibana  
colloquy was defective because the district court failed to 
engage in a true exchange with her.13  As discussed, b eyond 
advising defendants of the rights afforded to them, a court must 
engage defendants in a true colloquy to ascertain whether the 
defendant understands  the right to testify and the right not to 
testify and whether the decision not to testify is made with an 
understanding of the se rights.   Han, 130 Hawaiʻi at 90- 91, 306 
P.3d at 135-36.   
                     
 13 Citing the ICA dissent, Celestine reasserts  in her application 
for a writ of certiorari that the Tachibana  colloquy was prejudicially 
inadequate because the district court failed to advise her that if she wanted 
to testify, no one could prevent her from doing so.  See State v. Eduwensuyi  
141 Hawai i 328, 409 P.3d 732, 737- 38 (2018) (discussing the significance of 
this advisement in the Tachibana colloquy).  Our disposition in this case  
renders it unnecessary to  address this omission in the colloquy  as an 
independent ground for vacating Celestine’s conviction .   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
12 
   The first time the district court should have engaged 
in a verbal exchange to ascertain  Celestine ’s understanding  was 
after the court advised her of the following principles:  
Just in caution, okay, I had explained to you, okay, on the 
12th that you had the right to testify and the right to 
remain silent, okay.  They call this your Tachibana rights.  
It’s based on a ca se law that the appellate court found 
that the trial court needed to inform you of your rights, 
okay.  If you chose not to testify, the Court could infer 
no guilt because of your silence; basically you would be 
invoking your Fifth Amendment right against self-
incrimination.  Okay.  On the other hand, if you do wish to 
testify, you need to be sworn in, you also will be subject 
to cross -examination by the State’s attorney.  
Instead of ascertaining at this juncture of the colloquy whether 
Celestine understood the fundamental principles stated , the 
court simply proceeded with the advisement.  Han, 130 Hawai i at 
90-91, 306 P.3d at 135-36.   
  In Han , the family court informed  the defendant  that 
he had a right to testify, that no one could force him to 
testify, that he ha
d a “right to remain silent,” and that if he 
exercised his right to remain silent the jury would be 
instructed not to hold it against him.  Id.
 at 90, 306 P.3d at 
135.  We determined that the court should have obtained a 
response from the defendant as to his understanding of these 
principles.  Id.  at 90-91, 306 P.3d at 135- 36.  Instead, the 
court “simply continued on with the advisement.”  Id. at 91, 306 
P.3d at 136.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
13 
   Similarly, in Pomroy , we held that the district court 
did not engage in a discussion or exchange with the defendant to 
ascertain his understanding of his right to testify and his 
right not to testify.  132 Hawaii at 94, 319 P.3d at 1102.  W e 
reasoned in part that “the district court recit ed a litany of 
rights” and then asked the defendant if he “understood that” 
without clarifying “which right ‘that’ referenced.”  Id. at 93, 
319 P.3d at 1101.   
  Thus, as in Han and Pomroy, the district court in this 
case simply advised Celestine of her rights without any 
discussion or exchange to “ascertain[] the defendant’s 
understanding of the proceedings and of the defendant’s rights.”  
Han, 130 Hawai i at 90, 306 P.3d at 135 (emphasis omitted);14 
accord Pomroy , 132 Hawai i at 94, 319 P.3d at 1102.   
                     
 14 The dissent interprets the Han decision as having been dependent 
on the presence of a salient fact.  Dissent at 3- 4.  The decision clearly 
indicates otherwise.  In part VI I-A of the opinion, this court concluded that 
“the transcript does not indicate that a true ‘ colloquy ’ took place.”  Han, 
130 Hawai i at 90, 306 P.3d at 135.  We then held, after examining the 
colloquy, that the  “failure to ensure that Petitioner understood his rights 
amounts to a failure to obtain the on -the-record waiver required by 
Tachibana.”  Id.  at 91, 306 P.3d at 136.  The Han court thus  concluded that 
the trial court did not have “an objective basis for finding ” that Han 
validly waived his rights.  Id.  Only after reaching this conclusion in Part 
VII-A of the opinion did we then go on to consider the salient fact  of a 
language barrier.  In Part VII-B of the opinion, we noted that the presence 
of a salient fact “ underscores the importance of the court’s colloquy as a 
procedural safeguard that protects a defendant’s right to testify  or to not 
testify. ”  Id. at 92, 306 P.3d at 137.  Moreover, we determined that the 
presence of a salient fact--the defendant’s need for an interpreter --only 
made the court’s error  in failing to ensure Han’s understanding  “more 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
14 
   T he second time the district court should have engaged 
in a verbal exchange with Celestine to ascertain her 
understanding was after the court stated the following:  “Your 
attorney just indicated to the Court that you will not be 
testifying.  Is that correct?”   Celestine’s response of “Yes, 
sir” to the court’s question  does not indicate whether she was 
expressing that she did not wish to testify or merely confirming 
that her attorney had just told the court she would not be 
testifying.  See
 Han, 130 Hawai i at 91, 306 P.3d at 136 (holding 
that although the defendant responded “Yes” to the court’s 
statement that “[t]he decision not to testify is yours and  yours 
alone after you have discussed the matter with your attorney,”  
it was unclear if the defendant was responding “Yes” --that he 
understood the decision was his alone, or “Yes”--that he had 
discussed the matter with his attorney).  
  The remainder of the d istrict court’s Tachibana 
colloquy only consisted of the following:   
THE COURT: Is anybody forcing you not to testify?  
THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.  
                                                                               
(. . . continued)  
 
egregious.”  Id.  (emphasis added).  The salient fact therefore only 
exacerbated the trial court’s failure.  Id.  Hence, the dissent incorrectly 
contends that Han  is distinguishable because there was no  showing of a 
salient fact that might have prevented Celestine from understanding the 
court’s advisements.  Dissent at 10.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
15 
 THE COURT: Okay.  It’s your own decision?  
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.  
THE COURT: Okay, very good  . . . . 
Celestine’s “No” response to the court’s inquiry of whether 
anyone was forcing her not to testify does not indicate that she 
understood she had a constitutional right to testify, only that 
no one was forcing her not to testify.  See Han,  130 Hawaii at 
91, 306 P.3d at 136 (holding that the defendant’s “No” response 
to the court’s inquiry as to whether anyone was threatening or 
forcing him not to testify did not demonstrate his understanding 
of his right to testify).  And the final question ( “It’s your 
own decision?”)  does not cure the inadequacy in the court’s 
colloquy as the court “did not inquire into other matters of 
constitutional magnitude .”  Id.   
  T he district court thus did not engage in a sufficient 
verbal exchange with Celestine to ascertain whether her waiver 
of the right to testify was based on her understanding of the 
principles related by the district court.15  Because the court’s 
                     
 15 Our decision is not intended to establish that the verbal 
exchange must occur at specific junctures in the colloquy.  A trial court  is 
required, however, to engage the defendant in a true colloquy to ascertain 
the defendant’s understanding of the significant rights stated and to ensure 
that the defendant’s decision not to testify is made with an understanding of 
these rights.  Han , 130 Hawai i at 90-91, 306 P.3d at 135 -36.  This approach 
is not mere formalism as asserted by the dissent.  Dissent at  6.  Rather, it 
enables a court to establish a record that demonstrates a knowing, 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
16 
 colloquy with Celestine was deficient as to this essential 
requirement, the record does not demonstrate that Celestine’s 
waiver of the right to testify was knowingly, intelligently, and 
voluntarily made.16  See Han, 130 Hawaii at 91-93, 306 P.3d at 
136-38.  The ICA erred in concluding to the contrary. 
B. The District Court’s Error W as Not Harmless Beyond A 
Reasonable Doubt 
 
 The Tachibana colloquy
 in this case was deficient  
because the district court did not engage in a true colloquy 
with Celestine to ascertain her understanding of the 
constitutional principles stated and to ensure that Celestine’s 
decision not to testify was made with an understanding of the se 
principles.17

intelligent, and voluntary waiver of the right to testify.  Han, 130 Hawai i 
at 90-91, 306 P.3d at 135 -36.   
 16 The dissent relies on the pretrial advisement that was conducted 
five days before the Tachibana colloquy to “mitigate” the error in this case 
and to thus support the conclusion that Celestine’s waiver of the right  to 
testify was made knowingly and voluntarily.  Dissent at  10.  However, the 
pretrial advisement not only omitted the advisory that was also absent from 
the Tachibana colloquy--that if Celestine wanted to testify no one could 
prevent her from doing so--but the dissent’s assumption of mitigation is also 
inconsistent with our rejection of an approach that “treats all defendants 
alike in terms of their ability to understand and recall the initial 
advisory.”  State v. Eduwensuyi , 141 Hawai i 328, 409 P.3d 732,  739 (2018).   
 17 More than twenty years ago , the Tachibana  court concluded that 
the colloquy requirement “will best protect defendants’ rights while 
maintaining the integrity of the criminal justice system.”  Tachibana , 79 
Hawaii at 234, 900 P.2d at 1301.   In so concluding, the Tachibana court 
stated that trial courts “must obtain an on -the-record waiver of that right

   “Once a violation of the constitutional right to 
testify is established, the conviction must be vacated unless 
the State can prove that the violation was harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt.”  Pomroy, 132 Hawai i at 94, 319 P.3d at 1102 
(quoting Tachibana , 79 Hawai i at 240, 900 P.2d at 1307).  The 
relevant question “is whether there is a reasonable possibility  
that [the] error might have  contributed to [the] conviction.”  
Han, 130 Hawai i at 93, 306 P.3d at 138 (quoting State v.  
Schnabel , 127 Hawai i 432, 450, 279 P.3d 1237, 1255 (2012)).  
From our review of the record, we cannot conclude that the 
district court’s error was harmless because it is not knowable 
whether Celestine’s testimony, had she given it,  could have 
established reasonable doubt that she operated a vehicle under 
the influence of an intoxicant in violation of HRS § 291E-

in every case in which the defendant does not testify.”  Id. at 236, 900 P.2d 
at 1303.  A  trial court’s failure to engage in a true verbal exchan ge with 
the defendant to ensure  the defendant understood his or her rights amounts to 
a failure to obtain the on -the-record waiver that Tachibana  requires.  Han, 
130 Hawai i at 91, 306 P.3d at 136.  When the Tachibana  colloquy is inadequate 
to provide an “objective basis” for finding the defendant “knowingly, 
intelligently, and voluntarily” relinquished the right to testify, the 
constitutional right to testify is violated.   State v. Eduwensuyi , 141 Hawai i 
328, 409 P.3d 732, 737 (2018)  (quoting Han, 130 Hawai i at 91, 306 P.3d at 
136). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 61(a)(1).18  See Pomroy, 132 Hawai i at 94, 319 P.3d at 1102.  
Thus, Celestine’s conviction under HRS § 291E- 61(a)(1) must be 
vacated.19   
IV. CONCLUSION  
Based on the foregoing, the ICA’s July 26, 2016 
Judgment on Appeal and the district court’s September 17, 2013 
and December 17, 2013 Notices of Entry of Judgment and/or Order 
and Plea/Judgment are vacated,  and the case is remand ed to the 
district court for further proceedings.

 18 At trial, the responding officer testified to the following: 
Celestine explained to him that her GPS had led her to where her vehicle was 
discovered; it is possible to fail the field sobriety tests without being 
under the influence of alcohol or drugs; and  the tests provide only “clues” 
to further the investigation.   
 19 Celestine was also convicted under HRS § 291E -61(a)(3) based on 
the results of her breath test.  Pursuant to State v. Won , 137 Hawai i 330, 
372 P.3d 1065 (2015), Celestine’s conviction unde r HRS § 291E -61(a)(3) must 
also be vacated.  See Won, 137 Hawai i at 349, 355 n.49, 372 P.3d at 1084, 
1090 n.49 (holding that because “the threat of criminal sanctions inherently 
precludes a finding of voluntariness,” the defendant’s consent to a breath 
test was not voluntary and therefore the district court erred in not 
suppressing the results of the defendant’s breath test).
