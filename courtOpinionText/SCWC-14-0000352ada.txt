RECKTENWALD, C.J., McKENNA, POLLACK, AND WILSON, JJ., AND
CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE CHANG, IN PLACE OF NAKAYAMA, J., RECUSED 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J. 
This case addresses whether the Hawai ʻi State Ethics 
Commission (Commission) had authority to adjudicate proceedings 
against a charter school employee for conduct that occurred in 2006 and 2007 involving alleged conflict of interest violations 
of the code of ethics contained in Chapter 84 of the Hawai ʻi  
  
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Revised Statutes (HRS). We conclude that HRS § 84-14 (1993), prescribing a code of conduct related to conflicts of interests for State employees, and HRS Chapter 302B (Supp. 2006 & 2007) (repealed 2012), encompassing comprehensive provisions that 
provided for charter schools to establish conflict of interest 
policies and procedures, resulted in conflicting statutory regimes for charter school employees as to standards of conduct involving conflicts of interests. In light of the inconsistency between these State laws, we hold that, in accordance with HRS § 302B-9(a) (Supp. 2006 & 2007) (repealed 2012), charter school employees were exempt from HRS § 84-14 at the relevant time period in this case. Accordingly, the Commission did not 
have the authority to adjudicate proceedings against William 
Boyd, a charter school employee, for alleged violations of HRS § 84-14 that occurred in 2006 and 2007. We therefore vacate the judgments of the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) and the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (circuit court) and the order of the Commission that sustained the violations against Boyd, and we remand the case to the Commission with instructions to dismiss the case. 
I. BACKGROUND 
At the time of the alleged ethics violations in this 
case, Connections New Century Public Charter School 
2 
 
  
   
                     
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(Connections) was governed by HRS Chapter 302B, which set forth comprehensive legislation authorizing flexibility and independent authority to charter schools in implementing alternative frameworks with respect to personnel management and 
the day-to-day functioning of a charter school.
1 See HRS § 302B -
1 (Supp. 2006 & 2007) (repealed 2012). 
Charter schools, such as 
Connections, operated independently and separately from public 
schools under Chapter 302B but were linked to the State Department of Education and Board of Education primarily for administrative purposes. 
See, e.g. , HRS § 302B-8 (Supp. 2006 & 
2007) (repealed 2012) (stating the charter school administrative office shall be attached to the Department of Education “for 
administrative purposes only”); HRS § 302B-15 (Supp. 2006 & 
2007) (repealed 2012) (setting forth the responsibilities of the Department of Education with respect to charter schools and special education services at charter schools). 
Connections’ Local School Board, comprised mainly of 
community representatives, served as Connections’ centralized governing authority responsible for the administration of the school. 
See HRS § 302B-7(a), (c) (Supp. 2006 & 2007) (repealed 
2012). The Local School Board was in charge of financial

Chapter 302D.

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
oversight and decision-making regarding State general funds and 
federal funds allocated to the school as well as the hiring and firing of charter school employees. See id. According to 
Connections’ Principal John Thatcher, the Local School Board 
essentially directed him as to how he should manage the school. 
A. Connections’ Internal Policies and Procedures 
During the pertinent time period in this case, 
Connections, with the assistance of its hired auditors, 
developed and followed its own internal checks-and-balances procedures with respect to procuring school supplies, materials, and other equipment. The purchasing procedure incorporated the use of a purchase order form that Connections’ administrators 
had developed. The purchase order form required the following 
information: (1) the name and title of the individual making the request (requestor); (2) the name, address, and telephone number of the individual or entity from whom the materials could be purchased (vendor); (3) the school materials desired, including the quantity and pricing; and (4) the name(s) and title(s) of the individual(s) approving the request. 
Any employee of Connections could make a request by 
listing the vendor’s information on the purchasing form and then submitting the form to an authorized school official for approval. The approval process included reviewing the 
4 
 
  
   
                     
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
information on the form, checking the school’s inventory to 
ensure that the school did not have the requested materials, and checking with vendors to find the best prices for the requested materials. Principal Thatcher was required to approve all 
purchase requests. When Principal Thatcher was not available to 
give his approval, William Boyd or Sandra Kelley, as administrative officials at Connections, were authorized to preliminarily approve purchase orders in order to enable expedited purchases, but all preliminary approvals were subject to final approval by Principal Thatcher. If the purchase involved Title 1 funds, the purchase also required review and approval by the Title 1 Coordinator.
2 Additionally, Principal 
Thatcher explained that the Local School Board, through its finance committee, could review his final approval of the purchase order requests. 
As an employee of Connections, Boyd was also 
authorized to submit purchase order requests. On several occasions during the 2006-2007 school year, Boyd prepared, signed as requestor, or preliminarily approved various purchase order forms for requested school materials. With respect to a 
2 “Title 1 funds” refer to “federal monies provided to schools with
a high level of poverty, and such funds may be used to supplement the
school’s instructional program.” 
5 
 
  
  
  
                     
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
handful of forms, Boyd listed his wife, Erika Boyd (Mrs. Boyd), 
as the requestor and/or the vendor. On two of the forms, Principal Thatcher approved the purchase order by signing his name under the heading “Approved.” On all the other forms, Boyd 
preliminarily approved the request, usually at the direction of 
Principal Thatcher, and then Principal Thatcher later reviewed and authorized the order by initialing the form. For some of the purchase order forms in which Mrs. Boyd was listed as the vendor, a Connections’ teacher was the requestor, and Boyd preliminarily approved the order. The school materials listed on the forms at issue were sold to Connections through Mrs. Boyd and fulfilled by an Amway distributorship co-owned by Boyd and 
his wife (Amway Business).
3 
When asked whether it was a concern that Mrs. Boyd was 
a requestor and Boyd was preliminarily signing off on purchase 
order forms, Principal Thatcher explained that this situation was quite rare and that it would have been a concern if it had been a common practice. Principal Thatcher stated that the original charter school statute required that the Board of Education audit Connections every year, which it failed to do. 
Thus, beginning in 2006, Connections hired its own auditors, who 
3 Mrs. Boyd used any accumulated points or bonus checks that the
Amway Business earned to purchase school supplies for Connections. 
6 
 
  
   
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
conducted audits and made recommendations to refine the school’s 
checks-and-balances procedures, including the school’s purchase order procedures. 
Principal Thatcher explained that he sought to instill 
in Connections’ employees that the school needed to get everything at the lowest cost possible. He related that Boyd did a lot of research on the availability of items and vendors and stated that Boyd was very diligent about following the practice of purchasing necessary items at the lowest price possible. Boyd in large part secured his position as Administrative Assistant at Connections because he always followed Principal Thatcher’s directions and methods. Principal 
Thatcher insisted that he could have approved the purchases of 
the school materials from other vendors, rather than from Mrs. Boyd, and that it was his prerogative to make that decision if the prices had been cheaper. 
In 2007, before the start of the school semester, 
Connections learned of a sudden price increase for its high school lunch services, and it had approximately three weeks to enter into a temporary replacement food services contract. 
Connections sought vendors, but Principal Thatcher explained 
that it was difficult to find affordable vendors on short notice. Consequently, Connections contracted with Boyd 
7 
 
  
  
  
  
                     
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Enterprises, a sole proprietorship co-owned by Boyd and his 
wife, to provide school lunches as Mrs. Boyd had the only competing bid with the Department of Education that would save Connections money.
4 
As part of the procedure for obtaining payment for the 
school lunches, Boyd Enterprises was required to submit a duly signed and certified Food Service Certificate, or invoice, reflecting the number of school lunches provided and the total amount owed. Principal Thatcher approved payment for the Food Service Certificates, and in his absence, Kelley would do so. Boyd apparently did not have authority to approve the Food Service Certificates and did not participate in the approval 
procedures as a school official. 
From January 25, 2007 to June 21, 2007, Boyd, as the 
Food Services Manager for Boyd Enterprises, submitted eleven 
Food Service Certificates to Connections and certified that the number of school lunches stated on the certificates represented the actual number of lunches provided. Kelley signed all the Food Service Certificates, and Principal Thatcher approved each of the payments to Boyd Enterprises. Principal Thatcher 
indicated that, at the time Connections had contracted with Mrs. 
4 The high school lunches provided by Boyd Enterprises were sold
for $3.00 each.

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Boyd, it was not a concern that Connections was paying Boyd 
Enterprises in which Boyd was the Food Services Manager. He explained that “we did not see it as a problem” but, after a year or so, in 2008, the hired “auditors advised [Connections] 
that it would be better if [Boyd] was not involved with the food 
service program at all, and [Connections] followed the advice of the auditors.” 
B. Commission Proceedings 
On October 20, 2010, the Commission formally issued a 
charge against Boyd based on twenty-six counts of violating HRS § 84-14(a) and (d) (1993), involving the purchase of school supplies and lunch services that had occurred approximately 
three years earlier. Boyd filed an answer to the Commission’s 
charge and requested a formal, contested, open hearing. Nearly seventeen months later, on April 18, 2012, the Commission issued its further statement of alleged violation that charged Boyd with nine counts of violating HRS § 84-14(a),
5 for requesting and 
approving the purchase of school materials from Amway Business, 
5 HRS § 84-14(a) provides, in relevant part, “No employee shall
take any official action directly affecting: (1) A business or other
undertaking in which the employee has a substantial financial interest; or(2) A private undertaking in which the employee is engaged as legal
counselor, advisor, consultant, representative, or other agency capacity.” 
9 
 
  
   Boyd filed an answer to the charge and further 
statement of alleged violation. He also filed a motion to dismiss based on the Commission’s lack of jurisdiction, maintaining that he was not an employee of the State subject to the code of ethics contained in HRS Chapter 84.
7 Boyd 
additionally contended that he was exempt from Chapter 84 because the legislature intended that local school boards develop and adopt their own ethics code. Boyd argued that he was accountable for his actions to Connections’ Local School 
                     
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
and eleven counts of violating HRS § 84-14(d),6 for assisting 
Boyd Enterprises in transactions to provide lunches to Connections. 
6 HRS § 84-14(d) states in pertinent part: 
No legislator or employee shall assist any person or
business or act in a representative capacity for a fee orother compensation to secure passage of a bill or to obtaina contract, claim, or other transaction or proposal in
which the legislator or employee has participated or will
participate as a legislator or employee, nor shall thelegislator or employee assist any person or business or actin a representative capacity for a fee or othercompensation on such bill, contract, claim, or other
transaction or proposal before the legislature or agency of
which the legislator or employee is an employee orlegislator. 
HRS § 84-14(d). 
7 Attached to Boyd’s motion to dismiss were the following documents
in which Connections was identified as Boyd’s employer: (1) U.S. Departmentof Justice Immigration and Naturalization Service Employment EligibilityVerification Form; (2) Internal Revenue Service Form W-4 (Employee’s
Withholding Allowance Certificate); and (3) State of Hawai ʻi Tax Form HW-4 
(Employee’s Withholding Allowance and Status Certificate).

Board, an autonomous entity under Chapter 302B, and not to the Commission under Chapter 84. 
Principal Thatcher submitted a signed, sworn 
declaration to the Commission, which quoted the portion of 
Connections’ Detailed Implementation Plan that stated as 
follows: 
The employment, appointment, promotion, transfer, demotion,
discharge, and job descriptions of all officers and
employees of or under the jurisdiction of the New Century
Charter School shall be determined by the New CenturyCharter School and applicable personnel laws and collectivebargaining agreements. 
Except as previously stated, the Board of Education or the
Superintendent of Education shall not have the power to
supervise or control the New Century Charter School in theexercise of its functions, duties and powers. 
This portion of the Detailed Implementation Plan described the 
powers, duties, and responsibilities of Connections and its Local School Board. Additionally, the Detailed Implementation Plan indicated that the Director of Operations of the Local School Board had direct authority over operations and business services, fiscal management and personnel services, and 
purchasing and audit services. The Commission in response to 
the motion to dismiss filed a motion for determination that Boyd was subject to the Commission’s jurisdiction. The Commission deferred its decision as to whether Boyd was subject to its jurisdiction until the date of the contested case hearing. 
11 
 
  
   
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
At the beginning of the contested case hearing, the 
Commission granted the motion for determination and denied 
Boyd’s motion to dismiss due to lack of jurisdiction, orally ruling that Boyd was an employee of the State subject to the 
code of ethics contained in Chapter 84 and to the Commission’s 
jurisdiction. During the hearing, in addition to the circumstances recounted above, Boyd testified that he did not receive any notification, training, or written information from the Commission that the code of ethics applied to him. Boyd also stated that he had done everything within his power to save Connections money. No evidence was presented that Amway Business or Boyd Enterprises overcharged Connections or that the 
school materials and lunches supplied to Connections were not 
provided at the best available price. 
Following the hearing, the Commission rendered factual 
findings, which included the following: (1) Connections was a public charter school created pursuant to statute; (2) Connections utilized a purchasing procedure that incorporated the use of a purchase order form it had developed; (3) as part of the purchasing procedure, several administrators were 
required to review the request, and Principal Thatcher retained 
final approval authority; and (4) Boyd, an Administrative Assistant at Connections, initially approved several purchase 
12 
 
  
   
                     
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
orders, which were subject to final approval by Principal 
Thatcher. The Commission also found that Principal Thatcher and Kelley had the sole authority to approve payments for the Food Service Certificates, which reflected the number of school 
lunches provided, and that Principal Thatcher approved payments 
to Boyd Enterprises for all the Food Service Certificates submitted. 
The Commission determined that the code of ethics 
applied to all State employees, except judges and justices,
8 and 
that Connections was a State agency as defined in HRS § 84-3 (1993).
9 The Commission thus concluded that, as an employee of 
Connections, a State agency, Boyd was an “employee” as defined 
in HRS § 84-3 and was therefore subject to the provisions set 
8 HRS § 84-2 provides 
This chapter shall apply to every nominated, appointed, or
elected officer, employee, and candidate to elected officeof the State and for election to the constitutional convention, but excluding justices and judges; provided
that in the case of elected delegates and employees of the
constitutional convention, this chapter shall apply only tothe enforcement and administration of the code of ethics adopted by the constitutional convention. 
HRS § 84-2 (1993). 
9 HRS § 84-3 defines “State agency” as including “the State, the
legislature and its committees, all executive departments, boards,
commissions, committees, bureaus, offices, the University of Hawai ʻi, and all
independent commissions and other establishments of the state government but
excluding the courts.”

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
forth in Chapter 84.10 Consequently, in its February 8, 2013 
“Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision and Order” 
(Decision and Order), the Commission concluded that Boyd had committed nine violations of HRS § 84-14(a) (Counts 1-9) and 
eleven violations of HRS § 84-14(d) (Counts 10-20). The 
Commission imposed an administrative fine of $500 for each violation, the maximum amount for each violation, totaling a fine of $10,000. 
C. Appellate Proceedings 
Boyd appealed the Commission’s Decision and Order to 
the circuit court,
11 contending, inter alia, that the Commission 
lacked statutory jurisdiction over him because he was not a 
State employee bound by the code of ethics in HRS Chapter 84 and 
because the Local School Board was exempt from Chapter 84. Boyd further maintained that the legislature intended that local school boards develop, adopt, and enforce a separate ethics code from Chapter 84, and therefore Boyd was accountable to Connections’ Local School Board, not the Commission. Boyd 
10 HRS § 84-3 defines “employee” as “any nominated, appointed, or
elected officer or employee of the State, including members of boards,
commissions, and committees, and employees under contract to the State or ofthe constitutional convention, but excluding legislators, delegates to theconstitutional convention, justices and judges.” 
11 The Honorable Greg K. Nakamura presided. 
14 
 
  
   
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
argued that it would be absurd if Connections’ employees were 
subject to two separate standards of ethical conduct. 
In its “Decision and Order Affirming in Part and 
Reversing in Part Hawai ʻi State Ethics Commission’s Findings of 
Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decision and Order” (circuit court Order), the circuit court found that Boyd was a member of a collective bargaining unit, as defined under HRS Chapter 89, 
such that his employer was the State. Consequently, the circuit 
court concluded that Boyd was an “employee” under HRS § 84-3 and thus was subject to the code of ethics in Chapter 84. The circuit court affirmed the Commission’s determination that Boyd had violated HRS § 84-14(a) (Counts 1-9) but reversed the ruling that Boyd had violated HRS § 84-14(d) (Counts 10-20) as the Commission had failed to make a finding that Boyd received money specifically in exchange for the act of signing the Food Service 
Certificates on behalf of Boyd Enterprises. Accordingly, the 
circuit court reduced the administrative fines to $4,500 and entered Final Judgment. 
The Commission appealed the circuit court Order and 
Final Judgment, maintaining that the court erred in reversing its ruling that Boyd had violated HRS § 84-14(d) because the Commission had concluded that Boyd received compensation for signing the Food Service Certificates. Boyd cross-appealed, 
15 
 
  
                      
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
contending, inter alia, that the Commission lacked statutory jurisdiction over him because he was not a State employee but rather was an employee of Connections’ Local School Board. Boyd also argued that the Commission lacked authority over him 
because during the time of the alleged offenses, charter school 
employees were governed by HRS Chapter 302B. Boyd further observed that, pursuant to HRS § 302B-7(d)
12 and (e)13 (Supp. 2006 
& 2007) (repealed 2012), Local School Boards were exempt from HRS Chapter 103D (Procurement Code), Chapter 91 (Administrative Procedures Act), and Chapter 92 (Public Meeting Law). Additionally, Boyd suggested that a subsequent amendment to HRS § 302B-7(f) indicated that Connections’ Local School Board 
was exempt from HRS Chapter 84 and that the legislature intended 
12 HRS § 302B-7(d) provided 
Local school boards shall be exempt from chapter 103D, but
shall develop internal policies and procedures for theprocurement of goods, services, and construction,
consistent with the goals of public accountability and
public procurement practices. Charter schools are encouraged to use the provisions of chapter 103D whereverpossible; provided that the use of one or more provisionsof chapter 103D shall not constitute a waiver of the
exemption from chapter 103D and shall not subject the
charter school to any other provision of chapter 103D. 
HRS § 302B-7(d). 
13 HRS § 302B-7(e) stated in relevant part that “[c]harter schools
and their local school boards shall be exempt from the requirements of
chapters 91 and 92.” 
16 
 
  
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
that local school boards develop, adopt, and enforce a separate ethics code. 
The ICA, in a published opinion, ruled that the 
Commission had jurisdiction to bring charges against Boyd 
because he was a State employee and was not exempt from the code 
of ethics by HRS Chapter 302B. The ICA concluded that Boyd was an employee of the State required to adhere to the code of ethics because (1) he admitted that he was an employee of the Local School Board, which was an “arm of the State,” (2) he participated in many of the available benefits of being a State employee, and (3) he self-identified as a State employee on several benefit enrollment forms. The ICA further ruled that 
Boyd’s exemption argument was not supported by canons of 
statutory construction, and thus was without merit, because the “contrast between the procedural statutes and the Code of Ethics leads to an inference that the latter was not intended to be included within the list of exempted statutes.” Additionally, the ICA concluded that the circuit court erred in reversing in part the Commission’s Decision and Order as it pertained to Boyd’s HRS § 84-14(d) violations because the record adequately 
supported that Connections’ payments to Mrs. Boyd for the lunch 
services constituted compensation to Boyd, for which Boyd was culpable. Accordingly, the ICA affirmed in part and reversed in

  Statutory interpretation is a question of law 
reviewable de novo. Estate of Roxas v. Marcos, 121 Hawai ʻi 59, 
66, 214 P.3d 598, 605 (2009) (quoting 
Capua v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 
117 Hawai ʻi 439, 443, 184 P.3d 191, 196 (2008)). Statutory 
construction is guided by the following rules: 
 
  Boyd contends that, based on HRS § 302B-9 (Supp. 2006 
& 2007) (repealed 2012),14 he was exempt from the code of ethics 
                     
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
part the circuit court’s Order and remanded the case to the circuit court to enter final judgment affirming the Commission’s Decision and Order. 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory
interpretation is the language of the statute itself.Second, where the statutory language is plain andunambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plainand obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task of
statutory construction is our foremost obligation to
ascertain and give effect to the intention of thelegislature, which is to be obtained primarily from thelanguage contained in the statute itself. Fourth, whenthere is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness
or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an
ambiguity exists. And fifth, in construing an ambiguousstatute, the meaning of the ambiguous words may be soughtby examining the context, with which the ambiguous words,phrases, and sentences may be compared, in order to
ascertain their true meaning.

III. DISCUSSION 
14 HRS § 302B-9(a) provided in relevant part, 
(continued. . .)
18  
  
                                                                   
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
in HRS Chapter 84. Boyd argues that because charter schools and 
their local school boards had autonomy and responsibility over the internal policies and procedures relating to personnel management and use of public funds, it would have been 
inconsistent and duplicative to have subjected charter schools 
and their employees to Chapter 84. In essence, Boyd asserts that because Chapter 84 was in conflict with HRS Chapter 302B, Chapter 302B superseded Chapter 84, rendering Boyd exempt from the code of ethics within that Chapter. Boyd also argues that the subsequent 2011 amendment to HRS § 302B-7(f) reflects that the legislature recognized an actual conflict between Chapter 84 and Chapter 302B and amended Chapter 302B in an attempt to 
remove the conflict, which was consistent with the legislature’s 
(. . .continued) 
Charter schools shall be exempt from chapters 91 and 92 and
all other state laws in conflict with this chapter, except
those regarding: 
(1) Collective bargaining under chapter 89 . . . 
(2) Discriminatory practices under section 378-2;
and 
(3) Health and safety requirements. 
HRS § 302B-9(a). 
19 
 
  
  
 
 The Commission responds that because Boyd had a State 
constitutional mandate to adhere to the code of ethics pursuant 
to Article XIV of the Hawai ʻi Constitution,16 Boyd could not have 
opted out of the code of ethics, and Connections’ Local School 
Board could not have exempted him from his constitutionally 
mandated ethical obligations.17 Additionally, the Commission 
contends that Boyd was not statutorily exempt from the code of 
ethics.18  
                     
  
  
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
actions regarding other State laws conflicting with Chapter 302B.
15 
15 In his application for writ of certiorari, Boyd also presents the
following questions: (1) whether ethics code violations require proof of
intent; (2) whether the ICA “overturned” Tangen v. State Ethics Commission,
57 Hawaiʻ i 87, 550 P.2d 1275 (1976) without basis; and (3) whether the
Commission violated Boyd’s due process right to a timely hearing. 
16 Article XIV of the Hawai ʻi Constitution provides that “the
legislature . . . shall adopt a code of ethics which shall apply to appointed
and elected officers and employees of the State or the political subdivision,
respectively, including members of the boards, commissions and other bodies.”Haw. Const. art. XIV. 
17 The Commission’s contention that Boyd could not have “opted out”
of compliance with the code of ethics because of Article XIV of the Hawai ʻi 
Constitution is inapt. Boyd’s charges were based upon a purported violationof the code of ethics from which Boyd contends that he had been statutorilyexempted. 
18 The Commission further maintains that Boyd waived his argument
that he was exempt from Chapter 84 because he did not initially raise thisissue in his application for writ of certiorari. As stated, Boyd contendedboth to the circuit court and the ICA that, as a charter school employee, hewas statutorily exempt from the code of ethics in Chapter 84. Additionally,both parties addressed this issue in their supplemental briefs to this court,
and therefore the issue was adequately raised by Boyd to this court. 
20 
 
  
   We turn first to the code of ethics, adopted by the 
legislature and codified in HRS Chapter 84. The Chapter sets forth specific standards of conduct as to gifts, reporting of gifts, confidential information, fair treatment, conflicts of 
interests, contracts, requirements of disclosure, and post-
employment restrictions. See HRS §§ 84-11 to -18 (1993). An 
ethics commission, established by Chapter 84, administers the code of ethics and enforces the provisions prescribed in the Chapter so as to promote public confidence in public servants. See
 HRS Chapter 84, Preamble (1993). The conflict of interest 
provision at issue in this case, prescribed in HRS § 84-14, restricts a State employee from taking any official action 
affecting a business in which the employee has a substantial 
financial interest or is engaged in an official capacity. HRS § 84-14(a) (1993).
19 It also prohibits an employee from 
representing or assisting a business for compensation on a contract or transaction before the agency where the employee works. See HRS § 84-14(d) (1993).

schools, the powers and duties of local school boards, charter schools’ exemptions from State laws, and certain charter school employees’ rights and benefits. Under this comprehensive legislation, which was later repealed in 2012 and replaced with 
HRS Chapter 302D, charter schools were empowered with “the 
flexibility and independent authority to implement alternative frameworks with regard to . . . personnel management.” HRS § 302B-1 (Supp. 2006 & 2007) (repealed 2012). A local school board served as the autonomous, governing entity of the charter school with “the independent authority to determine the organization and management of the school . . . and compliance with applicable federal and state laws.” Id. 
The State legislature’s adoption of this comprehensive 
legislation relating to the governance of charter schools in HRS § 302B (Supp. 2006) (repealed 2012) indicated that charter schools were neither standard public schools nor private schools. See HRS § 302A (Supp. 2006) (relating to public 
schools); HRS § 302C (Supp. 2006) (relating to private schools). Rather, charter schools, while supported in part by State general funds and linked to the Department of Education 
primarily for administrative purposes, had discretion and 
autonomy to operate independently and separately from the Department of Education and Board of Education. See, e.g., 
22 
 
  
   
                     
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
HRS §§ 302B-3, -8, -12, -15, -16 (Supp. 2006 & 2007) (repealed 2012). 
For example, in order to establish a charter school, a 
detailed implementation plan describing “[a] governance 
structure for the charter school that incorporate[d] a conflict 
of interest policy” was required to be submitted to the Board of Education. See 
HRS §§ 302B-5(d)(6), -6(d)(6) (Supp. 2006 & 
2007) (repealed 2012). The detailed implementation plan was also required to contain a framework for assessing the accountability of faculty and staff, both individually and collectively, that was “at least equivalent to the average system of accountability” in State public schools. HRS §§ 302B-
5(d)(1), -5(d)(5), -6(d)(1), -6(d)(5). A necessary component of the implementation plan was to provide for program audits and annual financial audits. HRS §§ 302B-5(d)(5)(A), -5(d)(5)(D), -6(d)(5)(A), -6(d)(5)(D). This detailed implementation plan served as the basis for a “performance contract” between the Board of Education and the charter school and presented a plan for holding the charter school accountable for its operations, finances, and management. 
See HRS § 302B-1.21 Thus, under 
21 A “detailed implementation plan” was defined as “the document
that details the charter school’s purpose, focus, operations, organization,
finances, and accountability, and becomes the basis for a performance
contract between the board and the charter school.” HRS § 302B-1. 
23 
 
  
   
  
                     
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
HRS §§ 302B-5(d) and 302B-6(d), charter schools and their local 
school boards were required to establish a framework of accountability that incorporated a conflict of interest policy and provided for annual financial audits. 
Once established as a charter school under Chapter 
302B, a charter school was mandated to conduct a comprehensive self-evaluation that was submitted to the charter school review panel at the end of the school year. HRS § 302B-14(a) (Supp. 2006 & 2007) (repealed 2012).
22 The self-evaluation process 
required an evaluation of the school’s organizational viability, which necessitated a showing that the charter school operates in “accordance with office guidelines and procedures, is 
financially sound and fiscally responsible in its use of public 
funds, maintains accurate and comprehensive financial records, operates in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices, and maintains a sound financial plan.” HRS § 302B-1. 
The autonomy and independence accorded to charter 
schools was further reflected in HRS § 302B-9(a), which specifically exempted charter schools from Chapter 91 and 
22 HRS § 302B-14(a) provides, in relevant part, that “[e]very
charter school shall conduct annual self-evaluations that shall be submitted 
to the board within sixty working days after the completion of the schoolyear. The self-evaluation process shall include but not be limited to: . . .
(6) [a]n evaluation of the school’s organizational viability.” 
24 
 
  
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Chapter 92, pertaining to the procedures of State agencies. See 
HRS § 302B-9(a). HRS § 302B-9(b) also provided that charter schools were exempt from the procurement code in HRS Chapter 103D but were mandated to develop their own internal policies 
and procedures “consistent with the goals of public 
accountability and public procurement practices.” 
HRS § 302B-
9(b). In addition to these exemptions from specific HRS chapters, charter schools were exempt from all other State laws in conflict with Chapter 302B. HRS § 302B-9(a). 
Thus, HRS Chapter 302B set forth a statutory scheme 
that empowered a charter school to delineate and implement a framework of accountability that established internal conflict 
of interest policies and procedures. In developing and 
enforcing this framework of accountability, the applicable statutory provisions permitted a charter school to hire its own auditors to review the school’s policies and procedures and to recommend improvements to personnel management and the use of fiscal resources. 
With mandated yearly self-evaluations 
required by Chapter 302B, a charter school was responsible for assessing its administrative operations and financial 
accountability. Thus, the legislature enacted a statutory 
scheme in which charter schools were accorded discretion, autonomy, and independence over matters relating to the required 
25 
 
  
   
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
establishment of standards of conduct for charter school employees. These standards of conduct included conflict of interest standards. 
Generally, a state law conflicts with another state 
law where the statutory provisions are “explicitly contrary to, or inconsistent with,” each other. 
See In re Haw. Gov’t Emps. 
Ass’n, 116 Hawai ʻi 73, 102-03, 170 P.3d 324, 353-54 (2007). 
Here, HRS § 84-14 prescribed standards of conduct as to conflicts of interests that employees were required to adhere to, whereas HRS §§ 302B-5(d)(6) and 302B-6(d)(6) required charter schools to submit a detailed implementation plan containing a conflict of interest policy and assessment plan providing for faculty and staff accountability and annual financial audits. HRS § 302B-14(a) further mandated that charter schools conduct yearly self-evaluations in order to 
ensure compliance with State and federal laws. Charter schools 
were thus obligated to develop, implement, and revise their own internal and independent conflict of interest policies and procedures for charter school employees. 
During the relevant time period, HRS Chapter 302B, 
which was adopted in 2006 and later repealed in 2012, did not require charter schools to adopt the specific standards of conduct prescribed in HRS § 84-14. 
That is, the internal 
26 
 
  
    
 
                     
 23  Under the current statutory scheme governing charter schools,
charter school employees are expressly subject to the code of ethics and not
exempt from HRS § 84-14. 
In 2011, the legislature amended HRS Chapter 302B
to provide that “[c]harter schools and their local school boards shall
develop internal policies and procedures consistent with ethical standards of
conduct, pursuant to chapter 84.” HRS § 302B-7(f) (Supp. 2011) (repealed2012). In 2012, the legislature repealed HRS Chapter 302B and enactedChapter 302D. Under HRS § 302D-12(i), “[a]ll charter school employees andmembers of governing boards shall be subject to chapter 84.” HRS § 302D-
12(i) (Supp. 2012). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
policies and procedures relating to conflicts of interests that 
charter schools established and implemented could have been identical, more expansive, or less restrictive than the conflict of interest provision prescribed in HRS § 84-14. Additionally, 
Chapter 302B required charter schools to review their policies 
and procedures with respect to responsibility for the use of public funds, which would include conflict of interest standards per the requirements of the school’s detailed implementation plan. Further, during the relevant time period, Chapter 302B did not require that the internal policies and procedures of charter schools relating to conflicts of interests be consistent with the code of ethics.
23 
In contrast, HRS § 84-14 required that an individual 
employee conform to specific statutory conflict of interest standards. Concurrently, Chapter 302B provided that charter schools develop and establish conflict of interest standards to govern charter school employees. If both HRS § 84-14 and 
27 
 
  
   Consequently, HRS § 84-14 was inconsistent with the 
provisions of HRS §§ 302B-5(d)(6) and 302B-6(d)(6) as to conflict of interest standards. Because HRS § 84-14 conflicted with these subsections of Chapter 302B at the time of the alleged violations, Boyd was exempt from HRS § 84-14, pursuant 
                     
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Chapter 302B applied to a charter school employee during the relevant time period, then that employee would have been subject to two separate conflict of interest standards. Thus, that same employee could have been subject to punishment under one set of 
standards, but not the other, for the same conduct.
24    
24 Although unnecessary to our holding, the circumstances in this
case reflect the inconsistency resulting from the application of the relevant
statutory provisions. In 2006 and 2007, Connections, in accordance with therequirements of its Detailed Implementation Plan, developed and implementedconflict of interest policy and procedures, and it evaluated on a yearly
basis whether the school was financially sound and fiscally responsible in
its use of public funds. See HRS §§ 302B-1, -5(d)(6), -6(d)(6), -7(c), -14(a). Connections’ administrative framework required documentation andmultiple levels of review by school officials for transactions involving theuse of school funds. These policies and procedures indicate that Connections
established an organizational structure designed to avoid financial
mismanagement, provide transparency, and maximize the effective use of schoolfunds. 
Boyd followed Connections’ conflict of interest policy by
including the requisite information on the purchase order forms and Food
Service Certificates and by ensuring the proper documentation was submitted
to the appropriate school officials. All approvals were obtained prior topurchasing the requested materials, which included reviewing whether theschool materials and lunches were obtained at the lowest possible price.Yet, despite acting in accordance with Connections’ internal conflict of
interest policy and procedures, Boyd was charged and found in violation of
twenty counts of HRS § 84-14, the conflict of interest provision contained inthe code of ethics. He was fined $500 for each violation, totaling a fine of$10,000. Boyd was thus subject to punishment under HRS § 84-14 for the sameconduct that was in compliance with Connections’ conflict of interest policy,
which was adopted in accordance with HRS §§ 302B-5(d)(6) or 302B-6(d)(6). 
28 
 
  
  
  For the reasons discussed, we vacate the ICA’s 
Judgment on Appeal, the circuit court’s Order and Final Judgment, and the Commission’s Decision and Order, and we remand 
the case to the Commission with instructions to dismiss the 
case.

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to HRS § 302-9(a). Thus, we conclude that the Commission lacked 
authority to adjudicate proceedings against Boyd for alleged violations of HRS § 84-14 that occurred in 2006 and 2007. Accordingly, the circuit court erred in its partial affirmance 
of the Commission’s Decision and Order, and the ICA erred in 
affirming in part and reversing in part the circuit court’s Order and remanding the case to the circuit court to enter final judgment affirming the Commission’s Decision and Order.

For respondent 
25 Boyd also raised the question of whether charter school employees
are employees of the State. In light of our disposition, it is unnecessary
to resolve this question, and, accordingly, the ICA ruling as to this issue
is also vacated. Additionally, we do not reach other issues raised by Boyd.
