SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(

 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Petitioners/Plaintiffs-Appellants (Petitioners) seek
 
review of the September 9, 2015 Order Granting in Part and
 
Denying in Part Without Prejudice Motion for an Award of
 Attorneys’ Fees and Costs, in which the Intermediate Court of
 Appeals (ICA) granted Petitioners’ request for appellate costs
 and denied Petitioners’ request for appellate attorney’s fees
 “without prejudice to Plaintiffs-Appellants submitting a requestfor attorneys’ fees to the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit
 (circuit court), including the fees incurred on this appeal, at
the conclusion of this case in the circuit court.” 

 
 
On certiorari, Petitioners contend that the ICA erred 
in not awarding attorney’s fees by failing to recognize that an 
arbitrability dispute is a separate action under Hawai' i Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 607-14, and that in prevailing in the arbitrability dispute, Petitioners were entitled to attorneys’ fees. 
With respect to appellate attorneys’ fees, we conclude
 
that, for the purposes of HRS § 607-14, the appeal of the
 arbitrability issue is a separate action from the underlying
 dispute on the merits. We determine that Petitioners prevailed
 in the arbitrability action and are entitled to reasonable
 attorneys’ fees under HRS § 607-14 and the fee-shifting provision
in the Purchase Agreement. We award Petitioners $54,974.00 in
 attorneys’ fees incurred on appeal before the ICA, to be taxed
 jointly and severally among Respondents/Defendants-Appellees.
 
 
With respect to Petitioners’ request for an order
 
3
 ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
stating that they are entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs
 
incurred in proceedings before the circuit court and in
 arbitration, we affirm the ICA’s denial without prejudice to
 Petitioners’ right to request fees and costs from the circuit
 court.
 
We also affirm the ICA’s award of $474.60 in appellate
 
costs. 
Accordingly, we reverse the portion of the ICA’s
 
September 9, 2015 order denying Petitioners’ request for
 appellate attorneys’ fees, and affirm the portions of the ICA’s
 September 9, 2015 order granting Petitioners’ request for
 appellate costs and denying Petitioners’ request for fees and
 costs incurred in the circuit court without prejudice to
 Petitioners’ right to request fees and costs in the circuit
 court.
