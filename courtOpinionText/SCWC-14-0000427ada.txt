 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
violation of Hawai i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 710 -1021 (2014).  
We hold that, under the facts of this particular case, failure 
to check in while on extended furlough is not punishable as escape in the second degree. 
HRS § 710-1021 states, “A person commits the offense of 
escape in the second degree if the person intentionally escapes 
from a correctional or detention facility or from custody.  
Escape in the second degree is a class C felony.” The State 
proceeded on a theory that Paris escaped from “custody” (i.e., 
not from a correctional or detention facility). HRS § 710-1000 
(2014) defines “custody” as “restraint by a public servant 
pursuant to arrest, detention, or order of a court.” 
On certiorari, Paris contends that the ICA gravely erred in 
affirming his conviction and rejecting his arguments that (1) the charge was deficient for fail ing to define “custody”; (2) 
insufficient evidence supported his conviction; and (3) the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
1 (“circuit court”) erroneously 
instructed the jury on “custody.”2 We agree.  
Central to this appeal is w hat constitutes “custody” for 
the purpose of the offense of escape in the second degree.  We 
1 The Honorable Rom A. Trader presided. 
2 Paris also argues that the ICA gravely erred in rejecting his arguments 
that (1) the prosecutor committed misconduct by misstating the requisite 
state of mind for the offense; and (2) the circuit court abused its 
discretion by failing to apply the doctrine of judicial estoppel.  In light 
of our disposition of this case, we find it unnecessary to address these 
arguments. 
2
      
 
 
  “Custody,” thus defined, is not “ an unmistakable term 
readily comprehensible to a person of common understanding”; 
therefore, the statutory definition of “custody” should have 
been included in the charging instrument. Further, the State 
was required to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Paris 
intentionally escaped from custody, as defined in HRS § 710-
1000, not just that he violated the terms of his furlough agreement and extended furlough agreement by failing to check in 
with his LWFC case manager. Lastly, although the circuit court 
properly instructed the jury on the statutory definition of 
custody, it also submitted  another jury instruction on custody 
that was inconsistent with the statutory definition, erroneous, 
and misleading. Due to the insufficiency of the evidence 
adduced at trial, we reverse the ICA’s September 22, 2015 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
agree with Paris that the meaning of “custody” shifted 
throughout the proceedings below. First, the circuit court 
defined “custody” with reference to our case law; next, the 
circuit court nevertheless concluded that the term “custody” was 
a term susceptible to common understanding ; lastly, the circuit 
court stated “custody” meant “confinement.”   We have accepted 
certiorari in this case to clarify that, for purposes of escape 
in the second degree, “custody” means “restraint by a public 
servant pursuant to arrest, detention, or order of a court.”

judgment on appeal and the circuit court’s Jan uary 14, 2014 
judgment of conviction and sentence. 
II. Background 
A. The Furlough Agreement 
In June 2011, Paris and his case manager, Noel Villanueva; 
his unit manager, Wendel Yoda; and the Oahu Center Warden, 
Francis Sequeira, signed and entered into a Furlough Agreement. 
The Furlough Agreement “define[d] mutual responsibilities and 
provide[d] an opportunity for [Paris] to demonstrate readiness 
for parole and to prepare for successful parole or release by 
establishing or re-establishing family and c ommunity ties.” 
Paris’s Furlough Site was listed as his parents’ Wahiawa home. Under the heading “Part I - Rules and Regulations of the Furlough 
Agreement,” Paris initialed 35 items (some of which included sub-items).  
Complicating our review of whether a furloughee’s 
failure to check in constitutes a crime are provisions in the Furlough Agreement that are unclearly worded but that 
seem to call for administrative, rather than criminal, 
consequences for escape. The Furlough Agreement term the 
State relies upon as the basis for Paris’s escape charge 
and conviction is Item 9, which provides for “process[ing]” 
or “list[ing]” as an “escapee” upon a furloughee’s failure 
to return to LWFC: 
4
      
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
9. I understand and agree that I shall be processed as an 
escapee 
if I fall into one or more of the following 
stipulations: 
a. Fail to return to the Laumaka Work Furlough Center 
(LWFC) or OCCC [Oahu Community Correctional Center] at the designated day and time as stated in this Agreement or on my pass and/or fail to seek permission for an extension of 
the designated return time. 
b. 
Fail to return to LWFC or OCCC in a timely manner when 
I am directed to do so regardless of the expiration time stated on th
e pass. 
I further understand that should I be listed, as an escapee 
under any of the aforementioned conditions, my pass will be deemed null and void.  
 
(Emphasis added.) Under Item 9, the clear consequence for 
failure to return to LWFC is that the furlough pass is 
deemed null and void. That is an administrative, not 
criminal, consequence. Less clear is what occurs when a 
furloughee is “processed” or “listed” as an “escapee.” 
Other items in the Furlough Agreement suggest an “escape” 
is merely an “absen[ce] without authorization” rather than 
a criminal act, the consequences for which are 
administrative, rather than criminal: 
29. I understand and agree that I will not hold the State 
of Hawaii, Department of Public Safety, and Oahu Community 
Correctional Cen
ter liable or accountable for any of my 
property when I am declared absent without authorization 
(escape)
. 
30. I further understand that my property will be disposed 
of on the 31st day that I am declared absent without 
authorization (escape) . 
(Emphasis added.) Underscoring the interpretation that “escape” 
is not a criminal act is Item 32, which defines “escape” as 
presence in off-limits areas of LWFC.  The  consequence for 
that type of escape is an “administrative[] charge[] as an escapee”:  
5

      
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Emphasis added.) 
 By contrast, the only item threatening criminal prosecution 
is Item 2, which reads    
 
 
 
(Emphasis added.) Criminal prosecution, however, is listed 
as the most severe consequence, following a list of 
escalating administrative consequences, and it appears to 
be limited just to the commission of “any illegal act.”    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
32. I under
stand that should I be observed in the inner 
perimeter of LWFC, I will be administratively charged as an 
escapee. This is defined as the area from the LWFC’s fenc e 
line to the backside of the Modules, the cabled/chained off 
areas or the landing directly outside of the escape doors.  
These areas are clearly marked. 
(Emphasis added.) In short, the items in the Furlough 
Agreement expressly referencing escape define escape in 
administrative, not criminal, terms, and provide for 
administrative, not criminal, consequences.  Further, Item 
35, which does not expressly reference escape, reiterates 
that deviation from the terms of a furlough pass will 
result in administrative consequences, as follows: 
35. I understand and agree that any deviation from the 
following: date of validity, time expiration, 
destination, 
and purpose/intent of any furlough pass will result in the 
processing of a  high misconduct violation and referred to 
the Adjustment Hearing process
.  This may jeopardize 
continued participation in the furlough program
 and may 
result in transfer from OCCC. 
2. I understand and agree that my failure to comply with 
furlough conditions shall result in disciplinary action by 
the Adjustment Committee, forfeiture of furlough privileges 
and/or possible assignment to a greater control status by 
the Program Committee,  and/or criminal prosecution for the 
commission of any illegal act . 
6

      
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Lastly, this appeal hinges upon the definition of “custody” 
in the escape statute. Relevant to this appeal, items 1, 8, and 26 seem to contradict each other as to whether Paris, while on 
furlough, was in the “custody” of the Department of Public 
Safety (“DPS”) and/or the State. Those items read: 
1. I understand that I remain under the jurisdiction of 
the Department of Public Safety, Oahu Community 
Correctional Center (OCCC), Community Based Section, and 
will comply with all R&R, Policies  and Procedures governing 
said agency. I further understand and agree upon furlough 
release to comply with all County Ordinances, State 
Statutes, and Federal Laws.  
. . . . 8. 
I understand and agree that the Program Committee of 
the Oahu Community Correct
ional Center may cancel this 
agreement at any time if I fail to fulfill any terms and conditions of furlough or fail to obey institutional, State 
and Federal Laws or regulations. All cancellations are 
grounds for my 
immediate return to the custody of the 
Department of Public Safety.
    
. . . .

 
26. I will submit urine samples for drug testing whenever 
requested to do so. 
I understand that my failure to do so 
will be considered a positive finding and action will be taken accordingly. Furthermore, 
as a custody of the State  
[sic] I understand that my person, property or room maybe [sic] subject to search by the Corrections/Law Enforcement 
personnel at any time. 
(Emphasis added.) Specifically, Items 1 and 26 consider 
Paris to be “under the jurisdiction” of DPS and “a custody of the State [sic],” respectively, while Item 8 states that 
the cancellation of the Furlough Agreement is grounds for 
Paris’s “immediate return to the custody” of DPS, 
suggesting that, while on furlough, Paris is not in the 
custody of DPS.   These unclear and contradictory provisions 
in the Furlough Agreement make it difficult to conclusively 
7

      
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
state that noncompliance with the check-in term constitutes 
criminal “escape” from “custody.”  
B. The Extended Furlough Agreement 
In mid-November 2011, Paris’s Program Committee determined 
that Paris “ha[d] not demonstrated any problems while in the 
community.” The Committee also determined that Paris “ha[d] an 
appropriate residence,” namely his parents’ Wahiawa home. The 
Committee recommended placing Paris on Extended Furlough, 
provided that he comply with the following condition: “Check in 
once a week with Case Manager Noel Villanueva every Wednesday at 
0600 hours.” Therefore, at the end of the month, Paris, 
Villanueva, Yoda, and Sequeira signed and entered into an 
Extended Furlough Contract. Relevant to this appeal, the 
Extended Furlough Contract stated: 
The Furloughee agrees to comply with these conditions: 
1. To adhere to all the rules, regulations, and as stated 

in the Furlough Agreement, Work Furlough Contract, and set 
by the Corrections Division.
 
. . . . 
 
4. To report in person every week to [Case Manager 

Villanueva or Unit Manager Yoda] for feedback.
 
5. To report in person once a week to obtain a new weekly 
pass. 
The escape charge w as predicated on Paris’s non -compliance with 
the weekly reporting requirement of the Extended Furlough 
Contract.

 On February 10, 2012, the State filed an Amended Felony 
Information that stated the following:  
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 Paris filed a Motion to Dismiss Complaint for  Failure to 
State an Offense. He argued that the escape charge in the 
complaint failed to define custody; therefore, “the Complaint fail[ed] to allege essential elements of the offense and must be 
dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.” In it s 
memorandum in opposition to Paris’s motion, the State counter -
argued that the term “custody” is “readily comprehensible to a 
person of common understanding.”   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
C.   Trial Proceedings 
1. The Charge 
The Department of the Prosecuting Attorney charges: 
On or about the 11th day of January, 2012, to and 
including, February 2, 2012, in the City and County of 
Honolulu, State of Hawaii, EUGENE PARIS, Jr. also known as 
Eugene J.E. Rivera, Jr., did intentionally escape from a 
correctional or detention facility or from custody, thereby 
committing the offense of Escape in the Second Degree, in 
violation of Section 710 -1021 of the Hawaii Revised 
Statutes. 
If convicted of this offense or any included felony 
offense, EUGENE PARIS, Jr. also known as Eugene J.E. Rivera, Jr., may be subject to sentencing in accordance with Section 706 -661 and Section 706 -662(1) of the Hawaii 
Revised Statutes where he is a persistent offender in that he has previously been convicted of two or more felonies 
committed at different times when he was eighteen years of 
age or older, and an extended term of imprisonment is necessary for the protection of the public. 
2. Pre-Trial Motion to Dismiss 
The circuit court held a hearing on the motion. 
The 
circuit court began the hearing by quoting the following holding 
on the meaning of “custody” for second degree escape from State 
9

      
 
 
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
v. Smith, 59 Haw. 456, 463-64, 583 P.2d 337, 343 (1978): “While 
[Hawaii Youth Correction Facility] did not have actual physical 
control over the appellant at the time he is alleged to have 
escaped [by not returning at the end of his furlough], it had 
control and custody in the sense that appellant was released on 
furlough not as a free person but as one legally bound by 
restrictions.” The circuit court denied the mot ion and issued 
findings of fact and conclusions of law. Although the circuit 
court discussed Smith ’s holding on “custody” at the hearing, the 
circuit court issued a conclusion of law regarding the statutory definition of “custody,” concluding “that the term ‘custody,’ as 
defined in HRS § 710-1000, is an unmistakable term readily 
comprehensible to a person of common understanding,” and that 
the “statutory definition of ‘custody’ does not create any 
additional essential elements to the offense of Escape in the 
Second Degree.” In other words, the circuit court concluded 
that the “Information provided fair notice to Defendant Paris as to all the essential elements of the offense of Escape in the 
Second Degree.”  
3. Trial 
During opening statements, the St ate’s theory of the case 
was that Paris committed escape by failing to meet with his case manager as required under the furlough agreement and extended 
furlough work contract. 
The State explained to the jury that 
10
      
 
 
  The State called as its first witness Paris’s case manager, 
Noel Villanueva. He testified that Paris was in “community 
custody” at LWFC. Villanueva stated that he reviewed the June 14, 2011 furlough agreement with Paris, who initialed every term 
and condition to indicate his understanding. Villanueva and 
Paris discussed item 9B of the furlough agreement; Villanueva 
explained to Paris that the term and condition meant, 
“Regardless if [Paris] is working at that moment. . ., if I tell 
him to come back to Laumaka right away, I give him enough time, 
like two hours to come back, he has to come back.”   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
furlough is “sort of a minimum security.”  The defense objected, 
arguing at the bench  that the State was “getting really close to 
talking about how furlough is still custody, when that’s a legal conclusion, which is argument and not what a witness can testify 
to.” During the bench conference, the  circuit court overruled 
the objection, stating, “Well, there’s the legal term custody. There’s also custody in a general sense, which means 
confinement. So I understand what you’re saying.” Thus, it 
appears that the circuit court considered “custody” t o mean 
“confinement” at this stage of the trial. During opening statements, Paris’s main defense was that his parents’ home was 
the place of detention he was alleged to have escaped from, and 
the State would present no evidence that he was not at his 
parents’ home.   
11

      
 
 
  As for the extended furlough agreement, Villanueva 
explained that a furloughee on extended furlough “actually 
leaves to their sponsor or to their family. . . .  [He is]  given 
weekly passes, where when he goes home he doesn’t live at the Laumaka anymore. I will send him home and he will only see me 
once a week, and the same day, the same hour every week.” 
Villanueva authorized Paris to live with his parents in Wahiawa 
and report in person at Laumaka every Wednesday at 6:00 a.m. 
Villanueva explained the extended work furlough agreement to 
Paris, and Paris signed it.   
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
On January 4, 2012, at 6:00 a.m., Paris met with Villanueva 
as scheduled. 
Villanueva gave Paris a one-week pass and told 
him to meet him again on January 11, 2012 at 6:00 a.m. Paris 
did not report to Villanueva on January 11, 2011. Paris did, 
however, call Villanueva that day; Villanueva told Paris he 
could come in at 6:00 p.m. and that Villanueva would wait for 
him. Villanueva waited until 9:00 p.m., but Paris did not check in. Paris did not report to Laumaka at any time between January 
11, 2012 and February 2, 2012. 
On cross-examination, Villanueva testified, “I explained to 
[Paris] that he’s still under the custody of the Public Safety 
even if he is on extended furlough. Even if he’s not living in 
the prison, he’s living with his mom, he’s still under the 
custody of his – of the Public Safety.”  He also agreed that 
12
      
 
 
  The State’s last witness was Honolulu Police Department 
police officer Waldron Chung. He testified that on the night of 
February 2, 2012, at approximately 1:30 a.m., he observed a 
white Toyota Corolla driving westbound on the H-1 freeway.  The 
car was “weaving  within its lane,” then drifted over to another 
lane and then the right shoulder. Chung pulled the car over. Paris was driving, and he had a female passenger. Paris initially identified himself as “John J.  Rivera,” and Chung 
could not find any information on that name when he ran it through dispatch and his mobile data computer. The female 
passenger told Chung Paris’s real name, and Chung was then able 
to ascertain through dispatch that Paris was an escapee.  (The 
circuit court issued a cautionary instruction that Chung’s 
statement that dispatch told him Paris was an “escapee” was *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Paris’s mother’s home was Paris’s “place of detention[.]” 
Villanueva acknowledged that there were different types of 
escape: criminal escape, administrative escape, absent without 
authorization, violent escape, and nonviolent escape.   
 The State next called Moses Fonoimoana, a sergeant at 
Laumaka Work Furlough Center who monitors inmates on furlough.    
He testified that Paris called him on January 11, 2012, and 
Fonoimoana told him to report back to Laumaka at 6:00 p.m. that 
day. Paris did not report to Laumaka at 6:00 p.m. on January 
11, 2012.   
13

      
 
 
   
 The State then rested.  The defense moved for a judgment of 
acquittal, arguing (1) that the State had not proven that Paris 
left his parents’ home, his place of detention; and (2) that a 
failure to check in to LWFC is not “escape.” The circuit court 
denied the motion. The defense did not put on a case in chief 
and, instead, rested.   
   
 The following jury instruction on the offense of Escape in 
the Second Degree was given by agreement:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 The following jury instruction providing the statutory 
definition of escape was given, as modified, over Paris’s objection: “‘Custody ’  means restraint by a public servant 
pursuant to arrest, detention, or order of a court
.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
admitted to show the information Chung had available to him, not 
for the truth of the matter asserted.) 
4. Jury Instructions 
The Defendant, Eugene Paris, Jr., is charged with the 
offense of Escape in the Second Degree. 
A person commits the offense of Escape in the Second 
Degree if he intentionally escapes from a correctional 
facility, a detention facility, or custody. 
There are two material elements of the offense of 
Escape in the Second Degree, each of which the prosecution 
must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. 
These two elements are: 
1. That, on or about January 11, 2012 to and 
including February 2, 2012 in the City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, the Defendant escaped from a 
correctional facility, a detention facility, or custody; 
and 
2. That the Defendant did so intentionally. 
14
      
 
 
  The following jury instruction on the terms “escape” and 
“custody” was given, as modified, over the objection of both the 
State and Paris: 
 
 
  
 During closing argument, the State told the jury the 
following: 
 I want to point your attention to the elements 
instruction. . . . Escape in the Second Degree, number 1, 
that on or about January 11, 2012, in the city and county 
of Honolulu, state of Hawaii, to and including February 2nd, 2012, the defendant escaped from a correctional 
facility, a detention facility, or from custody; and two, 
that the defendant did so intentionally.  
 I want to point yo ur attention to the word “or.” The 
State does not need to prove all three, that the defendant escaped from a correctional facility, detention facility, 
and from custody. State is going to prove this by focusing 
on the defendant escaped from custody. So we can cross out 
correctional facility, detention facility, and we’re just going to look at the defendant escaped from custody.  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
An escape can be perpetrated by a person even though he is not in actual physical custody or under immediate control and supervision of a guard. 
A person may be deemed to be 
in custody when released from a correctional or detention facility on furlough and legally bound by restrictions. 
Defense counsel objected to the initial form of the instruction  
on the basis that “it takes two sentences which are not only out 
of order but out of context [from Smith, 59 Haw. 456, 583 P.2d 
337].” The court modified the instruction so that the second 
sentence of the instruction read, “a person may be deemed to be 
in custody when released from a correctional or detention 
facility on furlough and legally bound by restrictions.” The 
State objected to the modification. It is this instruction that 
Paris challenges on certiorari.  
5. The State’s Closing Argument 
15
      
 
 
      
 The jury found Paris guilty as charged. The circuit court 
sentenced Paris to five years’ incarceration, with credit for 
time served, with the sentence to run concurrently with any 
other term currently being served. Paris appealed.   
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(Emphasis added.) Thus, the State confirmed that its entire 
theory of Paris’s liability for Escape in the Second Degree 
rested on one prong of the offense:  escape from custody.  
6. Verdict 
D. ICA Appeal 
The ICA affirmed the circuit court’s judgment of conviction 
and sentence in a memorandum opinion, rejecting Paris’s arguments that (1) the charge was deficient for failing to 
include the statutory definition of “custody”; (2) insufficient 
evidence supported his conviction; and (3) the jury instruction 
on “custody” drawn from Smith was erroneous. State v. Paris , 
CAAP-14-0000427 (App. Jul 31, 2015) (mem.) 
.  The ICA quoted 
Smith, 59 Haw. at 463
-64, 583 P.2d at 343, for the proposition 
that a correctional faci lity maintains “control and custody 
[over a furloughee] in the sense that [the furloughee] was released on furlough not as a free person but as one legally 
bound by restrictions.” Paris, mem. op. at 6. The ICA also 
cited State v. Kealoha  , 71 Haw. 251, 253, 787 P.2d 690, 691 
(1990) 
, for the proposition that “a prisoner who failed to 
return at the expiration of her furlough, without a legitimate 
16
      
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
   
  
  
  
  
  
 An appellate court reviews whether the jury instructions 
given by the trial court, “when read and considered as a whole 
. . . are prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, 
or misleading.” State v.  Locquiao, 100 Hawai i 195, 205, 58 P.3d 
1242, 1252 (2002) (citation omitted).   “If there is . . . a 
reasonable possibility in a criminal case [that an erroneous *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
excuse, was guilty of escape.” Paris, mem. op. at 7. Paris now 
seeks review of the ICA’s memorandum opinion. 
III. Standards of Review 
A. Sufficiency of a Charge 
“Whether an indictment or complaint sets forth all the 
essential elements of a charged offense is a question of law, 
which [the appellate court reviews] under the de novo, or 
right/wrong, standard.” State v. Young , 107 Hawai i 36, 39, 109 
P.3d 677, 680 (2005) (internal quotation marks, citation, 
brackets, and ellipsis omitted). 
B. Sufficiency of the Evidence 
“‘Substantial evidence ’ as to every material element of the 
offense charged is credible evidence which is of sufficient 
quality and probative value to enable [a person] of reasonable 
caution to support a conclusion. ” State v. Matavale , 115 Hawai i 
149, 158, 166 P.3d 322, 331 (2007)(citation omitted).

conviction on which it may have been based must be set aside.”

IV. Discussion 
A. Sufficiency of the Charge 
On certiorari, Paris contends that the ICA “ gravely erred 
in concluding that the charging language for Escape in the 
Second Degree was sufficient.” Paris first argues that the 
Felony Information did not provide fair notice to Paris of the offense he was charged with because the statutory definition of “custody” was not included. 
His argument then focuses on the 
multiple definitions of “custody” used throughout the trial to show that he was not given fair notice in the Felony Information 
of precisely what type of custody he was alleged to have escaped 
from. Paris argues that the circuit court denied his motion to 
dismiss the felony information on the basis that the term 
“custody” was unmistakable and readily comprehensible to a person of common understanding.  At the hearing on the motion, 
Paris points out, the circuit court introduced another 
definition of custody found in Smith: that, while LWFC “did not 
have actual physical control over the [furloughee] at the time, he is alleged to have escaped and had control and custody in the 
18
      
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
sense that the [furloughee] was released on furlough, not as a 
free person but one legally bound by restrictions.” He then 
points out that, during opening statements, the circuit court 
acknowledged there was a distinction between the legal 
definition of custody and its general sense meaning of 
“confinement.” This alone, to Paris, indicates that there were 
multiple meanings of custody at issue in the case, and Paris’s 
Felony Information should have specified which definition of 
custody he was accused of escaping from.   
Paris’s argument is persuasive. 
Article I, Section 14 of 
the Hawaii Constitution states, “In all criminal prosecutions, 
the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be informed of the 
nature and cause of the accus ation. . . .” A charging 
instrument provides fair notice to the defendant if “it contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged, and 
sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared 
to meet. . . .” State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai i 383, 391, 219 P.3d 
1170, 1178 (2009) (citations omitted). 
In Wheeler, this court held that an OVUII charge failed to 
provide fair notice to the defendant of the offense he was 
accused of committing. 121 Hawai i at 395, 219 P.3d at 1182. 
The charge was deficient because, while it was drawn from the 
statutory language of the offense, it failed to include a definition of “operate,” found in another statutory section, 
19

      
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that geographically limited the “operation” of a vehicle to 
“public way[s], street[s], road[s], or highway[s].”  121 Hawai i 
at 393, 219 P.3d at 1180. This court concluded that “the 
operation of a vehicle on a public way, street, road, or highway 
is an attendant circumstances of the offense of OVUII, and is 
therefore an element of the offens e.” Id.   The failure of the 
charge to include this essential element rendered it deficient. 
Id. Further, this court held that the charge failed to provide 
the defendant fair notice, because the term “operate” as used in 
HRS § 291E-61 was neither “unmistakable” nor “readily 
comprehensible to persons of common understanding.” 121 Hawai i 
at 393, 394, 219 P.3d at 1180, 1181.  
In this case, the Felony Information alleged that Paris 
intentionally escaped from a “correctional or detention facility 
or from custody.” Relevant to this appeal, “custody” is defined 
as “restraint by a public servant pursuant to arrest, detention, 
or order of a court.” HRS § 710-1000.   This definition creates 
the additional attendant circumstances of (1) who is exercising restraint (“a public servant”); and (2) the bases for such 
restraint (“arrest, detention, or order of a court.”) In that 
sense, the common understanding of “custody” as “confinement” 
has been limited in a manner not unmistakable or readily 
comprehensible to a person of common understanding.  The Felony Indictment in this case did not allege any of the attendant 
20

      
 
 
   
 On certiorari, Paris contends that insufficient evidence 
supported his conviction for Escape in the Second Degree. Paris 
argues, “No where [sic] in the law or in the documents provided 
to Petitioner is it ever suggested that if he misses a check-in 
appointment, it will be treated as if he escaped the prison 
facility.” We agree. Under the particular facts of this case, 
we do not believe that non-compliance with the check-in *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
circumstances found in HRS § 710-1000’s definition, and the 
omission of these essential elements resulted in a charge that 
did not provide fair notice of Paris of the offense he was 
alleged to have committed. Therefore, the ICA erred in 
concluding that the Felony Information provided fair notice to 
Paris. 
Were this the only error expressly alleged on appeal, we 
would vacate the ICA’s judgment on appeal an d the circuit 
court’s judgment, and remand this case to the circuit court with 
instructions to dismiss the information without prejudice. See  
Wheeler, 121 Hawai i at 386, 219 P.3d at 1173. In this case, 
however, Paris expressly challenges the sufficiency  of the 
evidence supporting his conviction, as well as a jury 
instruction on “custody.” We find merit in both of these 
challenges, which are addressed in turn below, and reverse 
Paris’s conviction for insufficiency of the evidence.   
B. Sufficiency of the 
Evidence 
21
      
 
 
  In this case, to have convicted Paris for escape in the 
second degree, the State was required to prove, beyond a 
reasonable doubt, that Paris “intentionally escape[d] from . . . 
custody,” with “custody” statutorily defined as “restraint by a 
public servant pursuant to arrest, detention, or order of a *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
provisions of the furlough agreements is punishable as criminal 
escape in the second degree. It appears in this case that the 
State relied upon the fact that Paris was a party to the 
furlough agreements to substitute for proof of “custody,” and 
the fact that Paris did not comply with the check-in term to 
allow the jury to inf er “escape.” The instant furlough 
agreements, however, contained unclear and contradictory 
provisions regarding Paris’s custodial status. Therefore, 
merely referencing the furlough agreement terms cannot satisfy 
the State’s burden of proving an element o f escape: custody. 
Rather, HRS § 710-1021, the escape in the second degree statute, must be strictly construed. 
See Smith , 59 Haw. at 461, 583 P.2d  
at 341 (“[W]e have consistently adhered in this jurisdiction to 
the rule of strict construction of penal statutes.”) (citations 
omitted); see also    HRS § 701-104 (2014) (“The provisions of [the 
Hawaii Penal Code] cannot be extended by analogy so as to create 
crimes not provided for herein. . . .”).  
22

 Further, the Dissent would remand this case for a new trial due to 
instructional error. Dissent at 1-2.  To the extent that the Dissent 
suggests that the State could retry Paris on the resurrected theory that he 
escaped from a correctional facility –  a theory that was expressly abandoned 
at trial –  we note that “[t]he  doctrine of judicial estoppel  prevents parties 
from playing fast and loose with the court or blowing hot and cold during the 
course of litigation, ”  the requirements of which were met in this case.   
State v. Fields, 115 Hawai i 503, 534, 168 P.3d 955, 986 (2007) (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted).  
  
  The Dissent argues that substantial evidence supported Paris’s 
conviction for Escape in the Second Degree, because Villanueva testified that 
Laumaka was the correctional facility from which Paris escaped. Dissent at 
5.  The conviction for Escape in the Second Degree was not based upon the 
“correctional facility” prong of the offense, however. See  HRS 710- 1021 (“A 
person commits the offense of escape in the second degree if the person intentionally escapes from a correctional or detention facility or from 
custody.”) The State consistently maintained throughout trial that it 
intended to prove that Paris escaped from “custody.”  In fact, the State told 
the jury during closing arguments to “cross out correctional facility [and] detention facility” from its jury instructions and to “focus[] on the 
defendant escap[ing] from custody.”  The State clearly abandoned the two 
other theories of criminal liability at trial.    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
court.” HRS § 710-1021, -1000.3 It is undisputed in this case 
that Paris’s restraint was not pursuant to arrest. There is 
also no court order in evidence calling for Paris’s restraint. 
Therefore, at trial, the State had to prove that Paris escaped from “restraint by a public servant pursuant to . . . detention. 
. . .” Indeed, at trial, Paris’s case manager Noel Villanueva 
agreed that Paris’s mother’s home was Paris’s “place of 
detention[.]” The State’s evidence at trial focused only upon 
Paris’s failure to check in with LWFC staff. There was no 
evidence presented that Paris intentionally escaped restraint by  
a public servant from his mother’s ho me. In fact, no one 
testified about any attempts to contact or locate Paris there. 
23
      
 
 
  
  
 In Smith, the defendant, Kenneth Allan Smith, was a minor 
who had been committed to the Hawaii Youth Correctional Facility 
(“HYCF”). 59 Haw. at 4 57-58, 583 P.2d at 339-40.  He was given 
a day pass that allowed him to remain off HYCF premises from 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. 59 Haw. at 458, 583 P.2d at 340. Smith 
failed to return to HYCF by 7:00 p.m. Id.   Smith was charged 
with, and convicted of, escape in the second degree.  59 Haw. at 
457, 583 P.2d at 339. He appealed, arguing that the trial court 
should have granted his motion for judgment of acquittal, 
because “he could not have escaped from the facility by merely 
failing to return thereto.” 59 H aw. at 460, 583 P.2d at 341. 
In other words, Smith argued that he did not escape because he 
was on furlough and not in the “actual custody” or “immediate *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
As such, insufficient evidence supported Paris’s conviction, 
under HRS § 710-1021 and -1000.  
We therefore disagree with the ICA’s conclusion that 
substantial evidence su pported Paris’s conviction for escape. 
Paris
, mem. op. at 6. The ICA relied upon Smith, 59 Haw. 456, 
583 P.2d 337, and Kealoha , 71 Haw. 251, 787 P.2d 690, for the 
proposition that escape can be perpetrated by a furloughee who 
fails to return at the expiration of a furlough pass.  Paris, 
mem. op. at 6, 7. Both cases are distinguishable from the 
instant case. 
24
      
 
 
   
  
  
 
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
supervision of a guard” at the time. 59 Haw. at 462, 583 P.2d 
at 342. 
This court rejected Smith’s argument, holding, “It is 
evident to us that intentional failure to return to physical 
confinement would fall within the definition of escape from 
custody.” Id. (emphasis added). Thus, Smith stands for the 
proposition that “custody” extends to furlough from physical 
confinement. See also id. (“[C]ontinued custody is not affected 
by the temporary release from physical control over an inmate.”) 
(emphasis added). In this case, LWFC did not have physical 
control over Paris. Paris’s failure to check in wit h LWFC staff 
before resuming his stay in the community is not the same as Smith’s failure to return to physical confinement. Therefore, 
Smith does not apply to this case. 
Similarly, in Kealoha, the defendant, Lynette Lehua 
Kealoha, was on a furlough from the Women’s Community Correctional Center (“WCCC”) and failed to return at the expiration of the furlough. 71 Haw. at 251-52, 787 P.2d at 690.  
She was convicted on escape in the second degree. 71 Haw. at 
251, 787 P.2d at 690.  This court affirmed the conviction. 71 
Haw. at 252, 787 P.2d at 691. Kealoha thus also supports the 
proposition that an intentional failure to return to physical 
confinement at WCCC constitutes escape from custody. Again, in 
this case, Paris was on an extended furlough in the community.  
25
      
 
 
  
 
 Paris’s conduct falls within the escape in  the second 
degree statute only by analogy to Smith  and Kealoha, which HRS § 
701-104 forbids. (“The provisions of [the Hawai i Penal Code] 
cannot be extended by analogy so as to create crimes not 
provided for herein. . . .”); see also   HRS § 701-102(1) (2014) 
(“No behavior constitutes an offense unless it is a crime or 
violation under this Code or another statute of this State.”); 
commentary on HRS § 701-102 (“There are no common -law offenses 
in Hawaii. . . .”)   Were the legislature to have intended the 
failure to check in while on extended furlough to be a crime, it 
could have expressly included that within the statute defining 
the crime. 
 The insufficiency of the evidence supporting Paris’s 
conviction requires reversal of the conviction. See, e.g., 
State v. Abel, 134 Hawai i 333, 334, 341 P.3d 539, 540 (2014) 
(“As insufficient evidence was adduced at trial to prove [an] 
element of the offense, we reverse the Intermediate Court of 
Appeals’ (ICA) Judgment on Appeal and the [trial court’s] 
judgment of conviction.”) Although our analysis could end here, 
we address the circuit court’s jury instruction next to provide the bench and bar with guidance on defining “custody” in second *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
While he was required to check in to LWFC, he was not required 
to return to physical confinement at LWFC. Kealoha, like Smith, 
is thus inapplicable to the instant case. 
26
      
 
 
  
 
 
 
 This court reviews whether the jury instructions given by 
the trial court, “when read and considered as a whole . . .  are 
prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or 
misleading.” Locquiao,  100 Hawai i at 205, 58 P.3d at 1252. In 
this case, the jury instruction was erroneous, inconsistent, and 
misleading. The jury instruction permitted  the jury to “deem” 
Paris to have been “in custody” “when released from a correctional or detention facility on furlough and legally bound 
by restrictions.” The jury instruction is drawn from Smith, 
which we have already concluded is inapplicable to the facts of *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
degree escape cases predicated on a furloughee’s failure to 
check in to LWFC. 
C.  
Jury Instruction on “Custody” 
On certiorari, Paris contends that the following jury 
instruction on custody invaded the province of the jury and 
directed the verdict: 
An escape can be perpetrated by a person even though he is 
not in actual physical custody or under immediate control 
and supervision of a guard. A person may be deemed to be 
in custody when released from a correctional or detention 
facility on furlough and legally bound by restrictions. 
He argues that the jury instruction informs the jury “that 
‘terms and conditions’ may predicate an Escape in the Second 
Degree conviction, instead of the elements of the charge. This 
directs the verdict and redefines the necessary attendant 
circumstances.” We agree.  
27

      
 
 
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
this case. The jury instruction also finds no basis in the 
statutory definition of “custody,” which is “restraint by a 
public servant pursuant to arrest, detention, or order of a 
court.” HRS § 710-1000.  Therefore, this jury instruction was 
inconsistent with the court’s other jury instruction setting 
forth the statutory definition of custody. Id.   Further, the 
jury instruction equated release pursuant to a furlough 
agreement with custody. In this case, however, the furlough 
agreement contained contradictory provisions regarding Paris’s 
custodial status. Therefore, this jury instruction was also 
erroneous and misleading. Locquiao, 100 Hawai i at 205, 58 P.3d 
at 1252. 
A prejudicially erroneous jury instruction can require a 
remand to the circuit court for a new trial. See
, e.g., Getz , 
131 Hawai i at 21, 313 P.3d at 710; State v. Kalaola , 124 Hawai i 
43, 62, 237 P.3d 1109, 1128 (2010); State v. Mainaaupo, 117 Hawaii 235, 252, 178 P.3d 1, 18 (2008). We need not determine 
whether the erroneous jury instruction reasonably contributed to 
Paris’s conviction, however, and n o new trial is necessary here, 
because we reverse Paris’s conviction a nd sentence due to 
insufficiency of the evidence.
