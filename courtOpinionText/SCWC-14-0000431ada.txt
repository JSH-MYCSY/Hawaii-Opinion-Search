OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J.
 
This case involves a nonjudicial foreclosure by the
 
Association of Apartment Owners of Century Center, Inc. (the
 
AOAO) of a unit in the Century Center condominiums. 
The AOAO
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
purchased the unit at the foreclosure sale, and then filed a
 
complaint for summary possession in the District Court1
 of the
First Circuit against Young Jin An aka Young Ja Kim (An) and
 Ambrosia-Spa Inc. (together, Respondents). 
Respondents moved to dismiss, on the grounds that the 
district court lacked jurisdiction pursuant to Hawai
'i Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 604-5(d), which states that the district court “shall not have cognizance of . . . actions in which the title to real estate comes in question.” Respondents submitted an affidavit pursuant to District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) Rule 12.1, which requires a party raising this jurisdictional defense to submit an affidavit “setting forth the source, nature and extent of the title claimed by defendant to the land in question, and such further particulars as shall fully apprise the court of the nature of defendant’s claim.” 
The district court denied Respondents’ motions and,
 
after a hearing on the merits of the AOAO’s complaint, filed a
 Judgment for Possession and a Writ of Possession in favor of the
 AOAO. 
Respondents appealed to the Intermediate Court of
 
Appeals (ICA), arguing that the district court erred in
 exercising jurisdiction over the case because they had

Motion to Dismiss, Denial of Motion for Rehearing and/or Reconsideration, and
Order Denying Renewed Motion to Dismiss.  The Honorable Melanie M. May
presided over the Writ of Possession and Judgment for Possession.
 
2
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
established that title over the Property was in question. The
 
ICA agreed with Respondents, determining that An’s affidavit and
 the quitclaim deed attached to the AOAO’s complaint provided
 sufficient information regarding the source, nature, and extent
 of the title An claims to the Property. Accordingly, the ICA
 vacated the district court’s Judgment for Possession and Writ of
 Possession, and remanded the case to the district court with
 instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
 
The AOAO now seeks review of the ICA’s decision. We
 
find that the ICA did not err in considering the quitclaim deed
 that was attached to the AOAO’s complaint, since the deed
 supported the claim of title asserted by An’s affidavit. We
 agree with the ICA that An’s affidavit satisfied DCRCP Rule 12.1
 and that the district court therefore lacked jurisdiction over
 the summary possession proceeding. Accordingly, the ICA’s
 judgment on appeal is affirmed.
 
I. Background
 
In 2009, Lisa Yongsonyi Nose purchased a leasehold 
interest in 1750 Kalakaua Avenue, Apartment 116 (Property) as tenant in severalty in an “Assignment of Apartment Lease and Sublease” recorded with the Office of Assistant Registrar, Land Court of the State of Hawai' i (Land Court). According to the 
AOAO, Nose fell behind on her payments to the AOAO for maintenance and other fees, and in a letter to Nose dated 
3
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
April 13, 2010, the AOAO demanded payment of unpaid assessments,
 
totaling $17,871.29. The AOAO subsequently sent three more
 demand letters, and on August 26, 2011, the AOAO filed a “Notice
 of Lien for Unpaid Assessments” against Nose in the Land Court.
 In a letter dated August 31, 2011, AOAO notified Nose that a lien
 had been filed upon the Property. 
Meanwhile, on December 9, 2010, the Land Court recorded
 
an agreement of sale between Nose and An for title to the
 Property for a purchase price of $320,000. 
On December 2, 2011, the AOAO filed with the Land Court
 
a “Notice of Default and Intention to Foreclose.” In a letter to
 Nose on July 27, 2012, the AOAO sent an offer to enter into a
 payment plan agreement to bring her account current and release
 the lien. In a letter to the AOAO on the same day, An’s counsel
 stated that he had edited the July 27, 2012 letter by replacing
 Nose’s name with An’s name, and that An had signed and agreed to
 the agreement. He attached a document signed by Nose stating,
 “[An] is authorized to make payments directly to Hawaiiana
 Management
[2] on all current and future monthly maintenance
 
bills[.]” On August 27, 2012, the AOAO recorded a release of the
 Notice of Default and Intention to Foreclose. 
On September 27, 2012, the AOAO sent a demand letter to
 
Nose and An, informing them that monthly maintenance payments
 
2
 Hawaiiana Management is the management company for the AOAO.
 
4
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
were not paid and that the terms and conditions of the July 27,
 
2012 letter are “deemed immediately null and void.” The letter
 also informed them that they must pay $37,435.18 within ten days
 or the AOAO “may take legal action against you without further
 notice.” 
On October 24, 2012, the AOAO recorded another “Notice
 
of Default and Intention to Foreclose” against Nose, stating that
 if she does not pay $45,380.79 within 60 days, “the Association
 intends to conduct a power of sale foreclosure to sell the
 property at a public sale[.]” Nose was served on November 1,
 2012. The AOAO was unable to find and serve An. Notice of the
 pending “non-judicial foreclosure under power of sale” was
 published in the Honolulu Star-Advertiser on June 19, June 26,
 and July 3, 2012. On February 13, 2013, a copy of the notice was
 posted on the Property. 
At a public sale on April 17, 2013, the AOAO purchased
 
the Property for $1. On May 9, 2013, the Land Court recorded the
 AOAO’s “Affidavit of Non-Judicial Foreclosure Under Power of
 Sale,” which stated that the foreclosure “was conducted as
 required by the power of sale foreclosure law” and provided a
 summary of steps taken by the AOAO. On May 15, 2013, the Land
 Court recorded the AOAO’s “Quitclaim Assignment of Lease,”
 assigning the Property from the AOAO to itself. On May 23, 2013,
 the AOAO sent a letter addressed to the “Occupant” of the
 
5
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Property, stating that it was now the owner and that any
 
occupants could either provide a copy of their valid lease within
 five days or vacate the unit. 
On June 18, 2013, the AOAO filed a complaint seeking
 
summary possession of the Property. Respondents filed an answer
 which argued, among other things, that An owned the Property and
 that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the case
 pursuant to HRS § 604-5(d). 
Pursuant to DCRCP Rule 12.1, the answer attached an
 
affidavit signed by An, which stated in its entirety:
 
1. I am Defendant in this action.  Plaintiff has
 
incorrectly identified me in the Complaint as Young
Jin An, but my name is Young Ja Kim. 
2. I acquired title to the real property identified
as 1750 Kalakaua Avenue, Apartment 116, Honolulu
Hawaii 96826 (the “Real Property”) from Lisa Yongsonyi
Nose by virtue of an Agreement of Sale dated December
7, 2010 and recorded as Land Court Document No.
4028097.  The purchase price for the Real Property was
 $320,000.
 
3. I am the sole owner of the equitable interests in
the Real Property. 
4. My interest in the Real Property was wrongfully
foreclosed upon by the Plaintiff, as set forth in
detail in the Counterclaim filed concurrently
herewith. 
5. From and after my acquisition of the Real
Property, Hawaiiana Management Company (“Hawaiiana”),
the managing agent of the Real Property for Plaintiff
Association of Apartment Owners of Century Center,
Inc. (“Plaintiff” or the “AOAO”), failed and/or
refused to transmit all of the monthly statements to
me, which resulted in delinquent payments to the AOAO.
 
6
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
6. In or about June of 2012, I reached an agreement
with the AOAO to pay down the delinquent assessments
over a twelve month period and to remain current on
the monthly maintenance fee assessments.
 
7. Even after this agreement, Plaintiff’s agent,
Hawaiiana, did not send me monthly statements on a
regular basis, which caused payments to be made late.
 
8. In November 2012, I executed a Hawaiiana Change of
Address Form for Billing & Correspondence (“Change of
Address Form”).
 
9. Even after submitting the Change of Address form,
Hawaiiana did not send me the monthly maintenance fee
assessment statements.  I had to go to Hawaiiana and
have them printed for me.  Thereafter, I continued to
make the settlement payments and the monthly
maintenance fee payments in the amounts set forth in
the monthly statements. 
10. Unbeknownst to me and without notice, the AOAO
was charging me a late fee each month in the amount of
5% of the total amount claimed to be outstanding. 
Also unbeknownst to me, the AOAO was charging me
significant amounts of attorneys’ fees.  Neither the
 late fees nor the attorneys’ fees were shown on the
monthly statements delivered to me.
 
11. Without my knowledge, the AOAO applied
approximately $15,623.86 of my Settlement Payments
and/or Monthly Assessment Payments to late charges
which purportedly accrued from July 2012 to May 2013. 
12. As of
 April 2013, I made all of the Settlement
Payments and all or a sufficient number of Monthly
Assessment Payments to keep current, but for the
AOAO’s secret assessment of illegal and unenforceable
late charges, as well as, legal fees and costs related
thereto.
 
13. In spite of all the payments I made, the AOAO
noticed a foreclosure sale of the Real Property and
alleged that I was delinquent in the amount of
$41,129.62 as of April.
 
14. I spo
ke to Hawaiiana regarding the notice of
foreclosure sale of the Real Property and was told
 
7
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
that as long as I was making any settlement payments
and monthly payments, the foreclosure sale would not
 occur.
 
15. Because I was current on the monthly settlement
payments and monthly maintenance fee payments set
forth in the statements sent to me, I understood that
the foreclosure sale would not occur.
 
16. Unbeknownst to me, the sale went forward and the
AOAO claimed to be the highest bidder for the Real
Property in the amount of $1.
 
17. By counterclaim attached hereto, I am challenging
the AOAO’s wrongful foreclosure and the AOAO’s claim
of title to the Real Property.
 
18. I dispute the Plaintiff’s alleged title to the
Real Property is superior to my title to the Real
Property.
 
Along with their answer, Respondents filed a
 
counterclaim against the AOAO, which alleged claims for
 
negligence/breach of fiduciary duty, unfair and deceptive trade
 practices, negligent misrepresentation, wrongful foreclosure,
 quiet title, declaratory relief, and unjust enrichment. 
The district court approved An’s demand for jury trial
 
“as to non-possession issues only” and committed those issues to
 the Circuit Court of the First Circuit. 
On August 14, 2013, Respondents filed a “Motion to
 
Dismiss For Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction” based on 
HRS § 604-5(d). They attached An’s affidavit, which was
 identical to the one attached to their answer, except for the
 date. The AOAO opposed the motion, arguing that “there is no
 dispute as to title to the subject property” because Respondents
 
8
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
“merely held an equitable interest in the subject property and do
 
not claim to title as required by [DCRCP] Rule 12.1[.]” 
Respondents replied that the affidavit satisfied DCRCP Rule 12.1,
 explaining: “The source of her title is the Agreement of Sale. 
The nature of her title is equitable. The extent of her
 equitable ownership interest is 100%.” 
On September 16, 2013, the district court held a
 
hearing on the motion to dismiss, at which the AOAO argued that
 HRS § 667-102
3
 was recently passed in 2012 “specifically to bar
3 HRS § 667-102 (2012) provides:
 
(a) The affidavit required under section 667-101 and
the conveyance document shall be recorded no earlier
than ten days after the public sale is held but not
later than forty-five days after the public sale is
held.  The affidavit and the conveyance document may
be recorded separately and on different days. After
the recordation, the association shall mail or deliver
a recorded copy to those persons entitled to receive
the public notice of the public sale under section
667-96(c).
 
(b) When both the affidavit and the conveyance
document are recorded:
 
(1) The sale of the unit is considered
completed;
(2) All persons claiming by, through, or under
the unit owner and all other persons having liens on
the unit junior to the lien of the association shall
be forever barred of and from any and all right,
title, interest, and claims at law or in equity in and
to the unit and every part of the unit, except as
otherwise provided by law;
(3) The lien of the association and all liens
junior in priority to the lien of an association shall
be automatically extinguished from the unit; and
(4) The purchaser shall be entitled to immediate
and exclusive possession of the unit.
 
(c) The unit owner and any person claiming by,
through, or under the unit owner and who is remaining
(cont
inued...)
 
9
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
frivolous claims as such to title by tenants in a property.” The
 
AOAO stated that An’s claims were barred because it had recorded
 its affidavit of sale and quitclaim deed prior to filing its
 complaint, thereby satisfying HRS § 667-102. Following the
 hearing, Respondents filed a supplemental reply, arguing that the
 recording of the AOAO’s affidavit of sale and conveyance document
 does not “cut[] off all rights of a unit owner to dispute
 title[.]” 
On September 30, 2013, the district court held another
 
hearing on the motion to dismiss and denied the motion based on
 HRS § 667-102. On October 10, 2013, the district court entered
 its order denying Respondents’ motion to dismiss. 
On January 15, 2014, Respondents filed a “Renewed
 
Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction,”
 arguing that An satisfied DCRCP Rule 12.1 based on (1) the
 agreement of sale between An and Nose, (2) a promissory note from
 An to Nose in the amount of $50,000, (3) a mortgage executed by
 
3(...continued)
in po
ssession of the unit after the recordation of the
affidavit and the conveyance document shall be
considered a tenant at sufferance subject to eviction
or ejectment.  The purchaser may bring an action in
the nature of summary possession under chapter 666,
ejectment, or trespass or may bring any other
appropriate action in a court where the unit is
located to obtain a writ of possession, a writ of
assistance, or any other relief.  In any such action,
the court shall award the prevailing party its
reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs and all other
reasonable fees and costs, all of which are to be paid
for by the non-prevailing party.
 
10
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
An and delivered to Nose “as a security interest in the subject
 
property,” and (4) an undated, unrecorded “Assignment of
 Apartment Lease and Sublease in Satisfaction of Agreement of
 Sale” executed by Nose and delivered to An. Respondents stated
 that “[An’s] and Ms. Nose’s efforts to finalize the Agreement
 have been thwarted by the AOAO’s unlawful nonjudicial
 foreclosure[,]” but that “the Note, Mortgage and Assignment . . .
 show that the Agreement is still in force and effect.” 
The AOAO opposed the motion, arguing that it was, in
 
effect, an untimely motion for reconsideration of the district
 court’s October 10, 2013 order and that the district court has
 “exclusive jurisdiction over summary possession matters.” 
At a hearing on January 27, 2014, the court denied the
 
motion, stating that under HRS § 667-102 “title cannot be an
 issue under . . . a pretty narrow set of circumstances” and that
 those circumstances were present here. 
On January 29, 2014, the district court held a trial on
 
the merits of the complaint, ruled in favor of the AOAO, and
 filed a Judgment for Possession and a Writ of Possession. 
A. ICA Proceedings
 
On appeal, Respondents argued that the district court
 
erred in denying their motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction
 under HRS § 604-5(d). The ICA agreed, holding that the district
 court lacked jurisdiction over the eviction action because
 
11
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Respondents satisfied DCRCP Rule 12.1. 
The ICA reasoned that “[t]he Quitclaim Assignment of
 
Lease attached to the AOAO’s complaint along with An’s affidavit
 
provided sufficient information to apprise this court of the
 source, nature, and extent of the title An claims to the
 Property.” Specifically, the quitclaim assignment of lease
 showed that “on April 2, 2009, the land court recorded the
 interest in the Property as assigned to Nose as Tenant in
 Severalty” and “on December 7, 2010, the land court recorded the
 Agreement of Sale of the Property from Nose to An.” 
Additionally, the ICA determined that An “set forth with
 particularity the basis for her claim challenging the AOAO’s
 assertion of title to the Property, that the AOAO wrongfully
 foreclosed on the Property because An had completed the payments
 due to the AOAO under the Settlement Agreement.” 
Thus, the ICA vacated the district court’s Writ of
 
Possession, Judgment for Possession, and denials of Respondents’
 motions, and it remanded the case to the district court with
 instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. 
II. Standards of Review
 
A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction 
“The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law
 
that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard.” Lingle
 
v. Hawai' i Gov’t Emps. Ass’n, AFSCME, Local 152, AFL-CIO, 107 
12
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Hawai'i 178, 182, 111 P.3d 587, 591 (2005) (quoting Amantiad v. 
Odum, 90 Hawai' i 152, 158, 977 P.2d 160, 166 (1999)). 
III. Discussion
 
The AOAO’s application presents the following three
 
questions:
 
1. The ICA gravely erred in holding the district
court lacked jurisdiction because Defendant An did not
sufficiently set forth the source, nature and extent
of her claim to title in her affidavit as required
under District Court Rules of Civil Procedure
 (“DCRCP”) 12.1.
 
2. The ICA committed grave error by improperly
considering documents submitted by the AOAO to
determine whether Defendant An had sufficiently raised
an issue of title to bar the jurisdiction of the
district court.
 
3. The ICA’s Opinion is notably inconsistent not only
with its own prior decisions, but also with a Hawaii
Supreme Court decision, which requires Defendants to
assert some credible claim to title. 
The issue in this case is whether the district court
 
has jurisdiction over the AOAO’s summary possession action under
 
HRS § 604-5(d). HRS § 604-5(d) provides that the district court
 does not have jurisdiction over cases in which the title to real
 estate is in question: 
§ 604-5 Civil jurisdiction.
 
. . .
 . 
(d)
 The district courts shall not have cognizance of
real actions, nor actions in which the title to real
estate comes in question, nor actions for libel,
slander, defamation of character, malicious
prosecution, false imprisonment, breach of promise of
marriage, or seduction; nor shall they have power to
appoint referees in any cause.
 
13
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(Emphasis added).
 
Whenever a defendant asserts HRS § 604-5(d) as a
 
challenge to jurisdiction in the district court, the defendant
 
must satisfy DCRCP Rule 12.1. DCRCP Rule 12.1 requires the
 defendant to provide an affidavit that sets forth the “source,
 nature and extent of the title claimed” to the property and “such
 further particulars” to apprise the court of the nature of the
 claim:
 
Whenever, in the district court, in defense of an
action in the nature of an action of trespass or for
the summary possession of land, or any other action,
the defendant shall seek to interpose a defense to the
jurisdiction to the effect that the action is a real
action, or one in which the title to real estate is
involved, such defense shall be asserted by a written
answer or written motion, which shall not be received
by the court unless accompanied by an affidavit of the
defendant, setting forth the source, nature and extent
of the title claimed by defendant to the land in
question, and such further particulars as shall fully
apprise the court of the nature of defendant’s claim.
 
(Emphases added). 
Respondents attached an affidavit signed by An to their
 
answer to the AOAO’s complaint and to their motion to dismiss,
 
and the AOAO argues that this affidavit did not satisfy DCRCP
 Rule 12.1. 
This court has stated that an affidavit filed pursuant
 
to DCRCP Rule 12.1 must provide some specificity as to the
 defendant’s claim to title: 
The phrase “further particulars” indicates that the
reference to “source, extent, and nature” of the claim
 
14
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
are “particulars” of the defense, whose purpose is to
“fully apprise” the court of the defendant’s claim to
title.  DCRCP Rule 12.1 (Emphasis added).  Although
 DCRCP Rule 12.1 does not define the term
 “particulars,” that term suggests that the affidavit
must include some details or specificity regarding the
nature of the defendant’s claim. 
Thus, the source, nature, and extent of title claimed
by the defendant must be described to the court with
some detail and specificity.  In addition to
 particularly describing the source, nature, and extent
of title, the defendant may also include in the
affidavit any other particulars, the objective being
to apprise the court fully of the nature of the
defendant’s claim.
 
Deutsche Bank Nat. Tr. Co. v. Peelua, 126 Hawai' i 32, 36-37, 265 
P.3d 1128, 1132-33 (2011). 
An affidavit cannot state “only in a vague and 
conclusory fashion” that the defendant owns the property at 
issue, id. at 38, 265 P.3d at 1134, or “merely assert[] that title was at issue,” Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores, 107 Hawai' i 
95, 99, 110 P.3d 1042, 1046 (2005). 
For example, this court found that an affidavit set
 
forth the source, nature and extent of the title where a “fair
 reading of the affidavit” demonstrated that the defendant claimed
 “an undivided one-sixth interest in fee simple, which descended
 to her by intestate succession from the immediately preceding
 sole owner.” Monette v. Benjamin, 52 Haw. 246, 248, 473 P.2d
 
864, 865 (1970). However, we held that an affidavit did not
 provide the requisite level of specificity regarding the title
 claimed where it simply declared “[T]his action involves a
 
15
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
dispute as to title to real property” and “We claim that we have 
title to the Property.” Aames, 107 Hawai' i at 99, 110 P.3d at 
1046 (brackets omitted). We also held that an affidavit was insufficient where it asserted that the defendant had a deed to the property, but did not “describe the contents of the deed or the type of deed he acquired.” Peelua, 126 Hawai' i at 38, 265 
P.3d at 1134. 
Similarly, with regard to a defendant’s claims, the 
affidavit must provide some detail as to “how or whether the allegation has any bearing on title to the Property.” Id.; see 
also U.S. Bank Nat. Ass’n v. Castro, 131 Hawai' i 28, 38, 313 P.3d 
717, 727 (2013) (“[The defendants] have failed to demonstrate what bearing the allegations, even if true, would have on title to the Property.”). Accordingly, this court held that an affidavit did not provide the requisite “particulars” where it claimed solely that the defendant was “‘defrauded, duped, coerced and tricked’ into engaging in transactions involving the Property.” Peelua, 126 Hawai' i at 38-39, 265 P.3d at 1134-35. 
Similarly, an affidavit stating that the defendant “believe[d]” the purchaser was unable to foreclose on the property was “speculative and lacking the type of detail and specificity required by Rule 12.1.” Castro, 131 Hawai' i at 38, 313 P.3d at 
727 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
As an initial matter, the ICA did not err by
 
16
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
considering the quitclaim deed that was attached to the AOAO’s
 
complaint. The ICA explained its basis for relying on the
 quitclaim deed in a footnote: 
“Once a defendant establishes that title is in 
question, a court cannot consider evidence orarguments in rebuttal of the defendant’s claim totitle, or evidence in support of the plaintiff’s claimto a superior basis of title because that would be forthe circuit court to decide.”  Peelua, 126 Hawai 'i at 
39, 265 P.3d at 1135.  However, where a plaintiffattaches a quitclaim deed to its complaint, a courtmay consider it in determining a defendant’s assertionthat the district court lacks jurisdiction under HRS§ 604-5(d).  Id. at 39, 265 P.3d at 1135 (“[Theplaintiff] was required to plead entitlement topossession of the Property and could appropriatelyattach a copy of its quitclaim deed in support of itsclaimed ownership.”). 
We agree with the ICA’s application of Peelua. In 
Peelua, this court held that, in reviewing a defendant’s DCRCP 
Rule 12.1 motion, the court cannot consider counter-evidence to rebut the question of title. 126 Hawai' i at 39, 265 P.3d at 
1135. However, a district court may consider attachments to the plaintiff’s complaint if such attachments support the claim of title asserted by the defendant’s affidavit, since the attachments may provide non-speculative substantiation of the title claim. 
Therefore, the ICA did not err in considering the
 
quitclaim deed attached to the AOAO’s complaint because it
 supported the question of title raised by An’s affidavit. 
We now turn to whether An’s affidavit satisfies DCRCP
 
17
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Rule 12.1. With regard to the source, nature, and extent of the
 
title claimed by An, the affidavit states in relevant part: 
2. I acquired title to the real property identified
as 1750 Kalakaua Avenue, Apartment 116, Honolulu
Hawaii 96826 (the “Real Property”) from Lisa Yongsonyi
Nose by virtue of an Agreement of Sale dated December
7, 2010 and recorded as Land Court Document No.
4028097.  The purchase price for the Real Property was

3. I am the sole owner of the equitable interests in
the Real Property.

Real Property is superior to my title to the Real
Property.
 
A “fair reading of the affidavit” demonstrates that the 
source of title was the agreement of sale, the nature of title 
was An’s resulting equitable interest in the Property, and the extent of the title was An’s “sole owner[ship]” of the interest. Monette, 52 Haw. at 248, 473 P.2d at 865. Thus, the affidavit provided enough information to satisfy DCRCP Rule 12.1 and did not “merely assert[] that title was at issue[.]” Aames, 107 
Hawai'i at 99, 110 P.3d at 1046. 
The AOAO argues that the agreement of sale cannot serve
 
as the source of a claim to title because the agreement gave An
 only an equitable interest in the Property and legal title
 remained with Nose. The AOAO is correct that “[u]nder an
 agreement of sale, the legal title to the property remains in the
 seller,” and “upon the execution and delivery of the agreement of
 
18
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
sale, there accrues to the [buyer] an equitable interest in the
 
land.” Jenkins v. Wise, 58 Haw. 592, 596, 574 P.2d 1337, 1341
 
(1978). However, this equitable interest entitles the buyer to
 “immediate possession” of the property, id., and once the buyer
 satisfies conditions the agreement of sale, the buyer is entitled
 to title, see HRS § 502-85(c).
 
Moreover, in Jellings v. Kaihe, the Supreme Court of 
the Territory of Hawai' i addressed a question similar to that 
presented here––whether an affidavit “disclose[d] that the defendants had any claim of title to the land” for the purpose of determining whether “the district magistrate would be required to adjudicate in the trial of the suit for rent.” 30 Haw. 160, 162 (Terr. Haw. 1927). The court noted that one defendant had entered into an oral agreement of sale with the plaintiff, but concluded that this was not sufficient to assert title for the following reasons: 
It does not appear from the affidavit that the
agreement therein described was in force at the time
the plea to the jurisdiction was interposed.  The date
 
of the agreement is not given nor is it alleged that
[defendant] had performed all the conditions imposed
upon her by the contract.   Certainly there is no
presumption of the continuance of the contract.  If at
 the time the plea to the jurisdiction was interposed
the contract had been rescinded by consent of the
parties and was no longer in force no claim of
interest or title to the property could be predicated
upon it.  The position of the defendants in this case
would be the same as if no contract had ever been
 made.  If the defendants wished to successfully
challenge the jurisdiction of the district magistrate
it was incumbent upon them to show affirmatively by
 
19
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
their affidavit that their claim of title was based on
 
a contract that was still in force and effect .
 
Id. (emphases added). 
In other words, the court concluded that an agreement 
of sale could serve as the basis for a claim to title, but that 
the existence of an agreement in that case was too tenuous. Notably, this passage of Jellings has been favorably cited twice by this court. See Monette, 52 Haw. at 249, 473 P.2d at 866; 
Peelua, 126 Hawai' i at 38, 265 P.3d at 1134. 
Thus, we hold that the equitable interest created by an
 
agreement of sale–-although not “legal title”––is nevertheless
 sufficient to constitute “title” for the purposes of DCRCP Rule
 12.1.
 
The AOAO argues that, in any event, An’s affidavit was
 
insufficient under Jellings because it failed to state that the
 agreement of sale “was valid at the time of the AOAO’s summary
 possession action.” The AOAO misconstrues Jellings. The court
 in Jellings did state that it was “incumbent” on the defendants
 to show that their agreement “was still in force and effect,” 30
 Haw. at 162, but it never indicated that an explicit statement to
 that effect was required. Indeed, it can be inferred, based on a
 “fair reading” of An’s affidavit, that she alleged that her
 agreement was valid at the time of the summary possession action. 
Monette, 52 Haw. at 248, 473 P.2d at 865. An’s affidavit stated
 that “I am sole owner of the equitable interests in the Real
 
20
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Property[,]” which was “by virtue of an Agreement of Sale.” This
 
language was sufficient to allege that the agreement was in force
 and effect under Jellings and for the purposes of DCRCP Rule
 12.1. 
With regard to the nature of Respondents’ claim, the 
affidavit stated that An’s interest “was wrongfully foreclosed upon” by the AOAO. The affidavit explained that she “made all of the Settlement Payments and all or a sufficient number of Monthly Assessment Payments to keep current, but for the AOAO’s secret assessment of illegal and unenforceable late charges, as well as, legal fees and costs related thereto.” The affidavit further stated, “I spoke to Hawaiiana regarding the notice of foreclosure sale of the Real Property and was told that as long I was making my settlement payments and monthly payments, the foreclosure sale would not occur.” Respondents therefore claim that they were not delinquent on their payments and that the AOAO did not have the authority to conduct a non-judicial sale. This explanation provides sufficient detail as to “how or whether the allegation has any bearing on title to the Property[,]” Peelua, 126 Hawai' i 
at 38, 265 P.3d at 1134, because if the AOAO’s foreclosure was invalid, Respondents continue to have a conditional right to title under the agreement of sale. 
Thus, An’s affidavit satisfied DCRCP Rule 12.1, and the
 
district court lacked jurisdiction over the AOAO’s summary
 
21
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
possession action under HRS § 604-5(d).
 
As a final note, the AOAO also asserts that the ICA
 
failed to consider HRS § 501-118 and HRS § 667-102(b)(2) because
 
these statutes barred Respondents from challenging the AOAO’s
 right to foreclosure. We find the AOAO’s argument unpersuasive. 
HRS § 501-118 provides, “Nothing in this chapter shall
 
be construed to prevent the mortgagor or other person in interest
 from directly impeaching by action or otherwise, any foreclosure
 proceedings affecting registered land, prior to the entry of a
 new certificate of title.” (Emphasis added). There was no new
 certificate of title entered in this case, and thus, HRS § 501­118 does not apply here. 
HRS § 667-102(b)(2) provides: 
All persons claiming by, through, or under the unit
owner and all other persons having liens on the unit
junior to the lien of the association shall be forever
barred of and from any and all right, title, interest,
and claims at law or in equity in and to the unit and
every part of the unit, except as otherwise provided
by law[.]
 
(Emphasis added). 
HRS § 667-104(4) states that it is “a prohibited
 
practice for any association” to “[c]omplet[e] or attempt[] to
 
complete nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings against a unit owner
 in violation of section 667-92(c).” HRS § 667-92(c) in turn
 provides that nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings “shall be
 stayed” during the term of a payment plan between the unit owner
 
22
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and the association. An’s affidavit alleges that she was current
 
under her payment plan with the AOAO as of the foreclosure date. 
An’s claim therefore falls under HRS § 667-102(b)(2)’s “otherwise
 provided by law” exception. Accordingly, HRS § 667-102(b)(2)
 does not bar Respondents’ challenge. 
IV. Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons, the ICA did not err in
 
considering the AOAO’s quitclaim deed as part of its analysis or
 in determining that An’s affidavit satisfied DCRCP Rule 12.1. 
Therefore, the ICA’s judgment on appeal is affirmed.
