OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J.
  
 
  
 
 For at least the past 65 years, residents  and visitors 
of O ʻahu  have  been free to walk along the cement path atop a 
seawall (the Seawall)  on or near the seaward boundaries of 
property between 2943 Kal ākaua Avenue and 3019 Kal ākaua Avenue 
to access the beach, shoreline, and ocean in order  to swim,  
surf, fish, and enjoy other activities   of island living.  Over 
the course of these many decades, the State has paid for and completed repairs and maintenance on the Seawall, enabling the  
public to continue to safely use the footpath.   As recently as  
2006, the Hawai ʻi  State Legislature appropriated funds  to repair  
the Seawall. However, the State shortly thereafter disclaimed any duty to maintain the Seawall, prompting commencement of this  
lawsuit to require the State  to maintain and keep the Seawall in 
good and safe condition.

IN PLACE OF WILSON, J., RECUSED, WITH NAKAYAMA, J., DISSENTING,

I. INTRODUCTION
 
The 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court) 
ruled that based on the applicable law and the uncontested 
evidence in this case, the State had obtained an easement for 
2
  
 
    
 
  
 
  Given our disposition with respect to the merits of 
Gold Coast’s claims in this case, we also determine whether the 
circuit court properly denied Gold Coast’s motion for attorneys’ 
fees and costs against the State. Although the ICA determined  
that an award of both fees and costs was permissible in this ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
public use over  and across the Seawall   by virtue of common law 
implied dedication.  The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) unanimously agreed.   We conclude that in light of (1) Hawaii’s 
long-standing principles of common law, (2) the historical significance and deep roots of implied dedication in this 
jurisdiction as evidenced by nearly 150 years of this court’s 
precedent, and (3) the undisputed evidence in this case, the 
circuit court and the ICA correctly determined  that the State 
obtained an easement over and across the Seawall  by common law 
implied dedication.  
In addition to determining that the State owned an 
easement over and across the Seawall by implied dedication, the 
circuit court also ruled that the State owned the real property 
under the Seawall by virtue of surrender under Hawaii Revised Statutes § 264-1(c)(2) (2007).  Given this court’s precedent, 
however, ownership of the Seawall was not transferred to the 
State by virtue of surrender. Thus, the circuit court and the ICA erred in concluding that the State owns the Seawall and the 
real property under the Seawall. 
3
  
 
   
 
  
   
  At issue in this case is a length of seawall that 
stretches from the seaward boundaries of property between 2943 
Kalākaua Avenue and 3019 Kalākaua Avenue  (the Seawall).   The 
Seawall runs along Waikiki’s “Gold Coast,” an area of condominiums and cooperative apartments located on ocean front 
1lots near the Diamond Head end of Kalākaua Avenue .   The Seawall  
was originally constructed by private parties  over eighty years 
ago. Since approximately 1930, the Seawall has been used by 
both residents and members of the general public, without 
interference or restriction,  to access the ocean and to traverse  
along the Waikīkī  coastline.    
                     
  
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
case, we conclude that this ruling and the circuit court’s 
ruling were both partially erroneous because the State waived its sovereign immunity with respect to costs but not attorneys’ 
fees. 
II. BACKGROUND 
A. Construction, Public Use, and State Repairs to the Seawall

borders eleven properties identified by the following Tax Map Key Nos. and 
owned or managed by the corresponding entities: Tropic Seas, Inc. (TMK No. 3 -
1-032:030), Diamond Head Beach Hotel (TMK No. 3 -1-032:029), Diamond Head 
Ambassador Hotel, Ltd. (TMK Nos. 3 -1-032:028, 27, 26), Diamond Head Apts.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
For decades, the State has maintained the Seawall, 
conducted necessary repairs to the Seawall, and otherwise 
assumed responsibility to preserve and manage the Seawall.  In 
at least 1982, 1984, and 1993, the State conducted various 
repairs to the Seawall, and local and state appropriations were 
made by the relevant legislative bodies in contemplation of 
further repairs in at least 1989, 1992, and 2006. By 
stipulation of the parties in this case, the repairs were 
described as follows: 
  In June 1982, the State of Hawai i Department of Land 
and Natural Resources (DLNR) , Land Division, performed 
“emergency repair work” to “shore approximately 40 feet of 
the Seawall along the boundary of Diamond Head Apartments.” 
By 1981 Haw. Sess. Laws Act  1, Item K- 2, the State 
legislature authorized the expenditure of $25,000.00 for these repairs.  
  Sometime in 1982,
 the DLNR, Land Division, performed 
repairs and “rehabilitated broken sections of the Seawall” 
from the Elks Club property to near the Diamond Head end of 
Kalākaua Avenue. 
The funding for the repairs was 
appropriated by 1981 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 1, Item K -2, and 
by 1981 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 264, Item K -2. 
  “Sometime after May 1984,” the State performed 
additional repair work on “one or more portion s of the 
Seawalls  pursuant to work identified as Job No. 1 -0L-31, 
Waikiki Seawall Walkway Rehabilitation, Phase III.” The original scope of this project consisted of “rehabilitating 
seawalls, constructing hand railing and other incidental 
and appurtenant work necessary to complete this project.”
2    
2 A table included with the parties’ stipulation shows that during 
Phase III, the State conducted the following repairs: “[c]rack repair on walkway--chip off loose material and epoxy the crack”; “[r]epair nosing at 
edge of walkway”; “[r]emove loose concrete topping and pour 4” thick x 3’6” 
wide concrete later”; “[r]epair walkway --remove loose concrete topping and 
replace with 2” thick cement mortar (Taper new concrete left to right, see G -
2)”; and “[a]dd new concrete walkway on top of existing wall.” 
5
  
 
     
  
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
  On December 8, 1992, following Hurricane Iniki, the 
Honolulu City Council passed a resolution authorizing the 
DLNR “to rehabilitate the existing Seawall walkway located 
in Diamond Head, Oahu and identified by TM
K Nos. 3-1-
032:001, 002, 003, 004, 026, 027, 028 and 029, and 3 -1- 
033:002, 003 , 004, 005, 006, 007, 008, 009, 010, 011, 053, and 056.” The repair and rehabilitative work conducted 
pursuant to this project was limited to portions of the 
Seawall in front of the Diamond Head Ambassador Hotel.  The 
construction was authorized by the Hawaiʻ i legislature  by 
1989 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 316, Item K -11.  Repairs were 
completed in September 1993 at a contract price of 
$609,605.00. Pursuant to this project, “the Stat e built or 
rebuilt essentially the entire wall in front of . . . three 
properties” along the Seawall, although “to the extent the 
State built the wall makai of the then shoreline the wall 
[was] on State property.”  
  In an October 13, 1993 letter from the DLNR, the 
Manager-Chief Engineer of the DLNR stated that further 
repair work on the Seawall was scheduled
  for TMK Nos. 3-1-
32:029, 004, 003, 002, 001, 3 -1-033:011 and 009.  
  In 2006, the Hawai ʻi  legislature appropriated $2 million 
for “plans, design and constru ction for the resurfacing of 
the seawall and installation of railings along Waikiki ’s 
Gold Coast .” 
The appropriation was included within H.B. 
1900 in a section titled “Waikiki Seawall Improvements, Oahu.”  
(Emphases added.) 
Since at least 1975, various assertions made by the 
State have further manifested its long-held position that the 
Seawall serves as a public right-of-way and that the State has 
the duty and responsibility to maintain the Seawall for use by 
the public. The parties stipulated that the following relevant 
documents would be entered into evidence in this case: 
  A February 27, 1975 memorandum  authored by Wallace W. 
Weatherwax, Deputy Attorney General (DAG Weatherwax), to 
the Department of Transportation’s Harbors Division 
intended to res olve the Harbors Division’s inquiry as to 
“whether or not the State has the responsibility to 
maintain and improve a public right of way which passes 
over a seawall located within” TMK No. 3 -
1-33-2 and TMK No. 
3-1-33-53.  In the memorandum, DAG Weatherwax stated the 
fact of “the use by the public of this right of way since 
6
  
 
   
 
  
 
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
1930” and concluded that “the State has the responsibility 
to maintain the public right of way over the seawall .”  
  A 1982 Environmental Assessment issued by the DLNR  
regarding the repair  of a portion of the Seawall near the 
Diamond Head Apartments, in which the
 DLNR stated that 
“[t]he top of the seawall serves as a public walkway for 
residents and beachgoers to traverse along the shores of 
Waikiki Beach ” and that “[r]esidents, surfers, be achgoers 
and fishermen use the top of the seawall to traverse between the Diamond Head end of Waikiki Beach and Sans Souci Beach.”  
  A document dated May 1984 relating to the “Waikiki 
Seawall Walkway Rehabilitation” project stating that “ the 
State has a ri
ght-of-way over the seawall  and has obtained 
a right-of
-entry onto” certain properties “for the 
rehabilitation of the seawall walkway.” 
  A “Notice of Determination (Negative Declaration)” 
relating to the “Waikiki Seawall Walkway Rehabilitation 
Project” is sued by the DLNR, Water and Land Development 
Division, with a handwritten notation at the top identifying the document as “1992 -10
-23-OA-FEA-Waikiki 
Seawall Walkway,” describing proposed repairs to the Seawall in the amount of $550,000.00 and stating that “the 
State of Hawaiʻ i  has a right -of-way over all the seawalls 
and walkways and is responsible to keep them in good and 
safe condition ” and that “the walkways are used by the 
general public.”  
(Emphases added.) Thus, for many decades, the Seawall has been 
enjoyed by members of the general public and repaired, maintained, and overseen by the State. 
Gold Coast Neighborhood Association (Gold Coast) is “a 
non-profit incorporated organization doing business in the City 
and County of Honolulu, and is comprised of individuals and 
organizations that own, live in, or have an interest in real 
property along Kalakaua Avenue on the Waikiki coastline in the 
City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawai i.” Many of the 
members of Gold Coast represent the apartments and condominiums

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
located along the Seawall. Following an appropriation of funds 
to repair the Seawall by the Hawai i State Legislature in 2006,  
counsel for Gold Coast and representatives from the State 
discussed the need for maintenance to the Seawall.   However, at 
a point during these discussions, the State informed Gold Coast’s  counsel that it now disclaimed any duty to maintain the 
Seawall.  
B. Circuit Court Proceedings 
On June 22, 2007, Gold Coast filed a complaint against 
the State seeking a declarati on from the circuit court that “the 
State is required to maintain the Seawall and keep it in good and safe condition.” In its complaint, Gold Coast identified 
the Seawall as bordering twenty-one properties on Kalākaua 
Avenue. Gold Coast also sought an or der awarding it attorneys’ 
fees and costs “as allowed by law.” 
In July and August of 2007, the parties filed cross-
motions for summary judgment.
3 Gold Coast contended in its 
summary judgment motion that the State was obligated to maintain the Seawall by virtue of its ownership of the Seawall, or, in 
the alternative, by virtue of an easement over the Seawall.  The 
State rejected these arguments in its summary judgment motion 
3 The Honorable Eden E. Hifo presided over the summary judgment 
proceedings in this case. 
8
  
 
   
     
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
and contended, inter alia, that Gold Coast had failed to join 
indispensable parties to the action because it had not joined 
all those property owners whose interests in property under or 
near the Seawall might be affected by the litigation. 
Prior to the circuit court’s ruling on the parties’ 
summary judgment motions, Gold Coast filed a first amended 
complaint (First Amended Complaint) removing ten of the twenty-
one properties and adding one property.  At a continued hearing 
on the parties’ summary judgment motions on August 20, 2008, the 
court heard oral argument on whether the First Amended Complaint 
“cured the problem” alleged by the State regarding indispensable 
parties to the lawsuit. The State contended that the First Amended Complaint was not sufficient to cure Gold Coast’s 
failure to join indispensable parties, arguing in part that the 
various homeowners’ associations were not legally authorized to 
represent private property owners in the litigation. Gold Coast responded that each of the properties named in the First Amended Complaint was represented by associations that had agreed on 
behalf of their members to join Gold Coast and support the 
lawsuit and that the associations were entitled to represent 
their property owners’ interests . Thus, “each individual 
owner’s interest [was] secured and represented” by the rele vant 
association that was authorized to act on the owner’s behalf. 
9
  
 
    At the close of the August 20, 2008 hearing, the court 
ruled that Gold Coast had not failed to join indispensable 
parties, reasoning that “given the First Amended Complaint . . . 
there have been amendments to ensure that the condominiums or 
co-ops that are contiguous to the seawalls that are identified 
by the TMKs in [the First Amended Complaint] are members of 
[Gold Coast], which is the  party.” The court further elaborated 
that it did not construe “the fact that the individual owners of 
the condos are not named parties” to be an “impediment to the 
lawsuit going forward, inasmuch as the [Associations of 
Apartment Owners] bind them all.” The court then ruled that 
Gold Coast could proceed  in the litigation under the theories of 
common law implied dedication and surrender under Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS)  § 264-1, but that both issues were subject to 
genuine issues of material fact  precluding summary judgment.    
  On April 26, 2010, the S tate filed its own  complaint 
for declaratory relief  with the circuit court, naming as 
defendants some of the individual owners and associations of the 
properties included in Gold Coast’s First Amended Complaint. In 
its complaint, the State sought a declaration that “[the State] does not own the seawalls or the real property under the 
seawalls” and that “the State does not have an easement by 
prescription or implication over the seawalls.” The circuit ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
court, in accordance with the State’s unopposed motion,4 
consolidated the case brought by Gold Coast with the case 
brought by the State.5 
On March 18, 2011, the parties filed a First 
Stipulation of Facts (Stipulated Facts) pertaining to the 
identities of the parties and the portions of the seawall at 
issue in the case. The Stipulated Facts described past repair 
work and construction completed on the Seawall, including the 
State’s performance of various repairs to the Seawall in 1982, 
1984, and 1993, and local and state legislative appropriations in contemplation of further repairs in 1989, 1992, and 2006, as 
described in greater detail above.  The parties stipulated to 
events surrounding the State’s sale to the Gold Coast in 2003 of 
a non-exclusive easement for “the right, privilege, and 
authority to construct, use, maintain and repair ” a ladder 
accessing the ocean from a 37-square-foot portion of land along 
the Seawall. The parties further stipulated that TMK No. 3-1-
4 The State in its motion to consolidate contended that it had 
“specifically” filed its complaint so that the disposition of the case 
relating to ownership and maintenance of the Seawall wou ld “explicitly 
[bind]” the individual property owners and associations, rather than solely 
Gold Coast acting on their behalves. 
5 On September 13, 2010, Gold Coast filed a second amended 
complaint (Second Amended Complaint) removing TMK No. 3 -1-033:010 from the 
complaint. Thus, the current litigation involves eleven properties. These 
eleven properties are owned or managed by various entities, each of which is 
a member of Gold Coast. See supra   note 1.

(continued. . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
033:009 was subject t o an “easement of right of  way for 
pedestrians.”  The parties agreed that as otherwise stated by 
the Stipulated Facts, “the State does not hold an express 
easement over any of the seawalls [which are the] subject of 
6these lawsuits.”    
7   On March 22, 2011, the circuit court  held a bench  
8 trial at which three witnesses for Gold Coast testified.  June 
Anderson, a resident of Diamond Head Apartments on the Gold Coast since 1971, testified that she has regularly observed 
members of the public walking along the Seawall, climbing over 
the Seawall to access the ocean, and otherwise utilizing the 
Seawall for recreational purposes. Ms. Anderson also testified 
that before becoming a resident of her Gold Coast building, she 
visited the Waikīkī area as early as 1952 and traversed the 
9   Seawall as a general member of the public several times.
6 Specifically, the Stipulated Facts relate that “[o]ther than as 
stated in paragraph 40, the State does not hold an express easement over any 
of the seawalls subject of these lawsui ts.” (Emphasis added.) 
However, 
because the Stipulated Facts does not contain a paragraph 40, it appears that this stipulation refers to the immediately preceding paragraph regarding the 
easement held by the State over TMK No. 3 -1-033:009.  
7 The Honorable Virginia L. Crandall presided over the trial.   
8 Russel Tsuji, an official of DLNR, testified for the State 
regarding public access to the Seawall, the buildings located near the 
Seawall, and the appearance and condition of the Seawall. 
9 The record reflects an agreement between the parties that 
declarations submitted by the three witnesses during summary judgment proceedings would be entered into the record in support of Gold Coast’s 
claims. In the declaration submitted by Ms. Anderson, she further stated 
12
  
 
                                                                                 
   
 
 
  
 
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
According to Ms. Anderson, since 1971, she has never “seen 
anyone attempt to keep people from walking on the [S]eawall 
walkway.” Ms. Anderson further testified that her building, 
Diamond Head Apartments, w as not “insured for the [S]eawall” and 
that the residents have “never considered [the Seawall] [their] 
10 property really.”   Similarly, Robert Gentry, a resident of the 
Gold Coast since 1982 and president of the Gold Coast 
Neighborhood Association, testified  that from his residence, he 
observed a “[t]remendous amount of recreational activity” by 
members of the public utilizing the Seawall and the ocean 
beyond, including swimming, fishing, surfing, dog-walking, and 
lifeguarding activities. Mr. Gentry added th at he has “never” 
11  tried to stop anyone from walking along the Seawall.  Mr. 
(. . .continued) 
that she “also observed many other people walking along the Diamond Head 
Seawall” during her visits to the area between 1952 and 1958. 
10 In her declaration, Ms. Anderson also stated that to the best of 
her knowledge, “during the time in whic h [she has] been familiar with the 
Diamond Head Seawall, no owner of property adjacent to the Diamond Head 
Seawall has ever blocked the public from accessing the Diamond Head Seawall, 
performed any repairs on the Diamond Head Seawall, or exerted any other similar form of control or act of ownership over the Diamond Head Seawall.” 
11 In Mr. Gentry’s declaration submitted during summary judgment 
proceedings, Mr. Gentry elaborated that to the best of his knowledge, (1) “no 
owner of property along the Diamond Head Seawall, including [Mr. Gentry] and 
other members of the [Gold Coast Neighborhood Association], has ever blocked the public from using the Diamond Head Seawall,” (2) the Gold Coast 
Neighborhood Association “assumes that owners of property bordering t he 
Diamond Head Seawall do not have the right to block the public from using the seawall,” and (3) “owners of property along the Diamond Head Seawall . . . 
have acquiesced in the public’s use of the Diamond Head Seawall as a walkway and for recreational pu rposes.” 
13
  
 
    The circuit court heard additional testimony from Guy 
Bishaw, a Waikīkī resident who does not own property on the Gold 
Coast and who does not have a relationship with the Gold Coast 
Neighborhood Association, who described his continuous use of 
the Seawall for ocean access  and other recreational purposes 
since the 1950s. Mr. Bishaw further testified that in all the 
time he has used the Seawall to reach various surf spots, no one  
has “ever tried to stop [him] from walking on the wall” or “told [him] that the  seawall was private property and [he] better not 
walk on the wall.”  
  
 
    
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Gentry also noted that, to the best of his knowledge, his 
building has never had insurance over the walkway on the 
Seawall. 
On November 29, 2013, the circuit court issued its 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law). The circuit court determined that 
Gold Coast had prevailed on its implied dedication and surrender claims and was therefore “entitled to a declaratory ruling” that 
the State has an easement over and across the Seawall by implied 
dedication and that the State owns the Seawall and the real 
property under the Seawall by surrender. 
In its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the 
circuit court made extensive findings of fact regarding the 
parties, the identification and characteristics of the 
14
  
 
    
 
  
  Under the law of implied dedication, the circuit court 
stated that Gold Coast was required to demonstrate “an offer and 
acceptance of dedication both of which may be implied based on the circumstances.” The court determined that if “regular and 
continuous use by the public” was the only evidence of implied 
                     
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
properties at issue, access to the Seawall from Kalākaua Avenue , 
the history of the State’s repair work on the Seawall and communications by the State regarding its responsibility to 
maintain the Seawall, miscellaneous facts regarding various  
12 properties included in the lawsuit,  and a site visit conducted 
by the court and counsel for Gold Coast and the State. The 
court also made findings  of fact  regarding the public’s use of 
the Seawall, stating in finding of fact (FOF)  103 that “[t]he 
public has used the Seawall for both shoreline and ocean access for decades and has done so without any apparent interference 
from any private landowners along the Gold Coast.”  
In its conclusions of law, the circuit court addressed 
common law implied dedication and also evaluated surrender under 
the Hawaii Revised Statute
s.  
12 In finding of fact (FOF) 52, the court found that the property 
identified as TMK No. 3 -1-033:009 was registered in land court.  In FOF 105, 
the court also found that TMK No. 3 -1-033:009 was subject to an express 
easement for pedestrian use in favor of the State.  In FOF 106, the court 
found that “[o]ther than as stated in [FOF 105], the State does not hold an express easement over any portion of the Seawall that is the subject of these 
lawsuits.”

dedication, “the time period must be ‘much longer’ than the 
twenty year prescriptive period under HRS § 657-31,” relying on 
this court’s decision in In re Banning , 73 Haw. 297, 832 P.2d 
724 (1992). 
Proof of an offer of dedication was evidenced by 
“the long-continued public use of the Seawall as a walkway from 
the 1930s to the present.” Acceptance of the offer of 
dedication was demonstrated both by the “uncontroverted direct 
evidence of public use  of the Seawall as a walkway from at least 
1952 to when [the] suit was filed” and the State’s “assertion of 
dominion and control over the Seawall through the State’s 
statements that the Seawall is a public right of way and the 
State’s actions in repairing and rehabilitating the Seawall.”  
Additionally, the circuit court determined that in 
order to prevail u
nder the surrender theory pursuant to HRS § 
264-1(c) (2007), Gold Coast must prove, “at the very least,” the 
following two elements: (1) “the Seawall is a thoroughfare that 
was opened, laid out, or built by private parties,” and (2) “the 
owners have not exercised an act of ownership over the Seawall 
for five years or more.”13 
13 The circuit court also addressed and rejec ted the State’s 
argument that “formal acceptance by the State is required in order to 
transfer ownership by surrender,” concluding that the plain language of the 
surrender statute did not support such a reading because “[i]f formal acceptance were required , the transfer would not be ‘deemed’ to have taken 
place” as set forth by the statute.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
With respect to the first two elements of HRS § 264 -
1(c), the court concluded that the Seawall exists as a walkway 
running along the shoreline that was originally constructed by 
private parties; the court further determined that Gold Coast 
had established that the owners had not exercised an act of 
ownership over the Seawall for five years or more.  The court 
recognized the possibility of a third requirement that the State 
hold a preexisting easement over the relevant property arising 
from this court’s decision in In re Banning, 73 Haw. 297, 832 
P.2d 724 (1992)
. The court concluded that this requirement, if 
applicable, would also be satisfied because the State held an 
express easement over TMK No. 3-1-033:009 and a prescriptive 
easement “over all the remaining parcels” with the exception of 
TMK Nos. 3-1-032:029 and 30 “where the S eawall is almost wholly 
within property registered in land court.”14 As a result, the 
court determined that Gold Coast proved that the Seawall “was 
surrendered to the State in accordance with HRS § 264-1(c),” with the exception of those portions of the Seawall located at 
TMK Nos. 3-1-032:029 and 3-1-032:030, which were properties 
registered in land court. See HRS § 501-87 (2006) (providing 
14 Although the court concluded that the third element, that the 
State hold a preexisting easement over the relevant property, was satisfied 
in this case, it maintaine d in conclusion of law 11 that it was “not 
convinced” that this element was required to effectuate a surrender under HRS 
§ 264-1(c).  
17
  
 
      
  The circuit court issued its Final Judgment concluding  
that the State holds an easement by implied dedication over the 
Seawall including those portions of the Seawall at TMK Nos. 3-1-
032:029 and 3-1-032:030.  The Final Judgment additionally 
determined that  the State owns the Seawall and the real property 
underneath the Seawall except as to those portions at TMK No. 3  -
1-032:029 and TMK No. 3-1-032:030 that are on privately owned 
land registered in land court. The State’s complaint for 
declaratory judgment in  Civil No. 10-1-10888-04 VLC was 
dismissed with prejudice.   The Final Judgment set forth that 
each party “shall bear its/his/her own attorneys’ fees and 
costs.”  
  Gold Coast subsequently filed a motion for attorneys’ 
fees and costs in the amount of $376,539.25  (Motion for 
Attorneys’ Fees and Costs) , asserting that the State’s sovereign 
immunity was “not implicated” because the State had filed its 
own complaint against Gold Coast and that Gold Coast was 
entitled to fees under the private attorney general doctrine.  
Gold Coast also suggested that even if sovereign immunity barred 
an award of attorneys’ fees, the “interest[s] of justice” would 
require the court to invoke its inherent authority under the 
Hawaii Revised Statutes to award Gold Coast the fees it sought. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
that land registered in land court cannot be deemed to have been 
surrendered under the Hawaii Revised Statutes). 
18
  
 
    
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Finally, Gold Coast contended that it was entitled to costs 
against the State pursuant to HRS § 607-24 (1993) because it 
received a final judgment against the State and was the 
prevailing party in  the litigation.  The State  in its opposition 
argued that   fees were barred by the State’s sovereign immunity 
and that Gold Coast did not meet the requirements to merit a fee 
award under the private attorney general doctrine. The State 
alternatively contended that even if Gold Coast was entitled to 
fees, the requested amount must be substantially reduced. As to 
costs, the State argued that Gold Coast was not a prevailing 
party, and, in the alternative, that Gold Coast had provided 
“absolutely no detail as [to] any of their charges.” On May 12, 
2014, the circuit court entered an order denying Gold Coast’s 
Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs (Order Denying Fees and 
Costs) because the State “ha[d]  not waived its sovereign 
immunity as to an award of attorneys ’ fees and costs in the 
circumstances of this case.”  
C. ICA Proceedings 
The State appealed the circuit court’s Findings of 
Fact and Conclusions of Law and the Final Judgment to the ICA.  
The State argued that the circuit court erred on the merits by 
ruling that the State acquired an easement over the Seawall by 
common law implied dedication and/or that it owned the Seawall 
19
  
 
    
  Further, the State argued that the Seawall could not 
be surrendered to the State because it was not a “trail” or 
“public highway” within the meaning of HRS § 264 -1, and, thus,  
                     
  
 
 
 
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
by virtue of surrender under HRS § 264-1(c).15 The State 
contended that “state law specifically  prohibits the State from 
acquiring ownership of real property or any interest in real 
property without the State’s acceptance,” and because the State 
did not formally accept transfer of the Seawall, no implied 
dedication or surrender of the Seawall was effectuated.  In 
support of its argument, the State relied on HRS §§ 171-30  
(1993), 26-7 (2009) (last amended 1990)  , 107-10 (Supp. 2001)  , 
16  and 520-7 (2006)  . The State additionally asserted that the 
evidence was insufficient to support a finding of common law 
implied dedication  or statutory surrender.   
15 The State also contended that the circuit court lacked 
jurisdiction, arguing that the declaratory judgment statute was inapplicable, 
that Gold Coast lacked standing, and that the action constituted an improper quiet title action to which Gold Coast was “not a proper party” and to which 
the “actual owners” of the properties were indispensable parties. The ICA 
rejected the State’s jurisdictional claims and determined that Gold Coast’s complaint could not be treated as an action for quiet title. Gold Coast 
Neighborhood Ass’n v. State , 136 Hawai i 340, 353, 361 P.3d 1243, 1256 (App. 
2015). The ICA did not rule on the State’ s argument regarding indispensable 
parties. To the extent that the State repeats on certiorari its argument that the circuit court failed to join indispensable parties, this issue is 
addressed below. 
16 Although the State raised arguments based on HRS §§ 171- 30, 26-7, 
and 520- 7 before the circuit court, it only raised HRS § 107 -10 in support of 
its argument before the ICA by letter to the appellate clerk dated May 7, 
2015, after submission of its Opening Brief. Gold Coast filed a motion to 
strike the letter, which the ICA denied as moot following issuance of its opinion in the case. On certiorari before this court, the State relies on 
the four statutes. 
20
  
 
   
 
 
  
  
 
 
  On June 30, 2015, the ICA issued a published opinion 
affirming the circuit court’s conclusion that the State had 
acquired an easement over the Seawall by common law implied dedication and the Seawall and real property  under the Seawall 
by surrender.  Gold Coast Neighborhood Ass’n v. State , 136 
Hawai
i 340, 357, 361 P.3d 1243, 1260 (App. 2015).  Relying on  In 
re Banning, 73 Haw. 297, 832 P.2d 724 (1992), the ICA held that both the owners’ offer of dedication  and the State’s acceptance 
of that offer could be implied from the history of use and maintenance of the Seawall from “well before ”  1969 to 2006. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
it was not a type of property subject to surrender under the 
statute. The State distinguished this case from Levy v. 
Kimball, 50 Haw. 497, 443 P.2d 142 (1968), in which this court 
held that a particular seawall constituted a “public highway” 
within the meaning of HRS § 261-1, because unlike in Levy, the 
State had not acquired a preexisting express easement over the Seawall with the exception of TMK No. 3-1-033:009.  
Gold Coast cross-appealed the circuit court’s Order 
Denying Fees and Costs, contending that it was entitled to attorneys’ fees under the private attorney general doctrine, 
that the State had waived its sovereign immunity because it had 
filed its own complaint against Gold Coast, and that the 
interests of justice required the court to award fees using its 
inherent authority. 
21
  
 
   
   
 
 
  
  With respect to surrender, the ICA stated that a 
seawall that “is used as a public thoroughfare” may qua lify as a 
“public trail” or “public highway” subject to surrender under 
HRS § 264-1.  Id.  (quoting Levy, 50 Haw. at  499-500, 443 P.2d at  
144; HRS § 264-1(c) (2007)).  The ICA observed that it was 
undisputed that the Seawall was “built by private parties an d 
completed by 1930”  and that “no owners of the Seawall exercised 
ownership over the Seawall for at least five years prior to ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Gold Coast Neighborhood Ass’n , 136 Hawai i at 354, 361 P.3d at 
1257. In support of its conclusion, the ICA relied on the evidence of the “public’s open and continuous non -permissive use 
of the Seawall as a walkway from as early as 1956”; the ICA also 
cited “the State’s recognition of the entire Seawall as a public 
walkway in 1975, 1982, 1984, 1992, and 2006” and “the State’s 
repairs to portions of the Seawall in 1982, 1984, and 1993.” 
Id. at 355, 361 P.3d at 1258. The ICA further noted that the 
parties “[did] not dispute” the circuit court’s finding that the 
“public has used the Seawall for both shoreline and ocean access for decades and has done so without any apparent interference 
from any private landowners along the Gold Coast.” Id. at 354 -
55, 361 P.3d at 1257-58.  The ICA therefore determined that the 
circuit court did not err in concluding that the State held an 
easement over and across the Seawall by virtue of implied 
dedication. Id. at 355, 361 P.3d at 1258. 
22
  
 
    
  
 
  
  The ICA also addressed the State’s general argument 
that various provisions of the Hawaii Revised Statutes operate  
to preclude surrender or implied dedication of property to the 
State absent the State’s formal consent. Id.  at 356, 361 P.3d 
at 1259. 
Quoting from portions of HRS §§ 171-30 (1993), 26-7 
(2009) (last amended  1990), and 107-10 (Supp. 2001), the ICA 
concluded that these provisions did not operate to require the 
State’s formal consent because both doctrines of surrender and 
common law implied dedication “are well establishe d means for  
the public to acquire State  land without the State’s consent via 
public use.” Gold Coast Neighborhood Ass’n , 136 Hawai i at 356,  
361 P.3d at 1259.   The ICA reasoned that the State’s 
interpretation of HRS §§ 171-30, 26-7, and 107-10 “is not only 
inconsistent with the language of the statutes, but if adopted, 
would produce an absurd result in that it would silently abolish 
the doctrines of implied ded ication and surrender.” Id.  
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
litigation.” Id. As a result, the ICA concluded that the 
circuit court did not err in determining that the real property 
under the Seawall was surrendered to the State with the 
exception of those parcels registered in land court that were 
not subject to the surrender statute. Id. at 355-56, 361 P.3d 
at 1258-59. 
Lastly, the ICA addressed Gold Coast’s appeal of the 
circuit court’s denial of attorneys’ fees and costs.  Id. at 
23
  
 
   
  
 
  
  “The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
reviewable de novo .”   State v. Arceo , 84 Hawai i 1, 10, 928 P.2d  
843, 852 (1996)  (quoting 
State v. Camara , 81 Hawai i 324, 329,  
916 P.2d 1225, 1230 (1996)).   “Similarly, a trial court’s 
conclusions of law are reviewable de novo under the right/wrong 
standard.” State v. Kelekolio , 94 Hawai i 354, 356, 14 P.3d 364,  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
356-57, 361 P.3d at 1259-60.  On this issue, the ICA concluded 
that the circuit court had erred in barring atto rneys’ fees on 
the basis of the State’s sovereign immunity because “‘the 
doctrine of sovereign immunity is unavailing and inapposite’ 
when the ‘case deals with a suit initiated by the State.’” Id. 
at 357, 361 P.3d at 1260 (alteration omitted) (quoting State ex 
rel. Anzai v. City & Cty. of Honolulu , 99 Hawai i 508, 515-16, 57 
P.3d 433, 440-41 (2002)).  The ICA also determined that the 
circuit court erred in denying Gold Coast costs, stating that 
“Gold Coast prevailed against the State” and citing HRS § 607 -24 
(1993). Id.  Therefore, the ICA affirmed the circuit court’s 
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Final Judgment, and it vacated the circuit court’s Order Denying Fees and Costs and 
remanded for reconsideration of Gold Coast’s Motion for 
Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. Id.

IV. DISCUSSION 
The State makes three principal arguments on 
certiorari. First, the State argues that HRS §§ 171-30, 26-7, 
and 107-10 operate to preclude common law implied dedication and 
surrender under HRS § 264-1(c) without the State’s formal 
consent or acceptance. Second, the State contends that the 
circuit court was required to “make the actual owners of the 
real property parties to the case” and that it s failure to do so 
constituted error.  Third, the State submits that the ICA erred in determining that Gold Coast was entitled to attorneys’ fees 
based on the ICA’s reasoning that the filing of a complaint by 
the State for declaratory relief waived its sovereign immunity in this case. 
25
  
 
    
  
 
   
   
   
       
 
   
  
 
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
A. Indispensable Parties 
The State’s argument on the issue of indispensable 
parties contends that “the actual property owners” must be 
joined to a lawsuit that determines o wnership of the owners’ 
properties. Gold Coast responds that it need not join the individual owners of the properties at issue because their 
interests are sufficiently represented by the various apartment 
owners’ associations that are members of Gold Coast, the named 
plaintiff in this case. 
Gold Co ast’s Second Amended Complaint sought a 
declaration that the State is responsible for maintaining the 
Seawall bordering eleven identified properties that are managed 
by various entities. See supra notes 1, 5. Each of these 
entities is a member of plaintiff Gold Coast Neighborhood Association and joined Gold Coast for the purpose of having it 
represent the entity’s and owners’ interests in this litigation. 
The State acknowledged before the circuit court that 
the individual owners of properties located on the eleven parcels at issue in this litigation could have “their rights in 
this matter” “protect[ed] or represent[ed]” by “their resp ective 
condominium associations ” thereby obviating any requirement to 
join the individual owners, but submitted that such 
representation was only permitted by a provision of the Hawaii 
Revised Statutes that was repealed in 2004 by Act 164 of the 
26
  
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Hawaii State Legislature .   See  HRS § 514A-93 (1993) ( “actions 
may be brought by the manager or board of directors, in either 
case in the discretion of the board of directors on behalf of two or more of the apartment owners . . . with respect to any 
cause of action relating to the common elements or more than  one 
apartment”),
 repealed by  2004 Hawai i Session Laws Act 164, § 26  
at 813.  However, although HRS § 514A -93 (1993) was repealed by 
Act 164 prior to commencement of proceedings in this case, the act retained and relocated within the Hawaii  Revised Statutes 
the authority of apartment and condominium associations to represent the interests of their owners  in litigation.  See  2004  
Hawaii Session Laws Act 164, § 2 at 761 -62 (codified at HRS § 
514B-104(a)(4)  (2006)).  Further, although HRS § 514A-93 (1993) 
was repealed in 2004, language identical to the prior version of HRS § 514A-93 was reenacted at HRS § 514A-93 in 2007 and made 
retroactively effective to July 1, 2006. See  HRS § 514A-93 
(Supp. 2007); 2007 Hawai i Session Laws Act 244, § 2 at 745.   
Thus, at the time Gold Coast initiated this litigation on June 
22, 2007, its members were statutorily  entitled  to “[i]nstitute, 
defend, or intervene in litigation ” on behalf of their 
respective owners. HRS § 514B-104(a)(4) (2006); see also  HRS § 
514A-93 (Supp. 2007)  (permitting the manager or board of 
directors to bring actions on behalf of owners).   The circuit 
27
  
 
     
  
  Next, the State contends that various disparate 
provisions of the Hawaii Revised Statutes operate to  condition 
the implied dedication of private property to the State upon the 
State’s formal conse nt or acceptance. Gold Coast responds that 
the statutes relied upon by the State do not require the State’s 
formal acceptance as an additional element to the common law 
doctrine of implied dedication  that has long existed in the 
State of Hawai i.   
  In 1892, Queen Lili ʻuokalani and the Kingdom of Hawai ʻi  
adopted the common law of England as the basis of its 
jurisprudence by legislation entitled “Act to Reorganize the 
Judiciary Department.”   See  L. 1892, ch. 57, § 5;  see also  
Damien P. Horigan, On the Reception of the Common Law in the 
Hawaiian Islands, III, 13 Haw. Bar. J.  87, 111-12 (1999).  The 
present-day codification of this legislation can  be found at HRS 
§ 1-1, which provides  in relevant part  as follows:  
                     
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
court therefore did not err in concluding that Gold Coast need 
not join the individual owners as indispensable parties.17 
B. Common Law Implied Dedication 
17 The individuals or entities named as parties by the State’s 
complaint that were not included in Gold Coast’s subsequent Second Amended 
Complaint filed answers responding specifically to the State’s complaint. 
Each of these individuals or entities asserted that the State was responsible 
for maintaining the Seawall and raised as a defense to the State ’s complaint 
“the public’s consistent and extensive use of the seawalls” for “at least 50 
to 100 years.”

     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The common law of England, as ascertained by English 
and American decisions, is declared to be the common 
law of the State of Hawaii in all cases, except as 
otherwise expressly provided  by the Constitution or 
laws of the United States, or by the laws of the State, or fixed by Hawaiian judicial precedent, o
r 
established by Hawaiian usage  . . . .  
HRS § 1-1 (2009) (emphasis added). Thus, the common law of 
England applies in the State of Hawaiʻ i except as otherwise 
expressly provided by Hawaiʻ i law, federal law, or by Hawaiian 
judicial precedent or usage. 
The common law has historically provided for the 
dedication of private property for public use.18 
73 Haw. 297, 304-05, 832 P.2d 724, 728-29 (1992)
.  Common law 
dedication of private property is “accomplished either 
expressly, as by deed, or impliedly, as by acts and conduct 
which manifest an intent to give the property for public use.”

    Under the common law, formal acceptance is not 
19 required to effectuate an implied dedication.   Indeed, in its 
explicit adoption of common law implied dedication in 1869, the 
Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻ i in  The King v. Cornwell, 
3 Haw. 154, 161  (Haw. Kingdom 1869), considered that acceptance 
could be inferred from public use. The Cornwell  court 
established that in Hawaiʻ i,  “[o]rdinarily,  there is no other 
                     
 19  See  Vitauts M. Gulbis, Implied acceptance, by public use, of 
dedication of beach or shoreline adjoining public waters, 24 A.L.R.4th 294 
(1983) (“Under generally accepted  common-law principles, the implied  
acceptance of an implied or express offer to dedicate,  can be shown by 
maintenance or improvement of the property by local government activity  or by 
use by members of the unorganized public.” (f ootnotes omitted)); 26 C.J.S.

mode of showing an acceptance by the public of a dedication than 
by its being made use of by them, ” but considered that if public 
use was the only evidence of dedication, it must have continued 
for a longer period than that required to effectuate a 
prescriptive easement. Id. at 161-62. 
Following Cornwell, our courts have continued to 
recognize common law implied dedication as a method of 
transferring interests in property to the State and have 
repeatedly noted that formal acceptance is not a prerequisite. 
See, e.g., Maui Ranch, 6 Haw. App. at 421, 724 P.2d at 123 
(common law dedication may be accomplished “ impliedly, as by 
acts and conduct which manifest an intent to give the property for public use ”); Banning, 73 Haw. at 304-05, 832 P.2d at 728-29 
(“[T]he acceptance may also be implied by the nature of the public use . . . . In other words, the duration and type of 
public use can raise both the presumption of the owner’s intent

acceptance by the public.” (citations omitted)); Wemple ex rel.

such subdivision is recorded, and sales of the lots  are made);

A Treatise 779, 818 (Melody Kapilialoha MacKenzie et al. eds., 
2015) (observing that “[a] ccess along Hawaiian trails may be 
protected where there has been an implied dedication of a public 
right-of-way across private land” and analyzing Cornwell, 3 Haw. 
154).   Though  continuous use of the property by members of the 
public is commonly relied upon in determining whether a 
dedication occurred, conduct evincing an implied acceptance may 
also include actions attributable to the government, such as 
“maintenance of sidewalks, beach patrols, or the installation of 
utility connections by local government bodies.” See  Gulbis, 
supra  note 19  (stating that such conduct “has been held to 
support an implied acceptance of an express offer to dedicate”).   
Despite its deeply entrenched 
and long historical 
presence in our jurisprudence, the State contends that various provisions of the Hawaii Revised Statutes operate to preclude 
the implied dedication of private property to the State without 
the State’s explicit acceptance.  The State therefore suggests 
that the doctrine of common law implied dedication has been

implicitly abolished in Hawai i, insofar as it contends that an 
implied acceptance of an offer of dedication is insufficient to 
deem private property dedicated to the public. See Banning, 73 
Haw. at 304, 832 P.2d at 728-29.  However, statutes which 
abrogate the common law must do so expressly, not impliedly, and 
such statutes “must be strictly construed.” Burns Int’l Sec. 
Servs., Inc. v. Dep’t of Transp. , 66 Haw. 607, 611, 671 P.2d 
446, 449 (1983). Additionally, review of the statutory 
provisions cited by the State and the relevant caselaw refute 
the State’s contention that Hawaii’s common law doctrine of 
implied dedication may not transfer interests in private property to the State absent the State’s formal consent. 
i. Abrogation of common law disfavored 
HRS § 1-1 provides that the only exception to the 
general applicability of common law principles in this 
jurisdiction occurs when state or federal law “ expressly 
provide[s]” otherwise. See HRS § 1-1 (2009) (emphasis added).  
Our courts have repeatedly recognized the importance of the 
common law and have demonstrated an unwillingness to impliedly 
reject its principles; they have also determined that subsequent 
statutory enactments will not be construed as abrogating the 
common law “unless that result is imperatively required .”

    This strong reluctance to abolish common law rights

a. HRS § 264
-1(c)(1) 
Although not expressly relied upon 
by the State, the 
dissent contends that HRS § 264-1(c)(1) abrogates common law 
dedication with respect to ways and trails. Dissent at 20.  We 
therefore begin our analysis by considering the analogous 
concepts of statutory dedication as set forth in the Hawaii 
Revised Statutes and common law implied dedication and the 
treatment of the two doctrines by courts of this jurisdiction. 
HRS § 264-1(c)(1) sets forth the requirements to 
effectuate a statutory dedication of certain private lands for 
public use in the State of Hawai ʻi. At the commencement of this 
litigation, HRS § 264-1(c)(1) provided in relevant part: 
(c) All roads, alleys, streets, ways, lanes, trails, 
bikeways, and bridges in the State, opened, laid out, or 
built by private parties and dedicated or surrendered to 
the public use, are declared to be public highways or 
public trails as follows: 
(1) Dedication of public highways or trails shall be 
by deed of conveyance naming the State as grantee in 
the case of a state highway or trail and naming the 
county as grantee in the case of a county highway or 
trail. The deed of conveyance shall be delivered to and accepted by the director of transportation in the 
case of a state highway or the board of land and 
natural resources in the case of a state trail. In 
the case of a county highway or county trail, the 
deed shall be delivered to and accepted by the legislative body of a county. 
HRS § 264-1(c)(1) (2007).  HRS § 264-1(c)(1) constitutes a 
method of executing  a dedication by statute (“statutory 
36
  
 
    Although the Hawaii  Revised Statutes provide for a 
method of statutory dedication,  HRS § 264-1(c )(1) does not   
provide an exclusive method of dedicating private property for 
public use in the State of Hawai ʻi.  Rather, HRS § 264-1(c)(1)   
exists alongside common law implied dedication, which our courts   
have long recognized. See, e.g. , The King v. Cornwell, 3 Haw. 
154, 155, 161-
62 (Haw. Kingdom 1869); Maui Ranch , 6 Haw. App. at 
421, 724 P.2d at 123; In re Banning , 73 Haw. 297, 304 -05, 832 
P.2d 724, 728-29 (1992); Wemple II, 103 Hawai ʻi 385 , 397, 83 P.3d 
100, 112 (2004)  ; Wemple ex rel. Dang v. Dahman  (Wemple I), 102 
Hawai‘i 27, 72 P.3d 499 (App. 2002), rev’d, 103  Hawaii 385, 83  
P.3d 100 (2004).  Indeed, decisions of this jurisdiction  
analyzing HRS § 264-1(c) have    also simultaneously reaffirmed the 
viability of common law implied dedication as a way of  
transferring property interests  to the State  in addition to the  
method of statutory dedication codified in the Hawaii Revised  
Statutes. See  Wemple II, 103 Hawaiʻ i at 392-  93, 39 7,  83 P.3d at  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
dedication”)  because it delineates procedures to effect “a 
dedication of land to public use . . . pursuant to statute.” 23 
Am. Jur. 2d Dedication  § 3 (20 13); see also  Maui Ranch Estates 
Owners Ass’n v. Maui C ty., 6 Haw. App. 414, 421, 724 P.2d 118, 
123 (1986) (“Dedication of land for public use may be achieved 
either by statute or by common law. Statutory dedication occurs 
when the statutory provisions are complied with.”).    
37
  
 
    For example, in   Wemple II , this court was called upon 
to review a grant of summary judgment determining that a private 
roadway had been dedicated to a county for public use. 
103 
Hawaiʻi at 392 -93, 83 P.3d at 107-08.  The court noted that the 
20 ICA in its published opinion in the case  had already 
“thoroughly analyzed the complex history of the public road 
system in Hawai ʻi” and had correctly concluded  that HRS § 264-1 
“prevents a private road from becoming a ‘county highway ’ . . .  
                     
   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
107-08, 112 (concluding that  although the road was not dedicated  
to the county by virtue of HRS § 264-1 (Supp. 1990)  , it remained 
a “significant” question  whether the public held an easement 
over the road by operation of common law implied dedication); 
Banning, 73 Haw. at 304  -05, 313, 832  P.2d at 728-29, 732 
(detailing doctrine  and requirements of common law dedication 
and then separately analyzing HRS § 264-1 (1985));  Maui Ranch , 6 
Haw. App. at 421-22, 724 P.2d at 123-24 (same).   The coexistence  
of common law dedication and statutory dedication in our state exemplifies the principle that “[e]ven in the same jurisdiction, 
a dedication of land to public use may be made either according 
to the common law or pursuant to statute.” 23 Am. Jur. 2d 
Dedication § 3  (2013).     
20 See Wemple I, 102 Hawai ʻi 27, 72 P.3d 499, rev’d, 103 Hawaiʻ i 385, 
83 P.3d 100. 
38
  
 
     
  Significantly, the Wemple II court in its unanimous  
opinion explicitly recognized the continued viability of common 
law implied dedication in 
Hawaiʻi.  In addition to determining 
that the private roadway had not been dedicated to the county by 
virtue of HRS § 264-1, this court also analyzed the ICA’s 
“conclu[sion] as a matter of law” that “the public had an 
easement over the privately owned road because [the] road had  
been impliedly dedicated to the public.” Id.  at 397, 83 P.3d at 
112. We concluded that the ICA had erred in resolving the issue 
of implied dedication as a matter of law. Id.   As stated by the 
Wemple II  court, “ Whether an implied easement exists depends on 
the parties’   intent and is therefore a question of fact.”   Id.   
Based on the record, we concluded that there  remained questions 
of fact regarding the parties’ intent s, thus making  summary 
judgment inappropriate.  Id.   As a result, this court reversed 
the ICA’s decision, vacated the trial court’s grant of summary judgment, and remanded to the trial court for  further 
21 proceedings. Id.  at 398, 83 P.3d at 113.  
                     
   
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
without express acceptance of the private road by the County 
Council,” which had not occurred. Id.  
21 The dissent characterizes Wemple II as a “refus[al] to apply the 
theory of implied dedication to transfer a privately owned road to the county 
as a county highway.” 
Dissent at 24. However, as discussed, this court in 
Wemple II  specifically acknowledged the viability of common law implied 
dedication; indeed, we remanded to the trial court based in part on our 
(continued. . .) 
39
  
 
    Wemple I  and Wemple II  reflect our historical 
application of common law implied dedication as an alternative 
means of transferring interests to the State separate and apart 
from HRS § 264  -1(c)(1).  Indeed,  Wemple II manifested its  
approval of the ICA’s following summary in Wemple I  on the 
viability of common law implied dedication and its interplay 
with statutory dedication:  
 
  
                                                                               
   
 
 
 22  This court in Wemple II   described with approval the ICA’s 
“thorough[] analy[sis] [of] the complex history of the public road system in 
Hawaiʻi,” which concluded with the text quoted above. 103 Hawai ʻi at 392, 83 
P.3d at 107; see also  Wemple  I, 102 Hawaiʻ i  at 47-53, 72 P.3d at 519 -25.   
Thus, to the extent that it was approved of by this court in Wemple II, the 
ICA’s summary from Wemple I  may inform our understanding of the doctrine of 
implied dedication.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
To summarize, HRS § 264 –1 requires that before a county can 
be held responsible and liable for the maintenance or 
repair of a private road that has been dedicated, 
surrendered, or abandoned to public use, there must have 
been “unequivocal acceptance” of the private road by the legislative body of the county. Maui Ranch Estates Owners 
Ass
’n v. County of Maui ,  6 Haw.App. at 421, 724 P.2d at  
123. 
That is, all the requirements for statutory 
dedication, abandonment, or surrender must be completed. 
However, a privately owned road that has not been 
statutorily dedicated, surrendered, or abandoned to public use by technical compliance with HRS § 264 –1 may still be 
impliedly dedicated, surrendered, or abandoned to public use for a general roadway easement .  
Wemple I, 22 102 Hawaiʻ i at 53, 72 P. 3d at 525 (emphasis added)  .   
Therefore, for the reasons stated, and because this 
court has firmly recognized that the two doctrines exist in 
(. . .continued) 
conclusion that “[w]hether an implied easement exists” was a question to be 
determined based on the “parties’ intent[s].” 103 Hawai i at 397, 83 P.3d at 
112. 
40
  
 
    
  
 
  
  
  
   
  In support of its contention that the common law 
doctrine of implied dedication may not transfer interests in 
private property to the public without the State’s explicit 
acceptance, the State primarily relies on HRS §  § 171-30 (1993)  , 
26-7 (2009) (last amended 1990), and 107-10  (Supp. 2001).  
However, a clear intent to abrogate  common law implied  
dedication in this jurisdiction  is absent in these provisions.

b. HRS §§ 171-30, 26-7, 107-10 
23 Although predating both this court ’s decisions in Banning and 
Wemple II, the State and the dissent suggest that the ICA’s 1986 decision in 
Maui Ranch, 
6 Haw. App. 414, 724 P.2d 118, indicates that private land may 
only be dedicated to the State by statutory dedication as codified at HRS § 
264-1(c)(1).  In  however, the ICA clearly stated that 
“[d]edication of land for public use may be achieved either by statute  or by 
common law. ” 
6 Haw. App at 421, 724 P.2d at 123 (emphasis added); see also  
id. (dedication may occur “[i]n the absence of statute” (quoting 23 Am. Jur. 
2d Dedication § 45)).  The ICA also acknowledged that common law dedication 
may be accomplished “impliedly, as by acts and conduct which manifest an 
intent to give the property for public use.” Id.  (citations omitted).  The 
ICA thus clearly manifested its approval of the common law doctrine of implied dedication, see id. , which was subsequently reaffirmed by this court 
in Banning, 73 Haw. 297, 832 P.2d 724, and Wemple II, 103 Hawaiʻ i 385, 83 P.3d 
100. 
41
  
 
      
  
   
 
 
                     
 24  Additionally ,  HRS §  171-30(a)(1) may simply function to identify 
the state entity administratively responsible for acting and initiating a 
transaction when the State requires the acquisition of real property for 
public use. See  Island-Gentry Joint Venture v. State , 57 Haw. 259, 263 -64, 
554 P.2d 761, 764 -65 (1976) (authority of BLNR to “acquir[e]” real property 
under HRS §  171-30 also signifies that BLNR is the entity responsible for 
“initially enter[ing] into a contract for the acquisition of land” when 
required for public use).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
HRS § 171-30 grants authority to the Board of Land and 
Natural Resources (BLNR) to acquire interests in “all real 
property” and provides in relevant part as follows: 
(a) The board of land and natural resources shall have the 
exclusive responsibility, except as provided herein, of acquiring, including by way of dedications: 
(1) All real property or any interest therein and the improvements thereon, if any, required by the State 
for public purposes . . . . 
HRS § 171-30(a)(1) ( 1993).   BLNR thus has  the exclusive 
responsibility of “acquiring”  real property that the State needs 
for public purposes, including by dedication.  HRS § 171  -
30(a)(1). Although BLNR is assigned responsibility to 
affirmatively acquire property by way of purchase or statutory  
dedication, the statute does not address obtaining  the State’s  
formal approval or acceptance of dedicated property in all 
24   cases, particularly  when it is   merely a passive recipient.
Indeed, this statute has been in effect for more than 50 years and no case in this jurisdiction has  considered it relevant 
within the context of common law implied dedication, much less  
has it been interpreted  to abrogate or modify the doctrine of  
42
  
 
      
    
  
   
 
 
  
 
  HRS §§ 26-7 and 107 -10 likewise do not evince a  clear  
intent to abrogate or modify common law implied dedication.  HRS 
§ 26-7 establishes the composition and author  ity of the 
Department of the Attorney General. The provision delineates 
the various powers and duties of that office and provides that  
the Attorney General “shall . . . approve as to legality and 
form all documents  relating to the acquisition of any land or 
interest in lands by the State
.” HRS § 26-7 (  2009) (last  
amended 1990) (emphasis added).  HRS § 107-10 similarly requires  
that no real property interest “shall be acquired” by the State “by agreement, gift, devise, eminent domain, or otherwise . . . 
without the prior approval of the attorney general as to form, 
exceptions, and reservations .” HRS § 107-10 ( Supp. 2001)  
(emphasis added).   These provision s do not relate or speak to  
conveyance of property interests by way of implied dedication.  
Rather, HRS §§ 26-7 and 107-10   merely give the Attorney General ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
implied dedication. See, e.g. ,  Banning, 73 Haw. at 304-09, 832 
P.2d at 728-31; 
Wemple II, 103 Hawaiʻ i at 397, 83 P.3d at 112; 
Maui Ranch, 6 Haw. App. at 420-22, 724 P.2d at 123-24. In light of these considerations, 
HRS § 171-30 neither manifests an 
express intent to abrogate common law implied dedication nor imperatively requires such result.  See 
Burns Int’l Sec. Servs., 
Inc., 66 Haw. at 611, 671 P.2d at 449; Minneapolis Fire & Marine 
Ins., 44 Haw. at 67-68, 352 P.2d at 340.

final authority to review and approve the documents relating to 
acquisitions of land interests and to inspect such acquisitions 
as to form, exceptions, and reservations.  See HRS §§ 26-7, 107-
10; see also  Island-Gentry Joint Venture v. State , 57 Haw. 259, 
265, 554 P.2d 761, 766 (1976) (noting that under HRS § 26-7, 
“the Attorney General has the further exclusive authority to 
approve as to the legality and form of all documents relating to 
the acquisition of any land or interest in land by the State ”). 
These provisions express no intent to abrogate common law 
implied dedication, nor have they ever been mentioned by our 
courts as having any relevance to the doctrine.  See  Burns Int’l 
Sec. Servs., Inc. , 66 Haw. at 611, 671 P.2d at 449. 
c. HRS chapter 520 
The State also argued before the circuit court that 
HRS chapter 520 operated to preclude the implied dedication of 
the Seawall for public use in this case.  However, HRS chapter 
520, titled “Landowners’ Liabili ty,” does not demonstrate an 
express intent to abrogate implied dedication as a method of transferring interests in private property to the State. 
Rather, “[t]he purpose of this chapter is to encourage owners of 
land to make land and water areas available to the public for recreational purposes by limiting their liability toward persons 
entering thereon for such purposes. ” HRS § 520-1 (2006). To 
accomplish this purpose, HRS chapter 520 shields from liability 
44
  
 
      
  
      
 
   
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
private property owners who allow the public to use their land 
for recreational purposes. See HRS § 520-4 (2006).  
Additionally, to further protect private property 
owners, HRS § 520-7 provides that “[n] o person shall gain any 
rights to any land by prescription or otherwise, as a result of 
any usage thereof for recreational purposes as provided in this 
chapter.” HRS § 520-7 (2006) (emphasis added). HRS chapter 520 
thus also concerns itself with the property rights of private 
landowners as they relate to the recreational user, seeking to balance public recreational use and private property rights in 
order to incentivize permissive public use of private land. HRS 
chapter 520 does not, however, speak to the rights or 
responsibilities of the State in relation to the private 
property owner. 
Since its enactment in 1969, HRS chapter 520 has never 
been interpreted to suggest an abrogation of common law implied 
dedication. To the contrary, this court has expressly considered the effect of HRS chapter 520 on implied dedication 
and has found the two to be reconcilable.  See Banning, 73 Haw. 
at 305-08, 832 P.2d at 729-30.  In Banning, this court 
considered whether continuous public use of private property 
raises a conclusive presumption that the landowner intended to 
offer the property for dedication.  Id.  The Banning court noted 
that the general intent of HRS chapter 520 to encourage

   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
landowners to permit public use of private lands could be 
undermined by such a conclusive presumption.  Id. at 307-08, 832 
P.2d at 730.  In keeping with this intent, the court determined 
that continuous public use raises only a rebuttable presumption 
of implied dedication, thus concluding that the common law 
doctrine of implied dedication and HRS chapter 520 exist in 
harmony. Id. at 308, 832 P.2d at 730. Therefore, HRS chapter 
520 has already been determined by this court to not evince an 
express intent to abolish common law implied dedication or to 
imperatively require that result. See Burns Int’l Sec. Servs., 
Inc., 66 Haw. at 611, 671 P.2d at 449; Minneapolis Fire & Marine 
Ins., 44 Haw. at 67-68, 352 P.2d at 340. 
d. Implicit abolishment of common law implied dedication is 
improper 
The State contends that the foregoing statutes require 
both the Attorney General and the BLNR to formally consent to all transfers of real property interests to the State.  The 
State thus asserts that implied acceptance is insufficient to effectuate an implied dedication of property to the State.  This 
conclusion, which abrogates the common law doctrine of implied 
dedication as a means of transferring interests in private 
property to the public, is not supported by the authority cited 
by the State. First, the common law doctrine of implied 
dedication has been repeatedly recognized in this jurisdiction 
46
  
 
                       
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
for over 150 years, and this court itself has reaffirmed its 
viability as recently as 2004.  See  Cornwell , 3 Haw. at 161-62 
(recognizing common law implied dedication and observing that 
“[o]rdinarily, there is no other mode of showin g an acceptance 
by the public of a dedication than by its being 
made use of by 
them”); Maui Ranch  , 6 Haw. App. at 421, 724 P.2d at 123 (common 
law dedication may be accomplished “impliedly, as by acts and 
conduct which manifest an intent to give the property for public 
use”); Banning , 73 Haw. at 304  -05, 832 P.2d at 728-29 (“[T]he 
acceptance may also be implied by the nature of the public use . . . . In other words, the duration and type of public use can 
raise both the presumption of the owner’s intent (or offer) to 
dedicate land to public use, as well as constitute acceptance by 
the public.” (citations omitted)); Wemple II , 103 Hawai i at   397, 
83 P.3d at 112 (although the county had not formally accepted a  
statutory dedication, an additional significant question 
remained regarding whether “the pu blic had an easement over [a] 
privately owned road because the road had been impliedly

years after this court affirmed the common law principle of implied 
dedication in Wemple II , 103 Hawai i at 397, 83 P.3d at 112.

when land is subdivided into lots and streets, a plat showing 
26   such subdivision is recorded, and sales of the lots are made).
Abrogation of such a deeply-rooted principle of law  is 
contradictory to our jurisdiction’s requirement that the c ommon 
27  law governs  unless “otherwise expressly  provided.”  HRS § 1-1  
(2009) (emphasis added); Minneapolis Fire & Marine Ins. , 44 Haw. 
at 67-68, 352 P.2d  at 340 (subsequent statutory enactments will  
not be construed as abrogating the common law “unless that 
result is imperatively required”).   Indeed, the fact that HRS §  
1-1 requires adherence to  the common law unle ss “otherwise 
26 The dissent agrees that Cornwell, 3 Haw. 154, “contemplate[s] 
implied dedication of Kingdom highways,” but asserts that this case was 
superseded by The Highways Act in 1892. Dissent at 22 n.6.  However, our 
courts have repeatedly--over the course of the past century and as recently 
as 2004-- acknowledged the vitality of common law implied dedication as a 
method of transferring property interests to the State. See supra. 
The dissent, however, characterizes this body of caselaw as 
“sporadic and disparate,” relating only “peripherally . . . t o the issue at 
hand,” dissent at 19, which should be disregarded because despite repeatedly 
affirming the doctrine, our courts “have not applied implied dedication to 
public highways,” dissent at 21. As an initial matter, the dissent describes 
as one of the “question[s] raised by this case” “whether private property 
rights may be dedicated . . . to the State without the State’s formal 
consent.” Dissent at 6. Because this body of caselaw speaks directly to 
whether private property can be impliedly dedicated to the State in the 
absence of its formal or express acceptance, it does, in fact, relate precisely “to the issue at hand.” Additionally, the viability of common law 
implied dedication is not dependent on whether the facts in these cases may 
or may not have established an implied dedication; rather, our courts have 
repeatedly concluded that under the appropriate circumstances, private 
property may be impliedly dedicated to the State absent its formal acceptance. See Cornwell, 3 Haw. at 161 -62; Maui Ranch, 6 Haw. App. at 421, 
724 P.2d at 123; Banning, 73 Haw. at 304 -05, 832 P.2d at 728 -29; Wemple II, 
103 Hawai i at 397, 83 P.3d at 112. 
The ICA similarly concluded that the State’s argument, if 
adopted, “would produce an absurd result in that it would silently abolish 
the doctrines of implied dedication and surrender.” Gold Coast Neighborhood 
Ass’n v. State, 136 Hawai ʻi 340, 356, 361 P.3d 1243, 1259 (App. 2015). 
48
 27  
 
    
   
  Further,  that the State  is required  to rely on a   
combination of disparate provisions of the Hawaii  Revised 
Statutes exposes an important  point: none of the   provisions 
relied upon provide for  the abrogation of Hawaii  ’s common law 
doctrine of implied dedication or evince express legislative 
intent to do so.   Even combined, the statutes cited by the  State  
do not support an implicit abolishment of common law implied 
dedication. Decisions of this court that have considered two of 
the provisions relevant to this case  repudiate any argument that 
they operate to impliedly abrogate the doctrine. See  Wemple  II, 
103 Hawai
ʻi at   397, 83 P.3d at  112 (considering as a  
“significant” question whether an easement was created over a roadway by virtue of implied dedication  even after finding a 
lack of compliance with HRS §  264-1 (Supp. 1990));  Banning, 73 
Haw. at 307-08, 832 P.2d  at 730 (co ncluding that in light of 
legislative intent behind HRS chapter 520, public use constituted a rebuttable  presumption of implied dedication).   
The remaining provisions relied on by the State  have been 
codified in the Hawaii Revised Statutes  for decades,  and no case 
has ever cited to them as relevant to or inconsistent with  the 
doctrine.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
expressly provided” suggests that impliedly abolishing the 
common law is itself inconsistent with HRS § 1-1. 
49
  
 
    Permitting the implied repeal of a common law doctrine 
28  that has been recognized by this court as recently as 2004
would permit the implied abrogation of the common la
w in other 
areas of our jurisprudence, in direct contradiction to the mandate of HRS § 1-1 that the common law governs unless   
“otherwise expressly  provided. ” HRS § 1-1.  As stated by this 
court,  “statutes which are in derogation of common law must be 
strictly construed .” Burns Int’l Sec. Servs., Inc. , 66 Haw. at 
611, 671 P.2d at 449 (emphasis added); see also  Akai v. Lewis, 
37 Haw. 374, 378 (Haw. Terr. 1946) (“It is also well settled 
that under the rule of strict construction it is not to be 
presumed that the lawmakers intended to abrogate or modify a 
rule any further than that which is expressly declared or 
clearly indicated. ”); Pac. Ins. v. Champion Steel, LLC , 323 
Conn. 254, 264 (Conn. 2016)  (“It is fundamental that if the 
legislature wishes to abrogate  the common law, it must do so 
expressly.”).  
  
  
  
                     
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Additionally, in 
Banning, this court stated that 
“public policy ‘ favors extending to public use and ownership as 
much of Hawaii ’s shoreline as is reasonably possible.’” 
Banning, 73 Haw. at 309–10, 832 P.2d at 731 (quoting Cty. of 
Haw. v. Sotomura , 55 Haw. 176, 182, 517 P.2d 57, 61-62 (1973)). 
28 See  Wemple II , 103 Hawai ʻi at 397, 83 P.3d at 112. 
50
  
 
   
   
 
  
    
 
 
 
      
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The Banning court specified that this public policy interest 
“must be balanced against the littoral landowner ’s right to the 
enjoyment of his land. ” Id. at 310, 832 P.2d at 731. As 
concluded by the circuit court, “the Seawall is critical to 
public access to the shoreline along the Gold Coast.” It is 
further noted that in this case, Gold Coast’s littoral 
landowners acknowledge the State’s easement interest over and 
across the Seawall. 
Impliedly abrogating the doctrine of implied 
dedication would also in cases such as this conflict with our 
court’s strong historical commitment to preserving public access 
to the ocean by vesting rights in waterways and beaches in the State when reasonably possible.  See, e.g., In re Ashford, 50 
Haw. 314, 440 P.2d 76 (1968) (holding that the boundary of the State’s ownership of public beaches extended to upper reaches of 
wash of waves, rather than the mean high tide line); Sotomura , 
55 Haw. at 181-82, 517 P.2d at 61-62 (describing Ashford as a 
judicial recognition that the “ long-standing public use of 
Hawaii’s beaches . . . has ripened into a customary right” and 
noting that public policy “favors extending to public use and 
ownership as much of Hawaii’s shoreline as is reasonably 
possible”); State v. Zimring , 58 Haw. 106, 121, 566 P.2d 725, 
735 (1977) (new 
ocean shoreline formed by volcanic eruption 
belonged to the public rather than private property owners,

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
because “sound public policy demand[s] that such land inure to 
the benefit of all the people of Hawaii”); Diamond v. State, 112 
Hawaiʻi 161, 175
-76, 145 P.3d 704, 718-19 (2006) (artificially 
planted vegetation could not be used to determine shoreline 
because it would encourage private landowners to plant 
vegetation to extend their property onto the beach and would 
thus be contrary to public policy of extending public ownership 
and use of beaches). 
Thus, neither the Hawaii Revised Statutes nor 
Hawaiʻi 
caselaw expressly or imperatively requires the implied 
abolishment of our deeply-rooted common law doctrine of implied 
dedication. 
iii.	 The State has an easement over and across the Seawall by 
virtue of implied dedication 
The circuit court in this case concluded that the 
State acquired “an easement over and across the Seawall by 
implied dedication.” The circuit court based this conclusion on 
two determinations. First, the court found that there was “uncontroverted direct evidence of public use of the S eawall as 
a walkway from at least 1952 to when [the] suit was filed.” 
Second, the evidence demonstrated that the State asserted 
dominion and control over the Seawall through its statements 
that the “Seawall is a public right of way ” and its actions in 
repairing and rehabilitating the Seawall. The ICA, upon 
52
  
 
   
 
  
     
  An implied dedication requires “an offer and 
acceptance of dedication.”   In re  Banning, 73 Haw. 297, 304, 832 
P.2d 724, 729 (1992). 
“When there is no express offer, the 
offer may be implied under the circumstances and the acceptance 
may also be implied by the nature of the public use.” Id. at  
305, 832 P.2d at 729; see also  Maui Ranch Estates Owners Ass’n 
v. Maui Cty., 6 Haw. App. 414, 421, 724 P.2d 118, 123 (1986)  
(common law implied dedication occurs “as by acts and conduct which manifest an intent to give the property for public use”); 
Wemple II, 103 Hawaiʻ i 385, 397 , 83 P.3d 100, 112 (2004) (whether  
implied dedication occurred is a question of the parties’ 
intent). For public use to effectuate an implied dedication, it 
must continue for a period longer than the number of years ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
reviewing the record, likewise determined that an implied 
dedication of the Seawall had occurred: “(1) the owners of the 
Seawall made an offer of dedication as early as 1956, and (2) 
the State accepted the owners’ offer through the public’s use of 
the Seawall since at least 1956, the State’s recognition of the Seawall as a public walkway since 1960, and the State’s repairs 
to the Seawall since 1982.” Gold Coast Neighborhood Ass’ n v. 
State, 136 Hawai i 340, 355, 361 P.3d 1243, 1258 (App. 2015). 
53
  
 
    
   
  
  
  
  
 
   
   
    
 
 
 
                     
  
 
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
required to result in a prescriptive easement.29 Banning, 73 
Haw. at 308, 832 P.2d at 730 (citing The King v. Cornwell , 3 
Haw. 154, 155, 
161-62 (Haw. Kingdom 1869)). 
Generally, the effect of a common law implied 
dedication is the creation of an easement over the relevant 
property in favor of the State. See Wemple II
, 103 Hawaiʻ i at 
397, 83 P.3d at 112 (noting that the result of an implied 
dedication of a privately owned road would be the creation of an 
easement over the road); see also 26 C.J.S. Dedication § 2 
(2011) 
(“The right conferred by common-law dedication is only an 
easement . . . . ”); 23 Am. Jur. 2d Dedication § 3 (2013) (“[A] 
right conferred by common law dedication is usually a mere 
easement while in most statutory dedications, the fee of the 
property is in the public authority to which the dedication was 
made.”). 
In this case, the circumstances reflect 
an intent to 
effectuate a common law implied dedication resulting in an 
easement in favor of the public over and across the Seawall.  
See Wemple II, 103 Hawaiʻ i at 397, 83 P.3d at 112.  Specifically, 
both the private owners’ offer and the State’s acceptance of the 
29 Prior to 1973, the relevant prescriptive period was ten years. 
See HRS § 657- 31 (1968) (setting prescriptive period at ten years).  In 1973, 
the Hawai i State Legislature changed the prescriptive period to twenty years. 
See 1973 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 26, § 4 at 32; HRS § 657 -31 (1993) (setting 
prescriptive period at twenty years). 
54
  
 
     
  The parties stipulated to extensive evidence regarding 
the State’s  repairs to the Seawall in at least 1982, 1984, and 
1993; the parties also stipulated that local and state 
appropriations were made by the relevant legislative bodies in 
contemplation of further repairs in at least 1989, 1992, and 
2006. The parties further agreed   to the entry into evidence of 
documents in which representatives of the State--including the State’s  Deputy Attorney General--asserted that “the State has 
the responsibility to maintain the public right of way over the Seawall,” the Seawall has been used by  “residents and beachgoers 
to traverse along the shores of Waikiki Beach”  since at least 
1930, and “the State has a right -of-way over all the seawalls 
and walkways.” Testimony at trial likewise demonstrated that 
members of the public have continuously and freely used  the 
Seawall for recreational purposes since at least 1952.   Both the 
ICA and the circuit court determined, and the parties do not 
dispute, that the “public has used the Seawall for both 
shoreline and ocean access for decades and has done so without 
                     
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
dedication are clearly implied from the facts surrounding the 
public’s use of the Seawall and the State’s own statements and 
its repeated repairs and maintenance of the Seawall.30 
30 The State does not dispute the circuit court’s findings of fact 
or other relevant underlying facts of this case in its application for writ 
of certiorari to this court. 
55
  
 
    
  
  These facts are more than sufficient to raise a 
rebuttable presumption of implied dedication. See Banning , 73 
Haw. at 308, 832 P.2d  at 730 (continuous adverse public use  
unopposed and acquiesced in for a period longer than the 
prescriptive period raises a rebuttable presumption of  implied 
dedication (citing Cornwell
, 3 Haw. 154)).  No evidence was 
presented to rebut this presumption, and in fact, the State 
conceded in it s trial memorandum that “[a]dmittedly members of 
the public routinely” traverse the Seawall and “use the path.” 
Further, the State itself stipulated to the facts of its 
decades’ worth of repairs and maintenance of the Seawall. In  
light of the undisputed evidence  in this case, neither the ICA 
nor the circuit court erred in concluding that the State 
obtained “an easement over and across the Seawall by implied 
31 dedication.”   Gold Coast Neighborhood Ass’n , 136 Hawai i at 355, 
361 P.3d at 1258.

any apparent interference from any private landowners along the 
Gold Coast.” Gold Coast Neighborhood Ass ’n, 136 Hawai i at 354-
55, 361 P.3d at 1257-58.  
31 Despite the fact that the public undoubtedly benefits from the 
preservation of access to Hawaii’s shoreline, see Banning , 73 Haw. at 309 –10, 
832 P.2d at 731, the dissent seeks to characterize our analysis in this case 
as leading to an “unfair result” in p art because the Gold Coast property 
owners allegedly “reap all of the rewards” that the Seawall provides. 
Dissent at 36 (emphasis added).  This ignores the very core of this case--
namely, that the public also reaps the rewards of the Seawall by using it to 
(continued. . .) 
56
  
 
    The State thus has “the right and the duty” to 
maintain the surface of the Seawall over and across which it has 
an easement. See  Levy v. Kimball , 50 Haw. 497, 498, 443 P.2d  
142, 144 (1968) (“It is a well established rule that an owner of [an] easement has the right and the duty to keep it in 
repair.”
); see also  Wemple II, 103 Hawai i at 397, 83 P.3d at 112  
(observing tha t “[w]hether an easement exists” by virtue of 
common law implied dedication “is significant because, as this 
court has held, ‘an owner of an easement has the right and the 
duty to keep it in repair’” (quoting Levy, 50 Haw. at 498, 443 
P.2d at 144)).   Additionally, any liability potentially arising 
in the future stemming from the State’s easement would be determined by “degree of control rather than mere ownership” of 
the easement. Wemple II, 103 Hawai i at 393, 83 P.3d  at 108

However, we observe that unless otherwise specified

determination that the State holds an easement over and across the Seawall in 
favor of the general public signifies that the Seawall will “inure to the 
benefit of all the people of Ha waii,” State v. Zimring , 58 Haw. 106, 121, 566

improvements thereon may “give[]  rise to an obligation to 
contribute jointly to the costs reasonably incurred for repair 
and maintenance .” Restatement (Third) of Prop.: Servitudes  §  
4.13(3) (Am. Law Inst. 2000) (setting forth principles relating 
32 to relative duties to repair and maintain easements).   In Ass’n  
of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort  Co., for 
example, this court affirmed a lower court’s ruling that an 
easement holder was “partly responsible” for costs of repair and

the holder and servient estate. 100 Hawai i 97, 108-09, 58 P.3d 
608, 619-20 (2002). We reasoned in that case that because “the 
easement [was] being utilized by both the easement holder . . . and the servient,” the easement holder had a legal obligation 
“to contribute [to] the reasonable costs of repair and 
maintenance” together with the servient estate. Id.  at 109, 58

  Relatedly, the dissent contends that under our analysis, the 
State may not “tear down” the entirety of the Seawall if it deems its 
apportionment of repairs too costly.  Dissent at 36.  We note that the State 
possesses an easement interest only over and across the surface of the 
Seawall, but that the State may exercise its authority and control over the 
public’s use of its easement consistent with applicable le gal principles. 
See  Levy, 50 Haw. at 498, 500, 443 P.2d at 144, 145 (describing various 
courses of action that the State could pursue to fulfill its duty of care to 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
contribute jointly to the costs of reasonable repairs unless the 
easement itself indicates otherwise.” ); Village Green Condo. 
Ass’n v. Hodges , 114 A.3d 323, 327 -29 (N.H. 2015) (observing 
that this rule is based on “th e principle that, by using 
the easement, both the dominant and servient estates contribute 
to its wear and deterioration and, therefore, distribution of 
the burden of easement maintenance and repair between both 
estates is equitable and just”).   Consistent  with these 
principles, the State in this case will be jointly responsible  
with the relevant property owners for the repair and maintenance 
of the surface of the Seawall--over and across which the State 
has an easement--in accordance with equitable considerations 
relating to their relative use, enjoyment, and contributions to 
33the Seawall.    
33 Thus, contrary to the dissent’s assertion, the State will not be 
required to “foot the bill” for the entirety of the Seawall’s upkeep, nor is 
it under “no legal obligation” to contribute to its repair and maintenance.  Dissent at 36- 37.  Additionally, it would be inappropriate for this court to 
speculate on a “calculation to determine the parties’ contributory shares,” dissent at 37, and such a determination is best left to a trial court in the 
first instance. See, e.g., Wailea Resort Co. , 100 Hawai i at 103, 109, 58 
P.3d at 614, 620 (affirming apportionment of costs where, following a bench 
trial, the trial court ruled that joint users of easement were jointly 
responsible for repair and maintenance costs of easement “in relative 
proportion” to parties’ usages).

  In addition to asserting that various provisions of 
the Hawaii Revised Statutes operate to preclude the implied 
dedication of private property absent the State’s explicit 
acceptance, the State also contends that these same statutes 
operate to require the State’s formal consent as an additional  
element to surrender under HRS § 264-1(c) (2007)  .  The circuit 
court and the ICA each rejected this argument and concluded that the Seawall and the real property under the Seawall had been 
surrendered to the State. Gold Coast Neighborhood Ass’n v. 
State, 136 Hawai i 340, 355-56
 , 361 P.3d 1243, 1258-59 (App.  
2015). Although the State’s formal consent is not required to 
effectuate a surrender under HRS § 264-1(c)(2), surrender of the 
Seawall to the State nevertheless failed to occur  in this case  
because the State did not hold a preexisting express easement 
over the Seawall as provided  by this court’s decision in Levy v. 
Kimball, 50 Haw. 497, 443 P.2d 142 (1968)  .

“the construction of a handrail on the makai edge of the seawall, or closing

  HRS § 264-1(c)(2) dates back to the enactment of “The 
Highways Act, 1892,” by Queen Liliʻuokalani and the   legislative 
assembly of the Kingdom of Hawai ʻi, which set special rules for 
statutory dedication and surrender of highways and roads and 
included the first codification of the present-day surrender 
statute. See  Susan E. Jaworowski, Roads in Limbo: An Analysis 
of the State-County Jurisdictional Disput e  8
, Legislative 
Reference Bureau Report N. 11 (1989).  This first iteration of the surrender statute required that the Minister of the Interior 
expressly accept each surrender of a road, alley, street, way, 
lane, court, place, trail, or bridge. See id.    By 1947, 
however, the surrender statute had eliminated the requirement of 
the State’s acceptance when such properties were surrendered to 
34 the state government,  but retained the provision requiring 
formal acceptance with respect to surrender to the various  
35 counties.

shall be deemed to have taken place if no act of ownership by the owner of 
any such road, alley, street, way, lane, trail or bridge has been exercised

” (emphasis 
added)). 
35 The difference in statutory requirements with respect to 
surrender to the State versus surrender to the counties existed at commencement of this litigation, see supra, and the plain language of HRS § 
264-1(c)(2) indicates that formal approval is not required when land is

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The codification of HRS § 264-1(c)(2) as it existed at 
the time this litigation was initiated authorizes the surrender 
of certain private roads and highways for use by the public, and 
it provided in relevant part as follows: 
(c) All roads, alleys, streets, ways, lanes, trails, 
bikeways, and bridges in the State, opened, laid out, or 
built by private parties and dedicated or surrendered to the public use, are declared to be public highways or 
public trails as follows: 
. . . 
(2) Surrender of public highways or trails shall be 
deemed to have taken place if no act of ownership by the owner of the road, alley, street, bikeway, way, 
lane, trail, or bridge has been exercised for five 
years and when, in the case of a county highway, in 
addition thereto, the legislative body of the county 
has, thereafter, by a resolution, adopted the same as a county highway or trail. 
HRS § 264-1(c)(2) (2007).  Therefore, HRS § 264-1(c)(2) sets as 
a threshold rule that only roads, alleys, streets, ways, lanes, 
trails, bikeways, and bridges may be “surrendered” within the 
meaning of the statute. Id.  
The term “seawall” is not included in the categories 
of properties that may be surrendered to the State pursuant to 
(. . .continued) 
surrendered to the State. See  HRS § 264 -1(c)(2) (surrender “shall be deemed 
to have taken place” if no act of ownership has been   exercised for five years 
“and when, in the case of a county highway, in addition thereto, the 
legislative body of the county has, thereafter, by a resolution, adopted the same as a county highway or trail”). 
Because the plain language of the 
statute only requires the formal acceptance of surrendered roads and highways  
when a county  is the grantee, the argument of the State and of the dissent, 
dissent at 26, that various disparate statutes operate to modify the unambiguous text of HRS § 264 -1(c)(2) and impose a requirement of such formal 
acceptance when the State  is the grantee is contrary to the clear text of the 
statute itself.

   The Levy  court’s description of the easement indicates that it 
was expressly granted to the State of Hawai ʻi.

144; see also  Ass’n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co. , 
100 Hawaiʻ i 97, 109, 58 P.3d 608, 620 (2002) (noting that in Levy, “[t]he 
State of Hawaiʻ i owned an easement over the seawall that had been obtained for 
the purpose of providing a path for public travel”); Steigman v. Outrigger 
Enter., Inc., 126 Hawaii 133, 139, 267 P.3d 1238, 1244 (2011) (describing the 
seawall in Levy  as “state- controlled”); Friedrich v. Dep’t of Transp. , 60 
Haw. 32, 37, 586 P.2d 1037, 1041 (1978) (stating that the seawall in Levy  was 
used by the public as a thoroughfare, which purpose had been “provided by the State”), superseded by statute as recognized in  Steigman, 126 Hawaii 133, 267 
P.3d 1238. It is noted that the parties’ stipulations and the circuit 
court’s findings of fact in this case also confirm that the certificate of title to the property on which the seawall in Levy  was located reflected an 
express easement over the seawall in favor of the State.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
HRS § 264-1(c)(2).  This court has held, however, that a seawall  
can properly fit within the general ambit of the statute  when  it 
has been expressly opened up as a path of travel for the public.  
Levy v. Kimball , 50 Haw. 497, 443 P.2d 142 (1968).  In Levy , a 
woman was injured after falling from the top of a  seawall in 
Waikīkī. Id.  at 497-98, 443 P.2d at 143.  Seeking damages for 
her injuries, the woman filed suit against, inter alia, the 
State of Hawai ʻi, which had previously “acquired an easement over 
[the] seawall for the express purpose of providing a path for 
36  public travel.”  Id.  at 498, 443 P.2d at 144.  
The trial court determined that the State was not 
negligent in maintaining the seawall and that it was therefore 
not liable for the woman’s injuries. Id. at 498
-99, 443 P.2d at 
144. On appeal, the State contended that its preexisting 
easement expressly opening the surface of the seawall as a path 
of public travel did not require it to maintain the seawall 
63
  
 
    This court then quoted the predecessor to HRS § 264-1, 
which at the time, stated that “a ll roads, alleys, streets, 
ways, lanes, trails and bridges in the Territory, opened, laid 
out or built by private parties and dedicated or surrendered to 
the public use, are declared t o be public highways.” Id.  
(quoting Revised Laws of Hawai ʻi ( RLH)  § 142- 1 (1955)).  We 
considered that “[a]lthough a seawall is not expressly mentioned 
in the above enumeration, it can be fairly implied that a 
seawall such as that which is in question here  which is used as 
a public thoroughfare is included in the term ‘public highwasy’ 
[sic].” Id.  (emphasis added).   Thus, we determined that the 
particular seawall at issue in the case--over which the State 
held a preexisting express easement for the specific purpose of 
opening up a pathway for public travel--constituted a “public 
highway” within the meaning of Hawaii’s surrender statute. Id.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
because it had only  a nonpossessory  intangible interest in the  
footpath. Id.  at 499, 443 P.2d at 144. This court noted that 
it was a “well established rule” that the owner of an easement “has the right and the duty to keep it in repair.” Id.  at 498, 
443 P.2d at 144. And while “it is the control and  not the 
ownership [of the property] which determines liability,” we 
noted that the State had “admitted that it control[led] the 
seawall.”   Id.   at 499, 443 P.2d at 144  (quoting In re Taxes 
Victoria Ward, 33 Haw. 235 (Haw. Terr. 1934)).

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The Levy court therefore concluded that seawalls will fall 
within the scope of HRS § 264-1(c)(2) when the State possesses a 
preexisting express easement over the seawall that opens it up 
to the public as a highway or thoroughfare. Id. 
The conclusion in Levy was subsequently confirmed in 
In re Banning, 73 Haw. 297, 312, 832 P.2d 724, 732 (1992).37 In 
Banning, after determining that a parcel of accreted beachfront 
property had not been impliedly dedicated to the State, this 
court considered the State’s argument that the public had 
acquired rights in a trail located on the property by virtue of 
surrender under HRS § 264-1.  73 Haw. at 312, 832 P.2d at 732. 
In rejecting this argument, we cited Levy, 50 Haw. 497, 443 P.2d 
142. We concluded that “unlike the situation here, at the time 
of the trip and fall on the seawall in Levy, the State already 
held an easement  in favor of the general public for use of the 
seawall as a path of travel.” Banning, 73 Haw. at 312, 832 P.2d 
at 732 (emphasis added). Thus, because the State held no 
37 Following our decision in Levy and before our decision in In re 
Banning, 73 Haw. 297, 312, 832 P.2d 724, 732 (1992), the Ninth Circuit Court 
of Appeals in Jones v. Halekulani Hotel, Inc. , 557 F.2d 1308, 1310 (9th Cir. 
1977), determined that the State had acquired a prescriptive easement ove
r a 
seawall by “[u]se which [was] constant, uninterrupted, and peaceful.” The 
court then briefly noted that a prescriptive easement over a seawall in favor 
of the State had been characterized by this court in Levy as a public 
thoroughfare or highway withi
n the meaning of HRS § 264 -1.  Id. at 1311.  
Thus, although the Jones court may have noted a relation between the seawall 
at issue in its case and HRS § 264 -1 generally, it was not called upon to 
interpret or apply that statute’s surrender provision.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
preexisting easement over the trail, the Banning court 
determined that surrender under HRS § 264-1 did not apply.38 Id. 
This court’s decisions in Levy and Banning are also 
reinforced by the nature of the surrender statute. Hawaiʻ i 
appears to be “one of the few jurisdictions which have provided, 
at one time or another, for vesting the fee of a highway or road 
laid out by a private party and abandoned to the public in the 
central government.” In re Kelley , 50 Haw. 567, 579, 445 P.2d 
538, 546 (1968) (discussing predecessor statute to surrender 
under HRS § 264
-1(c)(2)).  Under HRS § 264-1(c)(2) as it existed 
when proceedings were initiated in this case, certain roads and highways are surrendered after only five years of no acts of ownership. See HRS § 264-1(c)(2).
39 The fact that ownership is 
automatically “deemed” surrendered to the State after such a relatively brief period counsels in favor of an interpretation 
38 After concluding that the Levy court’s reliance on HRS § 264 -1 
was distinguishable because in that case, the State held a preexisting 
easement over the seawall, the Banning court also noted that the disputed 
trail had not been built or laid out by private parties as required by the 
surrender statute. Banning, 73 Haw. at 312, 832 P.2d at 732. 
39 Amendments to the surrender statute enacted by Act 194 of the 
2016 legislative session delete and replace the surrender statute at HRS § 
264-1(c)(2) with a section on “[c]ondemnation of public highways.” See 2016 
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 194, § 3. 
Pursuant to this new process, the State and 
county may initiate condemnation proceedings over public highways, roads, 
alleys, streets, ways, lanes, bikeways, bridges, or trails.  Id. Private 
parties are not entitled to initiate condemnation proceedings, but may “petition the mayor of the county” in which the road or highway is located to 
do so. Id. Thus, surrender of roads and highways after five years without 
an act of ownership will no longer be deemed to have occurred under HRS § 
264-1(c)(2) (Supp. 2016).

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of the statute that is more narrow than broad  when considering a 
seawall not enumerated within HRS § 264-1(c)(2).   The surrender 
of total ownership rights in a seawall or other similar  
structure after only five years, pursuant to a transportation 
and highways statute, may, for example, operate to unexpectedly 
40 deprive private property owners of such rights.   These 
considerations  inform an interpretation of HRS § 264 -1(c)(2) 
that includes a seawall  only  as contemplated by  our decision in 
Levy: namely,  that a seawall  falls within the purview of the  
statute where it is subject to a  preexisting express easement in 
favor of the State clearly opening the seawall up as a pathway 
41 for public travel. 50 Haw. at 498-99, 443 P.2d at 144.      
40 Consider, for example, that in contrast to the five -year 
requirement for surrender under HRS § 264 -1(c)(2), a common law implied 
dedication evidenced by continuous public use may only be established after 
such use of the property has continued for over twenty years .  See Banning , 
73 Haw. at 308, 832 P.2d at 730. Even where public use has continued for over twenty years, such use only creates a rebuttable presumption of an 
implied dedication. Id. at 307- 08, 832 P.2d at 730.  Further, if a party 
does not successfully rebut the presumption of a dedication, the State is 
merely granted an easement over, rather than ownership of, the property. 
Wemple II, 103 Hawai ʻi 385, 397, 83 P.3d 100, 112 (2004) . 
41 The dissent disagrees with this reading of the caselaw, in part 
based on its contention that neither Levy, 50 Haw. 497, 443 P.2d 142, nor 
Banning
, 73 Haw. 297, 832 P.2d 724, “ expressly  states that such a requirement 
is necessary under HRS § 261 -1.” Dissent at 16 (emphasis added). However, a 
seawall is not enumerated in the categories of property subject to surrender 
under HRS § 264- 1.  
Levy represents the sole case in this jurisdiction to 
consider a particular seawall to fall within the ambit of the statute, and, 
as argued by the State, the decision emphasized the legal significance of 
that seawall’s express easement in favor of the State. 50 Haw. at 499, 443 
P.2d at 144. Subsequently in Banning, we reaffirmed the importan
ce of the 
Levy seawall’s preexisting express easement. Banning, 73 Haw. at 312, 832 
P.2d at 732. Thus, based on the statute and its caselaw, we reaffirm our 
conclusion that a seawall falls within the ambit of HRS § 264 -1(c)(2) when it

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
ii. The State does not own the Seawall by virtue of surrender 
As stated, t his court’s decision in Levy concluded 
that a seawall may fall within the scope of HRS § 264-1(c)(2) 
when there is a preexisting express easement in favor of the 
State clearly opening it up and identifying it as a pathway for 
public travel. 50 Haw. at 499-500, 443 P.2d at 144-45.  Under 
this authority, a seawall over which the State holds a 
preexisting express easement opening the seawall up as a pathway 
for public travel will be deemed surrendered to the State if it 
was opened, laid out, or built by private parties and if no act 
of ownership has been exercised by its owner for five years.  
See HRS § 264-1(c)(2). 
In this case, the parties stipulated that the State 
held a preexisting express easement only over a portion of the 
Seawall located at TMK No. 3-1-033:009.  However, title to TMK 
No. 3-1-033:009 is registered in land court, and property 
registered in land court is not subject to the surrender statute. See HRS § 501-87 (2006) (land registered in land court 
is not subject to surrender under HRS § 264-1). 
(. . .continued) 
is subject to a preexisting express easement in favor of the State clearly 
establishing it as a thoroughfare for public travel. 
68
  
 
    Because the State held no preexisting express 
easements over  portions of the Seawall subject to HRS § 264-
1(c)(2), the State does not own the Seawall  or the real property 
underneath the Seawall  by virtue of surrender, and the circuit 
court and the ICA erred in so holding.   Gold Coast Neighborhood

D. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs 
Lastly, we address the State’s appeal of the ICA’s 
ruling that Gold Coast was entitled to attorneys’ fees and 
costs. Although the circuit court denied Gold Coast’s request 
for attorneys’ fees and costs on the basis of sovereign immunity, the ICA vacated this ruling of the circuit court and determined that fees and costs were permissible because the 
State had filed its ow n complaint against Gold Coast and “‘the 
doctrine of sovereign immunity is unavailing and inapposite’ 
when the case ‘deals with a suit initiated by the State.’”

rel. Anzai v. City & Cty. of Honolulu , 99 Hawai i 508, 515-16, 57 
P.3d 433, 440-41 (2002)).  On certiorari, the State contends 
that the ICA erred in awarding attorneys’ fees because the 
filing of its own lawsuit for declaratory relief did not waive 
its sovereign immunity.  
69

  
 
    “The doctrine of sovereign immunity ‘refers to the 
general rule, incorporated in the Eleventh Amendment to the 
United States Constitution, that a state cannot be sued in 
federal court without its consent or an  express waiver of its 
immunity. The doctrine  . . .  also precludes such suits in state 
courts.’”   Nelson v. Hawaiian Homes Comm’ n, 130 Hawai i 162, 168,

Transp.
, 120 Hawai i 181, 225 -26, 202 P.3d 1226, 1270-71 (2009)).  
Thus, the State as sovereign is generally “immune from suit except as it consents to be sued.” Id.  (quoting Figueroa v. 
State, 61 Haw. 369, 381, 604 P.2d 1198, 1205 (1979)).  
   
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The State’s sovereign immunity
 does not bar actions 
seeking prospective declaratory or injunctive relief. See id.  
(observing that sovereign immunity did not bar plaintiffs’ underlying claims for declaratory and injunctive relief); see 
also Sierra Club , 120 Hawai i at 226, 202 P.3d at 1271 
(recognizing that sovereign immunity does not bar actions 
seeking prospective relief). However, because sovereign 
immunity bars actions for damages against the State, and because 
“an award of costs and fees to a prevailing party is inherently 
in the nature of a damage award,” requests for attorneys’ fees 
and costs against the State are generally barred unless there is 
a “clear relinquishment” of the State’s immunity . Sierra Club,

    Gold Coast does not argue that its claims are founded 
on  any statute operating to waive the State’s sovereign 
immunity. Rather, Gold Coast contends, and the ICA concluded, 
that the State waived its sovereign immunity in this case because it filed its own complaint for declaratory relief 
against Gold Coast. Gold Coast Neighborhood Ass’n , 136 Hawai i

purporting to waive sovereign immunity is to be “strictly 
construed . . . in favor of the sovereign” (quoting Taylor-Rice 
v. State, 105 Hawai i 104, 110, 94 P.3d 659, 665 (2004))) .  
Generally, “the State has waived immunity to suit only to the 
extent as specified in HRS chapters 661 and 662.” Kaleikini ,

  Anzai  centered on a dispute between the State of 
Hawaii and the City and County of Honolulu (the County) ,  in 
which the State claimed that it was exempt from real property 
taxes levied by the County  as a result of recently enacted state 
legislation; the County, in turn, discounted  the legislation and 
required the State to pay the taxes.  99 Hawai i at 510, 513,  57 
P.3d at 435, 438.  The State filed a lawsuit against the County  
in order to resolve the dispute, alleging in part that the 
County was precluded from assessing real property taxes against 
the State based on “the doctrine of sovereign immunity.” Id.   
In reviewing the trial court’s grant of summary judgment in 
favor of the County, this court observed “[p]reliminarily” that 
the State’s reliance on the “doctrine of sovereign immunity” was 
“misleading.” Id.  at 515, 57 P.3d at 440. The Anzai court  
explained that the “doctrine of sovereign immunity” referred to the general rule that a state cannot be sued in federal or state 
court without an express waiver of its immunity.  Id.    The court 
next reasoned, “However, because this case deals with a suit initiated by the State, the doctrine of sovereign immunity is 
unavailing and inapposite.” Id.  at 515-16, 57 P.3d at 440-41.  
The Anzai  court then proceeded to explain that the “immunity” 
claimed by the State was not based on “sovereign immunity,” but ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the case “deal[t] with a suit initiated by the State, the 
doctrine of sovereign immunity [was] unavailing and inapposite.” 
72
  
 
    
 
  As an initial matter, we note that the dispositive 
issue in Anzai  was whether the constitutional rule of tax 
immunity or certain  state legislation precluded the County from 
collecting real property taxes from the State. Id.
  at 510, 57 
P.3d at 435 (concluding that neither basis immunized the State 
from such taxation by the County).  The State’s reliance on the 
doctrine of sovereign immunity was “unavailing and inapposite” 
because rather than argue that it was immune from suit, the 
State contended that it was immune from taxation by the County.   
Id. at 513, 57 P.3d at 438.   Thus, it was not the doctrine of 
sovereign immunity in Anzai  that could be relied upon to argue 
that the County could not levy taxes against the State, but  
rather, the constitutional rule of tax immunity.  Id.  at 516-19, 
42  57 P.3d at 441 -44. The parties’  arguments did not relate to  
the State’s ability to be sued or pertain to any purported  
                     
 42  We further note that no court of this jurisdiction (or any other 
jurisdiction) has relied on this statement in Anzai, 99 Hawai i  at 515-16, 57 
P.3d at 440- 41, (other than the ICA decision in this case) for the 
proposition that the State’s initiation of legal proceedings waives its 
sovereign immunity.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
rather, on “the constitutional rule of tax immunity.” Id. at 
516, 57 P.3d at 441. “Keeping this clarification in mind,” the 
court then “turn[ed] to the questions presented by [the] 
appeal,” which involved no further discussion of the State’s 
sovereign immunity. Id.

waiver of the State’s sovereign immunity with respect to damages 
or attorneys’ fees.43 
Additionally, although the doctrine of sovereign 
immunity was “unavailing and inapposite” in Anzai, the 
procedural posture of the case in Anzai differs substantially 
from the procedural history of the present case. See id.  In 
Anzai, the State filed the complaint that initiated the lawsuit 
and sought relief from taxation by the County.  Id. The State 
in Anzai did not argue that it was protected from suit based on 
sovereign immunity, nor was the issue of damages or attorneys’ 
fees raised. 
In this case, by contrast, Gold Coast initiated the 
legal proceedings.  Although the State filed its own complaint 
several years after Gold Coast’s initial complaint , the State’s 
complaint was limited to the subject matter raised by Gold 
Coast’s claims in the case . Like Gold Coast, the State sought 
declaratory relief relating to the State’s responsibility to 
maintain the Seawall. Further, the State represented that it filed its complaint because, after the circuit court’s ruling on 
indispensable parties, the State was concerned that individual 
To this extent, Anzai therefore does not provide authority for 
the proposition that when the State initiates an action solely for 
prospective relief, it automatically waives its sovereign immunity as to 
damages or attorneys’ fees. 99 Hawai i 508, 57 P.3d 433. 
74
  
 
    
  
  In addition to ruling that Gold Coast was entitled to 
attorneys’ fees, the ICA also determined that Gold Coast was 
entitled to costs pursuant to HRS § 607-24.  Gold Coast 
Neighborhood Ass’n , 136 Hawai i at 357, 361 P.3d at 1260; see

 HRS § 607-24 (1993) (“In all cases in which a final 
judgment or decree is obtained against the State  . . . any and 
all deposits for costs made by the prevailing party shall be 
                     
  
  
 
 
 45  Because this court concludes that sovereign immunity bars an 
award of attorneys’ fees against the State, we do not address Gold Coast’s 
claim regarding the private attorney general doctrine. See Nelson , 130 
Hawai
i at 172, 307 P.3d at 152 (observing that the State’s sovereign immunity 
“bars an award of appellate attorneys’ fees . . . based on the private 
attorney general doctrine”).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
property owners and other associations would not be explicitly 
bound by a ruling on Gold Coast’s complaint. Given the 
circumstances and procedural history of this case, we do not 
conclude that the State’s filing of its complaint for 
declaratory relief in this case represented a “clear 
relinquishment” of the State’s sovereign immunity.44 Sierra 
Club, 120 Hawai i at 226, 202 P.3d at 1271 (quoting Bush, 81 
Hawaii at 481, 918 P.2d  at 1137) .45 
44 Alternatively, Gold Coast argued before the ICA that it was 
entitled to attorneys’ fees based on this court’s inherent powers pursuant to 
HRS § 602- 5(a)(6) (1993 & Supp. 2004).  In support of this argument, Gold 
Coast cites to CARL Corporation v. Department of Education , 85 Hawai i 431, 
460, 946 P.2d 1, 30 (1997). However, this court’s decision in CARL 
Corporation is distinguishable from the present case , and Gold Coast has not 
demonstrated that 
the CARL Corporation  decision supports an award of 
attorneys’ fees here. 
75
  
 
     
 
  The State does not challenge on certiorari the ICA’s 
ruling that sovereign immunity does not bar an award of costs to 
Gold Coast. This court has concluded that HRS § 607-  24 “waives 
the State’s immunity for costs ‘in all cases in which a final 
judgment or decree is obtained against the State.’” Kaleikini, 
129 Hawai i at 469 n.14, 304 P.3d at 267 n.14 (quoting HRS § 607 -
24 (1993)). 
Because we determine that Gold Coast prevailed on 
its claim that the State acquired an easement over and across 
the Seawall by virtue of implied dedication, Gold Coast is 
entitled to costs pursuant to HRS § 607-24.  Id.  
  In sum, the circuit court  correctly concluded that 
Gold Coast was not e ntitled to an award of attorneys’ fees 
because the State had not waived its sovereign immunity, and the ICA erred in concluding otherwise.   Gold Coast Neighborhood 
Ass’n, 136 Hawai i at 357, 361 P.3d at 1260.  However, the 
circuit court erroneously determined that sovereign immunity 
also barred an award of costs in this case.  As held by the ICA, 
id., Gold Coast is entitled to costs pursuant to HRS § 607  -24, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
returned to the prevailing party, and the prevailing party shall 
be reimbursed by the State . . . .”). In so ruling, the ICA 
found that the circuit court had erred in concluding that costs, 
like attorneys’ fees, were barred by sovereign immunity. Gold 
Coast Neighborhood Ass’n , 136 Hawai i at 357, 361 P.3d at 1260.

  The common law doctrine of implied dedication has  deep 
roots in our jurisprudence, and nearly 150 years of this court’s 
precedent demonstrate that it  is a viable means of transferring 
interests in private property to the State for use by the 
public. Given the undisputed evidence in this case,  the circuit 
court correctly concluded that the State acquired an easement over and across the Seawall by virtue of implied dedication, and 
46  the ICA properly affirmed this ruling of the circuit court.

V. CONCLUSION 
However, this court’s decision
 in Levy v. Kimball , 50 
Haw. 497, 443 P.2d 142 (1968), requires that for a seawall to 
fall within the ambit of the surrender statute, it must be subject to a preexisting express easement in favor of the State 
46 The dissent argues that our decision “opens the door for other 
private property owners to receive free services from the S tate.” Dissent at 
38. We reiterate that this case involves uncontroverted evidence stipulated 
to by the parties, which demonstrates that for many decades, the surface atop 
the Seawall has been freely used by the public and frequently repaired and 
maintained by the State.

clearly and unambiguously opening the seawall up as a pathway 
for public travel. This requirement was not satisfied with 
respect to the Seawall in this case.  Thus, the circuit court 
and the ICA each erred in concluding that the Seawall and the 
real property underneath the Seawall were surrendered to the 
State pursuant to HRS § 264-1(c)(2). Gold Coast Neighborhood 
Ass
’n, 136 Hawai i at 355-56, 361 P.3d at 1258-59.  
With respect to the State’s remaining arguments on 
certiorari, the circuit court properly determined that Gold Coast had not failed to join indispensable parties and that an 
award of attorneys’ fees was barred by the doctrine of sovereign 
immunity. The ICA’s conclusion that Gold Coast was entitled to 
attorneys’ fees is incorrect because the State’s filing of its 
own complaint for declaratory relief did not waive its sovereign 
immunity from fees in the circumstances of this case and because 
Gold Coast has not demonstrated that it merits attorneys’ fees 
on any other basis. 
The circuit court did err, however, in concluding that 
an award of costs was barred by the doctrine of sovereign 
immunity. The ICA correctly concluded that the circuit court 
had erred with respect to this issue because HRS § 607-24 (1993) 
waived the State’s sovereign immunity with respect to costs in 
this case.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Accordingly, the circuit court’s November 29, 2013 
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law is affirmed with respect 
to the court’s determination that the State acquired an easement 
over and across the Seawall by virtue of common law implied dedication, but it is vacated with respect to its conclusion 
that the State acquired ownership of the Seawall and the real 
property under the Seawall by virtue of surrender under HRS § 
264-1(c)(2).  The ICA’s August 7, 2015 Judgment on Appeal is 
affirmed with respect to its disposition of the circuit court’s 
ruling regarding common law implied dedication but vacated to 
the extent that it affirmed the circuit court’s ruling with 
respect to surrender under HRS § 264-1(c)(2).  
Additionally, the circuit cour t’s May 13, 2014 Order 
Denying Fees and Costs is vacated with respect to the circuit 
court’s determination that Gold Coast was not entitled to costs 
and affirmed with respect to its conclusion that Gold Coast was 
not entitled to attorneys’ fees. The ICA’s August 7, 2015 
Judgment on Appeal is thus further vacated as to its conclusion 
that Gold Coast was entitled to attorneys’ fees but affirmed as 
to its conclusion that Gold Coast was entitled to costs. 
Therefore, the circuit court’s February 3, 2014 Final 
Judgment is affirmed as to its conclusion regarding implied dedication but vacated as to its conclusion regarding surrender, 
and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this

opinion. On remand, the circuit court shall consider Gold

Coast as to its claim of common law implied dedication.
