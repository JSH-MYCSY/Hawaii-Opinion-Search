SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
  Petitioner Michael L. Arkin (Arkin) was convicted 
following a bench trial of Operating a Vehicle Under the 
Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) in which the results of a 
field sobriety test known as the horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) 
test were admitted into evidence.   Respondent State of Hawaiʻi 
(State), through the Office of the Prosecuting Attorney for the 
County of Hawaiʻi, confessed as error before the Intermediate 1

2 Court of Appeals (ICA) that insufficient foundation was laid for 
its admission.  The confession of error also conceded that, 
absent the HGN test results, insufficient evidence supported 
Arkin’s conviction.  
The State of Hawai ʻi, through Deputy Prosecuting Attorney 
Jason R. Kwiat, hereby concedes that the State did not lay 
sufficient foundation for the admission of the horizontal 
gaze nystagmus test as required by State v. Ito, 90 Hawai ʻi 
225, 978 P.2d 191 (App. 1999).  Coupled with the trial 
court’s finding that the State did not lay sufficient 
foundation for the admission of the breath alcohol 
concentration test results, the State concedes that there 
is insufficient evidence to sustain Defendant -Appellant 
Michael L. Arkin’s conviction under Haw. Rev. Stat. § 291E -
61(a)(1).  
 
  Before accepting a confession of error a court must 
ascertain that the confession of error is supported by the 
record, well founded in the law, properly preserved, and 
prejudicial.  State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai ʻi 333, 336, 3 P.3d 499, 
502 (2000).  And, “great weight” must be given by the court to 
the prosecutor’s confession of error.  
But [the public prosecutor’s] confession [of error], though 
entitled to great weight , is not binding upon the appellate 
court, nor may a conviction be reversed on the strength of 
his [or her] official action alone.  Before a conviction is 
reversed on confessed error, the public interest requires 
and it is incumbent upon the appellate court to ascertain 
first that the confession of error is supported by the 
record and well –founded in law and to determine that such 
error is properly preserved and prejudicial.  
 
Territory v. Kogami, 37 Haw. 174, 175 (Haw. Terr. 1945) 
(emphasis added). 
  Arkin  contends that the decision of the ICA failed to 
apply the proper standard to determine whether the State’s *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
3 confession of error should be accepted.  The ICA rejected the 
confession of error based solely on its erroneous conclusion 
that the failure of Arkin ’s trial counsel to object to the 
admission of the results of the HGN test automatically 
2disqualified it from appellate consideration as plain error.   
See Hawaiʻ i Rules of Evidence Rule 103(d) (“Nothing in this rule 
precludes taking notice of plain errors affecting substantial 
rights although they were not brought to the attention of the 
court.”).  Nonetheless, in light of the evidentiary record in 
this case, the admission of the HGN evidence did not rise to 
plain error.  Thus, we concur with the ICA’s aff irmance of the 
judgment but on different grounds.  We find the other issues 
raised by Arkin to be without merit.  Accordingly, the ICA’s May 
15, 2017 Judgment on Appeal is affirmed.
