imprisonment.  On direct appeal, the ICA affirmed his

 to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), which a ffirmed the 
circuit court in a summary disposition order filed March 17, 
2017.  Subsequently, in his amended Rule 40 petition Preble 
argued his extended term sentences were “illegal sentences” 
under Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U.S. 446 (2000).  We accepted 
his application for writ of certiorari on July 5, 2017.  We hold 
that under our recent decision in Flubacher , Preble is entitled 
to relief under HRPP Rule  40.  Flubacher v. State , 142 Hawai ʻi 
109, 414 P.3d 161 (2018); HRPP Rule 40(a).  
I.  Background 
Preble was indicted on multiple charges of sexual 
assault in the first degree and sexual assault in the third 
degree on December 2 , 1999.  His first two trials on the charges 
resulted in mistrials.  In the third trial, which concluded June 
7, 2001, a jury found Preble guilty of three counts of first-
degree sexual assault and eight counts of third- degree sexual 
assault in violation of Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-
730(1)(b)(1993) (a class A felony) and HRS § 707 -732(1)(b)(1993)  
(a class C felony).   On July 26, 2001, the state filed a motion 
for extended terms of imprisonment .  On October 16, 2001, the 
circuit court heard argument on the state’s  motion for extended 
terms of imprisonment and sentencing of repeat offender and 
granted the motion.   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWA IʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 The court sentenced Preble to extended terms of 
imprisonment under HRS § 706-662(4)(a) (Supp. 1999), the 
multiple offender statute .  The extended terms comprised (1) ten 
years on each third-degree sexual assault count (extended from 
five years), with mandatory minimum terms of three years and 
four months, and (2) life with the possibi
lity of parole on each 
first-degree sexual assault count (extended from twenty years), 
with mandatory minimum terms of six years and eight months.  HRS 
§ 706-662(4)(a) required the sentencing court to find that the 
“defendant is a multiple offender whose criminal actions were so 
extensive that a se
ntence of imprisonment for an extended term 
is necessary for protection of the public.”  Id.  Among the 
findings of fact the court made in support of imposing extended 
terms on Preble were that “Defendant is unable to abide by rules 
and instructions and has been terminated from drug programs” and 
“Defendant has been provided with opportunities fo r 
rehabilitation including the Victory Ohana program.  Defendant 
was unable to benefit and follow the rules of such programs.”   
II.  Discussion 
Under our recent decision in Flubacher, Preble is 
entitled to relief under Rule 40 .  Flubacher , 142 Hawai ʻi 109, 
414 P.3d 161.  In Flubacher, we recognized the applicability of 
the United States Supreme Court ’s decision in Apprendi v. New  
Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000) to Hawaii ’s system of extended term *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWA IʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 sentencing.  Apprendi  held that, “Other than the fact of a prior 
conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime 
beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a 
jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Id. at 490.  The 
Supreme Court held, as well, that “it is unconstitutional for a 
legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that 
increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal 
defendant is exposed.”  Id. at 490.   
Applying these rules to the facts in Flubacher , we 
noted that “a judge, not a jury, made the re quired finding that 
Flubacher’s extended term sentence was necessary to the public.”  
142 Hawaiʻ i at 118, 414 P.3d at 170.  As we concluded, “That 
‘required finding expose[d] the defendant to a greater 
punishment than that authorized by the jury’s guilty verdict.’  
Therefore, Flubacher’s extended term sentences were imposed in 
an illegal manner because they violate Apprendi .”  Id. at 118-
19, 414 P.3d at 170- 71 (quoting Apprendi , 530 U.S. at 494).  The 
same is true of the judge- made findings supporting Preble’s 
extended sentences.  For that reason, we conclude that Preble’s 
extended term sentences were imposed in an illegal manner. 
III. Conclusion 
Because we conclude Preble’s extended term sentences 
were imposed in an illegal manner, we vacate section D of the 
ICA’s summary disposition order, the portion of the ICA’s March *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWA IʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
