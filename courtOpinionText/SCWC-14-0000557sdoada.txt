 1judgment affirmed the Circuit Court of the First Circuit’s  
February 18, 2014 “Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and 
Order Denying International Fidelity Insurance Company’s Renewed 
Motion to Set Aside Judgment or for Clarification of Judgment, ” 
relying on State v. Nelson , CAAP-12-0001040 (Haw. App. Sept. 29, 
2016), aff’d, 140 Hawaiʻ i 123, 398 P.3d 712 (2017).     
International raises the same issues in its 
application for writ of certiorari as it did in the eight 
consolidated cases decided in State v. Nelson , 140 Hawai ʻi 123, 
398 P.3d 712:    
1. Whether the ICA made grave errors of law in holding 
that Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes ( “HRS”) § 804- 51, the 
bail forfeiture statute, did not require the State to 
give a surety notice of a bail forfeiture judgment 
before holding the surety liable, thereby depriving 
the surety of the 30 -day search period or right to 
show good cause to set aside the judgment under the 
statute.  
 
2. Whether the ICA made grave errors of law in holding 
that the failure to provide notice or an opportunity 
to be heard to a surety did not violate the surety ’s 
rights to procedural due process where the surety did 
not receive any notice or an opportunity to be heard 
to contest the judgment.  
 
Further, this case is factually and procedurally similar to 
Nelson.  Accordingly, Nelson’s holdings are dispositive in 
deciding this case.   
As in Nelson, here, Ida Peppers (“Peppers”)  of Freedom 
Bail Bonds signed a bail bond as the “surety on the bond. ”  
                     
1  The Hon. Randal K.O. Lee presiding.

 Although an attached p ower-of-attorney gave  Peppers authority to 
oblige International to insure the bond, International’s name 
was not present on the bond, and Peppers’s signature on the bond 
did not indicate that she had signed as an agent  for 
International.  After the criminal defendant failed to appear, 
the circuit court entered a Judgment and Order of Forfeiture of 
Bail Bond on June 28, 2010.  The State provided prompt written 
notice to Peppers of the forfeiture judgment, and several months 
later directly provided written  notice to International.  
International failed to file for relief from the forfeiture 
judgment for more than a year after it received the St ate’s 
written notice.   The bail bond, the power- of-attorney, the 
forfeiture judgment, and the notice letters are nearly identical  
to those from the consolidated cases in Nelson . 
Because the relevant facts so closely match the eight 
consolidated cases in Nelson, and because International raises 
the same issues as it did in Nelson, Nelson controls.  In 
Nelson, with respect to whether the State was required to send 
2notice to International pursuant to HRS § 804-51,  we held that 
                     
2  HRS § 804 -51 (2014) provides: 
 
Whenever the court, in any criminal cause, forfeits any 
bond or recognizance given in a criminal cause, the court shall 
immediately enter up judgment in favor of the State and against 
the principal or principals and surety or sureties on the bond, 
jointly and severally, for the full amount of the penalty 
thereof, and shall cause execution to issue thereon immediately 
after the expiration of thirty days from the date that notice was 
(. . . continued) *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 International was not  a “surety on the bond” for the purposes of 
HRS § 804 -51.  Nelson, 140 Hawaiʻi at 134- 36, 398 P.3d at 723 –25.  
Thus, the State satisfied HRS § 804- 51’s notice requirement by 
providing notice to Peppers.  With respect to International’s 
procedural due process argument, we  held that International’s 
due process rights were not violated when the State provided 
prompt written notice of the forfeiture judgment to Peppers, who 
was the “surety on the bond,” instead of to International .  Id. 
at 725–26.  Fin ally, we clarified that the forfeiture judgments 
were entered against the “surety on the bond,” i.e., Peppers, 
and had effect as to I nternational “insofar as the judgments may 
support any payment demands or causes of action the State may 
have against International.”  Id. at 726-27. 
For the reasons set forth in Nelson, here, the State 
complied with HRS  § 804-51 when it timely provided notice to 
                                                                  
 
(continued. . .) 
given via personal service or certified mail, return receipt 
requested, the surety or sureties on the bond, of the entry of 
the judgment in favor of the State, unless before the expiration 
of thirty days from the date that notice is given to the surety 
or sureties on the bond of the entry of the judgment in favor of 
the State, a motion or application of the principal or 
principals, surety or sureties, or any of them, showing good 
cause why execution should not issue upon the judgment, is filed 
with the court. If the motion or application, after a hearing 
held thereon, is overruled, execution shall forthwith issue and 
shall not be stayed unless the order overruling the motion or 
application is appealed from as in the case of a final judgment.

 Peppers; International’s procedural due process rights were not 
3violated;  and the judgment against Peppers remains  enforceable.  
For the foregoing reasons, the ICA’s November 9 , 2016 
Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its September 30, 2016  
Summary Disposition Order,  is affirmed.

3   Notably, the circuit court discussed  whether an agent-principal 
relationship existed between Peppers and International in its February 
18, 2014 order, whereas the court in  Nelson did not engage in such an 
analysis.  Nevertheless, the distinction between the challenged circuit 
court rulings is not  relevant.  The circuit court here had 
alternatively held that HRS § 804 -51 requires that notice be issued to 
the “surety on the bond,” and that the State complied with this 
requirement when it issued notice to Freedom.  In relying on Nelson in 
its September 30, 2016 SDO, the ICA affirmed the circuit court’s 
alternative holding.
