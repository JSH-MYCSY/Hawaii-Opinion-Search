 Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Fred Y. Mikawa seeks 
review of the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (ICA) October 9, 
2015 Judgment on Appeal, entered pursuant to its August 27, 2015 
Summary Disposition Order, which affirmed the District Court of the First Circuit’s (district court) February 27, 2014 Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment (district court

judgment).1 The district court found Mikawa guilty of Operating 
a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in 
violation of Hawai #i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(3) 
(Supp. 2010).2 We accepted Mikawa’s Application for Writ of 
Certiorari, and we now vacate the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal and 
the district court judgment and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings. 
After being arrested for OVUII, Mikawa was taken to 
the police station, where he was read an implied consent form.

1 The Honorable Faye M. Koyanagi presided. 
2 HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) (Supp. 2010) provides in relevant part: 
(a)	 A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under
the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or
assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
. . . 
(3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten
liters of breath. . . . 
3 The form read in relevant part: 
1. ___ 	 Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public way,
street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of the State
shall be deemed to have given consent to a test or tests forthe purpose of determining alcohol concentration or drug

2. ___ 	 You are not entitled to an attorney before you submit to

Mikawa elected to take a breath test, which resulted in a breath 
alcohol content reading of 0.130 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. Mikawa filed several motions to suppress statements and evidence of his breath test for alcohol concentration, 
arguing, inter alia, that the test was based on his involuntary 
consent in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United 
States Constitution and Article I, Section 7 of the Hawai ʻi 
Constitution. The district court denied all of Mikawa’s motions 
to suppress, and the ICA affirmed the district court’s denial of these motions. On certiorari, Mikawa contends that he did not constitutionally consent to the breath test because his consent was coerced by the implied consent form, which conveyed a threat of imprisonment and significant punishment for refusal to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, under HRS § 291E-69 (Supp. 2010). He further contends that without the evidence from the 
breath test, there was not sufficient facts to sustain his 
conviction under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3). 
In State v. Won, 136 Hawai ʻi 292, 3122, 361 P.3d 1195, 
1215 (2015), we held that “coercion engendered by the Implied Consent Form runs afoul of the constitutional mandate that waiver of a constitutional right may only be the result of a 
sanctions of 291E-65, if applicable. In addition, you shall
also be subject to the procedures and sanctions under chapter
291E, part III.

free and unconstrained choice,” and, thus, a defendant’s 
decision to submit to testing after being read the implied consent form “is invalid as a waiver of his right not to be searched.” In accordance with State v. Won, the result of 
Mikawa’s breath test was the product of a warrantless search, 
and the ICA erred by concluding that the district court properly denied Mikawa’s motion to suppress the breath test result. Accordingly, Mikawa’s OVUII conviction cannot be upheld. 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the ICA’s October 9, 2015 
Judgment on Appeal and the district court judgment are vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this court’s opinion in State v. 
Won.
