OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J.
 
This case arises from the 2010 divorce of Anastasia
 
Waldecker and John O’Scanlon in Nevada. 
When they divorced,
 
Waldecker and O’Scanlon had one minor child together (Daughter). 
In anticipation of the divorce, Waldecker and O’Scanlon entered
 into a Property Settlement Agreement that was incorporated into
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the Divorce Decree entered by a Nevada court. The Settlement 
Agreement provided that Waldecker and O’Scanlon would have joint physical custody of Daughter, but if either parent moved more than two hundred miles away from either O' ahu or San Francisco, 
then sole custody would automatically revert to the remaining parent. 
Following the divorce, Waldecker and O’Scanlon both 
moved to O' ahu. In early 2014, Waldecker filed a petition in the 
Family Court of the First Circuit to change the custody arrangement because she had remarried and was anticipating a move to Florida with her new husband. According to Waldecker, her anticipated relocation constituted a material change in circumstances that required the family court to examine whether the change in custody would be in Daughter’s best interests. Waldecker also argued that O’Scanlon had become a bad parent, and that this also constituted a material change in circumstances. 
O’Scanlon argued that because the parties had agreed to
 
the Settlement Agreement, which had been approved by the Nevada
 court and which provided for Daughter’s custody in the event of a
 relocation, there was no material change in circumstances. He
 contended that the family court should therefore enforce the
 change of custody provision in the Divorce Decree without
 performing a “best interests of the child” analysis.
 
2
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The family court agreed with O’Scanlon and concluded
 
that because the parties had contemplated a future relocation in
 
the change of custody provision in the Divorce Decree, there was
 no material change in circumstances. The family court thus
 enforced the Divorce Decree and awarded sole physical custody of
 Daughter to O’Scanlon without explicitly finding that the change
 of custody was in Daughter’s best interests. Waldecker appealed,
 and the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed the family
 court’s decision.
 
We hold that the family court erred in failing to
 
consider the best interests of the child. Accordingly, we vacate
 the ICA’s judgment on appeal and the family court’s order, and
 remand this case to the family court for further proceedings
 consistent with this opinion.
 
I. Background
 
A. The Divorce Decree
 
Waldecker and O’Scanlon were divorced in Reno, Nevada, 
pursuant to the Nevada district court’s May 13, 2010 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decree of Divorce (Divorce Decree), which incorporated the parties’ Settlement Agreement. Waldecker 
subsequently filed the Divorce Decree in the State of Hawai‘ i on 
January 22, 2014. 
According to the Divorce Decree, Waldecker and
 
3
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
O’Scanlon were married on or about October 4, 2003, and
 
physically separated on October 7, 2009. The parties have one
 minor child, Daughter, who was born on August 17, 2005. At the
 time of the divorce, O’Scanlon, Waldecker, and Daughter were
 residents of Nevada. 
The Settlement Agreement explicitly awarded joint legal
 
and joint physical custody of Daughter to both parties. Relevant
 to the instant proceedings, the Settlement Agreement contained
 the following provisions:
 
4. Husband and Wife shall have the joint
legal and physical care, custody and control of
[Daughter].  Shared custody and visitation shall be on
a week-on/week-off basis, commencing May 15, 2010.  No
 provision is made for visitation during holidays or
school breaks such that the week-on/week-off cycle
will continue except to the extent that the parties
agree otherwise.
 
5. Nevada shall retain exclusive continuing
jurisdiction over issues of child custody, visitation,
support and related matters.  It is contemplated that
both Husband, Wife and the minor child will initially
be residing on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.  If in the
 future either party relocates to a residence beyond a
200-mile radius of Oahu or San Francisco, modification
of custody shall automatically occur then changing to
the other party remaining having primary physical
custody of said minor child, at the option of the
remaining party .
 
6. Husband shall pay child support to Wife in
the amount of $500.00 per month, commencing upon the
entry of a Decree of Divorce.  This provision for
child support satisfies the statutory formula.  Health
 care expenses which are not reimbursed by insurance
will be equally divided.  Husband shall be entitled to
 the exemption annually for income tax purposes.  Any
applicable Social Security benefits based upon the age
of Husband and/or said minor child will revert to
Husband upon the entry of a Decree of Divorce. 
Husband shall pay for the school said minor child will
attend, and will be entitled to choose the school and
its location.  In the event that Husband dies or
 
4
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
becomes mentally or physically incompetent, the
responsibility regarding choice of school shall be
assigned to Husband’s adult children.  
(Emphasis added).
 
The Nevada Divorce Decree specifically found that
 
“Plaintiff and Defendant executed a Property Settlement Agreement
 
on May 13, 2010, which is fair and equitable, and should be
 ratified, approved and incorporated into the Decree of
 Divorce[,]” but did not include any findings regarding Daughter’s
 best interests. 
In 2010, Waldecker relocated to O' ahu with Daughter, 
and O’Scanlon followed shortly thereafter. They resided on O‘ ahu 
from the initial move through the 2014 change of custody hearing
 in the present action. 
B. 2014 Motions Regarding Custody 
Waldecker filed a Motion to Change Custody, Visitation,
 
and Child Support in the family court on February 4, 2014, and
 
attached a declaration she made on January 2, 2014. 
In her declaration, Waldecker alleged several grounds
 
by which the family court could find that there had been a
 material change in circumstances since the Divorce Decree: (1)
 
Waldecker remarried, (2) Waldecker was pregnant with another
 
child from her new husband and was expecting to give birth at the
 
end of March, (3) Waldecker’s husband is active-duty military and
 
5
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
was scheduled to change duty stations to the mainland, and (4)
 
O’Scanlon had become an unfit parent for a number of reasons. 
On March 10, 2014, O’Scanlon filed a motion to enforce
 
the custody and education provisions of the original decree and
 attached an affidavit in opposition to Waldecker’s motion. 
In his affidavit, O’Scanlon addressed several of the
 
facts alleged in Waldecker’s declaration. O’Scanlon acknowledged
 Waldecker’s marriage to an active-duty military husband, as well
 as her anticipated relocation to the mainland. O’Scanlon also
 claimed to be “an experienced father of three sons” who can
 provide Daughter “with a stable and wholesome life.” 
In addition, O’Scanlon alleged that in 2009, after he 
filed for divorce in Nevada, Waldecker took Daughter and moved in with a mutual friend and “avoided making arrangements for [O’Scanlon] to have timesharing with [Daughter].” O’Scanlon stated that after approximately two months, Waldecker left to live in Reno without notifying him, during which time O’Scanlon had no contact with Daughter for a few weeks. Waldecker subsequently informed O’Scanlon she had moved to Hawai' i with 
Daughter and her then-boyfriend. According to O’Scanlon, at some point thereafter, Waldecker’s then-boyfriend allegedly became abusive, and O’Scanlon offered Waldecker money and a vehicle if she promised to never take Daughter away from O’Scanlon again. 
6
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
According to O’Scanlon, Waldecker agreed to abide by the
 
relocation and school provisions in the Divorce Decree in
 exchange for O’Scanlon’s financial help. 
C.	 Family Court Hearing
 
The Family Court of the First Circuit held a hearing on
 
both motions on March 19, 2014.
1 Waldecker agreed with the
 
family court that to change custody, the court must make a
 
finding that there had been a material change in circumstances
 since the Divorce Decree issued.
2
 
At the hearing, Waldecker’s counsel mixed legal
 
arguments with assertions regarding what Waldecker would testify
 to, and asserted that she would testify regarding the same four
 grounds for finding a material change that she alleged in her
 declaration. Waldecker did respond to some questions from her
 
1	 The Honorable Kevin Souza presided.
 
2	 THE COURT:  [I]sn’t it correct that if I’m going to
 
chang
e the custody orders that are currently contained
in a divorce decree that the court has to make a
 
finding that there’s been a material change in
circumstances?
 
[WALDECKER’S COUNSEL]:
  Yes, that–-and that–-and that
it’s 
in the child’s best interest–­
THE COURT:
  Right.
 
[WALDECKER’S COUNSEL]: 
 –-to address that change by a
 
chang
e of custody.  
7
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
counsel and from the court, although not under oath.3
 
When the court asked Waldecker specifically about the
 
relocation-custody provision in the Divorce Decree, her counsel
 
replied that she “would argue that she never agreed to that. She
 was forced--.” The court then inquired how the provision got
 into the Divorce Decree. Her counsel replied that “[i]t was put
 in there by Mr. O’Scanlon’s counsel. And Mrs. Waldecker, it
 seems that she had no choice but to sign it in exchange for
 assistance and--financial assistance.” Her counsel continued,
 “[s]he felt like she was being bribed and had to.” 
Waldecker also argued that the main reason she was
 
seeking a change of custody was “O’Scanlon’s bad parenting skills
 and mistreatment of their daughter.” In support, Waldecker
 offered a letter she allegedly wrote to O’Scanlon about his bad
 parenting. However, after O’Scanlon’s counsel objected to the
 letter on hearsay grounds, and Waldecker acknowledged that she
 had never sent the letter to O’Scanlon, Waldecker’s counsel
 agreed that Waldecker would not attempt to enter the letter into
 evidence. 
With regard to O’Scanlon’s motion to enforce the
 
3
 The court explained to the parties that because it was hearing the
 
motions during the “Wednesday OSC calendar,” both parties would have an
opportunity to proceed by offer of proof and argument, with Waldecker going
first since it was her motion.  The court interjected questions throughout the
 hearing. 
8
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Divorce Decree and thereby change custody, Waldecker argued that
 
Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-46 (2014) requires that any 
change in custody requires a finding by the family court that it
 is in the best interests of the child. When challenged by the
 court, Waldecker argued:
 
[WALDECKER’S COUNSEL]:  [N]o matter what the decree
says 
as far as if she relocates, custody must go to
father, that that’s not how things are done in Hawaii,
that the [sic] 571-46 makes it clear that post-divorce
change of custody are based on best interest of the
child alone, not-–
 
THE COURT:
  No, that’s not--that’s not what 571-46
 
says.
 
[WALDECKER’S COUNSEL]:
  46 says--says that. It says
based solely on the best interest, 571-46.
 
THE COURT: 
 That a post-decree change in custody is–­
[WALDECKER’S COUNSEL]:
  Yes.
 
THE COURT:
  --based solely on the best-­
[WALDECKER’S COUNSEL]:
  Yes.
 
THE COURT: 
 It’s not--so you’re saying that the court
would not need to find a material change in
circumstances?
 
[WALDECKER’S COUNSEL]:
  Right.  After that.  But what
 
I’m trying to say here is a divorce decree is much
like a pre-marital agreement.  You can’t say this will
automatically change custody because before that has
to happen the judge has to find that that change has
to be in the best interest of the child.  So even if
 the divorce says she gets custody, it won’t happen
unless you find that that’s best.  So that’s what
 controls, not the divorce.
 
O’Scanlon argued that the holding from Nadeau v.
 
Nadeau, 10 Haw. App. 111, 861 P.2d 754 (1993), should control
 
because the Divorce Decree specifically provided for the event of
 a relocation similar to Nadeau. O’Scanlon stressed that
 
9
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Waldecker knowingly and with the advice of counsel entered into
 
the Settlement Agreement: 
[The custody provision] was bargained [sic].  She did
 
not have to accept financial help.  She could have
 gotten financial help from someone else.  She signed
the divorce decree, the property settlement agreement. 
Not only did she sign it.  She had the assistance of
 legal counsel at the time that she entered into that
agreement.  Both parties had the assistance of legal
counsel when they entered into that agreement.  So it
 was bargained for.
 
O’Scanlon also alleged that Waldecker’s behavior with
 
regard to allowing O’Scanlon to see Daughter prior to the divorce
 
was a large factor in including the relocation-custody provision
 in the Settlement Agreement.
4
  
In response to Waldecker’s claims about O’Scanlon’s
 
fitness as a parent, O’Scanlon made an offer of proof regarding
 many of the same issues that he asserted in his affidavit. He
 argued that he was: “an experienced father,” who has “raised
 three sons already”; he provides Daughter with a “stable and
 wholesome life”; he has “flexible hours” to provide care for
 Daughter; and he has the help of two adult sons who live with him
 
4	 [O’SCANLON’S COUNSEL]:  . . . Part of the impetus for
 
their arriving at that provision is during the time of
separation Ms. Waldecker was the primary custodian
because she kept the child away from him and refused
to tell him where she was.  And she actually moved
 from state to state.  So-­
THE COURT:
  This is prior to the divorce or this is-­
[O’SCANLON’S COUNSEL]: 
 This is prior to the divorce.
That was the impetus for putting in these special
provisions about relocation.  It was to prevent that
 from happening again.  
10
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
and help him take care of Daughter. 
After hearing the parties’ arguments, the family court
 
concluded:
 
[B]ased on the relevant and applicable Hawai 'i case 
law that the parties did have a provision that
addressed relocation in the decree and therefore the court is going to find that there is no materialchange in circumstance here based on mother’s proposedrelocation.  So I am going to respectfully . . . findthat there is no material change in circumstance. I am going to deny mother’s motion. 
On May 19, 2014, the family court entered its Findings 
of Fact (FOFs) and Conclusions of Law (COLs) and ordered that, in 
the event Waldecker relocated beyond 200 miles of O' ahu as she 
planned, O’Scanlon be awarded sole custody of Daughter, subject to a visitation schedule, which included allowing Daughter to visit Waldecker for up to two months in the summer, during spring break and winter break on even numbered years, and during fall break on odd numbered years. The family court’s order also provided that upon Waldecker’s relocation, O’Scanlon’s monthly child support obligation would be terminated, and Waldecker would be obligated to pay O’Scanlon $70.00 per month in child support. 
D. ICA Appeal
 
On appeal, Waldecker argued that the family court erred
 
by failing to make any finding whatsoever that its anticipated
 
change of custody and visitation was in the best interests of the
 child, and by failing to consider or even mention any of Mother’s
 alleged changes of circumstances in its findings of fact or
 
11
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
conclusions of law. 
Waldecker acknowledged that to amend the custody 
arrangement in a prior judicial order, the party seeking to 
change the arrangement must show both a “material change in circumstances” since the entry of the order and that the proposed change in custody would be in the best interests of the child. However, Waldecker argued that her relocation from Hawai' i to 
Florida would be a material change in circumstances “sufficient to warrant the Family Court’s reexamination of existing custody and visitation orders.” 
Waldecker finally argued that paragraph 5 of the 
Settlement Agreement, which provides for automatic change of custody in the event one of the parents relocates to a place beyond 200 miles of O' ahu or San Francisco, contravenes the 
requirement of HRS § 571-46(6) “that any modification or change of child custody must be required or justified by the best interests of the child.” 
O’Scanlon argued that under Nadeau, 10 Haw. App. at
 
111, 861 P.2d at 754, and Turoff v. Turoff, 56 Haw. 51, 527 P.2d
 1275 (1974), a party proposing a change in custody from a prior
 custody order must first show a material change in circumstances
 since the prior custody order, and must further show that the
 proposed change in custody would be in the best interests of the
 
12
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
child. 
O’Scanlon, relying on Nadeau, argued that “[r]elocation
 
is not a material change in circumstance if the Divorce Decree
 
contains provisions which govern future relocations.” O’Scanlon
 further relied upon an ICA decision, Child Support Enforcement
 Agency v. MS-M, No. CAAP-11-0000387 (Haw. App. Sept. 20, 2013)
 (SDO), in which the ICA stated that a parent’s out-of-state
 relocation would be a material change of circumstances “absent a
 divorce decree or custody order provision addressing the issue.” 
Id. at *3. According to O’Scanlon, because the Divorce Decree
 specifically addresses relocation of a parent, there is no
 material change of circumstances to warrant changing the divorce
 decree. 
In reply, Waldecker reiterated that the family court
 
made no findings regarding Daughter’s best interests. According
 to Waldecker, pursuant to HRS § 571-46(a)(1) and (6), it was
 error for the court to change the custody of Daughter without a
 finding regarding her best interests. Waldecker argued that
 parents cannot “pre-decide” or “pre-determine” child custody
 arrangements by contract because any future change in custody can
 only be made after a court has determined the child’s best
 interests. 
The ICA agreed with the family court’s conclusion that
 
13
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
although, in general, a relocation is a material change in
 
circumstances, that is not the case where a provision in the
 divorce decree specifically addresses the relocation of one
 parent. The ICA affirmed the family court’s order awarding
 custody to O’Scanlon and entered its judgment on appeal on
 February 27, 2015. 
Waldecker timely filed her Application for Writ of
 
Certiorari, in which she raises the following questions:
 
1. Is Hawai 'i Family Court Rule 54.2(a)[5] violated 
by a Post-Decree Order that changes physical custody
of a minor child but fails to make any finding thatthe change of custody is in the best interests of theminor child. 
2. Can a Divorce Decree that automatically changes
custody of a minor child upon a child’s future
relocation, without any requirement that the change
made be in the best interests of the minor, be
enforced if one parent does not believe the custody
change would be in the minor’s best interests?
 
3. Did the lower courts violate HRS § 571-46.1(c)
[6]
 
by refusing to consider Mother’s arguments to
 
5 Hawai'i Family Court Rule 54.2(a) provides: 
(a) Custody and Visitation.  A proposed stipulation
seeking to establish or amend provisions in a judgment
or any order relating to custody or visitation of
minor children will not be approved unless there is a
showing that the proposal is in the best interests of
the children.  Unless waived by the court, such
stipulation shall be signed by both parties.
 
6
 HRS § 571-46.1(c) provides:
 
(c) Any order for joint custody may be modified or
terminated upon the petition of one or both parents or
on the court’s own motion if it is shown that the best
 interests of the child require modification or
termination of the order.
 
14
 In re Doe*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
terminate joint custody by showing that the best
interests of the child require termination of the
order and by instead finding that Mother’s relocation
was not a material change of circumstances.
 
II. Standard of Review
 
The family court’s FOFs are reviewed on appeal
under the “clearly erroneous” standard.  A FOF is
 clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks
substantial evidence to support the finding, or (2)
despite substantial evidence in support of the
finding, the appellate court is nonetheless left with
a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been
 made.  “Substantial evidence” is credible evidence
 which is of sufficient quality and probative value to
enable a person of reasonable caution to support a
conclusion.
 
On the other hand, the family court’s COLs are
revie
wed on appeal de novo, under the right/wrong
stand
ard.  COLs, consequently, are not binding upon an
appellate court and are freely reviewable for their
correctness.
 
. . . .
 
Moreover, the family court is given much leeway
in it
s examination of the reports concerning a child’s
care, custody, and welfare, and its conclusions in
this regard, if supported by the record and not
clearly erroneous, must stand on appeal.

quotation marks, citations, brackets, and ellipsis omitted)
 
(emphasis in original).
 
III. Discussion
 
Waldecker argues that the family court erred under both
 
HRS § 571-46 and Hawai‘ i Family Court Rules (“HFCR”) Rule 54.2 by 
enforcing the Divorce Decree’s automatic change of custody
 provision and awarding O’Scanlon sole physical custody of
 Daughter without specifically considering or finding that the
 
15
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
change was in Daughter’s best interests.7
 
Waldecker further argues that her relocation from O‘ ahu 
to Florida is a material change in circumstances sufficient to
 
warrant the family court to reexamine whether modification of
 custody pursuant to the provisions in the Divorce Decree would be
 in the best interests of the child. 
We agree that the family court erred by not considering
 
the best interests of the child as required by HRS § 571-46.
 
A. Hawai'i Family Court Rule 54.2(a) 
Waldecker raises in her application but does not 
present a cogent argument that the family court’s order violates 
HFCR Rule 54.2(a) (2000). Waldecker has waived this argument by raising it for the first time in this court. Ass’n of Apt. 
Owners of Wailea Elua v. Wailea Resort Co., 100 Hawai' i 97, 107, 
58 P.3d 608, 618 (2002) (“Legal issues not raised in the trial court are ordinarily deemed waived on appeal.”); see HRS § 641-2 (2014 Supp.) (“The appellate court may correct any error appearing on the record, but need not consider a point that was not presented in the trial court in the appropriate manner.”). 
7
 Neither party has questioned the jurisdiction of Hawai 'i courts to 
rule on the issue of child custody, despite the Divorce Decree’s provision
that:  “Nevada shall retain exclusive continuing jurisdiction over issues ofchild custody, visitation, support and related matters.”  Because we address issues of subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte, we consider this issue andconclude that under HRS §§ 583A-203(2) and 583A-201(a)(1), Hawai 'i courts have 
jurisdiction to modify the custody determination of the Nevada court basedupon the family court’s finding in May 2014 that O’Scanlon, Waldecker, andDaughter have lived in Hawai 'i since 2010. 
16
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Waldecker has also waived this argument by not 
addressing its merits. See Tauese v. State, Dep’t. of Labor & 
Indus. Relations, 113 Hawai' i 1, 26, 147 P.3d 785, 810 (2006) 
(“This court may disregard [a] particular contention if an 
appellant makes no discernable argument in support of that position.”) (quotation marks and citation omitted) (alterations in original). 
Moreover, even if we were to address this question, it
 
is inapplicable to the facts presented. HFCR Rule 54.2(a)
 provides:
 
(a) Custody and Visitation.  A proposed stipulation
seeking to establish or amend provisions in a judgment
or any order relating to custody or visitation of
minor children will not be approved unless there is a
showing that the proposal is in the best interests of
the children.  Unless waived by the court, such
stipulation shall be signed by both parties.
 
(Emphasis added).
 
HFCR Rule 54.2(a) only applies where the parties are
 
seeking to establish or amend provisions in a judgment or any
 
order, and even then, only applies when the parties have
 stipulated to the amendment. Here, neither is true. The family
 court did not amend or establish any provision in a judgment or
 order. To the contrary, the family court enforced the custody
 provision in the Divorce Decree exactly as written. 
Thus, Waldecker’s argument that the family court
 
violated HFCR Rule 54.2(a) is waived and without merit.
 
17
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
B.	 The Family Court Erred in Enforcing the Automatic Change in
Custody Provision in the Divorce Decree Without Considering
the Best Interests of the Child
 
The next issue requires us to examine the development
 
of the “material change in circumstances” requirement in Hawaii’s
 
case law and whether it remains applicable for the purposes of
 modifying a child custody order. In addition, we consider
 whether the family court must conduct a “best interests of the
 
child” analysis and enter specific findings thereon.
8
  
8 In determining what constitutes the best interest of the child
 
under HRS § 571-46, the court shall consider, but not be limited to, the
following:
 
(1) Any history of sexual or physical abuse of a child
by a parent;
(2) Any history of neglect or emotional abuse of a
child by a parent;
(3) The overall quality of the parent-child relationship;
(4) The history of caregiving or parenting by each
parent prior and subsequent to a marital or other type
of separation;
(5) Each parent’s cooperation in developing and
implementing a plan to meet the child’s ongoing needs,
interests, and schedule; . . . .
(6) The physical health needs of the child;
(7) The emotional needs of the child;
(8) The safety needs of the child;
(9) The educational needs of the child;
(10) The child’s need for relationships with siblings;
(11) Each parent’s actions demonstrating that they
allow the child to maintain family connections through
family events and activities; . . . .
(12) Each parent’s actions demonstrating that they
separate the child’s needs from the parent’s needs;
(13) Any evidence of past or current drug or alcohol
abuse by a parent;
(14) The mental health of each parent;
(15) The areas and levels of conflict present within
the family; and
(16) A parent’s prior wilful misuse of the protection
from abuse process under chapter 586 to gain a
tactical advantage in any proceeding involving the
custody determination of a minor[.]
 
HRS § 571-46(b) (Supp. 2013).
 
18
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
It is undisputed that the Divorce Decree in this case 
provides for an automatic change of primary physical custody to 
the remaining parent in the event that one parent relocates more than two hundred miles from O' ahu or San Francisco.
9 It is also 
undisputed that in February 2014, Waldecker anticipated relocating to Florida, which is more than two hundred miles from either O' ahu or San Francisco.
10 Thus, Waldecker’s arguments 
focus on why, despite the automatic change of custody provision in the Divorce Decree, there was a material change in circumstances that required the family court to make a determination of whether enforcement of the provision was in Daughter’s best interests. 
In COL 7, the family court concluded that, “to prevail
 
on a motion to modify a custody or visitation order, as a
 threshold matter, the moving party must demonstrate that there
 has been a material change in circumstances since that prior
 
order.” In COLs 8-9, the family court concluded that generally,
 
relocation of a parent is a material change in circumstances, but
 
where the divorce decree specifically outlines a custody
 arrangement in the event of a relocation, relocation of a parent

 The family court made this conclusion in COL 12, which Waldecker
 
has not challenged on appeal.

 The family court made these findings in FOFs 16-17, which
 
Waldecker has not challenged on appeal.

does not constitute a material change in circumstances. Further,
 
in COLs 10-11, the family court concluded that the Divorce Decree
 provided for the custody arrangement for Daughter in the event of
 a relocation, and thus there was no material change of
 circumstances. It appears that because Waldecker had not shown
 this threshold change in circumstances, the family court did not
 explicitly analyze whether enforcing the change of custody
 provision was in Daughter’s best interests.
 
We begin our analysis by examining the origin of the
 
“material change in circumstances” test. HRS § 571-46, which
 sets forth the criteria for awarding child custody, provides in
 relevant part:
 
(a) In actions for divorce, separation, annulment,
separate maintenance, or any other proceeding where
there is at issue a dispute as to the custody of a
minor child, the court, during the pendency of the
action, at the final hearing, or any time during the
minority of the child, may make an order for the
custody of the minor child as may seem necessary or
proper.  In awarding the custody, the court shall be
guided by the following standards, considerations, and
procedures:
 
(1) Custody should be awarded to either parent or to
both parents according to the best interests of the
child, and the court may also consider frequent,
continuing, and meaningful contact of each parent with
the child unless the court finds that a parent is
unable to act in the best interest of the child; 
. . . .
 (6) Any custody award shall be subject to modification
or change whenever the best interests of the child
require or justify the modification or change  and,
wherever practicable, the same person who made the
original order shall hear the motion or petition for
modification of the prior award[.]
 
20
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(Emphasis added).
 
There is nothing in the statute that expressly requires
 
that a party seeking to change a custody order must demonstrate a
 
material change in circumstances before the order can be
 modified. Notably, HRS § 571-46(a)(6), which specifically
 addresses modification of custody, does not require a material
 change in circumstance--stating instead that “[a]ny custody award
 shall be subject to modification or change whenever the best
 interests of the child require or justify the modification or
 change.” (Emphasis added). However, over time, the requirement
 of a material change of circumstances has developed in our case
 law. 
In Dela Cruz v. Dela Cruz, 35 Haw. Terr. 95 (1939),
 
mother brought a motion to modify a previous award of custody to
 father. Although she “did not answer or make any appearance” at
 the original custody proceeding, the circuit judge found that
 mother had “rehabilitated herself; is now remarried and is able
 to give these children a fit and proper home,” and that “the
 remarriage of the mother and her rehabilitation constitutes
 sufficient change of circumstances since the entry of the
 Decree.” Id. at 96-97. This court explained:
 
In approaching the question of whether or not a decree
of custody of a child of divorced parents should be
modified so as to give the custody to the parent
denied its custody upon the granting of the divorce,
the court is confronted with the task of determining
 
21
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
whether or not there has been such a change of
circumstances that the modification will be for the
 good of the child.  Just what change will be
sufficient to work that good varies in each particular
case.
 
Id. at 98.
 
We held that the circuit judge did not err in holding
 
that there was a “sufficient change of circumstances since the
 
entry of the decree to warrant a consideration of whether or not
 it would be for the best welfare of the children to be placed in
 the custody of their mother[.]” Id. at 103. Our ruling
 
emphasized that “the welfare of the child is in all such cases
 the paramount consideration.” Id. at 98. 
In Dacoscos v. Dacoscos, 38 Haw. Terr. 265 (1948),
 
father appealed from an order awarding custody of three minor
 children to mother. This court explained that it was required
 “to ascertain whether there occurred such a change of
 circumstances that the replacement of custody in the father would
 be for the best interests of the children.” Id. at 266. The
 
evidence revealed that father had remarried and lived “happily,”
 whereas mother had remarried, had two more children, divorced,
 and had another child with a “paramour” while working late nights
 as a “taxi dancer.” Id. at 266-67. After finding that “the
 
changed circumstances of the father are advantageous to his
 prospective custody,” we awarded him custody consistent with “the
 general rule that the welfare of the child has paramount
 
22
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
consideration.” Id. at 267. 
In Turoff, the family court granted a father custody of 
a child after ten hearings held over a period of six months. 56 
Haw. at 52, 527 P.2d at 1276. The next year, the mother sought a change of custody, arguing that “the change of circumstances, namely the father’s transfer away from Hawai' i, necessitates a 
complete re-evaluation of custody, and that the only consideration is what is in the child’s best interest at the present time.” Id. at 53, 527 P.2d at 1277. The family court 
agreed that the proper consideration was what is in the child’s best interest, but it also noted that the testimony from the prior proceeding was essential to the present determination. Id. 
As such, the family court stated that, “when the first decision was made in January of 1972, the court was aware that the father would be transferred in approximately a year, and that factor was weighed in the original determination of custody. In that sense the present situation is not a change of circumstances.” Id. 
The family court then held that the child was receiving good care in the custody of her father, and that her best interests would not be facilitated by the transfer of her custody. Id. 
On the mother’s appeal, we stated that the question was
 
“whether substantial change ha[d] occurred since the initial
 decision and order requiring modification or change in the award
 
23
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
of custody of the minor child.” Id. at 55, 527 P.2d at 1278. We
 
then held that the family court, in reviewing the evidence, “made
 
the proper factual determinations and reached the correct legal
 conclusions.” Id. 
Importantly, although the family court found no change
 
in circumstances in Turoff, it still considered what was in the
 best interests of the child at the present time. Id. Moreover,
 this court did not adopt a material change in circumstances
 requirement. 
In Nadeau, the ICA considered a situation where a
 
relocation provision provided for a change of visitation. 
Similar to the facts of this case, the divorce decree in Nadeau
 contained an automatic change of visitation provision in the
 event of one parent’s relocation. 10 Haw. App. at 112-13, 861
 P.2d at 755-56. Specifically, the decree provided for a change
 in visitation arrangements if the parties, who were both in the
 United States Navy, relocated outside the same geographical area. 
Id. at 113, 861 P.2d at 756. When the father relocated to the
 continental United States, the mother sought and received a
 modification of the father’s visitation schedule. Id. at 114,
 
861 P.2d at 756. The family court reduced the father’s
 visitation, and father appealed, arguing that his relocation was
 not a material change of circumstances that permitted the family
 
24
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
court to change the visitation schedule. Id. at 119, 861 P.2d at
 
758. 
The ICA held that the father’s relocation was not a
 
material change in circumstances and revised visitation
 
consistent with the divorce decree because when the divorce
 decree was entered, “the family court knew that both Father and
 Mother would each be ordered to different duty stations within
 the following three years” and provided for that occurrence in
 the order. Id. The ICA agreed with the family court “that a
 
person seeking a change of custody must show a material change of
 circumstances since the previous custody order, and must show
 that such a change of custody is in the best interest of the
 
child.” Id. at 121, 861 P.2d at 759. 
In Hollaway v. Hollaway, the ICA considered an appeal 
from the modification of a joint custody arrangement which gave 
“Mother sole custody regarding educational decisions made on behalf of [Son].” 133 Hawai' i 415, 416, 329 P.3d 320, 321 
(2014). After discussing HRS §§ 571-46 and 571-46.1(c),
11 the 
ICA said that “[w]hile the statutory language . . . grants family 
11
 The text of HRS § 571-46 is set forth supra.  HRS § 571-46.1(c), 
which the ICA described as “its sister statute,” 133 Hawai 'i at 421, 329 P.3d 
at 326, provides as follows: 
(c) Any order for joint custody may be modified or
terminated upon the petition of one or both parents or
on the court’s own motion if it is shown that the best
 interests of the child require modification or
termination of the order.
 
25
 courts the jurisdiction to modify a joint custody order, our case
 
law requires that the party seeking modification must first make
 a threshold showing of material change in circumstances.” Id. at
 
421, 329 P.3d at 326 (emphasis added). The ICA further noted
 that requiring a material change in circumstances: 
*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
reflects the importance of the family courts’ focus on
the b
est interests of the child in evaluating proposed
custodial modifications[.]  The prior custody order,
founded as it must be on the child’s best interests,
and including, among others, the implicit component
factors of stability and security, should not be
overturned lightly.
[12]
 
Id. at 421 n.5, 329 P.3d at 326 n.5 (emphasis added). 
As the ICA acknowledged in  Hollaway , the requirement of
 
a material change in circumstances is set forth in Nadeau and
 
other ICA cases. Id. at 421, 329 P.3d at 326. It has not been
 
adopted by this court. We conclude that the requirement of a
 material change in circumstances is inconsistent with HRS § 571­46. Accordingly, we overrule Nadeau and Hollaway to the extent
 they suggest that a material change in circumstances is required
 before the court can consider the best interests of the child in
 modifying a custody order. Rather than that two-step analysis,
 
12
 We note that in both Turoff and Nadeau, the custody orders were
 
entered pursuant to contested family court proceedings, whereas in this case,
the agreement was stipulated.  Furthermore, in those cases, the relocations
were certain to occur within the next few years as a result of the parents’
military status.  That is not the case here.  Waldecker and O’Scanlon could
 not have predicted the nature of this relocation to such a degree of
certainty.  In fact, at the time of their divorce, there were no plans for
 relocation.  As such, the Nevada court did not and could not have evaluated
whether some future, unknown relocation was in the best interests of the child
when it approved the parties’ stipulated settlement agreement.  
26
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
there is a single inquiry which focuses on the best interests of
 
the child. As this court held in Dela Cruz, the question is
 “whether or not there has been such a change of circumstances
 that the modification will be for the [best interest] of the
 child.” 35 Haw. Terr. at 98. 
We acknowledge that there are legitimate interests in
 
preventing continued relitigation of issues and reducing
 repetitive motions. However, the family courts have various
 tools at their disposal to address such situations, including the
 power to impose sanctions, as appropriate.
 
In short, jurisprudential concerns regarding repetitive
 
motions cannot be addressed in a manner that conflicts with the
 requirements of HRS 571-46 that “custody should be awarded . . .
 according to the best interests of the child” and “any custody
 award shall be subject to modification or change whenever the
 best interests of the child require or justify the modification
 or change.” HRS § 571-46(a)(1) and (6) (emphasis added). Such a
 conflict occurred in the instant case. Daughter is experiencing
 significant change in her life, as her mother has remarried and
 is moving to the mainland. The fact that the parties--in 2010-­attempted to account for a relocation of one of Daughter’s
 parents does not mean that the best interests of the child had
 not changed. Indeed, the parties and the Nevada court did not
 
27
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
know in 2010 when this relocation would occur or what Daughter’s
 
circumstances would be at the time of the relocation. 
Waldecker’s decision to relocate with her new husband required
 the court to consider whether, because of the “change in
 circumstances,” modification of the custody order would be “in
 the best interests” of Daughter.
 
A custody determination should not be so inflexible as
 
to foreclose inquiry into the best interests of the child solely
 based on an existing custody arrangement related to relocation
 that was made when neither the parties nor the court had any idea
 of what the circumstances of that relocation would be. The
 family court here did not scrutinize whether, at the time of the
 expected relocation, the automatic change of custody was in the
 best interests of the child. It should have done so, since the
 best interests of the child should be the “paramount
 consideration.” Dela Cruz, 35 Haw. at 98. 
Here, Waldecker and O’Scanlon’s divorce decree included
 
an automatic change of custody provision. Enforcement of the
 relocation provision resulted in a change from joint physical
 custody, to O’Scanlon receiving sole physical custody. Yet HRS
 § 571-46 provides that child custody shall be modified only if
 the best interests of the child justify a modification. 
Furthermore, HRS § 571-46.1(c), which governs joint custody
 
28
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
arrangements like the one in this case, provides that “[a]ny
 
order for joint custody may be modified or terminated upon the
 petition of one or both parents or on the court’s own motion if
 it is shown that the best interests of the child require
 modification or termination of the order.” (Emphasis added). 
Thus, the family court was required to ascertain whether
 Waldecker’s planned relocation constituted “such a change in
 circumstances” that modification of the custody order “would be
 for the best interests of” Daughter. Dacoscos, 38 Haw. Terr. at
 
266. Therefore, the family court erred when it awarded sole
 
custody to O’Scanlon without considering the child’s best
 interests.
13
 
IV. Conclusion 
We hold that the family court erred when it enforced
 
the Divorce Decree and awarded sole physical custody of Daughter
 to O’Scanlon without explicitly finding that the change in
 custody was in Daughter’s best interests. Thus, we vacate the 
13
 Waldecker also argues that paragraph 6 of the Settlement Agreement
 
is an “invalid, un-enforceable order and in can not [sic] be given full force
and effect.”  Waldecker failed to raise this argument before the family court,
so the issue is waived.  Even if the issue had been properly raised, it would
likely have been premature and dismissed on ripeness grounds.  The provision
provides for “the event that [O’Scanlon] dies or becomes mentally or
physically incompetent.”  However, Waldecker has not alleged that O’Scanlon
has died, become mentally ill or incompetent, and the record does not suggest
otherwise.
