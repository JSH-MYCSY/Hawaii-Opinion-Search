I. INTRODUCTION 
The State of Hawai‘ i (State) charged Kapahukula 
Voorhees (Voorhees) with, inter alia, Resisting Arrest.  
Voorhees signed a waiver form purporting to waive his right to a 
jury trial on that charge.  Following a brief colloquy, the 
District Court of the Third Circuit1 (district court) accepted

2 II. BACKGROUND
The State charged Voorhees with six offenses:  (1) 
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant 
(OVUII), in violation of Hawai ‘i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 
291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2019); (2) Driving without a License, in 
violation of HRS § 286-102(b) (Supp. 2018); (3) Conditions of 
Operation and Registration of Motor Vehicles, in violation of 
HRS § 431:10C-104(a) (2005); (4) Resisting Arrest, in violation 
of HRS § 710-1026(1) (2014); (5) Refusal to Submit to a Breath, 
Blood, or Urine Test, in violation of HRS §§ 291E-11 (2007), 
291E-15 (Supp. 2016), and 291E-68 (Supp. 2016); and (6) 
Obedience to Police Officers, in violation of HRS § 291C-23 
(2007).   Voorhees pled not guilty and his attorney informed the 2
2Under HRS § 806-60 (2014),  Voorhees was only entitled to a jury 
trial on the Resisting Arrest charge because it is a misdemeanor that carries 
up to one- year imprisonment.  See HRS § 710- 1026 (2014); HRS § 706-663 (Supp. 
2016). Voorhees’s waiver and after a bench trial, found him guilty of 
that charge and several others.  On appeal to the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals (ICA), Voorhees contended that the waiver of his 
right to a jury trial was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.
The ICA rejected that claim.  However, we hold that under this 
court’s recent decision in State v. Ernes, 147 Hawai‘i 316, 465 
P.3d 763 (2020), Voorhees is entitled to relief.  Accordingly, we 
vacate his convictions.     ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 district court that Voorhees had completed a jury trial waiver 
form for his Resisting Arrest charge.  The district court then 
conducted the following colloquy with Voorhees: 
Court:  Mr. Voorhees, have you talked to your 
attorney about your right to a jury trial? 
 
Voorhees:  Yes. 
 
Court:  Do you understand what a jury trial is? 
 Voorhees:  Yes. 
 
Court:  Do you wish to give up your right to a 
jury trial?  
Voorhees:  Yes. 
 
Court:  Did you read and understand this written 
waiver form?  
Voorhees:  Yes, I did. 
 
Court:  Are these your initials in paragraphs 2 
through 6?  
Voorhees:  Yes, they are. 
 
Court:  Is this your signature on the back? 
 Voorhees:  Yes. 
 Court:  If you give up your right to a jury, the 
trial will be held in this court without a jury.  Do 
you understand? 
 
Voorhees:  Yes. 
 
Court:  Ms. Gibson, do you certify that your 
client’s waiver is made knowingly and voluntarily? 
 
Counsel:  I so certify. 
 
Court:  I’ll accept this waiver and order 
defendant to return November 4th at 2 o’clock for a pretrial conference. 
 
On his jury trial waiver form, filed September 30, 
2013, Voorhees signed his initials to confirm his understanding 
that a jury is composed of twelve people — whom he would ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 participate in selecting — who will decide whether he is guilty 
or not guilty, and will have to unanimously agree for there to 
be a conviction.  Additionally, Voorhees initialed the document 
to indicate his understanding that giving up his right to a jury 
trial means that a judge alone will determine if he is guilty; 
Voorhees initialed to confirm that this is what he wanted.  On 
the form, Voorhees’s attorney also completed a certificate of 
counsel, certifying that she read and fully explained the waiver information to Voorhees and believed that he understood the 
entire document.   
Following a bench trial, the district court found 
Voorhees not guilty of count 6, failing to obey police officers, 
but guilty of (1) OVUII, (2) Driving without a License, (3) 
Conditions of Operation and Registration of Motor Vehicles, (4) 
Resisting Arrest, and (5) Refusal to Submit to a Breath, Blood, or Urine Test.
3  Voorhees appealed. 
Before the ICA, Voorhees argued, inter alia, that the 
district court erred by failing to conduct a proper colloquy to 
determine whether Voorhees’s jury trial waiver was knowing, 
intelligent, and voluntary.  In its memorandum opinion, the ICA 
                     
3   The ICA properly vacated Voorhees’s conviction as to count five 
because “t he State concede[d] that after Voorhees was arrested, Officer Pa 
did not inform him of the sanctions under HRS §§ 291E- 41 or 291E- 65.”   ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 concluded that Voorhees’s jury trial waiver was valid.  Voorhees 
filed a timely application for certiorari. 
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW  
The validity of a criminal defendant’s waiver of [the] 
right to a jury trial presents a question of state and 
federal constitutional law. . . .  We answer questions of 
constitutional law by exercising our own independent 
constitutional judgment based on the facts of the case.  
Thus, we review questions of constitutional law under the 
right/wrong standard. 
 
Ernes, 147 Hawai‘ i at 320, 465 P.3d at 767 (brackets in original) 
(quoting State v. Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawai‘ i 465, 468–69, 312 P.3d 
897, 900–01 (2013)).  
IV. DISCUSSION 
In Ernes, this court held that courts have a “serious 
and weighty responsibility” to “ensur[e] that [a defendant’s] jury trial waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent,” and 
that therefore “the record must reflect a colloquy establishing 
a true understanding based on a totality of circumstances of the 
particular case.”  Ernes, 147 Hawai‘ i at 323, 326, 465 P.3d at 
770, 773.  In other words, the court must conduct a “true 
colloquy” — a “discussion and exchange between the trial court 
and the defendant sufficient for an ascertainment based on the record that the defendant fully comprehended the constitutional 
rights being waived.”  Id. at 324, 465 P.3d at 771 (emphasis 
added).  Further, in order to make certain that the nature and content of the colloquy is sufficient, the trial court must ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
 
 
6         (continued...) 
 conduct an initial inquiry into the defendant’s background that 
would enable it to “tailor its colloquy . . . to ensure that the 
court adequately conveys the risks and disadvantages” of waiving 
his right to a jury trial.  Id. at 325, 465 P.3d at 772 (quoting 
State v. Phua, 135 Hawai‘ i 504, 513, 353 P.3d 1046, 1055 (2015)) 
(emphasis omitted).  After this inquiry, the trial court must 
consider any “salient facts,” such as a language barrier.  Id. 
at 323-24, 465 P.3d at 770–71. 
Under Ernes, it cannot be said that Voorhees’s jury 
trial waiver was established as knowing, intelligent, and 
voluntary.  While neither the record nor Voorhees points to any 
“salient facts,” the district court did not conduct any inquiry 
into Voorhees’s background.  And while a colloquy consisting of 
yes or no questions might be appropriate in the absence of any 
“salient facts,” the district court’s yes or no questions here 
centered around confirming Voorhees’s signature and initials on 
the waiver form — not his understanding of the constitutional right to a jury trial.  Id. at 326, 465 P.3d at 773.  Further, 
based on the totality of the circumstances here, even if it may not have been necessary for the colloquy to cover every Duarte-
Higareda4 factor in depth, none of them were even addressed.  
                     
4  In United States v. Duarte- Higareda, 113 F.3d 1000, 1002 (9th 
Cir. 1997), the Ninth Circuit held, “The district court should inform the 
defendant that (1) twelve members of the community compose a jury, (2) the 
defendant may take part in jury selection, (3) a jury verdict must be

 Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawaiʻ i at 470, 312 P.3d at 902; cf. State v. 
Friedman, 93 Hawai
‘i 63, 70, 996 P.2d 268, 275 (2000) (holding 
colloquy sufficient where, in the absence of any salient facts, 
the trial court’s colloquy addressed several of the Duarte-
Higareda factors).  Similarly, although the record indicates 
that Voorhees was represented by counsel and that his attorney 
explained the jury trial waiver form to him, this is not enough 
to outweigh the lack of “discussion and exchange” establishing 
Voorhees’s actual understanding of a jury trial.  Ernes, 147 
Hawaiʻi at 326, 465 P.3d at 773; see Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawaiʻ i at 
471-72, 312 P.3d at 903-04.  The court only asked Voorhees, “Do 
you understand what a jury trial is?”  Thus, from this limited 
inquiry, it is not possible to glean whether Voorhees truly 
understood the meaning, nature, and impact of a jury trial waiver. 
V. CONCLUSION 
Because we conclude the record does not reflect a 
discussion and exchange sufficient to satisfy the district court’s “serious and weighty responsibility” of ensuring a jury 
trial waiver’s validity, Voorhees’s waiver was not properly 
verified as knowing, intelligent, and voluntary under Ernes.  
                     
unanimous, and (4) the court alone decides guilt or innocence if the 
defendant waives a jury trial.”  This court has previously rejected a “bright 
line rule” that “the Duarte– Higareda colloquy is constitutionally required in 
every case.”  State v. Friedman, 93 Hawai‘ i 63, 69, 996 P.2d 268, 274 (2000).  ***NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI‘ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s April 15, 2019 judgment on 
appeal and the district court’s judgment and notice of entry of 
judgment entered on April 22, 2014.  See State v. Domut, 146 
Hawai‘i 183, 194–95, 457 P.3d 822, 833–34 (2020).  We remand this 
case to the district court for further proceedings.
