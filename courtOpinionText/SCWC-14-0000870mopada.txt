 I.  Introduction  
We accepted certiorari solely to correct a statement , made 
in the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (“ICA”) August 7, 2019 
memorandum opinion disposing of this appeal , that was not 
necessary to its decision and was not actually an issue to be 
addressed .  Grinpas v. Kapaa 382 , CAAP-14-0000870, 2019 WL 
3717995 (Haw. App. Aug. 7, 2019) (mem .) (“Grinpas II ”).  In all 
other respects, we a ffirm the ICA’s decision.   
This appeal arises from nearly two decades of state 
litigation over whether an easement exists across a parcel of 
property now subject to a condominium property regime (“CPR”) 
known as Kulana CPR .1  Kapaa 382 LLC ( “K382”) owns Kulana CPR .  
The adjacent parcel , known as Remnant 3 , is owned by K ulana 
Partners, LLC (“KPL”).  Robert and Esther Grinpas (the 
“Grinpases”) own two parcels separated by Remnant 3 called Unit 
2X and Lot 77J .  William R. Hancock ( “Hancock”) is the president 
of K382 and the previous owner of Remnant 3.  
In 1999, the Grinpases entered into a fifteen -year license 
 
1 The litigation is also related to a more recent federal lawsuit, during 
the course of which the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 
(“Ninth Circuit”) directed the United States District Court for the District 
of Hawaiʻi (“federal district court”) to certify questions to this court  as to 
(1) whether a claim relating to a forged deed is subject to the statute of 
limitations for fraud; and (2) whether the recording of a deed provides 
constructive notice in an action for fraud.  We reframed  and then answered 
those certified question s in our opinion in Hancock v. Kulana Partners, LLC , 
145 Hawaiʻi 374, 452 P.3d 371 (2019).      ***   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   * **

 agreement with Hancock/K382 granting the Grinpases use of an 
easement across Remnant 3.  In 2002, Hancock/K382 conveyed 
Remnant 3 to KPL  via a Trustee’s Deed that did n ot mention the 
easement.    
In 2003, as a result of disputes  between the Grinpases and 
Hancock/K382, the Grinpases and Hancock/K382 entered into a 
settlement agreement which required Hancock/K382 to provide the 
Grinpases an easement across Remnant 3.  KPL was not a party to 
the settlement agreement.  In 2004, Hancock/K382 recorded a 
condominium declaration for the Kulana CPR, which purported to 
include an easement across Remnant 3.  KPL executed a consent 
and joinder to the condominium declaration, which it  rescinded 
one year later when it discovered that the condominium 
declaration purported to include an easement across Remnant 3.
 The Grinpases  then attempted to negotiate with KPL to 
obtain the easement rights they had been promised in the license 
agreement and the settlement agreement.  After the negotiations 
were unsuccessful, the Grinpases sued Hancock, K382, and KPL in 
the Circuit Court of t he Fifth Circuit (“ circuit court”) .  KPL 
asserted counter-claims against the Grinpases for declaratory 
relief as to property rights to Remnant 3 and the Grinpases’ 
alleged wrongful interference with Remnant 3.  KPL asserted 2

 cross-claims against Hancock a nd K382 for declaratory relief as 
to property rights to Remnant 3,  misrepresentation/  
nondisclosure, wrongful interference with Remnant 3, fraud, and 
conspiracy.  After a bench trial, the circuit court granted 
KPL’s motion for partial summary judgment and found that no 
easement in favor of the Grinpases existed across Remnant 3.  
The Grinpases appealed.  Although the ICA agreed with the 
circuit court that there was no genuine issue of material fact 
that the conveyance documents omitted the easement, t he ICA 
concluded that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to 
whether KPL intended to create the Grinpases’ claimed easement 
in executing the consent and joinder  to the CPR declaration .  
Grinpas v. Kapaa 382, LLC  (“Grinpas I ”), No. 30139, 2012 WL 
503818 ( Haw. App. Feb. 15, 2012) (mem.).  The ICA remanded  the 
case to the circuit court  with instructions to resolve this 
issue. 
While the Grinpas I  appeal was pending, the circuit court 
held a bench trial on the Grinpases’ breach of contract claim 
against Hancock and found that Hancock/K382 breached the 2003 
settlement agreement by failing to convey an easement to the 
Grinpases ( “October 2009 breach of contract judgment”).  Hancock 
did not appeal the October 2009 breach of contract judgment. 
 In 2013, fol lowing the ICA’s Grinpas I  remand, Hancock 
filed a motion for summary judgment ( “MSJ”) asserting for the ***   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   * **

 first time that his Trustee’s Deed had been fraudulently 
modified after he signed it.   He alleged that Fidelity Title and 
Escrow Company (“Fidelity”)3 changed the property description to 
remove the easement prior to recording the deed.  The circuit 
court denied Hancock’s MSJ.  
 Pursuant to the remand instruction that the circuit court 
resolve whether KPL intended to create the Grinpases’ cl aimed 
easement in executing the consent and joinder to the CPR 
declaration, a fter a second bench trial, the circuit court found 
that KPL did not intend to create an easement across Remnant 3 
when it executed the consent and joinder.   Hancock then appealed 
the circuit court’s denial of his MSJ to the ICA.  The ICA 
affirmed the circuit court’s order denying Hancock’s MSJ.   
Grinpas II, mem. op. at 2.  The ICA gave two reasons for 
affirmance.  Grinpas II, mem. op. at 9.  First, the ICA noted 
that Hancock ’s 2007 answer to KPL’s cross -claim “did not assert 
fraud as an affirmative defense” ; Hancock “never asserted a 
fraud claim against KPL” ; and Hancock, as Trustee, “never 
responded to KPL’s third -party comp laint” and “never asserted a 
fraud claim against KPL.”  Id.  The ICA then also concluded,  
however, that  “Hancock’s and Trustee’s failure to plead fraud -- 
either as a claim or an affirmative defense -- bars them from 
 
3 Fidelity is not a party to this case.   ***   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   * ** 
 
6 
 contending that KPL fraudulently altere d the Trustee’s Deed.”  
Id. (citing Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 8(c) (eff. 
2000), and State ex rel. Office of Consumer Protection v. 
Honolulu Univ. of Arts, Sci. & Humanities , 110 Hawaiʻi 504, 516, 
135 P.3d 113, 125 (2006)).   
 Second, the ICA  concluded that its remand of the case to 
the circuit court was limited to the issue of “whether KPL 
intended to create easements via the Consent and Joinder . . . .”  
Grinpas II, mem. op. at 10.  Ther efore, Hancock’s fraudulent 
modification  issue was beyond the scope of the remand, and the 
ICA stated that the circuit court did not err in denying 
Hancock’s MSJ for that reason.  Id.   
 On application for writ of certiorari, Hancock argues that  
the ICA er red by: (1) affirming the circuit court’s denial of 
his MSJ in light of the fraudulently modified  deed; (2) 
misconstruing how easements are created in CPRs in its 
memorandum opinion by requiring the execution of a document 
separate from a CPR declaration and subdivision map . 
 We hold that the ICA correctly affirmed the circuit court’s 
denial of Hancock’s MSJ on the basis that the  fraudulent 
modification  issue was beyond the scope of the ICA’s initial 
remand.  We also hold, h owever, that the ICA  erred in basing its  
affirmance  upon the additional ground that Hancock, individually 
and as Trustee, failed to plead fraud, either as a claim or an ***   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   * ** 
 
7 
 affirmative defense  then also ruling that this barred him from 
contending that KPL fraudulently altered th e Trustee’s Deed .  We 
also find without merit Hancock’s contention that the ICA 
misconstrued how easements are created in CPRs.  We therefore 
affirm the ICA’s judgment, but as modified by this memorandum 
opinion.   
II.  Background  
KPL owns a 14.6 acre parc el of land in Kapaʻa called Remnant 
3.  Hancock owned Remnant 3 until he conveyed it to KPL in 2002.  
Hancock is the president of K382, the owner and developer of a 
condominiumized parcel called Kulana CPR.  Kulana CPR is 
adjacent to Remnant 3.  The Grinpases own two parcels of land 
called Unit 2X and Lot 77J that are separated by Remnant 3.   
In 1998, the Grinpases agreed with Hancock and K382 to 
purchase Unit 2X, in what was to become the Kulana C PR, and to 
be granted a permanent easement from Unit 2X to Lot 77J through 
Remnant 3.  Because the Grinpases could not purchase Unit 2X 
until Hancock/K382 completed the subdivision and condominium 
property regime of Kulana CPR, on August 13, 1999, Hancock/K382 
entered into a fifteen -year license agreement with the Grinpases 
whereby t he Grinpases were permitted to use Unit 2X and a 
portion of Remnant 3, provided they pay an annual licensing fee 
to Hancock/K382.   ***   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   * ** 
 
8 
 In August 2002, Hancock conveyed Remnant 3 to KPL via a 
Trustee’s Deed, which contained no provision regarding an 
easement e ncumbering Remnant 3 for the benefit of the Grinpases.  
More than ten years later, in an April 2013 complaint against 
KPL in federal district court, Hancock claimed that the 
Trustee’s Deed conveying Remnant 3 to KPL was fraudulent ly 
modified after he signe d it.  Hancock, 145 Hawaiʻi at 378, 452 
P.3d at 375.   Hancock alleged that the deed he executed contained 
a provision that the property was conveyed “subject to” 
unrecorded interests and that it reserved an easement in the 
north corner of Remnant 3, “at or near the location of the 
Grinpas Easement.”   Id.  He alleged that the property 
description was changed to remove the easement prior to 
recording the deed.   Id.  This allegation , newly raised in the 
instant state litigation,  is the subject of this appeal.  
Meanwhile, the Grinpases , Hancock, and K382 continued to 
dispute the use and purchase of portions of the Kulana property.  
In September 2003, the Grinpases and Hancock/K382 entered into a 
settlement agreement which required Hancock/K382 to provide the 
Grinpases an easement across Remnant 3:  
The Kapa a 382 Parties will provide Grinpas an easement 
(“South Easement”) to the Property for access purposes from 
Hauiki Road across Kūlana Place and Easement AU -2, as shown 
on Exhibit “3 ”. . . . The Kapaa 382 Parties will provide 
Grinpas an easement (“North Easement”) to the Property for 
access and underground utility purposes to and from that 
certain real property (located to the north of the 
Property) which is owned by Grinpas[.]  ***   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   * ** 
 
9 
 KPL, who now owned Remnant 3, was not a party to the sett lement 
agreement.   
On December 14, 2004, Hancock/K382 recorded a condominium 
declaration for the Kulana CPR, which purported to include 
Remnant 3.   
WHEREAS, KAPAA 382, LLC, a Hawaii Limited Liability 
Company, whose address is 4569 Kukui St. Suite 200, Ka paa 
HI 96746 (herein referred to as the “Fee Owner”), is the 
owner in fee simple of that certain real property (herein 
referred to as the “Property”) described in Exhibit “A” 
attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference[.]  
Hancock/K382 also created  a CPR map that included Remnant 3 as 
part of the Kulana CPR and identified two easements on Remnant 3 
called AU -26A and AU -26E.   
Thereafter, Hancock/K382 asked KPL to execute a consent and 
joinder document.  On December 21, 2004, the consent and joinder 
document was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances.  It stated:  
KULANA PARTNERS, LLC, a Hawaii limited liability company, 
hereby consents to and joins and subjects the interests of 
the undersigned in the property identified by the TMK 
Number listed above, to the terms of the recording of the 
DECLARATION OF CONDOMINIUM PROPERTY REGIME OF KULANA, the 
BYLAWS OF KŪLANA, and the DECLARATION OF COVENANTS, 
CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS FOR THE KŪLANA SUBDIVISION, the 
DECLARATION OF GRANT AND RESERVATION OF EASEMENTS  FOR THE 
KŪLANA SUBDIVISION and its associated condominium map to be 
recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances simultaneously 
herewith.  
 
In June 2005, KPL rescinded the 2004 consent and joinder.  
An email from KPL to Hancock/K382 sent on June 4, 2005 stated  
[W]e have asked to have the previous Consent, Joinder and 
other documents that were executed at or near the end of 
November 2004, that joined us to the Kulana project, to be 
rescinded.  The reason for the request is that we joined as 
a means to have our CPR obtained along with the rest of the 
project, and paid for, as promised by Misters Hancock and 
Lull when we purchased our remnant (lot 26).  In that that ***   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   * ** 
 
10 
 was not accomplished, we request to have the previous 
documents rescinded.  
 
(Emphasis added.)   Hancock/ K382 agreed to the rescission and 
Hancock/K382 executed a second amended Kulana CPR declaration 
(Second Amended Declaration) which removed Remnant 3 from the 
Kulana CPR.  The Grinpases then contacted KPL and attempted to 
establish the Grinpases’ easement r ights over Remnant 3.  After 
the Grinpases’ negotiations with KPL were unsuccessful, the 
Grinpases sue d Hancock, K382, and KPL in the circuit court.   
A. First trial and appeal 
On September 5, 2007, the Grinpases  commenced the lawsuit 
at issue and sought (1) a declaration that an easement existed 
on Remnant 3 for the benefit of their adjacent property; and (2) 
an injunction compelling Hancock/K382 and KPL to grant the 
Grinpases the easement .  The Grinpases also br ought a breach of 
contract claim against Hancock for his failure to provide the 
Grinpases an easement over Remnant 3, as agreed to in the 
September 2003 Settlement Agreement ( “breach of contract 
claim”).   
KPL asserted counter -claims against the Grinpases for 
declaratory relief as to property rights to Remnant 3 and the 
Grinpases’ wrongful interference with Remnant 3.   
KPL asserted cross -claims against Hancock and K382 for 
declaratory relief as to property rights to Remnant 3, 
misrepresentation/nondisclosu re, wrongful interference with ***   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   * ** 
 
11 
 Remnant 3, fraud, and conspiracy.  Hancock did not file a 
counter-claim or cross -claim.   
KPL filed a motion for partial summary judgment on March 
30, 2009, seeking a determination that there was no easement 
burdening Remnant  3.  In August 2009, the circuit court granted 
KPL’s motion for partial summary judgment, finding “there is no 
access and utilities easement in favor of [the Grinpases] over, 
across, through or encumbering the KPL Property [Remnant 3.]”    
The Grinpases app ealed that determination to the ICA, which 
similarly concluded  that “the Trustee’s Deed accurately reflects 
that there was no express easement over Remnant 3 at that time ,” 
and that KPL was entitled to summary judgment on that issue.   
Grinpas I , mem. op. at 12.   The ICA h eld, however,  that “there 
[were] genuine issues of material fact as to whether KPL 
intended to create easements via the Consent and Joinder.”  
Grinpas I , mem. op. at 13 .  The ICA therefore  vacated the 
circuit court’s August 3, 2009 jud gment and remanded the case 
for further proceedings.  Grinpas I , mem. op. at 22.  
While the ICA appeal was pending, the circuit court held a 
bench trial on the Grinpases’ breach of contract claim against 
Hancock.  On October 23, 2009, the court found that H ancock/K382 
breached the 2003 settlement agreement by “fail[ing] to convey 
either the north easement or the south easement [to the 
Grinpases.]”  Accordingly, the circuit court entered judgment ***   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   * ** 
 
12 
 against Hancock and Kapaa 382 in the amount of $146,239.01.  
Hancock did not appeal the October 2009 breach of contract 
judgment.   
1. Hancock’s MSJ   
On February 15, 2013, following the ICA’s Grinpas I  remand, 
Hancock filed an MSJ.  In it, he argued for the first time that 
the Trustee’s Deed he signed was fraudulently modified to omit 
the easement in favor of the Grinpases.  In his memorandum in 
support of the motion, Hancock explained how the deed he signed 
contained an easement, but Fidelity altered  the deed after 
closing.  Hancock attached copies of both deeds, as well as a 
memorandum written by one Fidelity employee and addressed to 
another “advising that the pages of the executed deeds were to 
be altered.”   
Hancock also argued there was no genuin e issue of material 
fact as to whether KPL knew that the Grinpas easement burdened 
Remnant 3 because Steven Lee, the attorney who prepared the 
Kulana CPR map, was also KPL’s attorney and his knowledge “is 
imputed to KPL as a matter of agency law.”   
In March 2013, the circuit court denied Hancock’s MSJ, 
noting that its prior determination on the breach of contract 
claim, which was affirmed by the ICA in Grinpas I , established 
that no easement existed and that the recorded Trustee’s Deed 
was accurate.   ***   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   * ** 
 
13 
 2. Hancock’s federal district court case  
Meanwhile, in April 2013, Hancock filed a complaint against 
Fidelity and KPL in federal district court, alleging fraudulent 
modification of his Trustee’s Deed to remove the easement  and 
also asserting that the alleged fraudulent modification was not 
discovered until 2013 .  Hancock, 145 Hawaiʻi at 378, 452 P.3d at 
375.  Fidelity filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, and 
KPL filed motion s to dismiss, arguing that Hancock ’s claims had 
already been adjudicated in Grinpas I  and that they were 
untimely under Hawaiʻi’s six-year statute of limitations.   Id.   
The federal district court dismissed Hancock’s complaint, 
finding his claims barred by the Hawaiʻi statute of limitations 
for fraud.  145 Hawaiʻi at 379, 452 P.3d at 376.  Ultimately, the 
federal court’s judgment was appealed to the Ninth Circuit, 
which directed the federal district court to certify questions 
to this court concerning the fraudulent modification claim and 
any applicable statute of limitations .  145 Hawaiʻi at 380, 452 
P.3d at 377.   This court answered the certified questions, and 
the case is now pending before  the federal court.  
B. Second trial 
In 2013, pursuant to the ICA’s remand instructions in 
Grinpas I , the circuit court conducted a second bench trial  on 
the issue of whether KPL intended to create the Grinpases ’ 
claimed easement in executing the consent and joinder to the CPR ***   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   * ** 
 
14 
 declaration .  On October 22, 2013, the circuit court issued 
findings of fact and conclusions of law as to the second bench 
trial.  The circuit court found, among other things, that “KPL 
did not intend, agree or consent to being included in the K382 
CPR” and that “KPL did not intend through the Consent and 
Joinder to create or grant easements over Remnant 3, including 
AU-26A and AU -26B, benefitting Grinpas or Grinpas’ Property.”   
The circuit  court also entered a final judgment on October 
22, 2013.  On May 23, 2014, the circuit court entered an amended 
final judgment finding.   
C. ICA proceedings  
In June 2014, Hancock filed a notice of appeal of the 
amended final judgment.  Hancock argued that  (1) KPL produced no 
evidence to rebut Hancock’s claim that the Trustee’s Deed was 
fraudulently modified ; (2) KPL breached its agreement that the 
sale of Remnant 3 was conditioned on the existence of the 
Grinpas easement, so it cannot maintain an action on that 
agreement; and (3) the attorney who drafted the consent and 
joinder document represented KPL, so h is knowledge of the 
easement is imputed to KPL.   
On August 7, 2019, the ICA issued its memorandum opinion in 
Grinpas II .  First, the ICA noted that , as Hancock had failed to 
appeal from the October 2009 breach of contract judgment, the 
findings of fact in  the October 2009 Order were final and ***   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   * ** 
 
15 
 binding on Hancock and he was precluded from raising them 
pursuant to the doctrine of collateral estoppel.   Grinpas II , 
mem. op. at 7 -8.  In addition, the legal issues decided in 
Grinpas I  applied in this appeal due t o the doctrine of “law of 
the case” and therefore no express easement over Remnant 3 
existed at the time Remnant 3 was conveyed by Trustee’s Deed to 
KPL.  Grinpas II , mem. op. at 8.  
The ICA also held that Hancock was barred from raising 
fraud on appeal because Hancock never asserted a fraud claim 
against KPL or pled fraud as an affirmative defense.   Grinpas 
II, mem. op. at 9.   The ICA also held that Hancock’s claims of 
fraud were precluded by the  circuit court’s 2009 factual 
findings on the breach  of contract claim, which Hancock did not 
appeal: 
Hancock’s contention of fraud . . . [is] predicated upon 
the existence of an easement actually burdening Remnant 3.  
That is inconsistent with the finding s of fact set forth in 
the October 2009 Order which, because the Breach of 
Contract Judgment is final and non -appealable, precludes 
Hancock from relitigating the issue of whether Remnant 3 is 
burden by an easement in favor of the Grinpases . . . The 
Trustee’s Deed could not have been altered to eliminate 
reference to an easement that did not exist . . . The law 
of the case is that the Trustee’s Deed “accurately reflects 
that there was no express easement over Remnant 3 at that 
time.”  
 
Grinpas II , mem. op. at 9 -10 (quoting Grinpas I , mem. op. at 12) 
(footnote omitted) ).  The ICA then also concluded that 
“Hancock’s and Trustee’s failure to plead fraud -- either as a 
claim or an affirmative defense -- bars them from contending ***   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   * ** 
 
16 
 that KPL fraudulently altered the Trustee’s Deed.”  Grinpas II , 
mem. opp. at 9.   
 The ICA held that the circuit court did not err in 
denying Hancock’s MSJ.   Grinpas II , mem. op. at 10.   
Accordingly, the ICA affirmed the circuit court’s second amended 
final judgment.   Grinpas II , mem. op. at 27.   The ICA entered 
its judgment on appeal on September 9, 2019.    
III.  Standard of Review  
 “On appeal, the grant or denial o f summary judgment is 
reviewed de novo.”  Ralston v. Yim , 129 Hawaiʻi 46, 55, 292 P.3d 
1276, 1285 (2013) (citations omitted).  
IV.  Discussion  
 On certiorari, Hancock asserts that the ICA erred in 
affirming the circuit court’s denial of his MSJ, which precluded 
him from litigating , in this proceeding, the newly raised 
fraudulent modification issue.  He also asserts that the ICA 
misconstrue d, in its memorandum opinion, how easements are 
created in CPRs.  Neither contention is persuasive.  
A. The fraudulent modification issue, raised for the first 
 time in this case in Hancock’s MSJ, was beyond the scope of 
 the ICA’s Grinpas I  remand. 
 
 On certiorari, Hancock argues that the circuit court 
improperly precluded consideration of the fraudulent 
modification issue.  We disagree.  T he circuit court and the ICA 
correctly concluded  that the fraudulent modification issue, ***   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   * ** 
 
17 
 raised for the first time  in Hancock’s  MSJ, was beyond the scope 
of the ICA’s Grinpas I  remand instructions.  
 Hancock argues that the ICA vacated the circuit court’s 
entire judgment in Grinpas I , so he was permitted to raise the 
fraudulent modification  argument on remand in his M SJ.  This 
argument fails, however, because the ICA explicitly limited the 
scope of remand  in Grinpas I  to the issue of  whether KPL 
intended to create an easement when it executed the consent and 
joinder.  In Grinpas I , the ICA held “the Trustee’s Deed 
accurately reflects that there was no express easement over 
Remnant 3 at that time.  KPL is entitled to summary judgment on 
this issue.”  Grinpas I , mem. op. at 12 .  The ICA concluded , 
however,  that “there [were] genuine issues of material fact as 
to whether K PL intended to create easements via the Consent and 
Joinder.”  Grinpas I , mem. op. at 13 .  On that limited issue, 
the ICA “ vacate[d] the judgment entered by the circuit court on 
August 3, 2009, and . . . remand[ed] this case for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.”  Grinpas I , mem. op.

(2010) provides, “the p hrase ‘vacate and remand’ indicates the 
litigation continues in the court or agency in accordance with 
the appellate court’s instruction .” (Emphasis added).  In 
addition, the law of the case doctrine  generally  “operates to ***   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   * **

 foreclose re -examination of decid ed issues either on remand or 
on a subsequent appeal[.]”  Hussey v. Say , 139 Hawaiʻi 181, 186, 
384 P.3d 1282, 1287 (2016).   Pursuant to HRAP Rule 35(e) and the 
law of the case doctrine, the circuit court was not permitted, 
in Grinpas II , to address a new issue not contemplated by the 
ICA’s decision in Grinpas I  or to re -decide an issue the ICA had 
already resolved .  Therefore, the circuit court correctly denied 
Hancock’s MSJ, and the ICA correctly affirmed the denial, on the 
sole ground that the fraudulent modification issue was beyond 
the scope of the Grinpas I  remand.  
We note, however, that it was unnecessary for the ICA to go 
on to hold that another basis for affirming the denial of 
Hancock’s MSJ was that Hancock, in his individual ca pacity or as 
Trustee, failed to “plead fraud -- either as a claim or an 
affirmative defense,” and such failure “bars them from 
contending that KPL fraudulently altered the Trustee’s Deed.”  
Grinpas II , mem. op. at 9.  It was not error for the ICA to note 
that Hancock had not pled fraud in the state court action ; 
however, the issue of whether Hancock waived his claim that KPL 
fraudulently altered the Tru stee’s Deed  by not including it in 
pleadings filed before he allegedly became aware of the fraud  
was not p roperly before the ICA.  As we noted earlier, Hancock 
filed a 2013 federal complaint against Fidelity and KPL, 
alleging fraudulent modification of the Trustee’s Deed  allegedly ***   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   * **

 discovered in 2013 , and the case is pending.  Hancock, 145 
Hawaiʻi 374, 452 P.3d 371.   Thus, the ICA’s unnecessary statement 
that Hancock’s failure to plead fraudulent modification in the 
instant state case “bars” him from raising the fraudulent 
modification claim , which was beyond the scope of its remand 
order, could be  read broadly as a holding on claim preclusion .  
The statement was not necessary to the ICA’s decision as the ICA 
properly ruled that the issue was beyond the scope of its remand 
order, and whether or not failure to previously plea d fraudulent 
modification  barred Hancock from asserting a claim allegedly not 
discovered until 2013 was not an issue on appeal to have been 
ruled on by the ICA in Grinpas II .    
B. The ICA did not misconstrue how easements are created in 
 CPRs. 
 
On certiorari, Hancock also argues that the ICA “ disregards 
the manner in which easements are generally created in the 
development process[],” which is by adding them to “the CPR 
declaration” and “to maps under the individual county 
subdivision ordinances.”  Hancock argues that the s ubdivision 
and condominium map (created after the conveyance to KPL) notes 
the easement.  Therefore, he argues, the easement exists, 
disregarding that the issue on remand was whether KPL intended 
to create the easement by executing a consent and joinder to  the 
CPR documents , and the circuit court’s conclusion that KPL did ***   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   * ** 
 
20 
 not.  
He points to the following statement in the ICA’s Grinpas 
II memorandum opinion to show that the ICA erroneously requires 
easements to be created by a separate conveyance document:  “The 
only possibility for the Grinpases  to be entitled to an easement 
over Remnant 3 would be if ‘KPL intended to create easements via 
the Consent and Joinder. ’”  Grinpas II , mem. op. at 8, quoting 
Grinpas I , mem. op. at 13.  Hancock takes this sentence from the 
ICA’s dispositions out of co ntext.  In Grinpas I , the ICA 
concluded that the conveyance documents did not contain an 
easement in favor of the Grinpases, but it remanded the case to 
the circuit court on the issue of whether KPL’s subsequent 
consent and joinder to the CPR documents evidenced an intent to 
create an easement.  Grinpas I , mem. op. at 13.  This sentence 
in the ICA’s Grinpas II  memorandum opinion merely restates the 
limited issue in the Grinpas I  remand:  whether KPL’s execution 
of the consent and joinder indicated its intent to  create an 
easement in favor of the Grinpases.  Grinpas I , mem. op. at 13.  
This sentence does not reflect any misunderstanding on the part 
of the ICA as to how easements are created in CPRs.
