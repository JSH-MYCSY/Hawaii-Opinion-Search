OPINION OF THE COURT  BY McKENNA, J.
 
  
I. Introduction 
This case arises out of a custody dispute regarding 
physical custody of B.C.B.T., born in 2006 (“ Son
”). Son’s 
mother, Brelie Gail B alon Tumaneng (“Mother”), moved to modify

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
custody terms contained in an uncontested decree filed in her 
divorce from Son’s father, Brixon Andres Tumaneng (“Father”). 
Mother alleges she should have been allowed to present 
evidence of Father’s pre -decree domestic violence at the trial 
on her motion. Intermediate Court of Ap peals (“ICA”) precedent 
at the time required the Family Court of the First Circuit 
(“family court”)1  to find a material change in circumstances 
before it could reconsider the original custody order. A 
majority of the ICA ruled that Mother had failed to show how 
alleged pre-decree domestic violence related to the material change in circumstances the family court preliminarily found to 
exist. See
 Tumaneng v. Tumaneng , No. CAAP-14-0000895, at 2 
(App. Oct. 26, 2015) (SDO). The ICA therefore ruled that the 
family court properly excluded evidence of alleged pre-decree 
domestic violence on relevance grounds because such evidence was 
not related to the material change in circumstances 
preliminarily found to exist by the family court, which was Father’s relocation to Arizona and Mother’s possible move away 
from Hawaiʻ i with her new husband. 
In 
Waldecker v. O’Scanlon , 137 Hawai ʻi 460, 375 P.3d 239 
(2016), we recently overruled several ICA cases to the extent 
they suggested that a material change in circumstances is

required before a court can consider the best interests of a 
child in modifying a custody order.   See  id.   at 470, 375 P.3d at 
249. We stated, “Rather than [a] two -step analysis, there is a 
single inquiry which focuses on the best interests of the 
child.” Id.  We held that the requirement of a material change  
in circumstances is inconsistent with  HRS § 571-46 (2014).    See  
id. We also noted that “ jurisprudential concerns regarding 
repetitive motions cannot be addressed in a manner that 
conflicts with the requirements of HRS 571–46  that ‘custody 
should be awarded . . .  according to the best interests of the 
child’ and ‘any custody award shall be subject to modification 
or change whenever  the best interests of the child require or 
justify the modification or change. ’”   Id.   (citing HRS § 571 – 
46(a)(1), (6)) (emphasis in original).  
In addition, as pointed out by Judge Ginoza in 
her dissent 
from the ICA majority in this case, HRS § 571-46(a)(9) provides 
that in child custody proceedings, “a determination by the court 
that family violence has been committed by a parent raises a 
rebuttable presumption that it is detrimental to the child and 
not in the best interest of the child to be placed in . . . 
custody . . . with the perpetrator of family violence.” See 
Tumaneng, SDO Dissent at 7 (Ginoza, J., dissenting) (discussing 
HRS § 571-46(a)(9)).

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
We therefore hold that the family court erred by excluding 
evidence of alleged pre-decree domestic violence in making its 
custody determination. Accordingly, we remand this case to the 
family court for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion. 
II. Background 
A. Factual Background 
Son was born in 2006.  At the time of his birth, both 
Mother and Father had not finished high school.   Son lived with 
Mother and her parents;  Father visited after school.  Mother and 
Father married on August 19, 2008, but Father still did not live 
with Mother and Son.   Father enlisted in the Air Force in early 
2010. When Father was stationed in Japan later that year,  
Mother and Son joined him.  In 2012, Father remained in Japan 
and Mother and Son returned to Hawai ʻi from Japan.   
After returning to Hawaiʻ i, Mother filed for divorce on 
December 13, 2012, and asked that physical custody of Son be 
awarded solely to her. In his answer, Father indicated that he 
and Mother had agreed that she would have temporary physical 
custody of Son, but that he intended to take physical custody of 
Son should he be stationed in the United States. He stated that 
he sought physical custody due to Mother’s alleged marital 
infidelity, stating that he would be providing a witness statement regarding this allegation.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
About three weeks later, on January 3, 2013, Mother signed 
Father’s proposed uncontested divorce decree, which was later 
approved by the family court and filed on April 4, 2013 
(“Decree”). The Decree provided that physical custody of Son 
would be temporarily awarded to Mother until September 2013 then 
permanently to Husband after September 2013.  Details regarding 
time sharing were reflected in a Proposed Parenting Plan 
(“Plan”) also prepared by Father and signed by both parents. 
The Plan stated that physical custody of Son should be awarded 
to Father after his relocation to the U.S. and that Mother 
should have visitation every other weekend from Friday at 2:00 
p.m., to Sunday at 6:00 p.m. Further, the Plan provided that 
time with Son during vacations and school breaks would be split 
in half between Mother and Father, and that each parent would 
have half the day on Son’s birthdays. The “out-of-state 
visitation” space was left blank. 
Two months after the April 4, 2013 Decree, Mother remarried 
a servicemember who was scheduled to be re-stationed in Germany  , 
although it was unclear whether she also intended to leave 
Hawaiʻi.    
B. Post-decree Motion to Modify Custody Arrangement 
On August 7, 2013, four months after the Decree, the family 
court received Mother’s pro se Motion and Declaration for Post-
Decree Relief (“Motion”) . Mother requested a change to give her

physical custody of Son, alleging that circumstances had changed  
(as required by the form) because Father planned to move Son out 
of Oahu to Arizona in October 2013.  She asserted that he was a 
single father and that she had visitation rights.      
Mother also requested an expedited hearing
, but this 
request was denied on August 22, 2013. On October 9, 2013, 
Father responded pro se to M other’s Motion through a letter 
dated October 7, 2013.  The letter alleged that Mother had been 
aware of the relocation and requested that custody arrangement 
in the Decree not be changed. Father also filed a “ Proposed 
Parenting Plan (After Relocation),” suggesting changes to 
Mother’s visitation schedule. 
On October 15, 2013, Mother filed a pro se ex parte motion 
to prevent Father from relocating Son.  Mother noted that the 
original Decree did not state that Son would be relocated. She 
asserted that she had agreed to full custody to Husband because 
she had been “afraid and confused.” She indicated she was 
trying to regain full custody of Son. She noted that the Decree 
had provided her with regular time sharing, but that Father had said he would be relocating with Son to Arizona on October 21, 
2013. The family court ordered that Son not be removed from the 
state until Mother’s Motion was decided. 
Mother then retained counsel, and filed a declaration on 
October 22, 2013, stating in part:

   Mother, with counsel, appeared at a  November 6, 2013 
hearing before the family court  to determine whether a material 
change of circumstances existed that would allow modification of 
the custody arrangement contained in the Decree.  Father 
appeared pro se by telephone. Mother testified  that she had 
signed the Decree requiring her to  hand over physical custody of 
Son because she felt threatened by Father’s answer indicating he 
would take Son away from her forever.  Father indicated that

5. [Father] for a long time had only part time jobs, but 
in March of 2010 he joined the military. In September of 
2010 he was stationed in Japan. In October of 2010, [Son] 
and I went to Japan to join him. 
6. While we were in Japan, I was always the one who took 
care of [Son]. [Father] never bathed him or fed him or 
put him to bed. 
7. It was very difficult for us in Japan, as [Father] 
would often hit me and I would have to leave the house, 
quickly so I would not be hurt further, and if I had time I 
always tried to take . . . [Son] with me so he would be 
safe, but sometimes I was forced to leave him behind, I was 
so scared. 
8. I spoke to my mother and she told me to come home, 
since there was no reason for me to s tay there and let him 
hit me all the time. 
9. [Son] and I returned to Hawai
i in September of 2012 
and moved back in with my mother. 
The affidavit contained additional  information regarding pre-
decree circumstances, such as Son’s living arrangements  from 
birth, and also included  an allegation that Father had forced 
her to sign his version of the Decree by telling her she would 
never see Son again if he told the judge about her alleged 
infidelity.

although he had hoped for a new duty station in Hawaiʻ i, there 
had been no guarantee it would happen. Upon hearing testimony 
from both Mother and Father, the court preliminarily found a material change in circumstances, i.e., Father’s relocation to 
Arizona as well as Mother’s possible move away from Hawaiʻi with 
her new husband the following year. The family court ruled that 
the case would proceed to trial because of the material change 
in circumstances. 
At the March 3, 2014 trial,  both Father and Mother appeared 
with counsel. Before the family court received testimony, 
Father’s counsel argued that “certainly no evidence under the 
2 [] Nadeau  decision prior to the last custody order is relevant to 
today’s proceeding.  . . . The Court must confine the evidence, 
we believe at least, to everything that occurred since April the 
4th, 2013 . . . .”   The family court treated the oral motion as 
a motion in limine, and granted it, stating,  “Basically on this 
point there was a prior custody decree and we found that there 
was a material change in circumstance since then. So the 
evidence will be limited to what happened since April 4th, 
2013.” Although Mother’s counsel  did not refer specifically at 
that time to domestic violence allegations, he objected to the   
2 Nadeau v. Nadeau,  10 Haw. App. 111, 861 P.2d 754 (1993).

exclusion of pre-decree evidence based on Father’s mentioning of 
pre-decree allegations in his pre-trial memorandum.     
Accordingly, based on the family court’s pre -trial 
evidentiary ruling, evidence regarding factual circumstances 
existing before April 4, 2013, including evidence regarding 
Mother’s claims that Father physically abused her in Japan, was  
precluded from the trial. At trial, the family court received 
evidence that included  various exhibits and testimony from 
Mother, Mother’s mother, and  Father  regarding the parents’  
respective abilities to care for Son.  During closing arguments, 
Mother’s counsel urged:  
[Mr. Fanelli: ]  And you know, we weren’t allowed -- 
we were precluded from testifying or discussing matters 
that happened prior to April 4th. There is a history between these two that would perhaps lend a little more –- 
Mr. Diehl:   Objection. 
Mr. Fanelli:  Withdrawn. 
Mr. Diehl:   And you know, he’s done his 
closing. 
The Court:   And Mr. Fanelli, basically 
everything you’ve said so far -- I mean, this is not a 
motion to set aside the decree.  
Mr. Fanelli:  
I understand. 
The Court:  We’re here to determine what’s in 
the best interest of the child post -decree.  
Mr. Fanelli:  Yes, Your Honor. 
At the conclusion of the trial, the family court granted 
sole physical custody of Son to Father. The family court filed 
an order on April 14, 2014 awarding Father sole physical custody 
of Son effective May 30, 2014.   The order also addressed time 
sharing during Son’s school breaks and vacations, awarded Mother 
temporary physical custody if Father was deployed,  and stated

that if Mother and Father resided in the same locale in the 
future, the parties would be awarded joint physical custody.   
On April 24, 2014, Mother, through new counsel, filed a 
motion for reconsideration pursuant to Hawai ʻi Family Court Rules 
(“HFCR”) Rule 59, requesting a new trial because the family 
court’s preclusion of pre-decree evidence had prevented evidence 
of Father’s family violence and abuse of Mother during the 
marriage from coming to light, “which should have been 
considered by the Court in making a decision regarding physical 
custody.” Without a hearing, the family court denied the motion 
for reconsideration on May 20, 2014. 
The family court entered Findings of Fact and Conclusions 
of Law on August 6, 2014. Among other things, the family court  
found and concluded that: (1) the Decree filed on April 4, 2013 awarded Father sole physical custody of Son in September 2013, 
(2) relocation was contemplated at the time of the divorce, (3) 
Mother failed to establish a material change in circumstance since Father’s relocation back to the United States and 
subsequent new assignment was contemplated at the time the Decree was entered, (4) Mother did not have a history of stable  
employment, often went out to bars and left  Son with his  
3  grandmother, had been hospitalized for intoxication  and 
Mother’s counsel objected to Father’s counsel’s reference to the incident 
in his closing argument, arguing that it occurred before the April 4, 2013

5   The second point of error was, “[t]he Family Court committed plain error in 
awarding child custody without making any findings regarding the best  
interest of the child.” Mother’s reply brief acknowledged, however, that the 
family court did address the best interests of the child in conclusions of 
law (“COL”) 1 and 4. Mother nevertheless conti nued to assert error because 
the statements were identified as COLs and not findings of fact (“FOF”). The 
ICA found Mother’s argument to be without merit because COL 6 stated, “To the 
extent that any [FOF] herein may be a [COL], it shall be so construed.  To 
the extent that a [COL] herein may be a [FOF], it shall be so construed.”

was

Mother filed a notice of appeal to the ICA as to both 
the 
April 14, 2014 order on her Motion and the May 20, 2014 order 
denying her motion for reconsideration. She asserted two points 
of error, the first of which serves as the basis of her present

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
In its October 26, 2015  Summary Disposition Order  (“SDO”) , 
the ICA majority ruled based on cases subsequently overruled by 
Waldecker that  “[u]pon a finding of a material change, the 
relevant inquiry is whether the material change itself is sufficient to alter the best interests of the child, ”  and 
therefore Mother “was required to show that the evidence of domestic violence prior to the divorce decree was related to 
[Father’s] pending relocation to Arizona.”   Tumaneng, SDO  at 2.   
The ICA found no error because Mother  did not show such a 
relationship. See  id.    The ICA stated that the family court’s 
evidentiary ruling was not based on the principles of res 
judicata, but rather was “based on the relevance of the evidence 
under [HRE] Rule 402.”   Id.  
Judge Ginoza dissented on the basis that the family court 
abused its discretion when it denied Mother’s re quest for a new 
trial within her motion for reconsideration
, as there existed 
good cause for granting Mother’s request. See Tumaneng, SDO 
Dissent at 4 (Ginoza, J., dissenting).  She explained: 
Given the circumstances in this case, where the family 
court did not previously have occasion to consider family 
violence and Mother was unrepresented when the Divorce Decree was entered, I believe evidence of family violence 
should have been considered in determining the best

Tumaneng, SDO at 3. Further, what was in the best interest of Son was a 
“mixed question of law and fact,” and “[t]he family court’s characterization 
of its determination as a ‘COL’ rather than a ‘FOF’ does not mean the family court awarded custody of Son without considering the best interest of the 
child. Id. The Application does not challenge this portion of the ICA’s 
SDO.

All three questions assert that the family court erred in 
excluding evidence of domestic violence that had allegedly 
occurred before April 4, 2013.  We address this issue in Section 
IV below.

Decree.

D. Application for Writ of Certiorari 
Mother presents three questions to this court: 
[1]. Did the Intermediate Court of Appeals commit grave 
error of fact or law in holding that evidence of domestic 
violence which occurred before an earlier award of custody must be related to a material change of circumstances to be 
considered on a motion for chang
e or modification of 
custody pursuant to HRS § 571 -46(a)(6)? 
 
Did the Intermediate Court of Appeals commit grave 
error of fact or law in holding that evidence of domestic violence which occurred before an earlier award of custody 
must be related to a material change of circumstances to be 
considered on a motion for change or modification of custody pursuant to HRS § 571 -46(a)(6), where the issue of 
custody was not previously fully litigated and adjudicated 
by the court?

order awarding custody was based upon an uncontested 
stipulation allegedly obtained by fraud and/or duress or 
from a moving party who was previously unrepresented by

280, 286, 67 P.3d 779, 785 (2003). HRE Rule 401 defines 
relevant evidence as “evidence having any tendency to make the 
existence of any fact that is of consequence to the 
determination of the action more probable or less probable than 
it would be without the evidence. ” HRE Rule 402 provides that 
“[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitutions of the United States and the State 
of Hawaiʻ i, by statute, by these rules, or by other rules adopted 
by the supreme court. Evidence which is not relevant is not 
admissible.” 
IV. Discussion 
A. 	Child Custody Determinations Must Be Based on the Best 
Interests of the Child, and a Material Change in 
Circumstances is not Required to Modify a Child Custody 
Order 
We note at the outset 
that the family court applied ICA 
cases binding on it at the time, which required a threshold 
showing of a “material change in circumstances” before a change 
in a child custody order could be considered. In Waldecker , 137 
Hawaiʻi 460, 375 P.3d 239, we overruled the cases cited by the 
ICA in its Summary Disposition Order to the extent they 
suggested that a material change in circumstances is required before a court can consider the best interests of a child in 
modifying a custody order. at 470, 375 P.3d at 249.   
14

  
 
 
   
  
 
 
 

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
We addressed HRS § 571-46, which provides as follows with 
respect to the family court’s modification of a custody order:    
Criteria and procedure in awarding custody and visitation; 
best interest of the child.  (a) In actions for divorce, . 
. . or any other proceeding  where there is at issue a  
dispute as to the custody  of a minor child, the court, 
during the pendency of the action . . . or any time during 
the minority of the child, may make an order for the 
custody of the minor child as may seem necessary or proper. 
In awarding the custody, the court shall be guided by  the 
following standards, considerations, and procedures:  
 (1) Custody should be awarded to either parent or to 
both parents according to 
the best interests of the child . 
. . . ; 
(6) Any custody award shall be subject to 
modification or change whenever the best interests of the  
child require or justify the modification or change and, 
wherever practicable, the same person who made the original 
order shall hear the motion or petition for 
modification of 
the prior award. . . . 
In Waldecker , construing HRS § 571-46, we stated, “Rather 
than [a] two-step analysis, there is a single inquiry which 
focuses on the best interests of the child.  . . .    [T]he 
question is ‘whether or not there has been such a change of circumstances that the modification  will be for the [best 
interest] of the child.’”  Id. (citation omitted)   (brackets in 
original). We held that the requirement of a material change in  
circumstances is inconsistent with the statute.  See id.   We 
also noted that “jurisprudential concerns regarding repetitive motions cannot be addressed in a manner that conflicts with the 
requirements of HRS 571–46  that ‘custody should be awarded  . . .  
according to the best interests of the child’ and ‘ any custody 
award shall be subject to modification or change whenever   the 
best interests of the child require or justify the modification

or change.’” Id. (citing HRS § 571–46(a)(1), (6)) (emphasis in 
original). 
Pursuant to HRS § 571
-46, as construed in Waldecker , the 
family court was required to consider all evidence relevant to 
the issue of whether modification of the Decree would be in the 
best interests of the child. In this case, pre-decree evidence 
was clearly relevant to this determination. Therefore, the 
family court erred by excluding pre-decree evidence to ascertain 
Son’s best interests. 6 Although Mother’s applicati on is based 
solely on the exclusion of pre-decree domestic violence evidence, on remand, pursuant to HRS § 571-46 and 
Waldecker , 
other pre-decree evidence may be relevant to Son’s best interests. 
B.
	 In Determining the Best Interests of the Child, the Family 
Court Must Consider Evidence of Domestic Violence and Apply 
the Rebuttable Presumption of HRS § 571-46(9) 
This case also presents the specific question of whether 
the family court erred by excluding all pre-decree evidence of 
domestic violence. In this regard, HRS § 571-46(9) and (10) 
provided at the times relevant to this case as it does now: 
(9) In every proceeding where there is at issue a 
dispute as to the custody of a child, a determination by 
the court that family violence has been committed by a 
parent raises a rebuttable presumption that it is 
detrimental to the child and not in the best interest of 
  The family court compounded the error by considering pre -decree evidence 
adverse to Mother while excluding evidence of Father’s domestic violence, as 
well as other relevant circumstances of Son’s upbringing.

We also note that HRS § 571-2 (Supp. 2014)   defines “family 
violence” as:  
      
      
      
 
 HRS § 571-46(9) requires that the family court address 
whether “family violence has been committed by a parent” in

the child to be placed in sole custody, joint legal 
custody, or joint physical custody with the perpetrator of 
family violence.  In addition to other factors that a court 
shall consider in a proceeding in which the custody of a 
child or visitation by a parent is at issue, and in which 
the court has made a finding of family violence by a parent:
 (A) The court shall consider as the primary 
factor the safety and well -being of the child and of the 
parent who is the victim of family violence;
 (B) The court shall consider the perpetrator’ s 
history of causing physical harm, bodily injury, or assault 
or causing reasonable fear of physical harm, bodily injury, 
or assault to another person; and
 (C) If a parent is absent or relocates because of 
an act of family violence by the other parent, the absence 
or relocation shall not be a factor that weighs against the 
parent in determining custody or visitation; 
(10) A court may award visitation to a parent who 
has committed family violence only if the court finds that 
adequate provision can be made for the physical safety and psychological well -being of the child and for the safety of 
the parent who is a victim of family violence . . . . 
the occurrence of one or more of the following acts by a family or household 
member, but does not include acts of 
self-defense: 
(1) Attempting to cause or causing physical harm to 
another family or household member; (2) Placing a family or household member in fear of 
physical harm; or (3) Causing a family or household member to engage 
involuntarily in sexual activity by force, threat of force, 
or duress. 
We note that this definition of “family violence” is not limited 
to physical acts of domestic violence, which are alleged by 
Mother in this case, but also includes non-physical acts, such 
as threats.

the custody of a child.” The statute imposes a “ rebuttable 
presumption that it is detrimental to the child and not in the 
best interest of the child to be placed in . . . custody . . .   
with the perpetrator of family violence. ”   Id.   Indeed, the 
legislature mandates the court to “consider the perpetrator’s 
history of causing physical harm, bodily injury, or assault or 
causing reasonable fear of physical harm, bodily injury, or 
assault to another person. ”   HRS § 571-46(a)(9)(A).   
As we noted in  Doe v. Doe , 98 Hawaiʻ i 144, 44 P.3d  1085 
(2002):  
A determination of family violence bears directly 
upon the best interests of the child, as indicated in HRS § 
571–46(9), which provides that, when a determination of 
family violence is made by the family court, a rebuttable 
presumption is created that custody should not be placed with the perpetrator[.]  
. . . .  
Father was allowed to testify and present all of his 
witnesses to the court. Mother testified, but the court did not hear from any of her other witnesses, in particular, those who would have testified, according to  their 
affidavits, about Father’ s alleged abuse of Mother and its 
related effect on Child. Evidence supporting such 
allegations was pertinent to whether Father should have 
sole legal and physical custody of Child.  
  
Id. at 156, 44 P.3d at 1097 (citations omitted). 
Doe   highlights the importance of considering all testimony 
relevant to allegations  of domestic violence  in custody 
determinations. In this case, the family court did not allow 
any evidence of domestic violence in its custody determination.  
The custody arrangement set out in the Decree was in an 
uncontested divorce filing, with no hearing before the family

court. Although the family court had approved  the Son’s custody 
arrangement in the Decree, in her post  -decree Motion, Mother  
alleged coercion and duress regarding the original “agreement.” 
In addition, a clear dispute between Mother and Father over 
Son’s custody arose when Mother filed her Motion. The March 3, 
2014 trial was the first proceeding at which the family court, under HRS § 571-46(9), had occasion to receive evidence and 
consider the issue of whether family violence was  committed by 
Father, and what custody arrangement was actually in Son’s best 
interests. 
As noted in Doe , the statute sets out clear guidelines 
regarding custody decisions when a determination of family 
violence is made. The legislature’s intent to require family 
courts to address issues of family violence in determining child custody and visitation decisions is clear on the face of the 
statute. In enacting HRS § § 571-46(9) and (10) in 1996, the 
legislature also stated: 
Because current laws relative to child custody and 
visitation are based on an assumption that . . . divorcing parents are in relatively equal positions of power and that 
such parents will act in the children’s best interest, 
these laws often work against the protection of the 
children and the abused spouse in families with a history 
of family violence. . . .  
1996 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 198, § 1 at 450.  Therefore, in order 
to determine Son’s actual best interests as mandated by HRS § 
571-46, the family court was required to address the specific

and direct allegations of domestic violence in this case before 
making its custody determination.  
V. Conclusion 
For these reasons, we vacate the family court’s April 14, 
2014 order on Mother’s Motion, its May 20, 201 4 order denying 
Mother’s motion for reconsideration, and it s August 6, 2014 
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. 
We also vacate the 
ICA’s October 26, 2015 Summary Disposition Order and November

court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
