OPINION OF THE COURT  BY McKENNA, J.  
 
I. Introduction 
Jesus and Mila Torres 
dba Hawaiian Quilt Wholesale (“the 
Torreses”) appeal an arbitration award between them and RT 
Import, Inc. (“RT Import”) , raising four questions, of which    
 
   
   
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
                         
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
only the first, relating to the circuit court’s award of fees 
and costs, has merit.  We hold that the circuit court erred by 
including in its judgment $4,738.74 that was  not included in the 
final arbitration award or otherwise allowed by law.  
II. Background 
A. Court Proceedings Prior to Arbitration 
On May 24, 2012, RT Import filed a complaint in the 
District Court of the First Circuit against both the Torreses 
and Worldwide Flight Services (“WFS”) seeking $25,000 in damages 
for merchandise allegedly misdelivered by WFS to the Torreses, which was then converted by the Torreses.  The Torreses answered 
the complaint and filed a cross-claim against WFS, seeking 
indemnification and/or contribution in the event they were found 
liable to RT Import. The Torreses also filed a demand for jury 
trial, and the case was then transferred to the circuit court.
1 
After discovery, RT Import filed a petition to approve a 
confidential good faith settlement with WFS pursuant to Hawai i 
Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 663-15.5 (Supp. 2012). After the 
Torreses withdrew their objection, the settlement between RT Import and WFS was approved by the circuit court. 
A few weeks before the scheduled trial date, after 
additional pre-trial proceedings and discovery, RT Import and 
1 The Honorable Edwin C. Nacino presided.

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the Torreses agreed to resolve their dispute through binding 
arbitration under the auspices of Dispute Prevention and 
Resolution, Inc. (“DPR”) , and they filed a stipulation for 
binding arbitration. 
B. Arbitration Proceedings 
The following facts were adduced in arbitration.  Although 
the Torreses were to receive forty boxes of merchandise, WFS 
mistakenly delivered eighty-eight boxes.  The mistaken delivery 
contained eighteen boxes belonging to RT Import, thirty-six 
belonging to the Torreses, and thirty-four boxes belonging to 
another company. The Torreses returned the thirty-four boxes 
belonging to the other company, but they never acknowledged 
receiving merchandise belonging to RT Import. 
The arbitrator ruled that although WFS’s misdelivery led to 
the Torreses’ initial receipt and possession of RT Import’s 
merchandise, the Torreses’ subsequent actions, including 
removing RT Import’s box labels and selling the merchandise at 
the Aloha Stadium Swap Meet, proved that they committed the intentional tort of conversion. The Final Award of Arbitrator 
(“final award”) awarded RT Import a total of $106,711.62, with 
subtotals of $71,663.33 for special damages and $35,000.00 for 
3
    
 
   
 
 
  
  
  
 
  
   
 
  
 The Respondents are responsible for 100% of the 
arbitration fees and costs. The Claimant is therefore awarded, and the Respondents shall reimburse to the 
Claimant directly, all arbitration related fees and costs paid by the Claimant to DPR, and shall pay said fees and 
costs as 
directed by Dispute Prevention &  Resolution, Inc.    
                         
 2   RT Import is a corporation. We are unaware of any legal authority that 
permits an award of emotional distress damages to a corporation. Numerous reported cases preclude emotional distress damages in favor of corporations. 
See, e.g., F.D.I.C. v. Hulsey, 22 F.3d 1472, 1489 (10th Cir. 1994)(applying 
Oklahoma law); Interphase  Garment Sol. , LLC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 
566 F. Supp.2d 460, 466 (D.   Md. 2008)(applying Maryland law); Earth 
Scientists (Petro Serv.) Ltd. v. U.S. Fidelity & Guar. Co. , 619 F.  Supp. 
1465, 1474 (D. Kansas 1985)(applying Kansas law);  Wilson v. Colonial Penn 
Life Ins. Co., 454 F. Supp. 1208, 1212, n.9 (D.  Minn. 1978)(applying 
Minnesota law). The emotional distress award was not challenged or appealed, 
but, in any event, parties who submit their claims to binding arbitration assume all the hazards of the arbitration process, including the risk that 
the arbitrators may make mistakes in the application of law and in their 
findings of fact. Nordic PCL Const r., Inc. v. LPIHGC, LLC, 136 Hawai i  29, 
41, 358 P.3d 1, 14 (2015).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
general damages for emotional distress.2 The arbitrator 
specifically found: 
29.  As the prevailing party, RT is entitled to the fair 
market value of the chattel, in addition to any special 
damages, including compensation for the time and money properly expended in pursuit of the property, plus 
emotional distress. 
30. The undisputed evidence adduced establishes that 
 the fair market retail value of the merchandise [sic] 
 $62,047.00.  
31. The undisputed evidence adduced from RT establishes 
 the following costs related to this converted 
 merchandise: freight charges of $2,777.53, customs entry 
 services of $1,128.80, airport fees of $35.00, business 
 related airline travel of $2,175.00, incidental travel 
 expenses of $3,500.00.3  All other claims of expenses are 
 denied.  
32. RT is also entitled to an award of damages for 
emotional distress . 
33. RT is entitled to be aw
arded its arbitration cost s and 
expenses. 34. In light of the fact that the claims asserted by 
RT are tort claims, RT is not entitled to an award of attorney’s fees and costs. 
The arbitrator also ordered: 
4
 3   The amounts in paragraphs 30 and 31 total $71,663.33 in special 
damages.     
 
  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(Emphasis added.) Pursuant to this portion of the  final award,  
DPR sent RT Import a final invoice  (“DPR invoice”) , direct ing 
the Torreses to immediately remit $3,616.75 to RT Import (via 
their attorney) as reimbursement for arbitration fees.    This 
amount was to reimburse RT Import for its advance toward the  
arbitrator’s fees.  
Several weeks after DPR issued its invoice, however, RT 
Import sent a letter  directly to the Torreses  stating,  “As 
agreed by the parties and ordered by the Arbitrator, below 
please find for your review and payment, the fees and costs of  
this Arbitration matter. All supporting invoices in regard to costs are enclosed . . . $8,355.49.”   (“RT Import invoice” )   The  
RT Import invoice listed the following costs:  
DPR Order/letter: $3,616.75  
Postage, Photocopying Costs: $2,278.29  
Deposition transcript of J. Torres, M. Torres, C. Murata: 
$2,244.75  
Services of process regarding depositions: $215.70  
 
These amounts total $8,355.49.  When the $3,616.75 in 
arbitration fees reflected in the DPR invoice is subtracted, the 
difference is $4,738.74.  
C. Further Circuit Court Proceedings 
Although they had stipulated to submit this case to binding 
arbitration, the Torreses  filed a Notice of Appeal and Request 
for Trial De Novo of the final award, citing Rule 22 of the 
Hawai‘i Arbitration Rules.   On the same day, the Torreses also 
5

    
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
filed a motion with DPR to set aside the final award.  The 
Torreses alleged that RT Import had been made whole through the 
confidential settlement, rendering the case moot, and that the 
arbitrator lacked subject matter and personal jurisdiction. 
RT Import opposed this motion before DPR, arguing that the 
jurisdictional arguments were meritless, that the parties had 
stipulated to binding arbitration, and that RT Import had not 
been made whole by its settlement with WFS. DPR responded that 
it had no authority under HRS § 658A or DPR ’s Arbitration Rules 
to rule on the motion. 
RT Import then filed a motion in  the circuit court to 
confirm the final award  pursuant to HRS §  658A-22.   RT Import 
requested that judgment be entered in its favor in the amount of 
$106,663.33, plus $8,355.49 in  costs paid for postage, 
photocopying, deposition transcripts, and service of process 
costs related to the arbitration  as well as $1,692.80 for 
attorney’s fees incurred in bringing the motion .   RT Import 
included both the DPR  invoice and RT Import invoice in its 
motion to confirm.  
The Torreses incorporated the arguments contained in their 
motion with DPR in their opposition memorandum to RT Import’s 
circuit court motion to confirm. The Torresses did not file a motion to vacate or modify the award with the circuit court.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The circuit court granted RT Import’s motion to confirm the 
final award and entered a judgment awarding  RT Import a total of 
$116,759.91, comprised of $106,711.62 for damages, $8,355.49 for “Plaintiff’s Arbitration attorney’s fees and costs,” and 
$1,692.80 for “Plaintiff’s Costs of Motion for an Order to 
Confirm Final Award of Arbitrator Dated April 2, 2014.”    
D. Appeal to the I
ntermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) 
On appeal to the ICA, the Torreses asserted that the 
circuit court abused its discretion by: (1) concluding that they were not entitled to a trial de novo on the grounds that this 
case was not in the Court-Annexed Arbitration Program; (2) 
awarding attorney’s fees and costs to RT Import despite the 
arbitrator’s ruling that attorney’s fees were not available for 
this tort matter; and (3) granting the motion to confirm the 
final award without confirming whether the arbitrator had 
subject matter and personal jurisdiction. The Torreses also 
alleged that DPR’s arbitration administrator abused its 
discretion by refusing to hear and decide their motion to set 
aside the final award pursuant to the Hawai i Arbitration Rules.
4 
In a summary disposition order, the ICA determined that the 
Torreses’ appeal was without merit. RT Imp., Inc. v. Torres, 
No. CAAP-14-0000970, 2016 WL 6125676, at *1 (Haw. Ct. App. Oct. 
4 DPR’s arbitration administrator , which is a court -annexed, non- binding 
arbitration alternative dispute resolution process, has no connection to the 
Hawaii Arbitration Rules. 
7
    
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
20, 2016).   The ICA  resolved the Torreses ’ points on appeal as 
follows: 
(1) when the circuit court heard RT Import ’s Motion to 
Confirm Award, Appellants did not raise HRS chapter 658A as 
a basis for challenging the arbitration award; (2) the DPR case manager had no authority to consider or 
rule on the Appellants' Motion to Set Aside under HRS chapter 658A; and 
(3) this case was never part of the Court –Annexed 
Arbitration Program or subject to the rules of the program, 
but instead was conducted pursuant to HRS chapter 658A . 
The ICA therefore affirmed the circuit court’s confirmation of 
the final arbitration award and judgment.  
E. Application for Writ of Certiorari 
The Torreses raise  the following four questions on 
certiorari:  
1. Whether the ICA  gravely erred in concluding that the 
circuit court properly  awarded attorney’s fees in an 
arbitration case where the awarding of attorney’s fees was  
precluded by the arbitrator pursuant to the American rule 
and where no language in the  arbitration agreement 
permitted the awarding of attorney’s fees?  
2.
 Whether the ICA gravely erred in concluding an 
arbitration case may proceed to trial and a verdict may be obtained, even where the facts show that prior to the 
commencement of the arbitration trial, the injured party 
was made whole prior to the commencement of that trial? 
3. Whether the ICA gravely erred in affirming the award of 
an arbitration award of $106,711.62, where Plaintiff only 
sought $15,800 in damages? 
4. Whether the ICA gravely erred in concluding that measure 
of damages in case [sic] tort case involving the tort of conversion is the value of the chattel at the time of the 
judgment? 
III. Standards of Review 
A. Review of an arbitration award 
Where a party challenges an arbitration award, the 
following precepts are applicable.  First, because of the 
legislative policy to encourage arbitration and thereby 
8
    
 
   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
    
  
    
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
discourage litigation, arbitrators have broad discretion in 
resolving the dispute. Upon submission of an issue, the 
arbitrator has authority to determine the entire question, 
including the legal construction of terms of a contract or 
lease, as well as the disputed facts. In fact, where the 
parties agree to arbitrate, they thereby assume all the hazards of the arbitration process, including the risk that 
the arbitrators may make mistakes in the application of law 
and in their findings of fact. 
Second, correlatively, judicial review of an arbitration 
award is confined to the strictest possible limits. An 
arbitration award may be vacated only on the four grounds 
specified in HRS § 658 –9 and modified and corrected only on 
the three grounds specified in HRS § 658 –10. Moreover, the 
courts have no business weighing the merits of the award. 
Third, HRS §§ 658 –9 and –10 also restrict the authority of 
appellate courts to review judgments entered by circuit 
courts confirming or vacating the arbitration awards. 
. . . . 
The promulgation of HRS chapter 658A has not materially 
changed this standard of review. Judicial review of 
arbitration awards remains limited to the statutory grounds for confirmation, vacatur, modification, and correction.

B. Statutory interpretation 
Statutory interpretation is a question of law reviewable de 
novo. Our construction of statutes is guided by the 
following rules: 
First, the fundamental starting point for statutory -
interpretation is the language of the statute itself. 
Second, where the statutory language is plain and 
unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain 
and obvious meaning. Third, implicit in the task of statutory construction is our foremost obligation to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself. Fourth, when 
there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an 
ambiguity exists.

IV.
 Discussion 
A.	 The circuit court erred by including in its judgment 
$4,738.74 not included in the arbitration award and not 
allowable under HRS §  658A-25.   
In their first question on certiorari, the Torreses 
challenge the circuit court’s award of “attorney’s fees” as part 
of the judgment, alleging that such fees were not authorized by 
the arbitrator. 
HRS § 658A-25 (Supp. 2012) “Judgment on award; 
attorney's fees and litigation expenses ” provides: 
(a) Upon granting an order confirming, vacating without 
directing a rehearing, modifying, or correcting an award, the 
court shall enter a judgment in conformity therewith. The 
judgment may be recorded, docketed, and enforced as any other 
judgment in a civil action. 
(b) A court may allow reasonable costs of the motion and 
subsequent judicial proceedings. (c) On application of a prevailing party to a contested judicial 
proceeding under section 658A -22, 658A -23, or 658A- 24, the court 
may add reasonable a ttorney’s fees and other reasonable expenses 
of litigation incurred in a judicial proceeding after the award 
is made to a judgment confirming, vacating without directing a 
rehearing, modifying, or correcting an award. 
HRS § 658A-25.  There were two amounts in the judgment 
characterized as “attorney’s fees,” both of which have been 
challenged by the Torreses in the circuit court and on appeal.  
These amounts are the $1,692.80 award characterized by the 
circuit court as “Plaintiff’s Costs of Motion”  and the $8,355.49 
10

    
 
    
 
     
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
award characterized by the circuit court as “Plaintiff’s 
Arbitration attorney’s fees and costs.” 
1.	 The $1,692.80 award was properly included in the 
circuit court judgment pursuant to HRS § 658-23(c). 
The circuit court characterized the $1,692.80 in attorney’s 
fees incurred by RT Import  in the judicial proceedings to 
confirm the final award as “Plaintiff’s Costs of Motion,” which 
appear to correspond to amounts allowed under HRS § 658A-25(b)  
(Supp. 2012).  The amounts were for attorney’s fees in bringing the motion to confirm  the final award  under HRS § 658A-22   (Supp.  
2012).   Pursuant to the language of the statute, the amounts are 
therefore governed by HRS §  658A-25(c).   
Although the $1,692.80 was mischaracterized, HRS § 658A  -
25(c) allows a court to award attorney’s fees incurred in 
judicial proceedings to confirm an arbitration award when a 
motion to confirm award under  HRS § 658A  -22 is contested.  See In  
re Arbitration Between United Pub. Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, 
AFL-CIO and City and Cty. of Honolulu  , 119 Hawai i 201, 209, 194   
P.3d 1163, 1171 (App. 2008)  (noting that attorney’s fees on a 
motion to confirm award are only allowable to a prevailing party 
to a contested judicial proceeding under HRS §§ 658A-22, 658A-
23, or 658A-24).   
In this case, the Torreses contested 
RT Import’s HRS § 
658A-22 judicial proceedings to confirm the award.  
11
    
 
  
 
   
 
 
  
 
(Emphasis added.) The DPR invoice, issued   pursuant to the final 
award, directed the Torreses to pay $3,616.75  for the 
arbitrator’s fees.   Although the separate RT  Import invoice 
asserted that the parties had agreed to the additional amounts, 
the Torreses object to these amounts characterized as *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Therefore, the circuit court’s judgment properly included the 
amount of $1,692.80, as it was awarded pursuant to HRS §   658A-
25(c) for attorney’s fees incurred in the judicial proceeding  
regarding the contested  award.  
2.
	 The circuit court was without authority to include in 
its judgment $4,738.74 of the $8,355.49  award  
characterized as arbitration attorneys’ fees and costs 
because that amount was not included in the arbitration award.  
With respect to the $8,355.49 award characterized by the 
circuit court as arbitration attorneys’ fees and costs,  this 
amount included the: (1) $3,616.  75 for arbitrator’s fees in the 
DPR invoice, and (2)  additional amounts totalling $4,738.74 in 
the RT Import invoice, which consisted of $2,278.29 in postage  
and photocopying costs, $2,244.75 for deposition transcripts, 
and $215.70 for service of  process costs for depositions.  
The arbitrator’s final award, however, stated as follows: 
The Respondents are responsible for 100% of the arbitration 
fees and costs. The Claimant is therefore awarded, and the 
Respondents shall reimburse to the Claimant directly, all 
arbitration related fees and costs paid by the Claimant to 
DPR, and shall pay said fees and costs as directed by 
Dispute Prevention & Resolution, Inc. 
12

    
 
  
   
  
 
  
 
 
 
                         
   
  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
arbitration attorney’s fees  throughout these judicial 
proceedings.  
Whether the circuit court could include the extra $4,738.74  
not “directed by DPR” to be paid by the Torreses to RT Import is 
an issue of statutory interpretation. The plain language of HRS  
5 § 658A-22   authorizes the circuit court to confirm “the award.”   
The “award” includes  the $3,616.75 as “directed by DPR,” but not 
the additional $4,738.74 separately invoiced directly by   RT 
Import to the Torreses.   Therefore, the circuit court erred by 
including in its judgment the $4,738  .74, which was not part of 
the arbitration award.    
B.
	 Based on the deference given to arbitration awards, the 
court did not err in confirming the remainder of the final 
arbitration award in its entirety. 
In the second, third, and fourth questions raised on 
certiorari, the Torreses allege that the arbitrator erred by 
awarding damages because RT Imports had been made whole by its 
settlement with WFS, by awarding damages that exceeded the $15,800 purportedly originally sought by RT Imports, and by 
applying an incorrect measure of damages.  In Section III(A) 
5	 HRS § 658A- 22 provides: 
Confirmation of award . After a party to an arbitration 
proceeding receives notice of an award, the party may make 
a motion to the court for an order confirming the award at 
which time the court shall issue a confirming order unless the award is modified or corrected pursuant to section 
658A-20 or 658A -24 or is vacated pursuant to section 658A -
23. 
13
    
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
 In addition, HRS §  658A-21(c)(Supp.  2012) specifically  
provides in relevant part:   
 
 
 In this case, the circuit court erred by including in the 
judgment confirming the arbitration award $4,738.74 directly  
billed by RT Import to the Torreses, which was not a part of the 
final award.   Accordingly, we otherwise affirm but vacate the  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
above, we outlined the standards governing judicial review of an 
arbitration award, including:  
because of the legislative policy to encourage arbitration 
and thereby discourage litigation, arbitrators have broad 
discretion in resolving the dispute. Upon submission of an issue, the arbitrator has authority to determine the entire 
question, including the legal construction of terms of a 
contract or lease, as well as the disputed facts. In fact, 
where the parties agree to arbitrate, they thereby assume 
all the hazards of the arbitration process, including the risk that the arbitrators may make mistakes in the 
application of law and in their findings of fact. 
Second, correlatively, judicial review of an arbitration 
award is confined to the strictest possible limits. . . . 
Moreover, the courts have no business weighing the merits 
of the award. 
Nordic PCL Constr., Inc., 136 Hawai i at 41, 358 P.3d at 13. 
[A]n arbitrator may order such remedies as the arbitrator 
considers just and appropriate under the circumstances of 
the arbitration proceeding.   The fact that such a remedy 
could not or would not be granted by the court is not a ground for refusing to confirm an award under section 658A -
22 . . . . 
  
Accordingly, pursuant to the standards governing judicial 
review of arbitration awards, the second, third, and fourth 
questions on certiorari are outside the scope of permitted 
judicial review.
