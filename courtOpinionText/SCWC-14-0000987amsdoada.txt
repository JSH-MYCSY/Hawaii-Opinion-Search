(“Fleming ”) appeals from the Intermediate Court of Appeals =  
(“ICA”) September 6, 2017  Judgment on Appeal,  remanding the case 
to the Circuit  Court of the Second  Circuit ( “circuit  court”)  to

 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
On November 3, 2006, Fleming was charged by indictment 
with one count  of Sexual Assault in the First Degree.   Prior to 
trial,  on October 23, 2007  and again on August 14, 2008, 
Fleming’s counsel filed  separate  Motions  for Examination 
pursuant to Hawai ‘i Revised Statutes ( “HRS ”) § 704-404  (1993 & 
Supp. 2012)  to determine if Fleming was fit to proceed to trial.   
The circuit court granted both motions.   On two  separate 
occasions, Fleming was examined by  the same  three court-
appointed mental health examiners  to determine whether Fleming 
had the capacity to understand the proceedings against him and 32
2 HRS § 707 -730(1)(a) (2019) provides that “[a] person commits the 
offense of sexual assault in the first degree if . . . [t]he person knowingly 
subjects another person to an act of sexual penetration by strong 
compulsion[.]” 
3 HRS § 704 -404 provides as follows: 
§ 704 -404. Examination of defendant with respect to 
physical or mental disease, disorder, or defect 
Excluding fitness to proceed. 
(1) Whenever the defendant has filed a notice of 
intention to rely on the defense of physical or 
mental disease, disorder, or defect excluding 
responsibility, or there is reason to doubt the 
defendant’s fitness to proceed, or reason to believe 
that the physical or mental disease, disorder, or 
defect of the defendant will or has become an issue 
in the case, the court may immediately suspend all 
further proceedings in the prosecution. If a trial 
jury has been empaneled, it shall be discharged or 
retained at the discretion of the court. The 
discharge of the trial jury shall not be a bar to 
further prosecution.

  Judge, before we get the jury in, I have a concern 
about whether my client –  his right to testify in his, and 
I completely understand that. I am concerned, and based on 
my discussions with him today, that I don’t believe that 
his testimony, that he’s able to assist in his defense to 
some degree, without revealing the contents of any 
discussions.  
 
                     
   
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to assist in his own defense.   Based on the independent opinions 
of all three examiners, on February 27, 2008  and December 3, 
2008, the circuit court found Fleming fit to proceed to  trial.    5 4
Trial began on January 11, 2010.  Fleming elected to 
testify in his defense. Prior to the presentation of the 
defense’s case, Fleming’s counsel informed the circuit court 
that,  based on his interactions with Fleming that day, it was 
his belief  that Fleming was not fit to proceed. Fleming’ s 
counsel argued to the court:  
4 HRS § 704 -404(2) provides: 
Upon suspension of further proceedings in the 
prosecution,  the court shall appoint three qualified 
examiners in . . . to examine and report upon the 
physical and mental condition of the defendant. . . . 
The examination may be conducted on an out -patient 
basis or, in the court’s discretion, when necessary 
the court may order the defendant to be committed to a hospital or other suitable facility for the purpose of the examination for a period not exceeding thirty 
days, or such longer period as the court determines 
to be necessary for the purpose. The court may 
direct that one or more qualified physicians or psychologists retained by the defendant be permitted to witness the examination. As used in this section, 
the term “licensed psychologist” includes 
psychologists exempted from licensure by section 465 -
3(a)(3).  
5   The terms “fit to proceed” and “competent” are used 
interchangeably by both the circuit court and the ICA.   
 
 
 4 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 The circuit court denied the motion, explaining that 
it reviewed the previous two HRS § 704-404 exam reports, and the 
circuit court had “not observed Mr. Fleming to have done or said 
anything in court that would indicate that he [was]  not 
competent or fit to proceed.”  
                     
    *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
I just believe that there is a fitness to proceed issue, 
especially with regards to  his ability to testify and 
communicate, and that I believe some of the comments that 
may come out, and we’re not talking about confessions, but 
would be so highly prejudicial to him, it almost –  what may 
happen to him is that he could testify and improper  
inferences could be made with regards to his testimony. 
And I’m not talking about that at all.  
That there’s been discussions, which I, at least as an 
officer of the Court, and as a defense attorney, have been 
doing this for a long time, feel very uncomfortable, even with this waiver, as well as with the fact that my client 
is going to take the stand, and based on what I know about 
what he’s going to talk about, some of what he’s going to talk about, I have some real concerns.  
And I think I need to orall y move this Court, at least for 
the record, I understand we’ve had two prior 704 -404 exams, 
but I feel it necessary to make an oral motion for a 704 -
404 exam limited strictly to fitness to pr oceed. 
Thereafter, Fleming testified in his own defense.   On 
January 25, 2010, the jury found Fleming guilty of Sexual 
Assault in the First Degree.  
After the  jury verdict, Fleming filed a Motion for New 
Trial.   Fleming argued, in part, that he  was incompetent during 
the trial.   He argued that, because a significant amount of time 
had passed since the trial, a hearing retrospectively evaluating 6

 5 
 
   
  
   
   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
whether he had been  competent at the time of trial would be 
impractical.   In support of  the argument that Fleming was 
incompetent at the time of trial, the defense provided a report 
from Marvin W. Acklin, Ph.D.  (“Dr. Acklin”) , in which Dr. Acklin  
opined  that Fleming was not fit to proceed during trial and that 
he was not currently competent to stand trial.   The circuit 
court denied Fleming’s  Motion for New Trial;  however, the court 
ordered a third  examination pursuant to HRS § 704-404, 
specifically to determine if Fleming was competent to proceed to 
sentencing.   The circuit c ourt’s order denying Fleming’s Motion 
for New Trial did not address whether Fleming was competent 
during his trial, but did find that Fleming’s counsel failed to exercise due diligence to obtain evidence to support the claim 
of “pre-trial unfitness.”   Specifically, the circuit court noted 
that the “most critical evidence” supporting a new trial  was the 
report by Dr. Acklin, which the court determined could have been 
discovered well in advance of trial.   
Based on the unanimous expert findings of Dr. Acklin 
and the three cour t-appointed examiners that Fleming was 
incompetent to be sentenced, b oth the State and Fleming 
stipulated that Fleming was not fit to proceed to sentencing . 
Accordingly, the circuit court found Fleming was not fit to 
proceed and suspended proceedings.  
 
 
 6 
 
  
 
 
 
    
   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Subsequently,  on February 12, 2014,  following a 
contested  competency hearing,  the circuit court issued its 
ruling that Fleming was fit to proceed to sentencing,  the 
testimony of a treating psychiatrist who had treated  Fleming and  
two of the three court-appointed examiners testifying that 
Fleming was not so fit.   
On May 29, 2014, the circuit court filed its “Findings 
of Facts, Conclusions of Law, and Order Finding Defendant Fit to 
Proceed” in support of its conclusion that Fleming was fit to 
proceed to sent encing. On July 18, 2014, Fleming was sentence d 
to twenty years of imprisonment. 
On July 21, 2014, Fleming filed a notice of appeal. 
Fleming argued in his opening brief , in part, that the circuit 
court erred in denying his Motion for New Trial and that he had 
been incompetent during his trial . 
The ICA  held, in part,  that the circuit court erred in 
failing to render a decision regarding Fleming’s competency  
during trial and  remanded the case to have the circuit court 
determine whether Fleming was competent at the time of his trial.   The ICA instructed the  circuit court that if it 
determined that Fleming was incompetent at trial or was unable 
to determine Fleming’s competency at the time of trial, the ICA 
would vacate Fleming’s conviction and grant him a new trial.

   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Fleming filed an application for writ of certiorari to 
review the ICA’s memorandum opinion on November 6, 2017 . 
Fleming raised the issue as to whether the ICA correctly held 
that Fleming was not deprived of due process when the circuit 
court refused to provide him a hearing during trial as to 
whether he was incompetent pursuant to HRS § 704-404. 
After accepting certiorari, t his court remanded to the 
circuit court to determine whether it was possible to determine 
that Fleming was fit during trial.7 Having found it impossible 
to determine whether Fleming was fit during trial, the circuit 
court duly transferred jurisdiction back to this court. 
The circuit court’s conclusion that it is not possible 
to determine whether Fleming was competent during trial 
necessitates that he receive a new trial. It is well settled 
that “the criminal trial of an incompetent defendant violates 
7 The Order for Temporary Remand provided: 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the case is temporarily 
remanded to the Circuit Court. Within 180 days from the 
date of this order, the Circuit Court shall, after hearing, 
decide whether a retrospective determination as to whether 
the defendant was competent during trial is possible[.] If 
a retros pective competency determination is possible, the 
Circuit Court shall decide whether the defendant was 
competent during trial. 
Within 10 days after the Circuit Court makes the 
aforementioned determinations, the clerk of the Circuit 
Court shall supplement the record on appeal with all 
documents entered on temporary remand.

due process.” Cooper v. Oklahoma,  517 U.S. 348, 354  (1996).   
This is because   
[f]or the defendant, the consequences of an erroneous 
determination of competence are dire. Because he lacks the ability to communicate effectively with counsel, he may be unable to exercise other “rights deemed essential to a fair trial.” Riggins v. 
Nevada, 504 U.S., at 139, 112 S.Ct., at 1817 
(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). After making 
the “profound” choice whether to plead guilty, the defendant who proceeds to trial  
“will ordinarily have to decide whether to 
waive his ‘privilege against compulsory self -
incrimination,’ Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 
238, 243, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1712, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969), by taking the witness stand; if the 
option is available, he may have to decide 
whether to waive his ‘right to trial by jury’; and, in consultation with counsel, he may have to decide whether to waive his ‘right to 
confront [his] accusers,’ by declining to 
cross -examine witnesses for the prosecution.”  
With the assistance of counsel, the defendant also is
called upon to make myriad smaller decisions 
concerning the course of his defense. The importance
of these rights and decisions demonstrates that an 
erroneous determination of competence threatens a 
“fundamental component of our criminal justice system” - the basic fairness of the trial itself.   
 
Id. at 364 (some citations omitted). 
As noted by the ICA, ample evidence subsequent to 
trial supported Fleming’s Motion for New Trial.   The report of 
defendant’s expert ,  Dr. Acklin,  was based upon Fleming’s 
behavior during trial. In addition, based on the fitness  
examinations after trial, the circuit court determined that 
Fleming was not  fit to proceed to sentencing. In this context, 
the circuit c ourt’s refusal to consider the new evidence that

discretion. 
For the reasons set forth herein, the ICA’s September

Judgment of Conviction and S entence, and the circuit court’s

Denying Defendant’s Motion for New Trial are vacated and the 
case is remanded to t he circuit court for further proceedings 
consistent with this summary disposition order .
