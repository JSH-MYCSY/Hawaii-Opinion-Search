Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant.
  
SCWC-14-0001047  
(CAAP-14-0001047; CR. NO. 13-1-1748) 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J.  
This case arises from an undercover operation 
conducted by the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) on November 
26, 2013. The operation resulted in the arrest of defendant 
Charles L. Bovee and codefendant Adam J. Apilado, both of whom 
were later charged by felony information with one count of 
methamphetamine trafficking in the second degree, in violation   
 
 
   
  
 
  
 
 
   
     
 
  
                     
  
 
   
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 712-1240.8 (Supp. 2013) 
(repealed 2016).1 Because the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit’s (cir cuit court) jury instruction on second-degree 
methamphetamine trafficking could have been reasonably 
understood as relieving the State of its burden to prove that 
the relevant state of mind applies to the “attendant 
circumstances” element of the charged offense, we hold that the 
instruction was prejudicially erroneous and remand this case for 
further proceedings. 
I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
A. Relevant Testimony at the Jury Trial 
At a jury trial that commenced on April 21, 2014,2 HPD 
Officer Jerome Pacarro testified to the following description of 
events. On November 26, 2013, at approximately 1:30 p.m., he 
was assigned to an undercover operation involving an attempt to 
purchase narcotics from street-level dealers in Kaka ako.3 On 
the corner of Ohe Street and Olomehani Street, he saw two men 
standing (later identified as Bovee and codefendant Apilado), 
1 In relevant part, HRS § 712 -1240.8 states that “[a] person 
commits the offense of methamphetamine trafficking in the second degree if 
the person knowingly distributes methamphetamine in any amount.” HRS § 712 -
1240.8(1). 
2 The Honorable Glenn J. Kim presided. 
3 Officer Pacarro described a street -level dealer as someone who 
sells twenty- to forty -dollars’ worth of narcotics, whic h is usually for 
personal use.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
and Officer Pacarro made eye contact with them. Based on 
Officer Pacarro’s observation of the men’s proximity, 
conversation, body language, and demeanor, they “looked like two 
friends hanging out.” 
Officer Pacarro parked his car, and Apilado approached 
his driver’s side window and engaged him in conversation even 
though Officer Pacarro did not call out to Apilado or signal him to approach. The conversation progressed into Officer Pacarro 
asking Apilado if anybody “get”; the officer explained that in 
street vernacular (i.e., street slang), this means, “[D]oes 
anybody have narcotics for purchase, for sale?” Apilado asked 
what Officer Pacarro was looking for, and the officer replied 
that he was looking for “clear.” Officer Pacarro explained that 
“[c]lear is another street vernacular used to describe crystal 
methamphetamine. ” Apilado asked how much Officer Pacarro 
wanted, and the officer responded that he wanted forty dollar s’ 
worth. 
During the conversation between Apilado and Officer 
Pacarro, Bovee stayed where he was, about ten feet away from 
Apilado and the officer. Apilado turned and yelled to Bovee to 
get the “stuff” for Officer Pacarro. Bovee did not respond or 
do anything. Apilado then told the officer that he was “going 
to send his boy” to get the methamphetamine, after which Apilado 
3
   
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
approached Bovee, who ended u  p coming to Officer Pacarro’s 
driver’s side window and told the officer that he had to go to a 
nearby tent to retrieve the “stuff.” Bovee told Officer Pacarro 
that he should give  him the money at that point, but Officer  
Pacarro told Bovee that he did not want to get ripped off and asked Bovee if he could go with him to get the “stuff.” Bovee 
agreed. Bovee, Apilado, and Officer Pacarro walked together and 
approached a brown tent, but at the intersection across from 
where the brown tent was located, Apilado told Officer Pacarro 
that they should stop there and that the officer should give the 
money to Bovee.  Officer Pacarro handed the money to Bovee, who 
then entered the tent alone. Five minutes passed, during which 
Officer Pacarro and Apilado engaged in  conversation and Apilado 
yelled numerous times for Bovee to hurry up. Bovee then exited 
the tent with  a white cigarette-type box in his hand  and gave  
the box to Apilado, who then handed the box to Officer Pacarro. 
Inside the box, Officer Pacarro observe d a “clear ziploc kind of 
bag, containing white crystalline substance.” Between the time 
that Bovee exited the tent and  gave Apilado the box, Officer 
Pacarro did not see anyone put anything into the box. The substance recovered by Officer Pacarro was later subjected to  
chemical analysis and identified as crystal methamphetamine.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Bovee also testified to the following recounting of 
events. On November 26, 2013, a white car pulled up in the area 
where Bovee and Apilado were located. After the car parked, 
Apilado approached the car, and Apilado and the driver of the 
car “seemed like friends.” After having a brief conversation 
with the driver, Apilado approached Bovee and asked Bovee to 
take some money from the driver and bring it to Apilado. Bovee 
was hesitant and refused to do Apilado’s bidding, but Apilado 
insisted and “seemed a little more hostile as [Bovee] kept 
refusing,” so Bovee eventually approached the car . 
When Bovee approached the driver, the driver did not 
explain what the money was for and refused to give the money.  
Instead, the driver got out of the car and talked to Apilado; 
Bovee did not hear the conversation. Apilado and the driver 
started walking towards the corner of Ohe and Olomehani Streets, and Apilado told Bovee to follow. Apilado then told the driver 
to hand Bovee the money, and he instructed Bovee to take the 
money and deliver it to Cory, a lady in the brown tent. Bovee 
did not know how much money the driver handed him. Bovee 
delivered the money to Cory, who then went inside the tent even 
though Bovee did not tell her what he (Bovee) needed; while this 
was happening, Apilado and the driver were waiting at the corner of the intersection.  When Cory exited the tent, she handed 
5
   
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
  The State’s proposed instruction for the charged 
offense of second-degree methamphetamine trafficking was 
                     
  
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Bovee a pack of cigarettes. Bovee did not look inside the pack 
and delivered it to Apilado, who then handed it to the driver. 
Later that day, Bovee and Apilado were arrested. 
During his testimony, Bovee was asked whether he 
remembered saying during a post-arrest interview that he “knew 
Apilado was doing a drug deal.” Bovee answered in the 
affirmative but clarified that he only knew about the fact that 
Apilado was engaging in a drug deal after he was arrested.4 
Bovee testified that at the time of the transaction, 
there were no conversations about drugs, the amount of drugs, or 
the amount of money that the driver gave, and Bovee only 
followed Apilado’s instruction to take some money from the 
driver. Bovee did not get any money out of his participation in 
the transaction or any other benefit whatsoever. He did not 
know what happened to the money. 
B. Settling of Jury Instructions 
4 Bovee also stated during the interview that there was nothing in 
the cigarette pack when he had it and that it was Apilado who put drugs in 
the pack and gave it to the driver. The pack felt empty when he received it from Cory, so Bovee assumed that it was empty without actually opening it and 
checking its contents. Bovee indicated that he did not know that there were 
drugs in the cigarette pack. At the end of his interview, however, Bovee 
apparently stated that he had a “good idea ” what was in the pack. Bovee 
clarified at trial that he only “had a feeling” that what transpired was not 
“a normal deal.”  After he was arrested and detained, and after understanding 
what he was charged with, Bovee “figured” that Apila do was engaged in a drug 
deal.

  In Count I of the Information, the Defendant, 
CHARLES BOVEE, is charged with the offense of 
Methamphetamine Trafficking in the Second Degree.  
  A person commits the offense of Methamphetamine 
Trafficking in the Second Degree if he knowingly distributes methamphetamine in any amount.  
  There are two material elements of the offense 
of Methamphetamine Trafficking in the Second Degree, each of which the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable 
doubt.  
   
 
 
  
  The circuit court’s proposed instruction on second -
degree methamphetamine trafficking  was as follows:   
  The Defendant, Charles L. Bovee, is charged 
with the offense of Methamphetamine Trafficking in the 
Second Degree.  
  A person commits the offense of Methamphetamine 
Trafficking in the Second Degree if he knowing ly 
distributes methamphetamine in any amount.  
  There is one material element of the offense of 
Methamphetamine Trafficking in the Second Degree, which the 
prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.  
  
 
  “To distribute” means to sell, transfer, 
prescribe, give, or deliver to another, or to leave, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
identical to Hawai i Pattern Jury Instructions--Criminal (HAWJIC) 
No. 13.62: 
The two elements are: 
1. That on or about November 26th[,]  2013, in 
the City and County of Honolulu, State of 
Hawaii, the Defendant distributed 
methamphetamine in any amount;  
and 
2. That the Defendant did so knowingly. 
The element is as follows:  
1. That on or about the 26th day of November, 
2013, in the City and County of Honolulu, 
State of Hawaii, the Defendant distributed 
methamphetamine in any amount, and he was 
aware that he was doing so .  
7   
 
 
  
  Court’s proposed 1 is the elements instruction 
for the charged offense, meth traffic in the second degree.  
You see what I do here. I obviate the need to give them 
the definitions of knowingly.  I obviate the need for the 
jury to figure out whether the element is conduct, 
attendant circumstances, or result of conduct.  
  I think it’s clearly a conduct element .   HAWJIC 
has two elements, with one element the state of  mind, which 
they always do, which is wrong according to  Aganon.[5]  
   
  
   
 
  
  
  
 
  And this obviates the need to give them,  like I 
say, the definitions of knowingly.  And it  obviates the 
need for them to make certain decisions,  like is --  what 
kind of element is this, et cetera.  So  that’s why I do it  
this way.  
 
  
 
  
                     
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
barter, or exchange with another, or to offer or agree to 
do the same. 
(Emphasis added.) The court explained the rationale behind its 
proposed instruction:  
And, like I said, I do it this way because I 
think the charge lends itself to this treatment. And it’s 
-- anything I can do to keep the jury -- make their job 
easier, and keep them from having to do stuff, and to keep 
them from being confused, I like to do. So that’s why I do 
it this way. I incorporate the knowing state of mind, and 
the definition of knowing as to conduct, right into the element. 
(Emphases added.) 
The State objected to the court’s instruction and 
requested that the court give the standard pattern instruction 
as provided by HAWJIC No. 13.62.  The court explained that its 
proposed instruction simplifies the analytical framework for the 
jury because the instruction clarifies that the only element of 
the charged offense is a “conduct” element, thereby eliminating the risk of the jury erroneously characterizing the element of 
5 The circuit court was referring to State v. Aganon , 97 Hawai i 
299, 36 P.3d 1269 (2001). 
8
   
 
 
   You know, they’re never told what is this 
element. Is it conduct, the result of conduct, or 
attendant circumstance. So they have to make that decision. Before they can apply the correct definition of 
the state of mind to the element, they got to decide what 
kind of an element it is.  Correct?  
 
  
  And what if they choose wrong? What if they 
say I think it’s a result of conduct.  . . .   Then they’re 
going to apply the wrong  definition of knowingly to that 
element, because I think  it’s a conduct element.  
  You know, this obviates that for them.  It 
takes them out of their hands.  And it builds into  the 
element, which is a conduct element, the definition  of 
knowingly as to conduct, which is that the person is  aware 
that his conduct is of that nature.  And I think  that’s 
materially the same as the person’ s aware that  he’s doing 
whatever he’s doing, that he’ s committing the  act.  
  The court reasoned that its proposed instruction is 
essentially what the jury has to decide:  
  
  
 
  Defense counsel objected to the court’s proposed 
instruction on the charged offense, arguing, inter alia,  that 
the State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that 
Bovee knew that the substance he was distributing was 
methamphetamine.  Defense counsel also inquired as to the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the offense and, consequently, the risk of the jury misapplying 
the “knowing” state of mind :  
. . . . 
And what they have to decide is, did he distribute 
methamphetamine in any amount? 
And was he aware that his 
conduct was of that nature. 
The court also  reiterated that its approach is appropriate 
because second-degree methamphetamine trafficking   only has “one 
element. It’s conduct. And you’ve got one state of mind. And 
it’s knowingly.”

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
court’s underlying reasoning for withholding the jury 
instruction on the definition of “knowingly” as provide d by 
HAWJIC No. 6.03.6 The court explained that it was not going to 
give the definition of “knowingly” because doing so would be 
redundant and confusing with respect to the instructions the court would be giving. 
Accordingly, the court submitted to the jury its 
proposed instruction on second-degree methamphetamine trafficking over both parties’ objection .
7 HAWJIC No. 6.03 on 
the definition of “knowingly” was not given to the jury. 
The jury found Bovee guilty of second-degree 
methamphetamine trafficking.  In its July 9, 2014 Judgment of 
Conviction and Sentence (judgment of conviction), the circuit 
court sentenced Bovee to ten years of incarceration with a 
6 HAWJIC No. 6.03 defines “knowingly” as follows: 
A person acts knowingly with respect to his conduct when he 
is aware that his conduct is of that nature. 
A person acts knowingly with respect to attendant 
circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances 
exist. 
A person acts knowingly with respect to a result of his 
conduct when he is aware that it is practically certain 
that his conduct will cause such a result. 
7 The court’s proposed instruction on the included offense of 
promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree was identical in format to the 
court’s instruction on second-degree methamphetamine trafficking.  This 
instruction was also given to the jury over both parties’ objection , which 
was based upon the same reasons underlying their objection to the court’s 
decision to give the proposed instruction on the charged offense.

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
mandatory minimum term of one year of incarceration and to a 
mandatory fine. Bovee timely filed a notice of appeal to the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA). 
II. ICA PROCEEDINGS 
In his opening brief, Bovee argued that the jury 
instructions in this case “only required the jury to unanimously 
find that he was aware that his conduct was the distribution of an object”; the instructions did not require the jury to 
unanimously find, with respect to the attendant circumstances 
element, “that [he] was aware that what he was distributing was 
methamphetamine.” Bovee maintained that, contrary to the 
circuit court’s determination that second-degree methamphetamine 
trafficking only has a conduct element, the offense actually has 
two elements: conduct and attendant circumstances.  Bovee 
contended that the circuit court’s error was prejudicial because 
his defense was that “he did not know what the money was for,” 
nor did he know that “there was methamph etamine in the cigarette 
box.” 
In its answering brief, the State asserted that the 
circuit court’s instruction with regard to second-degree 
methamphetamine trafficking adequately informed the jury that 
the “knowing” state of mind applied to both the attendant 
circumstance and the conduct elements of the offense, not just 
11
   
 
 
     
 
 
 
  
 
                     
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to the conduct element. The State submitted that there is no 
mandate that the circuit court instruct the jury by the separate 
elements of the charged offense.  The State concluded that the 
court provided an understandable instruction that aided the jury 
in applying the law to the facts of the case. 
In his reply brief, Bovee maintained that, while it 
would appear at first glance that the circuit court’s instruction on the charged offense was sufficient to inform the 
jury that the defendant must have  been aware that he was 
distributing methamphetamine, the phrase  that “he was aware that 
he was doing so”  could easily be interpreted as requiring the  
defendant to be  aware of his conduct of  distributing and not 
necessarily that he was also aware that what he was distributing 
8 was methamphetamine.  
The ICA issued a Summary Disposition Order (SDO) on 
December 9, 2016, affirming the judgment of conviction.  The ICA 
explained that, “[w] hen jury instructions or the omission 
thereof are at issue on appeal, the standard of review is whether, when read and considered as a whole, the instructions 
given are prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, 
8 Bovee and the State made similar arguments with regard to the 
included offense of promoting a d angerous drug in the third degree. 
12
   
 
 
    
 
 
  
    
 
  As to Bovee’s argument that the circuit court’s 
instruction was prejudicial to his defense--that he was not 
aware that the object he was distributing was methamphetamine--
the ICA responded that “[a]  reasonable jury would understand 
that the offense required that Bovee distributed methamphetamine 
in any amount. ”   In addition, t he ICA reasoned that “[t] he jury  
clearly disbelieved Bovee’ s testimony as to his knowledge of the 
methamphetamines within the cigarette pack and found him guilty 
                     
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
or misleading. ”9 (Quoting State v. Frisbee , 114 Hawai i 76, 79 -
80, 156 P.3d 1182, 1185-86 (2007)).  Applying this standard to 
the facts of this case, the ICA reasoned that while the 
challenged jury instruction may have been “technically . . . 
incorrect,” it was “substantively correct” and was not 
prejudicially insufficient.  The ICA pointed to this court’s 
decision in Aganon as a basis for its decision. 
For example, in Aganon, even where the trial court 
improperly conflated the conduct and result material 
elements of murder in the second degree, the supreme court  
observed that “the [jury instruction] error did not adversely affect Aganon’s substantial rights. The court’s 
jury instructions were consonant with the spirit of HRS § 702-204 [(2014 Repl.)], which prescribes that the requisite 
state of mind applies to each element of the offense.  Thus, the jury instructions were substantively, if not 
technically, correct.”  
(Quoting State v. Aganon, 97 Hawai i 299, 303, 36 P.3d 1269, 1273 
(2001)). 
9 The ICA’s SDO can be found in full at State v. Bovee, No. CAAP -
14-0001047, 2016 WL 7189933 (App. Dec. 9, 2016) (SDO). 
13
   
 
 
   The propriety of jury instructions is a question of 
law reviewed de novo  using the following standard:  
  The fundamental principles underlying the manner in 
which the State must prove a charged offense against a defendant 
have been summarized by this court as follows:  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of knowingly distributing those methamphetamines. ” Thus, the 
ICA concluded that the circuit court did not err in issuing  its 
instruction regarding the charged offense  or the included 
offense.  
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW  
[W]hether, when read and considered as a whole, the 
instructions given are prejudicially insufficient, 
erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading. Erroneous 
instructions are presumptively harmful and are a ground for 
reversal unless it affirmatively appears from the record as 
a whole  that the error was not prejudicial.  . . . If there  
is such a reasonable possibility in a criminal case, then 
the error is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and 
the judgment of conviction on which it may have been based 
must be set aside.  
State v. Frisbee , 114 Hawai i  76, 79–80, 156 P.3d 1182, 1185 –86 
(2007) (quoting State v. Gonsalves , 108 Hawai i 289, 292 –93, 119 
P.3d 597, 600– 01 (2005)).  
IV. DISCUSSION  
A. The Elements of Second
-Degree Methamphetamine Trafficking  
HRS § 701 –114 (1993) specifies that “no person may be 
convicted of an offense unless . . . [t]he state of mind 
required to establish each element of the offense ” is 
proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 
(Emphasis added.) 
Similarly, HRS § 702 –204 (1993) provides that “a person is 
not guilty of an offense unless the person acted 
intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently, as 
14
   
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
   
                     
  
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the law specifies, with respect to each element of the 
offense.” (Emphasis added.)  
State v. Aganon , 97 Hawai i 299, 302, 36 P.3d 1269, 1272 (2001).  
HRS § 702–205 (1993) identifies the elements of an offense to be 
such (1) conduct, (2) attendant circumstances, and (3) results 
of conduct, as are specified by the definition of the offense.  
Id. However, not all offenses enumerated in the Hawaii Penal 
Code contain all three elements. Id. at 303, 36 P.3d at 1273; 
see State v. Valentine , 93 Hawai i 199, 207, 998 P.2d 479, 487 
(2000). Thus, in reviewing the propriety of the circuit court’s 
instruction on second-degree methamphetamine trafficking, the 
first step is to determine the elements that the statute specifies. 
In relevant part, HRS § 712-1240.8 states as follows: 
“A person commits the offense of methamphetamine trafficking in 
the second degree if the person knowingly distributes 
methamphetamine in any amount .” HRS § 712-1240.8 (Supp. 2013) 
(repealed 2016).
10 The “conduct” element of a criminal offense 
is defined as “ an act or omission, or, where relevant, a series 
of acts or a series of omissions, or a series of acts and 
omissions.” HRS § 701 -118 (1993). The “conduct” element of 
10 Act 231, § 56 repealed HRS § 712 -1240.8.  2016 Haw. Sess. Laws 
Act 231, § 56 at 765. The relevant provisions of Act 231 and their effect s 
on the disposition of this case will be discussed infra . 
15
   
 
 
   
 
  The  “attendant circumstances”  element,  in offenses 
prohibiting the possession of certain objects, consists of  “the 
particular qualities of the object that make it illegal to 
possess it.” State v. Jenkins , 93 Hawai i 87, 111, 997 P.2d 13,  
37 (2000). In Jenkins, the defendant was charged  with, among 
other offenses, possession of a firearm by a person convicted of  
certain crimes  under HRS § 134 -6(c) and (e) (1993 & Supp. 1997)  
(repealed 2006).  Id.  at 94, 997 P.2d at 20.   In pertinent part, 
HRS § 134-6(e) provided , “Any person violating this section by 
carrying or possessing a loaded or unloaded pistol or revolver 
without a license  . . . shall be guilty of a class B felony .” 
HRS § 134-6(e). This court determined that “carrying” is the 
“conduct” element, and “the circumstances attendant to 
‘carrying’  that  object, i.e., the object’ s particular attribute  
rendering its carrying a criminal offense,” under HRS § 134 -6, 
is the object’s “ quality of being a firearm .”  Jenkins, 93 
Hawaii at 113, 997 P.2d   at 39 .  Thus, this court held that the 
circuit court’s instr uctions should have been as follows: that ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
second-degree methamphetamine trafficking is to “distribute[]” 
an object. “‘To distribute’ means to sell, transfer, prescribe, 
give, or deliver to another, or to leave, barter, or exchange 
with another, or to offer or agree to do the same.” HRS § 712 -
1240 (1993).

the defendant “ carried or possessed a firearm, in violation of 
HRS § 134–6(e), with (a) intent or knowledge that he carried or 
possessed an object  and (b) with intent, knowledge, or reckless 
disregard of the substa
ntial and unjustifiable risk that the 
object was a pistol or a revolver.
” Id. (emphases added). 
This court employed the same analysis in Valentine , 93 
Hawaii 199, 998 P.2d 479.  In that case, the defendant was 
charged with the offense of attempted prohibited possession of a firearm pursuant to HRS §§ 705-500 (1993) and 134-7(b) (1993).  
Id.
 at 201, 988 P.2d at 481. HRS § 134-7(b) provides, in 
relevant part, “ No person who . . . has been convicted in this 
State or elsewhere of having committed a felony, or any crime of 
violence, or an illegal sale of any drug shall own, possess, or 
control any firearm or ammunition therefor.” This court 
concluded that the elements of the offense described in HRS § 
134-7(b), as applied to the facts of the Valentine  case, are the 
following: “(1) that a person convicted of a felony (attendant 
circumstance); (2) possesses or controls an object (conduct); 
(3)
 exhibiting the attributes of a firearm (attendant 
circumstances) .” Valentine, 93 Hawai i at 207, 998 P.2d at 487.  
The court further observed that the offense under HRS § 134-7(b) 
does not have a “result of conduct” element. Id.  
17

   
 
 
   Guided by these precedents  , second -degree 
methamphetamine trafficking has two “attendant circumstances” 
elements: (a) the object distributed   is methamphetamine and (b) 
the amount  of methamphetamine (which in this case is “any 
11 amount”).   Notably, “methamphetamine” and “any amount” are 
attributes that make the distribution (conduct element) criminal 
12 pursuant to HRS § 712-1240.8.   Jenkins, 93 Hawai i at 113, 997   
P.2d at 39.  This is consistent with  Jenkins  and Valentine, both 
of which held that as to the conduct of “possession” and 
“carrying,” the attendant circums tances are the qualities of the 
object that render its possession or carrying illegal.   Id.; 
Valentine, 93 Hawai i at 207, 998 P.2d   at 487.   
  
 
                     
   
 
  
 
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The determination that “methamphetamine” and “any 
amount” are “attendant circumstances” elements of second-degree 
11 As stated by this court, to obtain a conviction for distributing 
an illegal drug in cases “where the sale has been consummated,” “ the 
government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the substance 
involved is that specified in the indictment.” State v. Schofill , 63 Haw. 
77, 80–81, 621 P.2d 364, 368 (1980). When the sale of the illegal drug has 
not been consummated and the gist of the offense is an offer or the agreement to sell narcotics , the State is not required to prove that the drug involved 
is that specified in the charging instrument. Id. It follows that in such 
cases, the material elements with which a trial court must charge the jury 
would differ from those required in this case.  See id.  
12 Because the offense is committed when a person distributes 
methamphetamine in any amount , the “any amount” attendant circumstance 
element of the offense is satisfied when the State proves beyond a reasonable 
doubt that the object distributed is methamphetamine. Therefore, for the purposes of second -degree methamphetamine trafficking, the “methamphetamine” 
and “any amount” attendant circumstances elements can be consolidated with in 
a single element.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
methamphetamine trafficking is underscored by HRS § 712-1252.13 
HRS § 712-1252 provides, in pertinent part, the following: 
(1) The fact that a person engaged in the conduct specified 
by any section in this part is prima facie evidence that 
the person engaged in that conduct with knowledge of the 
character, nature, and quantity of the dangerous drug, 
harmful drug, detrimental d
rug, or intoxicating compounds 
possessed, distributed, or sold. 
HRS § 712-1252(1) (1993) (emphasis added).  HRS § 712  -1252(1) 
thus indicates that the State, in proving offenses under Part IV 
of HRS chapter 712 (Offenses Related to Drugs and Intoxicating  
Compounds), must  demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) 
the “person enga ged in the conduct specified” by the applicable 
statute and (2) the  “person engaged in that conduct with 
knowledge of the character, nature, and quantity of the 
dangerous drug.” HRS § 712-1252(1).   The character, nature, and 
quantity of the illegal drug are thus “attendant circumstances” 
elements. 
To conclude, the offense of second
-degree 
methamphetamine trafficking under HRS § 712-1240.8 has two 
elements: (1) distribution of an object (conduct) and (2) the 
object is methamphetamine in any amount (attendant 
13 Interpreting the meaning of a statute by relying in part on 
another related statute is an accepted interpretive practice under the well -
settled canon that “[l]aws in pari materia , or upon the same subject matter, 
shall be construed with reference to each other. What is clear in one 
statute may be called upon in aid to explain what is doubtful in another.” 
State v. Alangcas , 134 Hawaii 515, 527, 345 P.3d 181, 193 (2015) (quoting 
State v. Kamana o, 118 Hawaii 210, 218, 188 P.3d 724, 732 (2008)); accord HRS 
§ 1–16 (1993).

circumstances).14 The offense has no “results of conduct” 
element. Cf. Valentine, 93 Hawai i at 207, 998 P.2d at 487. 
B. The Applicable State of Mind as to Each Element of the 
Charged Offense
 
HRS § 702 –204 provides that “a person is not guilty of 
an offense unless the person acted intentionally, knowingly, 
recklessly, or negligently, as the law specifies, with respect 
to each element of the offense. ” HRS § 702
–204 (1993). As 
stated, HRS § 712-1240.8 provides, “ A person commits the offense 
of methamphetamine trafficking in the second degree if the 
person knowingly  distributes methamphetamine in any amount. ” 
HRS § 712-1240.8(1) (Supp. 2013) (repealed 2016) (emphasis 
added). Thus, “the law specifies,” HRS § 702 –204, that a person 
must act “knowingly,” HRS § 712 -1240.8, with respect to the 
elements of second-degree methamphetamine trafficking.  HRS § 
702-206 defines “knowingly” as follows: 
(a) A person acts knowingly with respect to his conduct 
when he is aware that his conduct is of that nature. 
(b) A person acts knowingly with respect to attendant 
circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances exist. 
(c) A person acts knowingly with respect to a result of his 
conduct when he is aware that it is practically certain 
that his conduct will cause such a result. 
14 The elements discussed will not be identical to situations 
involving a non- consummated sale of an illegal drug that occurs in the course 
of an offer or agreement to sell such drug.  See supra note 11.  We do not 
further elaborate on the material elements that must be charged in such 
situations because they are not pertinent to the facts of this case. 
20
   
 
 
  
  Applying the statutory definition of “knowingly” to 
the conduct element and the attendant circumstances element of 
second-degree methamphetamine trafficking, the State must prove 
beyond a reasonable doubt that  the person char ged (1) is aware 
that he or she  engaged in an act of  distribution of an object  
and (2) is aware that the object  distributed  constitutes 
methamphetamine in any amount.  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  The Defendant, Charles L. Bovee, is charged 
with the offense of Methamphetamine Trafficking in the 
Second Degree.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
HRS § 702-206(2) (1993). 
C. The Circuit Court’s Jury Instruction on Second -Degree 
Methamphetamine Trafficking was Prejudicially Insufficient
 
We now consider whether the circuit court’s 
instruction on second-degree methamphetamine trafficking was 
correct in light of the elements discussed and the state of mind 
that must be applied as to each element. 
It is the duty of the circuit judge to see to it that the 
case goes to the jury in a clear and intelligent manner, so 
that they may have a clear and correct understanding of what 
it is they are to decide, and he or she shall state to them 
fully the law applicable to the facts. 
State v. Culkin , 97 Hawai i 206, 214 –15, 35 P.3d 233, 241 –42 
(2001) (quoting State v. Kinnane , 79 Hawai i  46, 50, 897 P.2d 
973, 977 (1995)).  
The circu it court’s instruction, given over the 
objection of both Bovee and the State, 
provided as follows: 
21
   
 
 
   
 
  
 
   
 
  
 
 
   The circuit court’s instruction states that there is 
but one material element, when in  fact, as discussed  supra, 
there are two.  Based on the language of the instructio  n, the 
circuit court incorrectly combined the two material elements of  
second-degree methamphetamine trafficking into one.  See State  
v. Aganon, 97 Hawai i 299, 303, 36 P.3d 1269, 1273 (2001)   
(concluding that it was error to combine two elements of the 
offense into one and instructing the circuit court to separately 
list the elements on remand). In addition, t he circuit court’s 
instruction is ambiguous because the jury could have interpreted   
it as requiring the application of the “knowing” state of mind 
only to “distribute,” the conduct element , and not to the 
attendant circumstances element.  The instruction indicated that 
the single element  of the offense  was that   “the Defendant ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
A person commits the offense of Methamphetamine 
Trafficking in the Second Degree if he knowingly 
distributes methamphetamine in any amount. 
There is one material element of the offense of 
Methamphetamine Trafficking in the Second Degree, which the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt. 
The element is as follows: 
1.
 That on or about the 26th day of November, 
2013, in the City and County of Honolulu, 
State of Hawaii, the Defendant distributed 
methamphetamine in any amount, and he was 
aware that he was doing so . 
“To distribute” means to sell, transfer, 
prescribe, give, or deliver to another, or to leave, barter, or exchange with another, or to offer or agree to do the same. 
(Emphasis added.) 
22
   
 
 
      
  
 
  
    
   
 
 
   
 
 
 
   
 
  
   
                     
   
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
distributed methamphetamine in any amount, and he was aware that 
he was doing so .” (Emphasis added.) The term “doing” is 
commonly understood as referring to “the act of performing or 
executing” an 
action.15 Thus, awareness that one is “doing” 
something is ordinarily understood to require awareness that one is “performing or executing” a particular “conduct.” Since the 
wording of the circuit court’s instruction was predominantly 
centered on the requirement of “doing ,” the instruction may have 
conveyed to the jury that the State’s burden was solely to prove 
Bovee’s awareness that he was engaged in the distribution (e.g., 
transferring, selling, delivering, etc.) of the object involved 
in this case. 
Accordingly, the court’s instruction may have been 
understood as having only one requirement: that Bovee was aware 
that he was distributing an object.  And this is supported by the circuit court’s statement that there was only one element, 
“conduct”: 
You see what I do here.  I obviate the need to 
give them the definitions of knowingly. I obviate the need 
for the jury to figure out whether the element is conduct, 
attendant circumstances, or result of conduct. 
I think it’s clearly a conduct element .  
. . . . 
15 Doing, Merriam- Webster, https://www.merriam -webster.com/ 
dictionary/doing (last visited May 3, 2017) . 
23
   
 
 
   I incorporate the knowing state of mind, and 
the definition of knowing as to conduct , right into the 
element.  
  
 
     
 
 
   
  
 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(Emphases added.) Thus, the circuit court’s instruction was 
meant to apply the “knowing” state of mind only to the conduct 
element (to “distribute”) of second -degree methamphetamine 
trafficking and not to the attendant circumstances element (i.e., “methamphetamine in any amount”). Simply stated, the 
instructions did not make it clear that Bovee ’s awareness 
applied both to his conduct and to the character and nature of 
the object he was distributing. See Aganon, 97 Hawai i at 303 — 
04, 36 P.3d at 1273 —74 (explaining that the jury instruction was 
erroneous because it allowed the jury to find the defendant 
guilty based on the satisfaction of just one of the elements of 
the offense so long as the element is accompanied by the 
requisite state of mind); see also Culkin, 97 Hawai i at 214 –15, 
35 P.3d at 241 –42 (holding that the adequacy of a jury 
instruction is measured by determining whether the instruction 
clearly and correctly specifies what the jury must decide). 
The absence of any instruction regarding the 
definition of “knowingly” exacerbated the ambiguity in the 
circuit court’s instruction. The circuit court stated that it 
“incorporate[d ] the knowing state of mind, and the definition of 
knowing as to conduct, right into the element.” The court, 
24
   
 
 
  
                     
  
  
   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
therefore, did not clearly apprise the jury of the fact that, as 
to attendant circumstances, “[a]  person acts knowingly . . .  
when he is aware that such circumstances exist .” HRS § 702-
206(2)(b) (1993). Thus, the circuit court’s instruction was 
“prejudicially insufficient ”  because it was inconsistent with 
and did not clearly conform to the requirements of HRS § 702 – 
204, which requires proof that “the person acted intentionally, 
knowingly, recklessly, or negligently, as the law specifies, 
with respect to each element   of the offense. ” HRS § 702–204  
(1993) (emphasis added) ; Aganon , 97 Hawai i at   302, 36 P.3d at  
16 1272.  To this extent, the instruction did not provide members 
of the jury with “a clear and correct understanding of what it 
is they are to decide.”  Culkin, 97 Hawai i at   214–15, 35 P.3d at  
241–42 (quoting Kinnane, 79 Hawai i at 50, 897 P.2d   at 977).   
The ICA, relying on Aganon
, concluded that the “ jury 
instruction was substantively correct and therefore was not 
prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or 
misleading.” The ICA reasoned that “in Aganon, even where the 
trial court improperly conflated the conduct and result material 
16 We note that the circuit court’s incorporation of the applicable 
state of mind into its enumeration of the material elements of the charged 
offense was commendable as it sought to assist the jury’s understanding of 
the requirements for proof of an offense . However, in this case, the court’s 
integration of the state of mind into the elements of the offense was 
incomplete. 
25
   
 
 
  
  
  
   
  
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
elements of murder in the second degree, the supreme court 
observed that ‘the [jury instruction] error did not adversely 
affect Aganon’s substantial rights.’” Id. (alteration in 
original) (quoting Aganon, 97 Hawai i at 303, 36 P.3d at 1273).  
The ICA’s reading of Aganon is incorrect. At the outset, Aganon 
determined that the circuit court’s instruction was erroneous 
and prejudicial because it allowed the jury to find the 
defendant “guilty based on only one element of the offense so 
long as it was accompanied by the requisite state of mind.” 
Aganon, 97 Hawai i at 303, 36 P.3d at 1273. The erroneous 
instruction, the court continued, was aggravated by the circuit 
court’s response to a jury communication --that conviction may be 
had simply by finding that the applicable state of mind is 
present as to any one element (and not as to all elements) of 
the offense. Id. The Aganon court, invoking plain error, 
vacated the conviction for second-degree murder and remanded the case for a retrial. Id. at 303 –04, 36 P.3d at 1273 –74. 
In addition, this court determined in Aganon that the 
circuit court’s conflation of the “conduct” and “result” elements of second-degree murder was erroneous and instructed 
the circuit court to separately list these two distinct elements 
26
   
 
 
     
 
  
 
 
 
   
  
  
 
 
 
                     
   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
on remand. Id.  at 303, 36 P.3d at 1273.17 Thus, contrary to 
the ICA’s determination, Aganon  reinforces the conclusion that 
the circuit court’s instruction in this case is prejudicially 
insufficient and erroneous because, similar to Aganon, the 
instruction here conflated the “conduct” and “attendant 
circumstances” elements of the offense and was ambiguous in that 
it could have advised the jury that the satisfaction of the 
“conduct” element, when accompanied by the “knowing” state of 
mind, was sufficient to convict Bovee. See id. at 303–04, 36 
P.3d at 1273–74. 
D. The Erroneous Jury Instruction Was Not Harmless Beyond A 
Reasonable Doubt
 
A determination that the circuit court’s instruction 
was prejudicially insufficient and had the potential to mislead the jury does not end the analysis, for the “ question [is] 
whether there is a reasonable possibility that [the] error might 
have contributed to conviction. ” State v. Frisbee , 114 Hawai i 
76, 79–80, 156 P.3d 1182, 1185 –86 (2007) (quoting State v. 
Gonsalves, 108 Hawai i 289, 292 –93, 119 P.3d 597, 600 –01 (2005)).  
“If there is such a reasonable possibility in a criminal case, 
17 This court’s conclusion in Aganon that the “jury instructions 
were consonant with the spirit of HRS § 702 -204” was made with respect t o the 
circuit court’s characterization of the “requisite state of mind as a 
‘material element’” and not with respect to the circuit court’s conflation of 
two distinct elements of second -degree murder, as the ICA’s SDO appears to 
state. Aganon, 97 Hawai i at 303, 36 P.3d at 1273 . 
27
   
 
 
   
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
then the error is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and 
the judgment of conviction on which it may have been based must 
be set aside.” Id.  In this case, a central part of Bovee’s 
defense was that he was not aware of the character of the object that he distributed; that is, he did not know that the object 
was methamphetamine. 
This defense theory was developed throughout the jury 
trial. 
In his opening statement, defense counsel stated that 
Apilado wanted Bovee “to basically be a mule” --someone who would 
carry the money and the box that contained methamphetamine. During his testimony, Bovee stated that he was not aware that he 
was participating in a narcotics transaction or that the object 
he received from Cory and delivered to Officer Pacarro contained 
or constituted methamphetamine. In his closing argument, 
defense counsel un derscored Bovee’s testimony that he was not 
aware that the cigarette box Cory handed him and later delivered 
to Officer Pacarro contained methamphetamine. 
The circuit court’s instruction, however, did not 
clearly inform the jury that the “knowing” state of mind applied 
to the attendant circumstances element of the charged offense, i.e., that the object distributed constituted methamphetamine in 
any amount. The instruction had at least the potential of conveying to the jury that the State was not required to prove 
28
   
 
 
   
  
 
    
 
 
  
                     
   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Bovee’s awareness of the fact that the object he distributed was methamphetamine. Accordingly, the circuit court’s ambiguous 
instruction regarding second-degree methamphetamine trafficking, coupled with the absence of the definition of the “knowing” 
state of mind, was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
18 Cf. 
State v. Aganon , 97 Hawai i 299, 303 –04, 36 P.3d 1269, 1273 –74 
(2001) (concluding that the erroneous instruction was not harmless because it required the jury to find the defendant 
“guilty based on only one element of the offense so long as it 
was accompanied by the requisite state of mind”) ; State v. 
Valentine, 93 Hawai i 199, 208, 998 P.2d 479, 488 (2000) 
(concluding that the requisite state of mind for the offense of 
attempted prohibited possession of a firearm is “intentionally” 
and holding that the circuit court’s instruction, w hich allowed 
the jury to convict the defendant upon a “knowing” state of mind, was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt).
19 
18 This holding similarly applies to the circuit court’s jury 
instruction on the included offense of promoting a dangerous drug in the 
third degree. 
19   The ICA determined that “[t]he jury clearly disbelieved Bovee’s  
testimony as to his knowledge of the methamphetamines within the cigarette pack and found him guilty of knowingly distributing those methamphetamines.” 
However, as discussed, the circuit court’s instruction  had at least the 
potential of leading the jury to believe that it was not required to find 
beyond a reasonable doubt that Bovee  was aware that the object he was  
distributing was methamphetamine in any amount. Under such circumstances, it 
cannot be readily concluded that the jury “clearly disbelieved” Bovee’s 
defense.

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
E. Act 231 and t he ICA’s Failure to Remand the Case for 
Resentencing
 
Bovee further contends that the ICA erred in not 
remanding his case for resentencing pursuant to Act 231 of the 
Session Laws of Hawaii 2016. Act 231 repealed HRS § 712-1240.8 
(Supp. 2013) (repealed 2016) (methamphetamine trafficking in the 
second degree) under which Bovee was charged and convicted.  
2016 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, § 56 at 765.  Act 231 also amended 
HRS § 712-1242(1)(c) (Supp. 2016) (promoting a dangerous drug in 
the second degree) in order to expand its application to 
methamphetamine distribution.20 The practical effect of the 
repeal of HRS § 712-1240.8 and the amendment to HRS § 712 -
1242(1)(c) was to transfer the offense previously prohibited by 
HRS § 712-1240.8 to HRS § 712-1242(1)(c). 
The transfer to HRS § 712-1242(1)(c) provides greater 
discretion to a court rendering a sentence for a defendant 
convicted of offenses involving methamphetamine distribution.  
Under HRS § 712-1240.8, the sentence for second-degree 
methamphetamine trafficking was “ an indeterminate term of 
imprisonment of ten years with a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of not less than one year and not greater than four 
20 Act 231, § 55 amended the language of HRS § 712 -1242(1)(c) as 
follows: “(c) Distributes any dangerous drug in any amount[ , except for 
methamphetamine].” (Ramseyer formatted.)

years and a fine not to exceed $10,000,000,” with longer 
mandatory minimum sentences prescribed for repeat offenders. 
HRS § 712-1240.8(3). After the incorporation of second-degree 
methamphetamine trafficking into HRS § 712-1242(1)(c), which 
remains classified as a class B felony (see HRS § 712-1242(2)), 
a person convicted of the offense may now be sentenced to a term 
of probation under HRS § 706-620 (Supp. 2016) or to a maximum 
length of imprisonment of ten years under HRS § 706-660,21 with 
the minimum term to be set by the Hawai i paroling authority, see 
HRS §§ 706-660(1)(a) (Supp. 2013), 706-669 (2014). Because Act 
231 reclassified distribution of methamphetamine in any amount 
as a class B felony with the standard monetary penalties, the 
fine that may be imposed has also now been capped at $25,000 
(instead of $10,000,000). HRS §§ 706-640(1)(b) (2014), 706-641 
(2014). 
Section 70 of Act 231 “provide[s] that [sections] 
54, 
55, and 56 shall apply to offenses committed before the 
effective date of this Act.” (Emphasis added.) If such an 
offense was “[o]riginally charged as a violation of [HRS §] 712 -

appeal has been entered,” s ection 70 of Act 231 requires the 
appellate court to do either of the following: “(a) Remand the 
case for sentencing pursuant to this Act if the judgment is 
affirmed on appeal or if the sentence is vacated; or (b) Remand 
the case for further proceedings pursuant to this Act if the 
judgment is reversed and remanded for further proceedings.” 
2016 Sess. Laws Act 231, § 70(4) at 776. 
In this case, Bovee committed the offense before the 
July 1, 2016 effective date of Act 231 and was charged pursuant 
to HRS § 712-1240.8; he was convicted and sentenced by the 
circuit court; and the ICA’s judgment on appeal was not entered 
until January 6, 2017--after the effective date of Act 231.  
Given these facts, and because the ICA affirmed the judgment of 
conviction, Bovee is correct that section 70(4)(a) of Act 231 
required the ICA to “[r] emand the case for [re]sentencing.” 
2016 Sess. Laws Act 231, § 70(4)(a) at 776. The ICA did not do 
so, and this contradicts the mandate of section 70 of Act 231. 
See 2016 Sess. Laws Act 231, § 70(4)(a) at 776. 
However, the requirement under section 70 of Act 231 
for an appellate court to remand a case for resentencing is 
predicated on the appellate court’s affirmance of the circuit 
court’s judgment.  Here, the ICA’s affirmance of the judgment of 
conviction is erroneous, and the disposition of this case is the

vacatur of the judgments of the ICA and the circuit court and 
remand to the circuit court for a new trial.  Thus, there is no 
predicate for the application of the remand-for-resentencing 
provision of Act 231, section 70(4)(a), and this provision is 
not triggered.  However, because the judgments of the ICA and 
the circuit court are vacated and the case is remanded, section 
70(4)(b) of Act 231 requires this court to “[r]emand the case 
for further proceedings pursuant to” Act 231. 2016 Sess. Laws 
Act 231, § 70(4)(b) at 776.22 Thus, on remand, Bovee may be 
retried under HRS § 712-1242(1)(c) (promoting a dangerous drug 
in the second degree) and not under the now-repealed HRS § 712 -
1240.8 (methamphetamine trafficking in the second degree). 
V. CONCLUSION 
Because the circuit court’s erroneous instruction on 
the offense of second-degree methamphetamine trafficking is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the ICA’s January 6, 2017 
Judgment on Appeal and the judgment of conviction of the circuit 
22 Section 70 of Act 231 states that, where an offense was 
“[o]riginally charged as a violation of [HRS §] 712 -1240.8, . . . for which 
the defendant has been convicted on a plea or verdict and sentenced but for 
which no final judgment on appeal has been entered,” an appellate court must “[r]emand the case for further proceedings pursuant to this Act if the 
judgment is 
reversed
 and rema
nded for further proceedings.” 2016 Sess. Laws 
Act 231, § 70(4)(b) at 776 (emphasis added). We interpret the word “reverse” 
to mean “vacate” as the latter is defined by Hawai i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 35(e) (2010) (providing that “the phrase ‘vacate and 
remand’ indicates the litigation continues in the court or agency in 
accordance with the appellate court’s instruction”).
