OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J.
  
This case concerns the 
right of an arrested person 
under statutory law to communicate and consult with counsel. 
The defendant in this case, following his arrest for operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant and prior to 
deciding whether to submit to alcohol concentration testing, was 
affirmatively advised that he was not entitled to an attorney 
before submitting to any tests to determine his breath or blood  
 
 
 
   
  
  
 
  
  
   
   
  
 
  
 
  After being booked by the desk sergeant at the 
station, Officer Krekel read to Scalera HPD Form 396K  , titled  
“Use of Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle Implied Consent ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
alcohol concentration.  We hold that this advisory is 
inconsistent with Hawaii’s statutory right to access counsel, 
but we conclude under the facts of this case that the 
defendant’s subsequent refusal to submit to testing is not 
subject to suppression. 
I. BACKGROUND 
A. June 28, 2013 Arrest 
On June 28, 2013, at about 11:00 p.m., John Scalera 
was stopped while driving westbound on Kailua Road by Honolulu Police Department (HPD) Officers Lordy Cullen and Michael Krekel 
for weaving back and forth over the roadway’s solid and broken 
white lines. Officer Cullen informed Scalera why he had stopped him, and Scalera responded that he had consumed “ a few drinks 
with his friends, ” was travelling home, and was “good to drive.”  
Officer Cullen detected a strong odor of alcohol emitting from 
Scalera’s breath and noticed that Scalera was “flushed red in his face.” Officer Krekel administered the standardized field 
sobriety test to Scalera. Based on the test results, Scalera was arrested and transported to the Kailua Police Station.

  The bottom half of the implied consent form set forth 
the following types of tests to which a defendant could consent:   
 
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
for Testing” ( implied consent form).  The top half of the 
implied consent form stated as follows: 
Pursuant to chapter 291E, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), 
Use of Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle, you are being informed of the following: 
1. ____ Any person who operates a vehicle upon a public 
way, street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of the 
State shall be deemed to have given consent to a test or 
tests for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration or drug content of the persons breath, blood, or urine as 
applicable. 
2.
 ____ You are not entitled to an attorney before you 
submit to any tests 
[sic] or tests to determine your 
alcohol and/or drug content. 
3. ____ You may refuse to submit to a breath or blood 
test, or both for the purpose of determining alcohol 
concentration and/or blood or urine test, or both for the 
purpose of determining drug content, none shall be given, 
except as provided in section 291E -21.  However, if you 
refuse to submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, you 
shall be subject to up to thirty days imprisonment and/or 
fine up to $1,000 or the sanctions of 291E -65, if 
applicable. In addition, you shall also be subject to the procedures and sanctions under chapter 291E, part III. 
(Emphasis added). Scalera initialed each of the three 
paragraphs located in the top portion of the implied consent form.

. . . .  
I, THE ARRESTEE/RESPONDENT, ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I MADE THE 
CHOICE(S) INDICATED ABOVE AND WAS INFORMED OF THE 
INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT.  
After Officer Krekel read aloud the four testing options, 
Scalera stated that he “wasn’t going to take anything,” which 
Officer Krekel understood to  “count[]  as a refusal.” On the 
form next to these options, Officer Krekel  wrote “refused to 
initial.” At this point, Officer Krekel repeated to Scalera  
that his options were to (1) take a breath test and refuse the blood test, (2) take a blood test and refuse the breath test, 
(3) take both the breath test and blood test, or (4) refuse both the breath test and the blood test. Upon asking Scalera if he 
understood, Scalera  again verbally responded ,  “I’m not taking 
anything.”  
Officer Krekel 
then read to Scalera HPD Form 396B-1, 
titled “Sanctions for Use of Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle & Implied Consent for Testing” (sanctions form).
1 After 
1 The sanctions form states, in relevant part, as follows: 
I, Michael Krekel , a police officer, swear that the 
following statements were read to the arrestee: 
Pursuant to chapter 291E, Hawaii Revised Statute s (HRS), 
Use of Intoxicants While Operating a Vehicle, you are being 
informed of the following: 
1.
 ____ If you choose to take an alcohol concentration 
test and the test result is below the legal limit of 0.08,

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
reading the sanctions form to Scalera, Officer Krekel  initialed 
next to the various sections that Scalera “refused to initial 
and also sign.” Officer Krekel asked Scalera if he understood 
what was read to him  from the sanctions form, and Scalera did  
not respond. When Officer Krekel informed Scalera that his refusal to sign constituted a refusal to submit to testing, 
(. . .continued) 
the administrative revocation proceedings will be 
terminated with prejudice. 
2. ____ If you are under twenty -one years of age it is 
unlawful for you to operate a vehicle upon a public way, 
street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of the State while under the influence of a measurable amount of 
alcohol (0.02 or greater, but less than 0.08). 
3. ____ If you choose to take a drug test and the test 
fails to indicate the presence of one or more drugs in an 
amount sufficient to impair your ability to operate a vehicle in a careful and prudent manner, the administrative 
revocation proceedings will be terminated with prejudice. 
4. ____ The test or tests to determine your drug content 
shall also be admissible in determining your alcohol 
concentration, but your submission to testing for drugs shall not substitute for alcohol concentration tests. 
5. ____ If you are convicted of operating a vehicle under 
the influence of intoxicants or have your vehicle license 
or privilege to operate a vessel suspended or revoked, you 
may be ordered to reimburse the county for the cost of a blood or urine test or both.

11. ____ Criminal charges may be filed against you under 
part IV, Prohibited Conduct, section 291E. 
12. ____ If you refuse to be tested, criminal charges may 
be filed against you under part IV, Prohibited Conduct, 
section 291E or if applicable, you may be subject to the 
sanctions of section 291E -65.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Scalera asked Officer Krekel to go over the sanctions form from 
the first to the last page.2 Officer Krekel handed Scalera the 
sanctions form, but according to Officer Krekel, Scalera “didn’t 
want to take a test so that also constituted a refusal.” 
Officer Krekel did not hear Scalera ask for an 
attorney. Officer Krekel noted, however, that Scalera “could 
have” asked for an att orney, but that he did not “recall 
[Scalera] saying that.” Officer Krekel stated that “[i]t 
wouldn’t have mattered anyways because the forms state that you’re not entitled to an attorney during the implied consent.” 
B. District Court and Appellate Proceedings 
On July 1, 2013, the State of Hawai ʻi filed a written 
complaint in the District Court of the First Circuit, Kaneohe 
Division (district court), charging that on June 28, 2013, John 
Scalera committed the offense of operating a vehicle under the 
influence of an intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1)
3 (count 1) and the offense 
2 HPD Sergeant Dela Cruz observed Officer Krekel read the implied 
consent form to Scalera. Sergeant Dela Cruz testified that he did not recall 
if Officer Krekel reread the implied consent form after Scalera requested the 
second reading, but that if Officer Krekel had reread the form, then he (Sergeant Dela Cruz) would have noted the second reading in his written 
report, which he had not. 
3 HRS § 291E- 61 provides in relevant part: 
(continued. . .) 
6
  
 
 
 
  
  
  Prior to trial, Scalera filed a motion to suppress 
seeking to preclude the use of “all evidence indicating that, on 
or about June 28, 2013, [Scalera] was operating a vehicle under 
the influence of an intoxicant . . . and refused to submit to 
testing.” Scalera alleged that this evidence was obtained in 
violation of his rights, citing  article I, section 7 of the 
Hawaiʻi Constitut ion, the Fourth  and Fourteenth Amendments to the   
                                                                  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of refusal to submit to a breath, blood, and/or urine test in 
violation of HRS § 291E-684 (count 2). If convicted of the OVUII 
charge, Scalera was subject to sentencing as a first-time offender pursuant to HRS § 291E-61(b)(1) (Supp. 2012). 
(. . .continued) 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle 
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates 
or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle: 
(1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount 
sufficient to impair the person’s normal mental faculties 
or ability to care for the person or guard against 
casualty. . . . 
HRS § 291E- 61(a)(1) (Supp. 2012). 
4 At the time Scalera was charged, HRS § 291E -68 stated as follows: 
Except as provided in section 291E- 65, refusal to submit to 
a breath, blood, or urine test as required by part II is a petty misdemeanor. 
HRS § 291E- 68 (Supp. 2012) (repealed Apr. 26, 2016).

United States Constitution, and HRS §§ 291E  -11(b) (2007), 291E -
5  15 (2007), and 803 -9 (1993). 
In a memorandum in support of his motion, Scalera 
argued that evidence in his case should be suppressed because he 
was “preemptively and illegally denied” the right to consult 
with counsel as provided by HRS § 803-9.  Specifically, Scalera 
alleged that the implied consent form “provides an overbroad and 
incorrect statement of law that no right to counsel exists prior to making an informed consent decision, thereby ignoring the rights afforded to [Scalera] under HRS § 803-9.” Scalera 
contended that because he was denied a reasonable opportunity to 
consult with an attorney, he did not make a knowing and 
intelligent decision with regard to his informed consent 
options. Scalera did not base the arguments in his memorandum 
on any provisions of the Hawai ʻi Constitution or the United 
States Constitution or contend that he had been unlawfully 
stopped or interrogated by police. 
In its opposition memorandum, the State contended that 
Scalera had no statutory right to consult with counsel under HRS 
§ 803-9 prior to making his decision to refuse or submit to

 6  Three HPD officers testified for the State regarding the 
circumstances leading to Scalera’s arrest and the events at the police 
station as recounted above. Scalera did not testify or present any evidence.  
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
testing, citing State v. Severino , 56 Haw. 378, 380, 537 P.2d 
1187, 1189 (1975). The State submitted that reading the implied 
consent form and administering breath or blood tests are “in the 
nature of a booking procedure,” and therefore, a defendant does 
not have any right to counsel during this time.  The State also 
maintained that the implied consent form had already “adequately 
informed” Scalera of the consequences of his refusal. 
An e
videntiary hearing was held on Scalera’s motion .6 
At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court denied 
Scalera’s motion to suppress.7 In its oral ruling, the court 
stated that it viewed the motion in large part based upon a “defendant’s right to counsel” under HRS § 803-9. The court 
determined there was no violation of HRS § 803-9 because it was 
not an “interrogation situation.” The court also concluded that 
Scalera understood his rights and the information on the implied 
consent form and the sanctions form, and thus the court found that Scalera understood the consequences of his decisions. The 
7 Scalera’s counsel argued at the motion to suppress hearin g that 
Scalera did not understand the implied consent and sanctions forms, that 
there was inconsistent police testimony with respect to his arrest and the 
standardized field sobriety test administration, and that as a result, the 
field sobriety test results and the implied consent form should be excluded from evidence. Scalera did not present argument with respect to any alleged 
constitutional violations.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
district court in its ruling did not address or make any 
findings of fact or conclusions of law regarding the traffic 
stop. 
Following a trial at which Scalera and several HPD 
officers testified,8 the district court concluded that the State 
had proved beyond a reasonable doubt the OVUII offense charged in count 1 and the refusal offense charged in count 2. On July 
22, 2014, the district court entered its Notice of Entry of 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment (district court judgment).
9 
Scalera appealed the district court judgment to the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), arguing that the court had 
erred in failing to determine in its motion to suppress ruling 
whether the traffic stop was unlawful.  Scalera also contended 
that the court had erred in denying his motion to suppress. 
Specifically, Scalera maintained that his statutory right to counsel under HRS § 803-9 had been violated and that the 
8 At trial, Scalera testified that he did not understand portions 
of the implied consent form, and he could not read the form because he did 
not have his glasses. Scalera also testified that he asked for an attorney 
during the reading of the implied consent form. Scalera did not indicate the 
course of action that he may have taken had counsel been provided. 
9 The Honorable Michael A. Marr presided. Scalera was sentenced to 
various monetary sanctions, 72 hours of community service, a substance abuse assessment, and a one- year license revocation. 
10
  
 
 
 
                      
  
 
 
 
 
  Similarly, Scalera recognized that he did not “specifically state 
[before the district court] that evidence was obtained as a result of an 
illegal traffic stop.” He contended, however, that he properly preserved 
this argument on appeal because he cited article I, section 7 of the Hawai ʻi 
Constitution in his motion to suppress and because testimony at the 
suppression hearings implicated the lawfulness of the stop.  
   
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
district court had erred in concluding otherwise. He also 
contended that the district court had erroneously concluded that 
he was not subject to an interrogation implicating his Miranda  
10 rights.   In an April 29, 2016 Summary Disposition Order, the  
ICA affirmed the district court judgment.   The ICA rejected 
Scalera’s argument that the district court had failed to rule on 
the lawfulness of the traffic stop, stating  that Scalera failed 
to raise an argument regarding  the constitutional validity of 
the stop before the district court.   Further, the ICA concluded 
that Scalera failed to establish that the stop was in fact 
unlawful and thus  it was not plain error for the district court 
11 to deny his motion to suppress.  
10 In his opening b rief to the ICA and in his application for 
certiorari to this court, Scalera acknowledged that he had not based his 
motion to suppress on an alleged failure to provide him with Miranda 
warnings. However, Scalera maintained that the district court’s menti on of 
the word “interrogation” in its oral ruling indicated that the court had 
considered his contentions regarding a right to counsel and right against 
self-incrimination . 
11 The ICA additionally determined that “Scalera did not preserve an 
argument before the District Court that evidence should be suppressed because of a violation of his Miranda rights,” and therefore, he had w aived this 
argument on appeal. 
11
  
 
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
  
   
 
   
  We review a “ruling on a motion to suppress de novo  to 
determine whether the ruling was ‘right’ or ‘wrong.’” State v. 
Edwards, 96 Hawai ʻi 224, 231, 30 P .3d 238, 245 (2001) (quoting 
State v. Jenkins , 93 Hawaiʻ i  87, 100, 997 P.2d 13, 26 (2000)).  
“[F]actual determinations made by the trial court deciding 
pretrial motions in a criminal case [are] governed by the 
clearly erroneous standard,” and “conclusions of law are ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
With respect to Scalera’s argument that he was denied 
his right to counsel under HRS § 803-9, the ICA appears to have 
concluded that this statute is only implicated following an 
interrogation. The ICA relied on its opinion in State v. Won, 
134 Hawai
ʻi 59, 332 P.3d 661 (App. 2014), vacated on other 
grounds, 137 Hawai ʻi 330, 372 P.3d 1065 (2015), for the 
proposition that police inquiry into whether an OVUII suspect will submit to testing does not constitute “interrogation,” and, 
consequently, there was no violation of HRS § 803-9.  The ICA posited that even assuming there was a violation of the statute, 
Scalera was not entitled to suppression of any evidence because 
he did not (1) claim that the statutory violation had 
constitutional dimensions or (2) demonstrate by a preponderance 
of the evidence that any failure to permit him to consult with 
counsel led to his refusal to submit to testing. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
12
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 Scalera argues that the district court failed to rule 
on his motion to suppress with respect to the lawfulness of the 
traffic stop.  He further maintains that  the district court 
erred in denying his motion to suppress on the grounds that  the 
police violated  his statutory right  to counsel under  HRS § 803-
129.

reviewed under the right/wrong standard.” Id. (quoting State v. 
Eleneki, 92 Hawai ʻi 562, 564, 993 P.2d 1191, 1193 (2000)). 
III. DISCUSSION 
A.  Violation of Article I, Section 7 of the Hawai ʻi 
Constitution and Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments  to the United 
States Constitution  
Scalera initially argues that the 
district court erred 
in failing to rule on the portion of his motion to suppress 
related to article I, section 7 of the Hawai ʻi Constitution and 
the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States 
Constitution. The ICA concluded that Scalera had failed to 
properly raise the constitutional validity of the traffic stop 
12 In his application for certiorari to this court, Scalera also 
contends that he was subject to custodial interrogation requiring Miranda 
advisements. As Scalera acknowledges, his motion to suppress was not based 
upon an alleged failure to provide him with Miranda warnings, and no written 
or oral argument was made to the district court on this ground. See supra 
note 10. The district court also made no findings of fact or conclusions of 
law regarding this issue, and the court’s single reference to interrogation concerned the application of HRS § 803 -9, which was the focus of Scalera’s 
motion. Accordingly, the factual record is insufficiently developed to consider a Miranda issue under a plain error analysis . 
13
  
 
 
 
  
  Assuming, without deciding, that Scalera   raised the 
propriety of the traffic stop to the district court, Officer  
Cullen testified that he stopped Scalera because Scalera crossed 
over a solid traffic line twice and over a broken traffic line 
once. While Scalera argues that Officer Cullen’s testimony 
contained some “troubling discrepancies ,” these “discrepancies” 
did not negate Officer Cullen’s testimony that he observed 
Scalera cut across at least one of the traffic lane markings.  
Additionally, the district court in its ruling did not in any 
way indicate that it viewed Officer Cullen’s testimony as not 
credible, and appellate courts are required to “give full play 
to the right of the fact finder to determine credibility.” 
State v. Valdivia , 95 Hawaiʻ i  465, 471, 24 P.3d 661, 667 (2001) 
(quoting State v. Jenkins, 93 Hawaiʻ i 87, 99, 99 7 P .2d 13, 25  
(2000)). Thus, Scalera failed to prove by a preponderance of 
the evidence that Officer Cullen’s stop of his vehicle was 
unlawful. See  State v. Perez , 111 Hawaiʻ i 392, 395 , 141 P.3d 
1039, 1042 (2006).  Accordingly, the ICA did not err in 
determining that Scalera failed to establish that his rights 
were violated under article I, section 7 of the Hawaiʻ i  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
before the district court and that it was not plain error for 
the court to deny the motion. 
14
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
  Scalera  also maintains that the district court erred 
in denying his motion to suppress on the grounds that the police 
violated his statutory right to  access counsel under HRS § 803 -
9. He contends that HRS § 803-9 afforded him a “right to 
consult with an attorney  at any time after he was arrested for 
OVUII,” including the time prior to being questioned regarding 
whether he would submit to alcohol concentration testing.

Constitution or the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the 
United States Constitution. 
B. Violation of HRS § 803-9 
In considering the merits of Scalera’s argument, we 
analyze the rights provided by HRS § 803-9, address whether Scalera’s rights were violated, and determine the ramifications 
of a violation of HRS § 803-9 under the facts of this case. 
1. HRS § 803-9 
HRS § 803-9, entitled “Examination after arrest; 
rights of arrested person,” provides in relevant part: 
(1)
	 To deny to the person so arrested the right of 
seeing, at reasonable intervals and for a 
reasonable time at the place of the person’s 
detention, counsel or a member of the arrested 
person’s family;  
(2)
	 To unreasonably refuse or fail to make a reasonable effort, where the arrested person so requests and prepays the cost of the message, to send a telephone, 
cable, or wireless message through a police officer 
15
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
      
13                
  The text of the statute prohibits the denial of access to counsel 
and does not explicitly grant affirmative rights. See 
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
or another than the arrested person to the counsel or member of the arrested person’s family;  
(3)	 To deny to counsel (whether retained by the 
arrested person or a member of the arrested 
person's family) or to a member of the arrested 
person's family the right to see or otherwise 
communicate with the arrested person at the place of the arrested person's detention (A) at any time 
for a reasonable period for the first time after the 
arrest, and (B) thereafter at reasonable intervals 
and for a reasonable time ; 
(4)	 In case the person arrested has requested that the 
person see an attorney or member of the person’s 
family, to examine the person before the person has 
had a fair opportunity to see and consult with the 
attorney or member of the person’s family ;  
(5)	 To fail, within forty -eight hours of the arrest 
of a person on suspicion of having committed a crime, either to release or to charge the 
arrested person with a crime and take the 
arrested person before a qualified magistrate for 
examination. 
HRS § 803-9 (1993).    Thus, under HRS § 803-9, any person 
“arrested for examination” may not be denied the opportunity to  
see, send a message, or otherwise communicate with counsel or a 
member of the arrested person’s family  in accordance with the 
time, place, and manner considerations  set forth   in the  
13 statute.   Id.   “Any person violating or failing to comply” with 
 HRS § 803- 9.  However, 
this court has reiterated that HRS § 803 -9 operates to grant r

enactment, it has been  amended several times to broaden the 
protections that it provides. In 1915, the legislature amended the statute “to provide an arrested person with the right to see 
counsel.”   Id.   In 1927, the legislature  again amended the 
statute to provide an arrested person with the “right to see a 
member of his or her family and to add a new section creating a 
penalty for violation  of the statute. ”   Id.   In 1941, the 
statute was broadened  “to grant to a person arrested for 
examination the right not only of seeing but otherwise 
communicating with counsel or a member of his [or her] family.” Id. (alteration in original) (quoting H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No.

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of the statute indicated that “ arrest for examination” referred 
to an arrest generally, effectuated for the purpose of bringing 
the arrestee before a court or magistrate: 
In all cases of arrest for examination , the person making 
the same must conduct the party arrested before the court 
or magistrate empowered  to take such examination,  within 
forty–eight hours after his arrest, except in cases where a 
longer delay is absolutely necessary to meet the ends of 
justice. 
Territory of Haw.  v. Aquino, 43 Haw. 347, 369 (Haw. Terr. 1959) 
(emphasis added) (quoting Penal Code of the Kingdom of Hawai ʻi 
ch. 49, § 9 (1869)). The current version of the statute, and in 
effect at the time of Scalera’s arrest , similarly indicates that 
an “arrest for examination” occurs whenever a person is arrested “on suspicion of having committed a crime.”  See HRS § 803-9(5) 
(“It shall be unlawful in any case of arrest for examination . . 
. [t]o fail within forty-eight hours of the arrest of a person 
on suspicion of having committed a crime either to release or to 
charge the arrested person with a crime and take the arrested person before a qualified magistrate for examination .”). 
This understanding is also evidenced by the previously 
discussed legislative history of the statute, which does not 
indicate that an arrested person’s statutory right of access to 
counsel under HRS § 803-9 was intended to apply only in 
situations of interrogation. See Edwards, 96 Hawai ʻi at 233, 30 
P.3d at 247. Additionally, as stated, this court recognized in

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Edwards that HRS § 803-9 was not limited to situations of 
interrogation; rather, its protections are independent of 
Miranda
 requirements.  See id . Thus, in order to find a 
violation of HRS § 803-9, a court need not determine whether the 
defendant was under “custodial interrogation,” as it must do in 
order to find a violation of a defendant’s Miranda rights. See 
id.
 at 233-34, 30 P.3d at 247-48. The term “arrest for 
examination” accordingly does not restrict the applicability of 
HRS § 803-9 to arrestees subject to police interrogation. 
The 
State argues, however, that OVUII arrestees do not 
have a statutory right to access counsel when deciding whether to submit to alcohol concentration testing in light of this 
court’s 1975 decision in 
State v. Severino , 56 Haw. 378, 380-81, 
537 P.2d 1187, 1189 (1975). In 
Severino, a driver appealed the 
administrative revocation of his driver’s license following an 
arrest for OVUII.  Id. at 380, 537 P.2d at 1188. Prior to 
submitting to alcohol concentration testing, the driver was 
affirmatively advised that he had a Miranda right to speak with 
an attorney, and the driver refused to submit to testing until 
he could consult with counsel. Id. at 380, 537 P.2d at 1188. 
The police deemed his refusal sufficient to invoke the sanctions 
of Hawaii’s implied consent statute. Id. at 380-81, 537 P.2d at 
1188-89.  In appealing the administrative revocation, the driver 
22
  
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
   
    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
contended that he was entitled to consult with counsel prior to 
deciding whether to submit to alcohol concentration testing. 
Id. 
In 
considering the driver’s appeal , the court began 
its analysis by citing the Sixth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution and article I, section 11 of the Hawai ʻi 
Constitution and noting that these provisions afforded “an 
accused . . . the right to assistance of counsel in all criminal 
prosecutions.” Id. 
at 380, 537 P.2d at 1189 (emphasis added) 
(quotations omitted). Because a civil license revocation was 
“in the nature of administrative proceeding s” rather than a 
criminal prosecution, the court concluded that the right to 
counsel did not apply.  Id. at 380-81, 537 P.2d at 1189 
(pointing out that “[a]ctions taken under the implied consent 
law . . . are civil in nature ”). The court also concluded that 
the driver was not entitled to Miranda warnings because “ Miranda 
rights are not applicable to implied consent proceedings.” Id.  
at 381, 537 P.2d at 1189. 
The Severino 
court’s analysis of a defendant’s right 
to consult with counsel determined the constitutional right to 
an attorney with regard to a civil administrative revocation 
proceeding, and the court did not address the right to 
communicate with a lawyer under HRS § 803-9.  See id.  at 380-81, 
23

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
 
 
537 P.3d at 1189.  Therefore, the holding of Severino does not 
17 govern our analysis of HRS § 803-9.
24 
   In this case, the district court reasoned that because 
Scalera was not in an “interrogation situation,” there was no 
violation of HRS § 803-9.  The ICA, relying on its Won opinion, 
similarly concluded that “[b]ecause the refusal to submit to 
testing is nontestimonial, the police inquiry into whether an 
OVUII suspect will submit to testing does not constitute 
interrogation,” and therefore, there was no violation of HRS § 
803-9.  State v. Won , 134 Hawai ʻi 59, 332 P.3d 661 (App. 2014), 
vacated on other grounds , 137 Hawai ʻi 330, 372 P.3d 1065 (2015).  
  Both the district court and the ICA predicated the 
18statute
’s applicability upon  a non-existent requirement.   
Whether Scalera’s statements were testimonial or nontestimonial , 
or whether police interrogation did or did not occur , is not 
determinative of whether  Scalera’s statutory right to access 
                     
 17  To the extent that the ICA’s opinion in State v. Won, 134 Hawai ʻi 
59, 74, 332 P.3d 661, 676 (App. 2014), vacated on other grounds , 137 Hawai ʻi 
330, 372 P.3d 1065 (2015), ruled that Severino denied an arrestee of a 
criminal offense the statutory right to access counsel under HRS § 803 -9, it 
is overruled. 
 18 Because the protections afforded by HRS § 803 -9 do not depend on 
the occurrence of an int errogation, we need not consider the ICA’s holding in 
Won that law enforcement’s inquiry into whether an arrestee is willing to 
submit to alcohol concentration testing does not constitute interrogation 
within the meaning of Miranda with respect to a law that imposes criminal 
sanctions for a driver’s refusal to submit to testing.   See Won, 134 Hawai ʻi 
at 66-74, 332 P.3d at 668-76.  
 
 
 
    
  HRS § 803-9 “requires that, when a defendant being 
questioned by police indicates that he or she wants counsel,” 
the police “must make reasonable efforts to contact counsel.” 
State v. Ababa , 101 Hawaiʻ i 209, 2 16, 65 P.3d 156,  163 (2003)  
(analyzing HRS § 803-9(2)).   An indication of a desire to speak 
with counsel will not “rest on a semantical parsing of whether [the defendant] asked to ‘see,’ to ‘talk to,’ to ‘call,’ or to 
‘contact’ an attorney.” Id.  at 215-16, 65 P.3d at 162-63 (an 
                     
    
 
    
 
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
counsel was infringed.   As discussed, neither  police 
interrogation nor a testimonial statement  is required to trigger 
the applicability of HRS § 803-9.   Thus, following his arrest, 
Scalera was entitled to avail himself of the protections  
19  afforded by the statute.  
2. Violation of HRS § 803-9 
19 We note that , in general , HRS § 803- 9 affords access to counsel 
at a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner.  See, e.g.,  HRS § 803- 9(1) 
(arrestee may not be prohibited from seeing counsel “at reasonable intervals 
and for a reasonable time”); HRS § 803 -9(2) (an individual may not 
“unreasonably refuse” to send a message to counsel upon an arrestee’s request 
or “fail to make a reasonable effort” to do so).  HRS § 803 -9 therefore 
provides OVUII arrestees with reasonable time and opportunity to access 
counsel, and if counsel is not available within that time frame, an arrestee 
can be required to make a decision regarding testing without the advice of a 
lawyer when further delay will significantly postpone or materially interfere with alcohol concentration testing.  
See 
HRS § 803- 9; see also People v. 
Washington , 12 N.E.3d 1099, 1102 -03 (N.Y. 2014) (arrestee’s statutory right 
to access counsel may not be used to significantly postpone or unduly 
interfere with alcohol concentration testing); State v. Vietor , 261 N.W.2d 
828, 832 (Iowa 1978) (individual arrested for driving under the influence of 
an intoxicant may invoke statutory right to counsel, but the right may not be 
used to “materially interfere” with the timely administration of alcohol 
concentration testing). 
25
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
                     
   
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
invocation of the right to an attorney in response to Miranda 
warnings was “sufficiently precise to put the detectives on 
notice of their obligations under HRS § 803- 9(2)”). 
Although HRS § 803-9 contains no explicit requirement 
that arrestees be affirmatively advised of the protections it 
guarantees, law enforcement may not preempt an invocation of 
these protections by giving misleading or incorrect information 
concerning access to counsel. In construing a statute similar 
to HRS § 803-9, for example,20 the Supreme Court of Iowa in 
Didonato v. Iowa Department of   Transportation  ruled that 
although “the statute does not require an officer to tell an arrested person that he has a right to counsel,” where the 
statute is “implicated” by the circumstances of the arrest, the 
officer must give correct advisements of the rights  it provides.  
456 N.W.2d 367, 371 (Iowa 1990). In 
Didonato , an individual 
arrested under suspicion of operating a vehicle while 
intoxicated requested to call a friend prior to submitting to 
blood alcohol concentration testing. Id. at 370.  The Iowa  
statutory right to counsel, however, only provided a right to 
20 See Iowa Code § 804.20 (1987) (“Any peace officer or other person 
having custody of any person arres ted or restrained of the person’ s liberty 
for any reason whatever, shall permit that person, without unnecessary delay 
after arrival at the place of detention, to call, consult, and see a member 
of the person’s family or an attorney of the person’ s choice, or both. . . 
.”).

   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
call, consult, and see an attorney or a member of the person’s 
family, rather than a friend. Id. Although the Iowa Supreme 
Court recognized that law enforcement had no obligation to 
proactively inform the arrestee of these rights, it concluded 
that the implication of the statute by the arrestee’s request to 
speak with a friend, rather than a lawyer or family member, required the officer to correct the individual’s 
misunderstanding as to the rights the statute provided regarding the persons the arrestee could call, consult, and see. at 
371. 
Th
e Court of Appeals of New York, that state’s highest 
court, has similarly concluded that an arrestee’s failure to 
request a lawyer will not obviate law enforcement’s duty to 
correct an unknown or misapprehended circumstance relating to a 
statutory right to consult with counsel.  See  People v. 
Washington , 12 N.E.3d 1099, 1102
-03 (N.Y. 2014). In Washington, 
the defendant was arrested for driving while intoxicated, taken to the police department, and informed about her alcohol 
concentration testing options. 12 N.E.3d at 1100-01. At no 
point did the defendant request to speak with an attorney. Id.  
at 1102. In the meantime, the defendant’s family had contacted 
an attorney, who had promptly telephoned the police department 
to request to speak with the defendant.  Id. at 1101. Law 
27

  
 
 
 
     
   
 
   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
enforcement failed to communicate to the defendant that counsel 
had called for her, and she subsequently submitted to a 
breathalyzer test. Id.  In responding to the State’s appeal of 
her successful motion to suppress the breath test results, the defendant asserted that her right to counsel was violated when 
the police officers failed to advise her about the lawyer’s 
communication before the breathalyzer test was performed. Id.  
at 1103. The New York Court of Appeals agreed.  Id.   The court 
reasoned that “the statutory right to legal consultation” applies when an attorney contacts law enforcement seeking to 
speak with an arrestee, and that such contact requires the 
police to inform the arrestee of counsel’s request. Id.    
In this case, 
the evidence presented at the motion to 
suppress hearing demonstrates that the implied consent form, 
which was read to Scalera by Officer Krekel at the police 
station following his arrest, specifically advised Scalera that he was “not entitled to an attorney before [h e] submit[s] to any 
tests [sic] or tests to determine [his] alcohol and/or drug content.” As a result of the reading of the implied consent 
form, the police mistakenly indicated to Scalera that he had no 
right to request or communicate with counsel following his 
arrest and prior to deciding whether to submit to or refuse 
alcohol concentration testing.  Indeed, Officer Krekel testified

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
as to the clear meaning of the advisement: “It wouldn’t have 
mattered anyways [if Scalera had asked for an attorney] because 
the forms state that you’re not entitled to an attorney during 
the implied consent.”  
This court has not yet considered the question of 
whether HRS § 803
-9 is violated when law enforcement 
affirmatively advises an arrestee in a misleading manner that 
may preempt a request for access to counsel. While we note that 
HRS § 803-9 does not expressly require law enforcement to advise arrestees of the protections it affords, if arrestees may be 
affirmatively misinformed that they have no right to communicate 
or consult with counsel, many of the statute’s protections would 
be vitiated.  
Cf. Minneapolis Fire & Marine Ins. v. Matson Nav.  
Co.
, 44 Haw. 59, 67-68, 352 P.2d 335, 340 (1960) (rejecting 
construction of a statute that operates to “nullify[] [ the 
statute’s] beneficial purpose”). Permitting an incorrect 
advisement would also contravene the statute’s important purpose 
of “safeguard[ing], as nearly as may be, the right [s] of persons 
arrested and detained merely for examination, a process which 
has, in the past, been grossly abused. ” State v. Edwards,  96 
Hawai
ʻi 224, 233, 30 P.3d 238, 247 (2001) (first alteration in 
original) (quoting S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 440, in 1941 Senate 
Journal, at 1086). Indeed, allowing law enforcement to give 
29
  
 
 
 
  
   
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
arrestees misleading advisements regarding their right to access 
counsel under HRS § 803-9 may result in the very harm that the 
statute seeks to prevent. Id.  
Additionally, e
xcusing an incomplete or incorrect 
advisement in the context of an OVUII arrest would be 
inconsistent with our requirement that decisions with respect to 
alcohol concentration testing be knowing, intelligent, and 
accurately informed, particularly because counsel may assist the 
arrestee in deciding whether to consent to or refuse testing in 
the first place.  See 
State v. Won, 137 Hawai ʻi 330 , 350  n.38, 
372 P.3d 1065, 1085 n.38 (2015) (noting that counsel may serve 
an important function in assisting an arrested individual in 
deciding whether to consent to alcohol concentration testing). 
To conclude that a police officer’s affirmative denial of the 
statutory right to access counsel does not violate HRS § 803-9 
would sanction precisely the sort of “arbitrary, false, or 
misleading” advisement by law enforcement that we have 
repeatedly rejected in th
is jurisdiction.  See State v. Wilson
, 
92 Hawaiʻ i 45,   53-54, 987 P.2d   268, 276-77 (use of   a form  
providing “inaccurate and misleading”  information on the 
penalties for failing a blood alcohol test rendered a defendant’s consent to submit to such a test not  knowing and 
intelligent); see also Castro v. Admin.  Dir. of the Courts,  97

   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Hawaiʻi 463, 470, 40 P.3d 865, 872 (2002) (same); State v. 
Garcia, 96 Hawai ʻi 200, 29 P.3d 919 (2001) (applying Wilson 
retroactively). 
The reasoning of the Iowa Supreme Court and the Court 
of Appeals of New York is also persuasive.  See 
Didonato, 456 
N.W.2d at 371; Washington, 12 N.E.3d at 1102-03. In Didonato, 
the arrestee’s request to contact someone other than a lawyer or  
family member required the police to correct the 
misunderstanding  and advise the arrestee of his statutory rights 
with respect to who he could contact under the state’s statutory right to counsel provision. 456 N.W.2d at 371.  In Washington , 
where the arrestee was unaware that an attorney had been contacted on her behalf and wanted to speak with her, 
circumstances similarly required law enforcement to inform the 
defendant of this unknown situation  and her right to speak with 
the attorney. 12 N.E.3d at 1102-03.  These cases suggest that 
an arrestee’s known mis apprehension regarding a statutory right 
to consult with counsel or other specified person  requires law  
enforcement to remedy the incorrect or unknown information 
regarding the right.   When the arrestee’s misapprehension is 
caused by law enforcement’s affi rmative, incorrect advisement 
rather than mere silence, the requirement to correct the 
misunderstanding is all the more vital. See  Didonato, 456 
31

  
 
 
 
   
  In this case, Officer Krekel gave Scalera incorrect 
information relating to  HRS § 803-9 when, following Scalera’s 
arrest, he read from the implied consent form that Scalera was  
not entitled to an attorney before submitting to alcohol 
concentration testing.   This misleading information clearly 
implicated Scalera’s statutory right to see, send a message to, 
and otherwise communicate with counsel following an arrest for  
examination under HRS § 803-9.  See  Didonato , 456 N.W.2d at  371; 
see also Edward
s, 96 Hawaiʻ i  224, 30 P.3d 238; Ababa, 101 Hawai ʻi  
209, 65 P.3d 156.  Because this advisement was not consistent 
with the protections afforded by HRS § 803-9, and because 
neither Officer Krekel nor any other HPD officer corrected the 
erroneous information provided,  the reading of the implied 
consent form violated Scalera’s statutory right to access 
counsel under HRS § 803-9.  
  
   
 
  
  “Generally, where evidence has been obtained in 
violation of a statute, that evidence is not inadmissible per se ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
N.W.2d at 370- 71 (arrestee’s lack of knowledge due to officer’s 
silence); Washington, 12 N.E.3d at 1102-03 (same). 
3. Consequences of Violating HRS § 803-9 
Finally, we consider whether evidence introduced by 
the State at Scalera’s trial should be suppressed because of the 
statutory violation of HRS § 803-9. 
32
  
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
in a criminal proceeding unless the statutory violation has 
constitutional dimensions.” State v. Edwards , 96 Hawaiʻ i 224,  
237, 30 P.3d 238, 251 (2001)   (quoting State v. Kaeka, 3 Haw. 
App. 444, 449, 653 P.2d 96, 100 (1982)). However,  illegally 
obtained evidence is not only  suppressed in situations where the 
statutory violation has constitutional dimensions.   Id.  at 238, 
30 P.3d at 252.   Rather, in “ certain circumstances, ”  this court 
uses its supervisory authority to “appl[y ] the exclusionary rule  
to evidence obtained in violation of a statute or rule without 
requiring a constitutio nal violation.”  Id.  at 238, 30 P.3d at 
252 (citing State v. Wilson , 92 Hawaiʻ i 45, 987 P.2 d 268 (1999); 
State v. Pattioay , 78 Hawaiʻ i  455, 896 P.2d 911 (1995)).   In 
these situations, evidence will be suppressed where there is a 
“connection between the statutory violations and the evidence to 
be suppressed.” Id.  at 239, 30 P.3d at 253. This requires a 
showing by a preponderance of the evidence   that the statutory 
violation “ultimately had an adverse impact on [the defendant’s] 
substantive rights.” State v. Ababa , 101 Hawai ʻi 2 09, 217-18, 65 
P.3d 156, 164-65 (2003) (quoting Edwards, 96 Hawaiʻ i at 239, 30  
P.3d at 253). 
33

  
 
 
 
   
   
 
  
  In the seminal case of   State v. Pattioay , we used  our 
supervisory powers to suppress evidence obtained in violation of 
the Posse Comitatus Act (PCA). 78 Hawaiʻ i 455, 468 -69, 896 P.2d 
911, 924-25 (1995)  .  The PCA generally prohibits “direct 
involvement of military personnel in civilian law enforcement.”   
Id. at 460, 467, 896 P.2d at 916, 923. In contravention  of the 
PCA, undercover military personnel targeted civilians suspected 
of selling drugs and obtained the drugs as evidence against the 
civilians. Id.  at 457-58, 896 P.2d at 913-14.  In reviewing the 
defendants’ motion to suppress the evidence obtained by the military, we acknowledged that the violation was statutory, 
rather than constitutional, and that the PCA already provided 
for “serious criminal sanctions.” Id.  at 466, 896 P.2d at 922. 
Nevertheless, we concluded that there existed “compelling state 
grounds that militate[d] in favor of suppression,” including  the 
deterrence of future illegal police conduct and the avoidance of relying on illegally obtained evidence “ in the administration of 
criminal justice through the courts.”   Id.  at 468, 896 P.2d at 
924. We therefore suppressed  the evidence under the authority ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
i. Relevant Caselaw 
This court has been called upon on several occasions 
to consider the suppression of evidence when the basis of the 
underlying violation is statutory rather than constitutional.  
34
  
 
 
 
   
  In State v. Wilson ,  a defendant charged with driving 
under the influence of alcohol was given misleading and 
inaccurate advisements on the possible statutory penalty for 
taking and failing  an alcohol conce ntration test.  92 Hawaiʻ i 45,   
49-51, 987 P.2d 268 , 272-74 (1999)  .  Citing Pattioay, we 
determined that the flawed advisement   affected the defendant’s 
ability to make a knowing and intelligent decision whether to 
refuse or submit to testing, therefore  warranting suppression   of 
the results of his subsequent blood test.  Id.  at 52 n.10, 987 
P.2d at 275 n.10.  In State v. Garcia  , 96 Hawai ʻi 2 00,  207,  29 
P.3d 919, 926  (2001), we applied  Wilson  retroactively  and 
explained that   suppression was warranted  in Wilson  because the  
failure of the police to render a complete explanation of the 
penalties “taint[ed]  the arrestee driver’s decision [to submit 
to testing].”   See also Castro v.  Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 97 
Hawaiʻi 463, 469 -70, 40 P.3d 865, 871-72 (2002) (concluding that 
a deficient advisory  regarding sanctions for alcohol 
concentration testing refusal required suppression of the 
refusal in civil license revocation proceedings).  
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
of our “supervisory powers in the administration of criminal justice.” Id. at 469, 896 P.2d at 925. 
We applied the principles elucidated in Pattioay 
and 
Wilson to a violation of HRS § 803-9 in State v. Edwards, 96 
35

  
 
 
 
    
 
 
   
  
  
  
  The  Edwards  court held that the police failed to make 
a “reasonable effort” to contact the defendant’s requested 
attorney, thus violating HRS § 803-9.  Id.  at 236, 30 P.3d at 
250.  The court concluded, however, that the violation did not warrant suppression  of the incriminating statements  because  the 
circumstances were different from Pattioay  and Wilson, where 
“the defendants demonstrated a connection between the statutory violations and the evidence to be suppressed.” Id.  at 239-40, 
30 P.3d at 253-54.  The court explained that in Pattioay, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Hawaiʻi 224, 30 P.3d 238 (2001). In Edwards, the defendant was 
arrested, placed in custody at the local police station, and then taken to an interview room for questioning.  Id. 
at 226-27, 
30 P.3d at 240-41.  During the interview, the defendant 
indicated that she wanted to speak with a particular attorney. 
Id. Although p olice officers found the attorney’s phone number 
in a telephone book, calling the number repeatedly resulted in a 
“not in service” message , and the officers did not pursue 
further contact. Id. 
at 227-28, 30 P.2d at 241-42. The next 
day, while still in custody, the defendant stated that “she 
wanted to talk to the detectives already and she didn’t want a 
lawyer,” waived her right to have an attorney present during 
questioning, and gave police officers several incriminating 
statements.  Id. at 228-29, 30 P.3d at 242-43. 
36
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
  
 
   
                     
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
“undercover military police offers targeting civilians in 
violation of the PCA led to the seizure of drugs, the evidence 
to be suppressed”; similarly in  Wilson, the inaccurate warning  
of the penalties for taking and failing  an alcohol   concentration  
test, which violated the implied consent statute, “was relevant 
to the defendant’s decision to take the test.” Id.  at 239, 30 
P.3d at 253.  
In 
Edwards, however, nothing 
in the record indicated 
that the defendant’s statement s were “the result of t he police 
officers’ failure to exercise reasonable efforts to contact [the attorney].” 
Id. The defendant had not testified at the hearing 
on her motion to suppress the statements, “so it [could not] be ascertained whether the failure to call her attorney affected 
her decision to give her statements.” Id.  Thus, given the 
circumstances,
21 the defendant failed to prove by a preponderance 
of the evidence that “the statements sought to be suppressed 
resulted from the police’s failure to place [the defendant] in 
touch with counsel.” Id. at 239-40, 30 P.3d at 253-54. This 
court emphasized, however, that “ [its] holding [did] not 
21 Additionally, we considered that the defendant “voluntarily 
initiated contact” with the officers to give a statement the day after her 
arrest, and that before giving her statement, the defendant declined an 
additional opportunity offered by the police offi cers “to obtain an attorney 
or a public defender.” Id. at 239, 30 P.3d at 253. 
37
  
 
 
 
  
 
    
    
 
 
  
 
     
  
  
 
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
preclude suppression when warranted for a violation of HRS § 
803-9” and reiterated that “ [it] would not diminish the gravity” 
of such a violation. Id. at 239, 30 P.3d at 253. 
We applied the 
reasoning of  Edwards in State v. Ababa , 
101 Hawaiʻ i 209, 65 P.3d 156 (2003), in which this court found a 
violation of HRS § 803-9 and ruled that suppression of 
statements was required. The defendant in Ababa
 was arrested, 
placed in custody, and then taken to an interview room for questioning, where he invoked his right to counsel.  Id.
 
at 211, 
65 P.3d at 158. After waiting for several hours, the defendant indicated he wanted to speak with the police officers; while being escorted to the interview room, the defendant uttered an 
expletive regarding the lawyer. Id. The defendant then waived 
his right to counsel and gave several statements to the officers. 
Id. 
The defendant moved to suppress the 
statements on the 
ground that he invoked his right to counsel prior to the 
interview. Id. at 211, 65 P.3d at 158. The defendant testified 
at the hearing that he believed his invocation of the right to 
counsel in response to Miranda warnings meant that police 
officers would put him in contact with an attorney. Id. at 214, 
65 P.3d at 161. The defendant explained that when “no attorney 
showed up,” he assumed that “they weren’t gonna give [him] a 
38
  
 
 
 
    
 
 
    
  
   
                     
   
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
lawyer, so [he] decided to talk to them.” Id.   If a lawyer 
would have arrived to speak with him, the defendant testified 
that he would have sought advice on whether he should make a 
statement. Id.  
The Ababa 
court found that the police officers’ 
actions violated HRS § 803-9 because the defendant’s 
communication that “he wanted to talk to an attorney in effect 
was tantamount to a request to talk to an attorney within the 
meaning” of the statute , and the officers failed to make 
“reasonable efforts” to contact counsel .22 Id. at 215-16, 65 
P.3d at 162-63.  The court also determined that suppression was 
warranted of the statements made during the subsequent 
interview, because unlike in Edwards, “there [was] direct 
evidence that [the defendant’s] decision to waive his rights and give a statement was connected to the detectives’ failure to 
obtain an attorney.” Id. at 217, 65 P.3d at 164. In support of 
this conclusion, the court pointed to the defendant’s testimony that (1) he wanted an attorney to assist him in deciding whether 
to give a statement or not, (2) he believed the police officers 
22 The Ababa court noted that the officers had “made no attempt to 
ascertain from [the defendant] whether he knew an attorney who could be 
contacted, whether [he] could afford an attorney, whether [he] wanted the use 
of a telephone and telephone book to contact one, or whether [he] desired the 
public defender’s office be contacted.” Id. at 216, 65 P.3d at 163.

would contact an attorney for him when he said he “wanted one,” 
(3) he was not provided with a phone or other means of 
23 contacting an attorney on his own,  and (4) he decided to waive 
his right to counsel and give a statement because he believed 
the officers were not going to provide him with an attorney as 
he requested. Id.  
  
Our line of cases relating to suppression of evidence 
based on a statutory violation thus demonstrates that 
where the 
violation has no “constitutional dimensions,” evidence may be 
excluded so long as the proponent demonstrates by a 
preponderance of the evidence a “connection between the 
statutory violations and the evidence to be suppressed.” 
Edwards, 96 Hawai ʻi at 237-38, 239, 30 P.3d at 251-52, 253; see 
also Ababa, 101 Hawaiʻ i at 164, 65 P.3d at 217. 
23 When an arrestee has requested to send a message or otherwise 
communicate with counsel through the arrestee’s cellphone or other electronic 
device in the arrestee’s or law enforcement’s possession, police officers may 
permit use of the device to contact counsel to maintain compliance with HRS § 
803-9.  See, e.g., People v. Gelaj,   21 Misc. 3d 1120(A), 2008 NY Slip Op 
52105(U) (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2008) (arrestee’s statutory right to counsel violated 
where arrestee asserted he wanted to communicate with attorney whose phone 
number was in his cellphone in police custody, and wher e police officer “did 
nothing to facilitate the phone’s return to the defendant”); see also 
Edwards
, 96 Hawai ʻi at 236 n.17, 30 P.3d at 250 n.17 (noting that police 
officers “could simply have made a telephone available to [the defendant]” to 
comply with the requirements of HRS § 803 -9); Ababa, 101 Hawai ʻi at 163, 65 
P.3d at 216 (police failed to make reasonable efforts to contact counsel 
where, inter alia, the police “made no attempt to ascertain from [the 
defendant] . . . whether [he] wanted the use of a telephone” to contact an 
attorney).

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
When the statutory violation results from a misleading 
warning regarding the penalties for refusing or failing an 
alcohol concentration test, our prior decisions have determined 
that suppression will be warranted because the misleading 
information as to the penalties “ legally preclude[s] an arrestee 
from making ‘a knowing and intelligent decision [regarding] whether to consent to or refuse ’” such testing.  Garcia, 96 
Hawaiʻi at 207, 29 P.3d at 926 (quoting Wilson , 92 Hawaiʻ i at 52 
n.9, 987 P.2d at 275 n.9); see also Castro, 97 Hawaiʻ i 463, 40 
P.3d 865. However, in the context of suppression based on a violation of HRS § 803-9, the requisite “connection” is not so 
readily apparent, as the inability to see, contact, or consult with an attorney will not necessarily impact law enforcement’s 
collection of the evidence sought to be suppressed.
24 Thus, when 
suppression is sought based on a violation of HRS § 803-9, the requirement that the defendant prove by a preponderant degree 
the “connection between the statutory violation [] and the 
evidence to be suppressed ” necessitates a showing that the 
24 Compare Edwards, 96 Hawai ʻi at 239, 30 P.3d at 253 (“ it cannot be 
ascertained whether the failure to call [the defendant’s] attorney affected 
[the defendant’s] decision to give [the] statements” she subsequently sought 
to suppress), with Ababa, 101 Hawai ʻi at 217, 65 P.3d at 164 (“[Defendant] 
testified at the motion to suppress that his acquiescence in giving [the] 
statement” that he subsequently sought to suppress “was precipitated by the 
absence of an attorney ”).

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
violation of the defendant’s statutory right to access counsel 
affected the procurement of the evidence sought to be 
suppressed. Edwards, 96 Hawai ʻi at 239, 30 P.3d at 253. 
ii. Suppression Not Warranted 
Scalera seeks to suppress the implied consent form and 
his verbal statements indicating his refusal to submit to 
alcohol concentration testing.25 To warrant suppression, Scalera 
must show by a preponderance of the evidence a “connection 
between the statutory violation[] [of HRS § 803-9]” and his decision to refuse to submit to alcohol concentration testing. 
Edwards, 96 Hawai ʻi at 239, 30 P.3d at 253. 
As was the case in Edwards
, Scalera “did not testify 
at the hearing on the motion to suppress, so it cannot be 
ascertained whether [the incorrect advisement] affected [his] 
decision” to refuse to submit to testing. Id.  There is also no 
other evidence in the record of the motion hearing indicating that Scalera’s decision to refuse to submit to testing “[was] 
the result of” the incorrect adv isement of his statutory right 
to access counsel, 
id.
, or that his decision to refuse was 
25 It appears that Scalera asserted before the district court that 
the sanctions form (including its notations regarding his refusal to submit 
to testing) should be excluded from evidence at trial, though he has not 
specifically addressed the admissibility of this form on certiorari . 
42
  
 
 
 
   As stated by the Edwards  court, our conclusion should  
not be viewed  as “diminish[ing] the gravity of any violation of 
HRS § 803-9,” id., and given the complexity of  the implied 
consent and sanctions forms and the gravity of the consequences  
of submitting or refusing to submit to testing, an OVUII

“precipitated by the absence of an attorney.”  Ababa, 101 Hawai ʻi  
at 217, 65 P.3d at 164. “Without such links, it is difficult to 
conclude that [Scalera] has proven by a preponderance of the 
evidence” that the violation of HRS § 803 -9 in this case 
ultimately resulted in his decision to refuse to submit to  
testing. Edwards, 96 Hawaiʻ i  at 239, 30 P.3d at 253.  
26 It has been observed that understanding and then weighing the 
pros and cons of the various consequences and alternatives of submitting or 
refusing to submit to chemical testing “would be difficult for most people 
under the best of circumstances.” State v. Senn,  882 N.W.2d 1, 49 (Iowa 
2016) (Wiggins, J., dissenting). 
To make the right decision, an individual suspected of [operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated] must quickly 
consider not only what the State can prove and what the 
likely penalty will be, but also what the future consequences might be for his or her 
occupation, family, 
and personal wellbeing. The decision is final, and it will 
determine both the range of criminal penalties the 
individual will face and the charge that will appear on his 
or her permanent criminal record. In these respects, the decision to submit or refuse to submit to a chemical test 
resembles the decision to plead to criminal charges.

State v. Won , 137 Hawaiʻ i 330, 350  n.38, 372 P.3d 1065, 1085 n.38 
(2015) (rejecting the argument that counsel would not benefit an 
individual deciding whether to submit to alcohol concentration 
testing and reasoning that “an important function of counsel is 
to explain to a client the choices that may be presented and 
ramifications that may flow from the election of one course of 
action as opposed to another”); see also id. at 369 n.17, 372 
P.3d at 1104 n.17 (Nakayama
, J., dissenting) (agreeing that 
counsel “may be of value” to an individual deciding whether to 
submit to alcohol concentration testing). 
However, because Scalera failed to prove by a 
preponderance of the evidence a connection between the violation of HRS § 803-9 and his subsequent refusal to submit to alcohol 
concentration testing, the district court did not err in denying 
his motion to suppress, nor did the ICA err in affirming the 
district court’s ruling. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
Both the district court and the ICA in this case 
incorrectly concluded that the statutory right to access counsel 
under HRS § 803-9 is only implicated by an interrogation 
following arrest. The protections afforded by the statute do 
not depend on whether an interrogation has occurred.  Rather, an 
arrestee may not be preemptively refused the opportunity to see,

send a message, or otherwise communicate with counsel as 
provided by HRS § 803-9. The reading of the implied consent 
form in this case, which included a misleading advisement on 
Scalera’s right to access an attorney, both implicated and 
infringed on the statute.  As a result, Scalera’s statutory 
right to access counsel under HRS § 803-9 was violated.  The district court erred in concluding otherwise, and the ICA erred 
in affirming this determination. However, Scalera failed to 
meet his burden of showing that the violation of HRS § 803-9 affected his decision to refuse alcohol concentration testing.  
See Edwards, 96 Hawaiʻ i at 239, 30 P.3d at 253.  Thus, the 
district court did not err in denying Scalera’s motion to 
suppress, and the ICA did not err in affirming the  district 
court judgment.  
Based on the foregoing, the ICA’s Judgment on A ppeal 
is affirmed for the reasons set forth in this opinion.
