RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, POLLACK, AND WILSON, JJ.  
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J.  
In order to expedite the often extensive discovery 
process, Hawaiʻ i Rules of Civil Procedure ( “ HRCP”) Rule 36 allows 
a party to a lawsuit to “serve upon any other party a written 
request” for admissions.  Requesting that a party admit the 
truth of matters of fact, or of the application of law to fact, 
narrows the issues that must be proven at trial to those that  
   In this case, claims brought by pro se 
Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellant Richard A . Villaver (“Villaver”) 
were dismissed based on his alleged   failure to timely respond to  
a request for admissions —notwithstanding his request that the 
court provide him with an interpreter to help answer the 
requests.  Villaver  was denied the opportunity  to exercise the  
right to a jury trial on the basis of  his alleged failure to  
respond to a request for admissions    that asked him to concede   he 
had no claim.    Villaver  appeals from the judgment of the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”), which affirmed the order of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (“circuit court”) 
granting summary judgment against Villaver on the basis of his *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
are actually disputed, which fosters more efficient trials.  
However, because a careless or inexpert litigant might 
unintentionally admit an entire case  by failing to respond to a 
request for admissions, HRCP Rule 36(b) gives the trial court the discretion to permit the withdrawal of the admissions on the  
motion of an admitting party, so long as withdrawal will facilitate presentation of the merits and will not prejudice the 
party that obtained the admissions. Courts should exercise this 
discretion liberally in cases involving pro se litigants, which 
invoke the judicial system’s interest in “promo tion of equal 
access to justice[.]”   Waltrip v. TS Enters., Inc., 140 Hawaiʻ i

failure to timely respond to the request for admissions.  He 
argues that the ICA erred in affirming the circuit court and 
that his request for an interpreter should have been construed 
by the circuit court as a request to withdraw the admissions and 
file a late response. We agree. 
I. BACKGROUND 
On November 15, 2010, Villaver filed a complaint in 
the circuit court, alleging that on August 20, 2008, 
Respondent/Defendant-Appellee David Kawika Sylva (“Sylva”), an 
employee of Respondent/Defendant-Appellee Hawaii Mega-Cor, Inc. 
(“HMCI”), negligently drove an HMCI -owned van into Villaver’s 
sedan while it was being operated by Villaver.  Villaver alleged 
that as a result of Respondents’ negligence, “he suffered and 
continues to suffer from damages including, but not limited to, 
past and future medical and related expenses; past and future 
pain and suffering; past and future loss of enjoyment of life; 
[and] past and future serious emotional distress,” and that he 
is entitled to compensation. 
The matter proceeded through a non-binding Court 
Annexed Arbitration Program (“CAAP”) , where Villaver was 
represented by counsel.  The arbitrator found in favor of 
Villaver, and awarded him $24,245.58 in damages: $5,942.62 in 
3  
  
  B. Post-CAAP Proceedings 
   
 
 
  
  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
medical expenses, $8,302.96 of lost wages, and $20,000 in 
general damages, less $10,000 for the covered loss deductible. 
On August 31, 2012, Villaver appealed the CAAP award 
and requested a trial de novo.  On March 13, 2013, Vil laver’s 
attorney filed a motion to continue the trial and to withdraw as 
counsel. Villaver told his attorney that he would seek 
replacement legal counsel.  Respondents took no position on the 
motion, and, after a hearing on April 3, 2013, the court granted 
the first motion to continue trial and for withdrawal of 
counsel, and set May 13, 2013 as the date for the trial setting 
conference. At the trial setting conference on May 13, 2013, 
Villaver made his first pro se appearance and requested more 
time to obtain counsel. A new trial setting conference was set 
for June 20, 2013. On June 20, 2013, Villaver appeared pro se 
for the second time, and trial was set for the week of June 23, 
2014. The discovery deadline had been set as April 24, 2014, 
and the substantive motions deadline had been set as May 5, 
2014. 
Approximately nine months after Villaver’s second pro 
se appearance, on March 17, 2014, Respondents served Villaver with a request for admissions via U.S. mail.  The request 
contained seventy-seven statements.  Among those statements were 
five statements that the circuit court later relied upon to 
4  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
                     *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
grant summary judgment  to Respondents  on all claims.  The five 
statements requested that Villaver take a position contrary to 
the claims he successfully asserted before the CAAP arbitrator; 
specifically, they requested that he admit it was his negligence  
that caused the accident and that he incurred no injuries:  
16. You were reversing your car out of a parking stall at 
the time of the subject accident. 
. . . . 
18. Your negligence was the sole legal cause of the 
subject accident. 
. . . . 70. You did not sustain any injuries as a result of the 
subject accident. . . . . 76. You did not incur any general damages as a result of 
the subject accident. . . . . 
77. You did not incur any special damages as a result of 
the subject accident.
[1] 
Less than a month after Villaver received the request 
for admissions, on April 15, 2014, defense counsel received a 
letter dated April 11, 2014 from Villaver’s wife. Her letter 
explained that Villaver received the request for admissions and 
understood that the deadline to respond was April 18, but stated 
that Villaver was unable to complete the paperwork. According 
to Villaver’s wife, V illaver became very stressed and 
1  Other requests for admissions related not only to authentication 
of documents and photographs, the extent of damages to Villaver’s vehicle, 
and circumstances of the accident, but also to medical examinations, 
treatment, diagnosis, and opinions which were c learly beyond Villaver’s 
expertise.  
5  
  
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
overwhelmed when he tried to answer the questions, had a 
difficult time remembering the specifics of his treatments, and 
did not understand English well.  She explained further that 
Villaver did not have legal representation and that she could 
not help him because she was suffering from depression and 
anxiety.  She concluded her letter by explaining that they were 
returning the paperwork to defense counsel uncompleted. 
On May 1, 2014, Respondents Sylva and HMCI filed a 
motion for summary judgment.  Respondents argued that, under HRCP Rule 36(a), because Villaver did not respond to the request 
for admissions within thirty days of service of the request, the 
matters contained within the request were admitted.  HRCP Rule 
36(a) states that each matter for which an admission is 
requested “is admitted unless, within 30 days after service of 
the request, . . . the party to whom the request is directed 
serves upon the party requesting the admission a written answer 
or objection addressed to the matter, signed by the party or by the party’s attorney[.]” Based on Villaver’s admissions, 
Respondents argued that Villaver’s claims against the m failed as 
a matter of law because he could not prove the elements of his 
negligence claim.  Accordingly, Respondents requested summary 
judgment.  The letter from Villaver’s wife to defense counsel 
was attached to their motion as an exhibit.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Twenty days later, on May 21, 2014, the court held a 
hearing on Respondents’ motion for summary judgment.2 At the 
hearing, Villaver explained to the court that he could not 
respond to the request for admissions because he was losing 
memory of the event, and because he could not understand English 
well. He testified that he mostly spoke Visayan with his mother 
and Filipino in his business. He requested an interpreter to 
help him answer the questions , saying, “if you can give me one 
interpreter, that would help me for answer that question.  
Because some English I don’t really understand. . . . All I 
see, I cannot read. I cannot really understand.” The court 
noted that Villaver previously appeared in court and had not 
indicated that he had any difficulty speaking or understanding 
English; the court also elicited from Villaver that he had lived 
in Hawaiʻ i  for forty-one years and that he had attended public 
elementary, intermediate, and high 
school in Hawaiʻ i.  The court 
denied his request for an interpreter to assist him with the 
written documents.  The court also observed that its June 2013 
trial status-setting order contained various pre-trial 
deadlines, and that there had been ample time for Villaver to 
obtain new counsel or proceed pro se. 
2 The Honorable Jeannette H. Castagnetti presided. 
7  
   The court indicated to Villaver that it was inclined 
to grant the summary judgment motion on the basis of his failure 
to respond to the request for admissions:  
 
 So I’m inclined to grant the motion, as t he responses 
were not provided --  there was no response provided to the 
request for admissions. The rule requires a response.  
 
  Approximately one month after the hearing,  on June 26, 
2014, t  he court’s order was filed. In the order, the court 
explained that “[b]ecause  no written answer or objection 
addressed to the matter and signed by the Plaintiff was served 
with respect to Defendants’ Request for Admissions, Defendants’ 
Request for Admissions are therefore deemed admitted.” The court found that the following five admissions demonstrated that 
there were no genuine issues as to any material fact:  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
[THE COURT:] Mr. Villaver, so the defendants are 
requesting that this court grant summary judgment in their favor, which means finding that they were not negligent, 
not liable, and that the basis, the reason why they’re 
saying they should get judgment in their favor, along --  in 
addition to what’s been argued today, is that you did not 
respond to the requests for admissions that were sent to you; and under the rules, if you don’t respond within the 
time period, the admissions are  -- the requests are deemed 
admitted. So not responding to their requests for admissions within 30 days or by 30 days, you have now 
admitted the requests that they had put in there, in 
particular --  well, there’s a number of the
m.  I won’t go 
through them because they’re all contained in the motion. 
But, essentially, the admission being that you were 
negligent and Defendants were not.  
At the conclusion of the hearing, the court deemed the 
statements admitted, concluded that there would be no genuine 
issue of material fact for trial, and granted Respondents’  
motion for summary judgment.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(a) Plaintiff was reversing his car out of a parking 
stall at the time of the subject accident (Request for 
Admissions No. 16); 
(b) Plaintiff’s negligence was the sole l egal cause 
of the subject accident (Request for Admissions No. 18); 
(c) Plaintiff did not sustain any injuries as a 
result of the subject accident (Request for Admissions No. 70); 
(d) Plaintiff did not incur any general damages as a 
result of the subject accident (Request for Admissions No. 
76); and 
(e) Plaintiff did not incur any special damages as a 
result of the subject accident (Request for Admissions No. 
77). 
Based on these admitted facts, the court ordered that 
Respondents’ motion for summary judgment be granted.  Judgment 
was entered in favor of Respondents on June 23, 2014. This 
appeal followed. 
C. Appeal to the ICA 
On appeal, Villaver contended through retained counsel 
that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment.  He 
argued that it should have allowed him to withdraw his 
admissions under HRCP Rule 36(b). HRCP Rule 36(b) provides 
discretion to the court to permit the withdrawal of admissions 
if doing so would facilitate presentation of the merits and 
would not prejudice the party that obtained the admissions: 
[T]he court may permit withdrawal or amendment [of any 
admission] when the presentation of the merits of the 
action will be subserved thereby and the party who obtained 
the admission fails to satisfy the court that withdrawal or 
amendment will prejudice that party in maintaining his or 
her action or defense on the merits. 
9  
   
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
  The ICA affirmed the circuit court’s order granting 
summary judgment. Villaver v. Sylva, No. CAAP-14-0001086, 2017 
WL 4534435, at *4 (App. Oct 11, 2017) (SDO).   In reaching this 
decision, the ICA acknowledged that, where possible, the court should “afford[] litigants the opportunity to have their cases  
heard on the merits[.]”    Id.  at *2 (citing   Marvin v. Pflueger, 
127
 Hawaiʻ i 490,  496, 280 P.3d 88, 94 (2012)).  However, the ICA  
expressed concern that Villaver  had not followed the rules   of 
discovery while representing  himself, stating that  “pro se *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Villaver’s opening brief requested that his “inarticulate pro 
se” attempts to explain his failure to respond to the request 
for admissions and the motion for summary judgment —namely, his 
wife’s letter to defense counsel and his oral arguments about 
his faulty memory and difficulty with the English language —be 
construed as a motion to withdraw the admissions under HRCP Rule 36(b). He argued that the circuit court’s failure to consider 
his request for an interpreter as a motion to withdraw 
admissions was an abuse of its discretion, and that the circuit 
court erred in its decision to award summary judgment on the 
basis of the statements he was deemed to have admitted.  He 
contended that the court should have allowed him to withdraw his 
admissions.  He argued further that the court should have given 
him one last chance to obtain assistance of counsel and to 
answer the request for admissions with such assistance. 
10  
   
  
 
 
   
 
  
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
plaintiffs are not exempt from discovery rules.” Id. It found 
that Villaver’s wife’s letter was not a proper objection to the 
request for admissions under HRCP Rule 36(a), and that 
Villaver’s pro se in-court request for appointment of an 
interpreter was not a request to withdraw admissions.  Id. 
The ICA cited the standard enunciated in HRCP Rule 
36(b) to determine whether the circuit court properly exercised 
its discretion to allow for the withdrawal of admissions: 
[I]n exercising its discretion the court must apply the 
test set forth in Rule 36(b): (1) whether the presentation of the merits will be subserved if the withdrawal of the 
admission is permitted and (2) whether the party who 
obtained the admission can satisfy the court that 
withdrawal will prejudice him in maintaining his action or 
defense on the merits. 
Id.  at *3 (internal quotation marks and ellipses omitted)  
(quoting W.H. Shipman, Ltd. v. Hawaiian Holiday Macadamia Nut  
Co., 8 Haw. App. 354, 366  –67, 802 P.2d 1203, 1209 –10 (1990)).  
The ICA distinguished Villaver’s case from Shipman, wherein  the 
defendant was represented by counsel who  filed untimely answers 
to a request for admissions.  Id.  (citing Shipman, 8 Haw. App. 
at 366, 802 P.2d at 1209). The defendant in Shipman  
subsequently filed a motion  to amend a discovery order which the  
ICA construed to impliedly include a motion to withdraw 
statements that had been  previously  deemed admitted and to 
submit a late response.   8 Haw. App.  at 367, 820 P.2d at 1210.  
The ICA noted that in Shipman, defendant Hawaiian Holiday  had

principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a 
party litigant.” Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 
74 Haw. 85, 114, 839  P.2d 10, 26 (199  2).

“[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
belatedly answered  Shipman’s interrogatories, produce d  requested 
documents, and allowed Shipman to depose  two of its officers; 
additionally, there were two and a half months left before trial 
when it did respond.  Villaver, 2017 WL 4534435, at *3 (citing  
Shipman, 8 Haw. App. at 367, 820 P.2d at 1210).  The ICA found it significant that  at the time of his request for an 
interpreter, Villaver  had not moved   forward with discovery in 
any way, numerous discovery deadlines had passed, and there were only a few weeks left until trial.   Id. at *4.  The ICA held  
that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Respondents would have been prejudiced in 
maintaining their defense if withdrawal was permitted.   Id.  
Villaver filed an application for a writ of certiorari 
with this court, which was accepted.

depositions, answers  to interrogatories, and admissions on file,

is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ” Id.  (quoting 
Kahale v. City & Cty. Of Honolulu, 104 Hawaiʻ i 341,  344, 90 P.3d 
233, 236 (2004)).  
III.  DISCUSSION 
Although Villaver’s failure to respond to Respondents’ 
request for admissions provided a proper basis to find the 
requests admitted under HRCP Rule 36(a), his request for an 
interpreter should have been considered as a motion to withdraw his admissions under HRCP Rule 36(b). 
HRCP Rule 36(a) allows one party to serve another a 
written request for admissions.  A request for admissions must 
set forth statements of fact, of opinion, or of the application 
of law to fact, that concern issues in the case.  HRCP Rule 
36(a). The party in receipt of the request can answer or object 
to each matter for which an admission is requested.  If the 
party chooses to answer , the party must “specifically deny the 
matter or set forth in detail the reasons why the answering 
party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter.” Id. If the 
party denies a matter, the party must “fairly meet the substance 
13  
   
   
                     
   
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
of the requested admission[.]”   Id.   If the party gives lack of 
information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or 
deny a matter, the party must “state[] that the party has made 
reasonable inquiry and that the information known or readily 
obtainable by the party is insufficient to enable the party to 
admit or deny.” Id.   If the party chooses to object, it must  
state the reasons for the objection.   Id.   An answer or 
objection must be written and signed by the party or the party’s 
attorney. Id.   If the party neither answers nor objects to a 
matter within thirty days after service of the request for  
admissions, or within such shorter or longer time as the court  
allows or the parties agree to in writing, then the matter is  
admitted. Id.  
As Villaver concedes, he failed to respond to the 
request for admissions within thirty days of service as required 
by HRCP Rule 36(a).3 The letter from Villaver’s wife to defense 
counsel did not constitute an answer or objection to the request 
for admissions pursuant to HRCP Rule 36(a), and, as such, did 
not preclude the court from deeming the statements admitted 
after thirty days. In her letter, Villaver’s wife explained 
that Villaver was unable to respond to the request for 
admissions because, when he tried, he became overwhelmed, 
3 Respondents served Villaver with the request for admissions on 
March 17, 2014. Villaver’s wife sent her letter on April 11, 2014, and it 
was received by defense counsel on April 15, 2014.  The thirty day response 
deadline expired on April 16, 2014 . 
14  
  
  
  
  
 
  
 
   
  
  
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
couldn’t remember facts, or couldn’t understand the questions. 
She explained that they were returning the paperwork to defense 
counsel uncompleted. Her letter did not constitute an answer 
because it was not signed by Villaver or by an attorney 
representative, and thus did not comply with HRCP Rule 36(a). 
Furthermore, the letter could not be construed as a motion to 
withdraw admissions because the letter was sent and received 
before the statements in the request for admissions were deemed 
admitted. However, the letter was relevant to the court’s 
determination as to the degree to which Villaver sought to comply with the request for admissions, and whether his request 
for an interpreter warranted a continuance of the hearing on the 
motion for summary judgment and withdrawal of his admissions. 
Because neither Villaver nor an attorney representing 
him complied with the answer or objection requirements of HRCP 
Rule 36(a) within thirty days of service of the request, the 
statements in the request were properly deemed admitted; we therefore consider Villaver’s contention that the circuit court 
erred by failing to consider his request for an interpreter as a motion to withdraw his admissions pursuant to HRCP Rule 36(b).  
HRCP Rule 36(b) provides that the court may allow any matter 
admitted under HRCP Rule 36(a) to be withdrawn upon an 
appropriate motion: “Any matter admitted under this rule is 
15  
  
 
  Villaver’s oral request for an interpreter to help him 
answer the admissions was not a formal motion to withdraw 
admissions. But his failure to observe formalities did not 
preclude the court from permitting him to withdraw  his 
admissions, as Hawaiʻi courts have  considered untimely responses  
to a request for admissions  as constituting  an informal motion 
to withdraw admissions.  One such example is In re Trade Wind 
Tours of Hawaii, Inc., wherein the ICA   addressed the director of  
taxation’s untimely filing of answers to a request for  
admissions. 6 Haw. App. 260,  264, 718 P.2d  1122, 1125   (1986).  
The ICA held that the tax appeal court “did not abuse its 
discretion in deeming the Director’s admissions to have been 
withdrawn upon the filing of the answers.” Id.  at 264, 718 P.2d 
at 1126. Similarly, in Shipman, the ICA held that  late 
responses to a request for admissions could be considered a 
request for withdrawal of the admissions.  8 Haw. App. at 366,  
802 P.2d at 1209.  In that case,  the circuit court entered an 
order deeming admitted the  statements in the request for 
admissions served by Shipman on Hawaiian Holiday  because 
Hawaiian Holiday had not responded before the HRCP Rule 36(a) thirty-day deadline.   Id.  at 365, 802 P.2d at 1209. The court 
subsequently denied Hawaiian Holiday’s motion to amend an order *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
conclusively established unless the court on motion permits 
withdrawal or amendment of the admission. ” 
16  
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to compel discovery which provided that all matters covered by 
the request for admissions were deemed admitted.  Id.  at 358-59,   
802 P.2d at 1206.  The ICA held  that Hawaiian Holiday’s motion 
to amend the order deeming the matters in the request admitted, 
made after late service of its response to the request,  was  
“impliedly a motion to withdraw the Rule 36(a) automatic admissions.”   Id.  at 366, 802 P.2d at 1209.   The ICA held that  
“the allowance of a late filing of a response to a request for 
admissions by the court ‘is the equivalent of allowing a party to withdraw admissions made by operation of Rule 36(a).’” Id.  
(quoting Trade Wind Tours, 6 Haw. App. at 264, 718 P.2d  at  
1126);  see also  Bergemann v. United States, 820 F.2d 1117, 1121 
(10th Cir. 1987)  (finding that “both the response to [the 
plaintiff’s] motion for summary judgment and the recorded pre -
trial hearings in this case were, in essence, motions to withdraw the admissions”) ; Warren v. Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 
Chauffers, Warehousemen & Helpers of Am., 544 F.2d 334, 339 (8th 
Cir. 1976)  (“To allow a late filing of answers to a request for 
admissions is the equivalent of allowing a party to withdraw admissions made by operation of Rule 36(a).” (internal 
parentheticals omitted) (quoting Pleasant Hill Bank v. United States, 60 F.R.D. 1, 3 (W.D.  Mo. 1973))).   
17  
   In the present case, when Villaver made his request 
for an interpreter, the circumstances constituted a request to  
the court for permission to withdraw his admissions and file a 
late response to the  request for admissions.  His wife had 
indicated that he needed a lawyer to help him complete the paperwork sent to him by Respondents. Villaver requested the 
interpreter for the purpose of filing his response to the 
request for admissions:   “So if I --  if --  if I need --  if you 
can give me one interpreter, that would help me for answer that 
question.” The circuit court recognized that Villaver’s purpose 
in asking for an interpreter was in part to file a late response to the request for admissions, stating  “I’m inclined at this 
point to . . . deny . . . [Villaver’s]  request for an 
interpreter to assist him with the written documents that he’s 
received from the other side. ”  The request to file a late 
response to a request for admission was the  equivalent of a 
request to withdraw admissions.   See  Trade Wind Tours, 6 Haw. 
App. at 264, 718 P.2d at 1126.

Villaver’s status as a pro se litigant supports 
construing his request for an interpreter as a request to 
withdraw his admissions and file a late response.  In the 
context of pro se 
pleadings, we have explained that “ [a] 
fundamental tenet of Hawai ʻi law is that ‘[p]leadings prepared by 
pro se litigants should be interpreted liberally

the Two Factors of Rule 36(b) to Villaver’s Informal Motion to 
Withdraw Admissions and File a Late Response.

“[t]he underpinnings of this tenet rest on the promotion of 
equal access to justice[.]” Waltrip, 140 Hawaiʻ i  at  239, 398 
P.3d at 828 (quoting  Dupree v. Hiraga
, 121 Hawaiʻ i 297, 314, 219 
P.3d 1084, 1101 (2009)).   In Waltrip, we favorably noted that 
“[f]ederal courts have extended this ‘liberality doctrine’ to 
include pro se motions in certain scenarios[,]” and held that 
liberal construction of motions was appropriate in workers’ 
compensation cases, as they typically provide “the only recovery 
available for an employee who is injured at work[.]” Id.   
Similarly, Villaver’s pro se request for an interpreter at the 
hearing should have been interpreted liberally as a request to  
withdraw his admissions and file a late response, particularly since a more restrictive interpretation would have extinguished  
his only opportunity to recover on his negligence claim.  
To determine whether to permit Villaver to withdraw 
his admissions, the 
circuit court was required to consider the 
two factors enumerated in HRCP Rule 36(b): “(1) whether ‘the 
presentation of the merits will be subserved ’ if the withdrawal 
of the admission is permitted and (2) whether the party who obtained the admission can ‘satisfy the court that withdrawal 
. . . will prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense on the merits.’” Shipman, 8 Haw. App. at 367, 802 P.2d at 1209 –10 
19  
   
 
  The circuit court in the present case did not consider 
either of the two HRCP Rule 36(b) factors.  With respect  to the  
first factor, the court was required to consider  whether 
“upholding the admissions would practically eliminate any 
presentation of the merits of the case.” Conlon v. United 
States, 474 F.3d 616, 622 (9th Cir. 2007) (quoting Hadley v.  
United States, 45 F.3d 1345, 1348 (9th Cir. 1995)).  Thus, the 
first factor weighed in favor of permitting Villaver to withdraw  
his admissions; otherwise,  the admissions necessarily required  
the court to grant summary judgment and preclude  d a trial on the  
merits. Denial of the request to withdraw admissions did not subserve the presentation of the merits.   
  
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
(quoting HRCP Rule 36(b)). When both factors are met —that is, 
when withdrawal would promote presentation of the merits but would not prejudice the party that obtained the admissions —the 
court may permit withdrawal. 
The circuit court also did not consider the second 
factor, whether withdrawal would prejudice the party that obtained the admission. Prejudice under HRCP Rule 36(b) does 
not contemplate the prejudice that the party who obtained the 
admissions will incur merely because the admissions are no 
longer deemed admitted; such a standard would render the 
withdrawal of admissions nearly impossible.  Instead, prejudice 
in this context deals with the difficulty to the party who 
20  
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
                     
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
obtained the admissions from proving its case once the  
admissions are withdrawn  :  
The prejudice contemplated by the Rule is not simply that 
the party who initially obtained the admission will now 
have to convince the fact finder of its truth. Rather, it relates to the difficulty a party may face in proving its 
case, e.g., caused by the unavailability of key witnesses, 
because of the sudden need to obtain evidence with respect 
to the questions previously answered by the admissions. 
Perez v. Miami-Dade Cty., 297 F.3d 1255, 1266 (11th Cir. 2002)  
(quoting Smith v. First Nat. Bank of Atlanta, 837 F.2d 1575, 
1578 (11th Cir. 1988)); see also Conlon   , 474 F.3d at 624 (“[W] e 
are reluctant to conclude that a lack of discovery, without 
more, constitutes prejudice.   The district court could have 
reopened the discovery period . . . and prejudice must relate to 
the difficulty a party may face in proving its case at 
trial[.]”). Thus, the party that has obtained the admissions  
must show that withdrawal of the  admissions will impact its  
ability to prove the facts previously admitted.  
Here, the circuit court did not address, nor did it 
ask the parties to address, whether allowing Villaver’s 
withdrawal would unfairly prejudice Respondents.4 Thus, 
Respondents, “the part [ies] who obtained the admissions[,] 
fail[ed] to satisfy the court that withdrawal or amendment 
[would] prejudice that party in maintaining his or her action or 
4 The court did emphasize that it would not postpone the trial 
further, particularly given that Villaver knew about the trial deadlines.  
However, the court did not consider how the expiration of the trial deadlines 
in conjunction with allowing Villaver to file a late response would prejudice 
Respondents.

   The circumstances of this case exemplify a disfavored 
use of HRCP Rule 36, one in which proponents submit a request 
for admissions  “with the wild-eyed hope that the other side will  
fail to answer and therefore admit essential elements ” of his 
case. Perez, 297 F.3d at 1268;   see also  Bergemann, 820 F.2d at  
1121;  cf. Cty. of  Hawaiʻ i v. Ala Loop Homeowners, 123 Hawaiʻ i  
391, 423, 235 P.3d 1103, 1135 (2010)  (“Defaults are generally 
                     
  
   
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
defense on the merits.” HR CP Rule 36(b).   The record does not 
indicate that Respondents would have suffered prejudice to  their 
case if the admissions were permitted to be withdrawn; to the 
contrary, it indicates they had adequate opportunity to, and 
did, develop their case without the aid of the admissions, and 
that withdrawal of the admissions would not have created a need 
for new evidence otherwise addressed by the admissions.  
Respondents were clearly  on notice throughout the case regarding 
Villaver’s allegations of negligence and the damages he claim ed  
to have suffered. Those allegations were addressed in  the CAAP   
process.   Respondents conducted over a year and a half of  
discovery well before the statements in the request for 
admissions were deemed admitted.  5
5 The record indicates that by April 2014, Respondents had 
identified at least thirty -five lay witnesses and eighteen expert witnesses 
they intended to call to testify at trial, and had served subpoenas duces 
tecum to State Farm Insurance Companies, Workstar Injury Recovery Center, and 
Claudette H. Ozoa, Ph.D. The request for admissions itself indicates that 
Respondents had developed various theories under which they would avoid 
liability to Villaver.

disfavored.”), abrogated   on other grounds  by Tax Found.   of 
Hawaiʻ i v. State , No. SCAP-16-0000462, 2019 WL 1292286 (Haw. Mar. 
21, 2019).   
The circuit court should have considered Villaver’s 
informal motion to withdraw his admissions under the two factors 
of HRCP Rule 36(b)   relating to presentation of the merits and 
prejudice to the non-admitting party, both of which favored withdrawal. In failing to grant the motion, the court  abused 
its discretion.  
IV.  CONCLUSION 
Villaver’s pro se request to obtain an interpreter 
before the court entered summary judgment against him should 
have been considered a motion to withdraw his admissions and 
continue the hearing on the motion for summary judgment. 
The 
court’s discretion in ruling on the motion to withdraw admissions under HRCP Rule 36(b) was bound by the requirement 
that it consider whether the merits of the case would be served 
by withdrawal and whether the party obtaining the admissions 
would be prejudiced by the withdrawal.  It was an abuse of 
discretion to deny withdraw al of Villaver’s admissions . Absent 
the admissions, the record contains genuine issues of material 
fact that preclude summary judgment against Villaver. 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the ICA’s 
November 22, 2017 judgment on appeal and the circuit court’s 
June 26, 2014 order granting summary judgment and July 28, 2014
