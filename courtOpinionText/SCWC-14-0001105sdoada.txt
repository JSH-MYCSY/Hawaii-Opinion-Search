SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)  
 
  Petitioner/Defendant -Appellant James McDaniel 
challenges the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ ( “ICA”) order 
dismissing his appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.    
  On October 16, 2013, McDaniel was charged by felony 
information in the Circuit Court of th e Second Circuit ( “circuit 
court”) with three counts of theft in the second degree.   
McDaniel pleaded no contest to count one in exchange for the 
State’s agreement to dismiss counts two and three.   McDaniel was 
represented by court -appointed counsel Cary V irtue.  On June 18, 
2014, the circuit court entered a judgment of conviction and 
probation sentence adjudging McDaniel guilty of  one count of Supreme Court

 theft in the second degree.1  McDaniel was sentenced to four 
years of probation with special conditions, including one day of 
imprisonment, restitution, and community service.    
  On September 5 , 2014, McDaniel, pro se, filed a notice 
of appeal from the judgment of conviction and probation 
sentence, along with an ex parte motion for extension of tim e to 
file the notice of appeal, w hich the circuit court granted .  The 
State contested jurisdiction, arguing that McDaniel ’s appeal was 
untimely under Hawai i Rules of Appellate Procedure (“HRAP”) Rule 
4(b) (2012).  On March 16, 2015, pursuant to an order to show 
cause issued by the ICA directing Virtue to respond, Virtue 
filed a declaration, stating inter alia that he received a copy 
of the judgment and sentence, that McDaniel did not ask him to 
file an appeal, and  that McDaniel never called, wrote, or 
communicated a desire to appeal the sentence.  Following a 
temporary remand to the circuit court requested by Virtue to 
hear and determine a motion for withdrawal and substitution of 
counsel,2 the ICA entered an order  dismissing the appeal without 
prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.  The ICA determined that 
McDaniel’s appeal, which was filed outside of the required 
                     
 1 The Honorable Rhonda I. L. Loo presided.   
 2 On remand, Virtue filed a motion to withdraw as counsel and 
to appoint appellate counsel, which the circuit court granted.  The 
court subsequently appointed Matthew Kohm to represent McDaniel on 
appeal.   **  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORT AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  **

 thirty-day period, did not fall within a recognized exception to 
the general requirement that the notice of appeal be timely 
filed.  The ICA reasoned that McDaniel did not request that 
counsel bring an appeal on his behalf, adding that McDaniel 
“failed to even allege he communicated his desire to appeal to 
counsel. . . .”   
  In his application, McDaniel pres ents one question for 
review: whether an untimely appeal should be excused where the 
record indicates that court -appointed counsel  failed to counsel 
an indigent defendant about his right to appeal or communicate 
with the defendant after receiving a filed c opy of the judgment 
of conviction.     
  While HRAP Rule 4(b) provides that a notice of appeal 
in a criminal case “shall be filed within 30 days after entry of 
the judgment or order appealed from” or within a timely extended 
thirty-day period, “courts may permit an untimely appeal when 
‘defense counsel has inexcusably or ineffectively failed to 
pursue a defendant’s appeal from a criminal conviction ’” in the 
first instance.  Maddox v. State , 141 Hawaii 196, 205, 407 P.3d 
152, 161 (2017) (quoting State v. Knight , 80 Hawaii 318, 323, 
909 P.2d 1133, 1138 (1996)).  In Maddox , we stated that defense 
counsel in a criminal case has a duty “to consult with a 
defendant following a final order or judgment to determine **  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORT AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  **

 whether the defendant wishes to appeal, as well  as a duty to 
diligently fulfill the procedural requirements of appeal if the 
defendant elects to appeal. ”  141 Hawai ʻi at 203, 407 P.3d at 
159.  Pursuant to Maddox, although McDaniel’s appeal was not 
filed within the prescribed time period,  the record does not 
demonstrate that Virtue consulted with McDaniel to determine 
whether McDaniel wished to appeal.  Inasmuch as  McDaniel  “is 
entitled, on his first appeal, to court-appointed  counsel who 
may not deprive him of his appeal  by electing to fo rego 
compliance with procedural rules ,” id. (emphasis omitted) 
(quoting State v. Erwin , 57 Haw. 268, 270, 554 P.2d 236, 238 
(2976)), the ICA has jurisdiction to consider McDaniel’s appeal.   
  IT IS HEREBY ORDER ED that the ICA’s September 29, 2017 
order dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction is vacated, 
and the case is remanded to the ICA for further proceedings .
