2 conviction petition raises colorable claims  for relief when the 
petitioner alleges that his stated desire to appeal the order 
dismissing his case without prejudice was not effectuated by his 
trial counsel and further alleges that his counsel wholly 
abandoned him following the court’s oral ruling of dismissal.  
Under the circumstances of this case, we hold that the 
petitioner has raised colorable claims for post -conviction 
relief based upon grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel 
and abandonment of representation by defense counsel.  
I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings in the 2007 Case 
  On March 19, 2007, the State filed an indictment 
charging Mickey A. Maddox with attempted escape in the second 
degree and promoting prison contraband in the first degree (2007 
case).  Maddox was arraigned several months later on July 31, 
2007 in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (circuit court), 
and he entered a plea of not guilty to both charges.  The trial 
was delayed almost two years due to multiple motions to continue 
trial and motions to withdraw and substitute counsel.  During 
much of this time, Maddox waived his rights to a speedy trial 
under the state and federal constitutions and Hawaii Rules of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
3 1Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 48.   On December 23, 2008, the 
circuit court granted Maddox’s  motion to substitute defense 
counsel, issuing an order that appointed “legal counsel for the 
Defendant at all stages of proceedings, including appeal, if 
any,” pursuant to Hawaii Rev ised Statutes (HRS) § 802
-5(a) 
2(2010).   On April 8, 2009, Maddox’s  counsel (hereafter “trial 
counsel”) filed a motion to dismiss the indictment asserting 
violation of Maddox’s right to a speedy trial under the federal 
3and state constitutions and HRPP Rule 48.   A hearing was held on 
4the motion to dismiss on May 14- 15, 2009.   The circuit court 
found that after taking into account excluded periods, trial was 
scheduled to commence 200 days after indictment.  The court 
                     
 1 HRPP Rule 48(b)  (2000) provides in relevant part  as follows : 
Except in the case of traffic offenses that are not 
punishable by imprisonment, the court shall, on motion of 
the defendant, dismiss the charge, with or without 
prejudice in its discretion, if trial is not commenced 
within 6 months.  
 2 HRS § 802 -5(a) states in relevant part as follows: 
[W]hen it shall appear to a judge that a person requesting 
the appointment of counsel satisfies the requirements of 
this chapter, the judge shall appoint counsel to represent 
the person at all stages of the proceedings, including 
appeal, if any.  If conflicting interests exist, or if the 
interests of justice require, the court may appoint private 
counsel[.]  
 3 The motion to dismiss, although filed by trial counsel, was a 
handwritten document prepared by Maddox.  The motion also raised other  
grounds not relevant to this appeal.   
 4 The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided over the circuit court 
proceedings related to the 2007 case.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
4 concluded that this delay violated HRPP Rule 48, and after 
applying the factors set forth in State v. Estencion , 63 Hawai i 
5264, 269, 625 P.2d 1040, 1044 (1981),  the court orally ruled 
that the indictment should be dismissed without prejudice.   
  On May 29, 2009, two weeks after the 2007 case’s oral 
dismissal, Maddox was re- indicted on charges identical to those 
that had been dismissed (2009 case).  That same day, Maddox 
6filed a pro-se “Second Notice of Appeal” of the 2007 case ,  along 
with a “Motion for New Counsel” and a “Motion for Assi stance of 
Counsel on Appeal.”  In the motions, Maddox informed the circuit 
court that he intended to appeal the order dismissing the 2007 
case without prejudice and asked for new counsel because he was 
claiming ineffective assistance of counsel against his trial 
counsel in the 2007 case.  Maddox subsequently withdrew the 
notice of appeal on June 3, 2009, because he had moved to 
dismiss the 2009 case with prejudice the day before.   Maddox 
                     
 5 The court, relying on Estencion , stated “in determining whether 
to dismiss a case with or without prejudice,  the court shall consider, among 
others, each of the following factors: the seriousness of the offense, the 
facts and the circumstances of the case that led to the dismissal, and the 
impact of a reprosecution on the administration of HRPP, Rule 48, and the  
administration of justice.”   
 6 In his “Second Notice of Appeal,” Maddox stated that the “[f]irst 
notice of appeal was given orally at [the] hearing on May 15, 2009 by the 
Defendant- Appellant[.]”  A transcript of the May 15 , 2009 proceeding was not 
included in the record on appeal, and the electronic record  of the transcript 
appears to have been corrupted.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
5 explained that his appeal would be moot if the circuit court 
granted his motion.  Later, on June 9, 2009, Maddox filed a pro-
se “Third Notice of Appeal,” again informing the court that he 
7was appealing the dismissal without prejudice of the 2007 case.    
  The record does not reflect a motion by trial counsel 
to withdraw, nor does the record indicate that trial counsel 
continued to act as counsel for Maddox after the May 15, 2009 
hearing.  Other than trial counsel’s motion  for compensation in 
excess of the statutory maximum for court-appointed counsel 
under HRS § 802-5, filed
 July 15, 2009, all subsequent filings 
pertaining to the 2007 case were handwritten, pro se submissions 
8by Maddox.    
  On August 25, 2009, the Intermediate Court of Appeals 
(ICA) dismissed Maddox’s appeal of the 2007 case for lack of 
appellate jurisdiction .  In its order of dismissal, the ICA 
stated, “[f]or reasons that are not clear, the circuit court has 
not yet entered a written order o f dismissal without prejudice.”   
                     
 7 The record does not show that the circuit court ever ruled on the 
pro se motions for new counsel and assistance of counsel on appeal.  
 8 In addition to Maddox’s “Motion for New Counsel,” “Motion for 
Assistance of Counsel on Appeal,” and “̔Second’ Notice of Appeal,” filed on 
May 29, 2009, Maddox’s other pro  se filings included the following: 
“Temporary Withdrawal of Notice of  Appeal”; “(Third) Notice of Appeal” ; 
“Motion to Dismiss”; “Addendum to Motion to Dismiss”; “Affidavit i n Support 
of Motion to Dismiss” ; and “Motion to Release and Discharge from Custody; 
Dismiss With Prejudice .” ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
6 The ICA concluded that even if an order had been entered, it 
would not be appealable under HRS § 641-11 (2010) because no 
9sentence had been imposed.   On January 7, 2010, almost eight 
months after the 2007 case was orally dismissed, the circuit 
court entered its order dismissing the 2007 case without 
10prejudice based on the HRPP Rule 48 violation.    
B. Circuit Court Proceedings in the 2009 Case 
  As stated, Maddox was re- indicted in 2009 on the same 
charges dismissed in the 2007 case.  The Office of the Public 
Defender, which was initially appointed to represent  Maddox in 
the 2009 case, made a motion to withdraw as counsel.  At the 
scheduled arraignment on June 4, 2009, the circuit court also 
heard the motion to withdraw as counsel, and the court asked 
Maddox if trial counsel in the 2007 case was still representing 
                     
 9 HRS § 641 -11 provides  the following:  
Any party aggrieved by the judgment of a circuit court in a 
criminal matter may appeal to the intermediate appellate 
court, subject to chapter 602, in the manner and within the 
time provided by the rules of court.  The sentence of the 
court in a criminal case  shall be the judgment.  All 
appeals shall be filed with the clerk of the supreme court 
and shall be subject to one filing fee.  
 10 In its January 7, 2010 order dismissing the 2007 case without 
prejudice, the circuit court stated in a footnote that the court had 
instructed the State to prepare an appropriate order  at the time of the oral 
ruling on May 15, 2009 , but no proposed order was ever submitted despite 
follow-up requests from the court staff.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
7 11him.   Maddox replied that he would be claiming ineffective 
assistance of counsel because he had to “put in all [his] own 
motions before,” asserting also that trial counse l had lied to 
him.  Subsequently, on June 28, 2010, pursuant to a plea 
agreement with the State, Maddox entered no contest pleas to 
both counts in the 2009 case and to a separate charge of 
terroristic threatening in the second degree.  The cases 
referenced in the plea agreement form are the 2009 case and the 
charge of terroristic threatening.  The plea agreement and plea 
form did not reference the 2007 case.   
  C onsistent with the plea agreement, Maddox was 
sentenced on August 27, 2010, to probation for five years in the 
2009 case and one year probation for the terroristic threatening 
offense, terms to be served concurrently.  Maddox was later 
arrested for probation violations.  At a probation revocation 
hearing on February 19, 2013, Maddox agreed to a second plea 
agreement in the 2009 case, in which he admitted to violating 
the terms and conditions of his probation and entered no contest 
pleas in two other unrelated cases that were pending.  Pursuant 
to the second plea agreement,  Maddox was sentenced to concurrent 
terms of imprisonment of ten years and five years in the 2009 
                     
 11 The Honorable Richard T. Bissen, Jr.,  presided over the 
proceedings related to the 2009 case.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
8 case and  concurrent one-year prison terms for the unrelated 
offenses.   
C. Rule 40 Petition 
  On April 26, 2013, Maddox filed a Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief pursuant to HRPP Rule 40 (Petition) in which 
12he set forth thirteen grounds for  relief.   In the Petition, 
Maddox asserts, inter alia, that he was denied effective counsel 
on appeal in the 2007 case and that his trial attorney had 
“abandoned all representation of his client and left him without 
any representation,” despite Maddox being ordered to remain in 
custody.  In particular, Maddox states  that he gave oral notice 
of appeal following the circuit court’s oral dismissal of the 
132007 case on May 15, 2009.   Maddox also asserts  in his Petition 
that after the hearing but while still in court, his trial 
counsel told him that “he could not represent [him] on appeal[], 
nor could he represent him in any manner since the case had been 
dismissed and his representation terminated at that time.”   
  On August 21, 2014, the circuit court entered its 
order denying the Petition without a hearing (Order Denying 
                     
 12 Maddox’s Petition reference s, in its caption and content, both 
the 2007 and 2009 cases.  
 13 As stated, the record contains no hearing transcript for May 15, 
2009.  See supra note 6. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
9 Petition).  The court concluded that the grounds for relief were 
previously ruled upon in the 2009 case,  and that the substance 
of the issues were also raised by Maddox prior to his entering 
into a plea agreement with the prosecution in the 2009 case.  
The court further found that “[a]lthough several attorneys have 
withdrawn as counsel for Petitioner in [the 2007 and 2009 
cases], Petitioner has been represented by counsel throughout 
the proceedings in said cases.”  Because there was still a 
hearing pending in the 2009 case related to a motion for 
reconsideration of sentencing regarding credit for time served, 
the circuit court denied the Petition without prejudice.   
D. Appellate Proceedings 
  On September 8, 2014, Maddox filed a notice of a ppeal 
from the circuit court’s denial of the Petition, asserting 
14thirteen questions on appeal and seventeen statements of error.   
On March 31, 2016, the ICA entered its Summary Disposition Order 
in which it affirmed the circuit court’s O rder Denying 
15Petition.   The ICA in its ruling did not address Maddox’s 
claims individually, stating that upon “a thorough review of the 
                     
 14 In its Summa ry Disposition Order affirming the circuit court’s 
denial of Maddox’s  Petition, the Intermediate Court of Appeals rephrased 
Maddox’s thirteen “Questions on Appeal” and seventeen “Statements of Error” 
in a combined  and renumbered list of  thirty points of error.   
 15 The ICA’s Summary Disposition Order  can be found at Maddox v.  
State, No. CAAP –14–0001108, 2016 WL 1600699 (Haw. App. Mar. 31, 2016).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
10 record, which include[d] the records in [the 2007 case] and [the 
2009 case],” post-conviction relief was not available to Maddox 
because all the claims for relief raised by Maddox in his 
Petition “have been previously ruled upon or have been waived.”   
  Maddox filed a pro se application for a writ of 
certiorari setting forth fourteen questions for review.  Maddox 
asserts that he was “wrongfully denied initial appeal” in the 
2007 case, and that he was denied his right to counsel on appeal 
16as he was abandoned by trial counsel.   These claims for relief 
are encompassed by ground G of Maddox’s Petition, which asserts 
that trial counsel “failed in his duty of representing his 
client” and “abandoned all representation of his client and left  
17him without any representation. ”  We address the asserted 
                     
 16 The other thirteen questions presented by Maddox on certiorari 
are addressed  infra, note 34. 
 17 Among the  points of error  identified by the ICA that Maddox 
raised in his appeal  were the following :  
 
(2)  Maddox was entitled to assistance of counsel on his 
appeal in [the 2007 case]; 
 
(3)  the circuit court committed structural error in not 
providing Maddox with assistance of counsel on his appeal 
in [the 2007 case];  
 
(7)  Maddox’s  attorney was ineffective;  
 
(12)  Maddox was entitled to assistance of counsel until 
the termination of [the 2007 case];  
 
(21)  Maddox’s counsel was ineffective, committed illegal 
acts and lied to Maddox in violation of the Sixth Amendment 
 
(continued . . .)  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
11 claims as follows : (1) Maddox did not receive effective 
assistance of counsel following  the court’s oral dismissal 
without prejudice of the 2007 case; and (2) Maddox was abandoned 
by trial counsel prior to the termination of the 2007 case. 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
  W hether the “trial court erred in denying a Rule 40 
petition without a hearing based on no showing of a colorable 
claim is reviewed de novo; thus, the right/wrong standard of 
review is applicable.”  Dan v. State, 76 Hawai ʻi 423, 427, 879 
P.2d 528, 532 (1994) (holding t hat to determine whether a Rule 
40 petition raises a colorable claim, “the appellate court steps 
into the trial court ’s position, reviews the same trial record, 
and redecides the issue”).  
III. DISCUSSION 
  HRPP Rule 40(f) (2006) provides that a court must 
grant an evidentiary hearing on a petition for post- conviction 
relief if a petitioner “alleges facts that if proven would 
entitle the petitioner to relief. ”  Thus, in reviewing on appeal 
the denial of a Rule 40 petition without a hearing, the question 
is whether the record indicates that the petitioner  made “a 
                                                                  
(. . . continued) 
 
of the United States Constitution  and Article I, section 14 
of the Hawai i Constitution[.]  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
12 showing of a colorable claim as to require a hearing before the 
lower court.”  Dan v. State , 76 Hawai i 423, 427, 879 P.2d 528, 
532 (1994). 
  Accordingly, we evaluate Maddox’s claims to determine 
whether they present a colorable claim for post- conviction 
relief such that a Rule 40 hearing was required.  We first 
address Maddox’s contention that he did not receive effective 
assistance of counsel with regard to the appeal of the 2007 
case.  Next, we consider Maddox’s claim that he was entitled to 
assistance of counsel until his case was terminated. 
A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel on Appeal 
  Article I, section 14 of the Hawai i Constitution 
guarantees a defendant in a criminal prosecuti on the right “to 
have the assistance of counsel for the accused ’s defense.”  Haw. 
Const. art. I, § 14.  This court regards a defendant’s 
constitutional right to the assistance of counsel as a 
“fundamental component” of our criminal justice system.  State 
v. Smith, 68 Haw. 304, 309, 712 P.2d 496, 499 (1986).  It is 
well settled that “[t]he constitutional right to the assistance 
of counsel in a criminal case is satisfied only when such 
assistance is ‘effective. ’”  State v. Kahalewai , 54 Haw. 28, 30, 
501 P.2d 977, 979 (1972); accord  State v. Tetu , 139 Hawaii 207, ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
13 215, 386 P.3d 844, 852 (2016); State v. Pacheco , 96 Hawai i 83, 
93, 26 P.3d 572, 582 (2001). 
  This court set forth the standard by which we evaluate 
claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under the Hawai i 
Constitution in State v. Antone , 62 Haw. 346, 348-49, 615 P.2d 
101, 104 (1980).  “General claims of ineffectiveness are 
insufficient ” to establish that the assistance a defendant 
received was constitutionally ineffective.  Dan, 76 Hawai i at 
427, 879 P.2d at 532 (quoting Briones v. State , 74 Haw. 442, 
462-63, 848 P.2d 966, 976 (1993)).   Rather, a defendant must 
show: (1) “specific errors or omissions of defense counsel 
reflecting counsel’s lack of skill, judgment[,] or diligence”; 
and that (2) “those errors or omissions resulted in the 
withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially 
meritorious defense.”  Antone, 62 Haw. at 348-49, 615 P.2d at 
104 (internal citations omitted).  Thus, to be entitled to a 
Rule 40 hearing on the basis of ineffective assistance of 
counsel, Maddox must first allege facts identifying a specific 
error or wrongful omission made by his counsel. 
  Maddox asserts that, notwithstanding his repeated 
communications to trial counsel regarding his desire to appeal, 
trial counsel  informed Maddox at the May 14- 15 hearing that 
counsel’s  representation of Maddox terminated when  the court ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
14 orally dismissed the 2007 case  without prejudice.   However, our 
statutes, precedents, and court rules, as well as widely 
accepted legal standards, all make clear that trial counsel had 
an ongoing obligation to Maddox that included pursuing an appeal 
if Maddox chose this course
. 
  Hawai i statutorily guarantees every defendant in a 
criminal case aggrieved by a circuit court judgment or final 
order the right to appeal.  HRS § 641 –11 (2016); State v. Nicol , 
140 Hawai i 482, 491, 403 P.3d 259, 266 (2017).  When such an 
appeal of right exists, the equal protection and due process 
clauses of the Hawai i and United States Constitutions grant the 
defendant a right to effective counsel during the appeal.  
Briones, 74 Haw. at 460, 848 P.2d at 975; Douglas v. California , 
372 U.S. 353 (1963).  This ongoing right to counsel is reflected 
in Hawai i statutory law, which is  unambiguous regarding the 
extent of a court- appointed counsel’s responsibility to an 
indigent client: ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
15 [W]hen it shall appear to a judge that a person requesting 
the appointment of counsel satisfies the requirements of 
this chapter, the judge shall appoint counsel to represent 
the person at all stages of the proceedings, including 
appeal, if any .  If conflicting interests exist, or if the 
interests of justice require, the court may appoint private 
counsel[.]  
18HRS § 802-5(a) (2010) (emphasis added).
 
  The right to counsel on appeal encompasses not only 
the appeal itself, but also the procedural steps necessary to 
bring about the appeal.  “An indigent criminal defendant is 
entitled, on his first appeal, to court-appointed counsel who 
may not deprive him of his appeal  by electing to forego 
compliance with procedural rules.”   State v. Erwin , 57 Haw. 268, 
270, 554 P.2d 236, 238 (1976) (emphasis added) (citing 
Entsminger v. Iowa , 386 U.S. 748 (1966)).  “It has been said 
that failure by appointed counsel to ‘commence the simple steps 
for appeal is a blatant denial of due process .’”  Id. (quoting 
Blanchard v. Brewer , 429 F.2d 89, 90 (8th Cir. 1970)). 
  HRS § 802- 5(a) therefore imposes a duty on court-
appointed counsel to consult with a defendant following a final 
order or judgment to determine whether the defendant wishes to 
appeal, as well as a duty to diligently fulfill the procedural 
requirements of appeal if the defendant elects to appeal.  These 
                     
 18 The circuit court’s order appointing trial counsel to represent 
Maddox in the 2007 case was equally clear as to the extent of trial counsel’s 
responsibility to Maddox: “IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that [trial counsel] is 
appointed legal counsel for the Defendant  at all stages of proceedings, 
including appeal, if any .”  (Emphasis added .)   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
16 principles are also reflected in the American Bar Association 
(ABA) Standards, which we have often looked to for “guidance” 
regarding the duties of officers of the court
, including for 
“determining which decisions must be made by the defendant and 
which decisions are the province of counsel.”   State v. Richie, 
88 Hawaiʻ19i 19, 39, 960 P.2d 1227,  1247 (1998).   The ABA 
Standards state that  
defense counsel should explain to the defendant the meaning 
and consequences of the court ’s judgment and defendant ’s 
right of appeal.  Defense counsel should give the defendant 
his or her professional judgment as to whether  there are 
meritorious grounds for appeal and as to the probable 
results of an appeal.  Defense counsel should also explain 
to the defendant the advantages and disadvantages of an 
appeal.  
ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: Prosecution and Defense 
Function, Standard 4-8 .2(a) (3d ed. 1993) [hereinafter ABA 
Defense Function Standards].  The duty of defense counsel in a 
criminal case to explain to the defendant the meaning and 
consequences of the court’s judgment and the client’s right to

497, 507 -08 (2017) (citing ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: Special 
Functions of the Trial Judge (3d ed. 2000) in providing guidance regarding a 
trial judge’s responsibility to safeguard the rights of the accused); Tetu, 
139 Hawaiʻ i at 215, 386 P.3d at 852 (referencing ABA  Criminal Justice  
Standards for the  Defense Function (4th ed. 2015) as part of this court’s

the proposition that “[t]he duty of the prosecutor is to seek justice, not 
merely to convict” ( alteration in original )).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
17 appeal, as set forth in the ABA Standards, appl ies equally to 
appointed or retained counsel.  
  The  ABA Defense Function Standards further clarify 
that “[t] he decision whether to appeal must be the defendant ’s 
own choice ”--and not that of counsel.  Id.; see also ABA Defense 
Function Standards, Standard 4- 5.2(v) (listing “whether to 
appeal” among the decisions that are to be made “by the accused  
after full consultation with counsel” ).  Defense counsel should 
take “whatever steps are necessary” to protect the client’s 
right to appeal, even “if the client decides to proceed with the 
appeal against the advice of counsel.”  ABA Defense Function 
Standards, Standards 4-8.2(b), 4 -8.3(c).  Counsel should be 
“diligent in perfecting appeals and expediting their prompt 
submission” to the appropriate appellate court.  ABA Defense 
Function Standards, Standard 4 -8.4(a).

Standards for the Defense Function, released since the circuit 
court proceedings in the 2007 case,  reaffirms the responsibility 
of defense counsel in a criminal case to consult with a client 
regarding an appeal and to undertake the procedural steps to 
effectuate the appeal upon the client ’s request.  See ABA 
Criminal Justice Standards for the Defense Function, Standard 4-***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
18 209.1 (4th ed. 2015).   We now specifically adopt these 
requirements as a component of effective assistance of counsel 
under article I, section 14 
and due process under article I, 
section 5 of the Hawai i Constitution. 
  In addition, appointed counsel has a duty to pursue an 
appeal if a defendant in a criminal case so chooses even when 
counsel believes the appeal is 
wholly frivolous.  In In re 
Attorney’s Fees of Mohr , 97 Hawaii 1, 32 P.3d 647 (2001), this 
court overruled Carvalho v. State , 81 Hawai i 185, 192, 914 P.2d 
1378, 1385 (App. 1996), in which the ICA had intimated that 
appointed counsel could avoid prosecuting a meritless appeal by 
21filing so-called “Anders briefs.”   We rejected the practice, 
instead enunciating the “better policy” of “requir[ing] counsel 
to remain an advocate for the client.”   Mohr, 97 Hawaii at 7, 32 
P.3d at 653. 
                     
20  We note that, although both versions of the ABA Standards 
reference court judgments, the Standards would apply with equal force to 
final orders, which are appealable under our precedent.  See Nicol, 140 
Hawaii at 491, 403 P.3d at 266.  
 21 In Anders v. California , the United States Supreme Court held 
that jurisdictions may permit appointed counsel to request permission to 
withdraw when he or she finds an appeal to be “wholly frivolous.”  386 U.S. 
738, 744 (1967).  Such a request must be accompanied by “a brief ref erring to 
anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal,” leaving it to 
the court, rather than counsel, to determine if a case is “wholly frivolous.”  
Id
.  In jurisdictions that permit this practice, such briefs are frequently 
referred to a s “Anders briefs.”   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
19   Lastly, it is noted that a defense attorney, “in 
common with all members of the bar, is subject to standards of 
conduct stated in statutes, rules, decisions of courts, and 
codes, canons or other standards of professional conduct.”  ABA 
22Defense Function Standards, Standard 4-1.2(e).   In keeping with 
that directive, trial counsel in th is case was subject to the 
Hawai23i Rules of Professional Conduct (HRPC),  which state that 
“[a] lawyer should pursue a matter on behalf of a client despite 
opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the 
lawyer[.]”  HRPC Rule 1.3 cmt. [1].   
  Given that the clear weight of authority supports an 
obligation on the part of defense counsel to take the procedural 
steps necessary to pursue an appeal  when requested by the 
defendant, a failure by Maddox’s trial counsel to do so would 
amount to an “omission[] of defense counsel reflecting counsel’s 
24lack of skill, judgment[,] or diligence.”   Antone, 62 Haw. at 
                     
 22 See also  ABA Criminal Justice Standards for the Defense Function, 
Standard 4- 1.1(b) (4th ed. 2015)  (“[A] lawyer should always read and comply 
with the rules of professional conduct and other authorities that are binding 
in the specif ic jurisdiction.”).  
 23 An order amending and reissuing the HRPC was  adopted and 
promulgated by this court in 2013 , becoming  effective on January 1, 2014.  
All portions of the HRPC cited herein remain substantively the same as the 
versions in effect during the circuit court proceedings in the 2007 case.  
 24 Although defense counsel must consult with the client and ensure 
steps are taken to preserve the client’s right to appeal, we do not suggest 
that counsel at trial is required to continue representation as appellate 
counsel.  See ABA Criminal Justice Standards for the Defense Function,

20 348-49, 615 P.2d at 104.  However, to be entitled to a Rule 40 
hearing on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, 
Maddox must also allege facts demonstrating that the omission 
“resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial impairment of 
a potentially meritorious defense.”  Id. 
  When evaluating whether defense counsel’s omission 
deprived a defendant of a potentially meritorious defense, we 
consider “the possible, rather than the probable, effect” of the 
error.  Wilton v. State , 116 Hawai i 106, 119, 170 P.3d 357, 370 
(2007) (quoting Briones, 74 Haw. at 464, 848 P.2d at 977).  
“Accordingly, no showing of actual prejudice is required to 
prove ineffective assistance of counsel.”  Id. (internal 
quotation marks omitted).  We therefore do not inquire into 
whether Maddox’s appeal would succeed on the merits, but instead 
we address w
hether trial counsel’s failure to fulfill the steps 
necessary to pursue an appeal possibly impaired Maddox’s 
defense. 
  Notwithstanding trial counsel’s failure to provide 
assistance, Maddox filed his own handwritten notice of appeal 
following the circuit c ourt’s oral dismissal of the 2007 case 
                                                                  
(. . . continued) 
 
Standard 4- 9.1(d) (4th ed. 2015).  However, formal withdrawal procedures are 
required to be undertaken in penal proceedings  to obtain the approval of the 
court.  See HRPP Rule 57 (2000).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
21 without prejudice.  The ICA on August 25, 2009,  dismissed 
Maddox’s notice of appeal in part because no order dismissing 
the 2007 case without prejudice was entered by the circuit court 
25prior to or during the pendency of the appeal.   The order was 
not filed until January 7, 2010--nearly eight months after the 
26court’s oral dismissa l.   Hawai i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP) require the filing of a notice of appeal “within 30 days 
after entry of the judgment or order appealed from.”  HRAP Rule 
4(b)(1) (2015).  Thus, a notice of appeal from the order 
dismissing the 2007 case would have been duly filed after the 
entry of the order on January 7, 2010.  Yet no new notice of 
appeal was filed in the 2007 case following the filing of the 
circuit court’s order. 
  With the assistance of counsel, Maddox might have been 
able to urge the circuit court to issue an appealable order more 
expeditiously, or at minimum, timely file a notice of appeal 
                     
 25 It is noted that the ICA’s alternative holding --that it lacked 
appellate jurisdiction over the appeal because a circuit court dismissal 
without prejudice of criminal charges lacks a sentence--was incorrect.  This 
court recently held in Nicol that under HRS § 641 -11, a defendant may appeal 
from an order of the circuit court dismissing proceedings without prejudice.  
140 Hawai i at 491, 403 P.3d at 266.  We determined in Nicol that the 
legislative history of § 641 -11 and our jurisdiction’s caselaw indicate that 
the finality of the circuit court’s decision, rather than simply whether a 
“sentence” was rendered, is the determinative factor in whether jurisdiction 
exists over the appeal.  Id. 
 26 As explained  supra, note 10, the circuit court’s order stated 
that the court made follow -up requests to the State for the submission of 
proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order.  Apparently, when 
none were forthcoming, the court entered its own.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
22 following the entry of the order dismissing the 2007 case.  The  
failure to fulfill procedural requirements resulted in the loss 
of Maddox’s right to appeal the ci rcuit court’s order.  If the 
facts are as Maddox alleges, this forfeiture can be attributed 
to trial counsel’s wrongful refusal or omission to undertake the 
steps to initiate an appeal. 
  Although we have long held that courts may permit an 
untimely appeal when “defense counsel has inexcusably or 
ineffectively failed to pursue a defendant ’s appeal from a 
criminal conviction,” State v. Knight , 80 Hawai i 318, 323, 909 
P.2d 1133, 1138 (1996), this court has not  before addressed the 
complete denial of a crimin al appeal as it relates to an 
ineffective assistance of counsel claim under the Antone 
framework.  Cf. In re RGB , 123 Hawai i 1, 54, 229 P.3d 1066, 1119 
(2010) (Acoba, J., dissenting) (arguing that counsel’s wrongful 
omission that resulted in  forfeiture of appeal in a civil case 
involving termination of parental rights warranted post- judgment 
relief under Antone ).  However, this court has definitively 
stated that “failure by appointed counsel ‘to comme nce the 
simple steps for appeal is a blatant denial of due process .’”  
Erwin, 57 Haw. at  270, 554 P.2d at 238 (quoting Blanchard , 429 
F.2d at 90) .  A primary reason that a defendant is guaranteed 
effective assistance of counsel is to ensure that the defendant ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
23 is not denied due process.  Tetu , 139 Hawai i at 219, 386 P.3d at  
856 (“The Constitution guarantees a fair trial through the Due 
Process Clauses, but it defines the basic elements of a fair 
trial largely through the several provisions of the [s]ixth 
[a]mendment, including the [c]ounsel [c]lause. ”).  Consequently, 
we hold that when a defendant is denied an appeal because of a 
failure or omission of defense counsel, a defendant need not 
demonstrate any additional possibility of impairment to 
establish that counsel was ineffective under article I, sections 
5 and 14 of the Hawai i Constitution. 
  Maddox has thus alleged facts demonstrating a wrongful 
omission by trial counsel that resulted in the substantial 
impairment of a potentially meritorious defense, which would 
establish that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance 
under the Hawai27i Constitution .   Because these facts, if true, 
would entitle Maddox to pursue an appeal of the order dismissing 
the 2007 case without prejudice, he has raised a colorable claim 
for post-conviction relief and  is entitled to a n evidentiary 
                     
 27 Because we find that Maddox has alleged facts establishing  a 
colorable claim for ineffective assistance of counsel under the Hawai i 
Constitution, we do not address whether the facts would also give rise to a 
federal ineffective assistance of counsel claim.  We note, however, that the 
United States Supreme Court has held that the failure of counsel to institute 
an appeal when so instructed or to consult with a defendant who has indicated 
interest in appealing amount s to “professionally unreasonable” behavior.  Roe 
v. Flores- Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 477, 480 (2000).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
24 hearing on ground G of his Petition as it relates to his 
ineffective assistance claim. 
B. Abandonment by Defense Counsel  
  Maddox also contends that he was entitled to 
assistance of counsel until the termination of the 2007 case.  
The United States Supreme Court has recognized an “essential 
difference between a claim of attorney error, however egregious, 
and a claim that an attorney had essentially abandoned his 
client.”  Maples v. Thomas , 565 U.S. 266, 282 (2012) (internal 
citations omitted).  Federal courts consider a trial “unfair if 
the accused is denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial,” 
and “[n]o specific showing of prejudice  [is] required ” to 
establish a constitutional defect.  United States v. Cronic , 466 
U.S. 648, 659 (1984).   The Maples Court thus characterized an 
attorney’s abandonment of a client as an “extraordinary 
circumstance beyond [the client’s] control” that potentially 
entitles the client to post-conviction relief.  565 U.S.  at 282-
83.  Courts of last resort in other jurisdictions have likewise 
addressed the issue of abandonment by counsel under varying 
circumstances, consistently regarding it as grounds for relief.  
See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Bennett , 593 Pa. 382, 399, (2007) 
(characterizing abandonment by counsel as a dereliction of 
“minimum norms” of counsel’s performance and the “functional 
equivalent of having no counsel at all,” entitling a petitioner ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
25 to remand for hearing of post- conviction relief claims); Amco 
Builders & Developers, Inc. v. Team Ace Joint Venture , 469 Mich. 
90, 96 (2003) (holding abandonment by counsel in a civil action 
to be sufficient ground for setting aside a default or default 
judgment); In re Sanders , 21 Cal. 4th 697, 708- 09 (1999) 
(considering abandonment by counsel as good cause for delayed 
presentation of habeas corpus claims and equating abandonment by 
counsel with a complete lack of representation); People v.  
Berger, 9 N.Y.2d 692, 693 (1961) (reversing Appellate Division’s 
denial of coram nobis petition and remitting for trial of 
petitioner’s allegation of abandonment by counsel).  
  Under Hawai i law, withdrawal of counsel in penal 
proceedings is governed by HRPP Rule 57, which states as 
follows: 
Withdrawal of counsel shall require the approval of the 
court and shall be subject to Rule 1.16 of the Hawai i Rules 
of Professional Conduct.  Where the defendant is or may be 
indigent, substitution of counsel shall comply with the 
procedure established in Hawai i Revised Statutes, chapter 
802.  Unless otherwise ordered, withdrawal of counsel shall 
not become effective until substitute counsel appears or is 
appointed, the defendant appears pro se or the defendant is 
deemed to have waived counsel.  
HRPP Rule 57 (2000).  Unless the attorney- client relationship is 
terminated by permission of the tribunal pursuant to this rule, 
the attorney is obligated to “carry through to conclusion all 
matters undertaken by the client,” the relationship terminating 
only when the matter has been resolved.  HRPC Rule 1.3 c mt. [4]; ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
26 28HRPC Rule 1.16(c).   And even  when the relationship is 
terminated by a court’s grant of a motion to withdraw, an 
attorney is expected to take steps to protect the client’s 
interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client and 
allowing time for employment of other counsel.  HRPC Rule 
291.16(d).  
  Although our jurisdiction’s test for ineffective 
assistance of counsel is well settled, this court has not 
directly addressed the issue of abandonment by counsel.  We now 
hold that, when appointed counsel wholly abandons professional 
duties to his or her client for the substantial duration of a 
critical stage of the proceeding without timely following the 
procedural steps to properly withdraw from representation, 
prejudice is presumed because it is “ functional [ly] equivalent 
[to] having no counsel at all. ”  Bennett , 593 Pa. at 399.   
                     
 28 HRPC Rule 1.16(c) states in full, “A lawyer must comply with 
applicable law requiring notice to or permission of a tribunal when 
terminating a representation.  When ordered to do so by a tribunal, a lawyer 
shall continue representation notwithstanding good cause for terminating the 
representation.”  
 29 HRPC Rule 1.16(d) states as follows :  
Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take 
steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a 
client’s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the 
client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, 
surrendering papers and property to which the client is 
entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee or 
expense that has not been earned or incurred. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
27   As discussed, we have held that the “failure by 
appointed counsel ‘to commence the simple steps for appeal is a 
blatant denial of due process.’”  State v. Erwin , 57 Haw. 268, 
269, 554 P.2d 236, 238 (1976) (quoting Blanchard v. Brewer , 429 
F.2d 89, 90 (8th Cir. 1970)).  It logically follows that the 
steps to effectuate an appeal constitute a critical stage in the 
proceeding during which a defendant is entitled to counsel.  An 
appointed counsel’s wrongful abandonment of professional duties  
to a defendant for the substantial duration of this critical 
stage would therefore give rise to a presumption of prejudice. 
  Here, there is nothing in the record to indicate that 
trial counsel filed a motion to withdraw as counsel pursuant to 
HRPP Rule 57 following the oral dismissal without prejudice of 
the 2007 case.  And, as noted above, all defense filings 
relating to the 2007 c ase following the court’s oral dismissal 
without prejudice were handwritten, pro se motions, with the 
sole exception of 
trial counsel’s motion for compensation in 
30excess of the statutory maximum as allowed by HRS § 802- 5(b).   
Trial counsel’s alleged state ment to Maddox following the May 
14-15, 2009 hearing that trial counsel could not continue to 
represent Maddox on appeal or in any manner also represents a 
                     
 30 Trial counsel’s motion for additional fees was denied by the 
circuit court.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
28 rejection by trial counsel of the obligation to represent Maddox  
through “all stages  of proceedings,  including appeal, if any[,]” 
31as mandated by HRS § 802- 5(a)  and the circuit court’s  order 
32appointing trial counsel.  
  Taken as a whole, these alleged facts indicate that 
trial counsel effectively abandoned Maddox for the substantial 
duration or the entirety of a critical stage in the 2007 case.  
We accordingly presume that this abandonment would be 
33prejudicial.   Because these facts, if true, would entitle 
Maddox to proceed with his appeal at this juncture, he has 
                     
 31 As previously noted, HRS § 802 -5(a) provides in relevant part as 
follows:  “when it shall appear to a judge that a person requesting the 
appointment of counsel satisfies the requirements of this chapter, the judge 
shall appoint counsel to represent the person at all stages of the 
proceedings, including appeal, if any .”  (Emphasis added .)  
 32 As discussed  supra, note 18,  the circuit court’s December 22, 
2008 order stated, “IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that [trial counsel] is appointed 
legal counsel for the Defendant at all stages of proceedings, including 
appeal, if any.”   
  Although the circumstances of this case involve appointed 
counsel, to which HRS § 802 -5(a) and the order of appointment  apply, we note 
that HRPP Rule 57 and HRPC requirements as to terminating representation 
would be  equally applicable  to retained counsel in penal proceedings . 
 33 The circuit court’s Order Denying Petition includes the following 
Finding of Fact: “67.  Although several attorneys have withdrawn as counsel 
for Petitioner in [the 2007 case]  and [the 2009 case], Petitioner has been 
represented by counsel throughout the proceedings in said cases.”  The 
circuit court’s belief that Maddox was represented “throughout the 
proceedings” is likely due to the fact that no motion to withdraw as counsel 
was filed by trial counsel following the May 14 -15, 2009 hearing.  The 
record, however, clearly indicates that Maddox was seeking to pursue 
appellate relief in the 2007 case , but it appears that he did not  receive the 
assistance of court -appointed counsel.  To the extent that the circuit 
court’s finding is contrary to our holding that Maddox alleged facts that 
would establish a colorable claim of abandonment by counsel, it is clearly 
erroneous.  See  Dan, 76 Hawai ʻi at 428, 879 P.2d at 533.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
29 raised a colorable claim for relief and is entitled to an 
evidentiary hearing on ground  G of his Petition as it relates to 
34his claim of abandonment by defense counsel.   
IV. CONCLUSION 
  Maddox’s allegation that trial counsel failed to take 
the procedural steps to file an appeal of the 2007 case set 
forth facts that, if true, establish a colorable claim of 
ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal under article I, 
sections 5 and 14 of the Hawaii Constitution.  Maddox has also 
alleged facts that, if true, raise a colorable claim that trial 
counsel abandoned his representation of Maddox for the duration 
                     
 34 Maddox’s thirt een remaining questions  on certiorari, for which 
Maddox provides responses,  are either waived or without merit.  Question 1 
incorrectly assumes that our standard of review in this case should be abuse 
of discretion.  See Dan, 76 Hawai ʻi at 427, 879 P.2d at 532.  Question  3 
requests this court to resolve the issue of whether the circuit court erred 
in dismissing the 2007 case without prejudice.  However, the propriety of the 
circuit court’s ruling is not properly befo re this court.  Question  4 
incorrectly  raises a double jeopardy violation based on  disciplinary 
punishment experienced while imprisoned and  Maddox’s indictment on the same 
charges in the 2007 and 2009 cases.  See State v. Alvey , 67 Hawai ʻi 49, 50, 
678 P.2d 5, 6 (1984) (recognizing that to give collateral estoppel effect to 
prison disciplinary action would “frustrate the objectives of the crim inal 
justice system”); HRS  § 701-110 (1993).  Question  5 erroneously  challenges 
Judge Bissen’s authority to rule on a criminal matter while sitting as a 
family court judge.  See Adams v. State, 103 Hawai ʻi 214, 223, 81 P.3d 394, 
403 (2003) (affirming the c ircuit court’s finding that a circuit court judge 
acting as a family court judge retains his or her authority as a circuit 
judge).  Questions 6, 10, and 14 pertain to challenges regarding the 2009 
case; however , no appeal was taken from the conviction in that case, nor does 
Maddox provide any reason why these claims could not have been raised, and 
thus they are  waived under HRPP Rule 40(a)(3).   Question  7 incorrectly  posits 
that re-prosecution in the 2009 case was barred by HRS § 701 -110(4) (2009).  
Questions 8, 9, 11, and 12 pose questions, but they do  not involve legal 
claims for relief.  Question  13 implies, without merit, that the circuit 
court lacked jurisdiction in the 2007 and 2009 case s.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
30 of a critical stage of the 2007 case in violation of statutory 
law and article I, sections 5 and 14 of the Hawai i Constitution.  
  Because Maddox has presented  colorable claims for 
post-conviction  relief, he is entitled to  a HRPP Rule 40 
evidentiary hearing.  Accordingly, the ICA’s Judgment on Appeal  
and the circuit court’s Order Denying Petition are  vacated, and 
the case is remanded to the circuit court for a HRPP Rule 40 
evidentiary hearing on ground G  of the Petition.
