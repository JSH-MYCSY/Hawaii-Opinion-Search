This appeal arises from a judicial decree of foreclosure 
granted in favor of plaintiff “U.S. Bank N.A. in its Capacity as 
Trustee for the registered holders of MASTR Asset Backed Electronically Filed

 Securities Trust 2005
-NC1, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, 
Series 2005-NC1”  (“U.S. Bank”) against defendants Joseph Keaoula 
Mattos (“Mattos”) and Chanelle Leola Meneses (“Meneses”) 
(collectively, “Defendants”).  At issue is whether the Circuit 
1Court of the First Circuit  (“circuit court”) properly granted 
U.S. Bank’s “Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of 
Foreclosure Against All Defendants on Complaint Filed July 21, 
2011” (“motion” or “motion for summary judgment”).  In its 
published opinion, the Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) 
affirmed the circuit court.  
U.S. Bank N.A. v. Mattos , 137 
Hawaii 209, 367 P.3d 703 (App. 2016).2   
Defendants assert the ICA erred in concluding that the 
circuit court properly granted summary judgment due to the 
existence of genuine issues of material fact.  Specifically, 
Defendants allege U.S. Bank lacked standing to foreclose 
because: 
1. 
 the two mortgage assignments to the securitized trust 
in the chain of U.S. Bank’s alleged ownership of 
[Defendants’]  loan were “ robo-signed” by persons with 
insufficient authority or personal knowledge as to 
what they swore  to, and whose signatures differed 
among similar mortgage assignments that they had 
supposedly signed and/or notarized;  
 
2.  the two mortgage assignments to the securitized trust 
in the chain of U.S. Bank ’s alleged ownership of 
  
1                    
The Honorable Judge Bert I. Ayabe presided.  
 
2 The ICA initially issued its decision in the form of a summary 
disposition order (“SDO”).   U.S. Bank filed a motion for publication, which 
the ICA granted, entering its Published Opinion on  February 12, 2016.    
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
3 
 [Defendants’]  loan violated the securitized trust ’s 
governing instrument, known as its Pooling and 
Servicing Agreement [(“PSA”)]. . . .  
 
3.  the two mortgage assignments to the securitized trust 
in the chain of U.S. Bank ’s alleged ownership of 
[Defendants’]  loan were unproven as supported only by 
hearsay declarations inadmissible pursuant to 
[Hawai‘i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (“HRCP”)]  Rule 56(e) and 
Hawaii Evidence Rule 803(b)(3)[sic]3 as U.S. Bank’ s 
Declarants had no personal knowledge of how earlier 
business records had been compiled in addition to the 
two mortgage assignments having been invalid, supra.  
 
 We address the third issue on certiorari first.  We hold 
that the ICA erred by concluding the declaration of Richard Work 
(“Work”), the Contract Management Coordinator of Ocwen Loan 
Servicing, LLC (“Ocwen”), rendered him a “qualified witness” 
under State v . Fitzwater , 122 Hawai
i 354, 227 P.3d 520 (2010) 
for U.S. Bank’s records under the Hawai ‘i Rules of Evidence 
(“HRE”) Rule 803(b)(6) hearsay exception for records of 
regularly conducted activity.  In addition, U.S. Bank failed to 
establish that it was a holder entitled to enforce the note at 
the time the foreclosure complaint was filed.  See Bank of 
America, N.A. v. Reyes-Toledo , 139 Hawai i 361, 370 -71, 390 P.3d 
1248, 1257-58 (2017).  
With respect to the first issue on certiorari, because it 
is unclear what Defendants mean by “robo - signing” and because a 
ruling on the legal effect of “robo -signing” is not necessary to 
                     
3 It appears this is a typographical error, as the ICA Opinion is based 
on Rule 803(b)(6), the hearsay exception for “[r]ecords  of regularly 
conducted activity.”  Rule 803(b)(3) is the hearsay exception for “[t]hen 
existing mental, emotional, or physical condition,” and is clearly 
inapplicable. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
4 
 the determination of this case, we set aside the ICA’s holding 
that conclusory assertions that  fail to offer factual 
allegations or a legal theory indicating how alleged “robo-
signing” caused harm to a mortgagee are insufficient to 
establish a defense in a foreclosure action.  Addressing the 
factual allegations underlying the “robo -signing” claim, 
however, we conclude there is a  genuine issue of material fact 
as to whether Ocwen had the authority to sign the second 
assignment of mortgage to U.S. Bank. 
With respect to the second issue on certiorari, we affirm 
the ICA in part.  We adopt the majority rule followed by the ICA 
in U.S. Bank Nat. Ass’n v. Salvacion , 134 Hawai i 170, 338 P.3d 
1185 (App. 2014) and hold that a third party unrelated to a 
mortgage securitization pooling and servicing agreement lacks 
standing to enforce an alleged violation of its terms unless the 
violation renders the mortgage assignment void, rather than 
voidable, but we limit the holding to the judicial foreclosure 
context.  
Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s March 9, 2016 Judgment on 
Appeal, as well as the circuit court ’s August 26, 2014 Findings 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Plaintiff’s 
Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure Against 
All Defendants on Complaint Filed July 21, 2011, and remand this 
case to the circuit court.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 II. Background 
 On October 15, 2004, Mattos signed a mortgage and a note 
for $296,000 in favor of New Century Mortgage Corporation (“New 
Century”).  The mortgage was recorded in the Land Court on 
October 25, 2004.     
 On July 21, 2011, U.S. Bank filed a foreclosure complaint .  
U.S. Bank alleged it was the owner of the mortgage by virtue of 
an Assignment of Mortgage dated January 3, 2007 (“first 
assignment”) and an Assignment of Mortgage dated September 10, 
2010 (“second assignment”),  both of which were recorded in the 
Land Court (the mortgage, first assignment, and second 
assignment are sometimes collectively referred to as “the 
mortgage documents”).   Attached to the complaint were copies of 
4the note with an allonge
 and the mortgage documents.   The 
allonge was apparently executed by Ocwen as New Century’s 
attorney-in-fact pursuant to a Limited Power of Attorney.  The 
allonge was dated June 22, 2010, although it stated it was 
effective January 31, 2005.    
On January 23, 2014, U.S. Bank filed a  motion for summary 
judgment.  The motion was supported by a declaration from Work, 
                     
4 “An ‘allonge’ is defined as a slip of paper sometimes attached to a 
negotiable instrument for the purpose of receiving further indorsements when 
the original paper is filled with indorsements. ”  Mortg. Elec. Registration 
Sys., Inc. v. Wise, 130 Hawai ‘i 11, 14 n.6 , 304 P.3d 1192, 1195  n.6 (2013).  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
6 
 which purported to authenticate various attached exhibits, 
including the underlying note, allonge, and mortgage documents.   
On April 15, 2014, Defendants filed their opposition to 
U.S. Bank’s motion.   In summary, Defendants alleged that U.S. 
Bank lacked standing to foreclose because (1) it failed to show 
it was the holder of the note at the time of foreclosure, ( 2) 
the mortgage assignments contained various alleged defects,  and 
(3) the motion’s supporting documents were inadmissible hearsay.  
Defendants’ opposition was also based on an affidavit from Marla 
Giddings (“Giddings”), a purported forensic and securitization 
analysis expert retained to opine as to whether U.S. Bank owned 
the note and mortgage.  Giddings asserted the assignments 
“suffer[ed] from several fatal flaws,” namely that the signers 
and notaries were known “robo-signers” who were employed by 
Ocwen and appeared to have differing signatures on several 
documents .  Giddings also claimed the assignments violated the 
securitized trust’s PSA.  On July 18, 2014, after a hearing, the 
circuit court granted U.S. Bank’s motion for summary judgment.   
 Defendants appealed to the ICA.  In its  opinion, the ICA 
rejected Defendants’ arguments and affirmed the grant of summary 
judgment in U.S. Bank’s favor.   Mattos, 137 Hawai i at 214, 367 
P.3d at 708.  The ICA rejected Defendants’ first argument 
regarding “robo- signing” because their opposition to U.S. Bank’s 
motion “failed to assert facts or law explaining how the alleged ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
7 
 ‘robo-signing’ caused them harm or damages.”   137 Hawai‘ i at 210, 
367 P.3d at 704.  The ICA rejected Defendants’ second argument 
that the assignments were void, holding , “This court, however, 
has held that the non- compliance with a PSA does not render the 
assignment void.  Given our holding in Salvacion , Appellants 
have no standing to challenge U.S. Bank ’s alleged noncompliance 
with the PSA.”  137 Hawai i at 211, 367 P.3d at 705.  Finally, 
the ICA rejected Defendants’ third argument,  determining that 
Work was a “qualified witness” pursuant to Fitzwater  who was 
able to authenticate the records attached to his declaration for 
admission under HRE Rule 803(b)(6).  137 Hawai i at 211-213, 367 
P.3d at 705- 07.   
 We now address the questions presented on certiorari.  
III. Standard of Review 
An award of summary judgment is reviewed de novo and “is 
appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to the material 
fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of 
law.”  French v. Hawaii Pizza Hut, Inc.,  105 Hawai ‘i 462, 466, 99 
P.3d 1046, 1050 (2004) (citing Ross v. Stouffer Hotel Co.,  76 
Hawai‘i 454, 457, 879 P.2d 1037, 1040 (1994)). 
 Furthermore,  
The burden is on the party moving for summary 
judgment (moving party) to show the absence of any genuine 
issue as to all material facts, which, under applicable 
principles of substantive law, entitles the moving party to ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
8 
 judgment as a matter of law.  This burden has two 
components.  
 
First, the moving party has the burden of producing 
support for its claim that: (1) no genuine issue of 
material fact exists with respect to the essential elements 
of the claim or defense which the motion seeks to establish 
or which the motion questions; and (2) based on the 
undisputed facts, it is entitled to summary judgment as a 
matter of law.  Only when the moving party satisfies its 
initial burden of production does the burden shift to the 
non-moving party to respond to the  motion for summary 
judgment and demonstrate specific facts,  as opposed to 
general allegations, that present a genuine issue worthy of 
trial. 
 
Second, the moving party bears the ultimate burden of 
persuasion.  This burden always remains with the moving 
party and requires the moving party to convince the court 
that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the 
moving part is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of 
law.

omitted).  
IV. Discussion  
A. Work’s declaration was insufficient to establish that he is
 
 a “qualified witness” under Fitzwater as to U.S. Bank’s 
 records.  
 Pursuant to  HRCP Rule 56(e)  (2000)5 and Rules of the Circuit 
Courts of the State of Hawai i (“RCCH”) Rule 7(g ) (1997)6, a 
  
5                    
HRCP Rule 56 governs summary judgment.  HRCP Rule  56(e) provides  in 
pertinent part: 
 
Form of affidavits; further testimony; defense required.  
Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on 
personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be 
admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that 
the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated 
therein. Sworn or certified copies of all papers or parts 
thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached 
thereto or served therewith.  
 
6 RCCH Rule 7(g) provides in pertinent part:  
 
(continued. . .)  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
9 
 declaration in support of a summary judgment motion must be 
based on personal knowledge, contain facts that would be 
admissible in evidence, and show that the declarant is competent 
to testify as to the matters contained within the declaration.  
The ICA ruled that 
the loan documents, including the note and 
allonge, were admissible through Work’s declaration , which 
established he was a “qualified witness” able to authenticate 
the records of U.S. Bank and Ocwen pursuant to the hearsay 
exception for records of regularly conducted activity.  See 
Mattos, 137 Hawai ‘i at 213, 367 P.3d at 707. 
 With respect to the note and mortgage documents, Work’s 
declaration states: 
1)  I am the Contract Management Coordinator of OCWEN Loan 
Servicing, LLC (“Ocwen”), t he servicer for U.S. Bank N.A. 
in its capacity as Trustee for the registered holders of 
MASTR Asset Backed Securities Trust 2005 -NC1, Mortgage 
Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2005 -NC1 [(“U.S. Bank”) ] 
of the mortgage loan at issue in this case (the “Loan”).  
As such, I am authorized to make this Declaration.  
 
2)  I am over the age of 18 years, and I have personal 
knowledge of the facts and matters stated herein based on 
my review of the business records described below.  The 
statements set forth in this Declaration are true and 
correct, to the best of my knowledge and belief.  
 
3) 
 In the regular performance of my job functions, I have 
access to and am familiar with [U.S. Bank ’s] records and 
documents relating to this case (the “Records” ), including 
Ocwen’s business records relating to the servicing of the 
                                                                 
(continued. . .) 
Declaration in lieu of affidavit.  In lieu of an affidavit, 
an unsworn declaration may be made by a person, in writing, 
subscribed as true under penalty of law, and dated [.]

10 
 Loan (the “ Ocwen Records” ).  In making this Declaration, I 
relied upon the Records.  
 
4)  The Ocwen Records document transactions relating to the 
Loan and were made and are maintained in the regular course 
of Ocwen
’s business consistent with Ocwen ’s regular 
practices, which require that records documenting 
transactions relating to the serviced mortgage loan be made 
at or near the time of the transactions documented by a 
person with knowledge of the transactions or from 
information transmitted by such a person.  
 
5) According to the Ocwen Records, [U.S. Bank] is in 
possession of an original promissory note dated October 15, 
2004 . . . in favor of NEW CENTURY MORTGAGE CORPORATION 
(the “Note”).  A true and correct copy of the Note is 
attached hereto as Exhibit 1.  
 
6) The Note has been endorsed to [U.S. Bank] by Ocwen 
acting as the attorney -in-fact for New Century Mortgage 
Corporation.   A true and correct copy of the Limited Power 
of Attorney designating Ocwen as New Century ’s attorney- in-
fact is attached hereto as Exhibit 2. [7] 
 
7) According to the Ocwen Records, the Note is secured by a 
Mortgage dated October 15, 2004, and recorded on October 
25, 2004 in the Bureau of Conveyances of the State of 
Hawaii,[8] as Document Number 3183517, and noted on the 
Transfer Certificate of Title No.: 671,440 (the 
“Mortgage” ).  A true and correct copy of the Mortgage is 
attached hereto as Exhibit 3.  
 
8) According to the Ocwen Records, the Mortgage was 
assigned to  [U.S. Bank] by that assignment dated January 3, 
2007, and recorded on January 30, 2007, in the Office of 
the Assistant Registrar of the Land Court of the State of 
Hawaii as Document Number 3550341, and that assignment 
dated September 29, 2010, and recorded October 11, 2010 in 
the Office of the Assistant Registrar of the Land Court of 
the State of Hawaii as Document Number 4007870 (the 
“Assignments ”).  True and correct copies of the referenced 
assignments are attached hereto as Exhibit 4 and  
Exhibit 5.  A true and correct copy of the Limited Power of 
Attorney is attached hereto as Exhibit 6. [9] 
 
As to the alleged default, amounts owed, and notices provided, 
Work’s declaration is based on the “Ocwen Records.”     
                     
7  This Limited Power of Attorney is dated March 2, 2005.  
 
8 This appears to be a Land Court filing in the Office of Assistant 
Registrar.  
9  This Limited Power of Attorney is dated April 13, 2012.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
11 
  We focus on  the ICA’s ruling that the note and mortgage 
documents were admissible through Work’s declaration as records 
of regularly conducted activity pursuant to HRE Rule 803(b)(6) 
and this court’s Fitzwater opinion.  HRE Rule 803(b)(6) 
provides: 
The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even 
though the declarant is available as a witness:  
. . . . 
(b)  Other exceptions.  
. . . . 
(6)  Records of regularly conducted activity.   A 
memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any 
form, of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, 
made in the course of a regularly conducted activity, at or 
near the time of the acts, events, conditions, opinions, or 
diagnoses, as shown by the testimony of the custodian or 
other qualified witness,  or by certification that complies 
with rule 902(11) or a statute permitting certification, 
unless the sources of information or other circumstances 
indicate lack of trustworthiness.  
 
(Emphasis added.)  
Fitzwater addressed the admissibility of business documents 
authenticated by an employee of another business, stating:   
A person can be a ‘qualified  witness’  who can 
authenticate a document as a record of regularly conducted 
activity under HRE Rule 803(b)(6) or its federal 
counterpart even if he or she is not an employee of the 
business that created the document, or has no direct, 
personal knowledge of how the document was created. As one 
leading commentator has noted:  
... [sic] The phrase ‘other qualified  witness’  is given a 
very broad interpretation.   The witness need only have 
enough familiarity with the record -keeping system of the 
business in question to explain how the record came into 
existence in the ordinary course of business.   The witness 
need not have personal knowledge of the actual creation of 
the documents or have personally assembled the records.  In 
fact, the witness need not even be an employee of the 
record-keeping entity as long as the witness understands 
the entity’s record -keeping system.  
 
There is no requirement that the records have been prepared 
by the entity that has custody of them, as long as they ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
12 
 were created in the regular course of some entity’s 
business. 
 
The sufficiency of the foundation evidence depends in part 
on the nature of the documents at issue.   Documents that 
are ‘standard records of the type regularly maintained by 
firms in a particular industry may require less by way of 
foundation testimony than less conventional documents 
proffered for admission as business records.’  
 
Thus, an employee of a business that receives records from 
another business can be a qualified  witness who can 
establish a sufficient foundation for their admission as 
records of the receiving business under HRE Rule 803(b)(6) . 
 
Fitzwater,  122 Hawai ‘i at 365-66, 227 P.3d at 531-32 (internal 
citations and footnote omitted) .  
Work’s declaration does not assert that he is a custodian 
of records for either U.S. Bank or Ocwen.  Therefore, the 
documents attached to his declaration are admissible under the 
HRE 803(b)(6) hearsay exception only if he is a “qualified 
witness” with respect to those documents.  The ICA Opinion 
relied on Fitzwater  in concluding that Work met the requirements 
of a “qualified witness” able to authenticate all the documents 
to which he  referred, and analyzed the issue as follows: 
As previously noted, Work’s declaration stated that he is 
the Contract Management Coordinator for Ocwen.  Work’s 
declaration further stated that Ocwen is the servicer for U.S. 
Bank related to the Appellants’ lo an, and that he had access to 
and was familiar with Appellants’
 loan records through his 
regular performance of his job.  Furthermore, Work’s declaration 
indicated the documents to which he referred to in preparing his 
declaration were “maintained in the regular course of Ocwen’s 
business consistent with Ocwen’s regul ar practices, which require 
that records documenting transactions relating to the serviced 
mortgage loan be made at or near the time of the transactions 
documented by a person with knowledge of the transactions or from 
information transmitted by such a per son.”  Thus, Work’s 
declaration establish es that Ocwen relies on the documents 
related to Appellants’  loan, there are further indicia of 
reliability given Ocwen’ s business practices,  and the documents 
constituted “records of regularly conducted activity ” that were ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
13 
 admissible as a hearsay exception, pursuant to HRE Rule 
803(b)(6).  The circuit court, therefore, did not err in relying 
upon the documents when it granted summary judgment in U.S. 
Bank’s favor.  
Mattos, 137 Hawai ‘i at 213, 367 P.3d at 707.   
To the extent the ICA ruled that Work’s declaration 
established him as a “qualified witness” with respect to Ocwen’s 
records, we agree.  To the extent the ICA opinion concluded that 
Work met the requirements to be a “qualified witness” with 
respect to U.S. Bank’s records, however, we disagree.  Fitzwater 
addresses situations in which one business receives  documents 
created by another business and includes them in its own 
records.  Work’s declaration does not indicate that U.S. Bank’s 
Records were received by Ocwen and incorporated into the Ocwen 
Records.  Work’s declaration also does not establish that Work 
is familiar wit h the record-keeping system of U.S. Bank.  
Rather, Work merely states that he has access to and is familiar 
with U.S. Bank’s records.   Thus Work’s declaration does not 
satisfy foundational requirements to make him a “qualified 
witness” for U.S. Bank’s records pursuant to  Fitzwater . 
Even if records attached to Work’s declaration were 
otherwise admissible as Ocwen records, there are separat e legal 
issues with respect to the note and allonge.  Defendants have 
continuously argued a lack of admissible evidence that U.S. Bank 
is the holder of the note.  On this issue, the ICA ruled that 
Work’s declaration established U.S. Bank as the holder of t he ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
14 
 note entitled to fore
close pursuant  to HRS § 490:3- 301 (2008).  
Mattos, 137 Hawai ‘i at 212, 367 P.3d at 706.  
In Reyes-Toledo, we held that a person seeking to 
judicially foreclose  on a mortgage following a promissory note 
default must establish that it was the “person entitled to 
enforce [the note]” as defined by HRS § 490:3- 301 at the time of 
the filing of the foreclosure complaint.  Reyes-Toledo, 139 
Hawaii at 370-71, 390 P.3d at 1257- 58.  HRS § 490:3- 301 
provides: 
‘Person entitled to enforce ’ an instrument means (i) the 
holder of the instrument, (ii) a nonholder in possession of 
the instrument who has the rights of a holder, or (iii) a 
person not in possession of the instrument who is entitled 
to enforce the instrument pursuant to section 490:3 -309 or 
490:3-418(d).  A person may be a person entitled to enforce 
the instrument even though the person is not the owner of 
the instrument or is in wrongful possession of the 
instrument.  
 
There was no evidence or argument presented in this case 
regarding HRS § 490:3- 301 subsections (ii) and (iii), and the 
ICA ruled on the basis that U.S. Bank was the “holder” pursuant 
to subsection (i).  The relevant definition of “holder” is in 
HRS § 490:1-201 (1) (2008).  This s ubsection defines a “holder” 
as “[t]he person in possession of a negotiable instrument that 
is payable either to bearer or to an identified person that is 
the person in possession[.]”  Since the allonge was apparently 
used to specifically indorse the note  to U.S.  Bank, admissible 
evidence was needed to demonstrate that U.S. Bank was in ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
15 
 possession of the note and allonge at the time of the filing of 
this foreclosure complaint for U.S. Bank to be entitled to 
summary judgment. 
 Even if the Ocwen records were admissible through the Work 
declaration, the only representation in Work’s declaration 
regarding possession of the note is in paragraph 5, which 
states, “According to the Ocwen records, [U.S. Bank]  is in 
possession of an original promissory note dated October 15, 2004 
. . . in favor of NEW CENTURY MORTGAGE CORPORATION[ .]”  This 
paragraph goes on to say that “[a] true and correct copy of the 
Note is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.”   (Emphasis added.)  
Work’s declaration does not even represent that U.S. Bank’s 
records contain the original note; Work merely states that 
Ocwen’s records so indicate.   Even if Work’s declaration had 
stated that the U.S. Bank records contain the original note, 
this statement would not be admissible because, as noted,  Work’s 
declaration is in sufficient to render him a “qualified witness” 
as to U.S. Bank’s records.     
In addition, paragraph 5 of Work’s declaration refers only 
to the original note and makes no reference to the allonge.  
Although Exhibit 1 also contains the allonge, which indorses the 
note to U.S. Bank, the allonge was never authenticated.  
Therefore, U.S. Bank was not entitled to summary judgment even ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
16 
 if the original note had been properly authenticated, which it 
was not. 
Even if the aforementioned issues concerning the note and 
allonge did not exist, Work’s declaration also does not satisfy 
the Reyes- Toledo requirement of an affirmative showing that U.S. 
Bank possessed the original note and allonge at the time of 
filing of this foreclosure complaint on July 21, 2011.   
For all of these reasons, Work’s declaration failed to meet 
U.S. Bank’s burden of establishing facts necessary for a grant 
of summary judgment.   
In order to provide guidance on remand, we address the 
other issues on certiorari. 
B. Defendants’ “robo -signing” allegation is unclear , so it is 
unnecessary to address the legal effect of “robo -signing.”  
However, the first issue on certiorari has merit because 
there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether 
Ocwen had authority to assign the mortgage from U.S. Bank’s 
predecessor in interest to U.S. Bank.  
  
The ICA held that conclusory assertions of  “robo-signing” 
are insufficient to establish a defense in a foreclosure action 
if the assertions lack factual allegations or a legal theory 
demonstrating how “robo -signing” caused harm to a mortgagee.   
Mattos, 137 Hawai i at 210, 367 P.3d at 704.  Defendants do not 
define what they mean by “robo -signing”; therefore, it is not 
necessary to address the legal effect of “robo -signing” at this ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
17 
 time.  Accordingly, we set aside the ICA’s holding  on this issue 
as it is not necessary to the determination of this case. 
Underlying Defendants’ “robo -signing”  allegations, however,  
are assertions that the two mortgage assignments to the 
securitized trust culminating in the assignment to U.S. Bank 
were signed “by persons with insufficient authority or personal 
knowledge as to what they swore to, and whose signatures 
differed among similar mortgage assignments that they had 
supposedly signed and/or notarized.”  Thus, Defendants assert 
that the assignments of mortgage were signed by persons (1) with 
insufficient authority; (2) with insufficient personal knowledge 
as to what they swore to; and (3) whose signatures  differed 
among similar mortgage assignments that they had supposedly 
signed and/or notarized.  We address each of these allegations 
in turn. 
We first address the allegation that the assignments of 
mortgage were signed by person s with insufficient authority.   
Exhibit 2 to Work’s declaration, the March 2, 2005 Limited Power 
of Attorney designating Ocwen as New Century’s attorney -in-fact, 
is admissible as an Ocwen record pursuant to Paragraph 6 of 
Work’s declaration.  This Limited Power of Attorney establishes 
Ocwen’s authority regarding the first mortgage assignment dated 
January 3, 2007 from Ocwen to U.S. Bank’s predecessor in 
interest, “U.S. Bank, N.A., as Trustee for the registered ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
18 
 holders of MASTR Asset Back Secur ities Trust 2005- NC1, Mortgage 
Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2005-NC1” (“U.S. Bank for 
Registered Holders”).10  Thus the first assignment of mortgage 
was signed by a person with sufficient authority. 
Exhibit 6 to Work’s declaration is an April 13, 2012 
Limited Power of Attorney, which is also admissible as an Ocwen 
record.  This Limited Power of Attorney purports to establish 
Ocwen’s authority to execute  the second assignment of mortgage 
dated September 29, 2010 from U.S. Bank for Registered Holders 
to U.S. Bank.  Although the difference between U.S. Bank for 
Registered Holders to U.S. Bank is unclear, t
his foreclosure 
action was brought in the name of the assignee U.S. Bank,  and 
this Limited Power of Authority was not effective until more 
than a year after the second assignment of mortgage.  Therefore, 
there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Ocwen 
had authority to sign the second assignment of mortgage to U.S. 
Bank. 
We next address Defendants’ allegation that the assignments 
of mortgage were signed by 
persons “with insufficient authority 
or personal knowledge as to what they swore[.] ”  Defendants 
themselves lack personal knowledge as to the signers’ knowledge.  
This allegation is therefore without merit. 
  
10 It appears the only difference between the entities “U.S. Bank for 
Registered Holders” and “U.S. Bank” is that the latter’s name includes the 
additional language “in its Capacity.”                    ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
19 
 We then turn to Defendants’ allegation that the assignments 
of mortgage contained signatures that differed among similar 
mortgage assignments supposedly signed and/or notarized
 by the 
same person.11  Even if the other assignments were admissible, 
there is no admissible evidence they were signed by different 
persons.  This allegation is 
therefore also without merit. 
C. In a judicial foreclosure, a third party to a 
pooling and 
servicing agreement lacks standing to challenge assignments 
in alleged violation of its terms unless the violation 
would render the assignment void. 
 
 Finally, in their second question on certiorari, Defendants 
challenge the foreclosure on the basis that the first and second 
assignments of the mortgage violated 
the requirements of the 
pooling and servicing agreement.   Paragraph 12 of the Giddings 
affidavit refers to the PSA as an exhibit filed  with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, and provides a website link.  
No explanation is provided as to how a document contained in a 
website link can be considered admissible evidence in this 
motion for summary judgment.  Thus
, the terms of the PSA  are not 
actually before us, and there is no actual evidence that the 
first and second assignments of mortgage violated terms within 
the PSA. 
                     
11  Defendants’ allegations regarding mortgage assignm ents were based on 
the Giddings affidavit.  U.S. Bank challenged Giddings’ interpretations of 
law, but never challenged whether she was qualified to testify as an expert, the scope of her alleged expertise, whether documents attached to declaration 
could properly be considered in the motion for summary judgment, or the 
admissibility of documents attached to her affidavit.    ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
20 
  Even if the terms of the PSA were properly before this 
court and showed that the first and second assignments of 
mortgage violated its terms, Defendants might not have standing 
to challenge the validity of mortgage assignments on this basis.  
In Salvacion, a case arising out of a judicial foreclosure, the 
ICA noted that, “[t]ypically, borrowers do not have standing to 
challenge the validity of an assignment of its loans because 
they are not parties to the agreement and because noncompliance 
with a trust’s governing document is irrelevant to the 
assignee’s standing to foreclose.”  Salvacion , 134 Hawai‘ i at 
175, 338 P.3d at 1190.  As pointed out in Salvacion , this is the 
12 overwhelming majority rule.  Id. According to Salvacion, 
Hawaii law would recognize an exception to the general rule when 
a challenge to a mortgage assignment would deem the assignment 
void, not voidable.  Id.  We adopt the ICA’s analysis in 
Salvacion, but limit the  holding to the judicial foreclosure 
context for the reasons that follow.  
On certiorari, Defendants urge this court to follow the 
minority rule allowing third -party challenges to an assignment, 
                     
12 The Giddings affidavit also asserts that the PSA  is governed by New 
York law, which, according to Giddings, provides that every sale  conveyance 
or other act of a trustee in contravention of a trust is void.  Even if it 
was proper to consider the PSA  under New York law, it is not clear whether a 
mortgage assignment in contravention of a pooling and servicing agreement 
would be deemed void or voidable.  See Glaski v. Bank of Am., N.A. , 218 Cal.  
App. 4th 1079, 109 6–97, 160 Cal.  Rptr. 3d 449, 463  (Cal. Ct. App. 2013)  
(construing New York law).   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
21 
 arguing that in Yvanova v. New Century Mortg. Corp., 62 Cal. 4th 
919, 365 P.3d 845 (2016), the Supreme Court of California 
allowed challenges to mortgage assignments based on non-
compliance with terms of securitized trust agreements.  The 
Supreme Court of California was clear, however, that its ruling 
was limited to the nonjudicial foreclosure context;  it held 
“only that a borrower who has suffered a nonjudicial foreclosure 
does not lack standing to sue for wrongful foreclosure based on 
an allegedly void assignment merely because he or she was in 
default on the loan and was not a party to the challenged 
assignment.”  62 Cal. 4th at 924, 365 P.3d at 848.  We also note 
that the Glaski  case, one of two cases cited in Salvacion  as 
going against the majority rule, 134 Hawai i at 176- 77, 338 P.3d 
at 1190-91, also arose out of a non- judicial foreclosure.  
Glaski, 218 Cal . App. 4th at 1082, 160 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 452.  As 
the issue of whether such challenges should be allowed in non-
judicial foreclosures is not before us, we limit our holding at 
this time to the judicial foreclosure context. 
Accordingly, in the context of judicial foreclosures, we 
adopt the majority rule followed in Salvacion  and hold that a 
third party unrelated to a pooling and servicing agreement lacks 
standing to challenge assignments based on alleged violation of 
the PSA’s terms unless the violation would render the assignment 
void.  As the PSA is not in evidence, we do not decide whether ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
22 
 any of its terms were violated and, if so, whether any such 
violation renders an assignment void or voidable.  
V. Conclusion 
  For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the ICA’s March 9, 
2016 Judgment on Appeal, as well as the circuit court ’s August 
26, 2014 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of 
Foreclosure Against All Defendants on Complaint Filed July 21, 
2011.  We remand  this case to the circuit court for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
