 discharged, suspended, or discriminated against on the sole 
basis of their work injuries .  In this case, an employer hired a 
permanent replacement for an employee who was taking a leave of 
absence due to such an injury.  The employer thus  declined to 
reinstate the employee to her pre- injury position upon her 
return, instead offering her only positions that were downgrades 
from her previous work or that she was unqualified to perform.  
The employer contends that this was not discrimination based 
solely on the employee’s work injury because it was motivated by 
the company’s business needs.  
  We now hold that, in order for business necessity to 
constitute a valid defense to a claim of work injury 
discrimination, an employer must demonstrate that the employee’s 
absence caused a business impairment that could not be 
reasonably alleviated by means that would not result in 
discrimination.  Because no such showing was made in this case, 
we affirm the decision of the Director of the Hawai‘i 
Department 
of Labor and Industrial Relations that the work injury 
discrimination in this case contravened our law.  We accordingly 
vacate the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ’s
 judgment and the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals ’ Judgment on A ppeal and remand the 
case to the Hawai‘ i Department of Labor and Industrial Relations 
for any further proceedings as may be appropriate. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
A. Agency Proceedings 
1. Hearing Officer 
  On September 15, 2010, 
Tammy L. Josue filed a 
complaint with the Wage Standards Division of the Hawaii 
Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (Department) 
alleging that BCI Coca-Cola Bottling Company (Coca-Cola) 
discriminated against her on the basis of her work injury in 
violation of  Hawai‘i Revised Statutes ( HRS) § 378-32(2) (1993).1  
Coca-Cola respond ed on October 7, 2010, denying the allegations 
and arguing that Josue’s claim was u ntimely. 
                     
 1 HRS § 378-32(2) (1993) , which has since been recodified as HRS § 
378-32(a)(2), provide d in relevant part as follows: 
It shall be unlawful for any employer to suspend, 
discharge, or discriminate against any of the employer ’s 
employees:  
 . . . 
(2) Solely because the employee has suffered a work 
injury which arose out of and in the course of the 
employee ’s employment with the employer and which is 
compensable under chapter 386 unless the employee is 
no longer capable of performing the employee ’s work 
as a result of the work injury and the employer has 
no other available work which the employee is capable 
of performing.  Any employee who is discharged 
because of the work injury shall be given first 
preference of reemployment by the employer in any 
position which the employee is capable of performing 
and which becomes available after the discharge and 
during the period thereafter until the employee 
secures new employment.  
In the interest of clarity, this opinion will refer to the statute as HRS § 
378-32(2), which is the codification applicable to the alleged  discrimination 
in this case. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

   An administrative hearing on the complaint  commenced 
on February 7, 2011 .  Josue testified that she  began working at 
Coca-Cola in 2000 as a full -service driver  and later received a 
promotion to full-service supervisor .  On May 29, 2009, Josue 
stated, she suffered an injury during the course of her 
employment .  Josue explained that she was unable to work as a 
result of this injury and was placed on a leave of absence in 
accordance with Coca -Cola’s disability leave policy.   Josue 
testified that  she attempted to resume her employment  on 
September 1, 2010, the day  after her doctor authorized her to 
return to work with no restrictions , but she was informed that  
Coca-Cola had hired an employee to permanently fill her 
position .  Coca-Cola the reafter offered Josue several other 
positions with the company, but Josue testified that  these 
offers were rejected because s he either could not meet the 
physical requirements  of the position s due to a prior shoulder 
injury, the positions required experience or certifications that 
she did not possess, or the  positions  were downgrades from her 
pre-injury employment . 
  Coca-Cola called two witnesses: a human resources 
manager and Josue’s supervisor.   The human resources manager 
testified that , during Josue’ s absenc e, she received a request ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
5 
 from Josue’s supervisor that the position be filled .2  The 
manager stated that, after Josue’s position had been vacant for 
ten months, Coca-Cola hired a permanent replacement in April 
2010.3  The vacancy had been  creating a hardship, the manager 
explained, because two other supervisors were covering Josue’s 
job duties in addition to performing their own.  Josue’s 
supervisor added that the two individuals providing coverage 
were required to adjust their schedules by arriving to work
 two 
hours prior to the time that they typically arrived.   
 
 When asked by the hearing officer about the internal 
process behind hiring a permanent replacement to fill Josue’s 
position, the manager refused to answer 
because she said that 
the process was “confidential” and “privileged.”   The manager 
stated, however, that the company did not have any information 
regarding whether Josue was capable or incapable of returning to 
work when it hired Josue’s replacement.  The manager testified 
that Coca- Cola’s disability leave policy, which allowed an 
employee to take a twelve- month leave of absence after a work 
injury, does not state  that the injured employee’s job will 
remain open for those 12 months, but rather merely provides that 
the employee’s benefits end after twelve months.   
                     
 2 Josue’s supervisor testified that he did not submit a request to 
fill Josue’s position.  
 3 The replacement was a former employee who held Josue’s position 
immediately prior to Josue.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
6 
   In her post -hearing brief,  Josue argued that Coca-Cola 
violated HRS § 378-32(2) by failing to return her to the 
position she had previously held when she was capable of 
returning to work  after suffering a workplace injury.  This 
amounted to unlawful discrimination based solely on an injury 
that arose from her employment, she contended, a nd any argument 
that the company  filled the position for business reasons was 
pretextual.  In response, Coca-Cola asserted that its failure to 
reinstate Josue to her former position had nothing to do with 
her work injury , but rather was the result of  the company 
filling the position more than four months prior to when Josue 
was medically released to return to work.   Additionally , Coca-
Cola argued, nothing in the language or legislative history of 
HRS § 378-32(2) required it to keep Josue’s position vacant 
indefinitely  or return her to her same position after she was 
medically cleared to work.  
  On August 1, 2011, t he hearing officer  issued a  
Recommended Decision  stating that Coca -Cola’s failure to return 
Josue to her position was contrary to the purpose of HRS § 378-
32(2).  The hearing officer  determined that the statute did not 
require Coca -Cola to keep Josue’s positi on open indefinitely , 
but it did make it unlawful “for an employer to discriminate 
against an employee in conditions or terms of employment when 
the employee has been released to return to work full duty, no 
restrictions to the position occupied at the tim e of the work ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
7 
 injury.”   Because Coca- Cola knew or should have known that Josue 
would one day be able to return to work without restrictions, 
the hearing officer concluded, the company should have filled 
her position with a temporary replacement that was subject to 
her right to return.  Thus, the hearing officer  determined that 
Coca-Cola discriminated against Josue solely because of a 
compensable work injury in violation of HRS 
§ 378-32(2) and 
recommended that Josue be returned to the position that she held 
before suffering her injury.  
2. Director 
  Coca- Cola appealed the Recommended Decision to the 
Director of the Hawai‘i Department of Labor and Industrial 
Relations (the Director).   Coca-Cola again argued that the plain 
language of HRS § 378- 32(2) did not prevent it from hiring a 
replacement nor did it require the company to return Josue to 
her pre-work related injury position.  Specifically, Coca-Cola 
argued that the “[s] olely because” language in the statute meant 
that the work injury must be the only reason for the employment 
action, and here the reason for not reinstating Josue was that a 
replacement was hired due to the business hardship inherent in 
requiring other employees to perform the duties of the position 
while Josue was absent.  (Citing Fergerstrom v. Datapoint Corp., 
680 F. Supp. 1456, 1459 (D. Haw. 1988).)  Thus, Coca -Cola 
concluded, the Recommended Decision was clearly erroneous 
because the company’s failure to return Josue to her prior ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
8 
 position was motivated by legitimate, business concerns.   
  The Director,  in his Decision and Order,  noted that 
when the legislature added the term “discriminat e” to HRS § 378-
32(2) in 1981, it made unlawful  the practice of reassigning an 
employee to a position with other duties at a lower rate of pay 
after the injured employee returned to work.  (Citing S. Stand. 
Comm. Rep. No. 782, in 1981 Senate Journal, at 12 49.)  Here, the 
Director stated, Josue was not returned to her pre-injury 
position, but instead was offered other positions that were 
either downgrades or positions 
for which Josue did not meet the 
requirements.  The Director agreed with the hearing officer that 
although Coca-Cola shoul d not be required to hold Josue’s 
position open indefinitely, it could have satisfied its business 
concerns by filling the position with a temporary employee.  By 
instead hiring a permanent employee to fill Josue’s position,  
the Director determined, Coca -Cola became unable to return Josue 
to her pre-injury position “solely because she suffered a work 
injury in violation of section 3 78-32.”  The Director’s Decision 
and Order thus adopted the hearing officer’s Recommended 
Decision that Coca
-Cola discriminated against Josue  solely 
because of her work injury when it failed to return her to the 
position that she held at the time of her injury. 
B. Circuit Court Proceedings 
  Coca -Cola appealed the Director’s Decision and Order 
to the Circuit C ourt of the First Circuit (circuit court) and ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
9 
 argued that it was improper for the Director to rely on 
legislative history 
because the language of the statute wa s 
unambiguous.   But even if reliance on the legislative history 
was proper, Coca- Cola asserted, it did not support the 
conclusion that refusing to terminate a replacement employee to 
open the injured employee’s position is discrimination.  In 
response, Josue contended that the purpose of the statute is to 
protect employees from retaliatory discharge, and therefore the 
Director’s decision comported with the text and purpose of the 
statute.  (Citing Purchert v. Agsalud, 67 Haw. 25 , 35, 677 P.2d 
449, 457 (1984).)   The Department also responded to Coca-Cola, 
arguing that the Director did not err in concluding that Coca-
Cola discriminated against Josue
 because the company’s hiring of 
a permanent replacement was not an independent, non-
discriminatory, and lawful reason for its refusal to return 
Josue to her pre-injury position.   4
  T he circuit court determined  that there was no dispute 
that Josue was discriminated against.  The court found, however, 
that the discrimination “was not because of a work -related 
injury, but it was because the position had been filled.”   In 
addition, the court stated that “to only look at the 
[legislative history] without look ing at any references as to 
                     
 4 The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
10 
 what constitutes discrimination is . . . untenable.”   The court 
therefore concluded that Coca- Cola did not violate HRS § 378 -
32(2).  Accordingly, t he court reversed the Director’s decision.    
C. ICA Proceedings 
  Josue and the Department each appealed the circuit 
court decision to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA).  
Josue argued that Coca-Cola’s interpretation of the “ [s]olely 
because” clause was incorrect because it could have satisfied 
its operational concerns by filling the position with a 
replacement that was subject to Josue’s right to return.  
Similarly, the Department argued that although Coca- Cola cited 
operational hardship as t he reason for filling Josue’s position, 
it produced no evidence as to why it could not temporarily, 
rather than permanently, have filled Josue’s position.  Coca-
Cola responded that it did not discriminate “ [s]olely because” 
of Josue’s work injury because it filled Josue’s position due to 
“operation concerns” and therefore the circuit court did not 
err.  (Quoting Fergerstrom, 680 F. Supp. at 1458.) 
  In a memorandum opinion, the ICA affirmed the circuit 
court’s decision that Coca -Cola’s actions did not violate HRS § 
378-32(2).5  Although the court determined  that Coca -Cola 
                     
 5 The ICA’s memorandum opinion may be found at BCI Coca -Cola 
Bottling Company of Los Angeles v. Hoshijo, No.CAAP -0001135, 2018 WL 4659561 
(Haw. App. Sept. 28, 2018).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
11 
 discriminated against Josue,  the ICA stated  that the term 
“[s]olely” was unambiguous and that a violation of HRS § 378-
32(2) clearly requires that the work injury be the sole cause of 
the adverse employment action to run afoul of the statute.
  The 
ICA held that the Director’s conclusion that Coca -Cola 
discriminated against Josue “[s]olely because” of her work 
injury was clearly erroneous because Josue’s absence was 
creating a hardship f
or the company by requiring  two other 
supervisors to work extra hours to perform Josue’s job duties .  
The ICA thus concluded that “business necessity was also a 
reason for [Coca-Cola’s] actions and there was no indication 
that the justification was pretext
ual.” 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW 
  We review findings of facts and mixed questions of law 
and fact under the “clearly erroneous” standard and we review 
conclusions of law de novo  “to determine if the agency’s  
decision was in violation of constitutional or statutory 
provisions, in excess of statutory authority or jurisdiction of 
agency, or affected by other error of law .”  In re Water Use 
Permit Applications, 94 Hawai i 97, 119, 9 P.3d 409, 431 (2000) 
(quoting Curtis v. Bd. of Appeals, 90 Hawaii 384, 392- 93, 978 
P.2d 822, 830-31 (1999)); Price v. Zoning Bd. of City & Cty. of 
Honolulu, 77 Hawai i 168, 172, 883 P.2d 629, 633 (1994).  A 
finding of fact is clearly erroneous when “ (1) the record lacks ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
12 
 substantial evidence to support the finding or determination, or 
(2) despite substantial evidence to support the finding or 
determination, the appellate court is left with the definite and 
firm conviction that a mistake has been made. ”  In re Water Use 
Permit Applications, 94 Hawai i at 119, 9 P.3d at 431. 
III. DISCUSSION 
A. Coca-Cola Discriminated Against  Josue 
  Under HRS § 378- 32(2), it is unlawful for an employer 
“to suspend, discharge, or discriminate against any of the 
employer’s employees  . . . [s]olely because the employee has 
suffered a work injury which arose out of and in the course of 
the employee’s employment with the employer .”  Unlike the terms 
“suspend” and “discharge,” which denote specific employment-
related actions, it is unclear on the face of the statute what 
type of employer action constitutes discrimination in this 
context.6  The term “discrimination” is not included in the 
applicable definitions provided in HRS § 378 -31 (1993), and the 
Department has not issued any regulations providing guidance on 
how to interpret the term.7  Because the term “discriminate”  is 
                     
 6 According to Black’s Law Dictionary, “discrimination” generally 
means “a failur e to treat all persons equally when no reasonable distinction 
can be found between those favored and those not favored.”  Black’s Law 
Dictionary  566 (10th ed. 2014).  
 7 Chapter 378 addresses discriminatory employment practices 
generally and provides enumerated examples of other forms of discrimination.  
For example, HRS § 378 -2 (1993 & Supp. 1995 ) provides that various employment 
decisions amount to unlawful discriminatory acts when made on the basis of 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
13 
 not defined and because the statute is not clear as to what form 
of employer action amounts to  discrimination on the basis of a 
work injury, an ambiguity exists regarding the meaning of the 
term.  When such ambiguity exists, “the meaning of the ambiguous 
word[] may be sought by
 . . . resort[ing] to extrinsic aides in 
determining legislative intent” such as the legislative history 
of the statute.  Gillan v. Gov’t Emps. Ins. Co. , 119 Hawai i 109, 
124-25, 194 P.3d 1071, 1086-87 (2008) (quoting State v. 
Toyomura, 80 
Hawaii 8, 19, 904 P.2d 893, 904 (1995)).  
  Prior to 1981, HRS § 378 -32(2) did not contain the 
term “discriminate,” but instead provided that “[i]t shall be 
unlawful for any employer to suspend or discharge any of his 
employees . .  . [s]olely because the employee suffered a work 
injury.”8  1970 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 64, § 2 at 121.  In 1981, the 
                                                                 
(. . . continued) 
 
race, sex, religion, or other protected characteristic , including “to refuse 
to hire or employ or to bar or discharge from employment”; “to fail or refuse 
to refer to employment”; and “to exclude or otherwise deny equal jobs or 
benefits to a qualified individual .”  HRS §§ 378 -2(1)(A), 378- 2(1)(B), 378 -
2(6).  The chapter does not contain a similar detailed enumeration of 
employment actions that constitute discrimination on the basis of work 
injury. 
 8 This provision was originally codified in the worker’s 
compensation statute, but in 1970 the legislature moved the provision into 
the title of the HRS relating to the Department of Labor and Industrial 
Relations.  H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 253 -70, in 1970 House Journal, at 859.  
The statute was moved because the legislature recognized that it was 
“inappropriately  part of the Workmen’s Compensation Law” which was “neither 
concerned with nor staffed to carry on an enforcement program, while the 
[Department of Labor and Industrial Relations] is structured so as to 
implement the policy and purpose of the law.”  Id. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
14 
 legislature amended the statute by adding discrimination to 
types of conduct that are prohibited when undertaken solely 
because of an 
employee’s injury .  See 1981 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 
10, § 1 at 29.  The purpose of this amendment was explained in 
both a House and Senate Standing Committee report as follows:
 
The purpose of this bill is to specify discrimination as an 
unlawful employment practice and to specifically allow the 
Department of Labor and I ndustrial Relations to order 
reinstatement to the prior position of an employee 
discharged in violation of section 378- 32, Hawaii Revised 
Statutes.  
Current law prohibits suspension or discharge of an 
employee who has suffered from a work injury or has filed 
for bankruptcy or because the employer was summoned as a 
garnishee.  However, an employee can be downgraded, 
reassigned to other duties at a lower rate of pay, or 
otherwise be discriminated against in conditions or terms 
of employment  under the above circumstances without 
violating the law.  This bill provides further protection 
to the employee in such cases by making such discrimination 
unlawful.  
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 782, in 1981 Senate Journal, at 1249  
(emphasis added); accord H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 580, in 1981 
House Journal, at 1179.  These committee reports demonstrate 
that the addition of discrimination as an unlawful act sought to 
address a loophole in the statute that allowed  an employer to 
“downgrade” or “reassign[]”  an employee “to other duties at a 
lower rate of pay” after the employee “has suffered from a work 
injury.”  Thus, the legislative history indicates that the 
intent of the statute is to protect employees that have suffered 
work injuries from adverse employment action by preserving the 
employee’s position u ntil the employee is able to return to work ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
15 
 or by placing the employee in a comparable position upon the 
employee’s return.
 
 
 It is undisputed that Josue suffered a work injury and 
was placed on a leave of absence pursuant to Coca-Cola’s 
disability leave policy.  It is also uncontroverted that Coca -
Cola did not reinstate Josue to a position equivalent to or 
better than her pre-injury position upon her return to work 
after the injury, but instead the company offered her only 
positions that she either could not perform or that amounted to 
downgrades from her prior employment.   Such a decision is  the 
precise kind of adverse employment action that prompted the 
legislature to specifically add the term “discriminate” to  HRS § 
378-32(2) to prohibit.   See S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 782, in 9
                     
 9 The briefing before the ICA and the ICA’s Memorandum Opinion 
addressed the issue of whether Josue’s complaint was timely , which turned on 
when the alleged discrimination occurred.  Although the issue of timeliness 
is not directly raised before us, we must nonetheless decide what action 
actually constituted discrimination under HRS § 378 -32(2) to resolve this 
case.  The discrimination necessarily occurred on the day that Josue 
returned--and not when the company hired a permanent replacement--because 
that is when the
 employment action adversely affected  Josue.  Indeed, had 
Coca-Cola discharged the employee that was hired to replace Josue or offered 
Josue a position that was at least equivalent to her pre -injury position when 
she returned to work, no discrimination would have occurred.   
  Further, H RS § 378-32(2) contained a limited exception that 
allows an employer to “suspend, discharge, or discriminate against” an 
employee “[s]olely because the employee has suffered a work injury” if “the 
employee is no longer capable of performing the employee’s work as a result 
of the work injury and the employer has no other available work which the 
employee is capable of performi ng.”  If the discriminatory behavior 
prohibited by HRS § 378 -32(2) was found to occur when an employer makes an  
adverse employment decision rather than when the decision adversely affects 
the employee, it would incentivize employers to 
make adverse employment 
decisions as quickly as possible after a work injury occurs .
  Under such a 
formulation, the employer would be able to bypass the protections afforded by 
the statute if the still -healing injury rendered the employee incapable of 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
16 
 1981 Senate Journal, at 12 49; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 580, in 
1981 House Journal, at 1179.   Thus, Coca- Cola’s actions in this 
case constituted discrimination under HRS § 378-32(2), and this 
case instead turns on whether the discrimination was undertaken 
“[s]olely” on the basis of Josue’s work injury .10 
                                                                 
(. . . continued) 
 
performing the employee’s preinjury duties or those of an equivalent or 
better position at the time the adverse employment decision was made, 
regardless of whether the employee would eventually regain a full capacity 
for work.   Thus, the employment action must be evaluated from the point at 
which the employee is denied reinstatement to an equivalent or better 
position upon returning to work in order to effectuate HRS § 378 -32(2)’s 
purpose of protecting employees who are injured during the course of their 
work.  In the present case, it is undisputed that  Josue’s doctor medically 
cleared her to work without restriction prior to the alleged discrimination . 
 10 During oral argument, Coca -Cola contended that it did not 
discriminate against Josue under HRS § 378-32(2) because it was properly 
following the “reasonable accommodation” procedures mandated by the Ame ricans 
with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Oral Argument, BCI Coca -Cola Bottling Company 
of Los Angeles v. Murakami  (SCWC-14-0001135) at 01:00:45 -01:01:07, 
http://oaoa.hawaii.gov/jud/oa/19/SCOA_041019_SCWC -14-1135.mp3.  This argument 
was raised before the Director and the circuit court but was not raised 
before the hearing officer, ICA, or before this court prior to oral argument.  
Even if this argument were properly before us, it is inapt here.  Coca -Cola’s 
requirements under federal law are wholly separate from its requirements 
under HRS § 378 -32(2), and  Coca-Cola’s compliance with the ADA does not 
abdicate its legal duty to comply with HRS § 378 -32(2).  Nor does the ADA 
preempt HRS § 378 -32(2) because the two statutes do not conflict.  See 
Cipollone v. Liggett Grp., Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 516 (1992).  Under the 
regulations implementing the ADA, it is unlawful for an employer “not to make 
reasonable accommodation to the known physical  or mental limitations of an 
otherwise qualified . . . employee with a disability,” and such an 
accommodation includes “[j]ob restructuring” and “reassignment to a vacant 
position.”  29 C.F.R. §§ 1630.9(a), 1630.2(o)(2)(ii).  An employer can 
fulfill its federal requirements while fulfilling its requirements under HRS 
§ 378-32(2) because, as explained, the  Hawaii statute does not prohibit an 
employer from reassigning an employee to a position that is not a downgrade.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 B. In the Absence of True Business Necessity, Discrimination for 
Business Reasons is Discrimination “Solely Because” of a Work 
Injury 
  Determining that Coca- Cola discriminated against Josue 
does not end the inquiry of whether the c ompany violated HRS § 
378-32(2) because the statute only prohibits discrimination when 
it is done “[s]olely because the employee has suffered a work 
injury.”  That is, an employer does  not violate the statute if 
it discriminates against an employee for a legitimate reason 
other than the employee’s work injury .  However, HRS § 378-
32(2), like other statutes prohibiting discrimination, 
“proscribes not only overt discrimination but also practices 
that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation. ”  Adams 
v. CDM Media USA, Inc., 135 Hawaii 1, 26 n.29, 346 P.3d 70, 95 
n.29 (2015) (quoting Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,  401 U.S. 424, 431 
(1971)) (analogizing discrimination under HRS § 378-2, which 
prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex, and other 
protected characteristics, to discrimination under Title VII of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1965)) .   
  In Adams, we explained that if an employer’s  
discriminatory action “cannot be shown t o be related to” a 
legitimate reason such as “job performance, the practice is 
prohibited.”  Id. (emphasis omitted).  Accordingly , “[a] 
‘legitimate’ reason must be one that is justifiable in view of ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 11the purpose of the [statute.]”   Id. at 15, 346 P.3d at 84 
(quoting Hill v. Miss. Stat e Emp’t Serv., 918 F.2d 1233, 1243 –44 
(5th Cir. 1990) (Rubin, J., dissenting) (second alteration in 
original)). 
  HRS § 378-32(2) was enacted specifically to protect a 
vulnerable subset of employees- -those who suffer work injuries- -
by ensuring that they are restored to their position or placed 
in a commensurate position when they return from a work- related 
injury.   S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 782, in 1981 Senate Journal, 
at 1249; H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 580, in 1981 House Journal, at 
1179.  Indeed, this court has explained that “the legislative 
intent of HRS § 378-32(2) is to protect [employees],”  Puchert v. 
Agsalud, 67 Haw. 25, 36, 677 P.2d 449, 457 (1984)
, from 
discharge, suspension, and discrimination in relation to the 
employee’s compensable work injury.  Takaki v. Allied Machinery 
Corp., 87 Hawai i 57, 64, 951 P.2d 507, 514 (App. 1998); see also 
Hummel v. Kamehameha Schs./Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate, 749 F. 12
                     
 11 “Legitimate ” is defined by Black’s Law Dictionary as “lawful” or 
“genuine.”  Black’s Law Dictionary  1040 (10th ed. 2014).  
 12 In its current form, HRS § 378-32 also protects employees from 
being suspended, discharged, discriminated against, and demoted in several 
other circumstances.  The statute provides that an employee will not be 
penalized as a direct consequence of filing a petition against an employer 
for wages, testifying or being subpoenaed to testify in a discrimination 
proceeding, testing positive for the presence of drugs or alcohol in a 
“substance abuse on- site screening test,” or using available sick leave.  HRS 
§ 378-32(a)(1)- (4), (b)  (2015).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
19 
 Supp. 1023, 1027 (D. Haw. 1990) (“The purpose of HRS § 378-32(2) 
is to protect [employees.]”).    
 
 In light of this purpose, for an employer to 
demonstrate a “legitimate reason” for a discriminatory 
employment action that was allegedly based on the needs of the 
business, an employer must first adduce evidence that , at the 
time the position was filled , the vacancy at issue impaired the 
employer’s business operations.   Adams, 135 Hawai i at 26 n.29, 
346 P.3d at 95 n.29 (explaining that when evaluating whether a 
discriminatory employment action is related to a legitimate 
reason, “
[t]he touchstone is business necessity .”); see also 
Frank’s Shoe Store v. W. Va. Human Rights Comm’n , 365 S.E.2d 
251, 258 n.3 ( W. Va. 1986) (rejecting an  employer’s contention 
that its action of downgrading an employee because she became 
pregnant was “ necessary for efficient operations of the 
business” because there was no “impair[ment of] business 
operations”).   This burden falls on the employer  because, as a 
practical matter, only the employer would possess all the 
information necessary to demonstrate a business impairment.  See 
Frank v. Am. Freight Sys., Inc., 398 N.W.2d 797, 802 (Iowa 1987) 
(“[T]he burden of showing a business necessity for the 
discrimination is upon the [] employer.”).  
  Additionally,  to demonstrate a legitimate reason for 
the adverse employment action, the employer must produce ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
20 
 evidence that the proffered justification for the action was the 
only reasonable means
 by which to remedy the employer’s business 
impairment.   See Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U.S. 228, 243 
(2005) (noting that the  “business necessity” test requires a 
showing that “there are [no] other ways for the employer to 
achieve its goals that do not result in” discrimination) .  When 
reasonable alternative methods  of relieving the business 
impairment exist that do not involve taking adverse employment 
action against the injured employee, 
HRS § 378- 32(2) obliges an 
employer to use one of these means rather than discriminating.  
Otherwise, an employee would be subject to a demotion or other 
adverse employment action  despite the employee’s value to the 
business--as shown by the business impairment caused by the 
employee’s absence --solely because the employee had the 
misfortune of becoming injured as a result of the job.  Such an 
outcome would provide no real protection to employees and would 
contravene the purpose of the statute.  Accordingly , an employer 
must prove that there were no feasible alternatives to the 
discriminatory employment action.  1413
                     
 13 As with demonstrating a business impairment, the employer is best 
situated to produce the business information necessary to justify its 
decision, and the burden of demonstrating a lack of reasonable alternatives 
must thus fall upon the employer.  Placing the burden on the employee would 
not only be burdensome, but it would also likely involve extensive discovery 
that could lead to protracted and contentious litigation.  
 14 Federal courts utilize similar principles under federal 
employment discrimination law.  See Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557, 578 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
21 
 Identifying a business impairment and determining 
whether it could have been alleviated through the use of a 
feasible alternative is a fact -bound inquiry that will vary 
based on the circumstances of the case.  For example, a  
necessary consideration will often be the employer’s  knowledge 
of the anticipated length of the  injured employee’s absence.  
When an employer  who is suffering a business impairment from an 
employee’s absence  knows that the employee will return from 
injury-related leave in a matter of weeks or months, then 
filling the position with a temporary employee  or having another 
employee cover the absent employee’s duties  may be a suitable 
alternative to filling it with a permanent employee.  On the 
other hand, if an employer learns that the  employee will be 
absent indefinitely or for an extended duration, the n preserving 
the injured employee’s  right to return to the employee’s  
                                                                 
(. . . continued) 
 
(2009) (explaining that the business necessity defense under the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964 may be defeated by a showing of “a legitimate alternative that 
would have resulted in less discrimination”); Wards Cove Packing Co., Inc. v. 
Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 658 (1989), superseded by statute, Civil Rights Act of 
1991, Pub. L. No. 102 -166, 105 Stat. 1074, as recognized in Raytheon Co. v. 
Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44 (2003) (holding that proof of a legitimate business 
justification requires “first, a consideration of the justifications an 
employer offers for his use of [its] practices; and second, the availability 
of alternative practices to achieve the same business ends, with less 
[discriminatory] impact”); Clady v. L.A. Cty., 770 F.2d 1421, 1428 (9th Cir. 
1985) (“[T]he [employment decision] does not constitute a business necessity 
[when] an alternative selection device exists which would have comparable 
business utility and less adverse impact.”); Blake v. City of L.A., 595 F.2d 
1367, 1383 (9th Cir. 1979) (holding that “ [e]ven if an employer meets his 
burden of demonstrating business n ecessity, Title VII plaintiffs may prevail 
if” there are “alternative  selection devices [] available that would serve 
the employer’s legitimate interests without discriminatory effects”).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
22 
 position or a nother position that is not a downgrade may not be 
feasible given the difficult ies of covering  the absent 
employee’s duties for a prolonged or indefinite period.   Thus, 
the employer’s knowledge of the anticipated length of an 
employee’s absence is often critical in the employer’s  
evaluation of reasonable alternatives .  Specific alternatives, 
depending on the circumstances, may include filling the vacant 
position with a temporary employee, having  another employee or 
employees cover the duties of the position, or hold ing open an 
equivalent or better position  that does not create a business 
impairment.  If any of these or another nondiscriminatory 
alternative is feasible,  then the employer is required to 
utilize it  rather than discriminating against the injured 
employee.15 
 
 In sum, an employer’s alleged discriminatory 
employment action must be related to a legitimate reason for the 
adverse action, which the employer has the burden to prove.  An 
employer may demonstrate that its discriminatory employment 
action did not violate HRS § 378-32(2) by presenting evidence to 
show that the vacancy caused operational impairment  to the 
business that justified filling the position at the time that it 
                     
 15 In enacting HRS § 378- 32(2), the legislature recognized that 
small businesses may be more significantly affected by the absence of an 
injured employee.  The legislature addressed this situation by providing that 
the subsection “shall not apply to an employer in whose employment there are 
less than three employees at the  time of the work injury.”  HRS § 378-32(2).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
23 
 was filled and that there was  no feasible alternative to the 
adverse employment action that would have rectified the 
impairment. 
C. The Director’s Decision Was Not Clearly Erroneous  
  
As stated, we review findings of facts of an agency 
under the “clearly erroneous” standard.  In re Water Use Permit 
Applications, 94 Hawai i 97, 119, 9 P.3d 409, 431 (2000).  Thus, 
we will uphold the Director’s findings of fact in the case 
unless “the record lacks substantial evidence to support the 
finding or determination” or we are otherwise “ left with the 
definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made .”  Id. 
  Here , the Director found that,  after Josue suffered a 
work-related injury and while she was on an approved leave of 
absence, Coca-Cola filled her position without knowing whether 
Josue would be able to return to work
.  And when Josue did 
return to work without any restrictions, the company refused to 
reinstate her to her pre
-injury position or an equivalent or 
better job that she could actually perform.  Based on these 
facts, the Director concluded that Coca
-Cola discriminated 
against Josue.  Additionally, the Director concluded that Coca-
Cola could have satisfied its business concerns and the 
requirements of HRS § 378-32(2) by filling the position with a 
temporary replacement that was subject to Josue’s right to 
return to her position. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
24 
   To de monstrate that it did not discriminate “ [s]olely 
because” of Josue’s work injury, Coca-Cola first needed to 
present evidence that Josue’s vacancy caused a business 
impairment.  A human resource manager for Coca- Cola testified 
that Josue’s absence  was creat ing a hardship for her  department 
because other supervisors were being required to come to work 
two hours early to perform Josue’s work duties  in addition to 
their own.  Yet there is no clear evidence in the record that 
the other supervisors did not wish to perform this work for 
additional compensation, that providing additional pay to the 
other supervisors posed a financial burden to the business, or 
that the arrangement was otherwise impairing Coca- Cola’s 
business operations.  The evidence  is thus unclear as to whether  
business operations were being adversely affected by Josue’s 
absence.   
 
 In any event, i t is ultimately unnecessary for this 
court to decide whether Coca- Cola successfully established that 
Josue’s absence was causing a business impairment in light of 
the Director’s finding that feasible alternatives existed to 
Coca-Cola’s hiring of a permanent replacement.16  As explained, 
                     
 16 The ICA cited Fergerstrom v. Datapoint Corp., 680 F. Supp. 1456 
(D. Haw. 1988), in support of its holding that Coca -Cola’s decision was not 
“[s]olely because” of Josue’s work injury.  In Fergerstrom, an employee 
suffered a work injury and went on a leave of absence from work.  Id.  at 
1457.  Nine months later, while the employee was still on leave, the employer 
notified the employee that he had been “administratively terminated” because 
of the company’s policy of terminating any employee who had been on a leave 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
25 
 to prove that it had a legitimate reason for its discrimination, 
Coca-Cola was required to demonstrate not only that Josue’s 
absence resulted in a business impairment, but also that there 
were no feasible alternatives to remedy the impairment that 
would not preclude Josue’s ret urn to her  position or its 
equivalent.  Accordingly, Coca-Cola  was required to prove that 
there were no feasible alternatives to hiring a permanent 
replacement that resulted in the denial of Josue’s 
reinstatement.  When the hearing officer asked what the 
company’s process was to fill Josue’s position, the manager 
responded that information about the decision-making process was 
privileged and confidential.  
Coca-Cola did not present any 
evidence as to why a temporary replacement or other alternative 
would not have sufficiently addressed Coca- Cola’s business 
concerns.   
                                                                 
(. . . continued) 
 
of absence for more than ninety days.  Id.  The district court held that the 
termination did not violate HRS §  378-32(2) because the employee was 
terminated “by operation of the Administrative D ischarge Policy, not solely 
because of his injury.”  Id. at 1458.   
  We disagree with the analysis applied by the Fergerstrom  court.  
As explained, a discriminatory employment action must be related to a 
legitimate reason, which in this context is a business impairment.  Adams, 
135 Hawai i at 26 n.29, 346 P.3d at 95 n.29 (quoting Griggs, 401 U.S. at 431).  
An employer’s blanket administrative termination policy, whether of a 
duration of one day, ninety days, or a year, does not, on its own, 
demonstrate a business impairment.  Instead, an employer must provide 
evidence, on a case- by-case basis, that the employee’s absence caused a 
business impairment and that there were no feasible alternatives to the 
adverse employment action.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
26 
   Indeed, t he lack of evidence of  the company’s  
consideration of feasible alternative s is underscored by the 
fact that  the company did not contact Josue until after it had 
filled her po sition with a permanent replacement .  Coca-Cola had 
no indication  of whether Josue would be able  to work without 
restrictions  and, if so, the anticipated time frame  when this 
would occur .  Under the circumstances, Coca-Cola could not have 
evaluated the feasibility of alternatives  without this 
information .   
  Coca-Cola had the burden to prove that there was no 
feasible alternative to hiring a permanent replacement for 
Josue.  However, the record lacks any evidence that a temporary 
employee would not have been able to fulfill Josue’s duties 
during her leave of absence due to her work -related injury --nor 
even that Coca -Cola considered the possibility .  The Director 
concluded tha t in light of the evidentiary record , a temporary 
employee could have addressed Coca-Cola’s business concerns , and 
the company was thus not justified in discriminating against 
Josue in the manner it did .  There was substantial evidence in 
the record to sup port the conclusion that Coca -Cola failed to 
meet its burden  to prove that there were no feasible 
alternatives to refusing to reinstate Josue to  a position at 
least equivalent to  the one she left  because of her work ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
27 
 injury.17  Thus, the Director’s finding s were not clearly 
erroneous, and its conclusions of law were correct .  The 
Director’s decision should have been affirmed, and it was error 
for the ICA to hold otherwise.  
IV. CONCLUSION 
  Based on the foregoing, we vacate the ICA’s Judgment 
on Appeal, vacate the circuit court’s  judgment, affirm the 
Director’s Decision  and Order , and remand the case to the 
Director for any appropriate proceedings consistent with this 
opinion.

 17 During oral argument, the Department argued, for the first time, 
that Coca- Cola was required to keep Josue’s position vacant until a medical 
determination about her ability to return to work was made under the worker’s 
compensation statute.  Oral Argument, BCI Coca -Cola Bottling Company of Los 
Angeles v. Murakami (SCWC-14-0001135) at 00:2 3:00-00:23:20,

argument was properly raised, however, it lacks merit because, as explained, 
an employer may fill the position with a permanent employee if the vacancy 
caused a business impairment and there were no feasible alternatives to  
utilizing a permanent replacement .
