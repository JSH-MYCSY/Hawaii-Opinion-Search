 I. Introduction  
This consolidated appeal arises from the fourth and sixth 
in a series of six appeals from a lawsuit in the Circuit Court 
of the Second Circuit
 (referred to as “the circuit court”  unless 
relevant to this appeal) .  The parties are Michael J. Szymanski 
(“Szymanski”), Wailea Resort Company (“Wailea”) , and ADOA -Shinwa 
Development and Shinwa Golf Hawai ʻi Company (collectively 
“Shinwa”).  The 
litigation concerns a dispute arising from a 
1999 contract regarding the sale of 
approximately twenty-three 
acres of land in Ho nualua, Maui (“the Property”).    
Szymanski’ s application for writ of certiorari 
(“Application”)  raises seven questions.1  Five of Szymanski’ s 
questions relate to whether the Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo’s 
(“Judge Loo”) interest in Alexander & Baldwin ( “A & B”), which 
she had disclosed in financial disclosure statements but not on 
the record in the lawsuit, required her recusal.  We hold the 
ICA did not err in its application of the “law of the case” 
doctrine to refuse further consideration of Judge Loo’s recusal 
because the issue had already been raised and decided against 
Szymanski in the third appeal and no cogent reasons, patent 
error, or exceptional circumstances existed to set aside its 
                                                           
1  See Section II(D), infra. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
3 
 prior rulings.  
Therefore, Szy manski’s questions relating to  the 
disqualification of Judge Loo are without merit. 
Szymanski  also asks whether the ICA gravely erred when it 
declined to review whether the Honorable Peter T. Cahill’s 
(“Judge Cahill”)  2015 order entering final judgment improperly 
dismissed with prejudice Szymanski’s third -party complaint 
against Shinwa.  We hold the ICA also did not err in its 
application of the law of the case doctrine to this issue 
because it had affirmed the 2010 Judgment that dismissed  
Szymanski’s third -party complaint in Appeal 2 and no cogent 
reasons, patent error, or exceptional circumstances existed to 
set aside its prior ruling.   
Szymanski ’s final question is whether the ICA gravely erred 
in affirming the circuit court’s order disbursing funds to 
Wailea, which was based on the ICA’s affirmance of Judge Loo’s 
2004 summary judgment orders ruling that Szymanski had breached 
the contract.  The law of the case doctrine does not apply to 
this issue.  We hold
 the ICA erred by holding Wailea was 
“clearly entitled” to the funds and by affirming the circuit 
court’s disbursal of funds  because Szymanski’s $50,000 deposit 
was not a “Downpayment” as defined by the contract.  
We therefore affirm in part, and vacate in part, the ICA’s 
October 5, 2018 judgment on appeal, and we remand this case  to ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion. 
II. Background  
A.  Factual Background  
 On May 5, 1999, Wailea  (“Seller”) and Szymanski (“Buyer”) 
entered into a Land Sales Contract (“Contract”) for the sale of 
property in Honualua, Maui.  Under the Contract, Szymanski was 
required to make specified downpayments (“ Downpayments ”) and 
deposit the balance of the full purchase price for the property 
into escrow before the closing date .  
Paragraph 1.3 of the Contract defined “Downpayments” as 
“[t]he Initial Downpayment and Additional Downpayments to be 
made by Buyer on the Purchase Price, as defined in paragraph 3.1 
and paragraph 3.2 .”  Paragraph 3 of the Contract contained the 
parties’ original agreements regarding the purchase price and 
Downpayments.   
Paragraph 22.1(a) of the Contract regarding Seller’s 
remedies on default provided,  in relevant part,  that if default 
occurred “prior to the date the Deed is filed . . . Seller’s 
sole remedy shall be to cancel this Contract, whereupon all 
rights of Buyer and duties and obligations of Seller shall 
terminate, and Seller shall be entitled to retain all of the 
Downpayments as Seller’s sole and absolute property as ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
5 
 compensation for Seller’s costs in negotiating and preparing 
this Contract and for the damage caused by the default, Buyer 
hereby agreeing tha
t the Downpayments represent fair and 
reasonable compensation to Seller for the default . . . .”  
Paragraph 3 4 of the Contract provided,  in part,  that “[a]ny 
modifications of this Contract must be in writing and signed by 
the parties thereto.”  The record d oes not reflect any 
modification to Paragraph 22.1(a) of the original Contract.   
Five successive written amendments to the Contract  were 
then signed by the parties.  Each amendment  provided that “[a] ll 
other terms and provisions of the Contract shall remain in full 
force and effect, and are unchanged by this Amendment.”    
The First Amendment and Second Amendment, in relevant part, 
extended the closing date.  The Third Amendment amended the 
entirety of Paragraph 3
 governing the purchase price, the 
Downpayments, and the closing date, but the Third Amendment was 
again superseded by the June 30, 2000 Fourth Amendment, which 
provided in relevant part as follows: 
 3.   Purchase Price
.  Buyer shall pay to Seller, in 
United States legal tender, the Purchase Price of FOUR 
MILLION FIVE  HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($4,550,000.00) 
for the Property as follows:  
 
 3.1  Initial Downpayment.  Buyer shall deposit into 
Escrow an initial downpayment (the “Initial Downpayment”) 
of FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($40,000) upon execution of the 
Contract.  THIRTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($39,000) of the 
Initial Downpayment , plus interest earned on this portion 
of the Initial Downpayment while in escrow, shall be 
refundable, if closing does not occur by June 30, 2000. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
6 
  
 3.2 Additional Downpayment.  Buyer shall deposit 
into Escrow an Additional Downpayment of  
FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($40,000) on or before  July 4, 1999.  
Such Additional Downpayment of FORT Y THOUSAND DOLLARS 
($40,000),  plus interest earned on this Additional 
Downpayment while in escrow, shall be refundable, if 
closing does not occur by April 28, 2000.   
 
3.3  Balance of Purchase.  Buyer shall pay to Seller 
the balance of the Purchase Price (Purchase Price less 
Initial Downpayment (or portion thereof) deposited into 
Escrow and inter est earned thereon), on the Closing Date.  
 
3.4 Interest on Downpayments.  All Downpayments 
shall be deposited with Escrow and shall be credited to the 
Purchase Price, unless refunded in accordance with  Sections 
3.1 and 3.2 above.  Any interest earned on the Downpayments 
while in Escrow shall be credited to Buyer at closing; 
provided, however, if the Downpayments are paid  to Seller 
because of an Event of Defaul t or because of a cancellation 
of this Contract (except as otherwise provided), all such 
interest shall be paid to Seller.  Buyer shall be 
responsible for instructing Escrow on the manner in which 
the Downpayments are to earn interest.2 
 
Paragraph 4 of the Fourth Amendment also amended the closing 
date to August 31, 2000, or “[s]uch other date as mutually 
agreed upon in writing by Seller and Buyer.”  
The September 18, 2000 Fifth Amendment extended the closing 
date to “(a) The earlier of March 3, 2001, or issuance of Final 
Subdivision Approval from the County of Maui for the Property; 
(b) That date determined by Buyer, in writing, that is between 
ten (10) working days from the date the Seller receives a 
partial release of mortgage for the Pr
operty from its mortgagee, 
which Seller agrees to obtain from its m ortgagee as soon as 
                                                           
2  As can be seen, as of the June 30, 2000 Fourth Amendment, the dates of 
the May 5, 1999 “Initial Downpayment” and July 4, 1999 “Additional 
Downpayment” had long since passed.  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
7 
 practical, and 4(a) above; or (c) Such other date as mut
ually 
agreed upon in writing by Seller and Buyer.” 
It appears that, at some point, the closing date was 
scheduled for March 30, 2001.  On April 6, 2001, Wailea sent a 
letter to Szymanski alleging  he had breached the terms of the 
Contract, as amended, by failing to deposit the balance of the 
purchase price in escrow.  Wailea stated it would extend the 
closing date to no later than April 20, 2001, provided Szymanski 
deposit an additional $49,000 
downpayment in escrow by April 11, 
2001, “of which $10,000 .00 shall not be refundable,”  and the 
remainder of the purchase price in escrow by April 14, 2001.  
The record does not
 reflect Szymanski’s written agreement  to 
this letter.  
Instead, on April 23, 2001, Szymanski deposited $50,000 
with Title Guaranty Escrow Services (“ TG Escrow ”) with a letter 
asserting he was not at fault for the delay in closing due to 
Wailea having waited until the last minute to survey the 
Property, which had revealed two encroachments, 
and indicating 
he had yet to receive a copy of the ALTA owner’s pro forma 
policy, but also stating,  “I am providing additional escrow 
funds to show my good faith in closing this purchase 
transaction . . . . Attached please find my check in the amount 
of $50,000 (FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS) to be applied towards the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
8 
 purchase price of the Wailea SF
-S parcel or its development 
costs, at my option.”  No reference to W ailea’s April 6, 2001 
letter or “Downpayment” was contained in this letter.   
It appears the parties thereafter met on May 18, 2001, and 
agreed to extend the closing date to June 8, 2001.  Closing did 
not occur on that day, however, apparently because Szym
anski had 
not deposited the balance of the purchase price into escrow and 
had not specified how title to the Property would be taken.  
Wailea then sent a letter extending the closing date to June 28, 
2001.  It appears that by July 2, 2001, only the funding issue 
remained outstanding, and Wailea offered to extend the closing 
date to July 13, 2001, with the remaining funds to be deposited 
by July 12, 2001.  When Szymanski did not deposit the remaining 
funds, Wailea sent Szymanski a letter dated July 26, 2001, 
stating he was in default and that it was electing to cancel the 
Contract. 
B.  Procedural Background 
1. Filing of lawsuit and previous appeals  
 
 In 2002, TG Escrow filed an interpleader action in circuit 
court (Civil No. 02- 1-0352(2)) to determine how it should 
disburse approximately $51,000 in escrow funds (“escrow funds” ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
9 
 3or “funds”)
, naming Wailea and Szymanski as defendants.   The 
parties then stipulated to have TG Escrow deposit the funds with 
the court clerk in an interest-bearing account.  On March 20, 
2003, the court entered a 
judgment on the interpleader claim 
pursuant to Hawai ʻi Rules of Civil Procedure (“HRCP”) Rule 54(b) 
(2000), and TG Escrow was excused from further participation. 
 Szymanski filed a cross- claim against Wailea seeking 
specific performance of the Contract, monetary damages for 
breach of contract, and equitable relief based on promissory 
estoppel.  Szymanski also filed a third-party complaint against 
Shinwa, Wailea’s parent company  that held a partial mortgage on 
the property,   seeking to enjoin Shinwa from tortiously 
interfering with Szymanski’s contractual relationship with 
Wailea.  In December 2002, Szymanski recorded a notice of lis 
pendens on the property with the Bureau of Conveyances.  
 Wailea filed a cross-claim against Szymanski seeking a 
declaratory judgment that Wailea was entitled to disbursal of 
the interpleaded escrow funds.  Wailea also sought a judgment 
declaring that Szymanski breached  the Contract by failing  to 
deposit the balance of the purchase price.  Shinwa filed a 
                                                           
3  According to Wailea and Shinwa, amendments to the Contract had allowed 
Szymanski to withdraw his previously deposited downpayments, and only $1,000 
remained in escrow as of April 23, 2001.  As noted earlier, Szymanski 
deposited an additional $50,000 in escrow on April 23, 2001.    ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
10 
 counterclaim against Szymanski asserting tortious int
erference 
with business. 
 Wailea filed  a motion for summary judgment on Szyman ski’s 
cross-claim against it .  Szymanski also filed a motion for 
partial summary judgment on counts I (specific performance) and 
III (promissory estoppel) of h is cross -claim against Wailea.  
  At the October 6, 2004 hearing on these  motions, Judge Loo 
ruled that Szymanski had failed to timely perform his 
contractual obligations,  granted Wailea’s motion, and denied 
Szymanski’s motion.  Judge Loo  entered an order on these rulings 
on October 20, 2004.  Szymanski filed a motion for 
reconsideration,  which Judge Loo denied  in a December 7, 2004 
order.  These are the only two matters in this case over which 
Judge Loo presided and are collectively referred to as “ Judge 
Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment Orders.”   
Judge Shackley Raffetto (“Judge Raffetto”) then granted 
Szymanski’s motion for HRCP Rule 54(b) certification to allow an 
interlocutory appeal as  to Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment 
Orders, and entered an  HRCP Rule 54(b) judgment on April 20, 
2005. 
 Szymanski 
filed his Rule 54(b) interlocutory appeal  from 
Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment Orders to the ICA (“Appeal 1  
re Judge’s Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment Orders ”).  On April 27, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
11 
 2009, t
he ICA filed a summary disposition order  (“SDO”) 
affirming Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment Orders , Title 
Guaranty Escrow Services , Inc. v.  Szymanski , No. 27 254, at 1 
(App. April 27, 2009) (SDO) , followed by its judgment on appeal.  
This court rejected certiorari on September 17, 2009.  
On October 28, 2009, back in the circuit court, Wailea and 
Shinwa (collectively “Wailea/Shinwa ”) filed a motion to expunge 
Szymanski’s lis pendens, for entry of final judgment based on 
the affirmance of Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment Orders 
and/or voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the remaining 
claims, and for an order directing  the clerk of the court to 
disburse the escrow funds  (“2009 Wailea/Shinwa Motion ”).  Less 
than one hour before the June 30, 2010 hearing on this motion, 
Szymanski’s attorneys filed a motion to retroactively affirm 
their withdrawal as counsel for Szymanski , which Judge Raffe tto 
granted.  Title Guaranty Services, Inc. v. Szymanski , No. 30697, 
at 2 (App. Oct. 24, 2013) (SDO) .  Judge Raffetto a lso denied 
Syzmanski’s substitute counsel’s oral request to continue the 
hearing.   
After the hearing, an order was entered on July 19, 2010 
(1) expunging Szymanski’s lis pendens; (2) for entry of final 
judgment based on the affirmance of Judge Loo’s 2004 S ummary 
Judgment Orders and/or voluntary dismissal; and (3) directing ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
12 (continued. . .)  
 disbursal of the interpleaded escrow funds to Wailea.  A “
final 
judgment” was entered on July 28, 2010 (“2010 Judgment”) 
indicating, in relevant part, that judgment was entered (1) in 
favor of Wailea on its declaratory relief and breach of contract 
claims against Syzmanski in its cross
-claim; (2) in favor of 
Wailea on all claims asserted against it by Szymanski in his 
cross-claim; and (3)  in favor of Shinwa on all claims asserted 
against it by Szymanski in his third- party complaint.      
On August 27, 2010, Szymanski appealed  from the 2010  
Judgment to the ICA (“Appeal 2 re the 2010 Judgment in favor of 
Wailea/Shinwa”) .  Szymanski raised as points of error Judge 
Raffetto’s retroactive grant of his attorney s’ motion to 
withdraw, the denial of his substitute counsel’s oral request to 
continue the hearing, and the order directing disbursal of the 
interpleaded escrow funds to Wailea.   
While Appeal 2 re the 2010 Judgment in favor of 
Wailea/Shinwa was pending, on September 19, 2011, Szymanski 
filed a HRCP Rule 60(b) m
otion seeking to vacate Judge Loo’s 
2004 Summary Judgment 
Orders.  Szymanski argued Judge Loo should 
have recused herself pursuant to Hawai ʻi Revised Code of Judicial 
Conduct (“HRCJC ”) Rule 2.11  (2008)4 and Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes 
                                                           
4  HRCJC Rule 2.11 provides, in pertinent part, “a judge shall disqualify 
or recuse himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge’s ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 5(“HRS”) § 601 -7 (2004) because she held shares of stock valued 
between $10,000 and $25,000 in A & B, as reflected in her 2003 
6and 2004 annual financial disclosures.   Counsel for Szymanski 
represented he did not discover this  stock ownership until 
7shortly before May 2011.  
 On January 4, 2012, Judge Raffe
tto entered an order denying 
the motion, ruling as follows:  
                                                                                                                                                                                          
(. . .continued)  
impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to 
[when] . . . (3) [t]he judge knows that he or she  . . . has an economic 
interest in the subject matter of the controversy or in a party to the 
proceeding.”   
 
5  HRS § 601- 7 provides , in pertinent part , that “[n]o person shall sit as 
a judge in any case in which . . . the judge has, either directly  or through 
such relative, a more than de minimis pecuniary interest  . . . .”  
 
6  Rule 15 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai ʻi 
(“RSCH”) requires all judges to 
file an annual financial disclosure statement 
identifying financial interests of the judge, the judge’s spouse or domestic 
partner, and any dependent children, to include “[t]he amount and identity of 
every ownership or beneficial interest held during the disclosure  period in 
any business incorporated, regulated, or licensed to carry on business in the 
State that has a value of $5,000 or more or that is equal to 10 percent of 
the ownership of the business  . . . .”  RSCH Rule 15(d)(2) (2017).  
 
7  The HRCP Rule 60(b)  motion was based on the following factual 
background.  In October 2003, a limited warranty deed had been recorded 
transferring the Property from Wailea to Wailea Estates.  A & B Properties 
was the listed member/manager in Wailea Estates’s business filings.  
Szymanski averred A & B Properties was owned by A & B.   
The limited warranty deed stated the transfer to Wailea Estates was 
subject to the terms and provisions contained in the December 6, 2002 lis 
pendens filed by Szymanski regarding his claim for specific performance of 
the Contract.  Szymanski argued A & B was therefore a real party in interest 
to the case and Judge Loo improperly presided over a matter in which she, as 
an A & B shareholder, would allegedly directly benefit from the outcome.  
Szymanski cited the United States Supreme Court case Liljeberg v. Health 
Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847 (1988) to argue that recusal is 
required when a judge has a financial interest in a case regardless of 
whether the judge knows of the interest, and if that interest is discovered 
later, a Rule 60(b) motion may be granted even after the case is decided on 
appeal.

  1.
 The matter is moot because the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals affirmed [Judge Loo’s Summary J udgment 
Orders] and there is no causation of any consequences to 
Mr. Szymanski from Judge Rhonda Loo’s failure to recuse 
herself in this matter;  
 2.
 Mr. Szymanski failed to show any bias by the 
Court or Judge Loo;  
 3. Mr. Szymanski failed to show any appearance of 
impropriety by the Court or Judge Loo;  
 4. Mr. Szymanski failed to show any appearance of 
bias by the Court or Judge Loo; and  
 5. No reasonable person could find that there was 
any appearance of impropriety or appearance of bias by the 
Court or Judge Loo.   
Szymanski filed a motion for reconsideration, which was heard 
and denied by the Honorable Blaine J. Kobayashi (“Judge 
Kobayashi”).  ( Judge Raffetto’s order and Judge Kobayashi’s 
order are collect ively referred to as “the 2012 Denials of the 
Motions to Vacate Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment Orders.”)  
 On August 13, 2012, Szymanski appealed the 2012 Denials of 
the Motions to V acate Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment Orders.  
(“Appeal 3 re 2012 Denials of Motions to V acate Judge Loo’s 2004 
Summary Judgment Orders ”).  The ICA initially ordered that this 
appeal be dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.  
Szymanski filed an application for writ of certiorari, which 
this court accepted on August 5, 2013. 
Then, with respect to Ap peal 2 re the 2010 Judgment  in 
favor of Wailea/Shinwa, i n an October 24, 2013 summary 
disposition order, the  ICA held Judge Raffetto abused his 
discretion by allowing Szymanski’s counsel to withdraw prior to 
the hearing and by  denying Szymanski’s substitute counsel’s ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 request for con
tinuance.  Title Guaranty Escrow Services , Inc. 
v. Szymanski, No. 30697, at 6- 7 (App. Oct . 24, 2013)  (SDO) 
(“Appeal 2”).  The ICA stated that “in light of the above,” it 
would not reach the merits of Szymanski’s challenge to the 
disbursal of the escrow funds to Wailea, and that it would 
vacate the July 19, 2010 order only with respect to the 
disbursal of funds to Wailea and would affirm
 the 2010 Judgment 
in all other respects.   Appeal 2, SDO at 7.  The ICA’s January 
13, 2014 judgment on appeal stated that, pursuant to its October 
24, 2013 SDO, the 2010 Judgment was vacated and the case was 
remanded to the circuit court .  No certiorari application was 
filed. 
On January 24, 2014, with respect to Appeal 3 re the 2012 
Denials of the Motions to V acate Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary 
Judgment Orders, this court entered a summary disposition order 
holding the ICA erred when it dismissed the appe
al for lack of 
jurisdiction and remanded to the ICA for a decision on the 
merits of that appeal.  Title Guaranty Escrow Services , Inc. v. 
Szymanski, SCWC-12-0000711, at 4 (Jan. 24, 2014) (SDO).  On 
remand, the ICA issued a memorandum opinion holding: (1) Judge 
Loo was not required to recuse herself because her interest in A ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
16 
 8& B was de minimis  and the circumstances did not give rise to 
the appearance of impropriety
; and (2) there was no error in the 
denial of the motion to rec onsider because Szymanski did not 
present any new evidence or arguments.  Title Guaranty Services, 
Inc. v. Szymanski, CAAP- 12-711, at 5- 14 (App. August 31, 2016) 
(mem. op.).  On January 12, 2017, this court rejected 
Szymanski’s application for writ of certiorari from the ICA’s 
October 3, 2016 
judgment of appeal for Appeal 3 re the 2012 
Denials of Motions to Vacate Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment 
Orders.  
2. Fourth and sixth appeals at issue on certiorari  
 
a. Circuit court proceedings 
 
After the January 13, 2014 ICA judgment on appeal regarding 
Appeal 2 re the 2010 Judgment in favor of Wailea/Shinwa, which  
vacated the 2010 Judgment, on March 14, 2014, Szymanski filed a 
memorandum in opposition
 to the 2009 Wailea/Shinwa motion.  
Szymanski argued the $50,000 he had deposited  in escrow  on April 
23, 2001 was not a Downpayment  under the Contract because (1) it 
was made after the dates specified in the Fourth and Fifth 
Amendments; (2) it was for a different amount and made after the 
                                                           
8  The definition section of the HRCJC  provides:  “ De minimis ” in the 
context of interests pertaining to disqualification of a judge, means an 
insignificant interest that could not raise a reasonable question regarding 
the judge’s impartiality.   See HRCJC Rule 2.11, quoted in note 4, supra. 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
17 
 date specified in Wailea’s April 6, 2001 letter;  and (3) it was 
not required or contemplated by the Contract.  Szymanski also 
argued the funds were not a “ Downpayment” as defined  by Sections 
1.3, 3.1, and 3.2 of the Contract, as amended, and therefore 
could not be retained by Wailea pursuant to Section 22.1(a) of 
the Contract.  Szymanski further
 argued that entry of judgment 
as to his third-p arty complaint against Shinwa was not 
appropriate because his third -party complaint had never been 
disposed of or resolved.  
 On March 18, 2014, Wailea/Shinwa responded that t he funds 
were a Downpayment and that Szymanski’s breach of the Contract  
triggered Wailea’s right to retain all of the Downpayments  
pursuant to Section 22.1(a).  Furthermore , Wailea/Shinwa argued 
that amendments to the Contract had allowed Szymanski to 
withdraw his previously deposited 
Downpayments, that  only $1,000 
remained in escrow as of April 23, 2001, and  that the $50,000 
deposit was therefore a necessary D ownpayme nt to extend the 
closing date. 
While Appeal 3 re the 2012 Denial s of the Motions to Vacate 
Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment Orders was pending, on June 
30, 2014, Szymanski filed yet another motion to vacate Judge 
Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment Orders based on her failure to 
recuse (“2014 Renewed Motion to Vacate Judge Loo ’s 2004 Summary ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
18 
 Judgment Orders ”).  Szymanski again argued  Judge Loo indirectly 
benefitted from her ruling because she owned stock in A & B and 
the transfer of title to Wailea Estates, of which A & B 
Properties was a listed member/manager,  was conditioned upon the 
resolution of this lawsuit.   Szymanski argued Judge Loo’s 
recusal was  therefore required by HRCJC Rule 2.11 and HRS § 601-
7 and to avoid  the appearance of impropriety. 
Wailea/Shinwa responded that the “law of the case ” doctrine 
barred Szymanski’s 2014 Renewed Motion to Vacate Judge Loo’s 
2004 Summary Judgment Orders because it restated arguments 
already ruled upon by Judges Raffetto and Kobayashi in their  
2012 Denials of Motions to Vacate Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary 
Judgment Orders.  
 On July 25, 2014, Judge Cahill conducted a hearing on both 
the disbursal of interpleaded escrow funds issue remanded from 
Appeal 2 re the 2010 Judgment in favor of Wailea/Shinwa and the 
2014 Renewed Motion to Vacate Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment 
Orders.  Judge Cahill characterized the 2014 Renewed Motion to 
Vacate Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment Orders as a prohibited 
“motion to reconsider a motion to reconsider.”  He indicated he 
would deny the motion without prejudice, however, because Appeal 
3 re the 2012 Denials of Motions to Vacate Judge Loo’s 2004 
Summary Judgment Orders was still pending. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
19 
 Judge Cahill
 then indicated he would grant the remanded 
2009 Wailea/Shinwa motion regarding the disbursal of 
interpleaded funds on the grounds that the issues had previously
been determined.  Although the ICA had vacated the 2010 Judgment
in Appeal 2 re the 2010 Judgment in favor of Wailea/Shinwa with 
respect to the disbursal of funds to Wailea, Judge Cahill 
expressed uncertainty over whether he  could order Wailea to pay 
back the funds, which had already been disbursed.   Szymanski 
argued that the merits of the request for the disbursal of funds
had not previously been addressed.  Judge Cahill explained, “the
merits that I’m talking about is the summary judgment 
issue . . . . [T]he issues that would determine this particular 
motion were determined on the merits in the summary judgment, 
rightfully or wrongfully.  That went up on appeal.  It was 
affirmed.  Those are the merits that form this.”   Judge Cahill 
explained h e was bound by the rulings within Judge’s Loo’s 2004 
Summary Judgment Orders that Szymanski had breached the Contract
and the ICA’s affirmance of those orders in Appeal 1 re Judge’s 
Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment Orders . 
  
 
 
 
 
On August 27, 2014, Judge Cahill entered an order denying 
the 2014 Renewed Motion to Vacate Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary 
Judgment Orders withou t prejudice.  Also on that date, he ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
20 
 entered an order grantin
g the 2009 Wailea/Shinwa motion ruling 
that Wailea was entitled to the funds in escrow.  
b. ICA proceedings  
 On September 26, 2014
, Szymanski appealed the August 27, 
2014 order denying the 2014 Renewed Motion to Vacate Judge Loo’s 
2004 Summary Judgment Orders ( “Appeal 4  re the Renewed Motion to 
Vacate Judge Loo’s 20 04 Summary Judgment Orders ”).9   
On December 23, 2015, the circuit court entered final 
judgment as to all claims and all parties (“2015 Final 
Judgment”).  On January 21, 2016, Szymanski appealed the 2015 
Final Judgment (“Appeal 6 re the 2015 Final Judgment ”).  
On October 13 , 2017, the ICA consolidated Appeal 4 re the 
2014 Renewed Motion to Vacate Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment 
Orders with Appeal 6 re the 2015 Final Judgment.  
  i.  Szymanski’s arguments   
In the consolidated appeals, Szymanski again argued the 
circuit court erred by (1) failing to grant his 2014 Renewed 
Motion to Vacate Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment Orders ; (2) 
by entering the 2015 Final Judgment because Szymanski’s third -
                                                           
9  Judge Cahill entered another judgment in favor of Wailea/Shinwa on 
November 24, 2014 .  On December 4 , 2014, Szymanski appealed  this judgment to 
the ICA in CAAP- 14-0001340, which was Szymanski’s fifth appeal .  On May 13, 
2015, the ICA dismissed the fifth appeal due to lack of jurisdiction because 
the November 2014 judgment had not resolve d all remaining claims against all 
parties.  After the ICA dismissed the fifth appeal, Wailea/Shinwa filed a 
motion in the circuit court for entry of final judgment, which resulted in 
the December 23, 2015 Final Judgment.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
21 
 party complaint against Shinwa was never resolved
; and (3) by 
granting Wailea/Shinwa’s 2009 Motion and ordering a disbursal of 
the escrow funds to Wailea. 
Szymanski argued  his 2014 Renewed Motion to Vacate Judge 
Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment Orders  should have been granted 
because Judge Cahill did not address Judge Loo’s appearance of 
impropriety for owning stock in A & B.  Szymanski also argued 
that, based on 
Liljeberg , 486 U.S. 847, a judge may still be 
required to recuse despite a lack of knowledge of a conflict.  
Szymanski argued that Judge Loo’s interest in A & B therefore 
required her recusal under HRCJC Rule 2.11(a)(3) and HRS § 601-
7. 
With respect to the disbursal of funds, Szymanski argued 
the circuit court erred because it did not consider the merits 
of Szymanski’s arguments on remand, but held that it was bound 
by the ICA’s affirmance of Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment 
Orders, which included a finding that Szymanski had breached the 
Contract.  Szymanski argued Judge Loo’s rulings did not address 
the disbursal of the escrow funds, and  the ICA had specifically 
remanded the case for the disbursal issue to be heard on the 
merits.  Szymanski also restated his argument that the $50,000 
was not a Downpayment under the Contract.    ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
22 
 Szymanski also argued the circuit court erred 
by entering 
final judgment because Szymanski’s third -party complaint against 
Shinwa was “never disposed of or resolved.”  
  
ii. Wailea/Shinwa’s arguments  
Wailea/Shinwa argued the matter of Judge Loo’s recusal had 
been fully addressed on the merits in Appeal 3 re the 2012 
Denials of Motions to Vacate Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment 
Orders.  Wailea/Shinwa also argued Szymanski’s recusal argument 
failed because (1) there was no evidence Judge Loo knew of 
Wailea Estates’ s purchase of the property
; (2) Judge Loo’s 
minimal interest in A & B did not give rise to an appearance of 
impropriety; and (3) Liljeberg was factually distinguishable 
from this case.  
Wailea/Shinwa also contended that Szymanski waived the 
argument regarding his third -party complaint against Shinwa 
because he did not raise it in Appeal 2 re the 2010 Judgment  in 
favor of Wailea/Shinwa.  
Wailea/Shinwa argued the circuit court did not err in 
ordering the disbursal of escrow funds to Wailea because 
Szymanski breached the Contract as amended, which the ICA 
affirmed in Appeal 1 re Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment 
Orders, and the $50,000 deposit was a “Downpayment”  that Wailea 
was entitled to retain under the Amended Contract.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
23 
 Wailea/Shinwa asserted 
Szymanski had an opportunity to argue the 
disbursal of funds issue on the merits , and the circuit court 
stated its ruling was based on “all of the arguments and 
memoranda” filed.   
Finally, Wailea/Shinwa argued
 the circuit court did not err 
in entering final judgment because the ICA affirmed the 2010 
Judgment in Appeal 2 re the 2010 Judgment in favor of 
Wailea/Shinwa in all aspects except the disbursal of funds.  
iii. ICA’s SDO in c onsolidated Appeals 4 and 6  
 On June 29, 2018, the ICA filed an SDO in the consolidated 
appeals.  Title Guaranty Escrow Serv., Inc. v. Szymanski, CAAP-
14-0001138 and CAAP-16 -0000034 (App. June 29, 2018) (SDO) 
(“Appeals 4 & 6 ”).  The ICA characterized Szymanski’s points of 
error as: “(1) that Judge Loo should have recused herself from 
the case; (2) that the Circuit Court erred in granting final 
judgment in favor of Wailea;” and “ (3) that the Circuit Court 
erred in granting Wailea ’s motion  to disburse funds to 
Wailea . . . .”  Appeals 4 & 6, SDO at 3. 
 First, as to whether Judge Loo was required to recuse 
herself, the ICA noted it had reviewed the  issue in Appeal 3 re 
the 2012 Denials of Motions to Vacate Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary 
Judgment Orders and concluded that Judge Loo’s A & B stock 
ownership was de minimis and too remote of a financial interest ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
24 
 to require disqualification.
  Id.  The ICA stated that in Appeal 
3, it had concluded that Judge Loo’s interest in a non-party 
subsequent purchaser did not objectively give rise to the 
appearance of impropriety.  Appeals 4 & 6, SDO at 3-4.  
Additionally, the ICA noted it had concluded in Appeal 3 that 
Liljeberg was factually distinguishable and did not require 
Judge Loo’s recusal.   Appeals 4 & 6
, SDO at 4.  The ICA held 
that, because Szymanski’s recusal argument rested on the same 
ground as his argument in Appeal 3, “under the law of the case 
doctrine, we are barred from re- examining an identical claim in 
this appeal.”  Id. (citing Fought & Co., Inc.  v. Steel Eng’g and 
Erection, Inc., 87 Haw. 37, 48-49, 951 P.2d 487, 498-99 (1998)). 
 With respect to whether Judge Cahill erred in entering the
2015 Final Judgment when “the third -party complaint against 
Shinwa had not been resolved,” the ICA noted it had reviewed an
affirmed the 2010 Judgment “with the exception of vacating and 
remanding on the disbursement issue ” in Appeal 2 re 2010 the 
Final Judgment in Favor of Wailea/Shinwa.  Id.  The ICA ruled 
Szymanski’s argument in the current consolidated appeals  was 
based on the same allegation in Appeal 2 that his third-party 
claim remained 
active.  Id.  The ICA held that Szymanski’s 
arguments related to the 2015 Final Judgment were thus also 
barred by the law of the case doctrine.  Id.  
d ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
25 
  
With regard to the whether the circuit court erred when it 
granted Wailea’s motion for disbursal of funds,  the ICA first 
noted it had affirmed the orders finding that Szymanski breached 
the contract in Appeal 1 re Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment 
Orders.  Appeals 4 & 6, SDO at 5.  The ICA then interpreted the 
provisions of the Contract.  Id.
  The Contract provide d that, in 
the event of default, which included  Szymanski’s failure to 
perform his obligations under the Contract, Wailea “shall be 
entitled to retain all of the Downpayments as Seller’s sole and 
absolute property as compensation for Seller’s costs in 
negotiating and preparing this Contract and for the damage 
caused by the default . . . .”  Id. (quoting Section 22.1(a) of 
the Contract).  The ICA explained that although the “In itial 
Downpayment” was originally  non-refundable, the Fourth Amendment 
to the Contract made “the entire down payment refundable, if 
closing does not occur by June 30, 2000 ,” and also required an 
“Additional Downpayment” of $40,000, which would be refundabl e 
if closing did not occur by April 28, 2000.  Id.  The Fourth 
Amendment stated all other provisions and terms of the Contract 
remained in effect.  Id.  
 According to the ICA, due  to the Fourth Amendment, 
Szymanski “could have been refunded his downpayments  up to the 
point of default.”  Appeals 4 & 6, SDO at 6.  The ICA held, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
26 
 however, that because Szymanski breached the contract, “Wailea 
was clearly entitled to retain the downpayments as comp
ensation 
for costs and damages. ”  Id.  Thus, the ICA ruled the circuit 
court did not err in granting Wailea’s mot ion for disbursal of 
the funds.  Id. 
 The ICA therefore affirmed the circuit court.   
D.  Application for Writ of Certiorari 
 Szymanski raises the following seven questions on 
certiorari:   
[1.] Did the ICA Gravely Err When It Relied on Its Previous 
Decision in This Same Matter ( Appeal 3
), Stating That It 
Was Bound by that “Law of the Case”, When: (1) the ICA Had 
No Appellate Jurisdiction in The Previous Matter ( Appeal 3) 
and (2) Because that Previous Appeal Arose from a Different 
Legal Standard of Review and a Different Legal Basis (A PRE 
final-judgment motion in Appeals 4&6) vs. a POST final -
judgment motion in Appeal 3 )?  
 
[
2.] Did the ICA Gravely Err When It Failed to Address a 
New Point of Err
or In This Appeal (NOT Raised Before in Any 
Other Appeals) of a Judge’s Failure to DISCLOSE to the 
Parties That She Owned Stock in a Real Party in Interest in 
this Lawsuit PRIOR to It Making a Ruling(s) (Which Is A 
Violation HRS 601 -7(a) and the HRCJC)?  
 
[
3.] Did the ICA Gravely Err When It Held That Judge Loo’s 
2004 Rulings Without Disclosing that She Owned Stock in A&B 
Create an Appearance of Impropriety, Which Cannot be De 
Minimis as the Hawaii Supreme Court’s Decisions in Thomson 
v. McGonagle , 33 Haw. 565 (1935) and Carey v. Discount 
Corp., 35 Haw. 811 (1941)?  
 
[4.] Did the ICA Gravely Err When It Held a Material Fact 
(that Judge Loo held an interest in a SUBSEQUENT purchaser 
who was a non -party) that was the Exact Opposite of What 
Was True (A&B Had Already Bought the Land When Judge Loo 
Made Her Rulings), Thus Failing to Understand a Core Point 
of the Appeal?  
 
[5.] Did the ICA Gravely Err When It Held a Party’s Third -
Party Complaint Could Be Dismissed WITHOUT a Summary 
Judgment Motion Being Filed to Properly Dismiss It?  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
27 
 [
6.] Did the ICA Gravely Err When It Failed to Order a 
Party’s NON -Contract ($50,000 + Interest) Deposit Be 
Returned to That Party, Instead of to the Other Party. (Did 
the ICA Gravely Err When It Decided a NON -Contract Deposit 
Was Made Under the Contract When There Is NO Evidence in 
the Record That It Was Made Under the Contract?)  
 
[7
.] Did the ICA Gravely Err When It Distinguished the U.S. 
Supreme Court’s Ruling in Liljeberg by Stating that Case 
Showed a Direct and Documented Benefit to the Judge Where 
the Judge in Liljeberg
 Was a Member of the Board of 
Trustees of a University?  
 
 In summary, with respect to Judge Loo, Szymanski asserts 
the ICA erred because it failed to addre ss Judge Loo’s duty to 
disclose any potential conflict of interest prior to making her 
rulings, which created an appearance of impropriety,  
and that the ICA incorrectly determined a material fact when it 
stated Judge Loo’s interest was in a “subsequent purchaser” 
because Wailea Estates purchased the property a year prior to 
10Judge Loo’s rulings .  
 Szymanski also asserts his third- party complaint against 
Shinwa was dismissed “with no proper motion ever being filed,” 
and the ICA should have vacated the lower court’s rulings and 
required Shinwa to file a summary judgment motion if it wanted 
those claims dismissed.  
                                                           
10  In his first question on certiorari, Szymanski a lso argues the ICA lost 
jurisdiction over Appeal 3 re the 2012 Denials of Motions to Vacate Judge 
Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment Orders after it vacated the 2010 Judgment in 
Appeal 2 re the 2010 Judgment in favor of Wailea/Shinwa.  This assertion is 
devoid of merit, as appellate jurisdiction existed separately for both 
appeals.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
28 Finally, Szymanski argues the ICA gravely erred in holding 
Wailea was entitled to the $50,000 deposit in the event of 
default.  Szymanski contends that his deposit  was not a 
“Downpayment” as defined by the Amended Contract.  Szymanski 
maintains he had already removed the two “Downpayments” in 
escrow to the extent allowed by the Amended Contract, and his 
letter accompanying the $50,000 deposit clearly stated he 
retained the option to direct the funds towards either the 
purchase price or the development of the land, indicating it was 
not a “Downpayment.”  
III.Standards of Review
A. Questions of Law
Questions of law are reviewed upon appeal under the
right/wrong standard of review.  Maile Sky Court Co. v. City and 
County of Honolulu, 85 Hawai
ʻi 
36, 39, 936 P.2d 672, 675 (1997). 
B. Contract Interpretation
“When reviewing the court’ s interpretation of a contract,
the construction and legal effect to be given a contract is a 
question of law freely reviewable by an appellate court.”  
Mikelson v. United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, 107 Hawai ʻi 192, 197, 111 
P.3d 601, 606 (2005) (citations and internal quotation marks
omitted).  Additionally, 
This court has stated that “‘[a]s a general rule, the 
construction and legal effect to be given a  contract is a ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
29 
 question of law.’”   Found. Int ’l, Inc. v. E.T. Ige Const., 
Inc., 102 Hawaii 487, 494 -95, 78 P.3d 23, 30 -31 (2003) 
(quoting Hanagami v. China Airlines, Ltd., 67 Haw. 357, 
364, 688 P.2d 1139, 1144 (1984)).  Accordingly, “[a]bsent 
an ambiguity,  [the] contract terms should be interpreted 
according to their plain, ordinary, and accepted sense in 
common speech. ”  Id. at 495, 78 P.3d 23 (brackets in 
original, citation omitted).  
Koga Eng’g & Constr., Inc. v. State, 122 Hawai ʻi  60, 72, 222 P.3d 
979, 991 (2010). 
IV.  Discussion  
A.  The ICA did not err in applying the law of the case 
doctrine to Szymanski’s points of error and arguments 
related to the issue of Judge Loo’s recusal  
 
The ICA did not err in its application of the law of the 
case doctrine in ruling on the first four and seventh questions 
on certiorari related to Szymanski’s renewed assertion that 
Judge Loo was required to recuse herself.  The ICA had 
previously ruled on these issues in Appeal 3 re the 2012 Denials 
of Motions to Vacate Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment Orders .  
The usual practice of courts of equal and concurrent 
jurisdiction is to refuse to disturb all prior rulings in a 
particular case.  Chun v. Bd. of Tr. of the Emp. Ret . Sys., 92 
Hawaiʻi 432, 441, 992 P.2d 127, 136 (2000).  Thus, “[u]nless 
cogent reasons support the second court ’s action, any 
modification of a prior ruling of another court of equal and 
concurrent jurisdiction will be deemed an abuse of discretion. ”  
Wong v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 66 Haw. 389, 396, 665 P.2d 157, 
162 (1983) (emphasis in original).  Consequently, the “law of ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
30 
 the case” doctrine does not preclude modification of a prior 
ruling.  Stender v. Vincent, 92 Hawai ʻi 355, 362, 992 P.2d 50, 57 
(2000).  In addition to cogent reasons, exceptional 
circumstances, such as the correction of a patent error, may 
warrant a modification of a prior order of a judge of equal and 
concurrent jurisdiction.  Tradewinds Hotel, Inc. v. Cochran , 8 
Haw. App. 256, 264- 65, 799 P.2d 60, 66 (1990).  
In its August 31, 2016 memorandum opinion regarding Appeal 
3 re 2012 Denials of Motions to Vacate Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary 
Judgment Orders , the ICA had already addressed  and rejected  
Szymanski’s arguments regarding Judge Loo’s recusal .  Szymanski 
reasserted the same arguments in his June 30, 2014 Renewed 
Motion to Vacate Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment Orders .  
Thus, the law of the case doctrine applies.  
Szymanski advanced  no cogent reasons,  patent error, or  
exceptional circumstances for the ICA to revisit its prior 
rulings.  Thus, the ICA did not err in applying the law of the 
case doctrine with respect to Szymanski’s 2014 Renewed Motion to 
Vacate Judge Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment Orders that again 
asserted Judge Loo should have been disqualified.   
In addition, as indicated by Judg e Cahill at the July 25, 
2014 hearing on Szymanski’s 2014 Renewed Motion to Vac ate Judge ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
31 
 Loo’
s 2004 Summary Judgment Orders, the renewed motion was 
actually a “motion to reconsider a motion to reconsider.”   
Thus, Szymanski’s  first four and seventh questions on 
appeal lack merit.  
B.  Szymanski’s arguments related to his third -party complaint 
against Shinwa also lack merit 
 
In his fifth question on certiorari, Szymanski contends the 
ICA gravely erred by holding that his third -party complaint 
against Shinwa “could be dismissed without a summary judgment 
motion being filed to properly dismiss it.”  
 Szymanski  misstates the ICA’ s ruling.  The ICA held that 
the issue of whether the third-party complaint was properly 
dismissed was encompassed in its summary disposition order 
resolving Appeal 2 re the 2010 Judgment in favor of 
Wailea/Shinwa.  Appeals 4 & 6, SDO at 4.  
In its ruling on 
Appeal 2, the ICA affirmed the 2010 Judgment, which included the 
dismissal of  Szymanski’s third -party complaint against Shinwa, 
and vacated and remanded only the portion of the judgment 
related to the disbursal of funds.  Id.   The ICA therefore 
determined that the dismissal of Szymanski ’s third -party 
complaint was subject to the law of the case doctrine in his 
assertion of the issue in Appeal 6 re the 2015 Final Judgment.
  
Appeals 4 & 6, SDO at 4-5. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
32 
 Again, Szymanski advance d no cogent reasons , patent error, 
or exceptional circumstances for the ICA to revisit its 
affirmance of the dismissal of the thir d-party complaint in its 
ruling in Appeal 2.  
Therefore, the ICA did not err by applying the law of the 
case doctrine to Szymanski’s fifth issue o n certiorari.11 
C.  The ICA erred in affirming the circuit court’s ruling on 
remand regarding the disbursal of escrow funds  
 
Finally, in his sixth issue on certiora ri, Szymanski asks 
this court to determine whether the ICA erred when it failed to 
order the escrow funds returned to Szymanski and held there was 
“no evidence in the record” that the deposit was not “made under 
the Contract.”  The law of the case doctrine does not apply to 
this issue.  In its October 24, 2013 SDO ruling on Appeal 2 re 
the 2010 Judgment in favor of Wailea/Shinwa, the ICA had 
remanded the issue of the disbursal of escrow funds to the 
circuit court for it to address
 on the merits, and Appeal 6 re 
the 2015 Final Judgment is the first appeal regarding the 
circuit court’s August 27, 2014 ruling on this issue.   
Therefore, we further address this question on certiorari. 
 
                                                           
11  We also note that Szymanski did not raise the dismissal of his third -
party complaint as a point of error in Appeal 2 re the 2010 Judgment in favor 
of Wailea/Shinwa.  Because Syzmanski did not raise the third -party complaint 
issue in Appeal 2, his argument was  actually  waived.  See  Alvarez Family

  This court reviews the interpretation of a contract de

Examining the terms of the Contract and its amendments, we 
note that Paragraph 22.1 of the Contract, “Seller’s Remedies ,” 
provides in relevant part: 
22.1 Seller’s Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Event of 
Default, Seller shall have the following rights and 
remedies:   
 
(a) If such Event of Default should occur prior to the date 
the Deed is filed in the Office of the Assistant Registrar, 
Seller’s sole remedy shall be to ca ncel this Contract, 
whereupon all rights of Buyer and duties and obligations of 
Seller shall terminate, and Seller shall be entitled to 
retain all of the Downpayments  as Seller’s sole and 
absolute property as compensation for Seller’s costs in 
negotiating and preparing this Contract and for the damage 
caused by the default, Buyer hereby agreeing that the 
Downpayments represent fair and reasonable compensation to 
Seller for default  . . . . 
 
(Emphases added.)   This provision was not expressly modified by 
any subsequent amendment to the Contract.  Thus, at the core of 
the disbursal of funds
 issue is the definition of “Downpayment” 
under the Contract and its amendments.   
 Section 1.3 of the Contract defines “Downpayments” as 
“[t]he Initial Downpayment and Addit ional Downpayments to be 
made by Buyer on the Purchase Price, as defined in paragraph 3.1 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
34 
 and 3.2.”  Paragraph 3, “Purchase Price” of the Contract , as 
modified by the Fourth Amendment to the Contract,  reads as 
follows:  
3. Purchase Price .  Buyer shall pay to Seller, in 
United States legal tender, the Purchase Price of FOUR 
MILLION FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($4,550,000.00) 
for the Property, as follows:  
 
 3.1 Initial Downpayment. Buyer shall deposit into 
Escrow an initial downpayme nt (the “Initial Downpayment”) 
of FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($40,000) upon execution of the 
Contract.  THIRTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($39,000) of the 
Initial Downpayment, plus interest earned on this portion 
of the Initial Downpayment while in escrow, shall be  
refundable, if closing does not occur by June 30, 2000.  
 
 3.2 Additional Downpayment .  Buyer shall deposit 
into Escrow an Additional Downpayment of FORTY THOUSAND 
DOLLARS ($40,000) on or before July 4, 1999.  Such Addition 
[sic] Downpayment of FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($40,000), plus 
interest earned on this Additional Downpayment while in 
escrow, shall be refundable, if closing does not occur by 
April 28, 2000.  
 
 3.3. Balance of Purchase Price .  Buyer shall pay to 
Seller the balance of the Purchase Price (Purchase Price 
less Initial Downpayment (or portion thereof) deposited 
into Escrow and interest earned thereon) on the Closing 
Date. 
 
 3.4 Interest on Downpayments .  All Downpayments 
shall be deposited with Escrow and shall be credited to the 
Purchase Price, unless refunded in accordance with Sections 
3.1 and 3.2 above.  Any interest earned on the Downpayments 
while in Escrow shall be credited to the Buyer at closing; 
provided , however, if the Downpayments are paid to Seller 
because of an Event of Default or because of a cancellation 
of this Contract (except as otherwise provided), all such 
interest shall be paid to Seller.  Buyer shall be 
responsible for instructing Escrow on the manner in which 
the Downpayments are to earn interest.  
The Fourth Amendment removed a provision in the Contract for a 
second “Additional Downpayment” of $4,820,000 and altered the 
terms of refund for the Downpayments, but retained all other 
terms and conditions.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
35 
  The Fifth Amendment to the Contract modified the “Closing 
Date” par
agraph to read: 
4. Closing Date .  The term “Closing Date” means:  
(a) The earlier of March 30, 2001, or issuance of 
Final Subdivision approval from the County of Maui 
for the Property;  
(b)  That date determined by Buyer, in writing, that 
is between ten (10) working days from the date the 
Seller receives a partial release of mortgage for the 
Property from its mortgagee, which Seller agrees to 
obtain from its mortgagee as soon as practical, and 
4(a) above; or 
(c) Such other date as mutually agreed upon in 
writing by Seller and Buyer.  
The Fifth Amendment retained all other terms and conditions.  
 According to the plain language of the Contract,  as 
amended, “Downpayments” consist of an “Initial Downpayment” and 
“Additional Downpayment ,” which are b oth set forth in clearly 
specified amounts
 in Paragraph 3, as are the terms of refund.  
The Amended Contract does not indicate that “Additional 
Downpayment” would include any other deposit.  
Wailea/Shinwa contend Szymanski’s $50,000 deposit into 
escrow was an “Additional Downpayment” pursuant to Wailea’s 
April 6, 2001 letter demanding that Szymanski deposit $49,000 by 
April 11, 2001.  Paragraph 3 4 of the Contract, “Sole Agreement,” 
however, requires that modifications to the Contract be in 
writing and signed by the parties.  Thus, Wailea lacked the 
unilateral authority to require an “Additional Downpayment” 
without Szymanski’s written agreement.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
36 
 It does not appear 
Szymanski deposited the $50,000 pursuant 
to Wailea’s April 6, 2001 letter.  He definitely did not do so 
by the April 11, 2001 deadline demanded in Wailea’s letter.  
Rather, Szymanski ’s April 23, 2001 letter to TG Escrow stated: 
“I am providing additional escrow funds to show my good fait h in 
closing this purchase transaction . . . . Attached please find 
my check in the amount of $50,000 (FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS) to be 
applied towards the purchase price of the [property] or its 
development costs, at my option.”  This letter did not contain 
the word “Downpayment.”   
 Wailea/Shinwa’s argument that the deposit must be a 
“Downpayment” to which Wailea is entitled because only $1,000 
remained in escrow prior to Szymanski’s $50,000 deposit is 
without merit.  The Contract specifically provided for refund of 
the Downpayments and did not require any other payments in the 
event that the Downpayments were refunded prior to closing. 
 The Contract, as amended,  however, only entitled Wailea to 
“Downpayments” as defined therein in the event of default.  
Szymanski’s $50,000 does not appear to be an “Initial 
Downpayment” or an “Additional Downpayment” under a plain 
reading of the Contract, as amended.  
Moreover, when the circuit court addressed the disbursal of 
the escrow funds, it  ruled based on a mistaken belief it was ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
37 (continued. . .)  
 bound by Judge’s Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment Orders that 
Szymanski had breached the Contract and the ICA’s affirmance  of 
those orders in Appeal 1 re Judge’s Loo’s 2004 Summary Judgment 
Orders.  In its October 24, 2013 summary disposition order 
regarding Appeal 2 re the 2010 Judgment in favor of 
Wailea/Shinwa, however, the ICA had clearly stated it was not 
addressing the merits of Szymanski’s challenge to the disbursal
of the escrow funds to Wailea, and it therefore vacated and 
remanded that issue alone for the circuit court to address on 
the merits.  Therefore, the ICA erred in affirming the circuit 
court’s ruling.   On remand, the circuit court must address the 
disbursal of funds issue based on the Contract, as amend ed.  
Accordingly, the ICA erred in ruling  that Wailea was 
entitled to retain the $50,000 deposit with accrued interest and 
that “the Circuit Court did not err in granting Wailea’s motio n 
for disbursal of the funds.”  
V. Conclusion  
We therefore affirm in part, and vacate in part, the ICA’s 
October 5, 2018 judgment on appeal.12  With respect to Appeal No. 
                                                           
12  The ICA’s October 5, 2018 judgment on appeal appears to misstate the 
orders and judgments Szymanski appealed from in Appeals 4 and 6.  With 
respect to Appeal 4 (CAAP -14-0001138), the ICA’s October 5, 2018 judgment on 
appeal affirmed the August 27, 2014 Order Denying Defendant and Third Party 
Plaintiff Michael J. Szymanski’s Motion to Vacate Judge Rhonda Loo’s 2004 
Rulings and All Subsequent Rulings Based Upon Them, Due to Her Failure To

Rhonda Loo’s 2004 Rulings and All Subsequent Rulings Based Upon 
Them, Due to Her Failure To Recuse Herself, filed on June 30, 
2014.  With respect to Appeal No. CAAP- 16-000034, we vacate the

Parties.  However, S zymanski’s notice of appeal for Appeal 4 only stated that 
he was appealing the August 27, 2014 Order Denying Defendant and Third Party 
Plaintiff Michael J. Szymanski’s Motion to Vacate Judge Rhonda Loo’s 2004 
Rulings and All Subsequent Rulings Based Upon Them, Due to Her Failure To 
Recuse Herself.  The notice of appeal did not mention the November 24, 2014 
Final Judgment as to All Claims and Parties, which was actually the subject 
of Szymanski’s fifth appeal.  See note 9, supra.  
With respect to Appeal 6 (CAAP- 16-0000034), the ICA’s October 5, 2018 
judgment on appeal affirmed the December 23, 2015 Order Granting Defendant 
Wailea Resort Company, Ltd.’s and Third -Party Defendants ADOA -Shinwa 
Development Corporation’s and Shinwa Golf Hawaii Co., Ltd.’s Motion  for Entry 
of Final Judgment After Dismissal of Appeal for Lack of Jurisdiction.  
However, Szymanski’s notice of appeal for Appeal 6 only stated that he was 
appealing the December 23, 2015 Final Judgment as to All Claims and Parties 
and “[a]ll previous ord ers entered by this court prior to the entry of that 
Final Judgment as to All Claims and Parties, but after the 2005 HRCP Rule 
54(b)-certified Judgment,” including: (a) the August 27, 2014 Order Denying 
Defendant and Third Party Plaintiff Michael J. Szyman ski’s Motion to Vacate 
Judge Rhonda Loo’s 2004 Rulings and All Subsequent Rulings Based Upon Them,
