IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI

STATE OF HAWAIʻ I, Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee,
 
vs.
 
ALFRED W.K. COMBES, Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant.
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(CAAP-14-0001139; CR. NO. 12-1-1895)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Alfred
 
W.K. Combes’s application for writ of certiorari, it appears that 
Combes’s application was due on January 26, 2017, which was 30 days after the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ December 27, 2016 judgment. Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 602-59(c) (Supp. 
2014); Hawai ʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
40.1(a)(1)(2016). 
Combes’s application was filed on January 27, 2017. The
 
application is untimely and thus, this court lacks appellate
 jurisdiction. Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for writ of
 
certiorari is dismissed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, February 3, 2016.
