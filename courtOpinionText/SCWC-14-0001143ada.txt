OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.
  
I. Introduction 
Takson Krstoth (“Krstoth”)entered a plea of guilty to one 
count of Murder in the Second Degree, in violation of Hawai ‘i 
Revised Statutes (“ HRS”) § 707-701.5 (2014).
1 Before sentencing,     
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 Krstoth raises the following question on certiorari:   
 
  “[A]  more liberal approach is to be taken” when a 
defendant moves to withdraw his or her plea prior to sentencing  
such that “the motion should be granted if the defendant has 
presented a fair and just reason for his request and the State 
has not relied upon the guilty plea to its substantial 
prejudice.” State v. Jim, 58 Haw. 574, 576, 574 P.2d 521,  523  
(1978).   Moreover, “[a] ‘language barrier’ between the defendant 
and the court is a ‘salient fact’ that puts the trial court on notice that a defendant’s waiver may be ‘less than knowing and 
intelligent.’” State v. Phua, 135 Hawai ‘i 504, 513, 353 P.3d 
1046, 1055 (2015) (quoting State v. Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawai ‘i 
465, 471, 312 P.3d 897, 903 (2013)).    *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Krstoth requested that the court allow him to withdraw his plea 
and go to trial, then filed a motion requesting the same, 
asserting that his plea was not entered knowingly, 
intelligently, or voluntarily, and that he felt pressured by his 
public defender and interpreter to plead guilty. The circuit 
court denied the motion and sentenced him to life imprisonment 
with the possibility of parole. 
“Whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that the Circuit Court 
did not abuse its discretion in denying Krstoth’s Motion to 
Withdraw Plea?” 
2     
 
 
  In this case, the circuit court’s  colloquy does not 
establish that Krstoth voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly 
entered his plea with an understanding of the nature of the 
charge against him and the consequences of his plea.  We 
therefore vacate the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence,  and 
remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings 
consistent with this opinion.

II. Background 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings 
On September 15, 2011, Krstoth was 
charged by grand jury 
indictment with one count of Murder in the Second Degree.  
Deputy Public Defender Edward Harada ( “Harada”) was appointed to 
represent Krstoth. 
On April 16, 2013, Krstoth, present with Harada and court-
appointed Chuukese interpreter Kachusy Silander (“Silander”),  
entered a plea of guilty  to the charged offense  pursuant to a 
plea agreement with the State.  At the outset, the colloquy 
revealed that Krstoth was twenty-two years old, had a tenth  
grade education, and did not read or write any English. After the circuit court accepted Krstoth’s guilty plea, sentencing was 
scheduled for July 23, 2013.  
On June 25, 2013, however, the circuit court received a 
handwritten, ex parte letter from Krstoth, written by someone 
for him, which stated: 
3     
 
 
       
      
 
 
 On September 3, 2013, Harada  filed a “Mot ion to Withdraw as 
Counsel and Have Substitute Counsel Appointed”  (“motion to 
withdraw as counsel”).   The attached declaration of counsel by 
Harada stated, in relevant part, as follows:  
 
 
 8. I discussed the letter with Mr. Krstoth, and he 
made it clear that the words expressed in the letter are 
his true words and feelings, but that someone else assisted 
him in writing the words out on paper. Mr. Krstoth 
affirmed the words and feelings he expressed in his letter 
and made several things clear: (a) that he felt pressured 
by me to accept the plea bargain offered by the State and 
plead “guilty” to the charge d offense; (b) that he did not 
understand all of his rights he had, including the right to 
a trial, because I did not make things clear to him; and 
(c) that he does in fact want to withdraw his previously 
entered “guilty” plea and have a trial to contest t he 
charge against him.”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
To the Honorable Judge Mr. Lee. Hi my name is ____ , and I’m 
writing in regards to a plea bargain that I agree upon due to being basically scared to death by my attorney Mr. Edward Harada, 
stating to me that if I did in fact even think of taking my case 
to trial and lost, that I would spend the rest of my life behind 
prison bars or close to it. Laying in my bed at night and thinking of my children and their future truly rips my heart to 
pieces, that I cant [sic] be th ier [sic] to guide, love, support, 
and share their joy as a father. I’m aware that I’ve signed a Rule (11) . . . Would you please give me the oppertunity [sic] to 
recant my guilty plea so, I can have a fair day in trial?  On July 23, 2013 I will be in your courtroom for my sentencing day. 
Your Honor please consider my request. Thank you and God bless.  
Sincerely  
Mr. T. Krstoth 
The circuit court forwarded the letter to Harada. 
7. On August 27, 2013, I visited Takson Krstoth at 
OCCC and had [an interpreter] present to provide 
information. 
On September 9, 2013, the circuit court granted the motion to  
withdraw as counsel  and substitute counsel was appointed to 
represent Krstoth.

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
On April 14, 2014, through his new attorney, Krstoth filed 
a “Motion to Withdraw Plea ” (“motion to withdraw plea”) , 
asserting that he was unaware during the change of plea hearing 
that he was changing his plea to guilty, the interpreter was not 
interpreting what was being said and was merely telling him to 
“say yes” or “say no,” he was not informed of the details of the 
plea agreement, and he did not authorize his initial counsel 
Harada to agree to the plea agreement. On June 10, 2014, the 
State filed its memorandum in opposition to Krstoth’s m otion. 
The State argued that there was nothing in the record to indicate that Krstoth did not understand the colloquy with the 
court or that he was unable to make an intelligent decision at 
his change of plea hearing. 
At a hearing on the motion to withdraw plea, the circuit 
court heard testimony from Krstoth, Silander, and Harada. On 
June 17, 2014, the circuit court issued its “Findings of Fact, 
Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Defendant’s Motion to 
Withdraw Plea.”
2 The circuit court concluded, in relevant part, 
as follows: 
2 The circuit court actually made few relevant findings, as most of 
the “findings” were recitations of testimony, such as finding of fact number 
37, which states, “Mr. Silander testifi ed that the Defendant understood his 
translations and that he specifically went over the change of plea for line by line with the Defendant.” Th is recitation of testimony is not a finding 
by the circuit court that Krstoth understood the interpreter’s sight 
translations. Dep’t Envtl. Serv. v. Land Use Comm’n , 127 Hawai‘ i 5, 15, n.12, 
275 P.3d 809, 819, n.12 (2012) (explaining that a recitation of testimony is 
not a finding of fact).

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
15. The Court finds that the Defendant presented 
contradictory testimony evidence and failed to present any credible evidence establishing plausible and legitimate 
grounds for the withdrawal of his guilty pleas. 
16. Here, although the Defendant claims that his 
plea was not entered knowingly or intelligently since the 
interpreter was merely telling the Defendant to “say yes” 
or “say no” and that his attorney and the interpreter had 
pressured him to plead guilty , the Court finds and 
concludes that, based on its examination and consideration of the entire record in this case, the Defendant knowingly , 
intelligently , and voluntarily entered his guilty plea. 
17. At the hearing on the Motion, the Defendant 
testified to the following: that Mr. Harada and Mr. Silander discussed the guilty plea form and plea agreement 
with him, he knew that he had a choice to plead guilty , and 
that no one was pressuring him to change his plea . The 
Defendant’ s testimony contradicted the claims raised in his 
Motion. 
18. The transcript of the proceedings shows no 
reluctance or hesitancy by the Defendant to enter his plea. 
The Defendant answered each question appropriately , never 
refused to answer any of the questions, never requested to stop the proceedings , and never indicated that he did not 
understand the proceedings. 
19. More importantly, during the Court’ s questioning 
of the Defendant , the Defendant was asked numerous times 
whether he understood what was being told to him and if he 
had any questions. 
20. The Court finds and concludes that the Defendant 
did understand what was being asked on [sic] him since he 
did ask the Court a question about the presentence report . 
21. The Court further finds and concludes that the 
Defendant was aware of his rights, the nature of the 
charges against him and the consequences of his pleas [sic]. 
22. Moreover, the evidence presented at the hearing 
established that on April 9, 2013, Mr. Harada, through Mr. 
Silander, went over the change of plea form line by line 
with the Defendant at the Oahu Community Correctional Center (“OCCC”) . 
23. Since this Court did not hear the Defendant’ s 
change of plea until April 16, 2013, the Court finds and concludes that if the Defendant had any serious concerns and/or questions regarding the plea agreement , he had both 
the time and opportunity to raise them with counsel. 
. . . .

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
25. []Mr. Harada testified that he insisted upon the 
use of an interpreter even though the Defendant could understand some English. Mr. Harada further testified that 
he answered all of the Defendant’ s questions to the best of 
his ability, and that the Defendant at no time informed him of his desire to reject the plea agreement and proceed to trial. 
26. Therefore, based on the examination and 
consideration of the entire record in this case and considering the testimony presented at the hearing on the Motion, the Court finds a nd concludes that the Defendant’ s 
Motion to Withdraw Plea lacks merit and is hereby denied. 
On August 1, 2014, the circuit court issued its Judgment of 
Conviction and Sentence, finding Krstoth guilty of Murder in the 
Second Degree and sentencing him pursuant to the terms of the 
plea agreement to life imprisonment with the possibility of 
parole, with credit for time served.  On September 29, 2014, 
Krstoth appealed the circuit court’s Judgment of Conv iction and 
Sentence to the ICA. 
B. Appeal to the ICA 
In his Opening Brief, Krstoth argued that the circuit court 
abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw plea 
because his testimony that he felt pressured by his attorney and 
interpreter to plead guilty and did not understand why he was 
pleading guilty constitutes plausible and legitimate grounds for 
the withdrawal of his guilty plea. 
In its Answering Brief, the State contended that Krstoth 
failed to present fair and just reasons to support the motion, and that the record, including the change of plea colloquy and 
7     
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
    
 
 
   
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
the change of plea form, supports the court’s finding that 
Defendant’s plea was know ing, voluntary, and intelligent. 
On July 30, 2015, the ICA issued it
s Summary Disposition 
Order, affirming the circuit court’s August 1, 2014 Judgment of 
Conviction and Sentence.  State v. Krstoth,  CAAP-14-1143, at 1 
(App. July 30, 2015) (SDO). The ICA first discussed the April 16, 2013 change of plea colloquy, and stated, “There is no 
indication that Krstoth was confused or reluctant to enter a 
changed plea to the charge.” 
Krstoth
, SDO at 2. The ICA noted, 
inter alia, Krstoth’s statements that Harada reviewed the plea 
form with him and he did not have any questions, as well as the 
circuit court’s explanation of the terms of the plea agreement 
and the rights Krstoth would be giving up by pleading guilty.  
Krstoth, SDO at 3. The ICA further stated, 
Krstoth did question the circuit court as to the meaning of  
a ‘pre- sentence diagnosis and report,’ thus indicating that 
he knew to ask the court for an explanation when he did not 
understand something. The court explained the process and the report at length to Krstoth.  Krstoth appeared 
satisfied with the circuit court’s explanation and had no 
other questions about the report when asked.  
Id. 
The ICA also noted Krstoth’s acknowledgement and subsequent 
“reaffirm[ation
] that no one was threatening him, forcing him or 
pressuring him to plead guilty and that he was pleading guilty 
of his own free will. Krstoth affirmed that there were no other 
promises in return for his guilty plea and that he was satisfied 
with his lawyer.” Krstoth, SDO at 4. 
8     
 
 
  With regard to the June 10, 2014 change of plea hearing, 
the ICA stated that “Krstoth’s former attorney and interpreter 
both testified that they did not pressure Krstoth to plead 
guilty and that it appeared Krstoth understood why he was 
pleading guilty.” Id.   The ICA then held, “T he record in this 
case does not support Krstoth’s contention that the circuit court abused its discretion in denying his ‘Motion to Withdraw 
Plea.’” Id.  
  
   
    
 
 
   
  
  
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
On September 9, 2015, the ICA issued its Judgment on 
Appeal. 
III. 
Standard of Review 
The denial of a Hawai‘ i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(“HRPP”) Rule 32(d) motion to withdraw a plea prior to the 
imposition of sentence is reviewed for abuse of discretion. 
State v. Merino, 81 Hawai‘ i 198, 223, 915 P.2d 672, 697 (1996). 
“An abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has clearly 
exceeded the bounds of reason or has disregarded rules or 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a 
party litigant.” Id. (citation omitted). 
IV. Discussion 
A trial judge is constitutionally required to ensure that a 
guilty plea is voluntarily and knowingly entered. State v. 
Solomon
, 107 Hawaiʻ i 117, 127, 111 P.3d 12, 22 (2005).  “In 
determining the voluntariness of a defendant’ s proffered guilty 
9     
 
 
   
   
   
 
   
 
 
   
                         
  
 
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
plea, the trial court ‘ should make an affirmative showing by an 
on-the-record colloquy between the court and the defendant 
wherein the defendant is shown to have a full understanding of 
what the plea of guilty connotes and its consequences.’” Id.  
(quoting State v. Vaitogi , 59 Haw. 592, 602, 585 P.2d 1259, 1265 
(1978)). 
It is plain error for a 
trial judge to accept a defendant’ s 
guilty plea without an affirmative showing that it was intelligent and voluntary. Vaitogi, 59 Haw. at 601–02, 585 P.2d 
at 1264–65. Further, the validity of a guilty plea must be explicitly shown on the record. Jim, 59 Haw. at 602, 585 P.2d 
at 1265. Because a guilty plea involves the waiver of several important constitutional rights, including the privilege against 
self-incrimination, the right to trial by jury, and the right to 
confront one’s accusers, the record must also explicitly 
establish a valid waiver of these constitutional rights.  
Solomon, 107 Hawai‘ i at 127, 111 P.3d at 22.
3 
3 HRPP Rule 11 (2013) also mandates that the trial court, prior to 
accepting any plea, first address the defendant personally in open court and 
then determine that the plea is voluntary: 
(c) Advice to defendant. The court shall not accept a plea of guilty or no contest without first addressing the 
defendant personally in open court and determining that the 
defendant understands the following: 
(1) the nature of the charge to which the plea is 
offered; and 
(2) the maximum penalty provided by law, and the 
maximum sentence of extended term of impri
sonment, 
(continued. . .)  
10     
 
 
   
   
  
 
                                                                               
 
 
 
 
 
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
After a change of plea, “[a] defendant does not have an 
absolute right to withdraw his guilty plea [.]” Jim, 58 Haw. at 
575, 574 P.2d at 522.  Where a motion to withdraw plea under 
HRPP Rule 32(d) (2012)4 is presented prior to the imposition of 
sentence, however, this court has observed that a “liberal 
approach is to be taken, and the motion should be granted if the 
defendant has presented a fair and just reason for his request 
and the State has not relied upon the guilty plea to its 
substantial prejudice. ” 58 Haw. at 576, 574 P.2d at 523.  This 
(. . .continued)  
which may be imposed for the offense to which the 
plea is offered; and 
(3) that the defendant has the right to plead not 
guilty, or to persist in that plea if it has 
already been made; and 
(4) that if the defendant pleads guilty or no contest 
there will not be a further trial of any kind, so 
that by pleading guilty or no contest the right to 
a trial is waived. 
. . . . 
(e) Insuring that the plea is voluntary. The court shall 
not accept a plea of guilty or no contest without first 
addressing the defendant personally in open court and 
determining that the plea is voluntary and not the result of force or threats or of promises apart from a plea 
agreement. The court shall also inquire as to whether the 
defendant’s willingness to plead guilty or no contes t 
results from any plea agreement. 
4 HRPP Rule 32(d) governs the withdrawal of guilty pleas, and 
provides, in relevant part, as follows: 
A motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere 
may be made before sentence is imposed or imposition of 
sentence is suspended; provided that, to correct manifest 
injustice the court, upon a party’s motion submitted no 
later than ten (10) days after imposition of sentence, shall set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the 
defendant to withdraw the ple
a.

 Q  Do you understand by pleading guilty you ’ll be  
giving up some rights?  
  
 
 Q  I need you to listen up. You have a right to file  
motions to challenge the charge. You have a right to a 
public and speedy trial which means the prosecutor must  
present its   case against you as quickly as possible. You 
have a right to  a jury trial. And what a jury trial is is 
twelve people from  the community are randomly selected. 
They sit in those orange  chairs there. They listen to the 
evidence, and the jury  decides if the evidence is 
sufficient to find you guilty.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
court has stated “two fundamental bases of demonstrating ‘fair 
and just reasons’ for granting withdrawal of a plea: (1) the 
defendant did not knowingly, intelligently or voluntarily waive 
his or her rights; or (2)  changed circumstances or new 
information justify withdrawal of the plea.” State v. Gomes, 79 
Hawaiʻi 32, 37, 8 97 P.2d 959, 964 (1995)  
 .     
Krstoth argues that the ICA gravely erred in holding that 
the record does not support his contention that the circuit 
court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw 
plea. He contends that his guilty plea was not made knowingly, 
intelligently, or voluntarily
, and that his testimony provided 
fair and just reasons for the withdrawal of his guilty plea. 
In this case, the record fails to establish a voluntary, 
knowing, and intelligent change of plea. With respect to Krstoth’s right to a trial, the circuit court engaged in the 
following colloquy: 
Q Do you understand that you have a right to plead 
not guilty and ask for a trial? 
A  Yes.  
A Yes. 
12     
 
 
  You have the right to have the government bring the  
witnesses into court to testify in front of you. And through Mr. Harada you get to question the witnesses. You 
have a right to testify in your own behalf or have Mr.  
Harada bring  witnesses for you to testify for you. And 
finally if there  was a trial and if you were found guilty, 
you have a right to  take an appeal to a higher court to see 
if there was any  mistakes made by this court.  
  
 
   
   
 
      
 
 
 Q  Do you understand that after you are sentenced you  
cannot change your mind  and say that I didn’t like the 
sentence so therefore I want my trial?  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Now those are your rights as you stand there this 
morning. Do you understand that? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Do you understand by pleading guilty you give up 
those rights? 
A 
Yes. 
Q 
Do you understand by pleading guilty I’ m going to 
find you guilty and sentence you without a trial? 
A  Yes.  
A  Yes.  
This record does not  establish a valid waiver of Krstoth’s 
constitutional right to trial by jury, as required by Solomon.  
107 Hawai‘ i at 12 8, 111 P.3d at 23.  The validity of the waiver 
of a right to a jury trial is reviewed “under the totality of 
the circumstances surrounding the case,  taking into account the 
defendant’s background, experience, and conduct.”  Gomez-Lobato , 
130 Hawai‘ i at 47 0, 312  P.3d at 902 (citation and emphasis   
omitted).  In this case, Krstoth  has a tenth grade education and 
has limited English proficiency. In the change of plea colloquy, the circuit court  merely  stated, “You have a right to 
a jury trial. And what a jury trial is is twelve people from the community are randomly selected. They sit in those orange 
13     
 
 
   
  
       
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
chairs there. They listen to the evidence, and the jury decides 
if the evidence is sufficient to find you guilty.”  
Granted, we have held that 
a court is not required to give 
the full United States v. Duarte –Higareda,  113 F.3d 1000 (9th 
Cir. 1997) colloquy in every case, namely, that “(1) twelve 
members of the community compose a jury, (2) the defendant may 
take part in jury selection, (3) a jury verdict must be 
unanimous, and (4) the court alone decides [whether a defendant 
is ]guilt[y or not guilty] [] if the defendant waives a jury 
trial.” State v. Friedman , 93 Hawai‘ i 63, 69, 996 P.2d 268, 274 
(2000) (quoting 113 F.3d at 1002). In this case, however, the 
record of the change of plea colloquy only mentions the first factor. The record does not touch on the second, namely, 
Krstoth’s right to take part in jury selection. The circuit 
court’s statement that the twelve jurors are “randomly selected” 
does not mention that the defense, the court and the State are 
all involved in selecting a jury.  Likewise, the colloquy does 
not touch on the third factor, that a jury verdict must be 
unanimous. With respect to the fourth factor, that the court alone decides whether a defendant is guilty or not guilty if the 
defendant waives a jury trial, the circuit court informed 
Krstoth that he has a right to jury trial, but did not even 
mention that he could opt for a bench trial.  Especially 
considering Krstoth’s education and limited English proficiency, 
14     
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
this advisement regarding his right to jury trial was clearly 
deficient, and does not establish on the record an intelligent, 
knowing, and voluntary waiver of his right to jury trial, as 
required by Solomon . Thus, the record of the change of plea 
colloquy does not establish Krsto th’s waiver of his 
constitutional right to a jury trial. 
Moreover, the change of plea colloquy is deficient in 
several additional ways, which also result in the record failing to establish a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent change of 
plea. The circuit court told Krstoth that if he had a jury 
trial, the jury “listen[s] to the evidence, and the jury decides 
if the evidence is sufficient to find you guilty .” This 
suggests that Krstoth could be found guilty based on 
“sufficient” evidence, not e vidence proving him guilty beyond a 
reasonable doubt. In addition, the colloquy suggests that the 
only motions that could be filed on his behalf would be those to 
“challenge the charge.” It states that a right to a public and speedy trial “means the pros ecutor must present its case [] as 
quickly as possible.” This suggests that the trial itself must 
be rushed, and not that the trial must commence within a certain 
time frame. Finally, the circuit court actually told Krstoth 
that he could not change his mind and ask for a trial after he 
was sentenced. This implies that he could change his mind and

 Q  In addition to the agreement, Mr. Krstoth, I have  
told the attorneys that I believe that the minimum sentence of 15 years is a sufficient amount of time in this case.   
 
  
  
 
                         
 5  Having ruled based on these obvious deficiencies in the change of 
plea colloquy, we do not address Krstoth’s assertion that he was pressured 
into changing his plea.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
withdraw his plea before he was sentenced, which is precisely 
what he tried to do. 
In addition, another major deficiency in the colloquy fails 
to establish a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent change of 
plea based on the record.  The circuit court’s colloquy with 
respect to Krstoth’s sentence reflects the following: 
. . . Five, you’ll be sentenced to a life term of 
imprisonment with the possibility of parole. That both you 
and the State agree that you’ll serve 15 years as a minimum 
sentence before you can be considered for parole.  
. . .  
This colloquy fails to mention that it is the Hawai‘ i 
Paroling Authority, and not the circuit court, that 
determines the actual minimum sentence that Krstoth would 
have to serve before he could be considered for parole. 
For those reasons, the record of the colloquy fails to 
establish a valid voluntary, knowing, and intelligent 
change of plea.5 
We note that, overall, the manner in which the circuit 
court questioned Krstoth also raises questions regarding whether 
Krstoth voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly entered his 
plea with an understanding of the nature of the charge against 
16

him and the consequences of his plea. Specifically, the circuit 
court received one word responses from Krstoth and found that 
these responses indicated his understanding that he had a choice 
to plead guilty. “A ‘language barrier’ between the defendant 
and the court is a ‘salient fact’ that puts the trial court on 
notice that a defendant’s waiver may be ‘less than knowing and 
intelligent.’” Phua, 135 Hawai‘ i at 513, 353 P.3d at 1055 
(quoting Gomez-Lobato , 130 Hawai‘ i at 471, 312 P.3d at 903 
(holding that questions asked during a colloquy about a jury-
waiver form were not sufficient to establish that a defendant 
knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to a 
jury trial where a language barrier existed and the court 
elicited only one word “yes” or “no” responses rather than 
determining whether the defendant clearly understood the 
constitutional right he was giving up)). As we stated in Phua, 
“[i]n some circumstances, it may be necessary for a trial court to ask follow up questions to confirm the defendant’s 
understanding of” rights he may be waiving. 135 Hawai‘ i at 514, 
353 P.3d at 1056. 
In this case, the record does not establish that Krstoth 
knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his or her 
rights by changing his plea, as required by law. Therefore, 
“fair and just reasons” existed for granting a withdrawal of his 
plea. Moreover, the State did not argue that it would be

          *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
substantially prejudiced by the withdrawal of the plea.  
Accordingly, the circuit  court’s denial of Krstoth’s  motion to 
withdraw plea constituted an abuse of discretion, and the ICA 
erred in affirming the circuit court’s Judgment of Conviction 
and Sentence.  
V. Conclusion 
We therefore 
vacate the ICA’s September 9, 2015 Judgment on 
Appeal and the circuit court’s August 1, 2014 Judgment of 
Conviction and Sentence, and remand to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
