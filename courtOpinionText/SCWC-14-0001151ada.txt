OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J.

 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant Ryan Nakamitsu 
(Nakamitsu) was convicted of one count of Operating a Vehicle 
Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of 
Hawaiʻi Revised S tatutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or § 291E   - 
 
 
 
                          
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
   
   
   
 
      
            
          
          
 
          
       
          ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
61(a)(3).1   The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) vacated  the 
conviction for OVUII based on HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), reversed the  
conviction for OVUII based on HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), and remanded 
for proceedings consistent with its opinion.   
In essence, Petitioner Nakamitsu argues that his 
conviction under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) should be reversed rather 
than vacated and remanded for a new trial.  Four principal   
issues are presented on certiorari.  The first three issues are 
raised by Nakamitsu: (1) whether the ICA gravely erred in 
holding that the charge was not fatally defective for failing to 
include the statutory definition of the term “alcohol”;  (2) 
1 Nakamitsu was charged with one count of Operating a Vehicle Under 
the Influence of an Intoxicant under the two alternate (and/or) statutory 
bases of HRS § 291E- 61(a)(1) and HRS § 291E- 61(a)(3).  Roughly speaking, HRS 
§ 291E-61(a)(1) prohibits operating a vehicle while impaired by an 
intoxicant, while HRS § 291E -61(a)(3) prohibits operating a vehicle while the 
driver’s blood alcohol content exceeds a statutorily -specified level.  
Because the two bases can overlap, they are often charged in the 
conjunctive/disjunctive. See State v. Codiamat, 131 Hawaiʻ i 220, 224, 317 
P.3d 664, 668 (2013)(noting that “the preferred method for charging an 
offense that may be committed in more than one way is to charge in the 
conjunctive/disjunctive —-alleging that the defendant committed the offense 
in one way and/or in another way.”). 
HRS § 291E -61 (2007) provides in relevant part: 
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under the 
    influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or assumes 
actual physical control of a vehicle:
 (1) While under the influence of alcohol in an amount 
sufficient to impair the person’s normal mental
 faculties or ability to care for the person and
  guard against casualty; [or]
 . . . .
 (3) With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred 
ten liters of breath[.]

  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
whether the ICA gravely erred in holding that the district court 
did not err in denying Nakamitsu’s motion to strike Officer 
Desiderio’s testimony ; and (3) whether the ICA gravely erred in 
holding that there was substantial evidence to support 
Nakamitsu’s conviction under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1).  We consider 
sua sponte a fourth issue, whether the district court’s 
admonishment of Nakamitsu for his decision to pursue trial 
violated his constitutional rights to due process and against 
self-incrimination.  
We hold that the ICA did not err concerning the first 
and third issues. We find it unnecessary to consider the second 
issue as to whether the ICA erred in affirming the district 
court’s denial of Nakamitsu’s motion to strike Officer 
Desiderio’s testimony. On the fourth issue, we find that the 
district court’s admonishment of Nakamitsu may have violated his 
constitutional rights to due process and against self-
incrimination. We affirm the judgment of the ICA vacating the conviction for OVUII in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), 
reversing the conviction for OVUII in violation of HRS § 291E -
61(a)(3), and remanding for a new trial.

I. BACKGROUND
 
A. District Court Proceedings 
Nakamitsu is an engineer at Pearl Harbor.  In June, 
2014, the State charged Nakamitsu with one count of Operating a 
Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant as a first time 
offender.2 
Nakamitsu filed a Motion to Dismiss Count 1 for 
Failure to State an Offense.3 He argued that the OVUII charge in 
Count 1 was insufficient because it failed to include the 
definition of “alcohol” as defined in HRS § 291E-1.  The State 
opposed the Motion, arguing that the Complaint’s reference to “alcohol” was consistent with its co mmonly-understood meaning.  
After a hearing, the court denied the Motion.
4 
1. Direct Examination of Officer Desiderio 
At trial, Officer Desiderio testified that he 
responded to a vehicular accident on June 1, 2014 around 
2 In Count 2, Nakamitsu was charged with Inattention to Driving 
under HRS § 291- 12.  He entered a plea of no contest, and his motion for 
deferred acceptance of his plea was granted. In Count 3, Nakamitsu was 
charged with Driving Without Motor Vehicle Insurance under HRS § § 431:10C-
104(a)and 431:10C- 117(a).  However, Count 3 was not prosecuted after 
Nakamitsu provided proof of insurance. 
3 Nakamitsu also filed a Motion to Suppress his Blood Alcohol Level 
(BAC) result, arguing that Hawaiʻi's implied consent law and the HRS Chapter 
291E provisions criminalizing the refusal to submit to BAC testing were unconstitutional. The district court summarily denied the motion at trial. 
4 The Honorable David W. Lo presided.

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
4:50 a.m. Upon arriving at the scene, he saw a vehicle on the 
side of the road in front of a light post that had fallen to the 
ground. A man (later identified as Nakamitsu) walked from the 
vehicle and knelt on the side of the road. Nakamitsu told 
Officer Desiderio that he had been driving the vehicle, and then 
began crying. Officer Desiderio detected the smell of alcohol 
on Nakamitsu’s body and breath. Officer Desiderio testified 
that Nakamitsu was attempting to balance himself and uttering 
something approximating “I’m fucked, I’m fucked.”  Officer 
Desiderio then conducted a Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST). Nakamitsu exhibited six clues, and failed the 
Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) portion of the test.  According 
to Officer Desiderio, during the Walk-and-Turn section of the  
test Nakamitsu kept trying to keep his balance.  
On direct examination, in regard to the Walk-and-Turn 
and One-Leg Stand segments of the test, the State refreshed 
Officer Desiderio’s recollection with a copy of his SFST report:  
[STATE]: Do you remember what --  any clues exhibited 
during the instructional portion of the . . . [Walk and 
Turn] test?  
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO ]: Can’t recall it. I have it in 
my report that I submitted.  
 
[STATE]: Would anything refresh your recollection?  
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO]: Yes, my report that I submitted.  
 
. . . .  
 
[STATE]: Officer, is --  you recognize this document?  
5
  
 
 
 
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO ]: Yes, ma’am.  
 
[STATE]: What is this?  
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO]: This is  -- what we use for [sic] 
SFST sheet, the standard  -- 
 
[STATE]: Is this the . . . [S]FST sheet you used that 
night?  
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO ]: Yes, ma’am.  
 
[STATE]: Can you refresh your recollection.  
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO]: Okay.  
 
After a further exchange regarding the Walk-and-Turn 
segment of the test, the State then asked Officer Desiderio about  
Nakamitsu’s performance on the One -Leg Stand test:  
[STATE]: And do you recall what you observed?  
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO]: Yes.  Everything is recorded in 
the report I submitted.  
 
[STATE]: All right . . . . [H]ow many clues can be 
exhibited? Do you remember?  
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO ]: No, I don’t. I -–   
 
[STATE]: Would you like to --   
 
. . . .  
 
[STATE]: --  refresh your memory --   
 
. . . .  
 
[STATE]: --  with your report?  
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO]: --  yes.  
 
. . . .  
 
[STATE]: Do you independently remember this, once you 
looked at your report? Do you remember how [Nakamitsu] did on the test?  
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO]: Yeah, somewhat remember.   
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
6
  
 
 
 
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
[STATE]: Okay.  And do you remember what you observed 
about how he did the test?  
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO]: Basically, he hops. I --  I do 
remember [him] putting his foot down at 19 seconds and 
[sic] kind of swayed sideways. And then –- yeah, he wasn’t 
able to keep his balance during that time.  
 
. . . .  
 
[STATE]: Officer, how many clues did he exhibit on 
the one- leg stand, do you remember?  
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO]: At least --  I would say four or 
more.  
2.  Cross-Examination of Officer Desiderio  
During cross-examination, Officer Desiderio described 
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) 
standards for administering and grading the SFST. He testified that, in order to be valid, the SFST must be administered and 
graded in accordance with the NHTSA. Nakamitsu’s counsel 
proceeded to ask Officer Desiderio about Nakamitsu’s performance 
on the SFST: 
[NAKAMITSU’S COUNSEL ]: Now, on Wednesday you 
testified that [Nakamitsu] took several more steps than 
instructed on the walk -and-turn.  B ut isn’t it true that he 
only took one extra step?  
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO]: Whatever it is in my report, that 
I wrote in there, that’s basically what it -- 
 
[NAKAMITSU’S COUNSEL ]: If I showed you a copy of your 
report would . . . it refresh your recollection.    
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO]: Yes.  
 
Yes. So on the first nine step [sic], took an 
additional one. And I believe that’s the reason why I –- I 
did put that made the turn, not as instructed.  
 
[NAKAMITSU’S COUNSEL ]: Okay. But not several extra 
steps, just one; correct?  
7
  
 
 
 
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO]: I believe so.  
Officer Desiderio continued to testify without the aid 
of his report that while Nakamitsu performed the Walk-and-Turn 
test, the officer was facing the sidewalk, standing mid-way 
between the starting and turn points of the imaginary line used 
for the test. When asked if Nakamitsu walked off the line during the first set of steps, Officer Desiderio said he would 
need his report to refresh his memory. Nakamitsu’s counsel then 
asked Officer Desiderio if he had any independent recollection 
of the SFST, or if his testimony was solely based on his reading 
the SFST report:  
[NAKAMITSU’S COUNSEL ]: Okay. Now, when the prosecutor 
was asking you questions and when I’m asking you questions 
. . . you need to refer to your report to testify about what 
your recollection is of --  of this particular  field sobriety 
test; correct?  
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO]: Yes.  
 
[NAKAMITSU’S COUNSEL ]: Do you have any independent 
recollection of . . . Nakamitsu’s performance on the test? 
Or is it, basically, just reading from your report?  
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO]: I do have independent 
recollection, not necessarily of the --  when he was taking 
the test.  
 
[NAKAMITSU’S COUNSEL ]: Okay. So you remember the 
incident?  
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO]: Yes.  
 
[NAKAMITSU’S COUNSEL ]: You remember Mr. Nakamitsu?  
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO]: Yes.  
 
[NAKAMITSU’S COUNSEL ]: You remember administering the 
test to him?
  
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO]: Yes. 
  
8
  
 
 
 
  
[NAKAMITSU’S COUNSEL ]: But the details of the results 
you don’t remember?  
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO]: Whatever I wrote in there --  
because while I was testing, okay, I’ll be, like, making 
tick marks, either when I was (indiscernible) if I have a 
glove or right on my hand.  
 
. . . .  
 
[NAKAMITSU’S COUNSEL ]: Without looking at your writing 
or your notes or  the -- your report, you’re not able to 
testify about his performance on the field sobriety test?  
 
[OFFICER DESIDERIO]: Well, I would need my report.    
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Nakamitsu’s counsel moved to strike Officer 
Desiderio’s testimony describing Nakamitsu’s SFST on the grounds 
that the officer could not testify without his report.   The 
State responded that Officer Desiderio could recall  details 
surrounding the SFST, but could not be expected to remember all 
details about Nakamitsu’s performance without the aid of his 
report.  The district court denied Nakamitsu’s motion.  
3.  Testimony of Officer Tabanera  
Officer Tabanera testified that on June 1, 2014, at  
approximately 4:15 a.m., he arrived at the scene of the accident 
and observed that Nakamitsu’s eyes were red and glassy . Officer 
Tabanera also testified that Nakamitsu smelled like alcohol.  
Officer Tabanera investigated the accident and observed 
Nakamitsu’s vehicle resting at the base of a street light pole, 
and the pole dislodged and laying on the ground. The front 
bumper and engine area of Nakamitsu’s vehicle were severely 
9

  
 
 
 
  
    ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
damaged. Officer Tabanera did not see any marks on the road 
that would have resulted from use of a vehicle’s brakes, and he 
did not observe any other vehicles or obstructions on the road. 
4. District Court Ruling and Sentencing 
The court found Nakamitsu guilty as charged under  both 
HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and   HRS § 291E-61 (a)(3), deciding that 
Officer Desiderio’s testimony was unnecessary for the 
conviction:    
THE COURT: Court finds the evidence beyond a 
reasonable doubt to find [Nakamitsu] guilty on both the 
291E-61(a)(1) as well as the [291E] -61(a)(3) charge.  And 
the court finds [Nakamitsu] guilty based on what happened.  
 
And Court also finds that evidence  concerning the 
[SFST], while there is some questions as to the weight or  
. . . the manner in which Officer Desiderio gave his 
testimony that it was not even necessary to convict the 
defendant, find the defendant guilty on the (a)(1) charge.  
 
After issuing the court ruling, the district judge 
asked Nakamitsu for any final words before imposing the 
sentence. Nakamitsu expressed remorse for his actions affecting 
his job and family, and apologized to the court.   The judge then 
heard from the State, which asked for a $500.00 fine and minimum  
sentencing. Nakamitsu’s counsel agreed to the $500.00  fine, 
acknowledging his client’s remorse .   The judge accepted  
Nakamitsu’s  apology, but raised his concern that Nakamitsu did 
not readily accept  responsibility at the outset of trial:  
[THE COURT]: I am totally convinced he’s very 
remorseful. I’m totally convinced that it’s not going to 
happen again. I really find that Mr. Nakamitsu was 
10
  
 
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
remorseful at the scene of the accident.  But what bothers 
the Court the most is that acceptance of responsibility was 
not readily done.  
 
[COUNSEL FOR NAKAMITSU]:  And, Your Honor, there are 
cases --  there are cases where we --  people are not willing 
to accept responsibility because they are just not those types of people. In this case there are two legal issues 
that I explained to Mr. Nakamitsu and explained the issues 
on appeal. And it’s not because he didn’t want to accept 
responsibility; it was because these issues are out there and we would like to appeal.  
 
. . . .   
 
[THE COURT]: I mean, does he have to hit a person on 
the sidewalk for you folks to accept responsibility? I 
mean, that’s -- the conduct is no different. That’s what I 
find so bothersome.  
 
[COUNSEL FOR NAKAMITSU]:  I understand.  
 
[THE COURT]: And you were warned about this. You 
guys wanted to play with fire, and somebody’s going to get burned.  
. . . .  
 
[THE COURT]: What is it going to take to accept 
responsibility? You know, after Wednesday’s testimony -- I 
didn’t want to pre -judge this case, but just on what 
happened, this is a person that should be in jail. So you 
guys want to play with fire, you suffer the consequences. 
Someone’s going to get burned. All I can say is, best of 
luck on appeal. But I have to do what I have to do.  
 
[COUNSEL FOR NAKAMITSU]:  Yes, Your Honor.  
 
[THE COURT]: You’re not the type I think needs to go 
to jail, Mr. Nakamitsu. But what really bothers me is your 
-- the four of you discussing that you want to roll the 
dice.  
  
You  know, somebody on your behalf came to court on 
June 30th, within 30 days after this incident. If you’re 
really remorseful, that’s when responsibility should have 
been taken. I don’t fault you. You hired an attorney. 
You hired a good attorney, that advised you.  I think all 
of you made the wrong decision. That’s what I find 
bothersome.  
 
[COUNSEL FOR NAKAMITSU]:  And, Your Honor, I --  I -–  
I would ask that, you know, maybe my advice wasn’t -- 
wasn’t the good advice; but I would -- I would ask you to 
not take that out against my client.  I --  I understand 
that ultimately it’s his choice. But he hires an attorney 
11
  
 
 
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
for advice. If you’re going to take it out against 
somebody, I ask that you take it out against me and --  not 
my client.  
 
[THE COURT]: Well, I am.   
 
[COUNSEL FOR NAKAMITSU]:  Yeah.  
 
[THE COURT]: And, you know, I don’t want to take it 
out against any --  any -- any -- any -- any defendant 
personally. But, Mr. [Counsel for Nakamitsu], I’ve been talking to you for over a year now --  and I’m going to put 
this on the record.  
 
[COUNSEL FOR NAKAMITSU]:  Okay.  
 
[THE COURT]: I admire you as an attorney, but you 
have a history of all take and no give. I don’t -- I don’t 
see you accepting responsibility when  you should.   
 
You were warned about this. I told you on Wednesday. 
I asked you, you want to roll the dice on this one?  You 
say, let me talk to my client. All right, talk to him; and 
that was his decision. But you guys want to play with 
fire, you’re going to get burned, guarantee.  
 
Status of the license?  
 
. . . .  
 
[THE COURT]: I’m revoking it for one year, 
forthwith. 750 dollar fine. Undergo substance abuse assessment and classes. 107 DE. 30 CVCF. 25 neurotrauma. 
100 DDRA.  
 
You know, my thoughts were to –  to give you 1,000 
dollar fine and –  and make you perform 72 hours of  
community service, as well. I’ll back off on that. All right. That’s all.   
B.   ICA Decision   
In a memorandum opinion, the ICA affirmed the district  
court’s rulings regarding  the issues raised by Nakamitsu in his 
appeal. First, the ICA explained that in State v. Turping , 136 
Hawaiʻi 333, 361  P.3d 1236  (App. 2015), the court rejected the  
argument that a charge was deficient for failing to include the 
12

  
 
 
 
definition of alcohol. The ICA also noted its previous  
rejection of the argument that alcohol, as defined  by HRS §  
291E-1, is limited to distilled forms in State v. Tsujimura , 137 
Hawaiʻi 117, 120,  366 P.3d 173, 176 (App. 2016), as corrected  
(May 2, 2016). The ICA in Tsujimura   read the plain language of 
HRS § 291E- 1’s definition of “alcohol” as specifically including 
ethyl alcohol. Because ethyl alcohol is the intoxicating agent 
in beer and wine, the Tsujimura court reasoned that the  
statutory definition includes both beer and wine, as well as 
5 distilled liquors.   Id.  at 120, 366 P.3d at 176.  
                          
    
 
   
   
     ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
Second, regarding the admissibility of Officer 
Desiderio’s testimony, the ICA concluded that “although Officer 
Desiderio’s recollection of Nakamitsu’s performance on the SFST 
had to be repeatedly refreshed, his testimony was not based on 
his memory of the report only” because Officer Desiderio 
remembered significant details about the incident prior to 
refreshing his memory with the report, and did not state that 
his testimony was based  only on reading the report .   
Third, the ICA examined the record of the two 
colloquies required in cases where a defendant chooses not to 
5 We recently upheld the ICA’s holding in Tsujimura that “alcohol” 
is not limited to alcohol produced through distillation, but we vacated the 
judgment and remanded the case for a new trial on constitutional grounds. 
State v. Tsujimura, Slip Op. at 15 -19, 52, 2017 WL 2361154, at *6 -7, *18 (May 
31, 2017). 
13
  
 
 
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
testify: (1)  the “prior-to-trial colloquy  ,” and (2) the 
“ultimate colloquy.”   Although Nakamitsu had not raised the 
issue, the ICA reviewed it for plain error.  In light of 
Tachibana v. State , 79 Hawaiʻ i 226 , 236, 900 P.2d 1293, 1303 
(1995), the ICA held that the ultimate colloquy between the 
district court and Nakamitsu was deficient. Because the ICA 
could not say that the deficiency was harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt, it vacated Nakamitsu’s conviction for OVUII 
under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1).    
Fourth, having determined that the ultimate colloquy 
was deficient and that it was not harmless error, the ICA 
conducted a review  of the sufficiency of the evidence to 
convict.  See  State v. Davis , 133 Hawai ʻi 102, 120,  324 P.3d 912, 
930 (2014) (given the constitutional protection against double jeopardy, as well as policy reasons, “a reviewing court is 
required under article I, section 10 of the Hawaiʻ i  Constitution 
to address a defendant’s express claim of insufficiency of the 
evidence prior to remanding for a new trial based on a defective charge.”)   The ICA found sufficient evidence to convict 
Nakamitsu of OVUII in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1).  It  
based this conclusion on Officer Desiderio’s testimony that 
Nakamitsu walked away from a vehicle on the side of the road 
that was in front of a fallen light post, that he smelled of 
14

  
 
 
 
   
  
   
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
                         
    
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
alcohol, tried to balance himself, knelt down, and volunteered 
expletives lamenting the seriousness of his actions, and that he 
had failed the SFST. In reaching its holding, the ICA also 
considered Officer Tabanera ’s testimony that Nakamitsu had red 
and glassy eyes, that the vehicle’s front bumper and engine were 
severely damaged, and that there were no marks on the road 
suggesting the vehicle ’s brakes were applied.  
Fifth, the ICA held that the district court erred in 
denying Nakamitsu’s motion in limine to suppress his blood 
alcohol content measurement. Without the inadmissible BAC 
evidence, there was insufficient evidence to support the 
conviction for OVUII under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3).  Accordingly, 
the ICA reversed Nakamitsu’s convictio n under HRS § 291E -
61(a)(3).6 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Statutory Interpretation 
“When construing a statute, this court’s foremost 
obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of 
the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the 
language contained in the statute itself. In addition, we must 
read statutory language in the context of the entire statute and

B. Sufficiency of the Evidence 
“[E]vidence adduced in the trial court must be 
considered in the strongest light for the prosecution when the 
appellate court passes on the legal sufficiency of such evidence 
to support a conviction . . . .   The test on appeal is not 
whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt, but 
whether there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion 
of the trier of fact.” State v. Richie , 88 Hawaiʻ i  19, 33, 960 
P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998)(citation omitted).

DISCUSSION 
A. The OVUII Charge Was Not Defective for Failing to Define 
“Alcohol” 
On appeal, Nakamitsu argues the ICA gravely erred in 
holding that the OVUII charge was not fatally defective for 
failing to define “alcohol.” According to Nakamitsu, the 
7 definition of “alcohol” in HRS § 291E -1 is limited to the 
7 For purposes of the OVUII offense at issue here, “alcohol” is 
defined as follows: 
Alcohol means the product of distillation of any fermented 
liquid, regardless of whether rectified, whatever may be 
the origin thereof, and includes ethyl alcohol, lower 
aliphatic alcohol, and phenol as well as synthetic ethyl 
alcohol, but not denatured or other alcohol that is 
(continued. . .) 
16
  
 
 
 
                          
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
products of distillation, and does not include beer or wine.  He 
argues that a plain reading of the definition shows that for 
purposes of the statute, “alcohol” only encompasses “products of 
distillation” —  - i.e., liquor.  Thus, he contends the OVUII  
charge did not adequately inform him of the nature and cause of the accusation against him because it failed to include the  
definition of alcohol.  
We recently addressed this issue in State v. 
Tsujimura, Slip Op. at 15-19, 2017 WL 2361154, at *6-7   (May 31, 
2017).   Like Nakamitsu,  the defendant in Tsujimura argued that  
the definition of “alcohol” in HRS §  291E-1 is limited to the 
products of distillation.  After carefully analyzing  the 
statute, we  concluded that the meaning of “alcohol” in that 
statute “is inclusive of ethyl alcohol, also commonly known as 
ethanol, which ‘is the intoxicating agent in beer, wine, and 
other fermented and distilled liquors.’   Accordingly, the 
statutory definition of ‘alcohol’  includes beer, wine, and other 
fermented liquors because these substances contain ethanol. ” 
Tsujimura, Slip Op. at 18, 2017 WL 2361154, at *7 (citation 
(. . . continued) 
considered not potable under the customs laws of the United 
States.  
 
HRS § 291E- 1 (2007).  In 2016, the legislature simplified and 
clarified the definition.  2016 Haw. Sess. Laws, Act 231, § 59 
(“‘Alcohol’ means ethanol or any substance containing ethanol.”)

omitted, footnotes omitted). Given our recent holding in 
Tsujimura, we conclude  that the ICA properly determined  that 
Nakamitsu’s charge was not fatally defective for failing to include the statutory definition of “alcohol .”    
B. 	 Substantial Evidence Supports  Nakamitsu’s Conviction Under 
 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1)   
In reviewing for sufficiency of the evidence to 
support a conviction, we consider evidence admitted at trial “
in 
the strongest light for the prosecution . . . . The test on appeal is not whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable 
doubt, but whether there was substantial evidence to support the 
conclusion of the trier of fact.” Richie, 88 Hawaiʻ i at 33, 960 
P.2d at 1241 (citation omitted); Davis , 133 Hawaiʻ i at 116, 324 
P.3d 926 (noting that even where the appellate court finds trial 
error, “challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence must 
always be decided on appeal” or retrial would raise double 
jeopardy concerns (citation omitted)).  Nakamitsu argues that 
without Officer Desiderio’s testimony regarding the SFST, and given the absence of any direct evidence establishing how the 
accident occurred, there was insufficient evidence to convict 
him of OVUII.  
In addition to testifying regarding the SFST, Officer 
Desiderio also testified that he observed the vehicle on the 
side of the road in front of a light post that had fallen, and 
18
  
 
 
 
  
  
    
 
  
   
 
    
 
   
 
 
  ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
that Nakamitsu walked away from the vehicle, had some difficulty 
keeping his balance, knelt down, cried, admitted he was the 
driver of the vehicle, and smelled of alcohol. His speech was 
slurred and his face was flushed. In addition, Officer Tabanera 
described Nakamitsu as having red and glassy eyes and emitting 
the smell of an intoxicant. Officer Tabanera testified that the 
vehicle had come to rest on top of the streetlight post, and 
that the vehicle’s front bumper and engine area were severely 
damaged. He also testified that there were no marks on the 
ground indicating the brakes had been applied, and that there 
were no other obstructions on the roadway. 
Considering the testimony of the two officers in the 
most favorable light for the prosecution, we conclude that —-
even absent the testimony of Officer Desiderio regarding Nakamitsu’s performance on the SFST — - there was substantial 
evidence that Nakamitsu operated his vehicle under the influence of alcohol in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1). Accordingly, we find it unnecessary to consider whether Officer Desiderio ’s 
recollection was refreshed when he testified about Nakamitsu’s 
performance on the SFST.

C.	 The District Court ’s Admonishment of Nakamitsu for His 
Decision to Pursue Trial May Have Violated His 
Constitutional Rights to Due Process and Against Self-
incrimination 
At sentencing, the district court judge made comments 
to Nakamitsu and his counsel regarding Nakamitsu’s decision to 
proceed with trial. Before discussing those comments, we note 
that the ICA remanded for a new trial based on the deficiency of 
the ultimate colloquy. While we affirm the I CA’s decision, we 
nonetheless address this issue in order to provide guidance 
regarding a court’s reliance on a defendant’s refusal to admit 
guilt in imposing a sentence. See Chun v. Bd. of Trustees of 
Employees’ Ret. Sys. of State of Hawaii , 92 Hawaiʻ i 432, 434 –35, 
992 P.2d 127, 129–30 (2000)(noting that although the court’s 
holding on one point “ is outcome-dispositive of the present 
appeal,” the court would address an additional issue “in order 
to provide guidance to the parties and the circuit court on remand”). 
Due process, as guaranteed under article I, section 5,  
of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution,
8 requires that a defendant be 
sentenced by an impartial judge.  Peters v. Jamieson, 48 Haw. 
247, 255, 397 P.2d 575, 582 (1964); State v. Silva , 78 Hawaiʻ i 
8 The Hawaiʻ i Constitution provides , in relevant part, “No person 
shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law . . 
. .” Haw. Const. art. I, § 5.

 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
115, 118, 890 P.2d 702, 705 (1995),   abrogated on other grounds 
by Tachibana v. State , 79 Hawaiʻ i  226, 900 P.2d 1293 (1995).   A  
judge must remain impartial during trial, never “assum[ing] the 
role of an advocate for either party.” State v. Schutter , 60 
Haw. 221, 222, 588 P.2d 428, 429  (1978).  If a judge succumbs to  
partiality, the resulting sentence must  be set aside.  Territory 
v. Van Culin, 36 Haw. 153, 162 (1942).     
During sentencing,  a judge may consider a defendant’s 
guilty plea, indications of remorse, and commitment to rehabilitation. 
State v. Mata , 71 Haw. 319, 326, 789 P.2d 1122,  
1126 (1990). However, a judge may not “induce a plea of guilt y  
by hinting at more lenient sentencing without violating  . . . a  
defendant’s constitutional rights.”   Id.   Nor may a court “infer 
a lack of remorse from a criminal defendant’s refusal to admit 
guilt.”   State v. Kamanaʻ o, 103 Hawai ʻi 315, 321, 8 2 P.3d 401, 
407 (2003), as corrected  (Dec. 17, 2003).   In other words, while 
lack of remorse legitimately may be considered as a factor in 
sentencing, a court may never cross the line into attempting   “to 
compel an admission of guilt or punish the defendant for 
maintaining his innocence.”  Kamanaʻo, 103 Hawaiʻ i  at 321, 82 
P.3d at 407 (citation omitted).  Such an attempt would raise due   
process questions concerning the court’s impartiality. It would 
also violate the defendant’s right against self -incrimination.   
21

  
 
 
 
  
 
 
     
 
     
 
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
See id. at 320-321, 82 P.3d at 406-407 (“Although most commonly 
reviewed in the context of the adjudicatory phase of a trial 
proceeding, the privilege against self-incrimination applies 
with equal force during sentencing.”) . 
In Kamana ʻo, this court adopted a three-factor test 
from the Michigan Supreme Court to determine whether the 
sentencing court erroneously relied on a defendant’s refusal to 
admit guilt in imposing a sentence. Id. at 323, 82 P.3d at 409. 
The factors we considered were (1) the defendant’s maintenance 
of innocence after the conviction, (2) the judge’s attempt to 
get the defendant to admit guilt, and (3) the appearance that, 
had the defendant affirmatively admitted guilt, his sentence would not have been so severe. Id. We explained that “if there 
is an indication of the three factors, then the sentence was 
likely to have been improperly influenced by the defendant’s 
persistence in his innocence.” Id. (quoting People v. Wesley, 
411 N.W.2d 159, 162 (Mich. 1987)). 
Applying these factors to Nakamitsu’s case, we note 
that the district court clearly exhibited frustration with 
Nakamitsu’s decision to maintain his innocence and assert his 
right to trial. The court stated that Nakamitsu’s expression of 
remorse at sentencing was questionable because his counsel did 
not take responsibility for the accident at the first court 
22
  
 
 
 
   
 
          
          
          
      
  
 ____*** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***____ 
date, and “[i]f you’re really remorseful, that’s when 
responsibility should have been taken.” The court unequivocally 
identified Nakamitsu ’s decision not to take responsibility as 
“the wrong decision.” Nakamitsu was told his decision to 
proceed to trial rather than plead guilty constituted a decision to “play with fire” for which “you’re going to get burned”: 
You were warned about this. I told you on Wednesday. I 
asked you, you want to roll the dice on this one? You say, 
let me talk to my client. All right, talk to him; and that 
was his decision. But you guys want to play with fire, 
you’re going to get burned, gua rantee [sic]. 
Based on this record, it is reasonable to infer that  
the sentence was “likely to have been improperly influenced by 
the defendant’s persistence in his innocence.” Kamanaʻo , 103 
Hawaiʻi at 323, 8 2 P.3d at 409 (quoting People v. Wesley , 411 
N.W.2d 159, 162 (Mich. 1987).   If the district court erroneously  
relied on Nakamitsu ’s refusal to admit guilt in i mposing its  
sentence, that reliance would have violated  Nakamitsu’s  
constitutional right  to due process and  his right against  self-
incrimination.   See  Bordenkircher v. Hayes , 434 U.S. 357, 363 
(1978) (“To punish a person because he has done what the law 
plainly allows him to do is a due process violation of the most 
basic sort”  (citation omitted)); Kamana ʻo, 103 Hawai ʻi at 320, 82  
P.3d at 406-407.   It is not necessary for us  to resolve the  
question of improper influence in this case, as we affirm the

ICA’s judgment vacating and remanding for a new trial on another 
ground. Nonetheless, we stress that, under article I, section 5 
of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution, a sentencing court may not rely on a 
defendant’s persistence in maintaining his or her innocence in 
imposing a sentence. 
IV.  CONCLUSION  
The ICA  reversed Nakamitsu’s conviction for OVUII in 
violation of HRS §  291E-61(a)(3), vacated his conviction for 
OVUII in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1)  based on the 
deficiency of the ultimate colloquy, and remanded for a new  
trial. For the reasons  detailed above, we affirm the ICA ’s 
February 25, 2016 judgment on appeal.
