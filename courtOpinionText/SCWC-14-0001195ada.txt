 I. Introduction 
 The issue at the core of this appeal is whether courts must 
advise defendants that restitution is a possible consequence of 
conviction before accepting a guilty or no contest plea.  
Petitioner 
Kristopher Kealoha (“Kealoha”) appeals the Circuit 
Court of the First Circuit’s (“circuit court”) Judgments of  
Conviction and Sentence in three criminal cases.1  In a Hawai‘i 
Rules of Penal Procedure (“HRPP”) Rule 11 plea agreement with 
the State of Hawai ‘i (“State”) to which the circuit court agreed 
to be bound, Kealoha agreed to plead guilty in all three cases, 
provided that he would be sentenced to serve concurrent terms of 
imprisonment, the longest of which would be five years.   
On appeal, Kealoha asserts the circuit court violated that 
agreement by also sentencing him to pay restitution.  He argues 
he should be resentenced in conformity with his plea agreement, 
without being required to pay restitution.  He alternatively 
argues he should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea.  The 
Intermediate Court of App eals (“ICA”) disagreed and affirmed the 
circuit court in its Summary Disposition Order,  State v.  
Kealoha, Nos. CAAP-14-0001195, CAAP -14-0001196, CAAP -14-0001197, 
at 2 (App. Apr. 28, 2017) (SDO ).   
                     
1 The Honorable Dexter D. Del Rosario presided.

 On certiorari, Kealoha asserts that the ICA erred in 
affirming the convictions and not granting him the relief he 
requested.  His appellate counsel also requests that we review 
the ICA’s July 17, 2017 Order Approving in Part and Denying in 
Part Defendant-Appellant’s Request for Attorney’s Fees and Costs 
(“ICA’s July 17, 2017 order”) to the extent it reduced his 
request for attorney’s fees.    
For the reasons stated below,
 we hold that because 
restitution is part of the “maximum penalty provided by law” and 
is a direct consequence of conviction, defendants must be 
appropriately advised and questioned in open court regarding 
their understanding of this possibility before a court can 
accept their pleas.  In so holding, we overrule in part the 
ICA’s opinion in State v. Tuialii , 121 Hawai ‘i 135, 214 P.3d 1125 
(App. 2009), cert. denied , 2010 WL 60962 .  Although the circuit 
court did not conduct a proper colloquy in K ealoha’s case, 
because Kealoha never filed an appropriate motion in the circuit 
court, we affirm his convictions without prejudice to him filing 
a HRPP Rule 40 petition in the circuit court.  We also partially 
grant appellate counsel’s request for an increased award of 
attorney’s fees for his work before the ICA.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 II. Background  
A. Circuit Court Proceedings 
 From 2012 to 2013, Kealoha was charged with a number of 
offenses in three separate criminal cases.  On February 10, 
2012, in Cr. No. 12 -1-224, Kealoha was charged with one count of 
Assault in the Second Degree, in violation of HRS §  707-711 
(1)(a) and/or §707 -711(1)(b) and/or §707 -711(1)(d).2  On March 
12, 2012, in Cr. No. 12 -1-387, Kealoha was charged with one 
count of each of the following:  Unauthorized Control of a 
Propelled Vehicle in violation of HRS § 708 -836, Promoting a 
Dangerous Drug in the Third Degree in violation of HRS § 712 -
1246, Promoting a Detrimental Drug in the Third Degree in 
violation of HRS § 712 -1249, Resisting Arrest in violation of 
HRS § 710-1026(1)(a), Driving Without a License in violation of 
HRS § 286-102, Accidents Involving Bodi ly Injury in violation of 
HRS § 291C
-12.6, and Resisting an Order to Stop a Motor Vehicle 
in violation of HRS § 710 -1027.3  On June 7, 2013,  in Cr. No. 13 -
1-813, Kealoha was charged with one count of Assault in the 
Third Degree, in violation of HRS § 707 -712(1)(a).4     
                     
2  This case was designated as  CAAP-14-1195 on appeal.  
 
3  This case was designated as  CAAP-14-1196 on appeal.   
 
4  This case was designated as  CAAP-14-1197 on appeal.

 1. Change of plea hearing 
 On May 28, 2014, Kealoha pled guilty to all counts in all 
three cases.  At the change of plea hearing, Kealoha indicated 
that he would prefer to go to trial if the court did not bind 
itself to his plea agreement with the State:  
[THE COURT]:  You want to plead guilty in all cases as to 
all counts?  
[THE DEFENDANT]:  If there’ s a deal, Your Honor. If this is 
a Rule 
11, you know what I mean? I don’ t understand exactly 
everything. But if -- if I’m pleading guilty and it’ s a 
Rule 11 and everybody going give me one open 5 max, that’ s 
it, for everything, then, yeah. Sure, I like take that
deal. But, if it’ s not, Your Honor, I going go trial .   
 
The circuit court then confirmed the existence and terms of the 
plea agreement with Kealoha’s counsel and the State:  
THE COURT:   What is the plea agreement?  
[DEFENSE COUNSEL] :  Everything concurrent.  
THE COURT:  
 And he gets the open term and everything 
concurrent ? 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL] :  Yeah. 
THE COURT:  I will bind myself to this agreemen t. 
THE DEFENDANT:  The open term of 5 years max, that’ s it, 
for everything?  
THE COURT:  And I’m going to make it altogether concurrent.  
THE DEFENDANT:   Right. 
. . . . 
THE DEFENDANT:  Judge -- Your Honor, again, I know you the 
top guy on this, but is the prosecutor, everybody on the 
same page, you know what I mean?  
THE COURT:  Hang on.  
[THE STATE]:  I’ m sorry, Your Honor.  
THE COURT:  Go ahead. 
[THE STATE]:  And I did -- I should have clarified. I did 
orally commit myself to this. I haven ’t signed, but we did 
-- we have discussed this, and I -- I have agreed . 
THE COURT: Okay.  
. . . . 
[THE COURT:]  He just said he ’s agreed to the open 5.  
[THE DEFENDANT:]  And that ’s it? Max? Open 5 max for all 
charges concurrent, again?  
[THE COURT:]  For all  Class C felonies, I going give you 5  
years, and I going have you serve it concurrently, at the 
same time.  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
6 
 Kealoha orally confirmed that he signed the change of plea form 
for each case.  The change of plea forms contained  the following 
boilerplate language in paragraph six: 
6.  I understand that the court may impose any of the 
following penalties for the offense(s) to which I now 
plead:  the maximum term of imprisonment, any 
extended term of imprisonment, and any mandatory 
minimum term of imprisonment specified above; 
consecutive terms of  imprisonment  (if more than one 
charge); restitution; a fine; a fee and/or 
assessment; community service; probation with up to 
one year of imprisonment and other terms and 
conditions.  
 
Attached to each of the change of plea forms were documents 
prepared by counsel labelled “Exhibit A,” which contained a 
brief admission of guilt with respect to each charge and a 
statement that Kealoha reviewed and understood the contents of 
the change of plea form.  When asked whether he reviewed the 
forms with his attorney, Kealoha replied, “[h]e read it to me, 
Your Honor. Yes.”  Kealoha confirmed that he understood what was 
read to him, and that he understood the charges against him.   
 The court explained , and Kealoha stated he understood, that 
based on the plea agreement Kealoha would be sentenced to a 
five-year term of  imprisonment in Cr. No. 12- 1-387, a five-year 
term in Cr. No. 12- 1-224, and a one-year term in Cr. 13- 1-813.  
For the non- felony charge s in Cr. 12 -1-387, the court indicated 
that it would impose lesser jail sentences to run concurrently  
to the five- year terms for the felony charges, and Kealoha 
stated that he understood.  Finally, Kealoha acknowledged that ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
7 
 he still wanted to plead guilty, and acknowledged that he would 
be giving up the right to a trial, stating: “Your Honor, as long 
as it’s a 5 max, I’m good.  I’m good with that.”      
 Restitution was not discussed at the change of plea 
hearing.  
2. Sentencing hearing 
 The s entencing hearing was held on August 20, 2014.    
After Kealoha addressed the court, the circuit court confirmed 
the terms of the plea agreement with his counsel:  
THE COURT:  My understanding is that the plea agreement 
calls for an open term of incarceration to be served 
concurrently with each other.   
[DEFENSE COUNSEL] :  Yes, everything concurrent that hadn ’t 
-- some of them have been served already, too.  
 
The State did not offer any corrections to these statements.  In 
addition to the terms of imprisonment, however, the court then 
also ordered Kealoha to pay restitution in the amount of $633.33 
for Cr. No. 12-1-224 and $4,140.05 for Cr. No. 12 -1-387.  No 
restitution was ordered in Cr. No. 13- 1-813.5   
 After the circuit court announced its sentence, Kealoha 
expressed concerns about being able to pay restitution: 
THE DEFENDANT:  I don’t know how I going -- excuse me, Your 
Honor, but I don’t know how I going pay this.  I cannot 
just do time instead of restitution or just make more 
--    
THE COURT:  You can talk to your lawyer about judgments.  
THE DEFENDANT:  You know what I mean?  
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  We talked about that.   
THE DEFENDANT:  This guy doesn’t really like me that much.   
                     
5  The circuit court waived the Crime Victim Compensation Fee  in each of 
the three cases.    
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
8 
 THE COURT:  Mr. Kealoha, you cannot pay what you don’t 
have.   
THE DEFENDANT:  That’s what I’m  saying.  I feel I cannot 
pay what I don’t have, so would just be more logical if I 
just do it with my time.  You know what I mean?  
[DEFENSE COUNSEL] :  You’re doing the time either way so -- 
THE DEFENDANT:  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  That way, one 
day -- ‘cause where I starting today, I going get my life 
on track, I go outside, get one job.  You know what I mean?  
I just like be free from anything that going hinder my life 
in the future.  You know what I’m saying, right?  
Understand?  
THE COURT:  You can talk to [defense counsel].   
THE DEFENDANT:  Again, I reiterate, this guy doesn’t like 
me. 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:  Whatever. 
 
The circuit court entered a Judgment of Conviction and Sentence 
in each of Kealoha’s cases on August 20, 2014.  Counsel 
subsequently withdrew as Kealoha’s attorney,6 and substitute 
counsel was appointed for appeal.  Kealoha did not file any 
post-sentence motion with the circuit court to set aside the 
restitution order or withdraw his plea. 
                     
6  Counsel asserted in his  motion to withdraw  his belief that Kealoha’s 
claims on appeal were frivolous.  Under Hawai ʻi law, this basis for withdrawal 
was inappropriate. In Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), the United 
States Supreme Court described with approval what is now known as an “Anders 
Brief,” a brief that identifies any appealable issues but allows an attorney 
to move to withdraw as counsel and advise the court that his or her client’s 
claims are frivolous.  In re Mohr, 97 Hawai‘ i 1, 7, n.4, 32 P.3d 647, 653 , n.4 
(2001) (citing Anders, 386 U.S. at 744).   We disapprove  of so-called “Anders  
briefs.”  Mohr, 97 Hawai ‘i at  7, 32 P.3d at 653.  Rather, “[w]e think the 
better policy is to require counsel to remain an advocate for the client,” 
and leave evaluation of the frivolity of claims to the court.  Id.   
 Even if arguments  on appeal are frivolous from counsel’s perspective,  
however, we have held that  “this court will not sanction a court -appointed 
attorney if, after taking into account the totality of the circumstances, 
arguments raised reflect zealous advocacy on behalf of the client.”  Id.; see 
Maddox v. State, 141 Hawai ‘i 196, 204, 407 P.3d 152, 160 (2017)  (quoting Mohr, 
97 Hawai‘ i at 7, 32 P.3d at 653) (reiterating that counsel should remain an 
advocate for the client and has a duty to pursue an appeal, even if 
frivolous, if the criminal defendant so chooses).

 B. ICA Proceedings 
 On April 10, 2015, Kealoha’s three cases were consolidated 
before the ICA.7  In his opening brief, Kealoha argued that 
restitution was never part of the plea agreement to which the 
circuit court agreed to be bound, and therefore he should be 
permitted to withdraw his guilty plea because he did not get the 
benefit of his bargain pursuant to the clear and unambiguous 
terms of the plea agreement.  Kealoha asserted that, because the 
change of plea form did not include any specific amounts of 
restitution to be imposed at sentencing, his guilty plea was not 
knowing, intelligent and volu
ntary as it deviated from the 
specific terms of the plea agreement.    
 In its answering brief, the State argued Kealoha filed no 
motion below to withdraw his guilty plea or to correct his 
“illegal” sentence on the ground his plea was infirm, and that 
Tuialii and HRPP Rule 32(d) required him to file such a motion 
within ten days after imposition of his sentence.  The State 
suggested that, like the defendant in Tuialii, Kealoha should 
have filed an HRPP Rule 40 motion after the ten- day period for 
an HRPP Rule 32(d) motion had elapsed.  The State contended that 
even if Kealoha had filed a motion to withdraw his plea, Tuialii 
holds that restitution is a collateral consequence of a plea, 
and therefore the trial court was not required to apprise him 
                     
7  The cases were consolidated under CAAP -14-1195. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
10 
 that he could be subject to a free- standing order of 
restitution.      
 Additionally, the State asserted Kealoha understood and was 
actually properly advised of the consequences 
of his plea, based 
on the contents of the plea form and the exhibit attached to the 
plea form.  Specifically, the State argued that paragraph six of 
the change of plea forms lists restitution as a possible 
penalty, among other penalties, and that Exhibit A to Kealoha’s 
forms states that Kealoha reviewed and understood the change of 
plea forms, including paragraph 6.      
 
In its SDO, the ICA held the circuit court did not abuse 
its discretion in ordering restitution because restitution was 
statutorily required under HRS §§ 706-646(2)(2014) and 706-
605(7)(2014).  Kealoha , SDO at 2 (citing State v. Feleunga , No. 
30450, 3 (App. Nov. 15, 2011) (SDO) (finding no abuse of 
discretion by the circuit court when the plea agreement did not 
prohibit the imposition of restitution and restitution was 
required by HRS § 706- 646)).  The ICA determined that Kealoha 
and the State came to an agreement only as to terms of 
incarceration, based on the fact that Exhibit A to the change of 
plea forms did not mention any other possible penalties.  
Kealoha, SDO at 3.   Further, the ICA noted that neither Kealoha 
nor his attorney “ever objected to the imposition of restitution 
as outside the plea agreement” at the sentencing hearing, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
11 
 despite Kealoha’s protestations about his “ability to p ay a 
judgment of restitution, during which defense counsel stated 
that ‘we talked about that,’ indicating that it was not a 
surprise.” 
 Id.  For these reasons, the ICA concluded “the plea 
agreement did not expressly include restitution, but did not 
prohibit it and in fact noted the possibility of restitution 
being imposed.”  Id.   
Relying on its decision in Tuialii, the ICA also concluded 
that restitution is a collateral consequence of a no contest or 
guilty plea, and therefore Kealoha’s plea was not rendered 
involuntary by the circuit court’s failure to warn him about 
restitution.  Kealoha , SDO at 2 (citing Reponte v. State , 57 
Haw. 354, 363-64, 556 P.2d 577, 584 (1976); Tuialii, 121 Hawai ʻi 
at 139, 214 P.3d at 1129).   The ICA’s Judgments on Appeal were 
filed on July 26, 2017.    
 Kealoha’s court -appointed appellate attorney subsequently 
filed a request for appellat e attorney’s fees and costs seeking 
$59.84 in costs and $7,425.00 in attorney’s fees.  In its July 
17, 2017 order, the ICA majority summarily granted counsel 
attorney’s fees in the reduced amount of $5,000 and costs in the 
reduced amount of $54.90.8  Judge Ginoza dissented, stating that 
she would have granted the requested attorney’s fees.    
                     
8  Appellate counsel’s postage cost  request of $4.94 was “denied without 
prejudice for failure to provide copies of receipts.”    ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
12 
 C. Application for Certiorari 
 Kealoha seeks review of the ICA’s SDO upholding the circuit 
court’s order of restitution, as well as the July 17, 2017 ICA 
order with respect to the reduction of appellate counsel’s fees 
for work before the ICA.    
 On the issue of restitution, Kealoha again asserts the 
circuit court deviated from the plea agreement by imposing 
restitution, and that, therefore his plea was not knowingly, 
intelligently, and voluntarily made.  He argues “restitution is 
. . . a direct term of the sentence that is to be imposed upon a 
defendant pursuant to HRS § 706- 605,” and therefore Kealoha 
should have been informed, prior to the acceptance of his guilty 
plea, that restitution could be ordered.    
 As a remedy for the alleged improper inclusion of 
restitution in the sentence, he requests remand to the circuit 
court for resentencing or withdrawal of his guilty plea.  
Kealoha asks this court “to adopt a bright line rule that 
requires any restitution to be imposed at sentencing, be clearly 
included in either the change of plea form and/or the change of 
plea colloquy with a defendant.”    
 With respect to his request for attorney’s fees and costs 
before the ICA, appellate counsel asserts he was entitled to 
fees exceeding the statutory cap of $5000 for an appellate 
proceeding because he reviewed dockets and filed documents in ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
13 
 each of Kealoha’s three cases before they were consolidated on 
appeal, and because he filed a motion for temporary relief in 
the consolidated case, among other things.  He argues that three 
separate appeals “wou ld allow a statutory cap in each case of 
$5,000.00 for a total of $15,000.00,”9 and therefore “the 
requested $7,425.00 was reasonable.”    
III.  Standards of Review 
A. Questions of Law 
Questions  of law are reviewable de novo  under the 
right/wrong standard  of review.  State v. Jess , 117 Hawai ʻi 381, 
391, 184 P.3d 133, 143 (2008). 
B. Attorney’s Fees  
This court reviews a lower court’s award of attorneys’ fees 
for abuse of discretion.  Allstate Ins. Co. v. Pruett , 118 
Hawaiʻi 174, 179, 186 P.3d 609, 614 (2008)  (citation 
omitted).  “The trial court abuses its discretion if it 
bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a 
clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.” Id. (quoting 
Lepere v. United Pub. Workers , 77 Hawai ʻi 471, 473, 887 P.2d 
1029, 1031 (1995)).  I n other words, “[a]n abuse of 
discretion occurs where the trial court has clearly 
exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment 
of a party litigant.”  Id. (quoting TSA Int’ l Ltd. v. 
Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawaiʻ i 243, 253, 990 P.2d 713, 723 
(1999)). 
 
Hart v. Ticor Title Ins. Co. , 126 Hawai ʻi 448, 455, 272 P.3d 
1215, 1222 (2012) (brackets in original). 
                     
9  Under HRS § 802- 5(b) (2001), court- appointed counsel shall receive  
“reasonable compensation . . . based on the rate of $90 an hour[.]”  The 
maximum allowable fee for an appeal is $5,000.  HRS § 802 -5(b)(4).  However, 
“[p]ayment in excess of any maximum . . . may be made whenever the court in 
which the representation was rendered certifies that the amount of the excess 
payment is necessary to provide fair compensation and the payment is approved 
by the administrative judge of that court.”  HRS § 802- 5(b). ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
14 
  With respect to court- appointed counsel, this court has 
said that “[u]nder  HRS § 802 -5, requests for fees should be 
granted if the court certifies that the requesting attorney has 
met his or her burden to prove that the fees requested are for 
hours expended and that the hours expended were ‘reasonable’ for 
the services rendered. ”  In re Mohr , 97 Hawai ‘i 1, 5, 32 P.3d 
647, 651 (2001) .  When a fee request is reduced, the judge 
reducing the request is required to set forth reasons for the 
reduction, to enable appellate review of excess fee awards.  In 
re Bettencourt , 126 Hawai ʻi 26, 32, 265 P.3d 1122, 1128 (2011).  
IV. Discussion 
 The transcript of Kealoha’s change of plea hearing makes 
clear that the circuit court did not inform Kealoha that 
restitution could be imposed as part of his sentence.  The 
question before us is whether the circuit court had an 
obligation to advise him of such a fact before accepting his 
guilty plea.   
A. Trial courts must advise defendants of the possibility of 
restitution being a part of their sentences before 
accepting a change of plea. 
 
 For the reasons below, w e conclude that a court accepting a 
guilty or no contest plea is required by the HRPP and our 
constitution to advise the defendant that restitution is a 
possible consequence of conviction.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
15 
 1. As part of the “maximum penalty provided by law ,” 
restitution must be part of the advisement and 
colloquy held in open court. 
 Under HRPP Rule 11(c)(2)(2007),10 the sentencing court is 
required to advise defendants orally in open court of, and 
ensure they understand, “the maximum penalty provided by law . . 
. which may be imposed for the offense to which the plea is 
offered” before the court may accept a guilty or no contest 
plea.  In general, HRS § 706-605 (2016)11 lays out the 
“Authorized disposition of convicted defe ndants” under the 
Hawaii Penal Code.  In relevant part, HRS § 706 -605 provides as 
follows: 
(1)  Except as provided in . . . subsections (2) [Probation 
and Imprisonment], (6) [Compensation Fees], and (7) 
[Restitution] . . . the court may sentence a convicted 
defendant to one or more of the following dispositions:  
 (a)  To be placed on probation[;]  
 (b)  To pay a fine[;] 
 (c)  To be imprisoned[;] or  
 (d)  To perform services for the community[.]  
 
. . . . 
 
                     
10  At the time Kealoha pled guilty, the 2007 version of HRPP Rule 11 was 
in effect.  The language at issue here was not changed in the 2014 amendment 
of the rule.  HRPP Rule 11(c)(2007) provided, in relevant part:  
 
The court shall not accept a plea of guilty or nolo 
contendere without first addressing the defendant 
personally in open court and determining that the defendant 
understands the following:  
. . . .

maximum sentence of extended term of imprisonment, which 
may be imposed for the offense to which the plea is 
offered[.]

not altered in the 2016 amendment to this section.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 (7)  The court shall order the defendant to make 
restitution for losses as provided in section 706 -646.  In 
ordering restitution, the court shall not consider the 
defendant’s financial ability to make restitution in 
determining the amount of restitution to order.   The court, 
however, shall consider the defen dant’s financial ability 
to make restitution for the purpose of establishing the 
time and manner of payment.  
 
(Emphasis added.) 
 At the time of Kealoha’s change of plea, HRS § 706-646 
(2013) provided as follows: 
§706-646  Victim restitution.   (1)  As used in this 
section, “ victim” includes any of the following:  
(a)   The direct victim of a crime including a 
business entity, trust, or governmental entity;  
(b)   If the victim dies as a result of the crime, a 
surviving relative of the victim as defined in chapter 351; 
or 
(c)   A governmental entity that has reimbursed the 
victim for losses arising as a result of the crime or paid 
for medical care provided to the victim as a result of the 
crime. 
 
(2)  The court shall order the defendant to make 
restitution for reasonable and verified losses suffered by 
the victim or victims as a result of the defendant ’s 
offense when requested by the victim.   The court shall 
order restitution to be paid to the crime victim 
compensation commission in the event that the victim has 
been given an award for compensation under chapter 351.   If 
the court orders payment of a fine in addition to 
restitution or a compensation fee, or both, the payment of 
restitution and compensation fee shall have priority over 
the payment of  the fine, and payment of restitution shall 
have priority over payment of a compensation fee.  
 
(3)  In ordering restitution, the court shall not consider 
the defendant ’s financial ability to make restitution in 
determining the amount of restitution to order.  The court, 
however, shall consider the defendant ’s financial ability 
to make restitution for the purpose of establishing the 
time and manner of payment.   The court shall specify the 
time and manner in which restitution is to be 
paid.  Restitution shall  be a dollar amount that is 
sufficient to reimburse any victim fully for losses, 
including but not limited to:   
(a)   Full value of stolen or damaged property, as 
determined by replacement costs of like property, or the 
actual or estimated cost of repair, if repair is 
possible;        
(b)   Medical expenses; and  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
17 
 (c)   Funeral and burial expenses incurred as a 
result of the crime.  
 
(4) 
 The restitution ordered shall not affect the right of 
a victim to recover under section 351 -33 or in any manner 
provided by  law; provided that any amount of restitution 
actually recovered by the victim under this section shall 
be deducted from any award under section 351 -33.[12] 
 
Thus, pursuant to HRS §706- 646(2), if a “victim” as defined 
in subsection (1) requests restitution, or if the crime victim 
compensation fund has provided the victim with an award, 
                     
12  Changes to the 2013 version of HRS § 706 -646 from the current version 
(2014 & Supp. 2017) are reflected below, but these amendments do not affect 
our analysis in this case:  
 
§706-646  Victim restitution.  ( 1)  As used in this 
section, “ victim” includes any of the following:  
 . . . . 
(d) Any duly incorporated humane society or duly  
incorporated society for the prevention of cruelty to 
animals, contracted with the county or State to enforce 
animal-related statutes or ordinances, that impounds, 
holds, or receives custody of a pet animal pursuant to 
section 711 -1109.1, 711- 1109.2, or 711 -1110.5; provided 
that this section does not apply to costs that have already
been contracted and provided for by the counties or State .  
(2) . . . If the court orders payment of a fine in addition 
to restitution or a compensation fee, or both, the payment 
of restitution and compensation fee shall be made pursuant  
to section 706 -651 [have priority over the payment of the 
fine, and payment of restituti on shall have priority over 
payment of a compensation fee] . 
(3) . . .The court shall specify the time and manner in 
which restitution is to be paid.   While the defendant is in  
the custody of the department of public safety, restitution 
shall be collected pursuant to chapter 353 and any court -
ordered payment schedule shall be suspended . . . . 
(4) In any criminal proceeding before any court, all money 
deposited by the defendant as bail and not declared 
forfeited shall be applied toward payment of any 
restitution, fines, or fees ordered by the court in the 
same case, consistent with the priorities in subsection 
(2). 
(5) The restitution ordered shall not affect the right of a 
victim to recover under section 351 -33 or in any manner 
provided by law; provided that any amount of restitution 
actually recovered by the victim under this section shall 
be deducted from any award under section 351 -33.

 restitution for reasonable and verified losses must  be ordered.  
Therefore, whether or not it is ultimately ordered, restitution 
is part of the “maximum penalty provided by law” and under HRPP 
Rule 11(c)(2) sentencing courts must advise defendants that 
restitution will be part of their sentences if the conditions of 
HRS § 706-646 are met.13 
 The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (“FRCrP”) Rule 11 
is explicitly in accord.  Since 1985, FRCrP  Rule 11 has included 
restitution in the court’s mandatory plea advisements because 
“restitution is deemed an aspect of the defendant’s sentence,” 
according to the legislative history of the federal restitution 
statute.  Commentary to Fed. R. Crim. P. Rule 11(c)(1) (1985) 
(citing S. Rep. No. 97- 532, at 30-33 (1982) (Conf. Rep.)).  
Indeed, restitution is just one of several items of which 
federal courts are explicitly required to advise defendants 
under FRCrP Rule 11(b)(1) (2013):14  
                     
13  Other jurisdictions with rules similar to  our HRPP Rule 11 have come to 
the same conclusion.  See, e.g., Hayes v. State , 137 P.3d 475, 481 (Idaho Ct. 
App. 2006) (“[R]estitution is a direct consequence of entering a guilty plea, 
of which a defendant should be informed pursuant to Idaho Criminal Rule 11(c) 
before his guilty plea is accepted.”); Keller v. State, 723 P.2d 1244, 1246 –
47 (Wyo. 1986) (“ From the viewpoint of a defendant in a criminal trial, 
payment of restitution is as much a penalty as payment of a fine. Both 
require the payment of money. Both are direct  consequences of the plea. Both 
are punis hments authorized by law.  Restitution, therefore, is part of the 
“maximum possible penalty provided by law” for the purposes of Rule 15; and 
we hold that Rule 15(c)  requires the trial judge to inform a defendant of the 
court's power to order restitution.” ). 
 
14  The Standing Committee on the HRPP may consider whether to amend HRPP 
Rule 11 to set forth similarly detailed requirements . 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
19 
 (1) Advising and Questioning the Defendant. Before the 
court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the 
defendant may be placed under oath, and the court must 
address the defendant personally in open court. During 
this address, the court must inform the defendant of, 
and determine that the defendant understands, the 
following:  
(A) the government’ s right, in a prosecution for perjury or 
false statement, to use against the defendant any 
statement that the defendant gives under oath;  
(B) the right to plead not guilty, or having already so 
pleaded, to persist in that plea;  
(C) the right to a jury trial;  
(D) the right to be represented by counsel--and if 
necessary have the court appoint counsel--at trial and 
at every other stage of the proceeding; 
(E) the right at trial to confront and cross -examine 
adverse witnesses, to be protected from compelled self -
incrimination, to testify and present evidence, and to 
compel the attendance of witnesses;  
(F) the defendant ’s waiver of these trial rights if the 
court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere;  
(G) the nature of each charge to which the defendant is 
pleading;  
(H) any maximum possible penalty, including imprisonment, 
fine, and term of supervised release;  
(I) any mandatory minimum penalty;  
(J) any applicable forfeiture;  
(K) the court ’s authority to order restitution;  
(L) the court ’s obligation to impose a special assessment;  
(M) in determining a sentence, the court’ s obligation to 
calculate the applicable sentencing -guideline range and 
to consider that range, possible departures under the 
Sentencing Guidelines, and other sentencing factors 
under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a);  
(N) the terms of any plea -agreement provision waiving the 
right to appeal or to collaterally attack the sentence; 
and 
(O) that, if convicted, a defendant who is not a United 
States citizen may be removed from the United States, 
denied citizenship, and denied admission to the United 
States in the future.  
 
FRCrP Rule 11(b)(1)(A)-(O). 
 
Although restitution is not specifically mentioned in HRPP 
Rule 11(c), our rule requires the court to address “the 
defendant personally in open court” to determine “that the 
defendant understands the following” four items:  
(1) the nature of the charge to which the plea is offered; 
and ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
20 
  
(2) the maximum penalty  provided by law, and the maximum 
sentence of extended term of imprisonment, which may be 
imposed for the offense to which the plea is offered ; and 
 
(3) that the defendant has the right to plead not guilty, 
or to persist in that plea if it has already been made; and  
 
(4) that if the defendant pleads guilty or no contest there 
will not be a further trial of any kind, so that by 
pleading guilty or no contest the  right to a trial is 
waived. 
 
HRPP Rule 11(c)(1)- (4) (emphasis added).  Although we have held 
that there is no “ritualistic litany” to which sentencing courts 
must adhere in order to fulfil their duties under HRPP Rule 11, 
we have stated that we “cannot em phasize enough that all 
procedural components of HRPP Rule 11 should actually be 
complied with by . . . trial judges.”   State v. Cornelio , 68 
Haw. 644, 646, 727 P.2d 1125, 1127 (1986 ).  This includes the 
requirement that a trial court “address the defendan t personally 
in open court” to ensure the defendant understands the “maximum 
penalty provided by law,” which includes restitution.   
In this case, the circuit court never orally addressed 
Kealoha in open court to determine whether he understood that 
restitution could be imposed as part of his sentence.  Thus, 
there was no compliance with the requirement of HRPP Rule 
11(c)(2).   
The circuit court may have relied on the ICA’s previous 
ruling in Tuialii that no oral advisement regarding restitution 
is required; in that case, the ICA held that the sentencing ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
21 
 court was not required by HRPP Rule 11(c)(2)(2007) to advise the 
defendant that restitution could be imposed as part of his 
sentence,  121 Hawai ʻi at 138-39, 214 P.3d at 1128 -29, stating:   
The Circuit  Court orally advised Tuialii that the maximum 
sentence that could be imposed for Theft in the First 
Degree was ten years of imprisonment  and a fine of $20,000.  
Tuialii’s written no -contest- plea form, which he confirmed 
he had read carefully and discussed  with his attorney, 
states that he may be subject to restitution.  Indeed, in 
later arguing for reconsideration of his sentence, Tuialii 
argued that he was prepared to tender a check for $10,000 
for a restitution payment “and has been doing everything he 
can to get some money together.”   The Circuit Court was  not 
required by HRPP Rule 11(c)(2) to further advise Tuialii 
that restitution may be imposed as part of his sentence.  
The Circuit Court complied with HRPP Rule 11.  
 
121 Hawai‘ i at 139, 214 P.3d at 1129.   Likewise, in this case, 
the State argued Kealoha knew and understood that restitution 
could be imposed because paragraph six of Kealoha’s change of 
plea forms listed restitution as a possible penalty, and Kealoha 
indicated that he read and understood t he forms, and t he ICA 
referenced this argument in its SDO.  Kealoha, SDO at 3 n.6 .  
Paragraph six of Kealoha’s change of plea forms did indeed list 
restitution as a penalty that may be imposed upon entry of a 
guilty or no contest plea.      
Contrary to the ICA’s rulings, however, the boilerplate 
language in Kealoha’s change of plea forms , which included 
reference to sentencing options inapplicable to Kealoha, is 
insufficient to satisfy the court’s HRPP Rule 11(c) (2) 
obligation to personally advise the defendant in open court of 
the maximum penalty provided by law.  The forms did not provide ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
22 
 Kealoha the personal, oral colloquy required by HRPP Rule 
11(c)(2). 
 Therefore, we hold that trial courts must include the 
possibility of restitution in the oral colloquy required by HRPP 
Rule 11(c)(2).  We overrule Tuialii to the extent it held 
otherwise. 
2. Restitution is a direct consequence of 
conviction.   
A proper oral colloquy regarding any possible restitution 
sentence is also required to satisfy a trial court’s dut y to 
ensure that a defendant’s change of plea is knowingly, 
intelligently, and voluntarily made, with respect to the 
consequences of the plea: 
A trial judge is constitutionally required to ensure that a 
guilty plea is voluntarily and knowingly entered.  In  
determining the voluntariness of a defendant’s proffered 
guilty plea, the trial court should make an affirmative 
showing by an on -the-record colloquy between the court and 
the defendant wherein the defendant is shown to have a full 
understanding of what t he plea of guilty connotes and its 
consequences.  
 
State v. Krstoth , 138 Hawai ʻi 268, 273, 378 P.3d 984, 989 (2016) 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  “Manifest 
injustice occurs when a defendant makes a plea involuntarily or 
without knowledge of the direct consequences of the plea.”  
State v. Nguyen , 81 Hawai ʻi 279, 292, 916 P.2d 689, 702 (1996).  
We have also held, however, that “an accused need not be 
informed prior to the acceptance of his guilty plea about every ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
23 
 conceivable collateral effect the conviction might have.”15  
Reponte, 57 Haw. at 364, 556 P.2d at 584.   
The direct/collateral consequence framework is meant to 
provide guidance to trial courts with respect to what they must 
ensure defendants know in order to make constitutionally valid 
pleas.  In Nguyen, we looked to other jurisdictions’ law to 
distinguish direct consequences from collateral ones:  
A direct consequence is one which has a definite, immediate 
and largely automatic effect on defendant’s punishment. The 
failure to warn of . . . collateral consequences will not 
warrant vacating a plea because they are peculiar to the 
individual and generally result from the actions taken by 
agencies the court does not control.  
 
Nguyen, 81 Hawai‘ i at 288, 916 P.2d at 698 (citing People v. 
Ford, 657 N.E.2d 265, 267 –68 (N.Y. 1995) (citations omitted) 
(overruled on other grounds by People v. Peque , 3 N.E.3d 617, 
636-37 (N.Y. 2013)).   
In a footnote in Tuialii, citing  our decision in State v.  
Gaylord, 78 Hawai‘ i 127, 890 P.2d 1167 (1995), the ICA opined 
that treating restitution as a collateral consequence of a plea 
would be “consistent with Hawai ‘i case law, which views 
restitution as a ‘quasi -civil’ compensatory action, an ‘adjunct 
                     
15  Previous cases have held that collateral consequences of conviction 
include sex offender registration, Foo v. State , 106 Hawaiʻ i 102, 114, 102 
P.3d 346, 358 (2004), the possibility of deportation, Nguyen, 81 Hawai ʻi at 
287, 916 P.2d at 697, and prohibitions on the ownership of firearms and 
ammunition, Reponte, 57 Haw. at 364 -65, 556 P.2d at 584.   We note that courts 
are required by law to advise all defendants of the possibility of 
deportation at arraignment and change of plea.  HRS §§ 802E -2, 802E-4; HRPP 
Rules 10(e)(4), 11(d).   
  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
24 
 of punishment of the offender,’ in contrast to a fine, which 
advances punitive objectives.”  121 Hawai ‘i at 139, n.2, 214 P.3d 
at 1129, n.2 (citing Gaylord, 78 Hawai ‘i at 150-54, 890 P.2d at 
1190-94).  The SDO in Kealoha’s case cited Tuialii as holding 
that restitution was a collateral consequence of a guilty or no 
contest plea.  Kealoha , SDO at 3 (citing Tuialii, 121 Hawai ‘i at 
139, n.2, 214 P.3d at 1129 , n.2). 
While it  is true that this court has distinguished “quasi -
civil” restitution from criminal fines, Tuialii’s 
characterization of Gaylord is inaccurate.  In State v. Murray , 
63 Haw. 12, 621 P.2d 334 (1980), we recognized “a legislative 
contemplation that [HRS § 706- 605] should serve several 
objectives, including retribution, rehabilitation, and 
restitution.”  63 Haw. at 20, 621 P.2d at 339.  We determined, 
based on the legislative history of the 1975 amendment to HRS § 
705-605, that “reparation of a direct victim” was not the only 
purpose of restitution, and that instead the restitution 
amendment had “a purpose and design that encompasses the 
punishment and the rehabilitation of the offender.”  63 Haw. at 
18-19, 621 P.2d at 339.  “[R]estitution or reparation,” in our 
view, serves “as an optional penal sanction” in the correctional 
process.  63 Haw. at 15, 621 P.2d at 337.   
 In Gaylord, we criticized the way Murray “blurred the 
distinction between criminal fine s . . . and restitution” not ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
25 
 because we thought restitution was not punitive, but because we 
needed to make clear that payment of  restitution, as a stand-
alone rehabilitative sentence, was “an insufficient basis for 
the imposition of a prison term that is not appropriate on other 
independent grounds.”16  Gaylord, 78 Hawai ‘i at 152, 
154, 890 P.2d 
at 1192, 1194.  While we stated that restitution, because of its 
rehabilitative potential, was insufficient to justify imposing 
consecutive terms of imprisonment , Gaylord did not actually 
address whether restitution is a direct or a collateral 
consequence of conviction.  
 We also did not address this issue in State v. Feliciano , 
103 Hawaiʻ i 269, 81 P.3d 1184 (2003), in which we held that the 
sentencing court could not convert restitution originally 
imposed as a condition of probation into a free standing order 
to ensure the defendant paid restitution after his term of 
probation ended.  103 Hawai ʻi at 275, 81 P.3d at 1190.  In that 
case, less than ten years after Gaylord, we reiterated that 
“[r]estitution contains a rehabilitative component, as its 
                     
16  We looked to the legislative history of HRS § 706 -605, Murray , and 
relevant academic sources to conclude that restitution was rehabilitative in 
nature, at least as far as it was “calculated to develop in the offender ‘a 
degree of self- respect and pride in knowing that he or she has righted the 
wrong committed.’”  Gaylord, 78 Hawai‘ i at 152, 890 P.3d 1192 (citing Stand. 
Comm. Rep. No. 789, in 1975 Senate Journal, at 1132).   Our discussion of 
restitution in Gaylord  was based on a previous version of HRS § 706 -605 
(Supp. 1992), which allowed sentencing courts to order r estitution at their 
discretion and limited that order to “an amount the defendant can afford to 
pay.”  78 Hawaiʻ i at 150, 890 P.2d at 1190 (citing HRS § 706 -605(1)(d) (Supp. 
1992)). 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
26 
 purpose is not only to repay the person injured by the criminal 
act, but also to develop in the offender ‘a degree of self -
respect and pride’ for having ‘righted a wrong comm
itted.’”  103 
Hawaiʻi at 272, 81 P.3d at 1187 (citing Murray, 63 Haw. at 19 
n.11, 621 P.2d at 339 n.11).  We summarized Gaylord as 
recognizing “ that restitution is ‘quasi -civil’ in nature because 
it is designed to compensate the victim as an adjunct of  
punishment.”  Feliciano , 103 Hawai ʻi at 272, 81 P.3d at 1187  
(emphasis added) (citing Gaylord, 78 Hawai ‘i at 152, 890 P.2d at 
1193).  In acknowledging that restitution has “a rehabilitative 
component” and provides compensation “as an adjunct of 
punishment,” we reaffirmed that restitution is not solely 
rehabilitative.  See Feliciano , 103 Hawai ʻi at 272, 81 P.3d at 
1187.  But again, we did not determine whether restitution was a 
direct or a collateral consequence of conviction.  
 Based on our analysis in Section IV(A)(1) above and for the 
reasons explained below, we now hold that restitution is a 
direct consequence of conviction.  
 
In the most literal and plain meaning of the word “direct,” 
restitution is a direct consequence of a guilty or no contest 
plea, or of a finding of guilt.  See Black’s Law Dictionary  
(10th ed. 2014) (defining “direct” as “1. (of a thing) straight; 
undeviating . . . 2. (of a thing or a person) straightforward . 
. . 3. Free from extraneous influence; immediate[.]” ).  As ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
27 
 discussed above, restitution is an authorized disposition of 
convicted defendants under HRS § 706-605 — like imprisonment, 
fees, and fines — and may be imposed only upon conviction.  
Whether imposed by free standing order, or as a condition of 
probation, restitution is part o f the defendant’s sentence and 
judgment of conviction.  Restitution therefore “has a definite, 
immediate and largely automatic effect on the defendant’s 
punishment” because it is imposed by the court alongside the 
defendant’s other punishments.17   
Even when a sentencing court has bound itself pursuant to 
HRPP Rule 11(f)(1)18 to a plea agreement that specifies the 
penalties to be imposed without including restitution, the 
                     
17  Other jurisdictions have also reached this conclusion.  See, e.g., 
Harris v. Superior Court , 222 Cal.Rptr.3d 192, 197 (2017) (“A consequence is 
direct . . . if it has a definite, immediate and largely automatic effect on 
the range of the defendant’s punishment . . . Victim restitution is a direct 
consequence of the plea.”) ( citations and internal quotations omitted); 
Holland v. United States , 584 A.2d 13, 15 (D.C. 1990) (“[W] e have no 
difficulty concluding that restitution is a direct consequence about which a 
defendant should be warned. ”); State v. Cameron , 633 P.2d 901, 905  (1981) 
(“We conclude that restitution is a direct consequence of entering a guilty 
plea and the sentencing court may not impose restitution upon a defendant who 
pleads guilty, unless defendant is advised of that possibility prior to 
entering his plea.”).  
 
18  HRPP Rule 11(f)(1) provides:  
 
The prosecutor and counsel for the defendant, or the 
defendant when acting pro se, may enter into plea 
agreements that, upon the entering of a plea of guilty or 
no contest to a charged offense or to an included or 
related offense, the prosecutor will take certain actions 
or adopt certain positions, including the dismissal of 
other charges and the recommending or not opposing of 
specific sentences or dispositions on the charge to which a 
plea was entered. The court may participate in discussions 
leading to such plea agreements and may agree to be bound 
thereby. 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
28 
 sentencing court must advise a defendant of the possibility of a 
restitution sentence when restitution could possibly be ordered, 
as part of its obligation to advise the defendant of all 
possible maximum penalties.  Thus, as part of their 
“constitutionally required” duty “to ensure that a guilty [or no 
contest] plea is voluntarily and knowi ngly entered,” Krstoth, 
138 Hawaiʻ i at 273, 378 P.3d at 989 (internal quotation marks and 
citations omitted) , trial courts must advise defendants that 
restitution may be ordered as part of their sentences.    
 In this regard, we note that under HRS § 706- 647(1) (2000), 
restitution orders may be enforced as though they were civil 
judgments.  Free standing orders of restitution are therefore 
enforceable for ten years and can potentially be extended to 
twenty years from the date of the judgment.  See HRS § 657- 5 
(2001) (permitting “any judgment or decree” to extend no longer 
than “twenty years from the date of the original judgment or 
decree.”).  Furthermore, the imposition of restitution can delay 
the defendant’s satisfaction of other monetary punishments:  
restitution must be paid before all other monetary sanctions, 
including fines.  See HRS § 706-651 (2016) (defining the order 
of priority for payments made by a defendant).   
 In addition, since 2006, restitution has been a mandatory  
disposition of convicted defendants whenever it is requested by 
a victim and shown to be reasonable and verifiable, according to ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
29 
 HRS § 706-605(7) as well as HRS § 706-646(2) (2016).19  The 2006 
amendment also forbade sentencing courts from “consider[ing] t he 
defendant’s financial ability to make restitution in determining 
the amount of restitution to order.”  HRS § 706 -605(7) (2006); 
HRS § 706-646(2), (3) (2006).  As a result, restitution  must now 
be imposed when the statutory conditions are met, even if th e 
defendant cannot pay and cannot develop “a degree of self -
respect and pride in knowing that he or she has righted the 
wrong committed.”  See Gaylord, 78 Hawai ‘i at 152, 890 P.3d 1192 
(citing Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 789, in 1975 Senate Journal, at 
1132).  In contrast, a defendant cannot be ordered to pay a fine 
unless “[t]he defendant is or will be able to pay the fine[.]”  
HRS § 706-641(3)(a) (1986).  Thus, a  restitution order, despite 
its rehabilitative and compensatory functions , can have 
significant and direct  impacts on a defendant’s punishment.20     
                     
19  The language relevant to this appeal became effective in 2006, and was 
not altered in the 2012, 2013, or 2016 amendments to this section; HRS § 706 -
646(2) provides, in relevant part:  
 
(2)  The court shall order the defendant to make 
restitution for reasonable and verified losses suffered by 
the victim or victims as a result of the defendant’s 
offense when requested by the victim.  . . . 
 
20  Gaylord is still good law; payment of restitution as a stand alone 
rehabilitative sentence is still “ an insufficient basis for the imposition of 
a prison term that is not appropriate on other independent grounds.” 78 
Hawai‘i at 154, 890 P.2d at 1194.  However, we emphasize that —- as our case 
law has always acknowledged —- restitution is a sentence with rehabilitative 
and compensatory potential , but it is still a supplement to the defendant’s 
punishment.  See  Gaylord, 78 Hawai‘ i at 153, 890 P.2d at 1193  (“Restitution . 
. . is ‘compensation for the victim’ as an adjunct of ‘punishment of the 
(continued. . .)  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
30 
  Therefore, with respect to restitution, the court must, at 
a minimum, ensure the defendant understands the following before 
accepting a change of plea: (1) the court must order restitution  
for reasonable and verifiable losses  requested by a “victim” or 
when the crime victim compensation fund makes an award ; (2) the 
court cannot waive the restitution amount  or convert it to 
community service;21 and (3) unless the amount of restitution has 
already been determined, the court cannot determine  what a 
possible restitution  amount will be until  a later time.   
Based on the reasoning above, we also overrule Tuialii’s 
holding that restitution is a collateral consequence of 
conviction.22   
                                                                  
(continued. . .) 
offender[.]’”) (emphasis in original) (citing Murray, 63 Haw. at 15, 621 P.2d 
at 337).   
 
21  HRS § 706- 644(4) (2000) provides: 
 
If it appears that the defendant’s default in the payment 
of a fee, fine, or restitution is not contumacious, the 
court may make an order allowing the defendant additional 
time for payment, reducing the amount of each installment, 
or revoking the fee, fine, or the unpaid portion thereof in 
whole or in part, or converting the unpaid portion of the 
fee or fine to community service.   A defendant shall not be 
discharged from an order to pay restitution until the full
amount of the restitution has actually been collected or 
accounted for.   
 
(Emphasi s added.) 
 
22  The remaining holding in Tuialii —- that restitution may be ordered for 
a victim who has already been reimbursed by an insurer —- is not before us.  
See Tuialii, 121 Hawai ‘i at 140 -42, 214 P.3d at 1130 -32 (concluding that 
ordering a defendant to pay the full amount of losses to the victim, without 
any reduction for amounts already paid by an insurer, is permitted by HRS § 
706-646). ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 B. Kealoha’s Remedies  
 
 We have held that “[m] anifest injustice occurs when a 
defendant makes a plea involuntarily or without knowledge of the 
direct consequences of the plea. ”  Nguyen, 81 Hawai ‘i at 292, 916 
P.2d at 702   It is well settled that the terms of a plea 
agreement serve as inducement for the entering of a plea, and 
must be fulfilled.  State v. Adams, 76 Hawai ‘i 408, 414, 879 P.2d 
513, 519 (1994) (citing State v. Costa , 64 Haw. 564, 566, 644 
P.2d 1329, 1331 (1982); Santobello v. New York , 404 U.S. 257, 
262 (1971)).  “Indeed, due process requires that the State 
uphold its end of the bargain” and manifest injustice occurs 
when the State violates a plea agreement, entitling the 
defendant to withdraw his or her plea.  Adams, 76 Hawai ‘i at 414, 
879 P.2d at 519 ( citing State v. Yoon , 66 Haw. 342, 347, 662 
P.2d 1112, 1115 (1983); United States v. Crusco , 536 F.2d 21, 
26-27 (3d Cir. 1976)) .  Likewise, when a court binds itself to a 
plea agreement pursuant to HRPP Rule 11(f)(1), due process 
requires the court to “uphold its end of the bargain” by 
sentencing the defendant in accordance with the agreement’s 
terms.  When the sentencing court violates a plea agreement to 
which it is bound, the defendant is denied due process and 
manifest justice occurs as a matter of law.  When a plea 
agreement is breached, “either resentencing or withdrawal of a 
plea may be the appropriate remedy depending on the defendant’ s ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
32 
 particular circumstances. ”  Adams, 76 Hawai ‘i at 414, 879 P.2d at 
519. 
 Based on these legal principles, Kealoha asks this court to 
order a correction of his sentence to afford him specific 
performance of his plea agreement without restitution, or in the 
alternative, to allow withdrawal of his plea.  Based on the 
reasons below, however, Kealoha is not entitled to the specific 
relief he seeks, but must instead seek such relief under HRPP 
Rule 40.23   
                     
23    HRPP Rule 40 (2006) provides in relevant part:  
 
 (a) Proceedings and grounds.  The post -conviction proceeding 
established by this rule shall encompass all common law and 
statutory procedures for the same purpose, including habeas corpus 
and coram nobis; provided that the foregoing shall not be 
construed to limit the availability of remedies in the trial court 
or on direct appeal. Said proceeding shall be applicable to 
judgments of conviction and to custody based on judgments of 
conviction, as follows:  
(1) FROM JUDGMENT . At any time but not prior to final 
judgment, any person may seek relief under the procedure 
set forth in this rule from the judgment of conviction, on 
the following grounds:  
(i)  that the judgment was obtained or sentence 
imposed in violation of the constitution of the 
United States or of the State of Hawai ʻi; 
(ii) that the court which rendered the judgment was 
without jurisdiction over the person or the subject 
matter; 
         (iii) that the sentence is illegal;  
         (iv) that there is newly discovered evidence; or  
(v) any ground which is a basis for collateral attack 
on the judgment.  
For the purposes of this rule, a judgment is final when the 
time for direct appeal under Rule 4(b) of the Hawai ʻi Rules of 
Appellate Procedure has expired without appeal being taken, or if 
direct appeal was taken, when the appellate process has 
terminated, provided that a petition under this rule seeking 
relief from judgment may be filed during the pendency of direct 
appeal if leave is granted by order of the appellate court.  . . . 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
33 
  With respect to Kealoha’s request that this court order 
resentencing pursuant to the Rule 11 plea agreement without any 
restitution, as noted above, the circuit court was required  by 
law to order restitution in a reasonable and verifiable amount 
once it was requested by the victims.  See HRS § 706 -646(2) 
(“The court shall order the defendant to make restitution for 
reasonable and verified losses suffered by the victim or victims 
. . . when requested by the victim .”) (emphasis added).  
Although the plea agreement did not contain restitution as part 
of the sentence, resentencing for specific performance of the 
plea agreement is not an available remedy.24   
                     
24  The State asserted at oral argument that there was no plea agreement  
because the “Rule 11 agreement as to sentencing” was not written and  had not 
been approved by the prosecutor’s office .”  This argument was never raised 
before the ICA and is unsupported by the record, which clearly reflects the 
prosecutor’s oral assent  to the plea agreement.  Further, the circuit court 
bound itself to the plea agreement:  
 
THE COURT:   What is the plea agreement?  
[DEFENSE COUNSEL] :  Everything concurrent.  
THE COURT:   And he gets the open term and everything 
concurrent ? 
[DEFENSE COUNSEL] :  Yeah. 
THE COURT:  I will bind myself to this agreement . 
 
 The State also argued that the circuit court’s failure to advise 
Kealoha about restitution was harmless error, analogizing this case to 
federal cases and FRCrP Rule 11 .  The State’s  harmless error argument was not 
raised below, and regardless is without merit because we conclude that 
restitution is a direct consequence of a guilty plea.  In any event, we note 
this court has never embraced the federal courts’ harmless error approach to 
change of plea advisements, and has actually consistently ruled that 
sentencing courts must strictly adhere to HRPP Rule 11’s dictates.  See 
Cornelio , 68 Haw. at 646, 727 P.2d at  1127 (“This court has stressed that it 
is incumbent on all trial judges to strictly conform to the guidelines 
provided in HRPP Rule 11. ” (citing State v. Vaitogi , 59 Haw. 592, 594-95, 585 
P.2d 1259, 1261 (1978)) .   
 Furthermore, the federal courts’ harmless error doctrine has typically 
only applied when the defendant is advised of a potential fine at their 
(continued. . .)  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
34 
 Kealoha alternatively requests that he be permitted to 
withdraw his guilty plea.  In this regard, HRPP Rule 32(d) 
permits a motion to withdraw plea to be filed no later than ten 
days after imposition of sentence,25 but Kealoha did not file a 
motion with the circuit court to withdraw his plea.  He asked to 
withdraw his plea for the first time on appeal.  Therefore, to 
request a withdrawal of his plea, Kealoha must now proceed by  
way of an HRPP Rule 40 petition to seek relief from judgment.  
See HRPP Rule 32(d) (“At any later time, a defendant seeking to 
withdraw a plea of guilty . . . may do so only by petition 
pursuant to Rule 40 of these rules[.]”).    
We also note HRS § 706 -645(1)(1992) provides that a 
defendant sentenced to pay restitution who is “n ot in 
contumacious default in the payment thereof may at any time 
                                                                  
(continued. . .) 
change of plea, but is ultimately sentenced to a restitution amount that is 
less than the advised- upon fine.  See, e.g., United States v. Crawford , 169 
F.3d 590, 591- 93 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding that failure to advise on 
restitution was harmless error where the defendant was advised that he could 
be ordered to pay a fine of up to $250,000, but was ultimately ordered to 
restitution in the amount of $2,511.86 with no fine).  Even if we chose to 
embrace this harmless error analysis, it would be inapplicable to Kealoha 
because the circuit court did not advise him of any potential fines at his 
change of plea.    
   
25  HRPP Rule 32(d) provides, in relevant part:  
 
A motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere 
may be made before sentence is imposed or imposition of 
sentence is suspended; provided that, to correct manifest 
injustice the court, upon a party’s motion  submitted no 
later than ten (10) days after imposition of sentence, 
shall set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the 
defendant to withdraw the plea. . . . 
 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
35 
 petition the court which sentenced the defendant for a 
revocation of . . . restitution or of any unpaid portion 
thereof.”  (Emphasis added .)  The sentencing court may revoke 
restitution in whole or in part if “the circumstances which 
warranted the imposition of the . . . restitution have changed,” 
or if “it would otherwise  be unjust to require payment.”  HRS § 
706-645(2).  Thus, Kealoha could also seek  relief under HRS § 
706-645 in a  Rule 40 petition .   
 For these reasons, Kealoha’s requested relief  is denied 
without prejudice to him  seeking appropriate relief in the 
circuit court . 
C. Appellate attorney’s f ees for work before the ICA 
Finally, Kealoha’s court -appointed appellate counsel seeks 
review of the ICA’s July 17, 2017 order.  For his work before 
the ICA, counsel requested $7,425 in appellate attorney’s fees.  
The ICA’s J uly 17, 2017 order states:  
 Upon consideration of the Request for Appellate 
Attorney’s Fees and Costs by . . . court -appointed counsel 
for Defendant -Appellant Kristopher Kealoha, and the 
attachments thereto submitted on May 22, 2017, pursuant to 
HRS § 802- 5 and HRAP Rule 39, attorney’s fees in the 
reduced amount of $5,000.00 and costs in the reduced amount 
of $54.90[] are reasonable.  
 
 HRS §  802-5 (2015) provides, in relevant part, as follows: 
§802-5  Appointment of counsel; compensation.   (a) . . . 
[T]he judge shall appoint counsel to represent the person 
at all stages of the proceedings, including appeal, if any.  
 
. . . .  
 
(b)  The court shall determine the amount of reasonable 
compensation to appointed counsel, based on the rate of $90 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
36 
 an hour; provided that the maximum allowable fee shall not 
exceed the following schedule:  
 
       . . . . 
 
       (4)  Appeals               5,000 
 
       . . . . 
 
Payment in excess of any maximum provided for under 
paragraphs (1) to (6) may be made whenever the court in 
which the representation was rendered certifies that the 
amount of the excess payment is necessary to provide fair 
compensation and the payment is approved by the 
administrative judge of that court.  
 
Therefore, under HRS § 802- 5(b)(4)(2014), the maximum 
allowable fee for a criminal “proceeding, including appeal,” is 
$5,000, unless “the court in which the representation was 
rendered certifies that the amount of the excess payment is 
necessary to provide fair compensation and the payment is 
approved by the administrative judge of that court.”  HRS § 802 -
5(b)(2015).  Counsel argues he should have been granted fees in 
excess of $5,000 because, although Kealoha’s three criminal 
cases were consolidated for appellate purposes, he reviewed 
dockets, drafted 
notices of appeals and jurisdictional 
statements, and ordered transcripts for each of the three cases.  
He also argues he sought temporary relief from restitution after 
the cases were consolidated .26    
                     
26  Counsel also asserts that he performed additional work, for which he 
did not bill, to respond to an order to show cause before the ICA.  However, 
we have previously said “[i]t would be patently unreasonable to compensate a 
court-appointed attorney for work not documented[.]”  Mohr, 97 Hawai ʻi at 6, 
32 P.3d at 652. 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
37 
 We review a court’s award of attorney’s fees for abuse  of 
discretion.  Hart, 126 Hawai ʻi at 455, 272 P.3d at 1222.  In this 
regard, although appellate review of fee awards requires the 
judge reducing the request to set forth reasons for the 
reduction, “[t]he nature of appellate work is subject to ready 
evaluation by this court, which reviews similar attorney’s fees 
requests for work performed before it,” and therefore remand is 
not required for this court to review the ICA’s reduction of an 
appellate fee request.  Bettencourt , 126 Hawai ʻi at 31, 265 P.3d 
at 1127. 
 Upon review of appellate counsel’s time sheets and the 
record below, we conclude the ICA abused its discretion in 
summarily reducing appellate counsel’s attorney’s fees to 
$5,000.  Counsel’s time sheets show that fees above $5,000, 
although not all the fees he requested, were necessary to 
provide him fair compensation.27  We conclude that in order to 
provide fair compensation, counsel is entitled to reasonable 
appellate attorney’s fees in the amount of $6,025.50 , for 66.95 
hours of work before the ICA.28   
                     
27  Some of appellate counsel’s fee requests were duplicative or excessive, 
particularly with respect to phone calls made and documents filed before 
Kealoha’s three appeals were consolidated.  
 
28  We need not and do not address counsel’s assertion that there were 
three “proceedings,” each subject to the statutory fees cap.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
38 
  We therefore award appellate attorney’s fees in the amount 
of $6,025.50 for appellate counsel’s work before the ICA.   
V. Conclusion 
 Based on the foregoing, the circuit court’s judgments of 
conviction and the ICA’s judgment on appeal affirming the 
convictions are affirmed, but based on the reasoning in this 
opinion.  Kealoha’s requested relief is denied without prejudice 
to any petition he may file in the circuit court.   Finally, the 
ICA’s July 17, 2017 order is vacated in part as to the 
attorney’s fees award only, and appellate counsel is awarded 
$6,025.50 in appellate attorney’s fees for his work before the 
ICA; the costs award of $54.90 is affirmed.
