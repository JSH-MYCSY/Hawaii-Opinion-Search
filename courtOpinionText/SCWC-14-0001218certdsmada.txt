'I 
RICHARD BLAISDELL, Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellant, 
v.
 
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, Respondent/Defendant-Appellee.
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(CAAP-14-0001218; CIV. NO. 11-1-2008-09)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner/Petitioner-Appellant 
Richard Blaisdell’s Application for Writ of Certiorari filed on 
June 8, 2015, and the record, it appears that Blaisdell seeks certiorari review of an order denying his motion for reconsideration, which is not allowed under Hawai' i Revised 
Statutes (“HRS”) § 602-59. See HRS § 602-59(a) (“After issuance 
of the intermediate appellate court’s judgment or dismissal order, a party may seek review of the intermediate appellate court’s decision and judgment or dismissal order only by application to the supreme court for a writ of certiorari 
. . . .”) (emphasis added). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for writ of
 
certiorari is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, July 23, 2015.
