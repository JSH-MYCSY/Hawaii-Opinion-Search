AND DISSENTING, WITH WHOM RECKTENWALD, C.J., JOINS  
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J.
  
It has been settled for decades that the right to 
remain silent is a fundamental component of the right against 
compelled self-incrimination guaranteed by article I, section 10 
of the Hawai i Constitution.  What has been subject to 
disagreement among several jurisdictions is the point in time at  
 
 
  
 
  On February 7, 2014,  Lester Tsujimura was charged by 
complaint with Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an 
Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes  
2  (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(4)  (2007 & Supp. 2012).  
                                                        
 1  The secondary issues that we also explore are the statutory 
meaning of “alcohol” within HRS § 291E-1 and the sufficiency of the complaint 
in light of that statutory meaning.  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
which the right to remain silent attaches. In 2008, this court, 
in State v. Mainaaupo , 117 Hawai i 235, 178 P.3d 1  (2008), held  
that the right to remain silent attaches at least as of the time 
that a person is arrested.  In this case, the primary question 
that we resolve is the one that the Mainaaupo  court left open: 
whether the right to remain silent attaches prearrest and, if so, in what manner and to what extent may prearrest silence be 
1 utilized by the State in a criminal trial.  
I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 
A. Pretrial 
2 The complaint charged as follows:  
On or about the 15th day of January 2014, in the City and 
County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, LESTER S. TSUJIMURA 
did intentionally, knowingly or recklessly operate or 
assume actual physical control of a vehicle upon a public 
way, street, road, or highway while under the influence of 
alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair his normal mental faculties or ability to care for himself and guard against 
casualty; and/or did operate or assume actual physical 
control of a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or 
highway with .08 or more grams of alcoho
l per one hundred 
milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood, thereby 
committing the offense of Operating a Vehicle Under the 
Influence of an Intoxicant, in violation of 291E -61(a)(1) 
and/or (a)(4) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes .

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Tsujimura moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state an 
offense, arguing that the complaint was insufficient for failing 
to define the term “alcohol” and thus did not sufficiently 
apprise him of what he must be prepared to meet at trial.3 
At the hearing on the motion,4 Tsujimura argued that 
the statutory definition of alcohol includes only alcohol that was produced through distillation, and, as such, the definition 
must be included in the complaint. The State maintained that 
the motion to dismiss should be dismissed as untimely.  On the 
merits, the State contended that the definition of “alcohol” 
also includes ethyl alcohol regardless of origin and that a person of common understanding would understand what “alcohol” 
means within the OVUII statutory scheme. In reply to the 
State’s timeliness argument, Tsujimura argued that the motion to 
dismiss for failure to state an offense is jurisdictional and 
may be raised at any time. 
The District Court of the First Circuit (district 
court) dismissed the motion to dismiss as untimely.  Alternatively, the court determined that the statutory 
3 Tsujimura also filed a motion to suppress the results of any 
device that measured his blood alcohol content, evidence gathered post -arrest 
before he was given Miranda warnings, and all statements he made in violation 
of his constitutional rights. At the hearing, the State indicated that it 
was proceeding only on the HRS § 291E -61(a)(1) charge, in response to which 
Tsujimura withdrew his motion to suppress. 
4 The motion and trial proceedings in this case were presided over 
by the Honorable Paul B.K. Wong.

  Officer Billins turned on his  light and sirens to 
notify Tsujimura that he was being stopped, but Tsujimura was 
not responding, so Officer Billins used the loudspeaker system  
in his police car to request Tsujimura to pull over. After 
Tsujimura stopped, Officer Billins approached to inform him of 
the reason he was stopped and requested his driver’s license, 
registration, and insurance information. Tsujimura immediately ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
definition of alcohol is not restricted to alcohol derived from 
distillation and that a person of common understanding would 
understand what alcohol means even if the complaint does not set 
forth its statutory meaning. The district court reasoned that 
even though the plain language of the statutory definition of 
alcohol appears to include only alcohol produced by 
distillation, the court would “ignore the plain reading . . . to 
avoid an absur d result” in which only persons impaired by hard 
liquor could be prosecuted for OVUII.  
B. Trial 
At trial, Officer Thomas Billins of the Honolulu 
Police Department testified that, on January 15, 2014, at 
approximately 12:05 a.m., he saw Tsujimura driving a white SUV 
on the Moanalua Freeway just past the Ala Kapuna overpass. 
According to Officer Billins, Tsujimura entered the shoulder 
lane several times, “at times straddling the . . . right -most 
lane and the right shoulder.” 
4
  
 
 
   Officer Billins testified that Tsujimura had a very 
flush red face, his speech was slurred, and he had red  and  
watery eyes. Officer Billins added that he smelled an odor of 
alcoholic beverage emitting from Tsujimura’ s breath or from 
inside the vehicle cabin. The officer related that he requested 
that Tsujimura participate in standardized field sobriety tests 
(FSTs), to which Tsujimura agreed.  When asked whether he 
noticed Tsujimura having had any difficulty exiting his vehicle, Officer Billins stated that he did not “see him limping or 
anything like that,” that he got out of his vehicle normally, 
and that he did not “fall down or anything .”   Before performing 
the FSTs, Tsujimura told Officer Billins that he had an old 
injury to  his left knee, “[s]omething about his ACL and it was a 
bad knee,” and that he was taking medication for his high blood 
5 pressure and diabetes.  
  Officer Billins testified that, while he was 
conducting the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, he observed that Tsujimura’s face was flushed and red and that he had a slight 
                                                        ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
produced his driver’s license, but he had difficulty producing 
his registration and insurance information and had to fumble 
through a stack of documents.  
5   Prior to administering the FSTs, Officer Billins asked Tsujimura 
six questions: “If [he is] diabetic or epileptic, if [he is] under the care 
of a doctor or physician, if [he has] an artificial or glass eye, or if [he  
has] any speech impediments.”  
5
  
 
 
                                                         
  
 
 
  
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
sway from left to right. Over the objection of the defense, 
Officer Billins testified as to Tsujimura’s performance on the 
6 walk-and-turn test.   Officer Billins stated that Tsujimura broke 
his heel-to-toe stance twice, stepped off the line five times, 
failed to walk in a heel-to-toe fashion on all steps, failed to 
keep his hands six inches or less from his side, stumbled while 
turning, and had to raise his arm above shoulder level for 
balance, all of which did not comply with Officer Billins’ 
instructions and demonstration of the walk-and-turn test.  When 
asked about Tsujimura’s performance of the one -leg stand, 
Officer Billins stated that Tsujimura was unable to keep his foot six inches above the ground, put his foot down on several 
occasions, did not raise his foot off the ground in the first 
ten seconds of the test, was unable to count after several 
prompts to begin counting, was unable to maintain his hands down 
7 at his side, and did not follow instructions.  
6 The objection was based on the fact that even though the district 
court initially determined that there was insufficient foundation to allow 
Officer Billins to testify regarding the result of the FSTs, the State 
essentially “back -doored” testimony as to whether Tsujimura passed or failed 
the walk- and-turn test because Officer Billins was asked about the clues he 
was looking for and the instructions he gave based on his training. 
Tsujimura interjected a similar objection to Officer Billins’ testimony as to the results of the one -leg stand.  In light of our disposition in this case, 
we do not address these foundation challenges that were raised on appeal and certiorari. 
7 Officer Billins testified that when he had been around persons 
who had consumed alcohol, he had observ ed that they tend to have “bloodshot 
eyes or they have difficulty walking or standing still in an upright manner,” 
they “sometimes pass out,” “have emotional issues,” “go from being happy to 
sad,” stumble around, or have “difficulty grabbing things or even walking.”  
(continued . . .) 
6
  
 
 
   Officer Billins also testified that, having been 
apprised of Tsujimura’s  injury to his left knee, he suggested, 
during the one-leg stand,  that “if [Tsujimura] were to choose a 
leg, it may be wise to lift his injured  leg because he would 
have to put weight on the leg that  he’s standing on.” Officer 
Billins added that Tsujimura raised his left  leg during the one-
leg stand. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
                                                                                                                                                                                   
  
     ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
On cross-examination, Officer Billins stated that he 
followed Tsujimura ’s vehicle for about two miles before 
Tsujimura finally pulled over. 
The officer testified that 
Tsujimura was not changing lanes, was not going over the speed 
limit, was not slowing down or speeding up, did not follow 
vehicles too closely, and did not make any inconsistent signals.  
Officer Billins related that it took Tsujimura only eight 
seconds to pull over from the time he turned on his sirens and 
lights. Officer Billins noted that out of the 24 National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) visual detection clues, Tsujimura exhibited only one--trouble maintaining lane 
position.
8 Officer Billins testified that Tsujimura did not 
(continued . . . )  
On cross- examination, Officer Billins indicated that he did not see Tsujimura 
lose consciousness, exhibit emotional issues, go from being happy to being 
sad, laugh or cry inappropriately, stumble, grab something to keep himself 
upright, or walk into anything. 
8 Officer Billins testified on redirect examination that the 
factors listed in the NHTSA manual are not dispositive of intoxication and

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
repeat questions or comments, lean on the vehicle, or provide 
incorrect information or change his answers. Officer Billins 
indicated that red, watery eyes could be caused by a number of 
factors other than alcohol impairment, such as fatigue and long 
days at work. Officer Billins also expressed that, based on his 
training and experience and the NHTSA, odor of alcohol is a poor 
indicator of a person’s level of impairment and has no bearing 
on the amount and nature of the alcohol that the person 
consumed. 
Tsujimura’s counsel asked Officer Billins about his 
testimony on direct examination regarding Tsujimura’s injury. 
According to Officer Billins, Tsujimura stated that he had an 
injury on the left leg or left knee and a torn ACL on an 
unspecified leg. Officer Billins said that, when he recommended 
that Tsujimura raise his left leg for the one-leg stand, he was 
not aware “whether raising a leg puts more physical strain on 
your ACL than keeping it planted ” and “whether [Tsujimura’s] 
knee injury or ACL injury affected his ability to perform the ” 
one-leg stand and walk-and-turn. 
On redirect examination, the prosecutor asked Officer 
Billins whether Tsujimura, while exiting his car, explained that 
he could not get out of the car due to an ACL injury. The 
that it is necessary to evaluate their totality and the circumstances under 
which they arose instead of relying on one single clue.

 
8
  
 
 
  
 
 
  Tsujimura’s object ion to the prosecutor’s line of 
questioning was thus based on the  ground that   the question  
sought and elicited a response that commented  on Tsujimura’s ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
relevant exchange between the prosecutor and Officer Billins was 
as follows: 
[Prosecutor:] . . . You testified that when the defendant 
left the car he didn’t have any difficulty exiting the car.  
[Officer Billins:] Yes. 
[Prosecutor:] So did the defendant at that time explain to 
you he couldn’t get out of the car because of an ACL 
injury?  
[Defense Counsel:] Objection, Your Honor.  It comments on 
the  defendant’s right to remain silent.  
[The Court:] It’s overruled. Let’s see if the statement 
comes out.
  
[Prosecutor:]
 Do you recall if the defendant indicated to 
you he would have difficulty exiting the car because of his 
previous leg injury?
  
[Officer Bil
lins:] No statements were made.
  
[Defense Counsel:] And Your Honor, that’s exactly what I’m talking about. The Supreme Court 
-- there’s Supreme Court 
case law that says that the prosecutor cannot comment or elicit testimony that comments on the defendant’s  right to 
remain silent. He’s under no obligation to speak or say 
anything to Officer Billins.  
[The Court:] That’s true here in court.  
[Defense Counsel:] Correct.  
[The Court:] There’s no motion to suppress his statements 
at the scene of the stop.  
[Defense  Counsel:] No.  I understand that.  But during the 
course of the trial, [the prosecutor 
’s] trying to imply 
that he had some obligation to tell Officer Billins something . . .  
[The Court:] I understand what you’re saying.  Your 
objection’s overruled.  
(Emphases added.) 
9
  
 
 
right to remain silent. The district court overruled the 
objection on the grounds  that the prosecutor’s question was not 
implying that Tsujimura was under obligation to speak in court, 
which the district court concluded was inappropriate; rather, 
the prosecutor’s question was implying that Tsujimura had some 
obligation to say something  at the time of the stop, which the 
district court intimated was permissible.  
     
 
  In ruling on the case, the district court found that 
the car that Tsujimura was driving was straddling the line 
separating two lanes on the Moanalua freeway; that the eight 
seconds it took for Tsujimura to pull over was still a fair amount of time given that the police lights were activated; that 
Tsujimura’s speech was slurred, his face was flushed and red, 
and his eyes were red and watery; and that when Tsujimura 
“alighted from the car, he did not indicate any  difficulty 
walking.” The district court also made findings consistent with Officer Billins’ testimony as to Tsujimura’s performance on the 
FSTs. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Following Officer Billins ’ testimony, the State rested 
and Tsujimura moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that 
the State failed to present evidence as to the kind of alco
hol 
that allegedly impaired his faculties.  The district court denied the acquittal motion, and Tsujimura rested without 
presenting any evidence. 
10
  
 
 
   Based on the totality of the circumstances, including 
the manner in which Tsujimura was driving and Tsujimura’s 
physical condition that Officer Billins observed, the district 
court concluded that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt 
all the elements of the  OVUII offense charged under HRS § 291E-
9 61(a)(1).  
 
  
 
 
 
 
                                                        
   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
II. ICA PROCEEDINGS 
Tsujimura filed a notice of appeal to the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals (ICA), challenging the following rulings of the 
district court: (1) denial of his motion to dismiss the OVUII 
charge for fail ure to define the term “alcohol” in the 
complaint; (2) admission of Officer Billins’ testimony regarding 
Tsujimura’s failure to state that his injury would prevent him 
from getting out of his car; (3) denial of his motion for 
judgment of acquittal on the grounds that there was insufficient 
evidence that h e had consumed “alcohol”; and (4 ) denial of his 
motion for judgment of acquittal on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to establish that he was under the 
influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair his 
9 The district court sentenced Tsujimura to a 14 -hour minimum 
substance abuse rehabilitation program, a substance abuse assessment, and 
mandatory fees including “$100 DUI Drivers Education Fee, $7 Regular Drivers 
Education Fee, $30 Crime Victim Compensation Fee, $25 Neurotrauma Fund 
Surcharge, $250 Drug Demand Reduction Assessment, $150 of which will be suspended on the condition that Mr. Tsujimura complete all the other 
requirements of his sentence.” Tsujimura was also fine d $300, and his 
license was revoked for one year. 
11
  
 
 
  
  The ICA in its published opinion determined  that the 
statutory definition of “alcohol” under HRS § 291E -1 (2007 & 
Supp. 2012) is not limited to alcohol derived from distillation 
but that, based on the statute’s plain meaning, it “specifically 
includes ethyl alcohol, which is ‘the intoxicating agent in 
beer, wine and other fermented and distilled liquors.’” State 
v. Tsujimura, 137  Hawaii 117, 120, 366 P.3d 173, 176 ( App. 2016 ) 
(quoting Ethyl Alcohol, Webster Dictionary , http://www.webster-
dictionary.net/definition/ethyl alcohol  (last visited May 23, 
10  2017)).  The ICA  stated that , if the meaning of “alcohol” 
excludes beer and wine and other alcoholic products not derived 
from distillation, the purpose of the legislature in enacting 
the OVUII statutes would be undermined in that “drivers who 
became drunk as the result of consuming beer or wine would not 
be subject to prosecution.” Id.  at 120-21, 366 P.3d  at 176- 77.  
The ICA noted  that Tsujimura’s statutory construction would 
frustrate “the entire administrative and criminal statutory 
scheme set forth in HRS Chapter 291E.” Id.   The ICA also 
concluded that the statutory definition of “alcohol” is 
consistent with its ordinarily understood meaning and that 
                                                        
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
normal mental faculties or ability to care for himself and guard 
against casualty. 
10 In 2016, the legislature amended the definition of “alcohol” in 
HRS § 291E- 1 to mean “ethanol or any substance containing ethanol.” 2016 
Haw. Sess. Laws Act 231, § 59. 
12
  
 
 
   As to Tsujimura’s argument that his right to remain 
silent was violated, the ICA observed that Hawai i has not  
resolved whether there exists a constitutional right to 
prearrest silence.   Id.  at 123, 366 P.3d  at  179.  However, the 
ICA determined that it was not necessary to  reach this issue 
because Officer Billins ’ testimony did not constitute “an  
imp
ermissible comment on Tsujimura’ s assertion of his right to 
remain silent.” Id.   In evaluating Tsujimura’s contention, the 
ICA applied the test   set forth in State v. Padilla , 57 Haw. 150,  
158 P.2d 357 (1976), and considered whether   the prosecutor’s 
question and Officer Billins’ answer to it  were manifestly 
intended or of such character that the district court would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on Tsujimura’s 
exercise of his right to remain silent.  Tsujimura , 137 Hawai i  
at 123, 366 P.3d at 179.   The ICA reasoned that the question--
“Do you recall if the defendant indicated to you he would have 
difficulty exiting the car because of his previous leg injury?” -
-and Officer Billins’ answer  that “[n]o statements were made”  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
“there was no need for the State to define the term ‘alcohol’ in 
the OVUII charge in order to give Tsujimura fair notice of the 
charge against him.” Id.  at  121, 366 P.3d at  177.  Accordingly, 
the ICA held that the complaint charging Tsujimura  
with OVUII  
was not deficient for failing to set forth the statutory 
definition of “alcohol.” Id.  
13
  
 
 
    
 
  Finally, the ICA determined that there was sufficient  
evidence to establish that Tsujimura consumed “alcohol” because 
Tsujimura was under the influence of ethyl alcohol, which is the 
intoxicating agent in beer, wine, and other fermented and 
distilled liquors and the active principle in intoxicating 
drinks.   Id.  at 122, 366 P.3d at 178.   Therefore,  viewing the 
evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the ICA 
concluded that the evidence adduced by the State at trial 
constituted sufficient evidence to support Tsujimura’s 
conviction. Id.  at 124, 366 P.3d 
at 180.   
 
  
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
“were directed at whether there was any indication that 
Tsujimura’s prior knee injury affected his ability to perform 
the field sobriety tests.” Id. at 124, 366 P.3d at 180.  
According to the ICA, the prosecutor’s question and Officer Billins’ answer were not an “attempt to imply that an innocent 
person in Tsujimura ’s position would have spoken.”  Id.  
III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
Statutory interpretation is reviewed de novo.  State 
v. Wang, 91 Hawai i 140, 141, 981 P.2d 230, 231 (1999).   “At all 
times, the question of whether a charge is sufficient is a matter of constitutional law, and our review of such matters is 
de novo.” Schwartz v. State , 136 Hawai i 258, 286, 361 P.3d 
1161, 1189 (2015). As to evidentiary rulings, the standard of 
review is “abuse of discretion, unless application of the rule

   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
admits only one correct result, in which case, review is under a 
right/wrong standard.” State v. Rabellizsa , 79 Hawai i 347, 349, 
903 P.2d 43, 45 (1995).  Questions of constitutional law are 
reviewed de novo , and this court exercises its independent 
judgment in considering such questions.  State v. Mattson, 122 
Hawaii 312, 321, 226 P.3d 482, 491 (2010). Legal sufficiency of 
the evidence to support a conviction is a question of law reviewed by this court de novo, the specific test being 
“whether, ‘viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, there is substantial evidence to support the 
conclusion of the trier of fact. ’” State v. Hirayasu , 71 Haw. 
587, 589, 801 P.2d 25, 26 (1990) (quoting State v. Hernandez , 61 
Haw. 475, 477, 605 P.2d 75, 77 (1980)). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
A. 
Meaning of Alcohol and Sufficiency of the Complaint 
Tsujimura contends that the statutory definition of 
“alcohol
” in HRS § 291E-1 (2007 & Supp. 2012) is limited to 
alcohol derived from distillation.  Thus, argues Tsujimura, the definition of “alcohol” should have been included in the 
complaint. 
1. The Meaning of Alcohol 
Statutory construction commences “with an examination 
of the plain language in order to determine and give effect to 
the legislative intent and purpose underlying the statute. ” 
15
  
 
 
    
 
 
   
   
 
 
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
State v. Pacquing , 139 Hawai i 302, 310, 389 P.3d 897, 905  
(2016).   “The legislature is presumed not to intend an absurd 
result, and legislation will be construed to avoid, if possible, 
inconsistency, contradiction[,] and illogicality.”  State v. 
Arceo, 84 Hawai i 1, 19, 928 P. 2d 843, 861 (1996) ( quoting 
State v. Malufao , 80 Hawai
i  126, 137, 906 P.2d 612, 623 
(1995)).   Invariably, t his court’s foremost obligation in 
statutory interpretation is to effectuate the statute’s purpose .  
State v. Ganal , 81 Hawai i 358, 371, 917 P.2d 370, 383 (1996) .  
HRS § 291E-1 defines alcohol as 
the product of distillation of any fermented liquid, 
regardless of whether rectified, whatever may be the origin 
thereof, and includes ethyl alcohol, lower aliphatic  
alcohol, and phenol as well as synthetic ethyl alcohol, but 
not denatured or other alcohol that is considered not 
potable under the customs laws of the United States.  
(Emphasis added.) Contrary to Tsujimura’s contention, the 
statutory meaning of “alcohol” is not circumscribed to alcohol 
derived from distillation. Tsujimura’s proffered interpretation 
overlooks the conjunctive clause “and includes” in the statutory 
definition. Previous cases counsel that “‘including’ means 
either ‘an enlargement and has the meaning of and or in addition 
to, or merely specifies a particular thing already included within the general words theretofore used. ’” State v. Guyton, 
135 Hawai i 372, 379 n.14, 351 P.3d 1138, 1145 n.14 (2015) 
16

  
 
 
   
  In this case,  because  “and” precedes “includes,”  the 
phrase “and includes” means “in addition to” instead of merely 
specifying particular examples of “product of distillation.”   
Viewed another way, the second definitional clause following “and includes” is separate and distinct from the first 
definitional clause ending with the word “thereof. ”   
Accordingly, “alcohol”  means  “the product of distillation of any 
fermented liquid, regardless of whether rectified, whatever may 
be the origin thereof.”  And “alcohol” also  “includes ethyl 
alcohol, lower aliphatic alcohol, and phenol as well as 
synthetic ethyl alcohol ”  regardless of whether they are products 
of distillation.  
  To be sure, in cases where a general definitional 
clause is followed by a list prefaced by the word “including,” this court has held that the list provides examples that  
particularize or elaborate upon the general definitional clause.   
Pacquing, 139 Hawai i at 319  —20, 389 P.3d at  914—15.   In such 
cases, the general definitional clause is treated as providing the outer limits of the meaning of the defined term, and the 
list that follows  “including” is regarded as non  -exhaustive 
examples of the general definitional clause.   Lealaimatafao v. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(quoting Hawaiian Ass’n of Se venth– Day Adventists v. Wong , 130

Woodward-Clyde Consultants , 75 Hawai i 544, 556, 867 P.2d 220, 
226 (1994). 
But here, by using the phrase “and includes,” the 
legislature clearly disassociated the first definitional clause 
from the second definitional clause. “[E]thyl alcohol, lower 
aliphatic alcohol, and phenol as well as synthetic ethyl alcohol” are not illustrative of or circumscribed by the phrase 
“the product of distillation ,” and instead, they qualify as 
“alcohol” within HRS § 291E -1 even if they are not a product of 
distillation. Hence, the meaning of “alcohol ” is inclusive of 
ethyl alcohol, also commonly known as ethanol, which “is the 
intoxicating agent in beer, wine, and other fermented and distilled liquors .”
11 Accordingly, the statutory definition of 
“alcohol” includes beer, wine, and other fermented liquors 
12because these substances contain ethanol.
This interpretation is consistent with the purpose of 
the legislature in enacting the OVUII statutes: to promote 
public safety by making it a crime to operate a vehicle while 
impaired by an intoxicant.  See, e.g. , H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 
788-82, in 1982 House Journal, at 1261 (noting that the 1982 
amendments sought to balance and weigh “the n eed of protecting

  Tsujimura argues that the complaint should be 
dismissed as insufficient because the State failed to include 
the statutory definition of “alcohol,” depriving him of his 
state constitutional right to be apprised of what he must defend 
against. “Article 1, section 14 of the Hawaii Constitution  
. . . require[s]    that ‘[i]n all criminal prosecutions,  the 
accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be informed of the nature 
and cause of the accusation[.]’”  State v. Wells , 78 Hawai i  373, 
379, 894 P.2d 70, 76 (1995) ( alterations in original).   It is ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
our citizens against the danger of drunken drivers and, at the 
same time, insuring that the measures adopted to curb drunken 
driving do not discriminate against any class of our society”). 
Tsujimura’s interpretation, which would exclude from OVUII 
prosecution persons impaired by alcohol not derived from 
distillation, would lead to a result that  undermines the  
legislative purpose. This illogical result  is avoided by 
effectuating the plain language of  the statutory definition of 
“alcohol,”  which  includes ethyl alcohol regardless of origin   or 
derivation. Pac. Ins. v. Or.   Auto Ins., 53 Haw.  208, 211, 490  
P.2d 899, 901   (1971).   Thus, the ICA 
reached the correct result  
in holding that “alcohol” is not limited to alcohol produced 
through distillation; however, this result is chiefly dictated 
by the plain language of HRS § 291E-1.  
2. Sufficiency of the Complaint 
19
  
 
 
  
 
  This court has noted that “[w]here the statute sets 
forth with reasonable clarity all essential elements of the 
crime intended to be punished, and fully defines the offense in 
unmistakable terms readily comprehensible to persons of common 
understanding, a charge drawn in the language of the statute is 
sufficient.”   Id.  at 282, 567 P.2d  at 1245; accord  State v. 
Wheeler, 121 Hawai i 383, 393, 219 P.3d  
 1170,  1180 (2009).  But  
“where the definition of an offense . . . includes generic 
terms, it is not sufficient that the indictment shall  charge the 
offense in the same generic terms as in the definition; . . . it 
must state the species . . . [and] descend to particulars.” 
State v. Israel , 78 Hawai i 66, 73 , 890 P.2d 303, 310  (1995)  
(quoting Russell v. United States , 369 U.S. 749, 765 (1962)); 
accord Wheeler , 121 Hawai i at   393, 219 P.3d at 1180.   
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
settled law that an “accusation must sufficiently allege all of 
the essential elements of the offense charged,” a requirement 
that “obtains whether an accusation is in the nature of an oral 
charge, information, indictment, or complaint.” State v. 
Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 279, 281, 567 P.2d 1242, 1244 (1977). 
In this case, Tsujimura was charged by complaint with 
being “under the influence of alcohol in an amount suffic ient to 
impair his normal mental faculties or ability to care for himself and guard against casualty.” As discussed, the 
20
  
 
 
statutory meaning of alcohol is not limited to alcohol produced 
by the process of distillation. The commonly understood meaning 
of “alcohol” is that it is “ a clear liquid that has a strong 
smell, that is used in some medicines and other products, and that is the substance in liquors (such as beer, wine, or 
13  whiskey) that can make a person drunk .” The statutory meaning 
of “alcohol” includes e thyl alcohol, which is the intoxicating  
agent in beer, wine, and other fermented and distilled liquors.  
Thus, “alcohol,” as defined by statute, encompasses substances 
and beverages commonly understood to cons titute “alcohol” in lay 
terms. Accordingly, it was not necessary to include the statutory definition of “alcohol” in the complaint against 
Tsujimura because the statutory definition “comport [s] with  
[the] commonly understood definition ” of alcohol. Wheeler, 121 
Hawaii at 394, 219 P.3d   at 1181 .  Thus, even without the 
statutory definition of “alcohol,” the complaint “ fully defines 
the offense in unmistakable terms ,” is “ readily comprehensible 
to persons of common understanding ,” and is, therefore, 
sufficient. Jendrusch , 58 Haw. at 282, 567 P.2d  at 1245.

B. Prearrest Right to Remain Silent 
During the State’s case -in-chief in the trial in this 
case, the prosecutor asked Officer Billins on redirect 
examination, “ Do you recall if the defendant indicated to you he 
would have difficulty exiting the car because of his previous leg injury?” Over defense counsel’s repeated objection , the 
district court permitted Officer Billins to answer the 
prosecutor’s question. The officer responded, “No statements 
were made.” Tsujimura argues that the information elicited by 
the prosecutor--that he failed to tell Officer Billins that he 
would have difficulty exiting the car because of his previous 
leg injury--improperly commented on his right to remain silent. 
In reviewing Tsujimura’s contention, i t is important 
to identify the timeframe that the prosecutor’s question focused 
on when he asked Officer Billins about what Tsujimura failed to say: it was before Tsujimura was formally arrested or given 
Miranda warnings.  This court has not yet spoken on whether the right to remain silent, which is an integral part of the 
privilege against compelled self-incrimination, attaches 
prearrest and, if so, whether and within what bounds such 
silence may be used against a criminal defendant at trial. See  
State v. Mainaaupo , 117 Hawai i 235, 252 n.9, 178 P.3d 1, 18 n.9 
(2008) (reasoning that “the [deputy prosecuting attorney] ’s

  The United States Supreme Court  has  not definitively  
resolved under the federal constitution the issue of whether   the 
privilege against compelled self-incrimination attaches before 
arrest. Jenkins  v. Anderson , 447 U.S. 231,  236 n.2 (1980)    (“Our 
decision today does not consider whether or under what 
circumstances prearrest silence may be protected by the Fifth 
Amendment.”)   The Supreme Court was not  required to resolve this  
issue because its precedents “ clearly permit[] impeachment even  
if the prearrest silence were held to be an invocation of the 
14 Fifth Amendment right to remain silent .”  Id.; Portuondo v. 
                                                        
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
pre-arrest silence ” but not addressing that issue because it was 
not raised,  and also noting that “ courts are divided on whether 
the government may comment on a defendant’ s pre-arrest 
silence”).  
1. Prearrest Right to Remain Silent Under Article I, Section 10 
of the Hawai i Constitution 
14 The propriety of utilizing a defendant’s silence in criminal 
trials has been explored by the Supreme Court in several cases. In Doyle v. 
Ohio, 426 U.S. 610 (1976), the Court held that the prosecution may not 
impeach a defendant by using his post -arrest, post- Miranda silence, reasoning 
that a defendant, after being apprised of his or her Miranda right to remain 
silent, cannot thereafter be penalized for exercising that right. Id. at 
611. In Jenkins , the Supreme Court “conclude[d] that the Fifth Amendment is 
not violated by the use of prearrest silence to impeach a criminal 
defendant’s credibility” because, by testifying at his or her own trial, the defendant “cast[s] aside his cloak of silence” and impeachment is a necessary 
concomitant of that decision. 447 U.S. at 238. Two years later, the Supreme 
Court decided Fletcher  v. Weir, 455 U.S. 603 (1982), a case in which the 
defendant, post -arrest, was not given Miranda 
warnings. “In the absence of 
the sort of affirmative assurances embodied in the Miranda warnings,” the 
Court held that it is not a violation of “due process o f law for a State to 
permit cross
-examination as to postarrest silence when a defendant chooses to 
take the stand” for the purpose of impeaching the defendant. Id. at 607.  In 
(continued . . .) 
23
  
 
 
   In determining whether the right to remain silent  
attaches before arrest, the governing  provision of the Hawai i  
Constitution is  article I, section 10, which  provides, “[N]or 
shall any person be compelled in any criminal case to be a 
                                                                                                                                                                                   
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Agard, 529 U.S. 61, 70 (2000) (noting that, under Jenkins, “it 
was not clear whether the Fifth Amendment protects prearrest 
silence”).   
But because this court is “ the ultimate judicial 
tribunal with final, unreviewable authority to interpret and 
enforce the Hawai i Constitution, [it is]   free to give broader 
protection under the Hawai i  Constitution than that given by the 
federal constitution. ”  State v. Arceo, 84 Hawai i 1, 28, 928  
P.2d 843, 870 (1996) (quoting State v. Wallace , 80 Hawai i 382,  
397 n.14, 910 P.2d 695, 710 n.14 (1996)); see, e.g., State v. Hoey, 77 Hawai i 17, 36, 881 P.2d 504, 523 (1994) (affording  
broader protection to suspects during custodial interrogation under the Hawai  i Constitution  than that provided by the federal 
constitution).   Thus, this court may interpret the Hawai i  
Constitution to provide broader rights  against self-
incrimination than  its federal counterpart.  
(continued . . . )  
Salinas v. Texas , 133 S. Ct. 2174 (2013) (plurality), prosecutors used the 
defendant’s silence during a pre -custodial interview as substantive evidence 
of guilt. Id. at 2178 —79. A plurality of the Court concluded that, where 
the defendant does not invoke the right to remain silent in a non -coercive, 
pre
-custodial interview situatio n, prosecutors could use the defendant’s 
prearrest silence as substantive proof of guilt. Id. at 2184.

witness against oneself. ” Haw. Const. art. I, § 10.   In 
Mainaaupo, this court held that “ the right against self-
incrimination attache[s] at least as of the time of [an]  
arrest
,” regardless of whether Miranda  warnings have been given. 
117 Hawai i at   252, 178 P.3d at 18.  The Mainaaupo   court left 
open the question of whether  the right against self-
incrimination attaches before arrest.  See id.    at 252 n.9, 178  
P.3d at 18 n.9    (noting that whether  the right against self-
incrimination applies to prearrest silence was not an issue and 
was therefore not addressed).  
This court construes the provisions of the Hawai i 
Constitution using canons similar to those used in statutory 
construction. “
[T]he settled rule is that in the construction 
of a constitutional provision the words are presumed to be used 
in their natural sense unless the context furnishes some ground 
to control, qualify, or enlarge them. ” 
Yoshina, 84 Hawai i 374, 376, 935 P.2d 89, 91 (1997) (quoting 
Pray v. Judicial Selection Comm’n , 75 Hawai i 333, 342, 861 P.2d 
723, 727 (1993)). The plain language of article I, section 10 
provides, “[N]or shall any person be compelled to be a witness 
against oneself. ” Haw. Const. art. I, § 10.  Unlike those 
provisions of the 
Hawaii Constitution that explicitly apply only 
25
  
 
 
   Thus, the privilege against compelled self-
incrimination functions to protect “any person”  regardless of 
whether that person has been arrested or  accused.  It is 
therefore evident from the language of article I, section 10 
that the right to remain silent attaches even before arrest is 
16 made.  Cf. id.   (holding that the right to remain silent 
attaches even before arrest and reasoning that, based on the 
                                                        
 15  See, e.g., Haw. Const. art. I, § 14 (enumerating rights that only 
accrue to individuals that have already been “accused” of a crime). We voice 
no opinion regarding the timeframe and manner in which the various rights 
enumerated in article I, section 14 apply. We simply note the plain -language 
difference between article I, section 14 and article I, section 10.  
   
 
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
15  to specified categories of individuals, article I, section 10 
is clear that its guarantees are meant to attach to “any 
person.” Cf.  United States ex. rel. Savory v. Lane  , 832 F.2d 
1011, 1017 (7th Cir. 1987) (comparing the language of the Sixth  
Amendment, which gives the right to counsel  to an “accused,”  
with the language of the Fifth Amendment, which states that “[n]o person  shall  . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be 
a witness against himself ”).  
16 See also Tortolito v. State , 901 P.2d 387, 390 (Wyo. 1995) 
(holding that under Wyoming’s constitution, there is “no rational reason to 
limit the protection embracing the citizen’s right to silence to the post -
arrest or post- Miranda situation. The constitutional right to silence exists 
at all times--before arrest, at arrest, and after arrest; before a Miranda 
warning and after it. The right is self -executing.”); State v. Fencl, 325 
N.W.2d 703, 711 (Wis. 1982) (“The Fifth Amendment protects a person from compelled self- incrimination at all times, not just upon arrest or during a 
custodial interrogation.”); see also  Coppola v. Powell , 878 F.2d 1562, 1565

language of the U.S. Constitution, “unlike the right to 
counsel,” the right to remain silent “ attaches before the 
institution of formal adversary proceed ings”). 
In confirming the plain-language interpretation of a 
constitutional provision, the intent underlying its ratification 
is a relevant consideration. See  State v. Rodrigues , 63 Haw. 
412, 416, 629 P.2d 1111, 1114 (1981).  The purpose of the 
privilege against self-incrimination is twofold: to protect an 
individual “from having to reveal, directly or indirectly, his 
knowledge of facts relating him to the offense or from having to 
share his thoughts and beliefs with the Government, ” Doe v. 
United States , 487 U.S. 201, 213 (1988), and to “demand[] that 
the government seeking to punish an individual produce the 
evidence against him by its own independent labors, rather than 
by the cruel, simple expedient of compelling it from his own 
mouth,” Miranda  v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 460 (1966). Accord  
State v. Grahovac , 52 Haw. 527, 532 –33, 480 P.2d 148, 152 
(1971). 
Establishing that the privilege against compelled 
self-incrimination attaches to a person even without formal arrest or the institution of criminal proceedings effectuates 
the purpose underlying the privilege, for it places on the 
government the onus of producing evidence against individuals 
that the government intends to punish and correspondingly frees 
27
  
 
 
individuals from any obligation to speak.  It is also consistent 
with the fact that  “the right to remain silent derives from the 
Constitution and not from the Miranda  warnings themselves, ”  
Mainaaupo, 117 
Hawaii at 252, 178 P.3d   at 18  (quoting United 
States v. Velarde –Gomez, 269 F.3d 1023, 1029 (9th Cir.  2001) (en 
banc)); accord  Roberts v. United States , 445 U.S. 552, 560 
(1980), and that, therefore, the privilege against self-
incrimination exists even without the articulation of Miranda  
17 warnings.  
    
 
  
  
 
 
                                                        
  
 
 
 
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Given that the right to remain silent attaches 
prearrest pursuant to article I, section 10, we hold that the 
right clearly attached in this case at least at the point when Tsujimura was detained as a result of the investigatory stop.
18 
See State v. Eleneki , 106 Hawai i 177, 180, 102 P.3d 1075, 1078 
(2004) (“It is axiomatic that ‘ stopping an automobile and 
detaining its occupants constitu tes a “seizure” within the 
17 See  State v. Easter, 922 P.2d 1285, 1290 —91 (Wash. 1996) (“An 
accused’s right to silence derives, not from Miranda, but from the Fifth 
Amendment itself. The Fifth Amendment applies before the defendant is in 
custody or is the subject of suspicion or investigation.”); Fencl, 325 N.W.2d 
at 711 n.10 (“Nor is the Fifth Amendment right against self -incrimination 
dependent upon a person’s receipt of the Miranda warning. Miranda  did not 
create new rights but, rather, held that the constitutional guarantees 
already accorded a defendant by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments should be explained to the defendant during a critical stage of the criminal 
proceeding.”). 
Because this case involves a seizure situation, we express no 
opinion as to other prearrest situations in which the right to remain silent 
would be triggered. 
We do not reach that issue because it is not implicated 
in this case.

meaning of the Fourth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution and Article I, Section 7 of the Hawai i 
Constitution, even though the purpose of the stop is limited and 
the resulting detention quite brief. ’”  (quoting State v. Powell, 
61 Haw. 316, 320, 603 P.2d 143, 147  (1979))).   Thus, upon  
Tsujimura ’s  seiz
ure, his right to remain silent was invoked, and 
this right continued during his  detention.  
The question then arises as to whether prearrest 
silence may be used by the State against a defendant and, if so, within what bounds. As stated, the Supreme Court has held that 
prearrest silence may be used to impeach a defendant.  See  
Jenkins
, 447 U.S. 231; supra note 14.  But the Supreme Court has 
not yet spoken on whether prearrest silence may be used as 
substantive proof of guilt, and circuit courts of appeals are 
split over this issue. Several circuits have held that 
prearrest silence may not be used as substantive proof of guilt. 
See Coppola v. Powell , 878 F.2d 1562, 1568 (1st Cir. 1989) (by 
using defendant’s prearrest silence in the prosecution’s case -
in-chief, defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights were violated) ;

Numerous state appellate courts have also taken the 
position that prearrest silence can be used only to impeach a 
defendant and not as proof of guilt in the prosecution’s case -
in-chief.  See  State v. Reid, 20 A.3d 298, 304 (N.H. 2011) (“A 
defendant’s pre-arrest silence may be used to impeach his

   We agree with the federal circuit courts of appeals

hold otherwise would “ create an incentive for arresting officers 
to delay interrogation in order to create an intervening 
‘silence’ that would then be used against the defendant.”

(permitting the use of prearrest silence as proof of guilt leads 
to a system where the government “can time the citizen’ s arrest 
to occur after the citizen stands mute in the face of the accusation”).  Indeed, allowing prearrest silence to be used as 
proof of guilt “ would also encourage the authorities to refrain 
from issuing Miranda  warnings as long as possible in an attempt 
to generate either inferential evidence of guilt from silence or 
                                                        
 20  This court need not reach the issue of whether, under the Hawai i 
Constitution, a defendant’s prearrest silence can be used for impeachment 
purposes in cases where the defendant chooses to testify because, in this case, Tsujimura’s prearrest silence was used as substantive evidence of 
guilt. Further, Tsujimura did not testify, so there was never any basis to 
impeach his credibility by using his prearrest silence. See Brown , 919 A.2d 
at 116— 17 (because defendant did not testify, the prosecutor’s use of 
defendant’s silence could not have been for impeach ment); State v. Harrison , 
721 S.E.2d 371, 379 (N.C. Ct. App. 2012) (police officer’s statement as to 
defendant’s prearrest silence could not have been used for impeachment where 
the defendant testified after the police officer).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
32
  
 
 
    
  Proscribing the use of prearrest silence that occurs 
at least as of the time that a person has been detained is also 
consistent with the well-established tenet that a person being 
questioned by a law enforcement officer during an investigatory 
stop “is not obliged to respond.”   Berkemer v. McCarty , 468 U.S. 
420, 439 (1984). 
If the State were authorized to use a person’s 
silence during an investigatory stop as substantive evidence of guilt, it would effectively punish a person for exercising a 
legal right, a result that is constitutionally unacceptable.   
Cf. State v. Wakisaka , 102 Hawai i 504, 514–15, 78 P.3d 317, 327 – 
28 (2003) (“[N]o ‘penalty’ may ever be imposed on someone who 
exercises his core Fifth Amendment right no t to be a ‘witness’  
against himself in a ‘criminal case.’”  (quoting Chavez v. 
Martinez, 538 U.S. 760, 768 —760 (2003))); Griffin v. California , 
380 U.S. 609, 613 –14 (1965) (denouncing the practice of 
commenting on a defendant’s silence as “a penalty imposed by 
courts for exercising a constitu tional privilege” in that “[i]t 
“cuts down on the privilege by making its assertion costly”) .  
  Finally, we emphasize that  the silence used against 
Tsujimura was not made in response to a question posed by 
Officer Billins. The prosecutor’s question was wh ether 
Tsujimura told Officer Billins that  his injuries would give him  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
an admission p rior to custodial interrogation.” Palmer, 860 
P.2d at 349—50; accord Easter , 922 P.2d at 1290.

  We further reaffirm that, where the prearrest silence occurs in 
the context of a person’s refusal to answer questions, there is no “express 
invocation” requirement in order to trigger the right to remain silent under 
the Hawai i Constitution; we thus reject the holding of the plurality opinion 
in Salinas, which requires the defendant to expressly invoke the right to 
silence by “say[ing] that [he or she] was not answering the officer’s 
question on Fifth Amendment grounds” or something similarly phrased. 
Salinas
, 133 S. Ct. at 2180.  Hawai i case law is clear that the 
constitutional right against self -incrimination under the Hawai i Constitution 
is invoked when a person “either remains silent  or expresses ‘his desire to 
deal with police interrogators only through his counsel. ’” State v. Luton , 
83 Hawai i. 443, 453, 927 P.2d 844, 854 (1996) (emphasis added) (quoting State 
v. Mailo, 69 Haw. 51, 731 P.2d 1264 (1987)). Thus, under the Hawai i 
Constitution, the mere fact that a person remained silent in the face of 
police questioning is enough to invoke the right to remain silent, and 
“express invocation” is not necessary.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
a difficult time exiting his car; that is, the prosecutor was 
asking what Tsujimura failed to say even if the information was 
not prompted or sought from him by Officer Billins.21 
In light of these circumstances, permitting silence to 
serve as an implication of guilt would mean that the State would 
always be able to use as substantive proof of guilt prearrest 
silence not made in response to a question by a police officer. 
The prosecutor need only identify a point in time during the 
defendant’s interaction with the police officer whe n no question 
was posed and no verbal exchange was had (and, therefore, the defendant was expectedly silent) and use that silence as 
evidence to infer th e defendant’s guilt. This would engender a 
result where, in any encounter between a law enforcement officer 
and a citizen, the State would be able to adduce evidence of 
21 Under the facts of this case, where there was no verbal exchange 
between the police officer and the defendant, there is no requirement that 
the defendant invoke the right to remain silent because, at that particular 
juncture, there was no opportunity to do so. 
34
  
 
 
   
 
  
   
  
 
 
 
  
 
   
 
  Accordingly, for the reasons stated, the State may not 
use as substantive proof of guilt a defendant’s prearrest 
silence that occurs at least as of the time of detention, for 
doing so would violate the right against compelled self-
incrimination under article I, section 10 of the Hawai i 
Constitution.  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
prearrest silence in myriad ways (e.g., When she was handing you 
her driver’s license and registration, did she say anything 
about her injuries?, While she was opening the glove box, did 
she say anything about her injuries?, While she was outside the 
car, did she say anything?, etc.). 
This acutely prejudicial effect is magnified for non -
native English language speakers, youth, and other individuals 
detained at a traffic stop who may be reluctant to speak in the 
presence of law enforcement officers due to age, gender, or 
linguistic, cultural, or other reasons. The burden to explain 
at trial their prearrest silence would fall upon these 
defendants whenever the State uses their silence to imply their 
guilt, compromising their constitutional right to choose not to 
testify and raising questions of fundamental fairness. 
2. The Constitutional Prohibition on Prosecutorial  Comment on 
One’s Exercise of the Right to Remain Silent   
In this case, t he information about Tsujimura’s 
prearrest silence was introduced at trial through the

   In evaluating the propriety of a prosecutor’s comment  
in certain trial situations, the test that this court has 
“applied is whether the language used was ‘manifestly intended 
or was of such character that the jury would naturally and 
necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the 
accused to testify.’”  State v. Padilla, 57 Haw. 150, 158, 552 
P.2d 357, 362 (1976)  (quoting United States v. Wright , 309 F.2d 
735, 738 (7th Cir. 1962)
), overruled on other grounds by State   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
prosecutor’s redirect examination of Officer Billins, who 
testified that Tsujimura did not say that his injury would give  
him difficulty exiting his car.   A concomitant of the right to 
remain silent is the prohibition on the prosecution from  
commenting on a person’s exercise of that right. State v. 
Rodrigues
, 113 Hawai i 41, 49, 147 P.3d 825, 833 (2006)   (“As a 
rule, the prosecution may not comment on a d efendant’s failure 
to testify.” (quoting State v. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai i 504, 514  –15, 
78 P.3d 317, 327 –28 (2003))).   A prosecutor may not  imply guilt  
from a defendant’s exercise of the right to remain silent , for 
doing so would dilute the right, undermine t   he values that the  
right protects, and penalize the defendant for exercising a 
constitutional right.  See  State v. Melear , 63 Haw. 488, 496, 
630 P.2d 619, 626 (1981) (noting that a prosecutor may not 
comment on a defendant’s silence in a manner that sugges ts such 
silence as evidence of guilt).

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
v. Cabagbag, 127 Hawai i 302, 277 P.3d 1027 (2012) .   The Padilla  
test was designed and has been most often used in cases where 
the prosecutor makes comments, after the close of evidence, on the defendant’s failure to testify. See, e.g., Melear, 63 Haw. 
at 496, 630 P.2d at 626 (closing argument);  Wakisaka, 102 Hawai i  
at 515, 78 P.3d  at 328 (rebuttal argument);  State v. Valdivia, 
95 Hawai i 465, 481, 24 P.3d 661, 677 (2001)   (closing and 
22 rebuttal arguments).   Approximately ten years ago, this court 
avowed application of  the Padilla  test in a case involving a 
question-and-answer exchange between a prosecutor and a 
detective during the State’s case -in-chief.  In Rodrigues, the 
prosecutor asked the detective what the defendant’s response  was  
to the detective’s request to tape -record their conversation.  
113 Hawai i  at 46, 147 P.3d at 830. The detective answered, “ As 
I recall, he did not wish to be tape-recorded .”    The 
defendant later challenged the information elicited, contending that his refusal to be tape  -recorded was used as a negative 
22 The origin of the Padilla test is illuminating in this regard. 
It was originally adopted by this court from United States v. Wright , a 
Seventh Circuit case involving a challenge to a portion of the prosecutor’s 
closing argument. 309 F.2d at 738 —739. Wright borrowed the Padilla  
formulation from Knowles v. United States, which also involved a challenge to 
the prosecutor’s closing argu ment. 224 F.2d 168, 170 (10th Cir. 1955). 
Knowles, in turn, adopted the Padilla test from Morrison v. United States, an 
Eighth Circuit case that dealt with the propriety of the court’s jury 
instructions. 6 F.2d 809, 811 (8th Cir. 1925). It is thus apparent that the 
Padilla test was originally fashioned to cover situations in which the 
defendant seeks to challenge the conduct of the prosecutor or the court that occurs after the close of evidence, not instances in which the challenge 
relates to information elicited by a prosecutor from a witness during the 
testimony phase of the trial.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
inference of his credibility and, thus, improperly commented on 
his right to remain silent. Id. at 49, 147 P.3d at 833. 
In rejecting the defendant’s challenge, this court 
focused on the purpose of the prosecution in adducing 
information about the defendant’s refusal to be tape -recorded 
and the fact that the information did not suggest any inference of guilt. The court explained “ that the question . . . posed, 
and the information elicited, [w]as part of the prosecution’ s 
effort to maximize the reliability of [the detective’s] 
recollections and to explain why the detective could only rely 
on his notes and not an audiotape of the interview.” Id. 
Further, the court reasoned that the prosecutor’s question was “part of a line of inquiry design ed to establish the detective’ s 
custom and practice regarding accurately transcribing . . . statements” and “ was unaccompanied by any implication of guilt 
with respect to [the defendant]’ s unwillingness to be 
audiotaped.” Id. at 49–50, 147 P.3d at 833– 34.  Accordingly, 
the court held that the information elicited from the detective 
during the State’s case -in-chief was not an improper comment on 
the defendant’s right to remain silent.  Id. at 50, 147 P.3d at 
834. 
We note that the plain language of Padilla--“comment 
on failure to testify ”--is not readily applicable to cases 
involving a question-and-answer exchange between a prosecutor

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
and a witness that leads to evidence concerning  the defendant’s 
pretrial silence.  Padilla’s focus is on a defendant’s “failure 
to testify” and not on a defendant’s pretrial exercise of the  
23 right to remain silent.   In addition, although  Rodrigues  
appears to have made the  Padilla  framework applicable to cases 
with facts generally similar to this case, Rodrigues   actually 
adjusted and particularized the Padilla  framework to make it 
more suitable for application in situations where the challenged  
“comment” is made during a question-and-answer exchange between 
a prosecutor and a witness.  It is evident from  the  court’s line 
of reasoning in Rodrigues that   the core of the  analysis is 
predicated upon the prosecution’s pu rpose in eliciting the 
contested evidence or on the character of the evidence.   See  id.  
at 49–50, 147 P.3d at 833  –34 (reasoning that the purpose of the 
prosecution’s question was not to imply guilt and that the information elicited “ was unaccompanied by any implication of 
guilt”).

defendant’s pre arrest silence , the test is whether the

transpires during the State’s case -in-chief; thus, the prosecutor under such 
circumstances would not have th e opportunity to comment on the defendant’s 
“failure to testify” because the defendant’s presentation of his or her case 
is yet to commence such that it is still uncertain whether the defendant 
would choose to testify. See Hawai i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 24.1(a)

of the State’s case -in-chief unless the court orders otherwise).

prosecutor intended  for the information elicited  to imply the

reasoned that the prosecutor “did not ask the jury to infer an 
admission or consciousness  of guilt from the defendant’ s 
silence”); State v. Terry , 328 P.3d 932, 938 (Wash. Ct. App. 
2014) (explaining that an indirect comment on the defendant’s

3. The Information Elicited by the Prosecutor Violated 
Tsujimura’s Right to Remain Silent 
As stated, the information elicited by the prosecutor 
from Officer Billins during the State’s case -in-chief is the 
fact that Tsujimura did not say anything about his injury as he was exiting his car. The ICA concluded that the information 
elicited by the prosecutor was not a comment on the right to 
remain silent because the prosecutor’s question and “Officer 
Billins’ answer were directed at whether there was any 
indication that Tsujimura’ s prior knee injury affected his 
ability to perform the field sobriety tests. ” State v. 
Tsujimura, 137 Hawai i 117, 124, 366 P.3d 173, 180 (App. 2016).  
However, the fact that Tsujimura’s prearrest silence was used to prove that his performance of the FSTs was not affected by his 
injury is exactly the reason why the information elicited was an 
impermissible comment.   By eliciting the fact that Tsujimura did 
not say anything about his injury while he exited his car, it was clear that the State’s purpose was to imply that Tsujimura’s 
41
  
 
 
   
  
  
  
 
 
  
  In addition,  even if we were to assume that the 
State’s purpose in offering evidence of Tsujimura’s prearrest 
silence was proper,  the character of the evidence would still  
lead to the conclusion that its admission at trial  was improper.   
The evidence suggested to the district court judge that 
Tsujimura’s silence implied that his physical condition while 
performing the FSTs was due to alcohol impairment and that, 
therefore, he was guilty as charged. That is, the character of 
the information about Tsuji mura’s prearrest silence was such ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
injuries did not physically inhibit him from performing the FSTs 
and to inferentially establish that Tsujimura’s diminished 
faculties during the FSTs were a product of intoxication and not 
influenced by his injuries. 
This purpose was essentially conceded by the State 
when it indicated in its answering brief that one of the 
purposes of the prosecutor’s question was to “show that there 
was no indication that Tsujimura’s leg injury affec ted the FST 
test.” The State therefore intended for the exchange between 
the prosecutor and Officer Billins to adduce information about 
Tsujimura’s prearrest silence as substantive proof of his guilt, 
which as discussed supra, the State may not do.  See also Ouska   
v.
 Cahill-Masching,
 246 F.3d 1036, 1049 (7th Cir. 2001); State 
v. Leach, 807 N.E.2d 335, 339 (Ohio 2004); Tortolito  v. State,  
901 P.2d 387, 391 (Wyo. 1995).  
42
  
 
 
   Accordingly, the information  regarding Tsujimura’s 
prearrest silence  was erroneously admitted because the State’s 
purpose in adducing it was to imply Tsujimura’s guilt and 
because the character of the information suggested to the 
district court judge that it may be considered as  inferential 
evidence of Tsujimura’s guilt. Each of these reasons is independently sufficient to support the conclusion that the 
information elicited by the prosecutor violated Tsujimura’s 
right against compelled self-incrimination guaranteed by article  
I, section 10 of the Hawai i  Constitution.
25  
                                                        
  
 
  
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
that it suggested to the factfinder that Tsujimura’s prearrest 
silence may be considered as inferential evidence of Tsujimura’s 
guilt. And the district court accepted this suggestion.   In 
finding Tsujimura guilty, the district court expressly relied on Officer Billins’ testimony that when Tsujimura “alighted from 
the car, he did not indicate any difficulty walking.”   Thus, the 
court used Tsujimura’s prearrest silence at least in part to 
24  find him guilty of OVUII.
24 Although the district court judge in this case relied on evidence 
of prearrest silence in renderi ng his verdict, it is the State’s purpose for 
proffering the evidence (whether the State intended for the evidence to imply 
the defendant’s guilt) or the character of the evidence (whether it suggests 
to the factfinder that guilt may be inferred from prearrest silence) that is 
the pivotal consideration. 
25 It is noted that State v. Alo , 57 Haw. 418, 558 P.2d 1012 (1976), 
does not apply in this case. There, the defendant offered self -serving 
testimony as to statements he allegedly made to police after he was arrested 
and given 
Miranda warnings. Id. at 423, 558 P.2d at 1015.

  The concurring and dissenting opinion (dissent) 
proposes that “the Rodrigues  analysis requires courts to discern 
whether the State sought to imply a defendant’s guilt by virtue 
of the very fact that the defendant was silent.” Dissent at 4.   
According to the dissent, “the Rodrigues
 test requires courts to  
evaluate whether the Stat e elicited evidence of the defendant’s 
silence as direct evidence of the defendant’s culpability, or 
whether the State sought to legitimately illustrate other 
relevant facts by virtue of the defendant’s lack of verbal 
communication.” Dissent at 6.   Thus, the dissent posits  that 
Rodrigues does not preclude the State from using a defendant’s silence in order to imply  other facts that “identify [] the gaps  
in the defendant’s theory of the case or other exculpatory 
evidence that the defendant has adduced at tri al.” Dissent at 
4.  
   We respectfully disagree with the dissent because its 
approach would allow the State to use a defendant’s silence to 
indirectly imply or obtain evidence that bears upon the 
defendant’s guilt. Under the dissent’s view, a prosecutor’s 
comment would be improper only if it directly  suggested to the  
                                                                                                                                                                                   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

examination, the State asked questions intended to establish that the 
defendant was silent post -arrest and post -Miranda.  Id.
  at 421—32, 558 P.2d 
at 1014— 15.  This court held that the questions about defendant’s silence 
after his arrest were proper. Id.  at 425 —26, 558 P.2d at 1017. Thus, in 
Alo, this court allowed the State to use post -arrest, post -Miranda  silence in 
order to refute the defendant’s testimony regarding what he allegedly said to 
the police at the time of his arrest.

factfinder that the defendant is guilty because he or she 
remained silent in a situation wherein an innocent person would 
have spoken. In cases such as this one, the dissent’s approach 
would permit the State to indirectly  use the defendant’s 
prearrest silence to 
gain substantive evidence that bear s upon  
the defendant’s guilt. So long as the prosecutor’s comment only 
utilizes silence in order to obtain other evidence or establish  
inferences that can substantively  prove  the defendant’s guilt, 
the dissent’s interpretation of Rodrigues would permit the  
comment. 
   This could not be the case because direct and indirect 
use of a defendant’s silence has the same ultimate effect: it serves as a mechanism for the State to imply the defendant’s 
guilt. The only difference between the two is the level of 
blatancy. With indirect use, the State utilizes silence as the 
means to garner evidence or inferences that bear upon the 
defendant’s guilt. With direct use, the State employs silence as proof that the defendant is guilty for failing to speak. In 
short, the dissent’s framew ork would allow the State to do 
indirectly what the dissent concedes the State may not do directly. In this case, for example, the dissent’s framework 
deems the comment on  Tsujimura’s prearrest silence as 
constitutional because it illustrates “other relevant facts.”  Dissent at 6.  Those relevant facts, however, relate to the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
45
  
 
 
   Finally, the dissent’s framework is not supported by  
Rodrigues. Rodrigues  did not hold that indirect use of silence  
as substantive proof of guilt, a course of action authorized 
                                                        
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
determination of  Tsujimura’s guilt. Thus, the disse nt’s 
framework runs counter to  the rationale underlying the 
prohibition on  the use of prearrest silence as substantive proof 
26  of guilt.  See  supra.  Whether silence is used directly or 
indirectly, the person against whom the silence is used would be 
punished for exercising a constitutional right  in the same 
manner and to the same extent: under either instance, the 
person’s silence would ultimately bear upon the determination of 
his or her guilt.  This result is in direct contravention of 
this court’s precedents. See, e.g., State v. Wakisaka, 102 
Hawaii 504, 514 –15, 78 P.3d 317, 327 –28 (2003).  
26 The dissent elaborates on its approach by indicating that it 
allows silence to be used to “support a collateral fact other than the 
defendant’s guilt itself.”  Dissent at 11.  The dissent then characterizes a 
defendant’s physical state and state of mind as “collateral” facts that may 
be proved by relying at least in part on the defendant’s silence. Dissent at 
10. However, state of mind is an essential component of the State’s burden 
of proof in criminal cases. HRS § 702 –204 (1993).  And a defendant’s 
physical state is critical in offenses such as OVUII, see HRS § 291E- 61(a)(1) 
(Supp. 2014), whose proof most often relies on the manner in which certain 
physical acts are performed and on the physical manifestations of 
intoxication and impairment. To this extent, state of mind and physical state are hardly “collateral” or “ancillary.” Dissent at 9, 11. 
Even accepting the dissent’s framework --that silence may be used 
to establish collateral facts--Tsujimura’s silence cannot be said to have 
been used in this manner. Tsujimura’s silence was used to prove that his 
performance of the FSTs was not influenced by his injury but by an intoxicant, thereby supporting a finding of guilt.  Thus, the use of his 
silence was not simply geared toward establishing a collateral “fact that is 
separate and distinct” from evidence of Tsujimura’s guilt. Dissent at 10. 
46
  
 
 
  
  When  an error amounts to a violation of the privilege 
against compelled self-incrimination under article I, section 
10, the analysis proceeds to  whether the error was harmless 
beyond a reasonable doubt. See  State v. Mainaaupo , 117 Hawai i  
235, 247—48, 178 P.3d 1, 13  —14  (2008). “In applying the 
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard the court is 
required to examine the record and determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that the error complained of might have 
contributed to the conviction.”   State v. Balisbisana , 83 Hawai i  
109, 114, 924 P.2d 1215, 1220 (1996) (quoting State v. Holbron , 
80 Hawai i 27, 32, 904 P.2d 912, 917 (1995)) .   As discussed, the 
district court  rendered its verdict in partial reliance upon ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
under the dissent’s framework, is permissible. The information 
about the defendant’s silence in Rodrigues was not   intended or 
used to establish, directly or indirectly, the defendant’s guilt 
or innocence. See State v. Rodrigues , 113 Hawai i 41, 49 —50, 147 
P.3d 825, 833  –34 (2006) (explaining that the challenged line of  
 
inquiry “was unaccompanied by any  implication of guilt ” 
(emphasis added)).  Thus, the dissent’s framework, which would 
allow the indirect use of silence as a tool to elicit evidence 
or inferences that bear upon the defendant’s guilt (as the State 
did in this case), is not consistent with Rodrigues.

Officer Billins’ testimony that  Tsujimura did not say anything 
about his injury when he exited his car.  The district court 
also incorrectly assumed that it was proper for the State to use 
Tsujimura’s prearrest silence in order to imply that he was 
under an obligation to say something at the time of the stop  and 
that Tsujimura’s prearrest silence could be used as substantive proof of guilt.  In addition, looking at the evidentiary record  
at trial--including evidence countervailing a finding of 
intoxication--it cannot be said that the error in admitting 
Officer Billins’ testimony  regarding  Tsujimura’s prearrest 
27 silence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.   Id.   
Accordingly, Tsujimura’s conviction must be vacated and the case 
28remanded to the district court for a new trial.  
27 For purposes of the harmless error analysis, it is assumed that 
the evidence regarding Tsujimura’s performance of the FSTs was properly 
admitted, see supra note 6. 
28   Tsujimura also asserts that there was insufficient evidence to 
establish that he was impaired by “alcohol” because the State did not introduce evidence that he consumed alcohol derived from distillation.  The 
statutory definition of “alcohol,” as discussed supra  Part IV.A, is not 
limited to alcohol produced by distillation. Thus, the State was not 
required to introduce evidence as to the nature, origin, or the specific type 
of alcohol that Tsujimura consumed, and Tsujimura’s contention that there was 
insufficient evidence to establish his consumption of alcohol produced by 
distillation is without merit.  
Tsujimura additionally challenges the sufficiency of the evidence 
in support of his co
nviction.  Officer Billins testified regarding 
Tsujimura’s driving before he was stopped, delayed reaction after he was 
asked to pull over, his physical condition, and his actions while performing 
the FSTs. Even assuming that the district court improperly admitted 
testimony regarding whether Tsujimura passed or failed the FSTs, see supra 
note 6, the adduced evidence, viewed “in the light most favora ble to the 
State,” constitutes “substantial evidence to support the conclusion” that Tsujimura’s mental faculties or ability to care for himself and guard against

a violation of the constitutional right to testify is 
established, the conviction must be vacated unless the State can prove that the violation was harmless beyond a reasonable 
doubt.”); State v. Tabigne , 88 Hawai i 296, 306-07, 966 P.2d 608, 
618-19 (1998) (remanding the case for retrial after finding not 
harmless the constitutional error involved). 
The dissent contends that, “even assuming that the 
comment was an improper comment on Tsujimura’s silence, the 
comment was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” Dissent at 2. 
The dissent reasons that “the district court did not necessarily rely on Tsujimura’s silence in finding that ‘[w]hen he alighted 
from the car, he did not indicate any difficulty walking.’” 
Dissent at 14. According to the dissent, the district court’s 
statement--that Tsujimura did not indicate any difficulty 
walking when he alighted from the car--could have been based on 
Officer Billins’ observations, as gleaned from the officer’s 
testimony and the district court’s direct questions to the 
officer. Dissent at 14.

(1980)). Thus, Tsujimura’s conviction was supported by legally sufficient 
evidence.

  In asserting that the admission of Tsujimura’s 
prearrest silence into evidence was harmless, the dissent points 
to evidence other than Tsujimura’s prearrest silence that 
supports the district court’s finding of guilt . Dissent at 16— 
17.  However,  according to Officer Billins’ testimony,  
Tsujimura’s vehicle  was not changing lanes, was not going over 
the speed limit, was not slowing down or speeding up, did not 
follow other vehicles too closely, and did not make any ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Tsujimura’s failure to speak about any difficulty walking as he 
was exiting his car  and during his interaction with Officer 
Billins.   The sentence immediately prior to the district court’s 
statement was, “When Mr. Tsujimura was asked to participate [by 
Officer Billins] in a field sobriety test, Mr. Tsujimura did 
indicate . . . there was an injury to his left leg.” Thus, the 
court’s use of “indicate” in all likelihood  pertained to  
Tsujimura’s oral responses or lack of responses to Officer Billins during their interaction.   In any event, the alternative 
explanation that the dissent posits for the district court’s 
statement does not eliminate the  reasonable possibility  that  the 
district court relied on Officer Billins’ reference to Tsujimura’s prearrest silence and, as such, the reasonable 
possibility that this error might have contributed to 
Tsujimura’s conviction.

  Accordingly, we hold that the right to remain silent 
under article I, section 10  of the Hawai i Constitution attaches  
at least at the point at which a person has been seized   .  Such 
evidence regarding a person’s exercise of the right to remain ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
inconsistent signals; it took Tsujimura only eight seconds to 
pull over from the time Officer Billins  turned on his sirens and 
lights; and out of the 24   NHTSA  visual detection clues, 
Tsujimura exhibited only one--trouble maintaining lane position.   
Officer Billins’ testimony also indicated that Tsujimura did not 
repeat questions or comments, lean on his vehicle, or provide 
incorrect information or change his answers  while being 
questioned; red, watery eyes could be  caused by a number of 
factors other than alcohol impairment; and odor of alcohol is a  
poor indicator of a person’s level of impairment and has no 
bearing on the amount and nature of the alcohol that the person 
consumed. Accordingly, the totality of the evidence against 
Tsujimura was  far from compelling or overwhelming  as to render  
harmless any error in admitting the State’s comment on 
Tsujimura’s prearrest silence.  See Mainaaupo , 117 Hawai i at   
255, 178 P.3d at  21 (concluding that “the evidence . . . is not 
so overwhelming that we are convinced that the [deputy 
prosecuting attorney’]s intrusion into [the defendant’]s right 
to remain silent may not have contributed to his conviction”).

silent may not be used as substantive evidence of guilt. 
Relatedly, the State may not elicit evidence of prearrest 
silence to imply the defendant’s guilt or introduce evidence 
whose character suggests to the factfinder that the defendant’s 
prearrest silence is infer ential evidence of the defendant’s 
guilt. In this case, Tsujimura’s prearrest silence while 
detained during an investigatory stop was introduced into 
evidence as substantive proof of Tsujimura’s guilt. The 
admission of this evidence was not harmless.  Hence, the ICA 
Judgment on Appeal and the district court’s judgment are 
vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court for a new trial.
