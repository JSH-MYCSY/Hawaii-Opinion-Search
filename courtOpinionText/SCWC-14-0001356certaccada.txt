CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(CAAP-14-0001356; CIV. NO. 13-1-0152)
 
ORDER ACCEPTING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI,
VACATING ICA ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION,
AND REMANDING APPEAL TO ICA
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
Petitioner/defendant-appellee Michael Jean Panzo filed 
a timely application for writ of certiorari on August 10, 2015 to 
review the intermediate court of appeals’ (“ICA”) June 10, 2015 
order dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Petitioner 
has asserted an appeal from the circuit court’s November 3, 2014 
minute order on his post-judgment motion for relief from the 
judgment on a decree of foreclosure that was filed pursuant to 
Rule 60(b) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (“HRCP”). 
Upon review of the record and filings in the appeal, it appears that the circuit court’s “Order Denying Defendant Michael Jean Panzo’s Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief from Judgment and for 
Evidentiary Hearing Filed September 18, 2014,” which was filed on 
January 20, 2015, was filed prior to the record on appeal being 
transmitted to the ICA but was omitted from the record on appeal 
that was transmitted to the ICA. Once the circuit court entered 
the January 20, 2015 written order, the prematurely filed notice 
of appeal vested the ICA with jurisdiction over the appeal. See 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(2); Shimabuku v. Montgomery Elevator Co., 79 Hawai'i 352, 903 P.2d 48 (1995) (a premature notice of appeal 
from the court’s announcement of a final and appealable order denying intervention was deemed timely upon court’s entry of that 
order); Makaneole v. Pacific Ins. Co., 77 Hawai' i 417, 886 P.2d 
754 (1994) (a premature notice of appeal from the court’s announcement of a final order granting summary judgment deemed 
timely upon the court’s entry of the order). The notice of 
appeal is therefore no longer premature, and the ICA has 
jurisdiction to consider the appeal. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Petitioner’s application for
 
writ of certiorari is accepted. The ICA’s June 10, 2015 order
 
dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction is vacated. 
Petitioner’s appeal is remanded to the ICA for briefing and
 
disposition.
 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk of the
 
first circuit court shall file in the ICA, within twenty (20)
 
days from the date of this order, a supplemental record on appeal
 
that includes the “Order Denying Defendant Michael Jean Panzo’s
 
Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief from Judgment and for Evidentiary
 
Hearing Filed September 18, 2014,” filed on January 20, 2015.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, September 17, 2015.
