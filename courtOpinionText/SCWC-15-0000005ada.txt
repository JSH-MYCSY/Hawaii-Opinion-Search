I.  Introduction 
 This case returns to us after it was remanded to the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) by our February 28, 2017

 390 P.3d 1248 (2017) (“ Reyes-Toledo I ”).  In Reyes- Toledo I , we 
vacated a foreclosure decree based on issues of fact regarding 
whether Bank of America, N.A., a National Association, as 
successor by merger to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP FKA 
Countrywide Home Loans Servicing LP (“Bank of America”)  held the 
note at the time the foreclosure lawsuit was filed.  See 139 
Hawaiʻi at 373, 390 P.3d at 1260.    
 Relevant to this certiorari proceeding, Reyes-Toledo I  
remanded the case to the ICA for a determination of whether the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (“circuit court”)1 erred by 
dismissing Grisel Reyes- Toledo’s (“Homeowner[’s] ”) four-count 
counterclaim before granting summary judgment for foreclosure in 
favor of Bank of America.  See 139 Hawai ʻi at 373, 390 P.3d at 
1260.  On remand, the ICA ruled the circuit court properly 
dismissed the wrongful foreclosure, declaratory relief, and 
quiet title counts in Homeowner’s coun terclaim , but that it 
erred in dismissing the unfair and deceptive trade practices 
count.  See Bank of America, N.A., Successor v. Reyes-Toledo , 
No. CAAP-15-0000005 (App. July 21, 2017) (SDO).    
In sum, the ICA concluded the three counts were 
appropriately dismissed pursuant to  Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil 
Procedure (“HRCP”) Rule 12(b)(6)  because: (1) as Homeowner did 
                                                           
1   The Honorable Bert I. Ayabe presided.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 not provide any authority to support “the proposition that a 
wrongful foreclosure claim can be raised prior to foreclosure or 
the sale of the property in judicial foreclosure,” no set of 
facts would entitle Homeowner to relief, Reyes-Toledo, SDO at 6; 
(2) the face of the Mortgage listed MERS as “mortgagee” and 
“nominee,” and as such, 
Homeowner’s arguments in suppor t of her 
allegations that “MERS was nothing more than a strawman and a 
conduit for fraud being practiced upon the Defendant and others” 
lacked merit, Reyes
-Toledo, SDO at 7; and (3) Homeowner’s quiet 
title count does not allege that she paid, or was able to pay, 
the outstanding debt on the Property “so as to demonstrate the 
superiority of her claim,” Reyes-Toledo, SDO at 9.  In so 
concluding, the ICA applied the “plausibility” pleading standard 
set forth in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 
(2007), which it had previously adopted in Pavsek v. Sandvold , 
127 Hawaiʻ i 390, 279 P.3d 55 (App. 2012).  See Reyes-Toledo , SDO 
at 2–4; see also Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 677 –80 (2009) 
(clarifying Twombly ).  
 Homeowner timely filed an application for writ of 
certiorari (“Application”), asserting the ICA erred in upholding 
the dismissal of the other three counts as it applied the wrong ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 pleading standard.2  According to Homeowner, these three counts 
should have survived dismissal because when a party  moves to 
dismiss a complaint pursuant to Hawai ʻi Rules of Civil Procedure 
(“HRCP”) Rule 12(b)(6), the party admits the well -pleaded 
allegations of fact.    
 This appeal  raises two issues: (1) the standard a pleading3 
must meet to overcome a HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss; 
and (2) whether a claim for wrongful foreclosure exists under 
Hawaiʻi law.    
 As to the first issue, this court has never adopted the 
Twombly/Iqbal “plausibility” pleading standard , and we now 
expressly reject it.  We reaffirm that in Hawai ʻi state courts, 
the traditional “notice ” pleading standard governs.  This 
provides citizen access to the courts and to justice.   
 As to the second issue, we 
hold that a party may bring a 
claim for wrongful foreclosure before the foreclosure actually 
occurs.  
 We therefore vacate the ICA’s judgment on appeal affirming 
the circuit court’s dismiss al of three counts of Homeowner’s 
                                                           
2   Bank of America did not apply for certiorari with respect to the ICA’s 
reinstatement of the unfair and deceptive trade acts and practices count, so 
that issue is not before us.  
 
3  Pursuant to HRCP Rule 8(a), a “pleading” “sets forth a claim for 
relief, whether an original claim, counterclaim, cross -claim, or third -party 
claim[.]”

 counterclaim, and remand the case to the circuit court for 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion as well as our 
opinion in Reyes-Toledo I . 
II.  Background 
 Only t he factual and procedural backgrounds relevant to the 
issues on certiorari are discussed below.4    
A.  Homeowner’s Answer  and Counterclaim 
 In response to Bank of America’s complaint  seeking 
foreclosure (“Complaint”)  of Homeowner’s property (“Property”) , 
Homeowner filed her Answer and Counterclaim on September 28, 
2012, denying all  of the allegations in the Complaint, except 
those pertaining to her personal background, her September 24, 
2007 execution of a promissory note made payable to Countrywide 
Bank, FSB (“Note”), and the recordation of a 
mortgage on the 
Property that secured the Note (“Mortgage”) .  She also asserted 
the following defenses in her Answer : (1) failure to state a 
claim upon which relief can be granted, (2) assumption of risk 
and contributory negligence,
 (3) fraud, based on  Homeowner ’s 
reasonable belief that Bank of America was not the real party-
in-interest and owner of the Note and Mortgage through any 
claimed assignment by Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, 
Inc. (“MERS”),  and (4) illegality,  insofar as Bank of America 
                                                           
4  See Reyes-Toledo I  for further details not relevant to the issues on 
certiorari. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
6 
 was not the owner and holder of the Note and Mortgage and 
therefore not entitled to foreclose on the Mortgage.  She also 
contended that there was no valid interim assignment of the 
Mortgage to Bank of America and no valid negotiation for value 
of the Note to Bank of America.  She further  asserted MERS could 
not be a lawful beneficiary of the Mortgage if it lacked 
possession of the Note.   
 Homeowner also asserted the following defenses in the event 
the Note and Mortgage had been  transferred  into a trust and 
securitized: (1) the claimed assignment of the Note and Mortgage 
into the trust may have violated the ninety- day closing date; 
(2) the claimed Mortgage assignment to Bank of America in 
October 2011 would be void as a violation of the express terms 
of the trust; (3) the purported assignment by which Bank of 
America claimed ownership of the Note and Mortgage may violate 
the trust provision
s for the closing -date rule; (4) the 
purported transfers or assignments of the Mortgage after the 
closing date of the trust would be void in violation of the 
express terms of the trust and 26 U.S.C. §  860 et seq.; (5) the 
purported transfers may violate New York trust law and would 
therefore be void; (6) the Note may never have been transferred 
into the trust; (7) MERS was not a lender, banker, or servicer 
and therefore any transfers by MERS were void; (8) the purported 
transfers into and out of the trust violated the Internal ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
7 
 Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. §  860; (9) the claimed assignments in to 
and out of the trust may have violated the Pooling and Service 
Agreement (“PSA”) , together with the Underwriting Agreement for 
the trust; (10) if there were transfers into a trust under the 
PSA, the transfers were not performed according to the terms of 
the trust and were therefore void; (11) the Note and Mortgage 
may never have been deposited or transferred into the trust; and 
(12) if the transfers were made into and out of a securitized 
trust, the signatures may have been by unauthorized persons and 
therefore void as forgeries, which would render the purported 
transfers fraudulent and void.   
 
Homeowner asserted four counts in the counterclaim filed 
along with her Answer: (1) wrongful foreclosure; (2) declaratory 
relief; (3) quiet tit
le; and (4) unfair and deceptive trade acts 
and practices (sometimes “ UDAP”) under HRS §  480-1 et seq.   
 
 In the first count of her counterclaim, alleging wrongful 
foreclosure, Homeowner incorporated by reference the defenses in 
her Answer, and alleged that Bank of America’s conduct in 
commencing the foreclosure action was willful, malicious, and 
without just cause.   
 In the second count of her counterclaim, seeking 
declaratory relief, Homeowner incorporated by reference the 
allegations in the wrongful foreclosure count.  She asserted she 
was entitled to declaratory relief pursuant to HRS § 632-1 that  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
8 
 (1) Bank of America was not the owner of the Mortgage and Note; 
(2) Bank of America was not entitled to foreclose on the 
Mortgage and Note;
 and (3) MERS was not the mortgagee on the 
Mortgage but rather was a “sham and fraud” that “acted only as a 
strawman.”   She also requested that  the court determine the 
identity of the mortgagee and award her costs and attorney’s 
fees pursuant to HRS §  607-14.   
 
In the third count of her counterclaim, requesting the 
quieting of her title, Homeowner again incorporated by reference 
the allegations in the  wrongful foreclosure count.  She asserted 
she was entitled to have her legal title to the Property quieted 
against Bank of America’s claims pursuant to HRS § 669-1 et 
seq., and that she was entitled to recover her costs and  
attorney’s fees pursuant to HRS  § 607-14.   
 Finally, in  the fourth count of her counterclaim, alleging 
unfair and deceptive trade acts and practices, Homeowner again 
incorporated by reference the allegations in the  wrongful 
foreclosure count.  She alleged she was a consumer with respect 
to the Mortgage and Note, and she asserted the acts and conduct 
of Bank of America, its agents and predecessors, and MERS 
constituted an unfair and deceptive trade practice by  “either or 
both mortgage lenders, mortgage servicers, mortgage holders, 
claimants, debt collectors, and/or finance companies. ”  
Homeowner claimed she paid about $55,593 to Bank of America ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
9 
 based on erroneous information and billings, and on the 
assumption that Bank of America was the rightful owner of the 
Mortgage.  She maintained Bank of America and MERS were 
therefore subject to liability under HRS §§  480-2 and 480- 13 for 
injuries and damages of not less than $1,000, or for treble 
damages, plus attorney’s fees  and costs.  Additionally, 
Homeowner asserted she was entitled to injunctive relief to 
enjoin the unlawful practices of Bank of America, its agents and 
predecessors, and MERS.   
B.  Motion to Dismiss Counterclaim  
 On October 22, 2012, Bank of America filed a Motion to 
Dismiss Defendant Grisel Reyes- Toledo’s Counterclaim  (“Motion to 
Dismiss Counterclaim”) .  As to the wrongful foreclosure count, 
Bank of America asserted Homeowner did not describe any 
foreclosure that had actually occurred or what was wrongful 
about the alleged foreclosure, and that therefore the count 
should be dismissed.   As to the declaratory judgment count, Bank 
of America alleged the involvement of MERS in loan transactions  
has been repeatedly approved by this court and that there was no 
allegation that MERS exceeded its traditionally approved role in 
Homeowner’s case.    
As to the quiet title count, Bank of America alleged that 
Homeowner failed to state a claim because she did not  assert she 
had fully paid off the underlying obligation or is able to ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
10 
 tender the full amount before seeking relief.   Finally, Bank of 
America asserted that although the unfair and deceptive trade 
acts and practices count incorporated by reference the 
allegations in the wrongful foreclosure count, Homeowner did not 
describe the alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices in 
any detail.   
 In her Memorandum in Opposition to Bank of America’s Motion 
to Dismiss Counterclaim, 
Homeowner argued that all counts of her 
counterclaim, including the wrongful foreclosure count, were 
sufficient to survive a HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.  
She argued if she were to prove the facts alleged in her 
counterclaim, which incorporated the allegations in her Answer, 
she would be entitled to relief against Bank of America.  
Homeowner also asserted that  Bain v. Metro Mort
gage Group, Inc. , 
285 P.3d 34 (Wash. 2012) supports her claim  that MERS is merely 
a registration system and not a holder of the Note.  
Additionally, Homeowner maintained sufficient facts were pled 
for both the declaratory judgment and quiet title counts 
pursuant to Amina v. Bank of New York Mellon , Civil No. 11 –00714 
JMS/BMK, 2012 WL 3283513 (D. Haw. 2012), in which the court held
that a borrower need not tender payment or allege that a note  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
11 
 and mortgage were satisfied  to quiet title against a party who 
is not a mortgagee.5   
 In its Reply Memorandum, Bank of America asserted that if 
Homeowner believed Bank of America
 lacked authority to 
foreclose, then her arguments were defenses, not affirmative 
claims for relief.  Bank of America also asserted that a claim 
for wrongful foreclosure c annot arise before a  foreclosure  
occurs.  Bank of America alleged that to the extent Homeowner’s  
other counts relied upon allegations set forth in the wrongful 
foreclosure count, they should also be dismissed.    
 On February 12, 2013, the circuit court enter ed an order 
granting Bank of America’s Motion to D ismiss Counterclaim 
(“Order Dismissing Counterclaim”) .  Homeowner filed a motion for 
reconsideration contending she had sufficiently pled her 
“compulsory” counterclaim as  Bank of America was not the 
mortgagee, had no right to bring a foreclosure action, and was 
liable to her for over $160,000 based on her  UDAP counterclaim.  
In the alternative, she moved for entry of final judgment and a 
HRCP Rule 54(b) certification allowing immediate appeal of the 
order Dismissing Counterclaim.  She also requested a stay 
pending appeal pursuant to HRCP Rule 62(d) and (h). 
 After Bank of America filed its opposition, 
                                                           
5  The UDAP count was reinstated by the ICA and is not before us on 
certiorari. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
12 
 on December 31, 2013, the circuit court denied Homeowner ’s 
Motion for Reconsideration and Rule 54(b) Certification ( “Order 
Denying Defendant Grisel Reyes-Toledo’s  Motion for  (1) 
Reconsideration of the February 12, 2013 Order Dismissing 
Counterclaim; (2) HRCP Rule 54(b) Certification; and (3) HRCP 
Rule 62(d) and (h) Stay Pending Appeal Filed on February 22, 
2013”) (“Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration”) .6  
C.  ICA’s Decision on Remand  
 Addressing the propriety of the dismissal of Homeowner ’s 
counterclaim for the first time on remand from Reyes-Toledo I , 
the ICA affirmed in part and vacated in part the circuit court’s 
Order Dismissing Counterclaim, entering its summary disposition 
order 
(“SDO”) on July 21, 2017.  See Reyes-Toledo, SDO at 12.  
The ICA applied the following standard to evaluate Bank of 
America’s  HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss:   
                                                           
6  The circuit court subsequently granted Bank of America’s motion for 
summary judgment through its December 9, 2014 “Findings of Fact, Conclusions 
of Law, Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment Against All 
Parties and Interlocutory Decree of Foreclosure Filed April 4, 2014” 
(“Foreclosure Decree”) , and entered a separate foreclosure judgment.  In the 
first appeal, Homeowner  appealed this judgment.  In a summary disposition 
order, the ICA affirmed.  As noted, on certiorari  in Reyes- Toledo I , we held: 
(1) genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether Bank of America  was 
entitled to enforce the Note at the time it commenced the foreclosure 
proceedings, precluding summary judgment as to Bank of America’s standing to 
institute the proceedings; (2) the assignment of the Mortgage was 
insufficient to establish Bank of America’s standing to institute foreclosure 
proceedings; and (3) the foreclosure judgment was a final appealable 
judgment, and thus the ICA had appellate jurisdiction over the Order 
Dismissing Counterclaim .   We vacated the ICA’s April 13, 2016 Judgment on 
Appeal and the Foreclosure Decree to the extent it granted summary judgment 
in favor of Bank of America.   We also remanded the case to the ICA to 
determine whether the circuit court erred in dismissing Homeowner’s 
counterclaim
. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 A complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a 
claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can 
prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that 
would entitle him or her to relief.  We must therefore view 
a plaintiff ’s complaint in a light most favorable to him or 
her in order to determine whether the allegations contained 
therein could warrant relief under any alternative theory.  
For this reason, in reviewing a circuit court ’s order 
dismissing a complaint our consideration is strictly 
limited to the allegations of the complaint, and we must 
deem those allegations to be true.  
 
Reyes-Toledo, SDO at 3 (quoting In Re Estate of Rogers , 103 
Hawaiʻi 275, 280 –81, 81 P.3d 1190, 1195 –96 (2003) ).  The ICA went 
on, however, to quote an excerpt from Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, 
which the ICA previously quoted in Pavsek , 127 Hawai ʻi 390, 279 
P.3d 55 (App. 2012): 
While a complaint attacked by [a HRCP] Rule 12(b)(6) motion 
to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a 
plaintiff’ s obligation to provide the “grounds”  of his 
“entitlement to relief ” requires more than labels and 
conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of 
a cause of action will not do. Factual allegations must be 
enough to raise a right to relief above  the speculative 
level on the assumption that all of the complaint ’s 
allegations are true (even if doubtful in fact).  
 
Reyes-Toledo, SDO at 4 (quoting Pavsek, 127 Hawai ʻi at 403, 279 
P.3d at 68).  
 
Based on these standard s, the ICA concluded the circuit 
court did not err in dismissing three of the four counts of 
Homeowner’s counterclaim.  
First, with respect to the wrongful foreclosure count,  the 
ICA noted that although Homeowner alleged Bank of America’s 
conduct in commencing the foreclosure was “willful, malicious, 
and without just cause, ” she failed to identify any other ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
14 
 specific acts that would make the foreclosure wrongful.  Reyes-
Toledo, SDO at 4.  Further, the ICA  opined that Homeowner failed 
to provide any authority to support her proposition that a 
wrongful foreclosure claim can be asserted before the 
foreclosure or sale of the property in a judicial foreclosure.  
See Reyes-Toledo, SDO at 6.  According to the ICA’s analysis,  
only non-judicial wrongful foreclosure has been recognized in 
Hawaiʻi, and other jurisdictions have held a wrongful foreclosure 
claim does not arise until after the foreclosure occurs.  See 
Reyes-Toledo, SDO at 4– 5 (citing Santiago v. Tanaka , 137 Hawai ʻi 
137, 366 P.3d 612 (2016); Cervantes v. Countrywide Home Loans,  
Inc., 656 F.3d 1034 (9th Cir. 2011)).  As this case involved a 
pending judicial foreclosure and Homeowner asserted her wrongful 
foreclosure claim before any foreclosure or sale occurred, the 
ICA concluded Homeowner could not prove a set of facts that 
would entitle her to relief on the wrongful foreclosure count.  
See Reyes-Toledo, SDO at 6. 
 Second, t he ICA also concluded the circuit court did not 
err in dismissing the declaratory judgment count .  See Reyes-
Toledo, SDO at 7– 8.  The ICA disagreed with Homeowner’s argument 
that pursuant to Bain , 285 P.3d 34, she was entitled to 
declaratory relief under HRS § 632- 1, ruling  that Bain  was 
distinguishable as explained in its prior decision in Bank of 
America, N.A. v. Hermano , No. CAAP  13-0006069, at 6- 7 (App. June ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
15 
 22, 2016) (SDO), cert. denied , No. SCWC- 13-0006069 (Sept. 22, 
2016): 
Bain was decided in the context of a non -judicial deed -of-
trust foreclosure, whereas the instant case is a judicial 
foreclosure of a mortgage.  Thus, the procedures and law in 
Bain appear to be inapplicable here.  The Bain decision was 
limited to whether MERS is a “beneficiary” under the 
language of Washington ’s Deed of Trust Act, thus the 
analysis is different.  In addition, Bain is a Washington 
State case; upon review, we are not inclined to depart from 
the Hawaiʻ i cases that have consistently recognized the 
validity of assignments of mortgages by MERS where lenders 
granted to MERS, as nominee for lenders and lenders’  
successors and assigns, the right to exercise all of those 
interests granted by a borrower, including the right to 
foreclose and sell a property  and to take any action 
required of a lender.  
 
Reyes-Toledo, SDO at 7 (quoting Hermano , SDO at 6 –7) (citations 
omitted).  Here, MERS was listed in the Mortgage as “mortgagee” 
and “nominee,” and the Mortgage’s terms granted MERS the right 
to “exercise any or all of those interests, including, but not 
limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property;  and to 
take any action required of Lender including, but not limited 
to, releasing and canceling this Security Instrumen t.”  Id.  
Thus, the ICA concluded Homeowner’s argument was without merit 
and the circuit court did not err in dismissing this count.  See 
Reyes-Toledo, SDO at 7 –8. 
 Third , the ICA concluded the circuit court did not err in 
dismissing Homeowner’s quiet title count.   See Reyes-Toledo, SDO 
at 9.  The ICA reasoned that as with the counterclaimant in 
Hermano, Homeowner’s reliance on Amina, Civil No. 11 –00714 
JMS/BMK, 2012 WL 3283513, to support her argument that a ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
16 
 “borrower does not need to tender payment to allege that the 
promissory note and the mortgage were paid where the borrower 
brings a quiet title action against a party, who, according to 
the complaint, is not a mortgagee ,” was misplaced.   Id.  To the 
ICA, Amina provided a significant clarification: 
To be clear . . . this is not a case where Plaintiffs 
assert that Defendant’ s mortgagee status is invalid (for 
example, because the mortgage loan was securitized or 
because Defendant does not hold the note).  On their own, 
such allegations would be insufficient to assert a quiet 
title claim -they admit that a defendant is a mortgagee and 
attack the weakness of the mortgagee’ s claim to the 
property without establishing the strength and superiority 
of the borrower’ s claim (by asserting an ability to 
tender).  
 
Id. (quoting Amina , 2012 WL 3283513, at *5).  
 The ICA concluded  each of Homeowner ’s arguments  — that Bank 
of America’s mortgagee status was invalid, the mortgage loan was 
securitized, and Bank of America  did not possess the Note — were 
“specifically distinguished” in Amina.  See id.  The ICA 
concluded the quiet title count the refore failed because 
Homeowner did not “demonstrate the superiority of her claim” as 
she did not allege she paid, or was able to pay, the outstanding 
debt on the Property.  Id. 
 As to Homeowner’s UDAP claim raised in the  fourth and final 
count of her counterclaim, however, the ICA concluded that 
because of this court’s  decisions in Santiago, 137 Hawai ʻi 137, 
366 P.3d 612, Hungate v. Law Office of David B. Rosen , 139 
Hawaiʻi 394, 391 P.3d 1 (2017), and Reyes-Toledo I , the circuit ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
17 
 court erred in dismissing the UDAP  counterclaim.  See Reyes-
Toledo, SDO at 10 –11.   
 Finally, the ICA also concluded Homeowner  was not entitled 
to any further relief based on her request for reconsideration 
of the circuit court’s dismissal of her counterclaim.   See 
Reyes-Toledo,  SDO at 11 –12.  The ICA reasoned she failed to 
present any new evidence or arguments in conjunction with her 
motion for reconsideration that could not have been presented 
during the earlier adjudicated motion to dismiss.  See id. 
 The ICA thus affirmed in part and vacated in part the 
circuit court’s Order Dismiss ing Counterclaim, and remanded to 
the circuit court for further proceedings.  See Reyes-Toledo, 
SDO at 12.  The ICA entered its Judgment on Appeal on October 5, 
2017.  
D.  Application for Writ of Certiorari  
 Homeowner timely applied for a writ of certiorari 
(“Application”) from the October 5, 2017 Judgment entered by the 
ICA pursuant to its July 21 , 2017 S DO, essentially arguing the 
three remaining counts of her counterclaim should not have been 
dismissed pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(b)(6).  Bank of America filed 
a response on November 2, 2017.  
III.  Standard of Review  
 A circuit court’ s ruling on a motion to dismiss is reviewed 
de novo.  See Hungate, 139 Hawai ʻi at 401, 391 P.3d at  8 (quoting ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel , 117 Hawaiʻi 92, 104,  
176 P.3d 91, 103 (2008), as amended  (Jan. 25, 2008 & Feb. 14, 
2008)).  Moreover, “[w]hen interpreting rules promulgated by the 
court, principles of statutory construction apply.  
Interpretation of a statute is a question of law which we re
view 
de novo.”  Ranger Ins. Co. v. Hinshaw , 103 Hawaiʻ i 26, 30, 79 
P.3d 119, 123 (2003) (quoting Molinar v. Schweizer , 95 Hawai ʻi 
331, 334-35, 22 P.3d 978, 981-82 (2001) (citations and quotation 
marks omitted)).  Therefore, we also interpret the HRCP de novo.  
See Sierra Club v. Dep’t of Transp. of State of Hawai ʻi, 120 
Hawaiʻi 181, 197, 202 P.3d 1226, 1242 (2009) (citing Molinar, 95 
Hawaiʻi at 335, 22 P.3d at 982 ). 
It is further well  established that: 
a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a 
claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can 
prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim that 
would entitle him or her to relief.  The appellate court  
must therefore view a plaintiff ’s complaint in a light most 
favorable to him or her in order to determine whether the 
allegations contained therein could warrant relief under 
any alternative theory.  For this reason, in reviewing a  
circuit court ’s order dismissing a complaint . . . the 
appellate court ’s consideration is strictly limited to the 
allegations of the complaint, and the appellate court  must 
deem those allegations to be true.

IV.  Discussion 
We accepted certiorari to address two issues: (1) the 
clarification of the proper standard for a HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
19 
 motion to dismiss, and (2) whether a wrongful foreclosure claim 
exists in Hawaiʻ i.  We discuss  them in turn. 
A.  HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) Standard  
The first issue requires us to review the “plausibility” 
pleading standard the ICA applied in affirming the dismissal of 
three counts of Homeowner’s counterclaim  pursuant to HRCP Rule 
12(b)(6), which mirrors Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
(“FRCP”) Rule 12(b)(6).   See Reyes- Toledo, SDO at 4.  The ICA 
adopted this standard in Pavsek v. Sandvold , 127 Hawaiʻ i 390, 2 79 
P.3d 55 (App. 2012),  citing to the United States Supreme Court’s 
adoption of the standard in Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, and Iqbal, 
556 U.S. 662: 
While a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to 
dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a 
plaintiff’s obligation to provide the “grounds” of his 
“entitlement to relief” requires more than labels and 
conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of 
a cause of action will not do.  Factual allegations must be 
enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative 
level on the assumption that all of the complaint ’s 
allegations are true (even if doubtful in fact).  
 
Pavsek, 127 Hawaiʻ i at 403, 279 P.3d at 68 (quoting Twombly, 550 
U.S. at 555).   
Prior to Twombly  and Iqbal, the “notice pleading” standard 
was applied in federal courts to determine whether a pleading 
can be dismissed for “failure to state a claim upon wh ich relief 
can be granted” under FRCP Rule 12(b)(6).  It is also the 
standard this court has expressly adopted.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
20 
 Although the “plausibility ” pleading standard has not been 
adopted by this court,7 the ICA has nevertheless relied on it  in 
evaluating HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss filed in 
unpublished cases subsequent to Pavsek .  See, e.g., Bank of New  
York Mellon v. Mazerik , No. CAAP -14-0001100, at 5 (App. Nov. 16,  
2016) (SDO), cert. denied , No. SCWC -14-0001100 ( Feb 24, 2017); 
Abordo v. Dep’t of Pub. Safety, No. CAAP- 13-0005534, at 4 (SDO) 
(App. Feb 26, 2016); Klausmeyer -Among v. Honolulu City Council , 
No. CAAP-13-00001184, at 3 (App. Nov. 29, 2013) (mem.) , cert. 
denied, No. SCWC-13-0000184 (Apr. 9, 2014); Hermano, SDO at 3.  
Thus, to answer whether the ICA erred in affirming the circuit 
court’s dismissal of three counts of Homeowner’s counterclaim 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(b)(6), we must determine whether our 
traditional “notice pleading ” standard or the “plausibility” 
standard cited in Pavsek governs .  The answer turns on the 
proper interpretation of HRCP Rule 8(a).  
We begin with the plain language of HRCP Rule 8(a).  HRCP 
Rule 8(a) states, in relevant part, that “a pleading which sets 
forth a claim for relief, whether an original claim, 
                                                           
7  We cited to Pavsek  in Hungate v. Rosen , 139 Hawai ʻi 394, 401, 391 P.3d 
1, 8 (2017), and Kealoha v. Machado , 131 Hawai ʻi 62, 74, 315 P.3d 213, 225 
(2013), not with respect to the “plausibility” pleading standard, but with 
respect to the proposition that “in weighing the allegations of [a pleading] 
as against a motion to dismiss, the court is not required to accept 
conclusory allegations on the legal effect o f the events alleged.”  Pavsek  
cited to Marsland v. Pang , 5 Haw. App. 463, 474, 701 P.2d 175, 186 (1985) , 
for that proposition, which, in turn, cited to 5 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur 
R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure: Civil  § 1357 (1969).  This legal 
proposition is not at issue in this case.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
21 
 counterclaim, cross- claim, or third -party claim, shall contain 
(1) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the 
pleader is entitled to relief, and (2) a demand for judgment for 
the relief the pleader seeks.”  Since being promulgated and 
adopted in 1953,8 we have amended HRCP Rule 8(a) only once, which 
was to change gendered terms.  See Order Amending the Hawai ʻi 
Rules of Civil Procedure (Dec. 7, 1999) (eff. Jan. 1, 2000).  
Noticeably absent from Rule 8(a) is any mention of requiring 
“plausibility”  of factual allegations, or that such allegations 
be “enough,” or some variation of those terms.  
We first interpreted HRCP Rule 8(a) in Hall v. Kim , 53 Haw. 
215, 491 P.2d 541 (1971), where we explained the principles 
underlying the rule and motions to dismiss:  
 H.R.C.P., Rule 8(a)(1) provides that a pleading for 
claim of relief shall contain ‘a short and plain statement 
of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to 
relief.’ 
 It is also to be noted that Rule 8(f) reads: ‘All 
pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial 
justice.’ 
 
. . . . 
 
 We believe that the mandate of H.R.C.P. Rule 8(f) 
that ‘all pleadings shall be so construed as to do 
substantial justice’ epitomizes the general principle 
underlying all rules of H.R.C.P. governing pleadings, and 
by the adoption of H.R.C.P. we have rejected ‘the approach 
that pleading is a game of skill in which one misstep by 
counsel may be decisive to the outcome’ and in turn 
accepted ‘the principle that the purpose of pleading is to 
facilitate a proper decision on the merits.’  
 
 Accordingly, under Rule 8(a)(1) ‘a complaint is 
sufficient if it sets forth ‘a short and plain statement of 
                                                           
8  See Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure (adopted & promulgated by the 
Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawai ʻi, Dec. 7, 1953) (eff. June 14, 1954).   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
22 
 the claim showing that the plead er is entitled to relief.’ 
. . .  The rule is satisfied if the statement gives the 
defendant fair notice of the claim and the ground upon 
which it rests. . . .   It is not necessary to plead under 
what particular law the recovery is sought. ’ . . . 
 
. . . . 
 
 ‘In appraising the sufficiency of the complaint we 
follow, of course, the accepted rule that a complaint 
should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless 
it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set 
of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to 
relief.’ . . .  Though it may be improbable for the  
plaintiffs to prove their  claims, they are entitled to an 
opportunity to make that attempt.  It is not for a court to 
circumvent a determination of an action upon the merits of 
the case by accepting an assertion that the claim asserted 
in the complaint is groundless. 
 
Hall, 53 Haw. at 219-22, 491 P.2d at 544-46 (citations omitted).   
In other words, “[HRCP] Rule 8(a)(1) does not require the 
pleading of facts; it requires a complaint to set forth ‘a short 
and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is 
entitled to relief.’”   Hall, 53 Haw. at 220, 491 P.2d at 545 
(citations omitted)).   Thus, we held whether a pleading states 
evidence, facts, or conclusions of law was not dispositive.  See 
id. 
 We held to these principles in subsequent cases.  See, 
e.g., Au v. Au, 63 Haw. 210, 221, 626 P.2d 173, 181 (per 
curiam), recon. denied , 63 Haw. 263, 626 P.2d 173 (1981) (“ Thus, 
Rule 8(a) H.R.C.P., requires a complaint to set forth a ‘short 
and plain statement of the claim. . . .’  This requirement under 
our pleading system provides defendant with fair notice of what 
the plaintiff’s claim is and the grounds upon which the claim ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
23 
 rests.” (citing Conley v. Gibson , 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957); Hall, 
53 Haw. 215, 491 P.2d 541)).  It is well established that Hawai ‘i 
is a notice-pleading jurisdiction.  See, e.g. , In re Genesys  
Data Techs., Inc. , 95 Hawai‘i 33, 41, 18 P.3d 895, 903 (2001)  
(“Hawaii’s rules of notice pleading require that a complaint set 
forth a short and plain statement of the claim that provides 
defendant with fair notice of what the plaintiff’ s claim is and 
the grounds upon which the claim rests .” (citations omitted)).   
Under Hawaii’s notice pleading approach, it is “ [not] necessary 
to plead legal theories with . . . precision.”  Leslie v. Estate 
of Tavares, 93 Hawaiʻ i 1, 4, 994 P.2d 1047, 1050 (2000); see also 
Perry v. Planning Comm’n , 62 Haw. 666, 685, 619 P.2d 95, 108  
(1980) (“Modern judicial pleading has been characterized as 
‘simplified notice pleading.’  Its function is to give opposing 
parties ‘fair notice of  what the . . . claim is and the grounds 
upon which it rests.’” (citing Gibson, 355 U.S. at 47)). 
 Next, we examine the purpose and history of HRCP Rule 8(a).  
The purpose of HRCP Rule 8(a)(1) is to “give[] the defendant 
fair notice of the claim and the gr ound upon which it rests.”  
Hall, 53 Haw. at 221, 491 P.2d at 545 (citation omitted).  
Further, we have stated that “[w]e believe that the mandate of 
H.R.C.P. Rule 8(f) that ‘all pleadings shall be so construed as 
to do substantial justice’ epitomizes the general principle 
underlying all rules of H.R.C.P. governing pleadings, and by the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
24 
 adoption of H.R.C.P. we have rejected ‘the approach that 
pleading is a game of skill in which one misstep by counsel may 
be decisive to the outcome’ and in turn accepted ‘th e principle 
that the purpose of pleading is to facilitate a proper decision 
on the merits.’”  Id.
 (quoting Gibson, 355 U.S. at 48).    
 Finally, we turn to the context of HRCP Rule 8(a).  See 
Moana v. Wong, 141 Hawai ‘i 100, 109, 405 P.3d 536, 545 (2017)  
(“It is well established that the interpretation of rules 
promulgated by the supreme court involves principles of 
statutory construction.” (quoting State v. Bohannon , 102 Hawai ‘i 
228, 240, 74 P.3d 980, 992 (2003)); Cty. of Kaua‘ i v. Hanalei  
River Holdings Ltd. , 139 Hawai‘ i 511, 519, 394 P.3d 741, 749  
(2017) (“When construing a statute, our foremost obligation is 
to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the language 
contained in the statute itself.  And we must read statutory 
language in the context of the entire statute and construe it in 
a manner consistent with its purpose .” (citation omitted)).  As 
previously discussed, HRCP Rule 8(a) is devoid of any mention of 
facts, specificity, or plausibility.  Moreover, when the HRCP 
require a pleading to have specificity, they expressly state so.  
For example, HRCP Rule 9, titled “Pleading Special Matters,” 
offers examples of when specificity is required; HRCP Rule 9(b), 
titled “Fraud, mistake, condition of the mind,” requires that ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
25 
 “[i]n all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances 
constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with 
particularity.  Malice, intent, knowledge, and other condition 
of mind of a person may be averred generally. ”  Similarly, HRCP 
Rule 9(c)9 and HRCP Rule 9(g)10 require specificity.  In 
contrast, HRCP Rule 8(a), as well as HRCP Rule 13 (governing 
counterclaims and cross- claims), are devoid of any mention of 
specificity or particularity. 
 In addition , the HRCP also provides  a mechanism for dealing 
with any lack of clarity resulting from our preference for 
notice pleading under HRCP Rule 8.  HRCP Rule 12(e), titled 
“Motion for more definite statement,” states that “[a] party may 
move for a more definite statement” if a pleading is “so vague 
and ambiguous that a party cannot reasonably be required to 
frame a responsive pleading.”  The motion under HRCP Rule 12(e) 
“shall point out the defects complained of and the details 
desired.”  HRCP Rule  12(e).  Thus, under HRCP Rule 12(e), a 
court may order that any “vague or ambiguous” pleadings be 
cured; should a party fail to comply, the court may also strike 
                                                           
9  HRCP Rule 9(c), titled “Conditions precedent,” reads: “ In pleading the 
performance or occurrence of conditions precedent, it is sufficient to aver 
generally that all conditions have been performed or have occurred.  A denial 
of performance or occurrence shall be made specifically and with 
particularity.”  
 
10  HRCP Rule 9(g), titled “Special Damage,” reads: “ When items of special 
damage are claimed, they shall be specifically stated. ” ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
26 
 the pleading to which the motion was directed or issue other 
orders as deemed just.  
 Lastly, the HRCP are to “be construed and administered to 
secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every 
action.”  HRCP Rule 1.  The framework for our rules of civil 
procedure support notice pleading, as our rules contain a 
variety of methods to d
etermine the merits of a  case.  See Hall, 
53 Haw. at 218, 491 P.2d at 544 (“Such simplified ‘notice 
pleading’ is made possible by the liberal opportunity for 
discovery and the other pretrial procedures established by the 
Rules to disclose more precisely the basis of both claim and 
defense and to define more narrowly the disputed facts and 
issues.” (quoting Gibson, 355 U.S. at 47-48) (construing the 
federal rule that is analogous to HRCP Rule 8(a)))) .  For 
example, HRCP Rule 26 gives the trial court wide discretion in 
managing discovery to “secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive 
determination of every action, ” HRCP Rule 1 ,  as HRCP Rule 
26(b)(2) “secure[s] the just, speedy, and inexpensive 
determination of every action” by limiting the frequency or 
11extent of the discovery methods used.  
                                                           
11   Limitations.  By order, the court may alter the limits  
in these rules on the number of depositions and 
interrogatories or the  length of depositions under Rule 30.  
By order, the court may also limit the number of requests 
under Rule 36.  The frequency or extent of use of the 
discovery methods otherwise permitted under these rules

27 
 Notably, our case law cites heavily to Conley v. Gibson , 
355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957).   For many years the Supreme Court of the 
United States similarly interpreted FRCP Rule 8(a)(2), the 
federal counterpart to HRCP Rule 8,
 as requiring a complaint to 
provide notice of the plaintiff’s claim and the grounds upon 
which it rests.  But in 2007 with the issuance of Twombly, the 
Court expanded the requirements imposed on a complaint by FRCP 
Rule 8(a)(2).  As the ICA in Pavsek cited  to Twombly for its 
standard, it is important that we discuss Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 
and its progeny. 
 In Gibson, the Court addressed what became known as the “no 
set of facts” standard.   See 355 U.S. at 44.  The Supreme Court 
held, among other things, the petitioners’ complaint containing 
general allegations survived a motion to dismiss because the 
FRCP did not require claimants to set out detailed facts for the 
basis of their claim.  See 355 U.S. at 47.  The Court stated it 
                                                                                                                                                                                          
(. . .continued) 
shall be limited by the court if it determines that: (i) 
the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or 
duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that 
is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive; 
(ii) the party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity 
by discovery in the action to obtain the information 
sought; or (iii) the burden or expense of the proposed 
discovery outweighs its likely benefit, taking into account 
the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, 
limitations on the parties ’ resources, the importance of 
the issues at stake in the litigation, and the importance 
of the proposed discovery in resolving the issues.  The 
court may act upon its own initiative after reasonable 
notice or pursuant to a motion under Rule 26(c).  
 
HRCP Rule 26(b)(2). ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 followed the accepted rule that “a complaint should not be 
dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond 
doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of 
his claim which would entitle him to relief.”  355 U.S. at 45 -46 
(footnote omitted).  Further, the Court reasoned the FRCP only 
required a “‘short and plain statement of the claim’ that will 
give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff’s claim is 
and the grounds upon which it rests.”  355 U.S.  at 47 (footnote 
omitted).  Following the “simple guide” of FRCP  Rule 8(f) that 
“all pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial 
justice,” the Court concluded the FRCP rejected the approach 
that “pleading is a game of skill in which one misstep by 
counsel may be decisive to the outcome and accept the principle 
that the purpose of pleading is to facilitate a proper decision 
on the merits.”  355 U.S. at 48  (citation omitted).  
 The Court abrogated Gibson in Twombly , however, holding 
that a “plausibility” standard governed pleadings of  a complaint 
alleging an antitrust conspiracy.  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555– 57.  
In this context, the Court stated the pleading must contain 
“enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on 
its face.”   550 U.S. at 570.  Further, the Court stated it is 
not sufficient for the pleading to contain mere “labels and 
conclusions [or] a formulaic recitation of the elements of a 
cause of action.”  550 U.S. at 555.  To survive a motion for ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
29 
 dismissal, the “[f]actu al allegations must be enough to raise a 
right to relief above the speculative level.”   Id. 
 Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Ginsburg, dissented in 
Twombly.  See 550 U.S. at 570-97.  Pointing out that the 
plausibility standard was an evidentiary standard, Justice 
Stevens stated that the plausibility standard contradicted what 
the FRCP intended to codify.  See 550 U.S. at 580.  He 
explained: “Under the relaxed pleadings standards of the Federal 
Rules, the idea was not to keep litigants out of court but 
rather to keep them in.  The merits of a claim would be sorted 
out during a flexible pretrial process and, as appropriate, 
through the crucible of trial.”   550 U.S. at 575.  Justice 
Stevens noted that twenty- six States and the District of 
Columbia utilized the Gibson Court’s language of “whether it 
appears ‘beyond doubt’ that ‘no set of facts’ in support of the 
claim would entitle t he plaintiff to relief.”  550 U.S. at 578  
(footnote omitted). 
 Two years after Twombly, the Supreme Court clarified the 
plausibility standard in Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009).  
The Court held that the Twombly plausibility standard was not 
limited to complaints in the antitrust conspiracy context, but 
instead, was applicable to “all civil actions and proceedings in 
the United States district courts.”   Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-80, 
684 (quoting FRCP Rule 1).  The Court explained the two  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
30 
 principles in Twombly  underlying  the plausibility standard: 
first, “the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the 
allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal 
conclusions,” and second, “only a complaint that states a 
plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.”   
Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 –79 (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555 –56).  
The Court explained that “[d]etermining whether a complaint 
states a plausible claim for relief will . . . be a context-
specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its 
judicial experience and common sense.”  Id. (citation omitted).  
Further, the Court stated that if “the well -pleaded facts do not 
permit a court to infer more than the mere possibility of 
misconduct, the complaint has alleged — but it has not ‘shown’  — 
‘that the pleader is entitled to relief.’”  Id. (quoting FRCP 
Rule 8(a)(2)) (brackets omitted). 
Although “[t]he advent of plausibility pleading in Twombly
 
and Iqbal was motivated in significant part by a desire . . . to 
deter allegedly abusive practices . . . and to contain costs, ” 
when compared to the “notice pleading” standard,  the 
“plausibility” pleading standard is restrictive as it results in 
decreased access to the courts for citizens.  Arthur R. Miller, 
From Conley to Twombly to Iqbal: A Double Play on the Federal  
Rules of Civil Procedure , 60 Duke L.J. 1, 21 & n.67 (2010)  
(“[T]he perception among many practicing attorneys and  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
31 
 commentators is that the grant rate [for motions to dismiss] has 
increased, particularly in civil rights cases, employment 
discrimination, private enforcement matters, class actions, and 
proceedings brought pro se.  Some initial empirical evidence 
supports these impressions. ”).   
Indeed, when the FRCP was promulgated in 1938, “[t]he 
rulemakers believed in citizen access to the courts and in the 
resolution of disputes on their merits, ” and therefore had 
“established a relatively plainly worded, non -technical 
procedural system.”  Arthur R. Miller, Are the Federal 
Courthouse Doors Closing?  What’s Happened to the Federal Rules  
of Civil Procedure? , 43 Tex. Tech. L. Rev. 587, 587–88 (2011)  
(footnotes omitted); see also Twombly , 550 U.S. at 573 (Stevens, 
J., dissenting) (“ Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules requires 
that a complaint contain ‘ a short and plain statement of the 
claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.’   The Rule 
did not come about by happenstance, and its language is not 
inadvertent.  [In contrast to hypertechnical English pleading 
rules, the Rule intended to set forth] a pleading standard that 
was easy for the 
common litigant  to understand and sufficed to 
put the defendant on notice as to the nature of the claim 
against him and the relief sought. ” (emphasis added)) .  Just 
like Hawaii’s “notice pleading” standard, “[t]he [Federal] Rules 
had a notice pleading regime that abjured factual detail and ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 verboseness.”
  See Miller, 43 Tex. Tech. L. Rev. at 588 (citing 
Gibson, 355 U.S. 41).   
The “plausibility” pleading standard, i.e., “fact pleading 
by another name,” however, has effectively “tak[en] federal 
civil practice back toward code and common law procedure and 
their heavy emphasis on detailed pleadings and frequent 
resolution by a demurrer to the complaint or code motion to 
dismiss.”  Miller, 60 Duke L.J. at 21.   Indeed, Twombly  suggests 
“parity between the level of scrutiny applied to claims at the 
Rule 12(b)(6) and Rule 56 stages — with the only distinction 
being that between alleged facts and evidenced facts . . . .”  
A. Benjamin Spencer, Plausibility Pleading , 49 B.C. L. Rev. 431, 
487 (2008); see also Twombly, 550 U.S. at 586 (Stevens, J., 
dissenting) (“Everything today’s majority says would therefore 
make perfect sense if it were ruling on a Rule 56 motion for 
summary judgment and the evidence included nothing more than the 
Court has described.  But it should go without saying . . . that 
a heightened production burden at the summary judgment stage 
does not translate into a heightened pleading burden at the 
complaint stage.”).  This “approach [is] wholly out of line with 
the original liberal vision of the rules and would ultimately 
saddle plaintiffs in disfavored actions like antitrust and civil 
rights claims with burdens they will have difficulty meeting.”  
Spencer, 49 B.C. L. Rev. at 488 (footnotes omitted).  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 Furthermore, “[s]ince Iqbal, what constitutes ample facts, and 
whether those facts appear plausible, are matters left to the 
presiding judge’s discretion —  whereas one judge may 
subjectively regard a claim as fanciful or implausible, another 
may permit a similar claim to proceed.”  Ramzi Kassem, 
Implausible Realities:  Iqbal’s Entrenchment of Majority Group  
Skepticism Towards Discrimination Claims , 114 Penn  St. L. Rev.  
1443, 1465 (2010).     
 For all of these reasons, th e ICA’s adoption of the Pavsek 
“plausibility” standard is contrary to our well-established 
historical tradition of liberal notice pleading and undermines 
citizen access to the courts and to justice.   Instead of deeming 
the factual allegations as true as we have consistently held to 
govern HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, the standard in 
Pavsek results in factual weighing by the trial court, resulting 
in inconsistent application.   
For approximately s
eventy years, we have  upheld our liberal 
notice pleading standard.   See, e.g., Kawakami v. Kahala Hotel  
Investors, LLC, 142 Hawai ʻi 507, 518, 421 P.3d 1277, 1288 (2018) 
(“Under our rules, a complaint is good if it contains a short 
and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is 
entitled to relief.” (quoting Yap v. Wah Yen Ki Tuk Tsen Nin Hue 
of Honolulu, 43 Haw. 37, 39 (Haw. Terr. 1958)); Laeroc Waikiki

Hall, 53 Haw. at 221, 491 P.2d at 545; Midkiff v. Castle &  
Cooke, Inc., 45 Haw. 409, 413–16, 368 P.2d 887, 890- 92 (1962).   
Courts should “not depart from the doctrine of stare decisis 
without some compelling justification .”  State v. Garcia , 96 
Hawai‘i 200, 206, 29 P.3d 919, 925 (2001) (quoting Hilton v.  
South Carolina Pub. Ry. Comm’n , 502 U.S. 197, 202 (1991))  
(emphasis in original).  Not once have we questioned, or found 
ambiguous, our standards for HRCP
 Rule 8(a) and a motion to 
dismiss.  If a complaint meets the requirements of HRCP Rule 
8(a), dismissal pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate 
where “the allegations of the complaint itself clearly 
demonstrate that plaintiff does not have a claim,”  Touchette v. 
Ganal, 82 Hawaiʻ i  293, 303, 922 P.2d 347, 357 (1996), and in 
weighing the allegations of the complaint as against a motion to 
dismiss, the court “will not accept conclusory allegations 
concerning the legal effect of the events the plaintiff has 
[alleged].”  5B Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal 
Practice and Procedure  § 1357, at pp. 548 –53 (3d ed. 2004).   
 Although Twombly  and Iqbal are persuasive in interpreting 
and applying HRCP Rule 8, we are not bound by the Supreme 
Court’s interpretation of an analogous federal rule.  See, e.g. , 
Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Products , 86 Hawai ʻi 214, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
35 
 251-52, 948 P.2d 1055, 1092-93 (1997) (“[N]otwithstanding their 
persuasiveness, interpretations of the FRCP by federal courts 
are by no means conclusive with respect to our interpretation of 
any rule within the HRCP.”); Roxas v. Marcos , 89 Hawai ʻi 91, 119, 
969 P.2d 1209, 1237 (1998) (noting that although HRCP Rule 25 
was “nearly identical to its federal counterpart,” the rules 
“are not coextensive, and the federal court’s inter pretation of 
the federal rule is not binding on Hawaii’s interpretation of 
its own rule”).  See  also Hawaiʻi Const. art. VI, § 7 (“The 
supreme court shall have power to promulgate rules and 
regulations in all civil and criminal cases for all courts 
relating to process, practice, procedure and appeals, which 
shall have the force and effect of law. ”).  We find no reason to 
depart from our established precedent in evaluating an  HRCP Rule 
12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.  Accordingly, we reject the ICA’s 
standard in Pavsek  and clarify that our well-established notice 
pleading standard governs in Hawai ‘i.  
Having reaffirmed our traditional notice pleading standard, 
we now turn to the issue of whether the ICA erred in affirming 
the circuit court’s dismissal of three counts of Homeowner’s 
counterclaim.  
B. Wrongful Foreclosure Claim  
 In the following analysis, we first address whether the ICA 
erred in concluding there must first be a foreclosure before a ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
36 
 wrongful foreclosure claim can be brought.  We then apply the 
traditional notice pleading standard to determine whether the 
circuit court erred in dismissing Homeowner’s wrongful 
foreclosure claim.   
Although we have not previously squarely addressed whether 
a wrongful foreclosure counterclaim may be brought in a judicial 
foreclosure case when  no foreclosure or sale of the property has 
yet occurred, upon careful review, we hold that such a wrongful 
foreclosure claim exists in Hawai ‘i.  We base our conclusion on 
our past consideration of potential circumstances in which a 
wrongful foreclosure claim may exist in non -judicial 
foreclosures.  See Hungate
, 139 Hawai ʻi at 407, 391 P.2d at 14 
(holding there was no need to create a cause of action against a 
foreclosing mortgagee’s attorney under former HRS § 667-5 
concerning non-judicial foreclosures as “the mortgagor can 
protect its interest through filing a claim against the 
mortgagee for wrong ful foreclosure”); Santiago , 137 Hawai ʻi at 
157-58, 366 P.3d at 632-33 (holding the mortgagee’s non -judicial 
foreclosure of the mortgagors ’ property after the mortgagors 
cured their default was wrongful); Mount v. Apao , 139 Hawai ʻi 
167, 180, 384 P.3d 1268, 1281 (2016) (concluding the mortgagee’s 
non-judicial foreclosure violated former HRS § 66 7-5(c)(1) and 
was, therefore, wrongful).  We see no reason why a different 
standard should exist for judicial foreclosures. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
37 
 In Reyes-Toledo I, we recognized and discussed the problems 
associated with modern mortgage securitization practices.  See 
Reyes-Toledo I, 139 Hawai ʻi at 369 & n.14, 390 P.3d at 1256 & 
n.14.  We noted that “[t]he requirement that a foreclosing 
plaintiff prove its entitlement to enforce the note at the 
commencement of the proceedings ‘provides strong and necessary 
incentives to help ensure that a note holder will not proceed 
with a foreclosure action before confirming that it has a right 
to do so.’”  
Id. (citations omitted).  “Basic requirements of 
Hawaii’s Uniform Commercial Code and our law on standing should 
not be modified, especially in light of the widespread problems 
created by the securitization of mortgages, because a 
requirement that seems to be merely technical in nature may 
serve an essential purpose. ”  Id.  “[T]he possession 
requirement, which applies unless a specific statutory exception 
exists, protects the maker of an instrument from multiple 
enforcements of the same instrument. ”  Id. (citing Hanalei, BRC  
Inc. v. Porter, 7 Haw. App. 304, 308, 760 P.2d 676, 679 (1988)) .  
Accordingly, a foreclosing plaintiff must prove “the existence 
of an agreement, the terms of the agreement, a default by the 
mortgagor under the terms of the agreement, and givi
ng of the 
cancellation notice, ” as well as prove entitlement to enforce 
the defaulted upon note.  Reyes- Toledo I , 139 Hawai ‘i at 367 –68, 
390 P.3d at 1254 –55. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
38 
 It follows that if a foreclosing plaintiff does not prove 
the aforementioned elements and commences a foreclosure action, 
the mortgagor should be able to challenge the lawsuit without 
having to await a foreclosure decree.  Indeed, o ther 
jurisdictions have held that a party may not foreclose without 
having the legal power to do so.12  See, e.g.,  Barrionuevo v.  
Chase Bank, N.A., 885 F. Supp. 2d 964, 974 (N.D. Cal. 2012) 
(holding the mortgagors stated a claim of wrongful foreclosure 
against the bank, trustee under a deed of trust, and others by 
alleging the defendants were not current beneficiaries under the 
deed of trust); 100 Lakeside Trail Trust v. Bank of America, 
N.A., 804 S.E.2d 719, 725 (Ga. App. 2017) (noting that under  
Georgia law, “an attempted wrongful foreclosure claim exists 
when, in the course of a foreclosure action that was not 
completed, a defendant makes a knowing and intentional 
publication of untrue and derogatory information concerning the 
debtor’s financial condition, and damages were sustained as a 
direct result of the publication”  (citation and brackets 
omitted)); Fields v. Millsap & Singer, P.C. , 295 S.W.3d 567, 571 
                                                           
12  Generally, i f a foreclosure is conducted negligently or in bad faith  to 
the detriment of the mortgagor, the mortgagor may assert a claim of wrongful 
foreclosure by establishing the following elements: (1) a legal duty owed to 
the mortgagor by the foreclosing party; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a 
causal connection between the breach of that duty and the injury sustained; 
and (4) damages.  See James Buchwalter et al., 59 C.J.S. Mortgages  § 650 
(2009).  However, an action for damages against the mortgagee “lies . . . 
only when the mortgagee had no right to foreclose at the time foreclosure 
proceedings were commenced.”   Id. (footnote om itted). ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
39 
 (Mo. Ct. App. 2009)
 (stating “[a] tort action for damages for 
wrongful foreclosure lies against a mortgagee only when the 
mortgagee had no right to foreclose at the time foreclosure 
proceedings were commenced, ” but “[i]f the right to foreclose 
existed, no tort cause of action for wrongful foreclosure can be 
maintained” (citation omitted)); Gregorakos v. Wells Fargo Nat’l 
Ass’n, 647 S.E.2d 289, 292 (Ga. App. 2007) (stating that in 
Georgia, “a plaintiff asserting a cla im of wrongful foreclosure 
must establish a legal duty owed to it by the foreclosing party, 
a breach of that duty, a causal connection between the breach of 
that duty and the injury it sustained, and damages” (citation 
and brackets omitted)); McKnight Fami ly, L.L.P. v. Adept Mgmt. , 
310 P.3d 555, 559 (Nev. 2013) (stating a wrongful foreclosure 
claim challenges the authority behind the foreclosure, not the 
foreclosure act itself).  Thus, we hold that a mortgagor may 
bring a wrongful foreclosure claim before a foreclosure decree 
is entered. 
Therefore, t o assert a wrongful foreclosure claim, the 
foreclosing plaintiff must have failed to establish its standing 
as required by Reyes
-Toledo I and the mortgagor must have 
suffered an “injury in fact”  and damages as a result.  As 
explained above, a mortgagor need not wait for a foreclosure 
decree to assert a wrongful foreclosure claim.  If a party with 
no authority or standing files a foreclosure action, no ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
40 
 foreclosure decree would result, yet the mortgagor would have 
spent time and incurred expenses to defend against such a 
lawsuit.  Allowing a mortgagor  to bring a wrongful foreclosure 
counterclaim without awaiting an actual foreclosure benefits 
judicial economy and efficiency, as a foreclosure defendant 
should n ot have to institute a separate legal action after the 
pending foreclosure case is decided.  Accordingly, a  mortgagor 
should be able to assert a counterclaim for wrongful foreclosure 
based on the underlying facts of the pending foreclosure case.   
However, we emphasize this does not mean a mortgagor must assert 
the wrongful foreclosure claim as a compulsory counterclaim.  
 
Here, it remains an issue of fact whether Bank of America 
attempted to foreclose on Homeowner’s Property without standing 
to do so.  See Reyes-Toledo I, 139 Hawai ‘i at 371, 
390 P.3d at 
1258 (“A foreclosing plaintiff’ s burden to prove entitlement to 
enforce the note overlaps with the requirements of standing in 
foreclosure actions as ‘[s]tanding is concerned with whether the 
parties have the right to bring suit. ’” (citation omitted)) .  As 
a result of defending against Bank of America’s lawsuit , 
Homeowner alleged she incurred  costs and expenses.  Thus, the 
ICA erred when it concluded Homeowner did not yet have a claim 
for wrongful foreclosure against Bank of America.  
We next address whether Homeowner’s wrongful foreclosure 
count was properly dismissed by the circuit court, which the ICA ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
41 
 affirmed applying the incorrect “plausibility” pleading 
standard.   By incorporating the defenses in her Answer in to her 
wrongful foreclosure count, Homeowner asserted Bank of America 
was not the real party- in-interest, owner, holder, or holder in 
due course of the Note and Mortgage.  She also asserted there 
was “no valid nego tiation for value of [her] promissory note to 
[Bank of America].”  She argued  that, therefore, “[Bank of 
America]’s conduct in commencing this case was willful , 
malicious, without just cause,” and she was entitled to 
“general, special, and punitive damages  in an amount to vest 
this Court with jurisdiction.”   
 Taking Homeowner’s allegations  as true, as we must in 
evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss,  the wrongful 
foreclosure count within her counterclaim satisfies HRCP Rule 
8(a) and our traditional notice pleading standard.  There is an 
issue of fact regarding whether Bank of America had standing 
prior to commencing the lawsuit, and Homeowner has  provided 
notice through her allegations that, if not,  Homeowner has been  
injured, establishing  a claim for damages.  Thus, Homeowner’s 
wrongful foreclosure count  should not have been dismissed.  
C.  Declaratory Judgment Claim  
 Homeowner’s declaratory judgment  count, which incorporated 
by reference the allegations set forth in her wrongful 
foreclosure count, asserted she was entitled to declaratory ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
42 
 relief under HRS §
 632-1.  On remand, it appears the ICA based 
its analysis on the Pavsek standard, and seemed to assume as 
true the assertions with respect to the parties and assignment 
documents contained
 in Bank of America’s Complaint , as opposed 
to the Counterclaim filed by Homeowner.  Additionally, the ICA 
focused solely on issues regarding MERS raised in Bain, and 
disregarded Homeowner’s remaining assertions in her declaratory
judgment count of her counterclaim.    
As Homeowner argues, the declaratory judgment count also 
asserted: (1) Bank of America was not the owner and holder of 
the Mortgage and Note; (2) Bank of America was not entitled to 
foreclose on the Mortgage and Note; (3) MERS was not the 
mortgagee on the Mortgage but rather was a “sham and fraud” and 
MERS “acted only as a strawman”; (4) the court should decide who 
is the mortgagee on the Mortgage and the Note; and (5) Homeowner 
can recover costs and attorney’s fees pursuant to  HRS § 607- 14.  
Applying HRCP Rule 8(a) ’s notice pleading  standard, Homeowner’s 
declaratory judgment count provided sufficient notice of her 
claim and should not have been dismissed pursuant to HRCP Rule 
12(b)(6).  Taking the allegations asserted by Homeowner as true, 
it does not appear beyond doubt that Homeowner could not prove a 
set of facts entitling her to relief .  Thus, the ICA erred in 
affirming the circuit court’s dismissal of the declaratory 
judgment count within Homeowner’s counterclaim.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
43 
 D. Quiet Title Claim  
 Homeowner also incorporat ed by reference the allegations in 
her wrongful foreclosure count into her quiet title count.  
Stating she was the owner of the Property, she sought to quiet 
title to the Property against Bank of America’s adverse claim, 
asserting Bank of America was not the mortgagee.   Accepting 
Homeowner’s allegations as true , she has satisfied HRCP Rule 
8(a)’s pleading requirements by asserting that she has a 
substantial interest in the Property, and that her interest in 
the Property is greater than Bank of America’s .  See Kaʻupulehu 
Land LLC v. Heirs & Assigns of Pahukula , 136 Hawaiʻ i 123, 137,  
358 P.3d 692, 706 (2015) ( “While it is not necessa ry for the 
plaintiff to have perfect title to establish a prima facie case, 
he must at least prove that he has a substantial interest in the 
property and that his title is superior to that of the 
defendants.” (quoting Maui Land & Pineapple Co. , 76 Hawai ʻi at 
408, 879 P.2d at 513)).  If Bank of America is  indeed not the 
mortgagee, Homeowner ’s quiet title count  states a claim upon 
which relief can be granted.  Thus, we conclude the ICA erred in 
affirming the circuit court’s dismissal of the quiet title count 
within her counterclaim. 
V.  Conclusion 
 For the foregoing reasons, the ICA erred in affirming the 
circuit court’s dismissal of the remaining three counts of ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 
44 
 Homeowner’s counterclaim because the assertions satisfied our 
traditional notice pleading standard.  Accordingly, we vacate 
the ICA’s Judgment on Remand .  We also vacate the circuit 
court’s Order Dismissing Counterclaim and Order Denying Motion 
for Reconsideration to the extent it denied reconsideration of 
the Order Dismissing Counterclaim,13 and we remand to the circuit 
court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

13  In light of Reyes -Toledo I setting aside the grant of summary judgment 
of foreclosure in favor of Bank of America, our holding to reinstate the 
remaining three counts of Homeowner’s counterclaim, and the ICA’s decision to 
reinstate the UDAP count , which was not challenged by Bank of America,  we 
need not address the remaining  issue in Homeowner ’s Application regarding the 
circuit court’s refusal “to allow [Homeowner] to use her home as the 
supersedeas bond.”
