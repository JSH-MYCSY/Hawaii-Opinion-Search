RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, POLLACK, AND WILSON, JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J.
 
I. Introduction
 
This case arises from a lawsuit filed by Mark H. K. 
Greer, the former Chief of the General Medical & Preventative 
Services Division at the Hawai
'i State Department of Health (DOH). 
On September 23, 2014, Greer filed a non-vehicle tort complaint in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit against the State of  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
Hawai'i and Senator Rosalyn H. Baker. Greer’s complaint alleged 
that Baker eliminated his position in retaliation for 
whistleblowing activities. Greer raised three claims for relief: Count I--violation of the Hawai' i Whistleblowers 
Protection Act (HWPA) (Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 378-61 to 
378-70); Count II--intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED); and Count III--negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED). 
Baker moved to dismiss the Complaint on the grounds
 
that: (1) she is immune from suit based on legislative immunity;
 (2) the claims were untimely under the applicable statute of
 limitations; and (3) the Complaint failed to state a claim upon
 which relief can be granted. Following a hearing,
1
 the circuit
court denied the motion to dismiss based on legislative immunity. 
The court granted Baker’s motion as to the HWPA and NIED claims,
 but denied it as to the IIED claim.
 
Baker appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals
 
from the circuit court’s order granting in part and denying in
 part her motion to dismiss. 
Baker asserted that, based on
 
Abercrombie v. McClung, 54 Haw. 376, 507 P.2d 719 (1973), the
 order was an immediately appealable final order to the extent it
 
1
 The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided.
 
2
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
denied her defense of legislative immunity. The ICA dismissed 
the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction, concluding that 
the final judgment requirement set forth in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994), 
overruled Abercrombie, and that no exceptions for appealability were satisfied. Baker timely petitioned this court for a writ of certiorari to review the ICA’s judgment. 
We conclude that the ICA has jurisdiction to hear 
Baker’s appeal because the circuit court’s order is an immediately appealable collateral order. The denial of Baker’s absolute legislative immunity claim conclusively determined the disputed question, resolved an important issue separate from the merits of the action, and would be effectively unreviewable on appeal. See Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 
Hawai'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998). We therefore vacate 
the ICA’s order dismissing Baker’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction, and remand to the ICA for determination of the appeal on the merits. 
II. Background
 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings
 
On September 23, 2014, Greer, the former Chief of the
 
General Medical & Preventative Services Division at DOH, filed a
 non-vehicle tort complaint in the circuit court against the State
 
3
   
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
and Baker. Baker is the Senator for the Sixth State Senate
 
District (South and West Maui). 
The Complaint alleged that Baker introduced a budget
 
amendment to eliminate Greer’s position in retaliation for his
 
whistleblowing activities regarding Medicaid fraud. The
 Complaint further alleged that Baker, outside her legislative
 
capacity, colluded with the head of the DOH to have him fired.
 
Greer’s Complaint raised three claims for relief: 
Count I--violation of the HWPA (Hawai' i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 
378-61 to 378-70); Count II–IIED; and Count III–NIED. 
Baker subsequently filed a Motion to Dismiss the
 
Complaint based primarily on legislative immunity. Baker also
 
moved to dismiss the HWPA claim on statute of limitations grounds
 and because Baker was not Greer’s employer. Further, Baker moved
 to dismiss the IIED and NIED claims based on the applicable
 statute of limitations and the lack of an underlying cognizable
 claim. 
By order entered on December 24, 2014, the circuit court
 
granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss. As
 
pertinent to the issue before this court, the circuit court denied
 
Baker’s motion to dismiss based on legislative immunity. The
 circuit court ruled as follows:
 
4
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
1. Defendant Baker’s claim of legislative immunity
is denied.
 
2. Defendant Baker’s claim that the statute of
 
limitations has expired is denied.
 3. Count I based on violation of HRS § 378-62, the 
Hawai'i Whistleblowers Protection Act (“HWPA”), is
dismissed as against Defendant Baker because Defendant
Baker was not Plaintiff’s employer.  Count I remains against the State. 
4. Count II based on intentional infliction of
 
emotional distress (“IIED”) is not dismissed against
either Defendant Baker and the State.
 
5. Count III based on NIED is dismissed as against
Defendant Baker, but remains against the State. 
Plaintiff has alleged an underlying cognizable claim
against the State in Count I, based on the violation of
the HWPA. 
In sum, the IIED claim is the only remaining claim
 
against Baker. All three claims remain against the State.
    
In response to the court’s ruling, Baker filed a motion
 
for leave to file interlocutory appeal and for stay pending appeal
 
pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b).2 While Baker’s motion was pending,
 
Baker filed a notice of appeal from the court’s order granting in
 part and denying in part Baker’s motion to dismiss. 
2 HRS § 641-1(b) (Supp. 2014) provides:
 
Upon application made within the time provided by the
rules of court, an appeal in a civil matter may be
allowed by a circuit court in its discretion from an
order denying a motion to dismiss or from any
interlocutory judgment, order, or decree whenever the
circuit court may think the same advisable for the
speedy termination of litigation before it.  The
 refusal of the circuit court to allow an appeal from
an interlocutory judgment, order, or decree shall not
be reviewable by any other court.
 
5
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
The court denied Baker’s motion for leave, ruling that
 
the interlocutory appeal would not result in the speedy
 
termination of the litigation for “all parties.” 
B. ICA Appeal
 
Baker filed a statement of jurisdiction with the ICA,
 
asserting that the December 24, 2014 interlocutory order was an
 
appealable final order to the extent it denied her defense of
 legislative immunity based on Abercrombie, 54 Haw. at 380-81, 507
 P.2d at 721-22 (denial of motion for summary judgment based on
 legislative immunity was final and appealable). Baker noted that
 “cases from around the country show that a denial of legislative
 immunity . . . is immediately appealable[.]” A number of Baker’s
 cited cases relied on the collateral order doctrine. 
Greer’s jurisdictional statement argued that his
 
Complaint alleged behavior outside the exercise of Baker’s
 legislative functions and, therefore, the actions alleged in the
 Complaint are not afforded the protection of immediate appellate
 review established by Abercrombie. Greer did not argue that
 Abercrombie was overruled or did not apply.
 
After the opening brief was filed but before the
 
answering and reply briefs, the ICA, by a 2-1 majority, dismissed
 the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction. Greer v. Baker,
 
No. CAAP-15-34 (App. May 26, 2015) (Order). The majority noted
 
6
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
that Abercrombie did not cite any statutory authority to support 
its holding regarding appellate jurisdiction, thereby suggesting that the Hawai' i Supreme Court may have invoked jurisdiction 
through the court’s supervisory powers, which does not confer jurisdiction on the ICA. 
The majority then went on address the final judgment 
requirement set forth in Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i 115, 869 P.2d 1334, 
suggesting that it overruled Abercrombie. It concluded that under 
3
Jenkins, absent an appealable final judgment, HRS § 641-1(a)  did
not entitle Baker to appellate review of the order denying her
 legislative immunity claim. Greer, Order at 7-8. The majority
 
also concluded that the order did not qualify as an appealable
 final order under any of the exceptions to the separate judgment
 rule: the Forgay doctrine, under Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201
 (1848), the collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b). Greer,
 
Order at 8-9.
 
In her dissent, Associate Judge Katherine Leonard opined
 
that the Abercrombie case was on point and binding on the ICA, and
 therefore she would allow the appeal to proceed. Greer, Order at
 
10. 
3
 HRS § 641-1(a) (Supp. 2014) provides that “[a]ppeals shall be
 
allowed in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or decrees . . . .”

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
III. Standard of Review
 
“The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law that
 
[the appellate court reviews] de novo under the right/wrong 
standard.” Captain Andy’s Sailing, Inc., v. Dep’t of Land & 
Natural Res., State of Hawai' i, 113 Hawai' i 184, 192, 150 P.3d 833, 
841 (2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
IV. Discussion
 
The issue before this court is whether a denial of a
 
motion to dismiss on grounds of absolute legislative immunity is
 immediately appealable. We hold that it is.
4
 
A. Framework for Filing an Appeal 
There is no common law right to appeal. “The right to
 
appeal is purely statutory, and exists only when given by some
 
constitutional or statutory provision.” Lingle v. Haw. Gov’t 
Employees Ass’n, 107 Hawai' i 178, 184, 111 P.3d 587, 593 (2005). 
To avoid piecemeal litigation of every ruling, statutory rights to 
appeal generally require a final disposition of the action. See 
Mitchell v. State Dep’t of Educ., 77 Hawai' i 305, 308, 884 P.2d 
368, 371 (1994). There are specific exceptions, including certain judgments, orders, and decrees that are deemed final and 
4
 Baker argues in the alternative that this court should exercise
 
supervisory jurisdiction pursuant to HRS §§ 602-4 and 602-5.  In view of our
 
disposition of this appeal, we do not address this argument.
 
8
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
appealable when they are entered, and interlocutory appeals as
 
provided by statute. 
1. The separate judgment rule
 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the Hawai' i 
Intermediate Court of Appeals from “final judgments, orders or 
decrees of circuit and district courts[.]” (Emphasis added). Appeals under HRS § 641-1(a) “shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of court.” HRS § 641-1(c) (Supp. 2014). Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 54(a) (2000) defines 
“judgment” as follows: “‘Judgment’ as used in these rules includes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies. A judgment shall not contain a recital of pleadings, the report of a master, or the record of prior proceedings.” HRCP Rule 58 (2010), the so called “separate judgment rule,” provides in part that, “[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document.” 
In Jenkins, this court explained that “[t]he separate 
document provision was added to HRCP [Rule] 58 . . . and has been generally ignored by practitioners and circuit courts alike.” 76 Hawai'i at 118, 869 P.2d at 1337. We held that “[a]n appeal may 
be taken from circuit court orders resolving claims against parties only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]” Id. at 119, 
9
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
869 P.2d at 1338. The requirement that a judgment be memorialized 
in a separate document cannot be waived. Id. “Thus, based on 
Jenkins and HRCP Rule 58, an order is not appealable, even if it resolves all claims against the parties, until it has been reduced to a separate judgment.” Carlisle v. One (1) Boat, 119 Hawai' i 
245, 254, 195 P.3d 1177, 1186 (2008). 
2. Exceptions to the separate judgment rule
 
There are a number of exceptions to the separate
 
judgment rule that permit an appeal prior to the final resolution
 
of all of the issues in the case. Many of these exceptions are
 statutory, such as HRS § 641-1(b) (Supp. 2014), which authorizes
 an appeal from an interlocutory order if the appellant obtains the
 express permission of the circuit court “whenever the circuit
 court may think the same advisable for the speedy termination of
 the litigation before it.” A refusal to grant an application for
 interlocutory appeal is not reviewable by any other court. HRS §
 641-1(b).
 
There are two common law exceptions to the separate 
judgment rule. First, the collateral order doctrine authorizes an appeal from an order that (1) conclusively determines a disputed question, (2) resolves an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and (3) is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. See Abrams, 88 Hawai' i at 322, 966 
10
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
P.2d at 634. Second, the Forgay doctrine authorizes an appeal 
from (1) a judgment for immediate execution against an interest in real property that is (2) effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment, even if all other claims of the parties have not been finally resolved. See, e.g., Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai' i 
18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (allowing an appeal based on Forgay). 
B. The Collateral Order Doctrine
 The ICA majority, citing to Abrams and Brown v. Wong, 
71 Haw. 519, 523, 795 P.2d 283, 285 (1990), concluded that the 
circuit court’s order did not satisfy the requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine. We disagree, and conclude that denials of absolute legislative immunity meet the three-part collateral order test as described by this court in Abrams, 88 Hawai' i at 322, 966 P.2d at 634. Consequently, the ICA 
has jurisdiction to hear Baker’s appeal. 
In Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541
 
(1949), the United States Supreme Court explained an
 interpretation of the finality requirement in 28 U.S.C. § 1291
5
 
5
 28 U.S.C. § 1291 provides:
 
The courts of appeals (other than the United States
Court
 of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) shall have
jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of
the district courts of the United States, the United
States District Court for the District of the Canal
 
(continued

11
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
that has come to be known as the collateral order doctrine. 
Appeals are allowed from orders characterized as final under this
 doctrine even though it may be clear that they do not terminate
 the action or any part of it. See 15A Charles Alan Wright &
 
Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3911 (2d ed.
 1987). 
This court first applied the collateral order doctrine
 
in MDG Supply, Inc. v. Diversified Invs., Inc., 51 Haw. 480, 481­
82, 463 P.2d 530, 531-32 (1969). Since then, we have continued to
 
rely on the doctrine to exercise appellate jurisdiction over 
certain appeals that are neither a final judgment nor have been allowed by the circuit court as interlocutory appeals under HRS § 641(b). See, e.g., Ass’n of Owners of Kukui Plaza v. Swinerton 
& Walberg Co., 68 Haw. 98, 107, 705 P.2d 28, 35 (1985) (orders compelling or denying arbitration); Knauer v. Foote, 101 Hawai' i 
81, 85, 63 P.3d 389, 393 (2003) (orders expunging a lis pendens). We have explicitly recognized the collateral order doctrine as an exception to the separate judgment rule. See Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i 
5(...continued)
Zone,
 the District Court of Guam, and the District
Court of the Virgin Islands, except where a direct
review may be had in the Supreme Court. The
 jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit shall be limited to the
 jurisdiction described in sections 1292(c) and (d) and
1295 of this title.

   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
at 117 n.1, 869 P.2d at 1336 n.1 (“This opinion is not intended to 
apply to . . . appealable collateral orders.”); Lambert v. Teisina, 131 Hawai' i 457, 461 n.8, 319 P.3d 376, 380 n.8 (2014) 
(noting that the Forgay doctrine, the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b) are “[e]xceptions to the separate, final 
judgment requirement”).
 
1.	 The denial of Baker’s absolute immunity claim is an
immediately appealable collateral order
 
“The collateral order doctrine involves a three-part 
test, all elements of which must be met in order to invoke 
appellate jurisdiction.” Abrams, 88 Hawai' i at 322, 966 P.2d at 
634. The order must “(1) conclusively determine the disputed 
question, (2) resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and (3) be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.” Id. (quoting Siangco v. Kasadate, 
77 Hawai' i 157, 161, 883 P.2d 78, 82 (1994)). 
Hawai'i appellate courts will “construe the collateral 
order doctrine narrowly and be parsimonious in its application.” Siangco, 77 Hawai' i at 162, 883 P.2d at 83. As we observed in 
Abrams, the majority of cases in this jurisdiction regarding the collateral order doctrine “have determined that the interlocutory order is not appealable.” 88 Hawai' i at 321 n.4, 966 P.2d at 634 
n.4 (emphasis in original). In addition, the appeal of a
 
13
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
collateral order brings up for review only that order or the 
orders that collectively led to entry of the collateral order appealed. Cook v. Surety Life Ins. Co., 79 Hawai' i 403, 409, 903 
P.2d 708, 714 (App. 1995). 
Notably, Baker’s defense is one of absolute immunity.
6 
The nearly unanimous view across the nation is that a denial of absolute immunity falls squarely under the collateral order doctrine. See 15A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure 
§ 3911.3 n.6 (collecting cases). Hawai' i state legislators enjoy 
legislative immunity under article III, section 7 of the Hawai' i 
Constitution, which provides: “No member of the legislature shall be held to answer before any other tribunal for any statement made or action taken in the exercise of the member’s legislative functions . . . .” We have held that this legislative immunity is absolute. See Seibel v. Kemble, 63 Haw. 516, 521-22, 631 P.2d 
173, 177 (1981) (“Legislators also have been accorded absolute immunity for actions taken within the scope of their duties.”) 
6 Compare Black’s Law Dictionary  867 (10th ed. 2014) (Absolute
 
immunity is “[a] complete exemption from civil liability, usu. afforded to
officials while performing particularly important functions, such as a
representative enacting legislation and a judge presiding over a lawsuit”),
with id. at 868 (Qualified immunity is “[i]mmunity from civil liability for a
public official who is performing a discretionary function, as long as the
conduct does not violate clearly established constitutional or statutory
rights.”).  “The nature of qualified immunity doctrine bears on the
difficulties of the problem, because [qualified] immunity frequently depends
on the specific facts of a particular case.”  15A Wright & Miller, Federal
 Practice and Procedure § 3914.10. 
14
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
(emphasis added); Abercrombie, 54 Haw. at 380, 507 P.2d at 721
 
(“[A]ppellant’s statements . . . can be construed as an exercise
 of [his] legislative function and thus [are] absolutely
 privileged.”). In this case, the ICA did not make any finding
 otherwise; rather, it simply held that it did not have
 jurisdiction to hear Baker’s appeal. Greer, Order at 3.
 
The first requirement of the collateral order doctrine,
 
whether the circuit court’s ruling conclusively decided a disputed
 question, is met in this case. “The most basic element of
 collateral order finality is that the [court] must have decided
 the matter offered for appeal.” 15A Wright & Miller, Federal
 Practice and Procedure § 3911.1.
 
This is not a case in which the circuit court would need 
to “revisit the issue” of Baker’s claim. Cf. Siangco, 77 Hawai' i 
at 161, 883 P.2d at 82; S. Ute Indian Tribe v. Amoco Prod. Co., 2 F.3d 1023, 1028-29 (10th Cir. 1993) (holding that the issue in question was not conclusively determined because the court declared that its order was preliminary). In denying the motion to dismiss and thereby requiring Baker to defend the litigation, the circuit court “conclusively determined” her claim of immunity: “Defendant Baker’s claim of legislative immunity is denied. Defendant Baker is not protected by legislative immunity[.]” For the purposes of dismissal, the circuit court’s order was the 
15
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
“final word on the subject.” Digital Equip. Corp. v. Desktop
 
Direct, Inc., 511 U.S. 863, 869 (1994) (citation omitted). 
The second requirement, that the order resolve an
 
important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,
 
is also met. The legislative immunity issue is conceptually
 distinct from the merits of Greer’s claims. Absolute legislative
 immunity is available to Baker if her action was “taken in the
 exercise of [her] legislative functions[.]” Haw. Const. art. III,
 § 7. Whether an act is “legislative” generally “turns on the
 nature of the act itself, rather than on the motive or intent of
 the official performing it.” Bogan v. Scott-Harris, 523 U.S. 44,
 
45 (1998). That determination would be separate from a decision
 
7
on the merits of a HWPA,  NIED, or IIED claim.  See Doe Parents
 
7	 Specifically, HRS § 378-62 (Supp. 2012) provides: 
An employer shall not discharge, threaten, or
otherwise discriminate against an employee regarding the
employee’s compensation, terms, conditions, location, or
privileges of employment because:
 
(1)	 The employee, or a person acting on behalf
of the employee, reports or is about to
report to the employer, or reports or is
about to report to a public body, verbally
or in writing, a violation or a suspected
violation of:
 
(A)	 A law, rule, ordinance, or
regulation, adopted pursuant to law
of this State, a political
subdivision of this State, or the
United States; or
 
(B)	 A contract executed by the State, a
polit
ical subdivision of the State,

No. 1 v. State Dep’t Of Educ., 100 Hawai' i 34, 69-70, 58 P.3d 545, 
580-81 (2002) (describing the elements of an NIED claim); Young v. 
Allstate Ins., Co., 119 Hawai' i 403, 429, 198 P.3d 666, 692 (2008) 
(describing the elements of an IIED claim). 
The third factor, whether the ruling would be
 
“effectively unreviewable” if appellate review is deferred until
 there is a final judgment in the trial court, is also satisfied in
 this case. In Kukui Plaza, we held that an order denying
 arbitration fell under the collateral order doctrine because “it
 will be too late effectively to review the present order when
 final judgment is entered; for the rights conferred by HRS Chapter
 658, if it is applicable, will have been lost, probably
 irreparably.” 68 Haw. at 105-06, 705 P.2d at 34 (citations and
 quotation marks omitted). And in Knauer v. Foote, this court held
 that an order expunging a lis pendens meets the collateral order
 criteria because “if the movant had to wait until final judgment
 on the underlying claim, the realty could be sold before the issue

or the United States,
unless the employee knows that the
report is false; or

was resolved, thereby rendering the order unreviewable.” 101 
Hawai'i at 85, 63 P.3d at 393. 
The concern in those cases–-that an appellant’s right 
might be irreparably lost–-is present here. Legislative immunity is an immunity from suit, rather than a mere defense to liability. By requiring the legislator to proceed as a party until a final judgment, the entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation would be lost. See Abercrombie, 54 Haw. at 
381, 507 P.2d at 722 (“[I]t is ridiculous to resolve the question of law as to whether the appellant can be held answerable before ‘any other tribunal’ after he has been subjected to trial.”); see also State v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai' i 446, 451, 923 P.2d 388, 393 
(1996) (noting that the district court’s denial of a motion to dismiss was dissimilar from “denials of motions to dismiss based on arguments that . . . would establish that the defendant has a right not to be tried[,]” which “are collateral orders immediately appealable as final decisions”) (citing Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651 (1977)). 
That absolute immunity is intended to protect against
 
the burdens of trial was made explicit in Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472
 U.S. 511 (1985), which allowed a collateral order appeal from a
 pretrial denial of a defense of official immunity. The Supreme
 Court, in ruling that the appeal was proper, noted that, “the
 
18
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
denial of a substantial claim of absolute immunity is an order
 
appealable before final judgment, for the essence of absolute
 immunity is its possessor’s entitlement not to have to answer for
 his conduct in a civil damages action.” Id. at 525 (citations and
 
quotation marks omitted); see Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731,
 742 (1982).
 
Indeed, denial of absolute immunity has been considered
 
the embodiment of a ruling that is unreviewable from a final
 judgment, as it is “intended to protect against the burdens
 imposed by the trial process as well as the burden of adverse
 judgment.” 15A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure
 § 3911.3; see id. at § 3914.1 (stating that the best illustration
 of “rights intended to protect against the burden of trial rather
 than simply to protect against the entry of judgment” is provided
 by appeals based on claims of official immunity); Flanagan v.
 United States, 465 U.S. 259, 267 (1984).
 
In the instant case, the circuit court’s order denying
 
Baker’s motion to dismiss based on legislative immunity
 conclusively determined whether Baker would need to undergo the
 burdens imposed by the trial process. Baker’s immunity claim was
 completely separate from the underlying action in which Greer
 sought relief under the HWPA and for his claims of NIED and IIED.

Once Baker is required to go to trial, the entitlement not to
 
stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation would be lost.
 
We therefore conclude the order denying Baker’s absolute
 
immunity claim was an immediately appealable collateral order.
 
2.	 The ICA erred in concluding that the circuit court’s
order did not qualify as a collateral order
 
The ICA concluded, without conducting the three-part
 
test in Abrams, that the circuit court’s order did not satisfy the
 
requirements of the collateral order doctrine, and did so in part
 by relying upon Brown v. Wong, 71 Haw. at 522, 795 P.2d at 285. 
Greer, Order at 8.
 
In Brown, we held that “a pre-trial order denying a
 
motion to dismiss or for judgment on the pleadings or for summary
 judgment, on the basis of sovereign immunity, is not a collateral
 order, final in nature, and appealable in actions brought against
 
the State under HRS Chapters 661 and 662.” 71 Haw. at 522, 795
 
P.2d at 285 (emphasis added). Our reasoning was that in addition
 
to our “long standing policy against piecemeal appeals[,]” there
 was no reason why the State, like any other party, “should not be
 required to establish, by summary judgment, the non-existence of
 genuine issues of material fact, or be required, failing that, to
 proceed to trial.” Id.
 
20
    
 
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
Brown is distinguishable, insofar as the immunity
 
protected under sovereign immunity is not the same as legislative
 
immunity. Under HRS § 662-2 (1993), the waiver of sovereign
 
immunity is limited to “immunity from liability[.]” (Emphasis
 
added). Immunity from liability is not necessarily “effectively
 unreviewable,” as a party could have an adverse denial of summary
 judgment reversed on appeal. On the other hand, legislative
 immunity involves immunity from suit: “No member of the
 
legislature shall be held to answer before any other tribunal[.]”
 
Haw. Const. art. III, § 7; see also Abercrombie, 54 Haw. at 381,
 
507 P.2d at 722. Once Baker is required to go to trial, the
 
entitlement not to stand trial would be irreparably lost.
 
In addition, the Brown court was concerned with the
 
State, “in every case, . . . us[ing] the claim of sovereign
 immunity as a vehicle for having numerous genuine material factual
 issues reviewed on appeal[.]” Brown, 71 Haw. at 522, 795 P.2d at
 
284. In other words, on appeal the State would be able to
 
“bundle” its sovereign immunity claim with the other issues in the
 case, effectively bypassing the requirement of a final judgment. 
That concern is not present here. An appeal of a denial of
 legislative immunity could not bring with it the other claims at
 issue, otherwise it would fail the second requirement of the
 collateral order doctrine--that the order resolve an important
 
21
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
issue completely separate from the merits of the action. Thus,
 
Brown is not dispositive of the issue, and the ICA has
 jurisdiction to hear Baker’s appeal.
 
C. Jenkins has Not Overruled Abercrombie
 
The ICA held that if Abercrombie assumed jurisdiction
 
pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a), the subsequent holding in Jenkins has
 
overruled it. Greer, Order at 5-7. HRS § 641-1(a) allows appeals
 
“from all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and
 district courts and the land court to the intermediate appellate
 court, subject to chapter 602.”
 
Jenkins did not overrule the holding in Abercrombie. In
 
short, based on the Abercrombie majority’s reasoning and the case
 it cited, Gillespie v. U.S. Steel Corp., 379 U.S. 148 (1964), the
 Abercrombie court treated the denial of legislative immunity as an
 immediately appealable collateral order. Since Jenkins does not
 apply to collateral orders, it did not overrule Abercrombie.
 
In Abercrombie, the plaintiff sued a state senator for
 
slander. 54 Haw. at 376-77, 507 P.2d at 719-20. The senator
 filed a motion to dismiss based on legislative immunity. The
 circuit court treated the motion to dismiss as a motion for
 summary judgment and denied the motion. Id. Thereafter, the
 
senator filed a “Motion for Summary Judgment or to Reserve
 Questions of Law to Supreme Court[,]” claiming that “there is no
 
22
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
genuine issue as to any material fact and that defendant is
 
entitled to judgment as a matter of law[.]” Id. at 377, 507 P.2d
 
at 720. The circuit court denied the state senator’s motion. Id.
 
On appeal, the supreme court concluded that the order
 
denying the senator’s motion for summary judgment based on
 legislative immunity was an immediately appealable final order:
 
It is well established that under usual circumstances a
 
denial of a motion for summary judgment would be
interlocutory; however, it does not necessarily mean
that denial of the motion for summary judgment in this
case is therefore interlocutory.  This court has
 repeatedly stated that a final decision for the purpose
of appeal is not necessarily the last decision in the
case, and that the nature and effect of the decision
rather than the stage at which it is rendered is the
true test.
 . . . .
 Here, the trial court’s denial of the motion for
summary judgment is final as to appellant’s right to
raise the issue whether the trial court lacked
 jurisdiction to try him for statements made by him as a
member or our legislature, in the light of our
constitutional provision reading “no member of the
legislature shall be held to answer before any other
tribunal.”
 
. . . .
 
In seeking a just and expeditious resolve and to meet
the need of sparing the litigants unnecessary
expenditure of time, effort and money, we conclude that
the trial court’s order denying appellant’s motion for
summary judgment is an appealable final order.
 
Id. at 380-81, 507 P.2d at 721-22 (quotation marks omitted;
 
emphases added).8

 In a later opinion, the supreme court ruled on the merits of the
 
senator’s appeal and held that allegedly slanderous statements made by a
legislator in the exercise of his or her legislative function are absolutely
privileged.  See Abercrombie v. McClung, 55 Haw. 595, 600, 525 P.2d 594, 597
 (1974). 
23
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
While the court used the general phrase “appealable
 
final order,” the majority’s reasoning and cited cases indicate
 
that the denial of legislative immunity was a specific type of
 appealable final order–-a collateral order.
 
In support of its holding regarding appellate
 
jurisdiction, Abercrombie cited, and used nearly identical
 language to, the United States Supreme Court’s opinion in
 Gillespie. Importantly, Gillespie cited extensively to Cohen v.
 Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949), the case that
 served as the basis for the collateral order doctrine.
 
That the Abercrombie court did not explicitly reference
 
the collateral order doctrine is less significant because that
 phrase was not yet widely used. Though Cohen set the groundwork,
 the Supreme Court did not use the term “collateral order” until
 1977, see Abney, 431 U.S. at 657, and did not use the term
 “collateral order doctrine” until 1978, see United States v.
 MacDonald, 435 U.S. 850, 855 (1978). Before that, the Supreme
 Court was engaging in the same type of “finality analysis” present
 in Abercrombie. Compare Abercrombie, 54 Haw. at 380, 507 P.2d at
 
721 (“[A] final decision for the purpose of appeal is not
 necessarily the last decision in the case[.]”), with Gillespie,
 379 U.S. at 152 (“[A] decision ‘final’ within the meaning of [the
 statute governing appeals] does not necessarily mean the last
 
24
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
order possible to be made in a case.”); see also Cohen, 337 U.S.
 
at 546-47 (“We hold this order appealable because it is a final
 disposition of a claimed right which is not an ingredient of the
 cause of action and does not require consideration with it.”). 
Moreover, the Abercrombie court’s holding that the trial
 
court’s denial was “final” was based on reasons similar to that of
 the modern-day collateral order doctrine. Compare Abercrombie, 54
 
Haw. at 381, 507 P.2d at 722 (“[T]he trial court’s denial . . . is
 final as to appellant’s right to raise the issue [of
 jurisdiction.]”), with Kukui Plaza, 68 Haw. at 106, 705 P.2d at 34
 (Arbitration denial was an appealable collateral order because “it
 [would] be too late effectively to review the present order when
 final judgment is entered[.]”) (quotations omitted). In short,
 the senator in Abercrombie had a constitutional right not to stand
 trial, and the trial court’s denial of summary judgment was final
 as to that right. The Abercrombie court’s conclusion that the
 denial was “an appealable final order” was based on principles
 akin to a collateral order.
 
Since Abercrombie is most accurately construed as a 
collateral order, Jenkins does not apply to it. See Jenkins, 76 Hawai'i at 117 n.1, 869 P.2d at 1336 n.1 (“This opinion is not 
intended to apply to . . . appealable collateral orders.”); Lambert, 131 Hawai' i at 461 n.8, 319 P.3d at 380 n.8 (“Exceptions 
25
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAII REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***
 
to the separate, final judgment requirement include . . . the
 
collateral order doctrine[.]”). The ICA was therefore incorrect
 in holding that if Abercrombie assumed appellate jurisdiction 
pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a), the subsequent holding in Jenkins has
 overruled it.
 
V. Conclusion
 
For the forgoing reasons, we vacate the ICA’s May 26,
 
2015 order dismissing Baker’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction and
 remand this case to the ICA for determination of the appeal on its
 merits.
