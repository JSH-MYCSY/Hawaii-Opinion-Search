CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
(CAAP-15-0000053; APPEAL NO. 14-01) 
MARCH 2, 2017 


OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J.
   
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 11-25 provides 
procedures for the challenging of a person’s voter registration 
status. When a challenge is brought prior to the day of an 
election, HRS § 11-25(a) applies, which allows a voter to challenge “the right of a person to be or to remain registered as a voter in any precinct” through a written challenge. 
The  
 
    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
challenge must set forth the grounds upon which it is based and 
be delivered to the county clerk of the respective county; the clerk is required to promptly investigate and rule on the challenge. HRS § 11-25(a). In cases where the clerk rules on a 
challenge prior to election day, appeals may be made from the 
clerk’s ruling to the local board of registration pursuant to HRS § 11-26(b). Such appeals must be brought within ten days of service of the adverse decision. HRS § 11-26(b). 
The petitioner in this case, Lanric Hyland, appealed 
from a county clerk decision to the local board of registration 
for the County of Hawai ʻi (the “local board”). The local board 
determined that Hyland’s appeal was due on October 14, 2014, 
based in part on its determination that October 13, 2014, was a holiday and tolled his appeal deadline for that day. Although the local board determined that Hyland mailed his appeal within 
ten days of service of the county clerk’s decision, the board 
ruled that Hyland’s appeal was untimely because the board did not receive his appeal until after October 14, 2014. Thus, the local board concluded that it was without jurisdiction to review the appeal. The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) affirmed the local board’s determination that Hyland’s appeal was not timely because the board did not receive the appeal within ten days of service of the county clerk’s decision. However, the 
ICA also determined that Hyland did not mail his letter within 
2 
 
 
    
 
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the ten-day filing period because the second Monday in October 
is not a Hawai ʻi state holiday. 
We hold that the board had jurisdiction to consider 
the merits of Hyland’s appeal, and we also determine that the 
second Monday in October--recognized by the federal government as Columbus Day--is a holiday for purposes of the computation of time as to when an act is to be done under HRS § 1-29. 
Accordingly, we vacate the decisions of the ICA and the local 
board and remand the case to the local board for further proceedings. 
I. BACKGROUND 
Hyland challenged the voter registration of Ronald 
Gonzales in District 9 by filing a challenge with the Office of 
the County Clerk of the County of Hawai ʻi (the “county clerk”). 
In a letter mailed on October 2, 2014, the county clerk 
determined that Gonzales was properly registered in District 9. 
Hyland appealed the county clerk’s decision to the 
local board by a letter dated and sent by registered mail on 
October 14, 2014. Hyland’s letter noted that the county clerk’s 
decision was served on October 2, 2014, and that his appeal was timely filed because, although the tenth day was Sunday, October 12, the appeal did not need to be postmarked until Tuesday, October 14, as Monday, October 13, was a federal holiday. 
3 
 
 
    
  
                     
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Gonzales filed objections to the jurisdiction of the 
local board, arguing that the appeal was untimely because it was 
not received by the local board until October 16. Gonzales argued the following with regard to the filing deadline: 
The Clerk issued his decision on October 1, 2014, and
completed service via certified mail on October 2, 2014.
Counting forward, the tenth day was Sunday, October 12,2014. Since the Clerk served his decision by mail, HawaiiRules of Civil Procedure (“HRCP”) Rule 6(e) was triggered.This section enlarged the original 10-day period by two
days, for a total of 12 days. The twelfth day fell on
Tuesday, October 14, 2014. This was the deadline for the filing of the appeal. 
Gonzales contended that because October 14, 2014, was not a 
Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, there was no provision in any applicable law that allows for an extension beyond October 14, 2014. Gonzales asserted that the local board’s consideration of Hyland’s untimely appeal would infringe on his due process rights. Hyland filed a reply arguing that Gonzales misinterpreted when the appeal was filed, and he maintained that 
the appeal was filed on the date of mailing--October 14, 2014. 
A prehearing conference was held before the local 
board.
1 At the prehearing conference, Gonzales raised his 
objections to the board’s jurisdiction and the board heard 
arguments. At the conclusion of the hearing, the local board decided that the appeal was untimely. The board subsequently

island of Hawai ʻi, before local board chair Philip Matlage and member Andrew
Kahili.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
issued its decision in its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law 
and Order Dismissing Appeal, dated January 9, 2015. 
The board found that the appeal from the county clerk 
decision was filed on October 16, 2014. The board concluded 
that the appeal was untimely because the mailing of the appeal 
by registered mail did not constitute “filing.” The board relied on Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR) § 3-172-43(a), which provides, 
An appeal of the clerk’s ruling shall be made in writing by
filing a notice of appeal with the chairperson of the boardof registration within ten days of the service of the
clerk’s decision. 
Quoting Black’s Law Dictionary  (9th ed. 2009), the board 
reasoned that “filing” means delivery of legal documents “to the 
court clerk or record custodian for placement into the official 
record”: 
Haw. Admin. R. § 3-172-43(a) requires that an appeal be made in
writing by “filing a notice of appeal” with the chairperson of
the Board within ten days of service of the clerk’s decision.
The common understanding of the word “file” means to “deliver alegal document to the court clerk or record custodian forplacement into the official record.” 
The board also noted that, because October 13, 2014, was a 
holiday, the last day Hyland could have timely filed an appeal was on October 14, 2014. Accordingly, the board concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the appeal because the appeal was not received until October 16, 2014. 
5 
 
 
    
  
                     
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Hyland appealed to the ICA, challenging the local 
board’s determination that his appeal was not timely.2 In a 
memorandum opinion, the ICA affirmed the order dismissing the 
appeal, concluding that Hyland’s appeal was not timely as it was 
not filed until the date it was received by the local board in 
the mail. The ICA endorsed the local board’s definition of “filing” within HAR § 3-172-43(a) to mean “deliver[y] of the Appeal letter to the Board within ten days of when the County Clerk properly mailed his adverse decision to them.” Thus, the ICA concluded that in order for Hyland’s appeal to be timely, he was required to deliver his appeal letter to the local board within ten days of when the county clerk mailed the adverse 
decision. 
The ICA additionally held that the local board 
erroneously concluded that October 13 was a holiday that tolled 
the appeal deadline to October 14. In a footnote explaining this ruling, the ICA noted that the second Monday in October is not listed as a state holiday under HRS § 8-1, which enumerates 
2 Hyland also contended that the information given to him by the
local board with regard to how to file his notice of appeal was insufficient,
constituting a denial of his right to due process. The ICA held that Hyland
waived his due process challenge regarding the information he received fromthe local board regarding filing an appeal because he failed to identify anylegal authority for his contention. We do not review this ruling in light ofour disposition in this case.

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the holidays recognized by the State, and HRS § 8-1.5 provides 
that Discoverer’s Day is not recognized as a state holiday.3 
Hyland filed an application for writ of certiorari 
with this court, which was granted. 
II. DISCUSSION 
Hyland challenges the local board’s dismissal of his 
appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Hyland asserts that the board’s interpretation of the ten-day filing period “completely obliterates the legislative purpose” to provide ten days in which to file an appeal as provided by HRS § 11-26(b).
4 
Accordingly, we consider whether the local board had jurisdiction to consider Hyland’s appeal.
5 The resolution of 
this issue hinges on whether Hyland timely brought his appeal of the county clerk’s decision to the local board. Thus, we first determine the date the ten-day statutory appeals period closed, 
3 HRS § 8-1.5 states that “the second Monday in October shall be
known as Discoverers’ Day, in recognition of the Polynesian discoverers of
the Hawaiian Islands, provided that this day is not and shall not be
construed to be a state holiday.” 
4 Hyland also argues that his due process rights were violated
based on incomplete information he received from the Board of Registration
concerning the filing of his appeal. In his supplemental memorandum to thiscourt, he also asserts that the local board’s delivery requirement violates
equal protection. We do not address Hyland’s constitutional assertions in
light of our disposition of the case. 
5 Because the issue regarding the filing requirements to timely
bring an appeal determines the jurisdiction of the local board, we review the
board’s determination de novo. See Dupree v. Hiraga, 121 Hawai ʻi 297, 312,
219 P.3d 1084, 1099 (2009) (“The existence of jurisdiction is a question of
law that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard.” (quoting
 Captain
Andy’s Sailing, Inc. v. Dep’t of Land & Nat. Res., 113 Hawai ʻi 184, 192, 150
P.3d 833, 841 (2006)). 
7 
 
 
    
  The ICA determined that the local board erroneously 
concluded that October 13, 2014, was a holiday that tolled 
Hyland’s appeal deadline to October 14, 2014. 
  HRS § 1-29 (2009) provides the following with regard 
to the computation of time: ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
and second, we review the local board’s interpretation of its jurisdiction under HRS § 11-26(b). 
A. 
The time in which any act provided by law is to be done is
computed by excluding the first day and including the last,unless the last day is a Sunday or holiday and then it is
also excluded. When so provided by the rules of court, the
last day also shall be excluded if it is a Saturday. 
Thus, if the last day to complete an act is a Sunday or holiday, 
the actor has until the following day to complete the act. HRS § 1-29 is included in Chapter 1 of Title 1 pertaining to common law and the construction of laws. Chapter 1 also includes HRS § 
1-32 regarding acts to be done on holidays: 
Whenever any act of a secular nature other than a work of
necessity or mercy is appointed by law or contract to be
performed upon a particular day, which day falls upon aSunday or holiday, the act may be performed upon the nextbusiness day with the same effect as if it had beenperformed upon the appointed day. When so provided by the
rules of court, the act also may be performed upon the next
business day with the same effect as if it had beenperformed upon the appointed day if the appointed day fallson a Saturday.

 7  Columbus Day was not designated as a holiday by presidential
proclamation in 2014.  
See Presidential Proclamation--Columbus Day 2014, the
White House (Jan. 26, 2017), https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-
office/2014/10/10/presidential-proclamation-columbus-day-2014. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
HRS § 1-32 (2009). Although both provisions reference 
“holiday,” there is no definition for the term in Chapter 1.6 
Chapter 8 of Title 1 is entitled “Holidays and Periods 
of Recognition and Observance.” There is no definition of 
“holiday” in Chapter 8. HRS § 8-1 lists the holidays that are 
designated as “state holidays” and also recognizes as a “state holiday” any day designated as a holiday by proclamation of the President of the United States.
7 HRS § 8-1. 
As discussed, Chapter 1, which pertains to common law 
and the construction of laws, uses the term “holiday” with regard to the computation of time under laws and contracts as opposed to HRS § 8-1, which designates “state holidays.” 
Because Chapter 1 uses the term “holiday” rather than the term 
“state holiday,” it appears the legislature intended that the term “holiday” would include holidays other than state holidays. In this case, we must consider whether the second Monday in October is a holiday for purposes of HRS § 1-29, even though it is not designated as a state holiday under HRS § 8-1. 
6 It appears the ICA’s interpretation of “holiday” as used in HRS §
1-29 would also apply to the term “holiday” as used in HRS § 1-32 regarding
acts that are specified to be done by law or contract. 
9 
 
 
    
  
 
                     
   
  
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Federal law designates the second Monday in October, 
Columbus Day, as a federal holiday. See U.S.C. § 1603(a) 
(2012). 
As a public holiday, October 13, 2014, was considered a 
legal public holiday for purposes of federal agencies and the 
United States Postal Service.8 Given that Columbus Day is a 
federal public holiday--and federal courts, agencies, and the 
United States Postal Service are closed--October 13, 2014, was a “holiday” for purposes of the computation of time under HRS § 1-29.
9    
Although the ICA was correct to the extent that it 
determined October 13, 2014, was not a Hawai ʻi state holiday, the 
ICA erred in holding that “holiday” as used in HRS § 1-29 only includes “state holidays.” 
Thus, the local board properly 
determined that October 13, 2014, was a holiday for purposes of computing the time Hyland had to appeal the county clerk’s 
decision. For the reasons discussed, Hyland’s ten-day period to 
bring his appeal began on October 2, 2014, and continued through October 14, 2014.

https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/snow-dismissal-procedures/federal-
holidays/#url=2014 (last visited Jan. 23, 2017) (listing Monday, October 13,2014, as a holiday for federal employees). 
9 It appears that the only federal holiday that is not a state
holiday is Columbus Day. Compare HRS § 8-1,  with 5 U.S.C. § 1603. 
10 Hyland maintained throughout the proceedings, including in his
appeal to the ICA and his application for certiorari, that he was served onOctober 2, 2014. Given that Hyland did not challenge the adequacy of serviceuntil his supplemental memorandum, we decline to address this contention. 
10 
 
 
    HRS § 11-26(b) provides for a challenger’s right to 
appeal a decision by the county clerk that is made prior to 
election day: 
                     
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
B. 
In cases where the clerk rules on a challenge, prior to
election day, or refuses to register an applicant, or
refuses to change the register under section 11-22, theperson ruled against may appeal from the ruling to theboard of registration of the person’s county. The appealshall be brought within ten days of service of the adverse
decision. Service of the decision shall be made personally
or by registered mail, which shall be deemed complete upondeposit in the mails, postage prepaid, and addressed to theaggrieved person’s last known address. If an appeal from adecision on a challenge prior to election day is brought,
both the challenger and the challenged voter may be parties
to the appeal. 
HRS § 11-26(b) (Supp. 2014). Thus, HRS § 11-26(b) provides for 
a right to appeal from the ruling of the county clerk to the local board that must be 
brought within ten days of service of 
the adverse decision. Service of the decision occurs upon the county clerk’s mailing of its decision. HAR § 3-172-43(a), 
which relates to HRS § 11-26(b), provides that appeals are made 
by “filing a notice of appeal” within ten days of service of the clerk’s decision.
11 Consequently, this case raises the question 
as to whether a local board has jurisdiction under HRS § 11-
11 HAR § 3-172-43(a) (2010) provides, 
Any appeal of the clerk’s ruling shall be made in writing
by filing a notice of appeal with the chairperson of theboard of registration within ten days of service of theclerk’s decision. 
11 
 
 
   
                     
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
26(b) to consider an appeal that is mailed, but not received, 
within ten days of service of the adverse decision. 
Although the statute is ambiguous as to what it means 
to “bring” an appeal, “brought” must be interpreted in a manner 
that achieves the legislature’s intent to provide a meaningful 
opportunity for appeal. 
In this case, the local board 
interpreted HAR § 3-172-43(a)’s “filing” requirement to mean 
delivery  of the appellate document to the local board’s O ʻahu 
office. However, this interpretation of the rule to require delivery would commonly be unworkable and inconsistent with HRS § 11-26(b)’s provision of ten days for the bringing of an appeal. For example, in this case, the county clerk mailed its decision to Hyland’s post office box address on October 2, 2014, a Thursday, via the United States Postal Service, first-class mail. Because the letter was mailed on a Thursday afternoon, it 
is possible that the letter could have been delivered to 
Hyland’s post office box as late as the following 
Tuesday.12 In 
order to ensure that a letter of appeal sent via the United States Postal Service would be delivered to the local board’s 
Oʻahu mailing address by October 14, 2014, a person in Hyland’s 
position would have had to mail the letter on or before 
12 Letters sent via first-class mail are delivered within three 
business days or less. Mail & Shipping Services, USPS.COM,

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Wednesday, October 8, 2014.13 Accordingly, a person under 
similar circumstances may have had only one day to mail the 
appeal following actual delivery of the county clerk’s decision. 
The local board’s narrow interpretation of its 
jurisdiction is particularly concerning given that claims under HRS § 11-26 involve the integrity of the electoral process and the right to vote. 
The same procedures that apply to Hyland in 
this case would also apply to a voter whose right to vote in a particular precinct has been challenged. This court has recognized that “[t]he right to vote is of ‘fundamental 
importance.’” 
Green Party of Haw. v. Nago , 138 Hawai ʻi 228, 240, 
378 P.3d 944, 956 (2016) (quoting Hayes v. Gill, 52 Haw. 251, 
269, 473 P.2d 872, 883 (1970)). 
Accordingly, given the remedial purpose of the statute 
and the import of the right to vote, we cannot conclude that HRS 
§ 11-26 contemplates that a challenger may potentially have only 
a one-day window in which to appeal from a county clerk decision. 
Cf. R.F.C. v. Prudence Sec. Advisory Grp. , 311 U.S. 
579, 582 (1941) (“Ambiguities in statutory language should not be resolved so as to imperil a substantial right which has been granted.”). If the legislature intended that local boards of registration’s jurisdiction would be so limited, then the 
13 See supra note 12. 
13 
 
 
    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
legislature would have used language to indicate that delivery 
was required. Instead, the legislature chose to use the word “brought,” which is not synonymous with “delivered” or even “filed.” Courts in other jurisdictions have also recognized 
that the term “brought” does not unambiguously require the 
delivery of the legal document to the relevant authority. See 
Serna v. Law Office of Joseph Onwuteaka, P.C.
, 732 F.3d 440, 443 
(5th Cir. 2013) (“‘[B]ring such action’ does not plainly mean ‘file a pleading.’”); General v. E. Roseman Co., 336 A.2d 287, 289 (Pa. 1975) (interpreting “brought or taken” in a statute concerning appeals from a workmen’s compensation board to include appeals mailed within the appeal period). 
Further, the legislative history of HRS § 11-26(b) 
does not indicate that the legislature intended to limit a local board of registration’s jurisdiction so narrowly as to require physical delivery of all appeals within ten days. 
In 1990, the 
legislature amended HRS § 11-26(b) to provide that appeals must be “brought” within ten days of the adverse decision. 1990 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 45, § 7 at 83-84. Although the primary purpose of the bill was to provide for voter registration by mail, the 
1990 amendments also “update[d] statutory provisions relating to 
voter registration challenges” and “clarif[ied] the appeals procedures from a decision by the county clerk or an election official.” S. Stand Comm. Rep. No. 2842, in 1990 Senate 
14 
 
 
    
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Journal, at 1190-91. The legislative history notes that, prior 
to the 1990 amendments, the law was “vague as to the length of time before an appeal must be brought by an applicant declared ineligible to vote.” H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 627-90, in 1990 
House Journal, at 1074-75. Given the primary purpose of the 
1990 amendments to make “the process of voter registration more convenient for the voters,” in combination with clarification of the appeal process, it appears that the legislature intended to make participation in the voter registration process more accessible, and thus the delivery requirement adopted by the local board in this case does not comport with this legislative intent. S. Stand Comm. Rep. No. 2842, in 1990 Senate Journal, 
at 1190-91. 
Accordingly, the local board’s decision that it needed 
to receive Hyland’s appeal by the tenth day is inconsistent with 
the legislature’s intent to provide a meaningful time period for the bringing of an appeal from a county clerk decision. See HRS 
§ 11-26(b) (providing that the appeal must be brought within ten days). By extension, the local board’s interpretation of the filing requirement of HAR § 3-172-43 to require delivery to the 
chairperson of the local board was erroneous as it substantially 
diminished the right to appeal pursuant to HRS § 11-26(b). See 
Diamond v. Bd. of Land & Nat. Res., 112 Hawai ʻi 161, 175, 145 
P.3d 704, 718 (2006)(noting that an agency’s interpretation of 
15 
 
 
    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
its regulation “must be consistent with the legislative purpose” 
of the related statute). Indeed, while “[i]t is axiomatic that an administrative rule cannot contradict or conflict with the statute it attempts to implement,” it is also not within an 
agency’s authority to interpret and apply its own rules in a 
manner that restricts the act being administered. See Lales v. 
Wholesale Motors Co.
, 133 Hawai ʻi 332, 354, 328 P.3d 341, 363 
(2014) (“[A]n agency’s authority to promulgate rules ‘is limited to enacting rules which carry out and further the purposes of the legislation and do not enlarge, alter, or restrict the provisions of the act being administered.’”). Thus, the local board’s decision in this case is erroneous to the extent that it conflicts with the legislature’s intent to provide a meaningful opportunity to appeal and that it unnecessarily restricts the board’s jurisdiction to consider such appeals. In short, an 
agency may not interpret its authority in a manner that yields 
an unjust result “obviously inconsistent with the purpose and policies of the statute.” 
Cf. Pofolk Aviation Haw., Inc. v. 
Dep’t of Transp., 136 Hawai ʻi 1, 7, 354 P.3d 436, 442 (2015) 
(quoting Schmidt v. HSC, Inc., 131 Hawai ʻi 497, 508, 319 P.3d 
416, 427 (2014)). 
Given that HAR § 3-172-43 does not unambiguously 
include the local board’s delivery requirement, this rule may be interpreted and applied in a manner to be consistent with HRS § 
16 

 
 
                       
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
11-26(b). Cf. Si-Nor, Inc. v. Dir., Dep’t of Labor & Indus. 
Relations, 120 Hawai ʻi 135, 146, 202 P.3d 596, 607 (App. 2009) 
(observing that a statute’s use of the term “filing” was 
“sufficiently indistinct” to allow for clarification by agency rule). Indeed, it appears that HAR § 3-172-43’s “filing” requirement was previously interpreted by a local board of registration to include mailing in at least one other case. In 
Dupree v. Hiraga, 121 Hawai ʻi 297, 219 P.3d 1084 (2009), the 
court considered a local board’s jurisdiction over an appeal 
from a county clerk’s decision. The appeal in Dupree involved a 
challenge to a voter’s eligibility pursuant to HRS § 11-25. 121 
Hawaiʻi at 304, 219 P.3d at 1090. In that case, the local board 
found that the challenger “filed” his appeal on the date that 
the letter itself was 
dated.14 Id. at 304, 306, 219 P.3d at 
1091, 1093 (2009). 
The voter in Dupree had challenged the local 
board’s jurisdiction over the appeal based on the contents of 
the appeal. Id. 121 Hawai ʻi at 299, 219 P.3d at 1086. Although 
the voter’s argument was not based on the time of the filing of 
the appeal, the finding of fact regarding the date of filing was specifically challenged, and this court concluded that the local board did not clearly err in finding that the board had 
The regulation that applied in Dupree included the same “filing”
requirement that exists today. Compare HAR § 2-51-43 (2000) (“Any appeal of
the clerk’s ruling shall be made in writing by filing a notice of appeal with
the chairperson of the board of registration within ten days of service ofthe clerk’s decision.”), 
with
 HAR § 3-172-43 (2010) (same).

jurisdiction. Id. at 315, 219 P.3d at 1102; see also, e.g., 
Brooks v. Dana Nance & Co.
, 113 Hawai ʻi 406, 412, 153 P.3d 1091, 
1097 (2007) (recognizing that Hawai ʻi appellate courts are “under 
an obligation” to independently ensure jurisdiction in each case 
and to sua sponte dismiss an appeal where the court lacks jurisdiction). Accordingly, it is also not inconsistent with this court’s previous decision in 
Dupree to conclude that the 
board has jurisdiction over an appeal when the appeal letter is mailed within ten days of service of the county clerk decision. 
In this case, the local board’s interpretation of HAR 
§ 3-172-43 substantially diminished Hyland’s right to appeal under HRS § 11-26(b). 
While the ICA correctly observes that 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 6(e)--which provides an 
additional two days for the filing of a response when the triggering event is served by mail--does not apply to computation for an agency proceeding, it appears that it would be consistent with HRS § 11-26--and within the agency’s authority--to apply such a rule to voter challenge appeals. We do not doubt that there are other procedures that the Office of Elections or local boards of registration may utilize that would provide for a meaningful opportunity to appeal consistent with 
HRS § 11-26.

agency’s jurisdiction to provide for procedures that facilitate 
a meaningful opportunity to appeal consistent with HRS § 11-26. 
III. CONCLUSION 
For the reasons discussed, the ICA’s March 9, 2016 
judgment on appeal and the local board’s January 9, 2015 “Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Dismissing Appeals” are vacated, and the case is remanded to the local board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
