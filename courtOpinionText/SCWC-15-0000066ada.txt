RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, AND WILSON, JJ., WITH
CIRCUIT JUDGE CHANG IN PLACE OF POLLACK, J., RECUSED   
OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.  
I. Introduction 
In this case, the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit1 
(“circuit court”) sentenced Stanley S.L. Kong to consecutive 
terms of imprisonment, due to his “extensive criminality,” based 
on a Presentence Investigation Report (“PSI”) that erroneously 
The Honorable Shackley F. Raffetto presided. 1

included two prior convictions. These prior convictions had 
been previously vacated, remanded, and ultimately dismissed, but 
Kong’s counsel did not bring this to the circuit court’s 
attention. When Kong directly appealed his sentence, this court 
affirmed the circuit court. State v. Kong , 131 Hawai i 94, 315 
P.3d 720 (2013) (“Kong I ”). We first held that the circuit 
court adequately articulated the basis for Kong’s consecu tive 
sentences when it referenced Kong’s “extensive criminality.” 131 Hawai i at 103, 315 P.3d at 729. We then held that the 
burden had been upon Kong to challenge, before the circuit 
court, the erroneous inclusion of the two prior convictions. 
131 Hawai i at 106, 315 P.3d at 732.  We further held that the 
sentencing court did not plainly err in relying upon the 
erroneous PSI, in light of Kong’s many other prior convictions. 
131 Hawai i at 107, 315 P.3d at 733.  
Three days after this court issued its op
inion in Kong I , 
Kong filed a motion under Hawai i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(“HRPP”) Rule 35(b) (2003)2, to “reconsider or reduce sentence.” 
HRPP Rule 35 provides the following: 
(a) Correction of Illegal Sentence. The court may 
correct an illegal sentence at any time and may correct a 
sentence imposed in an illegal manner within the time 
provided herein for the reduction of sentence. A motion 
made by a defendant to correct an illegal sentence more than 90 days after the sentence is imposed shall be made 
pursuant to Rule 40 of these rules. A motion to correct a 
sentence that is made within the 90 day time period shall 
(continued. . .)

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
3 Before a different judge of the circuit court,  he challenged the 
erroneous inclusion of the two prior convictions  in his PSI.  
The circuit court denied Kong’s motion. While it acknowledged 
that it might have sentenced Kong differently, the circuit court 
ultimately expressed its doubts that it could re-evaluate Kong’s 
sentence in light of Kong I. The Intermediate Court of Appeals 
(“ICA”)  affirmed, holding that Kong could not challenge, via a 
Rule 35 motion, the erroneous inclusion of the two vacated and dismissed prior convictions in his PSI in the first place.  
On certiorari, 
Kong presents the following questions: 
1. Did the Intermediate Court of Appeals gravely err when 
it held that the lower court may abdicate its power to 
independently review, reconsider, and reduce an original 
sentence thereby undermining the policies and purposes of 
HRPP Rule 35? 
2. Did the ICA gravely err in holding that Mr. Kong could 
not raise a good -faith challenge to the use of invalid and 
vacated prior convictions in his Rule 35 motion? 
(continued. . .)  
empower the court to act on such motion even though the 
time period has expired. 
(b) 
Reduction of Sentence. The court may reduce a 
sentence within 90 days after the sentence is imposed, or within 90 days after receipt by the court of a mandate 
issued upon affirmance of the judgment or dismissal of the 
appeal, or within 90 days after entry of any order or 
judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States denying 
review of, or having the effect of upholding the judgment 
of conviction. A motion to reduce a sentence that is made 
within the time prior shall empower the court to act on 
such motion even though the time period has expired. The 
filing of a notice of appeal shall not deprive the court of 
jurisdiction to entertain a timely motion to reduce a sentence. 
The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided. 
3

 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
We hold that the ICA erred in holding that a challenge to the 
erroneous inclusion of prior convictions in a PSI cannot be 
brought on a Rule 35 motion for post-conviction relief. 
Therefore, the circuit court properly entertained the motion. 
The circuit court erred, however, by (1) concluding that Kong I 
precluded its re-evaluation of Kong’s sentence; an d (2) failing 
to address Kong’s challenge to the inclusion of the two vacated 
and dismissed prior convictions in his PSI. Therefore, we 
vacate the ICA’s December 27, 2016 Judgment on Appeal, and its 
November 29, 2016 Memorandum Opinion. This case is remanded to 
the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion.  
II. Background 
A. 2011 Sentencing and First Appeal 
In April 2011, Kong was convicted and sentenced to 
consecutive sentences for one count of promoting a dangerous 
drug in the second degree (ten years), and one count of prohibited acts relating to drug paraphernalia (five years). 
The circuit court sentenced him to consecutive sentences based 
on his “extensive criminality,” as reflected in the multiple 
felony convictions contained in his PSI.  Kong I, 131 Hawai i at 
96, 315 P.3d at 722.  Two felony convictions in the PSI, 
however, had been previously vacated, remanded, and ultimately 
4
     
 
 
  
 
 Kong first appealed his sentence in May 2011.   On appeal, 
Kong raised the following  points of error regarding his 
sentencing: “(1) whether the circuit court erred in imposing 
consecutive terms of imprisonment without adequately 
articulating a rationale; [and] (2) whether the circuit court 
violated Kong’s due process rights by basing its sentence on 
certain crimes set forth in the PSI report  . . . that Kong 
alleged were ‘vacated, remanded, and ultimately dismissed. . . 
.’” 131 Hawai i at 99, 315 P.3d at 725. The ICA affirmed his 
conviction and sentence. State v. Kong,  129 Hawai i 135, 295 
P.3d 1005 (App. 2013).  
 This court affirmed the ICA.  Kong  I, 131 Hawai i 94, 315 
P.3d 720. We answered in the negative Kong’s first question 
presented: whether the circuit court’s statement regarding his 
“extensive criminality” was insufficient to justify the 
imposition of consecutive sentences and did not meet the 
requirements of State v. Hussein , 122 Hawai i 495, 229 P.3d 313 
(2010). Kong I , 131 Hawai i at 103, 315 P.3d at 729.  We  noted 
that Hussein  directed circuit courts to “state on the record at 
the time of sentencing the reasons for imposing a consecutive 
sentence,” and that the circuit court’s “extensive criminality”  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
dismissed, but Kong’s counsel did not object to their use in 
sentencing. 131 Hawai i at 105, 315 P.3d at 731.  
5
     
 
 
    
 
 This court also found without merit Kong’s second question 
presented: whether his sentence constituted  plain error because 
it was based on crimes he did not commit. Kong I , 131 Hawai i at 
104, 315 P.3d at 730. Before this court, Kong had argued that 
State v. Sinagoga, 4 81 Hawai i 421, 918 P.2d 228  (App. 1996)  
                     
   
 4 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
comment satisfied this requirement. Kong I, 131 Hawai i at 102, 
103, 315 P.3d at 728, 729.  
Sinagoga set forth five steps “to be taken by Hawai i courts in cases 
where ordinary sentencing procedures are applicable and there is a 
possibility that the court may use the d efendant’s prior conviction(s) as a 
basis for the imposition or enhancement of a prison sentence”:  
Step one, the court shall furnish to the defendant or defendant’s counsel and to the prosecuting attorney a copy 
of the presentence report, HRS § 706 -604, and any other 
report of defendant’s prior criminal conviction(s). Step 
two, if the defendant contends that one or more of the 
reported prior criminal convictions was (1) uncounseled, 
(2) otherwise invalidly entered, and/or (3) not against the 
defendant, the  defendant shall, prior to the sentencing, 
respond with a good faith challenge on the record stating, as to each challenged conviction, the basis or bases for the challenge. Step three, prior to imposing the sentence, 
the court shall inform the defendant that (a) each reported 
criminal conviction that is not validly challenged by the 
defendant is defendant’s prior, counseled, validly entered, 
criminal conviction, and (b) a challenge to any reported prior criminal conviction not made by defendant before 
sentence is imposed may not thereafter, absent good cause, 
be raised to attack the court’s sentence. Step four, with 
respect to each reported prior criminal conviction that the 
defendant challenges, the [Hawai i Rules of Evidence] shall 
apply, and the court shall expressly decide before the 
sentencing whether the State satisfied its burden of 
proving to the reasonable satisfaction of the court that 
the opposite of the defendant’s challenge is true. Step 
five, if the court is aware of the defendant’s prior 
uncounseled or otherwise invalid criminal conviction(s), it shall not impose or enhance a prison sentence prior to 
expressly stating on the record that it did not consider it 
or them as a basis for the imposition or enhancement of a 
prison sentence.  
81 Hawai
i at 447, 918 P.2d at 254. This framework was modified in  State v. 
Veikoso
, 102 Hawai i 219, 74 P.3d 575 (2003). The Veikoso  court held that “a 
(continued. . .) 
6
     
 
 
  
                                                                  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
should not “extend to cases where convictions did not exist at 
the time of sentencing,” or, in the alternative, that Sinagoga  
should be overturned. Id.   We disagreed with Kong, holding that 
the Sinagoga  framework applied to his case. 131 Hawai i at 105, 
315 P.3d at 731. Under step two of the Sinagoga  framework, the 
defendant bears the burden of challenging prior convictions in a 
PSI that the defendant alleges were “uncounseled” or “not 
against the defendant.” Sinagoga, 81 Hawai i at 447, 918 P.2d at 
254. We held that the vacated and dismissed prior convictions 
were “not against the defendant” ; therefore, Kong bore the 
burden of challenging the inclusion of these prior convictions 
in his PSI. Kong I, 131 Hawai i at 106, 315 P.3d at 732. As 
Kong did not challenge the convictions before the circuit court, 
we held that the circuit court did not err in relying on the PSI  
at sentencing. 131 Hawai i at 105, 315 P.3d at 731.    
We 
also held that the circuit court’s use of the vacated 
and dismissed convictions in sentencing did not amount to plain 
error, as “the record indicate[d] that the circuit court based 
its imposition of a consecutive sentence on Kong’s ‘extensive’ 
(continued. . .)  
defendant may not collaterally attack prior counseled DUI convictions on the 
basis that they were obtained as the result of allegedly invalid guilty 
pleas.” 
102 Hawai i at 226, 74 P.3d at 582 (footnote omitted). In a 
footnote, this court stated, “Because the ‘otherwise invalidly entered’ 
language in [step two of the] Sinagoga 
[framework] may be construed as 
permitting collateral attacks whenever the validity of a conviction is 
challenged, we emphasize, in light of our holding today, that this language 
should be disregarded.” 102 Hawai i at 226 n.8, 74 P.3d at 582 n.8. 
7
     
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
   
 
  
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
criminal record as a whole and not solely on the specific 
convictions that Kong allege[d were]  invalid.” 131 Hawai i at 
107, 315 P.3d at 733. In light of the many other prior 
convictions referenced in the PSI, we held, “[I]t cannot be said 
that Kong’s substantial rights were affected by the circuit court’s use of the PSI report.” 
Id.  (footnote omitted).  
B. Kong’s Rule 35 Motion 
Three days after Kong I 
was issued, Kong filed an HRPP Rule 
35(b) Motion to “reconsider or reduce s entence.” Kong asked the 
circuit court to re-sentence him to a concurrent 10-year prison 
term instead of the 15 consecutive years Judge Raffetto had 
originally sentenced him on the two drug convictions. At this time, Kong raised his Sinagoga challenge to the PSI’s erroneous 
inclusion of the two vacated and dismissed convictions. Kong also attached a prison progress report reflecting the completion 
of a number of required and voluntary programs. “Substance 
Abuse-RDAP III (IOP)” was the only required program marked “Incomplete.” 
The State opposed Kong’s motion. The State argued that 
Kong’s motion essentially requested concurrent, rather than 
consecutive, sentencing. The State defended the consecutive 
sentence as appropriate. 
The circuit court held a hearing on Kong’s motion. At the 
hearing, the circuit court stated that “it wouldn’t be a wise 
8
     
 
 
  
  
  
   
 Kong’s counsel filed a supplemental memorandum in support 
of his motion for reconsideration or reduction of sentence.   
Attached was a 1994 “Notice and Judgment on Appeal ,” in which 
the ICA vacated Kong’s co nvictions for Burglary in the Second 
Degree and Unauthorized Control of a Propelled Vehicle, and 
remanded the case for further proceedings.   Also attached was a 
1995 “Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice,” in which the prosecutor’s office, upon remand from the  ICA, moved for an *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
thing to do” to reduce Kong’s drug and paraphernalia sentences 
in light of the fact that Kong had not completed the required 
substance abuse program.   Kong’s counsel explained that the 
erroneous addition of the two vacated and dismissed convictions resulted in Kong’s classification at a different level for 
programming purposes; were Kong to be classified accurately, 
Kong’s counsel contended that Kong’s substance abuse program 
would be considered completed.   
The circuit court suggested to Kong’s counsel that he file 
a motion to correct the PSI so that the State would have an 
opportunity to respond. 
With regard to any potential 
reconsideration or reduction of sentence, the circuit court stated, “I’m not suggesting to you [defense counsel] that I’m 
going to do anything different than what’s already been done. 
Because it’s already gone up on appeal.” The circuit court 
continued the motion to reconsider or reduce sentence. 
9
     
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
   
 
   
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
order dismissing the case with prejudice.   The motion was 
“approved and so ordered,”  as indicated by a judge’s signature 
on the bottom left of the motion.   
Kong’s counsel also filed a “Written Notice of Objection to 
the Pre-Sentence Report and Other Materials Contained in the 
Court File.” The written notice asked, inter alia
, that all 
references to the vacated and dismissed prior convictions be 
removed from Kong’s PSI. The State did not file a response to 
the written notice. There is nothing in the record indicating 
that the circuit court acted upon the written notice. 
At the continued hearing on the motion to reconsider or 
reduce sentence, the State argued that this court’s Kong I 
opinion had “held that there was no abuse of discre tion and the 
Court made a proper finding in sentencing [Kong].” The State 
argued that Kong’s sentence had been “reviewed by the appellate process twice,” and that Kong’s motion for reconsideratio n or 
reduction of sentence was without merit. 
Kong’s counsel disagreed that this court’s opinion in Kong 
I foreclosed reconsideration or reduction of Kong’s sentence. 
He stated that the appeal was not about the sentence itself; 
rather, the appeal concerned whether the initial sentencing 
court had sufficiently articulated the basis for the sentence, 
and whether it was plain error for the sentence to be based on a 
PSI that included the two vacated and dismissed convictions. 
10
     
 
 
  The circuit court also heard from Kong, who asked to be  
sentenced based on only his valid convictions.   The circuit 
court stated, “Well, I don’t disagree with you there, and I 
appreciate what you are saying.”     
 The circuit court ultimately sided with the State.  The 
circuit court suggested that it would have sentenced Kong differently had it been the initial sentencing court, but 
doubted that the initial sentence was “inherently unjust or 
unfair,” in light of the fact t hat the Kong I  court did not 
remand Kong’s case for resentencing:  
 This has already been –- this sentence was appealed, 
and the Supreme Court reviewed it, and if the Supreme Court 
felt -- I understand the grounds when they look at these 
things. But the appellate court – - the appellate court has 
really scrutinized a lot of these cases, especially with the composition of our present court. Even if it wasn’t 
raised, if they feel this was inherently unjust or unfair, 
they would have sent it back, and they d idn’t.  
 And so –- and I understand that disparity, but I 
don’t know what Judge Raffetto’s reasoning was, but that’s 
what he did, and I just don’t see the grounds to reconsider 
or reduce it.  
 
 
 
  The circuit court denied Kong’s motion to reconsider or 
reduce sentence. Although the circuit court seemed to accept 
that the PSI contained vacated and dismissed convictions, the 
record does not reflect that the circuit court disposed of *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Kong’s counsel also pleaded for leniency, asking the circuit 
court to re-evaluate Judge Raffetto’s sentence.   
I’m not saying that’s what I would have done, but 
that’s not the standard to decide it. 
11

     
 
 
  On appeal, Kong raised the following points of error, which 
he continues to pursue on certiorari:  
 [1]. The circuit court failed to independently 
consider the merits of Mr. Kong’s motion and wrongly 
deferred to the appellate courts and the original 
sentencing judge.  
 [2]. The circuit court failed to comply with the 
framework in State v. Sinagoga and address the chal  lenged 
prior convictions contained in the pre -sentence 
investigation report.6  
 
 In a memorandum opinion, the ICA affirmed the circuit 
court’s order denying Kong’s motion to reconsider or reduce 
sentence. State v. Kong , CAAP-15-0000066 (App. Nov. 29, 2016)  
(mem.) at 11. As to the first point of error (whether the circuit court failed to independently consider the merits of 
Kong’s motion and wrongly deferred to the appellate courts and 
the original sentencing judge), the ICA held that “the circuit 
court sufficiently considered the merits of Kong’s motion,” 
supporting its conclusion solely with a recapitulation of Kong’s 
                     
  
 
 
6   Kong also raised a third point of error: “The prosecution’s objection 
to a reduction in the sentence to concurrent terms of imprisonment violates 
an agreement reached with Mr. Kong.” As this point of error is not pursued 
on certiorari, this opinion does not address it. As this court is vacating the ICA’s judgment on appeal and remanding this case to the circuit court for 
further proceedings, defense counsel may raise this issue with the circuit 
court on remand.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Kong’s “Written Notice of Objection to the Pre-Sentence Report 
5 and Other Materials Contained in the Court File.”  
C. ICA Appeal 
5 We note that HRS § 706 -604(2) (2014) provides, in pertinent part, “The 
court shall amend or order the amendment of the [pre -sentence] report upon 
finding that any correction, modification, or addition is needed and, where 
appropriate, shall require the prompt preparation of an amended report in 
which material required to be deleted is completely removed. . . .”

 7 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
filings in support of his motion and the arguments made in those 
filings and at the hearings on the motion. Kong, mem. op. at 4. 
Next, the ICA “presume [d] that the circuit court considered all 
of the factors listed in HRS § 706-6067 when it denied Kong’s 
Motion to Reconsider or Reduce.” Kong, mem. op. at 6. The ICA, 
however, did not address Kong’s arguments that (1) the circuit 
court wrongly believed that this court had already ruled that 
Kong’s sentence was fair and just and simply deferred to this 
court’s Kong I opinion; and (2) the circuit court wrongly 
deferred to Judge Raffetto ’s initial sentencing decision. 
The ICA did directly address Kong’s second point of error 
(whether the circuit court failed to comply with the Sinagoga 
framework and address the challenged prior convictions contained 
in the PSI). Kong, mem. op. at 7-10. The ICA held that 
Sinagoga did not apply to Kong’s moti on to reduce his sentence 
in the first place. Kong, mem. op. at 9. The ICA reasoned only 
that “[t]here is nothing in Sinagoga to suggest that it applies 
HRS § 706- 606 (2014) is titled, “Factors to be considered in imposing a 
sentence,” and it inclu des (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense 
and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the 
sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote 
respect for law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; to afford 
adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; to protect the public from further 
crimes of the defendant; and to provide the defendant with needed educational 
or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; (3) the kinds of sentences available; and (4) the need 
to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar 
records who have been found guilty of similar conduct. 
13
     
 
 
     
 
 Regardless of its holding, the ICA went on to state, “[W]e 
do not suggest that the circuit court should consider 
convictions improperly entered on a PSI report.” Id.   The ICA 
then stated that it did not appear that the circuit court relied on the vacated and dismissed convictions when it denied Kong’s 
motion to reconsider or reduce sentence.  Id.   The ICA noted 
that the circuit court asked Kong’s counsel to file a separate motion to request a correction to the PSI. Id.   Next, the 
circuit court asked Kong whether he had any other convictions besides the overturned ones, and when Kong answered 
affirmatively but asked to be sentenced with regard only to 
valid convictions, the circuit court stated, “I don’t disagree 
with you there.” Id.   Thus, the ICA conclud ed, “[I]t appears 
that the circuit court recognized that some of Kong’s convictions had been vacated and that the court did not rely on those vacated convictions when it denied Kong’s Motion to 
Reconsider or Reduce.”   Kong, mem. op. at 10.   
  
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
to Kong’s motion to reduce his sentence.” Id. The ICA cited no 
other authority for its holding. 
III. Standard of Review 
“A trial court has the discretion to, within the time 
limits set forth by HRPP Rule 35, reduce a sentence.” State v. 
Williams
, 70 Haw. 566, 569, 777 P.2d 1192, 1194 (1989). 
Therefore, orders on HRPP Rule 35 motions for reduction of 
14
     
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
    
 As it raises a threshold issue, we start with Kong’s 
challenge to the ICA’s holding that the Sinagoga  framework does  
not apply on a Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence.  The ICA *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
sentence are reviewed for an abuse of discretion.  “[F]actors 
which indicate a plain and manifest abuse of discretion are 
arbitrary or capricious action by the judge and a rigid refusal 
to consider the defendant’s contentions.” State v. Kahapea,  111 
Hawaii  267, 278, 141 P.3d 440, 451 (2006). “ [G]enerally, to 
constitute an abuse it must appear that the court clearly 
exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles 
of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party 
litigant.” Id.   
IV.  
Discussion 
A.   	A defendant may raise a Sinagoga challenge to a PSI in 
connection with a Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence. 
On certiorari, Kong asks, “Did the ICA gravely err in 
holding that Mr. Kong could not raise a good-faith challenge to 
the use of invalid and vacated prior convictions in his Rule 35 
motion?” Kong argues that it was appropriate for him, after 
Kong I held that Sinagoga applied, to raise a good-faith 
challenge to the inclusion of the vacated and dismissed convictions in his PSI in his Rule 35 motion, and, once the 
challenge was raised, the State and the circuit court should 
have addressed it. 
15
     
 
 
   
  
 
  
  To the contrary, while there is no Hawai i appellate case 
affirmatively holding that a Sinagoga   challenge can be raised in 
a Rule 35 proceeding, there is authority suggesting the same.   
State v. Kido, 109 Hawai i 458, 128 P.3d 340 (2006), is analogous 
to the instant case. In that case, a defendant was charged and 
convicted with promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree 
and unlawful use of drug paraphernalia.  109 Hawai i at 459, 128

 A year after his sentencing as a repeat offender, the ICA 
vacated and remanded for a new trial the drug and paraphernalia 
convictions that had provided a basis for his repeat offender 
sentence. Id.   The defendant then moved, under HRPP Rule  35(a), 
to correct an illegal sentence.  Id.   The circuit court denied 
the motion, and the defendant appealed. Id.   (The defendant was 
later convicted of the drug and paraphernalia charges at his new 
trial. 109 Hawai i at 461, 128 P.3d at 343.)  
 This court held that the circuit court  erred in denying the 
defendant’s Rule 35 motion (although the error was moot, as the 
defendant had been convicted of both charges at his new trial). 
109 Hawai i at 463, 128 P.3d at 345. This court held, “[A] 
defendant is entitled, by timely HRPP Rule 35  motion to correct 
sentence . . . once the defendant has successfully attacked a 
prior conviction on which the sentence was based in whole or 
part because that conviction no longer constitutes a proper 
basis for increased punishment for a subsequent offense under 
HRS § 706-606.5,” Hawaii’s repeat offender sentencing statute .

paraphernalia convictions (that he had appealed). 109 Hawai i at 
460, 128 P.3d at 342. 
The facts in Kido differ in three respects. 
First, the 
defendant in Kido moved under subsection (a) of HRPP Rule 35 to 
17

     
 
 
   
 
 
 
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
correct an illegal  sentence, while Kong moved under subsection  
(b) of the rule to reduce his sentence.  Second, the defendant  
in Kido challenged the imposition of a mandatory minimum 
sentence as a repeat offender, while Kong challenged the 
erroneous inclusion o
f vacated and dismissed convictions in the 
PSI as a basis for his consecutive sentence.  Third, the defendant in Kido  did not expressly bring a Sinagoga  challenge 
in his Rule 35 motion, while Kong did in his.  
Kido is, however, still analogous 
to this case. The holding 
quoted above clearly applies to Kong. In addition, the relief 
sought under subsections (a) and (b) under HRPP Rule 35 differ 
only in degree; while subsection (a) allows correction of a 
sentence in violation of the law, subsection (b) allows 
reduction of a sentence that, while lawful, may nevertheless be 
too harsh. See HRPP Rule 35 (a) and (b); United States v. 
Maynard, 485 F.2d 247, 248 (9th Cir. 1973) (“If a lawful sentence was lawfully imposed in the first instance, then the function of Rule 35 is simply to allow the [sentencing] court to 
decide if, on further reflection, the original sentence now 
seems unduly harsh. ”). 
Second, it does not matter that the defendants in Kido and 
Kong challenged different types of sentencing (i.e., repeat 
offender sentencing in Kido
, and consecutive sentencing in 
Kong). The Sinagoga  rule applies to ordinary sentencing.  
18

     
 
 
  
 
 
 
 Third, although Kido  did not involve an express Sinagoga  
challenge, the functional similarities between the Kido  
defendant’s challenge and Kong’s challenge to the use of invalid 
convictions in sentencing override differences in form. Both 
Kido and Kong had two convictions vacated by the ICA, yet both 
defendants were subsequently sentenced as though those two prior 
convictions remained valid. Both defendants brought Rule 35 motions seeking re-evaluation of their sentences.  This court in 
Kido held that a Rule 35(a) challenge should have been allowed 
to correct the illegal mandatory minimum sentence.  Therefore, 
we now similarly hold that a defendant may bring a Sinagoga  
challenge in a Rule 35(b) motion seeking to reduce a sentence.  
 Moreover, disallowing a Sinagoga  challenge on a Rule 35 
motion to reconsider would not seem consistent with HRPP Rule 2 
(1977), which provides that the Hawai i Rules of Penal Procedure 
“are intended to provide for the just determination of every 
penal proceeding. They shall be construed to secure simplicity 
in procedure, fairness in administration and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay.” Disallowing a Sinagoga  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
Sinagoga, 81 Hawai i at 440, 918 P.2d at 247. Sinagoga itself 
noted that repeat offender sentencing and consecutive sentencing are both subject to “ordinary sentencing procedures.” 
Id.  
Therefore, a 
Sinagoga challenge may be brought in either 
sentencing context.

  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
challenge in a Rule 35 motion to reconsider sentence  --
effectively requiring a criminal defendant to file a  Rule 40 
post-conviction petition alleging ineffective assistance of his 
original counsel in not bringing the erroneous convictions in 
the PSI to the attention of the original sentencing judge, 
assuming a defendant would even  be aware of such a possibility   
-- would not further simplicity in procedure, fairness in 
administration, and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and 
delay. In short, a defendant may bring a Sinagoga   challenge in 
connection with a Rule 35 motion.    
B.   
	The circuit court erred in abandoning Kong’s Sinagoga 
challenge due to its mistaken belief that Kong I precluded 
its re-evaluation of Kong’s sentence. 
Having held that the circuit court had the power to 
entertain Kong’s Sinagoga challenge in connection with his Rule 
35 motion, we now examine the circuit court’s handling of the 
matter. On certiorari, Kong’s remaining question presented is, 
“Did the Intermediate Court of Appeals gravely err when it held 
that the lower court may abdicate its power to independently 
review, reconsider, and reduce an original sentence thereby 
undermining the policies and purposes of HRPP Rule 35?” He 
argues that the circuit court possessed the independent discretion to re-evaluate Kong’s sentence and reduce it if it 
was unduly harsh. Kong points out that the circuit court itself 
expressed that it did not understand why Judge Raffetto imposed 
20
     
 
 
   
  
  
 To the extent Kong’s first argument implies that the 
circuit court had full discretion to reconsider Judge Raffetto’s 
sentence without any additional facts, he is incorrect.  With 
respect to the effect of having a different judge reconsider a 
ruling by a prior judge in a criminal case, State v. Oughterson, 
99 Hawai i 244, 253, 54 P.3d 415, 424 (2002), states, “Unless 
cogent reasons support the second court’s action, any 
modification of a prior ruling of another court of equal and 
concurrent jurisdiction will be deemed an abuse of discretion. . 
. .” This criminal rule is not, however, an absolute rule. A 
“change in the factual underpinning [in] a particular ruling may 
rise to the level of a ‘cogent reason’ that would justify a court in overturning the ruling of another court of equal and 
concurrent jurisdiction.” 99 Hawai i at 254, 54 P.3d at 425.  
 Thus, contrary to Kong ’s assertion, the circuit court could 
not change the prior judge’s sentence without cogent reasons. 
It appears, however, that the erroneous inclusion of two felony *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
consecutive sentences; nevertheless, the circuit court still 
declined to reconsider Kong’s sentence. Kong also contends that 
the circuit court erroneously concluded that this court would 
have sua sponte evaluated Kong’s sentence and remanded it if it 
was unjust. Kong argues that the refusal to exercise discretion 
is itself an abuse of discretion, citing to cases from other 
jurisdictions in support of that proposition.  
21
     
 
 
  
 
 
 
    
 
 
 These statements indicate the circuit court thought it was 
unable to reconsider the prior judge’s sentence not because of 
“comity” reasons, but because it thought this court had already 
passed judgment on the justness and fairness of Kong’s sentence . *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
convictions in the PSI would constitute a “cogent reason” for 
the circuit court to reconsider Kong’s sentence. We need not decide this issue at this time, however, because the circuit 
court also based its refusal to reconsider on an erroneous 
interpretation of the effect of this court’s ruling in 
Kong I.  
On remand, the circuit court should first address whether cogent reasons exist to reconsider Judge Raffetto’s sentence.    
Kong’s alternative argument, tha t the circuit court 
erroneously considered this court’s Kong 
I 
opinion to preclude 
his independent re- evaluation of Kong’s sentence, however, has 
merit. At an initial hearing on Kong’s motion to reconsider or reduce sentence, the circuit court stated, “I’m not suggesting 
to you [defense counsel] that I’m going to do anything different 
[regarding sentencing] than what’s already been done. 
Because 
it’s already gone up on appeal .” (Emphasis added.) At a later 
hearing, the circuit court elaborated its reasoning as follows: 
This has already been –- this sentence was appealed, and 
the Supreme Court reviewed it, and if the Supreme Court 
felt -- I understand the grounds when they look at these 
things. But the appellate court –- the appellate court has 
really scrutinized a lot of these cases, especially with 
the compositio n of our present court. Even if it wasn’t 
raised, if they feel this was inherently unjust or unfair, 
they would have sent it back, and they didn’t.  
22

     
 
 
   
 In this regard, the circuit court seemed to reference the 
Kong I  majority’s holding that the circuit court did not plainly 
err in relying on the inaccurate PSI in imposing consecutive 
sentences. 131 Hawai i at 107, 315 P.3d at 733. To the circuit 
court, had this court held that Kong’s sentence amounted to 
plain error and remanded the case for re-sentencing, then it 
would be appropriate to revisit Kong’s sentence . This reasoning 
is erroneous, as it conflates the result of a direct appeal with what may be possible in a motion for post-conviction relief.  
Even though a plain error review on direct appeal may result in affirmance of a sentence because the high plain  error standard 
of “affecting substantial rights” was not met, Kong’s sentence 
can be reconsidered by a different sentencing judge under HRPP 
Rule 35 at the judge’s discretion (a lower standard), as long as 
cogent reasons exist. Therefore, in this case, the circuit court was not precluded,  by this court’s affirmance of Kong’s 
sentence in Kong I, from  re-evaluating Kong’s sentence on a Rule 
35 motion.     
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
The circuit court’s interpretation of the effect of this court’s 
opinion in Kong I was incorrect. 
In connection with his Rule 35 motion, Kong presented the 
circuit court with evidence that two vacated and dismissed prior 
convictions were erroneously included in his PSI, and that his 
consecutive sentence should be re-evaluated in light of this 
23
     
 
 
  Kong’s argument is persuasive. Again, the five steps in 
the Sinagoga   framework are  
 
Sinagoga, 81 Hawai i at 447, 918 P.2d at 254 (as modified by 
Veikoso, 102 Hawai i 219, 74 P.3d 575).  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
mistake. In other words, Kong brought a Sinagoga   challenge to 
his PSI as part of his Rule 35 motion. In response to his 
challenge, however, Kong notes, “Nothing happened here.”   
Neither the State nor the circuit court addressed whether the prior convictions were indeed invalid. As Kong argues, the  
State and the circuit court simply abandoned compliance with the Sinagoga framework.    
Step one, the court shall furnish to the defendant or 
defendant’s counsel and to the prosecuting attorney a copy 
of the presentence report, HRS § 70 6-604, and any other 
report of defendant’s prior criminal conviction(s). Step two, if the defendant contends that one or more of the 
reported prior criminal convictions was (1) uncounseled,   
. . . and/or ([2]) not against the defendant, the defendant 
shall, prior to the sentencing, respond with a good faith 
challenge on the record stating, as to each challenged 
conviction, the basis or bases for the challenge. Step 
three, prior to imposing the sentence, the court shall 
inform the defendant that (a) each reported criminal 
conviction that is not validly challenged by the defendant 
is defendant’s prior, counseled, validly entered, criminal 
conviction, and (b) a challenge to any reported prior 
criminal conviction not made by defendant before sentence is imposed may not thereafter, absent good cause, be raised 
to attack the court’s sentence. Step four, with respect to 
each reported prior criminal conviction that the defendant 
challenges, the [Hawai i Rules of Evidence] shall apply, and 
the court shall expressly decide before the sentencing 
whether the State satisfied its burden of proving to the reasonable satisfaction of the court that the opposite of 
the defendant’s challenge is true. Step five, if the court 
is aware of the defendant’s prior uncounseled or o therwise 
invalid criminal conviction(s), it shall not impose or enhance a prison sentence prior to expressly stating on the record that it did not consider it or them as a basis for 
the imposition or enhancement of a prison sentence.  
24

     
 
 
  
 
  
  
   
   
 
 
 
 
                     
    
 
9   It is true that the circuit court to ld Kong, “I don’t disagree with you 
there,” in response to Kong’s statement that his sentence should be based 
only on valid, not invalid, convictions. This statement, however, falls 
short of “expressly stating on the record that [the circuit court] did no t 
consider [invalid convictions] as a basis for the imposition or enhancement of a prison sentence,” or, in this case, the denial of a motion to reduce 
sentence, as Sinagoga  would require. See Sinagoga , 81 Hawai i at 447, 918 
P.2d at 254.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
In this case, through a “Written Notice of Objection to the 
Pre-Sentence Report and Other Materials Contained in the Court 
File,” made in connection with his Rule 35 motion to reconsider 
or reduce sentence, Kong complied with the second step in the Sinagoga framework by challenging the inclusion of the two 
vacated and dismissed convictions in the PSI. The State did not 
respond. There is nothing in the record to reflect that the 
circuit court took any action on the written notice.
8 Further, 
the circuit court did not expressly state on the record that it 
did not consider the two convictions in denying Kong’s motion to 
9reconsider or reduce sentence.
Having decided that Sinagoga applies in Rule 35 motion 
proceedings, and that the circuit court was not precluded by 
Kong I from re-evaluating Kong’s sentence, we hold that it was 
error for the circuit court to abandon Kong’s Sinagoga challenge 
to the erroneous inclusion of two vacated and dismissed prior convictions in his PSI.
