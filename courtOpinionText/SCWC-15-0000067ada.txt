2 We first conclude that Hernandez’s challenge to his sentence was 
not precluded by his plea of no contest.  We also hold that 
Hernandez’s right of all ocution, which is protect ed by the 
Hawaii Revised Statutes and the Hawai i Constitution,  was 
violated when the district court did not afford him the 
opportunity to be heard prior to being sentenced.  Lastly, we 
conclude that the district court’s acceptance  of Hernandez’s no 
contest plea without an on- the-record colloquy was plain error.  
We thus vacate Hernandez’s conviction and remand the case to the 
district court for further proceedings consistent with this 
opinion.   
I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
  On November 6, 201 4, the State of Hawai i charged 
Pierre Hernandez by complaint in the District Court of the First 
Circuit (district court) with harassment by stalking in 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS ) § 711-1106.5.1   
                     
 1 HRS § 711 -1106.5 (1993 & Supp. 2013) provides the following:  
(1) A person commits the offense of harassment by stalking 
if, with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm another person, 
or in reckless disregard of the risk thereof, that person 
engages in a course of conduct involving pursuit, 
surveillance, or nonconsensual  contact upon the other 
person on more than one occasion without legitimate 
purpose.  
(2) A person convicted under this section may be required 
to undergo a counseling program as ordered by the court.  
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
3   On January 6, 2015, Hernandez through counsel filed a 
“Rule 43 Plea by Mail ” (“plea by mail document” or “the 
document”) pursuant to Rule 43 of the Hawai i Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP).2 The document  indicated  that Hernandez was 
                                                                  
(. . . continued) 
 
(3) For purposes of this section, “nonconsensual contact” 
means any contact that occurs without that individual’s 
consent or in disregard of that person’s express desire 
that the contact be avoided or discontinued.  Nonconsensual 
contact includes direct personal visual or oral contact and 
contact via telephone, facsimile, or any form of electronic 
communication, as defined in section 711 -1111(2), including 
electronic mail transmission.  
(4) Harassment by stalking is a misdemeanor.  
 2 HRPP Rule 43 (201 2) provides in relevant part as follows:  
(a) Presence required.  The defendant shall be present at 
the arraignment, at the time of the plea, at evidentiary 
pretrial hearings, at every stage of the trial including 
the impaneling of the jury and the return of the verdict, 
and at the imposition of sentence, except as otherwise 
provided by this Rule.  
. . . . 
(d) Presence may be waived for non -felony offenses.  In 
prosecutions for offenses other than a felony, the court 
may: 
. . . . 
(2) conduct an arraignment in the defendant’s absence, if 
the defendant’s residence  is out-of-state or on another 
island, the defendant consents in writing, and a plea of 
guilty or no contest is  
 (A) accepted and sentence is imposed; or  
 (B) offered and acceptance is deferred.  Except for 
the requirement of addressing the defendant 
personally in open court, the court shall otherwise 
comply with the requirements of Rule 11 and Rule 32 
of these Rules.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
4 pleading no contest to the charged offense of harassment by 
stalking.  It also stated that Hernandez understood that (1) he 
had the right to be present at various proceedings, including 
arraignment, the entry of plea, and sentencing; (2)  he was 
voluntarily waiving his right to be present at these proceedings  
and to be questioned in open court;  and (3) he was authorizing 
his lawyer to represent him at the proceedings.   
  In addition, the plea by mail document  stated that 
Hernandez was consenting to the court’s imposition of a sentence 
in his absence and that he understood “that non -compliance with 
the court’s judgment or order will result in the issuance of a 
bench warrant, subjecting [him] to being arrested and having to 
appear in court.”  Further, the document include d a declaration 
by counsel, stating that Hernandez represented to him that he 
did not wish to be present and wished for the proceedings to be 
conducted in his absence;  that counsel read and explained the 
plea by mail document to Hernandez ; and that the statements in 
the document  were consistent with counsel’s understanding of 
Hernandez’s position.3   
                     
 3 The plea by mail  document also contained language conforming to 
many of the requirements set forth in HRPP Rule 11.  T he document state d that 
Hernandez understood the following: the charge against him; that he was 
giving up the right to a trial by jury or the court; the maximum penalty, 
which the document states was one year in jail and a fine of $2,000; and the 
potential effect of a conviction  on the immigration and naturalization rights  
of non-U.S. citizens.   However, the document did not describe the conduct 
underlying the charge or that Hernandez understood that he had the right to 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
5   At a hearing on January 7, 2015,4 counsel for Hernandez 
indicated that Hernandez, who was not present, was residing in 
another state and had requested deferred  acceptance of his no 
contest plea.   The district court stated that it was in receipt 
of the plea by mail document submitted by counsel that indicated 
Hernandez had completed twelve years of education,  was aware of 
the charge against him, and understood his possible defenses, as 
well as the maximum possible penalties and any potential 
citizenship issues a conviction might raise.  Although Hernandez 
was not physically present and there was no established 
communication with him at the hearing, the court accepted the no 
contest plea, ruling that the plea  was made knowingly, 
intelligently, and voluntarily.   The court further concluded 
that Hernandez  knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived 
his right to a jury trial based on a waiver of j ury trial form 
also submitted by defense counsel.  The court then found 
Hernandez guilty as charged and proceeded to sentencing.   
  Before the court imposed sentence, t he complainant 
provided a statement to the court in which she objected to the 
                                                                  
(. . . continued) 
 
plead not guilty, as required by HRPP Rule 11(c).  The document also made no 
reference to Hernandez’s right to allocution prior to sentencing.  
 4 The Honorable Lono J. Lee presided.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
6 granting of a deferral and stated, inter alia, that another 
complainant had filed a restraining order against Hernandez and 
that the court should impose jail time.  The court  thereupon 
denied Hernandez’s motion for deferral  of acceptance of the no 
contest plea and  restated that Hernandez had signed all the 
waiver documents; that his no contest plea was made knowingly, 
intelligently, and voluntarily; and that the court had found him 
guilty.  The district court sentenced Hernandez to a 
probationary term of eighteen  months condition ed on Hernandez 
serving thirty days in jail and two hundred hours of community 
service and also imposed fees totaling $130.  The court sta ted 
that, if Hernandez was not returning to Hawai i, a mittimus was 
to issue forthwith.  After c ounsel for Hernandez indicated that 
he would send the paperwork to Hernandez and inform him that the 
court was ordering him to appear on February 9, 2015, the court 
delayed the mittimus until that date.5   
  Hernandez appealed to the Intermediate Court of 
Appeals (ICA) from the district court’s judgment entered on 
January 7, 2015 ,6 “and all trial and pre -trial motions filed or 
made by Defendant, that were denied by the Court. ”7   
                     
 5 On February 9, 2015, the court continued the stay of the mittimus 
pending appeal.   
 6 On the same day he filed the notice of appeal to the ICA, counsel 
for Hernandez filed a motion to withdraw as counsel, in which he stated that

7 II. ICA PROCEEDINGS 
  In his opening brief, H ernandez argu ed that the 
district court committed plain error when it violated his 
constitutional and statutory right of allocution , which he had 
not waived,  by failing to give him an opportunity to make a 
statement prior to being sentenced.  This court, Hernandez 
contended, has previously questioned whether the denial of 
presentence allocution constitutes harmless error
 and has stated 
that the remedy under such circumstances is a remand for 
resentencing.  In addition, Hernandez asserted  that the district 
court did not personally address him,  whereas the complainant 
was permitted to provide a lengthy statement, which included an 
objection to a possible deferral, an 
entreaty  to impose jail 
time, and a reference to a separate restraining order against 
Hernandez.  Hernandez concluded that the denial of his right to 
                                                                  
(. . . continued) 
 
his agreement with Hernandez ended at sentencing and that he filed the notice 
of appeal to preserve Hernandez’s r ight to appeal because of the impending 
expiration of the thirty -day deadline for filing the appeal.  The district 
court granted the motion on February 9, 2015 , and referred Hernandez to the 
Office of the Public Defender, which filed a notice of appearance  on April 
23, 2015.   
 7 Although the quoted language appears in  the notice of appeal, the 
record indicates that there were no “trial and pre -trial motions” by 
Hernandez other than the motion for deferred acceptance of the no contest 
plea.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
8 allocution deprived him of his constitutional right to due 
process under article I, section 5 of the Hawai i Constitution.8   
 
 In its answering brief, the State argued that the ICA 
lacked appellate jurisdiction because Hernandez asserted 
nonjurisdictional claims, which were precluded by the entry of 
an intelligent and voluntary guilty plea.  Because Hernandez did 
not file a motion to withdraw his plea and his plea was not made 
on the condition that he may appeal certain rulings,  the State 
submitted that the case should be dismissed.   
  Alternatively, the State contended that Hernandez’s no 
contest plea complied with HRPP Rule 11, adding that the 
district court ensured that his plea was voluntary  and not the 
product of threats or promises.   As to Hernande z’s argument 
regarding his right of allocution, the State maintained that 
HRPP Rule 43(d)(2) does not require the court to address the 
defendant, and in any event, Hernandez voluntarily waived his 
right to be present at all proceedings, including sentencing,  
authorized his counsel to represent him at sentencing, and 
waived his right to be questioned in open court.  Thus, the 
                     
 8 Hernandez also argued that the district court  committed plain 
error when it accepted his no contest plea without administering the 
advisement concerning alien status prior to the entry of a plea of nolo 
contendere pursuant to HRS § 802E -2.  Inasmuch as this argument is not raised 
on certiorari, it is not further addressed.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
9 State argued, Hernandez’s no contest plea was valid under HRPP 
Rule 32 (2012).9   
  
In his reply, Hernandez contended t hat the State’s 
argument regarding jurisdiction lacked  merit because an 
appellate court may review an invalid no contest plea under 
plain error, as in this case.  Although his  counsel informed the 
court that he would enter a no contest plea, Hernandez asserted, 
“it was nonetheless incumbent on the court to address the 
defendant personally. ”  Hernandez maintained that the court in 
accepting a guilty plea cannot rely  solely on counsel’s  presence 
and representations,  concluding that an on- the-record colloquy 
was, at a minimum, required to show that he had full 
understanding of the no contest plea and its consequences.   
  On March 17, 2017, the ICA entered a summary 
disposition order affirming the district court’s judgment .10  The 
ICA rejected Hernandez’s contention that the district court 
plainly erred by not personally addressing him regarding his 
                     
 9 HRPP Rule 32(a) provides in relevant part as follows:  
After adjudication of guilt, sentence shall be imposed 
without unreasonable delay.  Pending sentence, the court 
may commit the defendant or continue or alter bail, subject 
to applicable provisions of law.  Before suspending or 
imposing sentence, the court shall address the defendant 
personally and afford a fair opportunity to the defendant 
and defendant’s counsel, if any, to make a statement and 
present any information in mitigation of punishment.  
 10 The ICA’s summary disposition order can be found at State v. 
Hernandez, NO. CAAP- 15-0000067, 2017 WL 1034487 (Haw. App. Mar. 17, 2017).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
10 right of allocution prior to imposing sentence.  The ICA 
concluded that Hernandez’s claims were not jurisdictional, that 
he did not file a motion to withdraw his no contest plea, and 
that his plea was not conditional.   The ICA t hus concluded that 
Hernandez was “precluded from ‘later asserting any 
nonjurisdictional claims [to his no contest plea], including 
constitutional challenges to the pretrial procee dings.’”  
(Quoting State v. Morin, 71 Haw. 159, 162-63, 785 P. 2d 1316, 
1318-19 (1990).)   
III.  STANDARD OF REVIEW 
  We review questions of law under the right/wrong 
standard.  State v. Gomez-Lobato , 130 Hawai i 465, 469, 312 P.3d 
897, 901 (2013) (citing State v. Friedman, 93 Hawaii 63, 67, 996 
P.2d 268, 272 (2000)).    
IV. DISCUSSION 
  On certiorari, Hernandez presents two questions for 
review: (1) whether the ICA erred in rejecting his appeal of the 
district court’s denial of his right of allocution at sentencing 
on the basis that the challenge was precluded by his no contest 
plea and (2) whether the district court plainly erred in 
accepting his no contest plea when it was not made knowingly, 
intelligently, and voluntarily.  The first question consists of 
two subpa rts: (a) whether Hernandez was  barred from challenging 
the manner in which his sentence  was imposed because he pleaded ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
11 no contest to the charge and (b)  whether the district court ’s 
failure to personally address Hernandez prior to imposing 
sentence violated  his right of allocution.  We consider these 
issues below.   
A.
 Hernandez’s Challenge to the Legality o f His Sentence 
1. The ICA Erred in Rejecting Hernandez’s Claim  on the Basis 
that It Was Nonjurisdictional.  
  Hernandez contends that the ICA erred in concluding 
that he was barred from asserting  that the district court 
deprived him of his right of allocution because it was a 
nonjurisdictional claim.  Hernandez reason s that a llocution 
arises during sentencing-- after the plea has been accepted-- and 
Hawaii courts have distinguished between challenges made to 
events that occur before the plea and those that occur after the 
plea.   
  We have held that “[g]enerally, a guilty plea made 
voluntarily and intelligently precludes a defendant from later 
asserting any nonjurisdictional claims, including constitutional 
challenges to the pretrial proceedings.”  State v. Morin, 71 
Haw. 159, 162, 785 P.2d 1316, 1318 (1990) (citing Brady v. 
United States, 397 U.S. 742 (1970)).  A no contest plea is 
equivalent to a guilty plea in terms of waiving alleged 
nonjurisdictional claims.  Id.    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
12   Pretrial nonjurisdictional defects-- such as unlawfully 
obtained evidence and illegal detention by law enforcement-- are 
pretrial errors that do not deprive a trial court of its legal 
authority to hear and decide a case , and challenges to such 
errors generally will not survive a validly entered plea of 
guilty or nolo contendere.  
See Schwartz v. State, 136 Hawai i 
258, 281, 361 P.3d 1161, 1184 (2015); Morin, 71 Haw. at 162, 785 
P.2d at 1318.  In State v.  Morin, for example, the defendants 
were charged with various drug  and firearm- related offenses.  71 
Haw. at 160, 785 P.2d at 1317.  The defendants filed a motion to 
suppress all evidence obtained by law enforcement.  Id. at 161, 
785 P.2d at 1318.  Following the district court’s denial of the 
motion to suppress, the defendants entered no contest pleas in 
exchange for a reduction and dismissal of charges against them.  
Id.  
On appeal, the defendants challenged the district court’s 
denial of their motion to suppress; they did not challenge the 
validity of their no contest pleas.  Id.  at 162, 785 P.2d at 
1318.  This court held that the defendants’ pleas precluded them 
from challenging any nonjurisdictional issues.  Id. at 163, 785 
P.2d at 1319.  We stated,  
To allow the Defendants to plead no contest in exchange for 
the reduction and dismissal of charges against them, and 
then to permit them to attack the remaining convictions 
achieved by those pleas, where those pleas were not 
conditioned upon the right to appeal, would jeopardize the 
integrity of the plea bargaining process.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
13 Id.  Thus, based on Morin, a defendant who validly pleads guilty 
or no contest to a charged offense is generally barred from 
raising nonjurisdictional claims related to pretrial proceedings 
when the plea is not expressly conditioned upon the right to 
appeal specific rulings.  Id.  at 162, 785 P.2d at 1319.  But 
Morin’s holding applies to only pretrial errors  occurring before 
the valid entry of a  plea, and--unless a sentencing agreement 
establishes the details of the defendant’s sentence before the 
plea is entered--it d oes not extend to matters related to 
sentencing.  See State v. Dudoit, 90 Hawai i 262, 265 n.2, 978 
P.2d 700, 703 n.2 (1999). 
  This court has in fact expressly stated that, absent a 
prior sentencing agreement between the defendant and the State, 
a defendant is not barred by a guilty or no contest plea from 
raising nonjurisdictional claims related to sentencing on 
appeal.  In State v. Dudoit,  the defendant pleaded no contest to 
two counts of abuse of a family or household member.  Id.  at 
264-65, 978 P.2d at 702- 03.  After accepting the defendant’s no 
contest pleas, the family court proceeded to sentencing, at 
which the parties disputed the applicability of a statutory 
repeat offender provision.  Id.  at 265, 978 P.2d at 703.  The 
family court concluded that the provision  did apply and 
sentenced the defendant accordingly .  Id.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
14   On appeal, the defendant solely challenged  his 
sentence.  Id. at 263, 978 P.2d at 701.  T his court found that 
there was no indication in the record that the defendant agreed 
upon the sentence to be imposed.  Id. at 265 n.2, 978 P.2d at 
703 n.2.  We stated
 that a “sentence is determined after a plea 
is accepted, and (absent a prior agreement between the parties) 
a defendant cannot know what sentence will be imposed.”  Id.  We 
thus held that  the defendant’s no contest plea s did not preclude  
him from challenging his sentence, and we therefore considered 
the merits of the defendant’s appeal .  Id. at 265 n.2, 267 -75, 
978 P.2d at 703 n.2, 705 -13; see also State v. Rauch , 94 Hawaii 
315, 323, 13 P.3d 324, 332 (2000) (holding that the defendant’s 
challenge to the legality of her  sentence was not foreclosed by 
a no contest plea).   
  In concluding that Hernandez’s claims were barred by 
his no contest plea, the ICA determined that Hernandez did not 
file a motion to withdraw his plea and that the “no contest plea 
was not condition al.”  As stated, however, a defendant’s 
challenge to the legality of a sentence, including the manner in 
which the sentence was imposed, is not barred by a guilty or no 
contest plea absent a prior sentencing agreement between the 
defendant and the State.  The record in this case lacks any 
indication that Hernandez entered into an agreement with the 
State as to the sentence to be imposed.  Rather, the plea by ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
15 mail document stated only that Hernandez was waiving his right 
to be present at sentencing and to be questioned in open court.  
Thus, Hernandez was not required to file a motion to  withdraw 
his plea in order to assert nonjurisdictional claims related to 
sentencing on appeal.  See Rauch, 94 Hawai i at 323, 13 P.3d at 
332 (considering the merits of an appeal of sentence without 
regard to whether 
the defendant ha d filed a motion to withdraw a 
no contest plea); Dudoit , 90 Hawaii at 265-75, 978 P.2d at 703-
13 (same).  
  Further , the ICA’s alternative ground for concluding 
that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the appeal in this case-
-that Hernandez’s no contest plea was not conditional --is 
inapposite.  A conditional plea is employed when the defendant 
seeks to challenge on appeal a ruling involving a pretrial 
motion, which is a circumstance that is not present in this 
case.  HRPP Rule 11(a)(2)  (2014) states in relevant part, “ With 
the approval of the court and the consent of the State, a 
defendant may enter a conditional plea of guilty or no contest, 
reserving in writing the right, on appeal from the judgment, to 
seek review of the adverse determination of any specific 
pretrial motion.”  (Emphases added.)  Hernandez does not seek 
review of an “adverse determina tion of any specific pretrial 
motion,” but rather,  the manner in which his sentence was ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
16 imposed following the district court ’s acceptance of  his no 
contest plea.  
 
 Consequently, the ICA erred in concluding that 
Hernandez’s assertion of nonjurisdictional claims regarding his 
sentencing on appeal was barred by his no contest plea.   
2. The District Court Erred i n Denying Hernandez t he Right of 
Allocution.  
  HRPP Rule 43(d)(2)(A)  (2012) permits a court to 
conduct an arraignment in the absence of a defendant who pleads 
guilty or no contest to non-felony offenses if the defendant 
resides out of state or on another island, the defendant 
consents in writing, and the plea is accepted and sentence is 
imposed.  Under such circumstances, the penal rule allows a 
court to dispense with the requirement of addressing the 
defendant personally in open court.  See  HRPP Rule 43(d)(2)(B ) 
(cross-referencing HRPP Rule 32(a) (2012)).  On certiorari, 
Hernandez contends that, while he waived his right to be present 
at sentencing, he did not waive his right of allocution and was 
denied this right 
when he was not afforded  an opportunity to 
speak prior to the imposi tion of sentence.   
  “Allocution is ‘the defendant ’s right to speak before 
sentence is imposed[.] ’”  State v. Chow, 77 Hawaii 241, 246, 883 
P.2d 663, 668 (App. 1994) (alteration in original) (quoting R. 
Dawson, Sentencing 52 n.83 (1969)).   We have stated that ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
17 allocution is a due process right guaranteed under article I, 
section 5 of the Hawai i Constitution.11  State v. Davia, 87 
Hawai
i 249, 255, 953 P.2d 1347, 1353 (1998) (citing Chow, 77 
Hawaii at 246-47, 883 P.2d at  668-69).  In addition, HRS § 706-
604(1) (2014) provides, “Before imposing sentence , the court 
shall afford a fair opportunity to the defendant to be heard on 
the issue of the defendant’s disposition.”  (Emphasis added. )  
Similarly, HRPP Rule 32(a) requires that the court, prior to 
imposing sentence, “address the defendant personally and afford 
a fair opportunity to the defendant and defendant’s counsel, if 
any, to make a statement and present any information in 
mitigation of punishment. ”  (Emphases added .)  
  It is undisputed that,  after accepting Hernandez’s no 
contest plea and finding him guilty, the district court in this 
case did not address Hernandez personally and afford him an  
opportunity to make a statement and present information in 
mitigation of punishment before proceeding to sentencing.  The 
court heard from the complainant, reiterated that it had already 
found Hernandez guilty, and imposed sentence.  In its answering 
                     
 11 Article I, section 5 of the Hawai i Constitution provides as 
follows: “No person shall be  deprived of life, liberty or property without 
due process of law, nor be denied the equal protection of the laws, nor be 
denied the enjoyment of the person’ s civil rights or be discriminated against 
in the exercise thereof because of race, religion, sex o r ancestry.”  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
18 brief, however,  the State contended that the court was not 
required to address Hernandez personally because he had waived 
his right to be present at sentencing pursuant to HRPP Rule 43.   
  
While HRPP Rule 43 permits a defendant who pleads 
guilty or no contest to non-felony offenses to waive the right 
to be present at sentencing and allows the court to forego the 
requirement of HRPP Rule 32(a) that it
 personally address the 
12defendant,  nothing in the plea by mail 
document signed by 
Hernandez evinces that he was informed or otherwise knew of his 
right of allocution.  
“A waiver is ordinarily an intentional 
relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.”  
Reponte v. State, 57 Haw. 354, 361, 556 P.2d 577, 583 (1976) 
(emphasis added) (quoting Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464 
(1938)); accord State v. Friedman, 93 Hawai i 63, 68, 996 P.2d 
268, 273 (2000) (“A waiver is the knowing, intelligent, and 
voluntary relinquishment of a known  right.” (emphasis added)); 
State v. Barros, 105 Hawai i 160, 168, 95 P.3d 14, 22 (App. 2004) 
(same).  Because the record lacks any indication that Hernandez 
knew of his “right to speak before sentence is imposed,” Chow, 
77 Hawai i at 246, 883 P.2d at 668 (quoting Dawson, supra, at 52 
                     
 12 As previously set forth, HRPP Rule 43(d)(2)(B) provides in 
relevant part as follows: “ Except for the requirement of addressing the 
defendant personally in open court, the court shall otherwise comply with the 
requirements of Rule 11 and Rule 32 of these Rules. ” ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
19 n.83), it follows then that Hernandez could not have waived this 
right.13   
  But  even if HRPP Rule 43 is deemed to have excused the 
court from the allocution requirement of HRPP Rule 32(a),  HRS § 
706-604(1) separately requires that the court afford the 
14defendant an opportunity to be heard prior to sentencing.   As 
noted, HRS § 706-604(1) states, “Before imposing sentence, the 
court shall afford a fair opportunity to the defendant to be 
                     
 13 Citing various portions of the plea by mail document purporting 
to be waivers of Hernandez’s  right to be present and right to be questioned 
in open court, the dissent argues that Hernandez knowingly relinquished his 
right “to engage with the court in -person at both sentencing and plea -entry,” 
which it views as encompassing the right to allocution.  Dissent at 1 5.  But 
the dissent identifies nothing in the record evincing that Hernandez 
understood he would have been afforded the right to allocution if he were 
present at sentencing, and it is axiomatic that Hernandez could not knowingly 
waive a right he was unaware he possessed.  See F riedman, 93 Hawai ‘i at 68, 
996 P.2d at 273 (“A waiver is the knowing, intelligent, and voluntary 
relinquishment of a known  right.” (emphasis added)) .  The dissent also points 
to the declaration of Hernandez’ s counsel stating that he (the counsel) had 
explained the right to be present and the plea by mail document to Hernandez.  
Yet this declaration, too, has no  specific reference to the right of 
allocution, and, as discussed infra, this court has stated that it will not 
rely on the representations of counsel or speculate about the substance of 
off-the-record, privileged communications to establish a knowing and 
voluntary waiver.  See  State v. Ui, 142 Hawai ‘i 287, 299, 418 P.3d 628, 640 
(2018) (citing State v. Eduwensuyi, 141 Hawai ‘i 328, 336, 409 P.3d 732, 740 
(2018)).  Thus, even were we to hold that a waiver of all rights related to 
in-person engagement with the court could be accomplished  through the 
submission of a waiver document or other filing  without any interaction 
between the defendant and the court--which would be fundamentally at odds 
with our longstanding precedents, see  infra note 16 and Section IV.B--the 
filings in this case would be facially inadequate to establish such a waiver.  
 14 It is self -evident that while a court rule may provide an 
exception to another court rule, this exception would have no effect upon the 
statutory or constitutional right of allocution.   See In re Doe Children , 94 
Hawaii 485, 486, 17 P.3d 217, 218 (2001)  (stating that when there is a 
conflict between a court  rule
 and a statute, the statute is controlling ).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
20 heard on the issue of the defendant’s disposition.”  (Emphasis 
added.)   
  In addition to this statutory mandate, allocution is a 
significant right to which the Hawaii Constitution affords 
protection.  We have stated that the right of allocution is 
guaranteed under the due process clause of the Hawai i 
Constitution.  Davia, 87 Hawai i at 255, 953 P.2d at 1353 (citing 
Chow, 77 Hawai i at 246-47, 883 P.2d at 668 -69).  That is, a 
trial court is constitutionally required to accord a defendant 
the right to be heard prior to imposing sentence.  Id.; State v. 
Carvalho, 90 Hawai i 280, 286, 978 P.2d 718, 724 (1999); Schutter  
v. Soong, 76 Hawai i 187, 208, 873 P.2d 66, 87 (1994) .   
  The importance of allocution is underscored by the 
multiple purposes it serves.  Allocution is the defendant’s 
“opportunity to affect the totality of the trial court’s 
sentencing determination.”  Carvalho, 90 Hawai i at 286, 978 P.2d 
at 724.  “A prime reason for allowing a defendant the right of 
allocution is to provide the defendant an opportunity to plead 
for mitigation of the sentence.”   Id. (internal quotation marks 
omitted).  “But allocution today serves purposes beyond that of 
sente
nce mitigation.”  Chow, 77 Hawai i at 250, 883 P.2d at 672.   
  Allocution allows a defendant to acknowledge wrongful 
conduct, which is “the first step towards satisfying the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
21 sentencing objective of rehabilitation.”  Id.  The opportunity 
to speak prior to sentencing may also have a therapeutic effect 
on the defendant.  Id.   Further, allocution is “a significant 
aspect of the fair treatment which should be accorded a 
defendant in the sentencing process.”  Id.   
  Consistent with these purposes, Hawai i caselaw has 
strongly protected a  defendant’s right of allocution.  In Davia, 
the State conceded and this court held that the district court 
erred in failing to accord the defendant his right of 
allocution.  87 Hawai i at 255, 9 53 P.2d at 1353.  The Davia  
court concluded  that, if the defendant “is again convicted on 
remand, the district court should insure that he is afforded an 
opportunity to speak prior to sentencing.”  Id.   
  Additionally, in Carvalho , the circuit court denied 
the defendant’s request for sentencing under the Youthful 
Offender Act without granting him the right of allocution.  90 
Hawaii at 282-83, 978 P.2d at 720-21.  On appeal, this court 
held that, because a court’s consideration of the Youthful 
Offender Act is an aspect of sentencing, the circuit court 
violated the defendant’s right of allocution when it denied him 
a fair opportunity to be heard on the potential application of 
the youthful offender statute.  Id.  at 286, 978 P.2d at 724.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
22   Further, in Chow , the district court sentenced the 
defendant without first affording him the right to be heard.  77 
Hawaii at 243, 246, 883 P.2d at 665, 668.  The ICA held that 
“the defendant must be given the opportunity to be heard before 
the court imposes sentence.”   Id. at 247, 883 P.2d at 669.  
Ruling that the denial of allocution constitutes error, the ICA 
vacated the defendant’s sentences and remanded the case for 
resentencing before a different judge.  Id. at 251, 883 P.2d at 
673.  Indeed, the ICA expressed doubt that a court’s error in 
denying a defendant the opportunity to speak prior to imposing 
sentence could ever be harmless.  Id.   
  Thus, a  defendant has a right to be heard prior to 
being sentenced, which “is constitutionally protected, 
independent and apart from the mandates of statute . . . and 
rule.”  Id. at 246-47, 883 P.2d at 668- 69.  In this case, the 
record lacks any indication that the court provided Hernandez 
15the opportunity to be heard prior to imposing sentence
.  Nor 
does the record show that Hernandez made any waiver of his right 
                     
 15 The fact that Hernandez was not physically present at sentencing 
is of no consequence to the court’s duty to ensure that he is accorded the 
right to be heard prior to the imposition of sentence.  The availability of 
real-time video communication may allow a defendant’s right of allocution at 
sentencing in qualifying misdemeanor cases to be realized by means other than 
physical presence.  See  HRPP Rule 43(e) (allowing for presence by video 
conference). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
23 of allocution voluntarily and with full understanding of the 
consequences.   
  C onsistent with the court’s constitutional obligation  
to address the defendant as to the right of allocution,  the 
court has a duty to ensure that a defendant’s  waiver of this 
right is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made .  “It is 
well settled in Hawai i law that a defendant relinquishes 
fundamental rights only when a waiver is undertaken 
intelligently, knowingly, and voluntarily.”  State v. Ui, 142 
Hawaii 287, 293, 418 P.3d 628, 634 (2018).  “Reviewing courts 
will not presume a defendant’ s acquiescence in the loss of 
16fundamental rights on the basis of a silent record. ”  Id. 
(citing Wong v. Among, 52 Haw. 420, 424, 477 P.2d 630, 633-34 
(1970)).   
  In sum, because Hernandez was not provided the 
opportunity to be heard,  which is mandated by statute and the 
Hawaii Constitution, and the record does not establish a 
                     
 16 Because, as stated, the plea by mail document did not  contain any 
reference to Hernandez’s statutory and constitutional right of allocution, we 
need not decide whether an effective waiver of the right may be established  
through the submission of a waiver document  or other filings without a 
colloquy between the court and the defendant.  As discussed infra, however, a 
document that is filed without any direct interaction between the defendant 
and the court is insufficient to establish a knowing, intelligent, and 
voluntary waiver of a fundamental right under our precedents.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
24 knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of that opportunity, 
his right of allocution was violated.17   
B. The District Court ’s Acceptance of Hernandez’s No Contest Plea 
Without a Colloquy  
  
This court will consider issues that have not been 
preserved below and raised on appeal when necessary to serve the 
ends of justice.  State v. Ui , 142 Hawaii 287, 297, 418 P.3d 
628, 638 (2018) (citing State v. Kahalewai, 56 Haw. 481, 491, 
541 P.2d 1020, 1027 (1975)).  In determining whether a lower 
court’s plain error may be noticed, the relevant inquiry is 
whether the error affected substantial rights.  Id.  (citing 
State v. Miller, 122 Hawai i 92, 100, 223 P.3d 157, 165 (2010)).  
Hernandez contends that the district court plainly erred in 
accepting his no contest plea because it was not made knowingly, 
18voluntarily, and intelligently.    
                     
 17 The remedy for the denial of a defendant’s right of allocution is 
resentencing.  Chow, 77 Hawai i at 248, 883 P.2d at 670 (citing Schutter, 76 
Hawaii at 208, 873 P.2d at  85).  “For, if the right of allocution i s 
violated, it cannot be known whether the defendant would have said anything 
that could have resulted in a different sentence.”  Id.  However, in light of 
our disposition in this case, see  infra, the remedy of resentencing is 
unnecessary.   
 18 The dissent argue s that we should not invoke plain error review 
in this instance because it is a power to be used “ sparingly and with 
caution.”  Dissent at 2 (quoting Miller, 122 Hawai ‘i at 146, 223 P.3d at 211 
(Nakayama, J., dissenting) ).  To the extent this is an argument that we 
should not notice and correct errors affecting substantial rights, this court 
has expressly rejected this position  on multiple occasions.  See  Miller, 122 
Hawai‘i at 117, 223 P.3d at 182 ("[T]he term ‘sparingly’  refers to the 
limitation already in place in HRPP Rule 52(b) that the error must be one 
‘affecting substantial rights.’  . . . [W]here plain error has been committed 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
25   HRPP Rule 43(d)(2) provides that a court need not 
comply with the requirement in HRPP Rule 11 that it address the 
defendant personally in open court when the defendant has waived 
the right to be present at arraignment.  On certiorari, 
Hernandez contends that the district court erred in accepting 
his no contest plea without ensuring that his plea was 
knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made.19   
  
It is well established “that a guilty plea ‘in itself 
is a conviction and a simultaneous waiver of several important 
                                                                  
(. . . continued) 
 
and substantial rights have been affected thereby, the better part of 
discretion is to invoke the plain erro r rule.” ( some internal quotations and 
alterations omitted) (quoting State v. Fox, 70 Haw. 46, 56, 760 P.2d 670, 676 
(1988)); Ui, 142 Hawai ‘i at 298 n.19, 418 P.3d at 639 n.19 ("We reaffirm 
Miller's holding that where plain error has been committed and substantial 
rights have been affected thereby, the better part of discretion is to invoke 
the plain error rule." (internal quotations omitted)); see also State v. 
Nichols, 111 Hawai‘ i 327, 335, 141 P.3d 974, 982 (2006) (holding that, where 
the error is a failure to fulfill a  constitutional duty placed upon the trial 
court rather than the litigants, there is a “merger of the plain error and 
harmless error standards of review”) . 
  The dissent further contends that plain error review is 
inappropriate because Hernandez has not specifically allege d that the trial 
court’s error affected his substantial rights.  Dissent at 1 1-12.  But 
Hernandez clearly argues in his application that “[t]he trial court plainly 
erred in accepting Petitioner’s no contest plea as it was not knowingly, 
voluntarily, and intelligently made .”  (Emphasis added.)  Hernandez thus 
alleges that he was deprived  of substantial  rights, including the right to a 
fair trial and all the constituent rights that a fair trial encompasses , 
because he was convicted without validly waiving any of these rights.  A  
formalistic recitation of the phrase “substantial rights” is not required.   
 19 Although this argument was raised in the reply brief and is made 
on certiorari to this court, it was not asserted in the opening brief to the 
ICA.  Nonetheless, because we conclude that the district court’s acceptance 
of the no contest plea violated substantial rights  of Hernandez , we need not 
address whether the issue was otherwise adequately preserved.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
26 constitutional guarantees [,]’ namely, the privilege against 
compulsory self-incrimination, the right to a trial by jury, and 
the right to confront one’ s accusers .”  
State v. Solomon, 107 
Hawaii 117, 127, 111 P.3d 12, 22 (2005) (alteration in original) 
(quoting Wong v. Among, 52 Haw. 420, 425, 477 P.2d 630, 634 
(1970)).  Additional constitutional guar antees waived by a 
guilty plea include the right to testify and the right to have 
each element of the charged offense proven beyond a reasonable 
doubt.  See Tachibana v. State,  79 Hawai i 226, 231- 32, 900 P.2d 
1293, 1298-99 (1995); State v. Murray,  116 Hawaii 3, 10, 169 
P.3d 955, 962 (2007).  T hus, “the waiver of these guarantees ‘is 
not constitutionally acceptable unless made voluntarily and with 
full understanding of the consequences. ’”  Solomon , 107 Hawai i 
at 127, 111 P.3d at 127 (quoting Wong,  52 Haw. at 425, 477 P.2d 
at 634).   
  While HRPP Rule 43(d)(2) provides that the court need 
not comply with the HRPP requirement of addressing the defendant 
in open court when the defendant has waived the right to be 
present at arraignment, our court rules must be construed to 
conform with the dictates of our constitution when such an 
interpretation is reasonably possible and to yield when there is ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
27 20irreconcilable conflict.   See Life of the Land, Inc. v. W. 
Beach Dev. Corp., 63 Haw. 529, 531, 631 P.2d 588, 590 (1981); 
supra note 14.  W e have stated that a trial court is 
constitutionally obligated to ensure that a defendant’s  guilty 
plea is knowingly and voluntarily entered.  State v. Williams, 
68 Haw. 498, 499, 720 P.2d 1010, 1012 (1986).  
In determining 
the voluntariness of a guilty plea, the trial court should, at a 
minimum, “make an affirmative showing by an on- the-record 
colloquy between the court and the defendant wherein the 
defendant is shown to have a full understanding of what the plea 
of guilty connotes and its consequences.”   State v. Vaitogi, 59 
Haw. 592, 601, 585 P.2d 1259, 1265 (1978).  “Reviewing courts 
will not presume a defendant’ s acquiescence in the loss of 
fundamental rights on the basis of a silent record. ”  Ui, 142 
Hawaii at 293, 418 P.3d at  634 (citing Wong , 52 Haw. at 424, 477 
P.2d at 633-34).   
  For example, in Williams, we held that the trial court 
committed plain error when it accepted the defendant’s guilty 
plea without informing the defendant of the penalties provided 
by law or inquiring whether the defendant knew or understood the 
                     
 20 By its own terms, HRPP Rule 43(d)(2)  excuses the court from 
complying with only the requirement  of addressing the defendant in open court 
established by HRPP Rule 11 (2014) and HRPP Rule 32 .  Thus, HRPP Rule 
43(d)(2) does not--and indeed, could not--excuse the court from complying 
with any obligations established by statute or the constitution.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
28 penalties.  68 Haw. at 499, 720 P.2d at 1012.  We stated that 
the trial court violated i ts “constitutional obligation to 
ensure that the guilty plea was voluntarily and knowingly 
entered.”  Id.  T hus, we concluded the defendant’s guilty plea 
and sentence were void and remanded the case for a new trial.  
Id.   
  Similarly, in Solomon , the defendant asserted error in 
the family court’s acceptance of his guilty plea without 
establishing on the record that his plea was made knowingly and 
voluntarily.  107 Hawai i at 127, 111 P.3d at 22.  Although the 
family court conducted a colloquy with the defe
ndant, we held 
that the colloquy was insufficient because the family court did 
not inform the defendant that, by pleading guilty, he was giving 
up “certain rights.”  Id. at 128, 111 P.3d at 23.  Thus, we 
concluded that the defendant’s guilty plea was not m ade 
knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.  Id.    
  We have underscored the requirement of a colloquy 
between the court and the defendant even where the penal rules 
permit the defendant to waive  fundamental rights.  I n State v. 
Gomez-Lobato , the defendant submitted a waiver of jury trial 
form.  130 Hawai i  465, 46 6-67, 312 P.3d 897, 898 -99 (2013).  
After the family court engaged in a brief conversation with the 
defendant regarding the form, the court concluded that the 
defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
29 right to a jury trial.  Id.   This court recognized that a 
defendant is entitled under HRPP Rule 23(a) to waive the right 
to a jury trial by oral or written consent.  Id. at 469, 312 
P.3d at 901.  Nonetheless, we stated, the penal rule “does not 
relieve the court of its obligation to ensure, through an 
appropriate oral colloquy in court, that the waiver was 
knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily given.”  Id.  Because 
the family court’s questions were not sufficient to establish a 
valid waiver of the right to a jury trial, we concluded that the 
family court erred in finding a knowing and voluntary waiver.  
Id. at 471-73, 312 P.3d at 903 -05.   
  Similarly, in State v.  Baker, the defendant executed a 
waiver of jury trial form, after which the family court engaged 
in a brief exchange with the defendant.  132 Hawai i 1, 3-4, 319 
P.3d 1009, 1011-12 (2014).  On appeal, the defendant challenged 
the family court’s colloquy as  “woefully deficient.”  Id. at 5, 
319 P.3d at 1013.  We  stated that, “while the defendant may 
execute a written waiver form, the court should also engage in 
an appropriate oral colloquy with the defendant to establish 
that the waiver was knowing, intellige nt, and voluntary.”  Id. 
at 6, 319 P.3d at 1014.  Finding  that none of the family court’s 
questions addressed the voluntariness of the defendant’s waiver, 
we concluded that the family court failed to ensure that the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
30 defendant’s waiver of the right to a jur y trial was voluntary.  
Id. at 7, 319 P.3d at 1015.   
  The deficiency of the process is more pronounced when, 
as in this case, the waiver document is submitted without any 
direct interaction between the defendant and the court.  Here, 
the court appeared 
to accept defense counsel’s representations 
that Hernandez understood  the charges against him and the rights 
he was waiving by pleading no contest.  But we have held that “a 
court may not rely upon an off- the-record discussion between 
counsel and a defendant to establish a valid waiver of a 
constitutional right.”  State v. Eduwensuyi, 141 Hawai‘i 328, 
336, 409 P.3d 732, 740 (2018).  Indeed, “[o]ur precedents do not 
permit a reviewing court to infer that a fundamental right was 
knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently relinquished by a 
defendant simply because defense counsel suggested that the 
right was so waived.”  Ui, 142 Hawai‘i at 299, 418 P.3d at 640. 
  The dissent nonetheless  relies on the plea by mail 
document and counsel ’s representations in arguing that plain 
error review is inappropriate when context suggests  “a defendant 
initiated a procedural maneuver for his benefit”  because the 
failure of the court to conduct a colloquy in such circumstances 
does not affect a defendant’s substantial rights .  Dissent at 8.  
This approach calls for speculation regarding what a defendant 
would have done had the requisite information been provided.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
31 Alternatively, it may be an indirect decision on the merits of 
whether the waiver at issue was knowing, intelligent, and 
voluntary, which appears to be applied 
as a plain error 
standard.  In either event, we  squarely rejected this position 
in State v. Ui, 142 Hawai ‘i at 299, 418 P.3d at 640 .  Prior to 
invoking our authority to correct plain errors, we held that 
there is no strategic decision  exception to the constitutional 
colloquy requirement because, inter alia, evaluating whether the 
exception applied would require conjecture regarding privileged 
communications and because the exception would be wholly 
unadministrable, as virtually any waiver c an be characterized as 
having strategic benefits.  Id. at 294-96, 418 P.3d at 635- 37.  
This holds true regardless of whether the argued-for exception 
is characterized as a plain error standard, Dissent at 8- 9, or a 
21method of evaluating a purported waiver in the first instance.   
Dissent at 1 3-15.   
  Additionally, the dissent’s p osition is at odds with 
firmly established precedent.  This court has consistently 
                     
 21 The dissent alternately argues that , under the invited error 
doctrine, the omission of the required colloquy is not grounds for vacating 
Herandez’s conviction.  We have stated, however, that the “general rule” that 
invited errors are not reversible “is inapplicable where an invited error is 
so prejudicial as to be plain error.”  Nichols, 111 Hawai‘ i at 339 n.7, 141 
P.3d at 986 n.7.  In other words, errors that affect substantial rights such 
that plain error review is appropriate are not subject to the invited error 
doctrine, and we need not consider whether the doctrine would otherwise 
apply. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
32 declined to find a valid waiver of a fundamental right based on  
a filing or representations by counsel when the trial court 
failed to engage the defendant in an on- the-record colloquy, and 
we have often expressly invoked plain error review to do so--
including specifically when a defendant has executed a written 
waiver pursuant to an HRPP Rule ostensibly authorizing the 
22procedure.   See Gomez -Lobato, 130 Hawai ‘i at 469 n.4, 312 P.3d 
at 901 n.4 (holding that it was plain error for trial court to 
accept defendant’s written waiver of a jury trial without 
engaging defendant in a colloquy despite HRPP Rule 23(a) 
permitting a waiver to be in writing); see also,  e.g., Ui, 142 
Hawai‘i at 299, 418 P.3d at 640 (holding that it was plain error 
                     
 22 Further, the dissent faults Hernandez for failing to  challenge 
the district court’s acceptance of his plea at the district court stage.  
Dissent at 6 , 10.  Our precedents make clear, however, that it is the duty of 
the trial court to perform a colloquy to ensure a defendant’s waiver of a 
fundamental right is undertaken knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily--
not a defendant or defense counsel ’s duty.  See, e.g., Ui, 142 Hawai ‘i at 293, 
418 P.3d at 634 (“[I]t is necessar y for a trial court to engage a defendant 
in an on- the-record colloquy  before accepting a waiver of any of the rights 
we have held to be fundamental.” (emphasis added)); Murray, 116 Hawai ‘i at 11, 
169 P.3d at 963 (“[A] knowing and voluntary waiver of a defendant’s 
fundamental right must come directly from the defendant, and requires the 
court to engage in a colloquy with the defendant .” (emphasis added)).  It is 
certainly questionable  whether a defendant can be faulted for a trial  court’s 
failure to fulfil the constitutional requirement of a colloquy.  Cf. Nichols, 
111 Hawai‘ i at 335, 141 P.3d at 982 (holding that unobjected -to jury 
instruction error was subject to harmless beyond a reasonable doubt review 
because “the duty to properly instruct the jury ultimately lies with the 
trial court”).  Indeed, were we to hold that that defense counsel is under a 
duty to notice the failure and bring it to the court’s attention, it would 
follow that the failure of a prosecutor to do the same would amount to 
prosecutorial misconduct.  See State v. Maluia, 107 Hawai‘ i 20, 25, 108 P.3d 
974, 979 (2005) (“The term ‘prosecutorial misconduct’ is a legal term of art 
that refers to any improper action committed by a prosecutor, however 
harmless or unintentional.”  (emphasis omitted)). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
33 for trial court to accept stipulation to an element of the 
charged offense without engaging defendant in a colloquy); State 
v. Vaitogi, 59 Haw. 592, 593 n.4, 597, 585 P.2d 1259, 1260 n.4, 
1262 (1978) (stating “(i)t was error, plain on the face of the 
record, for the trial judge to accept (defendant’s) guilty plea 
without” a colloquy (alterations in original) (quoting Boykin v. 
Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 242 (1969))); State v. Ichimura, SCWC -13-
0000396, 2017 WL 2590858, at *7 (Haw. June 15, 2017)  (holding 
that it was plain error for the trial court to fail to engage 
defendant in a colloquy regarding defendant’s right to testify) .  
The dissent offers no justification for departing from these 
precedents. 
  Thus, regardless of whether the defendant has executed 
a document waiving the right to be present at a change of plea 
proceeding pursuant to the HRPP, the trial court is required, 
under the Hawai i Constitution,  to ensure through an on-the -
record colloquy that a defendant’s guilty plea is knowingly and 
voluntarily entered.  Solomon, 107 Hawai i at 127, 111 P.3d at 
2322; Williams, 68 Haw. at 499, 720 P.2d at 1012.    
                     
 23 This principle is similarly true with regard to the waiver of 
other fundamental rights.  See Murray, 116 Hawai i at 12, 169 P.3d at 964 
(holding that “the trial court must conduct a colloquy regarding waiver of 
proof of an element of the offense”) ; Tachibana, 79 Hawai i at 235, 900 P.2d 
at 1302 (holding that the trial court must engage in an on -the-record 
colloquy to ensure that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived the 
constitutional right to testify); State v. Ibuos, 75 Haw. 118, 121, 857 P.2d

34   In this case, although Hernandez submitted a plea by 
mail document indicating that he was waiving his right to be 
present at arraignment and sentencing and pleading no contest to 
harassment by stalking, the district court was constitutionally 
obligated, prior to accepting his no contest plea,
 to ensure 
through an on -the-record colloquy  with Hernandez  that his plea 
was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made.  The record 
lacks any showing that the court fulfilled this constitutional 
obligation.24   
                                                                  
(. . . continued) 
 
576, 578 (1993) (holding that the record was silent as to any colloquy 
between the court and the defendant and con cluding that counsel’s waiver of 
the defendant’s right to a trial by jury was invalid) .   
 24 As with the right of allocution, a defendant’s written consent to 
waive the right to be present at arraignment does not relieve the court of 
its constitutional obligation to ensure that the guilty or no contest plea is 
knowingly and voluntarily made.  Cf. Gomez-Lobato, 130 Hawai‘ i at 469, 312 
P.3d at 901 (“In other words, while the defendant may execute a written 
waiver form [pursuant to HRPP Rule 23(a)], the court should also engage in an 
oral colloquy with the defendant to establish that the waiver was knowing, 
intelligent, and voluntary.”).  And contrary to the dissent’s contention, our 
holding will not lead Hawai ‘i judges to cease accepting Rule 43(d) pleas .  
Dissent at 9 n.5.  Like the right of allocution, the court’s  colloquy 
obligation in misdemeanor cases within the scope of HRPP Rule 43(d) may be 
fulfilled through real -time electronic video communication.  Such technology  
has become easily accessible--indeed ubiquitous--in the modern age through 
smartphones and other common 
consumer devices, dispelling any notion that 
offenders who have departed from the island where the offense is alleged to 
have been committed before their court date will be unable to appear 
remotely.  Further, the use of video conferencing for arraignment s is 
expressly authorized under the HRPP.  See HRPP Rule 10(d) (2014) 
(“Arraignment in the circuit court shall be conducted in open court or by 
video conference when permitted by Rule 43. ”); HRPP Rule 43(e)(1 )-(2)(A) 
(authorizing courts to conduct arraignment by video conference).  Presence by 
video conference is also permitted with the consent of the defendant at a 
pre- or posttrial evidentiary hearing, a non -evidentiary proceeding, and a 
sentencing hearing.  See HRPP Rule 43(e)(2)(B) -(C), (e)(3).   
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
35                                                                   
(. . . continued) 
 
  Notwithstanding this  specific authorization  in multiple 
situations, the dissent contends that appearing by video conference is not 
“viable” when a defendant is not in an  “institutional setting like a priso n” 
because “authentication, identification, and confidentiality issues”  will 
make it too difficult to develop an “accurate record.”  Dissent at 9 n.5.  
Yet it is not clear which of the assurances of a defendant’s identity that 
are present when a defendant appears in person would be absent when the 
defendant instead appears by video conferencing, nor why the lack of such 
safeguards would undermine the memorialization of the record in the  manner 
employed in any other proceeding.  Moreover, the alternative procedure argued 
for by the dissent--under which courts would accept a defendant’s guilty or 
no contest plea based on an  out-of-court signature and submission of a 
document--contains far fewer assurances of the defendant’s personal 
involvement and willingness to relinquish fundamental rights than when a 
court conducts a colloquy by video conference, and the alternative procedure 
would thus be more susceptible to the subsequent  legal challenges the dissent 
appears to contemplate.  To the extent the evidentiary concept of 
authentication applies to a video conference, it has not presented a 
significant enough obstacle to prevent our court rules from authorizing the 
technique
 in a variety of contexts in a criminal case  without conditioning 
its use on the defendant’s institutionalization .  The same conclusion applies 
to the dissent’s concern with “identification [] and confidentiality  issues,” 
which have also not inhibited our broad e ndorsement  of video conferencing  
under HRPP Rule 43. 
 Dissent at 9 n.5.   
  We note that the positive benefits of the colloquy requirement 
are broadly recognized  in seminal decisions by this and other courts across 
the nation.  Tachibana, 79 Haw. at 233, 900 P.2d at 1300 (“There are well -
documented benefits to the colloquy procedure.” ); accord Boykin, 395 U.S. at 
244 n.7 (“A majority of criminal convictions are obtained after a plea of 
guilty.  If these convictions are to be insulated from attack, the trial 
court is best advised to conduct an on the record examination of the 
defendant which should include, inter alia, an attempt to satisfy itself that 
the defendant understands the nature of the charges, his right to a jury 
trial, the acts sufficient to constitute the offenses for which he is charged 
and the permissible range of sentences.”  (quoting Commonwealth ex rel. West 
v. Rundle, 428 Pa. 102, 105 —106 (1968))). 
  Further, the misdemeanor offenses qualifying for an in -absentia 
plea under HRPP Rule 43(d)(2)  encompass a wide range of serious crimes .  In 
addition to harassment by stalking, with which Hernandez was charged, 
qualifying offenses include such crimes as abuse of a family or household 
members, HRS § 709- 906 (2014) , sexual assault in the fourth degree, HRS § 
707-733 (2014), violation of privacy in the second degree, HRS § 711 -1111 
(2014), and unlawful imprisonment in the second degree, HRS § 707 -722 (2014).  
Not only may these offenses greatly impact the victims of the crimes--who are 
denied an opportunity to directly address the offender when a defendant does 
not participate in the  sentencing proceeding--but a conviction of such an 
offense may also have serious consequences for a defendant’s career, 
reputation, and personal life .  The decision to forego an opportunity to 
contest such charges should not be treated as a technical formality  effected 
 
(continued . . .)  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
36   Because the district court failed  to ascertain whether 
Hernandez’s no contest plea was made knowingly, intelligently 
and voluntarily, the omission affected Hernandez’s substantial 
rights.  T he district court therefore plainly erred in accepting 
Hernandez’s plea of no contest.    
V. CONCLUSION 
  Based on the foregoing,  the ICA’s May 30, 2017 
Judgment on Appeal and the district court’s  January 7, 2015 and 
February 9, 2015 Notices of Entry of Judgment and/or Order are 
vacated, and the case is remand ed to the district court for 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
