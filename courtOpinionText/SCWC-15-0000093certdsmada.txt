PAT ROCCO,
Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellant,
 
vs.
 
KALAPANA SEAVIEW ESTATES COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION,
Respondent/Defendant-Appellee. 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
(CAAP-15-0000093; CASE NO. 3RC-13-1-589)
 
ORDER DISMISSING WITHOUT PREJUDICE APPLICATION 
FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
  
Upon consideration of Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellant
 
Pat Rocco’s Application for Writ of Certiorari filed on July 2,
 
2015, and the record, it appears that the Intermediate Court of
 Appeals has not issued a decision on the appeal to date, and
 therefore, Petitioner’s request for certiorari review is
 premature. 
See
 HRS § 602-59(a) (“After issuance of the
 
intermediate appellate court’s judgment or dismissal order, a
 party may seek review of the intermediate appellate court’s
 decision and judgment or dismissal order only by application to
 the supreme court for a writ of certiorari . . . .”); HRAP Rule
 40.1(a)(1) (“A party may seek review of the intermediate court of
 
appeals’ decision by filing an application for a writ of
 certiorari in the supreme court. The application shall be filed
 within 30 days after the filing of the intermediate court of
 appeals’ judgment on appeal or dismissal order . . . .”).
 Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Application for Writ of
 
Certiorari is dismissed without prejudice to re-filing a
 certiorari application as provided for under HRS § 602-59 and
 HRAP Rule 40.1.

Honolulu, Hawai' i, August 4, 2015.
