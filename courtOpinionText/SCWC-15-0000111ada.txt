OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J.  
 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
  In 2012, this court dismissed Albert Villados’s 
application for writ of certiorari, which asked us to review his 
2010 conviction for promoting a dangerous drug in the second 
degree.  Because Villados’s attorney missed the deadline to file Electronically Filed

2 an application for writ of certiorari, we were deprived of 
jurisdiction to consider the merits of his appeal.  Villados 
must now be allowed to refile his application.  As we held in 
State v. Uchima, 147 Hawaiʻi 64, 464 P.3d 852 (2020), a criminal 
defendant has the right to the effective assistance of counsel 
on certiorari review before this court.  We conclude that 
Villados is entitled to appropriate relief because Villados’s 
counsel was ineffective.  In this case, appropriate relief is 
the opportunity to refile an application for writ of certiorari 
in his original case so that this court can decide to accept or 
reject it on the merits.
II. 
BACKGROUND
A. 2012 Application for Writ of Certiorari
Villados was convicted of promoting a dangerous drug 
in the second degree and prohibited acts related to drug 
paraphernalia after a jury trial in the Circuit Court for the 
Second Circuit (circuit court).   He was sentenced to thirty-five 
years in prison.  21
Villados timely appealed his conviction and sentence 
to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), represented by a 
1The Honorable Shackley F. Raffetto presided over the original 
trial. 
2  Villados was sentenced to fifteen years for the two convictions 
(including a ten- year mandatory minimum), plus an additional twenty years 
stemming from the revocation of probation in four other cases. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
3 different attorney than at the trial court.   On November 28, 
2011, the ICA filed its Summary Disposition Order (SDO) 
affirming Villados’s sentence and conviction.  State v. 
Villados, No. 30442 (App. Nov. 28, 2011).  The ICA issued its 
judgment on appeal on January 4, 2012. 3
In a letter dated December 31, 2011, before the ICA 
filed its judgment on appeal, Villados’s appellate counsel, 
(“appellate counsel”), acknowledged to Villados that she 
understood that he wanted to seek certiorari review.  She 
informed him that she would not do so, however, because after 
reading the ICA’s ruling, she could not find any basis to apply 
for certiorari review under Hawai ʻi Revised Statutes (HRS) § 602-
59(b) (Supp. 2011).   She said, “[A]t this time, I do not see 
‘grave errors of law or fact’ in the decision of the ICA in your 4
3Villados’s trial counsel withdrew after sentencing because of a 
conflict.  He was appointed new appellate counsel, who also was permitted to 
withdraw because of health concerns.  His third attorney filed an Opening Brief to the ICA, but she later withdrew because of her appointment to the 
Hawaiʻi Paroling Authority.  A fourth attorney
, who is the subject of the 
ineffective assistance of counsel claim at issue in this appeal, was 
appointed to represent Villados thereafter.   
4HRS § 602-59(b) provides: 
(b) The application for writ of certiorari shall terselystate its grounds, which shall include:
(1)Grave errors of law or of fact; or
(2)Obvious inconsistencies in the decision of the
intermediate appellate court with that of the supremecourt, federal decisions, or its own decision,
and the magnitude of those errors or inconsistencies 
dictating the need for further appeal. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 case, and I do not see obvious inconsistencies with other ICA, 
Hawaii Supreme Court[,] or federal decisions.”  However, she 
also told him she would “review the ICA decision again” before 
the statutory deadline to file an application before this court.  
She further informed Villados, “If there is a basis to file a 
writ, I will file the writ.  If I find there is not a basis to 
file a writ in accordance with the statute, I will not be able 
to file a writ.  I will let you know either way.”    
 In a letter dated January 20, 2012, appellate counsel 
told Villados that, in effect, she changed her mind and had “decided to file a writ on [his] behalf.”  She explained that 
she found “at least one point in the ICA’s opinion that bothers 
[her],” and she “hope[d] to file” his application “by the end of 
January.”  She also informed Villados that she “tried calling 
[him]” at the prison but had to leave a message with a woman who 
had not yet called her back.  She told Villados that she would 
“keep trying” to call him and that he should try calling her, though it might be difficult because she was frequently in 
meetings or in court.   
  Pursuant to HRS § 602-59(c), “[a]n application for a 
writ of certiorari may be filed with the supreme court no later 
than thirty days after the filing of the judgment or dismissal 
order of the intermediate appellate court.”  The February 3, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
5 
 2012 deadline passed without an application or a request for an 
extension being filed.  
 
  In a letter dated February 15, 2012, appellate counsel 
informed Villados that she had not applied for certiorari review 
and that the deadline for doing so had passed.  She stated that 
while she had started preparing his application, she ultimately 
decided, after reviewing the SDO once again, that she “could not 
file an application for a writ of certiorari.”  She explained, “Thus, this being a decision that I as an attorney had to make, 
I decided the appropriate course was not to file one.  
Therefore, with all due respect to your desire to have a writ filed, I have not filed one and will not be filing one.”   
  Appellate counsel notified Villados that “[t]he time to file the writ is now be [sic] expired.”  However, she 
informed him that his recourse “may be a [Hawaiʻ i Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP)] Rule 40[
5] petition, which may be used to 
                     
5  HRPP Rule 40 provides for proceedings for post- conviction relief 
from a judgment of conviction based on any of the following: 
 
(i) that the judgment was obtained or sentence 
imposed in violation of the constitution of the United 
States or of the State of Hawaiʻ i; 
(ii) that the court which rendered the judgment 
was without jurisdiction over the person or the 
subject matter; 
(iii) that the sentence is illegal; 
(iv) that there is newly discovered evidence; or (v) any ground which is a basis for collateral 
attack on the judgment 
 
HRPP Rule 40(a)(1). ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 allege ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.”  While she 
stated that she “would not agree with” allegations of 
ineffective assistance, she told Villados that he could “apply 
for an attorney to assist [him] with that petition through the 
[circuit court]” and that she would “see that [his] files are 
expeditiously transferred to the new attorney” should he secure 
one for that purpose.  
 
  On June 12, 2012, roughly three months after the 
February 3, 2012 deadline, Villados filed an application for writ of certiorari to this court challenging the ICA decision on 
the merits.  Accompanying the application, he also filed (1) a 
“Motion for Relief from Default and Permission to File a Writ of 
Certiorari” and (2) a motion for appointment of counsel.  He 
provided an affidavit regarding ineffective assistance that 
stated, in relevant part: 
3. Petitioner’ s former attorney (appellate counsel) [] 
refused to file a writ of certiorari on Petitioner’ s 
behalf; 
 4. Through a letter dated December 31, 2011, [appellate counsel] informed Petitioner after receiving numerous messages from family members that Petitioner desires to file a writ of certiorari: “I will review the ICA decision again within 60 days to see if there is a basis to file a writ.”  5. Through a letter dated January 20, 2012, [appellate counsel] informed Petitioner: “I have decided to file a writ of certiorari on your behalf” . . . “ I hope to file 
the writ by the end of January.”  6. Through a letter dated February 15, 2012, [appellate counsel] informed Petitioner: “Therefore, with all due respect to your desire to have a writ filed, I have not ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
7 
 filed one and will not be filing one” . . . “The time to 
file the writ is now expired.” 
 
  Villados also provided an affidavit to support his 
request for appointment of counsel.  Id.  In relevant part, it 
stated as follows: 
2. [Petitioner] alleges that he was denied effective 
assistance of counsel when attorney failed to represent Petitioner in the pursuit of a writ of certiorari;  3. [Petitioner] lacks the knowledge in preparing such a case before the Supreme Court of the State of Hawaiʻ i
; 
 4. [Petitioner] is getting piecemeal assistance from various inmates in preparing this case;  5. [Petitioner] has no experience or education in legal law;  6. [Petitioner] is unable to determine complex legal issues that might have merit to this case;  7. [Petitioner] has to rely on unknowledgeable inmate assistance[.] 
 
  We dismissed the application, concluding that its 
untimeliness deprived us of jurisdiction.  See State v. 
Villados, SCWC-30442, 2012 WL 3262752, at *1 (Haw. July 20, 
2012).  One justice dissented, arguing that the court should 
have accepted the untimely application because ineffective assistance of counsel caused the procedural defect.  Id. at *3 
(Acoba, J., dissenting).  The dissent opined that the circumstances giving rise to Villados’s untimely Application 
“fall[] squarely under the reasoning of” our cases that had 
excused procedural defects before the ICA.  Id. (citing State v. 
Caraballo, 62 Haw. 309, 615 P.2d 91 (1980)).  Accordingly, the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
8 
 dissent would have taken jurisdiction over Villados’s appeal as, 
it argued, due process required.  Id. at *4. 
B.  Rule 40 Proceedings  
 1.  Circuit Court Proceedings 
 
  On September 12, 2013,6 Villados filed a pro se 
petition for post-conviction relief in the circuit court 
pursuant to HRPP Rule 40.7  Villados alleged that he was denied 
effective assistance of counsel because appellate counsel failed to timely apply for writ of certiorari, despite assuring Villados that she would do so.  Villados argued that he was 
entitled to an evidentiary hearing, and he requested that the 
court vacate his judgment, order a new trial, or resentence him.  
The circuit court appointed a new attorney for Villados, and 
through counsel, Villados filed a supplemental memorandum 
arguing that appellate counsel’s refusal to file an application 
on his behalf “thwart[ed] the Hawaii Supreme Court’s mandate for 
zealous advocacy on appeal and deprived Mr. Villados of his 
right to appellate counsel.”     The State argued in opposition that the petition 
should be dismissed because appeal to this court is not one of 
                     
6  Villados also petitioned for writ of habeas corpus in the United 
States District Court for the District of Hawaiʻ i based on the untimely 
certiorari application, which was dismissed prior to the HRPP Rule 40 
proceedings for failing to assert a colorable claim for relief under federal 
law
.  See Villados v. Thomas, 2013 WL 4011514, at *3 (D. Haw. August 5, 
2013). 
 
7  The Honorable Peter T. Cahill presided. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 right, and under feder
al law, there is no right to effective 
assistance of counsel on discretionary appeals.  In the 
alternative, the State argued that appellate counsel’s 
“performance was objectively reasonable and within the ‘range of 
competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.’”  Noting 
that appellate counsel fully briefed the issues before the ICA, 
the State argued that “under the totality of the circumstances, 
[appellate counsel’s] efforts reflected zealous advocacy on behalf of Villados.”  In addition, the State argued that it was 
important to consider and defer to appellate counsel’s view that 
there were no meritorious issues to pursue in an application for 
writ of certiorari.   
  The circuit court held an evidentiary hearing on 
Villados’ Rule 40 petition.  Appellate counsel provided testimony at the hearing regarding her representation of 
Villados.  She stated that she did not file an application for 
writ of certiorari because she believed there were no grounds to do so.  She explained that after considering “the statute 
governing the taking of a writ of certiorari” and reading the 
ICA’s SDO, she determined that she “did not see grave errors of 
law or fact” that would “meet the criteria” under the statute.   
  On cross-examination, appellate counsel testified that 
she did not seek an extension of the filing deadline after the 
ICA’s Judgment on Appeal was filed.  She testified that after ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
10 
 sending Villados the January 20, 2012
 letter indicating that she 
would file the application, she tried to call Villados “on the 
21st or 22nd” to inform him that she in fact would not file an 
application.  She testified that she was unable to reach 
Villados and had to leave a message, although she later found 
out she did not follow the usual procedure for arranging a call 
to the mainland prison where Villados was incarcerated.  She 
also testified that she did not write to Villados to inform him that she would not file an application until after the window 
for filing had expired.   
  The circuit court found that Villados was provided 
ineffective assistance of appellate counsel:   
[B]ased upon the evidence that’s been presented and the 
testimony that I heard from [appellate counsel], I do find 
that there was ineffective assistance of counsel.  I mean, in his dissent from the order dismissing 
application for writ of certiorari, I mean, [the dissent] as much as said, as a matter of law, it was ineffective assistance of counsel, and they appeared to have all the evidence that I have, other than the testimony.  But they 
had declarations and affidavits, and I realize that’s the dissent, but he sets it out as clear as he could be.  But the evidence also supports it.  And the troubling 
part is that [appellate counsel] wrote to Mr. Villados on 
January 20, 2012, and said, “I will file the writ of certiorari.”  She testified that she called him but could not make contact.  So, therefore, in Mr. Villados’ mind, when he 
receives the letter of January 20th, he thinks his lawyer is going to proceed.  The next thing that he receives is a letter saying that the appeal time has been blown, and there’s nothing more we can do about it except file Rule 40 and make a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.  I think it’s like a statute of limitations.  Once 
blown, it can’t be reobtained.  I did not know myself about the automatic 30- day extension, but you have to make that 
request. ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
11 
  That was not done.  That would have given counsel 
time to file a withdrawal or there were other options.  
Simply file the writ of certiorari even if she didn’t believe that there were grounds for it.  [The dissent] talks about zealous representation.  But if counsel felt uncomfortable doing that, then the immediate response has to be you immediately file a motion to withdraw.  On the civil side, if you’re faced with a statute 
like this and you don’t want to file the Complaint, you can easily prepare one and have the client file it pro se. 
 I realize in the criminal context it’s different, but 
in this case, [ appellate counsel’s] actions did deprive Mr. 
Villados of the right to seek an appeal.  He does not have 
a right to the automatic appeal because it’s discretionary with the Supreme Court. 
 
  With regard to the appropriate remedy, the court held 
that a new trial should not be granted, as Villados had urged, 
but expressed doubt as to the proper course moving forward given 
the unique circumstances of the case.  The court explained: 
 The standard has troubled me, . . . but I don’t think 
that, in the totality of this case, the remedy is to grant 
the new trial. 
 The reason is there is an [a]ppellate ruling in this 
case, and the appeal was denied.  So despite my finding, I can’t grant the petition or I can’t grant the relief you’re requesting.  I am still troubled, and I guess the only thing is, 
given what the parties have done, is now everything on this — everything that was part of the original criminal matter 
is now part of this petition, including the entirety of the transcripts.  And the defendant or the petitioner should be 
afforded to present all of his appeal issues as part of his Rule 40 petition.  Now, whether the [a]ppellate [c]ourt will accept 
that, I don’t know.  And they certainly — and this is 
certainly one [—] that should be appealed.  Because I will 
tell you that both myself and . 
. . my law clerk — I spent 
one entire day trying to find the case, and . . . I could not find a case where the time limit on the writ of cert was missed that also told me what the relief should be.  I couldn’t find one.  And so I just don’t feel that granting a new trial on 
the Rule 40 petition — yes, he was deprived of that right, 
but it’s so discretionary, and I don’t think you have to prove, necessarily, prejudice; but we are guided by what the [c]ourt already did.  And [the dissent] set forth the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
12 
 manner, the method, and the platform by which the [s]upreme 
[c]ourt could have taken the original appeal, and they chose not to.  Now, I realize they decided it simply on a 
jurisdictional issue, that the time was blown, but he set it all out, and he even said why should we have to deal with this on a Rule 40.  Let’s just deal with it now.  Well, what he was thinking on the Rule 40, he was probably thinking the entire appeal is going to come back to us, and we’re then going to have an opportunity to decide it.  So I don’t know how you’re going to fashion — well, 
the findings of fact, I think, are pretty easy.  The conclusions of law are — I’m concluding, as a result of the 
ineffective assistance of counsel, that the defendant was deprived of his ability to seek a discretionary appeal with the [s]upreme [c]ourt.  But that the relief requested, namely a new trial, is 
denied; and that the defendant or the petitioner, as a matter of law, should be permitted the opportunity to present all of his appeal issues including those that were originally raised in the original appeal and that were not permitted to go up on [c]ert to the [s]upreme [c]ourt should be presented.  Whether or not I have the power to do that, it’s 
almost like I’m issuing a writ of mandamus to the [a]ppellate [c]ourt. 
 
  Villados moved for reconsideration before the court 
issued a written order, arguing that pursuant to Briones v. 
State, 74 Haw. 442, 467, 848 P.2d 966, 978 (1993), he was 
entitled to a retrial.  The State opposed the motion; without 
conceding that counsel had been ineffective, it asserted that a 
new trial was not warranted.   
  The circuit court denied the motion for 
reconsideration and filed a written order reflecting its oral ruling.  The court determined that appellate counsel provided 
ineffective assistance of counsel, as she “failed to inform” 
Villados that she had changed her mind about filing an 
application for writ of certiorari, and she failed to “take the ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
13 
 steps necessary to preserve his statutory right to seek review 
by the Hawaii Supreme Court.”  It opined, however, that “[t]he 
appropriate remedy in this case is to permit [Villados] to seek 
review by the Hawaii Supreme Court of the ICA’s affirming of the 
judgment of conviction.  This [c]ourt cannot grant the relief 
requested by [Villados].”  
 
 2.  ICA Proceedings 
  Villados and the State cross-appealed.  The State 
challenged the conclusion that counsel for Villados was 
ineffective, arguing that appellate counsel could not have been 
ineffective for denying her client a statutory right.  The State 
argued that Villados was not constitutionally entitled to 
effective counsel on appeal to this court.  Even if he was, the 
State asserted that counsel’s error did not result in “the 
withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially 
meritorious defense.”  (Citing Briones, 74. Haw. at 462, 848 
P.2d at 976.)  Villados asked the ICA to affirm the circuit 
court insofar as it concluded his counsel was ineffective, but 
urged that his conviction should be set aside.   
  The ICA rejected the State’s cross-appeal and upheld the circuit court’s ruling that Villados’s appellate counsel 
provided ineffective assistance.  Relying on Maddox v. State, 
141 Hawaiʻ i 196, 203, 407 P.3d 152, 159 (2017), the ICA 
determined that when counsel has denied a defendant their right ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
14 
 to an appeal, including an appeal to this court, “a defendant 
need not demonstrate any additional possibility of impairment” 
to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.  Because filing 
an application for writ of certiorari is within “the scope of 
counsel’s appointment, pursuant to HRS § 802-5,” the ICA 
determined that Villados’s counsel denied him of his right to 
appeal to this court by virtue of her failure to “diligently 
fulfill the procedural requirements to file an application for writ of certiorari if [Villados] elect[ed] to do so.” 
  
  However, the ICA agreed with the circuit court that a 
new trial would not be an inappropriate remedy.  Quoting Maddox, 
the ICA noted that this court “expressed that the defendant’s alleged facts” regarding ineffective assistance, “if true, would 
entitle [the defendant] to proceed with his appeal at this 
juncture[.]”  141 Hawaiʻ i at 208, 407 P.3d at 164.  Per the ICA, 
“Maddox does not indicate that . . . vacating [Villados’s] 
conviction would be an appropriate remedy.”  Instead, the 
appropriate relief “would be to allow [Villados] to proceed with 
the appeal that was precluded by the ineffective counsel.”  However, like the circuit court, it did not have the power to 
order the supreme court to review the application.  That power, 
it reasoned, could only be exercised by this court.  The ICA 
therefore affirmed the circuit court’s denial of the Rule 40 
petition.  ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
15 
 III. DISCUSSION 
 
 
 A decade after his original conviction and eight years 
after his untimely application for writ of certiorari was 
dismissed, Villados is now before this court once again.  
Because the State did not appeal the ICA’s decision as to its cross-appeal, the issue of whether Villados’s counsel was 
ineffective is waived, and we do not review the circuit court 
and ICA’s conclusion that she was.  Therefore, we are presented 
only with the question of the proper remedy.  We agree with the 
ICA and the circuit court that Villados must be permitted to 
refile an application for writ of certiorari challenging his 
2010 conviction on the merits.  
  As this court held in State v. Uchima, 147 Hawaiʻ i
 64, 
464 P.3d 852 (2020), a criminal defendant is entitled to the 
effective assistance of counsel on certiorari review.  Id. at 
76, 464 P.3d at 864.  Uchima arose in the same context that 
Villados found himself in 2012: a late application, which would normally deprive us of jurisdiction, caused by ineffective 
assistance of counsel on direct appeal.  Because the 
ineffectiveness of Uchima’s counsel was plain from the record, 
we had authority to consider the application on its merits, as 
we do “when it is necessary to prevent a violation of due 
process or is in the interests of justice.”  Id. at 82, 464 P.3d ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
16 
 at 870.  Just as we considered Uchima’s application on the 
merits, Villados’s application should be considered on its 
merits as well. 
  The remedy for ineffective assistance of counsel must be responsive to the nature of counsel’s errors.  Ineffective 
assistance of counsel at trial requires a new trial, but 
ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal does not necessarily 
warrant this remedy.  In Maddox, we held that if the facts 
alleged in an HRPP Rule 40 proceeding were true, the defendant’s 
counsel would have been ineffective because counsel failed to 
take the procedural steps required to commence an appeal.  141 
Hawaiʻi at 202–03, 407 P.3d at 158–59.  As such, counsel’s errors 
resulted in “the complete denial of a criminal appeal[.]”  Id. 
at 205, 407 P.3d at 161.  Accordingly, we noted that he would be entitled to “proceed with his appeal at this juncture[.]”
8  Id. 
at 208, 407 P.3d at 164. 
  We do not agree with Villados that counsel’s error 
requires vacatur of the underlying conviction and a new trial 
based on language in Briones: “A conviction will be reversed, 
therefore, if the defendant was denied effective assistance of 
counsel at trial . . . or on appeal.”  74 Haw. at 467, 848 P.2d 
                     
8  The United States District Court for the District of Hawaiʻ i, in 
reviewing the same defendant’s petition for writ of habeas corpus,
 also 
concluded that the appropriate remedy would be a new appeal.  Maddox v. 
Thomas, 2019 WL 311964, at *6 n.10 (D. Haw. Jan. 23, 2019) (citing Penson v. 
Ohio, 488 U.S. 75, 88 (1988)). ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
17 at 978 (citation omitted).  In Briones, not only was trial 
counsel also ineffective (for which a new trial is the usual 
remedy), appellate counsel’s “failure to raise [an] issue, both 
at trial and on appeal, resulted in the withdrawal of not only a 
potentially meritorious defense, but a defense that would have 
altered the outcome.”  Id. at 467–68, 848 P.2d at 978 (emphasis 
added).  Cases from other jurisdictions that awarded a new trial 
for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel likewise tend to 
arise in this posture: if the court has determined that, absent 
counsel’s error, the outcome of the appeal would have been 
different, the remedy of a new appeal would effectively “require 
another judicial entity to undertake exactly the same analysis 
which had just been accomplished,” and judicial economy instead 
favors granting a new trial.  Milliken v. Stewart, 583 S.E.2d 
30, 31 (Ga. 2003); see Ezell v. State, 548 S.E.2d 852, 854 (S.C. 
2001) (“Here, we conclude the result of respondent’s appeal 
would have been different had counsel [been effective before] 
the Court of Appeals.  Therefore, . . . the appropriate remedy 
for the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel on the 
particular facts of this case is to grant respondent a new 
trial.”); Ramchair v. Conway, 601 F.3d 66, 78 (2d Cir. 2010) 
(“Because remanding for a new appeal would further delay any new 
trial, and because the district court found the mistrial claim 
unassailably meritorious due to the unfairness of Ramchair’s ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
18 In Maddox, by contrast, we held that a defendant who was 
utterly denied his right to appeal “need not demonstrate any 
additional possibility of impairment to establish that counsel 
was ineffective under article I, sections 5 and 14 of the Hawai ʻi 
Constitution.”  141 Hawaiʻi at 206, 407 P.3d at 162.  And we 
opined that if, as he alleged, Maddox were denied his right to 
appeal by virtue of ineffective assistance of counsel, Maddox 
would be entitled to “pursue an appeal of [his original case.]”  
Id.  Here, as in Maddox, Villados was entirely deprived of the 
opportunity for Hawaiʻi Supreme Court review, so we need not and 
do not reach the merits of his underlying case to determine 
whether that denial “resulted in either the withdrawal or 
substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense” – 
the denial alone is enough to warrant relief.  Id. at 205, 407 
P.3d at 161 (quoting State v. Antone, 62 Haw. 346, 348–49, 615
P.2d 101, 104 (1980)).  But absent at least some inquiry into  the
merits, a new trial is not a remedy responsive to the error.
Indeed, many state courts have determined that in cases 
where appellate counsel was found ineffective but trial counsel 
was not, “[t]he proper remedy . . . is to return applicant to the 
point at which he can give notice of appeal.”  Ex parte Miller, 
330 S.W.3d 610, 626 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009); see
 trial, the district court concluded that remanding for a new 
trial, without pausing for a new appeal, was appropriate.”).***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
19 
 State v. Gross, 760 A.2d 725, 742 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2000) 
(holding that the appropriate relief for ineffective assistance 
of appellate counsel is the “awarding of a belated or new 
appeal,” noting that the relief “should be tailored to fit the 
deficiency” (quotation marks and citation omitted)); In re 
Alexandria G., 834 N.W.2d 432, 437 (Wisc. Ct. App. 2013) 
(holding that the appropriate remedy when appellate counsel was 
found ineffective for failing to file a timely appeal from the termination of parental rights before the deadline was extending 
time to file a notice of appeal, for such a remedy was “suited 
to the scope of the violation”). 
  Likewise, federal courts have found that “[i]n 
general, the appropriate remedy for ineffective assistance of 
appellate counsel is to grant a new appeal.”9  Lynch v. Dolce, 
789 F.3d 303, 320 (2d Cir. 2015); see Martin v. United States, 
81 F.3d 1083, 1084 (11th Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (“Because [the 
defendant] was entitled to appeal his sentence . . . and because 
the failure to file an appeal constituted ineffective assistance 
of counsel, we REVERSE and REMAND with instructions to grant 
                     
9  However, unlike in Hawaiʻ i, the United States Constitution does 
not guarantee the effective assistance of counsel on discretionary review.  
Wainwright v. Torna, 455 U.S. 586, 587
–88 (1982) (per curiam).  Nonetheless, 
federal precedent is instructive as to the appropriate remedy in this case, 
and indeed, federal statutes have been interpreted to provide that “a person 
whose federal conviction has been affirmed is entitled to a lawyer’s help in seeking certiorari[.] ”  Wilkins v. United States, 441 U.S. 468, 469 (1979); 
see also Nnebe v. United States, 534 F.3d 87, 91 (2d Cir. 2008). ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
20 relief allowing a direct appeal.”).  For instance, in United 
States v. Shedrick, 493 F.3d 292, 303 (3d Cir. 2007), the United 
States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that when 
ineffective assistance of appellate counsel prevented a 
defendant from filing a timely appeal, the appropriate remedy 
was to “vacate and remand for re-entry of the initial sentence 
so that there can be a timely appeal” because this would put the 
defendant “in the same position he would have been in if he had 
had effective assistance of counsel.”  Cf. Garza v. Idaho, 139 
S. Ct. 738, 749 (2019) (“When counsel’s deficient performance  
forfeits an appeal that a defendant otherwise would have taken,  
the defendant gets a new opportunity to appeal. . . .  That rule  
does no more than restore the status quo that existed before  
counsel’s deficient performance forfeited the appeal, and it  
allows an appellate court to consider the appeal as that court  
otherwise would have done[.]”).
And while not all jurisdictions have recognized a 
right to petition for certiorari or discretionary review as we 
did in Uchima, 147 Hawaiʻi at 73, 464 P.3d at 861, courts that do 
have found that providing a defendant with the opportunity to 
pursue the petition is the appropriate remedy when appellate 
counsel is ineffective by depriving them of that right.  See 
People v. Williams, 736 P.2d 1229, 1231 (Colo. App. 1986) 
(“Therefore, because a lack of effective assistance of counsel ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
21 
 denied defendant the opportunity to file a petition for a writ 
of certiorari in the Supreme Court, we hereby . . . grant 
defendant fourteen days from the date mandate issues in this 
case within which to file a petition in this court for 
rehearing[.]”); Kargus v. State, 169 P.3d 307, 312, 320 (Kan. 
2007) (holding that criminal defendants have a right to petition 
the Kansas Supreme Court for review, and denial of that right 
due to ineffective assistance of counsel requires the 
opportunity to re-petition).  
  In the instant case, counsel was ineffective in 
failing to file a timely application for writ of certiorari.  As 
in Maddox, and consistent with the approaches of other 
jurisdictions, a new trial would not be a remedy responsive to this error.  Instead, Villados should be entitled to “proceed 
with his appeal” to this court as if the ineffective assistance 
had not been rendered.  Maddox, 141 
Hawaiʻi at 208, 407 P.3d at 
164.   
  Accordingly, in order to effectuate this remedy and 
pursuant to our authority under HRS §§ 602-5(5) and 602-5(6), we vacate the judgment of the ICA in case number SCWC-30442 and 
instruct the ICA to reenter it within ten days of entry of the 
judgment on appeal in the instant case.  Villados shall 
accordingly be entitled to refile an application for writ of 
certiorari in case number SCWC-30442, State v. Villados, ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
22 challenging the merits of his original case pursuant to the 
reentered judgment on appeal.  The application for writ of 
certiorari must be filed in accordance with HRS § 602-59(c) and 
all other relevant statutes, and the Hawai ʻi Rules of Appellate   
(HRAP) Procedure.   
While we believe this to be the most efficient method 
for affording Villados relief, in future HRPP Rule 40 
proceedings where ineffective assistance of appellate counsel – 
whether for representation at the ICA or this court – is 
established and if the opportunity to pursue the underlying 
appeal is the appropriate remedy, we hold that granting such a 
remedy is within the trial court’s authority pursuant to HRPP 
40(g)(1) (“If the court finds in favor of the petitioner, it 
shall enter an appropriate order with respect to the judgment or 
sentence in the former proceeding, or with respect to custody 
based on such judgment, and such supplementary orders as to 
rearraignment, retrial, custody, bail, discharge or other 
matters as may be necessary or proper.”).  Pursuant to HRPP Rule 
40(g)(1), when the trial court finds that ineffective assistance 
of appellate counsel has been rendered on appeal to the ICA and 
a new appeal is the appropriate remedy, it may issue an order ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
23 
 vacating and reentering the trial court judgment in order for 
the defendant to pursue the appeal.10  
  In cases like this one, where the ineffective 
assistance of counsel arises on certiorari review, it is the 
ICA’s judgment on appeal that must be vacated and reentered.  In 
such a case, the trial court should conduct HRPP Rule 40 
proceedings in the usual course.  But such petitions need not be 
                     
10  We are aware that in State v. Mamalias, we held that a trial 
court does not have the authority to “extend[] the expired time for appeal in 
the underlying criminal case.”  69 Haw. 581, 582, 751 P.2d 1029, 1030 (1988).  
This is true – HRAP Rule 4 on its face does not allow for additional 
extensions of time in a criminal case beyond that provided in Rule 4(b)(5).  
We do not suggest that a trial court is empowered to ignore the plain 
language of the rule by extending the time to appeal.   
 But we also reject a reading of Mamalias that precludes any 
ability for a Rule 40 court to award relief for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.  Our holding today recognizes that ineffective assistance 
of counsel on appeal requires an appropriate remedy, as is reflected in our 
precedents establishing an appellate court does not necessarily lose 
jurisdiction over an untimely appeal when ineffective assistance causes the untimeliness.  State v. Erwin, 57 Haw. 268, 269, 554 P.2d 236, 238 (1976) 
(“[I]t is clear that an indigent criminal defendant is entitled, on his first 
appeal, to court- appointed counsel who may not deprive him of his appeal by 
electing to forego compliance with procedural rules.”).  Indeed, Uchima 
contemplated that the same relief an appellate court may provide in such a 
circumstance – the ability to proceed with the appeal – would be available 
following an HRPP Rule 40 proceeding.  147 Hawaiʻi at 81, 464 P.3d at 869 
(“[T]his court has discretionary authority to dismiss the application as untimely and require the defendant to proceed under HRPP Rule 40. . 
. .  In 
circumstances when the record is unclear [as to whether counsel was 
ineffective], the court may dismiss the application so that a proceeding may 
be commenced in the trial court pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(f).”).  We clarify today that the procedural means to effectuate such a remedy is the vacatur 
and reentry of the underlying judgment, affording the petitioner the 
opportunity to pursue a new appeal ( without altering, as the trial court in 
Mamalias attempted to, the time requirements imposed by statute and rule) .   
 Moreover, the trial court in Mamalias did not conduct a hearing 
on the merits of the HRPP Rule 40 petition before awarding such relief.  In 
contrast, the court’s authority to enter relief entitling the defendant to a 
new appeal is predicated upon the entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law establishing that (1) appellate counsel was ineffective and (2) a new 
appeal is the appropriate remedy.

 dismissed and appealed to this court in order to grant relief, 
as happened here.  Rather, upon entry of final judgment pursuant 
to an order determining that (1) appellate counsel was 
ineffective and (2) the opportunity to pursue certiorari review 
is the appropriate remedy, the petitioner may then move in the 
ICA for vacatur and reentry of the underlying judgment on 
appeal.   11
V. CONCLUSION 
  For the foregoing reasons, the ICA’s October 25, 2018 judgment on appeal is affirmed in part and reversed in part.  We 
affirm the judgment as to the determinations that appellate 
counsel was ineffective and that the proper remedy is the 
opportunity to seek review from this court, and reverse the 
denial of relief and dismissal of the HRPP Rule 40 petition.  We 
vacate the ICA’s January 4, 2012 judgment on appeal in State v. 
Villados, No. 30442, and instruct the ICA to reenter said  
  
                     
11  The trial court’s order and judgment on the HRPP Rule 40 petition 
would be subject to appeal in the normal course before taking final effect.  
HRPP Rule 40(h) (“Any party may appeal from a judgment entered in the proceeding in accordance with Rule 4(b) of the [HRAP].”).  Accordingly, the 
subsequent motion to vacate and reenter the judgment brought before the ICA 
would not, absent unusual circumstances, present the opportunity to 
relitigate whether appellate counsel had been ineffective.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  ***
