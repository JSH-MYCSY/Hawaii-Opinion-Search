SCWC-15-0000131 09-JUN-2017 
01:48 PM 
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI I 
STATE OF HAWAI I,
  
Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee,
  
 
vs.
  
 
THEODORICO ERUM, JR.,
  
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant.
  
 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS  
(CAAP-15
-0000131; CASE NO. 5DCC-14-0000212) 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
When a defendant elects to proceed pro se, the record must 
indicate that the defendant was offered counsel, but he or 
she “voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently rejected the 
offer and waived that right. ” The trial court must ensure 
two requirements are met: first, the waiver of counsel is “knowingly and intelligently” made, and second, “the record 
is complete so as to reflect that waiver.” The latter 
requirement arises because appellate courts are charged  
  
 
 
 
        
 
        
 
        
 
        
         
 
 with determining from the record whether there was an 
unequivocal waiver, which was voluntarily and freely made.  
135 Hawai i at 512, 353 P.3d at 1054 (citing State v. Dickson , 4 
Haw. App. 614, 619, 
621, 673 P.2d 1036, 1041-42 (1983)) 
(footnote omitted). The record here does not reflect that the 
district court was made aware that defendant may have previously 
been a licensed attorney. Our review of the adequacy of the 
colloquy is confined to what was in the record before the 
district court at the time the colloquy took place.
