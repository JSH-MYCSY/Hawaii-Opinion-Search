SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER  
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.) 
I. Introduction 
Theodorico Erum, Jr. (“Erum”) seeks review of the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals’ (“ICA”) July 21, 2016 Judgment on 
Appeal (“ICA judgment on appeal”), entered pursuant to its June 
22, 2016 Summary Disposition Order (“SDO”), which affirmed the 
District Court of the Fifth Circuit’s (“district court”) 
Judgment/Order and Notice of Entry of Judgment/Order entered on 
November 13, 2014. 
Erum has proceeded pro se at every stage of this case.  The 
record on appeal, which was supplemented by order of this court  
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
   
                     
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
   
     
   
 
   
   
   
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
with the audio recordings of the arraignment held August 6, 2014 
and the bench trial held November 13, 2014,1 does not indicate a 
valid waiver of counsel.  We therefore vacate the district 
court’s judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent 
with this summary disposition order. 
II. Background 
A. District Court Proceedings 
After an incident relating to a property dispute between 
Erum and the complaining witness, the State of Hawai ‘i (“State”) 
charged Erum with two offenses: Simple Trespass, in violation of 
Hawai‘i Revised Statutes (“HRS”) § 708– 815 (1993)2, and 
Harassment, in violation of HRS § 711 –1106 (2014)3. 
1 This court ordered that the record be supplemented in the certiorari 
proceedings pursuant to Rule 10(e)(2)( C) of the Hawai ‘i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure, which states: 
If anything material to any party is omitted from the 
record by error or 
accident or is misstated therein, 
corrections or modifications may be as follows: 
. . . .  
(C)
 by direction of the appellate court before which the 
case is pending, on proper suggestion or its own initiative 
. . . .  
2 HRS § 708- 815 provides, “ A person commits the offense of simple 
trespass if the person knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in or upon 
premises.” 
3 HRS § 711- 1106 provides in relevant part: 
(1) A person commits the offense of harassment if, with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other person, that 
person: 
(a) Strikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touches another 
person in an offensive manner or subjects the other person 
to offensive physical contact [.]

  At Erum’s August 6, 2014 arra ignment, the following 
exchange took place:  
 
Erum: Uh if you give me a moment, your honor, I’ll read it 
and then I’ll wa ive my reading out loud.  
 
Court: Okay.
  
 
Erum: I read the complaint, your honor.
  
 
 
 
Erum:  
 
Court: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Court: Mr. Erum if you’ll take a look at the amended 
complaint, would you like those two charges read out loud 
in court this morning?  
Court: 
Alright, are you waiving public reading of the 
charges?
 
Yes, your honor.
 
Defendant waives reading of the charges. Count I, 
the harassment count, is a jailable offense.  Normally when 
a defendant is charged with a jailable offense, what the 
court normally does is enter not guilty pleas and then we 
refer you to the Office of the Public Defender if you wish 
to apply for services. In the alternative, if you wanted 
to hire private counsel, you can make those arrangements on 
your own. So we normally enter a not guilty plea, and 
rather than set a trial date immediately, we set a kind of 
a status date, so you can receive discovery and if you have 
an attorney, you can discuss your case with your attorney. 
Would you like us to do that or are you requesting that I 
actually set a trial date already?
 
Erum: 
Um I would like the trial date to be set.
 
Court: 
Okay. So not guilty pleas are entered. Rule 48 
please. 
. . . .
  
Now um do you intend to apply for attorney’s services at 
the Office of the Public Defender or to consult with 
private counsel?  
 
Erum: 
I’ll take that into consideration, your honor. I 
don’t --
Court: I just want to let you know because [the State is] 
not going be communicating directly with you unless and 
until there’s a waiver of your right to counsel, and I 
don’t want you to waive counsel until you’ve actually made 
that decision and it’s knowing. So -- 
Erum: 
I understand, your honor. 
Court: 
You can go to the Public Defender’s office this 
morning with your paperwork and fill out an application. 
3
  
 
 
  
Erum:  
 
4  The bench trial was held on November 13, 2014.   The 
district court addressed Erum’s right to counsel in the 
following exchange:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Court:
 
 
 
                     
   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
My recommendation is that you do that sooner rather than 
later. 
If you do that and ultimately for whatever reason 
you decide you want to be a pro se defendant, you can 
always stop having counsel but at least you’ll be able to 
consult with counsel and have someone representing you and 
then get discovery from the prosecutor’s office.  
Okay, thank you. 
Court: You do have one of these as a petty misdemeanor 
which carries a sentence of up to thirty days in jail, you understand that you -- weren’t you referred to the Public 
Defender’s office? 
Erum: Uh is that a question to me, your honor? 
Court: Yes. 
Erum: Yes, your honor. 
Judge, uh, judge referred me to 
the Public Defender’s office. Court: And you chose not to go? Erum: No, I didn’t choose not to go, it’s just that I’m 
not an indigent person. Court: Ok. And you don’t choose to hire your own attorney 
in this case? 
Erum: Uh yes, in this short space of time I was not able 
to get an attorney. 
Court: If you wanted additional time in which to hire an 
attorney, I would grant you additional time. 
Erum: At this point, uh, at this point of the proceedings, 
your honor, and my discussions with the State of Hawai ’i 
prosecuting attorney, leads me to believe that we should go 
forward today. 
 Okay. 
But it’s not just your discussions, what I’m 
saying is notwithstanding your discussions with the 
prosecuting attorney, if you felt like you needed time to 
hire your own attorney, I would grant that time to you. Do 
you understand that? 
Erum: 
I understand. 
The Honorable Joe P. Moss presided.

Court:
 
Erum:  
  
 
 
  
  
 
 In its SDO, the ICA affirmed the district court judgment. 
As to Erum’s first point of error, the ICA concluded, “Erum does 
not explain how the District Court’s failure to enter findings 
or conclusions equates with the State’s failure to prove every 
element of the offense or the offender’s alleged state of mind, 
so that argument fails.” As to Erum’s s econd point of error, 
the ICA determined that, without a transcript, there was no 
basis upon which to rule on the merits of his claim. As to 
Erum’s third point of error, the ICA concluded that absent the 
bench trial transcript and the transcript of the hearing on *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
 Knowing that you wish to go forward?   
I wish to go forward.
 
At the conclusion of the bench trial, the district court 
found Erum guilty as charged, and ordered him to pay fines and a fee totaling $330.00. 
B. Appeal to the ICA 
On appeal to the 
ICA, Erum alleged the district court: (1) 
erred in failing to enter findings of fact and conclusions of 
law that sufficiently demonstrated that each element of the 
criminal charges was proved beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) 
lacked authority to determine whether the complaining witness 
was the owner of the property on which the trespass allegedly occurred; and (3) erred in denying Erum ’s motion for a new 
trial. 
5
  
 
 
  
   
  
 
 
   
 “Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may 
be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of 
the court.” Hawai‘ i Rules of Penal Procedure (“HRPP”) Rule 52 (b)  
(2000). This court has the inherent power to notice plain error 
sua sponte. State v. Fields , 115 Hawai ‘i 503, 528, 168 P.3d 955, 
980 (2007), as amended on denial of reconsideration  (Oct. 10, 
2007).  
 If a defendant’s substantial rights have been adversely 
affected, the error will be deemed plain error. State v. 
Nichols, 111 Hawai‘ i 327, 334, 141 P.3d 974, 981 (2006).  
Substantial rights include constitutional rights. See State v.  
Uyesugi, 100 Hawai‘ i 442, 449, 60 P.3d 843, 850 (2002) (noting   *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
Erum’s motion for a new trial, it was “unable to determine 
whether the trial court abused its discretion[.]” 
III. Standards of Review 
A. Waiver of Counsel 
When a defendant elects to proceed pro se, the record must 
indicate that the defendant was offered counsel, but he or 
she ‘voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently rejected the offer and waived that right.’ The trial court must ensure 
two requirements are met: first, the waiver of counsel is 
‘knowingly and intelligently’ made, and second, ‘the record 
is complete so as to reflect that waiver.’  
State v. Phua , 135 Hawai ‘i 504, 51 2, 353 P.3d 1046, 1054 
(2015) (quoting State v. Dickson , 4 Haw. App. 614, 619, 673 
P.2d 1036, 1041 (1983)). 
B. Plain Error Review 
6

  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
that a substantial right under plain error review includes 
constitutional rights, such as the right to trial). “[T]his 
[c]ourt will apply the plain error standard of review to correct 
errors which seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public 
reputation of judicial proceedings, to serve the ends of 
justice, and to prevent the denial of fundamental rights.”  
State v. Sawyer , 88 Hawai ‘i 325, 330, 966 P.2d 637, 642 (1998).  
IV.
 Discussion 
On certiorari, Erum argues that the ICA’s affirmance of the 
district court’s judgment was erroneous because: (1) the 
district court failed to enter findings of fact or conclusions 
of law; (2) the district court determined that the complaining 
witness was the owner of the property; and (3) the district 
court denied Erum’s motion for a new trial while his civil case 
regarding the property was on appeal. 
The record on appeal to the ICA did not contain any 
transcripts; therefore, the ICA did not err with respect to its 
determination of the issues Erum raised on appeal.  In general, 
it is the appellant’s burden to provide the appellate court with 
the record on appeal. However, because Erum has never been 
represented by counsel in this case, we engage in a plain error 
review only to determine whether Erum’s constitut ional right to 
counsel may have been affected. 
7
  
 
 
    
 The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as 
applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, and 
article I, section 14 of the Hawai‘ i Constitution guarantee a 
person accused of a crime the right to counsel at every critical stage of prosecution. 
State v. Merino , 81 Hawai‘ i 198, 219, 915 
P.2d 672, 693 (1996).   A “critical stage” of prosecution 
includes “any stage where potential substantial prejudice to [a] 
defendant’s rights inheres[.]” Phua, 135 Hawai ‘i at 512, 353 
P.3d at 1054 (internal citation omitted).  
 
  
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
A. Requirements for a Valid Waiver of Right to Counsel 
There are two general requirements for a valid waiver of 
counsel: first, the waiver of counsel must be “knowingly and 
intelligently” made, and second, “the record [must be] complete 
so as to reflect that waiver.” Id. 
at 512, 353 P.3d at 1054 
(internal citation omitted).  The latter requirement enables 
appellate courts to determine from the record whether there was 
an unequivocal waiver, which was voluntarily and freely made. 
Id.  
“In determining the legal adequacy of waiver of counsel, 
the question is whether, considering the totality of the 
circumstances, the waiver was voluntarily and intelligently 
undertaken.” State v. Dicks , 57 Haw. 46, 49, 549 P.2d 727, 730 
(1976). There are “three areas of ‘specific waiver inquiry’ 
factors to assist trial courts: (1) the particular facts and 
8

  
 
 
 Id.
  
 
 
 
   
  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
circumstances relating to the defendant that indicate the 
defendant’s level of comprehension; (2) the defendant’s 
awareness of the risks of self-representation; and (3) the 
defendant’s awareness of the disadvantages of self -
representation.” Phua, 135 Hawai‘ i at 512, 353 P.3d at 1054 
(citing Dickson, 4 Haw. App. at 618, 673 P.2d at 1041). “The 
extent and depth of the court’s inquiry and explanation of the 
second and third factors should respond to the court’s 
perception of the defendant’s level of understanding.” Id.  at 
514, 353 P.3d at 1056. “While courts are not required to strictly adhere to Dickson’s analytical framework, it provides 
an important tool to ensure waivers are made knowingly and 
intelligently in addition to establishing a complete record for 
appellate review.”   at 513, 353 P.3d at 1055.  
B. There was No Valid Waiver of Counsel 
In this case, there was no written waiver of counsel in the 
record on appeal. Thus, we review the recordings of the 
district court’s oral colloquies, as outlined abo ve, to 
ascertain whether there wa
s a valid waiver of counsel. 
1. Defendant’s Level of Comprehension 
The first prong of the Phua test recommends the court 
“explore facts and circumstances pertaining to the defendant that will allow the court to determine the defendant’s level of 
comprehension. Such circumstances include age, education, 
9
  
 
 
  
 Here, the recordings reveal the court did not inquire about 
Erum’s background. The record does not contain any evidence 
that prior to the arraignment, the district court was privy to 
any information regarding Erum’s mental capacity, employment 
background or prior experience with the criminal justice system-
-all factors that would be necessary to determine Erum’s level 
of comprehension and thus his ability to intelligently and 
5 knowingly waive his right to counsel.   The district court, 
therefore, did not meet the first prong of the test discussed in 
Phua.  
     
   
 
  
                     
  
   
 
   
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
English language skills, mental capacity, employment background, 
and prior experience with the criminal justice system.” Id. at 
513, 353 P.3d at 1055. Ascertaining the defendant’s level of 
comprehension is necessary for the court to know the extent to 
which it must warn the defendant of the risks o
f self-
representation and the potential disadvantages of choosing to proceed pro se. 
Id.  
2.
	 Defendant’s awareness of the risks of self -
representation
 
The second prong of the Phua test recommends the court warn 
the defendant of the risks particular to the defendant in 
proceeding without counsel by making the defendant “aware of the 
On July 2, 2015, Erum filed a Motion For Relief From Default and For 
Extension Of Time To File Jurisdictional Statement And Opening Brief. The 
motion indicated that he was 82 years old and allegedly had a “poor memory 
associated with [his] age.” 
10
 5  
 
 
  In Dickson , the ICA determined that although “Defendant 
made a clear and unequivocal demand to represent himself” and 
“[t]he record also indicate[d] that Defendant’s decision was 
freely and voluntarily made . . . the record [did] not show that the trial judge sufficiently informed Defendant of the dangers 
and disadvantages of proceeding pro se, or made sufficient 
inquiry into his awareness thereof.” Dickson, 4 Haw. App. at 
622, 673 P.2d at 1043 (italics omitted). The ICA concluded that under these facts, “the record does not indicate that Defendant 
made a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel.” Id.  at 623, 
673 P.2d at 1043. 
 Although the district court infor med Erum, “You do have one 
of these [charges] as a petty misdemeanor that carries a 
sentence of up to thirty days in jail,” it did not address the 
other factors under this second prong. Therefore, the second 
Phua prong is also not satisfied.  *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
nature of the charge, the elements of the offense, the pleas and 
defenses available, the punishments which may be imposed, and 
all other facts essential to a broad understanding of the whole 
matter.” Phua, 135 Hawai ‘i at 514-15, 353 P.3d at 1056-57 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). “[T]he 
judge’s warnings must reflect more than ‘ vague, general 
admonishments, without reference to specific risks or 
disadvantages.’”  Id.  at 514, 353 P.3d at 1056.  
11

  
 
 
    
   
 
 The final prong of the Phua  test is whether the court 
informed the defendant of the disadvantages of self-
representation before a waiver of the right to counsel is 
obtained. Phua, 135 Hawai ‘i at 51 5, 353 P.3d at 1057.  This 
includes the requirement that the trial court “meaningfully 
inform the defendant of his or her right to the assistance of 
counsel.” Id.  Such information may be conveyed by asking the 
following questions:  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 Furthermore, in addition to conveying this information to 
the defendant, 
 
 *** NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST’S HAWAIʻ I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER  *** 
3.	 Defendant ’s awareness of the disadvantage of self -
representation 
Because of the seriousness of the offense and the serious 
consequences of being found guilty, do you understand that 
you have a Constitutional right to be represented by an 
attorney at a sentencing hearing? 
Do you understand that if you cannot afford an attorney, 
you have the right to have free legal representation 
through the public defender’ s office or a court appointed 
lawyer? 
Id. (footnote omitted).   
the trial court should inform the defendant: of his right 
to counsel, whether private or appointed . . . that self -
representation is detrimental to himself; that he will be 
required to follow all technical rules and substantive, 
procedural, and evidentiary law; that the prosecution will 
be represented by able counsel; that a disruption of the 
trial could lead to vacation of the right to self -
representation; and that if voluntary self -representation 
occurs, the defendant may not afterward claim that he had inadequate representation.  
Dickson, 4 Haw. App. at 620, 673 P.2d at 1041 –42 (internal 
citation omitted).

At the start of the bench trial, the court asked Erum if he 
was referred to the Public Defender’s office. Erum stated he 
“didn’t choose not to go [to the Public Defender’s office], it’s 
just that [he was] not an indigent person.” Erum also stated 
that “in [the] short space of time [before the bench trial] [he] 
was not able to get an attorney.” The court informed Erum he 
could have more time to find an attorney, but did not take any 
steps to advise Erum of the potential risks involved in self-
representation. Thus, the third prong of the Phua test is not 
satisfied. 
V. Conclusion 
Accordingly, based on the totality of circumstances, there 
was no valid waiver of counsel in this case.  We therefore 
vacate the ICA judgment on appeal as well as the district court 
judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this 
summary disposition order.
