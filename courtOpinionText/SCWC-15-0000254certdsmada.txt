CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

ORDER DISMISSING APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
On August 3, 2015, petitioner/defendant-appellant
 
Marcelo Magno Lopez, Jr. (“Lopez”) filed an application for writ
 
of certiorari to review the Intermediate Court of Appeals’ May
 19, 2015 order dismissing his appeal. The application for writ
 of certiorari was initially due on June 18, 2015. See HRS § 602­59(c) (Supp. 2014); HRAP Rule 40.1(a)(1). Lopez, however, timely
 
requested and received an extension of time to file the
 application for writ of certiorari, thereby extending the
 deadline for filing the application for writ of certiorari an
 additional thirty days, to July 20, 2015. See HRS § 602-59(c);
 
HRAP Rule 40.1(a)(3); HRAP Rule 26(a). Lopez filed his
 application for writ of certiorari on August 3, 2015. The
 application for writ of certiorari is untimely, and this court
 lacks appellate jurisdiction. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the application for writ of
 
certiorari is dismissed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, September 15, 2015.
