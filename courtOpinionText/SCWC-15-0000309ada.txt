CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
 
JANUARY 21, 2020 
 
RECKTENWALD, C.J., NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, POLLACK, AND WILSON, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.  
 
I. Introduction 
 
This certiorari proceeding arises from two cases filed and 
consolidated in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (“circuit 
court”) concerning a foreclosure dispute between the Villages of 
Kapolei Association (“Association”), the Hawaiʻi Ho
using Finance 
and Development Corporation (“HHFDC”), John ny Kinman Chan and 
Jean Toshiko Chan (“Chans”), and American Savings Bank, F.S.B. 
(“ASB”).  Th e dispute concerns the circuit court’s determination 
of lien priority between the Association ’s and HHFDC’s competing 
liens and the valuation of HHFDC’s  senior lien .  The underlying 
foreclosure of ASB’s first mortgage lien is not in dispute. 
The Association’s application for writ of certiorari 
(“Application”) raises three 
issues.  First, the Association 
contends the Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ ICA”) erred by 
affirming the circuit court ’s alleged retroactive application of 
Hawaiʻi Revised S
tatutes (“ HRS”) § 201H-47 (Supp. 2009) to rule ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 that HHFDC’s lien was senior and superior to the Association’s 
liens.  We hold that the ICA did not err because (1) whether the 
circuit court actually applied HRS § 201H-47 was unclear; (2) 
HHFDC had lien priority over the Association’s liens pursuant to  
HRS § 201E-221 (repealed 1997), the statute in effect when the 
deed and 
Shared Appreciation or Equity (“SAE”) Agreement between 
the Chans and HHFDC’s predecessor -in-interest, the Housing 
Finance and Development Corporation (“HFDC”) were entered; and 
(3) HHFDC had lien priority over the Association pursuant to the 
“first in time, first in right” principle and the SAE Agreement, 
which was incorporated into the deed.  
Second, the Association asserts  the ICA erred by ignoring 
the plain language of Sections 1, 2, 3, and 7 of the SAE 
Agreement relating to the applicability of the agreement’s 
appraisal process and whether the SAE Agreement became null and 
void upon ASB’s 
foreclosure.  We hold the ICA did not err in 
determining the appraisal process applied and that ASB’s 
foreclosure did not nullify the SAE Agreement
. 
Third, the Association argues  the ICA erred by holding that 
HHFDC had rights under the SAE Agreement because there were 
genuine issues of material fact regarding HHFDC’s standing to 
enforce the agreement.  We hold that, as a matter of law, HHFDC 
had standing to enforce the SAE Agreement as successor to HFDC ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 pursuant to Act 350 
of 1997 and Act 196 of 2005.  1997 Haw. 
Sess. Laws Act 350; 2005 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 196. 
We therefore affirm the ICA’s August 20, 2019 judgment o n 
appeal. 
II.  Background  
A.  Factual Background 
 
1.   History of HHFDC 
 
 Act 337 of 1987 established HFDC to promote affordable 
housing.  1987 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 337, § 15 (§- 5) at 1049 
(codified at HRS ch. 201E (repealed 1997)).  Act 350 of 1997 
combined HFDC with the Hawai ʻi Housing Authority and Rental 
Housing Trust Fund to create the Housing and Community 
Development Corporation of Hawaiʻi (“HCDCH”).  1997 Haw. Sess. 
Laws Act 350, § 2 (§-2) at 1013 (codified at HRS ch. 201G 
(repealed 2006)).  Act 350 stated that HCDCH would “succeed to 
all of the rights and powers previously exercised”  by HFDC, and 
that “[a]ll deeds, leases, contracts . . . or other documents 
executed or entered into by or on behalf of [HFDC] . . . shall 
remain in full force and effect.”  Act 350,  § 20 at 1091. 
 
Act 196 of 2005 split HCDCH into the Hawai ʻi Public Housing 
Administration and HHFDC.  2005 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 196, § 19 at 
620 (codified at HRS ch. 201H (Supp. 2005)).  Act 196 
transferred “[a]ll rights, powers, fun ctions, and duties of 
[HCDCH]” relating to state housing and financing programs to ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
5 (continued. . .)  
 HHFDC.  § 22 at 631
.  Act 196 also stated that “[a]ll deeds, 
leases, contracts . . . or other documents executed or entered 
into by or on behalf of [HCDCH] or [HFDC] . . . which are made 
applicable to [HHFDC] by this Act, shall remain in full force 
and effect.” 
 § 25 at 632 . 
2.  The Chans purchase the Villages of Kapolei property 
 
On June 6, 1991, the Chans purchased a ho use (“Property”) 
in the Villages of Kapolei, a planned affordable housing 
community created by HFDC .  The Chans purchased the Property 
through HFDC’s SAE Program, which allowed participants to 
purchase a home at a discounted price in exchange for an 
agreement (“SAE Agreement”) granting 
HFDC a share of the 
appreciation of the home’s equity  (“Net Appreciation”) if the 
property were ever sold or transferred.1   
                                                           
1  Section 1.F of the SAE Agreement defined “Net Appreciation” as:  
Fair Market Value of the Property  
 
minus Grantee’s Original Purchase Price  
 
minus The amount obtained by multiplying the following 
fraction: 
 
Fair Market Value of the Property divided by Actual Sale 
Price by the sum of the following sales and closing 
expenses which the Grantee actually pays in the case of a 
bona fide arm’s length sale ( but not including a 
foreclosure sale) of the Property: (i) escrow fees, (ii) 
title report fees (not including any title insurance 
premiums), (iii) drafting of conveyance documents, (iv) 
conveyance taxes, (v)
 notary fees, (vi) recording fees and 
(vii) real estate commissions.  (The foregoing fraction 
shall not exceed a value of “1”.)  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
6 
 Section 2 of the SAE Agreement outlined
 when HFDC would be 
entitled to its share of the Net Appreciation value and how 
HFDC’s share would be calculated: 
Except for a “Permitted Transfer”, as that term is defined 
below, the Grantee  promises and agrees that if and when all 
or any part of or interest in the Property is sold or 
transferred or if the Grantee shall be divested of title or 
any interest in the Property, in any manner, voluntarily or 
involuntarily, including a judicial or nonjudicial 
foreclosure sale, HFDC will immediately be entitled to a  
share of the Net Appreciation equal to:  
 
HFDC’s Percentage Share2 x Net Appreciation  
 
The SAE Agreement was incorporated into the Chans’ deed, 
which was recorded in Land Court on June 12, 1991.   
 The Chans financed their pur
chase of the Property through a 
$111,896 loan secured by a June 6, 1991 mortgage to ASB.  
Section 7 of the SAE Agreement,  titled “First Mortgage 
Protection,” granted ASB’s mortgage priority over HFDC’s liens 
in the event of foreclosure.   Section 7 also provided that “any 
person who acquires legal title to the Property as a result of 
foreclosure” would acquire title free of HFDC ’s liens, and that 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
(. . .continued) 
Section 1.E of the SAE Agreement defined “Fair Market Value” as “the 
fair market value of the Property as determined by an appraisal obtained and 
performed in the manner described below in Section 3. if and when the Grantee 
subsequently sells or transfers the Property.”  
Because this case involved a foreclosure sale, the “amount obtained by 
multiplying the following fraction” was zero.  (Fair Market Value / Actual 
Sale Price x 0 = 0)  Therefore, the Net Appreciation equaled the Fair Market 
Value of the Property minus the Grantee’ s Original Purchase Price.  
  
2  Section 1.C of the SAE Agreement provided that HFDC’s Percentage Share 
was 62% and was calculated by subtracting the Chans’ original purchase price 
of the Property ($111,400) from the Property’s original fair market value 
($296,400), then dividing the total by the original fair market value 
($296,400) and rounding to the nearest percent.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
7 (continued. . .)
 the SAE Agreement would be “null and void upon a conveyance of 
the Property through a foreclosure sale . . . . ” 
Upon signing the deed, the Chans also agreed to the 
Association’s Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and  
Restrictions (“Covenants”) .  On November 14, 2006, the 
Association recorded a $26,687.30 judgment lien against the 
Property in Land Court for the Chans’ failure to adhere to 
landscaping requirements in violation of the Covenants.  On 
September 5, 2012, the Association filed a $5,763.66 lien 
against the Property in Land Court because the Chans failed to 
pay for maintenance assessments  in violation of the  Covenants.  
On December 3, 2012, ASB sent the Chans a n otice of d efault 
demanding payment on the mortgage.  
B.  Circuit Court Proceedings 
 
 On October 1, 2012, the Association filed a complaint for 
foreclosure.  On March 28, 2013, ASB filed a complaint for 
foreclosure alleging the Chans had defaulted on the loan and 
mortgage, and that the mortgage was the “valid first lien upon 
the property . . . . ”  ASB’s complaint named the Association as 
a defendant, and HHFDC was later identified and made a party 
defendant.3 
                                                           
3  The Association and ASB’s complaints named the Chans as defendants .  
The circuit court entered default against the Chans for failure to  respond to 
both complains.  The Director of Taxation for the State of Hawai ʻi and Capital 
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
8 
  On September 20, 2013, ASB filed a 
motion for summary 
judgment.  The parties stipulated to consolidate the ASB and the 
Association foreclosure actions.  The circuit court granted 
ASB’s motion and entered a 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Civil Procedure 
(“HRCP”) Rule 54(b) judgment on May 12, 2014 .4 
 On April 22, 2014, HHFDC filed a m otion for summary 
judgment (“HHFDC’s motion for summary j udgment”), arguing that 
its lien was senior and superior to all other liens except ASB’s  
under the “first in time, first in right” principle.   HHFDC 
asserted it had assumed HFDC’s rights under the deed by statute .  
HHFDC contended that HRS § 201H-47(e)5 entitled HHRDC to its Net 
Appreciation share when a foreclosure action is filed, and that 
the SAE lien was a covenant running with the land under  
HRS § 201H-47(a)(6).  HHFDC asserted its Net Appreciation share 
was $244,032, and it attached a copy of a November 2013 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
(. . .continued) 
One Bank (USA), N.A. were also named as defendants.  However, these 
defendants are not actively involved in the current appeal.  
 
4   The Honorable Judge Bert I. Ayabe presided.  
 
5   HRS § 201H- 47(e) (Supp. 2009) (amended 2018)  read, in relevant part:  
 
The restrictions prescribed in this section . . . shall be 
automatically extinguished and shall not attach in 
subsequent transfers of title when a mortgage holder or 
other party becomes the owner of the real property pursuant 
to a mortgage foreclosure, foreclosure under power of sale, 
or conveyance in lieu of foreclosure after a foreclosure 
action is commenced; provided that the mortgage is the 
initial purchase money  mortgage . . . . The corporation 
shall be a party to any foreclosure action, and shall be 
entitled to its share of appreciation in the real property 
as determined under this chapter in lien priority when the 
payment is applicable  . . . . ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***

 appraisal prepared by Appraiser Kathy Ann Oshiro (“Appraiser 
Oshiro”) valuing 
the Property at $505,000. 
 The Association oppos
ed HHFDC’s motion for summary 
judgment, arguing that “HHFDC had based almost its entire 
argument on HRS § 201H
-47,” which was not retro active, and that 
any retroactive application of HRS § 201H-47 would 
unconstitutionally 
impair the Association’s vested rights .  The 
Association contended that, under Section 7, HHFDC’s SAE 
Agreement rights were extinguished when ASB foreclosed on its 
mortgage.6  The Association also argued that, even if HHFDC had 
                                                           
6  Section 7 of the SAE Agreement provides:  
 
FIRST MORTGAGE PROTECTION  
 
  The foregoing provisions shall not apply with respect to:  
 
(a) The first purchase money mortgage (“First 
Mortgage”), if any, which is being placed on the 
Property.  
(b) The first purchase money mortgagee (“First 
Mortgagee”) named in the First Mortgage, including 
the first purchase money mortgagee’s successors 
and assigns.  
(c) The rights of the First Mortgagee to foreclose 
or take title pursuant to the remedies in the 
First Mortgage, to accept a deed in lieu of  
foreclosure in the event of default by the 
Grantee, as mortgagor under the First Mortgage, or 
to sell or lease the Property acquired by the 
First Mortgagee.  
(d) Any Person or persons acquiring the Property as 
a result of foreclosure or by a deed in lieu of 
foreclosure of the First Mortgage or any 
successor, transferee, or assignee of such person 
or persons.  
. . . . 
HFDC specifically subordinates any lien or contingent lien 
rights that HFDC may have under this Exhibit C to the lien 
of the First Mortgage.  Any holder of the First Mortgage or 
any person who acquires legal title to the Property as a 
result of a foreclosure or a deed in lieu of foreclosure of

 an interest in the SAE Agreement, 
the agreement limited HHFDC’s 
interest to the proceeds the Chans  would “realize”  from the 
transfer or sale of the Property7 — “[i]n other words, HHFDC 
would recover from the proceeds remaining after payment of all 
liens and encumbrances.”  The Association maintained that HHFDC 
did not comply with Section 3 of the SAE Agreement because 
Appraiser Oshiro was not sufficiently qualified to appraise the 
Property and HHFDC had not timely notified the Chans of the 
appraisal.  Finally, the Association contended that HHFDC lacked 
standing to foreclose because neither Act 180 n or Act 196 stated 
that HHFDC had assumed the Chan deed.  
On September 23, 2014, the day before a hearing on HHFDC’s 
motion for summary judgment, HHFDC filed an updated appraisal 
(the “September Appraisal”) prepared by Appraiser  Oshiro, this 
time under the supervision of an appraiser who was sufficiently 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
(. . .continued)  
the First Mortgage shall acquire legal title free of such 
lien or contingent lien rights that HFDC may have under 
this Exhibit C.  This Exhibit C shall be null and void upon 
a conveyance of the Property through a foreclosure sale or 
a deed in lieu of foreclosure.  
 
(Emphasis added.) 
 
7  The SAE Agreement provides, in relevant part: “Under the Program, which 
is described in this Exhibit C, the Grantee agrees to pay to HFDC a share of 
the “Net Appreciation” which the Grantee realizes or is deemed to have 
realized upon the sale or transfer of the Property  . . . .”   
 The SAE Agreement did not define the meaning of “realizes or is deemed 
to have realized.”  Black’s Law Dictionary defines “realization” as: 
“Conversion of noncash assets into cash assets.”  Realization, Black’s Law 
Dictionary (11th ed. 2019).

 qualified under the SAE Agreement.  The September  Appraisal 
claimed the current fair market value of the Property was 
$480,000 and that HHFDC’s Net Appreciation share was $228,532.8 
On December 9, 2014, ASB filed a m otion for confirmation of 
sale, asking the circuit court to determine the priority of the 
parties’ claims and the amount of HHFDC’s claim .  On January 15, 
2015, a hearing was held on ASB’s motion for c onfirmation of 
sale at which bidding was reopened, and the Association 
purchased the Property for $370,000.  The Association argued 
that the Property’s fair market value should equal the $370,000 
purchase price.  
On March 4, 2015, the circuit court entered an  order 
granting HHFDC’s motion for summary judgment (“ order granting 
HHFDC’s motion for s ummary judgment”) , ruling that HHFDC’s lien 
was senior and superior to the Association’s .  On the same day, 
the court entered an  order granting ASB’s motion for  
confirmation of s ale (“order confirming sale”) and judgment on 
the order (“March 4, 2015 judgment”).9 
                                                           
8  HHFDC determined  that the Net Appreciation of the Property was $368,600 
by subtracting the Chans’ original purchase price ($111,400) from the 
September Appraisal’s fair market value ($480,000).  HHFDC then determined 
its Net Appreciation share was $228,532 by multiplying its percentage share 
(62%) by the Net Appreciation ($368,600).  
9   The March 4, 2015 judgment appears to mistakenly refer to the order 
granting ASB’s m otion for summary j udgment.  However, the March 4, 2015 
Judgment provides the hearing date for ASB’s motion for c onfirmation of sale.  
Furthermore, the o rder granting ASB’s m otion for summary j udgment and 
corresponding judgment were entered on May 12, 2014.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
12 
 On March 9, 2015, the circuit court filed a minute order 
concluding the fair market value of the Property was 
$480,000 
and that HHFDC’s Net Appreciation value was $228,532.  
On March 25, 2015, HHFDC submitted a proposed f urther o rder 
regarding ASB’s motion for confirmation of s ale (“further o rder 
re: confirmation of sale”) stating that $480,000 was the fair 
market value of the Property and that HHFDC’s Net Appreciation 
value was $228,532.  On April 2, 2015, the Association appealed 
under CAAP-15-0000309 the order granting HHFDC’s motion for 
summary judgment, order c onfirming sale, the March 4, 2015 
judgment, and the proposed further o rder re: c onfirmation of 
sale, which the court had not yet entered.  
On April 16, 2015, the circuit court entered judgment on 
the order granting HHFDC’s motion for s ummary judgment  
(“judgment on order granting HHFDC’s motion for summary 
judgment”).  On April 17, 2015, the circuit court entered the 
further order re: confirmation of s ale.  The Association filed a
motion for reconsideration of the f urther o rder re: confirmation
of sale on April 27, 2015 (“ motion for reconsideration”).  10 
 
 On May 7, 2015, the Association appealed under CAAP- 15-
                                                           
10  According to the Association, as of the filing of its opening brief on 
September 8, 2015, the circuit court had “not disposed of the Motion for 
Reconsideration and it is therefore deemed denied pursuant to Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (“HRAP”) Rule 4(a)(3).”

 0000395 the further o rder re: confirmation of s ale and j udgment 
on order granting HHFDC’s motion for s ummary judgment.  
On June 4, 2015, the ICA consolidated the Association’s 
appeals under CAAP- 15-0000309.  
C.  ICA Proceedings 
 
1.   The Association’s Arguments  
 
On appeal  to the ICA, the Association repeated the 
arguments in its opposition to HHFDC’s motion for summary 
judgment. 
Additionally, the  Association argued that, if HHFDC had  a 
valid lien, HHFDC impermissibly used the Section 3 appraisal 
process to determine the Property’s fair market value because 
the appraisal process applied only if the Chans “sell or 
transfer” the Property.   The Association asserted that Section 2 
of the SAE Agreement distinguished a “sale or transfer”  from 
foreclosures, and therefore a foreclosure could not trigger the 
appraisal process.11  The Association argued the circuit court 
                                                           
11  Section 2 of the SAE Agreement outlined three situations in which “[a] 
sale or transfer of the Property will be deemed to have taken place[:]”  
 
(a) When the Grantee sells or transfers the Property or any 
legal or beneficial right, title  or ownership interest 
in the Property, including by way of an agreement of 
sale or a lease with an option to purchase the Property;  
(b) When the Grantee no longer uses the Property as 
Grantee’s principal residence but continues to retain 
legal and/or equitable title to the Property; or  
(c) When the Grantee rents the Property or any part of the 
Property to someone else but continues to retain legal 
and/or equitable title to the Property.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
14 
 should have used the foreclosure sale price 
as the Property’s 
fair market value.    
The Association argued the circuit court erred in granting 
HHFDC’s 
motion for summary judgment because genuine issues of 
material fact existed regarding HHFDC’s calculation of the Net 
Appreciation, the Property’s fair market value, and HHFDC’s 
failure to comply with Section 3’s appraisal process.  The 
Association additionally argued the circuit court erred by 
denying its m otion for r econsideration because the Association 
did not have the opportunity to review the September Appraisal 
before the motion for summary judgment hearing. 
2.  HHFDC’s Arguments  
 
HHFDC also repeated its arguments below.  In addition, 
HHFDC asserted that the circuit court did not need to rely on 
HRS chapter 201H to determine the validity or priority of 
HHFDC’s lien, which was established by the deed and SAE 
Agreement.  
HHFDC argued the appraisal process applied 
because the SAE 
Agreement provided that HFDC would “immediately be entitled to a 
share of the Net Appreciation” if the Property w ere ever “sold 
or transferred . . . in any manner, voluntarily or 
involuntarily, including a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure 
sale.”  The agreement also provided that HFDC would select an ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
15 
 appraiser to determine the fair market value “[w]henever it 
shall become necessary to d
etermine the Net Appreciation  
. . . .”  Therefore, the app raisal process was triggered when 
HHFDC became entitled to its Net Appreciation share upon 
foreclosure because it was “necessary to determine the Net 
Appreciation” to calculate HHFDC’s share .  HHFDC also maintained 
that the Property’s fair market value was  $480,000 bas ed on the 
September Appraisal. 
HHFDC asserted the foreclosure sale was a “sale” entitling 
HHFDC to its Net Appreciation share because, under Section 2, if 
the Chans were “divested of title . . . in any manner, 
voluntarily or involuntarily, inc luding a judicial or 
nonjudicial foreclosure sale, HFDC [would] immediately be 
entitled to a share of the Net Appreciation.”  HHFDC also 
contended that, reading the SAE Agreement as a whole, Section 7 
only nullified the agreement as to the purchaser acquir
ing the 
Property as a result of a foreclosure.  Finally, HHFDC claimed 
the circuit court properly granted summary judgment because the 
issues of HHFDC’s Net Appreciation share, the Property’s fair 
market value, and HHFDC’s compliance with the appraisal pro cess 
were not material as to the validity and priority of HHFDC’s 
lien.

 3.  Memorandum Opinion 
 
On July 26, 2019, the ICA issued its memorandum opinion.  
American Savings Bank, F.S.B. v. Chan, Nos.  CAAP-15-0000309 & 
CAAP-15- 0000395 (App. July 26, 2019) (mem.).  In addressing the 
Association’s argument that the circuit court retroactive ly 
applied HRS chapter 201H in granting summary judgment, the ICA 
noted 
the circuit court’s reliance on HRS chapter 201H was 
unclear because the circuit court did not provide the basis for 
its ruling.  Chan, mem. op. at 8- 9.  The ICA determined that the 
“first in time, first in right” principle and the dates HFDC and 
the Association had filed and perfected their liens were “all 
the Circuit Court needed to rely on in determining lien 
priority.”  Chan, mem. op. at 9- 10.  Therefore, the ICA 
concluded the Association’s retroactivity argument was without 
merit.  Chan, mem. op. at 11. 
The ICA then considered the Association’s arg ument that the 
circuit court had disregarded the express language of Section 7 
of the SAE Agreement.  Id.   Reading the SAE Agreement  as a 
whole, the ICA determined that the Association’s interpretation 
that Section 7 extinguished HHFDC’s rights upon foreclosure of 
the first mortgage 
was “against the clear purpose and effect of 
Section 7” to protect the first mortgagee and  the parties that 
acquired the Property as a result of foreclosure.  Chan, mem. 
op. at 15.   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
17 
 Next, the ICA turned to the Association’s argument that the 
circuit court erred by not using the Property’s $370,000 sale 
price as its fair market value.  Chan, mem. op. at 16.  While 
the ICA recognized that courts may generally consider the 
foreclosure sale price in determining fair market value, the ICA 
did “not agree that Sections 1.E, 2, and 3 together require that 
the foreclosure sale price must be used in calculating Net 
Appreciation.”  
Chan, mem. op. at 17.  The ICA also concluded 
that, reading Sections 1.E, 2, and 3 together, the appraisal 
process applied to foreclosure sales.  Id.  
The ICA held, however, t hat HHFDC failed to comply with the 
Section 3 appraisal process because Appraiser Oshiro was not 
sufficiently qualified and HHFDC did not timely mail the 
September Appraisal to the Chans.  Chan, mem. op. at 17- 18.  The 
ICA concluded the circuit court “erred to the extent that it 
utilized the HHFDC’s appraised value of the Property without 
confirming the validity of the appraisal process or otherwise 
determining that the fair market value of the Property was 
$480,000 independent of the HHFDC appraisal.”  Chan, mem. op. at 
18-19.  The ICA vacated the circuit court’s determination of 
HHFDC’s Net Appreciation value and remanded for further 
proceedings.  Chan
, mem. op. at 19. 
Because the ICA vacated the circuit court’s findin gs 
related to the Property’s fair market value, the ICA did not ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
18 
 address the Association’s argument that the circuit court erred 
by considering new evidence and by not granting the 
Association’s Moti on for Reconsideration.  Id.   The ICA did not 
address whether HHFDC’s share was limited to the amount the 
Chans “realized” from the foreclosure sale. 
The ICA then addressed the Association’s argument that the 
circuit court erred in finding that HHFDC was  HFDC’s successor 
to the SAE Agreement.   Chan, mem. op . at 19- 20.  The ICA noted 
that Act 350 transferred HFDC’s rights to HCDCH and provided  
that all deeds entered into by HFDC would remain “in full force 
and effect.”  Chan, mem. op. at 21; 1997 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 
350, §20 at 1091.  Act 196 then split HCDCH into HHFDC and 
another entity, and provided  that HHFDC would “perform the 
functions of housing financing and development.”  Chan, mem. op. 
at 21; 2005 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 196, § 19 at 620.  The ICA held 
that the circuit court did not err because HHFDC had assumed 
HCDCH’s rights “including those arising out of the Deed and SAE 
Agreement,” and Act 196 and Act 350 “suggest[ed] that HHFDC is 
HFDC’s successor in interest.”  Chan, mem. op. at 21.   
Finally, the ICA addressed the Association’s argument that 
the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because 
genuine issues of material fact existed regarding the appraisal 
process and value of HHFDC’s lien .  Chan, mem. op. at 21- 22.  
The ICA noted that the circuit court only determined  HHFDC’s ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
19 
 lien priority on summary judgment.  Chan, mem. op. at 22.  The 
ICA then reasoned that the facts relating to the appraisal 
process and value of HHFDC’s lien were not material because they 
did not establish or refute HHFDC’s lien validity o r priority.  
Id.  Therefore, the circuit court did not err in granting 
HHFDC’s motion for summary judgment.  Id.  
The ICA affirmed the o rder granting HHFDC’s motion for 
summary judgment, order confirming sale, March 4, 2015 j udgment, 
and judgment on order granting HHFDC’s motion for summary 
judgment.  Chan, mem. op. at 22-23.  However, the ICA vacated 
the further order re: confirmation of s ale “to the extent that 
it relates to the value of HHFDC’s interest” and remanded for 
further proceedings.  Chan , mem. op. at 23. 
The ICA entered it s judgment  on appeal on August 20, 2019.   
D.  Application for Certiorari 
 
The Association’s Application present s three questions: 
[1.] Did the ICA commit grave errors of law and fact by 
failing to find that the Circuit Court erred in 
retroactively applying [HRS] Chapter 201H, including  
HRS §§ 201H -47(a)(6) and 201H- 47(e), when if found that 
HHFDC had a lien in foreclosure and that such lien was 
senior and superior to liens of all other parties except
for a first mortgage  lien?  
[2.] Did the ICA commit grave errors of law and fact when 
it ignored the plain language of [SAE Agreement], 
including, without limitation, Sections 2, 3, 4, and 7?  
. . . .  
[3.] Did the ICA commit grave errors of law and fact when 
it failed to hold  HHFDC to the same burden of proof that 
this Court has required of lenders in foreclosure actions 
and granted summary judgment to HHFDC when there were 
genuine issues of material fact regarding HHFDC’s standing 
and authority to enforce the SAE Agreement?  
 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
20 
  
First, the Association argues that HRS § 201H- 47(e) was not 
retroactive, that the law in effect when the deed was recorded 
in 1991 was HRS § 201E- 221(c), and that under HRS § 201E- 221(c), 
HFDC would only be entitled to the foreclosure proceeds 
remaining after payment of all liens and encumbrances, including 
the Association’s liens.  
Second, the Association argues the ICA ignored the express 
language of the SAE Agreement
 because: (1)  Section 7 voided the 
agreement upon the foreclosure of ASB’s mortgage; (2) the 
Section 3 appraisal process did not apply because no “sale or 
transfer” occurred as defined by Section 1.E; and (3) the 
agreement limited HHFDC’s entitlement “ to amounts the Chans 
received by converting the Property into cash ‘upon the sale or 
transfer of the Property.’” 
 Third, the Association argues HHFDC 
lacked standing to 
enforce the SAE Agreement as HFDC’s successor.  The Association 
also argues that the powers, functions, and duties transferred 
to HHFDC by Act 196 were under HRS chapter 201G, while the Chan 
deed was made under HRS chapter 201E.  It argues that, 
therefore, there was a genuine issue of material fact as to 
whether HHFDC was HFDC’s successor .

 III.  Standard s of Review 
 
A.  Contract Interpretation 
 
In Laeroc Waikiki Parkside, LLC v. K.S.K. (Oahu) Ltd. 
Partnership, 115 Hawai ʻi 201, 166 P.3d 961 (2007), the Hawaiʻi 
Supreme Court stated: 
When reviewing the court’ s interpretation of a contract, 
the construction and legal effect to be given a contract is 
a question of law freely reviewable by an appellate court.  
 
. . . . 
 
This court has determined that it is fundamental that terms 
of contract should be interpreted according to their plain, 
ordinary and accepted use in common speech, unless the 
contract indicates a different meaning.  Further, in  
construing a contract, a court’ s principal objective is to 
ascertain and effectuate the intention of the parties as 
manifested by the contract in its entirety.  If there is 
any doubt, the interpretation which most reasonably  
reflects the intent of the parties must be chosen.

citations, and brackets omitted).
 
B.  Statutory Interpretation 
 
The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
reviewable de novo.  
When construing a statute, our foremost 
obligation is to ascertain and give effect to 
the intention of the legislature, which is to 
be obtained primarily from the language 
contained in the statute itself.  And we must 
read statutory language in the context of the 
entire statute and construe it in a manner 
consistent with its purpose.

 IV. Discussion 
 
A.  The ICA did not err in finding HHFDC’s lien senior and 
superior to the A ssociation’s  
 
 The Association argues the ICA erred by failing to find the 
circuit court erred in retroactively applying HRS chapter 201H 
when it concluded HHFDC’s lien was senior and superior to the 
Association’s, and that HRS § 201E-221(c)
, the law in effect 
when the deed and SAE Agreement were entered, entitled  HHFDC 
only to the foreclosure proceeds remaining after payment of all 
liens and encumbrances.  
While the circuit court did not state the basis of its 
summary judgment ruling, HHFDC’s lien was senior and superior to 
the Association’s even under  HRS § 201E- 221.  HRS § 201E- 221(c) 
provided, in relevant part: “The corporation shall be a party to 
any foreclosure action, and shall be entitled to all proceeds 
remaining in excess of all customary and actual costs and 
expenses of transfer pursuant to default, including liens and 
encumbrances of record . . . . ”  HHFDC’s SAE interest was a 
“lien[] and encumbrance[] of record”  required to be paid upon 
foreclosure under HRS § 201E- 221(c), and because HHFDC’s lien 
was filed before the Association’s liens, HHFDC’s lien had 
priority under the “first in time, first in right” principle.  
See HRS § 501-82 (2006); HRS § 502-83 (2006) (establishing 
Hawaiʻi as a race
-notice jurisdiction).  Furthermore, the SAE ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
23 
 Agreement, which was entered into pursuant to HRS chapter 201E, 
provided that HFDC would become entitled to its Net Appreciation 
share upon foreclosure and only subordinated HFDC’s interest to 
the first mortgagee (ASB).  Therefore, the ICA did not err in 
affirming the circuit court’s determination of lien priority .  
See Strouss v. Simmons, 66 Haw. 32, 40, 657 P.2d 1004, 1010 
(1982) (“An appellate court may affirm a judgment of the lower 
court on any ground in the record which supports affirmance.”).  
B.  The ICA did not ignore the plain language of the SAE 
Agreement  
 
1.  The ICA d id not ignore the p lain language of Section 7  
 
 The Association argues the ICA ignored the plain language 
of Section 7 of the SAE Agreement because the last sentence of 
Section 7, “[t] his Exhibit C shall be null and void upon a 
conveyance of the Property through a foreclosure sale or a deed 
in lieu of foreclosure, ” meant that the foreclosure of ASB’s 
first mortgage voided the SAE Agreement.  
However, as the ICA reasoned, Section 7’s “purpose and 
effect” was to protect the first mortgagee and those who 
acquired the Property through foreclosure.  Chan , mem. op. at 
15.  Section 7 is titled “First Mortgage Protection,” and the 
first part of the section specifie d that the “foregoing 
provisions shall not app ly with respect to” the first purchase 
money mortgage, the first purchase  money mortgagee, the rights ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
24 
 of the first mortgagee to foreclose, and “[a]ny person or 
persons acquiring the Property as a result of foreclosure 
 
. . . .”  Thus, the ICA did not err in determining that Section 
7 did not nullify the SAE Agreement upon ASB’s foreclosure .   
2.   The Section 3 appraisal process applied  
 
The Association also maintains that the Section 3 appraisal 
process did not apply because, under  Section 1.E of the SAE 
Agreement, an appraisal of the Property’s “fair market value” is 
contingent upon a “sale or transfer ,” and a foreclosure sale is 
not a “sale or transfer”  as defined by Section 2.  
Section 2 of the SAE Agreement described three situations 
in which “[a] sale or transfer of the Property will be deemed to 
have taken place[:]”  
(a) When the Grantee sells or transfers the Property or any 
legal or beneficial right, title  or ownership interest 
in the Property, including by way of an agreement of 
sale or a lease with an option to purchase the Property;  
(b) When the Grantee no longer uses the Property as 
Grantee’s principal residence but continues to retain 
legal and/or equitable title to the Property; or  
(c) When the Grantee rents the Property or any part of the 
Property to someone else but continues to retain legal 
and/or equitable title to the Property.  
 
Section 2, however, did not limit a “sale or transfer” to these 
scenarios.  Neither did Section 1 , which defines the agreement’s 
terminology, define “sale or transfer.”  Therefore,  we interpret 
the words “sale or transfer” “according to their plain, ordinary 
and accepted use in common speech,” which would include a ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
25 
 foreclosure sale.  Laeroc Waikiki Parkside, LLC, 115 Hawai ʻi  at 
213, 166 P.3d at 973. 
Furthermore, Section 3 of the SAE Agreement provided, in 
relevant part, “[w]henever it shall become necessary to 
determine the Net Appreciation, HFDC will select an independent 
appraiser . . . who shall prepare a written appraisal of the 
Fair Market Value of the Property . . . .”  Under Section 2, 
HFDC would be entitled to its Net Appreciation share “when all 
or any part of or interest in the Property is sold or 
transferred . . . including a judicial or nonjudicial 
foreclosure sale . . . . ”  Because a  foreclosure sale would make 
it “necessary to determine the Net Appreciation,” the ICA did 
not err in holding that the Section 3 appraisal process applied . 
3.  HHFDC’s entitlement under the SAE Agreement is n ot 
limited to the a mount the Chans “ realized”  
 
 The Association argues HHFDC’s recovery under the SAE 
Agreement was “limited to the funds remaining after payment of 
all liens and encumbrances. ”  Although the ICA did not address 
this argument in its memorandum opinion, the Association’s 
argument is without merit.  The Association essentially argues 
that the parties to the SAE Agreement intended to make HFDC’s 
lien junior and subordinate to all other liens.  This 
interpretation of the 
agreement does not reasonably reflect the 
intent of the parties.  See Laeroc Waikiki Parkside, LLC, 115 ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
26 
 Hawaiʻi at 213, 166 P.3d at 973.   Section 7 of the SAE Agreement 
specifically subordinated  HFDC’s lien to the first mortgagee’s 
lien.  If, as the Association argues, HHFDC’s recovery were 
“limited to the funds remaining after payment of all liens and 
encumbrances,” Section 7 would not need to exist.  Therefore, 
considering the likely intent of the parties and the SAE 
Agreement as a whole, the Association’s argument is without 
merit.  
C.  The ICA did not err in finding HHFDC had s tanding to 
enforce the SAE Agreement 
 
 The Association argues there were “ genuine issues of 
material fact as to whether [HHFDC] was the successor to HFDC 
and whether it assumed the rights of HFDC under the SAE 
Agreement.” 
 While the Association argu es that HHFDC’s standing is a 
genuine issue of material fact, it is actually a question of 
law; HHFDC asserts that it assumed HFDC’s rights to the SAE 
Agreement by statute.  Therefore, we review the ICA’s 
determination that HHFDC is HHFDC’s successor in interest to the 
SAE Agreement pursuant to Act 196 and Act 350 de novo.  Chan , 
mem. op. at 21; see Ka Paʻ akai O Kaʻaina, 94 Hawaii̒ at 41, 7 P.3d 
at 1078 (“The interpretation of a statute is a ques tion of law 
reviewable de novo.”).   ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
27 
  
HHFDC is HFDC ’s successor  according to the language of Act 
350 and Act 196.  Act 350 of 1997 created HFDCH, stating that 
HFDCH “shall succeed to all of the rights and powers previously 
executed” by HFDC, and that “[a] ll deeds, leases, contracts  
. . . or other documents executed or entered into by or on 
behalf of [HFDC] . . . shall remain in full force and effect.”  
§ 20 at 1091.  Act 350 also repealed HRS chapter 201E, which was 
replaced with HRS chapter 201G. 
 § 18 at 1090 ; HRS chapter 201G 
(Supp. 1997).  According to the “Table of Derivation” in the HRS 
2005 Supplement, HRS § 201E- 221, which governed the SAE Program, 
was replaced by HRS § 201G- 127.   
 
Act 196 of 2005 split HFDCH into the Hawai
i̒ Public Housing 
Administration and HHFDC.  § 19 at 620.  Act 196 transferred 
HFDCH’s functions relating to financing and state housing 
programs under HRS chapter 201G part II subpart F and HRS 
chapter 201G part III 
except subparts D and M to HHFDC.  § 21 at 
630-31.  In the HRS 2005 Supplement, HRS § 201G-127 was under 
part II subpart F of HRS chapter 201G
 — one of the subparts 
transferred to HHFDC.  Act 196  also transferred all records and 
contracts “made, used, acquired, or held by [HFDCH] relating to 
the functions transferred to [HHFDC].”  § 23  at 631.  The act 
provided that “[a]ll deeds, leases, contracts  . . . or other 
documents executed or entered into by or on behalf of  [HFDCH] . 
. . which are made applicable to [HHFDC] by this Act, shall ***  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND THE PACIFIC REPORTER  ***  
 
28 /s/ Mark E. Recktenwald  
/s/ Paula A. Nakayama 
/s/ Sabrina S. McKenna   
/s/ Richard W. Pollack 
/s/ Michael D. Wilson 
 remain in full force and effect.”  § 25  at 632.  Finally, the 
act amended references to HCDCH to refer to HHFDC.  § 26 at 632. 
 Reading Act 350 and Act 196 together, t he legislature 
intended for HHFDC to succeed HFDCH and HFDC’s SAE Program 
interests.  See Ka Pa ʻakai O Ka ʻaina, 94 Hawaii̒ at 41, 7 P.3d at 
1078 (“When construing a statute, our foremost obligation is to 
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, 
which is to be obtained primarily from the language contained in 
the statute itself.”).  Because Act 196 transf erred HFDCH’s 
functions under HRS § 201G-127, which governed the SAE Program 
in 2005, to HHFDC, the SAE Agreement was “made applicable” to 
HHFDC by Act 196 and remained “in full force and effect .”  
Therefore, HHFDC is HFDC’s successor to the SAE Agreement,  and 
the ICA did not err in affirming the circuit court’s grant of 
HHFDC’s motion for summary judgment.  
V. Conclusion 
 
We therefore affirm the ICA’s August 20, 2019 judgment on 
appeal.
