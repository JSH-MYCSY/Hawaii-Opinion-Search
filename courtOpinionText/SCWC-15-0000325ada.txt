OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J.   
  In this case, the Petitioner filed a complaint in the 
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (circuit court) alleging that 
the Respondent’s cattle t respassed onto his property causing 
damage to his sweet potato crop.  In granting the Respondent’s 
motion for summary judgment, the circuit court concluded that Electronically Filed

 the Petitioner’s land was neither “properly fenced” nor 
“unfenced,” and therefore Hawaii’s statutory law governing the 
trespass of livestock onto cultivated land did not apply to the 
Petitioner’s property
.  Further, the circuit court determined 
that a provision in the Petitioner’s lease, making the 
Petitioner fully responsible for keeping cattle out of his 
cultivated land, was not void against public policy.  The 
Intermediate Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court ’s 
judgment. 
  
Upon review of the legislative history of the statutes  
that govern the trespass of livestock onto the cultivated la nd 
of another, we conclude that the legislature intended to hold 
owners of livestock liable for the damage caused by the trespass 
of their animals on cultivated land whether the land is properly 
fenced or not.  Further, we determine that the  lease provision 
in this case has the effect of absolving the Respondent of 
liability for livestock damage to Petitioner ’s cultivated land  
and therefore is contrary to statutory law and public policy,  
and it is thus invalid.  
I. BACKGROUND  
  On August 10, 2009, Paradise Homes, LLC, entered into 
an eighteen-month lease (“ lease”) in which it agreed to lease 
fifty acres of land to Jijun Yin for agricultural purposes in 
the Pauka ‘a area of the District of Hilo, Hawaii.  Under the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
3 
 “Rent” subsection of the lease was a provision  that stated, 
“Licensee is fully responsible  [for] keeping cattle [] out of 
[their] crops.”  Additionally, one page of the l ease was an 
unsigned and undated page that stated,  “Remove all cattle [] 
across from my farmland.  Do [n] ot raise cattle [] across from my 
[f]armland.”  In February 2010 , another lease between Paradise 
Homes and Yin was executed, and the provision,  stating “Licensee 
is fully responsible [for] keeping cattle[]  out of [their] 
crops,” was included in the 201 0 lease. 
  
On August 29, 2011, Yin filed a complaint 
(“complaint”) against Virginio Aguiar, Jr.,1 Kevin Aguiar, and 
Agee, Inc. (collectively “ the Aguiars ”), who owned and pastured 
cattle near Yin’s leased property.  The complaint alleged that 
in September 2009, Kevin Aguiar “released and/or caused”  cattle 
owned by the Aguiars to trespass onto Yin’s leased property that 
resulted in the cattle eating some of Yin’s sweet potato crop.2  
Following this incident, the complaint contended,  a meeting was 
held between Yin and  Kevin Aguiar and Paradise Homes’ managing 
agent, Teresa Prekaski,3 and an agreement was reached that the 
                     
 1 Virginio died during the pendency of the suit.  
 2 The complaint stated that Virginio was the President and Director 
of Agee, Inc., and Kevin Aguiar was an employee.  
 
3 Paradise Homes, LLC was also the owner of the property leased by 
the Aguiars. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
4 
 Aguiars would prevent their  cattle from trespassing onto the 
property possessed and farmed by Yin. 
  In March 2011, the c omplaint stated, Kevin Aguiar 
released more than 50 cattle in close proximity to  Yin’s 
property, resulting in the cattle trespassing onto Yin’s 
property and destroying over 13 acres of Yin’s sweet potato 
crop.  After Yin removed the cattle from  his property , the 
complaint alleged, Yin noticed that Kevin Aguiar had left open 
his gate and allowed his cattle to again trespass onto Yin’s 
property.  The complaint contended that the trespassing cattle 
caused more than $190,000 worth of damage,  including the “loss 
of [Yin’s] over 13 acres of s weet potato crop and damage to his 
fencing.” 
  T he complaint asserted that the Aguiars were strictly 
liable to Yin for the damage to his crops caused by the trespass 
of their cattle in accordance with statutory law.  Yin also 
claimed that Kevin Aguiar knew  or should have known that 
allowing the cattle outside of the fenced and gated area where 
he pastured the cattle would likely result in the cattle 
trespassing onto Yin’s property  and that his crops were 
destroyed as a direct and proximate result of the Agu iars’ ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
5 
 “willful, wanton, deliberate, intentional and/or negligent 
conduct.”4 
  The Aguiars ’ answer to the complaint admitted that a 
meeting occurred in September 2009 between Kevin Aguiar, Yin, 
and Prekaski after an incident on Yin’s leased property , but the 
answer denied the essential allegations of the complaint.  
Additionally, the Aguiars raised numerous defenses,  including 
failure to state a claim, comparative negligence, assumption of 
the risk, lack of notice, failure of Yin to mitigate damages, 
statute of limitations, laches, estoppel, waiver, and unclean 
hands.  The Aguiars alleged that they exercised reasonable care 
at all times, and that their conduct was not a proximate cause 
of Yin’s alleged damages .5  Thus, the Aguiar s requested that the 
complaint be dismissed with prejudice. 
  After discovery
 was conducted, the Aguiars filed a 
motion for summary judgment as to all c laims.  In a memorandum 
accompanying the motion, the Aguiars argued that they were 
entitled to summary judgment because, as a matter of law, they 
did not owe a duty to construct a cattle fence that prevented 
the cattle from entering Yin’ s land.  Instead, the Aguiars 
                     
 4 Additionally, the complaint alleged that the Aguiars were liable 
for Yin’s severe emotional distress and that Yin was entitled to punitive 
damages. 
 5 The Aguiars also denied that they engaged in intentional, 
outrageous, or aggravated conduct that warranted the assessment of punitive 
damages. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
6 (continued . . .)  
 contended, Yin was solely responsible for constructing a cattle 
fence because he assumed the duty when he leased the land; the 
Aguiars noted that Yin’s lease specifically provided that “he 
‘is fully responsible [ for] keeping cattle[] out of [their] 
crops.’”     
  The Aguiars also asserted that 
Hawaii Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 142-63 did not prevent the entry of summary judgment in 
their favor 
because the statute did not apply to Yin’s claims as 
“it is only applicable to claims involving trespass on ‘properly 
fenced cultivated ground[ .]’”6  Yin’s property was not “properly 
fenced,” the Aguiars contended, because “the fence was poorly 
constructed and did not prevent cattle from entering his land.”   
Specifically, the Aguiars stated that Yin’s fence was only two 
and one half to three feet tall and used hog wir e instead of 
barbed wire.  Because the fence was under four feet tall and 
used loosely-wound hog wire, it did not satisfy the definition 
of a “lawful fence” under HRS § 142-61, the Aguiars argued.7  Nor 
                     
 6 HRS § 142-63 (1993) provides the following:  
If any cattle, horse, mule, ass, swine, sheep, or goat, 
trespasses on any properly fenced cultivated ground, the 
owner thereof shall pay upon proof, the full amount of the 
damage or loss to the landowners, or to any person in 
possession of the land, whoever suffers the damage or loss.  
 7 HRS § 142-61 (1993) provides, in relevant part, the following:  
(a) Every fence made of stone, posts and rails, posts and 
boards, posts and wire, or other suitable materials shall 
be a lawful fence, provided that it is not less than four ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
7 
 did HRS § 141- 64 apply, contended the Aguiars, because the 
statute only applies  to trespass claims on unfenced cultivated 
ground, and Yin’s property was not unfenced.8  Thus, because they 
were not liable for Yin’s alleged damages, the Aguiars 
concluded, they were entitled to summary judgment. 
  
In his memorandum in opposition, Yin argued that the 
lease between himself and Prekaski was unenforceable because it 
was “contrary to the public good.”   Yin contended that Hawai i 
law supports the principle that courts should not enforce 
contracts contrary to public policy.  (Citing Inlandboatmen’s 
Union v. Sause Bros., Inc. , 77 Hawai i 187, 196, 881 P.2d 1255, 
1264 (App. 1994).)  Yin argued that his lease violated an 
explicit public policy established by HRS 
§§ 142-63 and 142- 64 
that shifts the liability of livestock damage from the property 
                                                                              
(. . . continued) 
 
feet in height, substantially built, strong and close, 
existing in good state of repair, and capable of turning 
either all stock or all stock excepting swine, attempting 
to pass through the fence.  
(b) Woven wire, or what is otherwise known also as hog -
wire, used as a type of wire by itself or with a 
combination of barbed wire or plain wire, when supported on 
posts and properly fastened thereto and meeting the minimum 
height and stock turning requirements prescribed in 
subsection (a), shall be a lawful fence.  
 8 HRS § 142-64 (1993) provides that “[i]f any of the animals 
mentioned in section 142 -63 trespasses on any unfenced cultivated ground, the 
owner thereof shall pay upon proof, the full amount of the damage or loss to 
the landowner or to any person in possession of the land, whoever suffers the 
damage or loss.” ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 owner to the livestock owner.  Thus, cattle owners hold the 
burden to prevent their cattle from doing damage to adjacent 
farmland and are liable for the damage caused by their cattle, 
Yin concluded.   
  In reply, 
the Aguiars m aintained that they were 
entitled to summary judgment because Yin did not raise any 
genuine dispute of material fact and his  argument that his lease 
violated public policy wa s unsupported by the facts.  
Specifically, the Aguiars contended that neither the statutes 
nor public policy prevented Prekaski from requiring Yin to build 
a fence to protect his property because HRS §§ 142-63 and 142- 64 
do not prohibit landlords from requiring their tenants to 
construct fencing as part of lease agreements. 
  The circuit court granted the Aguiars’ motion  and 
concluded that they met their burden of producing evidence that 
HRS §§ 142- 63 and 142- 64 did not apply because Yin’s property 
was not “properly fenced” so as to prevent cattle from enterin g.9  
And HRS § 142 -64 did not apply, the court stated, because the 
land was not “unfenced.”   Further, the court concluded that the 
lease provision at issue was not void against public policy 
under the standards described in Inlandboatmen ’s Union  because 
the provision only shifts the duty to fence from the rancher to

 the farmer by a contract on lands leased to them by a common 
lessor.10   
The court’s order granting summary judgment as to all 
claims was filed on March 27, 2015, and its order granting in 
part and denying part the Aguiars’ motion for fees and costs was 
granted on June 9, 2015.   The court issued its judgment on 
July 1, 2015, incorporating the rulings  on these orders.  Yin  
filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.  
II. ICA PROCEEDINGS 
  On appeal, Yin argued that the circuit court erred in 
granting summary judgment in favor of the Aguiars based on the 
court’s erroneous interpretation of HRS §§ 142 -63 and 142- 64 and 
its conclusion that he had a contractual obligation to protect 
his crops from damage by trespassing cattle that precluded any 
liability on the part of the Aguiars.  Yin contended that HRS 
§§ 142-63 and 142-64 taken together, impose liability for 
livestock damage to cultivated land, whether the land is legally 
fenced or not.  This is bolstered by the statutes’ legislative 
history, Yin explained, as the statutes were amended to their 
                     
 10 The circuit court also concluded that  the Aguiars satisfied their 
burden to produce evidence that they are third -party beneficiaries of the 
provision of Yin’s lease that provides that Yin “is fully responsible [for] 
keeping cattle[] out of [their] crops” because the Aguiars produced evidence 
that they “bargained with Ms. Prekaski for the  . . . provision. ”  
Additionally, the court found that the Aguiars met their burden of producing 
evidence that it was reasonable for them to rely upon Yin’s lease in 
continuing to maintain cattle on Ms. Prekask i’s land and that they had the 
power to impose the duty set forth in the lease provision at issue upon Yin.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 present forms in 1975 with the intent to simplify determination 
of damages in animal trespass cases.  Rather than combining the 
two statutes, the 1975 amendment was grafted onto the pre-
existing statutes that divided liability according to whether or 
not the land was fenced, Yin argued.  As to the lease, Yin 
argued that evidence of the contract between Prekaski and Yin 
was not sufficient to summarily render the statutes’ public 
policy inapplicable to this case.   
The Aguiars responded that they were not liable for 
any damage to Yin’s crops because Yin bore the duty to build a 
fence by the inclusion of a provision in his lease making him 
responsible for damage caused by cattle to his crops.  
Additionally, the Aguiars argued that HRS §§  142-63 and 142- 64 
did not prevent the enforcement of the l ease or relieve Yin of 
his duty under the l ease because the statutes were irrelevant as 
they did not provide that cattle owners must construct fencing 
on properties where cattle are kept.  And regarding the l ease 
itself, the Aguiars contended that Yin failed to identify a 
specific policy or statute that prevented the l ease from 
requiring him to construct fencing and failed to explain why his 
lease is different from other contracts through which a party 
assumes duties as part of the contract.  Nor did HRS §§ 142-63 
and 142-64 apply because they do not address liability when a ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
11 
 fence is neither properly fenced nor unfenced, the Aguiars 
argued.11   
  In its summary disposition order, the Intermediate 
Court of Appeals (ICA) first stated that Yin’s opening brief 
made new arguments concerning the interpretation, legislative 
intent, and legislative history of HRS §§ 142-61, 142-63, and 
142-64 that had not been made before the circuit court.12  The 
ICA explained that it would not address such arguments, and it 
would only consider the plain meaning and application of the 
statutes.  The ICA found that the plain and unambiguous meaning 
of those statutes demonstrated that neither HRS §  142-63 nor HRS 
§ 142-64 applied because Yin’s property was neither unfenced nor 
properly fenced.  And because Yin affirmatively accepted the 
duty to keep the cows off his property, the ICA concluded, the 
Aguiars were not liable for the damage caused by their cattle.13 
                     
 11 Yin also challenged the circuit court’s order granting in part 
and denying in part the Aguiars’ motion for fees and costs, arguing inter 
alia that Yin’s success on appeal would obviate the prevailing party basis 
for the award under Hawai i Arbitration Rules (HAR) Rule 25.   
 12 The ICA’s summary disposition order can be found at Yin v. 
Aguiar, No. CAAP- 15-0000325, 2019 WL 948460 (App. Feb. 27, 2019).     
 13 The ICA also concluded that the Aguiars met their burden of 
producing evidence that the purpose of the lease provision was to benefit 
them in that Yin had the duty to fence his property to prevent cattle from 
entering,  it was reasonable for the Aguiars to rely on the lease provision in 
continuing to maintain cattle on the land, and the Aguiars met their burden 
of producing evidence that they were intended beneficiaries of the lease.  
The ICA did not expressly rule on Yin’s argument that the lease violated a 
public policy established by HRS §§ 142-63 and 142 -64.  The ICA affirmed the 
circuit court’s award of fees and costs.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 III. STANDARD S OF REVIEW  
A. Summary Judgment  
  We review a circuit court’s grant or denial of summary 
judgment de novo.  
Querubin v. Thronas, 107 Hawai i 48, 56, 109 
P.3d 689, 697 (2005) (citing Hawaii Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. 
Keka, 94 Hawai i 213, 221, 11 P.3d 1, 9 (2000) ). 
B. Statutory Interpretation 
  “The interpretation of a statute is a question of law 
reviewable de novo.”  Peer News LLC v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 
138 Hawai i 53, 60, 376 P.3d 1, 8  (2016). 
IV. DISCUSSION 
A. Livestock  Owners Are Liable f or Damages Caused b y Their 
Livestock Trespassing ont o Cultivated Land.   
  I n its decision, the ICA  only considered “the plain 
meaning and application of HRS §§  142-61, 142-63, and 142- 64,” 
and it did not examine the legislative history of HRS §§ 1 42-63 
or 142-64 because it concluded that the statutes were 
unambiguous and Yin failed to raise such arguments before the 
circuit court.   
 
 HRS §§ 142-63 and 142 -64 provide as follows: 
§142-63 Trespass on fenced cultivated land.  If any cattle, 
horse, mule, ass, swine, sheep, or goat, trespasses on any  
properly fenced  cultivated ground, the owner thereof shall 
pay upon proof, the full amount of the damage or loss to 
the landowners, or to any person in possession of the land, 
whoever suffers the damage or loss.  
 
§142-64 On unfenced cultivated land.  If any of the animals 
mentioned in section 142 -63 trespasses on any unfenced ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
13 
 cultivated ground, the owner thereof shall pay upon proof, 
the full amount of the damage or loss to the landowner or 
to any person in possession of the land, whoever suffers 
the damage or loss.   
  Yin maintains that the ICA erred because its 
interpretation of HRS §§  142-63 and 142- 64 created an 
unreasonable loophole in the statutes by holding that his  land 
was neither “unfenced” nor “properly fenced.”  Yin asserts that 
the statutes impose liability on owners of livestock for all 
damages caused to crops when the livestock trespasses on another 
person’s land.   
  We first consider whether the ICA erred in concluding 
that the statutes were unambiguous and then review whether the 
ICA erred in determining that neither HRS §§  142-63 nor 14 2-64 
were applicable in this case.  
1. There Exists Ambiguity as to a Livestock Owner’s Liability 
When a Fence Does Not Satisfy the Qualifications of a “Lawful 
Fence.” 
 
 It is well established that “implicit in the task of 
statutory construction is [an appellate court ’s] foremost 
obligation to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature.”  Louie v. Hawaii Gov’t Emps. Ass’n , 133 Hawai i 
385, 400, 328 P.3d 394, 409 (2014) (quoting State v. Wheeler, 
121 Hawai i 383, 390, 219 P.3d 1170, 1177 (2009)) .  “When there 
is doubt . . . or uncertainty of an expression used in a 
statute, an ambiguity exists. ”  Farmer v. Admin. Dir., 94 Hawaii ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
14 
 232, 236, 11 P.3d 457, 461 (2000) (quoting Konno v. Cty. of 
Hawaii, 85 Hawaii 61, 71, 937 P.2d 397, 407 (1997)) ; see also  
State v. DeMello, 136 Hawai i 193, 206, 361 P.3d 420, 433 (2015) 
(Pollack, J., dissenting) (“Assigning the statute’s ambiguous 
language a ‘plain meaning’ without reference to the legislative 
history . .  . would not only be an abuse of the plain meaning 
doctrine, but it would also be contrary to this court’s duty to 
‘ascertain and give effect to the intention of the 
legislature.’” (quoting State v. McKnight, 131 Hawaii 379, 388, 
319 P.3d 298, 307 (2013))) .   
  Under the Hawaii Revised Statutes, the owner of  “any 
cattle” that “trespasses on any properly fenced cultivated 
ground, . . . shall pay upon proof, the full amount of the 
damage or loss to the landowners. ”  HRS § 142-63 (emphasis 
added).14  Although HRS Chapter 142 does not provide a definition 
for “properly fenced,” it defines “lawful fence” as a “ fence 
made of stone, posts and rails, posts and boards, posts and 
wire, or other suitable materials . . . provided that it is not 
less than four feet in height, substantially built, strong and 
close, existing in good state of repair, and capable of turning 
either all stock or all stock excepting swine, attempting to 
                     
 14 HRS §§ 142-63 and 142- 64 apply to “any cattle, horse, mule, ass, 
swine, sheep, or goat.”  For readability, this opinion re fers to these 
animals collectively as “cattle” or “livestock.”  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
15 
 pass through the fence. ”15  HRS § 142-61(a).  If the fence is 
made of “[w]oven wire,” otherwise known as “hog -wire,” then it 
must be “supported on posts and properly fastened thereto and 
meet[] the minimum height and stock turning requirements 
prescribed in subsection (a)” in order to constitute a “lawful 
fence.”  HRS § 142-61(b).   
  Th e Hawai i Revised Statutes unequivocally  impose 
liability on the owners of livestock in situations when their 
animals damage a crop owner’s “properly fenced” cultivated  land.  
To constitute “properly fenced,” the fence must be (1) at least 
four feet in height, (2) “substantially built,” ( 3) “strong and 
close,” (4) “existing in [a] good state,” and ( 5) “capable of 
turning [away] all stock . . . attempting to pass through the 
fence.”  HRS § 142-61.  A failure by the crop owner to satisfy 
any of these requirem
ents would result in a determination that 
the property was not “properly fenced.”  But proving all four of 
these elements results in circular reasoning because a property 
that is otherwise “properly fenced” would not allow livestock to 
gain entry as the definition requires that the fence be capable 
of “turning [away] all stock.”  That is, the trespass itself 
would arguably relieve the livestock owner from liability 
                     
 15 Based on our discussion of the legislative history of the 
livestock statutes, see infra, we deduce that “lawful fence” is intended to 
be used to define “properly fenced.”  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
16 
 because a “proper[] fence[]” would have been able to turn away 
the animal.16   
  Thus, while HRS §  142-63 clearly holds livestock 
owners liable when “any cattle . . . trespass[] on any properly 
fenced cultivated ground,” HRS § 142-61 seemingly renders this 
provision a virtual nullity absent intentional damage to an 
otherwise “proper[] fence[].”   This incongruity creates 
ambiguity in the application of the plain text of these statutes 
and specifically as to a livestock owner’s liability when a 
fence does not satisfy the qualifications of a “lawful fence” 
under HRS § 142-61 because, under the interpretation given by 
the circuit court, such a fence would also render liability 
under HRS § 142 -64 inapplicable .  The ICA therefore erred in 
concluding that the statutes were unambiguous.17  
                     
 16 Indeed, the Aguiars argued in their Answering Brief that, inter 
alia, “[t]he inadequacy of [Yin]’s fence is established by evidence that 
cattle walked through or over [his] fence.”  
 
 17 To the extent that the ICA did not consider the legislative 
history or intent of the statutes because Yin did not raise the issues before 
the trial court, we have previously held that appellate courts may “resolve[] 
a properly preserved issue by answering a threshold or dispositive question 
of law, even though the argument is not advance d by the parties.”  Cox v. 
Cox, 138 Hawai i 476, 488, 382 P.3d 288, 300 (2016) (citing Waldecker v. 
O’Scanlon, 137 Hawai i 460, [466 -67], 375 P.3d 239, 245 –46 (2016); Akamine & 
Sons, Ltd. v. Hawaii Nat’l Bank , 54 Haw. 107, 114 –15, 503 P.2d 424, 429 
(1972)).  Because Yin properly preserved the argument that HRS §§  142-63 and 
142-64 provide that livestock owners are liable for the damages caused by the 
trespass of their animals, the ICA had the duty to give effect to the 
intention of the legislature in  applying these statutes.

 2. The Legislature Intended T o Impose Liability on Livestock 
Owners for All Proven Damages to Cultivated Land.  
  When we interpret ambiguous statutes, “[t]he meaning 
of the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context[] 
with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences” were

ey, 99 Hawai i 463, 464, 56 P.3d 1252, 
1253 (2002) (first alteration in original).  We may also “resort 
to extrinsic aids in determining legislative intent” such as 
legislative history.  Id.  at 464-65, 56 P.3d at 1253- 54. 
  This case involves the interpretation of HRS §§ 142- 63 
and 142-64, which were last amended in 1975.  Specifically, we 
are required to determine the meanings of the terms “properly 
fenced” and “unfenced” as used in these provisions .  The terms 
first appeared in the statutes addressing the trespassing of 
livestock (“livestock statutes ”) in 1888, but the livestock 
statutes had protected trespass onto cultivated land as early as 
1841.  We therefore begin our review of the legislative history 
of HRS §§ 142-63 and 142-64 by considering the evolution of the 
early laws regarding livestock trespass and the amendments made 
in 1888 and 1975.  
 Early Laws Regarding Livestock Trespass a.
  The first statute regarding trespassing livestock was 
enacted in 1841 as part of the Laws of the Hawaiian Kingdom 
(“1841 Act” ).  Translation of the Constitution and Laws of the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
18 
 Hawaiian Islands, Established in the Reign of Kamehameha III, 
Ch. XIV, at 58 (1842) [hereinafter Laws of 1842].  When the 1841 
Act was enacted, King Kamehameha III explained that “ there [was] 
at the present time a considerable number of people who [were] 
greatly annoyed by having their cattle held in confinement 
without cause” and  that “farmers [were] greatly annoyed, by 
having their ve getables destroyed ” by unconfined cattle.  Id.  
To resolve this problem, King Kamehameha III made it “illegal 
for beasts to [roam] at large, unless the cultivated grounds 
[were] enclosed by a fence.”  Id.  If the “cultivated ground” 
was surrounded by a fence, then animals were allowed to roam, 
but “if any animal [was] really mischievous and br[oke] away the 
fence or jump[ed]  over it, then the owner of the animal [was 
required to] pay according to the amount of food destroyed and 
the loss sustained.”  Id.  The 1841 Act distinguished  that 
situation from one in which a fence “bec[a]me rotten” or “f[e]ll 
down” and exposed the cultivated land.  Id.  In such cases, the 
owner of “the animal not being [at] fault and not being of a 
mischievous character shall pay no fine. ”  Id.  However, “if it 
was generally known that the fence was poor and out of repair, 
and on that account most of the people confined their animals,” 
the animal owner was liable for “all damages done by his 
animals.”  Id.  at 58-59.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
19 
   In 1846, “in consideration of the numerous petitions 
presented” to “[t]h e Nobles and Representatives of the Hawaiian 
Islands,” a law entitled “Joint Resolutions Respecting Estrays” 
was enacted (“ 1846 Act ”), increasing statutory protection to the 
owners of cultivated land.  2 Statute Laws of His Majesty 
Kamehameha III, at 72 (1847) [ hereinafter 1847  Stat. Laws].  
Under the 1846 Act, “if any kine, [18] horse, mare, mule or ass 
commit[ed] any trespass on any cultivated ground,” the livestock 
owner was liable to the cultivated landowner for “the sum of 
five dollars for the trespass of each animal” and “the full 
amount of” the damage to the production of land.  Id. § 1, at 
72.  The 1846  Act also included a provision that made livestock 
owners liable for the trespass of their animals onto 
uncultivated land.19  Id. § 2, at 72.  The 1846 Act thus 
increased statutory protection to landowners by making the 
livestock owner liable for trespass onto cultivated and 
uncultivated land regardless of the existence or condition of a 
fence.  See id.    
                     
 18 “Kine” is an archaic plural of “cow.”  Kine, Webster’s Unabridged 
Dictionary (2d. ed. 2001).  
 
 19 Section 2 of the 1846 Act provided as follows:  
 
That if any animal or animals of any person commit any 
trespass on any uncultivated ground, the owner of the 
animal or animals shall forfeit and pay to the owner of the 
ground, four times the amount of damage done, or of value 
destroyed.   
 
1847 Stat. Laws § 2, at 72.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
20 
   A decade later, a new law “Relating to Estrays and 
Pounds” was passed (“ 1856 Act ”).  Laws of His Majesty Kamehameha 
IV, 1856 Sess. Laws, at 49 [hereinafter 1856 Sess. Laws].  
Section 5 of the 1856 Act provided that if any livestock “commit 
a tres[]pass on any cultivated ground, the owner of said animal 
or animals shall forfeit and pay to the owner of the ground the 
sum of fifty cents for the trespass of each animal” plus “full 
amount” of any damage to the “production s of the land.”20  Id. § 
5, at 50.  Like the previous iteration of the law, the 1856 Act 
required an owner of livestock to pay a set amount per head for 
the trespass of the owner’s animals onto “any uncultivated 
ground.”21  Id. § 6, at 50.  In addition, the 1856 Act contained 
                     
 20 Section 5 of the 1856 Act provided in part as follows:  
 
If any horse, mule, ass, hog, or neat cattle, commit a 
tres[]pass on any cultivated ground, the owner of said 
animal or animals shall forfeit and pay to the owner of the 
ground the sum of fifty cents for the trespass of each 
animal, excepting sheep and goats, which shall be six 
cents; and if any productions of the  land be destroyed or 
other damage done by the animal or animals, the owner 
thereof shall further pay to the loser the full amount of 
such damage or loss[.]  
 
1856 Sess. Laws § 5, at 50.   
 
 21 Section 6 of the 1856 Act provided in part as follows:  
 
If any of the animals enumerated in the last preceeding 
section commit a trespass on any uncultivated ground, the 
owner of such animal or animals shall forfeit and pay to 
the owner of the ground twelve and a half cents for the 
trespass of each animal, excepting sheep and goats, for 
which he shall pay six cents per head, and if any damage be 
done by the animal or animals, the owner thereof shall pay 
to the loser the full amount of such damage[.]  
 
1856 Sess. Laws § 6, at 50.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
21 
 a provision that increased the penalties listed in sections 5 
and 6 when the trespass occurred onto “land enclosed by a lawful 
fence”: 
The owner of any horse, mule, ass, neat cattle, swine, 
sheep or goat trespassing upon land enclosed by a lawful 
fence, shall forfeit and pay to  the owner of such land, if 
cultivated, twice the penalty prescribed in section fifth; 
and if the land is uncultivated, . . . twice the penalty 
prescribed in section sixth, and shall also in each case 
pay the full amount of damage done by such animal or 
animals.   
 
Id. § 8, at 51 (emphases added).  
  The 1856 Act also provided the criteria a barrier 
needed to meet to qualify for additional penalties as a “lawful 
fence” under section 9 of the 1856 Act.22  Id. § 9, at 51.  
Accordingly, trespass onto any cultivated or uncultivated land 
that was enclosed with anything less than a lawful fence would 
be compensable only under sections 5 or 6.  In addition, the 
1856 Act increased protections to landowners by broadening the 
category of animals for which a livestock owner was liable
 to 
include “hog,” “swine,” “sheep” and “goats .”  See id. §§ 5, 6, 
                     
 22 The 1856 defined a “lawful fence” a s follows: 
 
Every enclosure shall be deemed a lawful fence which is 
four feet high, if made of stone, and if made of wood, iron 
wire, or an artificial pali, five feet high; if made upon 
an embankment of a ditch three feet deep, or upon an 
artificial or natural pali three feet high, then the fence 
must be two feet high said fence to be substantial, 
reasonably strong and close, made to turn stock.  If the 
fence be a ditch only, then it shall be nine feet wide at 
the top and four feet deep, and if a hedge, five feet high, 
thigh and high to turn stock.   
 
1856 Sess. Laws § 9, at 51.   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
22 
 8, at 50-51.  The 1856 Act thus created a liability scheme that 
held a livestock owner liable for the trespass of the owner’s 
animals onto any land, cultivated or uncultivated, and the 
existence of a lawful fence only determined the additional 
damages that would be awarded.   
  In 1859, these provisions were compiled and codified 
into 
Hawaii’s first civil code (“1859 Civil Code ”) as sections 
239, 240, 242, and 243.  See The Civil Code of the Hawaiian 
Islands §§ 239, 240, 242, 243, at 54- 55 (1859)  [hereinafter 1859 
Civ. Code].  The provisions in the 1859 Civil Code were largely 
the same as the 1856 Act, with the exception o
f section 243, 
which amended the definition of a “lawful fence.”23  See 1859 
Civ. Code § 243, at 54.   These provisions were also compiled 
into the civil code in 1884 and were unchanged except for minor 
stylistic changes in section 239 (trespass onto cultivated land) 
                     
 23 The 1859 Civil Code defined “lawful fence” as follows:   
 
Every fence shall be deemed a lawful fence which is five 
feet high, if made of stone; or which is five feet high, if 
a hedge, or if made of wood, iron wire, or an artificial 
pali; or which is two feet high, if made upon an embankment 
of a ditch three feet deep, and at least two feet wide at 
the bottom, or upon an artificial or natural pali, three 
feet high.  If the fence be a ditch only, then it shall be 
nine feet wide at the top, and four feet deep.  Every fence 
to be a lawful fence, shall be substantially built, and 
reasonably strong and close to turn stock.   
 
1859 Civ. Code § 243, at 55.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
23 
 and an addition in section 240.24  Compare id. §§ 239-243, at 54 -
55 with Compiled Laws of the Hawaiian Kingdom §§ 239 -243, at 55 -
57 (1884) [hereinafter 1884 Civ. Code].  
  Thus, t he evolution of the early statutes addressed 
the concerns of farmers who were “greatly annoyed, by having 
their vegetables destroyed” by unconfined livestock , Laws of 
1842, at 58, and indicated  the framers ’ intent  to impose 
liability on livestock owners for the trespass of their animals 
onto all cultivated land and to provide increased protection to 
cultivated land enclosed with a lawful fence.   
 
 We next consider whether amendments made to the 
livestock statutes in 1888 introducing the terms “properly 
fenced” and “unfenced”  were intended to exclude certain 
cultivated land from statutory protection.   
 1888 Amendments b.
  Beginning in 1846, the livestock statutes provided  
statutory protection to all cultivated land, and they afforded 
an even greater level of protection 
in 1856 to lawfully fenced, 
cultivated land by increasing the amount of statutory 
damages a 
crop owner received for the physical 
trespass.  1847 Stat. Laws 
§§ 1-2, at 72; 1856 Sess. Laws §§ 5-8, at 50 -51; 1859 Civ.  Code 
§§ 239-243, at 54-55; 1884 Civ. Code §§ 239-243, at 55- 57.  
                     
 24 Section 240 of the Civil Code was amended in 1864 by adding a 
paragraph that empowered the “Governor of Oahu” to impound livestock grazing 
on certain public roads and environs.  1884 Civ. Code § 240, at 56.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
24 
 These statutes thus placed liability on livestock owners for 
trespass of their animals onto any cultivated land.  See Laws of 
1842, at 58-59; 1847 Stat . Laws §§ 1-2, at 58-59; 1856 Sess . 
Laws §§ 5-8, at 50- 51; 1859 Civ. Code §§ 239-243, at 54- 55; 1884 
Civ. Code §§ 239- 243, at 55- 57.    
  In 1888, a statute amending and consolidating the law 
relating to “Pounds, Estrays, Brands and Marks” was enacted  
(“1888 Act”).  Laws of His Majesty Kalakaua I, 1888 Sess. Laws 
Act 35, at 74 [hereinafter 1888 Sess. Laws].  A n original draft 
of the 1888 Act (“ Bill No. 27 ”) indicates that the drafters of 
the bill intended to continue providing statutory  protection to 
all cultivated land by setting forth a livestock owner’s 
liability for trespass onto cultivated land into a single 
provision.25  This consolidated  provision functionally 
incorporated the increased penalties from the prior law and  
substituted the phrase “ enclosed by a lawful fence” with 
“properly fenced.”   The provision in the original draft of Bill 
No. 27 read as follows:  
Sec. IX:  If any cattle horse, mule, ass, hog, sheep or 
goat shall trespass on any cultivated ground, the same 
being properly fenced, and shall destroy or injure the 
growing crop, or shall break the fence, or commit other 
waste or damage, the owner thereof shall pay to the  
landowner the full amount of such damage or loss.  But if 
                     
25 Prior to 1888, the civil code contained one provision addressing 
trespass onto any cultivated land ( § 239) and one provision addressing 
trespass onto any uncultivated land ( § 240).  1884 Civ. Code §§ 239, 240, at 
55-56.  A third provision doubled the penalties in sections 239 and 240 when 
the land was “enclosed by a lawful fence.”  Id. § 242, at 57.    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
25 
 the trespass shall be committed on cultivated ground which 
is not enclosed by a legal fence, the owner of the animal 
or animals shall pay to the owner of the land the sum of 
two dollars for each animal trespassing, excepting sheep 
and goats for which he shall pay twenty -five cents each; 
provided however, that if in any particular case this 
provision shall have an onerous or unjust bearing, owing to 
the large number of animals trespassing, the Judge shall 
have power to diminish the forfeiture.   
 
An Act to Amend and Consolidate the Law Relating  to Pounds, 
Estrays, Brands and Marks, Bill No. 27 §  9, at 5-6, in 1888 
Bills & Laws, #1-77, Box 89 (manuscript) (emphases added) 
[hereinafter Bill No. 27] (on file with the Hawai
i State 
Archives).      
  
Bill No. 27 specified only two types of cultivated 
land: “properly fenced” cultivated land , and cultivated land 
“not enclosed by a legal fence.”   This categorization is made 
clear by the sentence beginning with “But if” in Bill No. 27 
that distinguished between trespass onto “properly fenced” 
cultivated land and trespass onto “cultivated” land that was 
“not enclosed by a legal fence.”  The term “properly fenced” 
thus referred to land that was “enclosed by a legal fence.”   
  This  original version of the bill draft, which is 
preserved in the Hawai i State Archives
, has a handwritten 
notation in the bill’s margin next to the sentence beginning 
with “But if.”  The notation states “Sec 10,” ind icating that 
this portion of the provision was to be placed  into its own 
section.  Bill No. 27 § 9, at 5.  When this division was ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
26 . . . . 
(continued . . .)  
 incorporated in section 10 in a subsequent draft, a wording 
change was made:  
“cultivated  ground which is not enclosed by a legal fence,”  
  was rephrased as 
“any unfenced cultivated ground .”  
 
Sections 9 and 10 accordingly appear as follows in the 1888 Act:   
SECTION 9.  If any cattle, horse, mule, ass, swine, sheep 
or goat, shall trespass on any properly fenced, cultivated 
ground, the owner thereof shall pay to the owner of such 
land the full amount of the damage or loss occasioned by 
such estray to such land -owner, and the sum of fifty cents 
for each animal trespassing, excepting sheep and goats, for 
which he shall pay ten cents each[.]  
 
SECTION 10.  If any animals mentioned in Section 9 of this 
Act shall trespass upon any unfenced, cultivated ground, 
the owner thereof  shall pay to the owner of such land the 
sum of twenty -five cents for each animal trespassing, 
excepting for sheep and goats, for which he shall pay ten 
cents each.  The owner of such lands shall not be entitled 
to claim any damages for such trespass other  than said sum 
of twenty -five cents[.] 
 
1888 Sess. Laws §§ 9, 10, at 77- 78 (emphase s added) .26  
  While it would appear that the change in wording that 
occurred when section 9 was divided into two sections was 
intended to be stylistic only,27 the literal wording of section 
                     
26 There are three undated drafts in the file containing the drafts 
of Bill No. 27.  The first is a manuscript and appears to be the original 
bill draft introduced in the 1888 session.  The other two drafts include the 
division of section 9 into sections 9 and 10 as discussed.  File No. 222 -89-
2, in 1888 Bills & Laws, #1 -77, Box 89 (on file with the Hawa ii State 
Archives). 
 27 This is evident, for example, from the similarity of section 10’s 
language to section 11 of the 1888 Act.    
 
SECTION 10.  If any animals mentioned in Section 9 of this 
Act shall trespass upon any unfenced, cultivated ground, 
the owner thereo f shall pay to the owner of such land ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
27 
 10 could be read in isolation to mean “no fence” rather than  
land “not enclosed by a legal fence.”   This reading of section 
10 would exclude all cultivated land with a fence that did not 
meet the requirements of a legal fenc e (“not-properly fenced ”) 
from any statutory protection against trespassing livestock, in 
stark contrast to the purpose and text of the original draft of 
Bill No. 27 and its subsequent singularly stated objective to 
recodify section 9 into two sections.  The significant effect of 
abruptly excluding not-properly fenced, cultivated land from all  
statutory protection against trespassing livestock raises the 
question of whether the drafters’ use of the term “unfenced” was 
intended to depart from the liability 
scheme that had 
historically been a part of the livestock statutes.    
  I t is well established that statutes in pari materia 
should be construed together.  Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Omiya,  
142 Hawai i 439, 450, 420 P.3d 370, 381 (2018) (quoting State v. 
Kamanao, 118 Hawaii 210, 218, 188 P.3d 724, 732 (2008)).  In 
construing each individual part of a statute, the court must 
consider the statute as a whole to ensure that all parts produce 
                                                                              
(. . . continued)

of this Act shall trespass on any uncultivated land  the 
owner of such animals or animals shall pay to the owner of

 a sensible and harmonious  whole.  Kauai Springs, Inc. v. 
Planning Comm’n of Cty. of Kaua i, 133 Hawaii 141, 163, 324 P.3d 
951, 973 (2014); State v. Davis, 63 Haw. 191, 196, 624 P.2d 376, 
380 (1981).   
  Under the 1888 Act, a livestock owner whose cattle 
trespassed on “any unfenced, cultivated”  land or on “any 
uncultivated” land was required to pay to the owner of the land 
the sum of twenty-five cents per trespassing animal.  1888 Sess. 
Laws §§ 10, 11, at 77
-78.28  If section 10 only applied to 
cultivated land that was wholly unfenced, then the statute would 
protect not-properly fenced, 
uncultivated land to a greater 
degree than not-properly fenced, cultivated land.  This is 
because the owner of not-properly fenced, uncultivated land 
could recover a set sum for the trespass of each animal under 
section 11 of the 1888 Act, while the owner of not-properly 
fenced, cultivated land could not recover under section 10
.  
Stated differently, a livestock owner would only be required to 
pay the statutory amount for trespass to a crop owner of not -
                     
 28 Section 11 of the 1888 Act provides as follows:  
 
SECTION 11.  If any of the animals mentioned in Section 9 
of this Act shall trespass on any uncultivated land  the 
owner of such animal or animals shall pay  to the owner of 
the land the sum of twenty -five cents for the trespass of 
each animal, excepting for sheep and goats, for which he 
shall pay ten cents each, and if any damage be done by the 
animal or animals, the owner thereof shall further pay to 
the land- owner the full amount of such damage.  
 
1888 Sess. Laws § 11, at 78 (emphasis added) . ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
29 
 properly fenced land when the  crop owner was not growing crops.  
In effect, the statute as a whole would penalize a land owner 
for cultivating the land by depriving the crop owner of an 
ability to recover the set statutory amount for a trespassing 
animal.   
  
Similarly, an  owner of cultivated land  who sought to 
protect crops with a fence that inadvertently did not fully meet 
the requirements of a lawful fence  could not recover the 
statutory amount.  In contrast, an owner of cultivated land who 
made no attempt to protect crops with a fe
nce could recover a 
set sum for the trespass of each animal under section 10.  The 
statute would consequently have the effect of penalizing the 
crop owner who unsuccessfully attempted to qualify for the 
increased protection offered by section 9 of the statute,  
compared to crop owners  who did not take steps to protect their 
crops.  Thus, reading section 10 to apply only to wholly 
unfenced, cultivated land produces an inharmonious reading of 
the 1888 Act as a whole.  
See Kauai Springs, Inc., 133 Hawaii at 
163, 324 P.3d at 973.  
  Additionally, principles of statutory interpretation 
instruct that a statute must be read to give effect to all the 
sentences, clauses, and words in the statute.  Adams v. CDM 
Media USA, Inc., 135 Hawaii 1, 18, 346 P.3d 70, 87 (2015).   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
30 Under the 1888 Act, before a  person could impound 
trespassing animals, the person was required to provide a 
statement that included the amount of damages and expenses 
claimed.  1888 Sess. Laws § 4, at 75.   These expenses included 
the actual expenses incurred in capturing and conveying the 
trespassing animal to the pound in all cases and were required 
to “be
 added to the forfeits and damages specified in [sections 
  If section 9, 10, and 11]. ”  Id. § 13, at 78 (emphasis added).
10 applied only to wholly unfenced, cultivated land, this 
portion of section 13 would be superfluous when trespass 
occurred onto not-properly fenced, cultivated land
, a result 
that would be in conflict with giving effect to all clauses in a 3029
 
29Section 4 of the 1888 Act provided as follows:  
SECTION 4.  No Pound Master shall receive estrays until the 
person wishing to impound the same, shall have signed his 
name to a statement setting forth the number and species of 
estrays, locality trespassed upon, name of owner or owners 
of such estrays, if known, together with the date on which 
they were taken and the amount of damages and expenses 
claimed. . . .  
1888 Sess. Laws § 4, at 75.  
30Section 13 of the 1888 Act provided as follows:  
SECTION 13.  In all cases where animals are taken up for 
trespass, the actual expenses incurred, or a fair allowance 
for the labor required in catching, driving and conveying 
such animals to the pound, and of giving notice to the 
owner of the same, shall be added to the forfeits and 
damages specified in the preceding sections.  Provided 
however, that the charge for such catching, driving and 
conveying to the pound shall not exceed one dollar per 
head. 
1888 Sess. Laws § 13, at 78 (emphases added). ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
31 statute.  See Coon v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 98 Hawai i 233, 
250, 47 P.3d 348, 365 (2002) (rules of statutory construction 
require rejection of an interpretation that renders any part of 
the statutory language a nullity).  Similarly, section 14 
applies when “any animals are taken up for trespass” without 
limitation as to whether the land is cultivated or  
uncultivated.   The section provides that livestock owners shall 
be notified , if known,  of “the amount of damage and trespass 
fees claimed” when any trespassing animals are caught.  1888 
Sess. Laws § 14, at 789.  If the “legal charges ” (set forth in 
sections 9, 10, and 11 of the 1888 Act ) were not paid, the land 
owner could impound the anima
ls.  Id.  Again, if section 10 did 
not apply to not-properly fenced, cultivated land , the “legal 
charges” and impoundment clauses would be nullities despite 
section 14 ostensibly applying “ [w]hen any animal or animals are 
taken up for trespass.”  See Miyagawa v. Ferreira, 10 Haw. 23, 
23 (Haw. Rep. 1895) (making no distinction as to whether the 31
31Section 14 of the 1888 Act provides as follows:  
SECTION 14.  When any animal or animals are taken up for 
trespass, the owner, if known, shall be immediately 
notified, if reasonably practicable, of such fact, and of 
the amount of damage and trespass fees claimed, and if he 
shall refuse or fail to pay the legal charges, or in case 
the owner be unknown, then the animal or animals shall be 
impounded forthwith.  
1888 Sess. Laws § 14, at 79 (emphasis added).  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
32 
 trespassed land was fenced or not in recognizing that a “person 
whose land has been trespassed on and crops damaged” has a 
remedy under section 14 of the “impounding law” of 1888).  
Reading “unfenced” to include all cultivated land not included 
in section 9 gives full effect to all parts of sections 13 and 
14 in the 1888 Act.   
  We have also frequently  stated that statutes should be 
interpreted according to the intent, meaning, and purpose of the 
overall statutory scheme and not in a manner that would lead to 
absurd and unjust results.  Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hirose, 77 
Hawaii 362, 371, 884 P.2d 1138, 1147 (1994); see also Kim v. 
Contractors License Bd., 86 Hawai i 264, 269-70, 965 P.2d 806, 
811-12 (1998); Richardson v. City &  Cty. of Honolulu , 76 Hawaii 
46, 60, 868 P.2d 1193, 1207  (1994).  When a literal 
interpretation of a statute would lead to absurd or unjust 
results, the court may depart from its plain reading.  Franks v. 
City & Cty. of Honolulu, 74 Haw. 328, 341, 843 P.2d 668, 674 
(1993).  
  Beginning in 1856, the definition of “lawful fence” in 
the livestock statutes functioned to distinguish between 
cultivated land “enclosed by a lawful fence” and all other 
cultivated land in order to determine the amount of statutory 
damages a livestock owner was required to “forfeit and pay” to ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
33 
 the aggrieved land owner.  See  1856 Sess. Laws § § 8, 9, at 51.  
The original draft of Bill No. 27 did not change the function of 
the “lawful fence”  provision , and like the prior law, the 1888 
Act envisioned only two types of cultivated land: cultivated 
land enclosed by a lawful fence and all other cultivated land.   
  A ssuming arguendo  that “unfenced” meant “no fence,” 
the 1888 Act  would have, for the first time, created three 
categories of fences: lawful fences, no fences, and everything 
else in between (e.g., partial fences, not- properly built 
fences).  But dividing fences into three groups would result in 
irrational and illogical consequences to crop owners  in light of 
the definition of lawful fence.  
 
 First, to be properly fenced, fenced  land must be 
capable of preventing the trespass of livestock.   
SECTION 15.  Every fence shall be deemed a lawful fence 
which shall be . . . substantially built, strong and close, 
to turn all stock excepting swine, and in good repair.  The 
sea, rivers, ponds and natural perpendicular bluffs, 
whenever impassable, shall be legal fences.    
1888 Sess. Laws § 15, at 79  (emphasis added) .  To satisfy this  
requirement, land would have to be enclosed by a fence or have 
an impassable barrier on all four sides.  Any crop owner whose 
unfenced property was bordered by a neighbor’s fenced property 
on less than all sides 
would thereby have partially  fenced 
property, and such land would be excluded from statutory 
protection under the 1888 Act if “unfenced” meant “no fence” ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
34 
 because the land would neither be “properly fenced ” or 
“unfenced.”  This would force the crop owner to completely 
enclose their property with a proper fence or to persuade the 
neighbor to dismantle the fence in order to receive the 
statute’s protection .  This situation would be further 
complicated if the fence on the adjoining property was 
improperly built or fell into disrepair because a crop owner 
would be required to have the fence fixed to obtain statutory 
protection from trespassing livestock.  
  Similarly, because the definition of lawful fence 
included “impassable” rivers, ponds, and bluffs , any cultivated 
land with such a natural barrier would result in the property 
being partially fenced unless the barrier completely enclosed 
the property.  In such a situation , the cultivated land would 
not be considered to have “no fence ,” and the landowner would 
not be entitled to compensation when livestock trespass occurred 
unless the remainder of the property was  properly fenced.  A 
crop owner with an impassable barrier on the property would 
therefore be required to undertake the time and expense to 
properly enclose the land with a lawful fence
 or lose protection 
under the statute.  The 1888 Act would thus shift responsibility 
for preventing a trespass from livestock owners to crop owners 
when circumstances beyond the crop owner ’s control rendered 
their property not properly fenced.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
35 
   Finally , in order to receive protection under the 1888 
Act, the owner of fenced cultivated land would be required to 
show that the fence was (1) made of “suitable materials,” 
(2) not less than 4½ feet in height, (3) “substantially built,” 
(4) “strong and close, to turn all stock,” and (5)  in good 
repair.  1888 Sess. Laws § 15, at 79.   However, a  landowner 
would encounter extreme difficulty (absent intentional damage to 
the fence) in proving a fence was “substantially built, strong 
and close, to turn all stock” in light of the fact that the 
claim for damages would have had to result from a trespass.  If 
section 10 provided statutory protection only to cultivated land 
with no fencing, a landowner would risk losing all protection 
under the statute by choosing to erect a fence.  This would have 
the absurd effect of disincentiviz ing fencing on cultivated land 
because a landowner with no fence  could always recover for 
trespass under section 10, but the owner of fenced cultivated 
land would always have to prove the land was “properly fenced” 
pursuant to section 9.   
  I nterpreting “unfenced” to mean “no fence” thus leads 
to unjust and absurd results.32  Rather, i t is apparent that the 
                     
 32 It is unsurprising that the legislative history for the 1888 law 
provides no report or explanation for the change of wording in section 10, 
particularly one indicating an intent to depart from the established 
liability scheme.  See  File No. 222- 89-2, in 1888 Bills & Laws, #1 -77, Box 89 
(on file with the Hawai i State Archives).   
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
36 
 1888 Act’s drafters intended section s 9 and 10 to be construed 
together such that livestock owners would continue to be liable 
for trespass onto all cultivated land as the prior livestock 
laws had provided.  Reading “unfenced” to include all land not 
enclosed by a lawful fence 
also maintains the appropriate 
function of the “lawful fence” provision and is consistent with 
the intent, meaning, and purpose of the overall statutory scheme 
as evidenced by the legislative history of the prior livestock 
statutes.  
  Accor dingly, review of the previous legislative 
history of the livestock statutes and the application of 
principles of statutory construction plainly manifest that the 
phrase “any unfenced, cultivated land” was not intended to 
exclude all cultivated property not enclosed by a lawful fence  
from statutory protection against trespassing livestock.33  The 
word “unfenced” in section 10 of the 1888 Act must therefore be 
read as including cultivated land not enclosed by a lawful 
fence.  
                     
 33 Sections 9 and 10 were recodified into the territorial laws of 
Hawaii in 1907, and incorporated into the Revised Laws in 1925, 1935, 1945, 
and 1955.  Laws of the Territory of Hawai i, 1907 Sess. Laws Act 125, §§ 12,

279 (1935); RLH §§ 1084, 1085 (1945); RLH §§ 20 -62, 20-63 (1955).

  1975 Amendments c.
  The  provisions in the 1888 Act addressing trespass 
onto cultivated land remained substantively unchanged until 
1975.  In 1975, HRS §§  142-63 and 142- 64 were amended to their 
current form, which permit landowners to recover “the full 
amount of the damage or loss” from trespassing livestock 
regardless of whether the property is “fenced” or “ unfenced. ”34  
See 1975 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 40, § 1 at 69.  These amendments 
effectively eliminated any distinction between fenced and 
unfenced cultivated land, thereby treating trespass onto all 
cultivated land the same.  Further, the intended purpose of 
these amendments indicates an understanding by the legislature 
that not-properly fenced, cultivated land would be covered under 
the statutory scheme.  The purpose of the amendment
s was 
explained by both a House and Senate report.  The House R eport 
provided the following: 
                     
 34 As stated, HRS §§  142-63 and 142 -64 provide as follows:  
 
§142-63 Trespass on fenced cultivated land.  If any cattle, 
horse, mule, ass, swine, she
ep, or goat, trespasses on any  
properly fenced  cultivated ground, the owner thereof shall 
pay upon proof, the full amount of the damage or loss to 
the landowners, or to any person in possession of the land, 
whoever suffers the damage or loss.  
 
§142-64 On unfenced cultivated land.  If any of the animals 
mentioned in section 142 -63 trespasses on any unfenced 
cultivated ground, the owner thereof shall pay upon proof, 
the full amount of the damage or loss to the landowner or 
to any person in possession of the land, whoever suffers 
the damage or loss.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
38 
  The purpose of this bill is to modify the liability 
of livestock owners for trespass of their animals upon 
land. 
 The bill would amend the present law by making the 
owner of livestock liable for all proven damages or losses 
for the trespass of his animals . 
 Presently, the land owner can recover for property 
damage only if the land is fenced.  He is also entitled to 
a specific monetary amount for each head of trespassing 
livestock, at the discretion of the court.  
 Owners of unfenced cultivated land can recover only a 
specific monetary amount for each head of trespassing 
livestock, also at the discretion  of the court. 
 This bill would simplify the determination of damages 
in all animal trespass cases.  
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 428, in 1975 House Journal, at 1149 
(emphasis added).  Similarly, t he Senate Report explained the 
following purpose of the Act:  
 The purpose of this bill is to modify the liability 
of livestock owners for trespass of their animals upon 
fenced or unfenced cultivated land as well as fenced 
uncultivated land.  Also, the bill simplifies the 
determination of damages in all animal trespass cases . 
 The deletion of material concerning penalties “per 
head[,”] with varying amounts depending on what kind of 
animal trespassed, is appropriate.  The present law 
originated in a predominantly agricultural era and as such, 
has little justification toda y on a “per head” basis.  
Requiring the livestock owner to bear the full cost of 
damages or loss to the land owner, upon proof of such, is 
more in line with present conditions . 
 Your Committee has amended the bill to provide that 
not only the landowner, but any person in possession of the 
land who suffers loss or damage would be compensated.  This 
would include lessees, tenants, purchasers under an 
agreement of sale or any other person in possession of the 
land. 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 823, in 1975 Senate Journal, at 1143 
(emphases added).    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
39 
   These committee reports demonstrate that the 
legislature viewed cultivated land as being either fenced or 
unfenced and intended to “mak[e] the owner of livestock liable 
for all proven damages or losses for the trespass of his 
animals”  in either event.  H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 428, at 
1149.  That is, regardless of the status or quality of the 
fence, “in all animal trespass cases” livestock o wners became 
liable for “the full cost of damages or loss to the land.”  
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 823, at 1143.  This simplified the 
determination of damages because the trier of fact was 
previously required to make fact -intensive determinations as to 
whether a property was “properly fenced” based on whether the 
fence was (1) “substantially built, ” (2) “strong and close ,” 
(3) “existing in [a] good state,” and (4) “ capable of turning 
[away] all stock . . . attempting to pass through the fence.”  
HRS § 142-61.   
  Additionally, in such cases, the burden would 
presumably be placed upon the crop owner to prove these 
requirements, and a  failure to satisfy any of the requirements 
would result in a determination that the property  was not 
“properly fenced.”   As explained supra, this would place a crop 
owner in the position of having to prove that the land 
trespassed upon was “properly fenced” with a fence “capable of 
turning . . . all stock . . . attempting to pass through the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
40 
 fence,” which would almost always  be disproved by the fact that 
the livestock was able to circumvent the fence. 
  
But after the 1975 amendments , a court or jury was no 
longer required to make this complicated factual determination 
when deciding the amount of damages to
 award under Chapter 142.   
Instead, the 1975 amendments “simplified” the  liability scheme 
“in all animal trespass cases” by making a livestock owner 
liable for the full amount of damages caused by the owner’s 
trespassing animals on cultivated land.35  And rather than repeal 
sections 142-63 and 142-64 and enact a new statute, the 
legislature simply 
embedded the new liability scheme into the 
pre-existing statutory language.   
  
However, the legislative intent to simplify the 
determination of damages would not have been achieved unless HRS 
§ 142-64 applied to all cultivated land not properly fenced.  
This is because the trier of fact would still be required to 
make this complicated factual determination in cases that 
involved trespass onto any fenced, cultivated land to assess the 
applicability of HRS §  142-63.  The amendments also would not 
                     
 35 In 1975, the legislature also amended the statutes “to provide 
that not only the landowner, but any person in possession of the land who 
suffers loss or damage would be compensated.”  S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 823, 
at 1143.  It is noted that, as a practical matter, tenants and lessees may 
not be in a position to fence property as it may be cost prohibitive or 
difficult to complete within the time frame of the lease.  The tenant thus 
may have little control over the fencing whereas the owner of livestock 
presumably would have control over the animals.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
41 
 have accomplished the stated purpose of “making the owner of 
livestock liable for all proven damages or losses for the 
trespass of his animals” because a livestock owner woul d evade 
liability in cases involving trespass onto not-properly fenced 
cultivated land.   
  The  history of sections 142- 63 and 142 -64 thus 
manifests an understanding by the legislature in 1975 that these 
sections would make a livestock owner liable for the “full cost 
of damages” to “any [] person in possession” of the cultivated 
land.  And it is clear that the legislature intended to impose 
liability upon livestock owners for  livestock damage to any 
cultivated land, regardless of the existence or condition of a 
fence “in all animal trespass cases.”   H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 
428, at 1149; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 823, at 1143.  The ICA 
was therefore incorrect in determining that the Aguiars were not 
responsible for the damages that their livestock caused to Yin’s 
crops because his leased property was neither “ properly fenced ” 
nor “unfenced.”   
B. The Exculpatory Lease Provision Is Contrary to Statutory Law 
and Public Policy.    
Yin argues that HRS §§ 142-63 and 142 -64 demonstrate a 
public policy that “any person suffering crop damage caused by 
trespassing livestock is entitled to compensation.”  And because ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
42 
 the lease provision exculpating the Aguiars violated these 
statutes, Yin contends, the provision is void.36 
Generally, a party “who assents to a contract is bound 
by it.”  Courbat v. Dahana Ranch, Inc., 111 
Hawaii 254, 264, 141 
P.3d 427, 437 (2006) (quoting Leong v. Kaiser Found. Hosps., 71 
Haw. 240, 245, 788 P.2d 164, 168 (1990)).  Under this basic 
principle, parties “are permitted to make exculpatory contracts 
so long as they are knowingly and willingly  made and free from 
fraud.”  Id. (quoting Fujimoto v. Au, 95 Hawai i 116, 156 , 19 
P.3d 699, 739 (2001)).  However, exculpatory clau ses “are not 
favored” and, “if possible,” will be “construed not to confer 
this immunity.”  Fujimoto, 95 Hawaii at 155, 19 P.3d at 738 
(citing 15 Williston on Contracts §  1750A, at 144-45 (3d ed. 
1972)).  Exculpatory provisions are disfavored because “they 
tend to allow conduct below the acceptable standard of care.”  
Id. at 155, 19 P.3d at 738 (quoting Yauger v. Skiing Enters., 
Inc., 557 N.W.2d 60, 62 (Wisc. 1996)); see also  Laeroc Waikiki 
Parkside, LLC v. K.S.K. (Oahu) Ltd. P’ship , 115 Hawaii 201, 224, 
166 P.3d 961, 984 (2007) (“[T]he law of torts imposes standards 
of conduct for the protection of others against unreasonable 
                     
 36 The ICA does not appear to have addressed whether the exculpatory 
lease provision violated a public policy established by HRS § 142-63 or HRS 
§ 142-64 because it found that neither statute applied.  Because we find that 
the statutes impose liability on a livestock owner for trespass damage to 
cultivated land, we consider whether the circuit court erred in concluding 
that the lease provision was not void against public policy.   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
43 
 risk of harm and one cannot exempt himself from such liability 
for harm that is c aused either intentionally or recklessly.” 
(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)) . 
When evaluating the validity of such clauses, we 
“examine[] whether [they] violate public policy.”  Fujimoto, 95 
Hawaii at 156, 19 P.3d at 739 ; see also 15 Grace McLane Giesel, 
Corbin on Contracts § 79.1, at 1 (2003) (“The law has a long 
history of recognizing the general rule that certain contracts, 
though properly entered into in all other respects, will not be 
enforced . . . if found to be contrary to public policy.”).   
Public policy, generally, is a “principle of law which declares 
that no one may lawfully do that which has a tendency to be 
injurious to the public welfare.”  McClure Eng ’g Assocs., Inc. 
v. Reuben H. Donnelley Corp., 447 N.E.2d 400, 402 (Ill. 1983).  
Public policy may therefore derive from numerous sources 
including constitutional provisions, statutory provisions, or 
the common law.  2 Barry A. Lindahl, Modern Tort Law: Liability 
and Litigation § 21:5 , at 481  (2d ed. 2019 ); Giesel, supra, 
§ 79.2, at 5.  This court has specifically identified three 
situations when an exculpatory provision is void as against 
public policy: (1) if the provision is “violative of a statute,” 
(2) if it is “contrary to a substantial public interest,” or (3) 
if the provision was “gained through inequ ality of bargaining 
power.”  Fujimoto, 95 Hawai i at 156, 19 P.3d at 739 (citing ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
44 
 Andrews v. Fitzgerald, 823 F.Supp. 356, 378 (M.D.N.C. 1993)); 
see also Inlandboatmen’s Union v. Sause Bros. , Inc., 77 Hawai i 
187, 194, 881 P.2d 1255, 1262 (App. 1994) (“[A] court may refuse 
to enforce contracts that violate law or public policy.”).   
  In Bowers v. Alamo Rent- A-Car, Inc. , we addressed an 
“escape clause,” which is akin to an exculpatory clause, that 
attempted to alter the liability scheme established by a 
statute.  88 Hawai i 274, 275, 965 P.2d 1274, 1275 (1998).  
In 
that case, the renter of a motor vehicle had a car insurance 
policy with State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company that 
provided that if the renter drove a car that the renter did not 
own that “ha[d] other vehicle liability coverage on it,” then 
the State Farm policy would constitute excess coverage.  Id.  
The renter rented a car from Alamo Rent- a-car, Inc. , and the 
rental agreement stated that “ [i]f there is no other valid and 
collectible insurance, whether primary, excess, or contingent, 
available to the renter . . . then Alamo’s vehicle liability 
policy shall pay damages not to exceed minimum limits required 
by applicable law.”  Id.  In essence, the rental provision 
attempted to shift the responsibility to provide liability 
insurance from Alamo to State Farm.  Id.  at 278, 965 P.2d at 
1278.  After being involved in an automobile accident with the 
rental car, the renter brought an indemnification suit against ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
45 
 Alamo, and Alamo denied that it had a duty to insure the renter.  
Id. at 275, 965 P.2d at 1275. 
  At the time that the litigation commenced, a Hawai i 
statute provided that “ [e]very owner of a motor vehicle used or 
operated at any time upon any public street, road, or highway of 
this State shall obtain a no-fault policy upon such 
vehicle . . .  and shall maintain the no-fault policy at all 
times for the entire motor vehicle registration period .”  Id. at 
277, 965 P.2d at 1277 (quoting HRS § 431:10C-104(b) (1993)).  We 
explained that the statute placed “the primary obligation to 
provide minimum coverage for the owned vehicle”  on “the owner of 
[the] vehicle,” which was Alamo.  Id.   For Alamo to escape 
liability, this court stated, the escape clause would have to be 
construed as “providing no  vehicle liability coverage”  because 
the basis of minimum coverage would be the State Farm policy’s 
excess coverage provision.  Id.  at 277-78, 965 P.2d at 1277- 78.  
Because the statute mandated  that “[t]he owner of the automobile 
[was] responsible for providing coverage, ” the Bowers court held 
that the escape clause violated public policy by “ contractually 
shifting responsibility [for providing liability coverage] to 
the [renter]’s insurance company.”  Id. at 279, 965 P.2d at 
1279. 
  For more than 175 years, Hawaii law has held livestock 
owners liable under specified circumstances for the damages ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
46 
 caused by their trespassing livestock, with the law in Hawaii 
providing greater statutory protectio
ns to cultivated land as 
time passed.  See supra Part IV. A.2.  These protections were 
broadened in 1975 when the legislature “modif[ied]” the 
liability imposed by HRS Chapter 142 to “[r]equire the livestock 
owner to bear the full cost of damages or loss to the land 
owner” or “any person in possession of the land,” which was 
“more in line with present conditions.”  S. Stand. Comm. Rep. 
No. 823, at 1143.  This established  history of imposing 
liability on the livestock owners for their trespassing animals 
and providing greater statutory protections to cultivated land 
demonstrates a public policy in HRS Chapter 142 for holding 
livestock owners responsible for damages caused by their 
livestock.   
  Here, the exculpatory provision in Yin’s lease stated 
that he was “fully responsible” for “keeping cattle[] out of 
[his] crops.”  On its face, this provision broadly exculpate
s 
the Aguiars from all damage to Yin’s land  that resulted from 
their trespassing cattle.  Even if  Yin’s property was 
“unfenced,” this clause would exculpate the Aguiars.   The same 
would be true if Yin’s property was “ properly fenced.”   Similar 
to the escape clause in Bowers , the exculpatory clause in Yin’s 
lease has the effect of exculpating  a party from liability that 
is statutorily bound to pay damages.  This directly contradicts ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***  
47 
 HRS §§ 142- 63 and 142- 64, which , as explained, provide that 
livestock owners are liable for the damage caused by their 
trespassing animals onto cultivated land regardless of whether a 
property is “properly fenced” or “unfenced.”   Not only is this 
liability codified in Hawai i’s statutes, but it is also a basic 
principle of common law.37  Because t he exculpatory clause is 
violative of Hawai i’s statutory law, it violates public policy.  
Fujimoto, 95 Hawai i at 156, 158, 19 P.3d at 739,  741 (holding 
that “the statute must take precedence over the terms of the 
contract” where an exculpatory clause was in direct conflict 
with a statute).  Thus, the clause is unenforceable and does not 
exculpate the Aguiars from liability arising from the  damage to 
Yin’s sweet potatoes  caused by their cattle.   The circuit court 
accordingly erred in concluding that the exculpatory lease 
provision did not violate public policy,  and the ICA also erred  
                     
 37 Under both the English and American common law, the owner of 
cattle or livestock was liable for the damage done by trespassing animals.  
See Studwell v. Ritch, 14 Conn. 292, 292 (1841) (stating that under English 
common law it was “the duty of the owner of cattle to restrain them” and the 
owner was “generally liable in damages” for trespass upon the land of another 
person); 7 Stuart M. Speiser et al., Am. Law of Torts  § 21:33 (2018) 
(“Generally, a possessor  of livestock . . . is strictly liable for damages 
resulting from the animal’s trespasses.”); 4 Barry A. Lindahl, Modern Tort 
Law: Liability and Litigation  § 36:14 (2d ed. 2018) (“Liability for damage 
caused by trespassing animals is absolute.”).  Pursuant to HRS § 1-1 (2009), 
“The common law of England, as ascertained by English and American decisions, 
is declared to be the common law of the State of Hawaii  . . ., except as 
otherwise expressly provided by” federal or State law.      ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

 in concluding that it was Yin’s duty to “keep the cows off his 
property.”38 
V. CONCLUSION 
  Based on the foregoing, we vacate the ICA’s Judgment 
on Appeal and the circuit court’s March 27, 2015 Order Granting 
Defendants Virginio Aguiar, Kevin Aguiar , and Agee, Inc.’s 
Motion for Summary Judgment As to All Claims Filed December 24, 
2014 and its July 1, 2015 Judgment in Favor of Defendants 
Virginio Aguiar, Kevin Aguiar and Agee, Inc. and Against 
Plaintiff Jijun Yin.39  This case is remanded to the circuit 
court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.  
                     
 38 As noted, infra note 13, the ICA held that the Aguiars met their 
burden of producing evidence that they were intended beneficiaries of the 
lease.  We need not address this aspect of the ICA’s ruling as the 
exculpatory provision violated public policy, regardless of whether the 
Aguiars were its intended beneficiaries.   
 
 39 Based on our disposition herein, the circuit court’s June 9, 2015 
Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendants Virginio Aguiar, Jr., 
Kevin Aguiar, and Agee, Inc.’s Motion for an Award of Attorneys’ Fees and the 
Taxation of Costs Filed March 27, 2015, is also vacated as the Aguiars’ 
status as a prevailing party under HAR Rule 25 relies upon the circuit 
court’s grant of summary judgment.
