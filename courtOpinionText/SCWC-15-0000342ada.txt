CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
 
  When a person violates a trespass warning previously 
issued pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-
814(1)(b), may that violation be used as an underlying basis for a charge of second-degree burglary? We answer in the negative. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER***

OPINION OF THE COURT BY POLLACK, J. 
 
 
   
                     
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
A. Trespass Warning and King’s Reentry 
On November 11, 2014, at the Kaimuki Times 
Supermarket, Rudolph G. King, Jr. stole a pack of Reese’s Peanut 
Butter Cups and sweet tea, the total value of which was $8.66. A loss prevention officer stopped King outside the store and placed him under arrest for theft in the fourth degree. See HRS 
§ 708-833 (2014).
1 At the time of King’s arrest, the loss 
prevention officer issued King a trespass warning form entitled 
“Notification to Stay Off Property,” which stated as follows: 
YOU ARE HEREBY ADVISED THAT YOUR PRESENCE IS NO LONGER 
DESIRED ON THE PREMISES OR PROPERTY LISTED ABOVE AND ON ALL 
PROPERTIES LISTED ON THE BACK OF THIS WARNING. THIS SERVES 
NOTICE THAT YOU ARE NOT TO RETURN TO SAID PROPERTY FOR THE DURATION LISTED ABOVE. VIOLATION OF THIS WARNING WILL SUBJECT YOU TO ARREST AND PROSECUTION FOR TRESPASSING PURSUANT TO SECTION 708-814 OF THE HAWAII PENAL CODE. 
The trespass warning contains the addresses of all Times 
Supermarket locations in Hawai #i, and it was effective from 
November 11, 2014, to November 11, 2015. The warning also 
quotes HRS § 708-814(1)(b) (2014), contains King’s description, and was signed by the loss prevention officer, a police officer, and King. 
1 HRS § 708-833 provides as follows: 
(1) A person commits the offense of theft in the fourth
degree if the person commits theft of property or services
of any value not in excess of $250. 
(2) Theft in the fourth degree is a petty misdemeanor.

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
On December 18, 2014, at the McCully location of Times 
Supermarket, a loss prevention officer observed King take a 
ribeye roast, valued at $55.55, and exit the store without 
paying for it. After placing King under arrest, King verbally acknowledged that he was issued a prior trespass warning. 
On December 22, 2014, King was charged by felony 
information with burglary in the second degree, in violation of HRS § 708-811 (2014): 
On or about December 18, 2014, in the City and County
of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, RUDOPH G. KING JR. [(sic)]
did intentionally enter unlawfully in a building, to wit,Times Supermarket, situated at 1772 South King Street, with
intent to commit therein a crime against a person or
property rights, thereby committing the offense of Burglaryin the Second Degree in violation of Section 708-811
[2] of 
the Hawaii Revised Statutes.[3] 
B. King’s Motion to Dismiss 
On January 30, 2015, King filed a Motion to Dismiss 
Felony Information for Lack of Probable Cause and/or De Minimis 
Violation (motion to dismiss) to the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court). King contended that the State’s 
2 HRS § 708-811 states as follows: 
(1) A person commits the offense of burglary in
the second degree if the person intentionally enters
or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to
commit therein a crime against a person or against
property rights. 
(2) Burglary in the second degree is a class C
felony. 
3 An amended felony information was filed on December 29, 2014, to
accurately reflect King’s name. 
3
  
 
  
                     
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
reliance on the written trespass warning issued to him at Times 
Supermarket Kaimuki fails, as a matter of law, to establish 
probable cause that he unlawfully entered Times Supermarket 
McCully in violation of the second-degree burglary statute. King contended that a second-degree burglary charge pursuant to HRS § 708-811 cannot hinge upon a refusal to obey a prior written trespass warning issued pursuant to HRS § 708-814(1)(b), because a trespass warning is applicable only to a charge of criminal trespass in the second degree. That is, a person’s failure to obey a prior written trespass warning issued pursuant 
to HRS § 708-814(1)(b) does not satisfy the “enters or remains 
unlawfully in a building” element of burglary in the second degree. Alternatively, King argued, pursuant to HRS § 702-236, that his conduct did not actually cause or threaten the harm or evil sought to be prevented by burglary in the second degree, since his conduct did not engender circumstances likely to terrorize occupants of premises intended to be protected by the second-degree burglary statute.

5 A court has statutory authority to dismiss a prosecution if the
conduct alleged constitutes a de minimis infraction: 
(1) The court may dismiss a prosecution if, having
regard to the nature of the conduct alleged and the nature
of the attendant circumstances, it finds that thedefendant’s conduct: 
(a) Was within a customary license or tolerance, which
was not expressly refused by the person whose
(continued . . . )

   The State opposed King’s motion to dismiss, arguing 
that the plain language of “enter or remain unlawfully” under 
HRS § 708-800 encompasses situations in which the defendant 
disobeys a prior trespass warning issued pursuant to HRS § 708-814(1)(b). According to the State, the prior trespass warning issued to King is “a lawful order not to enter or remain, personally communicated to” King, because its terms advised King that he was not allowed to enter or remain on Times Supermarket property--including Times Supermarket McCully--from November 11, 2014, through November 11, 2015. In response to King’s argument 
that his conduct constituted only a de minimis violation of the 
burglary statute, the State argued that second-degree burglary was not only intended to prevent crimes involving “the terrorizing of persons situated on the relevant property,” but 
                                                                  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(continued . . .)  
interest was infringed and which is not
inconsistent with the purpose of the law definingthe offense; 
(b) 
	Did not actually cause or threaten the harm or evilsought to be prevented by the law defining theoffense or did so only to an extent too trivial towarrant the condemnation of conviction; or 
(c) 	Presents such other extenuations that it cannot 
reasonably be regarded as envisaged by the
legislature in forbidding the offense. 
(2) The court shall not dismiss a prosecution under
subsection (1)(c) of this section without filing a writtenstatement of its reasons. 
HRS § 702-236 (2014).

 7  The parties did not proffer oral arguments with respect to King’s
contention that his conduct constituted a de minimis violation of HRS § 708-
811. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
it also applied to unoccupied premises. Accordingly, the State 
urged the circuit court to deny King’s motion to dismiss. 
C. Hearing on King’s Motion to Dismiss 
At the hearing on King’s motion to dismiss,6 King 
contended that liability under HRS § 708-814(1)(b) should not be used to impose an elevated criminal liability under the second-degree burglary statute, which uses a separate definition for “enters or remains unlawfully.” According to King, the prior trespass warning was not a “lawful order” contemplated by HRS § 708-800 and that, therefore, the violation of the prior trespass 
warning would not satisfy the “enters or remains unlawfully” 
element of second-degree burglary under HRS § 708-811. King thus maintained that he should have been charged only with theft in the fourth degree and criminal trespass in the second degree. 
In response, the State argued that the prior trespass 
warning issued personally to King revoked his privilege or license to enter or remain in any Times Supermarket location, and, hence, when King entered the McCully location of Times 
Supermarket, the “enters or remains unlawfully” element of 
second-degree burglary was met.
7 
6 The Honorable Dean E. Ochiai presided. 
6
  
 
   
  
  The State timely filed its notice of appeal to the 
Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA). The State challenged the 
circuit court’s order granting King’s motion to dismiss, arguing 
(1) that there was sufficient evidence to support the felony 
information and (2) that King’s conduct was not a de minimis violation of HRS § 708-811. 
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The circuit court granted King’s motion and dismissed 
with prejudice the charge of burglary in the second degree: 
The Court’s of the belief that a trespass warning . . .
does not give rise to having it become a vehicle to charge
a Burglary in the Second Degree. I see two charges here.I see a Criminal Trespass in the Second Degree and a TheftFourth Degree charge just based upon all that the Court hashad to consider during the course of this hearing. 
The court concluded that the State was attempting to 
convert two petty misdemeanors into a Class C felony, a course 
of action that the court rejected under the facts of the case. The circuit court also indicated that “the State [wa]s free to 
refile other charges that the facts in this case may give rise 
to.” The court later filed its written Order Granting Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Felony Information (Order Granting Motion to Dismiss). 
II. APPELLATE PROCEEDINGS 
In a memorandum opinion, the ICA concluded that there 
was probable cause to support the charge of burglary in the second degree. State v. King, 2016 WL 3077890, at *4, 138 
7
  
 
   
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Hawai#i 51, 375 P.3d 1289 (App. 2016) (mem.). According to the 
ICA, the plain language of HRS § 708-800 indicates that 
the Burglary 2 statute includes the situation at bar, as
King is alleged to have intentionally entered TimesSupermarkets’ premises in defiance of a lawful order not toenter the premises, which had been personally communicated
to King by an authorized person, i.e., Times Supermarkets’
[loss prevention officer], with the intent to commit acrime therein against property rights. 
Id. at *3. 
The ICA declined to examine the legislative history of 
HRS §§ 708-800, 708-811, and 708-814 because King “fail[ed] to 
cite any legislative history supporting his interpretation and fail[ed] to show that the plain language reading of HRS §§ 708– 800 and 708–811 would produce an absurd or unjust result that is inconsistent with the policies of the Burglary 2 statute.” Id. 
The ICA also did not address King’s argument that the rule of lenity favors a less-expansive interpretation of HRS §§ 708-800, 
708-811, and 708-814(1)(b). 
With respect to King’s argument that his conduct 
constituted a de minimis violation of HRS § 708-811, the ICA 
observed that the circuit court “did not enter written findings of fact and conclusions of law, and neither its oral ruling [n]or its written order specifically state[s] whether the court’s ruling was based on King’s probable cause argument or his de minimis violation argument.” Id. at *6. The ICA 
concluded that the state of the record precluded it from 
8
  
 
   
  On certiorari, King challenges the ICA’s decision that 
there was probable cause to support the felony information. The 
essence of the State’s theory as to probable cause is that King’s violation of a prior trespass warning issued by an authorized agent of Times Supermarket pursuant to HRS § 708-814(1)(b) (2014) constitutes a defiance of “a lawful order not ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
reviewing the circuit court’s exercise of discretion. Id. 
Thus, the ICA remanded the case to the circuit court for 
consideration of whether the felony information should be 
dismissed on de minimis grounds. Id. Accordingly, the ICA 
vacated the circuit court’s Order Granting Motion to Dismiss. Id. 
III.
 STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
The sufficiency of a felony information is based on 
“whether there is probable cause to believe that the offense charged was committed and that the defendant committed the 
offense charged.” HRS § 806-85(a) (2014). Probable cause 
determinations are reviewed by this court de novo. State v. 
Detroy, 102 Hawai #i 13, 18, 72 P.3d 485, 490 (2003). “Statutory 
interpretation presents questions of law that are reviewed de 
novo under the right/wrong standard.” State v. Lei, 95 Hawai #i 
278, 281, 21 P.3d 880, 883 (2001).

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
to enter” under HRS § 708-800 (2014) and that, therefore, King 
entered Times Supermarket McCully unlawfully on December 18, 
2014.8 This unlawful entry, argues the State, can be the basis 
for charging King with burglary in the second degree under HRS § 
708-811 (2014). In response, King maintains that, because the prior trespass warning issued to him pursuant to HRS § 708-814(1)(b) does not qualify as a “lawful order” under HRS § 708-800, his conduct did not constitute an unlawful entry within the meaning of this statute; hence, there was no probable cause that his conduct constituted burglary in the second degree under HRS 
§ 708-811. 
In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to 
establish probable cause, the evidence, and all reasonable 
inferences that can be drawn therefrom, is viewed in favor of 
the felony information. State v. Ganal,  81 Hawai #i 358, 367, 917 
P.2d 370, 379 (1996). 
Whether there is probable cause to 
support the felony information in this case depends on whether a 
prior trespass warning issued pursuant to HRS § 708-814(1)(b) is a “lawful order” under HRS § 708-800, the violation of which provides a basis for a second-degree burglary charge. 
8 The felony information does not charge that King remained
unlawfully in the McCully location of Times Supermarket. 
10
  
 
   
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
It is undisputed that statutory construction begins 
with an examination of the plain language in order to determine 
and give effect to the legislative intent and purpose underlying 
the statute. State v. Alangcas, 134 Hawai #i 515, 525, 345 P.3d 
181, 191 (2015); State v. McKnight, 131 Hawai #i 379, 388, 319 
P.3d 298, 307 (2013). “The legislature is presumed not to 
intend an absurd result, and legislation will be construed to 
avoid, if possible, inconsistency, contradiction[,] and 
illogicality.” State v. Arceo, 84 Hawai #i 1, 19, 928 P. 2d 843, 
861 (1996) (quoting State v. Malufao, 80 Hawai #i 126, 137, 906 
P.2d 612, 623 (1995)). 
A. Plain Language 
HRS § 708-811 defines burglary in the second degree as 
follows: 
(1) A person commits the offense of burglary in the
second degree if the person intentionally enters or remains
unlawfully in a building with intent to commit therein a
crime against a person or against property rights. 
(2) Burglary in the second degree is a class C felony. 
HRS § 708-811. “Enter or remain unlawfully,” as defined by HRS 
§ 708-800, 
means to enter or remain in or upon premises when the
person is not licensed, invited, or otherwise privileged to
do so. A person who, regardless of the person’s intent,
enters or remains in or upon premises which are at the timeopen to the public does so with license and privilegeunless the person defies a lawful order not to enter or
remain, personally communicated to the person by the owner
of the premises or some other authorized person. A license 
or privilege to enter or remain in a building which is only 
11
  
 
  
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
partly open to the public is not a license or privilege to
enter or remain in that part of the building which is notopen to the public. 
HRS § 708-800 (emphasis added). HRS § 708-814(1)(b) sets forth 
the offense of criminal trespass in the second degree as applied to commercial premises: 
(1) A person commits the offense of criminal trespass in
the second degree if: 
. . . . 
(b) The person enters or remains unlawfully in or
upon commercial premises after a reasonable
warning or request to leave by the owner orlessee of the commercial premises, the owner’s orlessee’s authorized agent, or a police officer;
provided that this paragraph shall not apply to
any conduct or activity subject to regulation bythe National Labor Relations Act. 
For the purposes of this paragraph,
“reasonable warning or request” means a warningor request communicated in writing at any timewithin a one-year period inclusive of the datethe incident occurred, which may contain but isnot limited to the following information: 
(i) A warning statement advising the person that
the person’s presence is no longer desired
on the property for a period of one year
from the date of the notice, that a 
violation of the warning will subject the
person to arrest and prosecution fortrespassing pursuant to section 708-814(1)(b),
 and that criminal trespass in the
second degree is a petty misdemeanor; 
(ii)
 The legal name, any aliases, and a
photograph, if practicable, or a physical
description, including but not limited to
sex, racial extraction, age, height, weight,hair color, eye color, or any otherdistinguishing characteristics of the personwarned; 
(iii) The name of the person giving the warning
along with the date and time the warning wasgiven; and 
12
  
 
   Looking at the plain language of HRS § 708-814(1)(b), 
in order for a person to “enter[] or remain[] unlawfully in or 
upon commercial premises,” he or she must fail to obey “a reasonable warning or request to leave” issued in accordance 
with the requirements of the statute. A “reasonable warning or 
request” is then given a specialized meaning that applies only “[f]or the purposes of this paragraph.” HRS § 708-814(1)(b); 
cf. Kaanapali Hillside Homeowners’ Ass’n ex rel. Bd. of Dirs. v. 
Doran, 114 Hawai #i 361, 372, 162 P.3d 1277, 1288 (2007) 
(reasoning that the legislature’s use of the phrase “for the purposes of this section” in defining “planned community association” in HRS § 607-14 indicated that the definition of “planned community association” in HRS § 607-14 is different from the definition of that same phrase in chapter 421J of the 
HRS). Thus, a person’s violation of a “reasonable warning or 
request to leave” means that the person has “enter[ed] or remain[ed] unlawfully in or upon commercial premises” under HRS § 708-814(1)(b), and it does not mean that the person has concurrently entered or remained unlawfully for purposes of other offenses, such as burglary, under Chapter 708 of the ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(iv) The signature of the person giving the
warning, the signature of a witness or
police officer who was present when thewarning was given and, if possible, the
signature of the violator . . . . 
HRS § 708-814 (emphases added). 
13
  
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Hawaii Penal Code that contains the “enters or remains 
unlawfully” element. As such, a “reasonable warning or request” 
is confined within the legal framework created by HRS § 708-
814(1)(b) and is not the same as, or a subset of, a “lawful order” provided by HRS § 708-800. As applied in this case, failure to comply with a “reasonable warning or request” issued under HRS § 708-814(1)(b) would subject the noncomplying person to prosecution under HRS § 708-814(1)(b) (criminal trespass in the second degree), and such failure cannot be made the basis for charging second-degree burglary under HRS § 708-811. 
This interpretation is supported by the nature of the 
information that may be contained by a “reasonable warning or request” issued pursuant to HRS § 708-814(1)(b). 
The trespass 
warning apprises the person to whom it is issued that “a violation of the warning will subject the person to arrest and prosecution for trespassing pursuant to section 708-814(1)(b), and that criminal trespass in the second degree is a petty misdemeanor.” HRS § 708-814(1)(b)(i). By specifying exactly 
the subsection of HRS § 708-814 that the violator of the warning 
will be prosecuted under, it is clear that the trespass warning issued pursuant to HRS § 708-814(1)(b) does not at all contemplate a situation in which its violation would result in the prosecution of the violator for second-degree burglary if, 
14
  
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
for example, a shoplifting is committed during a return to the 
premises. See id. Additionally, HRS § 708-814(1)(b) provides 
that the warning may contain a detailed physical description of the person to whom it is issued, the person’s photograph, the person’s name or any aliases, the name of the person who issued the warning, and the signatures of the person who issued the warning and of a witness or of a police officer. HRS § 708-814(1)(b)(ii)—(iv). Thus, a principal purpose of the HRS § 708-814(1)(b) trespass warning is to make it easier for commercial establishments to identify the person to whom the warning was 
issued so that, when the person reenters or again remains 
unlawfully on the commercial premises covered by the warning, that person can be immediately apprehended and charged with second-degree criminal trespass. 
The plain language of HRS § 708-800 is also 
instructive. 
This statute defines “enter or remain unlawfully” 
without reference to the “reasonable warning or request” that HRS § 708-814(1)(b) authorizes to be issued with respect to 
commercial premises. Similarly, the legislature did not refer 
to the trespass warning in HRS § 708-814(1)(b) as a “lawful order.” This is a further indication that HRS § 708-800 defines the phrase “enter or remain unlawfully” separately and distinctly from HRS § 708-814(1)(b). See Kaanapali Hillside, 
15
  
 
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
114 Hawai #i at 372, 162 P.3d at 1288 (concluding that HRS § 607– 
14’s definition of “planned community association” is different 
from the definition of that phrase in chapter 421J of the HRS since the HRS § 607-14 definition did not reference HRS chapter 421J). 
B. Legislative History and Intent 
The foregoing interpretation is also confirmed by the 
legislative history of HRS § 708-814(1)(b). The predecessor of what is now HRS § 708-814(1)(b) was first added to the second-degree criminal trespass statute in 1979. 1979 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 201, § 1 at 422—23. The House Standing Committee Report noted that the addition was intended to make the unlawful 
entering or remaining upon commercial premises a petty 
misdemeanor instead of just a violation. H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 984, in 1979 House Journal, at 1632—33. The Report noted that, prior to the 1979 amendment, “entering or remaining unlawfully in commercial premises is simple trespass, a violation,” and this made it 
extremely difficult for retailers and shopping centers to
remove from their premises, solicitors and demonstratorswho are harassing or inconveniencing customers or causingloss of sales, because being that such persons can only be
charged with . . . a violation, the police will not place
them under physical arrest without a penal summons beingfirst obtained. 
Id. at 1632—33. Obtaining a penal summons was a time-consuming 
process, and there was nothing the merchant or retailer could 
16
  
 
   In 1998, HRS § 708-814(1)(b) was again amended to 
define “reasonable warning or request” in response to the ICA’s 
decision in  State v. Sadler , 80 Hawai #i 372, 375, 910 P.2d 143, 
147 (App. 1996), which held that HRS § 708-814(1)(b) 
“contemplates a warning or request contemporaneous with a person 
entering or remaining unlawfully on the premises.” 1998 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 146, § 1 at 531; Conf. Com. Rep. No. 81, in 1998 Senate Journal, at 277. This interpretation of HRS § 708-814(1)(b) meant that “in order to convict a person for criminal trespass in the second degree, the person must refuse a warning or request to leave that is made contemporaneously with the person’s entering or remaining on the premises.” Conf. Com. 
Rep. No. 81, in 1998 Senate Journal, at 277. This was viewed by 
the legislature as “burdensome on commercial establishments ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
do. Id. at 1633. Thus, the legislature added what is now HRS § 
708-814(1)(b) to the second-degree criminal trespass statute in 
order to “effectively give retailers a means to remove 
undesirables because it would allow the police to place them under physical arrest.” Id. The legislative history of the 
1979 amendment to HRS § 708-814 never mentioned HRS § 708-800 or intimated that a “reasonable warning or request” issued under HRS § 708-814(1)(b) was intended to satisfy the “lawful order” element of HRS § 708-800. See id. 
17
  
 
   Based on the legislative history of HRS § 708-
814(1)(b), the overarching purpose for the enactment of HRS § 
708-814(1)(b) was to create a discrete legal framework within which commercial premises could be protected from actions 
similar to those committed by King in this case.
9 The statute is 
                     
  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
because owners and operators are unable to meaningfully evict 
trespassers who may interfere with business and commit property 
crimes.” Id. Thus, the 1998 amendment to HRS § 708-814(1)(b) 
was intended to allow commercial establishments to issue a 
“reasonable warning or request” to leave with an effective period of up to one year, the violation of which would permit the prosecution of the violator for criminal trespass in the second degree regardless of whether a contemporaneous warning or request to leave is issued at the time the violator reenters or again remains unlawfully on the commercial premises covered by 
the warning. Id. In addition, the 1998 amendment 
particularized the guidelines on what information may be 
included in the warning. 1998 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 146, § 1 at 531. 
9 The State argues that this court should consider decisions of the
Court of Appeals of Washington in resolving this case. See State v. Kutch,
951 P.2d 1139, 1142 (Wash. Ct. App. 1998); State v. Morris, 210 P.3d 1025
(Wash. Ct. App. 2009). However, Washington’s statutory scheme issignificantly different from the operative statutory scheme in this case. 
In 
fact, Washington does not have a discrete commercial trespass statute that is
similar to HRS § 708-814(1)(b). See generally Wash. Rev. Code Ann. ch.

10   The illogicality in treating a “reasonable warning or request” as
satisfying the “lawful order” requirement of HRS § 708-800 and, thus,
transforming the breach of a warning into a precursor to second-degreeburglary is also demonstrated by examining the nature of the conduct that mayresult in the issuance of a “reasonable warning or request.” Notably, the
issuance of a “reasonable warning or request” under HRS § 708-814(1)(b) is
not contingent on the commission of illegal activity on the commercialpremises; rather, such a warning may be issued for a variety of reasons,including legal conduct, with a view of removing “undesirables” fromcommercial premises. 
See HRS § 708-814(1)(b); H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 984,
in 1979 House Journal, at 1633. For example, a person need not shoplift orharass on the premises in order to allow the commercial premises to issue anHRS § 708-814(1)(b) warning; the person may be excluded from the commercialpremises simply because he or she is an “undesirable[].” See HRS § 708-
814(1)(b); H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 984, in 1979 House Journal, at 1633. In 
instances where the trespass warning is issued for reasons other than prior
illegal conduct, the recipient’s reentry on the commercial premises, ifcoupled with intent to commit a crime against a person or property rights,would be subject to prosecution as a felony offense. Thus, the recipient
could be prosecuted for second-degree burglary because he or she violated a
trespass warning issued based on a previous act that was not illegal. ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
essentially a prophylactic tool “to meaningfully evict 
trespassers who may interfere with business and commit property 
crimes.” Conf. Com Rep. No. 81, 1998 Senate Journal, at 777. 
Nowhere in HRS § 708-814(1)(b)’s legislative history was there any mention of burglary, much less an expression that the legislature intended for a “reasonable warning or request” issued pursuant to HRS § 708-814(1)(b) to satisfy the “lawful order” requirement of HRS § 708-800.
10 Nor was there an 
indication that the legislature intended to create a brand-new precursor to second-degree burglary that commercial property 
owners and law enforcement could use pursuant to their 
discretion. If such a severe escalation were intended by the

9A.52. Thus, the holdings announced by the Washington cases cannot be
meaningfully applied here.

legislature, it would have voiced that result in the language of 
the statute and the legislative history in more definite terms. 
Indeed, in instances where the legislature has intended to 
elevate specified conduct to felonies, it has expressly reflected that intent in the language of the statute. 
See HRS § 
708-831(1)(c) (2014) (theft of aquacultural products); id. § 708-831(1)(d) (2014) (theft of agricultural equipment or products exceeding $100 in value); id. § 708-835.5 (2014) (theft of livestock); 
id.
 § 708-835.7 (2014) (theft of copper).11 
C. The Felony Information is Not Supported by Probable Cause 
Thus, the violation of a “reasonable warning or 
request” issued pursuant to HRS § 708-814(1)(b) is not a “defi[ance] of a lawful order” under HRS § 708-800; hence, the violation of a “reasonable warning or request” cannot be made a vehicle for a second-degree burglary charge under HRS § 708-811. 
11 Construing a “reasonable warning or request” issued pursuant to
HRS § 708-814(1)(b) as satisfying the “lawful order” element of HRS § 708-800
may result in an enforcement regime that could be abused based on thediscretion of owners of commercial premises. For example, there may besituations in which owners of commercial premises would not act immediatelyto arrest a person who violates a prior HRS § 708-814(1)(b) trespass warningand wait for some indicia that the violator of the warning intends to commitshoplifting or another qualifying offense on the premises before effectuatingarrest in order to escalate the offense from second-degree criminal trespass
to second-degree burglary. Such a course of action may prove attractive
given the severity of the punishment for second-degree burglary, i.e., up tofive years of imprisonment, HRS § 706-660(1)(b) (2014), as compared to thepunishment for second-degree criminal trespass, i.e., up to thirty days ofincarceration, HRS § 701-107(4) (2014).

In this case, because the felony information charging King with 
second-degree burglary is based on King’s violation of a prior 
trespass warning issued under HRS § 708-814(1)(b), there is no 
probable cause to support the felony information. At most, King should have been charged with second-degree criminal trespass and fourth-degree theft.

V. CONCLUSION 
Accordingly, we hold that the ICA erred in vacating 
the circuit court’s Order Granting Motion to Dismiss because the circuit court did not err in concluding that there was no 
probable cause to support the felony information. 
Hence, the 
ICA Judgment on Appeal is vacated, and the circuit court’s Order 
Granting Motion to Dismiss is affirmed.

12 King also argues that the rule of lenity should be applied in
construing the statutes involved in this case and that the rule announced in
State v. Modica,  58 Haw. 249, 567 P.2d 420 (1977), prohibits the State from
charging him with a felony offense where his conduct could also be punished
under two misdemeanor offenses. It is unnecessary to address thesecontentions in light of our resolution of this case. King does not challengethe ICA’s resolution of whether his conduct constituted a de minimis 
violation of HRS § 708-811.
