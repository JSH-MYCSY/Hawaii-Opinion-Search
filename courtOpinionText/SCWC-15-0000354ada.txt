OPINION OF THE COURT BY WILSON, J. 
 
  Petitioner/Defendant- Appellant Walter Brown (“Brown”) 
appeals his assault conviction on the grounds that his 
constitutional right to confront an adverse witness was 
violated.  A jury found Brown guilty of one count of assault in 
the second degree under Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes ( “HRS”) § 707-
711(1)(a) (2014); he was sentenced to a term of probation of  Electronically Filed

2 four years with special terms and conditions.  
The Intermediate 
Court of Appeals (“ICA”)  affirmed the Circuit Court of the First 
Circuit’s (“circuit court”) judgment and sentence.  Brown 
contends that his constitutional right to confrontation was 
violated when the circuit court refused to allow cross
-
examination of the complaining witness on two topics relevant to 
her bias, interest, or motive for testifying against him.  
Specifically, Brown argues he should have been permitted to 
cross-examin e the complaining witness regarding her pending 
misdemeanor assault charge arising from  the same incident for 
which he was charged, and her probation status resulting from a 
separate assault charge.   
  Under the constitutions of the United States and the 
State of Hawaiʻ i, the right to confront witnesses is fundamental 
to a fair trial.   U.S. Const. amend. VI; Haw. Const. art. I, § 
14.  When a trial court errs by violating that right, a 
conviction obtained at trial will be upheld only if the error 
was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  In this case, 
Respondent/Plaintiff
-Appellee State of Hawaiʻ i (“the State”) 
concedes that Brown’s constitutional right was violated , but 
contends the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
  
Because the error deprived the jury of information about the 
complaining witness, the exclusion of which might have 
contributed to its decision to convict, see  State v. Acacio, 140 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
3 Hawaiʻi
 92, 98, 398 P.3d 681, 687 (2017), the violation of 
Brown’s right to confrontation  was not harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt. 
I.  BACKGROUND 
  Brown was charged with one count of assault in the 
second degree and one count of assault in the third degree as a 
result of a fight at a restaurant 
in Honolulu on February 20, 
2013, at around 1:30 p.m.  The fight involved Brown, his 
pregnant wife 
(“Wife”) , and his two daughters from a previous 
relationship, one of whom is the complaining witness
 (“CW”) and 
the other of whom 
is CW’s sister (“Sister”) .  CW and Sister were 
at the restaurant to meet their mother (“Mother”) .  The facts 
are disputed.  CW and Sister provided testimony which portrayed 
Brown as the initial aggressor.  Brown and Wife testified that 
Brown acted in self defense and did not initiate the 
altercation.   
A.  State’s Motion in Limine and Defense’s Notice of Intent 
Regarding Prior Bad Acts of CW 
  Prior to trial, the State filed a motion in limine to 
exclude any prior bad acts of its witnesses.  In its motion, the 
State sought an order compelling Brown to disclose “the date, 
location and general nature of any prior bad acts of any of the 
State’s witnesses, if any, that the Defendant intends to 
introduce or refer to during cross- examination of any State’s *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
4 witness or during the direct examination of any defense witness” 
and excluding or limiting such evidence under Hawaiʻi Rules of 
Evidence (
“HRE”) Rules 401, 402, and 403.   
  
Brown similarly filed a pretrial notice of intent to 
introduce evidence of the following five incidents or facts 
relating to CW, members of the public, and members of her 
family:  (1) in 2013, CW was charged with harassment stemming 
from an incident in which she allegedly threw a soda can into a 
driveway where people had gathered for a birthday party while 
yelling insults; (2) in 2010, CW was charged with terroristic 
threatening in the second degree for an incident in which she 
allegedly threatened to kill M other, to which CW later pleaded 
no contest to an amended charge of harassment; (3) on February 
20, 2013, CW was arrested and charged with assault in the third 
degree against Wife and assault in the third degree against 
Brown for conduct arising out of the incident at the restaurant; 
(4) in 2013, CW was arrested and charged with abuse of family or 
household members arising from an incident in which she 
allegedly struck her daughter in the face, to which she later 
pleaded guilty to a charge of assault in the third degree; and 
(5) CW was under misdemeanor probation supervision as a result 
of her plea to the assault in the third degree charge arising 
from the assault of her daughter.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
5   At the pretrial hearing to address the State’s motion 
in limine and Brown’s notice of intent,  the circuit court denied 
Brown’s motions to admit evidence of the two assault charges 
arising out of the incident at the restaurant and to admit 
evidence that CW was on probation.  However, t he circuit court 
granted Brown’s motion s to introduce evidence of the three past 
incidents of violence,  but with a limit ation that defense 
counsel could admit evidence of only two of the three incidents, 
as introducing evidence of all three would be more prejudicial 
than probative.   21
  In denying Brown’s motion to admit the evidence of the 
charges against CW arising out of the incident at the 
restaurant, the circuit court stated that the arrest at the 
restaurant was “irrelevant to whether or not the State can make 
its burden of proof as to the material elements as to the 
defendant.  And so I think that interjecting the fact that the 
complaining witnesses were arrested confuses the jury and 
misleads them in an unfa ir way.”  As to the evidence that CW was 
on probation for the 2013 assault, the circuit court said that 
it had “no probative value whatsoever.”   
                     
1 The Honorable Edward H. Kubo, Jr. presided. 
 
2 That is, the court allowed introduction of evidence relating to 
the 2013 harassment charge, the 2010 harassment conviction, and the 2013 
third degree assault conviction.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
6   
During the first day of trial, defense counsel renewed 
the motion to present evidence that, as a result of the fight at 
the restaurant, CW was arrested and charged with assaulting 
Brown and Wife: 
 [The defense:  ]To not be able to do that presumes or 
gives the jury -- jury does not get the complete story 
because the incident and the circumstances of the case 
arise out of the same facts and circumstances.  I believe 
it’s important for our defense and as well as the jurors to 
know that even though Mr. Brown sits here as the a
ccused, 
there is [sic] cross -complaints.  
 
 For example, if we were to use the defense of mutual 
affray, your Honor, it’s a stronger defense if you were to 
show that she too was charged by the police, your Honor, 
and she too was arrested, your Honor.   And so we believe 
that by not allowing us to go into that, to delve into that 
area, your Honor, restricts the defenses that we may be 
able to assert in this case.  [3
]
 
The circuit court denied the request on the grounds that CW’s 
culpability arising from her actions during the incident was 
irrelevant: 
[The Court:  ]This trial deals with the guilt or innocence 
of Mr. Walter Brown.  The jury will be advised that they 
are to consider this evidence as to him and no one else.  
To bring in any outside information of an
other being 
arrested raises a presumption of guilt of that other person 
which is not being tried in this case at this time.  That’s 
for another court to decide.  What is sufficient is the 
guilt or innocence of the defendant based on the evidence 
and this indictment and two counts, and so this Court will 
deny the defense’s request to bring in evidence of anyone 
else’s arrest because that’s neither here nor there, nor is 
it the purview of the jury to decide the guilt or innocence 
of anyone else.  
 
  
During the second day of the trial, counsel for the 
defense again renewed its position that the defense should be 
                     
3 At trial, the jury was instructed about mutual consent as a 
defense to assault in the third degree.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
7 allowed to question CW regarding the fact that she was charged 
with assaulting Brown and Wife.  Defense counsel argued that the 
evidence “goes to bias, motive, and interest . . . with respect 
to her testimony.”  Defense counsel also noted his understanding 
that the prosecutors had dismissed the case against CW for 
assaulting Brown two days earlier.   The court denied the request 
to reconsider its ruling after expressing concern about creating 
a “mini trial[] within a trial.”    4
B.  Trial, Conviction, Sentence, and New Trial Motion 
  At trial, CW testified that she and Sister planned to 
meet Mother at the restaurant.  CW testified that she and Sister 
saw Brown and Wife as they entered, and that he came toward 
them, grabbed them, and pushed them out of the restaurant’s 
entrance, causing 
CW to fall.  A fight ensued, during which CW 
said Brown punched, kicked, stepped on, and shook her and 
Sister, and she pushed, kicked, and punched Brown in defense of 
herself and Sister.
  At one point, CW  testified, Brown punched 
her underneath the left jaw area.  She denied punching Wife 
during the altercation.  Sister also  testified that Brown 
                     
4 According to Brown’s notice of intent, CW was charged with two 
counts of assault in the third degree for assaulting Brown and Wife shortly 
after the melee at the restaurant that forms the basis of the present case.  
According to defense counsel, the State dismissed CW’s charge for assault in 
the third degree against Brown the day bef ore the start of Brown’s trial, 
leaving her with one outstanding charge of assault in the third degree at the 
time she testified.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
8 grabbed her and CW as they entered the restaurant, that he 
punched CW in the jaw and slammed Sister onto the ground in the 
ensuing fight, and that 
she and CW hit Brown in self- defense.   
  Pursuant to the court’s pre -trial order, CW was 
questioned about two prior incidents of misconduct.  She 
admitted to pleading guilty to third degree assault in the 2013 
case involving her daughter, and to pleading guilty to 
harassment in the 2010 case involving the threats against 
Mother, although she denied threatening to kill her.  She was 
also questioned about an entry she made on Mother’s Facebook 
page regarding Wife and the February 20, 2013 fight in which she 
said “bahahahaha fckn silly girl gave birth.  Now let’s see who 
will laugh.  Talk shit, get hit.  I ain’t sca [r]e[d]. . . .  
Let’s do it again, me and you round two.  Oh wait, round one 
wasn’t finished.”   
  Brown gave a different account of the events with 
regard to who was the initial aggressor and whether he was the 
cause of CW’s jaw injury.  Brown testified that as his family 
was leaving the restaurant, he saw CW and Sister near the door.  
He saw that they were angry, and he tried to block them from 
entering the restaurant and to 
push them backwards out the door.  
He testified that CW slipped and fell numerous times, and that 
the first time she fell, she  hit her head on a table outside the 
restaurant.  At one point, Wife told him CW had hit her.  He *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
9 moved closer to Wife to protect her.  He testified that CW and 
Sister punched and scratched him,  but he denied ever punching, 
choking, slamming to the ground, or stomping on CW or Sister.  
Wife testified that she first saw CW and Sister at the door of 
the restaurant, punching and scratching Brown.  She testified 
that CW punched her in the face, and that at some point after CW 
punched her, CW slipped and fell forward, hitting her head on a 
table.  Wife testified that Brown tried to hold back his 
daughters, but that at no point during the incident did he 
choke, pick up and slam to the ground, stomp on, or punch them.   
  Two eyewitnesses and a physician that treated CW after 
the incident also testified.  The security guard who was working 
at a building directly behind the restaurant
 testified that he 
saw Brown hit CW on the left side of her jaw.  The security 
guard was about 65 to 70 feet away at the time of the hit.  He  
testified that he did not see CW attack Brown in any way.  The 
second witness, the manager of the restaurant,  testified that 
around 1:30 p.m., “all of a sudden there was this big commotion”  
in the restaurant, “ and everybody started running outside [,]” so 
he followed them out and saw Brown attacking CW.  He testified 
that he saw Brown punch CW “in the chin.”  Both the s ecurity 
guard and the manager testified that they did not see the 
initial phase of the encounter 
between Brown and CW.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
10  
 An emergency room physician testified that she treated 
CW shortly after the incident at the restaurant.  She testified 
that she conducted multiple CT scans and concluded that CW had 
suffered a jawbone fracture, somewhere roughly in the left jaw 
area.  CW also had some loose teeth around the jawbone fracture 
and some scrapes and swelling to her face.  The physician did 
not testify as to a possible cause of the fracture.  
  At the end of the State’s case, t he court granted 
Brown’s motion for acquittal on the second count of assault in 
the third degree.  The court found that Sister’s testimony was 
insufficient to prove a prima facie case of third- degree assault 
against her.  The jury found Brown guilty on the first count of 
assault in the second degree; he was sentenced to four years 
probation.   
 
 Brown moved for a new trial on the basis of alleged 
perjured testimony by Mother.  During a hea ring on the new trial 
motion, defense counsel raised the exclusion of the criminal 
charges against CW and her probation status as an additional 
reason to grant a new trial.  The circuit court denied the 
motion.   
C.  Appeal 
  Brown appealed the judgment of conviction to the ICA 
on the basis that the circuit court’s refusal to admit the 
evidence of CW’s pending charges and probation status violated *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
11 his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him, 
and that the court’s constitutional error was n ot harmless 
beyond a reasonable doubt.  
  The ICA affirmed Brown ’s conviction.  State v. Brown , 
No. CAAP-15-0000354, 2017 WL 2829280, at *9 (App. June 30, 2017) 
(mem.).  The ICA held that even if the exclusion of the evidence 
of the charges against CW and her probation status was improper, 
the error was harmless.  
Id. at *8.  It held that sufficient 
evidence was presented at trial for the jury to assess CW’s 
credibility, and that she had been subject to “extensive cross -
examination . . . on subjects including who was the first 
aggressor, CW’s previous convictions for harassment and assault 
against family members, and her relationship with Brown. ”  Id. 
at *9.  Although the ICA recognized that CW’s testimony was 
important to the prosecution’s case, and that there was no  other 
way for the jury to know she had been charged or was on 
probation at the time of trial, it nonetheless held that “[t]he 
testimony of three witnesses other than CW to the assault 
against her as well as the physician establishing the extent of 
her injuries amounted to a very strong, if not overwhelming, 
case.”  Id. 
  Chief Judge Nakamura dissented.  Id.  (Nakamura, C.J., 
dissenting).  He concluded that the pending charge against CW at 
the time of her testimony and the fact that she was on probation *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
12 “created a potential interest, motive, and bias for the CW to 
testify falsely that was different in nature and character than 
revealed by the other evid ence permitted by the Circuit Court.”  
Id.  He identified that interest as “her own self -interest in 
avoiding criminal punishment[ .]”  Id.  He further reasoned that 
“[t]he evidence excluded by the Circuit Court was the only 
viable means for Brown to impeach the CW with her interest, 
motive, and bias to shape her testimony to avoid her own 
criminal punishment.”  Id.  Because the disinterested witnesses 
to the assault did not observe the entire interaction between 
Brown and CW, Chief Judge Nakamura was  unable to conclude that 
the decision to exclude the contested evidence was harmless 
beyond a reasonable doubt.  Id. at *10. 
  Brown filed an application for a writ of certiorari, 
contending that the ICA erred in concluding that his right to 
confrontation was not violated by the circuit court’s exclu sion 
of the evidence about CW.   
II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW  
  A trial court’s ruling on the question of whether 
“proffered evidence is probative of bias, interest or motive is 
reviewed under the right/wrong standard.”  Acacio, 140 Hawaiʻ i at 
98, 398 P.3d at 687 (quoting State v. Balisbisana, 83 Hawaiʻ i 
109, 114, 924 P.2d 1215, 1220 (1996)) . 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
13 III.  DISCUSSION  
A.  The trial court violated Brown’s right to confrontation by 
barring cross-examination as to CW’s pending charges  arising 
from the same incident, as well as to her supervised probation 
status resulting from an earlier assault conviction. 
  Article I, section 14 of the Hawaiʻi Constitution 
provides that “[i ]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall 
enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses 
against the accused[.]”  See also U.S. Const. amend. VI; Davis 
v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 316-317 (1974) (“[T]he exposure of a 
witness’ motivation in te stifying is a proper and important 
function of the constitutionally protected right of cross-
examination.
”).  “[T]he right to confront a witness is not 
satisfied simply by any cross-examination, but instead, . . . 
the cross-examination must be sufficient a nd meaningful. ”  State 
v. Nofoa, 135 Hawai ʻi 220, 231, 349 P.3d 327, 338 (2015) 
(emphases in original).  The defendant’s right to sufficient and 
meaningful cross-examination includes the opportunity to show 
that a witness is unreliable due to bias.
 
[A] criminal defendant states a violation of the 
Confrontation Clause by showing that he was prohibited from 
engaging in otherwise appropriate cross -examination 
designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of 
the witness, and thereby “to expose to the j ury the facts 
from which jurors . . .  could appropriately draw inferences 
relating to the reliability of the witness.”  
 
Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 680 (1986) ( quoting 
Davis, 415 U.S. at 318 ).  “The credibility of a witness may be 
attacked by evidence of bias, interest, or motive[,] ” HRE Rule *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
14 609.1(a), and such evidence “is relevant if it has ‘ any tendency 
to support an inference of the witness’  disposition or tendency, 
consciously or unconsciously, to slant testimony one way or the 
other, from the straight and true. ’”  State v. Acker , 133 Hawaiʻi 
253, 299, 327 P.3d 931, 977 (2014) (emphasis in original) 
(quoting State v. Levell, 128 Hawai ʻi 34, 40, 282 P .3d 576, 582 
(2012)). 
  D efense counsel was forbidden by the court’s order 
from questioning CW on the charges against her arising from the 
same incident and the court precluded the defense from 
introducing evidence that she was on probation for the charge of 
assault in the third degree.  Both matters were relevant to her 
bias or motive.  “[G]iving a defendant ‘considerable latitude’ 
during cross-examination of the complaining witness is not 
sufficient if the defendant is deprived of an opportunity to 
present evidence about the source of the comp laining witness’s 
potential bias or motive.”  Acacio, 140 
Hawaiʻi at 101, 398 P.3d 
at 690 (quoting Levell , 128 Hawaiʻi at 41, 282 P.3d at 583). 
  Exclusion of the criminal charges against CW and the 
fact that CW was on probation deprived the jury of evidence that 
she had an interest
 to shape her testimony against Brown to 
avoid punishment and to prevent the possible revocation of her 
probation.  The jury thus lacked “sufficient information from 
which to make an informed appraisal of the complainant’s motives *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
15 and bias” as to her testimony.  
Levell, 128 Hawai ʻi at 40, 282 
P.3d at 582 (brackets omitted) 
(quoting State v. Marcos, 106 
Hawai
ʻi 116, 121, 102 P.3d 360, 365 (2004)).  In short, Brown was 
not afforded the cross-examination to which he was 
constitutionally entitled to confront CW about her motives or 
bias favoring the prosecution.  5
  Thus, the circuit court erred when it concluded that 
evidence that CW was arrested and charged with crimes related to 
the same incident was  irrelevant, confusing , and misleading; 
similarly, the conclusion that evidence of CW’s probation had 
“no probative value whatsoever” was error.   
B.  The trial court’s violation of Brown’s right to 
confrontation was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
  Having held that Brown’s constitutional right was 
violated, we next determine whether the constitutional error was 
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  In his opening brief, Brown 
argued that the error was not harmless because, “except for the 
testimonies of [Brown] and [Wife], there was no other evidence 
                     
5 We note that t he State conceded at oral argument that “cross -
examination on CW’s probation status, and her charges -- assault charges 
stemming from this incident should have been allowed.  Not doing so was 
error.”  Oral Argument, State v. Brown  (SCWC-15-0000354) at 28:1 1-28:23, 
http://oaoa.hawaii.gov/jud/oa/18/SCOA_020718_SCWC_15_354.mp3.  However, the 
State contended that this error was harmless because there was “independent 
evidence to establish the elements of the offense in this case.”  Oral 
Argument at 28:27 -28:32. *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
16 with which to impeach [CW’s] testimony” regarding the cause of 
her jawbone fracture.   
 
 A trial court’s denial of a defendant’s constitutional 
right to impeach a witness for bias, motive,  or interest is  
subject to the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard.  
Acacio, 140 Hawai ʻi at 98, 398 P.3d at 687.  This standard is 
applied by “examin[ing] the record and determin[ing] whether 
there is a reasonable possibility that the error complained of 
might have contributed to the conviction.”  Id.  Factors 
determinative of whether a violation of the constitutional right 
to impeach might have contributed to the conviction include: 
“the importance of the witness’ testimony  in the prosecution’s 
case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or 
absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony 
of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-
examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall 
strength of the prosecution’s case.”  
Levell, 128 Hawaiʻi at 42, 
282 P.3d at 584 (quoting Balisbisana, 83 Hawaiʻ i  at 117, 924 P.2d 
at 1223). 
  Here, there is a reasonable possibility that the 
circuit court’s constitutional error might have contributed to 
Brown’s conviction.  As an eyewitness to the entire event and 
the complaining witness in the case, CW was the most important 
witness for the prosecution.  She gave a firsthand account of *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
17 the entire incident, testifying about specific acts that met the 
elements of assault.  Brown was not permitted to cross
-examine 
CW about the criminal charges she faced and her 
probation status 
that placed CW in immediate legal jeopardy and possibly gave the 
State leverage over her testimony.  Were she convicted of the 
third degree assault charge against Wife and had her probation 
from her previous third degree assault charge been revoked, CW 
could have been sentenced to up to two years in prison.  
See HRS 
§§ 707-712(2), 706-663, 706- 625(3), (5) (2014).  On the other 
hand, CW may have believed that providing testimony at trial 
that Brown was the first aggressor would lessen the likelihood 
the prosecution would pursue the pending charge against her.
  
Impeachment of such an important witness might  have affected the 
jury’s decision as to whether to credit Brown’s assertion of 
self-defense.  Thus, notwithstanding the evidence submitted by 
the State, it cannot be concluded beyond a reasonable doubt 
that 
the circuit court’s erroneous decision to preclude Brown from 
impeaching CW for bias, interest, or motive did not contribute 
to Brown’s conviction .  The error was not harmless.   6
  The Dissent concludes that the constitutional error
was rendered harmless beyond a reasonable doubt by the 
corroborative testimony of the two eyewitnesses and the  
                     
6 Per defense counsel, one of the charges against CW had already 
been dismissed shortly before the Brown’s trial.   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
18 defense’s “otherwise extensive cross -examination of CW[.]”  
Dissent at 11.  Its analysis is similar to that of the ICA, 
which found that the State presented “a very strong, if not 
overwhelming, case” that Brown committed assault.  Brown, 2017 
WL 2829280, at *9.  However, the ultimate question is whether 
the erroneous exclusion of additional evidence could have 
reasonably affected the jury’s verdict.   
  The two eyewitnesses testified that they did not 
witness the entire interaction between Brown and CW.   The 
security guard testified that he was 65 to 70 feet away from the 
fight, and the manager testified that the scene was a “big 
commotion” and that he ran back inside at one point to call th e 
police.  In contrast, Brown and Wife offered testimony that 
directly contradicted CW’s explanation of the cause of injury, 
contending that she slipped and hit her head on a table.  
Evidence that cast doubt on CW’s credibility may have affected 
the jury’s conclusion as to her description of the events.  The 
jury was deprived of strongly probative evidence 
relating to  its 
choice between the conflicting accounts of how CW’s injur y was 
caused.  While CW was cross-examined about her relationship with 7
                     
7 The Dissent notes that the security guard testified that he 
observed “the events immediately preceding the punch” and that CW had not 
attacked Brown.  Dissent at 16 n.2.  However, the security guard did not 
witness the part of the fight during which, accor ding to Brown’s account, CW 
slipped and hit her head on a table.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***  
19 Brown and Wife and her propensity for violence, the court 
prevented the defense from eliciting 
evidence about her interest 
in avoiding future criminal prosecution and punishment.  Nothing 
in CW’s testimony indicated that the State had leverage over her 
in the form of pending charges or the ability to revoke her 
probation.  And as the Dissent recognizes, “no other witness 
testified as to CW’s misdemeanor probation status or that she 
had also been charged with assault stemming from the same 
incident.”  Dissen t at 11.  Thus, no other evidence conveyed the 
degree of CW’s possible interest in slanting or falsifying her 
testimony to gain favor with the prosecution and to avoid 
immediate legal jeopardy, and  accordingly “the jury did not have 
sufficient information from which to make an informed appraisal 
of the CW’s motive .”  Acacio , 140 Hawaiʻi at 101, 398 P.3d at 
690.  Notwithstanding t he State’s evidence  against Brown, the 
conclusion cannot be reached beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
unconstitutional exclusion of evidence about CW’s “significant 
incentive to curry favor with the State[,]” Birano v. State, 143 
Hawaiʻi 163, 192, 426 P.3d 387, 416 (2018), did not contribute to 
the jury’s decision to convict.

Conviction and Probation Sentence of the Circuit Court of the *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
