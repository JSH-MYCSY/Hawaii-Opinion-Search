IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAIʻ I 
JAN MICHAEL WEINBERG, Respondent/Plaintiff-Appellee, 
 
vs. 
 
BRENDA IRENE DICKSON-WEINBERG, Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant. 
CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS 
(CAAP-15-0000362; FC-D NO. 04-1-3936) 
ORDER DISMISSING PETITIONER/PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT’S
“RESPONSE TO THE SUPREME COURT RULING” 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ., and
Circuit Judge Chang, in place of McKenna, J., recused) 
Petitioner/Defendant-Appellant filed a “Response to 
the Supreme Court Ruling,” on August 26, 2016, which we review 
as a motion for reconsideration or, in the alternative, for an 
extension of time to file an application for writ of certiorari.1 
Upon consideration of this filing, the documents attached thereto and submitted in support thereof, and the record, to the 
1 Although Petitioner filed her certiorari application and 
“Response to the Supreme Court Ruling” pro se, Leslie C. Maharaj remained her
counsel of record. See  Hawaiʻi Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 50 
(providing the procedures for the appropriate withdrawal or discharge of 
appellate counsel subject to the discretion of the court).  
 
    
  
  DATED: Honolulu, Hawai i, September 14, 2016. 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 extent Petitioner challenges the dismissal of her application 
for writ of certiorari, it is untimely. See Hawaiʻ i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 40(a)(1) (providing that a 
motion for reconsideration may be filed by a party only within 
ten days after the filing of the dispositional order). Further, 
to the extent Petitioner seeks an extension of time to file her 
application for writ of certiorari, the request is also 
untimely. See HRAP Rule 40.1(a)(2)-(4) (providing 30 days for a 
party to extend the time to file an application for a writ of 
certiorari and that “[a]n untimely request shall not extend the 
time”). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion is dismissed. 
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that the appellate clerk 
shall forward a copy of this order to petitioner at her last known mailing address provided in the record of this case.
