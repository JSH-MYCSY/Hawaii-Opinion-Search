 1  “‘Extended coverage’ means any recording or broadcasting of 
proceedings through the use of television, radio, photographic, or recording 
equipment by the media or on behalf of educational institutions.” RSCH Rule 
5.1(c)(2) (2014).  
  
   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
extended coverage can be appealed. We hold that where the 
request for extended coverage originates from a member of the 
media, review of a district court’s decision regarding that 
request is limited to the procedure set forth in the Rules of 
the Supreme Court of  the State of Hawai  i (RSCH) Rule 5.1(f)(8).   
Relatedly, there is also no independent statutory authority that 
would allow the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) to review  
the district court’s decision.  
I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
A. District Court Proceedings 
On April 29, 2014, Hawaii News Now (HNN) submitted an 
application for extended coverage1 to the District Court of the 
First Circuit (district court) for the criminal case, State v. 
Nilsawit, No. 1DCW– 14–0001187 (Application for Extended 
Coverage). The district court granted HNN’s Application for 
Extended Coverage on the same day.2 Among the circumstances 
surrounding the criminal case was the controversy regarding the 
Honolulu Police Department ’s then practice of allowing 
undercover police officers to engage in sexual conduct with 
2 The Honorable Russel S. Nagata presided.

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
persons selling sexual services  during sting operations.  On May 
16, 2014, the State submitted its objection to HNN’s Application 
for Extended Coverage  (First Objection), which sought to 
prohibit HNN from televising or publishing a picture of the face or likeness of Officer Paul Goo, the officer involved in the 
events that culminated in the arrest of  Siriporn Nilsawit.  HNN 
thereafter submitted a Renewed Application for Extended Coverage  
(Renewed Application) on October 20, 2014. HNN requested that the district court deny any objection from a   party in the 
criminal case and affirm  the previously issued   order that 
allowed HNN the right to full and complete coverage of the 
criminal proceeding, including the filming, televising, and 
photographing of Officer Goo and Nilsawit.    
Nilsawit filed a Reply to the Renewed Application, 
which sought to preclude coverage of Nilsawit’s face. 
Nilsawit’s 
Reply did not object to HNN’s request to televise and 
publish Officer Goo ’s face. The State filed its Objection to 
the Renewed Application (Second Objection), which expanded upon 
the First Objection and requested that the faces of Officers 
Goo, Caesar Lazaro, Ilso Pratt, Herbert Soria, and Zachary 
Plevel be excluded from HNN’s coverage. HNN submitted its Reply 
in Support of the Renewed Application, contending that neither

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
the State and Nilsawit provided no evidence in support of their 
objections to HNN’s Renewed Application.  
A hearing on HNN’ s Renewed Application took place on 
November 14, 2014, and on that day, the district court issued 
its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law for Hawaii News 
Now’s Application for Extended Coverage and Order (FOF/COL).  
The court cited RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(3) and (5),3 which enumerates 
3 RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(3) provides the following: 
(3) A judge shall grant requests for extended coverage 
or extended audio coverage of a proceeding unless, by a 
preponderance of the evidence, good cause is found to 
prohibit such coverage. In situations where the judge has 
found good cause to prohibit extended coverage or extended 
audio coverage, the judge may permit extended coverage or extended audio coverage of only a portion or portions of 
the proceeding. 
RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(3) (2014). 
RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(5) states as follows: 
(5) A presumption of good cause shall exist in the following 
circumstances: 
(i) the proceeding is for the purpose of determining 
the admissibility of evidence; or 
(ii) testimony regarding trade secrets is being 
received; or 
(iii) testimony of child witnesses is being received; 
or 
(iv) testimony of a complaining witness in a 
prosecution for any sexual offense under Part V of the 
Hawaii Penal Code is being received; or 
(v) a witness would be put in substantial jeopardy of 
serious bodily injury; or 
(continued . . .)

 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
instances in which a presumption of good cause exists for not 
allowing extended coverage. The district court found that 
Officers Goo, Lazaro and Plevel were involved in ongoing 
undercover investigations such that, by a preponderance of the 
evidence, good cause existed to prohibit the extended coverage 
requested. Consequently, the court prohibited HNN from 
televising or publishing the faces or likenesses of Officers 
Goo, Lazaro, and Plevel, unless the faces of the officers were 
blurred or otherwise made indistinguishable. Finally, the 
district court determined that HNN could publish the names of 
witnesses in the criminal case, including the names of Officers 
Goo, Lazaro, and Plevel. 
On January 21, 2015, relying on RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(9),4 
HNN filed a motion for lea ve to appeal the district court’ s 
FOF/COL to the ICA. The district court denied HNN’ s motion 
(Order Denying Leave to Appeal), reasoning that HNN exceeded the 
(. . . continued) 
(vi) testimony of undercover law enforcement agents 
who are involved in other ongoing undercover 
investigations is being received. 
RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(5) (2014). 
4 “A party may seek appellate review of an order regarding extended 
coverage, including any such order issued by the administrative judge, 
pursuant to the procedures available for review of other interlocutory 
orders, but immediate appellate review of such an order shall not be 
available as a matter of right.” RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(9) (2014). 
5
  
 
 
  
   
   
  
  HNN appealed  to the ICA from the FOF/COL and the Order 
Denying Leave to Appeal.   In its opening  brief, HNN contended 
that the district court’ s factual findings provided an 
insufficient basis for limiting HNN’s extended coverage “ because 
they include no basis from which the State could have overcome 
the presumption in favor of extended coverage contained in RSCH  
Rule 5.1(f)(3).”   HNN also asserted that the Order Denying Leave 
to Appeal was erroneous because it was based on HNN’s decision 
not to seek administrative review of the FOF/COL, a course of 
                                                        
   
 
 The media or educational institution or any party may 
obtain review of an order regarding extended coverage by 
filing a motion for review addressed to the appropriate administrative judge, who shall have full power to vacate 
and modify the order. A motion for review shall be filed 
no later than 5 days after the filing of the order 
regarding coverage. In disposing of the motion for  review 
the administrative judge shall comply with subdivision 
(f)(2) of this Rule. The record of the proceeding before 
the administrative judge shall be made part of the record 
of the underlying proceeding for which coverage is sought. 
Where a request for extended coverage is initially referred 
to an administrative judge and ruled upon, there shall be no further review.  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
five-day period within which a motion for review of an order 
regarding coverage must be filed under RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(8).5 The 
district court entered its Notice of Entry of Judgment And/Or 
Order in the criminal case on April 1, 2015.

   ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
action that HNN argued did not affect its right to appeal 
pursuant to RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(9). 
The State, in its answering brief, contended that the 
appeal was already moot because Nilsawit pleaded no contest to 
the charge, and consequently, there was not and there never will 
be a trial for which HNN could provide extended coverage.  The 
State argued that the issue does not fall under the “capable of 
repetition, yet evading review” exception to the mootness 
doctrine because HNN could have filed (as it did in a previous 
case) a petition for a writ of prohibition and/or mandamus to 
this court if it wanted to appeal the FOF/COL. On the merits, 
the State contended that the evidence it adduced showed that a 
presumption of good cause pursuant to RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(5) 
existed to prohibit the publication of the pictures of the 
undercover officers. In its reply brief, HNN contended that its 
appeal satisfied the requirements of both the “capable of 
repetition, yet evading review” and public interest exceptions 
to the mootness doctrine. 
The ICA resolved the appeal on jurisdictional grounds, 
concluding that RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(8) is the exclusive procedure 
through which “[t]he media or educational institution ” could 
seek “review of a court’s order regarding a request for extended

coverage.” State v. Nilsawit , 137 Hawai i 214, 216, 367 P.3d 
708, 710 (App. 2016) (quoting RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(8)). The ICA 
held that the alternative avenue provided by RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(9) was not available to HNN because it is not a “party” pursuant to 
RSCH Rule 5.1(c)(7), which defines “party” as “a named litigant of record who has appeared in the case.” Id. (quoting RSCH Rule 
5.1(c)(7)). Hence, the ICA concluded that “HNN was required to 
comply with the procedures under RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(8) in order to 
appeal a court’s order on extended coverage.” Id. Because HNN 
failed to file its motion 
for review within the five-day period 
to the administrative judge of the district court as required 
under RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(8), the ICA dismissed HNN’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. 
In its application for writ of certiorari 
to this 
court, HNN contends that it was not bound by RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(8) 
because it is a “party” to this case , thereby allowing HNN to 
proceed under RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(9).6 In support of its assertion 
that it is a party, HNN maintains that it litigated its 
Application for Extended Coverage and the Renewed Application against the State and Nilsawit, it participated in the district

court proceedings through its counsel, and it was frequently 
identified as a party in various documents in the record and in 
notices filed by the district court. As an additional basis for 
appellate review, HNN argues that the ICA has jurisdiction over 
its appeal pursuant to HRS § 641-1 (1993 & Supp. 2004) and that 
the ICA erred by completely ignoring HRS § 641-1 as a basis for 
its jurisdiction. On the merits, HNN makes the same arguments 
it made in the ICA. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
“The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law 
that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard. ” Lingle 
v. Haw. Gov’t Emps. Ass’n, 107 Hawai i 178, 182—83, 111 P.3d 587, 
591—92 (2005).  Construction of rules promulgated by this court 
is also reviewed de novo. Barcai v. Betwee,
 98 Hawai i 470, 479, 
50 P.3d 946, 955 (2002)
. 
III. DISCUSSION  
The central issue on certiorari is whether the ICA has 
jurisdiction over HNN’s appeal. HNN proffers two alternate 
theories supporting the ICA’ s jurisdiction: (1) HNN has the 
right to appeal pursuant to RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(9), and (2) HRS § 
641-1 provides an independent source of jurisdiction to the ICA.  
9
  
 
 
     
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(9) (emphasis added). The plain language of 
RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(9) limits the availability of interlocutory 
appeal to parties. Hence, HNN could utilize the procedure 
contained in RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(9) only if it is a party. RSCH 
Rule 5.1(c)(7) defines a “party” as “ a named litigant of record 
who has appeared in the case .” Contrary to HNN’s assertion, HNN 
is not a named litigant of record; only the State and Nilsawit 
are. The fact that HNN’s attorney appeared on its behalf for the limited purpose of litigating HNN’s Application for Extended 
Coverage; that HNN was identified in several pleadings, orders, 
and notices; that HNN was served online filing notices; and that 
the record referred to HNN as a “party” numerous times did not 
transform HNN into a named litigant of record because, 
essentially, this is a criminal case by the State against ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
A. Appellate Rights Pursuant to RSCH Rule 5.1 
HNN argues that it was not limited to the procedure 
provided by RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(8) in seeking appellate review of 
the FOF/COL and that RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(9) is an available 
alternative in obtaining appellate review.  RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(9) 
provides as follows: 
A party may seek appellate review of an order regarding 
extended coverage, including any such order issued by the 
administrative judge, pursuant to the procedures available 
for review of other interlocutory orders, but immediate 
appellate review of such an order shall not be available as a matter of right.

  ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Nilsawit, the only two named litigants of record under RSCH Rule 
5.1(c)(7). Indeed, the caption of the case for the two orders 
that HNN appealed to the ICA includes only the State and 
7Nilsawit.
This conclusion is supported by the fact that “media” 
is defined separately by the RSCH as “any news gathering or 
reporting agencies and the individual persons involved, and 
includes newspapers, radio, television, radio and television 
networks, news services, magazines, trade papers, in-house 
publications, professional journals, or other news reporting or 
news gathering agencies whose function it is to inform the 
public or some segment thereof.” RSCH Rule 5.1(c)(10) (2014). 
Based on this definition, it is clear that HNN fits the 
definition of “media” and not the definition of a “party,” as 
HNN is a news gathering or reporting agency.  Hence, because HNN 
is not a party under RSCH Rule 5.1(c)(7), it was not authorized 
to utilize the procedure provided by RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(9) in seeking an interlocutory appeal. 
7 Although RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(4) provides that members of the media 
have “standing to be heard and . . . present evidence” in ins tances where a 
hearing is necessitated by an order of the court or a party’s objection to an 
application for extended coverage, even in such instances the members of the 
media are not granted party status.  RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(4) (2014). 
11
  
 
 
   HNN, as a member of the media, c ould have timely 
sought administrative review of the FOF/COL  pursuant to RSCH  
Rule 5.1(f)(8), which  states as follows:  
 
   
 
  
 
     
    
  
   
 
                                                        
  
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
The media  or educational institution or any party may 
obtain review  of an order regarding extended coverage by 
filing a motion for review addressed to the appropriate 
administrative judge, who shall have full power to vacate 
and modify the order.  A motion for review shall be filed 
no later than 5 days after the filing of  the order 
regarding coverage .
  In disposing of the motion for review 
the administrative judge shall comply with subdivision 
(f)(2) of this Rule.  The record of the proceeding before 
the administrative judge shall be made part of the record of the underlying proceeding for which coverage is sought.  
Where a request for extended coverage is initially referred to an administrative judge and ruled upon, there shall be 
no further review .   
RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(8) (emphases added). However, HNN did not 
utilize the procedure prescribed by RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(8) for 
obtaining administrative review of the FOF/COL. Instead, HNN 
filed a motion for leave to appeal the FOF/COL pursuant to RSCH 
Rule 5.1(f)(9), which, as discussed, HNN was not authorized to 
do. 
B. Jurisdiction Under HRS § 641-1 
HNN also contends that the ICA has jurisdiction over 
this appeal pursuant to HRS § 641-1.8 The relevant portions of 
this statute provide as follows: 
8 The ICA concluded that it lacked jurisdiction without discussing 
HNN’s assertion, in its statement of jurisdiction, that HRS § 641 -1 provides 
the ICA with jurisdiction to review the FOF/COL and the Order Denying Leave 
to Appeal. 
12
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
  As a general matter, HRS § 641-1 applies only if an 
appeal involves a civil matter. This court has previously 
construed “civil” to mean “noncriminal” unless there is an 
indication that the legislature has given that word a different 
meaning. See Application of Sanborn , 57 Haw. 585, 588  n.1, 562 
P.2d 771, 773 n.1 (1977) . Black’s Law Dictionary defines 
“civil” as “[o]f, relating to, or involving private rights and 
remedies that are sought by action or suit, as distinct from ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
(a)
 Appeals shall be allowed in civil matters  from 
all final judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and 
district courts  
and the land court to the intermediate 
appellate court, subject to chapter 602. 
(b)
 Upon application made within the time provided by 
the rules of court, an appeal in a  civil matter may be 
allowed by a circuit court in its discretion from an order 
denying a motion to dismiss or from any interlocutory 
judgment, order, or decree whenever the circuit court may 
think the same advisable for the speedy termination of litigation before it. 
The refusal of the circuit court to 
allow an appeal from an interlocutory judgment, order, or decree shall not be reviewable by any other court. 
HRS § 641-1 (emphases added).  HNN’s argument fails for three 
reasons: (1) it is not clear whether HNN’s appeal involves a 
“civil matter” within the meaning of HRS § 641 -1; (2) even 
assuming that HNN’s appeal is a “civil matter,” the FOF/COL is 
not a final appealable judgment, order, or decree under this 
provision as required by HRS § 641-1(a); and (3) HRS § 641-1(b) 
does not allow interlocutory appeals of civil matters 
originating from the district court.

criminal proceedings .” Civil, Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 
2014)
. Black’s defines “civil action” as “[a] n action brought 
to enforce, redress, or protect a private or civil right; a 
noncriminal litigation .” Action, 
Black’s, supra. 
Whether HNN’s request for extended coverage --the 
subject of the appeal to the ICA--is a civil matter raises a 
significant question. On the one hand, the dispute in this 
appeal is between HNN and the parties in the underlying criminal 
case, and the subject matter of the dispute--the scope of HNN’s 
extended coverage--is noncriminal; to this extent, it is 
arguably a civil matter. On the other hand, the matter raised 
by this appeal is part and parcel of the underlying criminal 
case on which HNN wishes to gain extended coverage, and the 
extended coverage has at least the potential to affect matters 
in the criminal action.  In this way, this case may not be 
entirely “civil” in charac ter. See Civil , Black’s, supra. In 
any event, whether HNN’s request for extended coverage is a 
“civil matter” need not be resolved because, even assuming that it is, HNN still cannot appeal from the FOF/COL under any of the 
subsections of HRS § 641-1. 
The FOF/COL cannot be appealed under HRS § 641-1(a) 
because it is not “final” as required by that subsection. RSCH 
Rule 5.1(f)(9) specifies that “an order regarding extended 
14
  
 
 
   In addition, assuming that  HNN’s request for extended 
coverage is a civil matter, the FOF/COL, which, as discussed,  is 
interlocutory in nature, is not appealable  under HRS § 641-1(b).  
The plain language of HRS § 641-1(b) does not appear to permit 
an appeal from a district court’s  interlocutory order arising 
from a civil matter; the statute  specifically limits  appeals 
from a civil interlocutory judgment, order, or decree to those  
rendered by the circuit court.   HRS § 641-1(b) (“[A]n appeal in 
a civil matter may be allowed by a circuit court in its 
discretion from an order denying a motion to dismiss or from any 
interlocutory judgment, order, or decree  whenever the circuit 
court may think the same advisable for the speedy termination of 
litigation before it. ” (Emphases added)) .   Hence, assuming that 
this appeal involves a  district court civil matter under HRS § ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
coverage” is an interlocutory order. See  RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(9)  
(stating that “[a]  party may seek appellate review of an order 
regarding extended coverage, including any such order issued by the administrative judge, pursuant to the procedures available 
for review of other interlocutory orders ”  (emphasis added)).   
Therefore, even assuming that HNN’s request for extended coverage is a civil matter, the FOF/COL  that resolved the case   
cannot be appealed to the ICA as a matter of right pursuant to 
 HRS § 641-1(a).

641-1(b), the ICA would still not have jurisdiction over HNN’s 
appeal because, at the outset, the FOF/COL in this case does not 
qualify for interlocutory appeal pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b).9 
C.	 The Jurisdictional Analysis of the ICA and the District 
Court is Based on an Incorrect Reading of RSCH Rule 5.1 
On appeal, the ICA held that it lacked appellate 
jurisdiction over the case because HNN did not follow RSCH Rule 
5.1(f)(8). This holding implies that, had HNN complied with 
RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(8), the ICA would have had jurisdiction to 
review the FOF/COL and the Order Denying Leave to Appeal.

134-35, 552 P.2d 75, 76 (1976) (“There is, however, no statutory warrant for 
interlocutory appeals in criminal cases from district courts.”). These cases 
involved the interpretation of HRS § 641 -17, which, at the time when the 
cases were decided, provided as follows:  
Upon application made within the time provided by the rules of court, 
an appeal in a criminal matter may be allowed to 
a defendant from the circuit court  to the supreme court 
from a decision denying a motion to dismiss or from other 
interlocutory orders, decisions or judgments, whenever the 
judge in his discretion may think the same advisable for a more speedy termination of the case. The refusal of the 
judge to allow an interlocutory appeal to the supreme court 
shall not be reviewable by any other court.  
HRS § 641- 17 (Supp. 1975) (emphasis added).  It is noted that the State, in a 
district court criminal case, is authorized to file an interlocutory appeal 
in specified instances that do not include an appeal from an order involving 
extended coverage. HRS § 641 -13 (Supp. 2006).

to comply with the procedures under RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(8) in order 
to appeal a court’s order on extended coverage.”). However, 
RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(8) does not by its own terms provide an avenue 
for appeal following the administrative judge’s review, and in 
fact it provides that if the extended coverage decision was 
initially referred to and ruled upon by the administrative 
judge, then “there shall be no further review ” of that decision. 
RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(8). The limitation that inheres in RSCH Rule 
5.1(f)(8) is qualified only to the extent that RSCH Rule 
5.1(f)(9) allows a party 
to file a motion for leave to appeal 
from an order issued by an administrative judge. RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(9). Thus, in cases where a member of the media requests 
administrative review, the plain language of subsections (f)(8) 
and (f)(9) of RSCH Rule 5.1 does not allow further appeal to the 
ICA or to this court of the administrative judge’s ruling. 
See  
Kaho
ohanohano v. Dep’t of Human Servs. , 117 Hawai i 262, 288, 178 
P.3d 538, 564 (2008) (stating that the fundamental starting 
point in statutory interpretation is the language of the statute 
itself). Accordingly, while the ICA was correct in holding that it lacked appellate jurisdiction, it erred in implying that its 
lack of jurisdiction stems from HNN’s failure to follow the 
procedure under RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(8). The ICA would still have

  The ICA’s prono uncement that it had no appellate 
jurisdiction, and its underlying reasoning, appears to encompass 
the Order Denying Leave to Appeal.   However, the reason for the 
ICA’s lack of jurisdiction over the Order Denying Leave to 
Appeal is not because of HNN's noncompliance  with RSCH Rule 
5.1(f)(8); it is simply because such an order is not appealable.  
See generally  HRS § 641-1(b) (“The refusal of the circuit court 
to allow an appeal from an interlocutory judgment, order, or 
decree shall not be reviewable by an y other court.”); HRS § 641-
17 (“The refusal of the judge to allow an interlocutory appeal 
to the appellate court shall not be reviewable by any other 
court.”).   Hence, even if HNN followed RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(8), the 
Order Denying Leave to Appeal would still  not be appealable.                
 ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
had no jurisdiction over HNN’s appeal even if HNN strictly 
complied with RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(8) because this subsection does 
not provide an independent authority to appeal an administrative 
judge’s decision and categorically proscribes nonparties from 
seeking further review of such a decision. Thus, in that 
situation, HNN would be precluded from seeking leave to appeal 
pursuant to RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(9) as it is not a party and 
because, as discussed supra, there is no statutory authority 
that would have allowed HNN to appeal to the ICA from an 
interlocutory order issued by the district court. 
18
  
 
 
   The district court  also erred in the reasons it 
provided in denying HNN’s motion for leave to appeal filed 
pursuant to RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(9). Contrary to the district 
court’s reasoning, HNN’s motion for leave to appeal should have 
been denied not because  “HNN exceeded the five (5) day period to 
file a motion for review of an order regarding coverage in 
violation of Rule 5.1(f)(8).”   Instead,  HNN was precluded from   
proceeding under RSCH 5.1(f)(9) because it was not a party  and 
there is no statutory right to appeal from an interlocutory judgment, order, or decree entered by t  he district court in 
civil cases, 
see  HRS  § 641-1(b), and,  similarly, in criminal  
cases (except by the State in prescribed instances), see supra   
note 9; HRS §§ 641-13, 641-17.   Thus, even assuming that HNN  had 
adhered to the administrative review process outlined in RSCH 
Rule 5.1(f)(8), the district court would still have had to deny 
HNN’s motion for leave to appeal filed pursuant to RSCH Rule 
5.1(f)(9).  
 
   
 
 
  
    ***FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI ʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER*** 
Based on the foregoing, HNN does not have 
a right to 
appeal, pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a), from the district court’s FOF/COL. Nor can HNN seek leave to appeal to the ICA pursuant 
to RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(9) because it is not a party and, under HRS 
§§ 641-1(b), 641-13, and 641-17, appeals from all civil 
interlocutory orders and from criminal interlocutory orders

entered by the district court are not permitted, except as noted 
supra. Thus, HNN’s only opportunity for review of the FOF/COL 
would have been to seek administrative review pursuant to RSCH 
Rule 5.1(f)(8).10 
D. Media Entities Have Alternative Avenues to Seek Redress 
HNN and the media, under circumstances similar to this 
case, may commence an original proceeding in this court by 
filing an application for a writ of mandamus and/or prohibition. 
In cases where a court enters an order that “ is not immediately 
appealable or related to the merits ” of the underlying 
proceeding--circumstances that appear to be present in this 
case--this court has intimated that “mandamus is the appropriate 
remedy.” Kema v. Gaddis , 91 Hawai i 200, 204 —05, 982 P.2d 334, 
338—39 (1999); see State v. Hamili, 87 Hawai i 102, 104, 952 P.2d 
390, 392 (1998) (stating that where there is no right to appeal, a mandamus petition is the appropriate vehicle for challenging a 
10 Notably, HRS § 602 -4 (1993) establishes this court’s inherent 
authority to control litigation before it. HRS § 602 -4 states that “[t]he 
supreme court shall have the general superintendence of all courts of 
inferior jurisdiction to prevent and correct errors and abuses therein where 
no other remedy is expressly provided by law.” HRS § 602 -4; 
see  State v. Ui, 
66 Haw. 366, 370, 663 P.2d 
630, 633 (1983) (stating that the court may 
exercise its supervisory power under HRS § 602 -4 but declining to do so 
because the circuit court did not err in interpreting the statute involved); 
see, e.g.,  Gannett Pac. Corp. v. Richardson , 59 Haw. 224, 227, 580 P.2d 49, 
53  (1978) (trial court’s closure of hearing to public necessitated this 
court’s exercise of its supervisory power). HNN does not request this court 
to exercise its supervisory power in this case, and thus, the potential 
application of this statute need not be reached.

trial court’s action s alleged to have been made without 
statutory authority); e.g., Oahu Publ’ ns Inc. v. Ahn, 133 Hawai i 
482, 488, 331 P.3d 460  , 466 (2014) (using   writs of mandamus and 
prohibition as vehicles  to challenge the circuit court’s order 
sealing portions of court proceedings and closing the courtroom 
to the public).    Accordingly, HNN and the media  at large are not  
deprived of means to obtain redress, as they   may apply for  a 
writ of prohibition and/or  mandamus in challenging a trial 
11 court’s order regarding extended coverage.  
IV. CONCLUSION 
We hold that
, other than by applying for an 
extraordinary writ to this court, the only avenue through which HNN could have sought review of the district court’s FOF/COL was 
by filing a motion for review addressed to the appropriate administrative judge, as prescribed by RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(8). In 
addition, RSCH Rule 5.1(f)(9) does not authorize HNN to move for 
an interlocutory appeal to the ICA as HNN is not a party in this 
case, and HRS § 641-1, under the facts of this case, does not 
provide an independent source of appellate jurisdiction to the ICA. Therefore, the ICA was correct in dismissing HNN’s appeal 
for lack of jurisdiction, but it erred in its reasoning.  
11 The merits of HNN’s appeal need not be reached in light of our 
disposition of this case.
