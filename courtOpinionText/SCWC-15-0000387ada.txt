RECKTENWALD, C.J.,  NAKAYAMA, McKENNA, AND POLLACK, JJ., AND  
CIRCUIT JUDGE AYABE IN PLACE OF WILSON, J., RECUSED  
OPINION  OF THE COURT BY McKENNA, J.  
I. Introduction 
This case arises from a dispute regarding whether, under 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (“HRS”) chapter 704,
1 custody of a 
1 HRS Chapter 704 is titled “Penal Responsibility and Fitness to 
Proceed.”     
 
 
  
 
                         
    
 
   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
defendant deemed unfit to proceed due to mental disease or 
2 disorder can be transferred from the Director of Health 
(“Director”) to the Department of Public Safety  
(“DPS”) before a 
judicial determination that the defendant has regained fitness. 
3 The Circuit Court of the First Circuit (“circuit court”)  
answered in the negative, and the Director appealed. The day 
after the Director’s appeal, the circuit court determ ined that 
the defendant, Joseph Tui, Jr. (“Tui”), was fit to proceed, and 
transferred his custody to the DPS.  
The Intermediate Court of Appeals (“ICA”) dismissed the 
appeal as moot, holding that it lacked appellate jurisdiction 
because custody of Tui had been already been transferred from 
the Director to the DPS. 
According to the ICA, the “capable of 
repetition, yet evading review” exception to the mootness doctrine “d[id] not appear to apply” because the “Director ha[d] 
not shown that review of [the] adverse trial court decisions 
2 HRS § 704-403 (2014), titled “Physical or mental disease, 
disorder, or defect excluding fitness to proceed,” provides: 
No person who as a result of a physical or mental disease, 
disorder, or defect lacks capacity to understand the 
proceedings against the person or to assist in the person’s own defense shall be tried, convicted, or sentenced for the 
commission of an offense so long as such 
incapacity 
endures.  
This case concerns issues of whether Tui was unfit to proceed due to mental 
disease or disorder. All references in this opinion to “fitness,” 
“unfitness,” “fitness to proceed,” and “unfitness to proceed” relate only to 
issues of fitness or unfitness due to mental disease or disorder, and not to any other basis on which a defendant might be found unfit to proceed.  
3 The Honorable Richard K. Perkins presided.

 Tui was charged with murdering his cell-mate while 
incarcerated at Oahu Correctional Community Center  (“OCCC”). He 
was later also charged with assaulting a nurse during a prior 
hospitalization at the Hawaii State Hospital (“Hospital,” “State 
Hospital,” or “HSH”).   On January 14, 2015, following a hearing, *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
could not be obtained through other means, such as a petition 
for writ of mandamus or prohibition.” 
Thus, this case presents the procedural question of whether 
the ICA erred in not considering the “capable of repet ition, yet 
evading review” exception to the mootness doctrine on this 
basis. We hold that because there is no requirement that “other 
means, such as a petition for writ of mandamus or prohibition” 
be pursued before an appellate court can consider whether the 
“capable of repetition, yet evading review” exception to the 
mootness doctrine applies, the ICA erred in not considering the 
exception. We then consider whether the exception applies, and 
hold that it does. As the ICA therefore erred in dismissing the 
appeal, we vacate the ICA’s November 9, 2015 “Order Dismissing 
Appeal For Lack Of Appellate Jurisdiction” and remand the case 
to the ICA to address the remaining issues on appeal.

4  Tui was found unfit to proceed pursuant to HRS § 704-404 (2014).  
The proceedings against him were suspended until further order 
of the court, and Tui was committed to the custody of the 
Director pursuant to HRS  § 704-406 (2014) “ to be placed at the 
[] Hospital or an appropriate institution for detention, care, 
5 and treatment for so long as such unfitness shall endure.”   
4 As it stated at the relevant time, HRS § 704 -404, titled 
“Examination of defendant with respect to physical or mental disease, 
disorder, or defect,” provides in relevant part as follows: 
(1) Whenever the defendant has filed a notice of 
intention to rely on the defense . . . or there is reason 
to doubt the defendant ’s fitness to proceed, . . . the 
court may immediately suspend all further proceedings in 
the prosecution. . . . 
(2) Upon suspension of further proceedings in the 
prosecution, the court shall appoint three qualified 
examiners in felony cases . . . to examine and report upon 
the physical and mental condition of the defendant. . . . 
The examination may be conducted on an out -patient basis 
or, in the court ’s discretion, when necessary the court may 
order the defendant to be committed to a hospital or other suitable facility for the purpose of the examination[.] 
5 HRS § 704- 406, titled “ Effect of finding of unfitness to 
proceed,” provides in part as follows: 
(1) If the court determines that the defendant lacks 
fitness to proceed, the proceeding against the defendant shall be suspended, . . . and the court shall commit the defendant to the custody of the director of health to be 
placed in an appropriate institution for detention, care, 
and treatment . . . . 
. . . . 
(3) When the court, on its own motion or upon the 
application of the director of health, the prosecuting 
attorney, or the defendant, determines, after a hearing if 
a hearing is requested, that the defendant has regained 
fitness to proceed, the penal proceeding shall be 
resumed. . . . 
(4) . . . Within a reasonable time following [] 
commitment under subsection (1), the director of health 
shall report to the court on whether the defendant presents 
(continued . . .)

   *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
According to the Director, the Hospital was the only such 
“appropriate institution.”  
Twelve days later, on January 26, 2015, the Director filed 
a motion for an order finding that Tui had regained fitness.  
The Director also moved for a transfer of Tui’s custody f rom the 
State Hospital to the DPS. In the motion, the Director asserted there was no clinical indication for Tui to remain in an 
inpatient hospital unit and that prolonging Tui’s stay was 
endangering patients, staff, himself, and the community at 
large. In the alternative, the Director requested that another 
three-panel examination be ordered. The motion was supported by 
a letter to the court, dated January 23, 2015, from Dr. Allison 
Garrett (“Dr. Garrett”), Tui’s attending psychiatrist at the 
State Hospital. Dr. Garrett’s opinion was that Tui was fit, posed a danger to others, and had a high flight risk.
6 
At a hearing on February 5, 2015, the circuit court orally 
denied the State’s request for a fitness finding and transfer, 
(. . . continued) 
a substantial likelihood of becoming fit to proceed in the 
future.  
 The court, in addition, may appoint a panel of 
three qualified examiners in felony cases  . . . .  
6 The letter from Dr. Garrett also detailed Tui’s cooperative 
condition upon admission at HSH, the opinion of the mental health staff at 
OCCC that Tui’s schizoaffective disorder was in remission, and that Tui was 
capable of planning and arranging for contraband to be brought in to 
facilitate an escape. Apparently, the night he was admitte d to the Hospital, 
despite being disallowed from having visitors, Tui’s sister, at his request, 
attempted to bring him a duffle bag of clothes that contained a concealed 
knife. 
5     
 
 
  On March 18, 2015, the Director  filed a second motion for 
transfer of Tui’s  custody to  the DPS.   The motion was supported 
by letter to the court dated March 17, 2015, from William J. 
May, the Hospital Administrator, indicating that a special 
Administrative Safety Plan had been implemented for Tui  due to 
his violent behaviors and other events that occurred within 
8   hours of his admission to the State Hospital.  
 The hearing  on the Director’s second motion to transfer Tui 
was held on March 30, 2015.   The Director argued that it was not 
                         
   
  
 
 
 
  
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
but ordered that Tui be re-examined.  The circuit court  ordered 
that Tui remain at the Hospital pending a   hearing on that re-
examination. The circuit court ’s order appointing three 
examiners to review Tui’s fitness to proceed and penal 
7  responsibility was entered on March 5, 2015.
7 Parts of HRS chapter 704 have been amended by Act 198 of 2016 
(see Act 198 of 2016, S.B. 2888, C.D. 1, §§ 3 -4), effective July 1, 2016 
(“Act 198”), and Act 231 of 2016 ( see Act 231 of 2016, H.B. 2561, C.D. 1, §§ 
4-6), effective July 11, 2016 (“Act 231”). In broad summary, Act 198 removes 
the provisions in HRS § 704 -404 relating to penal responsibility examinations 
and inserts them in a new section, see Act 198, § 2, and retains provisions 
relating to fitness to proceed examinations, at issue here, in HRS § 704 -404.  
Act 198 requires that, in felony cases, fitness to proceed examinations and 
penal responsibility examinations be conducted separately, unless the court 
orders otherwise. Act 231 is the comprehensive Penal Code revision bill. With respect to HRS §§ 704 -404 and - 406, in broad summary, Act 231 
temporarily eliminates (until July 1, 2018) the requirement that the Director of Health’s designee to conduct fitness and penal responsibility examinations 
be “from within the Department of Health .” Act 198 retains that limitation. 
8 Regarding Tui’s psychiatric stabilit y, the March 17, 2015 letter 
provided updates from Tui’s treatment team at the Hospital purporting to 
demonstrate his continued mental stability, including that his bipolar 
disorder was in remission and that Tui was on a stabilized medication 
regimen, and also included the results of a forensic evaluation. 
6     
 
 
  
 
  
  
   
  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
necessary for Tui to remain at the Hospital.  She asserted that 
although the circuit court had earlier found Tui unfit, Tui 
could be still be transferred to OCCC because his fitness status 
was uncertain in light of the court’s ordering of a three -panel 
re-examination. The Director argued that the authority to order a three-panel re-examination also comes from HRS § 704-404 and 
that under that statute, a patient for whom a fitness 
examination has been ordered does not need to be at the 
Hospital, but can be held at OCCC.  
Tui argued that the court should await the outcome of the 
three-panel re-examination. 
The deputy prosecuting attorney then noted that it was the 
attorney general, representing the Director, that was filing the 
motion, and that the State of Hawai i  as prosecutor had “not seen 
this avenue being taken to get somebody that’s still legally 
unfit back into the general population.” The prosecutor further 
stated that what the Director was requesting was “fraught with 
risks,” and noted “that’s why the State or the prosecutor’s 
office is not joining in on this motion.”   
The circuit court then denied the motion, noting that Tui 
had already been found unfit and that the re-examination was therefore no longer an initial examination of fitness pursuant 
to HRS § 704-404.  The court ruled that pending a ruling that he 
had regained fitness, as an unfit person, Tui could not be held 
7     
 
 
  
   
 
 
     
  
 
   
 Tui  agreed with the Director’s assertion that the ICA has 
jurisdiction over the appeal based on the “capable of 
repetition, yet evading review exception,” and also reiterated 
his argument to the circuit court that a fitness finding was 
                         
 9   The Director’s additional arguments as to why the ICA has 
jurisdiction are not included as they are not necessary to our opinion.  *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
at OCCC.  The circuit court scheduled a hearing on Tui’s three -
panel re-examination report for May 7, 2015.  
The order on the March 30, 2015 hearing did not enter until 
May 5, 2015. The next day, which was the day before the hearing 
on the re-examinatio n, the Director appealed the circuit court’s 
order denying Tui’s transfer. After the May 7, 2015 hearing to review the report of the three examiners who had re-examined 
Tui’s fitness to proceed, the circuit court found Tui fit to 
proceed and committed him to the custody of the DPS. 
B. Appeal to the ICA 
In her Opening Brief to the ICA, the Director repeated the 
arguments she had made to the circuit court. She also argued 
that although Tui’s custody had already been transferred to the 
DPS, the ICA has jurisdiction over the appeal because the 
custody status of a defendant pending re-examination of fitness 
falls under the “capable of repetition, yet evading review” 
exception to the mootness doctrine.

 On November 9, 2015, the ICA issued its “Order Dismissing 
Appeal For Lack Of Appellate Jurisdiction (“Order Dismissing 
Appeal).” The Order Dismissing Appeal provides, in relevant 
part, as follows: 
 Where a subsequent hearing and determination of 
fitness resulted in the circuit court ordering transfer of 
Tui to the Director of Public Safety on May 7, 2015 –two 
days after the 5/5/15 Order Denying Motion for Transfer in 
Cr. 13–1–0375/13 –1–0556 from which Director  appeals- the 
remedy of transfer has already been accomplished, and the 
ICA cannot grant said relief. Kahoohanohano v. State , ‘ 114

32, 45 (1997) (“[a] case is moot where the question to be 
determined is abstract and does not rest on existing facts or rights”).  
 The ICA has no jurisdiction to decide moot cases 
where its judgment “could not be carried into effect, or that relief was impossible to grant.” Lathrop v. Sakatani,

1. Did the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) gravely err 
when it dismissed the Director of Health’s (Director) 
appeal for failure to address the adverse trial court 
decision “through other means, such as a  petition for 
writ of mandamus or prohibition” prior to the Director’s filing of an appeal?  
2.  Did the ICA gravely err when it failed to apply the “capable of repetition, yet evading review” exception to 
the mootness doctrine? Although this Defendant was 
transferred back to the custody of the Director of Public Safety (PSD), the custody status of a defendant 
awaiting a panel re -examination, is implicated in every 
regained fitness to proceed matter. 
    
III. Standard of Review 
IV. 
Discussion 
A. 	 There is no requirement that other means, such as a 
petition for writ of mandamus or prohibition, be pursued before an appellate court can consider whether the “capable 
of repetition, yet evading review” exception to the 
mootness doctrine applies. 
The ICA dismissed  the appeal as moot, holding that it 
lacked appellate jurisdiction because custody of Tui had been 
already been transferred. In doing so, it stated that the 
“capable of repetition, yet evading review” exception to the 
mootness doctrine did not appear to apply because the Director 
had not shown that review could not have been obtained through  
“other means, such as a petition for writ of mandamus or 
10     
 
 
  With respect to writs of mandamus or prohibition, this 
court has stated: 
  
 
 In comparison, there is no requirement that an appellant 
pursue relief through other means, such as through a petition 
for writ of mandamus or prohibition, in order to have an 
appellate court address whether the “capable of repetition yet 
evading review” exception to the mootness doctrine applies to an 
issue on appeal. In other words, although an extraordinary writ 
cannot be obtained if adequate relief is available through an ordinary appeal, the converse does not hold true; an appellant 
is not required to show the unavailability of the extraordinary *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
prohibition.” The ICA did not cite to any legal authority for 
the latter statement, and we could find none.  
A writ of mandamus and/or prohibition is an extraordinary 
remedy that will not issue unless the petitioner 
demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to the relief requested and a lack of other means to redress adequately 
the alleged wrong or to obtain the requested action. Such 
writs are not meant to supersede the legal discretionary 
authority of the lower court, nor are they meant to serve 
as legal remedies in lieu of normal appellate procedures. 
Where a trial court has discretion to act, mandamus will 
not lie to interfere with or control the exercise of that 
discretion, even when the judge has acted erroneously, 
unless the judge has exceeded his or her jurisdiction, has 
committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion, or has refused to act on a subject properly before the court 
under circumstances in which it has a legal duty to act. 
Kema v. Gaddis , 91 Hawai ‘i 200, 204-05, 982 P.2d 334, 338-39  
(1999) (internal citation omitted).  Thus, these extraordinary  
writs are not available if an issue can be adequately redressed 
through a typical appeal.  
11     
 
 
   
 
 
 The Director raises various arguments for applicability of 
the “capable of repetition, yet evading review” exception to the 
mootness doctrine. She asserts that it is the practice of the 
trial courts to order re-examinations to ascertain whether a 
defendant has regained fitness to proceed, but there is no 
explicit statute regarding the procedural process in determining 
regained fitness to proceed. She states that she “will remain 
vigorous in requests to transfer defendants she believes are no 
longer in need of in-patient care and treatment back to the 
custody of the [DPS], while awaiting panel re-examinations” 
given her position that trial courts have discretion to order 
transfer of a defendant before a court confirms regained *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
writ process in order to obtain appellate relief. Moreover, as 
also argued by the Director, extraordinary writs are only 
available where there is a “clear and indisputable” legal right 
to relief. The circuit court ruled that she had no right to the 
relief she requested. Therefore, under the circumstances of 
this case, she had no “clear and indisputable” legal right to 
relief. Thus, the ICA should have addressed whether the 
“capable of repetition, yet evading review” exception to the 
mootness doctrine applies in this case. We therefore address it 
now.  
B.
	 The “capable of repetition yet evading review” exception to 
the mootness doctrine applies. 
12     
 
 
  “The mootness doctrine is said to encompass the 
circumstances that destroy the justiciability of a suit 
previously suitable for determination.”  Wong, 62 Haw. at 394, 
616 P.2d at 203.   Thus, “[a] case is moot if the reviewing court 
can no longer grant effective relief.”  Kaho‘ohanohano, 114 
Hawai‘i at 332, 1 62 P.3d at 726 (brackets in original) (citations  
omitted). Nevertheless , this court has “ repeatedly recognized 
an exception to the mootness doctrine in cases involving 
questions that affect the public interest and are ‘capable of 
repetition yet evading review.’”  Okada Trucking Co., Ltd. v. 
Bd. of Water Supply , 99 Hawai‘ i 19 1, 196, 53 P.3d 799, 804 (2002) 
(citations omitted).   Although the Director asserts that “the 
pre-trial custody of an alleged defendant affects the public *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
fitness. She further asserts that the issue of “the pre -trial 
custody of an alleged defendant affects the public interest, 
will arise in the future, and will almost always become moot 
before a needed authoritative determination by an appellate 
court can be made.” As to the last point, the Director also 
argues that “a real question of law remains unsettled” because 
“the interpretation and application of HRS chapter 704 affects 
the proceedings of all criminal cases (in which mental 
competency is at issue)[.]” The Director therefore requests 
that the ICA’s dismissal order be vacated and this case remanded 
to the ICA for consideration of the points of error raised.  
13     
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
interest,” she does so in the context of arguing applicability 
of the “capable of repetition, yet evading review” exception. 
We note that the public interest exception and the “capable of 
repetition, yet evading review” exception are two separate and 
distinct exceptions. See, e.g.,  Kaho‘ohanohano, 114 Hawai ‘i at 
333 n.23, 162 P.3d at 727 n.23; Lethem, 119 Hawai‘ i at 5, 193 
P.3d at 843 (“[T]his court has explicitly recognized two 
exceptions to the moo tness doctrine: (1) the ‘ capable of 
repetition, yet evading review ’ exception ; and (2) the public 
interest exception. ” (bracketed text omitted)). With regard to 
the exception for matters capable of repetition, yet evading 
review, this court has stated: 
The phrase, “capable of repetition, yet evading review,” 
means that “a court will not dismiss a case on the grounds 
of mootness where a challenged governmental action would 
evade full review because the passage of time would prevent 
any single plaintiff from remaining subject to the restriction complained of for the period necessary to 
complete th e lawsuit.” 
Id. (internal citation omitted). 
The instant case falls within this exception to the 
mootness doctrine. The issue of whether custody of a defendant 
previously found unfit can be transferred from the Director to 
the DPS is an issue likely to evade review.  The facts of this 
case amply demonstrate this point. The issue is likely to arise 
again given the Director’s assertion that she “will remain 
vigorous in requests to transfer defendants she believes are no 
14     
 
 
  
 
  
 
      
    
  
  
 *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAI I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
longer in need of in-patient care and treatment back to the 
custody of the [DPS], while awaiting panel re-examinations.”   
The issue is especially likely to evade appellate review because 
if the Director is correct in her belief that a defendant has 
regained fitness, by the time an appellate court reviews the re-
examination report, custody of the defendant will already have 
been transferred to the DPS, which is what happened in this 
case. 
Therefore, the ICA erred in dismissing the Director’s 
appeal based on the mootness doctrine. 
V. Conclusion 
Accordingly, we vacate the ICA’s Order Dismissing Appeal 
and remand this case to the ICA to address the remaining issues 
on appeal.
