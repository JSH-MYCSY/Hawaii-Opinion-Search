Brent Adams (“Brent”) was forty
 years old when he was 
diagnosed with stage III multiple myeloma, an aggressive and 
life-threatening form of bone marrow cancer. Doctors determined 
that Brent’s best chance of survival was to undergo a tandem 
stem cell transplant in which he would receive a transplant of            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

          his own stem cells, known as an autologous transplant, and, two 
to four months later, a stem cell transplant from a matched 
sibling donor, referred to as an allogenic transplant. Shortly 
after his diagnosis, Brent informed his insurance provider, 
Respondent/Defendant-Appellee Hawaii Medical Service Association 
(“HMSA”), of his intent to pursue autologous and allogenic 
transplants. Brent and HMSA worked closely for the next several 
months to ensure that Brent’s treatment would be covered by 
insurance, but when Brent applied for coverage for the second 
phase of the treatment, the allogenic transplant, HMSA denied 
the claim. Less than three years after his diagnosis, Brent 
died. 
Brent and his wife, Petitioner/Plaintiff-Appellant 
Patricia E.G. Adams (“Patricia”), filed the instant action 
alleging that HMSA acted in bad faith in administering Brent’s 
claim for the allogenic transplant; following Brent’s death, 
Patricia pursued the action in her capacity as personal 
representative of Brent’s estate and in her individual capacity. 
There are genuine issues of material fact as to whether HMSA 
fulfilled its duty of good faith and fair dealing in its 
handling of Brent’s claim. Therefore, the Intermediate Court of 
Appeals (“ICA”) erred when it affirmed the holding of the 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (“circuit court”) that there            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

            are no genuine issues of material fact regarding whether HMSA 
acted in bad faith. 
I. Background 
Brent was diagnosed with stage III multiple myeloma in 
August 2005. He informed HMSA of his condition on November 1, 
2005 and requested information regarding facilities that provide 
stem cell transplants. HMSA directed Brent and Patricia to seek 
treatment at City of Hope, an HMSA-approved Blue Quality Center 
for Transplant located in Duarte, California.1 Dr. Anthony Stein 
(“Dr. Stein”) enrolled Brent in a clinical trial for stem cell 
transplants at City of Hope on December 29, 2005. At the time 
of his diagnosis, Brent was a member of the HMSA Preferred 
Provider Plan for Hawaii Employer-Union Health Benefits Trust 
Fund (“the Plan”). Under Chapters 4 and 5 of the Plan, Brent 
was required to submit a precertification2 request by mail or fax 
to HMSA seeking approval for the autologous and allogenic 
transplants. HMSA had fifteen days to respond to a non-urgent 
request. 
1 A Blue Quality Center for Transplant “is a centers of excellence 
bone marrow program offered through participating Blue Cross Blue Shield 
Plans.” 
2 The Plan defines “precertification” as “a special approval 
process to ensure that certain medical treatments, procedures, or devices 
meet payment determination criteria prior to the service being rendered.”            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

    HMSA assigned case managers to oversee Brent’s case 
and they created a log of notes and communications.3 According 
to HMSA’s log, Patricia notified HMSA that she and Brent were 
leaving for City of Hope on December 11, 2005 to pursue “testing 
and consultation[.]” Patricia states in her declaration that 
she told HMSA that Brent was going to City of Hope specifically 
for the autologous and allogenic transplants and asked if there 
was anything else that Brent needed to do to inform HMSA of the 
treatment plan. She alleges that HMSA did not provide any 
further instructions. 
On December 15, 2005, Dr. Stein submitted a 
precertification request for an autologous transplant. The 
request notes that Brent’s siblings would be tested to determine 
if they could serve as stem cell donors, in which case Brent 
would consider pursuing an allogenic transplant following the 
autologous transplant. HMSA timely approved the request for an 
autologous transplant on December 21, 2005. Two days later, 
City of Hope submitted an “urgent” precertification request to 
test Brent’s siblings’ stem cells. The request was rescinded, 
however, when HMSA explained to Dr. Stein that HMSA would only 
pay for the matched sibling donor if, and when, there was a 
3 Patricia claims that “[m]any of the things in [the log] do not 
square with the facts, and many of the things [the case managers] wrote 
either would not have been said or seem to be things they added which were 
not discussed.”            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 5             
             
           
           
           
         
       
       
            
        
          
          
        
           
        
          
        
         
        
          
           
           
        
          match. HMSA told Dr. Stein that “[o]nly the testing for the 
person donating to this member will be paid for. If all 5 
siblings are tested, only the donor sibling testing will be paid 
for.” This effectively meant that Brent and Patricia would pay 
out-of-pocket to test Brent’s five siblings, and if one of the 
siblings matched, HMSA would reimburse Brent and Patricia for 
the cost of testing the matched sibling. 
Brent underwent an autologous transplant in January 
2006. In preparation for the second phase of the treatment, the 
allogenic transplant, Dr. Stein contacted HMSA regarding Brent’s 
participation in City of Hope’s clinical trial for stem cell 
transplants. HMSA’s log indicates that HMSA informed Dr. Stein 
that clinical trials require precertification approval and are 
assessed on a case-by-case basis. HMSA referred Dr. Stein to 
the precertification division and recommended that he submit 
data supporting the efficacy of the clinical trial. 
In January and February 2006, Brent and Patricia 
communicated numerous times with HMSA about Brent’s intent to 
undergo the second phase of his treatment—the allogenic 
transplant. On January 17, 2006, HMSA informed Patricia that 
Dr. Stein had yet to submit a precertification request for the 
allogenic transplant. On February 6, 2006, HMSA faxed Dr. Stein 
information regarding the process to submit a precertification 
request for an allogenic transplant and noted that this request            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

             was required “if they plan to do anything other than the tandem 
autologous transplant.”4 On February 22, 2006, Brent informed 
HMSA that one of his siblings appeared to be a match and he 
hoped to pursue the allogenic transplant. HMSA replied that a 
precertification request must be submitted and advised Brent 
that “[i]n terms of the care plan, the goals remain appropriate 
and on target[.]” Patricia checked on the status of the process 
two weeks later, on February 27, 2006, and HMSA informed 
Patricia that Dr. Stein had yet to submit a precertification 
request for an allogenic transplant. HMSA noted that Patricia 
wanted Dr. Stein to complete the precertification request 
because they were “desperately trying to avoid any delays” and 
“with the possibility that an allo transplant may be needed, 
they will need as much advance notice as possible[.]” Patricia 
maintains that the autologous and allogenic transplants were 
recommended by Dr. Stein and accepted by HMSA as Brent’s 
treatment plan from the beginning, as evidenced by his attempt 
to enroll in the clinical trial for stem cell transplants on 
December 29, 2005. HMSA advised Patricia that each phase of the 
treatment required precertification authorization.

transplants in a row, as opposed to a tandem autologous-allogenic transplant.            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

            On  March  2,  2006,  Dr.  Stein  submitted  a  
precertification  request  for  an  allogenic  transplant.   Four  days   
later,  on  March  6,  2006,  HMSA  notified  Dr.  Stein  that  the  
request  was  denied  because  the  procedure  was  “investigational.”   
A  formal  denial  letter  was  mailed  on  March  8,  2006.   Patricia  
and  Brent  were  “taken  by  surprise[.]”   They  viewed  the  denial  as  
an  abrupt  change  of  position  for  HMSA,  especially  in  light  of  
the  fact  that  Brent  had  a  matched  sibling  donor.   Without  
approval  for  an  allogenic  transplant,  and  wary  of  further  delays  
in  his  treatment,  Brent  underwent  a  second  autologous  transplant   
in  April  2006,  instead  of  an  allogenic  transplant.    5 
In February 2007,
 Dr. Stein submitted another 
precertification request for an allogenic transplant. This, 
too, was denied. HMSA’s internal appeals board upheld the 
denial of coverage because multiple myeloma was not listed as a 
condition for which an allogenic transplant was covered under 
the Plan.6 Shortly thereafter, Brent filed a request for an 
5 In his deposition, Dr. Stein explained that he waited to file the 
precertification request for the allogenic transplant because he was under 
the impression that he could not submit the request until it was determined 
whether one of Brent’s siblings could serve as a stem cell donor. 
6 Chapter 6 of the Plan provided “[y]ou are not covered for 
transplant services or supplies or related services or supplies other than 
those described in Chapter 4: Description of Benefits under Organ and Tissue 
Transplants . Related Transplant Supplies are those that would not meet 
payment determination criteria but for your receipt of the transplant, 
including, and without limitation, all forms of bone marrow or peripheral 
stem cell transplants.” Multiple myeloma was not included in the list of 
conditions for which allogenic transplants were covered in Chapter 4.            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

           expedited external review of HMSA’s 2007 denial of coverage for 
the allogenic transplant with the Insurance Commissioner of the 
Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (“Insurance Panel”). 
In its April 18, 2007 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and 
Discussion and Order (“FOFs, COLs, and D&O”), the Insurance 
Panel reversed HMSA’s 2007 denial of coverage. The Insurance 
Panel found that although the allogenic transplant was not 
specifically included under the Plan, it was not specifically 
excluded either, and HMSA failed to consider professional 
standards of care and expert opinions in concluding that the 
efficacy of allogenic transplants was not supported by 
sufficient evidence. The Insurance Panel ordered HMSA to 
provide coverage for an allogenic transplant. Brent finally 
received an allogenic transplant covered by HMSA in 2007, but he 
died approximately one year later. 
A. Procedural History 
1. Related Appeals 
HMSA appealed the Insurance Panel’s decision that the 
allogenic transplant was covered under the Plan to the circuit 
court. Shortly thereafter, Brent and Patricia filed the instant 
case in circuit court asserting claims for breach of contract, 
bad faith, intentional infliction of emotional distress 
(“IIED”), negligent infliction of emotional distress (“NIED”), 
and punitive damages. The circuit court stayed the instant case            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

      pending the resolution of HMSA’s appeal of the Insurance Panel’s 
determination granting coverage for the allogenic transplant.7 
HMSA’s  appeal  from  the  Insurance  Panel’s  decision  to  
provide  coverage  for  the  allogenic  transplant  was  affirmed  by  
the  circuit  court;  the  circuit  court  held  that  the  allogenic  
transplant  was  covered  under  the  Plan.   HMSA  appealed  to  the  ICA  
and  the  ICA  reversed  the  circuit  court,  holding  that  coverage  
for  an  allogenic  transplant  was  expressly  excluded  under  the  
terms  of  the  Plan.   Haw.  Med.  Serv.  Ass’n  v.  Adams,  120  Hawaiʻi  
446,  457,  209  P.3d
  1260,  1271  (App.  2009)  (“Adams  I”).   Because  
the  ICA  found  that  the  allogenic  transplant  was  not  covered,  it  
vacated  the  circuit  court’s  judgment  and  remanded  to  the  circuit   
court  with  instructions  to  reverse  the  Insurance  Panel’s  FOFs,  
COLs,  and  D&O  granting  coverage  for  the  allogenic  transplant.   
Id.  
After the circuit court reversed
 the Insurance Panel’s 
FOFs, COLs, and D&O pursuant to the ICA’s order, HMSA moved to 
lift the stay and sought summary judgment on all claims in the 
instant case, which included breach of contract, bad faith, 
IIED, NIED, and punitive damages.8 The circuit court granted

lawsuit in her capacity as personal representative of the estate of Brent and 
in her individual capacity.            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 10 summary  judgment  in  favor  of  HMSA  on  all  claims.   On  appeal,  the  
ICA  affirmed  in  part  and  reversed  in  part  the  circuit  court’s  
judgment.   Adams  v.  Haw.  Med.  Serv.  Ass’n,  No.  30314,  2013  WL  
5443025,  at  *2  (App.  Sept.  30,  2013)  (SDO)  (“Adams  II”).   The  
ICA  affirmed  the  circuit  court’s  grant  of  summary  judgment  in  
favor  of  HMSA  as  to  the  breach  of  contract  claim.   Id.  at  *2.   
It  held  that  there  were  no  genuine  issues  of  material  fact  
because  it  previously  found,  in  Adams  I,  that  the  Plan  expressly   
excluded  coverage  for  allogenic  transplants  for  the  treatment  of  
multiple  myeloma.   Id.  at  *1.   Accordingly,  the  ICA  affirmed  the  
finding  of  the  circuit  court  that  HMSA  did  not  breach  its  
contract  with  Brent  by  refusing  to  cover  the  allogenic  
transplant.   Id.  at  *1.  
As  to  the  bad  faith  claim,  the  ICA  vacated  the  circuit  
court’s  entry  of  summary  judgment  in  favor  of  HMSA  on  Brent’s  
bad  faith  claim  that  HMSA  mishandled  his  claim  for  an  allogenic  
transplant.   Id.  at  *2.   In  so  doing,  the  ICA  distinguished  
between  an  insurer’s  bad  faith  failure  to  investigate  a  claim  
and  an  insurer’s  bad  faith  mishandling  of  a  claim.   Id.  at  *1-2.   
The  ICA  noted  that  Patricia’s  bad  faith  claim  was  based  on  
HMSA’s  unreasonable  delay  in  notifying  Brent  that  an  allogenic  
transplant  was  not  a  covered  benefit  under  the  Plan.   Id.  at  *2.   
The  ICA  emphasized  that  in  her  declaration,  Patricia  alleged  
that  she  had  multiple  conversations  with  HMSA’s  representatives             *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 11 regarding  the  allogenic  transplant  in  late  2005  and  early  2006  
and  “they  were  not  forthcoming  with  information  crucial  to  the  
Adamses’  understanding  of  coverage  under  the  plan,  and  that  
later,  in  March  2006,  when  HMSA  notified  the  Adamses  that  
authorization  for  the  procedure  was  denied,  they  were  
‘surprised.’”   Id.  
The  ICA  characterized  Patricia’s  claim  as  “an  
insurer’s  bad  faith  mishandling  of  a  claim,  which  would  include  
an  unreasonable  handing  of  a  claim,  such  as  an  unreasonable  
delay.”   Id.  at  *1.   Based  on  Patricia’s  declaration,  and  the  
fact  that  HMSA  introduced  no  evidence  that  the  March  2,  2006  
request  for  an  allogenic  transplant  was  reasonably  handled,  the  
ICA  held  that  it  could  not  conclude,  as  a  matter  of  law,  that  
HMSA  reasonably  handled  Brent’s  claim  for  an  allogenic  
transplant.   Id.  at  *2.   Similarly,  the  ICA  found  that  “based  on  
the  evidence  presented  below,  we  cannot  say  that,  as  a  matter  of  
law,  the  Adamses  did  not  present  a  prima  facie  case  for  their  
NIED  and  IIED  claims  in  opposition  to  HMSA’s  motion  for  summary  
judgment.”   Id.   Accordingly,  the  ICA  vacated  the  circuit  
court’s  grant  of  summary  judgment  in  favor  of  HMSA  as  to  the  
NIED  and  IIED  claims,  as  well  as  the  bad  faith  claim  based  on             *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

 9  The  ICA  affirmed  the  circuit  court’s  entry  of  summary  judgment  in  
favor  of  HMSA  on  Patricia’s  claim  for  bad  faith  based  on  HMSA’s  failure  to  
investigate.   Adams  II,  2013  WL  5443025,  at  *2.   It  addressed  Patricia’s  
contention  that  HMSA  acted  in  bad  faith  by  failing  to  investigate  the  claim  
“by  refusing  to  consider  new  evidence  in  2007  that  allo-transplants  had  been  
established  as  the  gold  standard  for  treating  patients  in  Brent’s  
circumstances.”   Id.   The  ICA  noted  that  “an  insured  [cannot]  recover  for  the  
tort  of  bad  faith  failure  to  investigate  where  the  insured  could  not  
establish  liability  on  the  part  of  the  insurer  on  the  underlying  policy.”   
Id.  (alteration  and  emphasis  in  original)  (quoting  Enoka  v.  AIG  Hawaiʻi   Ins.  
Co.,  109  Hawaiʻi  537,  551,  128  P.3d  850,  864  (2006)).   Because  there  was  no  
liability  on  the  part  of  HMSA  to  pay  for  the  allogenic  transplant,  the  ICA  
held  that  a  claim  based  on  HMSA’s  failure  to  investigate  the  claim  could  not  
lie.   Id.  HMSA’s  mishandling  of  the  claim.   Id.   It  affirmed  the  circuit  
court’s  judgment  in  all  other  respects  and  remanded  the  case  to  
the  circuit  court  for  further  proceedings.   Id.  9 
On remand to the
 circuit court, Patricia asserted that 
HMSA mishandled Brent’s claim for an allogenic transplant and 
therefore acted in bad faith. She also maintained her claims 
for IIED, NIED, and punitive damages. As to the bad faith 
claim, Patricia argued that HMSA knew that Brent was seeking an 
allogenic transplant and misled her by providing assurances that 
an allogenic transplant would be covered under the Plan. She 
claimed that HMSA intentionally “kept silent” its policy to 
exclude coverage for allogenic transplants for the treatment of 
multiple myeloma. By remaining silent about its policy, 
Patricia argued, HMSA intentionally delayed the denial of 
coverage to deprive Brent of the opportunity to appeal the            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

            decision. Patricia argued that HMSA mishandled the claim by 
failing to timely inform Brent that the allogenic transplant was 
not covered under the Plan and, therefore, breached the duty of 
good faith and fair dealing implied in the insurance contract. 
HMSA denied Patricia’s allegations and brought a 
motion for summary judgment on all claims. HMSA argued that it 
was entitled to summary judgment on the bad faith claim, 
specifically, because: (1) the two-day period  to deny coverage 
was objectively reasonable, (2) HMSA did not “keep silent” its 
policy on allogenic transplants for multiple myeloma, and (3) it 
did not intentionally deprive Brent of the opportunity to appeal 
the decision. The circuit court agreed and granted HMSA’s 
motion for summary judgment as to all claims. 
b) ICA Proceedings
 
On appeal to the ICA, Patricia challenged the circuit 
court’s grant of summary judgment on the bad faith claim, in 
part, on the basis that the record contained genuine issues of 
material fact with regard to whether HMSA acted in bad faith by 
mishandling Brent’s claim.10 In its June 8, 2018 summary 
10 Patricia alleged three other points of error, none of which are 
before this court. She argued that: (1) th ere was a genuine issue of 
material fact as to whether City of Hope and Dr. Stein acted as HMSA’s 
agents; (2) City of Hope was not required to identify a matched donor prior 
to submitting the precertification request; and (3) the circuit court abused 
its discretion by failing to order a continuance to provide Brent an 
opportunity to obtain affidavits from his siblings in New Zealand.            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 14 disposition  order,  the  ICA  affirmed  the  circuit  court’s  order  
granting  summary  judgment  in  favor  of  HMSA.   Adams  v.  Haw.  Med.  
Serv.  Ass’n,  CAAP-15-0000396,  2018  WL  2753319,  at  *4  (App.  June  
8,  2018)  (SDO)  (“Adams  III”).   The  ICA  determined  that  no  
genuine  issues  of  material  fact  exist  regarding  whether  HMSA  
mishandled  the  claim  because  HMSA  denied  the  precertification  
request  for  the  claim  within  the  time  period  required  under  the  
Plan.   Id.  at  *3.   Noting  that  Chapter  5  of  the  Plan  explicitly  
directed  the  insured  to  submit  a  written  precertification  
request,  the  ICA  found  that  the  absence  of  such  a  request  meant  
there  was  no  claim  for  HMSA  to  process.   Id.   The  ICA  noted  that  
Brent’s  request  for  an  allogenic  transplant  was  first  submitted  
on  March  2,  2006,  and  within  four  days  HMSA  responded  to  the  
request  by  calling  Dr.  Stein  to  inform  him  that  the  request  was  
denied;  the  ICA  also  found  significant  that  a  formal  denial  
letter  was  dispatched  six  days  later  on  March  8,  2006.   Id.   
Because  HMSA  responded  to  the  request  within  fifteen  days,  as  
required  under  the  Plan,  the  ICA  held  as  a  matter  of  law  that  
HMSA  timely  replied  to  the  request.   Id.  
The  ICA  noted   that  “the  duties  of  good  faith  and  fair  
dealing  implied  in  every  insurance  contract[]  arise  after  the  
insured  complies  with  the  claims  procedure  described  in  the  
insurance  policy.”   Id.  (citing  Safeco  Ins.  Co.  of  Am.  v.  Parks,

complied  with  the  claims  procedure  under  the  Plan  by  submitting  
a  formal  precertification  request  for  an  allogenic  transplant.   
Id.   Because  Brent  submitted  the  request  on  March  2,  2006  and  
HMSA  timely  responded  four  days  later,  on  March  6,  2006,  the  ICA  
held  that  HMSA  did  not  mishandle  Brent’s  claim.   Id.   It  
affirmed  the  circuit  court’s  entry  of  summary  judgment  in  favor  
of  HMSA  on  all  claims,  including  the  bad  faith  mishandling  
claim.   Id.  at  *4.

107  Hawaiʻi  48,  56,  109  P.3d  689,  697  (2005).   This  court  has  
also  articulated  that:  
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on 
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there 
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the 
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A 
fact is material if proof of that fact would have the 
effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential 
elements of a cause of action or defense asserted by the 
parties. The evidence must be viewed in the light most 
favorable to the non-moving party. In other words, we must 
view all of the evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom 
in the light most favorable to the party opposing the 
motion.

  III. Discussion 
  The  issue  in  this  case  is  whether,  viewing  the  
evidence  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  Patricia,  the  record  
contains  evidence  establishing  that  HMSA  committed  the  tort  of  
bad  faith  by  unreasonably  handling  Brent’s  claim  for  an  
allogenic  transplant.   It  is  well  settled  in  this  jurisdiction  
that  in  every  first-party  insurance  contract,  the  implied  
covenant  of  good  faith  and  fair  dealing  ensures  “that  neither  
party  will  do  anything  that  will  deprive  the  other  of  the  
benefits  of  the  agreement.”   Best  Place,  Inc.  v.  Penn  Am.  Ins.  
Co.,  82  Hawaiʻi   1 20,  123-24,  920  P.2d  334,  337-38  (1996).   A  
breach  of  this  covenant  is  referred  to  as  “bad  faith.”   Id.  at  Wh
en a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as 
provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon 
the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party’s 
pleading, but the adverse party’s response, by affidavits 
or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth 
specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for 
trial. If the adverse party does not so respond, summary 
judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the 
adverse party.            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 17  
           
            
             
            
         
  A  claim  for  bad  faith  arising  from  the  relationship  
between  the  insurer  and  the  insured  can  be  grounded  in  an  
“unreasonable  handl[ing]”  of  the  insured’s  claim.   Francis  v.  
Lee  Enter.,  Inc.,  89  Hawaiʻi   234,  238,  971  P.2d  707,  711  (1999).   
“This  court  has  held  that  reasonableness  can  only  constitute  a  
question  of  law  suitable  for  summary  judgment  when  the  facts  are  
undisputed  and  not  fairly  susceptible  of  divergent  inferences,  
because,  where,  upon  all  the  evidence,  but  one  inference  may  
reasonably  be  drawn,  there  is  no  issue  for  the  jury.”   Willis  v.  
Swain,  129  Hawaiʻi  478,  496,  304  P.3d  619,  637  (2013)  (internal  
quotation  marks  omitted)  (quoting  Guajardo  v.  AIG  Haw.  Ins.,  118  
Hawaiʻi  196,  206,  187  P.3d  580,  590  (2008)).   Consequently,  the  127,  920  P.2d  at  341.   When  an  insurer  acts  in  bad  faith,  it  
gives  rise  to  a  cause  of  action  for  the  tort  of  bad  faith.  
[T]he  tort  of  bad  faith  is  not  a  tortious  breach  of  
contract,  but  rather  a  separate  and  distinct  wrong  which  
results  from  the  breach  of  a  duty  imposed  as  a  consequence  
of  the  relationship  established  by  contract.   Therefore,  
the  tort  of  bad  faith  allows  an  insured  to  recover  even  if  
the  insurer  performs  the  express  covenant  to  pay  claims.   
As  such,  an  insurer  could  be  liable  for  the  tort  of  bad  
faith  for  certain  conduct  where  it  would  not  be  liable  for  
a  tortious  breach  of  contract.  
Id. at 131, 920 P.2d at 345 (internal quotation marks and 
citation omitted). Thus, the tort of bad faith does not arise 
from a breach of the terms of the contract, but rather, from a 
breach of a duty to act in good faith inherent in the 
relationship between the insurer and the insured.            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 18   To  determine  whether  an  insurer  reasonably  handled  a  
claim,  we  consider  the  conduct  of  the  parties  to  the  contract  
before  and  after  the  formal  submission  of  the  claim.   See  
Guajardo,  118  Hawaiʻi  at  202-07,  187  P.3d  at  586-91.   In  
Guajardo,  the  plaintiff  was  struck  by  a  vehicle  while  she  was  
crossing  the  street.   118  Hawaiʻi  at  198,  187  P.3d  at  582.   The  
insurer  of  the  driver  of  the  vehicle  offered  to  settle  the  
plaintiff’s  claim  for  $100,000,  but  the  plaintiff’s  insurer,  AIG  
Hawaiʻi  Insurance  Company,  Inc.  (“AIG”),  refused  to  authorize  the 
settlement.   Id.   AIG  required  the  plaintiff  to  obtain  a  
judgment  against  the  driver  “to  protect  [AIG’s]  subrogation  
rights  as  required  under  her  policy.”   Id.   The  plaintiff  filed  
suit  against  AIG,  alleging  that  it  acted  in  bad  faith  by  
misrepresenting  that  the  policy  required  the  plaintiff  to  pursue  
the  driver  to  judgment.   Id.  at  202,  187  P.3d  at  586.   This  
court  analyzed  AIG’s  conduct  starting  at  “[t]he  first  
communication”  between  the  plaintiff  and  AIG,  when  the  plaintiff  
reported  that  she  had  been  hit  by  a  vehicle.   Id.  at  203,  187   issue  of  whether  HMSA  “unreasonably  handle[d,]”  Francis,  89  
Hawaiʻi   at  238,   971  P.2d  at  711,  Brent’s  claim  for  an  allogenic  
transplant  is  suitable  for  summary  judgment  if  the  only  
inference  to  be  reasonably  drawn  from  the  record  is  that  HMSA  
reasonably  handled  the  claim  for  the  allogenic  transplant,  
Willis,  129  Hawaiʻi  at  496,  304  P.3d  at  637.             *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 19   Similarly,  in  the  instant  case,  it  is  necessary  to  
examine  the  relationship  between  the  insurer  and  the  insured  
throughout  the  entire  claims  process,  starting  from  “[t]he  first  
communication”  between  the  parties,  to  determine  whether  the  
insurer  acted  in  bad  faith.   Id.  at  203,  187  P.3d  at  587.   It  is  
not  sufficient  to  determine  only  whether  the  insurer  complied  
with  the  terms  of  the  contract.   Best  Place,  82  Hawaiʻi  at  131-
32,
  920  P.2d  at  346-47;  see  also  Enoka,  109  Hawaiʻi  at  552,  128  
P.3d  at  865  (“Surely  an  insurer  must  act  in  good  faith  in  
dealing  with  its  insured  and  in  handling  the  insured’s  claim,  
even  when  the  policy  clearly  and  unambiguously  excludes  
coverage.”).   Here,  the  ICA  analyzed  HMSA’s  conduct  without  
considering  its  conduct  throughout  the  duration  of  its  
relationship  with  Brent,  starting  with  the  first  communication.   
The  ICA’s  analysis  was  limited  to  the  period  from  the  day  the  
precertification  request  was  filed,  March  2,  2006,  to  the  day  
the  request  was  denied,  March  6,  2006.   Adams  III,  2018  WL  
2753319,  at  *3.   It  found  that  HMSA  handled  Brent’s  claim  in  a  
reasonable  manner  when  it  responded  to  his  claim  for  benefits  
within  four  days  of  receipt  of  the  request,  as  required  under  P.3d  at  587.   Review  of  the  conduct  of  AIG  throughout  the  course  
of  the  claims  process  revealed  genuine  issues  of  material  fact  
as  to  whether  AIG  breached  its  duty  of  good  faith  by  
unreasonably  handling  the  claim.   Id.  at  206,  187  P.3d  at  590.             *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 20  
  Taking  into  consideration  HMSA’s  conduct  throughout  
its  entire  contractual  relationship  with  Brent,  the  record  
contains  facts  that  are  “fairly  susceptible  of  divergent  
inferences,”  Willis,  129  Hawaiʻi   a t  496,  304  P.3d  at  637  
(citation  omitted),  regarding  whether  HMSA  “unreasonably  
handle[d]”  Brent’s  claim  for  an  allogenic  transplant,  Francis,  
89  Hawaiʻi  at  238,  971  P.2d  at  711.   HMSA  became  aware  that  Brent  
was  considering  pursuing  an  allogenic  transplant  on  December  15,  
2005,  but  did  not  inform  him  that  an  allogenic  transplant  was  
not  a  covered  benefit  under  the  Plan  until  after  the  claim  was  
submitted  on  March  2,  2006.   In  light  of  the  evidence  in  the  
record,  a  reasonable  inference  could  be  made  that  HMSA’s  failure  
during  this  two  and  a  half  month  period  to  inform  the  Adamses  
that  an  allogenic  transplant  was  not  covered  under  the  Plan  
could  have  led  Brent  and  Patricia  to  believe  that  an  allogenic  
transplant  was  covered.  the  Plan.   Id.   The  covenant  of  good  faith  and  fair  dealing  
implied  in  the  insurance  contract,  however,  required  HMSA  to  act  
in  good  faith  before  and  after  the  formal  submission  of  the  
claim.   See  Best  Place,  82  Hawaiʻi  at  131-32,   920  P.2d  at  345-46.  
Thus,  the  ICA  erred  because  it  did  not  examine  the  conduct  of  
the  parties  before  the  formal  submission  of  the  claim  on  March  
2,  2006.             *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 21            
         
            
            
            
         
         
            
          
            
        
            
           
          
             
           
           
          
         
            
          
          
          
         There is further evidence in the record that could 
support the inference that HMSA unreasonably handled the claim 
because it was aware that Brent was attempting to test his five 
siblings to determine if one was a match, and yet, did not 
inform Brent that the treatment was not covered under the Plan. 
The December 15, 2005 precertification request for an autologous 
transplant noted that Brent’s siblings would be tested to 
determine if they could serve as stem cell donors, and that if 
one of them could, Brent would consider pursuing an allogenic 
transplant. Two days later, on December 17, 2005, City of Hope 
submitted an urgent precertification request to test Brent’s 
siblings’ stem cells in the hopes that one of the siblings would 
match and Brent would be eligible for an allogenic transplant. 
The request was rescinded, however, when HMSA explained to Dr. 
Stein that it would only pay for testing if one of the siblings 
proved to be a matching donor. Brent and Patricia paid out-of-
pocket to test Brent’s five siblings to determine whether he was 
eligible for an allogenic transplant. Thus, the record could 
support the inference that HMSA unreasonably handled the claim 
because it was aware that Brent was taking steps to pursue the 
treatment by having his siblings tested, but did not inform 
Brent that an allogenic transplant was not covered under the 
Plan. Instead, HMSA’s conduct may have implied that an 
allogenic transplant was covered because it assured Brent that            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER *** 
 22               
    
  In  the  two  months  preceding  the  formal  submission  of  
the  claim  on  March  2,  2006,  there  is  evidence  that  HMSA  
continually  instructed  Brent  to  submit  a  precertification  
request  for  an  allogenic  transplant  and  assured  Brent  that  his  
“care  plan”  and  “goals  remain  appropriate  and  on  target[.]”   
This  could  also  support  the  inference  that  HMSA  “unreasonably  
handle[d]”  the  claim  by  leading  Brent  and  Patricia  to  believe  
that  an  allogenic  transplant  was  covered  under  the  Plan.   
Francis,  89  Hawaiʻi   at  238,  971  P.2d  at  711.   According  to  HMSA’s  
log  of  its  communications  with  Brent  and  Patricia,  on  January  
17,  2006,  Patricia  discussed  with  HMSA  Brent’s  intent  to  pursue  
the  allogenic  transplant  if  one  of  his  siblings  could  serve  as  a  
donor.   Also  according  to  the  log,  on  February  22,  2006,  Brent  
informed  HMSA  that  it  appeared  that  his  sibling  was  a  match  and  
“he  didn’t  want  to  wait  until  the  last  minute  to  get  [the  
allogenic  transplant]  approved  and  wanted  to  know  what  needs  to  
happen[.]”   HMSA  advised  Brent  that  it  sent  Dr.  Stein  the  
necessary  documentation  and  instructions  for  submitting  the  
precertification  request.   HMSA  also  noted  that  “[i]n  terms  of  
the  care  plan,  the  goals  remain  appropriate  and  on  target;  no  
change  in  plan  or  acuity.”   Again,  on  February  27,  2006,  
Patricia  stated  that  she  checked  on  the  status  of  approval  for  if one of his siblings was a match, HMSA would pay for the cost 
of testing that sibling.            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***

possibility that an allo transplant may be needed, they will 
need as much advance notice as possible[.]” HMSA replied that 
it would send Dr. Stein another reminder to file the 
precertification request. Dr. Stein submitted the 
precertification request on March 2, 2006 and HMSA denied the 
claim on March 6, 2006. Dr. Stein stated in a deposition that 
he was surprised by HMSA’s denial of coverage because, 
throughout months of contact, HMSA never indicated that an 
allogenic transplant was not covered under the Plan: 
My office and other City of Hope personnel had several 
contacts with HMSA in early 2006 attempting to obtain 
authorization for Brent’s second tandem transplant to be an 
allogenic rather than autologous transplant, and we were 
never advised that allogenic transplant was not a benefit 
of Brent’s Plan. 
Patricia also described in her declaration being “taken by 
surprise” when HMSA denied the claim “because no one had ever 
mentioned anything about HMSA denying the allo transplant. . . . 
We could not understand how HMSA could suddenly change its 
position on covering the allo transplant when we knew Brent had 
a matched donor.” Thus, the statements of Dr. Stein and 
Patricia could constitute evidence that HMSA acted in a manner 
that may have led Brent, Patricia, and Dr. Stein to believe that 
the allogenic transplant was covered under the Plan, which could 
support an inference that HMSA unreasonably handled the claim.            
 24   As  noted,  “reasonableness  can  only  constitute  a  
question  of  law  suitable  for  summary  judgment  when  the  facts  are  
undisputed  and  not  fairly  susceptible  of  divergent  
inferences[.]”   Willis,  129  Hawaiʻi  at  496,  304  P.3d  at  637  
(internal  quotation  marks  omitted)  (quoting  Guajardo,  118  Hawaiʻi  
at  206,  187  P.3d  at  590).   The  foregoing  facts  are  “fairly  
susceptible  of  divergent  inferences,”  id.,  namely  that  HMSA  may  
or  may  not  have  “unreasonably  handle[d]”  Brent’s  claim  for  an  
allogenic  transplant.   Francis,  89  Hawaiʻi  at  238,  971  P.2d  at  
711.   Because  divergent  inferences  may  be  reached  based  on  the  
facts  of  this  case,  the  issue  of  whether  HMSA  “unreasonably  
handle[d]”  Brent’s  claim  for  an  allogenic  transplant  is  not  
suitable  for  summary  judgment.   Id.

IV. Conclusion 
HMSA’s
 duty of good faith and fair dealing arose as a 
consequence of the relationship established by the insurance 
contract entered into by Brent and HMSA. Evidence of HMSA’s 
conduct during its relationship with Brent raises genuine issues 
of material fact as to whether HMSA “unreasonably handle[d]” 
Brent’s claim for an allogenic transplant. Id. We vacate the 
ICA’s July 6, 2018 judgment on appeal affirming the circuit 
court’s grant of HMSA’s motion for summary judgment on the bad 
faith claim and also vacate the circuit court’s order granting 
summary judgment in favor of HMSA as to the bad faith claim. We            *** FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST’S HAWAIʻI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER ***
